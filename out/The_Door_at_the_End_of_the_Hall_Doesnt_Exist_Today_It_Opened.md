My mother was murdered last week. She was a pious woman, overly so. But she was a good woman, I chose to believe. Misguided, but she lived her life by her own metrics. My dad left us when I was young, taking with him my older sibling by blood to start a new family. Mother and I stayed until I could take no more and fled to the opposite side of the country.

When I received the news of her passing, I was numb. Part of me was ecstatic, that I was free. But most of me was sad, guilty. It was my own mother. She had raised me to be what I considered a half way decent young man. Perhaps it was some sort of duty that I decided to buy out my siblings stake in the house, to claim it all myself. None fought, provided any sort of counter, and the very next day I was provided a set of old keys fixed to a large key ring.

In truth, I was seeking a means of returning to the east. A few months prior to the death of mother, James, my elder brother, reached out to me. We had an instant kindling, as long lost siblings often do, speaking of sports and cars and women. It was James that broke the news to me, of mother's passing. I had just returned from a trip to Florida, seeking new ventures closer to home.

It was a hot day in September that I entered my beat down Toyota, tightly packed with everything I deemed worth keeping. In my rear view mirror was my past, my present, but most certainly not my future. The darkness that permeated my past came shooting at my; its tendrils of lucidity grasping at the tires. The thick miasma of its deep depths washed over me, needling into my arms. I shook my head. The tendrils retreated, pulling back into my part. My eyes fell onto the cracked windshield, to my future. I pulled out of the designated parking spot of my apartment, and turned the page.

The drive was a four day cross country tour, stopping in several states as I made my way from Arizona out to North Carolina. The drive itself was uneventful, full of rock albums I had grabbed from a thrift store somewhere in New Mexico. Bands that I had never heard of, bands I will never list to again. All lost to my past.

The cold air was the first thing I noticed after exiting my car. The second, the freshness of it. The weight of my past had well and good been left behind me, unable to keep up with the breakneck pace of the old Toyota. Its creeping tendrils would have given up somewhere back around the junction of the I17 and the 101, an hour or so after I left.

The white house was still white, if only in splattered hidden splashes. Most of the paint was now patina, frayed and weathered. The roof was balding, even missing in chunks. Rafters hung dismally from the the thing, as if the whole of its heart had been ripped from its center. Windows were crack, shattered, the targets of rocks and stones. The door was plastered with adverts, warnings from the HOA, and empty boxes. No doubt these were at one point full of whatever fleeting subscriptions my mother had on her last days.

As I walked up the sloping driveway, I could see how it use to be. Pristine white walls, flowers blooming before the porch, every window shined to a crystal like appearance. The door shook me from my stupor. Its shedding wooden surface was covered in deep grooves and cuts. It was as if some beast had ran its fingers, tipped to razors, down the door. Some of the adverts and fliers had even been torn along these.

Stunned, my mind raced at what could have possibly done such a thing. A kid with a knife, angry at the world, taking it out on the house that surely the whole block knew was currently empty? A scorned neighbor mad they didn't get the chance to do my mother in? Perhaps the devil himself, come to pay twisted homage to his own equal passing the mortal toil?

Fumbling with the keys for a moment, I pushed the thoughts to the back of my mind. How long had it been since I was last home? These could be years upon years of willful neglect for all I knew. I mentally added the door to the long list of things to repair or replace. The key slid into the lock, turning with a loud *clink*, and I entered the house. Entered my future, my present.

And my past.

Entering the house was like a slap in the face. It was a rude awakening, and entering a nightmare all at once. The house was decrepit, an ancient tomb of cobwebs and dirt. Heavy in the air was the stench of death and age. Mothballs mingled with rotting fruits.

Every piece of furniture was covered loosely with a white sheet, as if whomever had done the walk through wanted nothing more than to leave the mausoleum to its enteral slumber. The gaudy light fixtures that looked like stolen street lamps stood out nearly a foot, just as silent and dead as my mother. From where I stood at the front door I could see down a dark hall, its blackness an engulfing void with no end. The stairs next to that creaked and groans from nothing but the weight of the memories held within these four walls, drooping and twisted and leading somehow both up and into hell. The longer I stared into the void that was the house, the more it stared back. The more its maw opened wider, and wider, and wider, threatening to swallow the whole of my world. The sheets became dancing ghosts, white flames tickling the heavens above.

My hand fumbled and I quickly tried to locate the light switch, frantically tapping the wall with sharp *thunk, tuh-thunk* that echoed into the void before me. I wanted to scream. Everything felt as if it was circling me, spinning into a drain, dragging my whole and sanity with it. My throat tightened, my muscles screamed. I screamed.

At long last, just as my own heart began its own war song, my fingers found purchase along the cold, plastic edge of eternity. The switch flipped, and

Darkness.

Darkness.

Endless abyss.

Cruel, creeping tendrils shooting cold venom into my veins.

My phone. My phone had a light. My phone was salvation. Salvation. Anything but this. Please.

The ghosts began to scream and rattle and chant. The hell from the stairs called to me. It sang to me. A promise of peace and safety. Which pocket? The front, empty. The thing from the hallway's mouth began to close around me, its breath hot and rancid and fresh with meat and blood. Somewhere within that maw I saw its last victim, saw myself. My jacket pocket, surely. My fingers fought to enter, pushing against the fabric as it laughed maniacally. The things tongue brushed against my face, wet and hot. I grabbed my phone, ripping from my pocket and almost sending it flying away from me. Down the maw of the thing. Into oblivion, where I would surely be reunites with it.

The moment my phone left my pocket, the screen lit up. The world became a sea of gold and blue and color. Oh! The color!

I suddenly felt very silly as I watched the ghosts shift back to sheets, the maw drift back to nothing but a long hall, the stairs stop their choir. I could feel my heart in my throat, slamming as it tried to jump to smack some sense into my brain. Down the hall, I saw a flash of white pass through a closed door. Part of my delusions, I told myself. Yet, I could still hear the devil laugh.

Perhaps it was just one last trick. One last torment. One last punishment. A final goodbye. From my mother.

As I made my way down the hall, to the basement and the breakers, I recalled my childhood with my mother. When I was a child, and I would misbehave as a child does, the punishments were immediate and swift.

The one that stood the strongest in my mind was when I was 5. I had just come home from school, high off the cupcake we were given for someone's birthday. Mine was chocolate, with a green frog ring embedded into the swirl. It had green and blue glitter, an ombre of swamp water for my little from to rest. I was not allowed much sugar as a kid, perhaps the one thing I can genuinely say was a positive impact on my adult life. Needless to say, I was on the moon. The ride home, and mother was already becoming upset. But it was when I tripped on a loose shoe lace that her ire came down as a hammer.

In a swift motion, she grabbed me by my collar, dragging me down the hallway. We went past three doors, a bathroom, the guest room that my grandmother would sometimes use, and my room. The door on the right, the last one in the hallway, slammed open with a clash of thunder.

“Get down there, pray on your sins, and don't come out until I get you!”

Often she would add “or hell be to pay,” at the end, and truth be told, I couldn't say if it was added this time or not. I? I was too busy rolling down the dingy stairs to the bottom of the basement. I tumbled deeper into the depths, the darkness engulfing me.

Perhaps it was this memory, the fire of it, that triggered me so as I entered the house. Regardless, it was the basement that I went to. The breaker was deep in the basement, at the back wall with the laundry and boxed junk. It was an uneventful repair, getting the main breaker back online. I was out of the basement and into the hallway as quick as my legs would carry. The feeling of being watched, that something was waiting for me around every corner, behind every box, inside the walls. It made my back tense, a cold fear run along my spine.

Now with the lights, I was free to full explore the old building. Mausoleum was an apt word for it. The smell of death and mothballs still hung in the air, fighting against some sort of scented plug in now churning. I was doubtful it helped.

I started in the kitchen. A fruit basket had been left to rot for who knows how long, protected from flies and maggots by the thin wrap of plastic placed over it. Popping open the fridge, I saw much of nothing. A few jars and bottles of sauces and condiments and a single can of cola. The cupboards were much of the same, with only canned good remaining. The idea of a home cooked meal my first night at my new house went up in a puff of black smoke.

Taking inventory of what utensils and pots I had, I found those just as lacking as the food. Most of the pots and pans were in the oven, topped with a thick layer of dust and webs. They were a cheap brand, regardless, so nothing I would have kept. The kitchen tools were sparse, with a knife block, a few spoons, and a drawer dedicated to carry out sauce packets and package cutlery. Mother had been eating, but she hadn't cooked for a long time.

I doubled back, noticing something odd about the knife block. Despite how untouched the kitchen felt, there was a knife missing. The large kitchen knife that I doubt mother would have touched even if she did cook. Opening a few drawers, and nothing. The knife was missing. It was the only knife missing, so I supposed she might have given it away to someone mentioning needing a new one.

The living room was sterile and unlived. There was no tv, no radio, no fireplace. A single, round table sat in the center of the area, topped with an array of religious magazines. Some were open, some were neatly stacked. A bible say below, on a shelf, heavy and worn. I wondered if she would have even been able to lift the damned thing, let alone crack it open at church.

I wondered down the hall, taking note of the rooms. The left held the guest room, which I claimed as my own for the time being. Beyond that was a bathroom, untouched, and finally mothers room. My hand hung over the handle for a moment, but I decided I wasn't ready to see. I turned to the right, noting the empty wall at the end of the hall. Behind me, on the right, was a single door. It led to the basement.

Happy enough with the layout, and with an idea for the rooms, I decided to gather my belongings.

Entering the garage, I was surprised to not only find it empty, but the lights in good shape. Mother did not have a car, refusing to pay for hers to be claimed from impound. That did leave the empty garage to the flies and the spiders. Each corner was thick in webbing, made all the more noticeable with the layers of dust.

The large door slid open with a groan, a giant snake popping at the joints as it moved for the first time in eons. Light from the sun began to drift in, over taking the small light bulb. Blinking to adjust to the intensity of the natural light, my car slowly came into focus. Along with him standing next to it.

It was James. He was taller than me, his hair short and clean shaven. An attorney of some sort, he had helped me with drafting the offer letters to my siblings for buying the house. I was thankful for him then, but I would be lying if I said that seeing him now was not at least a little irritating. I put a smile on, shook off the irritation, and went to put a show.

“James!” I called out to him, “Good to see you, brother!”

He turned to me, his face stern and calculating for just long enough to catch it, before softening to a broad smile. I always loved his smile; the way it always reached his eyes. “Ah, Marc!” He embraced me, wrapping me in his arms around me shoulders. He was taller. He smelled of fancy cologne, one of those French names. *Dior* or *Chein*.

As we pulled away, “Marcus, please.”

“Of course, my bad.” He looked past me, into the den of spiders. “Marcus. How was your drive?”

“It was... divine. It felt like I was well and truly turning the page.”

“How many times did you listen to that song, huh?” James smacked my arm, some brotherly love. He continued, “I'd wager you broke that disk half way down the 70!”

I laughed, “No, I saved that one for tonight.” Turning towards the house, I let out a breath. “First night in the old house.”

“Head in, check it out?” James asked, “Got the main power back on?'

“Yeah,” I spoke softly, too softly at first, before repeating louder, “Yeah, yeah, let's head on in.”

Inside, the plug in had done some work. The air was still stagnant, but fresh linen masked some of the rotting fruit. Not enough, as it was the first thing out of James' mouth.

“God, who the fuck left fruit in here? In summer?”

“I mean, I'm in a coat.” I added, feeling embarrassed. Even if I had truly owned the place for all of 10 minutes, it was still mine.

“Yeah, but,” James seemed to look for the right word, maybe even avoiding weird. Or different. He seemed to catch my thought, giving me a side eye before shooting me a look back, “No. Not that. I was going to say, 'Desert Lizard.'”

Sighing, I really took the whole of it in. “God, maybe I am, though? I mean, none of you even remotely wanted this house. Yet, here we are.”

“Don't beat yourself up. When dad left-”

I cut him off, knowing where it was going. “Mom only wanted to keep me. For some fucked up reason.”

We stood in silence for a moment. James cut through, “Sure, it's a bit of a fixer upper, but some good bones.” He took all of it. “I wish I knew her more. The funeral was beautiful, but I just felt... disconnected.”

“A blessing, believe me.”

“I tell you what,” James spoke confidently, always one with a plan. “I have a meeting I have to go to. But, I'll have one of the interns drop off some goods for you. Cleaning supplies, maybe some food. This weekend we're on a hiatus while the city figures out its shit. I'll be by, we'll catch up.”

His hand was on my shoulder. It was comforting. “Thanks, honestly, I appreciate it. I know things have been... strange between all of us. But I would love to try and get closer.”

“Don't worry about the others. They'll either come around, or they wont. Who gives a fuck?” James sounded convincing, if nothing else.

“Bring the beer.” I interjected, wanting to not dwell on something I had no control over.

James smiled, “We don't have much of that micro-brew, IPA, bull you west coasters like, but I'll bring the good stuff.”

Before he left, he asked for the bathroom. I pointed him down the hall, and began to take inventory of the kitchen. A moment later, James came back, a puzzled look on his face. “Has that door at the end of the hall always been there?”

“What door?”

Sure enough, at the end of the long hall, was a door that doesn't exist. It was the same as any other door in the house, wood and sturdy. It wasn't its presence that shocked me, it was the scratches. Deep and identical to the front door.

The next few hours were a whir. They came and went quicker than regret on a Friday night bender. James was good to his word, sending some pretty intern over, maybe Kara or Kayla? With her was what I really cared about; garbage bags, sponges, cleaning supplies, and good old fashioned beer. It was a symphony of suds and water, bag after bag filled and thrown into the spiders. I had all but forgotten about the door.

It was late, but luckily the local pizza place ran a special. I had enough to throw the kid a 20 when he dropped off the pizza. He lingered for a moment.

“What's up, man? Didn't I give you enough?”

“Ah, well its not that. It's just...” The kid stuttered out the words. “I heard about the lady that died here.”

“What about my mother?”

“I mean, I heard it was brutal.”

I glared at him, trying to keep the irritation down. I'd call his boss, have him reprimanded. “And?”

“Did they catch the guy?”

Fuck it, I thought. I'll teach him a lesson. “No, I'm right here, aren't I? Why don't you come on in?”

“Whatever man.”

“Naw, c'mon man. Let me show you the knives the old broad left me.”

“Stop it,” the pizza boy cried out, obviously upset.

I smiled at him, wide and toothy. “The long one is my favorite, the way it just glides-”

“Shut up!” He screamed at me. “See if I ever deliver your shit again, asshole.”

“Egg my house and I'll find you,” I called after him. He all but ran to his car. He flipped me the bird as he drove off. I returned a smile and a wave.

Back into the house I went, stopping a moment to look over the door as I stepped inside. Papers still littered its scarred surface. Grabbing what I could with an empty hand, I slammed the door, locking it with a loud *click*.

It was quiet inside. Had it always been so quiet? The hall before me was dark. Grimacing, I swung by the hall and flicked the light on. I felt better with the light on, but something was still off. *Just one too many beers,* I thought to myself. My mind drifted to the door. In the light of the hall, the door was there. It was really there. I put the pizza on the kitchen table, then turned back to the hall.

I slowly walked the stretch of the hall, watching the door. It felt like a rabid beast, hiding in grass, ready to lurch out. My throat tightened, running dry. I ran my fingers along the wood. It was cold, but most certainly real. I felt the edge of the door, the way it rose from the wall. I reached for the handle, my mind racing. What was on the other side? Surely a linen closet, maybe a room that I misremember? The knob turned slowly, then, it stopped. Locked.

After all that, and it's a locked door. It was a relief. Now I don't have to worry about whatever the door is. I'm not getting in there, and nothing is getting out. Saying something was even there.

My dreams were vivid, empty, and cold. I was in an expanse of nothingness, drifting in the currents of the void. My limbs hung loosely at my sides, uncontrollable and frozen. My eyes were fixed to what I could only assume was the sky. A single star glittered above, a Morse code ballad. There was no breeze, no clouds, no temperature. It felt as if in a sea, the to and fro twisting my stomach into knots, while somehow also feeling as if falling. It was silent, save a single repeating phrase. My mother's voice, asking in a pained voice, over and over, and over. “Why?”

I shot up, my chest heaving and my blood a torrent. It was dark, but lightly illuminated from the morning sun dripping into the room from the now open windows. The smell of rot had left after the cleaning, but I hadn't gotten the mothball out. A new scent was now prevalent; sweet, and thick, like bumbling sugar.

In the silence, I gathered my surroundings. I was in the living room, on the floor, surrounded by albums and photos from mother. Her Polaroids. How did I end up here? Did I not remember climbing into the guest bed, I wasn't going to sleep in mother's, and laying sleepless for an hour? Eventually I had blacked out, but not before putting some white noise on. Beach sounds tonight, something relaxing to help calm my mind.

I picked up one of the photos, this one from on my lap. It was of me and mother, mother and I she would have corrected. We were dressed Sunday best. Despite being a 90's baby, the photo had the look of one from the early 1900's. Black and white, both her and I unmoving, no smiles, overtly serious. I was maybe 10 years old, with my hair cut short to my scalp. I could hear mother's voice from that day. She had been particularly short tempered. The church had gone with that young whore over her for the youth speaker, a position she had been pursuing for well over a decade.

We went to a mall, a local one that was only a short drive out of town. While I was excited to go look at the toys, the car up for a grand prize, and maybe even a lunch of Chinese food, my mother had a singular task on her mind; the photo studio. She had somehow convinced herself that the church just did not know how great of a mother she was, that a photo session with her strapping young man would change everything.

“Oh, we are so sorry, they would say, we had no idea how perfect of a king he is. Of course the position is yours if you were to grace us with taking it?” The pastor would grovel at her feet. She would then, out of spite or anger, or because she was a woman who did not truly know what she wanted, reject the offer. She would walk away and never been seen by anyone from that particular church again.

I had a hard time sitting still long enough for the photo effect to be properly done, the suit was just so itchy. My mother shot daggers at me every time the photographer would say that she needed one more shot. Eventually, we got the shot. Mother held my hand so tight that it hurt, ached for the rest of the day. She dragged me out of the mall despite my pleads. We hadn't gone to see the toys, the puppies, or even eaten yet. Mother slapped me across the face.

“What a vile boy, asking your poor mother so much more of her when you give so little.” Her face was stern and in a perpetual frown. “Look at what you made mother do, you poor child. You believe mother to want to hurt you? No, it is your actions that made mother do this. Remember, Mother does this because she loves you. It is through the trials and tribulations that you will come to know God.”

That was the day I decided god was a lie.

Three years later, mother hit me for the last time. I was too big for her to be able to physically threaten. But I was large enough that my teenage threats of violence were real to mother. She locked herself in her room for days, not coming out, repent for me as the devil was in my body.

However, there was one universal piece that connected all the photos. Red ink, drawn into harsh lines across my mother. Each photo, save the one on my lap, shared a cross hatch of red across my mother. The old timely ones at the mall to the print outs of digital photos taken by cousins or aunts at a party or wedding. Who ever had done this took great care to avoid anyone else in the pictures. Only mother was touched by red.

I stood, cracking my back and stretching. My shoes were missing, my shirt gone, and I was in nothing but my pajama pants. I hated being barefoot, which made all the more odd that my slip on shoes were missing. I figured they must be in the room, leaving them there when what ever possessed me to leave the room took hold.

Down to the hall I went, wiping my face with my hands. I'd grab my shoes and-

A hand, white, cold, frail. It was coming from the door at the end of the hall. Its fingers danced lightly on the wall, giving a tap, tap, tap. My eyes widened and my body tensed. No soon that did I lay eyes on it, did it shoot back inside the closet door with a soft *thud*.

I ran down the hall to the door. Who the fuck was in my house? Was that this door, some way for them to be inside and hide from me? I'll make them pay, I'll-

“Get out! I saw you, there's no point in hiding, come on out!” I screamed at the door.

I was met with silence. The door seemed as lifeless as always. The only sound was my own heart in my hears, my breath sharp and quick. I pounded on the door.

“Come on, man. I saw you. There's no point in hiding now.”

Nothing.

*Whack, whack, whack*. The door pounded back. I jumped, cursing as my soul left me for a moment.

“Alright jack ass, you want to play like that?” I grabbed the handle. It turned. The door swung open. A linen closet. There were towels, and sheets, and white rags, and-

and eyes. Buried in the white towels were a small set of white eyes staring at me. I froze, afraid to even breath. But the lights are on, how? I balled a fist and swung at the towels. I found purchase with the towels, them giving way to my hand. The eyes were now gone.

I heard a laugh.

I swung around, just in time to see an old woman- no, to see mother- standing in a gown. Her hair was white and seemed like she was floating in water. Her eyes were gone, black sockets of blackness. She smiled at me, teeth yellow and old, before stepping into a wall, into my room. Then, the closest door slammed shut. I turned around again, watching it as it opened and closed violently. Each time I could see the linen closest inside. Each time it opened, the insides would flash with black and nothingness.

Then, it hung open. The insides of the closest was gone. In its stead was an endless abyss, stretching for miles and miles. At the far end was a nuclei of blackness. I could hear the song. It was beautiful. It sang of promises and a life so beautiful. A tear began to run down my face. I saw my future, my past, and all I could ever be. My dreams and my desires and my heaven.

The door slammed shut. I could hear my mother laughing at me from deep in the house. Her voice rang in my mind. *You will never know peace, you brat. Mother takes hers in flesh, demon child.*

The door disappeared. After my encounter, I ran out of the house, shoes be damned. I called James, who was more than happy to reenter the house with me. I told him the story of how mother herself had come to see me. Of course, he didn't believe me. Why would he? And the door? It was gone when we went back in. Just a wall, no linen closet or towels or even an indent in the wall where a door once was.

He stayed with me until I had collected myself. James was a good man, a better brother. More than I could ever be.

“It's gotta be stress man,” he spoke between bites of his breakfast burrito. “I mean, you're all alone in the house where you were all but tortured. Of course you'd see mom!”

“This wasn't a hallucination man. The lights were on, I hit the switch as I ran down the hall.”

James swallowed, thinking things over for a moment.

“Besides,” I continued, “it doesn't explain how you saw the door first. And now, it's gone!”

“Right,” James agreed, “that's valid.”

I hadn't touched my food much. It was a burrito, best in the city according to James. I had taken a few bites, mostly out of politeness, but also because I already felt the hang over from last night ripping my guts apart. Some food would have done me good.

“She went violently,” I spoke softly, “we all saw the report. Mauled, for a lack of better words.”

James nodded. “Never caught the guy, either.”

I tried to take a bite of the food, but I couldn't do much but chew and keep it in my mouth for a moment. Eventually, I took a long drink from my mug, using that to swallow. “I can't shake the feeling that it's my fault.”

He put a hand on my shoulder, “Man, you can't blame yourself. You were half way across the country?”

“Well,” I started unsure of how to continue, “I wasn't. It's not like I was in town, but I was down in Florida for a job interview. Before all of this, I was already looking to move back East.”

“Wait, you were in Florida? When she...” He made a gagging sound and ran a thumb across his neck.

I nodded, sitting back in the chair. “Yeah, maybe a 5 hour drive.”

“That's still far. But I guess it would be close enough to feel guilty.”

“It's not just being in Florida that gets me. You know, its like only because I moved out. That I wasn't good enough for her that I had to be chased off after I graduated.”

James shook his head and sighed. “She's got her teeth in you good. You were always good enough, she wasn't able to cope with dad leaving. Mom probably needed help, more than any of us could give her, and more than she would accept from anyone. I mean, even the church cut ties with her at the end.”

I turned to him, curious and an eyebrow raised. “The church?”

“Yeah, man. She called me a lot after you moved, even called me you a few times, 'Oh, my little Marc,' she would say.” He took a drink, using as a chance to think for a moment. “You know she was banned for calling a child a slut?”

I laughed, “That sounds like her. God, when Abby got the child care lead over mom she went on and on about how much dick she would get, how the devil would use her as a play thing.”

James joined me in laughing, before we both went quiet for a moment. “She was honestly probably jealous that she got some, mom never did even talked to a man after dad left.” James clicked his tongue. “Shit, I can barely go a week sometimes.”

“Your wife must love that,” I added. “Not your libido, but talking about how bad your own mom needed to get laid.”

“Hey, she's the one who said it!” He spoke in between laughs.

I put a hand on his shoulder, looking him in the eyes. “Seriously, thanks for giving me the time of day. All the others, they would have sent me to voicemail. They have, actually.”

“Hey, I won't complain. Gets me a bigger slice of the pie when none of them want to talk out a deal. They all gotta pay me.” He threw both thumbs back towards his chest.

“Yeah, well think of us little guys every once in a while, won't ya?” I threw a napkin at him, which harmlessly bounced off his head.

“What was that? I can't hear you down there in peasant town!” He cupped his hand and imitated an echo.

“What's the weather like up your own ass?”

James and I hung out for a few hours more, talking about nothing much but just being. It was nice to have a real friend. Sure, I had a few out west, but they were as real as any friend made at work. You're close as along as you both are going through the same shit as each other. Then, it all grows apart when one of you gets a new job.

After lunch, he had to head out. That left me alone in the house again. At this point, I hadn't forgotten about the closest, but it was in the back of my mind. What I felt in the house was more a nagging dread more than anything else. Like someone is watching you. Like something is watching you.

That's how it went for the next few days. Nothing would happen, the door was still gone, but I would still feel like mother was watching me.

They found her in the basement, her body eviscerated by a thousand cuts from a knife. Someone had stabbed and slashed at her so much that it was only by her rosary that she was identified. That I was able to identify her. A single bloody footprint was found, leading away from her body. But being a men's size 10, that didn't narrow the search down all that far. The knife, or knives for all we knew, were never found. None of the neighbors heard anything from the house, or saw any cars come or go out of the usual.

The only lead that anyone had was a single comment from a neighbor, who said they saw a beat up Toyota rolling down the street that night.

The day mother came for a visit began pleasantly, with a dinner from a local pub. It was a cheese burger, served with a knife ran through as a sandwich pick. I got it more done, but they gave it to me almost mooing and bloody. The drink came out wrong. I swore they were messing with me, making fun of me for my late mother. A bloody mary, when I asked for a Guinness.

I met a lovely young lady, shared a few drinks, before sharing numbers. I wasn't ready to have anyone over to my place with the mothball scent still strong, and she had an early shift. So we made plans for another night, sharing a quick kiss as we separated.

As I left the pub, my old car was covered in crows. A whole murder of them. I tried to scare them off, and one merely cawed at me. I was in disbelief. Not a single car had a single bird on it, save mine. I could already image the bird shit everywhere. Triggering the alarm sacred them off, allowing me to enter.

The drive home was quiet but happy. The radio had a classic playing, by the young-ins standards. Korn was singing about how they were coming undone. I found metal shortly into high school. It was a way of rebelling against my overly religious mother, that I could choose something that was not only a praise of his holy-less, Jesus. I never shared that love with mother. She would have deemed it worthy of punishment, much like if I had brought home a girl.

I had made good habits of leaving lights on as I leave the house, especially in the evening. I was glad I had built that as the sun was well past the horizon as I pulled into my driveway. The garage slowly pulled open, slithering like a giant snake in the foliage. James and I had watched the game that morning, two rival football teams slugging it out. It came down the who's quarterback played tighter, with my west coast favorite sneaking in a win with a late game drive.

I entered the house, locking the door behind me. The lights shone brightly, even the street lamp like fixture I had really been meaning to remove. I had no strange occurrences since the closet and mother almost a week and a half gone. By now, it was a stress dream. A waking nightmare brought on by my fear of darkness and the stress of mother. Nothing more.

Throwing my keys onto the counter, I felt my phone go off. Checking it, I had a few unread messages. One from James, something about how they'd get us next time. Below that was a message from an unknown number, who ended up being the cutie from the bar. She said she was looking forward to when she could expect that date from me, a selfie that was a touch risqué, and an apology for work, she would have called in if it wasn't a required meeting. I sent back my own selfie, not as provocative but twice as awkward, telling her that I understood, it just gave me time to make sure the first date was as perfect as she was. I was new to the whole flirting thing. Back west, I never had much interest in women, or dating. It was awkward and hard. A lot of missed cues and wrong messages. But now that I was back east, ready to really start my new life, I was ready to take a leap of faith. Faith. That was her name, right?

It was a good day, I though. An almost perfect day. I put my phone on the counter., then, I looked down the hall.

Betwixt the undulating of the walls and the breathing of the hall, the door stood cold and resolute. It was slightly ajar, the darkness within creeping out as the whole of the hall breathed. The lights, all at once, failed. I was plunged into the blackness of the house once more. My mind raced.

A laugh came from behind, cold and callous.

“You dare speak to such a whore?”

I tried to find who spoke in the darkness but it was too thick, too total to see anything. I reached for my phone, panicking as I found my pockets empty. I felt a chill run along my spine, squeezing at every vertebrae.

“You hurt your poor mother, after everything she did for you?”

The voice seemed to come from everywhere all at once, as if it was all around me, it was me. It reverberated off my skull, in my ears, through my bones. It was cold, hateful, angry.

The darkness around me began to grown and spread, wrapping its great tendrils around my limbs and my throat. My lungs fought for each breath as the air grew dangerously cold. My skin was a hodgepodge of goose bumps and sweat, botched and tense.

“But now, mother is going to make you pay. Make you pay for all the pain you put mother through.”

I felt something brush up against my back, solid and firm. It nudged me deeper into the hallway, towards the darkness. I could feel its breath on my face, hot and wet. Another nudge against my back. Another step towards the door.

“You will pay for what you did to mother. Repent for your sins!”

“What sins? Because I left, because I needed a life?” I screamed out to the darkness. I tried to turn and run, to leave the hall, to find my phone. I needed something, anything, that gave me a sense of safety, that could fight off the darkness.

Mother laughed cruelly, mocking me. Her laugh cut at me. “You dare think this is for leaving your poor mother alone? No. Look. Look!”

This time something more substantial pushed me, hard. It knocked me off balance, sending me falling into the hallway. I landed on my rear, but kept my head and chest up. Mother's face appeared before me, inches from my own. She snarled at me, baring her old and yellow teeth. Just as quickly, she was gone. I pushed back, trying to escape her. As I did, her hands slammed down between my legs, white with claws as long as kitchen knives. The eviscerated the carpet, slamming into the wooden sub floor with a mighty *shlink*. They did not retract, they merely faded before falling again.

My back hit something solid. The end of the hallway.

“Now, look! Look and see what mother must punish you for!”

Everything went silent for what felt like hours. Slowly, I began to lift myself onto my feet. Mother didn't strike at me again. Instead, I felt her next to me as she began to pull on the closet door. I stepped to the side as the door swung open. This time, it was neither a linen closet nor a vast sea of nothing. It was a small room, with a small box in its middle.

I carefully stepped towards the box, keeping my eyes up, as if it would help against mother. The box was no larger than a shoe box, the lid slightly ajar. I grabbed the lid. Cold disbelief began to worm its way inside my mind. How? Who put these here? What were these?

Inside the box, was a long, blood stained kitchen knife. Its blade was bent, chipped from striking something hard. I recognized the blade, the very one that was missing from the knife block in the kitchen. The missing murder weapon.

Below the knife, was a single photograph. It was taken by an old Polaroid camera, the same as mother would use. It showed a shadow covered figure standing over what I could only assume was mother, a knife dripping with blood. Mother had a hand up, trying to protect her, as she took a photo of whom had killed her.

“You filthy child!” Mother's voice screamed out from within the room. I was sent flying out of the closet as I felt what had to be mother's full form slamming into me. I fell sprawled out onto the floor, the now open basement door at my side.

I was confused, scared, lost. There was no way that it was me. That I had hurt mother. Sure, she had hurt me, and I felt no sorrow over her passing. But to think that I would have? When I was in Florida for the week, wasn't I?

Then a memory came flooding back. An angry phone call, heated words, hatred.

A sharp pain radiated from my leg, breaking the memory. It burned of cold fire and the heat of life. I look down to see mother, one hand digging into my calf. The blades of her hand ripped my leg to shreds. I could see bone, not white as everyone likes to say, but a pink tone. The wounds were already oozing deep crimson.

“Mother must punish you, Marc. But remember, mother loves you.”
