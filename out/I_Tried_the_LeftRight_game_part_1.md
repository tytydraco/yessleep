**Drive on the road, turn left, then take the next right, and take the next left again, repeat this process until you arrive at somewhere...new.**

The left/right game was a famous story in nosleep posted 7 years ago, one of which I was fully invested in. If you haven't heard about it, I suggest you read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/5uAEqNL1Tk).

My name is Mike, and I am someone who takes interest in the existence of other worlds, alternate realities, or other "dimensions". I even read it 3 times over the last few years and listened to its podcasts and audiobooks. You could say I'm a bit of a *fan*.

I didn't know what came to me, but one day I decided I should give it a try.

I live in the Philippines, and the only possible location to do this is in its biggest city, the capitalÂ  of Metro Manila, where most urban development is based on a grid system. However, heavy traffic is also a common problem in the streets, so I decided to do it on a holiday when most people are in their homes - new year's day, January 1st 2025.

I remember the horrors that the characters faced in the story, and you might be wondering why I would even dare try it in the first place. As someone who likes these kinds of stories, I am also a skeptic, a science man that doesn't believe in anything without evidence. It's ironic, but I was also bored and wanted to find excitement in my routine corporate life.

The dangers? There were a lot of misfortunes on the road based on the original story, but I saw it as an elaborate plot for the main character to reach her destiny of becoming one with the road, and to evolve into something much greater. What if the game is attempted by some regular joe like me? The best case scenario is I make a fool of myself. The worst case? Well, that's what I want to find out.

...

Over the course of December, I prepared the necessities for survival: Camping gears, food supplies, first aid kits, radio, and self defense weapons (axe, hammer, crowbar, baseball bat, switchblade, and even pepper spray). I drive a well conditioned 4x4 toyota pick-up truck with all-terrain tires, so I'm confident that my ride is reliable. With a full tank and a few gallon containers behind the truck, what's left is to enjoy the holidays before my planned journey.

I only shared this with my close friend, Pete, in which he just replied with prolonged laughter, called me crazy, and said I should just get a girl instead. But my resolve was fixed. I told him my planned route, and instructed him that if i don't come back in 2 days, he knows how to find me. He agreed and said,

"Whatever man, just don't get lost. I'm gonna spend time with my family so I can't come with you. You're most likely to find a traffic violation than your new world anyway."

"Wanna bet on it?", I said.

"Php 5,000 (100 bucks) if you find anything other than  wasted time", replied Pete.

We shook on it and wished each other happy holidays.

...

The day came. It was 8AM and I was preparing to start my drive after eating a hearty meal at a nearby Mcdonalds drive thru. *I wonder if the road has fast foods.*

After drinking the last drop of my daily caffeine, I revved my engine, played some upbeat music, and started my journey - by taking the first left turn.

Most people were asleep, probably from the drinking and celebration of the new year, so most streets have little or no traffic. I kept thinking about the original story, and thought to myself that everything that happened then was for a grand purpose. Everyone in the story eventually became part of the road. Thus, If ever I will be *admitted* to this new world by playing the game, does it mean that I too, will face the same fate?

I shrugged away the thought and decided it is best to consider this as an exploration - no more, no less.

I was done on my 14th turn and I kept my driving slow and steady to observe anything unusual. So far what I found was a passed out drunk dude on the curb, a few beggars, and two stray cats on a tense face-off. Nothing out of the ordinary, until I completed my 23rd turn.

*A tunnel* ! I thought excitedly.

This must be it. A sign that the story is absolutely real. I checked google maps to see my current location. I'm very familiar with the city and there is definitely no tunnel here before, nor there's a need for one. In the story, a tunnel also served as a threshold between our world and *the road*.

My excitement was immediately replaced with dread. If this is real, then all those things, the hitchhiker, jubilation, the silent city, and the forest, must be real. What other horrors could possibly lie beyond this tunnel?

I've come this far, plus, I could always turn back, I hope.

I scanned my surroundings. I'm at the 23rd turn, but I can see other cars passing behind the intersection. I waited for 30 minutes for any car to turn in the street i'm currently in. Nothing. It's as though this street doesn't exist in their perspective. I glanced back at the tunnel, dark and looming with uncertainty - but strangely inviting. 

I took a deep breath, and entered the tunnel.

It felt normal. No strange sensation like the air getting heavier. The place still looks man-made: concrete walls and road lights. I noted that I drove a good 2km before I saw the light at the end of it.

Here goes nothing.

I promised myself that I will document whatever I can on the road. My dashcam will take care of whatever is in front of the car, and I also took with me a film camera just in case digital gadgets won't work here. I already took a photo of the tunnel and the street I'm in.

As I exit the tunnel, I was met with blinding light and the first glimpse of the new world. It was...not that different from the streets of Manila. The original buildings were still here, but I had the strange feeling that they became fewer. I couldn't identify which ones are missing, but other than that, the best confirmation that proved I am already *here* is obvious:

**There were no other cars but me.**

I concluded that the road will mostly appear normal. But normal doesn't always mean safe. The road will also look different if you're in another part of the globe, taking the appearance of your geography and locality. It was certain at this point, that I am cruising through uncharted territories.

Am I welcome here? Or will the road try to drive me away? Or worse, will it try to consume me? These thoughts kept spinning in my head as I carefully drove on the road while watching out for the next possible turn. I remember that in the story, there was always a hitchhiker. It was said that you should always pick him up, but never dare to interact with him as bad things will likely happen. However, I'm not sure if the same rule exists for this *version* of the road.

As I made my 6th turn after the tunnel, I glanced at the road sign saying "Dolomite Beach, 5km ahead". I chuckled and remembered how that beach came to be. It was a government project to help the people improve their "mental health". But for the huge budget allocated for this one, you know what I mean.

I slowed down my vehicle when I noticed that there was someone up ahead of the road. Waiting. Could this be the hitchhiker? 

It was a woman wearing a blue sundress, and she was holding the hand of a little girl, perhaps her daughter? Her hand was extended to signal that she was looking for a ride.

My heart was pounding. This is definitely the case of the hitchhiker. But since this is a different place, I decided to test the opposite.

**Rule for the hitchhiker: If you don't pick them up, they will always appear at the backseat of your car.**

As I drove past them, I noticed that the woman's eyes were all black, like two empty voids filling up her eyeballs. The same goes for her daughter too, only that, she had tears falling off... She was crying.

The woman had a blank expression on her face, her stare followed me as I drove by. I braced for what may come next. Nervously glancing at the rearview mirror, I waited for them to magically appear in my car. However, all I saw was their figure disappearing behind my view as I gained more distance.

I let out a sigh of relief, and waited for the next turn.

My relief was short-lived. Up ahead I can see a grown man in a red shirt. He was also extending his hand. His eyes were also all black, but he had this menacing aura that I just couldn't brush off. I also drove past him instead. His eyes followed me with the look of anger. *If you want to be pickup-up, you should've looked a bit nice at least*. I said to myself.

And sure was, the same thing happened. He didn't magically appear at my backseat to strangle me to death - thank the heavens. I kept driving until he disappeared in my rearview mirror. Then in a few minutes, I noticed another signboard up ahead. As I got closer, I read the sign:

**"Dolomite Beach, 5km ahead".**

Dammit. I knew there was a catch. Not picking up the hitchhikers will only make you go through a loop.

As expected, the woman and her daughter were still waiting. This time, I stopped to pick them up.

I pray that whatever happens, hopefully Pete will keep his word and try to find me.
