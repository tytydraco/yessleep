I don’t know how much time I have. I’ve called the police, but I live on the edge of town, and the dispatcher sounded… skeptical. She said they’d send a car for a wellness check. A wellness check. I can hear it outside my bedroom door, and I don't think "wellness" is on its mind.

I'm writing this down because I need someone to know. I need the sequence of events to be recorded, because if they find me, I don’t think the scene will make any sense. And if they don’t find my brother… well, I don’t want to think about that.

It all started three months ago when my life took a nosedive. The kind of spectacular, cinematic failure that you see in movies but never think will happen to you. I lost my job, and then, in a cascade of bad luck and worse decisions, I lost my apartment. I had nowhere to go. My parents are gone, and my friends are scattered, most of them struggling themselves. There was only one option left: my younger brother.

He lives in a small, two-bedroom rental at the very last stop of civilization before the woods begin. The kind of house that’s cheap for a reason. He was happy to have me, of course. We’ve always been close, even more so after our parents passed. I was supposed to be the one looking out for him, the stable older brother. The irony was a bitter pill to swallow as I moved my life, crammed into three cardboard boxes and a duffel bag, into his spare room.

I knew he had issues. He’d never been the same since the accident.

About five years ago, he was driving cross-country. A solo trip to "find himself," as you do in your early twenties. Somewhere in the vast, empty expanse of the desert, he fell asleep at the wheel. The car went off the road and flipped, multiple times. He was lucky to be alive, a fact the state trooper who found the wreckage the next morning repeated to him like a mantra.

But he wasn't found by the trooper. Not at first.

The first few hours after the crash were a blur to him. He remembers crawling out of the mangled steel, the world upside down, bleeding and disoriented. The sun was setting, painting the sky in violent shades of orange and purple. He was miles from anywhere, the highway a silent, empty ribbon. He thought he was going to die out there. And then he saw a figure, walking toward him from the direction of the distant, flat-topped mesas.

He couldn’t describe the man clearly. Old, he said. Skin like cracked leather, long, dark hair braided with things that glinted in the dying light. He carried a staff. A shaman, a medicine man, something out of a forgotten history book. My brother was delirious, convinced he was hallucinating from blood loss. This man, he said, tended to his wounds with strange-smelling poultices and gave him water from a clay jug that tasted of dirt and minerals. He spoke in a language my brother didn't understand, a series of clicks and soft, guttural sounds. But my brother said he understood him perfectly in his head.

The old man told him he was lucky. He said something had been drawn to the violence of the crash, something that lingered in those empty places. He had intervened. He had performed a ritual to bind my brother’s life force, to keep it from slipping away into the sand. But such things, the man had conveyed, always have a price. He had anchored my brother to the living world, but the anchor had a chain.

The final thing my brother remembers the man telling him before he passed out was this: *You have been saved, but you will not go home alone.*

When he woke up, the sun was rising, and the state trooper was shining a flashlight in his eyes. There was no sign of the old man. Just a single, dark feather lying on the car’s dashboard.

The doctors chalked it all up to trauma. A concussion-induced hallucination. A coping mechanism his brain created to deal with a near-death experience. And I believed them. It was the logical, sensible explanation.

But the accident left him with more than just a story. He came back… changed. He developed a crippling claustrophobia. He couldn't be in elevators, or small rooms without windows. He’d have panic attacks in crowded movie theaters. And he developed the nightmares. Every single night, he had terrible, vivid nightmares. He’d wake up screaming sometimes, drenched in sweat, his heart hammering against his ribs.

And then there was the window.

His bedroom window, the one that looked out onto the dense, dark woods behind the house, had to be open, and I mean wide open. All the time. When he was sleeping, the curtain would be drawn, but the window behind it was always slid as far as it would go. It didn’t matter if it was a pleasant summer evening or the dead of a freezing winter. That window was open.

When I first moved in, I thought it was just a quirk, a part of his anxiety. Fresh air, the illusion of an escape route, whatever. I’d wake up in the morning and the whole house would be frigid. I’d find a thin layer of frost on the kitchen counter. I’d see my breath in the hallway. I complained, I reasoned, I begged.

“I can’t,” he’d say, his face pale and drawn. “I just… I can’t close it. I can’t breathe if it’s closed.”

I felt guilty for pushing, so I let it go. I bought a thicker duvet. I wore sweaters around the house. I accepted it as part of the price of living with him. It was his house, his rules. I was just the freeloader brother crashing on his charity.

The first month was fine, or as fine as things could be. I was looking for work, he was going to his part-time job at the local library. The house was cold, and he was still having nightmares, but it was a stable routine.

Then things started to get worse.

His nightmares became more intense. I could hear him through the thin walls, whimpering and thrashing in his sleep. Sometimes he’d talk, short, choked-off phrases. “Go away… don’t look at me… not here…” One night, I heard him say something so clearly it made the hair on my arms stand up: “It’s in the trees again. The tall man.”

When I asked him about it the next morning, he just shook his head, his eyes wide and haunted. “It’s just dreams,” he’d mutter, but he wouldn’t meet my gaze. He said the dreams were always the same. He was in his bed, in his room, but he was paralyzed. And through his open window, standing just at the edge of the woods where the moonlight couldn’t quite reach, was a figure. Tall. Impossibly thin, like a line of ink drawn against the darkness. It never moved, it never did anything. It just watched him.

I told him it was stress. My moving in, his own anxieties. I suggested therapy again. He refused, just as he always did.

Around the same time, the small, inexplicable things started happening.

It began with my keys. I always leave them in the ceramic bowl by the front door. One morning, they were gone. We tore the house apart looking for them. I found them three days later inside the freezer, nestled between a bag of frozen peas and an ice tray. I laughed it off, blamed my own stressed-out mind for doing something so stupid.

Then it was the TV remote. It vanished from the coffee table and reappeared on top of the bathroom medicine cabinet. My brother’s library card showed up inside my shoe. It was annoying, a series of frustrating little mysteries that we both blamed on each other’s absentmindedness, on the general chaos of two adults sharing a small space. But it felt… wrong. There was a subtle malice to it, a feeling of being toyed with.

Then came the scratching.

It was always at night, usually around 3 a.m. A faint, scuttling sound from inside the walls. My first thought was mice, or squirrels. I bought traps, put them in the attic and the crawl space. They remained empty, the bait untouched. The sound continued. It wasn't the frantic scrabbling of a rodent. It was slower, more deliberate. A dry, rasping sound, like a long fingernail being dragged across drywall. It would start in the wall of the living room, then move to the hallway, sometimes seeming to come from the ceiling right above my bed. My brother claimed he couldn’t hear it over the sound of the wind coming through his open window. I think he was lying. I think he just didn’t want to hear it.

The most unsettling thing, though, was the dirt.

Because his window was always open, leaves and dust and bits of debris from the woods would blow into his room. Every morning, part of his routine was to sweep up the small pile that had accumulated on the floor beneath the sill. One morning, I woke up before him and went to make coffee. I glanced into his room as I passed, and what I saw made me stop.

The scattered leaves and dust on his floor were arranged in a pattern. A distinct, intricate spiral, coiling outwards from a central point. It was too perfect to be natural, too deliberate to be a trick of the wind. It looked like one of those sand mandalas, but made of dead leaves and grit.

I stared at it for a long time, a cold dread coiling in my stomach. When my brother came out of the bathroom, he saw me looking. He just sighed, a weary, defeated sound, and went to get the dustpan. He didn't act surprised. He just swept it up without a word, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

I saw it again a week later. And then again. It was never the same twice, sometimes a simple spiral, sometimes a more complex, web-like design, but it was always there on windy nights. The wind, I told myself. It has to be some kind of bizarre vortex effect caused by the airflow in the house. A freak of physics. But I didn't believe it. Not really. I started to feel like I was a guest in a house that had its own secret life, its own quiet, creeping madness.

My patience began to fray. The constant cold was seeping into my bones. The nightly scratching was wrecking my sleep. I was on edge, irritable, and my job search was going nowhere, which only made things worse. I looked at my brother, with his hollowed-out eyes and perpetual shiver, and I saw the source of the misery that had permeated the house. I saw his open window as a gaping wound, letting in the cold, and all this… strangeness.

I became obsessed with that window. I felt that if I could just close it, everything would go back to normal. The cold would stop. The drafts would stop. The leaves and their disturbing patterns would stop. The scratching would stop. My brother’s nightmares… maybe they would stop, too. Maybe being in a warm, secure room would finally make him feel safe.

I was a rational person. I believed in science, in cause and effect. I was convinced that all of this : the paranoia, the misplaced objects, the sounds, was a psychological symptom of our shared stress, amplified by the physically uncomfortable environment he was forcing on us. Close the window, warm the house, and the "haunting" would disappear. It was simple.

Yesterday was the final straw. I woke up after a particularly bad night. The scratching had been louder than ever, and I’d heard my brother crying in his sleep. I stumbled out of my room, shivering, and found a new pattern on his floor. It wasn’t a spiral this time. It was a long, thin shape, like a stick figure, but with arms that were too long and fingers that were like rakes. It was made of pine needles and black soil.

I just stared at it, and a rage I hadn't felt in years boiled up inside me. It was so profoundly, deeply *wrong*.

My brother was at work. He wouldn’t be home for hours. I knew he’d be furious. I knew it would be a betrayal of his trust, of the one rule he had in his own home. I didn’t care.

I walked into his room. The cold air hit me. It smelled of damp earth and decaying leaves. I could see the trees outside, dark and skeletal against the grey sky. I went to the window, my hands trembling with a mixture of anger and a strange fear. The frame was icy to the touch. With a grunt of effort, I shoved it down. The rattling slam as it shut was the most satisfying sound I’d ever heard. I flipped the lock, a stiff, metallic click that echoed in the sudden, profound silence of the room. For good measure, I pulled the thick curtain fully across it, hiding the grey light of the day.

The effect was instantaneous. The room, for the first time since I’d arrived, felt like a part of the house. The oppressive, wild presence of the outdoors was gone. I stood there for a moment, breathing in the still, quiet air. I felt a sense of triumph. I had fixed it. I had finally taken control.

My brother came home late that evening. He seemed tired, but in a normal way. He didn’t mention the window. We ate dinner, watched some TV. The house was warm. It was peaceful. It felt like home. For the first time in months, I felt like things were going to be okay. When he went to bed, he just said, “Goodnight,” and closed his door. He didn’t notice. The curtain was drawn, and he was too wrapped up in his own world.

I went to my own room feeling vindicated, even a little smug. I fell asleep faster than I had in a long time, cocooned in the comforting warmth and silence.

The screaming is what woke me up.

It was raw, primal terror. A sound of pure agony that ripped through the quiet house. I was out of bed before I was even fully awake, my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. I ran to his door and wrenched the handle. Locked.

"Hey! Hey, what's wrong?" I yelled, pounding my fist on the wood.

His screams dissolved into gasping, choking sobs. "I can't—! It won't—! Can't breathe!"

"Open the door!" I shouted, jiggling the knob frantically. "Just open the door!"

"No! Stay out!" he shrieked, his voice cracking with a new kind of panic. "Oh god, what did you do? *What did you do?*"

"I don't know what you're talking about! Let me in!"

"The window!" he wailed, and the sound was so full of despair it froze my blood. "You closed the window! I can feel it! You closed it!"

A sudden, violent bang rattled the door in its frame, as if he’d thrown his entire body against it. Then another. 

"It was cold!" I yelled back, my voice shaking. "It was just a window!"

His reply was a choked, gurgling laugh that was the most terrifying sound I have ever heard. "A window? You think it was for *me*? You idiot!  It was for *it* to get out!"

The rational part of my brain was short-circuiting, unable to process what he was saying. It felt like the floor was tilting beneath my feet.

"What are you talking about? What is 'it'?"

"The man in the trees!" he screamed. "The price! He told me! He told me I wouldn't go home alone! It followed me! It's always been with me!"

The story from the desert came rushing back. The shaman. The price. The anchor with a chain.

I could hear him scrambling away from the door, his breath coming in ragged, wet hitches. "The nightmares… that's where it lived," he gasped, his voice sounding farther away now, as if he was huddled in the corner of the room. "In my head. In my sleep. It was… contained. It could look out, through the window. It could leave for a little while. The open air… it gave it an escape. A way to dissipate."

Another slam against the door, harder this time. The wood groaned. I backed away, my hand flying to my mouth.

"You closed it," he whispered, his voice trembling with a terror that was beyond human. "You locked it in. You sealed the room. Now it has nowhere to go. It was in my head, but now… now it wants out."

I heard a dry, splintering crack from inside. Not the door. Something else. It sounded like bone. My brother let out a thin, reedy whimper that was abruptly cut off.

And then, silence.

A deep, heavy, absolute silence that was worse than the screaming.

"Hey?" I whispered, my voice a pathetic squeak. "Are you okay?"

No answer.

I stood there in the dark hallway for what felt like an eternity, my ear pressed against the cold wood of his door. The house was silent. The house was warm.

Then I heard the scratching.

It was on the other side of the door this time. Right there, and it wasn't the sound of my brother's fingernails, but a slow, deliberate. A deep, gouging scrape, like something hard and sharp was being dragged down the wood, leaving a furrow behind. Scraaaaaape. Pause. Scraaaaaape.

I stumbled backwards, my legs like water. I ran into my room and slammed the door, fumbling with the lock. My hands were shaking so hard it took me three tries. I shoved my desk chair under the knob.

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. I babbled something about a break-in, a home invasion, my brother screaming. The dispatcher’s calm, professional voice was an anchor in a swirling sea of madness. She told me to stay on the line, to stay in a secure room.

The scratching on his door stopped.

I held my breath, listening. The silence stretched. Maybe it was over. Maybe he’d passed out. Maybe I was having a psychotic break.

Then the scratching started on *my* door.

It’s right there. Right now, as I’m typing this with trembling fingers. It is methodical. Patient. It’s testing the door, finding the seams. Scraaaaaape. Scraaaaape. It’s lower down than a person would scratch. Near the floor.

The scratching has stopped again. I can hear a soft, wet, sliding sound. Something is pressing against the bottom of the door. The gap is small, maybe half an inch.

Oh god.

I can see it.

From the thin crack of darkness beneath my door, a finger is sliding into my room. It’s pale grey, the color of dead flesh or old birch bark. It's too long. Far, far too long. The knuckle is bent at an impossible angle to fit through the gap. It’s thin, unnaturally so, like a stretched-out piece of taffy. Another one is coming through now, alongside the first. They are twitching, questing, feeling the carpet. They are followed by another. And another. They don’t look like fingers anymore. They look like the legs of some colorless insect.

They're moving so slowly. Deliberately, then the tips of these… things started tapping, gently, on the inside of my door.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

I hear sirens in the distance. They're so far away and I think the tall thin man wants me now.
