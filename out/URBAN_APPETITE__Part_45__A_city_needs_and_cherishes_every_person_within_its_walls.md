I came to on my knees, the world fading in around me, hands tied behind my back. I heard a groaning nearby I could recognize as belonging to Travis. I had a pounding headache courtesy of the beatdown given to us by the city’s municipal waste handlers. I’d like to say Travis and I put up a good fight, but… no, we lasted seconds at most. Outnumbered, after everything we’d been through up against people who looked fresh and ready for anything, it wasn’t much of a contest.

We found ourselves in a crowd of men, women and children who looked like they had fared similarly to us, Roger and Vivi not among them. Everyone was tied and bruised and looked like they had been put through the wringer. There was probably a couple dozen survivors in the center of a plaza, and when I looked around I could see the historic town hall looming above and a familiar face looking down at the captured innocents with his small squadron of armed city workers surrounding us, weapons at the ready.

“That’s the last of them, mayor!” said one of the workers. Judging his uniform logo, he worked water. “Everyone else has already been claimed by the city.”

“How many people got out of the city?” asked the mayor, looking over the crowd of tired, sobbing people as he wrung his hands. Was he sweating? “We need as few people to escape as possible. Every last body counts.”

“Main roads out fell in almost immediately,” said the worker. “I think the city took care of escapees for us, and those it didn’t our contacts in Jefferson City will keep quiet.” The worker spared a glance up and I saw yet another camera, this one nestled on a nearby streetlight. “We secured the riverside almost immediately, and most citizens went to the planned locations. It all worked like a charm, sir.”

“Good,” said the mayor, eyes darting around. “Good, good. Then this is the last.”

“Mayor!” cried out Travis, staring at the man in his worn, wrinkled suit. “Why are you doing this? Please!”

“Isn’t it obvious?” I asked him. “Your mayor knew all along and sold you out.”

“I need to hear it from him!” he cried out. “We voted for him, supported him! He owes us an explanation before he has us murdered!” He looked me in the face, and out of the corner of my eye I could see a sharp-looking rock or bit of concrete in his hands, working at the rope that had him bound.

“I do owe you all that,” said the mayor, looking out over the crowd. “You all should rejoice, though! This city has provided so much to so many. It’s given you, and your parents, your parents’ parents and so on for two hundred years a home, a place to live, to thrive. You should be honored that you’re finally able to give back.” He wrung his hands as he looked over the crowd. “For the past several years the city has been talking to us, preparing us for its planned tithe. It told us about how it built the first sections of your home, giving all it could to grow and grow and take more people under its care, and all it wants in return is this harvest.”

“We didn’t need this!” said Travis. “Not at this price!”

“Yet you all didn’t object to taking it,” said the mayor. “Now… It’s time. Don’t worry, though; while you all will go on to contribute yourselves to the greater good of the city, it has spoken to me and promised that your loyal civil servants will be spared. We’ll make sure the city can rebuild, work with the state to bring people back in, and return this metropolis to the utopia it was. This isn’t the first time this has had to be covered up, after all.”

“So the city can eat people all over again and not even leave us with graves?” growled Travis.

“An acceptable sacrifice for the betterment of the numerous generations that will live in the city up until then,” said the mayor. His eyes darted around again, and he looked at the same camera the water worker had. “I’m afraid now it’s not my place to speak anymore.” He bowed his head to the people before him. “Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.”

I’M STILL HUNGRY.

The ground caved in right underneath the mayor, making the municipal workers near him dart back in shock, their guns and weapons falling to the ground. “What the hell!” One cried out before the cobblestone street beneath him parted and he fell in as well. The mayor clung to the road around him, eyes wide as the plaza collapsed in on itself, the holes throughout grabbing the city’s former servants while a large pit opened up in the center, pulling the innocents into a dark abyss reeking like the others.

Travis darted to his feet, bonds broken, and helped me up before dragging me away from the expanding hole, a widening gullet gulping down people as thoughtlessly as a whale gulping down krill. These esophagi of road and pipes opened everywhere, leaving no path for us but up the steps toward the historic town hall, a plain stone building used for nothing but a small little museum in favor of a more modern operation for the mayor and his assistants. All of whom found themselves serving their city with their last breaths.

The mayor cried out to us as we darted past him, us dodging around another hole opening up that swallowed a waste worker. “Please!” he begged. “This wasn’t supposed to happen! It promised me it would spare some of us if we helped it!”

“And you trusted it like we trusted you,” said Travis, turning away and leading me on. I followed after, the mayor letting out a final plead before losing his grip and joining his citizens.

No path for us but the path forward, we hurled ourselves up the steps of city hall, busting through the wooden doors and into the open space inside. The exhibits and stands that comprised the museum still remained, filling the space along the walls, separated only by the occasional glass window overlooking the river flowing a couple dozen feet below. But the walls of the city hall, the ceilings, even parts of the floor, much of the wood and stone had fallen away like a snake shedding its skin, revealing pulsating flesh mixed with old metal pipes and insulated wires, starting separate but growing closer and closer until they reached the back of the chamber, where two hundred years ago a raised stage had held a mayor speaking to his people for the first time.

And on that stage stood… I couldn’t call it a man or a woman. It looked human, but almost as if someone had taken every single person alive and created the perfect average across all of them. It wore broken bits of stone, wood, bone, concrete and more like a second skin, the pieces shuffling about and rearranging themselves on its androgynous body. The face looked like a person that might have been called beautiful if not for it just being… off. Like someone trying to recreate a face and getting the details TOO right, resulting in something that cannot and should not exist. Its short hair didn’t move as it should, staying in the same position no matter how it turned.

It looked at us. “I’m still hungry,” it said, in the same voice that had been plaguing our minds throughout the entire night.

“How many people have you murdered this night?” growled Travis. He handed me the strip of stone he had been using, and I worked away at my rope as I walked by his side. We moved closer to the thing, sidestepping the sections of floor where the inner workings of the city had been exposed. I kept pace, staying close, keeping an eye on the nearby windows as we passed by them. As if this thing would even give us a chance to escape before it killed us.

“Many but not nearly enough,” it said with the casual dismissal of someone pondering a snack after dinner. “Still reaching those in non-municipal construction. All still in the buildings I made have been claimed. Except two.”

“Then why don’t you?” asked Travis. I freed my hands and let the rope fall to the ground, still clinging to the stone like it was anything resembling a useful weapon. The rope landed on a section of exposed flesh, where it sank in like someone slurping up a noodle. “What’s even the purpose of this form?”

“You respond best to a physical presence,” it said in that cold, empty cadence. Almost like an old text-to-voice reader. As we got closer, I saw that the city’s mouth made only the slightest efforts to sync to its dialogue, flapping up and down like a puppet. “The mayor didn’t listen to me until I appeared like this.” Yet it was putting on this show for us? Why was it wasting time with this spectacle when it could just eat us like it did everyone else?

“And you thanked him for listening to you by eating him,” said Travis. He kept walking toward it, and around us I could hear shuffling, squirming, almost slithering. Countless loose wires dangled from the ceiling, barely supported but still staying high. “What are you?”

The city thought for a moment. “I’ve made and discarded many shells,” it said. “Most names forgotten.few you might have heard. And now…” It gestured to everything around it. “Put down the gun and you won’t have to suffer.”

Our eyes bulged, and a second later Travis pulled out the pistol he had been hiding within his coat, doing his best to obscure it with his arm. He pointed it at the city. “Of course you knew I had it,” he said. “That’s why you haven’t killed us yet, isn’t it? We’re actually a danger to you?”

“Put down the gun, Travis,” said the city. “It’ll be okay. I don’t prolong the suffering. If you continue to resist…” It looked at me. “I don’t know you.”

“I don’t live here,” I said.

“Keep him out of this,” said Travis. “Or we’ll find out why you’re so afraid of this little pea shooter.”

While he had been so focused on the city, I had seen exactly why. Below the city’s stone-clad feet, part of the wall supporting the stage had chipped away. All the wires, the veins and arteries, the pipes, they all came together below the stage… and from within the cracks I saw a pulsating, gray, wrinkled wall of flesh.

“Travis,” I whispered. “Below it.”

His eyes fell below, and he saw what I had. The city reacted before either of us could, the wires falling down toward us. I froze up, but Travis didn’t waste a millisecond. He shoulder-barged into me with all the force he could muster, sending me tumbling to the side and through the window. I barely had any time to process the sight of him turning to the city, the wires from the roof closing in on him like the tentacles of an octopus, wrapping around his limbs and his neck.

Just before I hit the cold water below me I heard the shots echo out from within. I can’t remember how long it was before I finally washed up onshore.
