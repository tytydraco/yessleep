The first call came in at 1:18 AM.

I remember the time exactly because I had just checked the clock, hoping my shift was closer to ending. It wasn’t. There were still hours to go. The office was eerily silent, the kind of quiet that made you hyper-aware of every little sound—every breath, every rustle of fabric, every tiny creak of the old office chairs. The only steady noises were the low, constant hum of the fluorescent lights above, the occasional creak of my chair as I shifted, and the faint clicking of my keyboard as I absentmindedly typed.

Then, the phone rang.

The sudden, shrill sound jolted me. My monitor’s glow cast a pale reflection on the caller ID.

UNKNOWN CALLER. 

I sighed, rubbing the tiredness from my eyes, already expecting nonsense. 

Probably some drunk dialer, or worse, a prank call. These late-night shifts at this call center were notorious for them. People thought it was funny to mess with the night crew, especially when they knew we were stuck here until dawn.

I adjusted my headset, cleared my throat and pressed the answer button. "Thank you for calling us. How can I assist you?"

Silence.

But not complete silence, though. There was something. A presence on the line. I could hear them breathing—slow, deliberate, controlled. The kind of breathing that wasn’t casual but measured.

I frowned. “Hello?”

More breathing. No words.

I glanced at the screen. The call timer was still running. Someone was there. Someone who wasn’t speaking. Someone was on the line, Only listening.

“Uh… if you can hear me, I think you might have a bad connection.” I said.

Then, A faint sound crackled through the headset. But it wasn’t static. It wasn’t words either.  It wasn’t background noise. It was something else entirely.

It was a breath, deep and ragged, shuddering.

And then… something wet. A horrible, gurgling noise, like someone trying to suck in air through shredded lungs. 

The kind of sound a person makes when they’re choking on their own blood.

That made my stomach tighten with instinctual dread.

And then—The line went dead.

A shiver ran down my spine, but I shook my head, forcing a small laugh. "Nice try, buddy," I muttered under my breath, rolling my shoulders to shake off the unease.

Probably some kid trying to mess with the night crew. Teenagers did that sometimes, called in just to creep people out.

I had no idea I had just broken a rule.

A few minutes later, I stretched, rubbing my eyes. 

The hours between midnight and morning always messed with my head. The world outside was black and empty, and in here, under the artificial glow of computer screens, time felt like it wasn’t moving at all. 

The office was eerily empty—The rows of empty desks around me didn’t help. Everyone else was either on break or working remotely, leaving me in a ghost town of softly humming monitors.

Then, the lights flickered.

Once. A sharp buzz. Then again.

I blinked and looked up at the ceiling. "Huh."

The fluorescent tubes overhead shuddered, casting strange, jagged shadows across the walls before settling again.

I smirked, shaking my head. “Guess maintenance forgot to change the bulbs.”

The flickering stopped. The office was still, again. I sighed and turned back to my screen, trying to refocus.

But something felt… off.

I couldn’t put my finger on it, but the air felt heavier, thicker, as if the room itself had inhaled and was holding its breath.

The words felt hollow even as I spoke them. Something about the flickering had been... off. Not random, like a loose wire, but controlled. Deliberate. Like someone had been testing it.

I brushed it off. Just fatigue. Just the mind playing tricks after too many late nights in an empty office.

I didn’t take it seriously. I should have. I should have paid attention.

I should have recognized the warning.

I should have done something about it.

I should have left right then and there.

But I didn’t.

And now—I’ve seen something I was never supposed to see.

I settled back into my routine.

At 1:30 AM, I was at my desk, almost getting bored and sleepy.

The glow of the screen made my eyes heavy, the monotony of the shift wearing me down. I had just leaned back in my chair, stretching my arms behind my head, when—I heard my name.

A whisper. Soft. Right behind me.

“Mark…”

My breath caught in my throat. Every hair on my body stood on end. The voice had been so close, like someone was leaning right next to my ear. I spun around so fast my chair nearly tipped over. 

Nothing.

Just empty desks. Silent computers. The dim glow of the EXIT sign flickering slightly in the distance.

I swallowed hard, my pulse pounding in my ears.

It must’ve been my imagination. A trick of exhaustion. That had to be it. Maybe I had dozed off for a second, and my mind had twisted a random sound into something else.

Or maybe… the security guard? Playing a joke? But that didn’t make sense. The voice had been so close. Right behind me.

I took a deep breath, forcing my hands to steady. "Get it together, Mark."

I shook off the unease and turned back to my desk.

Then, it came again.

“Mark… why won’t you look at me?”

My stomach clenched painfully.

It wasn’t just a whisper this time. It was familiar.

It was my sister’s voice.

My blood ran cold. That was impossible.

She had been dead for eight years.

A chill wrapped around me, like the air itself had thickened. Then, I felt it—breath on my ear.

A cold, slow exhale.

My body locked up, every muscle frozen in terror. I couldn't move.

I knew, without a doubt, that something was right there.

And then, pure instinct took over.

I bolted from my chair, nearly tripping over my own feet as I sprinted across the office. I didn’t stop until I reached the break room, slamming the door behind me, my chest rising and falling with ragged, panicked gasps.

For a few seconds, I just stood there, my back pressed against the door, trying to convince myself I wasn’t losing my mind.

Then, my eyes landed on something new. Something that hadn’t been there before.

A paper. Taped to the fridge.

The word at the top stood out in thick, bold letters:

RULES.

My hands trembled as I ripped it from the fridge.

The paper felt brittle under my fingers, like it had been there far longer than it should have. The ink was slightly smudged, the letters uneven in some places, as if written by a shaking hand. The edges were yellowed, curling inward as if the paper itself was trying to hide what was written on it. A thick knot formed in my stomach before I even read the first line.

Rule #1. If a call comes in with no sound, do not speak first. Wait until they hang up.

A chill ran down my spine. My grip on the paper tightened. I had spoken first.

I forced my eyes downward, scanning the next rule.

Rule #2. If the lights flicker, put your head down and count to ten. Do not look up until it stops. If the lights flicker after 2:50 AM, follow Rule Number 8.

I swallowed hard. I hadn't counted. I had looked right at them.

My breath came faster now, my fingers feeling damp as I kept reading.

Rule #3. If you hear someone whisper your name, do not respond. Even if they sound familiar.

My vision blurred. I had responded. Twice.

A drop of sweat slid down my temple. My hands shook as I struggled to hold the paper steady. I forced myself to keep going. Maybe—just maybe—I could still get through the night.

Rule #4. Every night at exactly 2:13 AM, place your headset on the desk and close your eyes for one full minute.

Rule #5. If you hear typing from an empty cubicle, do not acknowledge it. Do not investigate.

Rule #6. Never, under any circumstances, look at the security cameras between 3:33 AM and 3:35 AM.

Rule #7. If you see someone standing at the far end of the office, do not react. Do not interact.

Rule #8. If you see someone or something weird trying to get closer to you or sitting beside you, do NOT react. Do not react at all.

My fingers gripped the paper so tightly it crumpled slightly.

My body went completely numb.

At the very bottom of the page, something else was written in bold, larger than the rest of the text. A special warning.

If you break a rule once, it will escalate. If you break a rule twice, you won’t make it to your next shift.

I felt lightheaded. I had broken three.

I had no room for a second mistake.

With shaky fingers, I pulled my phone from my pocket. My hands were slick with sweat, but I managed to set two alarms. One for 2:13 AM, one for 3:33 AM. I didn’t know what would happen at those times, but I wasn’t taking chances.

Then, something else hit me—something stupid, maybe even irrational, but it made my skin prickle all the same.

There were eight rules.

Eight.

That number had always been unlucky for me.

I remembered being eight years old when my childhood dog ran away. I had needed eight stitches after slipping on ice in high school. The last digits of my ex-girlfriend’s phone number? All eights—she had cheated on me with my best friend, whose birthday, of course, was August 8th.

Eight had followed me my whole life, and not once had it ever brought me anything good.

Now, here it was again.

Eight rules.

Eight ways to die.

I took a deep breath, shaking off the paranoia. I had to be rational. I had to finish this shift. If I let my own mind spiral, I’d make even more mistakes, and I couldn’t afford that.

Suddenly—Right outside the break room door.—The unmistakable noise of a chair dragging across the floor came.

The sound was slow, deliberate, like someone was dragging it across the floor just to let me know they were there.

My stomach twisted. My mouth went dry.

Something was waiting.

And it wasn’t going to let me leave.

I forced myself to breathe. *Think, Mark. Think.*

The break room had only one exit—back into the office. There was no back door, no window I could squeeze through. I was trapped.

I needed to get out. But if I opened the door… What if it was right there?

I pressed my ear against the wood, heart hammering so hard I could hear it in my skull. Silence. No footsteps, no breathing, no scraping.

Maybe it was gone.

Maybe it was waiting.

I counted to three. One. Two. Three. Then, before I could talk myself out of it, I grabbed the handle and yanked the door open.

The office was empty.

Or so I thought.

I stepped out cautiously, my heart hammering, my hands clenched into fists. Something felt… wrong.

A deep, primal instinct clawed at my chest, screaming at me before my brain could process why. My skin prickled, my breath hitched.

I was being watched.

The air grew thick, dense, as if I was suddenly wading through something heavy and unseen. The space around me felt different—not just cold, but wrong, like it had been tainted by something unnatural.

Then, I saw it.

At the far end of the room, tucked in the shadows where the dim overhead lights barely reached, something stood.

Tall. Silent. Watching.

A shape too tall, too motionless. 

My stomach lurched. My mouth went dry. My fingers curled into fists at my sides.

Rule #7.

*"If you see someone standing at the far end of the office, do not react. Do not interact."*

I wanted to run. My muscles coiled, every instinct screaming at me to bolt for the exit. But I didn’t move.

I didn’t even blink.

I forced myself to stay still, every nerve in my body vibrating with terror.

The longer I stared, the heavier the air became, pressing against my skin, as if the entire room was shrinking, suffocating. My lungs burned from holding my breath, but I didn’t dare inhale.

Then, after what felt like an eternity—

It moved.

A single step forward.

My knees nearly buckled.

Another step.

And another.

It was coming for me.

I stared, vision shaking with terror, my entire body locked in place. I could see it clearer now—its limbs were wrong. Too long. Too sharp. It swayed slightly as it walked, like a puppet on tangled strings.

I could feel my body screaming to run. Run for the exit. Run anywhere. Get away, to do anything but stand there frozen, staring at something that shouldn’t exist.

My phone vibrated violently in my pocket, the sound slicing through the thick silence.

2:13 AM.

The alarm.

I had one job.

Completely ignoring the thing that was coming for me, I committed to following the rule.

I didn’t hesitate. My hands moved on their own, yanking the headset off and slamming it onto the desk and closed my eyes for One full minute.

The moment my vision went dark, the office around me changed.

I could feel it.

The air shifted. The hum of the computers vanished. The world became unnaturally quiet—like I had stepped into a place where sound had no meaning.

At Exactly, 2:14 AM, I opened my eyes. 

As soon as I opened my eyes—The lights flickered.

A quick, sharp buzz. Then again.

I squeezed my eyes shut again and counted.

*"One… two… three…"*

The room fell into absolute silence.

*"Four… five… six…"*

The air changed. 

It wasn’t just thick anymore—it was heavy. It pressed against me, like something was standing inches from my face. I could feel its presence.

*"Seven… eight… nine…"*

A breath ghosted over my cheek. Hot. Wet. Wrong.

I clenched my fists, nails digging into my palms.

*"TEN."*

I opened my eyes.

The office was empty.

The figure at the far end of the room? Gone.

The heavy, suffocating air? Gone.

Everything looked normal again.

Except—

My headset was missing.

And my computer screen—

It had a new message.

The words glowed stark against the black background.

YOU FOLLOWED THE RULES. BUT THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH.

A cold dread settled in my gut.

This wasn’t over.

Not even close.

I barely had time to process the weird message before I heard it.

Click-clack. Click-clack.

Fingers tapping against a keyboard. Fast. Frantic. Like someone typing in a rush, slamming their fingers down with a kind of desperate urgency.

I froze.

The sound wasn’t coming from my desk.

It was coming from somewhere else.

I slowly turned my head, scanning the rows of cubicles ahead of me. Empty.

But the typing continued.

My stomach twisted. No. No no no. I knew this. I knew this rule.

Rule #5: *If you hear typing from an empty cubicle, do not acknowledge it. Do not investigate.*

I willed myself to ignore it. To pretend I heard nothing. But it was so loud.

Click-clack-click-clack-click—

Then—

SLAM.

The keyboard rattled violently. The clicking turned into a chaotic banging, as if someone—or something—was smashing the keys with their fists.

A chair creaked. Slowly, deliberately, it rolled back from the desk.

The screen was still on.

The keyboard was still moving.

Except…

No one was there.

Keys pressed down on their own.

One letter at a time.

M

A

R

K

My lungs burned. I stopped breathing.

It knew my name.

I did not move.

I did not breathe.

The keys kept pressing even as my hands curled into fists.

Then—

The keyboard launched off the desk, smashing into the monitor with a sickening crack. Keys rained onto the floor, scattering like broken teeth.

I snapped my gaze away.

I kept looking away. I kept staring at my own screen.

The sounds dragged on, long enough that my body started to shake.

I didn't blink. I didn't react. I didn't even flinch when the last key clattered onto the linoleum.

Then—

Silence.

I waited. Counted in my head. Ten seconds. Twenty.

Still silence.

My shoulders slumped as the tension in my muscles started to loosen.

I leaned back in the chair, exhaustion settling in.

My head tilted back, almost automatically, just to ease the tension in my neck.

But I swear—I swear—

Something inside me—something deep and instinctual—told me *not to look up*\*.\*

But I had already looked up.

And I wasn’t alone.

Something was pressed against the ceiling.

A body, A shape, its back flattened against the tiles, arms and legs splayed like a dead spider.

My chest seized.

Its head snapped toward me.

I couldn’t even scream.

A blinding flash seared through my vision.

I flinched, my breath catching—

And when my eyes adjusted...

It was gone.

I stood there, my whole body locked in place, heart hammering so violently I thought it might burst. The room was normal again. Empty.

But then—

Drip.

Something wet landed on my shoulder.

Drip.

Thick. Warm. Sticky.

I reached up with trembling fingers.

My skin came away red.

My stomach turned.

Was it… blood?

My throat clenched around the rising scream. I swallowed it down, biting hard on the inside of my cheek.

Somewhere deep inside me, I knew.

I had made a mistake.

I was trying to steady my breathing.

The office was silent except for my own pulse pounding in my ears. My hands clenched the armrests of my chair, knuckles white. I needed to calm down. I needed to—

The lights flickered again.

Not a quick buzz. Not the usual faulty bulb.

A rhythm.

Like the office itself was breathing.

My stomach twisted. I glanced at the clock on my screen.

2:53 AM.

I scrambled to remember— what was Rule #2 again?

*"If the lights flicker after 2:50 AM, follow Rule Number 8."*

Then it hit me.

A feeling. A presence.

A weight pressing on my chest. Heavy. Crushing.

The unmistakable sensation of being watched.

I could feel it. Close. Too close.

The air grew thick, suffocating. My stomach twisted, nausea clawing its way up my throat.

I forced myself to stare at my screen, fingers digging into my thighs to keep them from shaking.

Don’t look. Don’t react.

I knew the rule.

I knew if I looked, I was dead.

But then—

Something moved.

Not beside me.

Not in front of me.

In the reflection of my monitor.

A shape.

Long limbs shifting in the dark, moving with an unnatural slowness, just outside the glow of my screen.

It was coming closer.

I felt the chair beneath me tremble. The desk creaked slightly as if something—someone—was pressing against it.

The rules said not to react. Not to look away.

But it was coming closer.

And then—

It knelt beside me.

Close. Too close.

Close enough that I could hear it breathing.

Close enough to touch.

A clicking sound, low and sharp, came from its throat.

It didn’t move.

It just waited.

I felt it then—something cold, sharp, barely there. Like the tip of a blade tracing along my jawline.

I clenched my hands under the desk.

I didn’t move.

I didn’t react.

I didn’t flinch.

I forced my breathing to stay even, my eyes locked on the screen in front of me.

Then—

The pressure disappeared.

I kept staring forward.

Seconds stretched into eternity.

The weight lifted.

The air around me shifted.

And eventually—

It left.

I tried to shake it off. Tried to focus.

I glued my eyes to my monitor, pretending I wasn’t seconds away from bolting out of the building. 

Then—

Buzz. Buzz.

My phone jolted violently in my pocket.

3:33 AM.

My fingers clenched around the fabric of my shirt.

I knew what this meant.

I wasn’t supposed to look at the security cameras.

Not between 3:33 and 3:35 AM.

I set my hands firmly in my lap. I wasn’t going to do it.

But, I felt that unnatural pull.

It wasn’t curiosity. It wasn’t fear. It was something else. Like invisible hands gripping my head, slowly turning me toward the monitors.

I fought it.

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes so hard they ached.

*"Don’t look. Don’t look. Don’t look."*

I repeated it like a prayer, like a lifeline.

But then—

I felt movement.

Not from the screens.

From the office.

I could sense it—the space around me was wrong.

The cubicles had shifted.

The hallway seemed longer.

Darker.

And then, from the corner of my eye—

Something stood up.

Not a person.

A shape.

Black. Jagged.

Like a puppet made of broken bones.

My body went cold.

It shouldn’t have been able to stand.

Its limbs bent in the wrong directions.

Its head lolled uselessly to the side.

I shut my eyes. Tight.

I didn’t care if I looked insane.

I prayed.

A minute passed.

Then another.

Or maybe an hour. I didn’t know.

When I finally opened my eyes—

The office was normal again.

The desks were back in place. The hallway was the right length.

But something was still here.

I heard it.

A faint, shifting rustle.

Not far away.

Not in another cubicle.

Under my desk.

My breath hitched.

A whisper of dry fingers against the tile.

Scraping. Pausing.

Waiting.

No sooner had I caught my breath—

The phone rang again.

Shrill. Sharp.

The screen glowed in the dim light.

UNKNOWN CALLER.

I didn’t answer.

I knew better now.

But the voice came through anyway.

A low, gravelly sound—like someone scraping a blade against stone.

"You broke the rules, Mark."

My breath caught in my throat.

The lights flickered.

I didn’t mean to look. I didn’t.

But my head snapped up.

And this time—

There was no ceiling.

Just a void.

Black. Endless. Hungry.

The office wasn’t there anymore.

Only emptiness.

And then—

I fell.

I woke up in my car.

The first thing I saw was the clock on the dashboard.

7:00 AM.

I stared at it, my mind sluggish, my body heavy—like I had been running for hours.

Or fighting.

Or dying.

I had no memory of leaving the office.

No memory of getting into my car.

But my uniform—

Soaked.

Like I had been sweating.

Or worse.

I swallowed, my throat dry and sore. My hands trembled as I reached for the door handle.

I needed air. I needed to see.

I stumbled out, legs weak, shaking.

I turned back to the building—

But there was nothing there.

Just an empty lot.

No doors. No windows.

Like it had never been there.

Like none of it had ever existed.

A shiver ran down my spine. I pulled out my phone, frantic.

No call history.

No work emails.

Nothing.

Like I had never worked there.

Like it had erased itself from my life.

But then—

I saw it.

Sitting on my dashboard.

My old headset.

I stared at it, dread curling in my stomach.

And beside it—

A note.

Scrawled in jagged, uneven letters.

"SEE YOU TONIGHT."
