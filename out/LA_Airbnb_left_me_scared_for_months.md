I read a lot of these, and thank you all for sharing your stories. I thought maybe I should share one I have.

This was back in June 2019. I (19F at the time) went to visit my best friend, we'll call her Kelly, at her college UCSC. A few of our hometown friends tagged along, and we stayed at her apartment for a day until our bigger trip down to LA. Us and her college friends rented a minivan and drove 6 hours down to West Hollywood. There were 7 total of us girls, and it was all going really well. Going to Malibu Beach, breakfast at the Belvedere Hotel, hiking to the Hollywood sign. Our first 2 nights were joyful, as well as our last until late in the night.

Before I go on, I'd like to give some description to the Airbnb. It was in a sketchy area, there was a shed (we weren't supposed to go in) in the backyard among overgrown plants, there was a high chainlink fencing surrounding the property, and you had to enter a padlock code at the driveway to get the key. It was one story, 3 bedrooms. There was a glass window front porch and that's where we'd hang out a lot and smoke weed (lol). The back porch was similar, but more beaten down. We kept both doors locked at all times and the driveway gate as well. I have the exact address (found it by street view on google maps), but I won't release that now.

Our last night, Saturday, we were hanging out on the front porch. What was so weird and a foreshadow we didn't see, is that while on the porch, we heard the padlock and chain jingling around down at the gate. There was all brush, so we couldn't see, but I remember we all retreated inside for a little bit, until we worked up the courage to go back out and finish the joint.

A bunch of us went to bed early figuring we had to be up early to drive back to SC. Some of them still needed to study for finals. I remember smoking and then heading to bed around 11:30PM. My other friend, we'll call her Gabby, was the last to go to bed around 1:30AM. Except for Kelly, she stayed awake talking to her crush on FaceTime.

I was sleeping for a while, until I was woken up by one of the girls in a frantic state. She was pleading with me to come out to the living room, that they think there is "something" in the house. I was honestly pissed at first, that they couldn't figure it out themselves and that they woke me up. I didn't know yet the desperation of the situation. I walked out into the living room and everyone was there except one other, who was sleeping. From the living room, you can't see the kitchen and that's also where the bathroom is. I sat on the couch and they all, simultaneously, were trying to tell me what was going on in whispers. Again, I was annoyed, so I said, "If you really think there's something going on, why don't you call the cops!!?" and then all of them told me to SHHH and I shut up.

It was for 5 seconds that I was quiet. And I heard movement in the kitchen. Almost like putting something in the sink or moving cups around? My heart dropped and I jumped off that couch so fast, in a manner I will never forget. I gathered all of the girls into one bedroom, went to wake up the last (she was so annoyed at me waking her up, I had to be a bit mean to get her the fuck up), and we took safety to the other bedroom. We put a chair under the door, me and another girl stood by it just listening and guarding. At this point we're a mix of fear pacing, crying, not being able to breathe, and going nonverbal. I was trembling. Kelly was on the phone with the cops.

Me and the other door guarder were talking about what happened. She said Kelly was still on FaceTime and started hearing things going on in the bathroom. Like drawers opening and our cosmetics being moved around. This was around 3:00AM. Kelly didn't remember me going to bed, and thought it was me, so she called out my name twice. This woke Gabby up, and Gabby came out asking what was going on. This caused the other girls to come out and check it out. I remember one of the girls told me she heard spoons rattling and her voice was shaking.

They thought it could be an animal, so they went by the open kitchen doorway and banged a water bottle against the frame and yelled, to scare it off. But obviously, that did nothing. That's when they came and woke me.

At this point, the cops are taking long of course and all girls are feeling different, wild emotions. There was a huge window in the bedroom and I just remember feeling so terrified that they'd climb in through there. The other door guard looked at me and whispered, "Wait, put your ear and listen,". I heard footsteps. I wanted to scream, cry, throw up. I whispered that we weren't going to share this at that particular moment.

The cops come, but they are not allowed to enter without us letting them in. This causes another huge problem and Kelly is fighting with the dispatcher on the phone. I'm asking if they could just come to the window, that we don't want to go out there. Eventually, the other door guard gains the courage and goes out to let the cops in.

Welp. I have had many experiences with cops, I live on a bad block, and this one I will remember. They were two females, you'd think they understand our fear. Not in the slightest. They said they "searched the home and saw nothing". They didn't ask questions, they weren't curious, they just wanted to leave. They kept glancing to the weed on the table! As if inferring it was all because we were high! Mind you, some of us weren't smokers and those of us who were, it was at 11PM! Weed has never affected me nor anyone I know like *this* before. We ask them if they searched the backyard, that there was a run down shed back there, and they were hesitant to do that for us. YALL DIDN'T SEARCH THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE?

They leave. And Kelly looks at us and goes, "I don't know about y'all, but there is no way I am sleeping here tonight and I want to leave right now," and we all immediately agreed. It was probably around 4:00AM at this point. We pack up our stuff and leave for a 6 hour drive to SC. During the drive, the sun rises, I text my parents, and Kelly is messaging the Airbnb host. When the host woke up, she was never helpful, and I honestly don't know much development on that.

We were in CA for 2 more days. I remember Gabby and I just hung out at the beach while the girls studied and took their finals, but it all felt so weird. It was the only thing we could *think* about, *talk* about. At one point, Kelly broke down crying because she was holding her strength for so long, trying to be the dominant one. It was so sad to watch and we all just group hugged her. It didn't feel real and our brains were just trying to come up with an explanation. Trying to piece it all together and make sense of it.

On the long ride back to SC, one of the girls was saying maybe it was something supernatural? That seems like such a far reach, regardless of how big a fan of ghosts I am. The most sensible explanation is that a homeless person broke in and enjoyed going through girls' belongings. Our noises and yells didn't scare them off because they were probably high. So often, I think, what if we just went into the kitchen? But if there was someone there, what the fuck would we have done? And then what if it was nothing? Just empty space?

This event took up my life for a while. I was so strict on all of the windows and doors being locked at night back at home. Checking 3 times. I was pleading with my dad to get a new, updated alarm system. I put a bat under my bed. Honestly, all of the stuff we, sadly, should already be doing. But that fear, the inability to fall asleep for months, I don't want that ever again.

Thank you for reading. I don't know who or what was in that house, but this experience caused me to buy and always bring my portable door lock to Airbnbs with me.
