I'm no stranger to sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations since I've been having them for quite some time ever since I was a child. Almost every night for the past few weeks, right as I fall asleep, I see someone sitting on the chair by my desk.

It's an unfamiliar man who I'd say looks like he's in his mid 30s. He's got shabby hair, wears a long sleeved round-neck shirt and a pair of dirty trousers. He's got a very forgettable look. I say this because I've seen much worse in my nightmares.

He often watches me, mumbles stuff under his breath, and acts like he's tired just sitting at the same place waiting for something interesting to happen.

It's always vivid, and there's been several instances where I mistook him for an actual person in my room. Of course, he's not real - because he just disappears into thin air whenever I get slightly more conscious or aware of what's happening.

In my more recent encounters with him, he'd say the most random things -

*"You keep waking up too fast."*  
*"I won't hurt you. Not at all."*  
*"Hold still if they scratch."*  
*"Just don't resist, please."*

None of his mutterings make sense. The best I can do is ignore him. In fact, I ask him to keep quiet.. and he does happen to obey.

While most of what I've been sharing with you here sounds typical in sleep paralysis and similar dreaming states - his behaviour has been getting quite uncannily human recently.

The recent encounters have become more silent and I don't hear him saying anything decipherable. Not that I want to, but because it's not typical of my experience with this entity.

Now like I said, whenever I'd wake up fully - the room would be empty. It was easy to dismiss this as some sort of harmless yet disturbing state of sleep.

About a week ago, I woke up in the middle of the night because something was biting me. Not a single bite - like dozens of bites. I flipped on my lamp and saw a cluster of those tiny black ants all over my sheets.

I brushed them off, killed quite a few - and checked everywhere for crumbs or spills, but I could find nothing. My bed was clean.

I woke up in the middle of the night to strip the sheets, vaccum, and spray peppermint to ensure they won't be back soon. I even taped the legs of my bed with Vaseline to trap any climbers.

The next few nights, the same thing happened. The bites came in straight little lines down my calves and forearms like a dotted path. I didn't notice that pattern until later.

The next morning, I called an exterminator. They checked my house, the walls, the vents - nothing. There was no nest, nor was there a food source.

Here's what messed me up - the ants only appeared when I was asleep. When I stayed awake for half a night, not a single ant crawled out... until an hour after I gave up and slept.

I told myself the ants and the man must be connected. Maybe some sort of dream feedback loop? Maybe the bites were real, but my brain was filling in the rest.

Two nights ago, the man returned. He spoke more clearly than ever as he sat nonchalantly by my desk. I remember because I knew I was awake when I heard him. I had just drifted off when he said, *"Don't open your eyes yet."*

I remember thinking how that was a weird dream sentence. He continued, his voice deeper than usual, *"Just let them finish you this time."*

My skin crawled. I forced myself fully awake. My heart was pounding. I opened my eyes - and he vanished. As usual.

But the door to my closet was slightly open. I never leave it open. I hate it when they're open at night. It's a superstition from my childhood and a rule I still follow.

I flipped the lights on and drew enough courage to investigate the closet. There was nothing out of place in it. I slammed its door shut and tried to sleep again once I killed the lights.

Tonight is why I'm writing this.

I woke up to the feeling of ants crawling in my mouth. Not near my mouth - in it. I gagged and spit them out, scrambling to turn on the lamp, thrashing wildly.

I felt them all over me, hundreds of them stinging along my ribs and down my thighs, even clingling on the skin below my eyes. I couldn't control the pain.

But as soon as I sat upright, the ants began moving, not away - not scattering like normal insects. They crawled in a perfect line off my body and across the bed.

I froze. I watched them form a thin black trail that led directly to the closet door... which was open.

It wasn't a crack this time. It was wide. And there was someone sitting inside.

The man. His legs were folded neatly, knees up to his chest, hands resting on top. His posture was unnaturally stiff - too straight and like he was balancing something on his head.

His eyes... I can't explain it right. They just didn't blink. They didn't gaze. They vibrated - twitching in the wrong way. They shined like idle wells of water in the dim light.

He wasn't looking at me. He was following the ants. The trail led right to his feet and into his trousers. I was fully awake and I knew it.

There was no dream fog, no drifting, and no paralysis. The bites, scratches, rashes and unbearable itching ringed my entire body - I felt numb.

He was still there. He lifted his head, just a little. The tiniest movement like a dying animatronic. In his quiet, almost bored voice, he said, *"You woke up too early... again."*

Without a second thought, I sprang off my bed and ran, hoping for this nightmare to end - for the man to disappear like he always did.

I bolted out of the room as I grabbed my phone. I sprinted across the living room toward the slider door to get outside and that's when I noticed the glass.

It wasn't just cracked, it was shattered - outward, as if someone had broken it and slipped inside from across the yard.

There were footprints in the dirt outside, bare ones - a long pair.. leading towards the inside.

For a second I just stood there, staring at those tracks in the dirt, my breath fogging. I don't know why - but the thought hit me all at once.

I had ran right past whoever had broken in.

I'm standing in the cold outside... in my backyard right now. I can still see my bedroom window from here.

*The closet light just turned on.*

I'm calling for help.
