I stood there, panting, the remnants of my shredded clothing clinging to my massive frame. The orcs had released me, stepping back with wide eyes and uncertain grips on their weapons. I could see their fear, smell it
—a sharp, acrid scent that made something primal stir in my chest.

I looked down at my hands—or what had once been my hands. They were monstrous now, clawed and powerful, dripping with mud and blood.

My reflection flickered in a puddle at my feet, distorted but unmistakable. A werewolf.
I wasn't human anymore.

The realization hit me like a thunderclap, but there was no time to process it. One of the orcs roared, raising his axe, but I moved before he could even swing.

I lunged, my claws tearing through his armor like paper, the force of the blow sending him sprawling. Another or charged, but I turned on him, my teeth bared in a snarl.

The world around me dissolved into chaos, my senses overwhelmed by the sharp tang of blood, the deafening clash of steel, and the animalistic fury coursing through my veins.

I wasn't in control. Not fully. But I didn't care.
All that mattered was the fight-the need to protect, to destroy, to end this madness.

The world around me dissolved into chaos, my senses overwhelmed by the sharp tang of blood, the deafening clash of steel, and the animalistic fury coursing through my veins.

I wasn't in control. Not fully. But I didn't care.
All that mattered was the fight-the need to protect, to destroy, to end this madness.

Through the haze, I saw Gregory and Tianna, their faces stunned but alive. I saw Skibidi, his smug grin replaced by wide-eyed panic as he stumbled backward, his tiny form dwarfed by the chaos around him.

And for the first time, I felt hope. Twisted, horrifying hope.

I wasn't sure what l'd become, but I was sure of one thing: this world wasn't going to win.

Everything went black.

When I woke, the first thing I became aware of was the sound of crackling fire. Its faint light flickered against the jagged walls of a cave, casting long, uneven shadows. My body ached as if I’d been torn apart and hastily sewn back together. Every muscle screamed with exhaustion and pain.

I tried to sit up, but a sharp, burning ache in my chest stopped me. My hands—human again, trembling—pressed into the damp ground as I steadied myself.

“Don’t,” Gregory’s voice cut through the quiet, his tone low and clipped.

I turned my head toward him, still groggy and disoriented. He was crouched beside Tianna, who leaned against the wall, her arm wrapped in bloodied bandages. She was pale, her breathing shallow, but her eyes flicked toward me with something hard to define—resentment, pain, and exhaustion all rolled into one.

“What… happened?” I managed, my voice hoarse and cracked.

Gregory stood slowly, his movements deliberate, and fixed me with a stare that sent a chill through my chest. “You happened, Glenn.”

The weight of his words hit me, but I couldn’t process them.

“What do you mean?” I asked, my voice weak and trembling.

Tianna spoke this time, her voice cold and sharp. “You turned. You lost control. You became a monster.”

Fragments of memory began clawing their way back—searing pain, the snap of bones, the overwhelming fury. I could still feel the echo of it, the raw, animalistic rage that had consumed me.

“The orcs?” I asked, grasping for clarity.

“Dead,” Gregory said bluntly. “You tore through them like they were nothing. Didn’t leave a single one standing.”

A brief flicker of relief coursed through me, but it was short-lived.

“It wasn’t just them,” Gregory continued, his voice laced with anger.

I froze. “What do you mean?”

“You didn’t stop,” Tianna said bitterly, her bandaged arm trembling as she gestured toward herself. “You hit me. You were out of control, lashing out at everything and everyone. I tried to pull you back, but you—” She stopped, her jaw tightening.

I stared at her, my stomach twisting. “I… I didn’t mean to.”

“Of course you didn’t,” Gregory snapped, stepping closer. “But that didn’t stop you, did it?”

The weight of their words pressed down on me, but another question burned in the back of my mind.

“What about Maple?” I asked, my voice barely audible.

Gregory’s expression darkened, his jaw tightening. Tianna looked away, her lips pressing into a thin line.

“They killed her,” Gregory said finally, his voice heavy. “The orcs dragged her off when they realized you were out of control. By the time we got to her…” He paused, his fists clenching. “She was gone.”

The words tore through me like a blade.

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head. “No, I was supposed to save her. That’s why I—”

“You didn’t save her,” Gregory interrupted, his tone sharp. “You killed the orcs, sure. But she’s dead, Glenn. She’s dead because we couldn’t stop them. Because we couldn’t stop you.”

My breath hitched, and I felt bile rise in my throat. Maple’s face flashed in my mind—her warmth, her smile, her touch. The way she’d reached out to me, made me feel less alone.

And now she was gone.

“And Skibidi?” I asked, forcing the words out.

Gregory’s gaze hardened. “You killed him too. He tried to run, but you caught him before he could get far. Didn’t even stand a chance.”

I stared at him, the full weight of what he was saying crashing down on me.

“I didn’t mean to,” I said again, my voice breaking.

“No, you didn’t,” Gregory said, his voice ice-cold. “But that doesn’t change what happened. You lost control, Glenn. You let whatever that was take over, and people died.”

Tianna shifted slightly, her expression softer but no less firm. “We wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you. The orcs would’ve dragged us all to Naamah, and we’d be worse than dead. But that doesn’t make what you did any less horrifying.”

I stared at the fire, the flickering flames doing little to chase away the cold knot in my chest. I had saved them—Gregory, Tianna, myself—but at what cost? Maple was gone, Skibidi was dead, and I’d hurt the very people I was trying to protect.

“What am I supposed to do now?” I asked quietly, my voice hollow.

Gregory’s gaze didn’t waver. “You’d better figure that out, Glenn. Because this?” He gestured to me, his expression unflinching. “This can’t happen again.”

As the fire crackled and Tianna leaned back against the wall, I felt the weight of my actions settle over me like a shroud.

I didn’t know what I was anymore.

As I sat by the fire, staring into the dancing flames, the pieces of the puzzle began to click into place. Slowly, painfully, the events of the last few hours replayed in my mind, and I couldn’t shake a single thought: I made this happen.

It wasn’t just the rage, the desperation, or even the circumstances. It was the belief—the absolute conviction I had felt in that moment. The thought had burned in my mind like a brand: I can stop them. I have to stop them.

And the world had listened.

The memory of Skibidi’s smugness came back to me then, his confidence, his arrogance. Gregory’s words echoed in my ears: Was Skibidi only a warlord because he believed he was?

This world—this twisted, unreal place—justified itself. It bent to belief, to perception, twisting reality to match what you thought was true. Skibidi hadn’t been a warlord in the real world. He was a kid, a brash and reckless child. But here? Here, he believed he was, so he became one.

And I? I had believed, with every ounce of desperation, that I could stop the orcs. That I could save everyone.

The price was steep.

“I think I understand what happened,” I said, my voice quiet but steady.

Gregory and Tianna looked up, their expressions wary.

“This place… it’s not like the real world,” I continued. “It’s not fixed. It’s fluid. It adapts to us, to what we believe. That’s how Skibidi became a warlord. He wasn’t one before, but he thought he could be. He believed it, so the world made it true.”

Tianna frowned, her brow furrowed. “And you’re saying… you did the same thing?”

I nodded. “When the orcs had us tied up, I kept thinking about how helpless we were. About how I couldn’t let it end like that. And then I thought… if Skibidi could believe something and make it happen, why couldn’t I? So I focused. I told myself I could stop them. That I had to stop them.”

“And the world responded,” Gregory said, his tone grim.

“Yes,” I said, my voice trembling. “But it didn’t happen the way I expected. I didn’t just stop them—I became something else. A monster. Because that’s what it took to make it real.”

The silence stretched, the crackle of the fire the only sound in the cave.

“We’ve been trying,” Tianna said after a moment, her voice careful. “To reshape things. To bend this world to our will. But it never works.”

“Why not?” I asked.

“Because we can’t actually make ourselves believe it,” Gregory said, his voice sharp. “Not really. We tell ourselves it’s possible, but deep down, we don’t buy it. We’ve been here too long. We’ve seen too much. The doubt is always there, buried in the back of our minds.”

I thought about that, about the way my transformation had felt. It hadn’t been a conscious effort, not really. It wasn’t like flipping a switch. It had been instinctual, raw, born of desperation and need.

“Maybe that’s why it worked for me,” I said. “I wasn’t trying to trick myself into believing. I just… did. In that moment, I didn’t have time to doubt. I didn’t question it. I knew I could stop them, and the world made it true.”

Gregory’s jaw tightened, his eyes narrowing. “But at what cost? You lost control, Glenn. You became something you couldn’t contain. That’s the danger of this place—it twists what you want into something else entirely.”

I nodded, the weight of his words settling over me. “I know. And I don’t know if I can control it. But if this place works the way I think it does… maybe there’s a way to use it. A way to turn it against itself.”

Tianna leaned forward slightly, her gaze intense. “You mean… escape.”

I hesitated, the thought of Maple’s lifeless face flashing in my mind. “If we can find a way to truly believe it, to know we can leave, then maybe the world will let us go.”

Gregory’s expression darkened. “That’s easier said than done. You can’t fake belief, Glenn. It has to be real. And after everything we’ve been through… do you really think any of us can believe that escape is possible?”

I didn’t have an answer.

The fire crackled, its light flickering against the cave walls, and I stared into it, my thoughts churning. The cost of my belief had been high, and I wasn’t sure if I could risk paying it again.

But the alternative—staying here, trapped in this nightmare—was unthinkable.

As we prepared to leave the cave, the question escaped my lips before I could stop myself. “What happens when you die here?”

The words hung in the air, and for a moment, no one answered.

Tianna tightened her bandage with a grimace, her expression unreadable. Gregory adjusted his pack, his movements methodical, but neither of them met my gaze.

Finally, Tianna spoke, her voice low. “We don’t know.”

I frowned. “You don’t know? You’ve been here longer than I have. You’ve seen people die, haven’t you?”

She glanced at Gregory, who shook his head slightly. “We’ve seen people disappear,” she clarified. “When they die, their bodies vanish. No blood, no trace, no nothing. Like they’re erased. Where they go? If they go anywhere? We don’t know.”

Gregory nodded, his jaw tight. “No one who dies here has ever come back. At least, not that we’ve seen.”

The weight of her words settled over me like a shroud. The idea of death was terrifying enough, but here? Where even reality bent and twisted in ways I didn’t understand? The thought chilled me to my core.

“Then we keep moving,” Gregory said firmly, snapping me out of my thoughts. “No point dwelling on it.”

We left the cave as the morning mist clung to the forest around us. The world was unnervingly beautiful—soft sunlight filtered through the canopy, dappling the ground with shifting patterns of light and shadow. The air was cool and fresh, carrying the faint scent of damp earth and pine.

But I couldn’t enjoy it. My thoughts kept drifting back to Maple.

Her face, her voice, the warmth of her touch. I couldn’t stop replaying the moments we’d shared, the way she’d made me feel seen, understood.

“She’s not real, you know,” Tianna said abruptly, breaking the silence.

I turned to her, frowning. “What?”

“Maple,” she said, her tone sharper now. “She wasn’t real. None of them are. The NPCs? They’re just reflections, mirrors of what this place thinks we want.”

I shook my head, my gut twisting. “You don’t know that.”

“Yes, I do,” she snapped, stopping in her tracks to face me. “You felt it, didn’t you? Deep down, you knew she wasn’t real. You just didn’t want to believe it.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but the words caught in my throat.

“Come here,” Tianna said suddenly, walking toward the sound of a nearby stream.

A woman stood by the water’s edge, fishing with a simple pole. She looked serene, her movements calm and practiced. Tianna approached her, and I followed reluctantly, unsure of what she was doing.

Tianna leaned in, speaking softly to the woman. “He’s lonely,” she said, nodding toward me.

The woman turned, her face brightening as she set her pole down and made her way over to me.

“Hello,” she said, her voice soft and warm. “You seem like you could use some company.”

At first, I was struck by how different she looked from Maple—her face, her hair, even the way she carried herself. But then, as she spoke, I felt the same pull, the same sense of comfort and understanding. She laughed at just the right moments, her voice carried the same gentle cadence, and her gaze was filled with that same knowing warmth.

I felt my stomach twist.

Tianna crossed her arms, watching my reaction. “See it now?” she asked, her voice cutting.

The realization hit me like a punch to the chest. This woman wasn’t Maple, but she was. The way she acted, the way she spoke—it was all the same.

“They’re not people, Glenn,” Tianna said, her tone firm. “They’re not even trying to be. They’re just mirrors. They give you what you think you need, but there’s nothing behind it. No soul, no life. Just reflections.”

I knew she was right. I had known it from the beginning. But I hadn’t wanted to see it.

The woman touched my arm gently, her smile kind. “Is there something I can do for you?”

I stepped back, pulling away, the hollow ache in my chest growing. “No,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “No, thank you.”

She tilted her head slightly, her smile never wavering, and returned to the stream without a word.

Tianna turned to me, her expression softening slightly. “I get it. It’s easier to believe they’re real. But they’re not. And the sooner you accept that, the better.”

I nodded slowly, the weight of her words settling over me like a stone. I had wanted so desperately to believe in Maple, to believe that connection had been real.

But here, in this place, nothing was what it seemed.

As we walked away from the stream, I couldn’t keep the question from spilling out. “So Henry,” I said, glancing at Tianna, “he just… gave into it all? He built a life here, a family, and just accepted it? How does that even happen when you know this place isn’t real?”

Tianna sighed, her gaze fixed on the path ahead. “It’s not that simple, Glenn. Henry wasn’t stupid. He knew. He always knew.”

“Then why?” I pressed. “Why go along with it? Why build a family, a house, and call it a life when none of it was real?”

She hesitated for a moment before speaking, her voice softer now. “Because sometimes the illusion is easier than the truth. For Henry, it wasn’t about what was real. It was about what felt real. The life he built here? It was better than the one he left behind. And if the difference between ‘real’ and ‘fake’ is just the way you feel, then… what does it matter?”

I frowned, trying to wrap my head around it. “But he knew it wasn’t real. How could he live with that?”

Tianna stopped walking and turned to face me, her expression serious. “Let me ask you something, Glenn. If you’d never been told that this place wasn’t real—if no one ever explained the NPCs, the rules, the mirrors—would you have questioned it? Or would you have just accepted Maple for who she seemed to be?”

Her words hit like a slap to the face. I didn’t answer, because I knew the truth.

She nodded at my silence. “That’s what happened to Henry. At first, he fought it, just like we all do. He tried to escape, tried to believe there was a way out. But after enough time… he stopped fighting. He told himself that this place was his new reality, and he let it happen. He made it work for him.”

I thought back to Henry’s face during dinner, his confidence in the world he’d built. The way he spoke about his family, his home. It had all seemed so genuine.

“But his family,” I said, my voice quieter now. “A’Rhea, the kids… they were just mirrors, weren’t they?”

Tianna’s expression softened. “Yes. They were. But to Henry, they were real enough. He chose to believe in them because it was easier than facing the alternative.”

I swallowed hard, the weight of her words settling over me. “And you think that’s what I should do?”

“No,” she said firmly, meeting my gaze. “Henry made his choice, and it worked for him. But you’re not Henry. You’re still fighting, Glenn. You haven’t given up yet. Don’t let this place take that from you.”

The conviction in her voice struck a chord in me, and for the first time since waking in this world, I felt a flicker of something I couldn’t quite name.

Not hope. Not yet. But something close.

We resumed walking, the sound of the stream fading into the background. And though the question still lingered in my mind, I couldn’t bring myself to ask it aloud:

If this place made it so easy to give in… how much longer could I keep fighting?

The air grew heavier as we walked, the light filtering through the canopy dimming unnaturally as though the sun itself were retreating. The forest was eerily quiet, the usual rustling of leaves and distant chirping of birds replaced by an oppressive silence that pressed against my ears.

Gregory led the way, his eyes darting between the trees, his hand resting on the hilt of his blade. Tianna walked beside me, her injured arm cradled close to her chest, her gaze scanning the shadows with the same nervous energy.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. The forest felt alive—not in the natural, vibrant way that nature usually does, but in a sinister, watchful way, like it was waiting for something.

“I don’t like this,” Tianna muttered, her voice barely audible over the crunch of our boots on the dirt path.

“Neither do I,” Gregory replied, his tone clipped. “Stay sharp.”

The path ahead narrowed, hemmed in by thick, gnarled trees whose roots snaked across the ground like skeletal fingers. The further we went, the darker it got, the forest seeming to close in around us.

Then I heard it.

A faint sound, just on the edge of perception, like the hum of a distant melody. It was soft at first, barely more than a whisper carried on the breeze, but it grew louder with each step.

“Do you hear that?” I asked, my voice hushed.

Gregory nodded, his jaw tight. “Stay close.”

The hum became a tune—delicate, almost hypnotic, like a lullaby played on an instrument I couldn’t quite identify. It seemed to echo from everywhere and nowhere all at once, pulling at the edges of my mind.

As we continued, the trees began to change. Their bark, once rough and natural, now glistened as if slick with moisture. Dark, pulsating veins ran along their surfaces, glowing faintly with an unnatural, sickly light.

“Glenn…” Tianna’s voice trembled as she grabbed my arm.

I followed her gaze to a tree just ahead of us. At first, I didn’t understand what I was looking at. Its trunk bulged in odd places, the surface warped and uneven. Then I saw it—a face.

No, not a face. The twisted impression of a face, its features warped and frozen in a silent scream.

I staggered back, my breath catching in my throat. The face wasn’t carved or painted—it was part of the tree, its surface stretched and contorted like something trying to break free from within.

And then the humming stopped.

The silence that followed was deafening, a void that seemed to swallow all sound. The air grew colder, the oppressive weight pressing down harder than before.

“Keep moving,” Gregory hissed, his voice barely above a whisper.

We picked up the pace, the path winding deeper into the twisted forest. The trees around us were alive with grotesque shapes—faces, hands, even whole bodies, their forms fused with the wood, their features frozen in expressions of agony.

“What the hell is this?” I whispered, my voice shaking.

“It’s the system,” Tianna said through gritted teeth. “This place… it’s breaking.”

A sudden noise shattered the silence—a loud, wet crack that echoed through the forest. We all froze, our eyes darting toward the source.

One of the trees ahead split open, its trunk tearing apart like flesh. From the opening came a low, guttural sound, like a deep exhale laced with a growl. Something moved inside, its shape obscured by the darkness within.

“We need to go,” Gregory said, his voice urgent.

But before we could take another step, the humming returned. Louder this time, more insistent, the melody twisting into a discordant wail that set my teeth on edge.

Then the thing in the tree stepped out.

It was tall, impossibly so, its body a writhing mass of bark and tendrils that moved unnaturally, as though it wasn’t bound by the laws of physics. Its face—or what should have been a face—was featureless, smooth and blank like polished wood.

And it was watching us.

I didn’t know how I knew, but I could feel its gaze, cold and unrelenting, piercing into me like a dagger.

“Run,” Gregory said, his voice barely audible.

None of us argued.

We turned and bolted down the path, the creature’s wailing hum rising behind us, chasing us through the twisted forest. The ground beneath my feet felt unstable, the roots of the trees writhing like living things, trying to trip me as I ran.

Branches lashed at my face, the air thick with the stench of rot and decay. My heart hammered in my chest, the adrenaline pushing me forward even as my legs screamed in protest.

The humming grew louder, the sound burrowing into my mind, filling my thoughts with chaos. I glanced back and saw it moving toward us, its tendrils stretching unnaturally, pulling it forward in jerking, erratic motions.

“Faster!” Gregory shouted, his voice barely audible over the cacophony.

The path ahead opened up into a clearing, and we burst through the trees, stumbling into the open space. The humming stopped abruptly, the silence more deafening than the noise had been.

I turned, expecting the creature to follow, but the forest behind us was still. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their grotesque forms watching but unmoving.

“What the hell was that?” I gasped, doubling over to catch my breath.

Gregory didn’t answer, his eyes fixed on the tree line. Tianna leaned against a rock, clutching her injured arm, her face pale and drawn.

None of us spoke. The silence was too heavy, the weight of what we’d seen pressing down on all of us.

We sat in that clearing for what felt like an eternity, the oppressive silence weighing on us like a shroud. The faint whispers started softly, so low at first that I thought they were my imagination.

"Feed me in blood."

The words repeated, soft but insistent, growing louder and more guttural with each iteration.

"Feed me in blood."

My skin crawled as the whispering seemed to come from everywhere at once, circling us like a predator. Gregory, Tianna, and I exchanged uneasy glances, none of us daring to speak.
And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the whispering stopped.

The silence that followed was absolute.
Gregory was the first to move. He stood slowly, his face pale and drawn, his eyes fixed on me with a grim determination.

"Sorry, Glenn," he said, his voice flat and hollow.

"What?" I began, but before I could say another word, he drew his sword.

For a split second, I thought he was going to kill me outright. But instead, he raised the hilt and brought it down with brutal force on my knee.
The impact was devastating.

I had been sitting back against a rock, my knees bent and my feet tucked beneath me.
The blow landed with a sickening crunch, the sound echoing in my ears as the pain exploded through my body. It was sharp and immediate, a searing agony that made my stomach lurch.

Everything here feels real, even though I know it's not. And let me tell you, the pain was as real as anything l'd ever felt.

I screamed, the sound raw and broken, my hands instinctively going to my shattered knee. The world spun as nausea and shock fought for dominance, but what cut through the haze more than anything was the betrayal.

"Why?" I gasped, my voice trembling with a mix of pain and disbelief.

Gregory didn't answer. His jaw was set, his expression hard as he grabbed me by the shoulders, yanking me forward.

Tianna stepped closer, her face filled with sorrow, but she didn't stop him. "I'm sorry," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The two of them hauled me roughly over the rock, my injured knee screaming in protest as it dragged against the rough surface. I tried to fight, but the pain left me weak and disoriented.

"Don't do this," I begged, my voice cracking.
Tianna looked at me one last time, her expression haunted. 

"We don't have a choice," she said.

Then they ran.
