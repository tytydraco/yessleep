I work at G block at El Paso state prison, about 15 miles north-east of El Paso. G block is death row. I can remember my first execution when I was just starting out. A guy found guilty of 4 counts of murder had been sentenced to death by lethal injection. Doctors don’t perform the execution because that would violate the oath they all took, so the job falls on us. With lethal injection it's usually pretty quiet.

 I’ve never had an execution go wrong on my watch, however I've heard horror stories from people about executions going horribly wrong. G block had 14 total cells, 7 on each side. We never had more than 10 filled at one time. Every one of the inmates were just horrible people. The worst of the worst. Murderers, rapists, arsonists, terrorists, etcetera. Every single person here deserved to die in my eyes.

 All the inmates spend 23 hours a day locked inside their 10 foot by 6 foot by 8 foot windowless concrete cells, say for the one hour a day they get to go into a slightly large concrete pit with a metal grate on the top. The whole block is specially designed so nobody knows where they are in the prison at any given time. It was around 1997, sometime in june. It was swelteringly hot out, but because this was a state prison it was underfunded. This meant no air conditioning. We did feel slightly bad for the inmates I suppose, seeing as how us guards were also suffering. So we brought in 6 big box fans to help combat the heat.

 Technically we weren't supposed to, but the warden never complained. The new inmate was supposed to arrive that day, and we had spent all day yesterday getting his cell ready. Finally the inmate arrived, and right away the guy creeped me out. He was short and stubby, not taller than 5’5. He had short black hair and some freshly shaved stubble.

“He’s all yours,” the guard who escorted him in. Now, I wanted to stay as far away from this guy as possible. Just looking at him gave me goosebumps. He gave off a real creepy feeling. 
“My name is Mr. Wright, these men standing across from me are Mr. Rawlins and Mr. Aldin.” said Sam Wright, the junior officer we had. He seemed utterly unaffected by him. Myself and the other guys all towered over this man, whom I later learned was named Silas. We led him into the cell, instructing him to lay his hands through the small opening in the cell door. 

I had the honors of unlocking his handcuffs. His skin felt strange, it was oily and leathery and cold. He never said a word. We left him alone, and pretty much nothing happened for the rest of the day. Usually nothing exciting ever happens. Myself and Sam had the honors of having the night shift that night however, which always sucked. Around 10:00 the other guys clocked out, leaving just me and him. We stayed up most of the night, watching movies on the small TV in the breakroom. 

“I gotta take a leak, can you hold down the fort?” Sam told me, standing up. 
I nodded. He left out the door, down the hall, and to the left. He left the door open, and behind it lay the dark expanse of the cell block. The cells lined each side of the corridor, creating an eerie feeling. Like I was being watched. I shook it off, turning back to the TV.

“Mr Aldin,” a soft voice spoke from down in the hallway. It sent an icy shiver down my spine. Goosebumps once again crawled all over me. The voice was soft spoken, and if the circumstances were any different I might have found it soothing. 

“Mr Aldin, come to me,” the voice said. Now I'll admit, I was terrified. And I knew exactly who the inmate was, to.  I stood up, adjusted my tie, and put on my gruff voice.

“The hell’s going on down here,” I said in my best “scary man” voice. 

“I want to tell you something. Something beautiful.” Silas said. 

I was relatively creeped out by this. I don't know, I guess the way he talked? It made me uneasy.

“What is it?”

“The whispers in the dark. Can you hear them? Hear what they say?”


I was taken aback by this. I'm not sure what I expected him to say, but it sure wasn't this.

“I got news for you buddy, you ain’t no better than anyone else in this joint.”

The solid steel door kept me from seeing him. That was both a good and a bad thing.

“You cannot delay the inevitable, Mr. Aldin.” he said in that soft whisper.

“Huh?”

“I knew a man like you, down in south texas. He tried to delay the inevitable. He thought he could escape his undoing. I did the world justice.”

I was panting now. This guy stressed me out. And where the hell was Sam at?

“W-what did you do to him?”

“I did him justice. I can promise you Mr Aldin, he did not suffer greatly. The man was guilty of infidelity toward his beautiful wife.”

“You're crazy, Silas.” I said. “I'll be glad to see you go.”

“Death holds no dominion over me.”

“The hell are you even talking about now?” I asked him. I was sweating now.

“Open the viewport, Aldin. Let me see you.”

This was not protocol. But it was like he was holding me with strings, puppeting me. I unlocked the small rectangle viewport, and slid it open. I was greeted by Silasas eyes. They were a sickly yellow.

“The man’s death? It was a revelation.”

I swallowed sharpley. Around the the dark corridor seemed to get longer. I was getting dizzy. 

“Let me feel you, Aldin. Let me have that.” he said. “When the night unfolds into true horror, you will understand. You will see.”

I panted heavily.

“Who was the man you killed?” I asked him in a shaky voice.

Silas shuffled around in its cell, searching for something. Finally he seemed to find it. He pressed something against the viewport. A set of eyes looked back at me, but not his. I recognized them. It was Sam’s eyes. Silas had his head in his cell.

All I  could do was babble on incoherently. What the hell was I supposed to do?

“Listen to me”

“W-what do you want?”

“Just listen” he said.

Nope. I left then. I ran away, out the door, and into my car, and I drove home. I called the police. They told me that they never found anything in Silas’s cell. However, they never located where Sam was. He is still missing to this day. Every night, when I close my eyes, I can see his eyes. They watch me. I feel like he still holds, like a spell or something over me. I quit my job soon after that, and never looked back. There are some messed up people out there, that's for sure. As far as I'm concerned Silas was executed in 2012. I can only hope he’s gone for good.
