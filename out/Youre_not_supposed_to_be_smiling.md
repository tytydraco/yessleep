I tap my legs furiously against the floor, my mind flashing images from the report I just read. The files dance under the fan on my desk. I shut them close. I was going to look at them again, but I needed some prep time. My hands trembled ever so slightly as I took a tentative sip of my now, cold coffee.

My superiors had temporarily declassified files related to the June 19th Berlin incident. I guess the idea was to prepare me for what was to come and I needed all the info I could get my hands on. I set the documents on my desk when my phone rang, breaking the sombre silence in my small office.

“Yeah ma? No nothing dangerous, just government stuff”

I take another look at the case files.

“Keep takin’ those medicines on time okay? I don’t wanna hear no complainin’. No ma I already told you I’m not callin’ him. Alright see ya.”

One call every Sunday. That’s all I was allowed. “Just government stuff”

Yeah right.

I set my coffee down and prepare myself to go over all the documents again. Instruction manual first, I guess.

At least this job paid a fortune. 6 months and I’m out, I remind myself. 6 months… the length of that time period was finally beginning to set in. With a nervous sigh, I open the case files again.

The headline from the local newspaper was attached to the corner. “28 junkies dead in local brothel”. Then I looked at the crime scene photos again. 28 bodies in various states of decay. They looked like skeletons with skin like paper stretched thin over them. Arms so skinny you could probably hold five of them in one palm. You’d think it was the drugs that killed ‘em if not for one thing. Their faces. I didn’t want to look at the closeups again. Their wide eyes, their open mouths staring at something that was just there, it was too much. How they managed to capture whatever caused this was beyond me. 

I set the files aside. *I need to focus on the task at hand*. Starting today, 6 months, 180 odd days. Doable? Maybe.

I grab my coffee and jolt mid-sip as the buzzer rings. 

“BZZZZZZT”

Here goes nothing. I swipe my access card at the lift. 27 is already lit. I tuck my shirt, straighten my badge. 

*DING*

First stop: the pantry. My footsteps echo too loud or maybe the floor was too quiet. *Was it supposed to be this quiet?* I hear the squeaking of my shoes on the floor get louder. 

“Breathe.” I remind myself, I feel my pace slow down, just barely. I swipe my access card at the pantry. 

“Uh… 2709” I mutter to the server. 

He wordlessly hands me a tray with plain rice and no garnish on it. We briefly make eye contact. *Is that pity? I’m definitely projecting.* 2709 is just ahead, squeaks getting louder again. I don’t care, I want to get this over with. 

I take a deep breath and find myself in front of a large metal door. There’s a card reader to the left of it. I swipe my access card. I hear it groan as it swings inward. 

The harsh white tube lights buzz as I step inside. The keys jingle in my pocket. The door closes behind me. It’s a plain white room with... *Huh?* I see a woman tied to a chair. *Don’t look.* I quickly direct my gaze downward. ‘The entity’ huh. The chains around the woman are thick and press into her skin. She shifts uncomfortably. *Is this the right room?* I glance back.

2709. 

She’s looking directly at me, I can feel it. 

“What are you waiting for?”, her head tilts to one side, a playful smile on her lips. *Doesn;t sound German to me.*

“Hey I’m hungry come on” 

“S-sorry”. 

*Shit.*

*You spoke.* 

*You fucking spoke.* 

I walk towards the metal table in front of her and quietly place her food there. There’s a spoon on the rice, not that she can use it, her wrists are tied behind her back, her legs are tied together. 

“You checkin me out sweetheart?”, she purrs. I shift my gaze to the floor. 

*Don’t engage.*

*Don’t engage.*

Just wait until someone else comes in, back to the wall. I feel a drop of sweat on my temple.

“They’re feedin’ me like the fucking dogs over here”, she chuckles, her laughter is so sweet. “Real gourmet stuff, Thank you Chef”, she shouts into the air. She sounds like…. someone I know. *No. Impossible.* I keep my eyes locked on to the floor, I’m not even here. I’m on a beach in Hawaii.

“They give you the same stuff too, new guy?”. She bends over and eats directly from the plate. 

I got two coconuts in my hands, shades on my face, life's good.

“Mmm fuckin’ five stars”, she says sarcastically. I feel bad for her. Am I breaking protocol by feeling bad? I remind myself of the crime scene photos again. 

*Their corpses.*

*Their skin.*

*Their eyes.*

*Focus.*

“Hey, newbie” I see her mouth curve into a smile again. 

“Come on I won’t bite”, I hear her chains clatter violently as she moves her limbs in demonstration. I flinch. “See? I’m in fuckin’ chains. You scared of a girl in chains?”

Sunsets, beaches, tropical babes. *This is the high life baby.*

“Bet you’re real straight huh? Never locked up like this, alone. No windows, no clocks, only sound’s the stupid fucking buzzin’ lights that never turn off? How do you think that feels?”, she pauses. I swear I know that voice, no, the tone.

I close my eyes and try to feel the warm sea breeze on my face. 

“Feels like it’s in your skull, that’s what it feels like”, she says softly. Must feel like shit.

The door opens. I breathe out. 4 men in hazmat suits walk in. *Why don’t I get a fucking hazmat suit?*

“Aww man, well see ya soon newbie”, she giggles. I’ve heard it, I swear. A long long time ago. On a playground. A memory I can’t place.

I fill out the report form. Section 5: Verbal Contact. I tick ‘No’. *I didn’t speak*. 

I close the door behind me. I feel the sweat pool all over my uniform as my legs turn to jelly. Swipe, swipe, swipe. I’m home. My legs give out. 

I collapse onto my chair, my breathing unsteady. I take a moment to calm myself. *Come on man you did it, just do it 179 more times and you’re set.* I laugh as I take off my uniform and step into the shower. The water seems to take all the stress away. My mind’s still in that room. “Get used to it champ”, I mutter as I clean myself. “It’s an easy job, easy money, real easy. Just don’t be stupid and you’re eatin’ good.” I dry my hair off and step outside. I change into a fresh set. *How’s ma doing?* 7 days till I find out she’s okay. Or not. No way to know. I make my way down the hall, the facility’s post office sits tucked away past the debrief rooms.

“21, how you doin’? How can I help ya?”, Jimmy asks with a smile. *Seems like the only guy with a personality in here.*

“Can you double check that address real quick? I’ll be outta your hair lickity split”

“It’s the 4th time, do I look that stupid?”, he chuckles. “Here check it yourself man.”

“Just makin’ sure”, I run my hands on the records until I find my ID. 

“Dependents, Address line 1, Line 2, Postal code”, I mutter. “Okay, checks out, I won’t ask again Jim.”

“What, you got a lady back home?”, he asks playfully.

“Just my ma.” I pause. “And uh… dependent 2 get approved yet?”

Jimmy’s smile fades a little, “You know how it is man. He's got a history you know, they're uh, they’re looking into it.” He straightens the stack of papers on his desk. “It’ll happen man, I'm tryin’ my best you know—”

“I know, I know and that means a lot, just keep me posted. Thanks again man” I leave quickly. 

“Don’t mention it”, I hear behind me. 

I eat my dinner quietly. Not a hint of spice. Cheap bastards. I put on a sitcom on the TV as I finish my bowl. The food, however bland, fills my stomach. The day’s events begin weighing on me as I slump deeper and deeper into my chair and before I know it, sleep lulls me into its warm embrace. 



\---------------



“BZZZZZZT”



I snap awake and stumble into a fresh uniform. Swipe, swipe, swipe and I’m standing in front of the metal door again. I let my breathing even out and repeat my mantra: *I’m not fucking up.* The sound of the large door opening fills the halls.

“Missed me sweetheart?”, *You’re a professional god damn it*. I wait for the door to close behind me. I feign nonchalance as I walk to the centre of the room. I set the tray on the table.

“Two weeks huh newbie? That's record time!”, she leans towards me, the large chains digging deeper and deeper into her flesh. The thought of those restraints sends a chill down my spine. “The other guy couldn’t last a day” I feel her eyes burning into me. *Are they glowing?* She laughs. “I’m joking newbie, where’s your sense of humour huh?” 

*Fucking hilarious.* I force my mind to wander into the mountains.

“You really believe them, don’t you?” she lowers her voice to a whisper. “Bet they showed you all those scary pictures.”, she giggles. “You really think I did that?”. 

*Could she have? Doesn’t matter, the sun’s coming up. I feel the cold air wash over my body.*

“The ol’ freakshow slideshow, real convincing. Don’t blink too hard baby you be their good little boy”, she laughs some more.

*The summits an hour away, final stretch come on. What was that documentary guy's dog called? Snow. Right. Snow’s here. Wagging his tail like always.*

I feel her giggles slide under my skin.

*Keep climbing. Cold wind. Distant screams.*

She sighs, “It’s okay newbie. Everyone needs me to be their boogieman. I don’t care about that. But you newbie, you’re always looking so serious.” She shifts in her chains. “Got a girl back home keepin you in check?”

*The breeze is getting colder, snow is barking incessantly.* 

“Siblings? Parents? Bet they're so proud of you huh newbie?”

*Snow’s still barking, Or laughing. She's laughing. It echoes in the mountains.*

“So how's your ma doin’?”

I snap out of it. 

I don't flinch. I keep my face straight. A single drop of sweat on my temple drops the facade.

“Is she doin’ okay newbie? Is she gettin’ calls from her big responsible boy?”, she laughs. *Mountains mountains mountains.*

“Bet she’s feelin’ lonely. Say newbie, did you tell her where you’re workin’? You’re not tellin’ me you lied to sweet ol’ mama did you?”, she makes an exaggerated pout. Her tone, her accent. Something about the lilt at the end of her words—

Daisy Peters. 

My first crush in middle school. Doodled her name all over my notebook. She used to laugh when I stuttered. I was always so shy. It never felt mean. It felt like a million butterflies.

*What the fuck is taking so long?* 

“You a liar, newbie? Been lyin’ to your ma? I mean they call me a monster but even for me that's fucked up.”, she cackles. *Time’s up, come on, what the hell is the hold up?*  “They ain’t comin’ for you this time”, she manages between her laughs.

The metal door opens. It’s loud and slow, but the sound is a welcome reprieve. The sense of relief fades away as I check the time. *10 minutes longer with this thing for what?* My breath feels hot as I fill the form. I wait outside the door. I see the 4 men step out. “Why’d it take so long for you guys to get me today?”, I try to sound polite. It sounds bitter. I ask again, louder. Their footsteps retreat from me, faces unreadable under their masks. *Chumps*. 

I storm to the post office. A lady greets me at the door. Her smile is warm, and fake.

“Hi sir, how can I help you?” 

“Where’s Jim, I wanna know the status of my second dependent”

“He isn’t in today, would you like me to make an inquiry on your behalf?”. Lies. She doesn’t drop her smile.

“Are you sure about that? I saw him today, I can just ask him myself” I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.

“It must’ve been someone else sir” she replies, her smile still unwavering, almost mocking. 

I stare at her, trying to read her expression. “I’ll just stand here till he’s back then. I got time.” I cross my arms. I know I saw him in the morning.

“He won’t be in for a while sir. Anything else I can help you with besides the inquiry?”

The adrenaline wears off, I see two guards approaching me from a distance. “No uh, never mind.” I mutter. The guards resume their positions.

I stand in one spot in my room. I'm trying to ease my breath. *Calm down*. It's getting even faster. I feel my heart pounding against its cage. Another envelope. 



**Psychological Evaluation Form Tier 2** 



*I already filled this last week and now this shit again? For what? For asking why those idiots couldn't do their job?*

I fill out the form, muttering under my breath. The sudden instinct to tear the stupid piece of paper overwhelms me. *It’s so flimsy and weak I could just— Get a fucking hold of yourself.* *One sam is enough for the family*. I put the form back in the envelope. My breathing eases. My mind is still a whirlwind of emotions. I fiddle with my shirt buttons and then take it off. I slip into pajamas.

As my anger subsides, tiredness settles in. I feel my heart still pounding. *So tired and it’s only 1pm*. *Should’ve gotten that gym membership for myself instead.* I close my eyes. *When would I even go? Between Ma’s appointments and work. If I just had some help… If he’d just try.* I feel myself drift into something older, something familiar.

The wallpaper is peeling off. The hall stinks of old socks and incense. I’m in front of a door. I knock twice.

“Come on don’t be like that, open up”, Ma’s standing next to me, arms crossed. She turns her neck towards the door and then back to me. 

I sigh, “Ma’s takin’ your side this time, you satisfied?”. I turn to Ma, her eyebrows are furrowed, she mouths, “Do better”

“I mean, I’m sorry.” I pause. “I’m never callin’ you a junkie again okay I promise”, I turn the handle, of course it’s locked. “I messed up man I just wish you’d fucking try sometimes. I’ll help you out, I’ll drive you to those meetings every single day of my life if I have to, I swear”, my heart’s beating fast, Ma’s face shifts from anger to concern. “Come on man don’t shut me out” my hands are trembling, I feel like I’m going to break the handle. Ma’s eyes widen, they're glowing. She's banging on the door. 

“Sam? Sam! Baby he didn’t mean it come on”

My throat tightens, I’ve broken the handle. Ma is still banging on the door. No. Wait. She’s giggling. I’m punching the door. I smell metal.

I don’t hear myself scream, just the itch in my throat.

The walls collapse. I’m enveloped in black. 

Then a blinding light. No it's tubelights, wooden desks. Mr. Rogers at the chalk board. 

I'm so cold. *Why am I so cold?* I try to move but Daisy’s next to me, twirling her hair like always. She turns to me and smiles.

“Hey newbie”



I jolt up. My t-shirt’s damp.

I place my palms on my face and wipe the sweat off.

“Stupid junkie.”

That’s what I called him back then. That’s what I was thinking even now.

I rub my eyes.

*Just a dream*. The details are getting fuzzier by the second. *It’s over*.

I see a flip phone placed on my desk, I didn’t even remember it was Sunday already. 

I grab it and I dial the only number I ever bothered to remember. My fingers won’t stop shaking. Just a dream.

I hear her voice come through.

“Hello?”

“Hey ma”, I try to keep my voice from shaking. I want to tell her everything. 

“How’s my baby holdin’ up, you had your lunch yet?”

“Just got back to my office ma, I-I’m starvin’.” they’re probably listening. 

“They feedin’ you good? They aint workin’ you too hard?”

“Yeah ma it’s like a fuckin’ buffet over here, got meals from all sorts of places”, I force a laugh. 

I hesitate. The words come before I can help it. “How’s-how’s Sam ma how's he doin’?”

She pauses,“He’s doin’ alright honey. Folks at rehab told me he's making real strides. They’re—”, I hear her choke up. She tries to hide it. “They’re saying he's finally gonna beat it this time. I–I uh”

“It’s okay ma, I’m just happy you guys are doing okay”

I sniffle away from the phone’s mic.

“Get him on the phone next time, and uh, tell him I miss him.”, I mute the phone as I feel more tears roll down my face. I let them come. “And you tell him I’m real proud”. 

There's silence between us. It’s not like the silence in the office. 

“I’ll make sure to tell him that baby. I love you. You're doin great honey. Don’t let these government idiots get you down okay?”

“Alright I got these files I gotta review right”, I wipe my eyes with the heels of my hands, “I’ll be going now. I love you too.” 

I hang up and lay on my bed. *No way but through champ.* I grab my apartment keys and head to the post office.

“I want my guitar from my apartment.” I drop off the flip phone and my keys.

“Alrighty sir, do you understand this reduces your allocated couriers to uh… 2?” 

“Yes I do, make it quick please”, I flash her a smile as I head back. No way I’m going to sit here and just rot. *I got shit to lose, I’m going all the way to the finish line.* I finish my dinner and set an alarm.



\---------------



“BZZZZZZT” 



I’m already up. I’ve been setting alarms to wake up way before the buzzer gets a chance to get me. My uniform hangs loose on my shoulders, I adjust it. 

I glance at my calendar on the way out. Sunday morning. Not that it matters. I haven’t spoken to ma in weeks.

I straighten my badge and head to the pantry. On the way I glance at my fingertips. My calluses are fading. I smile.

*You don't wanna talk to me random server guy? I don’t care.* I take the tray and step in front of the metal door. It looks much smaller now. I almost laugh as I swipe my access card. It beeps and turns green. I'm in. 

“Morning” 

“Morning newbie” she smiles, it’s warm and sweet.

“You hungry?”, I smile back, only time I feel like it these days.

“Starvin’” I set the tray down. “Thanks newbie. Did they approve Sam's dependent status yet?”

“Been chasing them for weeks at this point.” I take my usual spot on the wall. “I mean it’s my money, why do they care where the hell it goes? Bunch of morons in suits” 

She giggles “Oh come on newbie you think they’re checkin’ his background? You think they care? They couldn’t give a fuck about you.” She bends down and eats from her plate. 

“You sure they ain’t got wire taps in here?”, my eyes dart around the room.

“I saw them hook this whole place up” she manages between bites. “Just cameras. Keep your head down though I don’t want you gettin’ in trouble.”

“Mhmm” I keep my eyes down.

“It’s almost time newbie, I’ll see you tomorrow then” 

I hear the door whoosh open. *Must’ve oiled it.*



I tick ‘No’ again.

For verbal contact.

I always tick no.

Right?



I stroll to the post office, I see Jimmy at his desk. He looks up at me. He squints, then smiles.

“Hey man, how-how you doin’?”

I feel stares on me from the other workers. *Mind your fucking business.*

“Guess I’m alright. Did you catch any news on the whole dependent 2 thing Jim?”

Jimmy hesitates, “I-uh… Look man, they denied it. It isn’t official yet but upstairs says they can’t be sending money to anyone with a record.”

I felt my breath getting quicker.

“It’s my fucking brother Jim. He needs the money. It’s been months, why the fuck didn’t I hear anything?”

More heads turning. 

“Don’t kill the messenger alright?”, Jimmy shifts in his seat. “I’m just telling you what I heard. They didn’t send me a letter. You know I’d tell you if they did.”

I close my eyes for a second and exhale slow. I feel my hands balling into a fist, the skin on my knuckles feels tight.

“Fine. But I’m reapplying, I’ll get a letter from his rehab.”

“You’ll need to fill this out first.” Jimmy reaches under his desk and hands me an envelope.

 

**Psychological Evaluation Tier 3**



“Jim I just filled this out last—”

“Just do it”, he says, quieter. “It’s different”

He’s holding out the envelope, not breaking eye contact. 

I take it.

I almost sprint to my room. I tear the envelope open on my desk. It’s a dossier. “Guard 21”. I flip it open. 



**Psychological Report** 

*“…Guard 21 continues to exhibit increased emotional volatility. Expressed unprovoked hostility during delivery round. Noted sweating, verbal disorientation, gaze avoidance. Denied contact with entity (verbal), but behavioral indicators might suggest otherwise…”*

I flip the pages.



**Behavioural metrics table**

*…*

*• Day 03 – flinched upon hearing entity speak; observed lip movement. No audio logged.*

*• Day 08 – Time spent in Room 2709 exceeds SOP window by 2m 41s.*

*• Day 12 – Elevated heart rate (recorded 132 bpm) upon exit. Possible distress response.*

*• Day 14 – returned tray with trembling hands, failed to complete Section 5 of report form.*

*• Day 16 – Observed laughing during debrief transit. No external stimulus recorded.*

…

*Subject appears to be talking in his sleep.*

*Keeps saying “Snow, down boy.”*

*…*



The next page is an empty white sheet with a grainy, photocopied image still stapled to a plain white sheet. Timecode’s in the corner



***Image Description:*** *Subject 21 standing within 3 feet of the entity. Hands behind back. Expression neutral or faintly amused.*

Caption written in pen beneath the image: *“You’re not supposed to be smiling.”*

*…*

A weight sinks in my stomach. I was smiling. I don’t remember smiling.

I look up at the ceiling. Then again. And again.

*Shit. SHIT.*

I climb on my desk, running my hands through the ceiling. *Where are the FUCKING cameras?* I sprint to my bed, throw the mattress to the floor and bend down. *Under the pillows, under the mattress. In the bathroom? Fuck uh on my desk.* I feel my chest heave as I tear my room apart. GOD DAMN IT

“BZZZZZZT” 

Already? I feel the sun peaking through the blinds. Did I sleep?

I slip on my uniform. I need a belt. I check my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I barely recognize myself. I need to speak to Jim. I dial the intercom. 

No answer.

I slam the phone in place. 

I hurry over to the post office, it’s shuttered*.*

*“GUARD 21 PLEASE REPORT TO PANTRY FOR DUTY”,* the PA system screams

Shit. I sprint to the lift. The elevator music is glitching. It’s grating.

*DING*

I take the tray. It’s empty. The server shutters the pantry window close. *What the hell is his problem?*



*Calm down.* 

*No, I don't wanna calm down.* 



Stupid bureaucracy, stupid company, stupid fucking job. Won’t even let me talk to my ma. I swipe my access card. Drop the tray. I’m too mad to think.

“They’re trying to break you down, newbie. I can’t just sit here and watch.”

I’m trying to calm myself. I look at the camera on the wall, then back down. “I haven’t spoken to ma in weeks, they’re fucking calling it a tower outage.”

“BULLSHIT. You hear me newbie? It’s bullshit. They just want you cornered and alone. So you listen to them like a good little pooch. But you see through it, newbie. I know you do.” 

I look away, pretend to scratch my cheek.

“Come on you gotta stay strong, for your Ma. I can live without rice for a day, don’t you cry for me neither.”

“I fucking hate it here”

“Me too newbie. You think they keep rapists like this? Killers? No. But if a girl defends herself, lock her up, throw away the fucking key.” she rattles her chains.

“Did you really do it 201? I don’t care I just gotta know” 

“What if I told you I did?”

Silence.

“Every last one of ’em deserved it. You hear me newbie? EVERY LAST ONE”, her voice echos. “Every needle-arm, every twitchy little fucker who thought I was weak had it coming.”

“Bunch of lowlife junkies too.” *Maybe the world is better off without these vermin. All a bunch of fucking Sams.* 

“You’re the only one that understands.” Her eyes glow softly, I feel her smiling at me. “You don’t need to call me 201, newbie. The name’s Daisy.”

The lights shut. The room is drowned in a red glow. I hear an announcement being made outside. The AC is out, the door is locked. The power’s out. 



*GENERATOR FAILURE. POWER EXPECTED TO BE OUT BETWEEN 2 TO 4 HOURS*



My eyes widen as the metal door swings open. 

“Newbie please” she chokes. “Take me with you. I promise I know the best place to hide. Just you and me. The cameras are out come on” 



I feel a pull. 

*You’re breaking protocol.*

I feel my head turning.

*“DO NOT look it in the eye”*



*GENERATOR FAILURE. POWER EXPECTED TO BE OUT BETWEEN 2 TO 4 HOURS*



Daisy Peters, my first love. Her smile could brighten up the darkest days. She looked so beautiful, her lips full, her teeth sharp and pointy. Little horns on the top of her head. She was so cute. Beautiful glowing emeralds for eyes. Her tongue is slit, powerful, graceful. 

“So what’s your name, newbie?”

“I-I uh” I pause, “I don’t remember.”

She's beautiful.

“Get me out”, she sings.

I’m transfixed.

“GET ME OUT”, Daisy jumps with joy. 

I get to work. I insert my keys into the lock, they’re not turning. I feel the metal press against my skin.

I’m tugging them. She's screaming. 

I choke. I’m so pathetic.

“GET ME OUT PLEASE”

I’m biting at them. My teeth are bleeding. I don’t care. Daisy’s crying. *Daisy’s crying.* She's sobbing. She's inconsolable. Don’t cry Daisy please. “I’m trying, I swear I’m trying. I’ll convince my superiors, just please”

But then she stops.Just for a second.Her body jerks forward like she’s going to scream again — but nothing comes out.She slumps slightly. The chains rattle.“Please...” she whispers, softer. “Please don’t leave me here.”

The lights come back on. I stand up and plead with the guards to let her go. I beg. I cry. I’m kicking and screaming. But they pick me up with ease.

I see tears pool around Daisy’s eyes again. She breathes in again and manages to scream one last time.

“PLEASE JUST GET ME—” 

The metal door shuts. My heart breaks.

I’m sedated.

I wake up in a haze. I’m tied to a chair. One arm is free. How considerate.

I’m sorry ma. I’m sorry Sam. 

The chains around me press into my bones. 

I’m in a dark room surrounded by monitors.

*There was no power cut. There was no guard.* 

A thousand voices blare from speakers around me. 

I see myself trying to break Daisy out. I see myself trash my room. I’m sleeping. I’m running down the hall. I’m at the post office.

*Please just make it stop.* 

Jimmy walks in and hands me a pen. 

“Fill this out”

I look down. A form.



**Psychological Evaluation – Tier 4**



I flip it over.



**Phase 4: Subject 21 Exposure Analysis**

**Hypothesis: Emotionally compromised subjects exhibit decreased resistance to Subject 201’s identity drift pattern under prolonged exposure.**



I see Daisy crying on the camera again. Tears blot the paper as I tick boxes. 

Through all the voices I hear Daisy’s the loudest:

“GET ME OUT PLEASE”
