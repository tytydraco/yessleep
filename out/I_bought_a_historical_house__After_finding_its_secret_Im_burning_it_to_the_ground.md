I stare into the dark windows with nothing but regret.  What had been a dream for me had become a nightmare, one day at a time.  That house had stood for over two hundred years, and its thick hardwood beams would have held for a hundred more.

Yellow leaves blow off of the gnarled oak in the front yard, wind carrying the strong scent of fifty gallons of gasoline, making my eyes water.  The lighter is slick in my sweating palms.  From the high attic with its dusty rafters down to the ancient cellar, this will be the house’s last day.

It seems impossible to me now, but when I first saw it, I was in love.

Yes, the white paint was peeling from the clapboards and would need to be sanded and re-painted.  Yes, it was far from town, up a winding road lined with old fences and hardwoods turning colors for the fall.  While inconvenient, it made up for it with aesthetic.  The house felt like it had a soul; like I wouldn’t be buying it, but instead taking care of it.

Also, it might have been the only one I could afford anywhere in the vicinity, leaving me few options.

When we first bought it, my wife’s employer had very generously offered her a fully remote position moving forward, but she would be staying at our apartment for the next two months to wrap up her current projects.  I would miss her, but it gave me time to get the house cleaned up enough that she would actually want to move in.

Unlocking the front door, I pulled hard to open it.  It dragged across the boards of the patio and the hinges creaked.  When I flicked on the light switch, the ancient incandescent bulbs flickered in their glass sconces, sending a warm glow across the faded floral wallpaper.  Standing there, the house was as silent as a mausoleum.

Some of the furniture was still there; a small table with delicate legs at the end of the hall, the hardwood bed frames which would have to be disassembled to move.  The previous owners had died here, I knew.  Nothing sinister, the old woman had been in her eighties when she passed.

It almost felt wrong to change anything, but I knew that was irrational.  All of the exterior wood had been replaced a hundred years ago, even though the design had been meticulously kept.  At that time, the structure was already a century old, and they’d updated the plumbing and electrical.  No part of the house was original except for the foundation, which had been a homestead as early as the 1700’s.  I would be taking care of it, keeping it livable and keeping it sound.

A musty smell permeated the air, which I couldn’t put my finger on.  At the time, there was no way for me to know the source.  I figured it might have been from the rodent droppings scattered in dark corners, which are inevitable in an unoccupied old house.  I had my work cut out for me; it made sense to take care of the problems I could see first.  I did a deep clean on the first floor room I would be staying in, before moving in my mattress.

My sleep was restless, but I attributed it to being in a new place, and the long list of expensive things I would have to do to make it livable.  When I awoke in the twilight before dawn, I just got up and started working.

I put on some water to boil for coffee, and was bothered again by the musty smell.  The mornings were getting cold, but I opened the windows and doors, making note of which needed repair.  In the meantime, I went outside to rake the deposit of leaves which half buried the driveway.

Lifting a heap of them into the trash can, I noticed something by the twisting roots of the ancient oak.  There was a giant brown rabbit, the biggest I’d ever seen sitting there and watching me, from only ten feet away.  It surprised me so badly that I jumped, but the rabbit didn’t move an inch.  As strange as that was, the kettle began to whistle so I walked around it to go inside.

Passing through the door, the lights flickered.  I can’t say why, but I looked back out at the lawn and the tree for the rabbit.  It was gone.

I scheduled an electrician and a plumber to come look at the house, then got started cleaning the other rooms.  I put on a respirator and rubber dish gloves, spraying disinfectant into every cupboard and closet before scrubbing them thoroughly.  Most of them had mouse or rat droppings.

The closets and drawers were all empty, except for one that had been missed.  It was a crawl space under the stairs, with a simple brass knob on a triangular door.  When I opened it, I was greeted with a significant amount of dust, which covered a leather binder and a few boxes.

Retrieving the binder, I saw that it was a photo album.  While the plastic sleeves and metal rings were comparatively new, many of the photos were not. I found one dated 1913, showing a smiling couple in front of the same house, which they had just renovated.  I put that picture up on the refrigerator, planning to take a similar one with my wife whenever our own renovations were done.

As many lists as I made, and as much planning as I did, I still ended up making an embarrassing number of trips to the hardware store.  On my third trip that day, I apologised to the old man working there as I asked him for help once again.  He laughed.

“Don’t apologise, you fixing your house is keeping me in mine.”

After two weeks, we ended up talking a lot, and becoming friends.  He mentioned being part of the local historical society, and I thought he might like the photo album.  When I brought it in, his eyes lit up.

“Oh, these are fantastic!”

He recognized a few of the faces in the more recent photos.  Stopping at a particularly severe looking old woman, he carefully removed it from the sleeve with a wrinkled but steady hand.  Flipping it over, he pointed to the name on the back.

“Her family lived in that house for nearly three hundred years.  They wanted to keep it in the family, but never had children.  It was supposed to go to her niece, but the poor woman died in a car accident.

“She’s buried in the cemetery over on the other side of town.  They all are, all the way back.”  He leaned toward me across the counter on his elbows, as if he didn’t want anyone else to hear.  I was the only one in the store.

“Well, all but one.  There’s an old story that her great great grandmother, the one who built the house, was a witch.  Everyone in that family is buried there except for her, and they say it’s because a witch couldn’t stand a Christian burial.”

He leaned back and laughed.

“The story goes that they would have burned her, but her husband was rich, and you can’t burn rich people.  I don’t think she was a witch, but I do believe some people back then did.  Anyways, your total is $295.”

“Um, I think you forgot to charge me for the door hinges.”

“I didn’t forget.  $295.  See you tomorrow.”

That night there was a terrible storm.  Dense raindrops pummeled the window panes, sounding like someone was throwing handfuls of gravel.  The house creaked with gusts of wind, from top to bottom.  Down to the floorboards, the wood groaned, as if in pain.  I couldn’t sleep, as hard as I tried.  Had I known what I know now, I would have run out the front door.

As it was, I merely went around looking for leaks.  To my pleasant surprise, there were very few.  Climbing the narrow stairs to the attic, I shined a flashlight around and found a wet spot.  Water was dripping between the long exposed beams of the gambrel roof.  I managed to maneuver a ladder back up the cramped stairs and take a look.

Atop the ladder, I noticed something sitting atop one of the beams.  It was a small wooden box made of wood, which looked very old.  If you weren’t on a ladder, there was no way you could see it from below.  It might have been there a very long time.

Curious, I reached out to take it, holding my flashlight in my mouth.  Something rattled inside, and I opened it.  At first I couldn’t tell what I was looking at, some collection of small and oddly shaped white objects.  Holding it closer to the light, I blinked in shock.

It was teeth.  They were all jumbled together, but the shape of the incisors made it clear they were human.  From the size, they could only be from an adult.  Climbing down from the ladder, I counted them.  All thirty two.

I left the box on the kitchen table.  I didn’t know what else to do with it.

Lightning flashed somewhere close outside, thunder shaking the house at the same time.  The lights flickered as I sat in one of the old polished wooden chairs, staring at that box, knowing I wasn’t going to sleep.

The house was drafty.  At some point, we would need the windows re-done.  To fight off the cold, I put on water for tea.  Staring at the box of teeth, I suddenly pushed my chair back and walked to the living room, making my way toward the stairs.

The boxes were sitting on the floor, still covered in dust.  Opening one, I found folder upon folder of useless documents, which had been indispensable to the previous owners.  A receipt for a microwave, the first in a large stack which meant nothing to anyone now.  I perched the box on the table as I rifled through it, looking for anything about the house and the people who had lived there before me.

Again lightning struck, and the lights went out completely.  Startled, I knocked the box over in the darkness, fumbling for the light switch.  Before I could get to it, the bulbs flickered back to life.  Sighing, I looked at the disastrous pile of papers and books strewn across the floor.  The kettle whistled, prodding at my sleepless nerves.  I moved it angrily, not bothering to make tea.

As I went to clean up the mess, a single yellowed book was open at the top of the stack, its ancient spine torn from the fall.  The writing wasn’t printed, but a tall and narrow handwriting, the cursive lines neatly paralleling each other.  I admired the quality of the writing, a lost art in modern times, before noticing the content.

“*I am beset with tryal of body and mind the likes of which none should endure.  Whatever pact Mother hath made with the Devil, I am not desirous to know.  As she labours under her restraints, there is no choice left us but to wall her in to languish there.  H, enraged after she did bite him, delivered to her a blow with an axe such as would kill any man or woman.  I have no heart to pursue her physical demise further.  We shall submit her to His judgement and sentence*.”

Before I could read more, the wind berated the house, the dark sky reaching out to push and pull ferociously at the old frame.  As loudly as the wood squeaked, I heard something else.  From the floorboards, a pained moaning.

I don’t know what came over me, whether it was fear or madness, but I pushed the stubborn front door open and stepped into the storm, making my way for the carport.  Some tools had been left there, and I knew exactly what I needed.  I’d used the rake, which was leaning nearby, but I had to push away cobwebs and a shovel to get the sledgehammer.

On my way back to the house a shadow sat on the lawn, under the oak tree, in the dim porch light.  The rabbit.  Unphased by the storm, it stared at me with blank, glassy eyes.

I yelled at it, waved the hammer.  It didn’t budge, only watched.  I considered running up to it, scaring it away, but for some reason didn’t.

With a vicious yank, the basement door came open.

The damp stones and stained mortar all around me looked identical, but it took little deduction to figure out which part of the basement had been walled off; three walls were directly under those of the house above, and one was closer in.  To be sure, I tapped an exterior wall with the heavy metal head of the hammer, then the one I suspected.  The sounds were different enough, in my frenzied state.

Lit with only my propped flashlight in the corner, I brought the hammer back, striking at the wall with all of my might.  A spark flew from the impact, but the well-placed stone held in place.  On the next hit, I noticed mortar cracking and falling to the floor.

As if enraged by my demolition, the storm grew even wilder, the beams of the house giving off angry cracks as the window panes rattled threateningly above me.  Above the din, I could hear another straining, a cursed moaning from behind the wall.  I told myself it was just the house and the storm, but I didn’t believe it, even then.

Sweating and panting, I pulled at the stone, which shifted in place but would not come loose.  It was only after several minutes of beating at the surrounding stones to loosen them that my hammer finally dislodged it, not towards me, but away.

Into a dark, sealed chamber.

The stench was terrible.  That musky smell I had noticed entering the door the first time was multiplied a thousandfold, and now held the sour bite of a long dead animal.  I stood frozen, listening for… a moan.

But I heard nothing from that dark hole, the rough gap between antique stones.  I gathered my courage, walked back the corner where the beam of my flashlight illuminated the room, and took it in my hand.  What was through that hole?  What would I bring to light for the first time in two hundred years?

My rage had worn off, exhausted with my muscles from frantically swinging the heavy hammer.

Each step was difficult, approaching the wall fearfully as I shone the light into it, leaning down carefully to peer in from a distance, imagining a withered hand might reach out to grab me through it.

There was a chair, built so heavily the legs rivaled the uprights of the house.  At the base of those legs tarnished metal plates were bolted into the solid stone beneath.  Manacles had been improvised by bending sheets of metal, presumably with a vice and hammer, and they were attached to the arms of the chair.

Inside the manacles, withered hands rested limply.  Above them tattered cloth covered a desiccated arm.  There was another restraint made from a metal sheet, which went around her neck and attached to the back of the chair.  Sparse black hair clung to the mummified skull.

The sound, the sound is what I’ll never forget.  If you took a wicker basket in both hands and tried to twist it out of shape, if it cracked and creaked dryly under the force, that was how it sounded when she turned her head.

I didn’t stay to see her face, if she still had eyes.  Or teeth.  All I saw was part of her forehead caved in, presumably from an ax wound.

I ran upstairs, pushed the door open, and got in my car.  With the windshield wipers going full speed I could barely see anything, and I could only do twenty-five down the hill without losing traction.  I parked the car and turned it off, waiting for 7:00 AM.

When the gas station opened, they had ten five-gallon gas cans, and I bought all of them.  I went down to the basement, and poured the first through the hole with shaking hands.  Starting the second, I nearly dropped the can hearing a coarse, scratching sound coming from her mouth.  It was too regular for a cough, too sinister.

She was laughing.

It didn’t stop me.  I poured nine cans through that hole, figured the gasoline would be pooling at her feet.  By the tenth can, I was coughing with the fumes filling the entire basement.  I didn’t pour that can in the hole; instead splashed it on the broken wall, then the floor, then up the stairs, then out the door.

Here I am, looking at the peeling white paint on the clapboards.  The open door and dark windows.  There’s no rain, just gray clouds above the skeletal branches of the oak tree.  The storm put every last leaf on the ground.  My palms are slick with sweat, grasping the lighter.

That damned brown rabbit is staring at me, and it can keep staring.  After this, I’ll never see it again.  I’m going to do what should have been done a long time ago.  I’m going to burn [the witch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/patrickmullensauthor/comments/1kern3o/patrick_mullens_written_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
