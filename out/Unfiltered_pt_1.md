\- “I’ve always believed that the human brain is the most complicated map in existence. Every thought, every emotion, everything is woven in such an intricate, delicate way. And yet, it’s all controlled by something that, for some reason, we think we understand, but we don’t. What happens when the brain starts to fail? Or worse, what happens when someone, of their own free will, starts to ignore the signals? The red lights that the brain should turn on, but never does. Those are the minds that interest me. And that’s why I’m here. Because what I discovered, what I’m about to reveal, will change everything we know about human behavior.”

\- “At first, I thought there was a simple explanation for what I was looking for. A few miswired neurons, a bit of faulty genetics… But the truth is much darker than that. When the mind cracks, when psychopathy and crime emerge from the shadows, the answers are more complicated than one might imagine. But still, I can’t stop looking. Because when it comes to the human mind, there’s something very seductive about unraveling what’s beyond the visible.”

Martina’s voice is clear, but there’s something in her tone that can’t be easily identified. A subtle shudder in her words, as if she were talking about something that has her trapped, even though she can’t help it. There’s an obsession, not just scientific, but personal.

\- “Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself. My name is Martina. I’m a neuroscientist, although I don’t usually call myself that too much. My coworkers call me ‘the weird one’ because of my approach. Nobody understands why, sometimes, I spend entire days researching human behavior and its darkest disorders. I’m the one who always looks for patterns in broken minds, those that fall between the margins of normality. People sometimes look at me as if I’m dangerous. And no, I’m not talking about those crazy people in horror movies. I'm talking about those cases that psychiatrists dismiss as 'anomalies', as 'complex minds'. These are the people who really intrigue me. Those, the ones who never fit in, the ones everyone avoids. The ones who, in the end, make the difference.”

Martina reflects in silence while the soft sound of a coffee machine in the background resonates in the room. The noises are constant, but the feeling that the scene generates is one of isolation. Martina is alone in her thoughts, immersed in something much bigger than herself. This is where her story begins.

\- “Over the years, I have worked with many experts, but I can't say that they have all understood the 'why' of this research. Although, of course, I don't care too much what they think. Dr. Avery, for example... I would never understand him. He's a brilliant guy, sure, but sometimes his methods... his ways so... cold... almost calculating, make my hair stand on end. He's British, which probably explains his distance. She always has a distant look, as if she were looking at something through a fog that no one else can see. But what bothers me is her silence.”

\- “Then there is Sofia. She is completely different, her mindset... she is more open, warmer. She will never admit it, but she has become fond of the team, of the people. Even though she feels like a fish out of water, she always has something to say, something to add to the analysis, something to question what we think we know about human beings and their relationships with nature. People like Sofia, who observe ecosystems, the connections between animals and human behavior, are disconcerting to me. But not in a bad way. It gives me hope in a way. Even though she never tells me, I know that she is as caught up in this mystery as I am. She, like me, is looking for answers.”

\- “But, of course, not all the team shares my enthusiasm. Some are only here because they are interested in the money or the prestige that comes with the project.”

\- “I can't tell you everything now. It's not the time. But when this research comes to an end, when it all falls apart… you will understand what we discovered. And what we did, what I did to stop it.”

The lab is quiet, the distant hum of computers mingling with the rustle of leaves against the windows in the gentle breeze that blows in. It is early in the morning, but there is already tension in the air. I am sitting in front of a table full of papers. There are studies on the behavior of bees, charts on their communication through pheromones, and detailed observations of movements within hives. Images of bees are clearly imprinted in my mind, their flight in perfect harmony, like a moving clock. But today, I cannot concentrate on that.

I feel Sofia's presence behind me before I hear her voice.

\- "How are we doing with the data from hive 3?" - Sofia asks in her usually optimistic tone, but there's something in her voice that makes me think she's also uneasy.

\- "I don't know," - I answer, running a hand through my hair. "It seems like the behavior of the bees in hive 3 is altered. They're more agitated than usual. Like something's disturbing them."

Sofia walks over, looking at the data on my screen. Her eyes quickly scroll over the graphs and notes I've been taking, and then she looks at me with a mix of uncertainty and concern.

\- "Do you think there's something that might be interfering with their pheromones?" - she suggests. "Maybe there's an external factor we're ignoring."

\- "That's what I think. The flight patterns are erratic, and not just in one hive, but in several. It might be something in the environment, or maybe... something else," - my voice falters, although I try to sound confident.

Sofia raises an eyebrow, as if she's not sure what exactly I'm referring to. But before I can say anything, Dr. Avery enters the room. Always so formal, so meticulous. Each of his steps is calculated, as if he's gauging her presence.

\- "What do we have here, girls?" - his tone is curt, but not completely rude. Although, to tell the truth, he always has that distant air, as if he's on a mission he doesn't fully understand. "Any progress with the bees?"

Sofia looks at him and answers quickly, as she always does, trying to avoid any kind of conflict.

\- "We're seeing some strange patterns. In the last few weeks, the bees in several of the hives have shown signs of disturbance. We're not sure what's causing it."

Dr. Avery walks over, glances at the data on my computer screen, and after a moment of silence, nods dismissively.

\- “And what do you propose to do about it?” – his tone suggests he’s not as concerned about the bees as we are. He’s focused on progress, on results, not on details that can’t be controlled.

\- “We wanted to do a few more tests. Maybe expose them to different controlled environments to see how they react, but…” – Sofia pauses, looking at the other team members who have begun to enter the room. “What if there’s something else? Something out of the ordinary.”

Sofia’s words echo in the air, weighing more than she expected. Dr. Avery looks at her with an impassive expression, as if he doesn’t understand what she’s referring to.

\- "What I'm interested in, girls," Dr. Avery begins, interrupting what she was going to say, "is that we have concrete results. This is not a research about theories. If something is interfering with the bees, we need to know what it is, period. We don't have time for... assumptions."

The tension is palpable. It's rare to see Dr. Avery so involved in a conversation that isn't directly about results.

\- “I know,” I say, feeling my mind churning, but something is off, something I can’t describe. “But I think we’re dealing with something that might be more… more than just a problem with the environment.”

Sofia gives me a quick glance. She senses it too. Sometimes, we don’t need words to understand what the other is thinking. By this time, the team is gathered around the table, and Dr. Avery changes the subject, starting a formal meeting about progress and next steps. I forget about the topic, here they just want… results.

It’s late. The lab is almost empty, only the sound of the keyboard and the distant murmur of the coffee machine interrupt the silence. The clock on the wall reads 9:15 PM. At this time, I’m usually in my office, surrounded by books and papers, immersed in preparing for the class I’m supposed to teach on free will. But today I can’t concentrate. My mind is caught in a whirlwind of thoughts that don’t seem to fit.

I’m looking through studies on the human brain, recent research on decision making, and the surprising conclusions of neuroscientists. Something is running through my head, but I don’t know how to process it. I open another article. It’s a study that talks about how the human brain makes decisions even before we, as individuals, are aware of them—exactly 550 milliseconds before we are aware. \*It’s like we’re puppets of the brain\*, I think, going over the words in the text.

I remember when I first read about Benjamin Libet’s experiments. In those studies, the participants thought they were making decisions in real time, but in reality, their brain had already activated the areas necessary to carry out that decision seconds before they were aware of it. In other words, our brain seems to be taking over before we can even say “I decided.” Does that mean we’re completely subject to a fate we don’t control?

My mind drifts to another, more disturbing thought. If our brains already make decisions without our consent, could that explain criminal behavior? Could lack of control be a justification for heinous acts? Maybe criminals, murderers, are not entirely responsible for what they do, if the brain makes the decisions for them. But I can't help but wonder: is it really that simple?

I can't stop reading, another page and another. The information about the brain areas involved in criminal behavior draws me in, one more piece that fits into the puzzle of my mind. The amygdala, that little almond-shaped structure, is in charge of emotion, fear, anger, and also reward processing. The prefrontal cortex, which is located at the front of the brain, is associated with rational decision making, impulse control, and morality. It's as if the battle between emotion and reason happens inside our brains.

But there's something stopping me. Something that's not adding up. Something beyond the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. The thalamus. This “gate guard” that connects sensory information to the brain, which integrates what we perceive from the outside world. It is the processing center of our reality. What if dysregulation in the thalamus has something to do with criminal behavior? It is an idea that pops into my mind suddenly, like a flash of light in the dark. If the thalamus is not managing sensory information correctly, if it is transmitting erroneous signals to the brain, could that influence how we perceive the world? Could it cause a person to see reality in a distorted way, leading to violence, impulsiveness, a lack of empathy?

My heart beats faster, as if a click had just sounded in my head. I stare at the computer screen for a moment, motionless. The hypothesis slowly takes shape, an outline of a theory that could change everything. \*This has to be explored\*, I think. But I don’t have time to think too much, my free will class is about to start in a few hours. I quickly scan through my notes for the class I'm supposed to give on the theory of free will. But now the words feel hollow, as if they no longer matter. I can't stop thinking about this hypothesis. I need to do more research, and I need to share it with someone, someone who can help me understand if this hypothesis has any basis.

I open my office door and head down the hall to the lab where Sofia usually hangs out. I find her looking over some graphs on bee behavior.

\- "Sofia," I call urgently, my voice vibrating with excitement. "I have a new hypothesis. About criminal behavior... I think there's something else. Something in the brain, something we haven't considered."

Sofia turns to me, surprised by my tone.

\- "What's wrong, Martina? Have you realized something? Wait, our project is on bees, why are you designing hypotheses on humans and on... murderers?"

\- "It's the thalamus. I've been reading about free will and criminal behavior, and I think the thalamus might be involved. If it doesn't regulate sensory information properly, we could be seeing a distortion of reality. One that could justify certain impulsive, even criminal behavior."

Sofia looks at me silently for a moment. Her expression turns thoughtful, almost as if she's evaluating what I just said.

\- “That sounds… interesting, but it’s also a pretty risky hypothesis, isn’t it?” – she answers, rubbing her chin in thought. “Are you sure there’s something in the thalamus that could influence that kind of behavior?”

\- “I’m not sure, but it’s something I want to explore. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that criminal behavior is often linked to alterations in brain areas like the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex. If everything is connected, maybe the thalamus is the missing link.”

Sofia nods slowly, as if considering the possibility.

\- “Okay, Martina. But we should talk about it with the team. This could change the course of our investigation. If we’re willing to go down that path, we need to have more solid evidence.”

Anxiety consumes me. I know I’ve made a decision, but I also feel the weight of what that entails. Will this be what finally makes us discover something big?

The tension in the air is palpable as I stand in front of the meeting room mirror, adjusting my hair and mentally reviewing notes of what I'm going to say. Sofia is beside me, just as nervous, though calmer in appearance. She doesn't know how the research group will react to my hypothesis, and neither do I.

\- "Are you sure this is what you want to do?" - Sofia asks, lowering her voice so no one else can hear her.

\- "I have no choice. If I don't do it now, I never will. But… I need your help to make my hypothesis make sense." - I reply, feeling my words catch in my throat. "I promise everything will fall into place. After the meeting, we'll find the answers we need."

Sofia gives me a slight nod, though her expression is filled with uncertainty. I, on the other hand, am determined, but I also feel a knot in my stomach. What if they don't believe me? What if this is all just an illusion I've created in my head? The door opens and Avery, the group's director, enters. His ever-imposing presence fills the room. He's a tall man with short hair and thick-framed glasses. He has a way of looking at people that makes you feel like he's constantly analyzing you.

\- "Martina," he says with a slight smile, observing my nervousness. "You're ready for the meeting. Remember, we're going to talk about the results of the project. I want to know what factor explains the erratic behavior of the bees."

\- "Yes, Avery," I answer, trying to make my voice sound firm. "But before we start with the details of the bees' behavior, I want to talk about something else. Something that's been on my mind."

He frowns slightly, intrigued, but nods.

\- "Make it quick, Martina. We're short on time. If you have something to say, it better be now."

Sofia looks at me, as if telling me to get to the point, and I take a deep breath, looking at the research group that has already gathered around the table. There is a murmur of conversation and some nervous laughter, but the atmosphere quickly calms down when everyone notices that I have stood up. With one hand clenched on my notes, I begin to speak.

\- "I've been thinking about something that could change the course of our research. For weeks, we've been focused on the behavior of bees and how their action patterns have begun to deviate from what is expected. But, what's been on my mind isn't just bees… what I want to investigate now is human behavior. And specifically, criminal behavior."

Upon hearing these words, the room falls silent. The faces of my classmates light up with expressions of confusion, curiosity, and in some cases, skepticism. Avery, in the background, adjusts his glasses and watches me intently.

\- "What are you talking about, Martina?" - Avery asks, not hiding the surprise in her voice. "Are you suggesting that criminal behavior has something to do with what we're researching about bees?"

\- "No, it's not exactly that," - I answer, my voice shaking slightly. "What I'm suggesting is that the behavior of humans, and particularly criminals, could be influenced by a dysfunction in the brain areas that control our perception of the world. I'm talking specifically about the thalamus."

I see how some of the team members look at each other, their eyes full of doubt. Others start taking notes. I feel a little calmer seeing that they are at least paying attention.

\- "Martina," - Javier, one of the researchers, a tall man with curly hair and glasses, intervenes. "Are you saying that the behavior of murderers can be explained by failures in the thalamus? That people who commit crimes have no control over what they do?"

\- "Not exactly," - I answer quickly, searching for the right words. “I’m saying that if the thalamus, which regulates the integration of sensory information, isn’t working properly, we could be seeing a distortion of reality. This could explain impulsivity, lack of empathy, and in extreme cases, criminal behavior. This is something I want to investigate further. The bees could be a clue, but this is much bigger.”

Avery leans back in his chair, thoughtful. His gaze shifts to me, then to the rest of the group.

\- “So, you’re asking me to change the focus of the project to something we haven’t tested yet? A hypothesis that could be completely wrong?”

My heart pounds, but I take a deep breath before answering.

\- “Yes, Avery. But I also think it’s a unique opportunity. If we can prove that this kind of dysfunction in the brain can be behind criminal behavior, we could have a new way of understanding psychopathy, criminality, and justice.”

Silence stretches across the room as my words settle in the air. Finally, Avery leans forward, her eyes locked on me. Everyone awaits her response.

“Okay,” she says after a moment of thought. “I’m going to allow you to continue with this line of research. But I want you to have a clear plan. If we’re going to make this change, we need an experimental design and we need results soon. We can’t afford to waste time.”

I feel relieved, though still nervous. Avery hasn’t completely said “yes,” but she has agreed to investigate the possibility. It’s all I needed.

“Thank you, Avery. You won’t regret it,” I say, feeling the adrenaline flowing through my veins.

Days later, Sofia and I are in the lab, staring at the whiteboard filled with diagrams and data about the mice we’re going to use in the experiment. Lab animals are perfect for this: small, easy to handle, and with a nervous system similar enough to humans that we can extrapolate the results. My hypothesis is starting to take shape.

“Are you sure we want to do this, Martina?” Sofia asks as she writes down some notes. “What if something goes wrong?”

“We have no choice, this is our chance to try something revolutionary,” I reply, looking at the outline of the experiment I’ve designed. “We’re going to test how thalamus dysfunction affects the behavior of mice. And if we succeed, this could change everything we know about human behavior.”

Sofia smiles, even though I know she shares my doubts. But she also feels the thrill of research. And I don’t blame her. Because, from now on, the project will be completely different.
