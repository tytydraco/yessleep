My wife “Audrey” and I have been together for five years and married just under one.  
Our life together has always been calm, comfortable. There was never anything strange about her. No quirks, no red flags. If anything, she was the most straightforward woman I’d ever known.

Audrey is smart, gentle, and unfailingly practical. She’s not the kind of person who wastes time on nonsense. She’s not silly, or scattered. Everything in her life has its place. That’s just who she is.

She doesn’t do spooky. Doesn’t even like Halloween. I tried getting her to watch *Poltergeist* with me our first October together and she bailed before the first act. Said she didn’t see the point in scaring yourself for fun. It’s just not her thing. Never has been.

She doesn’t do pranks. Doesn’t make jokes unless they’re dry and bookish. Doesn’t pull surprises, doesn’t leave messes. I can’t remember her ever being disorganized. If you asked me what Audrey’s most consistent trait was, I’d probably say: she keeps things tidy.

That’s important to understand.  
Because that’s why the piles didn’t make sense.

I don’t mean normal messes. I’m not talking about laundry or dishes or clutter. These were *intentional*. Piled *deliberately*. Things stacked in corners or behind furniture that I know neither of us had touched in weeks. Grocery bags, folded towels, old receipts, single shoes. At first I thought maybe she was sorting donations or digging through forgotten boxes, but she never mentioned it. She just… left them there.

The first one was small. A plastic grocery bag filled with folded napkins and a pair of gardening gloves. Nothing weird. But I remember seeing it in the corner by the radiator one morning before work and thinking, *Huh, that’s not like her.*

I thought maybe she’d gotten distracted. Or maybe she was just cleaning out a drawer and hadn’t finished. Either way, I didn’t say anything. We were both rushing that morning. I grabbed my coffee, kissed her goodbye, and forgot about it.

But the pile was still there the next day. And the day after that.  
And by the end of the week, it wasn’t the only one.

Two weeks ago I was leaving for work a little later than usual. I had an early Zoom meeting and didn’t need to rush downtown, so I made coffee in the quiet like always, tiptoeing around so I didn’t wake Audrey.

I was walking down the hallway toward the front door, sipping from my mug, phone in the other hand, when something caught my eye near the bottom of the stairs.

It was a pile.

Not one of the older ones. This one was new.

A stack of things layered like a child had arranged them. A folded blanket, two cans of tomato soup, one of her slippers, and a crumpled grocery bag stuffed with... I don’t even know. Junk, I guess. And right on top, like the cherry on a very unsettling sundae, was one of those long fake flower garlands we keep in the attic.

It wasn’t there last night. I would’ve seen it.

I took a few steps closer, trying not to spill my coffee as I leaned forward. That’s when I saw Audrey.

She was crouched behind the pile. Just... squatting there on the floor with her knees up under her chin. Her arms were wrapped tight around her legs and she was grinning at me over the top of the soup cans.

I nearly dropped my mug. I did spill a little on my shirt.

“Audrey,” I said, brushing at the coffee with my hand. “What the hell are you doing?”

She didn’t move. Didn’t say anything. Just kept smiling. Her hair was half in her face and I could see the whites of her eyes beneath it. Wide open. Barely blinking.

“You scared the crap out of me,” I added, trying to keep my voice light.

After a few seconds, she ducked her head behind the pile like a child playing hide and seek. I waited, expecting her to pop up again—but she didn’t.

By the time I reached the front door, she was gone.

I called out, “You’re a weirdo!” as I was about to step outside.

I heard her laugh from behind the pile.

It was weird. But not scary.  
Not yet.

By lunch, I’d already forgotten about it.  
And by the time I got home, she was her normal self again.

The pile near the stairs didn’t move. Not the rest of that day. Not the next. But I started to notice it more.

It just sat there. Still and silent. A cluster of unrelated junk—none of it valuable, none of it trash. Things that didn’t belong together, but somehow *looked* like they did. That was the weird part. It looked… arranged. Not stacked like someone cleaning, or organizing, but built. Like a display. Or a nest.

After a few days, I asked Audrey if she was going through old boxes. She looked up from her tea and shook her head.

“What boxes?” she asked.

I pointed toward the hallway. “The pile by the stairs.”

She frowned like she didn’t know what I was talking about.

“Oh,” she said after a moment. “Right. That.”

That was all she said. And then she changed the subject.

The next one showed up in the corner of the living room behind the armchair. I didn’t see her build it, didn’t hear her moving anything around. It was just *there* one morning, when I went to plug in my laptop charger. A lamp I hadn’t seen in years. Two mismatched boots. A plastic bowl with a cracked rim. On top of that, folded neatly, was one of my hoodies I thought I’d lost at work.

I picked it up, half-expecting her to yell at me from the kitchen—but she didn’t.

She didn’t even seem to notice I’d touched it.

Over the next week, the piles multiplied. Slowly. Quietly. But always at night.

One appeared inside the coat closet. Another behind the curtains in the dining room. A third one under the kitchen table.

A little *fuller*. And more deliberate.

Not messy.

Not random.

I found one behind the couch that had a tunnel through the middle—barely wide enough for a person to crawl through. I didn’t test it.

There were patterns to the objects. Always soft things near the bottom. Crumpled napkins. Dish towels. Wadded-up sheets. Then heavier items stacked on top of that. Books. Shoes. Cans. The occasional glass object nestled carefully into the top layers—like a cherry on a cake.

I didn’t know what to make of it.

I asked her once if she was in her nesting stage.

She smiled without showing her teeth and said, “Something like that.”

That was all.

The smell changed around that time, too.

It started faint. Like dust and plastic. Then stronger. Like cardboard soaked in old water. There was something warm and bitter in it, too—like the smell behind a thrift store or a school basement. I opened a few windows just to air things out, and when Audrey noticed, she quietly went behind me and shut them again. One by one.

She didn’t say anything.

She barely looked at me anymore.

I’d catch her standing near the piles sometimes. Not doing anything. Not even adding to them. Just… staring. Hands at her sides, head slightly tilted. I never heard her speak to them, but the way she looked at them… it was almost reverent. Like they were meant for something. Like she was waiting.

Sometimes I’d see her standing too still. In the middle of the hallway or behind a doorway. Half in shadow. Her arms tight to her sides. Chin slightly lifted. Like a doll someone had forgotten to pose correctly.

Then she’d blink, and smile, and walk away like nothing happened.

I stopped asking questions.

It happened again.  
I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV. When I woke, the screen was dark, and the house was silent. The clock on the wall said 2:13 a.m.

For a moment I just lay there, trying to remember what woke me. Then I heard it—a faint rustle, like paper shifting against fabric. It came from the corner of the room near the recliner.

I turned my head toward it, squinting through the half‑light.

The pile beside the recliner looked… wrong.  
Taller than before. Wider at the base. The outline was uneven, as if something underneath was moving, slow and careful.

I sat up a little, heart pounding.  
“Audrey?” I whispered.

No answer.

The rustling stopped.

For a few seconds the house was so quiet I could hear my own breathing. Then, from inside the pile, something shifted again—something soft brushing against the layers of fabric and boxes and plastic. The whole thing shuddered faintly, then settled.

I stood, not sure why, and took a slow step toward it. The air smelled stale, heavy with dust and the faint sweetness of old paper.

“Audrey?” I said again, louder this time.

The pile trembled.

A corner of a blanket lifted slightly, as though something underneath had exhaled. I took another step forward. My mouth was dry.

That’s when I saw her.

I could see her cheeks pushing against the edges of an old cereal box, her forehead tucked behind the corner of a rolled-up yoga mat. Her whole face framed by Christmas decorations and crepe paper like some deranged jack-in-the-box.

She was *inside* the pile.

For a long moment neither of us moved.

Then, slowly, she smiled.

It wasn’t a normal smile. It was too wide. Too deliberate. Like her skin didn’t quite fit her bones. Her lips trembled with excitement, and a faint, breathy sound came out of her throat—half laugh, half sigh.

I froze.

“What are you doing?” I whispered. My voice sounded strange to my own ears—thin, childish.

She didn’t answer. She only blinked once, her lashes brushing against the grime on her cheeks. Then she lifted one hand from beneath the folds of fabric. Her fingers were gray with dust, shaking slightly. She pressed a finger to her lips—*shh*—and then lowered it again, disappearing deep inside the pile.

The movement made the pile shift, the whole thing rustling and settling as if alive. A book slid down the side and hit the floor with a dull thud.

I took a step backward, then another. My legs were shaking.

The blankets rippled once more, and I caught a final glimpse of her eyes through the gap—still wide, still watching. Then they vanished deep inside the pile.

The pile stilled completely.

I stood there for what felt like an hour, staring at it, waiting for another movement, another sound. But there was nothing. Just the faint hum of the refrigerator and my own pulse thudding in my ears.

Finally, I backed out of the room, one slow step at a time, never taking my eyes off the recliner corner until I reached the hallway.

I didn’t sleep much the rest of the night. I had the lights on, listening for the faintest sound of movement. But the house stayed quiet.

Too quiet.

Around 7:30 I finally got up and made coffee, my hands still trembling as I poured it. I don’t even remember tasting it. I was just going through the motions, trying to feel normal.

Audrey came into the kitchen about twenty minutes later, yawning and stretching like nothing had happened. Her hair was tied back in a loose braid and she was wearing one of my old hoodies like she always did on her days off.

I just stared at her.

She didn’t have a single smudge on her. No dust. No lint. No indication that she’d spent the night buried under four feet of laundry and soup cans.

She smiled at me like she didn’t notice anything was wrong.

“Morning,” she said, reaching for a mug.

I hesitated before answering. “Hey.”

She poured herself some coffee and took a sip. “You look like hell.”

I forced a dry laugh. “Didn’t sleep much.”

“Hmm.” She leaned against the counter and looked out the window, totally unfazed.

“Audrey,” I said carefully, “we need to talk about the piles.”

She didn’t answer at first. Just took another sip of her coffee, then looked at me over the rim of her mug.

“They’re getting out of hand,” I said. “I mean, seriously. It’s starting to feel like—” I paused. I didn’t want to say *a hoarder’s house*. “—like they’re not just messes anymore. They’re creeping me out a little.”

Her brow furrowed slightly, but not like she was offended. More like she was bored. “They’re just piles,” she said.

“They’re not, though.” I tried to keep my voice calm. “You’re building them like… like they’re for something. You’re putting stuff inside them. You’re arranging them. That one near the recliner? It’s huge now. It’s almost as high as the ceiling.”

She shrugged. “I’ll move that one.”

“That’s not really what I mean.”

She tilted her head and looked at me. Her smile was polite. Small. “You worry too much.”

I set my mug down. “I saw you in it, Audrey.”

Her face didn’t change.

I waited for her to laugh it off, or ask what the hell I was talking about, or deny it completely. But she didn’t. She just stared at me for a long moment and then said, “It’s cozy.”

“What?”

She looked away, back toward the window. “You don’t have to understand it. I like the way it feels.”

My stomach turned. “What feels good about stuffing yourself into a pile of junk?”

She didn’t answer.

We stood there in silence for a few seconds, the only sound the ticking of the kitchen clock. Then she smiled again—just the corners of her mouth twitching up—and walked out of the room without saying another word.

I didn’t follow her.

I didn’t ask anything else.

I just stood there holding my coffee, staring out the window like maybe the answer was out there somewhere.

But it wasn’t.

We didn’t talk much after that. Audrey spent most of the afternoon in the bedroom with the door half closed. I could hear her moving around softly, like she was cleaning or folding something, but I didn’t check. I didn’t want to.

I stayed downstairs. Pretended to scroll my phone. Watched a movie I didn’t follow. But the whole time I couldn’t stop glancing toward the pile.

The one by the recliner.

It was the same one I’d seen her in.  
I hadn’t imagined it. I know what I saw.

She was *in* it. Her face, her hair, her hand coming up to her lips like she was trying to quiet me. Like it was some kind of secret we shared.

I kept thinking about what she said at breakfast. *“It’s cozy.”*  
Like it was a blanket fort or a sleeping bag.

But it wasn’t.

It wasn’t cozy. It was junk.

Boxes. Fabric. Old winter coats. Magazines from years ago. A cracked salad spinner. Things we hadn’t used in ages that somehow ended up stacked floor to ceiling like they belonged there.

The sun had started to go down when I finally stood up and walked toward the pile.

The air felt thicker in there. Musty. Like the kind of stillness you find in an attic. The pile loomed beside the recliner like a second piece of furniture. If you didn’t know better, you’d think it was supposed to be there.

I stood in front of it for a long time. Just staring.

The pile was almost seven feet tall now and stretched nearly six feet across. The top layers were softer—sheets, old hoodies, a pair of bath towels—but underneath was something more structured. More rigid. Like someone had packed it on purpose.

It wasn’t just a pile anymore. It was a *structure*.

I crouched down, hands on my knees, and leaned in closer. The air near it smelled strange. Warm and papery. Like the attic crawlspace at my grandma’s old house. It was stale, but not exactly rotten. Like something had been breathing in there for a long time.

I lifted a folded blanket from the top and gently peeled it back.

Dust rolled into the air like smoke.

Under the blanket were photographs — dozens of them — scattered in no real order. Most of them were of us. Our honeymoon, our old apartment, the day we brought home our cat. But they’d been… altered. Cut, scratched, torn. Some had long lines gouged across our faces. Others were smeared with something that looked like dried mud.

I felt my stomach twist.

Near the center of the pile was a frame. One of our wedding photos. It was the same one that used to hang in the hallway, the one with me in my gray suit and Audrey in her white lace dress. I could see her smile through the cracked glass — but there were stab holes all through it. Dozens of them. Each one small and precise, clustered around her own image.

A knife was still sticking out of the frame.

I froze.

The handle was old wood, worn smooth from years of use. There was something written on it in black ink — four small letters, crooked and childish:

**COZY.**

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. My brain felt like it had shut off, like it was trying to spare me from understanding what I was looking at.

The smell was stronger now. Sweet and bitter. Something that didn’t belong in a house.

My hand shook as I reached for the knife, but I couldn’t bring myself to touch it. I just crouched there staring at the word, at the little flakes of dried something clinging to the blade.

Behind me, the floor creaked.

I turned, heart in my throat.

Nothing.

I stood up fast, nearly knocking over a stack of books. My breath came in short bursts.

I backed toward the doorway, keeping my eyes on the pile by the recliner.

**COZY.**
