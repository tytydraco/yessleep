I am a nerd, a guy who was the “good boy ” from the beginning of my studying career, my student life, all the time. But I am extremely bad at social, I think everyone else will betray me and can’t be reliable, except for my achievements on papers. In the expectation of my parents, my teachers, and my professors. I grew up, I graduated, and I became a teacher like them.

My parents felt proud of me. But to me, I sometimes felt life is dull and inactive, boredom, the daily routine makes me bored, the same thing repeated again and again and again. My boredom told me I need to seeking for something, out of my long life of books and lectures.

I been assigned with another guy called Bob, he was as boring as I was. Even worse, he can’t make sense of gaming or some leisure activities, I thought. We often work to the midnight together, but without any nice entertainment after work.

One day, I can’t tolerate it anymore, but perhaps it is the worst thing I have ever done since my perfect performance at every stage of life. I regretted until today.

There are really just a few days before Halloween, the festival long forgotten since my childhood. Today, it been picked up by me again, in a way more interesting, but bizarre, or disturbing. As I thought after.

I cut a piece of paper into the shape of an oval, yes, really a nice oval, as perfect as my life. I made some holes in it, making it as scary as I could, then I used my finest skill to achieve the maximum effect under the dim light of our office. The simplest plan for punishing another boring nerds just done.

During the night, Bob was also working very late; his students had an exam, including writing, massive writing, and he had to mark them tonight. I opened the door swiftly but quietly. Tried to make the sound as low as possible, as a mice sneak from the shadows of the kitchen.

I close to him, waiting, with the mask on my face, waiting, patiently, and imagine what his face will be like, his terrified face, even might not achieve my goal. But at least entertainment enough tonight, some nice stimuli,

Finally, after 10 mins which passed like eternity, he turned his back, and, certainly, being shocked, his face turned pale, like the paper, his eyes opened as large as the moon, his mouth big enough to put the whole egg inside. His screaming amused me, he just fell on the floor and looked like he shortness of breath when he pressed his chest.

I felt a bit myself. I don’t want to be a murderer when his breath went thin. I took off the mask in a hurry. And squatted down, put my hand on his back to comfort him. “I am so sorry, Bob. I did not mean to be like that. I am Mike, you know, and I was just trying to play a trick or trick game tonight. Are you ok? Are you ok?”

But what he said truly terrified me.

“No, I am not ok, my nice colleague, I know it was you, from the time you came into the room with that childish mask. I am not afraid of you, what I fear”.

His face pale more this time, his breath seemed more violent, more frequent because of fear, and from his shivering mouth, he spoke a word one by one.

“What… I fear… isn’t you, is…the…mask at…at… You back!”

His finger pointed at my back as his expression went to a bizarre state of fright, with shivering. I also turned around slowly.

There wasn’t just darkness at my back; there was a man, or exactly, a man with a mask, the mask the same as mine, but more terrified, closer to the nightmarish figure. The figure was tall, very tall reach the sky, in its emotionless, pale face, twisted nose and eyes, they seemed like been pressed together, but his eyes, his eyes were the most terrified.

His eyes don’t have any white part, only darkness; the abyss is glaring me,

and I am glaring back.
