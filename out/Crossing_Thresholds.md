I was 11 when doorways… broke. I mean 'broke' in the sense that they no longer consistently worked the way doorways are supposed to. It’s hard to explain. It started with little things. The first time I remember something strange happening, I had walked from the kitchen into the living room and as I passed the threshold, suddenly there was this vase of flowers on the table that I was sure hadn’t been there the moment before. They were large, bright sunflowers and I had no idea how I could have missed them, but they were clearly there, and so I figured I just hadn’t been paying attention. I was only 11, after all. Everything else seemed fine. I put it out of my head.

After that day, however, similar things started to happen more frequently. Or maybe I just noticed them more. Mostly it was little things. I would follow my mom through a door and suddenly she was wearing a different shirt than she had been a moment ago. Or her hairstyle had changed. One notable time it was suddenly dyed fiery red, when it had been its usual brown before we left the house. I would search everywhere for my favorite stuffed animal, only to find it sitting in its normal place on my bed when I gave up and went back to my room. I would go downstairs to watch my favorite show, only to be told that it always aired on Thursdays, not Fridays even though I was certain of the timing. That sort of thing happened so often that my parents began to worry that something was wrong with my memory. They took me to a series of specialists and had a bunch of tests done, but if anything, they found that my memory was better than average. The conversation then shifted to discussions about hallucinations and a possible psychiatric diagnosis. At that point, I pretty much stopped mentioning when something unusual happened. But that didn’t mean the incidents stopped. For a long time, I just tried to pretend nothing was wrong. It was easy as long as the changes were small. But occasionally, something shifted that was difficult to ignore. Not just a missing item, or a different colored shirt, but a change that mattered to me. One that hurt.

The first time that happened I was 16. I had just started dating my first real boyfriend. He was a sweet guy named Shawn from my homeroom class and we had gone on several dates. The morning it happened, I woke up to get ready for school and noticed that the bracelet he gave me the week before was missing. I was sure I had left it on my desk yesterday, but I realized I hadn’t checked for it after I entered my room to get ready for bed. I cursed, knowing something must have shifted the last time I entered the room. I wasn’t sure how I was going to explain that to Shawn, but I hoped he would understand. I had a reputation for misplacing things and being absent minded, so it wouldn’t really be a surprise. I showed up a bit early to school, hoping to talk to him alone, but when I got to his locker, he was there with Shannon McGuire. I remember the way he smiled, then leaned in and kissed her. Bracelet forgotten, I stormed over and demanded to know how long he had been cheating on me. The fact that we had only been dating for about a month really limited the possibilities, but I wasn’t thinking about that at the time. Shawn just looked at me with genuine confusion and asked what I was talking about. He and Shannon had been exclusive for a full year, in fact today was their anniversary. Shannon showed off her bracelet with a sneer, apparently concluding that I was simply delusional and pathetic, having some imaginary relationship with her boyfriend. At least I knew why the bracelet wasn’t on my desk.

I went home sick from school that day. I cried all afternoon but wouldn’t tell my parents what was wrong. They wouldn’t have understood, anyway. How could they? How could I ever explain that for me, every doorway had at least a small chance of depositing me in the room I was aiming for, but in an alternate reality, where things were somewhat different from the one I had been in only moments before. Mostly, these alternate realities were close enough that it was hard to even notice the differences, but not always. Most concerningly, I had no control over when this happened, or what changed, and no way to tell how many times I had accidentally slipped between realities since all this started. I often wonder what my life is like in the reality I came from originally, but I don’t even know where that place is. The only things I can be sure won’t change or disappear whenever I cross a threshold are the things I have on my person. Those travel with me, but for everything else, all bets are off. Unfortunately, that is also true for people.

The weekend of my 21^(st) birthday I travelled home from university to visit my parents. That was a tough time in my life, honestly. I was still coming to terms with how my… condition was going to affect the rest of my life. I had already started calculating the most efficient path of travel in every situation, to minimize door crossings in my day-to-day life. I was careful to never double back and if I forgot something in my room, well I would just have to do without it for the day. It helped, but in modern society, you can’t really avoid all doorways. This meant that, despite my efforts, there was a decent chance that any assignment I turned in was at least partially incorrect because the questions had changed subtly between when I received it and when I handed it in. I also missed a lot of tests when scheduling changes occurred and flaked on a lot of ‘plans’ I had made with people. As a result, I hadn’t made many friends at school, and those I did manage to make had a nasty tendency to forget that I even existed at random intervals. So, I was very glad to be home with people who loved me and were mostly used to my… odd behavior.

I slept in late on Saturday morning, and when I came down for breakfast, something was wrong. My mom had made banana pancakes for my birthday every year for as long as I could remember, but this year there was nothing cooking when I came down. I will admit I was disappointed, but these types of changes happened to me so often that I was also kind of used to it. So, I simply headed to the pantry to make some myself and found a strange woman emerging with a can of beets. I said hello cautiously, and she smiled, wished me a happy birthday and slipped past me into the kitchen. She seemed to know me, so I figured my parents must have a ‘new’ friend. It wasn’t the first time that had happened, so I didn’t think much of it. Until I returned to the kitchen with my pancake ingredients to find her sitting with my dad, her hand touching his cheek in a way that was clearly intimate. My dad smiled and wished me a happy birthday, but I barely heard him. Part of me already knew what had happened, and I knew I shouldn’t say anything about it. It wouldn’t end well. But I just couldn’t stop myself from asking where mom was. I watched my father’s face fall. I heard him remind me, with pity in his voice, that she had died 5 years ago. That surely I remembered my stepmother, Veronica. I didn’t stay to hear any more.

No one understood why I was suddenly grieving for my mother as if her death had only just occurred. Certainly no one understood why I spent 2 days continually walking in and out of rooms, back and forth across the threshold until I collapsed. It didn’t work. Maybe there was no way to go back. Maybe the odds were just so low that it would never practically happen. Either way, it took me a long time, but I came to accept that my mom was truly gone. It helped to know that somewhere out there, she was still alive, living her life, even if I can’t be there with her. It also helped to think that there is a version of me that woke up that day to find that their mother was suddenly alive again. I just hope it isn’t the ‘me’ I am worried it is.

You know how people say you are often your own worst enemy? I think that may be more literal for me than for some people. More than once, after a shift, I have found signs that something… unsettling has happened before I arrived. I don’t know if that is because I am always following behind the same person, or if many versions of myself have broken, like the doorways, under the strain of our shared situation. All I know is that sometimes I think I have done terrible things. It’s frustrating, because there isn’t really anything I can do to stop it. I just have to follow in behind and clean up the mess. Deal with the angry spouses, or the vandalism charges or the lawsuits. Which means I don’t just have to worry about the universe screwing me over, but another version of myself, too.

There wasn’t much I could do though. So, I just tried to manage my condition as best as I could. I avoided getting too close to anyone, because there is no way to tell if they will even know me tomorrow, or if ‘I’ will do something to hurt them. I even pulled away from my family. My dad thinks I developed a sudden dislike of my stepmother, Monica, and it isn’t like I could explain that that isn’t the problem, or that I liked Veronica better. He doesn’t even remember who Veronica was. I also started carrying everything most precious to me in a small backpack everywhere I go. Anything I don’t have on me could disappear at any time. So, I guess you can probably imagine that I have a pretty minimalist lifestyle. I live in a studio apartment, I work from home, order most of my groceries delivered and don’t go out much. The more I can minimize doorways, the less chaos gets injected into my life. The only separate room is the bathroom. I tried taking the door off the hinges, but I have found that as long as the doorway is still there, it doesn’t really make a difference. I doubted my landlord would let me demolish a wall, so I just put the door back on. At least I had minimized my problems. But minimized and eliminated aren’t the same thing.

Which is how I ended up in my current situation. I woke up today and everything was fine. My apartment was a bit messy, of course; it usually isn’t worth it to spend too much time cleaning when it can so easily be undone, but nothing was out of place. I took a quick shower and emerged to find myself in a scene from a horror movie. My main room was spattered in blood and there was a dead body lying on my kitchen floor in a rapidly spreading pool of red. I was certain that hadn’t been there when I went in to the bathroom. I didn’t even know who the guy was. But it didn’t matter, did it? It was my problem now. And I apparently wasn’t the only one who knew that, because on the wall above my bed, scrawled in what I can only assume was blood, was the message ‘Good Luck! :)’

Well, at least now I know it is intentional. The ‘me’ that goes before knows that they can do whatever they want and then leave the fallout for someone else to deal with. Have they figured out a way to control it, somehow? They must have, otherwise how could they be sure they could escape? I have entered and exited the bathroom a hundred times since I found the body and haven’t been able to shift it away. If there is a way to control this, maybe I can turn the tables. Maybe I can reverse directions and find her, the one who did this, and stop her before she kills again. Maybe I can even find my way back to the people I have lost along the way. But I suspect that is going to have to wait. I can hear the sirens outside. The police will be here any minute. How can I possibly explain that I didn’t do this? Actually, did I technically do this? If the killer was me, but a different me who is now gone, I suppose in some ways I am the only one left to be held responsible. But I need to find a way out of this, if I want to stop it from happening again. I’ve heard that reddit is a good place for legal advice, so if anyone knows a good defense attorney with a very open mind, hit me up. If they let me keep my phone, I’ll try to check in.
