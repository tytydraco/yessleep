I don’t even know how to start this. I’m not looking for attention, just… maybe someone out there has experienced something like this.

I live in a really rural part of northern Arizona. Middle of nowhere, lots of forests, lots of silence. My family has a cabin about five miles from the nearest paved road. It’s peaceful, usually.

Last weekend, my older brother, Jake, came up to visit. We grew up coming to this cabin, so we were just going to spend the weekend drinking beer and hiking old trails like we did when we were kids.

Everything was normal until Saturday night.

We had a fire going out back, just sitting around like old times. Jake got up and said he was going to take a leak in the woods. He had a flashlight, so I didn’t think anything of it. Maybe 10 minutes went by. Still no Jake.

I shouted his name—no answer.

So I went inside to grab another light and head out after him. As I’m about to step off the porch, I hear him.

Or I thought I did.

“Hey, come out here!”

The voice was about 30 yards into the woods. It sounded like Jake. But… off. Like when someone’s mimicking a voice they heard once but don’t quite remember the rhythm of it. Like a bad impression.

I stopped. “Jake?”

The voice didn’t answer this time. Just silence.

Then it said again, louder, “HEY. COME OUT HERE.”

But it sounded… excited. Almost angry? I don’t know how to explain it. There was this gurgle in the voice, like it had water in its lungs.

I was frozen on the porch.

Then—Jake walks out of the trees from behind the cabin, zippered up and holding his flashlight.

He looked at me weird because I was white as a ghost. I asked him if he had just called for me. He said no, he’d just been taking a piss and thought I went inside.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The next day, I walked out to where the voice had come from. About 30 yards in, I found a deer carcass. Or what was left of it. The skin had been peeled off in one piece. Like a rug. The meat was untouched. No blood.

Jake said we should leave. We did.

That was last weekend.

Now here’s the worst part. Last night, I was outside my house (not the cabin—my actual home, over 100 miles away) taking the trash out.

And from the woods behind my property, I swear to God…

I heard my brother’s voice.

“Hey. Come out here.”

After the cabin incident, I told Jake what I heard behind my house, and he just looked at me like he already knew. He told me not to talk about it online, not to write it down, not to acknowledge it. He said that when you speak about it, it pays attention.

Well, screw that, because whatever this thing is — it already knows where I live.

Last night, around 2 a.m., my dog started going crazy at the back door. Barking, growling, pacing. I live alone, and there’s nothing but woods behind my house for about a quarter mile. I grabbed my flashlight, opened the door, and just stood there.

Nothing. Silence.

I should’ve left it at that.

But I had this feeling — like I was being watched. And I swear to God, the air felt… thick. Like soup. I stepped off the porch and walked toward the trees. Maybe 100 meters in, I stopped.

That’s when it hit me.

The air got so heavy I was gasping, like I couldn’t catch a full breath. My throat burned. Then this stench—oh God. Like rotting meat that’d been left in the sun for a week. Pure death. It filled my nose and clung to my clothes. Every instinct in me screamed run.

I turned and started walking back toward the house.

Then I saw it.

Something darted from my left, fast, deeper into the trees. I froze mid-step. I didn’t even try to make sense of it — I just ran. Branches whipped at my arms, the ground was uneven, but I didn’t care. I just needed to get the hell out of there.

As I got closer to the tree line, I noticed the air clearing. The smell started to fade. I slowed to catch my breath. I’m a heavy smoker, and my lungs were screaming at me. I was maybe 20 feet from the clearing behind my house.

Then it stepped out in front of me.

I didn’t hear it coming. It didn’t growl or make a sound. It just appeared. My back porch light must’ve sensed the motion because it clicked on — and that’s when I saw it.

At first, my brain tried to register it as a man. But it wasn’t. It was twice the size of a man, hunched, with elongated limbs that bent too many times. Its skin was like dried-out leather, stretched tight over bones that jutted out in the wrong places.

Its head was the worst part. Lumpy and malformed, like a melted Halloween mask. Its eyes — if you can call them that — were pits. Hollow. But somehow, they were looking at me.

It crouched there, maybe ten feet away, and then tilted its head up toward the sky — like a wolf howling at the moon.

Its mouth opened wide.

But instead of a scream, or a roar, it just mimicked my brother’s voice. Perfectly.

“Hey… come out here…”

Over and over again. Same tone, same inflection. Like it had recorded the words and was playing them back through broken speakers.

I couldn’t move. My legs locked up. It was like my brain had disconnected from my body.

It crawled a step closer. Still squatting. Still staring.

Then it twitched. Like a glitch in a video file. One frame it was crouched — the next, it was closer.

That broke the spell.

I ran. I don’t even remember how I made it inside. I just remember locking the door and collapsing on the kitchen floor.

I didn’t sleep.

And I don’t think it’s done with me.

There’s something else too… when I woke up this morning, my back door was unlocked.

I know I locked it.
