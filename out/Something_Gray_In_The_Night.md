This happened in North Eastern Oklahoma within the cherokee reservation around 2008 in the beginning of fall. Myself and 8 other of my friends I went to school with had all met up at a friend's house to hang out for the night around a campfire and listen to music ect we are all about 15/16 years old. My friend had a trail that went maybe over a quarter of a mile into the woods where it led to a opened circle in the wooded area. There was a fire pit there with a single tree and another trail that led south from the opening where we would be hanging out for the night. 

We sat aound doing this and that bull shitting into the night and may I remind you we are not partying. No booze no smoke no nothing just 9 of us out in the woods having a good time. It gets around 230 or 3 and things changed. We are all up having a good time and my friend Tjohn gets up and heads to the entrance of that south trail at the edge of the cut out to take a piss. I just happen to look up from the fire and turn to look at  and up from him in the trail this gray figuer stood in front of him about 20 yards away. I asked him quietly if he saw it and he looks up and comes back to the fire with the rest of us. My eyes are lock on this figuer standing in the dark.

This thing standing about 7ft tall gray with a static cloudy look to it. It's legs started about where the bottom of one's chest plate would be, long lanky arms which lay down almost to where it's knees would be with black hollow eyes with no mouth or nose. All 9 of us are staring at this thing and noone can move. Some started to cry some kept there heads down but I kept my eyes right on it. Looking at this thing while it stood there looking right back at us. It moved horizontally to the right into the woods off the south trail slowly moving around. It got to a part in the woods that during the day you could see was about a 7ft rock wall. When it approached that it hovered over this wall with no struggle at all and then it slowly back off into the depths of the dark woods and faded away. We didn't leave that fire until the sun came up and we got out of there as fast as we could.  

We didn't talk about that night for years after that. We kept it to ourselves and I only telling it to people who was close to me. 15+ years later I had asked some of the people who was there if they remembered what happened and what we witnessed and everyone of them remember exactly what it looked like and exactly what it did. 9 of us saw something in those woods that night and it saw us as well. 

That's my story of a real encounter of something I can not explain other then seeing it with my own eyes and having 8 other people with me who saw the same thing. Who knows what it was?

Iv put this story on other subs and I just wanted to share it with you as well.
