I know. I know what you're thinking: if I know what happened, why haven't I called the police? Why haven't I told anyone? They're holding a vigil for him tomorrow night, thinking they might find his body, but I know they won't. And I know I won't go. 

Mitchell Sinclair was an asshole.
 
You're not supposed to speak ill of the dead, either, but, well, there it is. The world is a better place without him in it. It's been eating me up inside watching everyone pretend he was so good and so sweet. If he was either of those things, he wouldn't be dead. I'm posting here now to let someone -- anyone -- know the truth. Maybe, if they end up in the same place I was, this will help them. 

I was at the party. The one he was last seen at, the one at the Dermott place on 2nd Ave. I arrived around nine with my roommate Clara, and some of her friends. I had planned on spending the night at home catching up on sleep after finals, but Clara insisted this would be better for me. Of course she would think that. Clara, at five foot nothing, with her curly red hair and dark eyes rimmed by too much eyeliner, was a hit at any party she went to. It helped, too, that she wore less and less clothing as the night went on. That night, she wore a slinky, sparkly grey skirt and a black bralette, and a jean jacket. The jacket was coated in patches, everything from UFOs to dancing pigs. She told me once that, when she was a Girl Scout, she learned how to iron-on a patch, and the obsession kicked off there. She was petite, with a heart-shaped face and soft features, but dressed in sharp, dark, loud things. An intoxicating contradiction that lured men (and some women) in. 

I liked going out with Clara. With all eyes on her, there were none left to belittle me. I was -- am -- gangly, all knees and elbows. It probably doesn't help that my wardrobe is almost entirely baggy hoodies and leggings, like what I wore then. 

At this point you might be asking yourself, *Did I really need all that detail?* And the answer is yes, because you know the first thing people ask when this sort of bullshit happens is, "Well, what were you wearing?"

A hoodie. I was wearing a dark blue hoodie, your honor, with my favorite podcast's logo on the front, and black leggings that hugged my nonexistent ass. But let the record show, whether I was wearing a hoodie or a bralette like Clara, I didn't fucking deserve what happened to me. 

Clara stayed with me when we first arrived. She squeezed my hand, smiling as we walked in, and said, "Try not to look like you're at the morgue, okay?"

I must have grunted something in response. The Dermott place was huge -- two stories, a backyard connected to acres of woodland out back, a wraparound front porch. Jake Dermott was a fraternity pledge, I think, and the party was part of his initiation. That, or the frat realized how easy it would be to score a free venue off the loaded freshman. Clara and I had both skipped out on the sorority scene, but she was still friends with (and being scouted by) a few sisters. 

The noise when we walked in was deafening. Somewhere in the house an all too expensive sound system was being abused into playing trap music. The walls shook with the bass. A makeshift dance floor came into view in what must have been the living room -- the few couches in the room had been pressed to the walls, where some couples made out or were clearly about to. The center of the room was packed with bodies - flailing arms, swinging hips. The lights had been dimmed but someone had replaced the main bulb with a black light, so their laughing mouths glowed in the blue-dark.

A honey-blonde dressed in hot pink approached Clara almost the moment we entered the kitchen. She had a half-empty bottle of vodka in one hand, and a red solo cup in the other. She squealed at the sight of her, pushing forward to kiss the air by her cheek. "Hello gorgeous!" she gushed. "Where did you get that skirt?" 

"Thrifting," Clara said, waving her hand. "I love turning something old new."

"Ugh, and I bet everything fits you on the first try, you bitch," the blonde sighed, as if she wasn't shaped like a mannequin herself. Her gaze flickered to me for a fraction of a second, assessing, trying to place me. I waved, barely raising my hand past my elbow. There was a kitchen island behind her with a population of liquor bottles and mixers, and I was more interested in conversing with them. 

"Have you met my roomie?" Clara said, wrapping a hand around my waist. She leaned her head on me; the height difference landed her just beneath my shoulders. "This is Hannah. It took me literally all night to convince her to come, so, puh-lease play nice."

The blonde's demeanor shifted almost immediately. Clara's seal of approval could do that. She beamed at me and held out the vodka in her hand. "So nice to meet you! I'm Liz. Wanna take a shot?" 

I nodded. Taking a shot with someone was key to building a rapport. Liz whirled around, and procured three plastic shot cups. She lay them on the counter and poured from the bottle, a little too heavy handed. "Liz, that's definitely a double," Clara laughed.

"You both need to catch up!" She pressed the plastic into our hands, then paused. "You need a chaser, hon?" The question was directed to me, as Liz nodded to her solo cup. I could see now it was full of some kind of fruit punch. I shook my head. Clara took a can of Sprite off the counter and cracked it open. 

"No chaser? You're a real party girl, huh?" Liz said, elbowing me. 

Despite myself, I laughed. "I don't drink much so, when I do, I wanna taste it."

"You're a better woman than me," she said, shaking her head. She couldn't have possibly meant it, but it was sweet of her to say regardless. That was what killed me about these sorority girls. TV and movies had taught me girls that pretty must also be catty and mean, but, the truth is, they weren't. Not most of them, anyway. Most of them just wanted you to have as good of a time as they were, and have someone to stumble home giggling with at the end of a long night. I still don't really buy into the sorority thing overall, but girls like Liz sold me on sisterhood. 

We took two rounds of shots with Liz in the kitchen. The vodka burned down my throat and made me feel a little light-headed. I felt myself starting to relax, to laugh easier with Liz and not cling so much to Clara. I could tell she was anxious to get to the dance floor, but she didn't want to abandon me. I think she was hoping Liz would take me under her wing for a little while, or at least keep me entertained. Unfortunately, that isn't what happened. 

Mitchell Sinclair happened. He sidled into the kitchen with one arm around Jake's shoulders, and another gesturing wildly. "Swear to God, man, he jumped that high," he had been saying, his words only a little slurred. I'll give Mitchell this much: he was nice to look at. He had dark hair cropped short, and sharp, angular features that reminded one of a Greek sculpture. He was broad-shouldered and muscular. I think I heard he was part of some recreational rugby team. His green eyes were a little glassy in that telltale "has had a few drinks" sort of way but, at that point, so were mine. He lit up when he spotted Clara and Liz. 

"Little Red! You made it!" He tossed Jake aside like a forgotten toy to scoop Clara into his arms. I nearly squeaked in surprise. He dwarfed her by at least two feet, and picked her up like it was nothing. He pulled her in for a hug. 

Clara screamed, but it seemed to be with delight. She pounded on his chest with tiny, trivial fists. His hands were under her jacket, I realized. "Get your hands off me, Mitch!" she giggled, wiggling in his grasp. "Buy a girl dinner first!"

"I would if you'd let me," he said, but he let her down all the same. He looked vaguely embarrassed. "I was just too excited to see you."

Clara rolled her eyes. I turned away to mix myself a drink, tapping the tops of bottles to see which seemed to still be sealed. I kept one eye on Clara and Mitchell, just in case, but I had no desire to draw any more attention to myself. Behind them, I saw Liz wrapping her arms around Jake, and assuring him he was hosting a "fantastic" party. Jake's hands were on her back, but creeping steadily downward. 

"Have you met my roomie, Em?" she said, jerking her chin towards me. I gave a little nod in acknowledgement, but didn't tear my eyes away from the monstrosity I was mixing. Equal parts fruit juice and soda water, with a spritz of gin...

"I don't think so. Hi, roomie Em." He had stepped closer. I could smell his cologne - pungent, musky, a bit like pine. I looked over my shoulder and found myself trapped between him and the counter. I felt my face flush. His body filled my vision. I was only a few inches shorter than him, but I felt so much smaller. 

"Hi," I said, mostly into my cup as I raised it to my lips for a quick sip. Mitch's lip quirked, like he was fighting a smile. 

"Em is going to be a district attorney one day," Clara said, turning her attention to the counter. She tapped absently at a nearly empty bottle of orange juice. "She's smarter than you and every boy in your stupid frathouse combined."

"That's not saying much," Mitch said. He hadn't taken his eyes off me, while I was doing everything I could not to look at him. I didn't want to turn back to the counter, giving him my back. I couldn't excuse myself away. I glared at Clara to rescue me. 

"Does your roomie Em dance?" he asked, still looking at me. 

"Absolutely not." "No, she doesn't." Clara and I responded at the same time. 

Mitch nodded. "Yeah, that's what I thought," he said. "But Clara does. Can I keep you company instead?"

Here's where that thing about sisterhood versus sorority comes out. Sisterhood would be recognizing that I needed a life jacket right then, and to not leave me alone with the shark circling me. Clara must have known this. But her eyes, turned to me, were pleading. Sisterhood for *her* would be recognizing that she couldn't babysit my the entire night, and it was up to me to curate my own company. And, if I was reading that quirk of her eyebrow correctly, it was also acknowledging that the full devastating power of her skirt could only be released on the dance floor. 

Mitch must have sensed me wavering. "The porch out back is a little quieter," he added. "If you need a break from the noise."

Your honor, I chose sisterhood. I gave Clara the tiniest nod. I would be okay. I could handle myself. I thought... I really thought, at the time, that I could handle myself. 

She bumped me with her hip. "I'll come check on you in a bit, okay? Don't leave without me."

I nodded. "Yeah, okay." My head kept moving when I was done nodding. The drinks were starting to hit my system, making all of my muscles a little slower to respond. I watched Clara tear Liz away from Jake -- the hero had managed to get his hands on her ass, but he didn't enjoy it for long. The girls linked arms, joining the gyrating mass in the living room. 

Mitch was still in front of me. "You look like you need to sit down," he said, and he almost sounded genuinely concerned.

"You don't have to sit with me," I said. Gin kept me honest. "I'm good on my own."

He seemed to consider that, looking me up and down. I was gripping the counter to remain steady and still. When he left, I could stumble to one of the couches on the living room, and sip my drink in peace while keeping an eye on Clara. The pounding music might give me a headache but the entire evening would leave me hungover anyway. But... Mitchell wouldn't allow himself to be shaken off so easily.

"Let me walk you to the porch," he pressed. "Take a seat, get some fresh air."

"You really don't have to."

"And what if I want to?"

I narrowed my eyes at him, but before I could respond, his hand was on my wrist. He encircled my arm easily, effortlessly. He didn't pull me forward, just held his hand here. He felt warm. "My head hurts," he said. "I was going there either way. Come with me."

His face was a little red, presumably from the drinking, and his eyes were still glassy. I wondered how much it would take for a man of his size to get properly trashed. He must have been drinking for hours. I thought -- as ridiculous as this sounds -- I thought maybe he needed me to look out for him. So. I agreed. I know. It was so stupid. I let the giant take me by the arm and lead me out. We traipsed through a maze of rooms and screaming partygoers: laughing gaggles of sorority girls in matching colors; a keg stand in a den; a group playing King's Cup in the corner; a home karaoke set-up that was really just a Smart TV playing instrumentals off YouTube in a bedroom. Finally there was a small back door and we emerged on the back porch, facing acres and acres of woodland. 

I was surprised at what a relief the sight was. I needed the fresh air after all. Seeing me look it over, I heard Mitchell say, his voice a whisper like he was telling me a secret, “There’s a lake in the middle of all that, believe it or not.”

“Yeah?” I hadn’t turned to face him. The world was still spinning somehow, from that one drink. I felt my heart racing. I wasn’t normally such a lightweight. 

His hands were on my hips, skimming upwards. I felt his breath tickle my ear. “Want me to show  you?”

I tried to pull away from him, but the signals between my mind and my muscles were delayed. I felt myself tug against him sluggishly, in slow motion, and he laughed. He tightened his hold on my hips, dragging me back into him and thrusting against me. 

“Don’t be like that,” he purred. 

“Get your hands off me, you pig,” I said, though my words came out a jumbled slur. It occurred to me what I was feeling was more than just drunk. I took a drug test a few days later and it confirmed what then I only suspected.

“It’s so cute how you pretend not to want this,” he laughed. My limbs were growing heavier. His hands scaled up my skin, skimming up to my shoulders. I turned and bit his hand as hard as I could.

“Bitch!” He let go. My mouth filled with the tangy copper of blood. I threw myself off the porch, and down into the wilds. I heard him swear, then the rapid rustling of approaching footsteps behind me.

I stumbled blindly through the woods, my palms outstretched to guide me. Branches tore at my legs, scraped up my arms. Her world was blurred by tears. The air was thick and hot, and my muscles ached with every step. My feet clambered over overgrown roots, scrambling across loose rocks and dirt as quickly as I could. 

Until one rock slipped away from me, and suddenly the world was spent spinning around. My scream was cut short as the wind was knocked from my chest. The forest itself seemed to claw at me as I went down; for an absurd moment, I wondered whether it was trying to slow me down, or taking advantage of her tumble.

I tucked in my knees and managed to slow to a roll. The trees had given way to a small clearing, and my reaching hands found purchase in soft grass. I gasped, pulling herself up to sit. The dim light of the moon seemed like a spotlight now that I was out of the trees. I heard the telltale whisper of running water, and slowly scanned the area around me.

The path behind seemed darker and impossible to return through. It was hard to imagine a party was raging at the end of it. 

Before me there was a dark abyss of water. A river cut through the woods east of her, running downhill. Part of it snaked away and filled the small lake. The water seemed unnaturally still. I had managed to halt a few feet from the water’s edge. I swore. Of all the places, this was one I knew that asshole knew about.

The adrenaline of my fall was wearing off, and all I could think was I needed to hide. Hide before I passed out. The footsteps behind me were pounding closer. 

There was a cluster of shrubs not too far from the water’s edge. I crawled into it, holding my breath. Even as I crumpled into the bush, I looked around for a better hiding place, or a stick I could use as a weapon or… or… This was when things got weird. 

This was when I saw her. 

She was hovering just beneath the water’s surface. Her body seemed made of shadow. I would have missed her entirely had it not been for her eyes. Two gleaming green eyes peeked at me from within the water. She blinked, one eye closing half a second before the other, like a lizard’s. It was hard to tell what more of her there was, or how I even knew it was a *her.* I just did. I just knew. 

 I knew what I was looking at wasn’t human. Just something that was very good at looking like one. I froze in her gaze. 

Several yards away, Mitch Sinclair bulldozed in. “Olly olly oxen-free!” he called out, still laughing. There was a thin trail of blood dripping down his right hand. His clothes were dotted with dirt and leaves, scraped from the woods.

My eyes flickered to him, then back to the creature in the water. She was still looking at me. A pair of red lips came into view beneath the eyes, and a gnarled finger appeared in front of them. She held the finger to her lips and smiled. *Stay quiet.* She seemed to say. 

The eyes then closed, one after the other, and I watched the shadow move. 

This next part is going to sound insane, because it was. And I know I admitted to you already that I was drunk, and I was high, and I was freaking the fuck out. But I swear this is what I saw. 

Mitchell had noticed the bushes, and was starting to make his way towards them. It was the closest to the water’s edge. I held my breath, watching him advance. He had definitely seen me. My hiding spot was pisspoor. My legs were still sticking out on the pebbly shore. “I could have brought you here the easy way,” he said. “But that’s okay. This was fun.”

I wanted to squeeze my eyes shut, and imagine I was somewhere else. Anywhere else. But the shadow in the water was rising. It was as if the surface of the water were made from plastic, and there she was, stretching it out with her palms. A feminine figure took shape, molded from the surface tension. The green eyes reappeared, curtained by black tendrils of hair that stuck to her head like wet ink. She had no nose. The rest of water remained still, as though turned to glass. She stepped forward. 

Her hands ended in jagged points. She seemed to have fins on her forearms and legs. Her gaze was locked on Mitchell. 

“I brought another girl here once,” Mitchell said. He put a hand on my ankle and dragged me out. I could already feel myself fading from consciousness, but I fought to stay afloat. Every pebble that knocked into my head helped me stay awake. The blood from my bite left a  print on my sock. Behind him, still moving silently, the creature advanced.

“She wasn’t as fun,” Mitchell said. “So I let her go for a swim instead. Is that what you want, roomie Em? To go for a swim?”

I opened my mouth to reply but no sound came out. She was behind him. In an eerie replica of how Mitchell had grabbed me, she had put both her hands on his hips. He jolted at the touch, whirling to look behind him. He screamed. 

It all happened so quickly. She opened her mouth, revealing rows and rows of razer teeth. Her jaw seemed to unhinge, widening her gaping maw, and she snapped down on his shoulder. Blood spurted from his shoulder, and he kept screaming. She didn’t seem to like that. 

She took her jaw to his throat instead, snatching it away in one horrifying bite. The scream turned wet then ended, abruptly, as his head hit the pebbled shore. 

My eyelids were growing heavier. I blinked, watching the scene unravel in bursts. 

She was gnawing at his shoulder, gorging herself on him. Her claws shredded his skin.

*Blink.*

His head, frozen in terror, rolled to the side, staring at me. 

*Blink.*

The body half gone. The creature on all fours, sucking and slurping up the blood from the shore. 

*Blink.*

The woman closer to me. Too close. I was too dazed to cry out. Her skin shimmered like she was made herself of dark, murky water. Like, if I were to touch her, she burst like a bubble. Maybe she would. The blood had tinged the depths around her mouth and chest dark red. She was crouched over me, balancing on the balls of her feet. She was peeling off my sock, the one stained with Mitchell’s blood. Her hands had become smaller, looking more like normal fingers, and the touch was gentle. 

She looked at me. She raised the finger to her lips again. 

I blacked out.

When I woke up hours later, it was morning, and I felt like absolute shit. I thought maybe I had dreamed the whole thing. 

But my sock was still missing. 

And so was Mitchell Sinclair.
