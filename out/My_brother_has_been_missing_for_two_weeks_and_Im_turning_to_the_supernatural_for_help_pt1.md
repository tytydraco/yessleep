I guess I should explain a little bit first.. My brother works for a county Sheriff’s Office somewhere in Maine and his apartment exploded in the middle of the night just under two weeks ago. His remains were **not** found inside and no one has seen him since, but I *know* he’s still alive. I don’t know who took him or why they torched his apartment, I just *know* he’s out there. Somewhere. And if you try to tell me anything otherwise I’m not going to listen.

Our town is a slow sleepy tourist trap of a place, everything is within walking distance and everyone is really friendly. Charles is also very popular with the townsfolk and since his disappearance the support I’ve received has been incredible. I’ve lost count of how many people have bought me home baked goods, offered clothes or a place to stay. Even our parents tried to get in contact with me about him (I ignored their attempts though because, f\* ck them. They don’t get to do what they did then show up all concerned like they care). Anyway. My point is that I can’t think of any reason anyone would want to hurt him. 

However, despite that, there are still some people who are saying he ‘disappeared himself’. He was involved in an accident with a civilian while off duty a few weeks back. Basically a teenage girl got shot and Charles was suspended. So there are people that think he set fire to his own place and ran away, but that’s just not true! Charley wouldn’t do that! Or if he did, he wouldn’t do it without telling me! 

At the moment I’m staying at a hotel with two of Charley’s friends, Eric Linnaeus and Calla. Eric is something like a private investigator I suppose? He’s been out searching for Charles every day and sometimes he’s gone the entire night as well. So far he’s found nothing. Meanwhile, Calla, Eric’s friend, has been tasked with babysitting me. She’s a bodyguard or similar, I don’t really know what she is exactly, but Eric seems to think that whoever took Charles might try to take me as well.

Because of this I’m not supposed to leave the room. Now, I know they’re Charles’s friends, and I know they *mean* well, but I feel like a prisoner. They’re both so cold. Neither of them have any emotion! Eric has hardly spoken and he barely looks at me. Meanwhile Calla is strange in her own way. She only says anything when I speak directly to her and she doesn’t eat unless I give her express permission, although I’m starting to wonder if she’s just like that. I’m horrible for saying this, but they don’t behave like people. They’re more like robots, or something, and they make me feel so alone.

I spent the first few days crying into cheap hotel linens. Now the tears have dried and I have nothing left, most of the time I just lay curled up facing the wall, quietly listening to whatever show Calla found on the TV. She even watches the ads with interest - it’s like she’s never seen cable before. Anyway, this was exactly what I was doing when Eric returned. I didn’t hear him come in, so I was surprised when I felt someone sit on the bed beside me and place a hand on my shoulder to get my attention. 

“Claire-” Eric began.

“Did you find him?” I interrupted dully without turning to face him. 

“…No.” He murmured, I could hear in his voice that he was exhausted. 

“Then *what?*” I muttered under my breath. I didn’t mean to be so hostile, I was just tired and hurting.

He hesitated, pulling away, and I felt a twinge of guilt. “I haven’t found him because I *can’t* find him. Not without help. But the people I have to ask…” He trailed off. 

“What about them?” I demanded, impatient. 

“They’re very dangerous, and I need Calla to take me there. You will have to stay here alone for a time.” 

“What? No!” I sat up abruptly. “If you’re going somewhere, or if you know someone that can find him, then I’m coming with you.” 

“You don’t understand. I wouldn’t be doing this if I had any other option left. They might well kill me on sight and if you come with us, the best you can hope for is the same fate.” That got to me, something about the way he said it made me think that perhaps he himself was a little fearful of whoever he was referring to and I couldn’t imagine that there were many things he was afraid of. 

“I don’t care. If they can find my brother I’m coming with you.” I repeated, trying to sound more confident than I felt. There was no way I was going to allow him to leave me behind. 

Eric sighed and I got the impression he simply didn’t want to put any more effort into arguing. “You’re making a poor decision.” He told me bluntly, “We leave early tomorrow then. Try to rest.” 

He moved away from me to Calla then and I noticed when he did, that he was relying heavily on his cane for the first time in days. He fell into place beside her clumsily and I heard them speaking softly, though I couldn’t quite make out what was said… but it seemed to be something about an institute. 

\*\*\* 

I don’t remember falling asleep, I really didn’t even mean to. So when I awoke the following morning to raised voices I was immediately alarmed. My panic turned into confusion as I noticed Calla standing almost entirely naked in the middle of the room. She was only wearing a set of small lacy underwear and her long hair just barely covered her chest. 

“You *cannot* open the door to strangers like that!” Eric was insisting, looking annoyed more than anything as he gathered up her clothes and tossed them in her general direction.

“I thought she was a servant.” The girl responded calmly. 

“She was house keeping, Calla. She is not going to bathe or dress you!”  

“How should I know that?”

“Because this is not a castle-!” He stopped when he noticed I was awake. “This isn’t what it looks like.” 

I put my hands up, “No judgment.” 

“Claire, it really isn’t.” He insisted, exasperated. 

“I’m just going to go to the other room so you two can sort this out..” I assured. 

“Do you think this color is nice on me?” I heard Calla ask him casually, though I didn’t hear his response as I slipped into the bathroom. 

When I returned the situation seemed resolved. She was dressed again and Eric wasn’t in the room. He returned a few minutes later with car keys in his hand. “Are you ready?” he asked me calmly. 

“Yes.” I agreed without hesitation, it’s not like I had any packing to do. 

Eric’s car was, ancient, to put it politely. A shiny black vehicle with white wall tires, it's only saving grace was that the engine seemed to be entirely overhauled. Most of the drive went by in silence. Calla took the front seat beside Eric and I got the back. Which was okay, at least I could lay down. 

Also, for the record, *neither* of them are good drivers. They both drove so fast I was afraid to look at the speed. Eric tended to take corners too fast, sending me sliding across the back seat more than once and Calla drives like a New York cab driver. She cut people off mercilessly left, right and center. It wasn’t surprising that car horns were constantly directed at us. 

Overall it was a terrible car trip. We only stopped twice for fuel, and not once did we get any snacks.

However as we traveled one thing began to play on my mind. I thought that the same car had been following us almost the entire way, not only followed, but kept pace. Initially I thought I was mistaken. It was a red Ford Mustang and I saw it in glimpses on different streets. That was, until we hit a straight stretch of road somewhere between Ohio and Indiana. Then I watched it gain on us out the back window. 

“Ahh.. Eric..” I murmured trying to draw his attention to the fact that we were being chased. 

“I know.” He responded as if it didn’t interest him at all. 

At this point Calla sat up straighter, then she spoke aloud to someone not present in the car. “Yes.” There was a moment’s pause, then another, “Yes.” It sounded like she was talking on the phone to someone, only she didn’t have a phone. “No. Eric is driving.” 

“Who are you talking to?” I asked her. She ignored me entirely. 

“Don’t give him details.” Eric muttered. 

“He says he would like to race you.” 

“Not interested.” 

“Aww. You’re no fun, little Orphan.” The words came from Calla and were in her voice. But I could tell they weren’t hers. The mustang pulled ahead of us then, almost sideswiping us on the way past. Naturally I flipped that car the bird and though I couldn’t see the driver through the obnoxiously tinted windows, I was sure he got the message. 

“Try to keep up then. You only get 5 miles of grace.” Her voice was soft, but again the words weren’t hers. 

“What does he mean by that?” Eric asked, irritated.

“My contract. I cannot be more than 5 miles from him.” Calla answered. 

“Bastard.” Eric muttered, speeding up slightly in response as the red car was getting further ahead. Honestly I didn’t fully understand what was happening. However, from that time onward, we followed the mustang. Eric didn’t allow Calla to drive again and he never let that car get far enough ahead that it was out of sight. 

\*\*\* 

The next time we slowed it was when we arrived at a barrier fence that stretched long and tall across the land. The wide gates swung open for us and the mustang pulled in ahead. It looked to me as if we were approaching a pile of rubble, the ruins of some building I guessed. Then we crossed the barrier. Around us the air shimmered, it felt like my eyes were going blurry for a moment and I blinked several times. Ahead of us was now a tall dark castle. Complete with banners and guards. We pulled up beside the mustang, though its driver was already gone. Calla was the first to step out of the car. 

Eric followed shortly after her but came to stand beside my door. He opened it and leant on the frame blocking the castle out with his body as he did so. “Claire. I need you to listen to me carefully now. Stay behind me. Never, no matter the context, say that you ‘agreed to’ or with anything they say. If you are unsure. Say nothing.” he spoke in a low tone and then handed me two small earplugs. “Keep these on you. Put them in **immediately** if anyone speaks to you with anything *extra* sounding in their voice. Do you understand?” 

I wanted to come up with some sort of witty comeback, but I couldn’t manage anything more than a meek, “Alright.” I hadn’t realized how nervous I was until that moment, or perhaps it was just how tense he seemed. When he stepped back though, I felt even worse as I saw what he had been keeping from my view. The wall was lined with people pointing drawn arrows directly at us. For a moment I couldn’t make myself get out of the car. I honestly debated just staying there before I hurried to catch up to them. 

Calla walked slightly ahead of Eric, she seemed perfectly comfortable, even had a slight spring in her step. While Eric was more cautious, outwardly he didn’t look distressed at all, but I could see his eyes moving side to side as he surveyed the area subtly. I reached out to hold onto his arm but he brushed me off, “Don’t. I need full movement if anything happens.” He warned. 

“Sorry..” I whispered though Calla seemed to notice and slowed her pace to fall into step with me.

“It’s okay, they won’t kill you the same way they’ll kill him. You won’t suffer.” She assured in the least reassuring way I’d ever heard. 

“.*.What?*” I squeaked. 

“Also make sure to kneel, they like that.” She added. 

I felt nauseous. My imagination was running rampant as I tried to guess what these people were. Medieval gang members? Mafia? Monsters? I didn’t know. Calla led us through a courtyard and all the while people stopped what they were doing to watch us pass. When we reached the main building we entered into a wide hallway and this was the point at which Eric stopped using his cane. I knew he was ready to pull the sword from it at any moment. 

Behind us the hall filled with armed guards. They were close enough now for me to see that they were empty suits of armor held together by what looked like shadows inside them and they blocked our escape route. 

“Eric…” I said nervously. 

“I know.” He responded sharply and I shut my mouth. 

We continued down the hall for only a short time after that before Calla stopped and gestured for Eric to go ahead of her. Before us was a large set of carved wooden double doors, they were wide open and inviting into the room beyond. The air coming from it smelt oddly sweet, like powdered sugar.

Eric hesitated, and though he still seemed perfectly calm, I wondered if this was difficult for him in a way I didn’t fully understand. He took in a deep breath and let it out slowly before stepping through the threshold entirely devoid of emotion. I tried to follow his lead and keep my own expression blank but I couldn’t help a little gasp of shock. 

It was so much more inviting than I had expected it to be. The interior was massive with a high ceiling, a full length window framed with heavy drapes allowed sunlight to stream in and the entire back wall was a library. Beside the books was a secondary door, it was open and I assumed it led into a study of some kind. Positioned near the bookshelf was a large mahogany desk with paperwork overflowing the edges. 

The young man that sat there, pen in hand, looked oddly irritated as a breeze blew through the room between the two open doors ruffling the papers before him. “For the ***last*** *time, Markos.* If you don’t *shut* the *damn door* on your way out I swear-“, he stopped mid sentence, dropping the pen in surprise as he looked up and made eye contact with Eric. 

This time I saw Eric tense as they stared for a long moment. The man was barely older than Eric, maybe Charles’s age. His eyes were a bright lime green and his hair was messily pushed to one side. 

“Markos.” The blonde demanded now, his demeanor changing on a dime to be more intimidating. 

“Oh, would you calm down? You have paperweights for a reason.” A voice answered from the other room before the second taller man stepped into view. He was older by some years, though his hair was a pink-ish blonde and his eyes purple. He seemed distinctly pleased to see us.  “Oh! Ma petite Poupée, I knew you wouldn’t be far behind!” 

“You knew of this and didn’t warn me prior?” The younger man demanded of him. 

“Are you displeased Nathaniel? You have no idea the lengths I went to to make this possible! Though.. The human girl is a bonus, and the boy wasn’t supposed to come in armed.” Markos said thoughtfully, “*Calla*, *make sure they don’t move*.” 

When he spoke the last sentence there was an almost musical undertone to his voice, that must have been what Eric meant by ‘extra sounding’, and Calla moved immediately. I didn’t even have the time to blink before I felt the cold steel of a blade at my throat. Eric however moved just as quickly, so that we were now in an awkward standoff. They both had swords pointed at each other and Calla had an additional one to mine. 

“I’m profoundly displeased.” Nathaniel responded tensely. 

“Oh? Should I not have brought them to your office? I can have them taken to the below chambers.”  Markos offered pleasantly. 

“No.” He stated firmly then addressed Eric, “Why are you here? Surely you weren’t fool enough to fall into a trap set by Markos.” 

At this I thought I saw Eric smile ever so slightly cynically, “I came because I need your help.” He responded bitterly. 

This seemed to catch the man off guard, “Oh? That’s interesting. Do explain.” 

“Someone has gone missing. There are no energy signatures, I can’t find him on any map, or with any of my tracking abilities.. He no longer exists, so to speak… But I know *you* could find him with your capability. So that is what I’m asking of you.”  

“And this person, he’s ‘important’ to you?” Nathaniel asked curiously. 

Eric looked annoyed now as if he didn’t want to answer but eventually did, “Yes.” 

“How important?” 

“I’m here aren’t I?” 

Nathaniel laughed softly at this, “I suppose that is a point. And what will you do for me in return to find this person?” 

“You can’t be considering this. I didn’t bring him here for you to bargain with.” I heard Markos protest in a lower tone, though Nathaniel put a hand up to silence him. 

“Nothing.” Eric answered calmly.

“You will give me ‘nothing’ in return for my favor?” 

“There is nothing I can give you, we both know that.” 

He paused now as if considering, “There’s always more you could give.” He mused. 

“I will give you **nothing**.” Eric repeated unwavering, “Help me only because I asking you to.”

A tense silence followed his statement, before Nathaniel spoke again, “Is that an ‘*order’*?” He sounded amused. 

“It is.” 

The man smiled in earnest now, showing his canine teeth as he did, “Markos, call off your pet. I’ve been given an ‘order’ and I would hate to be terribly disobedient unlike others have been in the past.” He stated bemused and the other man begrudgingly nodded. In response Calla lowered her weapons and I felt immediate relief as I scrambled away from her. 

“He’s going to help us?” I whispered nervously.

“He could be lying.” Eric told me honestly. 

“I’m not lying to you, have some faith.” 

“If you want my trust again, earn it.” 

Nathaniel looked unhappy with this comment, “Careful Eric. You’re in my castle, and I don’t have that much patience.” He warned. 

“Are you making a threat?” 

Nathaniel looked frustrated this time, “…No. I’m making a request that you be polite.”

“I am being polite.” 

At this the man sighed, rubbing his temples, “Markos, have everyone washed up and dressed for dinner. No harm is to come to them, accidental or otherwise am I clear?” 

“You are clear.” Markos responded coldly. 

“We’re not eating here-“ Eric protested quickly speaking over him, but was quiet when Nathaniel gave him a firm look.

“Have the kitchen remove the meat from this evening’s meal.” He instructed. 

“Very well.” Markos agreed, though I got the distinct feeling he wasn’t happy with this arrangement. Regardless, he motioned for the guards to stand down, then offered his hand to Calla. She took it without hesitation and gave a small curtsy. 

“Follow.” She instructed as Markos walked with her away. I can’t say I was eager to do so after having had her threaten to kill me, then Nathaniel spoke again. 

“Eric, would you remain with me for a moment. I wish to speak with you in private.” He requested. 

I saw Eric’s demeanor falter then as he was caught between surprise and suspicion. He looked to me and then back to the man, calculating, “For no more than a moment, Nathaniel.”

\*\*\* 

Markos led us out of the castle and through the gardens down a narrow snow covered path. We were headed toward what looked to me, like a second smaller castle.  It was bitterly cold out, all the plants were covered in ice and I was beginning to shiver. However as we approached our destination I noticed that steam rose from the new building and there was no snow on or around  it. Rather it radiated a comfortable warmth. 

“*Make sure she is bathed,* I will send for robes and see you soon ma Poupée.” He used the same musical tone as he spoke to her and kissed the back of her hand before he turned to go, leaving us at the entrance. 

“Come.” Calla instructed me as she pushed through the doors. 

Inside I was surprised to see that it was a bathhouse. Steam rose from heated ground pools filling the air in a thick humidity and several women approached us as soon as we entered. They were slim with flat chests and narrow hips, dressed in silky robes. I was so distracted by their slightly pointed ears that I didn’t realize what they were doing until they began to remove my clothes. 

“H-hey, wait n-!” I stammered confused but the look of pure disgust on their faces shriveled my protests. 

“We don’t answer back. It’s their job to tend to us.” Calla explained and looking over to her I saw two women were undoing the braids in her hair. They detangled it gently with their fingers then brushed it out as she stood patiently and allowed herself to be undressed. That didn’t really make me any more confident, but I supposed it wasn’t my place to reject their traditions so I followed her lead. 

Unfortunately for me, Calla was trim and fit with not an ounce of fat on her, while I was very average. I tried to cover some of myself self-consciously as my hair wasn’t long enough to cover anything and I didn’t appreciate having my general body flab shown to everyone in the room. It was an extremely uncomfortable experience, my skin was stretchy and blotchy with cellulite in my thighs meanwhile Calla looked like a runway model. 

I sank into the clean water gratefully. It was warm and comfortable and I felt myself relax for the first time in weeks as the women washed my hair. I was vaguely aware that Calla was beside me and the smell of roses filled the air. 

“Do you do this every day?” I asked her curiously. 

“Yes. Humans gather many smells throughout the day so it is necessary.” She answered in a matter of fact monotone that made me wonder how she had survived the past two weeks on only low pressure hotel showers. 

“Can I ask you more questions?” 

“If it would please you.” She responded calmly. 

That gave me pause, did she mean it? Or was she just answering to be polite? I decided on the former, “That man, Markos, is he your boyfriend?” 

“No.” 

That didn’t give me much to work with. “Husband?” I tried. 

“No. I am his property.” She explained vaguely.

“You can’t own a person.” I laughed until I realized she was entirely serious, then I let it drop. “What about the man Eric spoke to? They seemed to know each other?” 

“Yes, they know one another. Eric is Nathaniel’s property, though he hasn’t been home in many years.” 

I turned to face her then, ready to explain that what she was saying was inherently wrong. However as I moved one of the women pulled my hair and that lost me my train of thought, “Ow.” I complained pouting. 

“You are intended to remain still.” Calla informed me. 

“Yeah, I got that.” I answered flatly, glaring at the woman ruefully before restarting our conversation, “If you’re both ‘property’ how can Eric speak like that to him? Shouldn’t he be more ‘obedient’?” 

“He cannot. But Eric is very disobedient, he causes himself much unnecessary pain in resisting them and he has been sentenced to death for his sins.” 

“They’re going to kill him?!” I asked alarmed, I know he said they might before, but I thought he was exaggerating. 

At this Calla seemed to give it some consideration, “Perhaps. The responsibility is Nathaniel’s and few others would carry out the sentence without his permission to do so.” 

“Why doesn’t he just give others that permission then?” 

“… I don’t know.” She said thoughtfully. 

The conversation lapsed into silence then and we were directed to leave the water shortly after. We were oiled and perfumed before the women began to dress us. I was fitted into a blue-gray dress with a ruffled hem and annoyingly puffy shoulders. Then they set about working on our hair. Calla sat perfectly still like a doll throughout, but I found it rather disempowering to have no automation of my own over the process. 

We were then escorted to the dining hall and when we entered Eric was already there, sat in the furthest seat from Nathaniel. He seemed alright, his expression was calm and his clothes were fresh, though his hair was still damp. Calla left my side to sit with her ‘owner’ and I took the opportunity to survey the food. It was a lavish assortment of cheese, bread and nuts alongside golden fruits that I had never seen before. 

“Claire, is it? Would you come sit beside me?” Nathaniel asked politely, noticing me meandering. I hesitated and he spoke again, “*Come sit beside me.*” 

This time when I heard the words I felt my body move involuntarily to fulfill his request. Automatically I tried to resist but his will entirely suppressed my own and *that* was terrifying. I felt like a puppet on a string as I came to sit beside him. I cursed myself for not remembering the ear plugs Eric gave me. However thankfully, the effect wore off gradually and only left a slight sick feeling in my stomach. 

“Nathaniel.” Eric warned tensely. 

“Be reasonable now, it was hardly a command. It was… More of a firm suggestion.” 

“I asked you not to use them on her.” 

“You also asked for my help, and for me not to use them on you. You can’t have *everything* your way.” He answered nonchalantly before returning his attention to me, “However, I do apologize if that experience alarmed you.” 

I didn’t know what to say so instead, for perhaps the only time in my entire life, I just sat there quietly. Though he didn’t seem to mind as he reached across the table to make up a plate of food which he then placed in front of me. 

“Please eat, I’m sure you must be hungry after such a long drive.” 

He was right, I hadn’t really realized how hungry I was until then. “Thank you.” I responded this time, I didn’t want him to think I was ignoring him just in case he decided to force me to eat or something. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Markos also made a plate for Calla and I realized that was probably why she had always needed permission to eat. 

The food itself was extremely bland. There weren’t any condiments on the table and what little flavor there was came from combining the different foods. The only exception to this was the fruit, which was in contrast wildly sweet. I could have eaten that all day. 

“Is the food to your liking?” Nathaniel asked curiously, interrupting my thoughts. 

“Yes.” I lied quickly not wanting to be offensive. 

“Good.” He smiled superficially, “Now, Eric tells me that it’s your brother who is missing?”

“Yes, his name is Charles..” I felt a stab of pain in my heart even just mentioning his name. I was here being bathed, clothed and fed and while he was goodness knows where, being treated any number of ways. 

“And you are full blood siblings?” He specified. 

“As far as I know, yes? Why? Does that matter?” 

“I will need a drop of your blood to find him, if you would allow.” He stated vaguely, holding out his hand for mine. 

“What?” I asked, utterly dumbfounded. 

“I can use your energy to find his. It’s a weak signature in humans, but blood shows it quite clearly.” He tried to explain. 

“So… If you have a drop of my blood, you can find him?” 

“Most probably.” 

“And it’s just *one* drop?” I clarified. 

“Yes. It will hardly hurt.” He assured. 

I wasn’t sure if I trusted that, but I was going to do whatever I could to find my brother so I cautiously allowed him to take my hand. His skin was startlingly cold and I flinched away in surprise. That seemed to amuse him for he chuckled softly, “Sorry.” he apologized without sincerity. 

Nathaniel then held my wrist so that the underside faced up, “Cup your hand as if you’re trying to hold water.” He instructed as he took a knife off the table. I tried to pull away then as a swell of panic coursed through me, there was no way that blade was clean enough for this. However his grip was strong and for all my struggling he didn’t even need to readjust. 

He placed the tip of the blade into the center of my hand and twisted it in his fingertips. The knife must have been sharp because he didn’t apply any pressure and the pain was delayed a moment as blood welled up from the cut. Then it hit, a sharp soreness that radiated out from the source. I had injured my foot stepping on glass before, and the sensation was much the same. 

“F\* ck.” I swore squirming uncomfortably in my seat. 

However the man ignored me, setting the knife down in exchange for a small vile which he pulled from his pocket, “*Tilt your hand*.” He ordered and I found that it did all on its own. The pooled blood trickled into the container without spilling and it was probably lucky he had used his power on me that time because I don’t think I could have done as he said with any accuracy otherwise. 

When it was over he closed the vile, “That was more than a single drop.” I muttered unpleasantly. 

“Would it have been better or worse if it were?” 

He had a point, but I didn’t want to give him that, “Can you let go of me now?” I countered. 

“Mmm\~” the man deliberated instead of answering as he looked over the wound. I didn’t like the way he was studying it and after a short moment his gaze fixated on something across the table. 

“Don’t.” Eric warned in a low tone and I heard the sound of his chair scrape against the floor as he got up. 

“You chose to sit so far away.” The man responded bemused, then he brought the palm of my hand to his lips and I felt my hair stand on end as he licked the blood out of it. It didn’t hurt, but it felt *awful*. He let go of me when Eric reached us and I nearly fell back off the chair. However Eric steadied me and examined my hand with scrutiny before letting go with a small sound of irritation.

“That was unnecessary.” He muttered. 

“I disagree. Perhaps if you trusted me more, a demonstration wouldn’t have been necessary.”

“That’s not how you earn trust!” 

“Stop being so dramatic, I was being helpful.” 

I didn’t understand what they were talking about until I dared look at it myself. It was healed, not so much as a mark left. I realized two things at once. First, was that Eric was expecting something worse and he was almost willing to let it happen. Secondly, I now understood what these people were. Cold to the touch and with a thirst for blood? Vampires.
