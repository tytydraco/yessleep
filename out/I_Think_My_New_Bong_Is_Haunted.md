If I use the bong again will the man come for me?

Sorry, I’m just scared. I don’t even think I can go home. 

Sorry, let me start at the beginning.

I only wanted a new bong. Turns out I should have just stuck with the old one. 

When I woke up on Saturday morning I still felt exhausted. I didn’t have any plans for the weekend, and really just felt like staying in. I knew I had some errands to run, so I figured the quicker I got those done, the quicker I could get to relaxing.

While I was out running errands, I was passing by a smoke shop on the way out of town. I started thinking that I hadn’t bought myself a new piece in a while, and my bong at home was a couple years old now. So I figured why not? I turned my car around and headed back to the shop.

I walked into the shop and was immediately greeted by three bored looking employees behind the front counter. After a quick look around the shop I realized that I was the only customer. 

The smoking stuff was in the back behind a large wall, they kept it separate from all of the regular band shirts and novelty items. As I walked behind the wall one of the employees followed me in and walked behind the counter. We made awkward eye contact and I saw that her name tag said “Melissa” and under that it said “Store Manager”.

It felt awkward while I looked at everything as she just waited for me to make a decision. I asked her to take out a few pieces for me, but didn’t really like anything that I looked at. 

I was just about to leave and call it quits when I saw a bong on the floor, it was kind of tucked away in the corner.

I pointed to the bong and asked Melissa if I could see it. She looked kind of confused when I had first asked, like she didn't know that the bong was there. When she picked up the piece she looked at it like she had never seen anything like it before, when earlier she was able to name the specific glass blowers of all the bongs that she had handed to me.
Before giving me the bong she seemed to be giving it an extremely thorough inspection. She was pulling out the stem and everything. Flipping the bong over and seriously inspecting it. 

She told me that she wasn’t sure where this piece came from, and that she didn’t remember ordering it. 

As I was checking out the bong one of the other employees stepped behind the counter, it looked like he was headed towards the door behind the counter but he stopped when he saw what I was holding.

“Oh yeah, I meant to tell you. That piece came in with the order this morning. I thought we weren’t trying new vendors this quarter?” the employee said. 

“We aren’t, I didn’t order this. Was it on the order form?” Melissa asked. 

“Nope, just extra.” the employee said as he walked through the door. 

The entire time they were talking I was checking out every last detail of this piece. It was made from mostly clear glass with a green stripe down one side of it, following the curves of the glass.The green was lighter, and looked like it might glow in the dark. But the stripe also seemed to sparkle and shimmer in the light. It had a round neck like a normal bong but the bottom was square instead of round. It just seemed different, it even felt different in my hands. I was very excited for a chance to smoke out of it. 

“How much would you sell it for?” I asked Melissa. 

I was still looking the piece over when I had asked, but when she didn't answer I looked over at her. She was looking at the bong with a curious and confused look on her face. She noticed that I was looking at her and she shook her head like she was trying to shake away a bad thought. 

“Uh, I’m not sure. I would have to check with the distribution company to see if they want to come back and pick it up. Maybe it was supposed to go to another local shop.” Melissa said without taking her eyes off the piece. 

“Could you call them right now? I’m really interested in purchasing this.” I eagerly asked.
“Uh, ye-yeah-yeah sure.” Mellissa stammered. 
She put her arm out towards the bong and I gave it to her. She looked at it for a second and then walked through the door behind the counter.

She was gone for about 15 minutes, I eagerly waited the entire time. I couldn’t stop thinking about getting the piece home. 

When Melissa came back through the door she was holding a large box that was taped extremely securely. Like she was afraid that something might try to escape the box. 

“So, the distribution company has no record of something like this coming off the truck, they even said that the driver has been done with his deliveries and nothing was missing from any of the orders. So, I’m free to do whatever I want with it.” she said. 

“Awesome! I would love to buy it, if you're planning on selling it.” I said excitedly.
Mellissa ended up selling it to me for $55. I thought it was a steal but she seemed to want to get the bong away from her. As I pulled out of the shop I saw her looking at me through the front windows of the shop. She had a really worried look on her face, and I thought I could see a bit of fear in her eyes. 

I took my new prized piece home and set the scene. I turned on my go to tv show, American Dad, on the flat screen. In front of me was my rolling tray with a bag of Chem Dawg sativa, the grinder, an ashtray and my lighter all neatly placed.

I filled the bong with water and packed the bowl.

The hit felt amazing.

I filled the bottom with smoke and inhaled. As I inhaled I prepared myself for that new bong cough. But the smoke actually felt cold as I inhaled. It completely relaxed my throat and I was able to take the entire hit without coughing. I hadn’t even had time to put the bong back on the table before the high kicked in. I've been smoking the same weed for a week now and it hadn’t once hit me like that so I knew that it was the bong. I’m not sure how it did it but it made the high feel intensified. 

I almost felt like that girl that melted into the couch in that anti-drug commercial in the 90’s-2000’s. 

I laid my head back on the couch and closed my eyes, ready to feel this different kind of high, but that's when a vision started to play across my thoughts. 

There I was running down a hallway in an old house. I could see my hands moving at my sides and one hand had a large knife in it. The knife and my hand were covered in blood. These hands though. They weren’t mine. The hands and arms were hairier and more muscular.

I heard a door slam ahead of me and I looked up, still running down the long hallway. I somehow knew it was the door at the end of the hall that had slammed. I heard a woman screaming, begging me to stop. 

I tried to open my eyes but I couldn’t. No matter what I did I couldn’t make the vision stop. I was even pulling at my face but my eyes seemed to be stuck closed. 

The vision kept playing, at this point the vision version of myself was at the door the woman had run through. He was slamming his fists against the door trying to break it down.

Suddenly a large crack appeared in the door. As soon as I saw the crack I felt a sudden rage burn through my physical body. I was so mad that I could feel my body shaking, and all of my muscles tensed. My real life body jumped up and was in a fighting stance ready to take out my rage. I knew that bitch behind that door needed to die.

The man kept pounding on the door and soon broke through. He quickly saw the woman curled up in the corner. She looked horrified, peaking out at the man from behind her hands. She started screaming when the man dropped the knife and suddenly lunged at her. 
I had a front row seat in my mind to watch him beat this woman to a pulp. He didn’t stop beating her head until he was mashing chunks into the carpet.

As the man was admiring his handy work and trying to catch his breath, he heard a small cry coming from behind him. He looked over his shoulder and saw a little girl in her pjs	 standing in the doorway. She was holding the hand of a younger boy with a binky in his mouth and a teddy bear that he was holding against himself. The boy seemed to not know what was happening. But the girl looked terrified and frozen in place.

The man suddenly lunged at the kids and all of a sudden I woke up.

I looked at my surroundings. I was completely terrified. I was standing in my hallway, the door to my bedroom completely broken down and my arms and hands were bleeding. I quickly ran to the bathroom to wash my wounds. 

As I was washing my arms and hands something made a loud thud behind me. I whipped around expecting to get attacked by the man in my vision. 

All that I saw was my Maine Coon, Parker, he must have hopped from the counter to the floor. He seemed to be looking at me with a confused and scared look on his face. I eased my way over to him, he was hesitant at first but started licking my wounds after a minute of head scratches. 

When Parker seemed to calm down I picked up the pieces of my door, and took the rest of the door off the hinges.

After everything was picked up I went back to my living room. As I entered the room I looked at the bong sitting on the coffee table. 
It changed.

The green stripe running down the side had turned black at the bottom of the bong. I picked up the piece and looked at the part that had turned black, it seemed endless. Like it wasn't just colored glass, like I could almost fall into it.

I brushed my finger over the black and it was so cold that it almost hurt to the touch. The chill surprised me and the bong fell out of my hands. It hit the floor with a loud bang and all of the water spilled out. I picked up the piece, careful not to touch the black part of the stripe again. The bong was fine and didn't even have a scratch on it, even though I had dropped it from a few feet off the ground. 
All I wanted to do was forget about this bong for right now and put it to the side. I knew something was seriously really wrong with this piece. Almost like now that I've smoked out of it, it has a presence now. 

I went to bed, but had horrible nightmares, the vision was playing over and over in my dreams. At the ending of one of the loops I woke up. I shot up and was drenched in sweat. I was trying to catch my breath when I looked up into the doorway.

The man from my vision was standing there. 

He was huge. He was wearing worn down work boots, overalls that needed a good wash, one of the straps was unbuckled and hanging down. He was wearing a red shirt that looked to be covered in sweat and dirt. He was breathing really heavily. His arms were hanging at his sides like he was ready to tackle someone. He was wearing an old truckers hat that was casting a shadow over his eyes but I could see that he was grinding his teeth and every time he breathed out he was spitting through the small gaps in his teeth.

He disappeared 5 seconds after I saw him, but I’m still terrified.

Now it's the next day and I'm sitting in a coffee shop. I'm afraid to go home. I'm afraid the bong is going to draw me in.

What should I do?
