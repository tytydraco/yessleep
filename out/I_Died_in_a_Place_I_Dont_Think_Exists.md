I do not know where I was, but I know I was not supposed to leave.

I woke up in a tiny, dark room that smelled like rot and metal. There was just enough space for a narrow bed with a thin mattress that offered no comfort at all. The walls were close, like the room was designed to remind you how little you mattered. I could barely move. Tubes were coming out of my body, and I knew immediately that I was very sick. Whatever had been done to me, it had been going on for a long time.

I was weak in a way I cannot fully explain. Not just tired, but empty, like my body was already halfway done with me.

When I shifted slightly, my hand brushed against something under the pillow. I reached for it and pulled out a small, rusty knife. It did not feel like it belonged to me. It felt like it had been left there, waiting. I remember thinking that someone else must have been in this bed before me, and that thought terrified me more than the knife itself.

That was when I heard a voice from the room next to mine.

A man spoke quietly, like we were having a casual conversation. He said, “They’re going to kill you, y’know.”

I did not respond. I could not.

After a moment, he spoke again. “If they’re going to kill you, ask them. Even beg them to use the tubes. They’re the most painless way to go.”

I did not have time to ask him anything else.

A woman came into the room shortly after. She looked like she was in her late forties or early fifties and wore a ragged uniform with what looked like old, worn-down body armor. She moved fast, but not nervously. It was the kind of rushed movement you see in people who are used to this, like nurses who are overworked and no longer see patients as people.

She kneeled beside my bed and started working on things I could not see. Adjusting. Organizing. Tampering with something out of my view.

That is when I started begging.

I told her that if she was going to kill me, I wanted her to use the tubes. I told her I did not want to suffer.

She did not look at me. She did not speak. It was like I did not exist.

I reached under my pillow and pulled out the knife. I was barely able to lift my arm. I did not even know what I was going to do with it, but it felt like the last thing I had. Like if I did nothing, this would be it.

That was the moment she finally acknowledged me.

She took the knife from my hand without effort. I was far too weak to resist. I was completely helpless, unable to even sit up.

She grabbed my arm and felt along my wrist, pressing gently until she stopped at the soft spot on the outer side. She held my arm firmly in place. Then she took my knife and slowly pushed it into my wrist.

I begged her to stop. I begged her not to do this.

She kept pushing it in, deeper and deeper, until blood started to seep out on both sides of the blade. I could feel everything. Every inch of it.

She pulled the knife out.

Blood started spraying from my wrist almost immediately. It was fast and violent.

I was crying, panicking, asking her why this was happening and what was going on. She leaned back and watched me.

I realized she was not going to help.

I grabbed my wrist with my other hand and pressed it tightly against my body, trying to stop the bleeding. I could feel the blood leaving me. I felt cold and numb, the same sensation you get when too much blood is being drawn, except it did not stop.

My vision blurred. My body felt heavier and colder. I could barely see anymore, but I could still make out her standing there, watching, as everything faded to black.

That is when I woke up.

I do not know why this dream felt so real. I do not know why I could feel every second of it. All I know is that when I woke up, my wrist hurt, my body felt cold, and I was terrified that somewhere, that place still exists.

And that I might have been there before. Maybe for that short time, I had a look into someone else’s eyes.
