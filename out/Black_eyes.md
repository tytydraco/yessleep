I never believed in demons until I saw the black eyed one. It started with a strange feeling, a sense of being watched. It was always there, in the corner of my eye, lurking just beyond my vision. I tried to ignore it, but it was like a weight on my chest that wouldn't go away.

Then one night about 10 or so years ago, as I was lying in bed, I felt a cold breath on the back of my neck. I turned around to see a figure standing at the foot of my bed, its eyes black as coal and it stood at about 7ft which obviously scared me because it’s so unnatural. I couldn't move, couldn't scream, as it whispered in my ear with its freakishly cold yet warm breath. 

"I can give you everything you've ever wanted," the demon said. "Power, wealth, fame anything you can ever imagine, it’s yours. All you have to do is make a small deal with me and it’s all yours whatever you may desire."

I tried to resist, but the temptation was too great. I had always struggled to make ends meet, to pay the bills, to get ahead in life. The demon promised me a way out, a way to finally achieve my dreams, a way to finally be someone and not be a nobody… A chance. 

But as the days passed, I realized that the demon's deal was not what it seemed. I began to have terrible nightmares, visions of dark rituals and sacrifices. I saw myself doing unspeakable things like murder, torture things I would never do to another human being, things that went against everything I believed in. 

The demon had tricked me, ensnaring me in its web of lies and deceit. It was not interested in helping me, but in using me as a pawn in its own game. And now it wanted my soul, the ultimate prize in its battle against the forces of good.

I tried to fight back, to find a way to break the deal, but it was too late. The demon had already claimed a part of me, and it was growing stronger every day making me black out and do things that I have no memory of doing but everyone is adamant I am. I have lost all my friends mostly my family and no one seems to believe me when I tell them that it’s black empty eyes follow me everywhere, reminding me of the darkness that had enslaved my life.

I don't know how much time I have left, but I do know that I will never be the same. The demon has changed me, twisted me into something I never wanted to be. And now I am left to wander in the shadows, haunted by the black eyed demon that wants to claim my soul for his own good. These past few nights have been the worst I keep hearing clawing at my door that lasts for hours, strange soft whispers that are inaudible and low low growling.

I’m scared. 

I can’t escape. 

Someone please reach out and help me before it takes what’s left of me…
