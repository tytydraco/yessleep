The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The [Treaty of Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Union) between the [Kingdom of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England) (which included Wales, [annexed in 1542](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535_and_1542)) and the [Kingdom of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland) in 1707 formed the [Kingdom of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain). Its [union in 1801](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800) with the [Kingdom of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland) created the [United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland). Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted that name in 1927.[\[m\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom#cite_note-35) The UK became the world's first [industrialised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation) country and was the world's [foremost power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foremost_power) during the 19th and early 20th centuries.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom#cite_note-36) In the 21st century, the UK retains considerable [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom), [cultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom), [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces), [scientific, technological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_the_United_Kingdom) and [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom) influence.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom#cite_note-37)

British influence can be observed in the language, culture and the legal and political systems of many of its [former colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom).[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom#cite_note-40)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFerguson2004307-41)
