Greetings. If you are reading this, then it means that the sigils are working as they should and, in theory, last throughout the night. It's the first time I used high level reverse warding since I've been sent back, and my memory is still a little fuzzy from before. If I didn't mess up, this should give me time to at least somewhat rest and write down my message. I will not tell you who or where I am, lest my precautions would be for naught, but you can address me as Z. What I can tell you however is that I am currently on the run from God.

Why, you may ask? Why would God be trying to catch me? What makes me so special for Him to find me and drag me back to heaven? See, this is the funny thing. I am not special. I died too early. Turns out, when you stalk around a bunch of demon worshipers, they tend to be a little... how should I put this... stabby. In hindsight, I should've been more careful, checking before entering their cave to see if they have a way to bypass my talismans, but I digress. What is important to know is that I have been killed and went to heaven.

At first, I was glad. All my years working for the Vatican have finally paid off. I was finally in His goodwill and all that remained is for me to achieve everlasting peace. To be fair, you could argue that they didn't lie about that part. You could also argue that the Devil doesn't lie about his deals either. What actually happened is that when I arrived at the gates of heaven, I have been assigned an angel. It was standard procedure they said. Check out on my previous deeds to see if I have sinned, a short interview, all that good stuff. The angel took me and I found myself in a large room of pure brilliance, filled with heavenly light. I sat down on what was easily the comfiest couch I ever sat on and began to talk with him. You'd think that being in the presence of God's servant would give me a sense of calm, but honestly, after a while, I was beginning to feel worried. The angel was all smiles and he was being very friendly, even cracking a few jokes in between taking notes, but I couldn't help but notice his eyes. Behind all the radiance and his golden colored irises, there was nothing. No... There was something. Malice. The same malice I saw when I confronted demons on Earth. I pretended not to observe, but he might've realized it.

When the interview was finished, another angel came and took a gander at the notes my interviewer took. His face betrayed a slight confusion, looking both at me and the notes for a few times before the angel at the desk simply said "he is not ready". Shrugging, the second angel lead me to another room. If the interview room was supposed to give you a sense of serenity and purity, the room I now found myself in was the complete opposite: cramped, with almost no light present in the room, with a single chair in the middle of it. The white marble walls now looked more like the white you'd see in an insane asylum rather than a place of purity. The chair was of red and black stone, more akin to something you'd see in hell rather than heaven. I was then told to sit on it with a deep growl, replacing the typical heavenly voice of an angel, all the previous pretense of being nice having disappeared. I demanded to know what was the meaning of this. How can I, someone that has served God all these years, be treated in such a way.

The angel just laughed and pushed me onto the chair. After sitting, I noticed I couldn't get up from it even if I tried. He told me not to struggle too much. He then placed a hand on the top of my head. I suddenly began feeling like my being was invaded with a powerful energy. I felt the energy going to my legs and saw myself being dissolved, the energy filling me like an empty vessel, climbing towards my head. As I kept disappearing, the angel told me: "If you really want to know what is going on, human, I will tell you. You will still forget what has happened here, but I always enjoy telling your kind the truth before being sent back. That brief moment of terror is simply... divine. Right now, you are unfit to remain here and serve your final purpose, thus, I am sending you to earth to fully finish your brief lifespan. But don't worry," he began smiling more and more, "you will come right back here. The soul of an exorcist is highly sought after, especially by our Father". As only my head remained when he finished talking, I asked him what was this final purpose he spoke of. He grinned and uttered only one word: "consumption".

With that, I woke up back in my body, deep in a dark forest at night. The stars and the moon were hidden behind thick, gray clouds, small drops of rain hitting my face. My mind was a bit blurry, but I still remembered what he has told me. I am not sure why I still remembered, but it might have been because the demon wards I put in my mind before confronting the cultists could have interfered with the angelic magic. Immediately after waking up, feeling like I stepped out from my darkest nightmares, I screamed and began running as fast as I could. I must have ran for hours until I tripped on a metal object. It turned out to be a hatch that lead to an abandoned world war 2 bunker. Once inside, I checked for anything that I might be able to protect myself with.

Thankfully, my phone, my weapons and my blessed chalk are still here. The blessed chalk is towards demon protection, but in a pinch, I thought that if used correctly, it could work on angels as well. Once the sudden rush of adrenaline subsided, I felt a numb pain on my forehead, and when I checked it, I felt a raised indentation where the angel's hand was. Tracing it with my hand, I realized it was something like a symbol. However, it was a symbol I have never seen before, neither in the angelic nor demonic scriptures. 

Nevertheless, when morning comes, I should be able to finish drawing the sigils on my undercoat, hoping to at least hide my presence from them. I will also need to get other items, such as demon weapons and cursed wax, to fully protect myself from the angels. My new goal, as a renegade exorcist, forsaken by the God I served and shunned by the demons I banished, is to find the key to immortality. I have written what has happened to me in the last 24 hours as a warning to all of you. Until I find how to become immortal and save you all, try to do everything in your power to stay alive. Otherwise, you might end up on the silver platter of heaven.
