You can’t fathom ever reaching an end once you’ve taken that unassuming right turn. Those endlessly straight roads stretch off as they touch the horizon, both mundane and uncanny.

The thought of closing your eyes and just allowing the vessel you reside in to wrap itself around the nearest trunk; however hysteric, would only guide you back to that sun damaged scarlet sign.

The absent tick of both hands on your wrist only sees to sterilise the already boundless trawl, with the soul reverberation being the thin metal container pulling you along the deserted concrete.  

After only a few seconds or three eternities these lanes are as familiar to you as the back of your hand. Each speedbump latticing the slip road to that charmingly well-maintained building tantamount to a knuckle, as you trace their peaks.

Whatever semblance of strength still resides within won’t keep your eyes from wailing to you for a minuscule moment of respite from the hypnotic meanders. Neither will the husk of a vehicle you still crawl along the uneven highway in, in the end, we’re all cattle, guided down a raceway to an imperceptible end.

Lingering just out of view, a mental projection built by a mixture of our primal subconscious and a wicked facsimile of our own transgressions.

It’s thralls, dance to the tune conjured by that deep routed fear of being beneath an all too familiar presence, in order to heighten a flight response your body broadcasts.

Innocent as it was, that turn was the last mistake you’ll make. A moment’s hesitation, the only thing separating you from its camouflaged maw and normalised sanity.  

All I can do is wait. Those footsteps grow closer as I slump deeper into the now hollow corpse of what I once raced across this boundless highway in. The pitch black of the night only illuminated by the last flickers of life my phone emits as my epitaph is scratched onto these aged pages.

Whatever its intentions were, this is where the ouroboros terminates. Following this endless road, I’ve gotten to my last stop.

Garage sales aren’t my thing, but with my grandpa being a bit of a collector and me moving across the country for college, I gave in to his request at my attendance. Nothing of note took my eye at first, as we rummaged through boxes of old toy cars searching for some vintage series.

I had as little clue about matchbox cars as I did about my own study project, due in just over three months, as my restless eyes lazily traced the box in front of me. Early mornings are a killer when I’ve got a lecture let alone trawling through someone else’s trash.

Scouring the adjacent tables of used junk, toys and miscellaneous accessories, I could feel eyes on my back. It wasn’t the feeling you get when you know someone is waiting for you to turn round to start a conversation, rather the feeling of being assessed.

Every item I looked at, the way I moved, my small mannerisms all catalogued as if I was being evaluated for yet another exam I was unprepared for.

Flicking around to locate my would-be invigilator, the only other people at the rows of plastic fold out tables were a middle-aged balding man and a mother, attempting to keep her kid from shoving whatever was in arms reach into his mouth. None of which seemed to even acknowledge my existence as they enquired about the pieces of the collection of knickknacks.

Suddenly, almost as if it had appeared out of the ether, my wandering eyes fell upon a small leather-bound book. It was definitely used, small tears, a stain or two and the frayed ends of the bind all showed the items age. Something about its appearance drew me closer, as a voice in the back of my mind whispered for me to read it.  

That momentary hesitation was broken by my grandpa beckoning me over to a sun damaged red plastic bucket as he fished out a small navy car. With its trance like grip on me severed, I trudged over, forgetting about that book entirely.

The short drive back mostly consisted of a conversation about why this series was so elusive for collectors interspersed with segments from the radio. Another vehicle found just off the highway with no occupancy gave my grandpa another reason to lecture me about road safety, and like any early twenties guy, it went in one ear and out the other.  

The rest of the day was uneventful as I packed the essentials whilst he fixed my watch. He’d nag me to get the battery changed regularly, but as usual my mind was elsewhere. With it only being my second time driving this considerable of a distance, my detailed plan had me charting each exit and entrance on and off the highway in preparation.

That week off was a nice change of scenery from our campus and I didn’t get many opportunities to pop home. Montana back to Oregon no matter how tedious, was one trip I planned to undertake whenever I missed my grandmas home cooking, which undoubtedly would have been a week.  

Traffic, brilliant, only minutes on the highway and I’m already delayed. Checking my handsfree, there was a slip road that apparently swung me out on the otherised of whatever was causing this level of congestion.

Planning my route earlier I’d not even noticed that there was even a road there, but half an hour less time stationary was tantalising enough.

Taking the right turn I passed an evidently derelict car, lying motionless, angled off the lane facing the surrounding thicket. The driver side door was cranked open, only just hanging on by the connecting joint, as it lay limply at an all too unnatural angle.

Sadly, that scene wasn’t what occupied the forefront of my mind, annoyingly, my music cut off as this lanes poor signal was karma for not checking on that vessel’s inhabitants.

Only half an hour in and the restlessness of that early sunrise had me waning. Something about this trip home left we with little sleep last night, coupled with the days previous events had my eyes feeling heavier than they did at a 9:00 am class.

A ray of hope burned through my half closing eyelids as I passed a large red sign for a gas station, and only two miles away. I remember ‘thanking god’ as I took the next right and turned off. Funny how I was so happy to see that sign, maybe if I’d actually scanned the slightly sun-damaged rectangle, some primal part of my mind may have connected some of the, in hindsight, more questionable dots.

Pulling in, I quickly searched the spaces adjacent to the pumps and surprisingly the lot was empty. Stretching out every joint in my body, that didn’t come across as abnormal, with this station being somewhat remote, the lack of any other vehicles merging back onto the highway or following in behind raised no red flags.

The station was fairly small, with four pumps and a handful of bays lining one of the picketed wooden perimeter walls, which themselves were overreached by an encirclement of pine trees. Across from me was the stations main building, which I hoped would house a suitable section of fuel for the duration of the journey.

Sitting in the now silent vehicle my mind alerted me to the absents of a soft repeated tick. Nothing new, my watch often runs out of batteries long before I notice, but I was pretty certain my grandpa hadn’t just given me a dead watch back after offering to pop in a new battery.  

Trapsing my hand through the backpack which lay on the passenger side chair, in search of my wallet, my palm came in contact with something I failed to recall packing. Gripping the paper package and wrenching it from my overstuffed pack, it revealed a thin rectangular shape.

With little ease and a glimmer of intrigue I tore the items binding, exposing a brown leather covering. I’m guessing he caught me staring that morning, but I was happy to have received another item he thought I’d find value in. Unlike previous pieces, this wouldn’t be as disposable, though in that moment I couldn’t think of what I’d actually use it for.

Part of me wanted to unbuckle the thin leather strap and indulge in its contents, however the more rational side attempted to hurry me towards the red and white building in my periphery.

Toying with the instinct to open it, a human shape shuffled passed me as it headed towards the door of the gas station. Refocusing on what I had stopped off for, I switched off the engine, trading the book for my wallet, and followed suit.

Entering through those transparent doors, I was met by an all too customary layout and sweet but slightly stale aroma. With an item in mind, I made a B-line for the coolers, passing the lady who’d shuffled by me only moments ago.

She was a fairly young-looking mother, in a floral blue and orange summer dress. The image of her reading the label of a large bag of chips whilst pushing that baby blue stroller is a strange picture to recall, but her appearance was eerily familiar.

Apart from myself and her the only other person in the store was an attractive, maybe five-foot ish, gothic cashier. Avoiding staring too long at a specific region of her appearance, I had a new dilemma, which drink would fuel me for the duration of the day.

Analysing each bottle within the cooler, I’d narrowed it down to original monster or orange Gatorade. Deliberating for what was longer than it had taken me to get here, somebody else entered the store, as the ring door alerting me to his presence.

Too engrossed in my choices, I didn’t turn to see the balding man wandered over and planted himself uncomfortably close as he also scanned the shelves besides me.

His smell alone clued me in to the fact that if I’d turn to face him, we’d have got into a head-on collision. That putrid sent of rot mixed with the sweet smell of gasoline had already started to make me lightheaded as I slunk around the adjacent aisle.

With human interaction not being my specialty, I grabbed a couple of packets of whatever name brand snacks were on that shelf and made my way over to the counter. Every step I took, his eyes tracked me. I never turned to look at him fully, but just within my periphery I could make out he was standing in the same spot, staring my way.

With all the hairs on my body standing to attention I awkwardly paid for my things, giving that whispery quiet ‘thanks’ to the cashier as I quickened my pace. Reaching the relative safety of my car, my body naturally relaxed, slumping down onto the seat as I lay the thin plastic bag on my passenger side.

Cracking the monster and scanning the car park for a couple of seconds, a thought popped into mind, something that I’d been too tired to realise earlier. If my car was the only one here, how did those three get here? They couldn’t have walked; we were right by a highway with little more than trees and grass land for as far as my admittedly poor eyesight could see.

That awkward encounter was instantaneously replaced with a small but noticeable well of confused fear. My mind obviously perceived something my senses couldn’t, but not wanting to find out, I buckled up and set off to hopefully make a considerable dent in the journey.

I’d been back on that road for a good hour or maybe more, but subconsciously I felt myself counting the passing cars. Initially they’d whizzed by me every couple of seconds in either direction, but the roads seemed scares.

I don’t even know if I’d seen another car since leaving the gas station. That monster had caught up to me and though I was definitely awake, my bladder was kicking up a fuss.

Excellent timing, another gas station only two miles away.

Pulling in, I once again got pick of the bays. Parking up as I had, adjacent to the pumps, my body restrained me as I reached out for the door handle. Practically the moment I’d switched off the car and attempted to clamber out, a shadow crossed my driver’s side as a young mother pushing a light blue stroller made her way over to the door of the building.

That was close, I thought, as the feeling of that near miss was rapidly replaced by the nagging reminded of why I’d pulled in. Attempting to hold my bladder as best I could, I entered in loosely behind. Locating the bathroom and passing the attractive cashier I paid little attention to the formulaic layout of the gas station, eyeing up the cooler as I passed.

Breaking the dam I’d been holding back for a considerable length of time, a fain ding was quickly masked as I flushed, washed up and left the cubicle. Making my way back to the main floor, I almost got into another head-on collision with a guy standing only an inch from the door. Apologizing and swiftly making my way around him whilst keeping my head down, I shuffled towards the closes cooler and made the inverse decision on what to drink.  

Paying, awkwardly smiling and thanking the cashier, that pit seemed to grow. Not being sure why my natural instinct was to check my shoulder as I pushed open the gas station door, my head turned and eyes locked with his, still standing motionless as the bathroom door.

The same balding man stared back.

Had he followed me from the first place, or did he just have a twin brother? Even from that distance I could see deep into his enlarged pupils and a mirrored feeling of being evaluated caused my freeze response to kick in.

We could have stood there for five seconds or five years, but time stood still as he watched me attempt to rationalise his recurring presence. All of a sudden, his body twisted in a mechanically fluid motion and he strode towards me, not seeming to exert any effort as he glided down the aisle.

Panic set in and without thinking my body was dragging me back to my little white car. Half tripping as drop from the pavement my eye were trained back on the door to the gas station building.

Some small part of my mind tried desperately to justify his actions, but the more primal portion overpowered it, giving me only one order … run.

Flying into my driver’s seat and flawing it out of the parking lot my eyes were still trained on the entrance as he burst forth and swept the vacant concrete.

As our gaze met again, his eye were almost gleeful as his otherwise blank expression traced my acceleration, back onto the minimal safety of the highway.

I was done, who knew how long the road was and how much further it stretched. I needed to back.

 

\-

 

You’re always told to keep your eyes on the road both for your own and others safety. Though I’d only had my full licence for a year, those words didn’t set off any alarms as I hysterically swirled my head, gawking at every vaguely human shaped tree on either side of the road.

It wasn’t like I could accidentally hit another vehicle, with my car being all that inhabited this desolate stretch of road. Interspersed between my wild swings and frantic double takes, I caught myself subtly examining the road ahead. Staring down that straight lane, there wasn’t even a hint that anyone had traversed these roads.

No oil spills, two tone road works or tire marks accentuated the otherwise grey concrete trail. For a couple of minutes the road was back to its flat expressionless self, then I hit a large bump.

Checking my rear view, it almost seemed like the concrete bulged up and out, almost like a bollard rather than a speed bump, but then again why did a highway have a speed bump.

That singular instance quickly became three, then four, all rising higher, some now pillars as high as my car, taking all my strength and mental agility to keep from coming to a complete and abrupt stop.

Hitting the brakes and almost giving myself whiplash, I couldn’t have been more than fifty centimetres from a now spire like cylinder which pierced the canopy above us. Whatever force was at play here definitely didn’t want me to go back.

With the countless roadblocks, it didn’t seem possible to even move without slamming into an unconformity springing from the concrete below. Checking my rear-view though offered some semblance of resolve to my current minefield.

Almost as if goading me to again drive deeper, the road I’d just so perilously traversed was as flat and bleak as it once had been, in stark contrast to what lay ahead of me.

Making the only decision I could, the car turned, and we were back on this endlessly straight road, deeper into its unassuming façade.

Passing that same gas station again, I couldn’t tell if it was just the road spitting out another slowly degrading copy or it was in fact the same one, I’d been chased from. It didn’t matter as my only goal was ahead. I needed to find the destination; this trail was leading me to.

Turning what felt like the only corner in a good hour by this point, though my hysterics reduced any time keeping to an all-time low, for a moment my mind paused as my eyes traced up a tall red sign.

Gas station in two miles.

Hoping and praying I’d just hallucinated the previous instances due my growing tiredness, I begged for my eyes to show me anything other than that same building as its shape came into view between the tall pine trees that encircled it.

An identical building emerged from betwixt the canopy of needles, only offset by its overtly rundown nature. Unlike the gas stations prior, this one had definitely been neglected, leaving a vividly sharp paranoia of crossing a threshold I wouldn’t be able to return from.

Slowing down to a crawl, the parking area was devoid of any other vehicles and quite rightly as the stained variegation around the pumps coupled with the speckled mould patches would have surely put off any normal person, if any still existed.

Half of my mind questioned whether I was just picking up on minor details and all the stations just happened to be similar, though that rational half was quickly bypassed by the sudden emergence of a person.

Striding into view from a gap between the slanted wooden fence and the tire pressure pump was a woman. Alarm bells blared as her appearance was unmistakably identical the lady I’d encountered way back at the previous station.

Something about her walk seemed off, maybe it was the slight limp and evident reliance on that stroller to ease her step, but she looked tired.

Each step was laboured, more so than the first time I’d laid eyes on her. Still trundling along and with my gaze fixed on her, I mounted the curb with a slight scrape and a fair amount of cursing.

Surprisingly on this remote street, with my car undoubtably overlaying any ambient sounds of surrounding nature, she didn’t so much as flinch or look my way. Whatever commotion I made, seemingly never reached her ears, or more accurately, didn’t elicit any such deviation from her current plans.

Stopping and assessing the damages, I’d scratched the alloys and scuffed my passengers side wheel. With enough occupying my mind already this just sank to the bottom of a well of issues I had no interest in fixing there and then.

Still crouching and wiping the already mounting sweat from my brow, I again felt eyes on me. Standing and scanning the again lifeless parking spaces, there was no one and nothing in my immediate view.

Those same malicious beams only sought to reaffirm their owner’s animosity. Expecting to find myself face to face with them the moment I’d stood up, I still couldn’t put a form to that feeling as I attempted to focus on what was currently pressing.

Re-entering my car and starting the ignition in hopes of getting off this lane asap, my pulse slowly relaxed, back to a baseline, leaving an empty pit in its wake. Keeping my head trained on that buildings perimeter as I passed, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, other than its condition.

Leaving that scene behind, I permit myself a final hesitant check of my rear-view mirror in order to finally, fully settle my nerve.

Seeing only the back of the poorly maintained building and the roads perimeter tree cover, I was mere milliseconds away from refocusing on the road ahead, when an all too familiar figure lurched from the thicket opposite the station.

He simply smiled as the distance between crumbled away, leaving his visage burned into my mind. We were merely a breath apart and if he’d have willed it so, I’d have found out why he was infusing me with fear tantamount to a trapped mouse, coming face to face with an increasingly hungry snake.

The day was beginning to fade as I could faintly see my cars headlights beaming down on the road ahead. With them springing to life my own eyes had started to waiver.

Who knows how long I’ve been driving, but that incessant orange light has been warning me of an impending stall to my journey. Just my luck, a lone red sign peaking from between two thin stumps.

Two miles till I’d see him again.

I didn’t want to stop, let along even drop my speed lower than thirty, though without any juice, I’d be walking. I don’t even recall how many miles I had in the tank before embarking on this trip or what time I left, but I could feel that I’d been driving for a heck of a lot longer than my nav suggested.

Like a grain of sand atop a dune, those thoughts were blowing away as the building came into view. Decrepit is as good a word I could use to describe its exterior. Peeling paint and loose tiles, some of which had already crumbled to the now mossy and overgrown concrete drive, painted a picture of neglect.

Most of the windows were smashed or at least cracked in places, with a litter of small shards pooling at the main entrance. Even a small section of the roof had seemingly collapsed as the building itself sagged to one side.

I’d have just assumed it was abandoned if not for a shape trudging in its innards. Reaching a stop in order to ascertain who or what was still accessing that husk, there she was, emerging from my right as she had the numerous times I’d visited.

As the station had, she too was deteriorating. Limping from betwixt the now rotten and collapsed fence, she held on to that now bent and disjointed stroller as if it were part of her, and from my angle she might as well have been. Dragging what seemed to be her bruised and mangled right leg, she stared forward through barely open eyes. Her one and only continuous goal, to reach an unknown ending.

Silently watching, my body, as it had when she passed my car, fixed me in place as it wrestled with the idea of attempting to offer assistance and getting the last remnants of fuel still encased in the stations only undamaged pump.

Hesitantly checking all corners of the parking lot, windows of the station and the darkening gaps between each tall trunk from within my vaguely safe cocoon, I mustered all the remaining courage I had and leapt forth.

To my shock and amazement, the pump still worked. Though the dial didn’t flicker to life, the sound of a jet of liquid bursting into the tank settled at least one of my worries. Still keeping tabs on my surroundings, I filled up on whatever that pump had left and said a silent prayer that this would be enough to get me to the end of the road.

For a moment I was prepared to climb back into the car and flee, but with the absence of that man and my mind still attempting to convince me that this situation wasn’t as dire as I was making it out to be, I stepped towards the door.

I’m thankful I didn’t take too long to collect my thoughts, as only a couple of steps from my car, a panel from the cover overhead came crashing down onto my passenger side door.

Smashing the window and taking my wing mirror was far better then taking me out, with that depressing thought I pressed on into the dying building.

It’s interior, though a carbon copy of the building’s prior, was only slightly altered by the cascade of shelves, roof panels and part of the wall that now lay scattered across the broken tiles. Vines creeped across the wall to my left as tree branches blocked the holes letting a portion of the afternoons light in.

The lady still leaning against her stroller, threatening to meld with it, stood motionless besides a shelf. Worn packaging and the surrounding debris covered her feet, but I could make out the lays logo from package her gaze was fixed to.

In a similar manner each shelf, once adorned with a wide selection of snacks, drinks and other miscellaneous items, now lay bare. Some small remnants collapsed to the cold tiles, the crumbling façade of this ever being used by an actual person only now dawning on me.

Walking over to the counter I expected to see that attractive cashier again. With everything that had been happening I almost forgot about her and how much she reminded me of my ex, but she wasn’t visible through the dirty plastic screen.

Not wanting to touch the eons of mould clinging to its surface, I peered closer. The same rusty metal containers and haphazard selection of debris, shelves and part of the wall covered the floor, though in amongst those was another shape.

Lying face down I could make out the shape of a person and by her green apron and black hair I could tell who it was. Although part of me wanted to jump the counter and leaver the ajar door open, I could tell I was far too late to offer any help.

Her twisted body mashed with the chair she’d been sitting at each time I sauntered over to pay. Her limps broken in and fused up to the legs of the chair as she conformed to the convulsing ageing of my vicinity.

Shooting down my spinal column and back up my stem, another feeling overwhelmed my pity for the crumpled shape.

That same projection of malus hit me like a semitruck. In my investigation of the building’s interior, I failed to keep tabs on my surroundings.

With an almighty crunch, I was sent hurtling into the perimeter wall of the building. A pain so unbearably hot welled up like a guizer from my right thigh and lower leg as I instinctually gripped to soften the throb.

Rapidly blinking through tear covered eyes stood the balding man. He too had aged as the building around us had, looking near ninety in contrast to his middle aged appearance.

His wrinkled skin and frail appendages a vast inverse from the force he’d applied on my now battered leg. His slender frame lunged forward again all whilst that venomous glare persisted.

In my foresight I rolled to my left, only just dodging his leap, and attempted to clamber back to my feet.

The pain in my leg was agonising but worse was the lack of feeling in my ankle and foot. In the way you get pins and needles, I could tell my foot was making contact with the ground, but I could in no way control it.

Limping to my feet, I dragged my crippled body to the only safe place left, all the whilst that man followed suit. He never spoke, didn’t even groan, just pursued like a starving animal, that had finally caught up to its pray.

Throwing myself in and hitting the gas with all the force I could muster through that twisted limb, the vehicle sputtered off the overgrown drive and back onto the road.

Evidently, I’d caught some glass on my frantic exit, but at least one of my tires was punctured as my body felt each bump. I’d just have to hope our damaged frames could hold out.

 

\-

 

I’m beat, I don’t know if it’s the blood loss or just the effect of traversing this road for half an eternity. I’ve done what I can to bandage my ankle and though I’m not a doctor, it looks and feels like an open fracture, if not a break.

My vehicle is in a bad way too, that panel and whatever I drove over clearly did a number on my passenger side. Coupled with that, I’m currently running on single digits.

My eyes and leg are crying for a moment of rest, which I’m closing in on.

We’ve stopped just before a bend in the road and through my flickering headlights I can see the vague outline of a long, thin sign. With me going the way of my car battery, I can see him, just down the road.

He’s a good half a mile away and is slowly dragging himself towards me.

And here I am, sitting in the front seat, listening to that poor facsimile drag its feet across each uneven bump in the road.

The battery like my tank, at their limit. With my ankle, what good would running do, I’d only end up back at that all too jovial sign, signalling another lap of these lanes.

I don’t know what he wants, but just like the other two mindless husks, some part of me knows he’s noting but a puppet.

That book got some use after all. If you find it laying in the discarded remnants of this vessel, vacantly leaning off an unassuming road, try not to make the same mistake I did.

If not, maybe you’ll see me, scanning the coolers, deliberating over two drinks.

Just another thrall tethered to this everlasting road, searching, desperately for an end unattainable.
