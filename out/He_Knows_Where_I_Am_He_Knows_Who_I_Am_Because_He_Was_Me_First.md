I don’t know how much time I have left. If you’re reading this, it means I’ve failed to escape him — the shadow behind every step I take, the breath in my neck I can never shake. I thought I could outsmart him, hide from him, but he knows everything. *Everything* about me. This is my last warning.

It started with small things. My phone would buzz when no one had messaged. My door, locked tight, was found unlocked sometimes. Footsteps behind me on empty streets. At first, I thought it was paranoia — but paranoia doesn’t send pictures of you sleeping, with the lights off, your eyes wide open, frozen in terror. He sent me those.

He watches me. Knows who I talk to, where I go, what I eat. He’s *inside* my life, a parasite feeding off my fear. I can’t even trust my own reflection anymore because I’m scared he’s looking through my eyes.

Then the messages started. Short, twisted, psychotic lines dripping with bloodlust:

*“I’m closer than you think.”*  
*“Soon, you’ll scream for mercy.”*  
*“I see your soul. It’s mine.”*

I tried to tell someone. The cops laughed it off. Said it was probably a sick joke. But last night? Last night was the proof I needed.

I woke up to a sound — wet, dragging noises coming from the kitchen. I froze. There he was, standing in the shadows, his face twisted into a sick grin smeared with blood. In his hand, a knife dripping with gore. On the floor, the body of my best friend. His throat torn open like a ripped book.

“You’re next,” he whispered. His eyes were hollow, a black abyss sucking all hope from the room.

I ran, but there’s nowhere to run when the hunter knows every path, every lock, every shadow you hide behind.

He left me a gift this morning — my own phone, with pictures. Pictures of me, asleep in my bed. But the final photo chilled me to the bone — me, eyes wide open, staring straight into the camera, but *not* me. Someone else’s face was carved into my skin.

  
I couldn’t scream. My mouth was dry, throat tightening like iron chains. I stared at that image, frozen, heart pounding so loud I thought it would burst through my ribs. Then I noticed something worse: the timestamp on the photo was *from last night* — after I’d gone to bed. But I don’t remember waking up. I don’t remember anything after midnight.

My hands shook as I scrolled through the rest of the pictures. The images grew darker, more twisted: my bedroom ceiling, but stained with thick red smears. Close-ups of my hands, trembling, blood crusted under my fingernails. A blurred photo of a shadow slipping behind the door — too fast to make out, but enough to freeze my blood.

Then came a video file, titled **“Your Last Hour.”** I didn’t want to watch it, but my eyes betrayed me. The video started with a shaky handheld camera — my bedroom, dark except for the flicker of a dying candle. The camera pans slowly over the room, revealing a trail of dark, sticky blood leading to the closet.

The closet door creaked open on its own. The camera shakily zoomed in, and I saw it — a pile of torn flesh and skin, grotesque and pulsating like a nightmare made flesh. Amid the gore, something moved. A pale hand crawled out, fingers twitching like a spider. Then a face emerged: distorted, unrecognizable, but *mine.* Or the twisted version of me.

The camera dropped to the floor with a thud. I heard ragged breathing, low growls, and then the whisper:

*“I’m already inside you.”*

I dropped the phone. My mind shattered.

Suddenly, the room’s silence was broken by a wet, scraping noise from the closet. I wasn’t alone.

I backed away, heart hammering. The closet door slammed open violently. A figure stepped out — a grotesque mirror of myself, covered in bloody scars, skin hanging in strips, eyes black voids burning with madness. His mouth split in a sick grin, teeth sharp and stained red.

*“You wanted to know who’s been watching you,”* he hissed. *“I am you. The darkness you tried to bury.”*

I tried to run, but he moved faster than humanly possible, grabbing me with hands like iron traps. Pain exploded as his nails dug into my flesh, ripping my skin. Blood poured like a river, mixing with the cold sweat on my face.

As I gasped for air, struggling, the last thing I saw was my own lifeless body lying on the floor — with that same carved face staring back at me. Then darkness swallowed me whole.

  
They say madness is a disease you catch alone. But what if madness isn’t just a sickness? What if it’s a parasite—an invisible infection that grows inside your mind, slowly twisting your perception of reality until you don’t know where *you* end and the darkness begins?

Because the body on the floor? That wasn’t just a corpse — it was the *real* me. The version of me who was aware, who wanted to live. The “stalker” wasn’t some outside monster hunting me down. He was a fractured fragment of my own psyche — a violent, relentless split personality that had taken over.

Every memory I thought was mine, every shadow I feared, every whisper behind me — that was *him* acting out, wearing my face like a mask while the real me was trapped inside my own head, screaming in silence.

So if you ever find yourself watching your own back, feeling like someone knows every step you take, be careful. Because sometimes the scariest predator isn’t out there in the dark. Sometimes, it’s the monster waiting inside your own mind, and it’s already one step ahead.
