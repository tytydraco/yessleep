“That thing,” Lake said, stumblin’ off the porch steps, “is evil. It’s unholy!” He fidgeted one-handed with his glasses, askew on his face, before leavin’ them be as he retreated to his car. The one eye had already swelled shut and his clothes were torn here and there, bits of blood leakin’ from a scratch or two. I’d known the town doctor now and anon for thirty year or more and took his words as somethin’ most certainly bein’ out of their correct arrangement. Lake was good at doctorin’, but he wasn’t no Christian.

“All right,” I said, doffin’ my hat to him as he was already off, lettin’ his conveyance roll downhill to get it started rather than crankin’ it. I looked to Jonas and allowed myself a giant sigh.

“Well, let’s get inside.” Jonas turned up the steps, crossed the porch and wedged himself through the door. For the fifth time today I pondered if the threshold was a little wider than before.

I suppose we shoulda known better. The land wasn’t ours. That Indian had smiled just the same, takin’ the last bit of money we had. He’d tucked the cash beneath his black hat and disappeared into the woods. My pap had been suckered with fool’s gold—we got fool’s land.

We passed up my room on the right. Emptier than I would have liked. Silla took ill and passed thirty miles from here. She’d been old, rich and beautiful but took her time dyin’ without the last two.

Their door was closed but Jonas’ wife was moanin’ and screamin’ in there, hopefully still tied up. He put his hand on the door, turned to me and nodded over that big black beard. He breathed and swung open the door.

Jonas was six steps in before I could see over or around him. For dignity’s sake, neither one of us wanted me in there, Twila’s legs tied down all akimbo and such. She was in nothin’ but her undergarments and here it was, seven in the mornin’ and a breeze from the lake chillin’ Jonas and me, but she was sweatin’ like she had been workin’ in a field in a high heat. Her hair was plastered to her hot, damp body, her white, diaphanous under things drenched and pasted to her alabaster skin, revealin’ all her shame, particularly where the bottom had hiked up over her plump hips and—

I cleared my throat and looked over at Jonas, hopin’ he hadn’t seen the look on my face. Despite the situation, I felt myself… respondin’. Sick or no, Twila was still a right bonny woman.

“I know.” Jonas’ eyes met mine and I could tell by his panicked look that he mistook my face. I wanted to breathe a sigh of relief, but didn’t want it caught wrong, so I let my eyes wander over to his wife again, this time avoidin’ certain places.

“So, what now?” I asked. Jonas took a careful step to the foot of the bed, lookin’ around.

“Where is it, honey?” A quiver was in his voice. Ten years ago, I wouldn’t have believed the feelin’ possible in him, but backwards and forwards Jonas loved this woman.  
She barked at him. Like some mongrel, she did. Then she started usin’ all kinds of filthy words the likes of which shouldn’ta been used in front of a woman, let alone *by* a woman.

She said, “Why don’t you *love* me?” ‘Ceptin’ she wasn’t usin’ the word ‘*love*’. “*Love* me, *love* me now. C’mon, you fatso, cain’t you get that crank turnin’? Botha you climb on toppa me now and *love* me from either end.”

We both kinda froze. She hadn’t spoken since the mornin’ after she’d gotten that cut on her arm, the same one that still hadn’t healed after three weeks. The last doctor had cleaned it and sewn it up, but it just wouldn’t close. It didn’t bleed no more, but it still *oozed.*

“Baby?” Jonas said, thinkin’ he was really talkin’ to his wife. “Is that you in there?”

“*Love* my face!”

The beaver crawled out from beneath her pillow.

“There it is!” Jonas stepped around to the side of the bed.

“Wait, wait, wait, wait!” I matched his shout-whisper tone, holdin’ my hands out as if to stop him. “We gotta be careful. It could still hurt Twila or us.” I grabbed up a shirt off the floor and netted it up in my hands, hopin’ I could snare it as I duck-walked closer.

“Yeah-yeah. Just like that. Real slow,” Jonah said.

The beaver stood on its hind legs, and I stopped, leanin’ back. It stared at me. I looked over and saw Twila’s eyes fixed on me too, ‘cept she had a big ol’ smile.

“I bet you know how to *love* me. A lot better than that beast of a man ever could.”

Despite the situation, I felt myself… respondin’. I was afraid to get closer, but a part of me did wanna jump on toppa her.

“I bet you *love* like a real man, don’t you? Why don’t you do it right now? Do it. Do-it-do-it-do-it-do-it-do-it-do-it—”

Jonas was quick. He reached a giant paw over and slapped the beaver in the back of the head. It scowled and tried to whirl on him, but the blow flung it over into the wall. It lay for a moment, stunned, but I didn’t move.

“*Get it!*” Jonas shouted, then, “Ooch!” I looked and saw him holdin’ the loop of jiggly fat hangin’ from his arm in one mighty fist. Twila smiled, the red on her mouth the same color as what was spillin’ out from between his clenched fingers. I turned back and saw the flat tail of the thing as it fled the bedroom.

“You’re on your lonesome!” I ran out after, the door closin’ a second later behind me. The beaver was halfway to the door when I realized it would be gone if it got outside. I couldn’t catch up.

There was a big block of wood on a little table Jonas was supposedly goin’ to fashion into a lamp or somethin’ for Twila someday. We’d made the whole cabin out of the wood from around us, used it to keep warm in the winter, to cook meals and whatnot—wood the beavers had been usin’ first, on land and water where they’d been livin’ on before we came. In fact, there was hardly any wood left for the beavers. We’d used most of it up. I scooped up the block and hefted it into the air. It landed perfectly on the thing’s back, makin’ a quick, crunchin’ sound. Its forelegs kept kickin’ but it wasn’t goin’ nowhere.

I moved closer, stooped, and snatched up the block again. I configgered that critter’s brown eyes, just the same as Twila’s as I stood over it. She was still moanin’ and screamin’ in there, but as I brought the block down on the beaver’s head over and again, Jonas was shoutin’ too.

“THE DOCTORS AIN’T WORK AND THE REVERAND AIN’T COMIN!” There was thumpin’ and crashin’ from in there. No doubt, Jonas was movin’ around bashin’ that big body of his into everything. “YOU WANNA *LOVE*! I’LL *LOVE* YOU! *LOVE* THE DEVIL RIGHT OUTCHA!”

There was gruntin’ and some other muffled sounds. I knelt there, pantin’, not knowin’ who was makin’ what noise, his voice was high, hers was low.

Somethin’ from outside turned my head. Just off the porch *they* were there. I don’t know how many, fifty at least, but there could easily have been a hundred. Beavers. All of them, standin’ and lookin’. Right at me.

I shut the door and put the bar up.

An instant later, they were on the cabin. I could hear them from every side—*chewin’*—not knowin’ how long it would be before they were inside, doin’ the same thing to me.

There was a loud *whump* from where Twila and Jonas were. I’d heard that once before when Jonas had fallen outta bed. I rushed in to see him sprawled on on his back, naked from the waist down, a worm hangin’ outta bush of a nest. His empty eyes stared out the window.

“He cain’t *love* me like no real man,” Twila said. “I done tol’ you so.” I didn’t look at her. My eyes were already locked in the same direction as Jonas’. On what was outside; still chewin’, still comin’, a carpet of ‘em as far as my eyes could see.

*Beavers.*

A colony didn’t seem fittin’, horde seemed the right kinda word just then.

The chewin’ was gettin’ louder and louder. I could barely hear her when she spoke to me, almost gentle.

“Come *love* me. *Love* me *now*.”

The block of wood slipped from hands that felt more detached from my body than numb. It didn’t feel like they were doin’ anything I woulda wanted ‘em to. In fact, my whole body felt detached, like I was sat up next to a sack of meat in overhauls that had been me.

Twila’s words or those things outside had pushed me right out of m’self and took the wheel. I was still right there, in the cabin, but my body was like a binocular—I could look and feel through it, but I was a million miles away. *I* wasn’t doin’ anything. Even after I heard them through my ears, finally chewin’ their way inside, that wasn’t me walkin’ toward her.

My hands floated up to my belt.

And despite the situation, I felt myself… respondin’.
