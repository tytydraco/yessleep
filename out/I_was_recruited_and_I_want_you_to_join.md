Please keep reading, I need your help. It’s the middle of the night and there is something in the garden, even though there is nothing there. That’s because the thing doesn’t have a body. Not even a shadow. How can this be? How can thin, summer air be somebody? Do you know an answer? No? Well, maybe I should start from the beginning and not the end of all of this. Then you’ll understand. Then you’ll be able to help me. 

 

I grew up in the beautiful city of Montreal as the significantly younger one of the two sons of French-Canadian parents. Both of them where descendants of some of the earliest settlers in what is now Québec, and I knew my heritage very well, because my father reminded me of it on an almost daily basis. He was a strict man, my father, and very proud to be Québecois, which is why he always assured us, that because our ancestors had intended it that way, we would never be leaving this land. And I believed him. All of the extended family lived up here, as well as basically every other person we knew. Everything that we had was here, and I was absolutely convinced, that not even the outbreak of a civil war in Canada could have made us move away. So, you can probably understand my surprise when we eventually did. Well, kind of. 

 

It was a few weeks ago on a Saturday morning. I had just gotten off a phone call with my brother who had moved out many years ago and lived in Boston now. We used to be very close though, and so I tried to stay in contact with him ever since. After he hung up, I threw my phone onto the bed and turned to my desk. Homework was scattered all across it, and I sighed reluctantly when I saw it and was reminded of all the deadlines that were due. I started to try and motivate myself to be productive, yet somehow, I ended up on TikTok. But then my father’s sharp, loud voice ripped me away from my procrastinating doomscrolling. 

 

“Louis! Get your ass down here immediately. IMMEDIATELY!”

 

You might think that sounds like I’m trouble, but that’s just how my father talks to me. My mother always says that he had good manners, my father, he just learned them during his time in Afghanistan, serving in the Canadian Military. It wasn’t his fault that he had been sent there by his father. My brother on the other hand always says that he never learned any manners whatsoever, be it when he was in Kabul in active duty or after he retired and returned. 

I laid my phone aside and went down the stairs. 

 

“Yes, Sir? What is it?”  
  


“Pack your things. We’ll leave in an hour”

 

“What? Why? And … and where are we …”

 

“We’ll explain later. Now go”

 

“But…”

 

“THAT’S AN ORDER!”

 

As I said, military manners through and through. I turned at my mother, but she was busy with her suitcase, obviously trying not to meet my eyes. I sighed, went to my room and reluctantly began to pack my things. A thousand questions whirled around in my head as I was trying to make sense of the situation. Where were we going? And why? Were we fleeing? That seemed strange to me, because the way I knew my father, I would have expected him to react to any major threat by simply not leaving the house and starting to sleep with a loaded and unlocked handgun – if he would be sleeping. I sighed again. The older I got, the more I understood my brother for having moved to Boston. 

Not an hour, but 45 minutes later we drove away. My parents were in an unusual hurry, and they didn’t say a word. They were as silent as graves. 

 

“Well?”, I asked carefully after some time. They ignored me. I started to get seriously worried. Had I done something wrong? I decided to text a friend of mine whose dad had been in the military too, which is why we always had been very understanding of each other. But when I searched him on WhatsApp, he was nowhere to be found. That was odd. Had I deleted him as a contact? I decided to text my brother instead, but I didn’t find him either. And then, all of a sudden, my phone went black. The dead screen mirrored my shocked face as I tried to reactivate it. Nothing. I looked up. To my immeasurable surprise, we were just about to cross the border. We were leaving the country! Now I wasn’t just worried anymore, now I actually started to panic. I asked both my parents repeatedly what was going on, and their apt responses which were meant to shut me up made me even more curious and insisting. This went on and on, and when we approached Boston, my father slipped. 

 

“Just tell me where were going!”, I said for the hundredth time. “I’m not even asking about what we’re doing or why, just where! Why are we driving…”

 

“BECAUSE HE NEEDS YOU!”, my father shouted violently, before immediately pressing his lips tightly together. He clearly had just said something that he was planning to keep from me under any circumstances. My mother was inspecting her fingernails. Of course she was. From this moment on, my parents turned back to being silent graves, only this time, they acted like I didn’t even exist. But that was not even the creepiest part. You see, my dad has always been very talkative, and he liked nothing more than to either tell his military anecdotes or to give an opinion on literally anything whatsoever. And the person he enjoyed talking to the most in the whole wide world was of course my mother. They always talked, often disputing with each other in a passionate way. I’m telling all of this to you because I need you to understand how genuinely insane this situation was. It was not just that they weren’t talking. They also weren’t moving. They just sat there and did … nothing. No facial expression. Not ever moving any body parts. I began observing my dad. Then I froze. His hands weren’t on the steering wheel anymore. The car drove by itself. 

I poked at my parents. They didn’t react. I sank back into my car seat, cold sweat running down my forehead. I felt terrible. How was this posible? And who had my dad been talking about? Who was “he”?

 

After several hours of constant driving, we arrived in a small town surrounded by thick forest. As we hadn’t stopped for lunch, I got extremely hungry and tired, which is why it was hard for me to keep track of where we were going. I had barely managed to stay awake, and the only thing that I was sure of was that we were in Carolina, but I didn’t even know in which one. 

The engine shut down. That’s when life came back into my parents; they turned back on like car engines being turned on. It was very disturbing. I sensed my heart pounding as it had never pounded before, my hands instinctively clenched into fists. I suddenly felt in danger. 

 

But nothing really happened. My dad told me to get my stuff. He locked the car, then we went inside, and I was shown my room. But I had enough. 

 

“Listen!”, I said aggressively, “I think this bullshit went on for long enough now. We just drove down the entire fucking East Coast and both of you didn’t say a word since New York. Now we’re in the goddamn South! The South! What the fuck are we doing here? Is an explanation really too much to ask for?”

 

“Go to your room”, said my father, threateningly calm. I didn’t move. For a moment, we all just stood there. Then my father pulled out a knife and pointed the blade towards me. He stared at me, his eyes bare of any empathy or emotion. He was ready to kill. I felt like a mouse spotted by an eagle. Or much rather like an enemy in a war. I felt my knees getting weak as I realized that this was the look my father used to give to those men that he killed. 

 

“GO TO YOUR ROOM! NOW! THAT’S AN ORDER!”

 

I had no doubt of what would happen if I dared to refuse. Slowly, I stepped into the empty room I had been given, walking backwards until I had reached the only piece of furniture there was: the small bed. My dad shut the door and locked it from the outside, before he began murmuring to my mother. I didn’t understand a word. My heart was racing, I breathed uncontrolled and frantically, in and out, while trying to make sense of what just happened. My father would have killed me! He had just been waiting for it. Maybe he still was. Maybe…maybe that was the reason they even brought me here. To kill me, to get rid of me, to sacrifice me! What was it? What was all of this?

 

I decided that this had to end. But my phone was dead. I tried my laptop. No luck. It was dead too. Nevertheless, I decided to get some sleep first. Tomorrow, I could try to escape somehow. Climb through the window, run away and then contact ne nearest police station. I quickly checked it and found it unlocked. I felt a wave of relief. Exhausted from what felt like the strangest, most terrifying day of all my life, I sank onto the small, uncomfortable bed and immediately fell asleep. 

 

When I awoke, I didn’t know why it had happened. All I could determine was that it had happened suddenly and without any transition whatsoever. I just … awoke. 

It was still night, but there was something peculiar about it. Only after a few minutes, I realized that it was the moonlight that shone brighter than I had ever seen it. Was I dreaming? No, that wasn’t possible. I stood up and stepped to the window, looking into the garden. I froze. My breath halted, as my hands gripped the window frame to suppress the upcoming panic within me. There, on the grass, stood a white plastic garden chair, facing the house. In it was sitting someone. Well, you see that’s where things got even weirder. I’ll try to explain. Imagine you’re in a room with someone, and your consciousness is fully aware of the presence of that person. So much so that it would be ridiculous to say that this person wasn’t there. And if someone claimed that you would obviously protest and hold against that, because you’re so certain of it. Because you can see the person, that’s why they’re there and you’re certain of that. I was certain too. But I couldn’t see anybody. There was nothing. Not even a shadow. And yet, simultaneously, there *was*. I wish I could just say it was a ghost, but it wasn’t. Look, I don’t know how to explain it. But you’ll know soon enough anyways. 

 

Ultimately, my curiosity won. I decided to climb out the window, but to my disappointment, I found it locked. My father must have done that when I was sleeping. Now I had no way to escape. Frustrated, I walked to the door and opened it. Then I realized what I had just done. I had opened the door. It was unlocked. Carefully, I snuck out to the kitchen and grabbed a knife. Then I moved towards the other bedroom where my parents where. Don’t worry, I wasn’t planning on stabbing them, I simply wanted to check. And I’m glad that I did, because I found their room empty and their suitcases gone. I began to frantically turn my head, as I felt my paranoia grow. They had left me here. Or they had been taken. Whatever it was, the answer was probably out there. I slowly moved towards the door leading out into the garden, while constantly turning around. I expected my dad to suddenly jump at me from a dark corner and slip my throat. Finally, I reached the door and turned around one last time to make sure nobody was behind me. Nothing. The dark, ghostly moonlit house was as silent as a grave. I turned the doorknob and stepped outside. The sound of a thousand crickets chirping through the night welcomed me. They were terrifying and unnaturally loud, it sounded like thousands of violently cutting saws. As I turned my head, I laid my eyes onto the most horrible sight I had ever encountered. Next to the white chair laid my parents, their arms and legs strangely twisted. The only reason I even recognized them was by their clothing, because their heads had been cut off. I felt like someone had just punched me in the guts. The crickets chirped louder and louder, an agonizing concert that tortured my mind, and then, slowly, a laughter arose, a laughter so terrible that it can make you lose your mind. When I sank down, I lost mine. 

 

I don’t know what happened next. All I know is that I’m sitting in here, in this room somewhere in Carolina, I’m at my laptop that suddenly works again, writing down my story for you. He’s still sitting outside on his throne, but it’s nothing against the other throne, the one in his kingdom. You’ll see. Don’t worry, you won’t be kidnapped like me. Reading these accounts is enough. And now that you arrived at the last lines, finally understanding, that I lied to you all this time and that it’s not me who needs you, but him, I only have one thing left to say: Welcome to the kingdom.
