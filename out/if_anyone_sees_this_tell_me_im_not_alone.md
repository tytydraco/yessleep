I don’t know how I got here.

I don’t know if this message will reach anyone, if these words will ever be seen by another pair of human eyes, but I have to try. It’s the only thing keeping me tethered, the last shred of proof that I existed before… before *this*.

The internet barely functions. Every site I visit is a graveyard of error messages, hollow white pages that refuse to load. I tried emails, social media, other forums, anything that might signal my presence, that might let someone—anyone—see me. But everything is dead.

Except this.

This single, forsaken forum.

I don’t know why it works. I don’t know if it’s a glitch, an anomaly, or something *else* allowing me to be heard. Maybe it’s all part of the nightmare. Maybe it’s laughing at me, watching me flail in the dark. But if you can read this, if my words still have weight in the world beyond, then I have to believe there’s still a way out.

But time is slipping. Faster each day. My thoughts unravel like thread pulled from a fraying tapestry. Each morning, I wake with the whisper of something missing, something stolen in the night. The world around me feels thinner, hollowed out, bleeding into nothingness at the edges. But one thing remains.

A certainty, rooted deep in my bones.

**Something is wrong.**

I remember coffee. The smell of it, rich and warm, coaxing me from sleep. My wife in the kitchen, her presence humming soft and steady through the morning. Sunlight spilled through the blinds, painting golden stripes on the walls, comforting, familiar. It was the kind of morning where the world felt *right*, where the air hummed with the quiet promise of normalcy.

The kids were sluggish at the table, half-awake, idly stirring their cereal. My wife handed me my coffee—just the way I liked it. I kissed her forehead, ruffled my son’s hair, and promised I’d be home for dinner.

Then I left. The same routine. The same commute. The same turn at the intersection where the streetlights always flickered.

And then—

I remember *leaving* work, the sun dipping low, tired but content. I remember the drive home. The warm glow of our windows. The smell of dinner drifting through the door.

I remember going to bed.

Then nothing.

Then I wake up **here.**

At first, I didn’t understand. The room was *wrong*. The light slanted in at an unnatural angle, the bed was stiff, unfamiliar. The air reeked of something sterile, suffocating. The walls—too white, too clean. Empty.

I sat up, the motion sluggish, my body sluggish. And then—I looked down at my hands.

They weren’t mine.

Thin, brittle, veined with blue like old paper crumbling at the edges. My breath stuttered. My stomach coiled. I turned, my gut a sinking stone, my gaze catching on the mirror across the room.

And the man staring back wasn’t me.

He was ancient. A husk of a man, skin creased and weathered, hair sparse and white, eyes sunken and rimmed with exhaustion. A stranger. A mask stretched over brittle bones.

I tried to scream, but the sound died in my throat. My heart jackhammered in my chest. I stumbled to my feet, legs trembling beneath me.

I had to find my wife. My kids. I had to understand what was happening.

The hallway was too bright, too pristine. The air stank of disinfectant and something artificial, something *wrong*. My footsteps were too loud in the stillness. Then—

A woman in scrubs, her smile practiced, gentle, too gentle.

“Mr. Patterson! You’re up early today.”

Her voice was syrupy, warm, *wrong*.

My thoughts stalled. My mind blared white noise. **My name isn’t Patterson.**

I opened my mouth, grasping for something solid, for my name, my home, anything—but my mind was an empty cavern, echoing with a question I couldn’t answer.

The day passed in a fog. The nurses—too kind, too *careful*—spoke to me as if I belonged here. The others—frail, hollow-eyed, adrift in routine—shuffled in silence. The TV droned on in the background, a static buzz I couldn’t focus on.

And then, suddenly—

**Night fell.**

That’s when the fear sank its claws into me.

First, it was the silence. Not the natural quiet of a sleeping house, not the distant hum of traffic or the whisper of wind against the windows.

This was a *hungry* silence. A thick, *swallowing* quiet, pressing down like something was *listening*.

Then—

A giggle.

Soft. Playful.

A *child’s* laugh.

I shot upright, my skin prickling, my breath trapped in my throat. The sound drifted from the hall, light, teasing.

My stomach churned. My son—

No. *Not here*. My son was home. He was safe.

**Wasn’t he?**

Shadows shifted beyond my door. Small. Barefoot.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my pulse hammering, my mind clawing for rationality. A nurse’s kid, maybe. Someone’s child up late, wandering.

Then—

*The footsteps came closer.*

The air thickened, dense with something unseen. I stared at the crack beneath the door, my breath shallow, my fingers gripping the sheets until my knuckles ached.

There it was—

**The giggling came again.**

Right outside my door.

I didn’t sleep. I watched the sliver of dark beneath the door, waiting for something I couldn’t name.

Morning came.

No one mentioned the laughter. No one spoke of the shadows. As if it hadn’t happened at all.

As if it was **only me.**

The days blur, slipping like sand through my fingers. My memories fade faster each morning. The nurses smile, their voices soft, patient. Too patient. The residents shuffle through their routines like they’ve done it forever.

But at night—

**The laughter grows louder.**

Sometimes, I hear whispers. My name, maybe. A *reminder*.

But **Thursdays—**

Thursdays are the worst.

Every Thursday at exactly 7:37 PM, my bed shakes. Not a tremor. Not a gentle vibration. A **violent** jolt, like something trying to rip the bed from beneath me. I sit up, gasping, clawing at the sheets—

*nothing.*

Only the clock, its numbers glowing.

**7:37.**

Then Friday comes, and it resets. The memories wipe clean.

Except lately—

I’m starting to **remember**.

Flashes. A dashboard. Rain. A road slick and black. Headlights. The screech of twisting metal. A crash.

**7:37.**

Thursday, January 30th.

And the laughter—

My son’s voice. My child’s giggle. But that’s wrong. *They’re home. They’re safe.*

Aren’t they?

**Who? Who is safe?**

Tonight is Thursday.

Tonight, the giggling will come.

Tonight, at 7:37, the bed will shake.

And at midnight—

**I won’t remember.**

I have to remember.

I have to remember.

*If anyone sees this…*

**Tell me I’m not alone.**
