Emily blinked blankly at us with an even more confused expression than before. “The *fucking* what now? Who- who the hell is [Mara?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/c20oj5vlfm)” 

I sighed as [Nate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/thOXUPRg0S) rolled his eyes. “I’ll explain once we get back to the van. Alive and all in one piece, yeah?”

Nate shot me a look. I put my free hand up defensively.

A trio of [vampires](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/c8ndszoGa1) suddenly rounded the corner and raced towards us. The oldest was a 260 year old girl that looked no older than 16. The other two vampires were older men, both 99 years old. They looked to be in their late 40s. 

“The middle one is 260!” I shouted to Nate as I set Gloria down on the floor, leaning her body against the wall. I had a choice, try to use my newfound power and dust the oldest vamp and expose myself in the process, or let Nate handle it and shield Gloria’s body from further harm. Mara knows how much I’ve scarred this poor woman already. 

The grip around my makeshift stake tightened as I prepared to go on the defensive. 

“There’s no way!” Emily shouted in disbelief. “She’s just a kid!”

The three vampires all bared their fangs at the same time, seemingly offended by Emily’s judgment. “Who are you calling a kid, lady? I’m older than you think!” 

Nate looked back to Emily and scoffed at the irony. “Yeah, and you just set that room on fire with your bare hands.”

The teen vampire lunged towards Emily. She jumped back in fright as a defensive small blast of fire shot out from the palm of her hand. Emily shrieked in shock and stared at her hands like her appendages were alien to her. The vampire kid dodged the attack and kept her distance.

“Good. That’s good, Emily! Keep that up,” Nate said, jumping in front of Emily to protect her. “Henry, you take care of Lefty, the girl is mine. Em… just try your best.” 

I nodded my head before jumping into the action. The vampire dude on the left hissed and threw a punch my way. I dodged, using my momentum to push myself around to his back. He quickly turned around, but I was quicker and jabbed the end of the paintbrush into his chest as hard as I could. 

He let out one last scream as his body burst into a cloud of dust. Once all the ash settled, it quickly melted into a familiar pile of black goo before seeping into the floor. I flipped the brush in my hand, blowing the sharpened handle like it was a gun I’d just fired. I looked at Emily and winked. “Piece of cake.”

She rolled her eyes and muttered, “gnarly,” under her breath as she looked at the scorch mark left on the floor. 

Suddenly, I was knocked off my feet and was pinned against the wall. I shouldn’t have let my guard down as the other 99 year old vampire had taken advantage of my loss of focus. He pressed my head against the wall so hard it felt like my skull was about to crack. He grabbed my makeshift stake out of my hand and jabbed it into the back of my shoulder. I cried out in agony as a hot burning sensation shot through my shoulder and down my spine. 

“Pathetic,” the vampire whispered into my ear. 

I readied myself to grab a mental hold over the vampire and break every bone in his body for what he did to me. However, I didn’t get the chance because before I knew it, the vampire was engulfed in flames, disintegrating right in front of me. 

Behind the smoking pile of ash was Emily, who had a wild glint in her eye. 

“Thanks,” I muttered out, using my non-injured hand to inspect the damage done to my shoulder. When I brought my hand back to look at it, a nice smear of blood welcomed me. 

Emily let out a breathless laugh. “No problem.”

Seeing the blood on my hand, she rushed over and started tending to me. All while this was happening, Nate was having a showdown with the female vampire. 

Nate stuck his hand out, aiming his focus towards the girl. Using her small and nimble frame to her advantage, she moved just fast enough to evade Nate’s grasp. She progressively got closer and closer to where she was eventually able to land a blow on Nate. The girl punched him so hard his head flew back with enough force to give him a concussion. He fell to the floor after being knocked back a few feet from the force of the blow. A small stream of blood trickled down out of Nate’s nose. His nose crinkled in pain and he spit out a mixture of blood and saliva in the vamp’s direction. 

I lunged for the remaining vampire, only to stop in my tracks as an intense pain shot through my shoulder. Emily pulled me back, still trying to fix a stray piece of cloth to my shoulder as a bandage. 

“Nate!” I called out worriedly.

He coughed before managing to pick himself up. “I’m fine!” 

“You won’t be after I’m done with you!” The teen said with a giddy laugh.

Nate steadied himself as the vampire returned to her same antics as before. Nate knew her fighting style better now and anticipated her next move. She went for his left, but he dodged and spun to the right. 

She corrected herself quickly, but not fast enough. Nate was finally able to take control over her body. The girl struggled and grunted, trying to free herself from his grasp, but to no avail.

Like out of *The Exorcist* or something, the vampire teen started to float up in the air, by Nate’s hand no doubt.

She yelped as her right arm bent out at an unnatural angle. Her left arm was next to go. She screamed in agony as all ten of her fingers snapped in all different directions. I winced at the sounds her body was making.

“Don’t like it, do you?!” Nate sneered, wiping  residual blood off of his nose.

Despite the obvious pain the girl was enduring, she still had the nerve to look down upon us. “P-p-please! I’ve suffered th-through worse! Give it your best shot, Chosen one.”

Nate narrowed his darkened eyes as he smirked at the challenge. “You asked for it.”

In one loud crack, the girl's body twisted and turned every which way. The vampire let out a death roar as Nate closed his hands together causing her body to implode, spewing burning black gunk everywhere. 

The room’s ambiance changed. An eerie feeling settled over the hall as the crackle of the fire roared, drowning all other sound out. Slowly starting to spread, leaving a trail of sizzling charred wood in its wake.

“Fuck, we have to get out of here,” I said clutching my shoulder.

Emily pointed at Gloria. “We can’t just leave the others!”

“We’re not,” I told her.

“C’mon, we have to get to the cafeteria quickly! This blaze is going to get out of control soon,” Nate yelled as he ran to Gloria and scooped her up in his arms.

Recalling the blueprints Nate had forced me to study, I led the charge to the large dining room. I was in front while Emily was behind me. Sandwiched in between were Nathan and Gloria.

“We’re going to have to fight,” Nate shouted as we rounded a corner. He snuck a glance behind him to the more inexperienced one of us.

Although I was in front, it was Nate who really led us. “We don’t really know how it’ll look in there. How powerful some of those vamps will be. Henry, you’re injured, but you should be able to help get the humans to safety. I’ll charge in and distract the vamps while Emily covers anyone that tries to come at you with the survivors. Sounds like a plan?”

“I can’t think of anything better,” I replied with a strained grunt. The pain in my shoulder was causing me to start feeling a little light headed. I pushed myself to keep moving further. There were people depending on us. On me.

Emily gave a curt and understanding nod. “I’ll do my best.” 

A silent understanding nestled between us as we finally reached the cafeteria. Were we ready? No, not really. I was tired and exhausted from fighting. I wanted nothing more than to soak in a hot bath and take a nap. I could tell Nate and Emily felt the same way. 

I gave one last look behind me before putting on a brave face and barging in. 

As soon as the doors burst open Nate handed Gloria off to me. “Get the rest somewhere safe,” he yelled.

“Big guy in the corner,” I said, examining the room, “748.” 

With my intel Nate got to work.

They’d been expecting our attack. When we barged in, some of the more experienced vampires were tasked with blocking the exit so it wouldn’t be as easy for me to get the hostages out. I needed to find an alternate exit.

In total there were seven vampires, including the two that had just turned. One was the girl from the delivery bay. Christ she was only 23 years old. The other was a taller and muscular guy that was 34. Out of the other older vampires, the youngest of them was 444. You already know how old the oldest was, about the same age as the one I accidentally murdered. Great.

The hostages were all gathered on top of those foldable tables you’d find in a school cafeteria. There were four humans, five including Gloria, all orderlies. There were three girls and a guy. Each one was assigned a vampiric bodyguard of their very own. They looked petrified.

While Nate wrestled with the oldest vampire in the corner and Emily struggled with the two at the door, I brought Gloria over to what I had deemed the safest place in the room. The window. The black out curtains were still drawn shut, so my main priority was trying to get rid of that. Maybe the sunlight from outside could take care of a couple vampires too.

Just then a loud thud came from outside the dark window. It went unnoticed by everyone except me. Nate was busy being thrown into a table while the roar of Emily’s fire distracted everyone else. 

I took a quick peek. A horrifying sight greeted me. The fire that started in the Activities Room had spread outside the confines of the building. Part of the fire now engulfed half of the lawn surrounding the mental hospital. The sound I’d heard belonged to an old, dead looking, oak that had fallen due to the conditions outside. It was partially aflame. The tree had fallen in a way where the branches blocked any and all direct sunlight from shining in. So that plan went out the window… Literally. However, it was still a viable escape route seeing as there was plenty of space for a person to crawl out the window and make it to safety. But there wasn’t much time. That tree was basically a giant piece of kindling

“Stop him!” One of the vampires shouted when I began tugging at the curtains, trying to rip them down.

One of the fledgling vampires lunged at me. It was the dude. I let him tackle me. If I’d dodged then he would’ve gotten a clean shot at Gloria, who was still unconscious. I could handle a blow. I did have an ace up my sleeve after all.

The deranged fledgling started trying to chomp down on my neck. Clearly he hadn’t gotten the memo yet. Wanting to make sure it wasn’t a fluke, I flicked my wrist slightly, envisioning what I wanted to happen. That similar buzzing sensation washed over me. He went to move but couldn’t. He grunted again, but was physically stuck. It hadn’t been a fluke or an off chance at all. I really could take control over vampires, just like Nate. 

In the chaos of the battle, I noticed Nate looking back at me before facing his adversary once more.  

In my anger, I snapped the fledglings neck. I hurriedly pushed his body off of me, scrambling for my paint brush and making it look like I stabbed him with it in case someone saw. The undead dead corpse quickly disintegrated into goo. 

With one less guard and the other vampires starting to get worn down, the human hostages were starting to get a little antsy. I took that as my cue to get back to work. With ease, the thick curtains and rod came crashing down after I tugged it with my food arm. A quick scan of the window showed it couldn’t be opened from the inside. All that was left to do was find a way to break the glass. 

“What’s taking so long, Henry?” Emily asked nervously.

“Take your time,” Nate said sarcastically, dodging another vampiric attack, “It’s not like we’re busy or anything!”

“I’m working on it!” I shout back. I remember the paintbrush. If I applied the correct amount of pressure and angled it just right, the glass would shatter in one devastating blow. Just as I’m about to, something catches the corner of my eye. A pile of black goo in the middle of the floor.

It hadn’t been there before. A bubble rose from the substance. Then another. The puddle was growing bigger, taking the shape of something larger.

“What the fuck is that?” I asked myself.

They’ll rise again at the spot where they first died and became a vampire. 

They come back. They always do.

The fledgling was killed in this room, and I’m guessing in that very spot.

It didn’t take long before the goop looked more and more like the fledgling I’d just off’d, and boy did he look pissed.

He managed to get the drop on me, immediately flying towards me. I’d never seen a vampire regenerate before and it put me off kilter. The fledgling ended up tackling me into the window where the glass smashed into smithereens. My upper body was hanging outside the window while my legs kept me grounded inside.

Welp, one problem solved at least.

“Shit!” I screamed in agony as glass tore into my hands and arms. The fledgling then roared in my face as it readied itself to launch a relentless attack on my behalf.

“A little help over here!” I added, trying to lean as far away from the creature as possible. The pain my body was in felt other worldly, completely shattering my ability to focus on anything else. Otherwise, I would’ve crushed the fledgling into oblivion, brought him back, then crushed him again.

A sudden blast of fire propelled the vampire off of me, leaving nothing left except for a small pile of ash. I looked over at Emily who currently resembled Eleven in *Stranger Things*.

From the looks of it, she was starting to get a better grasp on her powers. The two vampires that had been guarding the door were stuck in the middle of a large ring of fire. Their only choice was to stay in the circle or die trying to leave it.

“Thanks,” I said weakly, as Emily helped pull me out of the window frame, carefully dusting pieces of glass off my clothes. I spit on the pile of fledgling ash. 

“It’s not the first time I’ve saved you. If things keep going the way they are, then it most certainly won’t be the last.” She winked and gave me a pitiful smile as she looked at my injuries. “I’ll have to clean your wounds later.”

“Let’s not forget who saved you in the first place,” I chuckled, managing to stand up on my own two feet. “I don’t think I have any more fight left in me. Can you take care of the others while I get the hostages out of here?” 

Emily looked at the large broken window behind me and scanned it. She seemingly deemed it a worthy escape route with a nod before going over and taunting the three vampires by the hostages. 

I checked to see Nate’s progress with the big guy. They were still struggling, but the vamp looked to be quickly getting tired out. A couple seconds later, Nate managed to find a weak spot and the 748 year old went flying into the ring of fire that Emily had created. 

Like a strike in bowling, all three vampires got knocked into the fire and perished immediately.

Nate took a second to collect himself before aiding Emily. 

Once the hostages were no longer being guarded by vamps, I rushed over to them. It didn’t take long to convince them to follow me over the window. They had seen us fighting their captors after all. 

With Nate and Emily covering me, I brought the horde of hostages over to the window. I wiped stray bits of glass and broken wood off the base so nobody would get cut up climbing through the window. 

I was just about to start helping people out when one of the lady orderlies asked, pointing out the window, “Who’s that?”

I took a peek and noticed a feminine figure leaning against the dead bark of the tree. From sheer shock, I was able to mentally grab hold of her. I was not expecting to see the familiar biker-chick standing there.

“What the?” Harley said, struggling to move. She peeked behind me and saw Nate engaged in battle, not paying any attention to her. “Is this- is this you?”

“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t snap your damn neck right now!” I demanded.

Despite the position she was in, she still had the nerve to look smug. She scoffed and rolled her eyes, flashing me a fangy smile. “Despite what you might think, not all of us asked to be turned into this. Not all of us want to be monsters.”

“Explain the other night then,” I scoffed as bloody flashbacks filled my mind.

Harley sighed, “I was having a bad day.” She squeaked as I tightened my grasp on her. “I’m here to help you, idiot!”

I stared into her undead eyes, trying to gauge the validity of that statement. For all I knew, she was lying to me. I don’t know why, but my gut was telling me she wasn’t. It was telling me to trust her. I released my grasp over her. “Then help me.”  

Together, we helped the rest of the humans out of the window and to safety. Gloria was the first one out since she was unconscious and the most vulnerable. The others helped me get her out of the window, seeing how injured I was. 

“Get them to safety,” I told her when everyone was out. Harley nodded and, with Gloria in her hands, rounded up the traumatized humans and took point from there. The sun had set by then allowing her to leave the shady confines of the burning oak safely.

I looked back to see Emily deep frying the last of the remaining vampires.

A heavy mix of relief and exhaustion settled over me. Maybe it was the blood loss or just knowing that the fight was finally over, but I passed out.

***

The stinging sensation of peroxide being poured on my hand brought me back. Once the pain dulled enough, I realized I was in the back of the delivery van. It sounded like we were on the road. Emily was tending to my wounds.

“He’s awake!” She shouted over her shoulder to Nate. It looked like she'd made a DIY first aid kit out of a few medical supply boxes that had been left in the back of the van. I winced as she dabbed a cotton ball over the biggest cut on my hand. 

He shouted back, “He’s alive. That’s good!”

A couple of minutes passed as she finished bandaging me up. My hands, arm, and shoulder were all bandaged up tightly. The wounds I’d sustained during the battle were all cleaned and medicated. “Thanks,” I said, sitting up.

“It should be me thanking you, really,” she told me as she packed up the medical supplies. “Thank you for what you did back there. Getting me out of that place.”

“It was no problem,” I said, waving my bandaged hand. “Anyone could do it.”

This garnered a chuckle from her.

“Nate,” I yelled, “how far out are we from the motel?” 

“About thirty minutes,” he answered.

“That’s a relief,” Emily sighed, “I could use a nap.”

“We all could,” Nate added. I shook my head in agreement.

“Mind explaining to me what the hell all that was?” Emily asked. In the heat of everything else happening I’d totally forgotten I’d promised to fill her in.

“So, it turns out the three of us were chosen by The Goddess of Life, Mara (hence why we’re called Mara’s Chosen Few) and given these special abilities. Using these powers, our mission is to eradicate vampires. Creatures created by the God of Death- who wants all of his sisters creations to die horrible and painful deaths because she kicked him out of her garden.”

Emily scrunched her eyebrows together, creating a confused look on her face.

“It’s hard to wrap your head around, I know,” I chuckled. “I just learned all this too.”

She took a second to try and process that information before asking another question, “How were we chosen?” 

“I’m not really sure, but the one common factor is that we all had near death experiences. Nate was in a car accident and I almost drowned. What was yours?”

Emily chuckled ruefully. “I fell off a ladder. I’d been helping my dad do some work around the house and he’d needed me to do something on the roof. A strong gust of wind caused the ladder shake, throwing me off. I fell thirty feet and landed on my back.”

I winced in pain for her. That couldn’t have been pleasant.

“I was honestly surprised to wake up in the hospital,” she continued, “I for sure thought I was a goner. Then, after some intense physical therapy I was able to walk again with a walker. I got to go home and continue healing. Then, I was frustrated and in pain during a PT session and got mad at my dad who was just trying to help. That’s when I first used my powers. I accidentally set the house on fire, and it wasn’t a tiny fire either, it was this large blaze. Bad enough to get me put in that mental hospital.”

My heart bled for Emily. She seemed so hurt and traumatized retelling her story to me.

She laughed, trying to lighten the mood. “Way to start my 20s off, am I right?” 

“How- how long do you think you were in there?” I asked, remembering all this happened right after her 20th birthday.

“A couple of weeks maybe, months? My mind is all hazy from when I was there, so I’m not entirely sure.” 

“Emily,” I said softly, grabbing her hand firmly. I didn’t know how to deliver the news to her, but I had to. “You’ve been in that mental hospital for the better part of four years. You’re twenty four now.” 

She looked shocked to learn that, as any normal person would be learning that they lost four years of their life. A tear rolled down her cheek. Trying to comfort her, I put my hand on her shoulder and rubbed it gently. Suddenly, she grabbed my wrist.

“Talk to me?” She pleaded, staring me in my eyes. “About anything. It’ll make me feel better.”

I obliged her, telling her my life story. I talked about the bar, Marty, Gladys, anything and anyone I could think of. I even tried my best to catch her up on global events she’d missed.  After a while Emily opened up and started telling me more about herself. We traded life stories and experiences. 

It felt refreshing to see Emily in this new light. I actually kind of knew her now, and it turns out she’s a lovely person.

“Got any water up there?” She asked Nate. Crackling noises emanated throughout the van and a second later she was handed a large plastic water bottle.

She took a swig then held the bottle out to me. “Want some?” She offered.

I declined. Watching the water slosh around in the bottle made me realize just how bad I had to pee.

Emily shrugged before downing more than half the water bottle in a couple of gulps. She must’ve been really thirsty. I guess having the ability to summon fire at will dehydrates you pretty quickly. 

The van suddenly rolled to a stop. Nate banged on the roof of the vehicle. “We’re here.”

“Thank god!” I shouted as I opened the vans back doors. I’d never been more relieved to see a seedy motel in my life. A seedy motel with a bathroom!

My bladder felt like it was about to burst, so I didn’t wait up and grabbed my room key. After unlocking our room door, leaving it slightly ajar, I rushed to the single bathroom and did my business. I heard it click shut from the bathroom a minute later.

After flushing and washing my hands, Nate greeted me when I opened the door. 

“Need to use the lou too?” I asked jokingly. 

I was met with a serious face. Not a smile or a laugh. An uneasy feeling settled in the pit of my stomach. Nate lying about his ability suddenly came to the forefront of my mind.

“I’m sorry,” he said, sounding remorseful. I felt a sudden stinging pinch on a patch of forearm that wasn’t covered in white medical bandages. 

I looked down to see a small red welt forming on my skin, something small, sharp and black was sticking out of it. In Nate’s hand was a pair of tweezers with a bee pinched between it. Its rapid wriggling slowed as the insect started to die.

I looked at Nate confused as pain and panic flooded my mind. He knows I’m allergic to bees, so why did he do that?  Where the heck did he even get a bee from in the first place?

My skin started to feel itchy. I pushed past Nate and stumbled about the motel room, panicking. I reached for the Epipen in my pocket. I quickly jammed the device in my thigh, but the button wouldn’t press down. That’s when I realized it was empty.

Then I remembered I’d used it to try to override the drugs in Emily’s system. Emily!

 “Where’s Emily?” I asked through gritted teeth. I sat down on one of the beds. My head felt fuzzy and light.

“Relax. She’s in the van, sleeping. I slipped a mild sedative in the water.” 

“Why?” Was all I could think to ask as heat spread through my body. My throat was in the beginning stages of closing.

 “I’d try to explain, give you my reasons, but what good would that do? You’ll be dead in a minute anyway,” Nate said coldly, staring me in the eye. He then gently pushed my shoulder, causing me to fall on my back. 

I was too weak to move. Too tired to say anything. All I could do was turn my head and watch Nate grab his things and quickly leave the room. At least he left the door open for someone to easily find my dead body.   

As an inky blackness encroached my vision, the last thing I saw was the delivery van pull out of the parking lot and speed away. 

I blinked slowly a couple of times, taking everything in. I’d been betrayed. I felt hurt and bitter, but also somewhat relieved.

In the end, I’d found my purpose after so many years of searching. I fought the good fight and I’d fought it hard. Sure, I had regrets. A lot of them actually, having trusted Nate being my biggest. But, hey, at least I could die a content man knowing I got to have one big adventure, having saved one life out of it.

At least I had done a little good in my life, right? 

My consciousness, and subsequently my life, slipped away from me.

***

I woke up somewhere soft and warm. It smelled like my favorite floral scents: lilacs and lavender. When I picked myself up I discovered I was in a place that was full of eternal beauty and overwhelmingly familiar. Like it was home, but also so… unreal. Like it was a scene plucked right out of a fantasy novel.

I was in the Garden of Mara. Sitting across from me on a smooth quartz bench was The Lady of The Garden herself. “Do not worry,” she chuckled, “you’re not dead. I’ve seen to that. Soon you’ll wake up good as new, as if that bee never stung you.”

I let out a breath of relief. If the Goddess of Life tells you you’re going to live, you believe her.

“Come child,” she patted the spot next to her on the bench, “we have much to discuss.”
