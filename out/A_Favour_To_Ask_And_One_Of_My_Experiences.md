I'm trying to start a podcast called Scary stories to give you chills, and I was just wondering if any of you would mind either sending me or commenting your personal experiences with the supernatural or just the natural so I can read them out, it would be a great help to kickstart the podcast, I can give a mention to your reddit username if you would like me to or if you would prefer to stay anonymous I can also do that, it's just down to your personal opinion in all honesty, but I have always had an interest in hearing about these kinds of things that people have gone through and I want to share those experiences so that other people can be aware of what lies in the dark or even for other people who share my morbid curiosity on the matter, but again if you are feeling up to it I would love to read your personal experiences and share them (again with credit given if you want me to) so please just do let me know by either messaging or commenting your personal experiences whether they are scary, creepy or down right horrifying.

I will start with a personal experience of my own, it was horrifying to me, and for this reason I will never step foot in the woods at night ever again, I live and the UK and obviously its very uncommon for something like this to happen, seeing as normally the stories that you hear are almost always from the USA, anyway I was about 15 or so at the time and I had been staying at a friend's house throughout the day, it was getting pretty late id say it was about 10 PM or so and every time I would stay at my friend's house I would always walk along a specific path home, it led up to some stairs that were surrounded by trees all the way up, No lights up the stairs AT ALL it was the sort of stairs that are made of mud but have the plank of wood to keep the mud in place. But also to the right there was a pathway that was pretty heavily wooded, its not really a long path, the stairs however was a pretty long way.

One night I was walking home from a friends house and had decided to go up the stairs, as I was walking up them I realised it was deathly silent and so I started to speed up while going up the stairs, I wanted to get out of there as quick as possible, while I was walking up the stairs I started hearing rustling noises around me, this obviously freaked me out so I'm pretty much sprinting up these stairs and then the rustling kept getting louder and closer no matter how fast I was running up the stairs, my heart felt like it was about to pound out of my chest, my legs started aching and then the worst thing happened, I reached the top of the stairs and I felt air go straight past my neck, bare in mind that there was no wind that night, but it almost felt like someone or something had tried to make a swipe at me right at the back of my neck, I turned around and there was nothing, no one there I ran the last part home, lung screaming for air, my heart still pounding, adrenaline pumping through my veins. As soon as I made it over the threshold and into the house and closed the door, I dropped to my knees. That whole situation had freaked me out that to this day I will NEVER go through that wooded area or any other at night. I am now 21 Years of age and in all honesty I don't think I will ever get over what happened.
