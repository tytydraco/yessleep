Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10n23y4/i_think_i_got_a_man_killed_part_2/

Up until yesterday, I would've said my dog was absolutely fearless.

I've  watched all 35lbs of him tell off a full sized Great Dane without batting an eyelash at the dog park. He defeated the Roomba monster, could care less about thunder, and will actually supervise a room being  vacuumed.

Last night though? He actually whimpered and started shaking.

We  were taking our usual nightly walk around 8pm, about a mile long going  past my town's elementary school. Next to the school is a patch of  swampy woods. Normally there are street lights evenly spaced along the  road. This whole week though the street lights were winking out one by  one. It's been mighty cold lately, maybe the new LEDs couldn't take the  cold, right?

Well, maybe not.

We  get to the patch of woods next to the school and my dog just freezes in  place. I walk up next to him and ask him what's wrong. And he's just  staring into the darkness, frozen in place, starting to shiver.

When I touch him? He didn't respond.

Then I heard some ice crackle, and my pup noped the heck out of there. Started whimpering and SPRINTING back towards home.

I  might have been born at night, but it wasn't last night. I was feeling  the creepy crawlies now too. So we started beating feet back towards  home.

He didn't let up the entire  time, and I was having trouble keeping up and keeping my footing, so I  never really got a good look at anything behind us, though lord knows I  looked over my shoulder when I was able. Really only saw something  indistinct in the dark. Larger than the rabid fox I dragged my pup away  from last week, smaller than an adult human.

It wasn't a child. Not on a night that cold. Surely not.

We  make it home safe and sound, and my dog doesn't even pause for a treat.  He sprints up the stairs, jumped on the bed in the guest room, and  stared out the window, still shaking.

I looked too, didn't see anything, and just shrugged it off. Was weird, but it is what it is, right?

Wrong.

This  morning while I was rolling my garbage cans back up towards my house my  neighbor grabbed my attention, wants me to take a look at something.

There's  a set of tracks in the snow, leading up to his chicken coop. Very small  sneakers that walked onto his lawn from the road and up to his chicken  coop. Which looked like a horror movie. Blood and feathers everywhere,  no other damage. No signs of any birds.

When I say no other damage I mean the chicken wire wasn't damaged and the only way in was a door. Which was closed.

A similar set of sneaker tracks lead back from the coop to the road.

I  started getting a creepy crawly feeling, goosebumps and all. I tell my  neighbor about my experience last night walking the dog. He starts  shifting uncomfortably too.

The dog was his normal happy courageous self today, seemed like nothing had happened last night.

Until just now, when I grabbed his harness for walkies. Called him, no response.

He's back at the window in the guest room, staring and shivering.

Only this time there's something I can see under the street light out front of my house.

A  child. Standing there in the cold staring at my house, not moving or  shivering despite the cold. Dark brown clotted blood running down his  chin and onto his chest, and a bloated stomach.

As  soon as I made eye contact with the child? The street light went pop!  and there was darkness. I am scared shitless and just locked all the  windows and doors in my house, but if someone wants in? They're gonna  get in.

What the fuck is it? Do I call the cops?
