*My parents and brother were sitting on the living room couch, dead. With their necks tore open. I dropped the bags and ran to their bodys crying. I was so devastated that I didn't even realize or think that they can still turn into zombies or the fact that if they didn't turn into zombies then the zombie/zombies that did this could still be very close.*

&#x200B;

*As I was crying I heard movement, I looked up to see 3 zombies walking slowly towards me. I was confused on why they were walking so slow until all of a sudden I heard movement coming from below me. I looked towards my dead family and saw they were slowly moving. My now zombie brother grabbed me and tried to bite me.*

&#x200B;

*I blocked it with a pillow I grabbed just in time and bolted away from the zombies. I grabbed the bags I dropped and was about to exit out the door when I saw another zombie coming in from the door. For some reason all of these zombies were slow but I didn't care as it gave me time to move quickly away from them.*

&#x200B;

*I ran up the stairs next to the front door and locked myself in my room. I put my bags down and started to drag my dresser to the door when all of a sudden I heard loud bangs outside, I ran to the window and looked outside to see a zombie somehow climbing the flat wall of the house.*

&#x200B;

*I was perplexed as I just stood there and watched it slowly climb to the window. The zombie reached the window and began to hold on with one hand and bang with the other on the window. I finally snapped out of it and grabbed a baseball bat I had as a collection from my closet.*

&#x200B;

*I ran to the window, opened it, and began to smack the zombie with the baseball bat. It had no effect as the zombie began to climb in. I threw the baseball bat down and began to use my foot to smash the zombie back. It took about 3-4 hits until it finally fell to the ground.*

&#x200B;

*I looked from out the window and saw that the zombie fell at the angle where its legs had completely snapped. The zombie began crawling towards a car that I just noticed. I was confused on why until I saw a girl underneath it.*

&#x200B;

*I shouted towards the girl but she was already scooting from underneath the car. Once the girl got up I saw she had a quiver and a bow. She shot the zombie in the head and then looked around until she saw me.*

&#x200B;

*It looked like she was about to say something until she turned around and shot an arrow at something. I was confused until I saw a zombie run from behind a house with an arrow in its chest. I was even more confused on why there were fast and slow zombies.*

&#x200B;

*The girl shot again and this time the arrow hit its mark, the head. The zombie dropped and 3 more fast zombies came running from behind the house. The girl then took off running towards my bike and was barely able to start to pedal away when one of the fast zombies jumped on to her.*

&#x200B;

*She fell off the bike and tried to reach for her bow but another zombie came and started to bite her hand. I watched in horror as the zombies began tearing into the girl's flesh. I got scared when I noticed that one of the zombies stop'ed chewing and was staring directly at me.*

&#x200B;

*I closed the window and sat on my bed to think about what I should do next. My family was dead, I had no weapons, only a limited amount of food and water, and I couldn't leave the house. I decided to try to make a better weapon out of my baseball bat.*

&#x200B;

*I took a pocket knife from my dresser and began to sharpen the top of my baseball bat into a spear. As I was doing this I heard running footsteps outside. I put the baseball bat and knife down on my bed and ran up to the window to see what was going on.*

&#x200B;

*I saw about 5 people with bows and quivers shooting zombies from every direction. Somewhere slow zombies, some were fast zombies, and some were dodging arrows. But even more strange was what these people were saying, ‘’FZ’’ FIZ’’ ‘’SZ’’.*

&#x200B;

*I watched as they killed zombie after zombie until there were none left. They started talking until one of them pointed towards one of the dead zombies. I looked closer at the zombie and saw it was the girl with the bow. I put 2 and 2 together and realized that she must have been with these 5.*

&#x200B;

*Two of the people in the group ran up to the girl crying while the other 3 hugged each other. For some reason I thought of this as the perfect time to yell for help. All of them immediately pointed their bow at me. I screamed don't shoot but instantly regretted it.*

&#x200B;

*I looked around from out the windows and saw no zombies, I breathed a sigh of relief until all of them immediately started to aim at something. I looked towards where they were aiming and saw a zombie crawling fast as hell.*

&#x200B;

*They all shot at the same time but it jumped in the air and dogged every single last arrow. I stood in disbelief as it started to slowly kill the entire group.*

&#x200B;

*I quickly closed my window, grabbed my baseball bat, and ran into the closet. I was scared senseless and had no idea what type of zombie that was, it was fast, crawling, and can doge. After about 2 minutes of sitting in my closet shaking, my phone started to vibrate.*

&#x200B;

*I took my phone from my pocket and saw that there was a message from ‘’Unknown’’. I clicked on it and it pulled up a text message saying, I am the cause of the zombie apocalypse.*
