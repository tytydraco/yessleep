Our nightmare began on a Thursday afternoon. My husband Jason and I were heading to Maine for a much-needed week-long staycation at his family’s lake house. We hadn’t had a proper vacation in ages, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic and other life stresses. Little did we know, this trip would be far from the relaxing break we had anticipated.

I over-packed as usual, stuffing the trunk and frunk of our car with everything we might need. Jason, ever the minimalist, packed only the essentials. We left Ohio around 2:00 PM, knowing it would be a long drive to Maine. We mapped out our route, prioritizing charging stations, which unfortunately added extra time to our journey.

A few hours in, Jason noticed we needed to stop at the next charging station as our battery was running low. I was relieved because I needed a coffee and a restroom break. We pulled into a generic gas station with a few charging stations beside it. Jason plugged in the car and went inside to get my usual coffee order. Meanwhile, I headed to the restroom.

As I was finishing up, a man entered and looked at me with a creepy smile. “My oh my, what a handsome young man,” he said. I’m 31 but look much younger, often mistaken for someone in their late teens. I awkwardly thanked him and hurried out. To my discomfort, I noticed the man had followed me out of the restroom. I quickly walked back to our car where Jason was watching Netflix while the car charged. The man glared at me, making me uneasy, but I kept it to myself.

We charged for another 30 minutes before hitting the road again. Around 8:00 PM, I noticed a black sedan had been following us for the past hour. Feeling paranoid, I mentioned it to Jason. He reassured me, reminding me we were on a highway, which calmed me down a bit. I tried to shake off the feeling and eventually fell asleep.

When I woke up, we were in New York. I was surprised we hadn’t stopped to recharge in Pennsylvania, but we needed to find a charging station soon. I glanced in the mirror and saw the same black sedan still behind us. My anxiety spiked, but I convinced myself it was just a coincidence.

Jason suggested we find a hotel with a charging station since he was exhausted and I couldn’t drive due to my medication. We found one in Massachusetts. After a quick stop at a gas station for coffee and snacks, we headed to the hotel. Jason dozed off again as I watched some Netflix, trying to keep my nerves in check.

The hotel turned out to be more of a motel, old yet modern. Jason collapsed onto the bed the second we entered our room. I went out to the balcony to admire the night sky and get some fresh air. From there, I could see the parking lot. Four vehicles were parked: presumably the receptionist’s, the caretaker’s, our car, and a black sedan. My heart sank. It was the same car.

Fear gripped me, but I tried to convince myself I was being paranoid. I went back inside, locked the balcony door, and lay down next to Jason. I woke up to violent banging on our door, far from a housekeeping knock. Terrified, I shook Jason awake. He immediately went into protective mode, instructing me to call 911.

The man outside shouted, “I know you’re in there, handsome.” My blood ran cold. I frantically explained to the 911 operator while Jason held the door back. I told him about the man from the gas station. Jason fought to keep the door shut, but the man was relentless. Suddenly, the door burst open, and the man charged in.

Jason tackled him, yelling for me to lock myself in the bathroom. I didn’t want to leave him but knew I had to. The operator tried to calm me as I heard the struggle outside. Then, I heard Jason cry out in pain followed by a heavy thud. My worst fears seemed to be coming true.

Fueled by adrenaline, I grabbed the nearest object for a weapon. I wouldn’t let this man hurt Jason or escape. I burst out of the bathroom and saw the man trying to flee. I attacked him with everything I had, blinded by rage and fear.

The police arrived just in time, pulling me off him and securing the scene. Jason was alive, though badly hurt. We spent the rest of the night giving statements and at the hospital.

We later learned the man was a sexual predator with a history of stalking and harassment. His primary targets were young men. Thankfully, he was caught and put behind bars indefinitely. Jason and I didn’t get our staycation, but we did survive to tell the tale—a tale that still sends shivers down my spine every time I recount it.
