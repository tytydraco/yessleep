Tiff was Autumn’s mother. Autumn was Tiff’s daughter. For years both of them had kept it secret. Not even Randall, who'd been here for both of their employments, had known. The revelation made me gasp, stumble back, sink down in horror against the freight trailer wall.

But first.

Before we get into the details of everything that came next, we need to do something else.

Let’s pause.

There are some things I should tell you about Tiff. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

She was a good mother.

That’s what *she* liked to think, at least. Her husband’s idea of her often came out in slightly varied wording: *lazy, distant, stubborn, selfish.*

Tiff didn’t mind much. She’d known from the start not to trust his opinion. You couldn’t trust somebody dumb enough to get his girlfriend pregnant in high school, after all. He wasn’t Tiff’s first choice of a husband (or even tenth), but that’s just how teen pregnancies worked back then, especially in small towns. You didn’t just get stuck with one child. You got stuck with two.

Marriage, however, was where gender conventions ended. Tiff was never one of those doting wives with dinner steaming on the stove at six and a duster as a permanent extension of her arm. She was the one who worked. Her *husband* was in charge of the baby―but mainly the booze. He took his responsibility very seriously. The second one, that was. 

Tiff was rarely home. She drove most weekdays, most weekends too. Trucking was the easiest job for somebody who’d never finished high school and had an entire family to support.

*She wants you*, her husband would tell her. *Men aren’t meant to care for infants like women are.*

*They aren’t,* she would agree. *They’re meant to work.*

He disliked that answer.

When she caught sight of an advert for a Route 333 position, she applied. The job was close to home. It was no difficult decision to go in for an interview. When she was offered a spot and informed of the pay, it was even *less* difficult of a decision to accept it.

 After two years of struggling to both visit her daughter and make ends meet, Tiff could finally switch to a mainly normal work week. Sure, she was gone most week nights, but on the weekends, she took her daughter to the movies. She pushed her on the swing and tucked her into bed. She wrapped bandages around scrapes and bruises.

There were downsides.

This new route was no normal route, to say the least. It didn’t take long to notice the oddities. She did obey the rules. She stayed away from anything suspicious or dangerous, but even so, sometimes dangerous things found her.

During one such occasion, every window and door in the gas station disappeared into flat smooth wall. Every employee turned on her, with teeth and claws and animal eyes. She killed them all with a crowbar, then smashed her way through the concrete wall with a sledgehammer over the course of hours.

*Leave,* she told her husband the next day. *You’re no longer welcome here.*

What was he compared to the gas station? He was lint flicked from a sleeve.

Years passed. The road lengthened. It populated with sedans and SUVs. When her daughter asked her what she did, Tiff would give her vagaries. Trucking. Hauling. Transportation. Boring work.

 Her daughter was young. She never pressed.

Tiff watched her friends lane-lock. Some gave up and settled, faded away in memory. Others kept driving. Often they were killed. Her time was coming too. Her rate of expansion was quicker than other drivers, and without her husband sucking away money, she no longer needed this job like she once had. 

Tiff noticed the signs. Stars flickering. Sudden expansion. Management tried to persuade her to stay oddly enough, even after she pointed out the clues from the handbook. Perhaps they didn't fully understand her plight?

She quit.

For years after, life was calm. She took a local position at a diner. She used her substantial savings to raise her daughter.

As Autumn grew, she struggled. Tiff never knew how to help. Teachers would say sit and Autumn would jump on her desk. She got into fights in high school. She lashed out at authority figures. 

Autumn had always been a bright girl―all parents believed so about their children, but Tiff knew this for a certainty. For a month, Tiff forced her to stay home and study for the ACTs. They fought. Autumn despised sitting still, but in the end, it was worth it. Her scores overshadowed her grades, and by the final bell of senior year, multiple universities had accepted Autumn.

*She won’t end up like me,* Tiff let herself believe.

And then Autumn did.

She dropped out of college. Tiff argued with her. Their arguments often escalated to screaming matches over the phone. It changed nothing.

*Try trade schools*, Tiff encouraged. People could still make a solid living with trades.

Autumn did. She tried a dozen. She really did try―Tiff believed her―but even so, she left them all within weeks. Eventually, in her search, she found a job at a nearby company doing what her mother had used to do. A position on Route 333.

*Don’t,* Tiff begged.

*It’s my decision.*

And it was.

Tiff gave her tips. She timed each of her daughter's drives. Autumn was new. She shouldn't have to worry about lane-locking yet, but even so, Tiff pestered her for any hint that it might be fast-approaching.

Sometimes, you can do everything right as a parent, and terrible things still happen. 

Something terrible did.

The worst part was the lack of closure. There was no police at Tiff’s doorstep or phone call from the company. How had they handled the disappearances in Tiff’s day? Surely not like this. There was no singular moment in which she realized her daughter wouldn’t be returning. There was only a sickening, dawning realization over the course of days: *she should have arrived home by now, shouldn’t she?* And a few days later: *perhaps she’s still coming.* And eventually: *it’s over.*

Had it been lane-locking? The Faceless Man? Had a gas station gone deadly like it had done to Tiff over a decade ago?

Her ex-husband called. Tiff told him nothing. He was suspicious. He deserved to be.

For one terrible week, even worse than that week in high school when a second line had appeared on a pregnancy test, Tiff did nothing. She didn’t mourn. Her daughter might live to ninety―what right did she have to mourn? For one week, she simply existed.

The next week she went in for an interview.

It wasn’t hard to fool them. They never would have hired her had they known how close she was to lane-locking or her true reason for applying, so she never told them. In the interview, she lied. Said she’d made it to the turnaround point when she hadn't. For someone like her, it was much too far to meet the minimum requirement. When they asked her to describe what the first weigh station looked like, she did. After all, things on Route 333 rarely changed.

Before, Tiff had worked under her married name, Autumn’s last name. Now, she worked under her maiden name. She claimed her daughter had died from cancer. No one knew. No one needed to. When she was young, she’d been taught to tell the truth, to do right. As she grew, it all became so much more confusing what exactly that right thing was, a million strings tangled together in an untangleable clump. The more you tugged, the tighter they knotted.

Not anymore. For once, the correct thing was clear.

It took three months to find her, three months of hauling and gossiping with the other drivers and searching. It was so much more complicated than merely contacting her over radio, but in the end, Tiff found her in person parked on the side of the road and napping on the hood of her truck. Her daughter was alive.

But she was *far.*

Autumn screamed. Her mother could do nothing to help her. She’d only put herself in danger, made everything worse.

*I can drive with you,* Tiff offered. *Spend the years at your side.*

Autumn threw her handheld radio. It exploded against the pavement. The only thing she wanted Tiff to do was leave while she could; the easiest way to make a problem worse was to inflict your same problem on another person. Tiff respected her wishes. She left Route 333 for the final time.

*Tried*.

On the way out, she lane-locked.

For years, Tiff’s daughter refused to speak with her. Autumn had always been one to explode with emotion, but this new grudge was a different thing entirely. Cold, immovable, simmering.

Occasionally, they would speak though, when they were sure no other haulers would be listening. The anger was always there, even justified. *Before*, Autumn had merely ruined her own life. Now, she'd ruined two.

Eventually, Autumn went silent. Tiff settled down. She scavenged a life of sorts. She waited, because one day, perhaps in thirty years, perhaps in forty, she knew her aged daughter would pull up to her diner, smile a wrinkled smile, and order a meal. Tiff would make it for her.

Tiff hadn't wanted her daughter those many years ago, but now that she had her, she shuddered to imagine the cold, empty existence she might have inhabited instead. Their stories had melded and become one, like mother like daughter, separated for a time, but always destined to join back up.

One day.

Eventually.

And then. She’d met a boy, a kind one with hurt behind his eyes. He'd reminded her of Autumn. She’d trusted him.

The boy had ruined everything.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For a long time after Tiff finished her story, Randall and I said nothing.

What did you say to that? A life’s story of love and hope, thrown raw at your feet, ending in a tragedy that was *your* fault. Tiff had only ever cared about one thing, and I’d taken her as far from that one thing as she could get. Not just that but I’d made sure that person lost their one true chance at escaping.

“Where are you going?” Randall asked me.

“Your office.”

“You’re just leaving? After all that?”

“I’m grabbing a set of keys to a truck with a windshield. This isn’t finished.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In case you all haven't noticed, I tend to recklessly hurtle into things headfirst without a great plan. In case you *also* haven't noticed, that course of action doesn't always lead to the most, shall we say, *error free* of results.

You'll be pleased to hear that for the first time in my employment on Route 333, I allowed myself one tiny detour. I popped over to my apartment and grabbed a thing or two. Only *then* did I recklessly hurtle back into things without a great plan.

When I passed through the redwoods, the forest-dwellers clawed at the back of my skull. I pushed them aside. They would never bother me again.

I drove through the blackness, through mist and rain. When I finally reached my destination, the morning sun was gleaming blindingly above the horizon.

Autumn wasn’t difficult to find. She was at her favorite diner, working her way through a plate of sausages and eggs. I’d never considered it before―how much time she spent here. How quickly she’d gravitated to this place in the short span since she’d taken up residence in this town, almost like she'd grown up hanging out in diners just like this one.

She watched as I approached. “So,” she said.

“So.”

“You’re back.”

“Seems so.”

She sighed and gestured at the empty bench across from her. “If we must.”

“Actually, I was hoping, well, maybe we could go on a walk? There’s something I wanted to talk about.”

She shrugged.

“I’ll get us coffee.”

I went to the back and made it in two portable styrofoam cups. The workers eyed me suspiciously. None of them grew fangs or horns though, so we'll take what wins we can. 

The first thing Autumn did when we started walking was spew the caffeinated liquid onto the sidewalk. “I swear this stuff gets worse the longer I'm here. What I wouldn’t give for a decent cup of Joe. It’s all so―” She made a face but chugged down another gulp “―disgusting.”

I snorted and took my own sip. For a bit we were silent.

“Look, Brendon,” Autumn started. “About earlier―”

“You don’t have to apologize. It was my fault.”

“But it wasn’t. I explode. That’s what I do, but that doesn't mean any of this was up to you. Really. You didn’t even have a reason for helping me, but you were trying anyway. The thing with the hitchhiker, well, you couldn’t have known. And it was both of our plans, not just yours.”

We crossed a bridge. I nodded.

“So did you get them out?” she asked.

“Chris and Al, yeah. Tiff wanted to stay, so I left her for now.”

Beside me, she tensed.

“Randall knows the truth too now. He’s good at keeping secrets. If anybody else lane-locks, he can get them out. I’m not needed anymore.”

“Of course, they need you.”

“I’m not saying that in a self-pitying way. The truth is it’s, well, *relieving*. If this was all up to me, nobody would keep helping people after I quit. It’s bigger than us now―that’s the thing I wanted to talk to you about, actually. I’ve decided something.” I took a breath. “I’m going with you.”

Her face opened in blatant surprise. We both paused at the crest of the bridge. Glowing shapes lurked in the water below, pulsing to the beat of the heartbeat in my neck.

“What do you mean?” Autumn prompted.

“I’m going to drive home with you for as many years as it takes. We’ll go in my rig. You don’t have to be alone.”

“Why would you do that?”

I swallowed. “Can we sit down?” I led us to a bench, faced her, reached for her hand, then withdrew. “Autumn―I’m in love with you.”

“Brendon…”

“No. Just listen. I know we barely know each other, but for years, I’ve struggled to connect with anybody, literally *anybody*. Even with my ex. With you, I don’t know. It’s different.” Sweat slid down my back. “You’re the first person I can actually talk with. I know this is out of nowhere, and maybe you don’t feel the same, but I think you might.”

For the flash of a shooting star, I saw it. Her eyes. They flickered with hope. After years of solitude and silence, of fear in the night and constant traveling, always traveling, always alone―she might not have to be. She could have a companion. She could have a *life.*

The light in her eyes dimmed.

“Brendon, I don’t…”

“Come with me. *Please*.”

“You don’t know me. You really don’t. Even if you did, even if you really loved me, I would never make somebody like you stuck with someone like me. That isn’t fair.”

“I *want* to.”

She raised her chin. “But *I* don’t want you to.”

“*Autumn*.” I reached for her hand, but this time she was the one to pull it back.

“Please,” I said. “Come with me. I love you.”

“You don’t.” She looked away. “I won’t.”

“But―”

“No!” She jerked back from me. The familiar anger bubbled up, preparing to erupt. “You can’t make me. I’m staying. I―I―” Her eyes unfocused. Her chin dipped. “I don't want…”

Her head drooped, but she shook herself back alert. “What’s going on? I can barely…”

I waited as her head continued to bob. Three times she jerked herself awake. On the fourth, her eyes slid closed, and her body slumped towards me. I eased her down onto the bench.

“Autumn? You there?”

No response.

I slid my arms under her legs and back, carried her back across the bridge, and settled her on the freight truck sleeper.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

With Tiff I’d been confident things would work out: trick her into my trailer, lock her, and drive happily into the sunset. With Autumn, I’d been less sure. 

Would my ruse be enough to make her count as cargo? Did it matter *why* she was unwilling to go with me? How long would the effects last? 

I couldn’t risk merely locking her in the back like the others. She would have realized what I was doing, and accepted it during our drive. Instead, I needed one intense moment of unwillingness and to put her asleep for the rest of it; as long as she wasn’t aware what was going on, she couldn’t change her opinion.

That’s what I was banking on, at least.

I had to go quick. I’d slipped her a double dose of my sleep meds (no, I won’t tell you which. Somebody stupid will try this themselves), but I couldn’t be sure how long they would last. The drive would be at least ten hours, and that was assuming this whole unhinged plan even worked.

It did.

Within half an hour I was passing familiar scenery. The relief I’d expected to feel with Tiff arrived at last. It had worked. Autumn would get to leave. They all would. I hadn't ruined anything at all. I could still fix everything.

The relief was short-lived.

Getting Tiff out had already been impossible. We were so much further now. The chances of survival were infinitely smaller. Who knew what would claw themselves after us?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Apparently nothing.

It was eerie. For hours I waited for the chair to tip, the bucket to spill, the boot to fall…

It never did.

There was no highway patrol. No meat storm. No retaliation whatsoever. I simply drove. When I needed diesel, I filled up. 

I drove some more.

We passed deserted malls and familiar ghost towns. After hours, we passed Tiff’s diner―just a diner now, I suppose. Not even the Faceless Man waved from the parking lot. The entire highway was simply… *empty.* 

Had it given up? It knew it couldn’t stop me from trying unless it killed me and, unwilling to do so, it had simply resigned itself to lose. The thought was a comforting one, a reassurance to my racing mind.

Even if it wasn’t true. 

It couldn’t be. Route 333 wasn’t alive, not exactly. It couldn’t change its personality the way humans could. Something else was going on.

Eventually, I learned what.

Less than an hour from dispatch, I pulled my rig to a stop in the middle of the forest section. Towering trees shivered above me. Sagging clouds rolled across the sun, and the chirp of crickets rose from every direction conceivable as if they were sitting in the trees, watching me. 

I had fuel. We were so close now. The smart thing would be to keep driving, except for the teeny tiny detail that I couldn’t.

There was no road to drive on.

In front of us, the highway I’d learned to recognize from my last few months, disappeared. It cut off in a sheer line, replaced by an unfolding of impenetrable trees.

Route 333 didn't need to kill us to keep us here.

It could [simply end](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).
