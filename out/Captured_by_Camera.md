I’m a photographer—freelance, obsessed with capturing the raw edges of life. Abandoned buildings, forgotten alleys, the places time chews up and spits out. I inherited my grandfather’s old camera after he vanished decades ago, a war photographer lost on assignment. It’s a relic, heavy with history, and I’ve been using it for my latest series. But something’s wrong. Every photo I take has a figure in it—something that wasn’t there when I clicked the shutter. It’s not human. It’s a mass of writhing tentacles and glowing, unblinking eyes, too many to count, staring straight at me. I thought it was a flaw in the lens, dust or scratches. But it’s in every frame, shifting closer, its gaze piercing. Last night, I smelled decay in my darkroom, sour and thick, and heard a wet rasp—like breathing—behind me. I turned, but nothing was there. Yet when I looked at the drying prints, it was nearer, its tentacles brushing the edges of the paper.

It’s impossible to describe fully—it’s a shadow that bends wrong, a nightmare stitched together from things that shouldn’t exist. Tentacles twist like they’re tasting the air, and those eyes, some lidless, some weeping black fluid, follow me across every photo. I showed the prints to my roommate, begged him to see it. He squinted, shrugged, said it’s just my imagination. But I’ve watched it move. In one shot, its eyes were at the horizon; in the next, they were inches from the foreground, glaring. Two nights ago, I woke to scratches on my windowpane, jagged lines spelling something I can’t read. I hadn’t touched that camera in days, but this morning, I found a new roll of film inside it, exposed. I developed it—every frame was me, sleeping, with that thing crouched over my bed, its tentacles stroking my face. The air stinks of rot now, and I hear its whispers, guttural and endless.

I dug into my grandfather’s past, desperate for answers. He disappeared in a jungle village, camera found abandoned by a riverbank. His journals, hidden in my attic, were a mess of paranoia—pages about “the watcher” he’d trapped in his lens, a curse from some ritual he’d photographed. He sketched it: tentacles, eyes, just like I see. His final words were smeared: “It’s in me now.” My stomach dropped. I locked the camera in a drawer, but the whispers grew louder, seeping through the wood. Yesterday, I caught it in my peripheral vision—a hulking shape in the hallway, gone when I turned. My skin’s marked now—thin, black veins creeping up my arms, pulsing when it’s near. I tried to sleep, but my dreams are its domain: it looms over me, peeling back my skull with cold, slimy tendrils, whispering my name in a voice that’s mine but not mine. I woke choking on that decay stench, my pillow soaked in black ooze.

Sleep’s a memory now. The whispers are constant, a chorus of garbled tongues clawing at my mind. My friends stopped calling—I screamed at them to believe me, but they saw nothing in the photos, just my “breakdown.” Last night, I found my hands trembling, covered in scratches I don’t remember making, oozing that same black filth. I set up the camera to watch me sleep, praying for proof. The footage was worse than I feared: it didn’t just stand over me—it slid inside me, tentacles burrowing into my mouth, my eyes, my chest. I felt nothing then, but now there’s a weight in my lungs, a cold squirming I can’t shake. Objects move when I’m not looking—keys vanish, chairs topple—and every mirror shows it behind me, its eyes multiplying across my reflection. My tongue tastes like metal, and I keep spitting up black threads that writhe before dissolving.

I tried to end it. Smashed the camera with a hammer, but the pieces reassembled overnight, lens gleaming like an eye. A priest laughed me off; a psychic vomited when I walked in, sobbing about “something older than death.” My exhibition’s tomorrow—my career’s pinnacle—and every photo’s infested with it, tentacles curling around my subjects, unseen by anyone else. I burned the prints; they reappeared, wet and stinking, on my desk. My arms are a map of black veins now, and my thoughts aren’t all mine—its voice slithers through, promising to show me eternity if I keep shooting. I hear it pacing my apartment, claws scraping the floor, and smell its rot through the walls. I called my mom, begged her to take the camera away. She arrived, saw nothing, left crying. An hour ago, I found her scarf here, shredded, soaked in that black ooze. Did I do that? I don’t know anymore.
