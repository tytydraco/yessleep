Evelyn spent the next week perfecting her mask. She smiled when the staff passed by, nodded along during group therapy, and maintained the detached calm they expected. But inside, her mind churned, replaying the scene she’d witnessed in that operating room—the bone saw, the scalpel, and the mutilated smile.  

She couldn’t run—not yet. If she tried to escape too soon, they’d restrain her again, pump her full of drugs, and drag her down that corridor. No, she needed a plan.  


The opportunity came during a staff meeting she overheard in the common room.  

“We’ll be short on personnel Thursday night,” one nurse said to another. “Two of the orderlies are out sick.”  

That was her window.  


When Thursday arrived, Evelyn spent the day playing the perfect patient. She thanked the nurses for her meals, laughed at the group leader’s lame jokes, and even volunteered to help clean the common room. Her performance earned her approving nods from the staff, and by evening, they barely glanced at her as she retreated to her room.  

When the facility grew quiet, Evelyn slipped out again. Her heart pounded as she retraced her steps to the *Authorized Personnel Only* door. This time, she carried a stolen scalpel tucked into the waistband of her loose hospital pants.  

The corridor was just as cold and foreboding as before. She pushed through the heavy steel door at the end, careful to keep it from creaking. The operating room was empty now, its equipment cleaned and organized. But the stench of antiseptic and blood still lingered.  

Evelyn searched the room, her hands trembling. She rifled through drawers, cabinets, and files. Finally, she found a metal filing box labeled *Procedures.* Inside were patient records, each marked with a red or green stamp. The red ones had notes like *Lobotomy Successful: Permanent Smile Achieved* or *Non-Compliant: Terminated.*  

She flipped through until she found her own file. It was marked with a green stamp and a note: *Responding to treatment. Potential candidate for Procedure 6-B.*  

Her stomach turned. They were waiting for her to “relapse.”  

Evelyn stuffed the files into a laundry bag hanging near the door. Evidence. Proof. If she could get this out, she could expose everything. But before she could turn to leave, a sound froze her in place.  

Footsteps.  

They were coming down the hall.  


Evelyn darted to the back of the room, sliding into the shadows behind a medical supply cabinet. The door swung open, and Dr. Carlson entered, accompanied by two nurses and a restrained patient. The man was wide-eyed and shaking, his screams muffled by a leather gag.  

“Let’s begin,” Carlson said, his tone casual.  

Evelyn watched in horror as the nurses strapped the man to the table. He thrashed and sobbed, but the restraints held firm. Carlson picked up a scalpel, his movements precise and methodical.  

“You’ve been very uncooperative,” Carlson murmured to the patient. “But don’t worry. When I’m done, you’ll never frown again.”  

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the scalpel she’d brought with her. She couldn’t stay hidden anymore—not while this was happening. Summoning every ounce of courage, she stepped out from behind the cabinet.  

“Stop!” she shouted, her voice trembling but loud enough to cut through the chaos.  

The room went still. Carlson turned to her, his expression calm, but his eyes gleamed with malice. “Evelyn,” he said smoothly. “You shouldn’t be here. Go back to your room.”  

She held the scalpel in front of her, her hand shaking. “I know what you’re doing. I’ve seen it. This isn’t treatment—it’s torture.”  

Carlson sighed, setting the scalpel down. “You’re confused again. It’s part of your illness. We’ve talked about this.” He nodded to the nurses. “Take her back to her room.”  

The two nurses stepped toward her, but Evelyn lunged, slashing wildly with the scalpel. One of them cried out, clutching their arm, and stumbled back. The other hesitated, clearly unprepared for resistance.  

Evelyn darted toward the operating table, grabbing a metal tray and throwing it across the room. Instruments clattered to the floor, and Carlson shouted, “Restrain her!”  

But Evelyn didn’t stop. She slashed at the patient’s straps, freeing his arms and legs. “Run!” she screamed.  

The man hesitated for only a moment before bolting toward the door. The uninjured nurse tried to grab him, but he shoved her aside with surprising strength and disappeared down the corridor.  

Evelyn turned to follow, but she wasn’t fast enough. A heavy blow struck the back of her head, and she crumpled to the floor, the room spinning as darkness closed in.  


When Evelyn awoke, she was back in restraints. Dr. Carlson stood over her, his face unreadable.  

“You’ve been very disappointing, Evelyn,” he said softly. “I thought we were making progress. But now, I see that you’re too far gone.”  

She tried to speak, but her mouth was dry, her voice barely a croak.  

Carlson smiled—a cold, detached smile. “Don’t worry. We’ll fix you. By the time we’re done, you’ll never have to fight again.”  

He leaned closer, his voice a whisper in her ear. “Let us show you how to smile again.”  

Evelyn’s screams echoed down the corridor as the orderlies wheeled her toward the operating room.  


But somewhere in the asylum, the man she’d freed was running. And in his hands, he clutched the stolen files. Proof of the horrors within the walls. Proof of what they had done.  

And maybe—just maybe—a chance for justice.
