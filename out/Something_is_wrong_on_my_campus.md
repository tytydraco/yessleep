I'm a senior at a decent college in the eastern U.S.(not specifying for privacy reasons) since the beginning of February I've noticed that something is definitely going on at my campus. Seemed normal at first, an ambulance or a fire truck here or there throughout the days and nights, I assumed it was just people drinking too much or doing something stupid like nuking a poptart in a microwave or the like. But it's definitely picking up now, I swear there's been 5 or so ambulances on my street throughout the day for the past week or so but that's not it. It's been very windy here, more than I'm used to really but there's something different about it, I've heard wind howling before, your normal whooshing sounds and such but it seems a lot sharper/higher pitched lately, sometimes it sounds like a girl screaming from far away. I didn't think much of it because I basically drown myself in horror media, and I assume it's just my brain doing some weird association thing trying to look for something to obsess or worry about so I turn on a fan in my room to try to drown out the noise while I sleep and don't think much more of it. The past 10 days or so though I've noticed the fan isn't enough anymore the wind is a lot louder, especially at night. I've been sleeping with earplugs and that seems to have been doing the trick for the most part but I dont think it's in my head anymore.

 I stay up pretty late because my classes start at about noon so I normally spend that time in my room on my xbox playing through some games and so. It's about 3:20 or so in the morning on the 22nd and I hear this clicking sound. Nothing too concerning but it's pretty annoying, after searching my room for a bit I realize it's coming from outside. I open my window the most I can to hear better and notice there's a guy sitting in a ball near a streetlamp on the road. I can't really make out any details but it seems he's wearing a heavy coat and such. I'm about to try to yell down at him but then the thing uncurls. A moment later I'm looking at this big gangly thing that's almost as tall as the streetlamp. Long legs, long arms, looks skinny as hell and it's head is just a ball, no features on it at all. I'm at my window staring at this thing and it just WAVES at me. I shut my window and yank the blinds down and try to compose myself for the next few minutes, thinking I must be sleep deprived as all hell. I wait for what feels like hours until I feel brave enough to look around the blinds again, and its still there. I consider calling the police and telling them something thats sounds believeable like a man threatening me from outside my dorm. I grab my phone and as I bring up the keypad app, it just starts walking down the street. Its taking these massive steps and I'm watching it until i cant see it anymore. I didn't sleep that night. I didn't realize until a few hours later but that was the first night where there was no wind, no ambulances, nothing, in a very long time. 

I'm staying with a friend for a few days now, he's been asking if we can test out rooming for a few days to see if we wanna rent an apartment after graduation and I do not want to be alone right now. If anything else happens I'll update this post or make a part 2 but as it stands now I want to be out of here as soon as possible.
