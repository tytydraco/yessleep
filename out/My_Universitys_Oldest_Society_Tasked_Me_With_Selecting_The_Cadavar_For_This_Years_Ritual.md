Do you think morality is binary? Or do you think that maybe sometimes, good people do bad things in the name of something better?



Throwaway account for reasons that will become clear. 



There is nowhere else where it would be appropriate for me to seek out and connect with those who may have any advice for me and if I don't document this somewhere, I will not have tried hard enough to warn those who come after me of the fate that could befall them.



I’lll begin by explaining the series of events that led to my little ‘problem’.



I am in my final year of earning a Doctorate of Medicine at one of the USA’s leading universities; I’m sure you know the one, you’ve seen the name plastered across hoodies and sweatshirts worldwide. 



As well as being lucky enough to attend this incredible university, I have somehow been lucky enough to be accepted into some of the most highly regarded societies and clubs which have helped me open every door I’ve desired access to.  



The majority of the clubs I am a part of have regular meetings and public events which require attendance and participation in order to retain your spot; the one I am referring to, the one that birthed my ‘problem’ is entirely different. 



This isn’t a club that you will find advertised anywhere, not by the University itself, not even by its members. This is a word-of-mouth, highly exclusive club that meets only once annually and keeps itself very much to itself. Its new members are sought out by a recruiter.



The story begins last night, let’s call the society in question the ‘Secret Society’ so that I’m not giving away anything identifying. I need you to understand that this society has been running longer than you or I have been alive, it was founded in the 1600s during the University’s infancy and it will remain for as long as the University stands tall. 



Upon my entry into the Society in my first year, amongst a plethora of other juvenile and symbolic tasks and missions, I was given my role, ‘Selector.’ It was explained to me by the board of alumni present for my inauguration meeting that the role was only for a one-time instance where I would be faced with making the choice of which of the cadavers we were to extract from the morgue for its participation in the ritual.



I know how it sounds, but you don’t understand. I had managed to convince myself that I had been given the ‘best’ role, the least unethical role.



In order to understand any of the decisions that I have made, you must understand that our intentions are nothing but good. If someone had the capacity to bring back a deceased loved one of mine, I would certainly deem that to be ‘good’.



Given the promise and excellence that oozes out of the university, the Secret Society’s pledge to finally allow man to conquer death is one that I can truly get behind with the true belief that if any human can bring life back after the moment of death, it is the humans within this society.



When I had my initial discussion after the recruiter gauged my interest and set up the meeting, my mentor – we’ll call him Pete – explained to me that in my final year, I will be required to attend and participate in a historic ritual. 



Pete was a brilliant mentor, he helped facilitate my attendance to the three Society meetings that occurred annually through my first to third years in University. These three meetings were undoubtedly the three most enlightening evenings of my life. 



If my life weren’t in jeopardy, I would find so much joy in sharing some of the unfathomable discoveries and studies enacted by the Secret Society. Medicine would never be the same. 



The first two meetings were split between a focus on some of the society’s fundamental beliefs and the undeniable evidence that founded these beliefs and an introduction to some of the more unorthodox methods that past members have found success with in partial or full reanimation of a cadaver. 



The third meeting was 12 hours entirely dedicated to the thorough explanation of every role and its purpose, the order in which everyone was to perform their roles and a full demonstration of our version of the ritual was to entail. This meeting culminated with myself and the five other students that formed my team standing before the three elder alumni who had previously hosted the evenings as they reconfirmed all of our roles, ‘the selector’, ‘the conductor”, ‘the vessel’, ‘the scribe’ and ‘the usher’. 



After our roles had been confirmed, one by one we recited the oath that we had learned at our first meeting, 



“By life, a secret kept. By hand, we conquer death. By oath, a shepherd I shall be at any time the Society calls for me”



At this time, the three alumni retrieved five huge, beautiful leatherbound books. Two of them took the weight of the books as the third distributed them to their respective new owner. 



Or rather, their current owner. It had previously been explained to us during one of our meetings that we would all come to borrow a manual that had been compiled by every other person who had stood before you in your specific role. This book was not ours to keep, we were merely lucky enough to have access to all of this otherwise unattainable information that pertained to our role. 



This meant that we all had just short of a year to absorb every word written in our manuals, I had just under twelve months to learn everything that any of the Selectors before me felt important enough to document and I really did dedicate every moment of free time to this cause to ensure my duty was performed as well as it possibly could be. 



I did everything right. 



My responsibility as the Selector can be summarised as this; I was tasked with considering all of the factors, every warning, each anecdote recorded through the centuries and making a decision as to which cadaver from the morgue — if any,  would make the best candidate for our procedure. There were multiple entries from Selectors throughout various periods in history where the only scientifically and medically viable option was to postpone the ritual until a viable participant could be secured. 



The first entry in the manual was dated 1803 when Giovanni Aldini performed his first public demonstration on a corpse, sparking life back into the subject if only for a moment. Each of the manuals begin with this entry, we were told, as Aldini originally performed all five roles by himself.



Obviously, every part of the Lumen Protocol has evolved since it's inception. Arguably, it has so far evolved far past where it ever should have. I don't make this point to criticise the Protocol, I make this point to highlight the work that the Society has done and the lightyears closer we have gotten to allowing man to overcome death.



This meant that I had access to over two hundred years of data and experience to consider upon making my selection.



What I had not considered, what I had not been warned against, what had not even been noted on a single line on a single page was the possibility for someone else from the University to have also been conducting their own unrecorded, experimental medical intervention.



One that would render my choice of cadaver catastrophic. 



As to not confuse the issue, before we arrive at the destination, please allow me to illustrate the journey. 
The historically based ritualistic procedure that we had choreographed for this year’s experimentation was a slightly altered version of an archaic practice that we will refer to as the ‘Lumen Protocol’ for the sake of secrecy. 



Our version of the Lumen Protocol looked like this – I know how it sounds, please don’t forget the Society’s true motivations.



I, as the Selector, would begin the procedure by choosing a cadaver from the University’s morgue. There was no abundance of choice, there were nine cadavers in the morgue on the night in question, two of which were minors – immediately disqualified. Four of them had lifelong health conditions that were listed countless times throughout the manual as contraindications and there was one double amputee – all disqualified.



That left two choices, both seemingly equally as viable as the other based upon every single variable that I had the knowledge and capacity to deduce. 



As I continued to assess the risk of using one of the seemingly viable cadavers over the other, I noticed that one of the patients had moderate bruising of the abdomen and chest — the specific areas in which we would be placing electrodes. These bruises were likely sustained during attempted CPR which could indicate weakening of the chest wall, the other cadaver had a slight perceptible advantage in that this bruising was not present. 



This acted as the deciding factor for me at this moment as there were no other detectable medical advantages of picking one over the other. 



Once I had made my final decision — one I was entirely confident in, I thanked the cadaver for his worldly choice to donate his body to research, I cleaned and bathed him in the exact way that was depicted throughout the manual. I did every step, no matter how insignificant certain phrases felt to speak during certain actions, no matter how silly I felt kneeling before the table on which he lay to pay respects to him and every cadaver that had come before him in this Protocol. I did everything right. 



After I had finished preparing and paying respects to the cadaver, I transported him to the disused anatomy lab that we were to be using for his procedure. 



The word ‘ritual’ is one that I find to be personally tough to resonate with as the word evokes a certain performative feel that can border on silly. Silly generally has no place in medicine which I think is why I found this next portion to be the most difficult. To me, the ritualistic chanting that came next was much more unpleasant and unnatural than making the clinical, evidence based choice of which cadaver would be of most appropriate use. 



The role of the Selector can be very briefly broken down into three distinct stages.



Stage one was the only stage to be completed alone and consisted of cadaver selection and respect offerings, the events I have just described. 



Stage two would involve just myself and the appointed Scribe recording the cadaver’s measurements, reviewing any documented medical history and then the ceremonial removal of the ID bracelet that bound the body to it’s worldly death. 



Thirdly, after the ritual had commenced, it was clear throughout the manual that it was my duty to assist ‘reset’ the body to its prior state with another thorough cleaning. This third duty is the one I never had the chance to even attempt. Based on the manual, I believe that I am the only Selector in history to have not fulfilled this duty.



At this point, I haven't slept since this happened and I can still smell the lingering musk that lives only upon the dead. I’ve showered twice but it’s becoming too much to bear again. I’ve been trying to document this for three hours now and I'm only just now getting to the place where the ‘problem’ lies — the ritual. 



I’ll finish explaining everything when I've slept. I can’t bring myself to relive it quite just yet. 



If I can sleep at all.
