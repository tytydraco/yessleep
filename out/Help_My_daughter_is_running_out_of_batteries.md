It’s been two months since I discovered the battery compartment in my daughter’s back.

Ava is eight years old, and it’s just been her and me since her mom died in a car accident two years ago. She’s the only little bit of my wife I have left.

I love her so much.

Which is why I’m frantically searching for a solution to this… unusual problem.

There was absolutely nothing unusual about Ava. She’s always been that happy, healthy, bubbly blonde little girl. She gets good grades, eats her meals fine, and always has unremarkable checkups at the doctor’s office.

But one day after school, she came home complaining about an itchy spot on her back.

I took a look, and there it was—on the small of her back.

A raised, reddish rash.

I didn’t think much of it. I grabbed some hydrocortisone cream and rubbed it on, and we both went about our day. She ran into the living room to watch TV while I cleaned up in the kitchen and started dinner.

A few minutes later she came back.

“Daddy, it still itches.”

“Well, it’s gonna itch,” I said. “Give the medicine some time.”

She ran off again, but through dinner she kept reaching behind her, scratching, her face twisted in discomfort.

“Alright, honey,” I said. “After dinner, I’ll take another look.”

She scarfed down her food and rushed over, laying her stomach across my lap so I could see her back.

I looked closely at the rash—and noticed something strange. Off to one side, there was a small flap of skin that seemed to have come loose. The rash was red, and there were scratch marks across her back… but it didn’t look like she could have reached that one spot herself.

I leaned closer, gently pinched the loose piece of skin between my fingers.

There was no blood.

It wasn’t a wound.

Slowly, I pulled back the flap.

I waited for Ava to cry out, or even flinch—but she didn’t.

Millimeter by millimeter, I peeled back the skin. Still no blood. At first it looked like more healthy skin underneath…

But as I kept pulling, what I revealed was no longer skin.

I recoiled. The tan flesh gave way to black.

“What’s wrong, Daddy?” Ava asked, her head still hanging over my lap.

“Nothing, honey. Just give me another minute. I think I can help.”

She shrugged and started tracing her finger along the grains of the wooden floor.

My stomach tightened.

I returned to my inspection.

And the more I revealed, the more it became clear this wasn’t organic.

Perfectly straight lines. Tiny screw heads.

I froze.

Beneath the flap was a small, three-inch compartment—housing what looked like a battery. Not the kind you’d buy at the store, but one built in. Encased in black plastic.

On its surface was a single red light. Above it, four more—unlit.

I just stared.

By this point, Ava was getting restless. So I gently pressed the flap of skin back into place. And to my shock, it sealed shut within seconds, as if nothing had ever been disturbed.

Ava hopped off my lap and turned toward me. I hadn’t realized I was still staring blankly at the wall, trying to process what I’d seen.

“So, Daddy?” she said, pulling me back. “Can you do anything about the rash?”

“I’ll try a different lotion,” I muttered.

I grabbed the pink Calamine lotion from the bathroom and dabbed it over her back.

The rash already looked better. The flap of skin was barely noticeable.

Lotion applied, I did my best to return to our normal routine. I read her a book, gave her a snack, and tucked her into bed.

Later that night, as I sat alone in the dark, I tried to convince myself I was losing my mind

Maybe it was exhaustion.

Maybe I imagined it.

At this point, the idea of a stroke was more comforting than whatever I had found inside my daughter.

That evening, with all the lights in the house off, I snuck into Ava’s room. I brought a chair and sat at the edge of her bed, watching her sleep.

Her chest rose and fell with each soft breath. Moonlight streamed through a crack in the curtain, stretching a pale line across her little face. Every so often, she smiled.

As the night went on, I replayed everything I’d seen, over and over.

It had to be something else—some weird optical illusion, a rash blister, a trick of the light.

There was no way I’d found a *battery compartment* in my daughter’s back.

The next morning, Ava woke up cheerful as ever. After she’d finished her eggs, I asked as casually as I could, “Mind if I check your back again?”

She giggled and flopped over, lifting her shirt like before.

To my immense relief, the rash was nearly gone. No flap. No seam. No sign of anything unnatural. Just smooth, healthy skin.

I rubbed my thumb over the spot, pressing lightly—nothing. I picked her up and kissed her cheek, overwhelmed with relief.

Everything was fine.

Everything was *normal* again.

But later that day, one thought kept gnawing at me. *Maybe it had something to do with the hydrocortisone cream.*

I didn’t want to believe it, but the idea wouldn’t go away.

That evening, when Ava got home, I checked the spot again and applied a fresh dab of the same cream.

She sat beside me on the couch watching cartoons.

I kept glancing at her back. At first, nothing changed.

Then my stomach dropped.

The skin lifted.

The flap was back.

I didn’t say a word. I didn’t touch it. I just stood up and walked away as the sound of cartoons echoed behind me.

Upstairs, I sat on the edge of my bed with my head in my hands.

What was happening to her?

What had I seen?

I wasn’t crazy—this was *real.*

But Ava had been a normal little girl. I’d known her since the day she was born. A *normal*, *organic* baby girl.

That’s when I remembered something I hadn’t thought about in years.

On the day Ava was born, my wife—Shelly—refused to let me in the delivery room. She insisted she was too embarrassed.

At the time, I didn’t push it. I figured, fine, she doesn’t want me to see her like that.

But now, looking back… I realized something.

I never actually *saw* Ava being born.

And there were other things. Little things that never made sense until now.

Once every month or two, Shelly would insist on sleeping in Ava’s room. I thought it was a sweet, motherly thing to do.

But one night I went to check on them and found the door locked. A faint blue glow emanated from under the door.

I figured she was just on her phone.

I didn’t think twice.

But now… now I can’t stop wondering.

What was she doing in there?

Was she *maintaining* something?

I know how insane that sounds. I kept telling myself it was crazy. But it was the only explanation that made any sense at all.

I kept treating Ava as normal. She was still my little girl. My whole world. She went to school, laughed with her friends, came home for dinner.

But every so often, I'd come up with some excuse to check her back.

The battery was still there. The single red light still glowing.

And then around a month later—it started blinking.

It was running out.

Soon after, Ava came home from school one day and yawned.

“Daddy, I’m tired.”

“Well, go take a nap, sweetheart,” I said.

She slept the whole afternoon. Then the night. The next day, she could barely stay awake. She ate a little, watched some TV, and fell back asleep.

I kept her home from school. But by the third day, she was only awake for an hour or two at a time.

Her skin was pale. Her voice weak.

I checked her back again.

The red light was blinking faster.

I don’t know what happens when the battery dies. And I’m terrified to find out.

I’ve thought about trying to remove it, that way I can charge it somehow.

But what if that kills her?

I don’t know what to do.

I'm convinced Shelly had something to do with all this. And if she was maintaining Ava, there must be supplies hidden in this house somewhere.

My only hope right now is to find them… before the light [goes out](https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/).
