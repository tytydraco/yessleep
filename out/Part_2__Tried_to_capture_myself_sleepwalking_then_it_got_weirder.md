Sorry for the late update, everyone. Today has been absolutely nuts… I don't even know where to start to catch you all up, but things have definitely escalated... 

My wife has left me.

Last night, again, I felt the familiar sensation of my earthly body moving on its own as my conscious mind drifted to a land of dreams. But it was when I woke up that today's nightmare started. 

A shrill and ear piercing scream is what jolted me awake.

I got such a fright that I flung myself out of bed and onto the floor in a sprawl. My heart was beating out my chest, and as the disorientation of waking up in a bright room faded away, my wife's face came into clearer focus.

I have never seen a look on another human being’s face like the expression I now saw my wife looking at me with. For a second, I thought maybe someone had broken in. That she had spotted something behind me. But no, her eyes were locked on me. 

I just stared back confused. Although it was me who woke up the way I did, my wife seemed many orders of magnitude more terrified than me. Her eyes were wide and frantic, as if she was staring into hell itself. Her hands were trembling. Her mouth was stuck in a terror filled downward smile, her bottom lip shaking as if she was trying to get words out, but all I could hear was a high-pitched whimper no louder than a whisper.

Straight away, I tried to move to comfort her, but as I even just lifted my arm to pull myself up, she flinched so violently that she fell off the other side of the bed. I shot up to see if she was okay and asked her, “What's wrong, my love?”... But before the sentence could leave my mouth, she was already scrambling for the bedroom door.

I tried to catch up to her, calling out to her as she fled, but she flew down the stairs quicker than I've ever seen her move before and straight out of the front door in her nightgown. As I reached the front door of our house, the car door was slamming shut. Tires screeching, she pulled away, leaving me standing there terrified, confused, feeling sick…

I stood there frozen for minutes until I finally shut the door on the staring neighbours.

It was at that moment I saw the ring doorbell next to me. Set up the previous night, facing up the stairs. I can remember my heart dropping in realisation, and I took off running for the bedroom to check if she had left her phone.

Slamming the door open, I darted into the room. Sure enough, the phone was lying on the floor where she'd landed off the bed. I quickly plugged in our anniversary date as the pin, and as it unlocked, it opened up right to the Ring App. Notably, the time was now almost 4pm, we had slept through the entire night and day!

There were two motion triggered recordings there from this morning… but none from through the night. Anything my wife had watched must have disappeared like the previous files…

Sitting on the end of the bed, I clicked onto the first video. The recording starts as my wife comes into frame at the top of the stairs, you can see her sprinting down them in uncontrollable panic… It was hard for me to see her with that much terror on her face again and just before I started to break down in tears I saw myself exit the bedroom on the screen…

Taking each step extremely slowly, my body steadily stalked down the stairs towards the camera. I could clearly remember running and shouting after my wife to stop and reassure her everything was okay… but this video told an entirely different story with each thudded footstep to the next stair. My movement seemed unnatural. Deliberate, jerking movements. Head too level as if it wasn't attached right to the jolting movements of the body.

I watched horrified as it took me nearly a minute to reach the bottom step. I walk straight past the camera, and then you hear the front door creak slowly shut and click into place. I do not come back into the frame, and the video ends soon after.

The video ends, and I exit out of it. As expected, the file again disappeared. No sign of it, even deleting, no pop-up or anything, just as if it was never even there.

The second video. 

I initially tried to download this one a few times before watching it. Each time I attempted to save the file, it would become corrupted and wouldn't open. I was afraid to hit play on it because I just knew it too would disappear once it was finished… After a couple of hours of googling and trying to figure out different ways to view the file, I gave up and I finally settled on trying to video the phone screen with my phone while watching the video. I hit record on my phone and then hit play on my wife’s…

At first, it showed nothing. The recording triggered from motion but… showed just a quiet hallway. I was expecting to see myself running back up the stairs. I definitely would have triggered the motion sensor by doing so, and the time matched perfectly… but I never come into frame. The silence in the video was chilling, oppressive… the type of silence you get in a soundproof room. 

Roughly thirty seconds into the clip, the bedroom door explodes open at the top of the stairs as if crashed into by an unseen force… 

I looked over at the door and sure enough it was in the same position as the video, having bounced back off the door stopper… this was me opening the door… but why wasn't I shown on the video?

The video ends, and the file, as usual, disappears. The file on my phone of the screen recording, corrupted. I toss my phone in frustration.

Then I just sat in the same spot for probably hours, staring into space, trying to make sense of this… Trying to come up with some type of explanation. Is the camera glitching? Is there some type of electrical interference causing the camera and phones to behave weirdly? Am I hallucinating? Is there a gas leak? Am I still dreaming?…

I tried several times to get in contact with my wife, I called all of her friends and my in-laws, but nobody was answering my calls. I must have tried a hundred times before my mother in law sent a text, “stop calling.”

I cried for a while. Then I cried for a while longer. And then I started to type this update for you all even though I didn't really feel like it. I'm glad I did now, it had felt good to confide in you all and get this off my chest…

But one thing, as I've typed, has bothered me deeply. Like an itch, I can't scratch. While I was trying to remember the first video, I realised I couldn't remember how my face looked in the video at all!

No, not just that, I couldn't remember if I even had one!! It feels like a word on the tip of your tongue. Just out of reach…

Help!
