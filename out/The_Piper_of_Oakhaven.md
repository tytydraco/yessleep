**Part I: The Harvest**



**October 28th.**



The fog arrived not merely as a weather event; it came as a wet, dense promise of something ancient and unseen.



Elara Crowley, at twenty-nine, hated Oakhaven. She had returned here after her mother’s death only to sell the house—a wooden box stuck between a graveyard and an endless cornfield. But for three weeks, she herself had been stuck, buried beneath probate papers and a creeping sense of November dread.



In this town, lost deep in the heart of New England, Halloween was not a carnival of plastic masks and candy. Here, it was called "The Harvest Night," and the preparations were made with a frightening, almost religious solemnity.



Elara stood by the kitchen window, sipping her cold coffee. It was five in the evening, but the fog and the low, leaden clouds had plunged the outside into a thick, charcoal darkness. The branches of the old oaks, draped with dried corn husks like strange garlands, scraped against the glass.



It was at that moment she saw the movement.



Not the wind, not a shadow, but something walking along the path where the hedge used to be. It was a silhouette, too tall and too thin to be a man, hunched as if carrying an unbearable weight on its back. It didn't step; it slid across the wet gravel.



The figure stopped right beside the maple tree Elara remembered from her childhood. On the maple's branches, instead of typical Jack-o'-lanterns, hung dozens of old, blackened wooden dolls. They were simple, faceless effigies, with stick arms and bodies made of dense sacking.



The silhouette raised a hand. A sound drifted out of the fog.



It was a flute. Or, rather, a pipe—an instrument that sounded too sharp and piercing for the otherwise tranquil landscape. The melody was as old as the soil of Oakhaven itself—slow, lulling, and sickeningly joyful, like a lullaby for the dead.



When the figure lowered its hand, one doll was gone from the maple tree.



The fog thickened, swallowing the outline. The pipe fell silent. Elara felt the coffee scald her palm, yet she couldn't tear her gaze from the spot where the Silhouette had stood.



“It’s just an old man. Neighbors getting ready for their ridiculous Harvest,” she whispered aloud, her voice trembling.



But old men didn’t slide. And the dolls hanging on the maple were not just decorations. They resembled something. Something small.



Elara quickly dressed: heavy boots, her mother's old cloak. Grabbing a flashlight, she stepped out into the gloom.



The cold, decaying smell of the fog hit her face. The gravel crunched under her feet. By the maple tree, she noticed the ground was worn down. There were nine dolls, not ten, as she’d first thought. They hung on a thick rope wrapped around the branch, swaying slightly as if listening.



She shone the flashlight on them. Every doll was identical: a dense sack stuffed with straw, tied with twine. But on the chest of each, beneath the sacking, Elara discerned tiny, barely noticeable marks embroidered with red thread.



Symbols. Not letters. Stylized drawings: a star, a circle, a bird.



She hurried back inside. The cold had permeated her bones. Turning on the old computer, she found the local Oakhaven archives.



Under the heading "Oakhaven Folklore and Traditions," she found a mention:



“Annually, on the eve of the Harvest Night, before the Great Bonfire, the village elders gather the ‘Ten Effigies’ (The Ten Effigies). These dolls symbolize…”



The rest of the page was torn away.



In place of the torn text, Elara found an old, scanned newspaper clipping from 1957. It was yellow and brittle, with a title in archaic script:



"Oakhaven and the Mystery of the Missing Birds"



The article recounted a strange series of disappearances in October 1957. Ten domestic birds—chickens, ducks, even a parrot—vanished in the week leading up to Halloween. Local police were reportedly "baffled" and leaned toward a stray coyote theory.



But the final paragraph held a strange comment, attributed to an old local farmer.



“It’s not a coyote. It’s the Piper. Every year, the Piper takes what is owed to keep us safe, and none of the townspeople should speak of it. He calls, and they leave. Birds. Or children. It makes no difference.”



Elara gasped. She leaned back in her chair. The Piper. The one she had seen by the maple tree. He had made a calling sound. And he had taken one of the ten dolls.



“The dolls symbolize…” What did they symbolize?



She grabbed her phone. The only person she had spoken to since arriving was Dean Hennessy, the local sheriff.



“Dean, it’s Elara. Are you in town?”



“Elara, of course. We have a meeting about ‘Holiday Safety’ today. What’s wrong? You sound like you’ve seen a ghost.”



“I saw someone. Or something. Outside. It was standing by the maple tree. It was tall, strangely dressed, and it was playing some kind of pipe. And then it took one of the wooden dolls.”



A long silence followed, filled only with the static on the line.



“Elara, listen to me closely,” Dean said, his voice, usually low and ironic, now tight as a bowstring. “Those dolls are decorations. It’s a local tradition. Just stay away from other people's yards. Tomorrow is the Harvest Night. Don't interfere.”



“But there are ten of them, Dean. ‘Ten Effigies.’ And I found an old article about ten missing birds in '57. And about someone called the Piper.”



“Elara,” Dean’s voice grew harder. “You’re reading old folklore. This is Oakhaven. We have our rules. It's just a story. Go to bed.”



He hung up. Elara stared at the flickering screen with the 1957 clipping. The sheriff hadn't just dismissed her; he was scared.



She locked all the doors and windows. The night outside grew absolutely silent, swallowed by the fog. She had three days left until October 31st.



She decided she wouldn't sleep. She had to find out what those Ten Effigies symbolized.
