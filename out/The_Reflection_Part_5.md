I don’t want to look in the mirror anymore.

Not because I’m scared—at least, that’s what I keep telling myself. But deep down, I know the truth. I’m afraid that if I look, I won’t be able to pretend anymore.

Because no matter how much I want to deny it, I feel better. I sleep through the night. I wake up rested. I get to work on time without even trying. Despite everything it’s like my finances have been put on autopilot, always keeping me afloat.

And it’s not just luck.

I know why this is happening.

I couldn’t resist any longer—I gave in.

I stepped into the bathroom, turned on the light, and forced myself to look.

My reflection was waiting.

It didn’t copy me. It just stood there, head tilted, watching. Its expression was unreadable—not menacing, not smug. Just patient.

I took a slow breath. “What are you?”

It smiled, like I’d finally asked the right question.

“*A friend.*”

I rolled my eyes. “Yeah, that’s not ominous at all. Try again.”

The reflection tilted its head the other way, considering. Then:

“*I am what you see.*”

I frowned. “That’s not an answer.”

“*Isn’t it?*”

I hate how calm its voice is—my voice, but steadier. More certain. Like it knows something I don’t.

I crossed my arms. “Fine. What do you want?”

“*To help.*”

I narrowed my eyes. “And what do I have to do?”

It didn’t answer right away. Instead, it lifted a hand—my hand—and pressed its palm against the glass. There was no sound, no resistance. Just the quiet, expectant weight of its gaze.

“*You already let me in.*”

A slow, creeping dread curled around my ribs. "I didn’t agree to anything."

“*Didn’t you?*”

My stomach twisted. I don’t remember saying yes. I never agreed to whatever this is. But I also never stopped it.

And it’s helped me.

My life has gotten better. Not in some huge, dramatic way, but in all the ways that matter. The ways I’ve needed.

I stared at my reflection—at the thing that isn’t quite me—and I don’t know what scares me more.

The fact that I don’t trust it.

Or the fact that, deep down…

I want to.

I took a step closer to the mirror, lowering my voice. “Just tell me. What do you actually want?”

The mirror is silent at first. Not in a normal way, but in a way that makes the room feel heavier—like the whole world is waiting for me to acknowledge the answer that I already know.

Then, the words appear. Not spoken. Not written. Just… there.

“*Make things right.*”

My stomach twists. My first thought is that this is some trick, some vague, manipulative wording meant to make me ask more questions. But I don’t have to. I know exactly what it means.

I shake my head. “No.”

Not because I don’t want to. But because I can’t.

The mirror doesn’t respond right away. The weight of it just lingers, pressing down on me, making my throat feel tight. I laugh, but it comes out wrong—hollow and forced.

“You don’t get it,” I mutter. “It’s not that simple.”

It writes again, this time slower. More deliberate.

“*It is.*”

I step back. My reflection stays put.

“I—” My voice catches. My hands clench and unclench at my sides. I want to argue. I want to say that I tried. That I’ve spent hours drafting messages I’ll never send, that I’ve picked up the phone a thousand times and never dialed, that I’ve wanted to fix things but… just couldn’t.

Not out of spite. Not out of pride. But because the shame is suffocating. Because if I reach out and they don’t want to hear it—if they’ve moved on, or worse, if they don’t forgive me—then what am I left with?

It’s easier to pretend the bridge was never there than to confirm it’s already burned.

I don’t say any of that. I just stand there, breathing heavy, staring at a reflection that isn’t even pretending to be me anymore.

It tilts its head. Then it speaks—not through text, not through sound, but directly in my mind.

“*You don’t have to do it now.*”

I exhale. That… feels better. Less final. Less like I’m cornered.

“*Just promise me you will.*”

That’s doable. That’s… safe. A problem for tomorrow.

“…Fine.”

The mirror ripples once, like the surface of a pond disturbed by a single drop of water.

“*Good.*”

The mirror settles. My reflection moves in sync with me again, like nothing ever happened.

And that should be the end of it.

But I can still feel it. That heaviness in the air, the weight in my chest—like something just shifted, like something just latched on.

I keep telling myself I’m fine. That I got out of this without actually doing anything. That I’ll make the call. Eventually.

But even as I type this, I swear the mirror is watching me. Like it knows.

Like it’s waiting.
