He knew he was putting me in a tight spot, one even a good flossing couldn’t reach.  
“I know it may seem like a lot–”

“Understatement of the century”

“Listen, you're the only person who can, well…”

“Pretend I don’t know what I’m doing–”

“Exactly.” The blatant audacity of the practice owner nearly killed me. As a newly graduated dentist,I was at the bottom of the totem pole at this practice, despite knowing more advances than these men who trained over 20 years ago.

“Plus he won’t find you threatening because you, well you know.” I did know. Being a woman meant my colleagues already saw me as less competent, let alone less competition. “He won’t worry about you undercutting him–”

“Because he will never think I could do as good of a job as him, right?”

“You get it.” Did he have to say it so smugly?

“Do you see me that way?” I watched his face carefully.

“Let’s discuss this another time. I have Mrs. Carole waiting for her filling.” His non answer was answer enough. I sighed and left his office.

My task was fairly simple. In between patients, I would follow Dr. Henry around and document each procedure he did. According to Dr. Horner had received a few complaints from patients about the procedures they received. Given Dr. Henry’s years of expertise, confronting him head on may jeopardize revenue for the practice and taint his and Dr. Horner’s relationship. So I, the sacrificial lamb was to provide surveillance and potentially a scapegoat if this blew up in our faces.

I sighed exasperated. The several hundreds of thousands of dollars of my loans loomed over my head. I needed this position. It was the only practice within a reasonable driving distance of my child’s long term care facility. Sometimes, as a parent, your hands are tied.

The first day of observation was fairly routine, he had two root canals scheduled. They went without any hiccups. His hands moved with accurate muscle memory. I understood why Dr. Horner was afraid of insulting him. He was a very competent dentist. I went about finishing my own patients and left without concern.

Day two I was confused. He had three more root canals scheduled. Last time I checked Dr. Horner was not an endodontist. Maybe he was taking more medicare patients these days. I peeked into his room. The Birkin bag sitting on the spare chair made me choke on my own spit. Definitely not a medicare patient. I coughed violently. Dr. Henry suddenly stopped and his eyes met mine. “Can I help you?”

“Oh, yes. I’m the recent grad, Dr. Kinsey. Dr. Horner mentioned I could learn a lot from observing your technique. ” It had been a while since I had to fluff anyone’s ego and I wondered if my skills were still up to par.

Dr. Henry didn’t seem to notice or care. “Nice to meet you Dr. Kinsey” His voice was robotic and monotone. He resumed the procedure. I slipped away, kicking myself for being noticed so soon. I would have to be more careful in the future.

Days three and four brought more, you guessed it, root canals. By the end of the week, my colleague had done more root canals than most dentists would do in a month. I finally understood Dr. Horner’s concern. When the frequency of a procedure outpaces the incidence of disease, it is rare that the local population is just sicker than average. The more likely cause was far more damning: medical fraud. 

Not only was Dr. Henry the first person in the office to arrive each morning, he also stayed long after everyone left to “finish up”. It was two weeks into observing him that I decided to stay a little longer at the office. Little did I know at the time that I was going down a rabbit hole I would soon regret.

I casually slipped into the breakroom as I watched him slink down the hallway. His pace was fairly even as though he was counting his steps, methodically. He stopped right in front of the wet utility, where all the biohazard waste from the day went. I quickly followed behind, ducking in a patient care room. As I peaked from the door, I heard a distinctive rustling sound as he pulled a bag from the biohazard room.

My heart sank. I knew that sound. I had heard it before when working as a dental assistant before dental school. When I heard it, it was the rustle from half a dozen, the typical result of a month from a busy practice. The rustle I heard now seemed like a thousand, maybe two thousand, the result of consistent and diligent removal from every patient. Dr. Henry was harvesting teeth.

My gasp betrayed me. Moving faster than someone his age, Dr. Henry’s hand was around my wrist before my mind could comprehend that I made a sound.

“Who’s there?” He asked despite looking squarely at me.

As I stared deeply into his eyes, I realized why he was counting his footsteps. The front of his corneas were bright white and hazy. He had cataracts. He couldn’t see anything. Realizing I could likely maintain my anonymity and preserve my job, I lied.

“I am one of the college interns volunteering here. I was told to dispose of the teeth”, I hoped he didn’t recognize the sound of my voice.

“Oh? A volunteer? How nice of you. How often are you here?” The concern melted from his face as he spoke. He bought my lie.

“Just once a month” Thankfully I had the experience to weave this web of deceit.

“Oh that is very lucky. Do you have any genetic diseases in your family?”

“What?”

“Like inherited conditions, genetic diseases that incapacitate?” His grip grew tighter around my wrist.

My mind immediately thought of my son. Did he know who I was? Was this a threat?  
“No. I don’t think so.” I knew I had to protect my son at all costs.

Relief on his face again. “Good. Very good. Come here, I have something to show you.”

Trust is an interesting thing. It’s more than just a bond between people in relationships or friendships. There are certain institutions and titles we naturally trust. Firefighters, doctors, dentists, we trust these people to care for us; to do the right thing. Because, after all, someone already vetted them, right?

I think about how in this moment, had it been any other person, I would have fought or run away. But this was not only my colleague, but another dentist. Another person who had walked the same path as I, made the same choices I had. A person who, seemingly, dedicated their time to improving other people’s lives. I saw them almost as an extension of myself. So I followed blindly. A physically blind man leading a socially blind person. 

A decision that would haunt me for the rest of my life. 

He led me into the patient care room and before I could resist tightly pressed the nitrous oxide mask to my face. I could feel myself becoming drunk. What was I so worried about? I wondered as he helped me into the chair and strapped down my legs.

He left the mask on while he left the room to grab his tools. I stared at the canister of nitrous oxide musing. Typical careless man, he accidentally put it at 100%. Too high! Doesn’t he know it should be at least 70% or the patient could die? I quickly turned it down to below 50%, because I knew over 50% would be sedating.

As the gas concentration normalized I realized. He was trying to kill me. Before I could leave I heard his footsteps at the door. I held still and breathed very slowly. My only goal is to make it out of this alive. What does he want from me? Just a tooth. He can have a tooth.

He set up his equipment as though he were doing a root canal. Ah, this is how he was getting away with it. He would pretend he had a root canal, would say the tooth was unsalvageable and pull them instead. He didn’t bother to put on the show and dance with me, I was an unwilling participant. 

It took all my will power not to move when I realized he wasn’t going to numb the area. I guess he figured since I was going to die from the nitrous oxide overdose, he didn’t have to worry about pain control.

You’ve had a baby. You can do this. I told myself. A stupid lie I’ve learned from society. Having experienced pain prior doesn’t make pain less painful, it just means you can be silent about it. Typical role of women, to suffer in silence and have our needs go unmet. Unlike the men who can cry out in pain and get relief.

I blinked back tears as he washed off my tooth, his prize, in the sink. It was over. I would soon be free. I thought. How wrong I was.

I ended up having to retell myself the same lie, “you’ve had a baby, you can do this” thirty two more times. Once for each of my permanent adult teeth. I never thought I would be a toothless dentist.

After he finished, he replaced the mask on my face and left unceremoniously. He neither cleaned up his tray nor disposed of what he thought was my dead body. He merely added my thirty two his bag of thousands and left.

Once I heard his car pull from the parking lot I quickly shut off the gas, my gums bleeding. I threw some quick clot in my mouth and ran to the reception desk and dialed 911. After my recovery in the hospital, I learned that Dr. Henry had not only left town but vanished all together. Police are still searching for him and his bag of teeth, unceremoniously calling him the tooth fairy. I think he is something far more ominous. Maybe one of those GADHICs I hear people talking about on this site.

Dr. Horner paid for my sick leave and dentures in entirety. His demeanor towards me has completely changed. The guilt in his eyes shows up every time we interact. Sometimes he just stares at me sadly during work hours and offers to take me out for lunch or buy me something. Sometimes I accept, sometimes I don’t.

Since that day, my eyes are wide open. I no longer blindly trust those with titles or power. I fight against the muscle memory of trust for society. Not only has it made me a better dentist, but also a better mother.
