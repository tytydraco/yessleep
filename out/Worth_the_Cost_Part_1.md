I parked the truck, turned it off and stepped out. A cold breeze sent a chill through my body. I looked out to the dark, sandy hills. I knew why I was there. I started walking, the stars in the sky being my sole light to see. I could only make out a couple of things: dead trees, acacias, and some cacti. It didn’t matter that I could barely see, I had followed this path before. As I got deeper into the wilderness, mountains of sand surrounded me. I looked back and I couldn’t find my truck. 



  Sand seeped into my shoes as I walked. It was cold and uncomfortable. My eyes were frantically picking out shapes in the dark as my mind raced with thoughts. It wasn't the time to care about being uncomfortable. 

 

I advanced deeper and deeper into the sandy wilderness until I finally found what I was looking for. There, in the darkness, a silhouette of a tall, skeletally thin humanoid figure stood on top of one of the sand dunes. I hurried up the mountain to meet with the being. As I got close, the smell of burning black oil hit my nostrils. 



It was bony, I don't even think it had flesh. It was oozing a thick black liquid from its body. Well, I assumed it was black, I had only seen this thing at night and never when the moon was out. Maybe it liked to keep itself more hidden, or maybe it liked only dark starry night skies.



  As I looked up at its face, the being turned toward me. I couldn't make out its eyes, nose or mouth - maybe because it was so dark. It had to have them right? I mean, how else could it talk without a mouth. I could hear the sounds of crackling and burbling as it moved towards me. 



“It's you again,” the being gurgled with a muffled voice, “What is it that you want?”



I leaned in to where I assumed its ear was and whispered what I wanted. It violently reacted to what I said, its body cracked and wheezed. It sounded like it broke every bone in its body. The being paused. Then it raised its long bony arm and pointed at my left hand. 



“It's going to cost more than your previous requests.”



I looked down at the stubs of my middle, ring and pinky fingers.



 “How much more? I asked.

 

It raised its grotesquely long, oozing finger along my left arm. Its touch was hot, like it was burning me. I wanted to wince, remove my arm from the pain, but I needed to know how much. Its fingers stopped roughly halfway between my shoulder and my elbow.



 “That much.”



“Why so much?” I said in a whimper, as it coiled its finger back and moved its arm closer to its body. 



“Washing away sins always costs more,” it ended in a wheeze.



 My heart sank. Was it worth it? I closed my eyes to think but at that moment I could see the flames again. I opened my eyes, my mind filled with determination. 



“Take it.” 



“Are you certain?” 



“Yes, just get it over with!”



The being raised its thin arm as I saw its hand reaching for my bicep. I lifted the sleeve of my shirt as it grabbed me with its searing touch. 



“Last chance, is it worth it?” 



“Yes.”



I gritted my teeth and tightened my eyes, bracing for the eruption of immense pain - more than the burning of my flesh.



“Very well”.



I heard a loud crack. But not from the being, it came from me. The pain was excruciating, worse than losing any of my fingers. It got even more intense as the thing started to pull my arm while twisting it. I could feel my muscles, my tendons, my skin, all beginning to rip. My nerves screamed in pain begging me to stop this. But I wanted this. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t even think. Then with a horrific jolt, I felt light and that lightness flowed through my whole body.  I saw the being raising my arm up to its face. 



In a gurgled breath it said, “It is done. GO!”



I was in shock as I took a step back. Losing my footing, I fell, rolling down the mountain of sand, my nerves screaming all the way.  When I finally got to the bottom, I could feel a surge of adrenaline start to flow through me. I got up and bolted along the path I had taken to get here. 



I briefly looked back and it was still there. On top of the dune the unnaturally long, gross thing stood there, motionless. I ran faster than I ever have. I reached for where my arm once was but there was nothing. Just blood dripping from a distorted looking stub. I knew I had to be getting closer to my truck. 



 Then I heard it again, the cry of an infant. The haunting image flooded my mind. A  wrecked car flipped over and on fire. 



Hot tears spilled down my face as I began to make out my truck in the gloom. But then inky, dark circles consumed my sight. I felt like I was floating as my body fell against the soft, cold, sand.
