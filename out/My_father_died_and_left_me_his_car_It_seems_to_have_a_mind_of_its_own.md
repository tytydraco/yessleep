A lot of people ask me why I like cars. The answer is pretty simple – I like the idea of going fast. Not just in cars, mind you, but in everything. The concept of going fast is just something that appeals to me on a primal level. If I had been alive in caveman times, I probably would have been the guy that invented the wheel. Going fast is part of my identity, is what I’m trying to say. So, you can probably imagine how I felt when I heard that my father left me his 1999 Honda Civic Type R as part of his will. I’d gone for a lot of rides in that thing as a kid, and he’d always told me that the “R” in “Type R” stood for “Really fast”. As soon as I got my license I begged him to let me give it a spin, but he refused every single time I asked. He didn’t think I could handle the speed, is what he said. Hearing your own father say something like that to you, well, you can probably imagine how much that fucked with my head. I spent a lot of time tinkering with and testing my own car, pushing it faster and faster in brutal street races, certain that one day my father would consider me worthy of operating the Type R. As long as he lived, though, that day never came.

When I got the email saying that my father had died I had this feeling that, somehow, it was a car that had done him in. I was sort of right. They found the Type R at the bottom of a ravine, hole in windshield, his body stuck in a tree like thirty feet away. Blood test showed extreme levels of intoxication. The police concluded that he’d participated in a street race after a night of drinking and had failed to execute a drift through a tight turn, which had sent him flying off the road and into the ravine. My first thought was one of total disbelief. I had no idea that my father was a street racer. Had I raced him before without even knowing it? Or, maybe it was a one-off thing, like he’d just finished downing a few beers and then decided that a street race sounded like a fun idea. He was the kind of guy to just do something like that, so it was definitely a possibility. Still, I’d like to imagine my father as living a secret double life as a street racer. That’s probably how he’d want me to remember him, anyway.

Like I said before, he left the Type R to me in his will. Well, it was a mixed bag of emotions if we’re being honest. I finally had the car I’d been lusting after since I was a child, but I didn’t really feel like I’d earned it. I told myself that even if my father was gone, I’d still do whatever I could to win his (posthumous) approval. If he didn’t think I could handle the speed, I would prove him wrong using the only way I knew how – street racing. As it was, though, the car wasn’t in any condition for street racing. It was pretty busted up from falling into a ravine and it still had a hole in the windshield, so as soon as I had the chance I took it into the shop for repairs. The moment the Type R entered the garage, it began to emit a strange hissing noise, like steam was pouring out of every single crack and cranny, only there was no steam or smoke or anything like that as far as I could tell. The head mechanic, a nice Latin American fellow, inspected every inch of the car but couldn’t find the source of the sound, either. What he did find was all sorts of strange-looking gizmos hooked up to the car’s vitals. The engine, for example, had several orbs attached to it that seemed to contain a reddish-white mist. I assumed that my father had added these things to improve the car’s performance, so I told the mechanic to avoid disturbing them and to only make the necessary repairs. As soon as I drove out of the garage, the hissing stopped.

Taking a car you aren’t familiar with into a street race is a great way to seriously injure yourself or die. I figured that I’d start by operating the Type R as part of my daily routine before moving on to more advanced stuff like drifting. I was driving through my neighborhood – cruising, even – and was stopped at a crosswalk so that a little old Latin American lady could cross. As she passed in front of the car, the engine suddenly revved and the car began to creep forward. I pushed down on the brake with both feet and that seemed to stall things, but then that awful hissing noise started up again and I was afraid that the car was about to explode or something. As soon as the lady was clear of the car I released the brake and it shot forward and for a moment I thought I understood what my father had meant when he’d talked about handling the car’s speed. I thought I understood, like a fool.

A few days later, I thought it would be a good idea to take my girlfriend for a ride in the Type R. We’d only been dating for a few months and I hadn’t told my parents about her. My father, well, as much as I looked up to him it’s hard to deny that he wasn’t a perfect man. My girlfriend is Mestizo, but even a half-white would never have been good enough for him. I don’t think he would have disowned me or anything if he’d found out, but he definitely wouldn’t have been happy. If you’ve seen Gran Torino, he was kind of like the Clint Eastwood character in that, except without the redemption arc or the goofy shirt. I don’t know what happened to him to make him that way. Maybe it’s better off not knowing. 

Anyway, yeah, we were going to go for a nice Sunday ride through the countryside, only as soon as my girlfriend sat down in her seat the car alarm went off. I switched it off but a few seconds later it started up again. And again. And again. After the fourth time it seemed like it was finally off for good. The moment I started the car up, clouds of thick, black smoke began to burst from the AC and fill the interior. That was enough to freak my girlfriend out and she started fidgeting with the door, but it must have been locked because she wasn’t able to get it open. I tried turning the ignition off, but the key refused to turn. In a panic, then, I switched to the driver side door and fumbled with the lock but the damn thing wouldn’t move. My girlfriend was screaming at that point and I was kind of out of ideas, so I grabbed the crowbar from the back seat and slammed it through the window, then jumped through the hole that was left behind. I called out to my girlfriend and she followed after me, and then all at once the car shut off. The whole ordeal had kind of killed the mood and my girlfriend refused to get back in the Type R, so she just went home instead. I told myself that one of the modifications my father had made had probably fucked up or something, but the next day when I tried turning the car on everything worked perfectly fine.

From there, I began to notice a strange pattern of what I suppose you might call “malfunctions” with the Type R. I live in a very diverse neighborhood, which means I encounter minorities on a daily basis. Whenever I passed one of these minorities on the street, I could feel the car begin to swerve towards them and I had to use all of my strength to keep control of the steering wheel. Sometimes the car would suddenly accelerate as if it were trying to hit them, and at other times the horn would suddenly honk and scare them away. I began to fear for my safety, because I knew that if I ever actually ended up running somebody over I’d get sent to jail for a long time. To be honest, I felt utterly defeated. The Type R was clearly too much for me to handle, so I decided that I would just leave it in the garage and switch back to the car I’d been using before my father died. It was a fast car, for sure, and I could operate it well, but it was no Type R.

The first time I saw the Type R outside of its garage was just under a week later. I was over at my girlfriend’s apartment to do the sorts of things that boyfriends and girlfriends usually do. Things were getting hot and heated, but just as I turned the lamp off so I could go in for the kill the room exploded with a bright, unnatural light and a horrible, blaring noise smothered my ears. I looked out the window and saw two headlights shining through. My girlfriend yelped and hid under the blanket but I, like the man I am, was filled with an indescribable combination of rage and sadness. Who the hell would do something like that? I grabbed the fire extinguisher off the wall and ran outside, fully intending to hose down whatever kind of asshole was sitting inside that car, but as soon as I was through the door I realized that the car in question was the Type R and that, in fact, nobody was sitting inside it. 

I wanted to run away, then, but images of John Smith as he appears in Pocahontas flashed through my mind and a strong urge to protect my girlfriend suddenly filled my cavity. I charged the car, brandishing the fire extinguisher, which I threw right through the passenger side window as soon as I was in range. I’d just paid to have that window replaced so I did feel like kind of an idiot for throwing a fire extinguisher through it, but, well, you know. Once I was through the window, sure enough I spotted the keys in the ignition. This time they came out without much effort, and everything returned to silent, still darkness. I wasn’t sure how my girlfriend would react if I told her the truth, so I just made up this story about how there was a guy in the car who I’d threatened to kill if he didn’t fuck off, and that was enough to make him go away. Well, that really got her going. How the rest of the night went, well, I’ll leave that up to your imagination.

Things started to get real bad after that. Anywhere I went, it seemed like the Type R would follow. I’d go to the grocery store and see it already parked a few rows away, or at work it would be in the lot across the street. Whenever I returned home, though, it would always be right where I’d thought I’d left it. I tried breaking into it once, while it was out there – I mean, not in the garage, but at work. It was my lunch break and I’d finished eating my mac and cheese. I was in an unstable mood that day and had decided that enough was enough. As I approached the car, though, I noticed a few people standing around giving me the ol’ stink eye. Well, that was enough to stop me.

Whenever my girlfriend came around, or whenever I went over to her place, things would turn out just like before with the headlights and the honking. Eventually I had no choice but to tell her the truth, that my father’s car was somehow following us around, but that only freaked her out more. I suppose she thought I was playing some sort of trick on her but I wasn’t. I was more than fed up with that damn car, too. She told me that she thought it would be better for her mental health if we stopped seeing each other for a while. I could tell that was the white half speaking. It was a shame, too, because I actually liked her. Well, I really liked her. I really, really liked her. I felt like total shit after that, to be honest. It wasn’t like I’d done anything wrong, it was all because of that fucking car.

I got really drunk a few nights after the break-up (a coworker had given me a case of Four Loko one of his cousins had smuggled across the border) and decided that enough was enough. I grabbed the crowbar off the kitchen table and made my way into the garage, then started whacking at the Type R over and over and over while screaming like a wild animal. I blasted out the windows, first, then started smashing in the doors. I imagined myself as Ryu in Street Fighter 2 doing the little bonus stage thing, which really helped with my efficiency. The instant I made contact with the hood of the car, though, an ear-piercing moan filled the garage and something that was a deep, dark red splashed everywhere. It wasn’t oil, and it wasn’t blood, rather, it seemed to be both at once. I took a few steps back in shock, but was intoxicated enough at that point to be fully dedicated to totaling the car. With each whack there was another scream and more of the blood-oil came pouring out, and before long I was totally drenched in the stuff. My curiosity finally got the better of me and I lifted the hood, but could barely make anything out because the whole inside area had filled with blood-oil. There were moans coming from somewhere in there, though, so I started whacking indiscriminately. Suddenly, I realized that the crowbar wasn’t hitting metal anymore, it was hitting something much softer than that.

Then, something grabbed my wrist. I could just barely make it out – a hand was sticking right out of what looked like the engine of the Type R. In my shock I dropped the crowbar, and I tried to pull away but couldn’t. Another hand shot out of the blood-oil and grabbed my other wrist, and then I could feel a tremendous force trying to drag me down into the Type R. Slowly, a head appeared from beneath the blood-oil. I was afraid to make eye contact with the thing so I looked away, but in my periphery I could see that, whatever it was, it had pulled itself completely out of the engine and was now perched on top of it in kind of a Spiderman pose. My wrists were now free, I realized, and I took the opportunity to run and hide in the corner of the garage. The thing in the engine seemed to take no notice of me, instead stepping out of the car and stretching its long, oily limbs for a few moments. Then, with a bang it punched a hole in the garage door before nonchalantly strolling into the darkness.

When I was sure that it was gone, I ran over to check the damage. There was, indeed, a large hole in the garage door and there was blood-oil splattered everywhere, which I knew was going to be a pain in the ass to clean up. The Type R was damaged way past the point of repair, but as I write this it’s still just sitting there in the garage. I don’t know, I think I just need to get the thing scrapped. I’m not really sure what I saw that night, but since then the Type R’s stopped following me around. I tried calling my girlfriend up to give her the news but she told me that she’d already found another guy, so that didn’t help me feel any better. Oh well, guys like me are born for street racing, not loving. Yeah…

I thought I’d at least try to scavenge a few parts off the remains of the Type R, but after I cleared away all the blood-oil I was disappointed to find that I’d completely trashed all the important parts of the car. The engine in particular had been broken into several large chunks, like pieces of a puzzle dropped on the floor. I’m not sure where the thing I saw in there is now. Not sure if I want to know where it is, anyway. I know I said I avoided it, but we did make eye contact a single time. There was something familiar in those eyes, something… me. It’s not good to think about those kinds of things, though. Now that I’m single, I can really focus on street racing. Pulling off a successful drift, yeah, that’s probably the best feeling in the world. Just close your eyes and drift, drift away…
