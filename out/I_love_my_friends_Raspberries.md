i love red raspberries, in my spare time with friends i’m not one to oppose making smoothies at my place, the simplicity of the swirling liquids and the cool savory taste is always a favorite of mine. My friend is a gardener so i can get them hand picked, pretty lucky i know. And i love it don’t get me wrong at all, but something has been seeming so off with her berries lately, i think her gardening skills are getting worse.

Last week i went to pick up berries, i grabbed my purse and a small wood basket to carry the berries in on the way home, one of those baskets that make a weird sound when you squish it like a creaky floor, the inside has red stains from the berries, but it smells like bliss. I showed up at my friends door basket in hand, the weather was a perfect sunny day, it was a 50/50 she’d be home. I knocked on her door regardless.
“Oh hey Claire, how can i help you” her smile always had given me a warm feeling.
“Do you happen to have raspberries? i know it’s not the best weather this past week but i’m having my cravings.”
“Oh, of course give me a minute” she closed the door with a smile, i went and played on my phone thinking nothing of the beating sun.
a loud bang echoed from inside, she usually makes jam so again, no difference.
“Here you go love!”
“Thank you god, you’re a saint Ellie i promise, how much for these?”
“Ellie come here babes” a drunk man inside called to her, another hook up.
“eh these can be on the house, they aren’t the best but i know you’ll devour them regardless, see you next week” 
she was quick to close the door but i didn’t mind, she was a busy lady and had to dissect her gardens before the storm came.

I unboxed my berries from the basket, i always hated the little pricks on them at the store, Ellie must have known because i never see any on hers. I watched the berries crunch and slosh around in my blender, creating a lovely red paste as i added more of my fruits to the smoothie. The rest of the day was boring, i won’t leave you all the details but to sum it up, i drank my smoothie, did work and watched tv, mostly a mix of multitasking the last part but hey, your not my boss so you don’t need to worry about that part. Regardless i decided it was about time i head to bed, i shuffled my way around my apartment, finding the bathroom a bit dirty but not bad. I ripped off some floss, i did a lazy job but it’s probably still better than you fucks reading this. As i flossed i felt a weird piece of food between my teeth, like a piece of string, so as anyone would i fished around for it, pulling a weird thin purple and blue ish worm looking thing in my teeth. I won’t lie, i jumped, but i kept inspecting it, the shade changes, it wasn’t a worm. A vein? but come on i’m not jeffery dahmer. I finished brushing my teeth, glancing at the vein on my counter. Once i finished I walked to the kitchen, inspecting any food that may have entered my mouth, goldfish, apples, juice boxes, the raspberries. nothing. until i peaked into the raspberry hole. i plucked the fattest one in the basket, inspecting the deep hole, i plucked around to see if anything was inside. A thin black hair. “god i’m to tired for this shit” I decided on asking Ellie about it tomorrow, when the world is awake.

I woke up quickly, throwing on a hoodie and a skirt and shifted out the door quickly, it was a busy day, easter, i watched women walk briskly down the street, it was like i mentally was racing them. I turned the corner and walked to Ellie’s door quickly.
“Oh hey Claire how can i help you today love bug”
“there was a hair and a vein-looking thing in my raspberries” i stepped inside, closing the door. 
“oh i’m so sorry, i have the raspberries set up on the kitchen table if you wanna help me prepare better, it’s a hard single women job and everyone wants fruit salad for easter!”
I walked to the kitchen, the drunk man from yesterday i assume laid on the counter, knocked out.
“I’ll do the Raspberries can you help with just cleaning and shaping?”
“of course Elle”, i pushed passed his feet that draped over the counter. I watched as she pulled out his penis, she used her nail file like Picasso as she cut off the edges of his tip.
“shit this one’s a bit on” she grumbled as she dug her long nails under the skin, i could hear the skin tears away from itself, fighting back as she pulled harder, deciding to use the nail file, it was like a sad surgeon on his last limbs. After plucking it off she tossed it to me, i carved my way into it and turned it inside out, washing the insides under cool water, what a perfect raspberry. She was so graceful, she loved the men that were shitty because they always tasted the best. The men that called her hot hoe on the streets, how she would take them home and as they slept next to her how she would plot everything so beautifully.

she proceeded to cut piece by piece of the penis away as i continued shaping and cleaning, they looked scrumptious, i will admit i snuck a few, they were so sweet and fresh, i felt the juices rolling of my chin, i felt how my teeth broke through the skin, it was delicious. I watched her slice the skin as she dug her long nails under the sad chunks, i watched as she pulled out the bones and let me like them like a wooden spoon, it was delicious. i helped her the rest of the day, we had wine and laughed the night away, i looked at the sink, the inside has red stains from the berries, it was beautiful. 
“Thanks for the help Claire seriously needed you!” 
“Of course Elle, i better get going it looks dark out”
“Alright be safe! bye love”

Like i said, im not jeffery dahmer, but it’s so hard to say no to such sweet luxuries, the berries change my world, my veiws. I’m not dahmer. i don’t do the killing. but you can’t be mad until you try these mouth watering berries.
