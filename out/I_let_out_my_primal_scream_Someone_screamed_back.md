My parents *despised* each other, and that hatred manifested into the resentment of my existence. If they weren’t laying into each other, they were laying into me. I would take out my frustrations on others who made me feel vulnerable. I didn’t tolerate *anyone* being aggressive or disrespectful towards me. The toughest bullies at school learned that despite their physical advantages, I wasn’t going to take it.

In my early 20s, my dad died from liver failure. Not even a year later my mum died from a brain haemorrhage. Their suffering gave me no pleasure, but I was happy they were no longer with us. Physically, at least, because their shadows remained. I harboured deep anger from their treatment towards me. It was more under control than in adolescence, but I felt it creeping in at times, ready to explode. Such a thing happened not too long ago at work.

My boss Glen, a pompous, arrogant toad, narrowly avoided a broken nose more times than I could possibly say. He didn't know that, of course. I don’t have a problem with authority; I have a problem with disrespect. He exhibited a *lot* of disrespectful behaviours on a weekly basis. I would usually keep it contained; take a few deep breaths, nod, smile, and retreat to the break room to calm down.

I put a file on Glen’s desk. A file that I'd worked on the night before, in my own time, until the early hours. I was tired.

“Dom,” he called from his private office doorway, holding the file. He had a particular smirk reserved for when he was about to criticise you. It was plastered on his face.

“Sir?” I said, getting up from my desk. He held up a hand to stay put.

“What’s this?” he asked.

“That’s the Bradley file, sir. I worked on it as requested.”

He scoffed. “Did you, Dom? Because I’m seeing a few discrepancies here.”

I could feel my chest getting tight. I own my mistakes, but this was not an appropriate conversation for the office floor. Several colleagues had stopped what they were doing to observe.

“Can we discuss this in your office, please?” I asked.

“No need,” he said, casually walking over. “I want everyone to hear this, so pay attention.”

As he publicly ridiculed me, my eyes were drawn to his neck. Glen’s shirt collars always looked too tight, skin bulging over the edges. His cologne became intoxicating. Expensive no doubt, but the excess cheapened it. I found it hard to breathe, and my brow began to sweat.

I stopped hearing the shit spilling from his lips and grabbed his paisley tie, slamming his head down on my desk. I ripped pages out of the file.

*“Shut the fuck up!”* I yelled, forcing screwed up pages into his mouth…

I was taken out of my daydream by the sound of the file landing on my desk. He stood over me.

“I’ve highlighted the errors for your convenience,” he smiled, tapping my shoulder. “Looks like you’re working late again, Dom.”

My heart rate increased as he went back to his office, closing the door behind him. I was fixed on the prick through the glass, watching as he sat behind his desk. My hands began to shake. *”Go to the break room,”* came the voice of reason. *”Don’t do anything stupid.”* Regardless, I picked up the stapler from my desk, knuckles white. Then I stood up, kicking my chair back.

I barely took a step before an arm tightly wrapped around my chest from behind. I raised my fist at whoever had the audacity to stop me, then saw it was my colleague Liam. One of the good ones.

“Deep breaths,” he said quietly. Then he prised the stapler from my fingers. “Come on, I’ll make you a cuppa.”

If Liam hadn’t intervened I would have been out of a job, and likely in court. Instead, we had a conversation in the break room as my temper subsided. I even told him about my parents, something I’d never told anyone.

“Don’t take this the wrong way,” he said. “Have you considered therapy?”

I nodded. “Considered, yes. But I don’t want anyone in my head.”

“I get it,” he said. “I’ve been there, Dom. But it could really benefit you.”

He told me about his own struggles with anger and how regular therapy helped him significantly.

“Think about it,” he said. “Because next time I might not be there to stop you.”

I agreed to think about it. Just talking about it with Liam felt like a weight had somewhat lifted.

“What are you doing Friday?” he asked.

I shrugged. “Nothing planned.”

“Great,” he smiled. “I want to show you something that could help you in the meantime.”

◈

Liam picked me up just before dusk on Friday, driving out of town into the countryside. He eventually pulled over into a passing bay down a narrow tree lined road.

“Come on,” he said, getting out of the car.

“Why do I feel like I'm not leaving here alive?” I asked. There was nothing out there but trees and fields.

He laughed as he hopped a fence. “It’s pretty creepy, right?”

It was. “Why are we here?”

“Just follow me.”

We walked through woodland as it became darker. It’s not that I didn’t trust Liam, but it felt weird not knowing why exactly we were there.

“Are we cruising?” I asked.

“What?”

“I’ve read about men that go to places like this. You know, to meet other men.”

“No!” he laughed. “Even if we were, I’ve never seen a single other person out here.”

“Okay,” I said. “You’re gonna have to tell me why soon because I’m getting uncomfortable.”

“Fine,” he said. “This will do.”

He stopped and looked around, standing a few feet away from me. Then he took a few deep breaths.

“Liam?”

Without warning he let out a deep, guttural scream. He threw his arms back and roared into the night. I heard the flapping of wings as birds fled the area. It startled me to the point of falling. When he stopped he looked down at me.

“What the fuck?” I yelled. He started to grin as he held out a hand to help me up.

“Try it,” he said.

“Absolutely not!”

“Come on,” he said. “Let it out.”

“No way!”

“Why?” he asked.

“Because it’s fucking weird!”

“Trust me, Dom.”

I shook my head and he stepped closer. “Do it.”

I could feel the familiar sensation of anger creeping in. “No.”

He pushed my chest. “Do it!”

My fists began to clench. “Liam, you’d better stop.”

“Or what?” he goaded, pushing my chest again.

My blood started to boil. “I’m warning you.”

“Come on then, Dom,” he smirked, pushing me harder. “What are you gonna do, huh?”

“If you don’t stop pushing me you’ll find out, mate.”

He laughed. It was like fingernails on a blackboard. “You’re not gonna do anything…”

I raised a fist and took a step closer, letting out a scream in his face. He recoiled as his expression changed to one of shock and almost fell back himself. I stopped, surprised at myself as I caught my breath.

“Again,” he said.

Without hesitation, I held up my arms and roared. I didn’t stop until my lungs were empty. It was exhilarating, my heart racing with adrenaline.

“Feel good?” he asked.

I nodded, breathless. “Yeah!”

“It’s called primal therapy,” he said. “Letting out the negative feelings that build up inside. My therapist encourages it. I used to do it at home, put my face in a pillow and scream as loud as I could. But I realised being out in the open is so much more effective.”

I could feel something different already. It was amazing!

“How often do you come here?” I asked.

“Every week,” he said. “You’re welcome to use the spot too. Just leave Friday for me.”

◈

The first time I went back alone, I was apprehensive about letting it out. I kept thinking about some poor dog walker getting the fright of their lives, or disturbing the local wildlife. But after closing my eyes and listening to the silence, I released my primal scream.

I started to go every Wednesday. It made such a difference. People I used to find insufferable, my boss included, became more tolerable. I stopped daydreaming about inflicting acts of violence on jerks who *probably* deserved it.

Then one Wednesday after a few months, something happened.

Someone screamed back.

I froze. It sounded like it had come from one of the neighbouring fields. I won’t lie; it sent a shiver down my spine. But I was still capable of rational thought. I assumed it was someone on a relaxing night walk, rudely interrupted and retaliating by giving it back. Maybe someone who had heard my previous screams and finally had enough. I quickly went back to my car and left.

The following Wednesday, I debated about going back. I even tried screaming into my pillow, like Liam had mentioned. But he was right; it wasn’t the same. Hearing your scream echo through the trees is so therapeutic. So I went back, albeit a little later than usual. It was dark to the point of needing to use my phone torch when the moonlight was blocked out completely.

I stopped, looked around, and let out everything that had built up over the last week. I listened out for a reply, but nothing came immediately. It wasn’t until I turned to leave that a scream came from somewhere behind me. Not just a scream; it was wild and raw. I could hear the anger within it.

I ran through the dark. I tripped over a couple of times, scurrying to my feet as I looked behind me. Being on the receiving end of a scream like that is *terrifying*. My car tires screeched down that country road as I bombed out of there.

When I got back to my flat and began to calm down, I reflected on how irrationally I’d behaved. It was scary as hell, but the reality was it was just another scream. One thought was it might have even been Liam playing a prank on me, but I didn’t think he’d make light of the issues we shared.

I went to bed deciding I wouldn’t be going back to that spot. Maybe it was time to find a new one, or take the next step and see an actual therapist. Before long, I fell asleep.

I woke up in the early hours to loud voices. At first I thought it was the neighbours. But it was much closer than that. It sounded like it was coming from my kitchen.

*”Drinking again?”* I heard a woman yell.

*”Of course I’m fucking drinking,”* said a man. *”You drive me to it, woman!”*

I curled up under my duvet as I realised who I was hearing; it was my parents. It had been *many* years since I’d dreamed of them. It seemed logical that I would again, now that I was taking steps to mentally heal their abuse. I closed my eyes as I willed myself to wake up.

There came the sound of something smashing, making me flinch.

*”You crazy bitch!”* dad yelled.

*”The next one won’t miss!”* mum yelled back.

As they continued to fight, I stepped out of bed.

“Wake up, Dom,” I whispered to myself. Against my better judgement, I opened the bedroom door.

My parents were standing in my kitchen, screaming at each other. Dad was overweight, hair thinning at the crown. A bottle of Jack Daniel’s was on the counter behind him. Mum was thin, bordering on gaunt. She held a dinner plate. Another plate was in pieces on the kitchen floor. I froze when dad snapped his head towards me.

”What are you crying for, you little pussy?” he yelled. I touched my face and could feel tears.

”Because he’s weak,” mum sneered. ”You’re just like your father!” Her left eye was completely bloodshot, the side of her face a map of dark spider veins.

”That could be anyone,” dad laughed. ”Your mother can’t keep her legs shut.” His skin was yellow, his eyes resembled spoiled milk.

”Fuck you!” mum screamed.

“Please, stop,” I cried.

”Fuck off!” dad yelled, picking up the bottle. It smashed against the wall to my side. I ran back into my room as my parents cackled, slamming the door shut. I jumped into bed and pulled the duvet over me.

Eventually I could no longer hear them, but their laughs were replaced by something else. Heavy breathing. It was *very* close. With trembling hands, I peeked from the duvet.

It was *me*. Another me was standing over my bed. But dishevelled, with harsh features. His eyes were *black*. The look on his face was pure fury, his chest heaving rapidly. He grabbed the front of my t-shirt and let out an ear-splitting primal scream, and I responded with a scream of terror.

When my alarm woke me up at my usual time of 06:30, I sat up hyperventilating. It had been the worst night I’d had since childhood. I contemplated calling in sick and staying home that day, but that felt like an unhealthy response that could spiral out of control. I also wanted to talk to Liam about my experience, so I dragged myself out of bed.

A sharp pain went through my foot as I stepped into the kitchen. There was a broken dinner plate, and a mangled Jack Daniel’s label among shards of glass. I don’t keep alcohol in the flat.

◈

Up to that point, I’d only truly been afraid of my parents. Now I was looking around like something was going to creep up on me. As I limped to my work desk, I prayed that my boss was going to take it easy that day, because I was *not* in the right place to deal with his shit.

On my break, I found Liam.

“Are you alright, Dom?” he asked. “You look a bit wobbly.”

“Please don’t think I’m crazy,” I said. “Have you ever heard anything when you’ve been in those woods?”

“Like what?”

“Like, another scream?”

He stared at me for a moment before looking a bit uncomfortable.

“What happened?” he asked.

I let out a long breath, not particularly happy about his reaction. “Last week I heard another scream. It unsettled me, but I went back regardless. I heard it again last night. It was…”

“Primal,” he interrupted. “*Really* primal, like a wild animal or something.”

My jaw dropped. “What the fuck?”

“I didn’t think it was real,” he said.

“Something *very* real followed me home last night.”

He sighed. “My therapist told me that when you scream with intent, you can unleash something. Like, a manifestation of your emotions. I had fucked up dreams, but it never literally happened. I thought it was a metaphor!”

I stepped closer to him. “Since witnessing what it can do to a person, I don’t touch alcohol. I have a cut on my foot from a whiskey bottle, Liam. A bottle that smashed on my kitchen floor after an argument between my parents. My *dead* parents. That’s some fucking metaphor!”

He shook his head. “I... I’m sorry.”

“What’s going on?” asked my boss Glen, entering the break room. “Step away from him, Dom.”

“I’m *really* not in the mood for your bullshit,” I said, turning to him.

“Excuse me?” he said.

“You have been *nothing* but a cunt since day one. Every single day has been a constant battle to not ram your smug face into the photocopier!”

“Dom, you’ve gotta calm down,” said Liam.

“Like hell I do,” I snapped. “I deserve a fucking medal for getting this far without a criminal record!”

“Clear your desk," said Glen. "You’re out of here!”

I began to tremble as anger overcame my body, blood rushing to my face. Glen retreated, as did my other colleagues. I walked towards him onto the main office floor. The lights flickered, computer monitors glitched, a buzz of electricity in the air. People looked afraid, but I didn’t give the strange occurrences a passing thought. I was solely focused on Glen.

“Stay back!” he yelled, arms outstretched.

“Dom,” I heard Liam say quietly from behind, his hand on my shoulder. It was like a trigger.

I let out my primal scream. Lights smashed as people went running through a shower of sparks, fleeing the building. Sheets of paper flew around the office as if they were caught in a vortex. I screamed until I couldn’t physically scream anymore, collapsing to my knees with exhaustion as the trashed office was mostly put into darkness.

Liam eventually came to my side, helping me up. I could feel his arm shaking around me.

“Are you alright?” he asked.

“I… I don’t know,” I said.

“You freak,” I heard Glen say as he stood up from behind a desk. “I always knew there was something wrong with you.”

“With me?” came a deep, multilayered voice. The silhouette of a man appeared behind Glen as his expression changed to one of shock. Before he could turn, hands gripped the sides of his head and quickly twisted with a gruesome *crack*. Liam and I grimaced as his body fell to the floor.

The man stepped into some natural light that spilled through a window. A part of me already knew who it was.

“Dom,” said Liam, confused. “It… It’s *you.*”

My doppelganger’s expression remained a permanent scowl as he approached us. We backed up until we were against a wall. He stopped barely inches away from me, close enough to see the deep creases of his weathered features. His cold hands held my face, his black eyes pierced my soul.

“Goodbye,” he said.

I closed my eyes tightly, waiting for the inevitable. But when nothing came, I slowly opened them to see a dark cloud dispersing before us. I took a breath like it was my first, overwhelmed with a different kind of emotion.

Since that day, I’ve never felt the need to scream [again.](https://www.reddit.com/user/disco-dingus/comments/10f0v6u/all_my_stories_compiled_into_one_sooperdooper_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
