I can’t tell you the name of the bank. Legally, I’m not allowed to. But if you’ve ever worked in finance, you’ve probably brushed shoulders with it. It’s the kind of place that recruits fresh grads with promises of “leadership pipelines” and “fast-track programs.” That’s how they got me—hungry, ambitious, and too naïve to see the teeth behind the smile.  

At first, it looked like any other corporate internship. Long hours, endless spreadsheets, coffee runs that weren’t in the job description. But my manager—let’s call him Mr. H—had a way of slipping in tasks that didn’t make sense.  

“Stay late tonight,” he’d say, “and help me with the vault.”  

I thought he meant paperwork. Instead, he handed me a flashlight and a keycard and told me to go down into the sub-basement. The air was damp, metallic. The walls hummed like they were alive. My job was to count the safety deposit boxes, one by one, and whisper the numbers into the dark.  

I laughed at first, thinking it was some hazing ritual. But when I hesitated, Mr. H’s smile dropped. “Do it,” he said. His voice wasn’t loud, but it carried a weight that pressed against my chest.  

That was the first night I heard the scratching.  

It came from inside the walls, like nails dragging across steel. I told myself it was rats, but the sound followed me, box to box, until I was whispering numbers so fast my throat burned. When I came back upstairs, pale and shaking, Mr. H just nodded. “Good. They like you.”  

I should’ve quit then.  

But the thing about corporate life is that it conditions you to obey. You tell yourself it’s just temporary, just part of paying your dues. And besides, my friends in the program were going through the same thing. Or so I thought.  

One by one, they started to change.  

Carla stopped sleeping. She’d show up with bloodshot eyes, muttering about “balancing the books” even when she wasn’t near a computer. Nate started scratching at his arms until they bled, whispering about “debts that can’t be repaid.” And Kristen—God, Kristen—she smiled too wide, her teeth grinding as if she was chewing something invisible.  

I asked her once what was happening. She leaned close and whispered, “The bank doesn’t just take money. It takes pieces of us. Interest, compounding daily.”  

I thought she was joking. Until she didn’t come back the next day.  

Mr. H said she’d been “transferred.” But when I went down to the sub-basement again, I saw her ID badge lying on the floor, half-melted into the concrete.  

The tasks got worse. Carrying sealed envelopes into rooms that didn’t exist on the floor plan. Sitting in pitch-black conference rooms while voices whispered numbers in languages I didn’t understand. Once, I was told to stand inside the vault with the door closed, “just to see how long you can last.”  

I lasted seven minutes before I started screaming.  

That was when I realized: this wasn’t hazing. This wasn’t training. This was feeding.  

The bank was alive.  

It fed on us—our fear, our sanity, our obedience. And Mr. H wasn’t a manager. He was a handler.  

I don’t know how I got out. One night, after another “assignment,” I just… walked. I didn’t pack my things. I didn’t say goodbye. I left my badge on the desk and ran until my lungs burned.  

Some of my friends weren’t so lucky. They’re still there, I think. Or what’s left of them is.  

Sometimes, late at night, I hear the scratching again.  

And I wonder if leaving was really an escape… or just a deferment.  

Because debts always come due.
