***Part 1: The Hallway at 3 AM***

***It began with the hospital hall.***



***My father has been in and out of the heart ward in the past seven days. The night shifts merge, a collage of coffee that is bad, the drone of fluorescent tubes and the smell of antiseptic that is not naturally able to neutralize the smell of fear. And last night when he had at last fallen into a fitful sleep I went out to clear my head.***



***I started moving to the lounge, but I must have made a wrong turn. The labels on the walls which were generally so distinct, appeared to swim. The passage was long, longer than it ought to have been. The linoleum floor that had been gaudily turquoise, had become a pallid grey, and the electric lamps had an intermittent, arrhythmic flicker. The far call bell of a nursing station died out into a very monotonous, steady murmur.***



***That's when I saw him.***



***There was a figure at the deep end of the corridor, where it was supposed to T-bone at into the east wing. Tall, impossibly so, and thin. It had a bad figure, angles were too great. And its head... The head of God was crowned with a jagged rack of antlers. Not the smooth shelf-branching bones of a deer, but a savage carving of brown bone and rusted coiling wire.***



***I stood motionless, my heart beating wildly against my ribs- a wild hysterical bang of what had happened to my father. I thought that I was simply tired and hallucinating because of stress and sleep deprivation. I hard blinking shook it off, yet there it stood. It was completely motionless, a statue in a crossroad of a hallway that was not supposed to be there.***



***It had no face. No eyes, no nose. A mere, black, vertical swan song running down its mouth. And a thin, grey vapour, curling in the dead air like the sad thread of a ghost, came gushing out of that opening.***



***My primitive brain was crying out to flee, and there was a part of me that was morbid and terrified and held me to my feet. What is that? The idea was a scream inside my head. Is it a patient? Art installation of some sort. The excuses were pitiful, and I stuck to them.***



***I looked too long.***



***The figure did not move, though the air in the air around it seemed to become thicker. The flashing of the lights was in time with the aching in my temples. And then I heard it, not with my ears, but with something within my skull, and it was not a voice, it was a thought that was forced into my own.***



***It was my name.***



***It is not my full name, but the childhood name my dad called me and no one has ever called me that name since I was ten. \[Redacted\].***



***It was but a whisper a breath of memory. And then it was gone. The character, the outstretched passageway, the flickering lights--They all came back to standard. I stood in an utterly normal, short passageway that led to the vending machines and I was shivering throughout my whole body in a cold sweat.***



***I reasoned that I was experiencing a waking dream. A panic attack. I returned to my dad in his room clutching my chest and spent the other part of the night watching the constant rise and fall of that, trying to forget the sound of my own name in that dead empty voice.***



***I ought to have known that it was not finished. It had learned my name. And now it was using it.***
