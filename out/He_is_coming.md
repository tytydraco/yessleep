I’ve worked at NASA for 14 years.
Not the astronaut kind — the other kind.
The quiet ones. The ones who spend their lives in rooms that smell like metal and old coffee, running simulations of things that should be impossible.

My field is gravitational wave mapping.
I study what happens when reality bends.

That’s why I was assigned to clean out the old archives — a collection of declassified astrophysical data digitized from paper. Most of it was junk: pre-Apollo test sheets, satellite telemetry, Cold War communications.

Then I found something labeled DEITY_OBSERVATION PROJECT.

The folder shouldn’t have existed.
It wasn’t even on our clearance index.

The metadata listed the year as 1913 — fifty years before NASA existed — and the classification tag read O-Δ-0. I’ve never seen that designation before or since.

The file began with an image of a stone tablet recovered from southern Iraq.
It looked like any other cuneiform artifact — until I read the translation.

⸻

“He came from the sky not as fire, but as a shadow.
He spoke not in thunder, but in thought.
We named him Elam, for he was the end of all things.”

It described how ancient kings made a covenant with a being that threatened to cleanse the earth — an agreement that, in exchange for worship and remembrance, humanity would be spared annihilation.

But near the bottom, the final line of the tablet had been etched later, in Akkadian — thousands of years newer — and translated as:

“The watchers built his tomb among the stars.”

⸻

At first, I thought it was a hoax.
Some misplaced museum file or mythological curiosity.
Then I read the next page.

Someone — some scientist — had linked the coordinates from the tablet to a real astronomical position. A stretch of dark sky in the constellation Draco.

According to the note, faint radio emissions had been detected there since the 1920s.
Too structured to be random. Too old to be human.

At the bottom of the document was a line typed in red ink:

“Containment stable as of this observation. Harmonic decay predicted by 2025 ± 3 years.”

I laughed out loud when I read it. “Containment” — as if ancient priests had somehow trapped a god in outer space.

Then I checked the coordinates myself.

And the signal was there.

⸻

It was faint — like background radiation — but not random.
It repeated every few minutes, like something breathing through static.

I sent my data up the chain.
Within an hour, my credentials were revoked.
My email locked.

Two men I didn’t recognize were waiting outside my office.
They didn’t flash badges, but they knew my name, my daughter’s school, my home address.

“Dr. Heller,” one said. “You’ve seen something meant to be forgotten.”

They didn’t threaten me.
They didn’t have to.

They just told me to stop.

⸻

That was two months ago.
Since then, I’ve been running private scans through civilian arrays.

The signal hasn’t stopped.
It’s getting stronger.

And it’s changing.

At certain hours of the night, it peaks sharply — then vanishes for exactly 4 minutes and 12 seconds.
Every time it returns, it’s louder.
Closer.

I reached out to an old colleague at Goddard who owed me a favor.
He told me, very quietly, that DEITY_OBSERVATION wasn’t a NASA program at all.

It predated NASA.
It had been carried forward from civilization to civilization — always renamed, always hidden inside whatever institution studied the heavens.

He also said there’s a vault in Langley called HOLLOWSTAR where they keep what little data remains.
No digital access. Temperature-controlled. Guarded.

Then his voice lowered even more.

“Every 5,126 years, Earth’s orbit aligns with the place where the ancients trapped him.
We think that’s when the signal strengthens.
The last time it happened, civilizations collapsed worldwide.”

I looked it up later.
That would have been around 3100 BCE.
Right when the Sumerians began to worship something called Elam.

⸻

Two nights ago, I received an email from a NASA address that doesn’t exist.
No subject. No signature. Just one attachment: a spectrogram image of the signal.

When I opened it, I saw faint binary code woven into the pattern.
I decoded it manually.

It said:

“THE AGREEMENT HAS EXPIRED.”

Since then, every telescope aimed at that patch of sky has reported gravitational distortion — as if something massive is pressing against the fabric of space from the other side.

But here’s what terrifies me most:

When you filter the signal into the audible range…
you can hear a voice.

It doesn’t sound alien.
It sounds human.

And sometimes, right before the pattern cuts out, I can make out the words.

“You stopped remembering.”
“You broke the seal.”
“Now I will make you remember.”

⸻

The agency will never tell the public.
They’ll say it’s a cosmic anomaly, a radiation burst, anything but the truth.

But when the night sky flickers, and the stars seem to pulse like a heartbeat — when you feel a deep vibration crawling through your teeth and bones — remember this:

We made a deal five thousand years ago.
We promised to remember him.
We promised to speak his name.

And now that we’ve forgotten,
he’s waking up.

And this time,
he remembers us
