This is probably just a glitch or maybe a prank or something — I don’t know. But I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it.

It happened a few nights ago. I couldn’t sleep and I was super hungry, like stomach-growling, head-throbbing kind of hungry. It was around 1:45am, and of course everything around me was closed. I opened Uber Eats just to check, thinking maybe I’d get lucky with some crappy gas station place or whatever.

Most of it was grayed out. But then I see this listing near the bottom: **Uncle Sal’s Pizza**.

I’d never heard of it before. No reviews, no address listed, no hours, nothing. Just this blurry picture of a slice of pepperoni pizza that looked like it was taken on a flip phone through a dirty window or something. Honestly, it looked kinda gross. But I was tired and starving and didn’t care.

The menu only had three things:

\- One Topping Slice – $5

\- House Special – $13

**- The Usual Slice – $9**

No descriptions. Nothing else.

I picked “The Usual Slice” because... I don’t even know. The name felt weirdly familiar. Like something I’d heard before but couldn’t place. Just felt kinda personal, I guess.

Anyway, I ordered it. The app said ETA 11 minutes, which made no sense at that hour, but whatever. It ended up taking like 15.

I never saw a car. Never heard anyone. Just got the notification that it had been delivered. When I opened the door, the box was just *there*, dead center on the porch. Uber Eats had a photo of it, but the photo looked… old? Like grainy and discolored, like something scanned from a print-out.

The box itself looked straight out of 1998 — red-and-white checkerboard pattern, weird cartoon chef on the front. And it was kinda yellowed, like it had been in storage for years.

Inside, the pizza was warm-ish, but clearly not fresh. The cheese had hardened in that gross way where it doesn’t pull apart, just rips. The pepperoni was shriveled and crunchy on the edges. It smelled like… I don’t know how to describe it. Not spoiled. Just old. Like basement pizza. But also… familiar? Almost like something from when I was a kid.

I ate one slice and tossed the rest. It wasn’t even good. I just felt weird.

Next morning, I go to check the listing again and it’s just… gone. Like it was never there. Not marked as closed — completely vanished. Even the order in my history just said “Unavailable.” No name, no contact. Nothing.

That creeped me out more than I want to admit.

So I called my mom later that afternoon, just randomly asked:  
“Hey, do you remember a pizza place called Uncle Sal’s?”

And she went quiet for a second and was like,

“Where did you hear that?”

I told her it came up on Uber Eats, and I ordered from it. She got *really* quiet after that.

Then she goes:

“That place shut down when you were little. Like, little-little. You don’t remember?”

Apparently, it used to be in this old strip mall not far from where we used to live. She said we went there a few times when I was a toddler. Birthday parties, stuff like that. She said it always smelled weird, even back then.

Then she said something that actually made me feel sick:

“The owner — Sal — he killed himself in the restaurant after they shut it down. I think you were four? They found him in the dining room. He wouldn’t leave after the health department condemned the place. He hanged himself with an extension cord from one of the ceiling fans.”

I didn’t know what to say to that. I don’t remember any of it. I don’t even remember the place existing.

But I drove out there. I had to. It’s like 15 minutes from my apartment now.

The strip mall’s basically dead — one of those places with boarded-up windows, trash in the parking lot, and a couple stores that look like fronts for scams.

And there it was. The old sign is still up. **Uncle Sal’s Pizza.**

The windows are filthy, but you can still kinda see inside. The booths are still there. One of those claw machine things in the corner. Crumpled paper napkins on the floor like it’s been frozen in time. And up on the counter?

A pizza box.  
Same design as the one I got.

I didn’t go in. I just left. I’ve felt… off ever since.

And here’s the part that really messed me up. Just a few minutes ago, I got a notification on my phone from Uber Eats.

**“Late night hunger? Why not reorder from Uncle Sal’s Pizza?”**

I have no idea how it got through. I deleted the app from my phone. I even turned off push notifications from everything. I don’t know if it’s a bug. Or some marketing thing gone wrong. Or something else.

But the thing is… I *can still smell it*.

That old pizza smell. Like cardboard and dust and warm pepperoni grease.

And part of me — a tiny, disgusting part — actually wants to order it again.
