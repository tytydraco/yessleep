 

I will show two cases, but there are many. This is the first.

On 6/21/2021, I dreamed and wrote down a dream. Then post it on Twitter. I was in an elevator. I am very afraid of them because in dreams they behave very strangely. I touched the 13th floor and began to rise. In the heights, the doors opened and there was nothing. There was the sky, clouds and when I looked down there was green in the surroundings and something that I described as a small mountain or similar to a hill. And I thought that I had touched the 13th floor, that something had to come. Shortly after, a kind of small finite apartment arrived that, in the end, had a kind of water tank. Everything, almost floating in the air. I woke up, I wrote it down and I really didn't know where the hand was coming from. Until the 24 of 6 of 2021 arrived. Tremendous news, a building collapsed in Miami. Literally part of the water tank was left hanging in a 12-story building, 13 was the terrace. There was a kind of hanging path that was formed by a ventilation duct. It was given on an avenue called Collins that its translation means Hill. And as if that were not enough, days later I found out that the famous daughter of a friend who died a few years ago was there and she and her partner were miraculously saved. They ran out of the elevator when they saw the dust covering everything. I mean, yes. The one who put me in that elevator in that dream was this girl's father. A way of saying, Hey I'm here. As previously mentioned, there is a range that generally goes from a few hours to a few days. In this type of case, 2 or 3.

Second Case

I'm going to show you something that you might find interesting. Dreams are much more than they seem. We all have them, they occur on a plane we don't know, and they receive echoes from the space-time line. As if that were not enough, there are entities, beings that do not have a biological body and can use dreams to transcend messages. And these are validated because they use the time line. By showing an event from the future, they make you understand that the communication was real when it happened.

There are many cases. I have a list on my insta. And they are all publicly accessible. I'm going to put one of the last ones because I'm going through these days. I am going to tell it, explain it and then through the link that I am going to leave, they will be able to verify everything I tell. Sure, if you're interested. Because the idea is to reach people who may be interested and not have to read ignorant nonsense. If you're not interested, go ahead and save the malicious comment.

I dream that I write down January 12, 2023. I write it down on my cell phone, notepad with date and time. Then, when I'm more awake, I post it on my social media. Especially Twitter. It cannot be modified, it has a certain date provided by servers.

War zone. A family. A young teenager wanted to drive. A boy maybe a little older, started a car. And we went for a walk... we were in front of a building destroyed in the middle, and in one of the bathrooms that had been left outside, a band was playing nice music. I stopped and exclaimed "nice acoustic". Then we crossed a gate, and we arrived like a river. A missile hit us and we fell into the water. And we were crouched by the shore. The young man who started the car was injured. He hid inside a boat and the enemy grabbed him. He told me that his body was going to be tied to a post. I don't know what he meant to tell me.

Dreams are a language. Everyone thinks they know something and that if you don't give dates and times or the matter isn't exact, it's just the product of your imagination. But that is a prejudice, a bias from a person who knows nothing about the subject. Believing you know is not having knowledge on the subject.

Following... two days later, January 14, 2023. A missile falls on a building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Which is located on the shore of a river, which has a similar name. The city is named after this river. The first piece of news I found spoke of 9 dead and 60 missing. And that a 15-year-old girl had died. The building was literally split in the middle.

And there we have... the building, the young woman, the missile, the river. The boat is missing, right? January 16, 2023, I think... maybe 18, it happens that Russia denies the matter. He says it was probably Ukraine's anti-missile system. And from the Ukraine, he says they hit the building with an rh22 missile. An anti-ship missile. That they do not have the technology to stop that type of missile.

Perhaps the post where the wounded youth was hung or tied... was the missile. You see, in dreams the communications are somewhat different. Here we chat, we talk as I do at this moment I tell you about these events. In dreams, it's like a movie. More visual, more metaphorical. They didn't say, hey, we're from a city where there's a huge river that gave its name to this metropolis. Rather, they took me there. and they showed how the missile came from the water. or, it served or is used for large and metallic things like a warship.

That's why I laugh when they say, che, without dates it's just your madness that you accommodate a boleo fact that fits what you say. How many missiles fell on a building lately? Look on the net, it hasn't happened for several months. Like 10. I mean, what do you know skinny? pay attention and learn.

And this is how a small note that corresponds to a dream tells us about a future event. 2 days. And it was all over the news. Even the Pope condemned him on Twitter.

Do you think it's just a case? Well no. They are many. Everyone tells something different obviously, related to his life, his end. But, there is not only death, there are other things. Like advancing Messi's change of course to another club or winning the third world cup. If I can leave a second link with Messi's dream announcing a third world cup before Christmas, I will. The dream says, three little bottles under a tree. The translation was, win the third cup near Christmas. That's why I try to explain to them that dreams are a language. Well, just let me put a link. If they ask for it, I make another post and put it up for them to see.

I want to tell you that I am from Argentina. Surely my English is not very good. It may be that something you have read sounds strange to you or is not well understood. I'm sorry about that. But, I have to try.
