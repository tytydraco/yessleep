We moved into the new house after a long week of struggling to move. Snow fell in the five final days of us getting a U-Haul. 

The first night we slept there made us feel like we were on a different planet. We had been at our prior place of residence for three years until our landlord passed away and the son that inherited the property decided to raise the rent. This prompted us to move with no other choice.

The newer place was a two bedroom, one bath and single kitchennette with a v-shaped ceiling. There was a casement above that moonlight would seep through during the nocturnal hours. 

Once we were officially in the new apartment we still had rows of unopened boxes laid out in every corner. The washing machine and dryer were the only electrical appliances hooked up other than the TV that I had hung on the wall. That did not last long because the television fell off its brackets. We went to bed early.

Our preferred sleeping conditions were identical which made it easy. We both liked our places of dreaming to be cool, dark, and full of running air. 

Allison rolled over and draped her arms over me before we both fell into slumber.

I awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of her screaming. I asked her to tell me what was wrong. 

“Turn on the light,“ she said.

There still was not a lamp connected anywhere, nor did we even have a nightstand. 

Instead I reached from my phone and turned on the flashlight to illuminate the area. 

She was trembling and hyperventilating. I could smell sweat. 

I gripped her hand in mine and tried to console her. I asked her what was wrong.

“I don’t know,” she said in between sobs. 

Over the course of the next week the place began to resemble our own again. We put up our own trinkets, knickknacks, and made sure everything was tidy. I assembled a desk and tried to move it out of the way after I put up my bookshelves for various mechanical and engineering times I had collected over the years for my occupation.

We instinctively knew it would take a while before it began to feel like home but we were on our way.

Her sleep became increasingly worse. These episodes of night terrors became frequent. It had lapsed into a normal occurrence that I anticipated as an inevitability every night when I pulled the blankets over my head.

“He is chasing me…” she would say in between lapses into shut-eye. “He won’t let me be.”

After the eighth consecutive night in a row I made breakfast for her in the morning before my shift started. 

I brewed her an espresso which took her by surprise because we did not even have a machine capable of such a concoction until I had bought one to give her as an unexpected gift. Halfway through the meal I interlaced my fingers in hers.

“You should see a therapist and have a sleep study done,” I said.

I let the words hang in the air. 

“Jim from work was diagnosed with sleep apnea and he didn’t know he had it until then,” I said. “I don’t think that’s what you have but it would be good to get it checked out regardless. He told me that everyone should get one. It can’t hurt.”

“I don’t have insurance,” she said. 

“Don’t worry about that. My boss offered overtime. There might be a few longer days but we can swing at at least one or two sessions. It would be nice to figure out where this came from.”

She agreed although her compliance was tentative. Neither one of us were strangers to forms of therapy, at least in a group setting. We were both recovering alcoholics who met each other in AA years earlier. We were a proud sober couple. One-on-one therapy was something we were always enthusiastic about although it was never financially feasible. 

Yet I also knew the sacrifice of my time for her well-being would be worth it.

Her sleep suffered more and more. Within a week’s time she marked the date on her phone calendar of her first appointment.

“I saw Dr. Chancey,” she told me one night before we were about to sleep.

I was guilt stricken over not having remembered it was that day. 

“How did it go?”

“He asked me a lot of questions about my genetics. He wanted to know if anyone else in my family was prone to night terrors. I told him I didn’t know but I didn’t think so. It’s impossible to be completely sure.”

Allison’s parents were killed in a car accident when she was only four years old. Shortly afterwards she was adopted by a family in a German commune in Pennsylvania. Following four years of what could be called stability, her parents ended up being ostracized due to the adoptive father having an affair. Such an action did not bode well for their religious beliefs, despite how the men tried to blame her adoptive mother instead for a period of time, but the actual evidence was irrefutable - the man raising her was reported by the mistress.

 It was a lifetime of constant moving and various forms of familial identity conflicts before she left home on her own and got a degree in accounting.

“Did you tell the doctor about your…” 

I wanted to inquire if she had brought up the fact that she was now afraid of the dark. Saying the phrase out loud seemed an impossible task. Conceptualizing it in my own mind gave me a sense of absurd questioning at the reality of it. I was hesitant to complete my sentence out of fear of it coming across as a judgmental phrasing. Such a statement had not been uttered since my childhood.

“I did. He calls it ‘nyctophobia.’ He said that it can manifest an adults later in life. He asked me if I’ve been under stress lately. I said the move didn’t help either one of us.”

I hugged her. I reassured her that we were about to gain a new sense of normalcy. 

She asked if I could keep the lamp on. I had been meaning to buy a nightlight that would be less bright, but in the meantime I had purchased a sleep mask. This helped a little bit, although it still was not foolproof as some of the luminescence would creep in at the edges of my peripheries, especially with the triangular window above the foyer causing the moon’s rays to seep in through the door cracks of our bedroom.

As I tried to get some slumber I questioned how much I believed in my closing statement to her. I pictured a future where we would settle into comfortable routines. 

Every day could be a well-rested one without the looming threat of experimental antidepressants full of possible side effects. The idea of gaining a normal life that would be easy to adapt to as the cure rather than strange chemical strategy was comforting. I lingered on it. Although I knew it could have been a wish it still helped me get to sleep. 

I was awoken once again. 

Allison screamed and thrashed. I grabbed her arms and tried to shake her into consciousness. 

“It tried to kill me,” she said. Her voice sounded hoarse, desperate and full of terror. 

“What did?”

“He…he looks like a a stick figure made of ash.”

“Honey, it was a nightmare. Whatever it was isn’t real.”

She did not argue with me but my words did not give her comfort. She stood, went to the main doorway and turned on the light in the room. I looked at the clock and it was three in the morning. She went back to bed and shut her eyes while I stewed and tried to sleep in the middle of what might as well have been a giant flashlight.

We sat next to one another in the office of Dr. Chancey. Although I had fought to get us a Zoom appointment, the practitioner was convinced that he needed to see her in person. The drive was only forty-five minutes but it was still a grueling one. This was especially true after a long shift of working extra hours the day before.

When we were called into the office, Chancey was much younger than I expected him to be, but the many books aligning the wall behind his desk gave indicators that he was at least well-read.

“A shadow monster is a sign of a repressed or hidden part. Perhaps you feel you are not allowed to express yourself. This can be for a variety of reasons. You could have an overbearing boss. Maybe you are a creative person and you feel as though you don’t have an outlet. People with power over us sometimes don’t give creedence to our opinions. That could be anybody from your so-called best friend to an employer to an irritating acquaintance to even the leader of your country.”

She nodded and did not dispute his theory.

I had a moment where I had to assess if I had been not listening to her. I felt as though I had dedicated every waking moment to her well-being. Was I growing egocentric in my own altruism in the way in which I took care of her? 

Perhaps I thought that the material comforts and even psychological treatments I worked hard to provide was enough, and I was not emotionally present for her because, deep down, I was convinced I did not have to be. Feelings of both anger and self-deprecation flowed through me. The rage was a result of Chancey acknowledging that it could be me, even though he did it indirectly by talking about any other example except for ‘husband.’

It had to be me, I reasoned. Her boss at the accounting office was politeX I had only heard Allison complain about her one time in the last three years.

“I would like to put you on an antidepressant. It may take up to eight weeks to work. I will also prescribe diphenhydramine to assist with sleep despite risks. We will also try Risperdal.”

“What is the last one?” I asked. 

“It’s an antipsychotic.”

“She isn’t hallucinating,” I said as I tried to hide my growing anger. “She had a nightmare. Isn’t dream symbolism your bread and butter?”

“Stop,” Allison said as she turned to me. 

“No, he brought it up. Do you want her to take a bunch of drugs? Are we here for a hands on approach, or is shoving pills down her throat the only answer?”

“I’ll try it,” Allison said as she slapped me on the arm.

It was four nights before she had another episode. 

“It’s just a dream, honey,” I said as I rolled over. 

When I opened my eyes and saw through the natural drowsy blurriness I observed a pool of blood where her head was. 

She was not in bed. 

I stood and found her in the corner. Her knees were clutched to her chest and she was rocking back-and-forth in her white nightgown splattered in crimson. It looked as though she was crying tears made of red. Upon closer inspection I could not figure out what was wrong. I considered how there could be an invader in the apartment.

“You need to tell me what’s happening right now,” I said. I bent down and clutched both of her arms.

“I can’t… the dark takes me. It blankets itself around me and won’t let me go. It’s the coldest, loneliest feeling I’ve ever had. I can’t take it anymore.”

I looked at the stream of blood from her feet to the mattress. I looked at everything and saw what appeared to be two small pieces of skin at the halfway point between her and our mattress.

She had sliced her eyelids off.

The next week went by in a blur. It was an odd mixture of a variety of emotions and even disassociation. Sleeplessness haunted me. I took her to the hospital and what followed was me learning a variety of new medical titles of different types of doctors I wished I did not know. Opthamologists coordinated with oculoplastic doctors and ocularists to help her. 

This resulted in a twenty thousand dollar hospital bill for two silicone prosthetic replacements which were very life-like but texturally uncanny enough to serve as a reminder as to what happened that night.

When she was in the hospital recovering from surgery she grabbed me by the lapels and pulled me in close. 

“You have to believe it wasn’t me,” she said.

“What do you mean? You’re telling me it was an intruder?”

“It was the ashen man,” she said. 

I tried not to judge, roll my eyes or get upset. Calling her delusional would not be helpful. I had learned in AA that what some in recovery call dry drunk behavior is always lying in wait for the alcoholic. Such behavior is characterized by blaming and judging everyone around you and not taking any ownership for negative occurrences. I was self-conscious about this and tried to approach every problem with an open mind regarding who could be at fault or what needed to be done to fix the situation. I tried to take accountability for my own mental health as well as my circumstances. Theoretically, this was supposed to help relationships both professional and romantic.

Yet I was unable to summon that maturity.

“You’ve got to be kidding,” I said. “There is no such thing. Monsters only exist on Netflix and in Washington DC.”

“Honey, you don’t understand-“

For the first time ever I interrupted and even shushed her. I would later feel guilty. 

They made her stay another night.

I drove home because I still had to go to work.  I laid in bed and knew sleep would be an impossible task. 

I turned all the lights off and it was good to sit in darkness again. I cannot remember if I closed my eyes or not before I saw something at the other end of the room.

It was a silhouette with a scrawny body. The creature’s arms were longer than its torso. Hands shaped like stalagmites extended towards me. The sharp fingers were clear even in the blackness as a shadow puppet against the light of a projector. When it brushed against me I felt its touch. It was cold and balmy, like the claws had been dipped in some sort of liquid, and when I stared at its face in abject horror I rolled out of bed. 

When I awoke I processed the event. I had been a staunch believer in nothing other than our own limited shelf life as human beings. Spiritual phenomena was something I had always tried to have an open mind about but could never fully accept. I fell on the side of physicality, of materialism. 

After that experience I decided my wife and I having the same visions was not coincidence. 

The next day I entertained the notion of it being shared psychosis, but I could not believe that was the root cause either.

When the physicians said Allison could leave the hospital, I picked her up and drove her to a friend’s house one state over. I had already moved all of our things into my friend’s spare bedroom and even transferred to another work site through my company there. 

She was concerned about her accounting job. I told her I would support her fully with two jobs if I had to, a promise I have since kept for the last six months. 

We eventually found a smaller but comfortable apartment near a set of train tracks. The place is clean but our neighbors are likely dangerous people. In a strange way they are still less frightening than what we dealt with before.

The visions of the ashen man did stop. 

Life still has not been normal, however. Allison deals with physical discomfort due to not being able to close her eyes all the way still. Some days there is drooping. The aesthetic difference has made her social confidence lessen. 

Sometimes I stand on the rooftop of the building we live in to get some fresh air. Every once in a while I will look out at the field across the way and see a skinny man between the trees, and while he stands still and has never moved whenever my eyes have been on him, I often think about what his hands may look like up close. A darker part of me considers if the waking realm is the only one he exists in.
