I feel absolutely sick writing this, but I’ve been told by a friend that writing this stuff down might be important. That same friend also told me that it wouldn’t be a good idea to share my name, so I won’t. I’m writing this from a Hilton Garden Inn about five minutes from my apartment. I haven’t been there in two months, but my neighbor texted me an update about it today. It sounds bad. They have torn up all of the carpet, large sections of drywall are missing, and they’ve started ripping out the ceiling. “When I say “they,” I’m not sure if it’s still the police, or if the leasing agency has hired someone to clean up. I have pictures, letters, furniture, and memories in that apartment. It was home for almost five years, and I just don’t care. I’ll never, ever set foot in that place again.

Two months ago, we had a MASSIVE storm roll through Cincinnati. I live, or lived, in an apartment complex closer to the edge of the city. I don’t want to give too many specifics, but imagine one of those cookie-cutter standalone complexes that has a few apartment buildings and a shitty pool. The rent wasn’t the cheapest I could find, but the complex is gated, so I justified the cost with an increase in safety. I’m a single woman, and have always been a little paranoid about living alone. Once I finished college and took a graphic design job here in the city, I realized that I no longer had a pool of college friends to choose a roommate from. I was faced with two options; either live by myself for the first time, or play random roommate roulette. Unimpressed by either, I decided to create a third option: my Murphy.

Murphy is, or was, the greatest thing that ever happened to me. I know a lot of dog owners say that about their pets, but Murphy really was my saving grace. Moving to the city was hard for me, and starting my first real job was even harder. Being greeted by Murphy’s big goofy smile was the highlight of coming home every day. When I adopted murphy, he was about the size of a soccer ball, and almost as round. However, it didn’t take more than a couple of months before that soccer ball began growing into a mountain . . . pun intended; my Murphy was a Bernese Mountain Dog, and at just under 120 pounds, he was more mountain than dog. He was a gentle giant, and probably not the stalwart guardian I’d adopted him to be, but he was my very best friend. We’d sit on the couch together every night, and he’d lay his heavy head in my lap. We’d go for walks in the common areas, and the handful of older people who stroll around our complex would always give him a treat. Every night, we’d lay in bed next to one another.

This nightmare began with the storm. Our complex is kind of in the middle of corporate-chain hell; surrounded by gas stations, a red lobster, an outback steakhouse, you get the gist. However, despite our proximity to the center of this commercial purgatory, we ALWAYS lose power during these nasty storms. What’s worse, we must be near the end of some network or grid, because we’re always the last group of buildings in our area to have power restored. 

This storm was particularly bad. I remember getting home sometime after dark and it was pouring down rain. The leaves hadn’t begun to change just yet, but there were twigs and leaves all over the parking lot from the wind. Luck would have it that I slipped into my apartment just before the complex’s street lights went out.

I was greeted by a dark apartment. I don’t think people realize how poorly apartment complexes like this are designed in terms of natural light. My whole apartment only has two windows: one at the front in the kitchen, and one in my little bedroom. That leaves the main hallway, both bathrooms, and the living room without light for most of the day. During an outage like this, and especially after the sun goes down, you open that door to a PITCH black apartment.

The primal fear one has when they’re met with such darkness evaporated the minute I heard Murphy’s collar jingle in from somewhere in the dark. He came bounding out and I felt him barrel into my leg, and up onto me. I scratched his heavy head and he plopped down, trotting back into the darkened living room.

I did what every sane person does when returning to a dark apartment on a stormy night; I walked through every room with my phone’s light to make sure there weren’t any unwelcome visitors lurking in the shadows. That split second before you throw back a shower curtain, when your mind has prepared itself for the small chance that there’s actually something there, can leave you on edge. Anyways, after making my rounds, it was time to brave the dreaded rain to let Murphy use the bathroom. I had been diligent in training him, and we’d actually gotten to the point where I could just stand at the top of the stairs while he’d run down to the bushes next to our building. With a quick clap, he’d bound right back up the steps and into the apartment.

As I opened our front door, it really struck me just how dark it was outside. Not *one* of the nauseatingly bright restaurant signs was glowing, and the handful of headlights I could see through the rain were far off in the distance. The project I’m toiling on at work is for an overseas client, so I’ve had to keep some weird hours to keep my meetings with them. I hadn’t checked my phone when I got home, but I’m sure it was at least 11:00pm.

Murphy must have darted past my leg without me even knowing (not an uncommon occurrence), and was doing his business somewhere in the dark. I couldn’t see much in the murky night, but I did catch a glance at one thing as the beam of a distant car danced across the sheets of rain. Across the parking lot, I saw a man turned 90 degrees to my building, and he was relieving himself. He was only illuminated for  second, but I swear I saw it. It isn’t unusual to see drunk people stumbling around the complex at night, and I’ve seen a lot worse in this parking lot than a drunk dude pissing. Even still, there was something so creepy about it; the rain, the darkness, it was like he was hiding out there.

Murphy took longer to come back than usual, but he eventually crawled up the steps out of the rain. I could hear him panting as he reached the top step, and he began a half-hearted shake to get the water off of his fur. We both moseyed back into the apartment.

I felt my way back inside, and plopped down on the couch. I used my phone’s screen to light my path, as the little flashlight on my phone stopped working after I dropped it a few months earlier. I pulled up a blanket and started scrolling on my phone. I kept the brightness low to conserve battery. I heard Murphy thumping his way down the hall towards me, and I realized that his cadence wasn’t quite right. Maybe six months previously, Murphy had injured one of his front paws on a piece of glass in the parking lot, and developed an odd walk for the better part of two weeks. His cadence now was similar to that, irregular and slightly off kilter. Even still, I felt his weight impact the couch cushions as he jumped up to join me. As I scrolled, Murphy’s head nuzzled under my arm. His head felt big, and I winced at the water still clinging to his fur. Something else struck me too; Murphy  stank. Don’t get me wrong, a wet dog smelling bad isn’t exactly unheard of, but I mean he smelt BAD. It wasn’t “dog” bad, either. The only thing I could liken it to was a smell I’d encountered while I was working at Dollar General in high school. There was this guy who worked there, probably 18 or 19, who just smelled terrible ALL the time. Just the worst body odor you could imagine, the guy obviously didn’t bathe a lot, as evidenced by his perpetually greasy hair. Murphy smelled something like that. As he nuzzled his snout into my chest, I briskly patted his head and told him to “go on” and get off the couch. He snapped up, and lumbered elsewhere.

Scrolling on my phone got kind of old, and the rhythmic pattering of the rain outside was tempting my eyelids closed. Once again feeling my way through the dark, I made my way into the bedroom. Feeling bad about the scolding I had given Murphy, I called for him to join me in bed. I know some people think its gross to let their dog sleep with them, but Murphy has always been a great pup to sleep next to. Sometimes he sleeps at the end of the bed, and other times he snuggles right up next to me.

I hoped that Murphy didn’t smell quite as bad now that he had had some time to dry off. As I heard him in the hallway, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I heard *footsteps* in the hallway. Not the friendly trotting of my Murphy, but the distinct, menacing footfalls of a human being. My ears rang in the silence, just as Murphy came bounding into the room unbothered. I sighed in relief. Hearing the neighbor’s footsteps isn’t that uncommon, but they seldom sound that loud. I guessed that the power outage had killed all of the background noise I was used to, as there was no air conditioner or refrigerator running to muffle the sounds of apartment living. The darkness is one thing, but the silence is another. I’m glad I still had the sound of rain to serve as my white noise.

Murphy jumped into bed with one big leap. He wasn’t wet anymore, but he still stank to high heaven. As he pawed at my side, I decided to pet him a little before banishing him to the end of the bed. I rubbed his big head, and realized just how big he’d gotten. Looking at him grow little by little every week, it was easy to forget how large he was. I rubbed his head in the dark, marveling at how big my little pup had gotten. It seemed like Murphy was getting bigger by the hour. While I was rubbing his fur, I felt Murphy jump up and begin uncharacteristically licking my face. He’d licked and nibbled on me as a puppy, but I’d broken him of that habit a long time ago. He got in four or five licks to my face before I scolded him and pushed him off. He went silent and still. Then, without warning, he did it again, jumping up on me with his weight, and licking my face. This time I yelled at him, and  felt his weight shift to the end of the bed. At this point, I was convinced that Murphy had gotten into something outside. Maybe he’d messed with a dead animal, or gotten into some garbage. Either way, he was acting odd, and continued to stink up the room. I resolved to check him out in the morning, and call the vet if he still wasn’t acting right. I laid back down, and with Murphy perched by my feet, I checked the time on my phone. 1:15. Right as a checked it, the screen froze, and the 3% battery marker in right hand corner invited a black screen. With my phone finally dead, the decision was made for me, and I closed my eyes to go to sleep.

I woke up disoriented in the dark. It had to be some time later in the night, as my room remained dark as pitch. I woke to that foul smell, and a warm sensation over my shoulder. As my wits returned, I realized that Murphy had migrated up the bed to sleep next to me. However, unlike his usual posture of curling into a massive ball, it felt like murphy had one of his paws resting on my shoulder. I could hear him breathing, almost snoring, in a way dissimilar to my memory. Once again, I felt the hair on my neck stand up, as if I sensed something imminently wrong. That feeling faded, though, as I reached out to grab my Murphy’s fur. He felt soft and warm, and I felt him heave with every breath. I went to move his paw off my shoulder, when I realized how swollen it felt. Usually I could wrap my hand all the way around Murphy’s leg, but his leg felt thick and swollen in my hand. It also felt heavy as I pushed it off of me. Murphy stirred and stopped his snoring, but didn’t move or stir. I turned around to avoid his smell, and drifted back to sleep.

I woke up to the earliest signs of light outside. It couldn’t be any later than 7:00 or so. All I could see of my room was the vague outline of my doorway and window. Feeling the urge to pee, I rolled out of bed, only to jolt at the sound of a thud in the hallway. I froze, momentarily wondering where Murphy was. We weren’t in the room, which almost certainly meant that it was him thumping around in the hallway. I made my way to the doorway, freezing once more. The door was closed. Had I closed it when I went to bed? I usually closed it, but I couldn’t remember. Either way, the door was closed, and Murphy wasn’t with me. I twisted the knob, and gently swung the door inward. Peering around the corner, I stared down the darkened hall.

All at once, my heart stopped itself, and retreated to the furthest reaches of my stomach. There at the end of my hallway stood a figure. It must have been at least six feet tall, bulky and unnatural in the bluish hue of the rainy morning. Its unnatural frame held something in its hand, but I couldn’t make out what it was. What I could make out was the head, which betrayed the unquestionable silhouette of a Bernese Mountain dog. It was my Murphy. But, it wasn’t my Murphy. Not at all.

In an unnaturally swift motion, it fell from its human stance, and crashed to the floor on all fours, shaking the apartment as it did. It let out an unconvincing bark, loud and guttural, staring at me through the dark. Before I could register it, the thing was bounding down the hall at me, sloppily crawling towards me on all fours.

I don’t remember screaming, but the hoarseness in my voice, and my neighbors’ calls to police, suggest I must have. I remember retreating to the bedroom. I remember locking the door. I remember the banging and howling from the other side, as the blows to my door hit around the height of a human fist.

The howls weren’t my Murphy, or any dog for that matter. They sounded like the growls and screams that echo through a mental institution.

There are gaps in my memory. Locking the door is so vivid in my mind, and so is the howling and screaming of that monster. What I don’t remember is opening the bedroom window, or jumping into the hedges below. The rain-soaked ground must have made for a soft landing, because I didn’t break anything despite falling from a story up.

What I haven’t forgotten, and what I’ll never forget, is the look he gave me from that window. The pale blue of the early morning, coupled with the cold indifference of the still pounding rain, framed that horror in my bedroom window. I looked up from my place on that muddy ground to see him glaring down from my bedroom. Tattered fur across his torso gave way to a decidedly human, albeit grotesque, human head. Stringy hair framed a pale, sickly face grinning with a nauseating row of yellowed teeth. It was the face a man no older than 30, though twisted and aged by unspeakable depravity. He winked a soulless eye at me, and closed the window.

I learned later that what he’d been holding in his hand was a large paintbrush, the kind you use to paint a wall. The innocent thuds I heard that morning were the sound of that freak painting my name on the walls of my apartment with the blood of my Murphy.

His name was Winton Norris. I’d never seen the man in my life, at least if I had, I’d never realized it. I knew the neighbors to the right of me, but I’d always figured that the apartment on the other side of me was empty. Sometimes, it was. Sometimes, it wasn’t. The same goes for my downstairs neighbors, too. I always thought the unit was owned by somebody who didn’t have the good sense to rent it out. For at least two years, I never saw anyone come or go from those apartments. In hindsight, there were always clues that something was amiss. Little cracks in the seams of wall paneling, small holes drilled in the living room wall, floor vents that never seemed to have any airflow. I always chalked it up to the shoddy maintenance work you often find in these apartments. The detective told me there were at least nine peepholes looking into my apartment, spread out between the downstairs unit and the one next door. Winton Norris owned them both.

Winton wasn’t on anybody’s radar. From what the police say, he’d lived a quiet life as a programmer for the better part of his career, living in a filthy little apartment somewhere across the complex. The detective suspects he saw me walking Murphy one day, and what might have started as some creepy crush snowballed into a sick infatuation. At some point, they think he got jealous of my sweet Murphy, as strange as that sounds.

The prosecutor shared Winton’s bank records with me a couple of weeks ago. He spent almost every penny he had on those two units, setting them up for this grand plan. His biggest investment, however, came in the form of that vile creation: the suit.

There’s a man in Japan that the detective told me about. I don’t remember his name, but I do remember the photo he showed me. It was in an article from Business Insider that read “Japanese Man Spends $15,000 on lifelike dog costume.” I encourage you to look it up, just to give you an idea of what this thing looks like. Winton had every post from this guy saved on his computer, and an endless number of computer sketches of his own dog costume. He must have spent hours upon hours, months upon months, watching Murphy and I in our home. He had to practice walking, panting, and laying down. Just feet from where we lay every night, this creep was mirroring us, and longing for the night he’d replace my dog out in the rain.

I don’t know if he waited for the perfect night when the power was out, or if it just worked out that way. Either way, it was clear he was going to be caught. Even after closing my bedroom window, he didn’t have the sanity to flee, or even kill himself. When the police arrived, they found him in the middle of the living room on all fours, completely naked, and panting like a dog. He was extremely thin. I was told he likely lost weight in the months leading up to that night in an attempt to weigh the same as my Murphy, but he never quite lost enough.

That night never ends. The sense of dread I have lying awake in this hotel room is immeasurable. The determination he had to invade my life, to take my Murphy, and to spend an evening in my puppy’s place. The nightmare won’t end until he’s gone. There’s a hearing tomorrow down at the courthouse, and the detective tells me that the monster will be there. I bought a pistol from the pawn shop this morning, and have been practicing with it in the mirror all afternoon. I’m going to get a good night’s sleep again, no matter what it takes.
