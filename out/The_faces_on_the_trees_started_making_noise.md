I’ve always seen them. The twisted, mangled, screaming, agonized faces that can sometimes make up an entire trees trunk. 

Sometimes they are tiny. But I can still see them. When they are bigger I can see them from farther away. Always in a horrified, mouth-open, soundless scream. 

When I was a child, it was frightening. To stare out your bedroom window for years and see the same faces staring in terror at you. I remember when I first ran crying to my parent’s bedroom. They brought me back and showed me there wasn’t anything to be scared of. But they couldn’t see what lived in the trees.

As I grew, the faces were still there. I’d learn to avoid certain trees specifically because the faces on them were more sinister than I could handle. I’d only go into the Walmart on the grocery side because the other side had a massive old oak with three faces I could spot from any direction. 

Although the faces always terrified me, I didn’t ever think I should tell anyone because I felt like I was normal besides this one thing. I didn’t know how to explain it. But I’m understanding more and more with each word.

I’m 30 now, and I’ve moved around a bit. Found myself in Blue Ridge. There weren’t any faces on the trees directly around my property, but on the way in and out of the development… there are some pretty freaky ones. Faces contorted in stretched agony. One has an eye that follows me. This was new. 

I would go to work and I could watch it, watch me, in the rearview mirror. On the way back in it stares as I turn the corner up the mountain. 

I just never thought about it or looked for too long at many of the other faces I’d seen throughout my lifetime and chalked it up to another thing to make me panic when looking at a tree. 

For a week I watched myself be watched until the immediate fear subsided and I was left with an unsettled feeling constantly in the pit of my stomach. 

The unsettled feeling subsided as I entered my home, I decided maybe sleep was the best option. I woke up and, having left my curtains open since moving into my new home, was frightened by a new face on a tree facing directly into my bedroom sliding glass balcony door. 

This petrified face made me feel woozy to even look at it. But both its eyes were transfixed on me and they followed my movements out of the bedroom. I slammed the door behind me and ran around the house closing the curtains. 

I ignored the new face as best I could. I never opened my curtains in my bedroom. But I could still feel it staring and the constant feeling of being watched was never gone. 

I’d had enough and yesterday… I chopped the fucking tree down. 

I watched as the eyes followed me as it toppled over and crashed into the river at the base of the high hill I live on. 

I was overjoyed. I was screaming with happiness. When I stopped I thought I heard my scream echoing across the narrow valley. But I just kept going. And going. And going. 

I fell asleep last night and could hear the echoing still. I left for work. I still heard it. I could see in the morning that there were new faces. New tortured, frozen faces all screaming at me. Echoing.

They are all still screaming… echoing… 

I couldn’t help myself. I took a chainsaw to the trees. After I cut down one… they all stopped screaming. They started whispering. I could hear them reciting pieces of my life. Secrets they were passing along to the next. I screamed and went for another tree with my chainsaw.

I was vicious. I cut down two, then three. The voices had stopped. Like they were waiting for me to finish. I should have never done it. 

They started talking to me. Telling me things. 

I… I can’t tell you. 

I am drawn now to them. To the trees. Even as I write this I know it’s probably my last time writing.

I can hear the echo. 

It’s clear though and I know it doesn’t make sense if you haven’t seen the faces. But I never realized how truly beautiful they were until now. Like etched angels on marble.
