**Wednesday, October 11, 1995**
  

  
That morning, mom told me to check the animals and see if everything was alright with them. It wasn’t; they were all dead, drained of blood, and hung upside down on a wire she used to dry washed clothes. I wanted to tell her this, but she was already asleep.
  

  
I then left for my grandfather’s house. He lived alone; I never knew my grandmother; she had died when giving birth to my mom. Maybe that was why part of the cold relationship between mother and Janosz came. Maybe he blamed her for his wife’s death.
  

  
Janosz was on the road. He returned from the woods with a dead deer in his wagon, three buckets of mushrooms, and two large trout. 
  

  
“What are you doing here, son? Shouldn’t you be sleeping?” he asked.
  

  
“Sir, something’s happened to my mom; she got a fever. She is sick. It’s terrible,” I replied.
  

  
“Here, help me get these inside, and we’ll talk,” he told me. 
  

  
 I grabbed the trouts and two buckets full of mushrooms. In one, he had penny buns and in the other Caesar’s mushrooms. 
  

  
“You got luck today, huh?” I asked. In his other bucket, he had golden chanterelles. He grabbed the deer with one hand and threw it over his shoulder like it was nothing. I wondered what my life would’ve been like if I’d had a father like him. Sheer determination, power, will, and discipline. He looked very healthy too. He nodded and invited me inside his small house. He liked to live modestly with as few earthly possessions as possible.
  

  
He had a room that served as both bedroom and living room, a small kitchen where he mainly cooked stews from what he hunted or whatever fish he may have caught, and a small bathroom with a tub and sink. He had only a handful of chickens in his backyard, three turkeys, a cow, two dogs, and a cat. He said he didn’t like having pigs or eating their meats.
  

  
He sat me on a chair in the kitchen, and I told him about yesterday’s events. He glanced at the wall behind me for a moment, not saying anything. I saw his gaze fixating on a picture of the Virgin Mary holding Baby Jesus painted on wood. 
  

  
“A priest gave me this thirty years ago. He said it would come in handy in times like these. I guess your good-for-nothing father can’t rest, and we’ll have to kill him again,” he said, making the sign of the cross three times.
  

  
Kill my father again. 
  

  
“I hated him with all my soul. I have many reasons for doing so, Janosz. Many reasons. I can’t tell you how many times I wanted him dead or how many times I wished for him to get in an accident and slowly bleed or suffocate to death,” I said. “There are things you don’t know, grandfather.” 
  

  
“I’m afraid I know what you’re talking about, son. I didn’t want to intervene, but I can do so now,” he sighed.
  

  
I don’t know why I called him like that— probably because I never had any actual father figure in my life. He liked it because his face lit up and he stroked my hair. He said he’d come to check on mother right away and be back in the afternoon with deer stew and cooked mushrooms. He said he knew what needed to be done and that the process would be ugly.
  

  
Mother was still sleeping when we came back. When she woke up, she said to leave them alone so they could talk, but Janosz insisted I should stay.
  

  

  
“I like my grandchild very much, Marieta. He seems like a brave young man with a strong mind and an immaculate soul. I want him to help me with this endeavor. Do you want to, Vlad?” he asked me.
  

  
“There’s nothing I would like more than helping you kill the monster for the second time, Janosz. I’m not afraid. I’m not like him, a failure, a crook, a violent man. I want only what’s best for my mother,” I replied.
  

  
“See, Marieta? He’s just like me,” Janosz said. He glanced at me and smiled. “You’re going to do great in life, son.”
  

  
“Father, I don’t think that’s a good idea. He’s only a child, after all,” she whimpered. 
  

  
“I know. But he wants to be there, and I want him to be there. His strong determination would help immensely in stopping this cancer, this pestilence, this ravenous curse that started eating at you last night. He needs you alive so you can raise him. And when you get old, he’ll be the one to take care of you, alright?” Janosz replied, grabbing mother’s hand and caressing it.
  

  
Janosz said that we couldn’t involve the village priest because he would be legally obliged to alert the authorities, and that was something no one wanted. He went on to say that this needed to be done the old way. Only a handful of people knew how to do this.
  

  
He would go to some of his old friends and tell them about this and in the afternoon he’d be back with food and a plan. He was adamant that my mother would be healthy again and the strigoi gone. 
  

  
Janosz told me we had to start at midnight so my mother’s condition wouldn’t deteriorate.
  
 
  
I showed him the dead animals, and before he left, gathered them in a pile and set them on fire. He said that was the sign of the strigoi; he left his mark on our house and poisoned the ground with those dead animals. So we had to burn them. The smell of sizzling flesh and feathers made me sick to the stomach, and the heavy, dense smoke filled my lungs with dread and cadaverous horror.
  

  
We gathered the ashes, poured holy water over them, and buried them in the small woods behind my house. Janosz firmly shook my hand, thanked me for helping him, and said he’d return around 4 pm. He instructed me to take care of my mother as best I could.
  

  
So I did. Until he returned, I changed her bedding and clothes, made her tea, gave her some of that delicious soup she had made, and told her everything would be fine. The hours came and went. I was focused on the task at hand, having only one thought: my mother would survive and be healthy again.
  

  
Besides the obvious thing that worried me — my dad coming back from the grave to haunt my mom and possibly me— another thought came into view. What was Madam Cerban’s involvement in this?
  

  
She was there from the beginning. She was on the side of the road, saying father didn’t die a good death. Was she the one who facilitated his end? Was this some sort of experiment she did to see if she could control the strigoi and possibly make more and control them to do her bidding?
  

  
“Are you alright, sweetheart?” Mom said, barely opening her eyes. “Did you eat?”
  

  
“Yes, mother. I’m fine. Here, you should eat some more.” I gave her soup and bread and told her she needed it to regain her strength. She ate the remaining half bowl and went back to sleep. I rubbed her forehead with a clean cloth to wipe the sweat beads away.
  

  
I held my thought about the Madam Cerban theory in the back of my head and would ask Janosz when he’d come back for an opinion.
  

  
Janosz came back at 4 pm sharp, precisely as he said. He brought three men with him. All of them were respected people of the city. Their rough faces told me they had seen bad things over the years. He gave me the food, for which I thanked him.
  

  
“Vlad, come here. Let me introduce you to George, Nicu, and Marin. They will help us with what we need to do. We’ll stand guard here at your house tonight to see if the strigoi comes again.
  

  
I nodded. 
  

  
“Janosz, can I ask you something?” I said, raising my eyebrows.
  

  
“Yes, of course, child. What is it? I see something else’s troubling you.”
  

  
I told him what I thought about Madam Cerban. All that happened since she was there on the side of the road when my drunk father died. What she said, what she looked like when I met her in the fog, the pig-shaped body, her black abyssal eyes, the worms that fell from her mouth, the smoke that flew out her throat and into the sky. The murder of crows that circled over my house, the nightmare I had, the tapping and scratching at my window, and the silhouette I saw outside the house. 
  

  
Janosz turned to the three men whose faces were now as white as snow. They said they only heard stories about Madam Cerban and were always suspicious about what she did inside her house, but they never heard about something like this.
  

  
They spoke between them, confused but eager to find out the truth.
  

  
“What if we break into her house at night and see if we find something?” Janosz asked. “I don’t know why, but I trust this kid. He’s my blood, after all.” 
  

  
“I think I know someone who can help us with information about her,” Marin said. “Elizabeta.”
  

  
Silence in the room. No one had ever dared to talk about that woman. She was 104 years old at that time. She lived alone in a small hut atop the hill. People would go and talk to her if they had problems. Janosz said he went to her after his wife's death because he didn’t have where else to go, but she was sick then, and they never got around to seeing or talking again. She did tell him to come back, but she never did. 
  

  
“I guess it’s time for me to go there right now, isn’t it? I haven’t seen her since I was a little boy,” Janosz said. 
  

  
“Can I come?” I asked. “She’s a living legend in my house. Mom told me lots of good things about her.”
  

  
Janosz told me it would be wiser to stay with mother and care for her if she needed it. The three men remained outside the porch to make sure nothing terrible happened. During the two hours he was gone, mother’s condition worsened. She kept whimpering and shuffled in the bed; cold shivers alternated with hot shivers. It was as if she was trapped in a never-ending nightmare from which she could not wake up.
  

  
I made her open her mouth to force-fed her and gave her tea to fight off the mental infection of the strigoi. Oh, how I wanted to be the one to rip out its heart and feed it to the dogs. I imagined myself doing that with a massive grin on my face, thankful to the gods that they provided me with the opportunity.
  

  
Before I knew it, two hours had passed, and Janosz was back. He seemed to have aged twenty years; his eyes were red as if he cried a lot and couldn’t stop.
  

  
“Are you alright, Janosz?” George asked.
  

  
“Yes, but I need to sit down and catch my breath. The information I received is a lot to take in. Some of it is personal, and I will share it only with Vlad and Marieta when the time comes. I only hope we’ll pull this through. We are men, and by God, we’ll kill that thing, one way or another,” he said. “Now, let me tell you what’s of interest for the task at hand.”
  

  
We all sat around the kitchen table as Janosz told us precisely what to do. And it wasn’t a beautiful thing, but it was necessary.
  

  
Elizabeta told Janosz what everyone already knew: Cerban was a witch who tried everything possible to communicate with the Devil. She was the one responsible for my father’s accident because he was an easy target and already a great candidate for becoming a strigoi. His heart was filled with hate, he was an evil, violent man, and he didn’t have respect for anything. He just wasted his days at the local bar, waiting for the end. The end came sooner, thanks to Madam Cerban’s witchery. 
  

  
She appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the road (just as she did with me) but was only visible to the horse. She controlled the horse and father’s fall, resulting in his violent death. A violent man’s life ending violently.
  

  
Madam Cerban killed in the name of the Devil, bringing him a sacrifice in flesh and blood. The devil didn’t want the deceased’s soul yet and let it roam free in the darkness of the night to claim more victims and strike fear in the soul of the innocent.
  

  
In addition, Elizabeta encouraged Janosz to go after Madam Cerban at night when she was asleep. She gave Janosz a small bottle filled with a greenish-purple liquid that moved around in slow motion to drink in case any of us got hurt. She also gave us five silver crosses to ward off whatever evil we encountered. She told Janosz that she wanted to meet me as fast as possible because she liked hearing about brave children who wanted to fight off evil, protect their parents and their land.
  

  
I smiled at that.
  

  
Then, Janosz came to the gist of it. Cerban had a secret tunnel underneath her house that connected to the cemetery. She would sometimes steal bodies or remains and use them for food and other black magic. Elizabeta said that she had stopped her numerous times before, but as she got older, she also got weaker, and her powers weren’t as they used to be.
  

  
“Wow…,” I gasped. “This village is much more than meets the eye.”
  

  
“In these parts of the world, evil has many faces, son. And we need strong and smart men and women who can ward that evil off. Or else, it will eat away at our souls and minds, poisoning them until there is nothing left.”
  

  
Elizabeta said that we should try and take as many things as possible from the witch's house and bring them to her. She would probably be aware of our arrival and not risk getting caught, but she would leave traps behind. She also gave Janosz clear instructions on how to deal with the strigoi, what to say and do so that the curse was broken and mother could get better.
  

  
Janosz would need to place three leaves and an egg made by a black hen when the sun settles. That was customary for someone believed to be sick because of a strigoi.
  
Night came, and with it, an all too familiar silence. I thought it was calm before the storm, but I hoped my mom would be healthy again.
  

  
“Gentlemen, we’ll stay here until midnight and see if the strigoi comes again. If all is good, we will go to the witch’s house, down through the tunnel, and into the cemetery,” Janosz said. “Vlad, you and I are born on a Saturday. It means we can see the spirit when it comes. You’ve seen it last night, even if only for a second, but you’ve seen its ugly face.”
  

  
I nodded. The drops of time fell in the hourglass of my heart, and midnight came.
  

  
A glass broke—a heavy thud in the bedroom. 
  

  
“He’s here,” I whispered. 
  

  
I saw its bluish-white face with red eyes studying me. It hissed, hunched, and wagged its tail like a dog from hell. He jumped all over the house like a headless chicken.
  

  
“Janosz, do you see it?” I cried.
  

  
“Yes!” he replied.
  

  
“Stop it, you’re killing me! Get off me!” mom said.  The strigoi was on top of her, his mouth connecting with her jugular. For a few seconds, it drank my mom’s blood.
  

  
Janosz screamed some words that I assumed he knew from Elizabeta.
  

  
“Strigoi, be gone
  

  
I’ll splash you with wine
  

  
I’ll smoke you with basil
  

  
I’ll burn incense inside your mouth
  

  
Your heart, I’ll take!
  

  
Upon hearing these words, the strigoi cringed, hunched forward, and vanished in the night, jumping right outside the same window he came through.
  

  
Mom panted and screamed.
  

  
“If he comes one more time, I will die. I can’t take this any longer,” she said.
  

  
The three men looked at Janosz as if he was their lieutenant who led the final assault against the citadel of evil.
  

  
Nicu ran back home and got his wife to stay with my mom and take care of her until we returned. Or until we didn’t.
  

  
We walked in a line to Madam Cerban’s house. I felt as if the house had one thousand eyes set on us and ready for the kill.
