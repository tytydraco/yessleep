The things I've seen, God damn. My morning today began with a cold splash of water to the face. I bolted upright, gasping to see Erickson standing in my room with some security.



“Good morning, Gus, I hope you slept well.”





I had especially since we'd spent the last few nights before then outside, but I chose not to comment on that.





“Where’s Drake?” I inquired.



“All in due time, my friend. I can assure you he is doing fine. Now, I'm sure you must be famished.”





Erickson snapped his fingers and someone stepped forward, extending what appeared to be a chocolate protein shake, an apple, a banana, and a strawberry multigrain bar. I stared at both hesitantly.





“Come, now, do you think I would go through all this trouble just to poison you here? I'm more creative than that.”



“What are you planning on doing with us then?”





All I received in return was a knowing smile. I took the food and then Erickson and the others left. The first bite I took broke the dam on my hunger. I scarfed down the rest of it, chasing it with the protein shake. As soon as I finished, the door opened again.





“Did you enjoy your breakfast?” Erickson asked.



“Yeah, it was alright, I guess.”





Erickson stared at me, smiling.





“Is something supposed to happen?” I asked after several moments of awkward silence.





His expression faltered and he turned to one of the guards.





“You did remember to drug his food, correct?”



“Yes sir, I made sure of it.”



“What pills did you use?”





The guard thought for a moment.





“The white flat round ones, sir.”



“You, idiot,” Erickson snapped, chastizing him, “those were the caffeine pills.”





He let out a sigh of annoyance.





“Knock him out again,” he ordered with a dismissive hand wave.





Once again, my face got acquainted with the butt of a rifle. This time I woke up in a dimly lit room. The first thing I noticed when my vision cleared was the reflection of flurocensent lights on the floor. The second was Drake picking himself up.  He ran over, helping me up.





“Gus, are you okay?”



“I’ve been better. What about you?”



“They drugged me.”



“Same, except they gave me the wrong thing and then hit me in the face again.”



“Damn, that sucks, man.”



“It’s about to get worse,” Erickson interrupted from behind, making us jump.





We whirled around to find Erickson standing behind what we originally thought to be a mirror. In front of him was a control panel. With him was Schneider and the woman who looked like Hilary Clinton.  





“Apologies for not bringing you here last night. This took more time to set up than we planned,”



“That’s it,” Drake said, raising his voice. “Why don’t you quit jerking us around?”



“Drake, such vulgar language, but if you insist. All questions shall be answered.”





He explained what happened to him following his arrest two years ago. 





“To think, me the genius would have to spend half a year in that filthy penitentiary. They even took away my beloved.”





My empathy goes out to whoever had to share a cell with that man.





“How did you escape?” I asked.



“I can answer that,” Schneider replied. “You see, Erickson and I used to be college roommates.”



“Was he a fucking nut back then too?” Drake interrupted.





Erickson shot him a glare as Schneider went on, ignoring the interjection.





“Even back then, it was clear his intelligence far exceeded that of his peers which is why I’ve been funding his research. When I heard of his arrest, I came to visit him in prison. There, we set this all up and the first step was me becoming mayor of your town.”



“Wait, that doesn’t make any sense,” I said. “How did you know which town we were living in?”



“There’s a saying,” Erickson told me. “It’s not what you know. It’s who you know. I think that’s incorrect. The real saying should be it’s what and who you know.  My web of connections runs deep.”



“That’s right,” Schneider said. “My father is a powerful man and it didn’t take long to track you down. After that, it was only a matter of time to put this all in motion, Where we are now was intended to work as a system of bunkers during the Cold War and we’ve expanded it.”



“Okay, well, what about her?” Drake asked, pointing to the woman who looked like Hilary Clinton. 





There was a glint of greed in her eyes as her lips curved upward.





“My name is Karen McConnell and I'm the owner of your neighborhood,” she said, even sounding similar to Clinton.



“Hold the phone,” I said. “You're the one in charge of our apartment?”



“That's right.”



“Do you know how much shit we've had to deal with? Leaks from the fridge and dishwasher, the AC and heat not working, mold in the walls, and roaches everywhere.”





She appeared bored by my words and that further infuriated me.





“Where the Hell do you get off charging people that much for rent?” I screamed at her.



“Well, Erickson needs a lot of funds for his projects.”



“Excuse me?”



“Why do you think I kept raising the rent and never fixing anything?”





The implication of those words shocked us to our core.





“You mean you've been using our money to pay for this?” I said.



“And for what will happen to you next. Erickson here has promised the mayor and I that what we put in will be repaid tripled.”



“You are a special kind of bitch. You know that?” Drake told her.





Her grin increased.





“Tell me something I don't know. Now then, Erickson, if you would be so kind.”



“With pleasure.”





He pressed a button, resulting in the wall behind us rising. In its place was another window to a room akin to ours. Nobody in it noticed us, which made us infer that two-way glass was also being used for it. There were two people in the room, a man and who we guessed was his girlfriend or wife. A glass wall separated them that had a single door in the center.







“Erickson, what are you about to do?” I asked, not liking where this was going.



“Initially, I was going to have the reanimated rip you two apart. “



“Most people would call them zombies,” Drake said.



“Most people are morons. As I was saying, the more I thought about it, the more I realized such an end would be far too merciful for the likes of you. Before you is a preview of the torture two years in the making.”





Erickson hit a button. Green gas filled the area on the woman's side and we observed her beginning to convulse. The guy was pounding frantically against the glass and appeared to be shouting her name. Through the gas her silhouette was changing, becoming taller. Her arms were also growing, reaching disproportionate lengths compared to her body.





“It took us a while to perfect the formula,” Erickson explained. “The one used to contaminate the town’s water supply was a weaker version which is why it created less advanced variants of the reanimated such as the one you are seeing now.”





We could only watch in horrific disbelief at what transpired next.  The gas cleared. The woman before was now a monstrosity with pale skin as if she had just crawled out of her own grave. It was falling off in some places and squirming in others. Her hair had faded to whisps and her hands ended in claws.





She stared at the man, sizing up her meal. He stared back with a terror-stricken grief. The door between them opened. The woman came through it. Her movements were unnerving. 





Picture the way a gorilla moves except jittery. The guy backed away, shaking his head. The woman moved closer. He turned, dashing to the door that led out of the room in a futile escape attempt. Seeing how it was locked, though, he could only hit and claw at it.





 She spun him around, yelling in his face before picking him up and throwing him to the floor. She pounced on him and what followed was like seeing someone get put through a human-sized garbage disposal.  Flesh and bone were being shredded in seconds. All the while, the man’s mouth hung open in an agonized scream.  To make it even more fucked up, she was only attacking below his neck.





If she started by ripping open his head, he’d at least have already been dead before what was happening to him. Instead, he was forced to watch the person he once knew eat him out, and not in the good way. She was scarfing down his organs faster than a snake in a hen house. Soon, the guy’s shrieks faded into dying gurgles. At last, he was granted some mercy when she brought his face to hers, almost as if they were about to kiss.





Then she chomped her teeth into his skull, exploding it in a burst of bones, blood, and grey matter. The woman was looking around wildly. I knew she couldn’t see us and yet it almost felt as if she was somehow sensing our presence. Her eyes contained a chilling awareness. Erickosn’s cackling cut through our stunned silence





“Now you understand what’s in store for you,” he said.



“What happened to him is going to happen to us?” I replied.



“No, Gus, not what happened to him, but what has happened to her. You see, to enact my original revenge plan I need those that are reliable and strong.  These specimens are perfect for it, Not only are they physically capable, they’ll also be able to follow orders.”



“Wait, what do you mean by that?” Drake asked.



“Isn’t it obvious? The gas I used contains nanobots meant for rewiring the brain and making it susceptible to my directives.  The mind, however, is still intact.”



“So that means….”





My voice trailed off as the statement settled over us like a blanket of ice.





“That’s right. You’ll be passengers in your own bodies as it tears apart the people you care about. Once you are changed, it will be a simple matter to keep you here and track them down. Then, well, let’s just what you witnessed mere moments ago will be child’s play in comparison.”





We looked back at the woman who now sat subdued with her arms wrapped around her knees in the red puddle that used to be her lover.





“You know, in a way, I must thank you,” Erickson told us. “If not for what happened at the hospital, none of this would have happened and I wouldn’t be any closer to completing my revenge.”



“You could thank us by letting us go,” Drake suggested.



“Yeah, and we promise not to tell anyone anything,” I added.





Erickson let out another sigh. This time it was the one of someone with their hands tied.





“I’m afraid I can’t do that, not after what you did to her.”





Erickson helped up the container with the severed head.





“Does that mean if we apologize we’ll be let go?” I asked.





He turned to the head, staring at a for a couple seconds. Drake and I exchanged a glance. 





“Very well,” he answered. 



“Yep, we’re sorry about that,” Drake said. “Really, we feel horrible about it.”



“We’d take it back if we could,” I told Erickson and the head. “We hope you’re doing better now.”





Erickson nodded thoughtfully.





“I must say, that was moving. What do you think, honey?”





As he was having another silent conversation, I wondered how Bill and Karen were keeping it together around him. My guess is if they didn’t, they’d end up in me and Drake’s position. He turned back to us.





“Good news, I am not going to kill you.”





It was as if someone threw us a life preserver…





“But I am still going to release the gas.”





With a grenade attached to it.





“You said you wouldn't kill us,” Drake yelled, accusingly.



“And I won't, but I never said anything about allowing you to live. Did I?”





He was about to hit the button that would fill our room with gas when suddenly the place shook.





“What in the world was that?” Bill demanded.



“Relax, it's probably nothing,” Erickson replied only for it to occur again. “Someone, bring up the outside cameras.”



“My God, they're at the entrances,” someone said.



“Erickson, what's the meaning of this?” Karen asked, now agitated 



“Would everyone keep your heads on? I assure you it's under control. I made sure to install a failsafe in case of scenarios such as this.”





Erickson started hitting more buttons on the panel. One, in particular, made a distinct noise. He looked at the zombified woman in the other room who was still sitting up. He hit the same button once more. Again, nothing changed. 





A bead of sweat trickled down his face. Things were not under control. Everyone was focusing on Erickson. He opened his mouth to say something and then shut it, repeating this action several times.





“Is there something you want to share with us?” Karen icily asked Erickson.



“Yes, I have thought up a brilliant new idea and that is for us to get the hell out of here.”





The ensuing panic was difficult to follow. People were fighting each other to get to the exit. The zombified woman bolted to her feet out of nowhere, lunging at the window, causing Me and Drake to yell in unison. Her fists were pounding at the glass.



“Does she know we're in here?” Drake asked in surprise.



“Even if she does, we should be alright,” I replied. “It's reinforced.”





A small crack in the center appeared. 





Note to self: “Learn when to keep your Goddamn mouth shut”.





As she went on, shards were breaking away. We were like a fish in a pond with a hungry cat staring at us. Then somehow in the commotion on Erickson's side, a switch was hit that opened the door leading out of our room. We rushed to it as the woman punched through. I risked a look back. Her eyes made contact with mine.





 It was the equivalent of blood in a shark-filled ocean. We ran out of the room, slamming the door behind us and locking it. We knew it wouldn't hold her long as we raced through the corridor. Erickson mentioned us being in a bunker so we needed to go up. We came to a pathway that split into three directions.





“Which way?” I asked.





Then we heard a rumbling which turned out to be a horde of zombies coming from the center and another coming from the right.





“Left it is,” I said.



We came to an elevator door and were frantically hitting the button to open it as the zombies were rapidly closing the gap. 





“Open, you piece of shit,” Drake screamed.





Finally, the light above us came on and the door slid open. We nearly tripped over each other getting into it. Then Drake hit the button.  The zombies reached the door right after it closed, making several dents in the metal. 





“Oh, fuck, that was close,” I said, leaning against the wall to catch my breath.  “This is insane. We don’t even have a plan to make it out of the woods if we even escape this place.”



“One thing at a time, man.”



“Yeah, I guess you’re right. I think as long as we can get a pair of wheels, we’ll be good.”





Erickson's voice sounded over the intercom.





“Attention personnel, due to circumstances outside my control which means one of you incompetent buffoons messed up, I was forced to activate the self-destruct sequence. Please make your way to the nearest exit within ten minutes.”



“You have go to be fucking kidding me,” I said with exasperation.





When I finished saying this, there was a noise from below us. It sounded like something climbing. The zombie woman’s clawed hand burst through the floor. We screamed as we came to a stop. We didn’t even wait for the door to open fully. 





We put our fingers in the crack, pushing it the rest of the way. The floor we ended up on contained numerous armed personnel who were surprised to see two escapees. They forgot about us when they saw what was on our tail. Someone yelled fire and we hit the floor right before bullets began flying. The good news was her attention was no longer on us. 





The bad news is the guards didn’t stand a chance against her.  She was tearing them apart left and right. All the while, we were crawling along the floor.  At one point, someone landed in front of us, well, the lower half of them anyway. Seeing the car keys on their belt, we snatched them up.







Then we fished through their pockets, pulling out a key card. We also got some guns off the people who fell victim. Although, if what was happening was any indicator, they may as well have been paperweights. We were about to get out of dodge when we spotted a table that was stacked with briefcases. We didn't know what they contained.





However, seeing how important things are kept in briefcases we decided to grab some. At the very least, we could crack zombies across the face with them. We got out of there and into another hall.





“Where’s the damn exit?” I wondered aloud in frustration.



“Gus.”





Drake was pointing to a sign labeled “Exit” with an arrow underneath it.





“Oh, I guess we should go that way.”



“How much time do we have left?” Drake asked as we were moving.





Checking my phone showed we only had four minutes left from Erickson's announcement. If the self-destruct was going to unfold how we thought, not only did we need to go outside, we also had to be a safe distance away. The Exit door was our light at the end of the tunnel. Bursting through it, we tasted fresh air. Drake hit the button on the keys and we heard a beep nearby. 





The keys were to an SUV that we used to make our escape. We got in and sped away. Other vehicles were on the road with us. One of them had Erickson, Karen, and Bill as passengers. The SUV we were in had tinted windows. 





That meant nobody could tell who was in it. That gave us the opportunity for a little payback. Drake signaled to me. We grabbed our guns and rolled down our windows. Drake hit the gas and as we were passing by, we shot out their tires and flipped them off. 





I wish I could have taken a picture of their faces because they were priceless. After everything they put us through, that was like water at the finish of a marathon. We drove past them and on the path going to a main road. Then we watched what happened to them in the rearview.  While their vehicle wasn't consumed by the explosion, the shock of it did send it upward.





“Holy shit,” I said, watching it fly through the air before falling into a lake.





The bumper stayed above the surface for a few seconds before sinking along with the rest of the car. We had to stop again, simply to process everything. Luckily, Erickson had the foresight to have a lot of the trees around the area removed to mitigate the risk of wildfire. That said, it was burning bright. In the flames, humanoid shapes were running around.





They didn't get far before collapsing. Whether they were human or zombie, I don't want to know. Without another word, we got back in the SUV and drove off. Down the road, it occurred to me to check what was in the briefcases. There was no combination on it so I undid the latches and lifted it. 





What was inside of it made my heart stop. For once, I mean that in a good way.





“Drake,” I said, having to force out his name.





His reaction upon seeing what I had was to slam on the brakes. I nearly hit my head on the dashboard when he did, but I didn't care. We had two briefcases full of hundred-dollar bills. Presumably, Erickson would have used it to make a deal with someone. Too bad for them, it's ours now.





We didn't know how much money was in there, only that it was a lot.  





“Okay, we need a plan,” Drake said. “We can't be carrying all of this around in a vehicle we don't even own.”





He was right. If a cop pulled us over, it would be hard to explain ourselves. I remembered something then. Patting myself, I realized I still had my keys. I showed them to him and he grinned. Then we made our way to Walmart where my car was still parked.





“Hang on,” I said after we got out.



“What?”



“I figured, while we're here.”





I gestured to the store. Half an hour later, I was driving us along the highway with our new money buried under a pile of groceries. We drove about twelve hours before stopping at a hotel where we are currently. Drake was outside earlier, talking to his cousin. He cooked up some story about us being let go from our jobs and then our complex burning down.





His cousin told us he'd gladly take us in so long as we could pay for expenses. We don’t have any objections to that. As far as we can tell, it's better to keep our newfound wealth on the down low. We'll stay at Drake's cousin's place for a while and then get homes of our own. God damn, this week has been nuts. 





Speaking of, I hope what happened to Erickson was enough to put him down for good. Maybe we should put changing our names on our to-do list on the off chance it isn't. Oh well, that's something we can take care of at a later time. For now, it's been a long day and I am exhausted. If I have to post here again about some other horse shit, it'll be too soon.





This is Gus saying, have a [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) one, [everybody.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
