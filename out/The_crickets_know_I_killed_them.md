I'm a light sleeper. Even the faintest noise—an AC hum, a distant car honk—can keep me up. Tonight, it wasn’t something faint. It was something relentless. A cricket. No—crickets.

The chirping started as soon as I lay down. Sharp, insistent, like a taunt. I pulled my blanket tighter, hoping to drown it out, but the sound drilled into my skull. I turned, flipped my pillow, buried my head under it. Nothing worked. Three hours passed, and I hadn’t slept for even a second. The crickets had hijacked my night.

That’s when I snapped.

I grabbed my phone's flashlight and started my hunt. The noise was coming from inside my room and just outside it—mocking me, surrounding me. My search finally led me to one of the culprits. I didn’t hesitate. I killed it. And just like that, the other chirping stopped too. A little too quickly, a little too conveniently.

But I wasn’t fooled. I knew there was another one. Something bigger. Something still out there.

I stepped outside my room, searching the walls, the corners, the floor. Silence. The second cricket had vanished. I returned to my room, ready to collapse from exhaustion, when something caught my eye.

Near the door, where the first cricket had fallen, another one had appeared. Not just appeared—it was lifting the dead one up.

I froze.

Then I did what had to be done. I killed it too. And for a moment, I thought it was over.

But now, as I sit here, writing this on reddit as it bothers me, I stay wide awake, heart still pounding, the chirping has started again. First outside. Then inside. Then outside again. Every time I move, it shifts. It’s toying with me.

So I’ve done the only thing left to do. I’ve left my door open, the bodies of the fallen crickets still in view. If more come, I’ll be waiting.

But it's almost been an hour already and the chirping hasn’t stopped.  Yet I see no new crickets. 

The location of the sounds shifts moves when I shift. I step outside—silence. I step back in—there it is again. Like it’s circling me. Watching.  

I try to pinpoint the sound, standing at the edge of my bedroom, listening, barely breathing. It’s *right here*. Right at the threshold. But when I shine my torch, there’s nothing. Just the two dead crickets, still lying where I left them.  

And yet, the noise is louder than ever.  

I shut the door.  

The sound continues.  

And now, I swear, it’s coming from *inside the walls*, right where the door to my room is.  

Even when it's the last thing I want to do, I press my ear against the surface. The chirping feels closer, deeper, as if it’s tunneling through the structure of my house. My skin crawls. I take a step back.  

Do crickets have soul?

I tell myself I’m overreacting, that it’s just exhaustion messing with my head. But then I hear something else.  

A faint rustling.  

Not outside. Not in the room. But inside the wall.

I grab my phone's flashlight again, scanning every crack, every seam. My house is old. There are spaces things could crawl through, gaps in the baseboards, tiny entry points I’ve never thought twice about.  

Until now.  

I kneel by the wall and knock once.  

Silence.  

Then—three sharp chirps in response.  

I stumble back. My breath is ragged, my pulse hammering against my skull. I don’t know what’s worse—the sound itself, or the fact that it feels like an answer. 

The chirping swells, growing in intensity, no longer just a noise but a presence. It surrounds me. Presses against me.  

And then, for the first time tonight, I feel something I haven’t yet allowed myself to admit.  

I am not alone.  

And I don’t think I ever was. 

Do they know what I did?
