There’s a little hole in my head. A tiny pinprick of a thing, seated behind my left ear. I scratched myself a few weeks ago, and my finger came away wet and sticky. Obviously, this warranted exploration, so I did what anyone would do: I poked it. I gave the hole a soft jab with a campfire marshmallow skewer that still smelled a bit smokey. It alarmed me that it went in so smoothly, but damned if it didn’t feel as satisfying as scratching an itch.

I probably should have cleaned the skewer first.

 

I went to urgent care, and the nurse was a bit flippant about my complaint. She looked and told me “It’s a blemish, sure. But you definitely ain’t got a hole in your head.”

“I think I’d know the difference between a blemish and a hole in my skull.”

“I’m sure you would, WebMD. If there was a hole, there’d be something coming out of it. Your copay will be $75.”

 

A gentle headache became a splitting migraine over the next few days, and the ringing phone felt like it was bisecting my forehead.

“Yeah, what?” I mumbled as I answered.

“Yury, are you ok?” my mother said. “I haven’t heard from you in forever and I’m worried, babushka.”

“I’m fine, mom. Just a bit of a headache. Also, we literally talked two days ago.”

“Oh honey, you need to drink more water and get some rest. You’re always working so hard and I worry.”

“I’m a grown man, mother. Fucking hell, I don’t even work very hard, I bartend and go to community college.”

“Khvatit uzhe, a mama’s love is like armor. Keeps the poison out. And you *do* work hard, stop being so grumpy.”

“Mama’s love didn’t keep pappa home, did it?”

The intake of breath across the line felt like a scalpel.

“Mom, seriously, leave me alone for a goddamn day or two” I said, ending the call.

The pressure in my head retreated a bit, and I was able to fall asleep on the couch.

When I woke up, there was a crusty stain on my pillow that looked a bit like a miniature rotten egg yolk. It smelled like it too. The pain in my skull had brought backups, but duty called and it was nearly time to fire shots of shitty booze into the mouths of the local boys and girls.

After a shower and some baby aspirin (the adult kind upsets my stomach), I walked to the bar. The neon St. Pauli Girl sign was waving her tits at me with more than her usual enthusiasm, and the Maddox Batson barcore was making me wish the hole was bigger.

The night was a rerun of any other night there, but my patience had eloped with my energy by closing time. Last call was announced, and a guy in jeans and a white button-down walked up to the bar, half supporting, half dragging a girl in a teal tank top to the bar. “Two more shots!” he yelled with some weird timbre of triumph in his voice. “She’s *done,* buddy, it’s time to get her home.”

“Fuck off, she’s good to go dude” he said. “You’re fine, right Katie-bear?” he said as he bobbed her head back and forth in a parody of consent. I realized I knew this girl from the CC. We were in a micro-economics course together. She was a girl who thought being irritating was cute, but since she *was* pretty cute, it was sort of accepted. Normally I would have white-knighted this girl, half-way hoping she’d blow me in appreciation. But tonight I made a conscious choice to let the wolves eat. “My bad, broski, two more green tea shots, en route.”

White shirt guy shepherded her out the door, and I wondered if she would be a bit less talkative in class tomorrow. The pain in my head whistled out like steam from a kettle, and for the first time in a couple days I felt good.

But emptiness invites something to fill it, and as the scalding steam left, I could feel something cool and liquid seep in.
