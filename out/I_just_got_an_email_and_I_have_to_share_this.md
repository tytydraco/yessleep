So, I recently got one of those scam emails, you know, the classic "Nigerian Prince needs your help transferring millions of dollars" type. At first, I was laughing thinking it was the usual attempt to steal my credit card info.

But then I actually read it.

And now, I don’t know what the fuck is going on.

Am I being scammed? Is this some new advanced level of phishing? or, and this is what’s messing with me, is someone fucking with me?

I kinda want to reply just to see where this goes.

Here, I’ll just share the email with you all. Maybe you can make sense of this because I sure as hell can’t.

Subject: URGENT: YOUR HELP IS NEEDED TO RECEIVE $15,500,000 USD

Dear Friend,

I hope this email finds you in good health. I am Prince Adewale, the last surviving son of His Royal Majesty King Emmanuel III of Nigeria. Please, you have to help me. They have my family. They have us locked in some kind of warehouse. Before my father’s untimely passing, he entrusted me with a vast sum of FIFTEEN MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($15,500,000 USD), which is currently deposited in a secure bank here in Nigeria.

Due to political instability and government interference, I am unable to access this money without, I know this must sound like a joke to you, but my name is John. I used to live in the suburbs. But I was taken, an international partner who can safely receive it on my behalf.

This is where you come in, my dear and trusted friend. I have identified you as a person of integrity and goodwill, and I humbly seek your assistance in transferring this fortune to your bank account.

What You Must Do:

1. Kindly provide your full name, home address, phone number, and bank details to facilitate the transfer.
2. Please contact the police. Whoever is holding us, they don’t seem to be planning to use us for ransom.
3. As a token of my gratitude, you will receive 30% of the total amount ($4,650,000 USD) for your help.
4. Once I receive your details, my lawyer will handle all the necessary paperwork, and the money will be transferred to you within 48 hours.

This transaction is 100% risk-free and legal. God, we were 10 just yesterday. One of us actually succeeded in scamming someone. They dragged him away. That same night, they gave us meat. None of us ate it. But if this goes on longer… I don’t know, man. Please, you have to find a way. I have all necessary documents to prove ownership of the funds. However, due to banking regulations, a small processing fee of $250 is required upfront to complete the international wire transfer. This fee is fully refundable.

We need to finalize Time is of the essence. Whatever you do, DON’T REPLY. I don’t know if they’re watching. I’ve been testing things so far, and they haven’t noticed. So please. Don’t reply. this arrangement without delay.

May God bless you abundantly.

Best Regards,  
Prince Adewale
