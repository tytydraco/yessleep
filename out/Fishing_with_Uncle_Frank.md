Fishing with Uncle Frank was always an event. The man knew every lake, river, and backwoods creek for miles, and he told stories that made you believe he’d fished them all since time began. But that trip to Blackwater Lake—our last fishing trip—was one I'll never forget.

It started early, way before the sun even hinted at rising. Uncle Frank picked me up in his old Ford truck, its headlights barely cutting through the dense fog rolling off the hills. I’d heard of Blackwater Lake before—everyone in town had—but no one talked about it in any detail. The stories were vague: whispered warnings, rumors of disappearances, and a tale or two about the lake being cursed. Uncle Frank just laughed when I brought it up.

“Curses don’t catch fish, kid. And Blackwater’s got the biggest bass in the county,” he said, flashing that grin of his that always seemed a little too wide.

The road to the lake was rough, overgrown with weeds and potholes that rattled your bones when you hit them. By the time we arrived, the fog was so thick it seemed to swallow everything beyond a few feet. I couldn’t even see the lake’s surface, but I could hear it—the faint lap of water against the shore, rhythmic and hollow, like something breathing.

Uncle Frank didn’t seem bothered. He grabbed the cooler, our rods, and the tackle box and motioned for me to follow. “Come on, let’s get out there before the fish wake up.”

We pushed a rickety old rowboat into the water and climbed in. The lake smelled off, like mud and something metallic, and the further we rowed, the quieter the world became. No birds, no insects, nothing but the creak of the oars and the occasional splash as something unseen moved beneath the surface.

About halfway across, Uncle Frank stopped rowing and stared at the water. “This is the spot,” he said, his voice low. I didn’t question him. He always knew where to find the best fishing holes, though something about the way he said it made the hair on my neck stand up.

We cast our lines and waited. The fog seemed thicker out here, clinging to my skin like damp cobwebs. Time dragged on, and not a single bite. Uncle Frank just sat there, motionless, staring at the water.

“You okay, Uncle Frank?” I asked.

He didn’t answer right away. Then, without looking at me, he said, “Did I ever tell you about my first time out here?”

I shook my head.

“Caught the biggest bass of my life,” he said, but there was no pride in his voice, just something cold and flat. “Thing was nearly three feet long, strong enough to snap my line if I wasn’t careful. Fought me for a good twenty minutes before I got it into the boat.”

He paused, his eyes still locked on the water.

“But when I looked closer, I noticed something. Its eyes… they weren’t right. Too big, too human. And its mouth—” He trailed off, shaking his head.

I laughed nervously. “You’re messing with me.”

He finally looked at me then, his face pale and serious. “You think I’m joking?”

Before I could respond, my line went taut. The rod bent sharply, and I nearly lost my grip. “Got one!” I shouted, adrenaline surging.

“Reel it in slow,” Uncle Frank said, but his voice wasn’t excited—it was tense, almost scared.

Whatever was on the other end of my line was strong, jerking and pulling like it was trying to drag me into the water. I reeled as hard as I could, my arms burning, until finally, something broke the surface.

At first, I thought it was a fish—a massive, black-scaled monster with jagged fins—but then I saw its face. It wasn’t a face at all, not one that should exist on this earth. Its eyes were milky white, too large for its head, and its mouth opened wide, revealing rows of needle-like teeth. It let out a sound, a horrible wet gurgle that made my stomach churn.

I screamed and dropped the rod.

The thing vanished beneath the water, and Uncle Frank grabbed my arm. “We’re leaving,” he said, his voice shaking.

I didn’t argue. He rowed us back to shore faster than I thought possible, his hands white-knuckled on the oars. The fog seemed to close in around us, and more than once, I thought I saw something moving just beneath the surface, keeping pace with us.

When we finally reached land, Uncle Frank didn’t say a word. He hauled the boat up, threw our gear into the truck, and started the engine. I didn’t ask questions.

As we drove away, I glanced back at the lake. Through the fog, I thought I saw something standing on the shore, watching us. It was tall, thin, and its glowing white eyes burned into my memory.

Uncle Frank never mentioned Blackwater Lake again, and neither did I. But sometimes, late at night, I dream about that thing in the water. And in those dreams, I’m back in the boat, my line going taut, and the fog closing in.

Only this time, I don’t make it back to shore.
