Back when I was a kid in the early 90's, I lived in a small, rural town in Southern Illinois, and there was one man who everybody in town knew; Uncle Rick, who I'll just call Rick for simplicity's sake.

Rick was a homeless man who we would pass around from house-to-house, letting him stay for a few nights before sending him off to the neighbors. Sometimes they'd say no, but certain families, like mine, never had the heart to.

Because of the town's size, and the sheer amount of people who wouldn't let Rick into their homes, I ended up seeing him quite a lot, so much so that I started calling him my Uncle, along with a few other families in the town.

For the most part, Rick was a very relaxed, but relatively distant man. He loved hunting and his books more than anything else, really.

He got along really well with my Dad because of this. The three of us would go hunting every weekend Rick was at the house, no matter what. It could've been hot enough to give you heatstroke or cold enough to make your fingers fall off. We didn't care. Rick especially didn't.

Every Saturday he was here, at 6:00 in the morning, on the dot, without fail, I'd be shaken awake by Rick, who was giggling like a kid who just got some candy. After that, we’d wake up my Dad in the exact same way.

Then, we'd drive to a nearby forest, which was about a 10 minute drive from our house, and Rick would sprint off into it, with no care for other hunters or anything like that.

Whenever he shot something, he'd cackle like a maniac. He'd cackle so loudly that you could probably hear it back at my house, scaring off whatever the sound of his rifle didn't.

Meanwhile, he felt like an entirely different person when he read. I can vividly remember one night, when Rick was reading in our living room, which he’d been doing for the past two hours, mind you, and I wanted to come in and watch Star Wars. My parents told me not to, but I thought Rick would be okay with it.

“Hey, Uncle Rick?”

He shut his book and inhaled slowly. “Yeah?”

“I... nevermind, actually.”

“No, no, what did you want?” He said as he got up, towering over me.

“I... I just wanted to watch TV for a bit.” I answered as I raised my right hand, which was holding the VHS tape for Star Wars: Episode IV.

He looked at the tape in my hand, grabbed it, threw it to the ground, and stomped on it.

“When I’m in here-- when I’m reading, don’t fucking interrupt me. *Okay?*”

I was still in shock from what had just happened, so I didn’t respond at first.

***“Okay?”*** He repeated, even more agitated than he was before.

“Okay.” I finally replied.

“Good... good.” He said, calmly. “Now get the hell out.”

After that, I slowly and shamefully walked away from the living room. When my parents asked about it, I just said that “Uncle Rick is reading right now.” and kept walking.

Rick had never acted out like that in front of me before, but considering the fact that my parents told me not to try talking with him, it definitely wasn’t the first time that happened.

Later that night, I woke up to a loud bang in my house. A gunshot. After this, I could hear screaming from Rick, and when I came down, I saw my Dad beating him into the ground by my Mom’s body, which laid in a pool of blood. I couldn’t even process what I was looking at.

After that, my Dad drove me and my Mom to the hospital. We never came back to that house, and I never saw Rick again. My Mom was okay, thankfully, but Rick was declared dead the next day.

Five years later, my Dad told me what happened in the moments leading up to that night. Apparently, Rick got a new book a week before the incident, and he started obsessing over it. Then, in the middle of the night, Rick came into my parents bedroom with a hunting rifle, and shot my Mom in the stomach.

My Dad, who had been making a midnight snack in the kitchen, immediately ran to the bedroom, and started beating up Rick, wrestling the gun out of his hands and repeatedly throwing him against the floor.

Then, my Dad told me about what I've been thinking about a lot for the past few weeks.

My Mom was pregnant when Rick shot her. They didn't tell me because they wanted it to be a surprise, but the surprise never came. I still blame that damn book.
