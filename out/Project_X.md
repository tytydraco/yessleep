“Alright, you’re on your own now. Good luck and I don’t need to remind you of the protocol if you’re compromised.”

I nodded as I tightened my respirator and began walking towards the lift. As the heavy steel doors closed behind me, the gravity of it started to sink in. The past 6 months of intensive training just for today. And all could be ended for naught in an instant. 

It still felt like it was yesterday when I was pulled out of field duty for the opportunity to be involved in a special project. Details were close to non-existent at the time and all I was told was that I was a suitable candidate. No family and a limited social network, sociopath tendencies that made me a perfect fit for doing the country’s dirty work. 

The hellish training was unlike anything I had experienced before in my years of service. Nothing remotely physical but day after day of breathing techniques and building up of resistance to various torture methods that made my POW training seem like child’s play. I was waterboarded, electrocuted, injected with increasing dosages of hallucinogens along with other forms of mental torture with the sole aim of having me keep my focus throughout. One would have thought they were going to be dropped into a North Korean labour camp.

And yet, the truth and the horrors of it were no further from home itself. Such was the nature of the project that I only received my first actual briefing less than 72 hours ago after I was flown to the site, sedated no less. The objective was simple, but its simplicity and vagueness hinted at the fate of those who went before me. To initiate contact and interact with whatever lay in that underground facility and return, alive.

It had been decades since it was first discovered, and we were no closer to unearthing more details about its origins. All hell broke loose when we awoke it from its hibernation. Scant notes from those around it before their gory deaths along with plenty of guess work had allowed us to achieve a delicate but stable present situation along with deductive rules on its exact nature. 

“It supposedly morphs into what you fear most.” He paused before playing a video on screen. Itwas unlike anything I’ve seen before. Soldiers panicking and pleading for help before going berserk and clawing their eyes out all while the mysterious humanoid watched from its cell. 

“How many have gone down and survived?”

“Well, it depends on what you define as survived. We currently have a directive in place to spare anyone from unnecessary suffering. If we determine you’re compromised, a nerve gas capsule will open and flood your respirator.” 

I doubt my stoic expression changed one bit, but the momentary pause might have given myself away.
“I know what you’re thinking but those above us believe that its unique abilities can be weaponized. The first step of course, would be to have someone who can survive being around it.”

As the lift descended, I couldn’t help but wonder about the sheer insanity of this project and what was most certainly a countless loss of life for an objective with no discernible timeline.

The lift doors opened, and I started my countdown timer of 2 minutes, pacing my breaths as I walked down the hallway. 

“Your heart rate is good. Breath counts looking good.”
Nothing could have prepared me for this as I passed the bodies strewn across the floor towards the cell. I couldn’t help but notice that many were seemingly spending their last moments desperately trying to remove their respirators. 

And there it stood, with nothing for a face but staring at me all the same from its cell. As it spoke, its cold and eerily sinister voice seemed to resonate from within my head.

“You think all that training will keep you safe?” I could feel my heart rate starting to race as I tried to take it all in and make sense of it while focusing on simple singular thoughts to keep my mind as empty as possible. Yet, I could also feel an inkling of a morbid curiosity on what form it would take.

“Who and what exactly are you and where are you from?”

“Does it matter? Look around you, is it me that you should really be afraid of?”

I couldn’t help but sneak a peek once more at the bodies around with a hint of uncertainty creeping up at the back of my head. And at the same time, my head felt increasingly heavier as it seemed harder for me to keep my focus. 

“I tried to warn them. Once the timer hits, you won’t even have time to take it off.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Oh, I’m sure you know. Do you really think it was me who did all of that? From within this cell?”

I looked at my countdown timer. It was 30 seconds to go, and I was still alive against all odds. I slowly backed away to return to the elevator. 

“Ignore him, he’s trying to get into your head! You’re doing well, continue the interaction till the time is up.”
I saw it starting to pace its cell with what should have been a face coldly fixated at me.

“Seems like they want you here still.” For once its voice carried a tinge of emotion, a barely disguised chuckle.
“You’re going to be just another dead experiment to them.” 

20 seconds to go.

I took a look at the corpses that lined the hallway once again. What if it was right? What if I was just a guinea pig for something which I was unknowingly a part of?
“Why not see for yourself? You don’t have anything to lose.”

I found myself starting to fiddle with the respirator while I saw the timer countdown to the final seconds.

“Do not take the damn respirator off! I repeat, do not take it off! Head back to the elevator!”

As my fingers tapped against the seal of the respirator, I wondered, “Should I?”
