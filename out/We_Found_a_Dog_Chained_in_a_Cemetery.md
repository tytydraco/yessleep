This happened three months ago, a couple of nights after my fiancé Dustin proposed to me. We were snuggled on the couch with a VCR setup, watching old tapes. Our house was on a corner lot, and across the road was an Anglican church with a small, unfenced cemetery and a rusted swing-set.


Around half-past 10:00 PM, we were interrupted by a dog barking hysterically—a squeaky yip-yip bark. Normally, I would have ignored it; I’d lived in dog-friendly neighborhoods where one bark set off six. But Dustin and I were planning to adopt a kid within the year and couldn’t afford to lose sleep.


I stepped outside; the cold nipped at my skin, and my breath spilled out in ragged clouds. Mayfield was particularly icy that season, and I didn’t want to be outside for long. It went dead silent—not even a car passing by. The kind of quiet that pressed against your ears.


That’s when the howling started again. First a yelp, then a sharp series of bark-bark-bark-bark, like two dogs fighting for the last bite of food.


Dustin had stepped out onto the front porch. “It’s over there, in the cemetery.”


Now, I love the man, but he has a bad habit of sending me into trouble because I’m a big guy with a beard. I’d never even been in a fight. Still, I jogged across the road.


The rusted chains of the swing creaked in the wind, and beneath them, a small, shivering chihuahua was chained to one of the posts.


I knelt down and offered my hand. “Hey, buddy. Where’s your owner?”


The chihuahua lowered its head and sniffed my hand, seeming to calm down.


“You’re not so bad, are you?”


Then I heard something behind me, like someone walking through the leaves. When I turned, something ducked behind a gravestone. Only a pair of eyes peered over the top, staring at me.


For a moment I stood frozen—looking at the figure, it looking at me, and the dog pulling against the chain and whining madly. The figure then rose to his feet and started taking several steps toward me. His face and nude body were painted black, as if he’d rubbed on charcoal from a campfire, and there was a large gash from his right collarbone down to his left nipple. In his hand, he held a serrated steak knife.


Dustin must have heard the commotion and was walking over to join me.


“Go back—get back inside,” I yelled at him. “Call the police.”


“Why? Is it a big dog?”


“Just call the fucking police.”


Dustin pulled out his cell and started dialing. I tried to back away from the man, keeping my eyes on him. I took slow steps back; he mimicked me, carefully stepping closer and closer. I readied myself to fight—he was a scrawny man, and I had size on my side. The police would take at least ten minutes to get here. The chihuahua belted out bark after bark.


The man was about 10 meters away—and then suddenly he was sprinting. I heard it before I saw him, the harsh puffs of his breath. I ran too, yelling at Dustin, who was still dawdling outside. The man was catching up—and not just that, he was passing me. He was trying to cut me off and beat me to the door.


Dustin's eyes went wide as he staggered inside—the door slammed shut behind him. My heart hammered as I raced down the side of the house. We always locked the patio door, but I prayed Dustin had the same idea as I did.


The man leaped over the porch railing, mere meters behind. I rounded the corner—and there was Dustin, standing at the patio door.


“Oh my god—Jason, Jason!” he yelled, grabbing my arm and hauling me inside, sliding the door shut. There was a thud as the man banged into the glass. We both backed up.


Dustin was yelling into the phone, “He’s trying to get in our house NOW. Tell them to hurry up!”


The man was just standing there on the other side of the glass, watching us. I noticed then that he had gnarly, twisted ears that, with his bald head, made him look like some sort of gangly orc. He took the steak knife and started sawing another sheet of flesh off his chest. I felt bile rise in my throat, and Dustin drew the curtains shut.


Part of me wanted to run, to put as much ground between me and that thing. But his feet disappeared from under the patio door curtains, and he could have been hiding anywhere. We checked our other windows—for a second I thought I saw light flit in our living room, like the curtains move, and then it was gone.


Dustin was by the front door. “They're here. I see them coming down our street now.”


“About time,” I said, joining him.


We greeted the cops at their car. I explained what had happened—how it started with the dog and why I was at the graveyard—however, they looked skeptical.


“Look, you two guys are,” said one of the officers, Harke, as he tilted his hand back and forth, “are you sure you don’t just... scare easy?”


“Certain.”


The officers walked around the side of the house and inspected the patio door, sliding it open and closed. Other than a slight smudge on the glass, all they found was some dirt on our hardwood floor. Harke studied the dirt closely.


“And the doors were locked?” he asked.


“Of course,” Dustin snapped. “Do you really think I wouldn’t lock the doors? Jason was outside too—his shoes are filthy.”


“Then you must have unlocked it after we got here; otherwise, how did we open it from the outside just now?”


“Yes… I… yes—I did.”



Officer Harke scribbled in his notebook.


I gestured toward the cemetery, inviting him to come with me. “Let me show you the dog.”


Just the two of us walked over, the wind building to a soft howl. The swing-set creaked in the dark. The chain lay loose on the ground, the manacle that had been around the dog’s neck tinged red—the poor thing must have ripped its head back through the hole. Harke knelt to inspect it, then turned his flashlight toward me.


“Okay, so there was a dog. But without a chip, it's unlikely we'll—” His flashlight flickered toward our house as he took a moment to scan behind me. “Unlikely we'll find anyone... I'm sorry—I don't recall you mentioning anyone else was in the house tonight.”


“That's right, it's only Dustin and I.”


Harke fumbled with the radio clipped to his belt. “Morgan, potential suspect on the second floor. Wait for me.”


We ran back over, and the officers did another walkthrough of the house. More muddy footprints were found upstairs—but the man was gone.


When I tell this story, Dustin swears he locked the patio door, but he turns away from me, frustrated we're lingering on the subject.
