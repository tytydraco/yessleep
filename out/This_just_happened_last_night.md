I was sitting on the couch, watching TV, like I do most nights. It was like ten o'clock, maybe later like ten fifteen or something.

Our house has a kind of funny set-up. When you walk in, you can see the entire kitchen, there's no door there even though there used to be one. On your left, you can see the living room. I should be clear, on the first floor the only doors are the front and the two side doors. You could literally run in a circle in the house. The thing is that there are only a few blind spots in the house from the living room. I could see up the stairs and the bathroom door, which was closed at the time. And my parent's room, which was also closed at the time. The only rooms I couldn't see up there were the two spare rooms.

My bedroom is in the basement. You go down the stairs and there's a door to a bigger room where we keep all of our junk and then on the right, is my room. That door is always closed unless I'm in there. From the couch, you can see the downstairs bathroom, that door is always open because it's also the laundry room.

So, anyway. I knew my mom and dad were asleep, I had gotten up some twenty minutes before to go to the bathroom and I closed the door.

The dog's bed is essentially in the middle of the living room. The two entrances to the living room, if you trace the ceiling and walls between the two, make an L shape. His bed is right below the TV. And when all of this occurred, I knew my parents were asleep because I could hear my dad's phone play the same video over and over again over the television.

Suddenly, the dog jumps up from the bed and runs. He jumps on the couch, stares at the bed, and barks. At first, I thought maybe the show I was watching scared him (it was Supernatural, and weird noises freak the dog out). But I realized at the moment this was happening, there were no strange noises on the TV. So, I called my dad.

This was very odd for the dog. He's kind of fearless when it comes to some things. So, when I called my dad after concluding that no noise could have set him off, I figured that it was a mole that had gotten in the house and scared him.

My dad moved the bed, we hit it with a stick and nothing. The dog wouldn't go near the bed. And we knew for a fact by this point that there was nothing there. So, my Dad goes back up to his room. And the dog takes the remote off the couch, and at first, I wasn't bothered by it, I told him to drop it.

I was only bothered by it when he growled at me. Like he was scared that he was going to get hurt. And we've never laid a hand on this dog in his entire life, he lives like a prince. And for the most part, he's a good dog. He likes to cuddle and hates being alone, he's always getting some form of love.

So, I went and got my dad again, and my dad let him outside to cool off thinking that maybe he just needed out. I take the time to really examine the bed again.

And as I'm looking at this bed, I have this epiphany, so I stand at the bottom of the stairs, then I walk into the living room and head toward the front door.

One corner of the bed is sticking out a bit. And I noticed that if you go in a straight line from that entrance to the living room to the front door, you have to step on the bed.

This wasn't the first time something similar to this happened. When the dog was a puppy, he was lying on one end of the couch and I was sitting on the other end. I was on my laptop doing something and I happened to look up. His eyes were glowing green, and I figured that it was just the light from the laptop reflecting in his eyes. I kind of thought he was looking right at me, so I just went back to what I was doing and after a minute or two, he laid his head down again.

And then after about ten minutes, he does it again. I thought we were making eye contact. But he was looking at something behind me. This was like a year ago, we'd just moved into the house a couple of weeks before. And there's this big bay window in the living room. The wall the couch leans against is on the right of that window. And there was at least a foot between the couch and the wall the window was in. And my dog was looking exactly at this wall.

And look, I'm not an idiot. I know that when a dog's eyes glow green like that, it's not a good thing. So, naturally, I turned my head. And there was absolutely nothing there.

And it's not like we're in the middle of nowhere. We live in a town, a street away from my grandparents. Last I checked, eleven thousand people were living in this town. And this house isn't new, if I had to take a guess, I'd say it was built in the '70s sometime. It's an old house, and as such, sometimes there are strange noises and I guess, occurrences.

So, I don't necessarily know what the fuck happened last night. I mentioned it to my aunt, she said to sage the house. I didn't tell my dad about the bed thing. Even though I know for a fact that something had to touch the bed or the dog, for that reaction to occur. And I could see him, there was nothing there.

I don't know if the stories people put on here are generally true or not. But I can assure you, this one is about as real as the existence of humanity. 

So, yeah. It happened.
