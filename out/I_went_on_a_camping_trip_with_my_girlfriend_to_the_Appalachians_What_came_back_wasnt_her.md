   
I gasped for breath as I stumbled through the forest, branches scratching my face and tearing at my clothes. My heart pounded in my chest, threatening to burst out of my ribcage at any moment. Behind me, I could hear her, or rather, the thing that had been posing as her - sprinting through the undergrowth with an inhuman speed and grace.

It had all started so innocently. My girlfriend and I had wanted to get away from the city and spend some time in nature, so we had planned a camping trip in the Appalachian Mountains. We had hiked for hours to reach a secluded spot deep in the woods, where we set up our tent and started a campfire. We talked, laughed, and shared stories under the starry sky, enjoying the peaceful solitude of the wilderness.

But then, something had changed. It was subtle at first, tiny details that didn't quite add up. The way she moved, the way she spoke, the way she looked at me with dark, uncanny eyes that seemed to reflect something other than human emotion. I had tried to brush it off, to convince myself that I was just being paranoid, but as the night wore on, the signs became more and more obvious.

And then, as we lay in our tent, she had shifted. Her bones cracked and twisted, her skin tearing and reforming into something that was no longer human. A skinwalker, a mimic, a creature that had taken on the form of my girlfriend to lure me in and devour me. It looked like a human stripped of their skin and flesh, leaving only the muscles, tendons, and bones visible with two empty eye sockets, two backward-bending appendages under its armpit.

I had barely managed to escape with my life. 

I had grabbed a knife beside the sleeping back and slashed at the creature, giving me enough time to scramble out of the tent and run blindly into the forest, freaking out and looking for an ecsape. Now, I was lost, alone, and terrified.

As I stumbled through the undergrowth, my mind raced with thoughts of what I had seen, what I had experienced. Was this real? Was I imagining things? Had I lost my fucking mind? But the sound of its paws pounding on the forest floor was all the confirmation I needed.

I had to find my real girlfriend. I had to get out of these woods.

I heard a twig snap behind me and my heart leaped into my throat. I didn't dare turn around, but I picked up my pace, running faster than I ever had before. My breath was ragged and my legs burned with exhaustion, but I pushed myself harder, willing myself to keep moving.

That's when it hit me.

Earlier that day, we were back at the car, with my real girlfriend, Aimes, when I left first to look for a camping spot. She hadn't followed me, but at some point what I thought was her stepped out into the trail, saying she had 'caught up' to me.

That fucking thing had stalked me from the beginning. 

Finally, after what felt like hours of running, I saw a light in the distance. It was faint, but it was enough to give me hope. I stumbled toward it, my heart pounding in my chest as I drew closer.

As I emerged from the woods, I saw her. My real girlfriend, in the parking lot and sitting in our sedan, looking up at me with a mixture of relief and confusion.

"Thank god," she said, running towards me. "I've been so worried. What happened to you? You've been gone for hours, I nearly called the police, you-"

I collapsed into her arms, tears streaming down my face. I tried to speak, to tell her what had happened, but my words came out in choked sobs. She held me, soothing me with gentle words and a warm embrace.

It took me hours to calm down as we sped out of there, to tell her everything that had happened. She listened patiently, her expression growing increasingly horrified as I recounted my encounter with the skinwalker. When I was finished, she hugged me again, her eyes full of understanding.

I nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. I was safe, for now. But I knew that the memory of the [skinwalker](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/105gy1c/the_arizona_skin_hunt_all_parts/) would haunt me for the rest of my days, something would always be watching from the woods.

It had been a few hours later, when I heard from a camping buddy that park rangers had discovered a skinned and utterly mutilated humanoid creature, exactly matching the description of what came after my girlfriend.
