  

On one of my nightly strolls, I saw something interesting. Usually, I walk the same route. After work, I change, grab my raycons, and take a leisurely 2-to-3-mile walk, depending on how I feel. It starts out in my neighborhood, a condo community that spans over a couple city blocks. There’s a nice park I cut through. It has a bridge that I take a moment to admire the river that runs through. More of a creek, but it’s still pretty. If I’m lucky I’ll catch a pair of swans or a mallard family, mom in front, several tiny babies trying their best to follow.

Before I exit the park, there’s a big open area on both sides of the walking path. On most days it’s filled with the normal park-going activity. Picnics, parents monitoring their children on the playground, baseballs or frisbees being thrown, and a handful of older folks watching the sun go down.

What caught my eye was a fairly large pink sign. Even as dusk set in, it was such a brilliant shade of pink, it radiated. From about 50 feet away it looked out of place. I certainly have never seen it before. Finally getting closer I can make out the cursive writing:

*Easter EGG-stravaganza*  
 *1st annual egg hunt, please bring your children for a day of family fun*  
 *Easter Bunny will be here!*

And then the requisite who/what/where/when details followed underneath. Well, that seems pretty nice actually. This park usually doesn’t do any events so it’s good for the community. Thinking nothing more of it, I finished my walk. Noting that not one other person was out that night.

It’s been a week since my last walk. Busy, busy, unfortunately. It’s Saturday night. Most people would be out having fun, or a nice dinner with their significant other. Me, I’m at work. Enough of that. I’m going for my walk. Beside, I can see if they set up for the Easter “Egg-stravaganza.” Easter is tomorrow after all.

Same process. Change, raycons in, setlist of creepy stories ready. What I saw again, was interesting.

When I got to the park, not much had changed. No people, which is odd. Especially for a Saturday night, and the same sign spouting tomorrow’s festivities. I can’t say why this gave me a weird feeling, I suppose I was expecting to see more things set up, booths, fenced off area for the egg hiding, something. Standing there for a while, I finally told myself to move on. Again, not sure why this seems odd to me, I ju—

(hears twig snapping)

What the hell was that?

I snapped my head back to where I thought the sound came from. I should have just left when I heard the branch breaking, or whatever it was. Walking into the tree line, where the forested part of the park begins, was a giant rabbit. I don’t mean an actual rabbit of course, clearly, it’s a person in a bunny costume. From where I stood, maybe 100 yards away, the upright walking rabbit must have been over 6 feet tall. It was just passed dusk, but the “fur,” was white. It was moving methodically as I froze in place watching. Then it turned, locking eyes with me like it knew EXACTLY where I was. 

I turned and kicked it out of there. Not running but walking very fast. I’m not too proud at all to admit that. I don’t want anything to do with the next killer clown fad of 2016, if that’s what this is. Except with people dressed as bunnies. 

The worst thing about that rabbit looking at me.. its eyes reflected, as if it were a real animal. It could of course be part of the mask. There could have been working lights underneath. I don’t know why, but it’s possible. Either way, I wasn’t waiting to ask.

All night I thought about this. Why hasn’t anyone been in the park the last two times I was there? Why is there just a sign in the middle of the park? There’s no trailers, no roped off area, no nothing. And last but not least, why the shit did I see a giant easter bunny walking into the woods? I’m not a detective, and usually run from any kind of danger. But this I was intrigued with. I had to figure out what the end of this story was going to be.

Sunday morning, 10am. I haven’t been to church in some time, but I assume in another hour most people will be exiting their places of worship, only to drag their screaming kids to hunt for plastic eggs that contain sugar, little toys, or even money. What a weird tradition linked to the day of Jesus’ reanimation.

I’m on my way to the park. Thank goodness, a huge breath of relief. It’s not busy yet, but children and their parents are trickling in. An area has been set up to take what I assume is pictures with the Easter Bunny. For right now I’m just going to wait and observe. Yes, I understand this might not look great, but I’ve dressed in my usual running gear, and I’m trying to look like I’m warming up for a run. I don’t know. Anything to not seem too out of place here.

In the middle of my warmup, there it is. I can’t believe what I’m seeing. The same man in a bunny outfit, about 50 yards from the children, hiding easter eggs. Do the kids not see that that thing is just blatantly placing their little plastic prizes down right now? Shouldn’t that have been done way ahead of time? Come to think of it, there doesn’t seem to be other employees around either. Maybe the parents showed up too early, and they weren’t ready to set up yet. But the parents aren’t really paying attention. Strangely.

It reminded me of a movie called “Harvey,” starring James Stewart. This imaginary bunny follows the main character around, and he’s the only one that can see him.

The bunny man gets closer. Now my skin is going cold. Could he possibly recognize me? It’s most likely a he now, the closer it gets. Broad shoulders, even under the outfit. Over 6 feet, I can clearly see now. The walk though… just seems off. Like an animatronic. One more thing I do not like is the suit itself. It’s dirty. There’s long dark spots staining the front. Like a car exhaust backfired onto it. And most bunny costumes have that hula hoop type thing inside to make the appearance of a bigger belly. Even though he had broad shoulders, I could tell he was very slight. Disturbingly so, even. The costume hung off of him. An emaciated rabbit is more sickening to see than I thought.

“Welcome!” I almost fell at the sound of the bullhorn. My earbuds were in, but not on, and it was still loud enough to give me a nice little jump scare. A man dressed casually in khakis and a pastel purple shirt was the voice behind the noise amplifier. He went on to say the festivities will begin shortly, get ready for the easter bunny, etc. A squeal erupted from the crowd of kids that had now grown to about 75 or so. Some parents clapped, some admonished their children for screaming so loud. I looked back to where the sickly easter bunny was. He was staring at me. We stood looking at each other for maybe 10 seconds, and then he slowly walked back to the woods. I had to ask the man behind the bullhorn about this.

I did my best to gain my composure. Taking a deep breath, I made my way towards him. “Um.. Hi, hello,” I said, trying to sound as normal as possible. He politely turned to me with a half-smile and his eyebrows raised. A “How may I help you,” kind of look.   
 “Yes, um, my kids are so excited for this egg hunt.” I figured I should throw in the farce of having children here to not set off any alarm bells.

“Aaaand, I just thought it was strange that you had the “Easter bunny,” hiding eggs while the children were here. Not a huge deal or anything but-“

The man’s head moved back slightly, pushing his chin into his neck. His face scrunched up in confusion. Laughing, he spoke. “Sir, we made sure to hide the eggs early this morning, when no one was around. We certainly wouldn’t have the easter bunny here in full view hiding eggs.”

That familiar feeling of my blood turning into ice slowly crept back in. I tried my best to keep my cool. “But I, I mean, clearly he was just here, I saw hi-“

Before I could finish my sentence, the man looked over to the chair and booth where the children would be taking pictures with the Easter bunny. A proper bunny costumed person come out from behind the curtain set up.

The man once again put the bullhorn to his mouth. This time when he used it, It sounded like he was speaking underwater.

“OH my GOODNESS, the Easter bunny is here kids! Parents, please line your children up. We will take pictures first and then can start the exciting egg hunt!”

I stood frozen, feeling like everything was moving in slow motion. The children ran up to the start of the que. Patient parents stood by, making sure the kids didn’t get too out of hand. As the first child got up to the Easter bunny, I hustled back over to the man I was speaking too. This time he seemed more annoyed as I gave him a gentle pat on the shoulder.

“Sir, look, I’m sorry to bother you again, but.. I’m just wondering why you would have two easter bunnies here.”

“We don’t HAVE two easter bunnies, ok. I don’t know what you are talking about, and frankly this is starting to sound a bit odd to me. Are you ok?”

I tried to say something, but my mouth had gone dry. I think I just moved my head up and down.

“Ok, well then line up with your children so we can get these pictures done.”

With that he went back into host mode, encouraging the kids to smile as the photographer took pictures. He made sure to remind them that the egg hunt would be full of fun prizes.

Thoroughly confused, I stepped away to get a view of the woods, to see if this now “imposter,” Easter doppelganger was still around. Just as I had, the fake bunny rabbit had just slipped into the woods.

I wiped a disturbing amount of sweat away from my forehead, for the first time realizing that I truly must appear to be a real piece of work. I turned to the poor organizer/MC to apologize for my strange behavior, but he was long gone directing children to the “start,” line where the happy chubby cheeked kids were ready to hunt for their precious treasure-filled eggs.

I’m too far in now. I followed the dirty rabbit into the woods. Wonder what those parents thought of some random guy walking through the park into the trees. Be very very quiet, I’m hunting rabbits. . .  As soon as I broke the threshold into the tree line, time and space appeared to stop. I’m being dramatic of course, but it was noticeably darker inside the woods. I’ve never walked through here. Why would I? There are no trails that I’m aware of, and I don’t make it a habit to—

(running sound)

What was that? I swear I just heard something running close to me. This can’t be happening. Quick look to my left and right reveals nothing. A twig breaking again snaps my focus dead ahead. Slowly, I soldier on. After a few minutes I’m getting worried. I expect to see this degenerate bunny impersonator holed up in a serial-killer looking shack. Silly, now that I think about it, I’m sure there’s no housing structures built inside of a small forest that’s also inside a major suburban area.

Before I know it, the forest clears, and I’m on the other side. I wasn’t there as long as I think, I imagine. Looking around and getting my thoughts straight, I know where I’m at. It’s a side of town I’m familiar with. Everyone here knows this place, it’s the “bad,” part of town. There’s no reason to be here. I avoid this area if at all poss—

There he is. Not staring at me this time. I just happened to catch his dirty cottontail shimmy into the apartments. Everyone knows these apartments. Sketchy tenants at best. Like I said, I’m in too deep now.

I quietly make my way to the side of the apartment. I only glimpsed a shadow going into the main door, and it appeared to make a right. No way I’d be able to see where he went, unless he left his blinds up. One window.. nothing. Next apartment window.. nothing. Maybe you should just call it a night. An intense rotting smell smacked me in the face that almost took me off my feet. I should have left.

I knew as soon as I saw it. A window with crusty newspaper covering it from the inside. But unfortunately there was a small piece near the bottom that was missing. I put my good eye up to it. Son of a bitch that’s him. All I can make out is a man, sitting at a folding table. His back to me. How could I tell it was him? He still had that stupid costume on, minus the bunny ears. The back of his head had patchy dark hair, and his neck was .. dirty. Just.. fear-inducing.

Realizing I was holding my breath I did my best to quietly exhale all the air I had. Which made the rabbit jerk his head to the left. Shit. I ducked. What I saw before I did haunts me. The best way I can describe what his side profile looked like was a methed out Voldemort. After being fairly sure I had not soiled myself, I slowly peeked again. He was gone. On the table… were eggs…. plastic easter eggs. . .  And next to those eggs…. Were parts. I hesitate to say what they were because it makes me want to vomit.

Eyes. Fingers. Nails. I think I saw a nose. They were small. Dear God, how many easter egg hunts are there today.
