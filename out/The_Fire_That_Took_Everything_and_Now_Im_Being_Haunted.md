I was at work when it all happened. I worked as a therapist, and my last session of the day went longer than I expected. So I had to stay late, typing the notes I took during the session into the patient file.

I finished typing and started packing up until my phone started ringing, taking it out of my pocket. I didn't even look at the caller ID before answering because I was tired and just wanted to get home to my loving wife, Hailey, and two kids, Thomas and Emily.

The voice on the phone sounded professional, with a bit of emotion, and I could also hear faint sirens in the background.

“Hello, is this David Cooper?” The voice asked.

“Uh, yes, this is David Cooper. Who’s this?”

There was a moment of silence before he spoke again.

“My name is Officer Ryan. The reason I’m calling is to inform you that your house caught fire.”

I didn’t even reply to Officer Ryan. After hearing your house caught fire, I hung up and immediately ran out of the building to my car and drove home like a bat out of hell.

I don’t even remember the drive home. I probably ran so many red lights and stop signs along the way. I do remember when I was getting close to the house, there was a massive cloud of black smoke, and once the house got into view, the flames were bright and high.

Pulling into the driveway, I immediately got out of my car and rushed to the nearest officer.

“WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?!” I shouted, shaking the officer. “DID ANYONE MAKE IT OUT OF THE HOUSE?!”

The officer grabbed my wrist and removed my hands from his shoulders before speaking.

“Sir, please calm down. I just got here,” he replied. “I haven’t been informed about anything besides the fire. If you have questions, see Officer Ryan. He was the first one on the scene. You can find him by the fire truck.”

He pointed to the closest truck to the house, and I could see one officer talking to the firefighters. I didn’t even thank the officer for the information because I only had one thing on my mind: did Hailey, Thomas, and Emily make it out of the house before it was too late?

I ran toward the fire truck so fast my legs nearly buckled beneath me, the heat from the flames hitting my face like a wall. Every step felt like it took an eternity, like time itself was fighting to keep me from reaching the truth. Officer Ryan turned as I approached, and the look in his eyes—God, I’ll never forget it—a mixture of dread and pity. The kind of look people give when they’re about to break you.

“Officer Ryan,” I gasped, barely able to breathe. “My family—my wife, my kids—did they make it? Tell me they made it.”

He shifted his weight, his jaw tightening. He wouldn’t look at me at first, choosing instead to glance toward the house as another section of the roof caved in with a deafening crash.

“Mr. Cooper…” He finally met my eyes. “The firefighters are still searching, but the fire spread incredibly fast. They said it was already fully involved when they arrived. They’re doing everything they can.”

That wasn’t an answer. That was a script—a shield.

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head violently. “No. Where the fuck are they? Where’s my wife? Where’s my kids?”

The world around me blurred. I could hear voices, commands being shouted, water spraying in heavy bursts, but it all felt distant, as if I were underwater. Then a firefighter approached—helmet off, face streaked with soot, eyes filled with the kind of sorrow that told me everything before he even opened his mouth.

“We found the source,” he said quietly, speaking to Ryan but glancing at me with a kind of reluctant compassion. “Looks like an electrical fire. Outlet in the living room—it sparked hard. Probably had been failing for a while.”

Something inside me cracked so violently I felt it in my chest.

That outlet.  
 The one Hailey mentioned two weeks ago.  
 The one I told her I’d fix over the weekend.  
 The weekend that never came because I was “too busy.”

The firefighter wasn’t done.

“It spread faster than usual,” he added. “They likely didn’t have much time to react before the smoke—”

My knees gave out. I hit the pavement hard, but I didn’t feel it. All I felt was this crushing weight pressing down on me, squeezing the air from my lungs. I hadn’t even been told they were gone—not officially—but at that moment, I knew. Some instinct deep in my bones screamed the truth.

I could’ve prevented this.  
I could’ve saved them.  
I could’ve been home.  
I could’ve listened.

The realization tore through me, leaving nothing in its wake.

I pressed my palms to my face, shaking uncontrollably as the fire raged on, consuming what used to be my home—our home—until there was nothing left but a skeleton of charred beams and memories.

And all I could think, over and over again, was that the last words I said to Hailey that morning were so ordinary, so painfully mundane. A rushed “Love you, I’ll see you tonight,” was said as I tied my shoes, not even looking up to see her smile.

I would never get another chance to see it again.



I don’t know how long I stayed kneeling there. Minutes? Hours? Time didn’t matter anymore. Nothing did.

At some point, a hand touched my shoulder. Gentle, hesitant. I lifted my head to see a firefighter kneeling beside me—someone younger, maybe mid-twenties. His face was ashen beneath the soot.

“Mr. Cooper…” His voice cracked a little. “We… we recovered three victims inside.”

My heart stopped. It physically stopped. I swear I felt it.

He continued slowly, carefully, like each word was a stone he had to carry.

“They were all together. Near the hall. Your wife had her arms around the children.”

A sound tore out of me—something primal, broken, not even human. I didn’t scream so much as collapse inward, folding in devastation so deep it felt like my ribs were cracking around it.

I wanted to run into the flames.  
I wanted to turn back time.  
I wanted to wake up, because this couldn’t be real.  
It couldn’t.

But the fire didn’t care. The world didn’t care. My family was gone.

I buried my face in my hands again, rocking as if motion might somehow keep me from shattering completely. But it didn’t. Nothing could.

They tried speaking to me—Ryan, the firefighters, the paramedics—but their voices blurred into background noise. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I sat there in the driveway, staring at the burning remains of my life as if the sheer force of my grief could drag them back through the rubble.

Eventually, the flames died down. The smoke thinned. The adrenaline began to drain out of me, leaving only a cold hollowness that settled deep in my bones.

Someone guided me to the back of an ambulance and wrapped a blanket around my shoulders. I didn’t remember moving. I didn’t remember sitting. I didn’t even feel the blanket.

All I felt was the crushing silence.

At some point, Officer Ryan returned, holding a clipboard, but he hesitated like he wasn’t sure if approaching me was the right thing to do. When he finally stepped closer, he exhaled slowly.

“Mr. Cooper,” he said gently, “I know this is… indescribable. But there’s something you should know.”

I blinked at him, numb.

“The fire marshal is already doing a preliminary investigation,” he continued. “The outlet that sparked… It looks like it had been damaged for a while. Loose wiring, heat scars, signs it had been shorting off and on.”

His voice softened even further.

“It wasn’t your fault.”

But it was.  
I knew it was.  
And nothing he said could rewrite that truth.

Hailey had mentioned the outlet was flickering. She’d said it felt warm sometimes, that it sparked when she plugged in the vacuum. I told her I’d fix it. I told her I’d get around to it. I even bought the damn replacement plate—but it was still sitting in the garage, unopened.

If I had just taken five minutes—just five—my family would still be alive.

I didn’t respond. He didn’t push.

A gurney rolled past as they moved bodies to the coroner’s van. I squeezed my eyes shut, but it didn’t stop the image. Three white sheets. Three zippered bags. Three people who would never laugh, cry, argue, or live again.

My wife.  
My son.  
My tiny, bright-eyed Emily, who still said “wuv” instead of “love.”

Gone.

When the coroner’s van finally drove away, taking everything I cared about with it, the emptiness inside me deepened into something darker, heavier.

The sun had already set by the time the street cleared. The firefighters left. The officers left. The curious neighbors who stood watching from back lawns and sidewalks drifted away, whispering pity like it was some offering.

And I stayed.

I sat alone on the curb across from the smoking ruin of my home, staring at the charred skeleton of what used to be my life. I didn’t know where to go. I didn’t know what to do. My hands shook so violently that I had to press them against my knees to keep them still.

Eventually, exhaustion won. I buried my face in my hands again and let the darkness swallow me whole.

It wasn’t sleep. It wasn’t rest.  
It was just the closest thing to escaping I had left.



It's been five years.  
Five long, merciless years… and yet every morning I still wake up choking on smoke that isn’t there.

Some nights, I swear I’m still standing in front of that burning house—knees in the gravel, lungs full of ash, screaming their names until my voice splits open. Other nights, I see Hailey in the hallway, reaching for me through the flames, lips forming words I’m too late to hear.

Time is supposed to dull the pain.  
But time has only sharpened it, carving the memory deeper into me like a blade.

I don’t know what day it is anymore. I don’t even know what month, what season. Life has become one long smear of empty hours—drinks to fall asleep, nightmares to wake me up. Sometimes I don’t know where I am until I see the inside of my car roof and remember I don’t have a home anymore. Not a real one.

The world keeps going—people laugh, work, love, complain about bills, and celebrate birthdays. But mine ended the night my family died. I didn’t have the decency to stop breathing with them.

They said the fire was an accident.  
They said it wasn’t my fault.  
They said there was nothing I could’ve done.

But they didn’t hear Hailey’s voice telling me about the outlet sparking.  
They didn’t see the flicker in the living room lights.  
They didn’t hear me say,  “I’ll fix it this weekend, babe. Don’t worry.”

God, I told her not to worry.

And now the only thing I have left of them is that smell.  
Burnt wood. Melted plastic. Smoke so thick you can taste it.  
It’s in my clothes, in my hair, in my memory—haunting me like a stain I can’t scrub out.

Some nights, when I lie in the back seat and stare at the ceiling, I swear I see their silhouettes in the windows—small handprints in the fog. A woman’s shadow turning toward me, waiting, accusing, grieving.

And I deserve it.  
Every whisper.  
Every nightmare.  
Every reminder.

Because I wasn’t there.  
Because I stayed late at work.  
Because I didn’t fix the goddamn outlet.

Five years and I’m still kneeling in front of the fire.

“I can remember it like it was yesterday—every vivid moment, every smell, every sound—all of it permanently fixed in my head.” I groaned, taking another burning shot of whiskey. The glass rattled when I set it down, like even it was tired of my hands shaking. 

“Dude, it’s been five years since the accident. When will you let the past be the past and move on?” Mason asked. His tone was flat—emptied from hearing this same confession too many times. His eyes didn’t even hold anger anymore—just dull exhaustion.

I poured two more shots, downed them both, and slammed the glass hard enough for the bartender to look over. “If you’re trying to cheer me up, you’re doing a fucken shit job at it,” I muttered. My throat burned. “I lost everything in that damn fire, Mason. Everything I cared about. My wife, Hailey… my kids, Thomas and Emily.”

Mason’s shoulders slumped. He turned toward me fully, pity softening his features. Pity. I hated that look more than the nightmares. “Come on, David,” he whispered. “Is this how they would’ve wanted you to live? A jobless drunk, sleeping in your car?”

“In these five years, have you even tried therapy, David?” he added

I stared at the sticky bar counter, watching the neon beer sign’s reflection ripple through spilled liquor. That warped glow looked more real to me than anything else in my life. “You think I don’t ask myself that every night?” I rebutted. “I also tried fucken therapy, did you forget I was a therapist? I tried every single fucken tip and trick I know, and nothing fucken worked, so why should I pay for another therapist to tell me everything I already know? They don’t make fucken therapists for other therapists.”

The bar hummed with low chatter and fake laughter—people pretending they didn’t feel alone. To me, it was all just static… ghosts pretending to be human.

“I’m trying to help you,” Mason insisted. “We’ve been friends since kindergarten. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for you.”

He stood, pulled out his wallet, and placed cash under his empty glass. Then he handed me two hundred-dollar bills.

“Use this wisely, man. Please. Don’t spend it on more alcohol or drugs.”

He gave my shoulder a gentle pat—a mercy I didn’t deserve—and left. I didn’t watch him go. I didn't need to. Everyone leaves eventually.



The rain was cold when I stepped out of the bar, the kind of cold that feels personal. It hissed on the pavement, soaking through my jacket in seconds. My car sat where it always did—alone under a dying streetlight that flickered like it was struggling to stay alive.

I climbed in. The door creaked. The stale mix of whiskey, sweat, and old guilt clung to the air. On the dashboard, the photo stared back at me. Hailey’s bright smile, Thomas’s missing front tooth, and Emily hugging her stuffed rabbit like the world couldn’t touch her.

I reached out, brushing my thumb over Hailey’s cheek. “I miss you,” I whispered. My voice cracked on the last word.

Something rustled in the back seat.

I turned sharply—just my blanket and a pile of clothes. Nothing there. Nothing real, anyway. I let out a shaky breath, a bitter laugh catching in my throat. “Too much whiskey again—”

Then I smelled it.

Burnt wood.

My heart froze. That smell… that goddamn smell. You never forget the scent of your life turning to ash.

It started that night as a whisper in my sleep.

“David…”

My eyes shot open. Sweat dripped down my neck. My temples pounded. The windows were fogged from the inside, the whole world outside swallowed in a blanket of pale, shifting mist.

I wiped the glass with my sleeve—then stopped breathing.

Because on the fogged window, written in shaky letters, were the words:

WHY DID YOU LEAVE US?

The words trickled downward like wet ash.

I stumbled out of the car, flashlight trembling in my hand. The lot was empty. Still. Quiet. But the fog moved like it had breath, curling around my legs, whispering between the parked cars.

Somewhere in the distance, I heard children laughing.

Not happy laughter. Something… wrong. Echoing where it shouldn’t.

When I climbed back inside, the photo was gone.

My chest tightened as I tore through the car—seat, floor, dashboard—but it had vanished. Completely.

Then, from behind me, so close it brushed the back of my neck, a small voice whispered:

“Daddy?”

I spun around. Nothing, but the air stank of burnt plastic.

I drove until the sun came up, because stopping meant facing whatever the hell was following me.
