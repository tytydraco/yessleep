Ah Jesus, alright, this is the damn story. First thing you need to understand is how much I love my girl, Emberlyn. End of the world and back dawg, no two, three, or even four ways about it. She’s 5’1” and 313 pounds of pure sex and uncut temptation. She’s hardier than the damn Hardy Boys and can nearly take me in a wrestling match (even though I’m a pretty big fella myself). I respect the shit out of that. Mix loin-pounding lust and heartfelt respect like that, you got the world’s crunkest cocktail brother, one swallow and there’s no way you’ll ever see straight again. Listen, she’s got these big green eyes and when she turns those lights on me, I know there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for her. It ain’t just her beauty or her strength, though. You might be surprised to hear this coming from a proud country boy like myself, but I happen to think the world’s full of powerful, gorgeous-ass bitches. Being one of them is only the start of what makes my Ember so special.

Firstwise, she’s always looking out for me. When my stomach’s acting up from too many filet of fish combos or from the stress of my career and I’m glued to the shitter, she’s always there rubbing my big pale basketball belly with one hand and, what’s that she’s holding, oh yeah it’s a fresh liter of Mountain Dew to settle me. When I’m rolling coal out of the N-Mart parking lot, she’s riding shotgun with a “HELL YEAH BABY” on her luscious lips as the big black cloud belches out of the diesel engine of my daddy’s truck. During those dark days when I just couldn’t stop accidentally drinking out of my dip-spit bottle, she’s the one who went out and bought me a proper mud jug.  I made sure to get her one of her own for her birthday, which was only fair cuz I’m the one who got her hooked on them extra-long cut naturals in the first place. My point is, she’s got my back. I got hers. Don’t you think that’s the way love ought to be?

If there’s one thing I’m all about it’s loyalty, the real kind, so it’s normal for me to have my girl on my mind pretty much 24/7 (I’m even loyal in my dreams, dawg) but over the last few months, I got this kind of, what’s the word? Obsession? Fixation? I was fixed, alright. I just couldn’t stop thinking about what was happening behind Emberlyn’s ears.

She’d started taking extra shifts as a fry cook on account of how my moms’ monthly checks couldn’t cover all three of us and my career’s only just started getting off the ground. She’d spent hours hunkered over the deep fryer, the grease in the kitchen air getting trapped real good behind her lobes. She’d started to develop these huge, juicy pockets of cystic acne back there. They hurt her when they’d swell up, but she couldn’t see proper to drain them her own self, even holding her compact mirror up to the one in the bathroom to get the right angle. So she turned to me.

“Baby,” she said to me one day. She was cleaning the wax out of her right ear, a Q-tip stuck most of the way in. “I need your help baaaad.”

“Oh yeah?” I smiled. Usually when she makes her voice go all high and silky like that, it means there’s a good chance I might get some of that good guck-guck.

She fished the Q-tip out of her canal and handed it to me, coated in thick layers of yellow and green. I popped it in my mouth, my grin growing wider. There ain’t no part of this girl that ain’t heaven for me.

“Would you look back here? I am in dire straits. Let’s play Legend of the Hidden Pimple.”

She sat reverse cowgirl on the toilet, wrapping her arms around the basin. I came up behind her and pulled her right ear away from her head, real gentle-like. The inside folds of skin were red as a bad sunburn. There are so many cysts that they overlap, merging into these mega-monsters like no damn blemish I’ve ever seen before.

“Damn girl, these welts is practically throbbing.”

“That’s how they feel, for sure.”

“Baby, you mind if I give ‘em a squeeze?”

“Baby, I’d be downright offended if you didn’t.”

I barely had to touch the first one to make it burst, firing out that opening spurt like a missile. It hit me on the tip of my nose like a spatter of warm rain. I could *hear* it, not just that first crisp pop, but that gushy wet squelching as I brought my pointer fingers together and a ribbon of white, white pus came wriggling out, whole wormy inches at a time. It was like one of those old playdough squeeze machines. Even the tiniest pressure from my fingers was enough to keep it going. Soon it was curling back on itself, like a coil of dogshit. Every time I thought I’d got it emptied, more came out, sometimes as squirts of milky fluid, sometimes in chunky spurts. Finally, after a good five minutes, it was finally done and Ember’s blood ran true. I felt like one of those priests in that movie where demons hide inside the body of a precious girl.

“Damn baby, there’s so much cheez whiz coming out and it stiiiiinks,” I told her.

I saw her lip curl happily.

“Don’t save it all for yourself!”

She grabbed my wrist like I was a greedy little boy and brought my hand to her face. Sitting on top of my finger was a damn anaconda of red and white debris. She gave it a good long sniff. Both of us thought we knew all the funky stinks the other’s body could make, but this was a new one. I loved her so much right then and felt her love in return, the both of us realizing we could still surprise each other.

It was a dragon I kept chasing. All day long, when she was at work and I was running errands, shopping, getting the materials to support my career, it was in the back of my mind. On the weekends, when my buddies and I were riding our ATVs and shooting footage for our country rap music videos, all I’d be thinking about was getting behind her ears. My boys noticed I was distracted, on account of me not remembering to bring my daddy’s old .45 to use as a prop. I tried to explain but there aren’t really words for this kind of thing, at least not ones that’d bridge the divide, so to speak. I just couldn’t make my mind open its jaws and chew on something else.

At night, when Emberlyn would come through the door of the little house we share with my moms, I’d basically bum-rush her into the bathroom to get behind her ears. At first she was just as eager as me. I’d get the little blackhead bullets out, some minor eruptions of stinky paste, but there was never a pop to match that first one and every try I made to get that feeling back just seemed to push it away. I’d pinch too hard and tear her skin. My fingers would be too greasy from dinner (extra fish filets she lifted from work) and they’d slide around, making the problem worse. After weeks of this, I was trying even my sweet girl’s patience to its limit.

“Baby,” she called out after one extra gory session, “you’re hurting me and it ain’t even in a sexy way.”

“I’m sorry baby!” It kills me to stop. Makes me mad. Not at her, of course. My daddy, when he was still above ground, had a temper like a demon and I go out of the way to make sure that’s not me. I never blow up at her. She’s my sweetness and light. Besides, what I’m really angry at is myself for having no control, at my fingers for being slick with the same cooking oil that’s got her in this condition, most of all at the pus hiding away beneath her skin. “I’m trying to help but I’m just fucking everything up!”

This is the gal who once took her thumb and popped a hemorrhoid back up by corn-chute so I wouldn’t have to spend my part of momma’s check at the ass doctor. Here I was, helpless and powerless like that bitch-ass knight from the stories who’s always fighting windmills.

“Baby,” she said. She took my face between her hands. Her fingertips are cool and clean against my hot skin. “I think we need to give it a rest for now. Let’s wait a week or two, let everything heal and settle, then we’ll give it another go.”

It’s like asking the sky to not be blue or Barack Hussein to not be a secret gay Muslim. Even now, with her blood drying under my fingernails, I want to get back there and keep squeezing.

“I dunno, baby,” I said. “Might not be, uh, healthy to let them things fester back there.”

“I’ll wash them, baby. I’ll clean behind them with alcohol and soap and all that stuff.”

I didn’t want her to wash behind her ears. I thought about the skin back there getting clean, going smooth and flat with no hidden treasures for me to dig up. I didn’t feel good admitting it, but I think maybe this was about more than just helping Emberlyn. Like, maybe I’m getting more out of it than she is. But we don’t play games with each other. If she wanted me to quit, she’d ask me to.

“Just think about how big the next pop’ll be if we wait,” she said.

That one got me. Got me good. I nodded and told her we’d wait. I actually feel so damn positive about the decision, so damn drunk on the loving care of the one perfect human God ever molded, that I try to throw her over my shoulder and haul her to the bedroom. Too bad neither of us is as light as we were before we started dating 3 years ago and when I try to lift her up, we both spill over on the floor. I hit my head on the way down but there ain’t a concussion bad enough to stop me from getting horned up for my angel. We do it right there on the floor of the crapper, down with all the mold and grit and loose strands of hair.

We didn’t have to worry about privacy on account of how my moms never comes out of her room (she’ll use her grabber stick to get the food and 2-liters we leave outside her door, and she has her own toilet custom-built to her, uh, unique needs and dimensions). Ember and me went so hard, her panting and groaning in my ear, her press-on nails digging into the folds of my back, til I thought my heart was fit to explode. That’s where 3 minutes of hard work gets me these days. I’d done it with plenty of girls before that night I first met Emberlyn at the Golden Corral, but all those others just left me feeling empty after. My boo’s the only girl who ever left me feeling fuller *after* my nuts got emptied (or in this case, after I rolled off of her breathing hard and clutching my chest while a cramp ripped its way through my right ass-cheek). Dawg, I really hope everyone can find that for themselves one day (the post-nut fullness, not the ass-cheek cramp).

What I needed was a distraction. I decided to spend the next couple of weeks focusing on my career, which required all kinds of preparation in mind, body, and food. Y’all ever hear about them mukbang videos? They invented them in, like, China or one of them little Chinas they got out there. They’re videos where people basically just eat and eat and talk about what they’re eating. For real, I have not one damn clue why people like to watch this stuff. If I had to guess, I’d say it was the sounds, that ASSMR shit. It’s all that wet chewing and munching and crunching, lips smacking, tongue flicking. Those sounds just do something to a person’s brain. There are so many YouTube channels, more than you’d even believe, of folks just stuffing their faces, and some of them pull in like 10k a month.

I would’ve never known about them, or even dreamed such a thing could exist, until Emberlyn showed me. She thought I might be good at it. She even splurged and bought me one of them light rings so that none of my viewers would have to strain to see the food going into my mouth. With my baby’s love lifting me up, I know there’s no way I can fail. The only real challenge is the budget for food. I need to eat A LOT if I’m going to catch up with the big content creators. So we’ve been bulk ordering ramen from the N-Mart. I cook it on camera, mixing in soy sauce or hot sauce or ketchup to show off my skills as one of them fancy type of food making guys. Some of the commentators say watching me prepare the noodles is almost as fun as watching me eat the noodles.

Sometimes I’ll choke down two dozen packets of the stuff in one session. Go big or go home, Ember’s always reminding me. It ain’t always easy, and I pay for it later in all kinds of ways, but you gotta make sacrifices if you want a better life. The sloppier I eat and the more I eat, the more viewers I get. I slurp, slurp, slurp the noodles down, spattering spiced ramen-water all over my face, sometimes all over Ember when she leans into frame (my viewers love it when she “guest stars” in my videos, always commenting about what a fine-ass piece of tail I bagged for myself, and I don’t blame them, no one’s more lovable than my baby). Once I even splattered the camera lens with a greasy spray of noodle chunks and that was a big hit.

But nothing made my view-count jump more than that time I puked mid-feast. It wasn’t no dainty spit-up neither, but a full throated blast of stringy mostly undigested ramen bits, and I got all of it on video. What really sold it, though, was that I wiped off my mouth and just kept eating. You could see the pile of puke in the background for the rest of the video. The response I got from that, not just from my fans but from Emberlyn, was what finally sold me, in my heart, on this being my calling.

“You’re a star, baby!” she called to me when she saw the hits going all the way into the 4 digits.

“I only shine cuz you’re my whole night sky,” I told her, success unlocking my inner poet. “I’d never have done this without you.” It’s true. Everything good in my life, I owe to her.

She also reminded me to plug the music I make with my boys, to post links to it along with all that “like & subscribe” patter. I really hadn’t thought to, since I think of making music as more of a just-for-fun hobby, singing and rapping about guns and ATVs and dip, but she explained to me that attention is attention. I’m not even one of the leading guys, I just do backup vocals, stand or dance in the background, sometimes write some dope and trill ass lyrics when the spirit takes me, then give it to one of my boys to perform. Emberlyn says it don’t matter whether I’m upfront or in back, that I shine either way. She tells me she wants the world to know how wonderful her man is.

If you’ve ever listened to even a single verse of real hick hop, you’d know how much us country boys love our country roads. Long, dirt roads. The sort that takes you out on adventures and bring you back home again. The kind you drive on for hours to keep the dark thoughts away. My daddy was a real country boy too and he loved those roads more than anyone. Sometimes he’d spend whole nights away from us, just being out on the roads, not going anywhere, not leaving or arriving, just sort of riding that line between being and not being. People around town called him a wild man for that, like he’d captured the soul of what it meant to be from around here. Everyone was real damn surprised when he blew his own head off.

On nights when Ember’s working a long shift and I’m not making my videos or having a tum tum-based crisis from making my videos (those can sometimes last for days after), I’d get into my daddy’s truck. I’d drive those same roads, sometimes with that same .45 in the glove box. You gotta understand, I never think about going out the way he did. Not because I’m stronger or some shit, not even (if I’m being really, really true and real) because of Ember. My daddy had my moms, back when she could still talk and get around regular, and he had me, but that didn’t stop him. What stops me is the idea of doing it all at once like that, just BANG and you’re gone. When my time comes, I want it to last, to have my life pulled out of me little bit by little bit. You only get one go-round, right? You might as well milk the shit out of it, down to the last drop.

The night it happened, I’d just gotten home from one of my night drives and Ember was waiting for me, clipping her toenails on the couch. I felt heavy in spirit and maybe, I don’t know, some kind of sad, thinking about my daddy and what used to been. I didn’t even want to chew on her clippings or lick the jam between her toes like I usually do. I sat down beside her and let out a sigh that sounded like air coming out of an old tire.

“What’s wrong baby?” she asked me, her voice small with concern. I shrugged. I don’t really have things to say about it when this kind of darkness settles on me.

“You ever feel…” I started. I thought about my body, before I started spending so much time on my career. I was never thin like a model, always been a big beautiful boy, but man have I ballooned up since I started going so hard on making content. I wouldn’t mind but it hurts my knees kinda awful to get around and it hasn’t exactly been easy to make love with Ember lately. Trouble running out of breath, trouble finishing. I thought about my moms’ condition and the shitty state of our little house, doors practically falling off of hinges, new species of mold growing between the cracks. I thought about how I don’t really have anything besides Ember to call my own. “You ever feel that nothing really matters?”

Emberlyn bit her lower lip.

“Baby, everyone has blue spells that come over us now and again. My momma had it sometimes, before she went home to Jesus on account of the diabetes, and she was just the kindest lady in town. You’re down. It’s natural. It don’t make you any less wonderful in my eyes.” She took my hand. “Just don’t go feeling bad for feeling bad.”

My breath came out raspy and broken. A fat tear spilled out of the corner of my eye. I took my big woman in my big arms and held her tight.

“If you’re up for it,” she said to me after a while, “I know one thing that might cheer you up?”

I opened my eyes and looked at her.

“What’s that baby?”

“Let’s go to the bathroom.”

Now there are all kinds of activities we get up to in there that might lift my mood, among other things. We even bought a pack of extra large adult diapers we’d been meaning to try out. Then I saw her point behind her ears and my heart leapt. It’d been weeks. I’d managed to keep myself busy enough, making them mukbangs, doing my thing, but it had never left my mind entirely, had always been lurking there in the back corner, building up, readying itself to explode.

“You mean it baby?” I asked. “You ready?”

“I don’t just want it,” she replied huskily. “I need it. Now.”

We made our way to the commode. She assumed the position in what passed for good light, under the one remaining lit bulb. It gave me a wicked idea.

“Baby?” I was honestly a little shy about what I was about to propose. “You think we should livestream this shiz? I think our viewers would love the shit out of it.”

“HELL YEAH BABY!” she replied with an oomph that blew the last few storm clouds off my mood. “You get the rig and the rest of the stuff. I’ll wait here.”

It took about ten minutes to set it all up. It wasn’t easy but I managed to get my phone/camera mounted at just the right angle for a perfect up close view of the inflamed creese behind Emberlyn’s left ear. What I saw back there was definitely worth the wait. There was a mega-cyst the size of a silver dollar, so red and swollen it practically had its own heartbeat.

Once Ember told me she was ready, I got the livestream started up. I shouted out my fans and explained that we were going to be doing something new today.

“If y’all are real fans then you know my girl! Ember, tell the people ‘hi’!”

“Hi people! I’ve been waiting for this so long and I am just so excited to share it with every one of you!”

“Ember’s been working those fryolators hard, helping to earn the scratch that keeps these videos going but, as you can see, her poor skin’s been suffering in a MAJOR way.”

I see the comments already starting to pop up on my phone:

**OMFG ive NEVER seen a fing pimple that big!**

**STOP talkin n START POPPING**

**bro wheres the ramen? I cum here to watch u eat not whatever this is**

**U 2 r the most disgusting peeple in the world u ought to be ashamed**

**pop that zit already u fat POS**

**POP HER WHOLE HEAD**

Well, you gotta give the people what they want.

I was a little nervous at this point. I had to stop my fingers from shaking before bringing them to either side of the angry, red hill of flesh on the side of my love’s head. The pop was like a volcano exploding. It spattered my face and stung my eyes with hot greenish white fluid. It was even better than the first time. I lick my lips and the taste on them is foul and salty.

Another squeeze and another wave of pus and stench. There was an impossible amount of discharge with each new push. It made wet, loud squelching noises, like when an alien in a movie wriggles its slimy body across the floor. I looked over at the comments. Shock. Disgust. More than anything, urgings for me to continue. The view count, already higher than I’ve ever had, just kept climbing

After a few minutes, my hands were totally coated in reeking globs, coils of white, and whatever broth it is your body cooks up when things go bad beneath the surface. I had to take a short break to wash them off. Then I got right back to it. This was what I’d been dreaming of. The whole damn motherlode. I wanted, *needed*, to get every drop.

As I squeezed, I could feel something extra chunky working its way to the surface along with all the cottage cheese. I pushed down even harder, driving it to the surface in a spray of blood and body fluid.

“The fuck,” I said, pinching the surprisingly solid object I just unearthed and holding it up to the light for a better look. My eyes drifted over to the words scrolling across my phone screen.

**WTF WTF WTF**

**HOLY SHIT IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS???**

**bro stop this can’t be healthy**

**IT’S A TOOTH YOU PULLED A FUCKING TOOTH OUT OF HER HEAD**

**Impossible!!! No way it culd come out of pimpel like that**

**what r u a zit scientist or something?? STFU thats def real**

**cringe!**

**keep going keep going keep going**

**i dont beleev my eyes u r a lier + a bastard + everything wrong with amerika**

**DON’T STOP FATTY DON’T STOP TIL SHES INSIDE OUT**

“Baby,” I said to her, “this don’t look right.”

“I don’t care,” she moaned. “I can feel more in there. Get it all out. Please. I’m begging you.”

The truth was that I didn’t want to stop either. I kept squeezing. A fleshy bundle the length of my arm was the next thing to shoot out. It looked almost like a caterpillar’s cocoon. Inside I could see tiny chunks of bone and what looked like bits of internal organs, a heart valve, a scoop of lung, suspended like fruit in a jello mold.

“Oh my god,” I kept saying. Emberlyn was saying it too. Our fans cheered us on. We had over a hundred thousand viewers. This was exactly the kind of content people wanted from us.

**these special effects r wild!!**

**We r so lucky to see this its rly once in a lifetime**

**now THIS is CULTURE**

**This is like sumthing out of hell itself. a sign that Revelations are at hand. Please embrace His Word and His Love b4 its 2 late! Behold the LAMB of GOD, JOHN 1:29**

**bro i just come here for the ramen videos & even this is to much for me wtf is this shit**

**This is so fucked I’m calling 911**

**dont be a fucking Karen just let the man cook**

**This whole freakshow is so fucking CRINGE**

**ur crazzy this is the most based thing ive evr seen**

**EMPTY THAT BITCH OUT LIKE YOU LOVE HER**

The floor was wet and slick with the vital contents of my one true love’s body. I had to fight not to slip in it. Soon I could feel it welling up around my ankles and shins. It made squelching noises as I planted my feet even firmer.

*“I love you, baby, I love you so much,”* I heard Ember saying, but her voice was a small wheeze now. Her head was like a deflating balloon. The sound squeezing out of it came less from her mouth, which was disappearing into limp folds, and more from the round bloody hole that was still pouring out everything within her, not just the contents of her body, but her soul as well. In that moment, I could see all that she was.

There was more on the outside now than even should’ve been possible, more than she had ever seemed to have inside her. A great wave of Ember’s life washed into the hallway beyond the bathroom door, filling up the house.

*“Don’t stop baby,”* the tiny voice said from what was left of her almost all the way spent shell. *“Keep going, pleeeeeease.”*

So I did. I kept going until the voice was quiet, until she was nothing but an emptied out sack, floating in a pool of her own spending, not just her guts or bones or the contents of her stomach, but in the puss I could see reflections of her hopes and dreams. I saw her momma’s face. I saw a future where my videos would pay for a house of our own we’d fill with our kids. Most of all, I saw myself, looking my best, being a star.

Then I wept. I didn’t even cry like that after daddy died. Lots of folks watching on their screens thought I was crying for Emberlyn. Because of what I done to her. But people are idiots. They don’t understand. I was crying because I knew that it was the last time. I’d never have another pop like that. That’s the problem with hitting the motherlode. Eventually you empty it and then what’s left after?

For me, it was the police. The stream was still running, showing me bawling like a damn baby, kneeling in the knee-deep sludge, clutching the emptied sack of Emberlyn’s skin to my face. At least one person in that great big audience must’ve called the authorities. I’ve since been told that the wave of stink that emanated from my house was knocking animals out of the trees for miles around. So that might’ve been what tipped them off. They told me they think the shock of that smell must be what finally killed my moms.

Some folks are calling it cold-blooded murder, even if they can’t figure out how I did it. Some folks are saying that Ember and I had been killing each other for years. Like I said, people are idiots. I still think I’m the luckiest guy alive. How many people have ever had a love so complete? Not many and I’d bet cash money on that.

Maybe they’ll let me out of this cell one day and I can get my channel going again, be the star she always wanted me to be. I gotta carry the weight of my dreams and hers now too, so that she stays a part of me, living a second life under my skin. Anyways, that’s how I wound up here dawg. How about you?
