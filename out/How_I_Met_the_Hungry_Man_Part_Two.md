[As mentioned, my Grandfather was a brilliant storyteller](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nwup9f/how_i_met_the_hungry_man_part_one/): "There once was a wolf, it's teeth were sharp and glistened in the moonlight that shone on its grizzly deeds. For many of these nights the wolf had hunted, feasted then, moved on, but now it had found itself hungry, and its fur was beginning to hang loose about its long, slouching frame. That is why when he happened upon the Farmer's land, his famished eyes grew wide at the livestock that flocked in their multitudes. Sheep as large as cattle, ducks as fat as butter and mice lazy from the resting grain in the stores. "Tonight, I shall eat of the mice" spoke the wolf to the wind "I am much to tired to chase sheep or duck"

And so the wolf did. In fact he ate of each and every single mouse that had lived on the farm, and with his hunger satisfied for that day, he retired to the hillock a short distance away.

When the farmer awoke the next day, his wife told him of an unsettling feeling she had during the night. She told him of ill winds. The farmer, as wise as he was, assured his worried wife that they and their daughters would be safe, and that no ill wind would hit them. When he had returned that night with the news that the mice had disappeared he remarked to his family aloud "T'was no ill wind that you felt, but a favourable one, the mice are gone!" The family rejoiced at this, for their stores had been plagued by the vermin.

That night, while the farmer and his family slumbered, the wolf returned. "The Farmer's duck and geese are fat" he whispered to himself "better they be used to ensure my coat fits me for the winter months than to fill their pots and pans". So it was that the wolf ate of each and every one of the farmer's poultry.

"Another horrible wind blew o'er our house last night husband" the wife spoke as the Farmer put his boots on, ready to quit his abode for the farm.

"Nay" he answered calmly "t'was but the backwash of the good winds we had yesterday"

That evening when he returned, depression and concern were the feelings he wore. "Family mine, your mother was true. T'was a horrid wind that blew o'er our house last night. The ducks and geese and hens are gone!"

The daughters cried at the news.

"Children." he paused their tears "Wife." he looked to her "Let us pray that this wind ceases, and that our sheep be untouched"

So it was that the family bowed their heads and prayed for many minutes that their sheep would be untouched.

Night came upon them, and so too did tiredness come. While they slept, the wolf descended from his hillock, his coat fine and thick in the nightly breeze. "The trophy of a farm destroyed would surely impress a mate" he reasoned with himself "and if not a mate, the satisfaction would imprint an immortal grin upon my face" His words were not soon spoken before he attacked the flock. Massacring ram, ewe and lamb.

The next morning, the Farmer rose earlier than his family, and seeing the blood-soaked grass and carcasses in his pasture fell to tears. That night his wife spoke "We are ruined"

The wise Farmer replied, his voice louder than the wails of their children "Nay, not ruined, but tested. We must pray to the Lord that he may be pleased and our fortunes be saved. If not we may still yet be thankful that we have one another"

At this the family huddled together, hungry and frightened, and prayed.

While the family slept the Wolf crept toward their front door. "A human" he thought to himself "What other wolf may boast of destroying a flock of that caliber?" So it was that the wolf entered the Farmer's house and ate the Farmer's wife and children, before quitting the scene to the hillock.

When the Farmer awoke he cried deep, angry wails of despair. At his table that night, no supper, no child, and no wife, the Farmer became hungry. Hungry for revenge. He prayed to something older than God. Something much older. He plunged his hands into the ground outside of his home and spoke:

"Mo Shaol ar son mo theaghlaigh. Mo shaol ar son mo fhortún. Mo shaol duitse."

The wolf seen the Farmer on his knees and thought "I may yet stay here, raise cubs here. This land may yet be mine" His fangs were long and sharp and eager, he felt his drool slide down his fangs as he got closer to the Farmer.

"Mo Shaol ar son mo theaghlaigh. Mo shaol ar son mo fhortún. Mo shaol duitse."

The wolf picked up his speed, whatever mumblings the broken Farmer was making were of no interest to him. The wind rustled his coat, and the noise of the breeze played musically in his ears.

"Mo Shaol ar son mo theaghlaigh. Mo shaol ar son mo fhortún. Mo shaol duitse."

The Farmer's mumblings became clearer now as the wolf approached closer.

"Mo Shaol ar son mo theaghlaigh-"

The wolf stopped suddenly. The Farmer's lips moved, yet no sound was produced. The wind toyed with his majestic fur yet it's music was missing from the very air. For the first time since he was a cub, the wolf felt a feeling he had forgotten. Fear. He looked down at his mighty paws, and seen the grass between his toes appear to grow upward. In his ears he heard the beating of his heart intensify, the grass began to curl around his entire foot. It's long stems extending up and through his fur binding him in place, before dragging the rest of him into a kneeling position, then to a sitting position. In panic, he gnawed at the grass that sought to cover him. In doing so the grass shot and attached itself to his maw, dragging the beast even closer to the ground. Soon the grass had covered his entire body. Yet before the grass could cover his eyes, he beheld his final terrifying, silent sight. The Farmer was still praying, oblivious to the torment that took place behind him, but standing behind him, tall, and impossibly thin, was another man. His clothes hung loosely about him, his head seemed to bob heavily atop his slender neck, yet the being seen the wolf. The wolf could feel it. It was only when the being made its staggered approach that the grass, mercifully blinded the wolf.

The Farmer awoke the next day. He had a new family. He had new livestock. Despite this, the Farmer never felt the same ever again."

Mum agreed with the doctors that Grandad's behaviour warranted that he should stay longer, and they also believed that, as his next of kin, that she may be able to convince him to stay until he had fully recovered. Myself and Dad were outside the room, as she did her best to calm him. Reassuring him that he would be better shortly and that whatever he needed to do at home could surely wait. The volume of his responses assured us just how well that was going.

"He is one stubborn man" Dad spoke, breaking the silence, his elbows resting on his green-stained trousers.

"Luckily" I paused as my mother shouted back at her father "she is one stubborn woman"

Dad smiled at me "You're not wrong Son"

I was going to answer him, when to my surprise Gabrielle appeared in my peripheral.

"Hey Jamie" she spoke, her smile wide and inviting.

"Oh" I was surprised "Hi Gabrielle"

She extended her hand to my father "Gabriellel" she spoke softly "I am helping with your father-in-law"

"Nice to meet you" Dad responded.

"Jamie" her gaze returned to me "may I speak to you about what transpired before your grandfather's outburst last night?"

"Of course"

She paused and looked at my father politely. It took me to look at him too before he realised what she had been indicating "I'll go in and check on your mother" he patted my knee and rose with a grunt, before entering the room.

She sat beside me, and spoke with a sympathetic tone "Jamie. I'm really sorry that you have to go through all this"

I paused before answering "It's ok"

"Can you tell me the conversation you had with your grandfather prior to his assault on Doctor Sharma?"

I froze "Assault?" panic began to rise in my chest "Is Doctor Sharma pressing charges?"

She placed a hand on mine "No no, he isn't" adopting a motherly tone "we just need this for our records. Doctor Sharma is a professional and understands the situation fully"

"What 'situation'?" I asked, my eyebrow rising.

She withdrew her hand. "Jamie, I didn't want to be the one to tell you this, indeed the staff and I are only speculating at the moment, but" she hesitated "your grandfather's response to your conversation, his sudden outburst of anger, may indicate a cognitive issue"

The world seemed to crash entirely at that point. "What does that even mean?"

"As I said" her voice remained calm "we are investigating, and as such, we have no proof" quickly, she added: "but your cooperation can really help us get the help your grandfather needs, no matter what that help may be"

I dragged my open palms down my face slowly, and with a heavy sigh I began "He seemed perfectly fine, until I mentioned my dad's work"

"Your dad's work?"

"He's a landscaper" I lied.

"I understand." she jotted the information down on a pad she had been holding "is there any reason why that might be an issue?"

"Well" I thought of how best to phrase the answer "Mum has been out of work, and with me being at college, I can only really work the weekends"

"hmmm"

"So" I added, in an attempt to easily explain my grandfather's actions "Maybe it was just the stress that my mother was under that caused him to" I raised my hands, and bent the forefingers on either one "'Need to go home' right?"

Her pen slid noiselessly across the page. A cold feeling crept up my arms. He looked up at Gabrielle, her mouth moved but no words came out.  I felt my brow knit at the strange scene. Gabrielle's eye's widened at the lack of a response she received. Then, all at once, the world's noise returned in a frightening crescendo of curse words, angry steps, a feminine scream, and an opening door.

"Fuck" Dad burst from the door, pinching a nose that was running streams of vibrant red.

Gabrielle leapt to her feet to assist him "What happened?"

"Crazy bastard hit me" he stuttered.

Gabrielle eyed me, before turning my father and escorting him to the nearest nurse's station.

I didn't get to see Grandad that day. Instead I drove Dad home in his van, while Mum stayed at the hospital. Dad pinching his nose and looking at the roof's interior the entire journey.

"Feeling okay?" I asked

"Shut up son" he squeaked back at me.

When we got home, I opened the front door for Dad, and hit the kettle for him as he changed out of his work clothes, and gingerly, I imagine, navigated a clean shirt over his injured face.

Mum's got home about an hour later. She looked terrible, and spoke little.

"Why don't you go out and have a cigarette?" Dad spoke softly "I'll start on dinner, and Jamie will run you a bath"

She smiled weakly at both if us before dropping her handbag by the door. "I'd love that" she looked like she could cry "thank you"

Dad took the lighter from his pocket and a cigarette from his shirt pocket, and approached her arms outstretched. They embraced, and as they swayed gently, I felt a pang of guilt. I need to tell them soon. I had to. They couldn't keep working themselves to the bone to keep me in a college I was flunking. It wasn't right. Boiling the courage within myself, I was interrupted when Dad asked "Boy?"

"Yeah?"

"Run the bath for you mother will you?"

I didn't answer, instead just doing as I was told.

With the bath waiting on her, and Dad starting on dinner, Mam stood outside on the porch, giving myself and Dad a chance to discuss her in peace.

"She's finding this tough, Jamie"

"Yeah. She's bound to be"

"I don't know what will happen your grandfather son, but whatever happens will effect her deeply"

I nodded at the implication. "What do you think it is?"

"I think it's an old man whose age is catching up on him"

"What do you mean?"

"Well" Dad slid the carrots into the boiling pot of water "A man his age, with *his* experiences? The divorce, raising Kathryn on his own from a baby, getting through her sickness when she was a teenager, his retirement, then dealing with your mother's tough time. It's all bound to leave a mark on an old brain"

"So" I answered angrily "you think Grandad is losing it?"

Dad paused his chopping "I didn't say that Son. I just think that-"

"For fuck's sake Brian" Mum shouted at Dad as she entered "Can you please start cleaning your boots before you come onto the porch? Or at least sweep away the grass from the door when you're done cleaning?"

Dad rolled his eyes for a moment before responding with a restrained calmness "I will try and remember. That must have been there from the other day, I came straight to the hospital from work"

I stared at Mum, who in turn shut the door behind her, muttering something to herself about being under enough stress. Dad waited for the bathroom door to shut before he sighed deeply into the broth he had been cooking. My eyes never left the shining brass handle of the front door.
