I’ve never spoken about this. I’ve spent my life isolating from others, always seemed easier to keep to myself than tolerate the soul sucking conventions that make up our every day social interactions, make limited mention of the “obligations” imposed by some family and friends. I had just put down my first dog, Baxter. He had grown older and senile - a mercy, the vet had told me. He was such a personality. A howler to the end. And constantly groaning at the innocent antics of his retriever brother, Gus Gus.

Baxter, unlike Gus, could walk for hours, miles and miles, seemingly never tiring. Gus is pure house dog, a typical retriever in that he demands affection and gives none in return. I started walking more after Baxter moved on. I needed to clear my head and feel like I was doing something with my life at a time when I simply did nothing else but sleep and work, romance always a close wish but never finding me.

Gus was a pleasant companion but did not have the constitution to keep up. If I grabbed his leash, most days he would run upstairs and jump under my comforter. But not this time. 

I had signed off from work, a thanklessly overbearing job for the government, and pushed my chair out with an exhausted scoff. “Gus!” No movement. I figured he was in a dead sleep, so I put on my hiking boots and walked to the door. There was Gus, sitting, waiting patiently. The smile that was usually frozen on his face was noticeably absent, I assumed he felt obligated to join me.

He patiently waited, like always, as I put his harness on. Having been born without my left hand and most of my forearm, it sometimes took me a few extra seconds to secure him. Baxter ever the erudite, closeted republican son had always sat still, allowing me to take my time to hook the harness, but not Gus Gus - too excited to contain himself, only to soon realize walks were aerobic exercise and not just for pats from the limited strangers in our town.

I decided to walk the trail into the woodland a quarter mile from my house. I rarely walked this way due to the plethora of coyotes and badgers, but I felt adventurous and craved new scenery.

Gus walked to the trail almost instinctively, with purpose, not stopping to sniff his usual spots to make sure he was the most recent mark on a mail post. The beavers did not draw his notice.

The trail was beautiful as always, a narrow opening in a sea of marshland and neglected trees. It was summer, the days longer and the light bright and welcoming. Gus turned slightly to a narrower trail and I let him lead on.

We walked past the boulders and jagged rocks where I have been told King Philip would gather and rally his troops in the old days. History is a funny thing.

We walked through the rocks when Gus stopped dead. There was a sound, a slight whistling. Gus wouldn’t move. He stood without breaking his attention to the small creek just beyond a large boulder. I walked around him and pulled him along. Then, there he was.

He couldn’t have been taller than 18 inches. Dressed in all black - or more likely a soiled suit of a darker color. Tufts of burning red hair seemed to have fought their way out from underneath his hat. A small scullery cap. He was whistling softly as he washed his hands. A small pipe lay resting on the rock to his side.

I have no explanation for what I said next. I am a person of limited interest in the psychic or supernatural, yet it came to me without thought or pretense.

“Barnabas…”

His spine curled, hands lay limp in the water, as he turned to face me. He had the facial hair of John Adams, though red in color, and the complexion of an Arizonan roofer with a three pack a day habit.

He stood up straight, gently tossing the water from his hands and drying them on his pant legs.

“Barnabas.” I said again, Gus sitting patiently now by my side.

The creature then looked to Gus and spoke, “Maith an buachaill,” and winked.

A leprechaun. It couldn’t be. But, there he stood, his illuminated green eyes fixated now on me.

A thousand thoughts raced through my head - what the hell would a leprechaun be doing in Massachusetts? What the hell is a leprechaun doing existing?!

He let out a soft, low whistle, and vanished leaving only his smoldering pipe.

“Fuck.”
