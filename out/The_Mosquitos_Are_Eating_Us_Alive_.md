My heart sank as I woke up to the sun streaming in. A warm sunny Saturday- that would mean only one thing- we have to get our asses in gear and head outdoors, to a lake or park or something. God forbid we spend a Saturday resting at home after a hard week of work.

“Sun guilt” my wife calls it laughingly- apparently we’ll feel bad if we don’t go outside and enjoy sunshine and nature.

No I won’t.

Oh stop grumbling she says, and it’s too late- we’re there already- at a local lake.

Trudging through the narrow woodsy trail to get to the lake side, I look at my wife’s bare legs and arms in her flimsy shorts and tank-top, brushing against the branches and leaves. She’s not a local. “Honey, watch out for ticks and bugs will ya?” I call. “Oh shoot I forgot the mosquito repellant” she answers, but doesn’t seem to mind and soon enough we eerge fro the woods onto a narrow stony beach by the lake.

We plop down on our towels, a bit winded and sweaty from the short hike. Mosquitos find us enticing.

My wife gives little screams, slapping them away. We decide to go in, to escape them.

We wade out together, but then my wife declares the lake is creepy. She is right. It is. The water has a reddish-black tinge to it due its minerals. It’s a bit windy too. My wife returns to the beach, but I’m in no hurry to join the mosquitos and ticks, and wade in further, deep enough to dip my head in and swim a bit. I can still hear my wife’s little screams in the distance, carrying over the water. I splash around some more, beginning to relax and enjoy the feel of the cool red-blackish water against my skin.

My wife’s screams are becoming louder, I guess she was calling me to go back as I was drifting further from the shore. I want to ignore the screams but they have reached a hysterical pitch I have never heard before. Reluctantly I anchor my feet in the mushy rocky weird lake floor and with water streaming from my eyes look back at the shore.

In time to see giant creatures that look like overgrown ticks and mosquitos, huge creatures of monstrous proportions impaling my wife on their enormous sharp protrusions. Before my horror-struck eyes, they rip her apart and proceed to calmly eat bleeding pieces of her, some of the still squiggling. Their fearsome mouth chew in what seems like slow motion. The sound of screaming has long died down.

After my first initial paralysis of shock and fright pass, I duck under the water, and swim over to the next little beach, about a hundred meters over. As I had hoped, that beach was clear of the infestation, the main attraction being obviously elsewhere. I wade towards land, ignoring the things brushing against my legs, and once there, sprint up the trail as fast as I can towards the parking lot. Branches and leaves and other things that i dare not look at catch at me, brushing against my wet skin as I run, but nothing stops me, and soon I am by the highway, sobbing wet and begging for help, but safe from the giant mosquitos and ticks on the beach by the lake.
