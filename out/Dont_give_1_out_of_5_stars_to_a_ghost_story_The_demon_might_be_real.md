*Shoddy dialogue. A persistent passive voice. Uninspired characters with no discernible motives. A derivative entity that I like to call Dull Din. I could list more of \[author\]’s shortcomings, but I’ll leave the art of meandering prose to him. He’s mastered it, after all.*

**1/5 stars**

I’m a horror critic, and that’s a snippet from my deleted review. Upon reflection, I suppose I might’ve been needlessly cruel. But isn’t that a critic’s defining quality? Nobody wants to read a pandering passage about a piece of art.

Okay, I’m a cynic. In my defence, it’s been a rough year — and the author, who I’ll call Thomas, caught me on a particularly bad day. My wife, Clara, had just left me. And the author’s supernatural tale about Din, his paranormal protector, bored me beyond belief.

The emailed response I received from Thomas was a little disconcerting, but I was no stranger to hate mail.

**Subject: Dull Din**

*He’s coming for you, Nathan.*

I was tempted to email a reply that Thomas’ threat was even less terrifying than his poorly written story, but I restrained myself. If only I’d exhibited the same self-discipline before publishing that cursed review.

I sobbed in the lounge, gorging on pizza with my dearest companion, Dom Pérignon. I’m a drunkard, but I know how to crumble with class — I come from a long line of polished turds. It’s ancestral. We act with poise and aplomb, but we’re ugly underneath.

I don’t think any of my ancestors have ever experienced a comeuppance like mine though.

There was a knock at the door. I slumped off the sofa and lazily sauntered to the lobby, unlatching the door. It wasn’t locked. Why bother? I hadn’t expected any visitors.

It wasn’t Clara who startled me. Yes, it *was* shocking to see my wife on the doorstep, but something else horrified me. Only for a second.

A black ghoul, wearing only a malignant smile, was standing behind Clara. It was peering over my wife’s shoulder, but it rapidly disappeared behind her. I screamed, running past Clara, but the entity was nowhere to be seen.

“What’s wrong with you, Nathan?” Clara groaned, entering the house. “You’re not having a breakdown, are you?”

I stood in the snow, shivering from the chill in both the air and my veins. I thought I might well be having an episode, so I slowly backed into the house, closing the door behind us.

“And now your socks will be soaked,” Clara sighed. “I hate to mother you — that’s exactly why I left. But you should go and change. I’ll make us some coffee.”

She was right. My feet were frozen, so I rushed upstairs, flung the socks into the laundry basket, and found a fresh, warm pair. As I was strolling downstairs, I prepared my apology for Clara. It wasn’t the first time she’d grown tired of my shit and walked away.

“Look, Clara…” I began, walking into the kitchen.

She wasn’t there. The hairs on my skin rose to attention, as if my body were sensing something and my conscious mind were simply playing catch-up. It was oddly quiet downstairs.

“Clara?” I called.

With a resounding clunk, the lights blew. *Every* light blew. I could hear the cacophony of lightbulbs shattering throughout the house. I froze, hyperventilating in my lifeless and lightless home.

And then there was the sound of static. Radio static. A garbled, pitch-shifted version of *Every Breath You Take* by The Police began to play. My throat narrowed, and I gasped for air as I realised what was happening. It was what Din had done in Thomas’ story. The demon tormented the family, all in the name of protecting its master — in the end, it massacred everyone but Thomas.

A low-pitched, slowed, sourceless Sting sang.

*Every breath you take…*

“Clara!” I cried. “Where are you?”

*Every move you make…*

I strolled through the darkened house, wishing my inebriated brain could recall where I’d left my phone — or *anything* that could light the way. The sinisterly strung guitar twangs and menacing vocals suddenly fizzled out.

As I entered the lobby, the light sprang to life — the only non-shattered lightbulb in the house. I pierced the still air with a bloodcurdling screech, as I found myself looking upon my wife’s crumpled, misshapen, motionless body. It lay at Din’s feet. The smiling shadow crackled statically as it took tentative, taunting strides towards me.

“Nitpicking Nathan,” It hissed. “What might we find if we hack away at *your* flaws?”

Before I had a chance to respond, the entity’s arm grew and pierced my face, scooping into my cheek like fleshy ice cream. I unleashed an agonising bellow and fell to my knees, clutching the bloody cavity in my face.

“You had some blemishes, so I fixed them,” Din said, smiling. “*Shoddy* complexion.”

Then it loomed over me, its smile transforming into a gaping hole that revealed a hellish inferno. An endless pit of torture that I was certain I would enter. But I didn’t. Instead, I received a parting warning.

“I could *fix* more of your shortcomings, but I’ll leave the art of *self-improvement* to you. I think you’re about to master it.”

And then Clara twitched. I realised she was still alive, though she could not move her broken limbs. Din grinned at me with insidious intent, and the black shadow expanded, engulfing my surroundings. I watched as the terrifying abomination swallowed Clara’s crippled, screaming body, damning her to an eternity in Hell.

The shadow vanished in a matter of seconds, leaving me to digest the enormity of what I had unwittingly done.

Lesson learnt. Din, you’re not even *marginally* dull. 5 out of 5 stars.
