I was desperate for work. There were few options left. My small town was drained of opportunity, and few people my age were left, except for a couple rejects, degenerates. I put resumes out, but the bleak rain, the way the wind tended towards the horizon with a lacerating edge, halted my progress, kept me staring out windows, watching the old folk in my town walk from street corner to street corner, avoiding eye contact with each other. I could swear they had black eyes, pale skin so tight it was like plastic, a mere covering, not real flesh.



I often visited one of the stores near my home when the rain and wind stopped screaming like horrified banshees- foxes caught in traps, ugly sirens on rocks of shores decorated by the ravages of nature with shipwrecks- to idle time when my house didn't feel home-like, only house-like. A mere place. As empty as the eyes of the black eyed old folk.



The cashier, the owner, the only provider of service within the store- a coffee shop, book store, and antique store all in one- often eyed me in my booth, as I gazed upon the fluorescent lights that gleamed on the surgical white, clean, polished with wax flooring. It reminded me of a morgue's floor, cleansed of bile, blood, and organic spray. It always smelled of bleach. The owner always smelled of old sweat. Her sweat had a sickly scent of ruptured cherries, or flowers crushed and washed in ditch water, or the unwashed skin of a vagabond. Her eyes were beady, needle points that stabbed into me. I found a coldness crawling up my spine when her eyes darted to me. But I was too focused on the lights on the tile, and the wind as it screamed, screamed, to pay much attention to her dead, stabbing eyes. Her voice was of crawling static from dead, breaking down televisions- the channels of forgotten nostalgias, wretched futures caught in one drowning voice on the screen. I often ordered cheap coffee and drank my fill, and wasted time in one of the back booths, often jotting down in my notebook how the wind spoke to me. Her vein in her neck bulged as she spoke to me, and her sweaty black hair seemed to shiver, vibrate with anxiety towards nothing- all in reaction to me- as if I were unwanted.



During my time waiting, waiting for nothing, I would sometimes hear a metallic slamming that I assumed was a machine she used to cook. It often scared me, and would come usually when the wind, the rain, stopped, and the lights in the street would shut down, as if the false light died, and resounded as a murder victim,with a sudden scream of metal on metal breaking, colliding suddenly, but robotic, unreal, impossible, and the owner would depart to the back- when she heard it her face would erupt with wrinkles, fear in her eyes, terror in her small, pathetic hands, and she would waddle like a fear-stricken toddler, afraid from judgement from Mother. It would make its scream once or twice, then the lights would return, and the owner would come back, relaxed, like nothing had happened. 



My last time in the store was a Sunday, when all the folk were gathered in the only Church, a brutalist cathedral with a large steel cross that had Christ Saves in all capital letters, seemingly etched with a hammer and chisel against the steel, as if the message had to be screamed against the winds, to call all to worship at the altar. I had no drive, no will to go, to enter and enter into that sacred communion with those with black eyes, pale, plastic skin of those folk. My silence, and cheap, black coffee was enough for peace, from wandering room to room in my home, waiting for letters, phone calls, men in suits at my door offering jobs, opportunity. The winds died down, and I enjoyed the brief silence, a moment of quiet within myself; the winds calming within, as without was only a primal black, the only place in the world this little shop. I sipped the warm coffee, and it was mixed poorly, so a clump of instant coffee clung to my tongue- I felt like gagging-  I seemingly could get no rest from my constant stress- then the lights went out, killed silently by an invisible reaper-and even a simple minded shop- owner couldn’t mix instant coffee together for a paying customer, and then the clanging started again, this time always rapturous against the silence. My poor shop owner friend shook, eyes vibrating in their skull, limbs quivering with a deranged bolt of energy, and her expression was of confusion, despair. 



"It should've been enough. I should've been enough" her voice crackled, and she departed like a dream after waking, the impressions of her leaving like the textures of the wind. I laughed to myself, finding the whole spectacle comedic. Then I heard the wet squelching, and a sharp scream, that was quickly silenced by a noise of industrial accidents all meeting on a single body, and a crunching of bone emitted from the room, a thunder from the violence shook the walls, and I sipped from my coffee, transfixed on the door she went through, shaking with whatever was happening within, whatever force was impressing upon spraying flesh. I had imagined a body so mangled it was unrecognizable, and I knew I had to leave, go out into the night. The coffee certainly stained my tongue, and burnt it. 



Outside my vision I could barely track where I was in relation to the shop, and my feverish mind brought me to an alleyway, and as I went by touch through it, my hands slick with grime by tracing the walls, I fell into a trash heap, and I felt a warm wetness soak my hands. Like a warm fruit it embraced around my hands, and a slow, weak suction, like the maw of a sluggish animal licking. It was sensual, but still it brought cold fear up my spine. I cried out into the alleyway, my flesh crawling, and then it released me- I imagine due to its weakness- and I darted through various alleyways, turning down this or that path, as I heard a sobbing like a neglected pet, but emitted through an infected orifice, a clumping of flesh muting the sob, and it seemed to ring my mind with despair, hollow as a place of worship left empty, and any gesture done completely pointless against the weight of emptiness, of hunger infinite. When the lights came back on, I found myself in a lonely field on the edge of town; a silence, the moon and the rising sun, and a yellowing decaying colour staining the sky as it bloomed across the horizons. I wonder what happened to the disgusting shop owner, or what that thing was in that alleyway, but I took it as another sign of this place being more wretched every day. Returning home, I waited eagerly for the stares of black eyes, for their plastic skin to tighten when they regarded me, since they knew that I knew their impossible mystery, but veiled by chanting winds and sudden metallic raptures, and sucking orifices waiting in long, endless alleyways.
