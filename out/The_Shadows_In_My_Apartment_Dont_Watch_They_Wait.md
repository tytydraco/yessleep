I first noticed it when I moved into the apartment. Nothing unusual at first—just the usual creaks of a building that had stood since the ’70s. But then I started to see them.

Not exactly people. Shadows.

At first, I thought I was imagining things. I’d walk into the living room after a long day and, out of the corner of my eye, I’d catch something flickering on the wall. A shape that shouldn’t be there. But whenever I turned my head to look directly, it vanished.

It started subtly. The shadows in my apartment—my own, the furniture, the coat rack—began to move slightly on their own. A twitch here, a shiver there, as if they were breathing. Then, they started to change.

It was the night I was looking at old family photos that I really noticed. The shadows on the walls behind me twisted and warped, forming figures I recognized. My sister, whom I hadn’t seen in years. My father, who died when I was sixteen. They weren’t quite right, their limbs too long, their heads tilted at impossible angles but there was no mistaking their faces.

And then I heard it. A whisper.

“Let me in,” it hissed, low and dry, like leaves scraping concrete.

I spun around, my heart pounding. My apartment was empty. Just me, the low hum of the fridge, the muffled traffic outside. My rational brain screamed that it was just my imagination. But the shadows didn’t stop.

In the following days, the whispers grew louder. Not always words, sometimes just soft murmurs but always persistent. The shadows no longer just imitated people; they began to imitate me. The way I walked. The way I gestured when talking to myself. Sometimes, they moved before me, as if learning me, practicing me.

I stopped inviting people over. I stopped using my living room. I started sleeping on the sofa, in the dark, watching the shadows stretch and twist across the walls like liquid. The apartment had changed somehow. It wasn’t just a place I lived; it was alive, and it was watching me.

Then I noticed the cracks. Small at first, along the floorboards and baseboards. But they weren’t cracks in the wood…they were cracks in me.

I looked at myself in the mirror, and sometimes my reflection lagged a second behind my movements, as if it was trying to catch up. I’d reach for the faucet, and it would hang there in the mirror for a moment longer. My reflection began to tremble, almost imperceptibly, as if the mirror itself was a thin screen holding it back.

And the whispers… they were patient. Always patient.

“Join us,” they murmured. “It’s warmer in the shadows. We can show you.”

I told myself I was going crazy. I started keeping a diary, writing everything down, hoping that if I documented it, I could prove to myself it wasn’t real. But even as I wrote, I felt my words being pulled away, drained from my fingers. It was subtle at first, small omissions in sentences, missing letters, but I knew it wasn’t my brain making mistakes.

One night, it got worse.

I woke with a weight on my chest. Shadows spread across the room, spilling from the corners like ink from a bottle. They pressed against me, whispering my name over and over, their voices merging into a cold, endless chant. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. My body felt heavy, unreal, as if I were sinking into the mattress, the floor, into the shadows themselves.

Then I saw her.

My sister. But not my sister. Her shadowy form had wrong proportions, eyes too large, limbs too thin, and she smiled in a way I knew she never could. She leaned closer, and I felt her hand—cold, heavy, and empty—pressing mine.

“You are ours now,” she said.

I woke the next morning on the floor, drenched in sweat, my body aching as if I had been dragged across concrete. But the shadows persisted. Every corner of the apartment held a new figure, waiting, watching. I tried to leave. I really did.

But when I reached the door, I froze. My shadow on the floor didn’t follow me. It stayed behind, stretching unnaturally, merging with the others. And when I looked at my hand, I noticed the faint outline of my fingers disappearing, the edges blending into the darkness.

That’s when I understood what they wanted.

I wasn’t just being haunted. I was being consumed. Slowly. Every day, every whispered word, every night of suffocating darkness, they tore me apart, enveloped me in themselves.

I tried to fight back. I turned on all the lights, burned sage, played loud music, threw water into the corners where the shadows gathered. It didn’t matter. At night, they crept back, relentless. And with every encounter, I felt more of me disappearing.

The first thing to vanish was my reflection. One morning, I looked in the mirror and saw nothing but empty space behind my eyes. Then came my words. Speaking became harder. I would open my mouth, but sometimes no sound came out.

By the time I realized the truth, it was almost too late.

The shadows weren’t just imitating me anymore. They had started to replace me. I would see a figure in the corner—my figure—but wrong, distorted, smiling with my face. It moved when I wasn’t looking, practicing my life, preparing to step fully into my skin. And the more I resisted, the harder it pushed, faster, stronger, smarter.

Last night, I made my final mistake. I spoke to it.

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The shadows gathered, forming my sister again. Her distorted face gave me a malicious look. “Because it’s afraid of the dark. Because everyone fears what they cannot control. But we… are patient.”

Then she smiled. Not with lips, but with the stretching of the shadows themselves. And I felt the last pieces of me give way. My arms, my legs, my face, all of me melting, folding into the darkness.

Now, I am almost among them, almost part of them, whispering to anyone who dares stay too long in the corners. Waiting. Learning. Practicing.

I’m writing this as fast as I can… before I become one of them. I need to warn you. If you see your shadow moving differently than you remember… do not speak to it. Do not fight it. Do not look away.

Because those who live in the shadow are patient. And if you hesitate… they will take you, piece by piece.

I can feel you now. Watching. Waiting. The corners are hungry. The shadows are hungry.

And soon… they will have [you.](https://www.reddit.com/u/salty_Astronaut77/s/H0bIOt4bRN)
