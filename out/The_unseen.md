The unseen thing 


Two summers ago I just got out of school. Summer break. What a wonderful time it was. I didn’t have to think about school, homework or anything else that went with school. There was just one thing hanging in my mind. 


I just remember coming home that day and my parents were at work but something was off. What it was, I could not put my finger on. Not yet. All I knew is that something or someone was watching me. It wasn’t there when I left for school in the morning. I couldn’t see them or it but I knew it could see me. 


I brushed the feeling off. But a few minutes later it came back. I brushed it off again and it didn’t bother me for a few weeks. It was gone. At least I thought so. Now I’m not going to be bothered. 
Oh how wrong I was…


July comes around the corner and I have the feeling again. Now I can’t brush it off. It tortured me. I remember watching videos on YouTube and giving weird faces like someone else was there. Like I was reacting with someone else. 


August comes around the corner and school starts once again. The feeling dies off slightly but now I could feel it in school. Behind my back and out in a corner. 


September, October, November, December, finally January hits. I was curious now. A question lingered I’m my mind. 


Do I have paranoia? I looked up the feeling of being watched and it said paranoia. That feeling vanished quickly. It felt weird but I didn’t understand. It’s like I pissed it off. 
I didn't feel it until this year. This January again. I felt it. Now when I watched YouTube videos I gave weird faces and found myself talking to myself. To something. It got worse as February passed and March hit. It followed me everywhere. April, May clear into august it follows me. 


By now I’m tired of this. It got so bad that when I went to take a shower, I felt like the world was watching me. I couldn’t take showers for days sometimes. I was scared of being looked at. It’s like I was being mocked. There was something watching me. I knew it.  I knew it now. And how I knew was when I glanced in that bathroom mirror and saw a figure there for a second. I thought I was seeing things and brushed it off. Looking back now, that was something. I don’t know if it was whatever was watching me or not. 


Anyways September now hits. I had enough. It got so bad that I could feel something sitting next to me when I was on the couch. I felt it everywhere. I felt it watching me eat, watching me sleep, watching me go to school, get dressed and so on. So I downloaded my only hope. A ghost tracker app which takes pictures of ghosts. I set the app up.


 I felt whatever it was creep back in a hurry. It was something. 
Bring it in bitch. I’m coming for you. I pointed the camera in the area that I felt it. The app went crazy, beeped and showed where the location of this thing was.  I snapped a few pictures. It don’t want to get caught. 


It jumped around and stuff but I finally got it. I still felt the feeling after though. I checked through the pictures and everything looked normal. The next day hit and the feeling was gone. It never returned. 


It never has. 


From this day I still have a question day haunts me. 
What the Fuck was watching me and what did it want?
