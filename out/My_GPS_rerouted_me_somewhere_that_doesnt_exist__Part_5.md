The face didn’t move at first. It just stared at us from above — a flat, printed image that shouldn’t have been capable of expression. And yet in its face there was clear emotion, something like desperation or maybe pleading? 

I could feel the face’s eyes on me, conveying this weird begging look I could not understand. That’s when I noticed that the box began to wiggle ever so slightly… It was slow but it was moving.

Looking at Veronica, I realized she wasn’t staring at the same one I was. Her eyes were fixed on another box in a stack nearby.

Then I saw more.

Dread began to fill my body as these kinds of boxes were everywhere, randomly scattered across the stacks of cardboard boxes we walked near. Some of the faces held that same twisted look from before, while others were blank. It didn’t seem to matter where we were or how far we walked inside of the warehouse, they all knew exactly where to look in order to stare at us.

SPLAT.
The sound echoed throughout the stacks, a sickening wetness to it like something heavy fell behind us and burst open.

Veronica was the first to react, gasping in shock at the sudden loudness. I turned just in time to see one of those boxes burst open on the ground, its form a pulpy mess on the ground where it fell. I didn’t have a lot of time to take in the view however, as I saw more of the boxes writhe, twitch, and jostle themselves off the stacks they were a part of, cascading mounds of boxes all around us.

“RUN!” I shouted, my voice barely rising above the cacophony of sound exploding around us.

We bolted across the maze, stacks of cardboard collapsing behind us. Despite all the sounds — the wet impact from the faced boxes as they jumped off their stacks in an attempt to hit us, the thud of the stacks they supported falling apart from their absence. Each impact of the boxes raised with it dust and this indescribable smell that seemed to be between damp paper and rotting meat.

As we continued making our way through the maze we were faced with two branching paths ahead of us: one going left and the other going right. There were signs of arrows with what I think is a description written, just not in any language I could understand. I turned to look at Veronica only to realize she was already looking at me.

“Your call.” She said calmly, contrasting the panic and fear her eyes were showing me.

With the echoing splatters growing closer behind us I took us leftward, with no real reason behind that choice other than it just felt right ironically enough.

As we traversed the hallway the stacks of boxes gradually began to narrow and shorten, giving the impression that the space around us was getting smaller, tighter. 

After a while the boxes seemed less like boxes and more like… flesh, bending and folding in a way that cardboard wouldn't. This started to feel less like we are in a building and more like we are in a living being, something that ate us without us even noticing. 

We turned a corner— or at least it felt like we did, and came out onto a wider aisle which surprisingly smelled… clean, sterile in a way that reminded me of the “employees” of this place if you can call them that.

Before I knew it Veronica grabbed my arm, pulling me back behind a shelf. Her nails dug into my sleeve.

“Don’t move,” she whispered.

I was confused but quickly understood why she did that. At the end of the aisle underneath flickering lights I saw one of the workers, its skin tied so tightly around its lanky frame that parts of it were exposed, showing a sort of black fuzz where you would expect flesh to be. 

Scary as it was, what really got my attention is who the worker was seemingly talking to. 

At first glance I mistook it for a man — tall and gaunt, draped in what appeared to be a coat. But as my eyes adjusted I could tell that it was not a coat — not in the conventional sense, it was skin. All of the skin that should have been on its body was instead draped on it like a cape, long and pale skin just loosely hanging on its frame instead of covering it. Its limbs were even more repulsive, long and twisting, its joints bending in directions that didn’t make sense. While the area around us smelled clean there was a subtle aroma now— something sickly sweet, an oddly pleasant aroma which contrasted greatly against its repulsive source.

Its face was the worst part. I felt like I would've seen something slightly human, being its humanoid form and all but I was sorely mistaken. Its head was far too small for its lanky frame, with a singular eye in its center. 

The worker stood in front of the creature, posture rigid and with a clipboard in hand, as it opened its mouth and echoed:

“Hello Valued Customer, how can I assist you today?” The worker asked, more of that black fuzz from before leaking out of its mouth and dripping onto the floor.

The creature stared at it until its eyeball contorted, tearing and bleeding as it rearranged itself into a mouth. The words that came out of its mouth sounded coarse and strained – as if speaking were difficult for it to do.

“Same order. Fresher.”

“Why of course!” The employee responded enthusiastically, before continuing. “We have just received a new shipment, would you like to explore our options?” 

The creature nodded, returning the worker’s smile with its own, its mouth displaying a perfect set of human teeth. Something about seeing that smile filled my body with terror. 

The worker gestured down the aisle, and two more workers appeared from the shadows, carrying boxes — the kind with faces on them. The faces were awake, blinking slowly, their mouths twitching open and closed.

The creature dragged its hand upon one of the boxes which violently jolted in response, as if it were trying to flee. The creature released a sound that might have been confused with a laugh — just wetter.

“Good stock.” It said simply before grabbing one of the boxes from the workers, then analyzing the other box afterwards. “I’ll take them.”

“Excellent choice valued customer! We will prepare these for transport right away!” The worker responded gleefully, putting the clipboard away into its chest. “Thank you for your continued patronage, valued customer.” 

As the creatures walked away towards a door at the far end of the aisle I could feel Veronica shaking, her body trembling as she held on to my arm. 

We waited until the sound of their footsteps faded. The aisle felt emptier now, but not safer. My body was screaming at me to go, to get out of this place, but I knew that the only way out outside of the tunnel we just crawled through was the door those creatures went into. It was in that silence that both Veronica and I heard it — the unmistakable sound of those disgusting boxes dragging themselves towards us.

Veronica looked at me, eyes wide, pupils trembling.

“We can’t stay here,” she whispered. “It’s only a matter of time until those boxes start making noises and they come back.”

She was right. If we stalled in here too long those boxes would definitely get the attention of whatever the hell that thing was that we just saw, and I did not want that.

Looking at the door at the end of the aisle it seemed almost… normal? Just a regular framed door, which now that I think about it should not have been able to accommodate the height of those creatures. 

Trying not to think too much about it, I turned to Veronica and met her gaze. “That way,” I said quietly.

Before I could think twice, we started moving toward the same door the creature disappeared through.
