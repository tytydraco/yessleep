In the early days of our marriage, one of my husband and I’s favorite things to do was house sit for his parents.

Now, the house itself was perfectly ordinary.  It was large but cozy, with plenty of natural light, potted plants, and comfortable furniture in each room.  Bay windows in the kitchen offered an uninterrupted view of the deep porch and forested backyard beyond. Even the basement stairs, well-lit and adorned with warm red carpet, were welcoming rather than creepy. As an added bonus, our stays at the house came with Luna, their 80-pound pit-lab mix. Luna was an intimidating sight with her inky black coat rippling with muscles, but five minutes with her would reveal her to be nothing more than a sweet, spoiled cuddle monster.

Yes, the house itself was, all in all, utterly normal. It was what was beyond the house, I learned in time, that was somewhat less than inviting.

While each homeowner owned their lot, front and back, the neighborhood his parents lived in was on state land. Everything beyond the bounds of the property was protected; that meant densely wooded trails, streams, and lots of wildlife.  

To be clear, these woods were completely safe as long as you stayed on the marked paths, and we spent many afternoons exploring the trails. My husband loved to identify different plants and animals, pointing out mushrooms, turtles, and birds like jewels glinting in the dappled light. At the creek we would flip rocks, making a game of who could find the most salamanders. Luna loved to splash in the cool water and always managed to lap up a few gallons no matter how hard we tried to stop her.  

While my husband had a knack for picking out the tiniest details in the landscape, I was always the first one to notice deer. The neighborhood was absolutely overrun with them; they could be spotted grazing even in broad daylight, and we would happen upon at least a few of them each time we ventured out. My mother-in-law hated them because they ate her gardenias. I had no dog in that fight, but the sight of them—larger than you can ever seem to imagine and eerily silent—never ceased to unsettle me. Even on a bright summer afternoon, spotting a deer felt like stumbling upon a ghost, especially if stood on its hind legs. Fawns were all the more intimidating as they were only an indication of a deer that could see you without you seeing it.  

For those who have spent lots of time outdoors, you know as well as I that the woods are most active at dusk. This is true for the creatures you might expect, as well as the ones that skirt along the edges of our limited perception. 

Once, we managed to pinpoint the location of a Barred Owl, high in a pine tree, based only on the occasional sound of her calls. We stood side by side, eyes trained on her as the sun set, still as statues. I felt us gasp in unison when at long last she took to the sky, impossibly wide wings silhouetted against the great glowing orange. We watched, all three of us silent, as she glided all the way down to the forest floor. I remember the feeling then, like the cicada song echoing in the trees but all through my own body. 

Another time, we arrived home from Luna’s evening walk just in time to catch the neighborhood hare at the back gate. He stood straight up and stared us down with one red eye. An eternity seemed to pass under that beady gaze. Then just like that, he turned tail and disappeared without a trace into the underbrush. One second there, one second gone. He'd looked wrong, but I couldn't figure out why. It wasn't until later that I even registered the red dripping around his mouth and front paws.

Although eerie, the presence of most critters is nothing to worry about; it’s what happens after that you have to look out for. The hare, for example, we’ve come to understand as something of a harbinger of calamity. The morning after he darkened our doorstep, a station wagon was found wrapped around a tree one street over. Sad story; little old lady who had lived in the neighborhood for years, coming home from her son's house late in the evening. We heard from a neighbor that the windshield was smashed where she had been flung through it, cloth seats soaked with blood. Strange thing was what else was in the car; dirt, the neighbor said, and moss. No tracks, but something had left deep grooves in the driver's side door. Maybe it was the tree, maybe it was something else, although no wounded animals were found in the surrounding area.

Also strange—we were out with Luna at the supposed time of the accident. We should have seen, or at least heard, if a car so much as hit a curb. But we didn't remember anything out of the ordinary at all.

Yep, we discovered a lot about the land in those days, some through trial and tribulation, some via trail cams my father-in-law set up around the property, and some through good old common sense and intuition.

As the years went by, we started compiling a list of rules. For a long time, these were implicit between us and seldom even acknowledged aloud, beyond the occasional “Did you remember—?” “Got it,” to which all long-time lovers are accustomed. That is, until today, when I felt like getting a little something down for posterity, because let’s face it—we’re expecting. Some day sooner than we probably realize, our child will play in these woods, and to my way of thinking that ratchets them up from occasionally threatening to straight-up dangerous. 

All that being said, consider this my first entry to a sort of field guide for the area. In it, I plan to document our past experiences, new findings, and perhaps most importantly…

The rules: 

Each night Gerald the Southern toad visits the back porch. Take care to greet him and catch a few June bugs or fireflies for him to eat. There’s a second toad but she’s shy and rarely makes it past the steps to the backyard. She's nothing to worry about, but you must always greet and feed Gerald.

Be careful driving at night, especially in the rain; the deer aren’t afraid of much, and people and cars rank low on that list.

Although it is safe to walk the paved streets in the evening, avoid visiting the forested trails. You will get lost. Even with a flashlight, it's much easier than you'd expect.

If it thunders, Luna will want to go into the basement. You don’t have to go with her, but sometimes it’s best to keep her company. If she wants to go down and it hasn’t thundered, you’d do well to heed her warning anyway.

You don't have to do anything special if you see the hare, but be prepared for something in between unexplainable and tragic to occur.

Don't mess with fawns, food, or any unattended items you see in the woods (this goes for jackets, water bottles, camping equipment, etc.). At best it's not yours, and at worst, it's a trap.

Always lock the door behind you when exiting and entering the house.

And last but certainly not least:

Don’t shine your flashlight into the woods at night. 

I'll work on compiling a list of our current stories in the coming days. I'm also sure to collect some new ones soon—my husband's parents are going on an anniversary trip to Europe, and we are set to watch the house for the whole summer as soon as my school year wraps up. That means lots of time with just me, the dog, and the land (and I suppose our little guy or gal). For now, I need to part ways. Luna is in a state trying to herd me into the basement, and I just checked outside; there's not a cloud in sight.
