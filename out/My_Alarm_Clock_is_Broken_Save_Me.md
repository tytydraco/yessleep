Hello everyone. I’m in a bit of a predicament and could use some advice. Please bear with me, this will take some explaining.

For context, I’ve had nightmares ever since childhood. I've been plagued by them my whole life to the point where it’s just routine for me. When I lay my head down to sleep, I know that I’ll more than likely be greeted by a scene straight out of a horror movie. It’s not the worst thing in the world, and I suppose others have it worse than I do. At least, that’s what people keep telling me. 


And they’re right. When I count my blessings, they outweigh my nightmares. I have a healthy and functional body, a good job, and a caring family. Things that others would kill to have. That being said, I’d like you to put yourself in my shoes for a bit. Imagine that every night, almost without exception, you knew that sleep would be restless and disturbing. Imagine that something so routine, something you do every day, was a constant and inescapable source of dread.

I’ve looked for solutions in the past. I’ve tried it all- sleeping pills, therapy, meditation, diets. Hell, I even tried a nightlight. Nothing works. The best solution I've ever come across was one I found unintentionally. I got my wisdom teeth removed and they put me under anesthetic. The next 2 nights I had no dreams. It was amazing. But, it wore off and the nightmares came right back. I have no access to hospital grade painkillers and I had no intention of becoming an addict, so sadly that was off the table. I had come to just accept the nightmares and hope that they would either go away or get easier to handle with time.

Strangely, I could never really identify the source of my nightmares. Whether it’s some deep rooted trauma I have no recollection of or something else entirely, I truly don’t know. However, my nightmares do follow a repetition, though they are not entirely identical. In the dreams, I’m in an alleyway. It’s dark and filthy, but it doesn’t really have any characteristics that could allow me to identify specifically where it is. Either way I look, the alley has no end. It goes on and on for miles until it trails out of my view. Trash cans, dumpsters, and garbage bags line the walls of the buildings on either side. Just like with the alleyway, the buildings seem to have no end to them either vertically or horizontally. They trail into the sky without end and follow the alleyway to my front and back forever. In my dream, I’m running down this alleyway from something. I’ve never seen it but I can feel it. It’s that feeling you get in a dream where you do something that doesn't make logical sense in reality but in the dream it does. I just know that whatever is behind me, I can’t let it catch me. This goes on for a while. Sometimes I'll throw a trash can down behind me in an attempt to trip up my pursuer, but it never really matters. There is no end to this chase. The dream normally concludes with me either tripping and falling or the sequence of running will simply stop and I’ll jolt up in bed. Sleep has never been a friend to me.

About 4 months ago, I had a particularly awful night. As usual, my nightmare tormented me for a while until I woke up in bed, my heart hammering in my ears. It was still early, around 1 am. My heart was pumping like a rabbit’s and I could practically feel the adrenaline in my veins. I was wide awake now. Sometimes, on nights like these, I find it better not to attempt to go back to sleep. Instead, I’ll often opt to go on a walk. It clears my mind and calms me down a bit. So, on this night, I threw on a coat and some boots and stepped outside. It was a beautiful night- cloudless and with a moon so bright I didn’t even really need the street lamps to see.

I took my normal route; down my street, past my block, and into the shopping district. It’s strange to see a place normally bustling with people completely empty. It really does feel like the city itself is asleep. That’s what I like most about it- it’s just my thoughts and I. Every window was dark and the doors were closed. Some had neon ‘closed’ signs plastered by the doorways. All was as it should be- as it normally is. All, with one exception.

As I walked by the stores, I passed an alleyway, not unlike the one in my dreams. There was a light coming from it that I couldn't ignore, so I looked down the alleyway. There, tucked behind all the other stores, was a door. Above that door was a rustic wooden sign that read, ‘Fortune’s Toll Antique Shop.’ 

I thought maybe I was still dreaming, that my nightmare had simply gotten more complex. I had taken this same walk countless times and I had never seen that door. Curiosity got the better of me and I looked in the window. It seemed normal enough- a relatively small store with a quaint feel to it. Shelves of old antiques and a wooden desk with a clerk behind it. I figured, “Why not?” and went in. It was warm and had a nostalgic smell that I couldn’t place. The man behind the desk greeted me with a friendly,

“Good morning, sir. Looking for anything in particular?”

I responded, “No, thank you. I’ve just never noticed this store before and figured I’d look.”

He nodded,  “Well, feel free to browse.”

I thanked him and did just that. I perused the many shelves of what looked like old junk. I couldn’t believe that a business like this could exist. Who was buying this stuff? Don’t get me wrong, the store was charming in its own way, but I just can’t imagine many people are buying old roller skates or antique typewriters. After I had walked a loop around the shop, the clerk addressed me again, “It’s quite late to be shopping. Most people are asleep by now.”

I gave him a half hearted chuckle, “Yeah. I couldn’t sleep.”

His question seemed leading, like he was fishing for something, “No? Is this a common occurrence for you?”

I was hesitant but answered truthfully, “Yeah. Nightmares. Been having them as long as I can remember.”

His voice became almost cheerful, “Well, why didn’t you start with that? We can offer you the perfect solution.”
I nearly laughed. I had heard that before—some overpriced herbal tea, a so-called miracle supplement, maybe even a scam. But, before I could object, he had placed 2 objects on the counter in front of me: a long piece of paper and an alarm clock. It looked like one from a movie, with two little bells on the top.

He smiled at me, seeing my confusion,

“Please sir. I know what you are thinking. Every customer thinks the same thing at first. But read this first, before you do anything.”

He handed me the paper. It was relatively short. The writing was in black ink but it looked like it had been handwritten rather than typed. I don’t remember it word for word, but it was related to the clock. Basically, the paper said that the clock would cure my nightmares if I followed a sort of ritual with it. It also outlined a price.

I looked at him, “Is this a joke or something? A magic clock?”

“I assure you it’s not a joke,” he replied, the smile never shifting from his face.

He could see the doubt and annoyance on my face. He responded to it, 

“Humor me for a moment. You believe I’m lying to you, that the clock is just a clock and the contract is some nonsense I made up. If that is the case, what harm is there? All that will mean is that I’m letting you leave with a free alarm clock. And if you are wrong, I am offering you the best solution you’ve ever come across for your problem. One guaranteed to work.”

I paused for a bit. He was right, he wasn’t asking anything from me. And the alarm looked nice, if nothing else. It might even be worth something if I could find a collector. But one thing stood out to me,

“That contract you gave me. It talked about a price.”

He smiled, seeing that I was at least partly interested, “Ah, yes. You see, in order to get rid of something negative, you’ll need to give up something positive. It’s only once, and I can promise you it’s worth it.”

Still unclear, I asked, “Something positive? What do you mean?”

His tone was smooth as he responded, “Well, the clock will need to take a memory from you. A pleasant one. After that, it will also take away your nightmare.”

“This is ridiculous,”  I scoffed.

I turned to walk away, but I couldn’t. I know it sounds dumb, but again, put yourself in my shoes. I was desperate. And he had been right, it was free. With a sigh, I asked for the clerk’s pen.

With the same happy voice, he said, “You won’t regret it.”

I signed the paper and took the clock. It felt cold in my hands. The clerk took the contract. He bid me a good night, and I left for home.

By now, the sun would be up in only an hour or 2, so my test run with the clock would have to wait until the next night. I went through my day, sleep deprived and moody, until my shift ended and I went home. I didn’t even bother with dinner- I showered and went straight to my bedroom. I mentioned earlier that the clock came with a ritual. I suppose that’s a bit of a dramatic way to word it. The contract explained that I was to wait until right before I went to bed and then place the clock nearby. Tonight, on the first night I was using the clock, I was supposed to focus on a good memory until I fell asleep. For 2 nights following this, I was to leave the clock there. After, I was to put the clock away until I needed it again at which point I would repeat the process, excluding the part about focusing on a good memory. That was a one time thing. 

I did as the contract said. I put it on my nightstand, got under the covers, and thought of the first time I kissed a girl. It was when I had my first girlfriend in middle school. The kiss was awkward, as I’m sure every first kiss is. Honestly, I didn’t mind losing it.

I slept better that night than I ever had. Even better than when I had been drugged out from surgery. I woke up feeling great. I tried to focus on my memory, but it was foggy. Like someone had edited out a part of a video. I knew that information should be there, but it was just missing. I couldn’t believe it. That clerk really had been telling the truth.

I went about the next 2 days as normal, feeling more energized and happy than I had in a long time. After the third night of using the clock, I took it from the nightstand and put it away in a box in my closet. Still, the nightmares stayed away. My new, improved life went on, and I was overjoyed that my suffering had come to an end.

This lasted for about a month, at which point the nightmares came back. I again found myself running down that familiar, horrible alley from whatever was chasing me. I was saddened that it wasn’t permanent, but I didn’t let it keep me down. The contract had said that one memory was good for one nightmare, so all I had to do was sleep with it close by again for a few nights and I’d be sleeping peacefully again. I did just that, and it worked like a charm, just as it had before.

This time, the nightmares stayed away for twice as long. When they returned, I put the clock back in its place, and there it remained for 2 days. But, this time, I figured I'd push the rules a bit. Why should I have to suffer any nightmares? It's a magic clock, after all. How bad can breaking one tiny rule be? I decided to leave the clock where it was. Stupid, I know. But I hated that these nightmares were still a part of my life. I felt like they were taunting me, like I hadn’t truly beaten them and never would. This felt like a way to kill them, in a sense. 

And there was no trouble, at least not at first. In fact, it worked great. I didn't have nightmares for as long as it stood there. This went on for 2 weeks, when I woke one morning to find a crack in the face of the clock. I didn’t think too much of it, it was tiny. I convinced myself it had always been there. But the next day, the tiny crack had grown, new fracture points branching out of it like vines. 

That brings us nearly up to today. You see, recently, the clock hasn’t been working so well. The nightmares not just back, they last longer and feel more real. It’s like my dreams are clips from a movie, and they’ve always ended just before the climax. But now I’m seeing more of it. I saw it for the first time in my life. The thing that chases me in my dreams. It’s hard to believe my imagination conjured this thing up, I’ve never been particularly creative. It’s sort of like a bug. Maybe a mantis of some sort? But it’s much bigger, easily as tall as a street lamp, and longer too. It has the same claws that a mantis has, razor sharp and reach for me. But its body is more like a horse than a bug, and it’s a dark grey color rather than green. Oddly, it’s head is human. Rather, I should say its heads are human. It’s one head that constantly shifts forms and faces. One moment, it's a stern middle aged man, then a young woman, then a child, then an old man. They all wear different expressions, none positive. Pain, sadness, rage, disgust. And their eyes never leave me.

That leads me to my current problem. I don’t really know how to explain it to you, but I think I’m fading. Each day that passes I feel like less of myself, like I’m becoming translucent. Physically, I look dimmer I suppose? My eyes are duller than usual and my hair is lighter. My skin looks clearer too, like I can almost look through myself. Not only that, but mentally and emotionally too. Remembering things is getting harder and harder. And even my emotions feel dull, as if they’re only half present. 

The dreams are affecting me more than usual, too. During the day, if I zone out for too long or start to daydream, I find myself being chased down that dirty alleyway again. Even when I’m fully awake, my hair stands on end sometimes and I have an overwhelming feeling that something is after me, that I need to run. I can hear footsteps behind me when nothing is there, and I often feel exhausted even when I’m sedentary.

I took the clock back to the store, but the clerk only showed me my contract. No refunds, no returns. I have no idea where to even start with this. What’s happening to me and how do I stop it?
