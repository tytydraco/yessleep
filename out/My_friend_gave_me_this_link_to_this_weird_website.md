I know this is probably not the most usual thing to tell, but I have to get off my chest, but I think it would be right to start at the very beginning. It was just a normal day at school me and my friend were talking not sure about why I can barely remember it, but all of a sudden he froze and told me something.

“hey there’s this thing well more like a website that I feel like you would really enjoy it’s like porn hub but even better just trust me once you go on it you can’t get out” he gave me this piece of paper which looks like random letters and commas explanation point Just a whole bunch of random stuff the best way I could re-create it is “www.Keb.syn!osbe’aushwb.com“ that’s not it but that’s the best way I could describe it

but anyway, got home and ate my dinner. I didn’t tell my parents about it because well they’re probably just throw it out. Think it’s just some random gibbous, but after I went into my room when Dominic computer and typed in the link

but when I did something strange happened, my computer froze and slowly, but surely it was covered in glitch. Random saves colors, flossing just random things and eventually me trying to turn off my computer and not sure what the hell was happening to my computer the screen went black and then I was on. I think the main screen of the website I’m not sure.

on the top of the screen, it said the best thing you ever seen and then the middle said download, but like one of those sketchy download link, it was green and in white comic sands it’s a download and I wasn’t thinking so I downloaded it all of a sudden my entire screen went red and a small black circle was in the centre of the screen with a smiley face in the centre all of a sudden it spoke in a poorly recorded robotic it said “would you like to confirm your decision?” I tried pressing any of the keys, but nothing happened. I thought nothing would happen if I actually responded to it, but I tried.

in a nervous voice I said “I would like to confirm” after I said that the face disappeared and I was met with a series of videos something like YouTube, but they weren’t normal. The first one had the title. “necrophilia with my dead girlfriend” in the thumbnail was the face of a girl covered in maggots mold and whatever else the rest of the videos were similar to that with messed up titles and thumbnails

eventually, I got over them scrolling for videos like that so I decide to click on my thumbnail was something about a horse and a girl I didn’t pay too much to it it started with some random naked girl in a horse stable and eventually a horse comes in. I thought it was a horse, but it was some random guy with a horse mask.

The girl began screaming and begging for her life or something and that’s when I realized the guy had a chainsaw he turned it on and begin walking towards the girl with it pointed at her. I don’t want to describe what I saw next, but after that, he walked up to the camera and put his finger to where his mouth would be. I was disgusted with what I just saw.

I tried exit the website, but right as I was about to press the X it disappeared like it vanished into family. I tried clicking where it was originally, but wasn’t there couldn’t leave this website and as I was trying to leave, the screen went black again, and the same face was back, stared at me, so it disappeared.

it was just darkness for a couple seconds. I wanted to run away or just turn off my computer, but I was mesmerized. It was like I lost our control of my body and it was forced to stare into the darkness. then eventually, my ears were blasted with loud screaming. I tried turning down my volume. I even muted it, but it just got louder and flashing on screen was. Dead bodies did animals torture I’m not a nauseous person, but seems that may be one throw up and then eventually I know this some of the pictures were different. They were of my house. They were pictures of someone outside getting closer and closer and eventually the screen went black silent and then live stream started it was of my parents. It was recording from outside the kitchen window.

they were talking about something and I couldn’t hear it was muffled and eventually the person who in the camera ran around back zoomed in on my window and I saw a light and I realized it was my computer screen. I wanted to see if it was really my house could just be a coincidence someone with similar parents or something so I picked up a plushy. It was my favourite cartoon character, but it was in limited condition so not everyone would have it and I knew that so I threw it at the window and looked at the screen, when he bounced off the window and landed on the floor, the same thing of a plushy bouncy off the window

I ran over to my door and locked it. I couldn’t get my parents to safety fast enough, even if someone could find out where I live take pictures of my house and a live stream just for me being on it for 30 minutes and I watched the screen in disbelief I thought it could’ve just been a coincidence just a different house or something like that. I watched as the guy picked up a brick and It threw my back door he ran inside towards my parents right as he  was about to tackle them the live stream cuts off everything went dark I realized someone turned off the power, but my computer was still running, and the same face slowly appeared

but it was more real mystic I realized it was a real human face ear to ear his eyes and mouth we’re completely covered in shadow, but his face wasn’t picture looked like it was taken in the dark, but bright enough where you can make out some of the facial features and the exact same voice he said “I wanna play a game of choice, you will choose who lives and dies” and it switched back to the live stream, but both of my parents were strapped in chairs in my kitchen, and some guy was behind with the revolver he was wearing a mask

It was of the face turned into a mask two buttons appeared underneath my parents one said mom the over  said dad and above it said choose who dies, and the other will live I sat there silently thinking to myself I couldn’t go down there and try and help them. The guy had a gun, and I didn’t know if there were any more of them inside the house. I close my eyes and clicked one at random. I knew I had to choose, but I didn’t know which one. I heard muffle screaming, and a gun firing. I looked in the side. My mom was on was blacked out. I saw my dad at the chair, his eyes wide there was some  blood on his face and clothes.

I cried, thinking about how I just killed my mom and then the live stream ended. The face appeared again and had one final thing “pass on this website unless you want your dad to be next” and that is my attempt as a fiction story but do you wanna know what is not fiction a good website go check out “www.f&yejs,zhe!shsgxfceh?jdyebhd.com” if you enjoy fun and adventure.
