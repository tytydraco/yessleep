With this set of experiments I intend to create a light that emits the colour black, not in the sense of a traditional black light that projects ultraviolet light, rather attempting to project the absence of light. I intend to do this using a combination of different techniques, the first way I have devised is a relatively understandable method. 

Total blackness is typically experienced with the absence of light, you’re in a room with no windows and no electronic lighting or you’re walking in an area with no light pollution at night. What I am trying to do has previously been seen as impossible, an attempt to mold the nothing, the blackness into light that can cover an area in a cone of that same blackness even with secondary sources producing light.

The first method of producing the nothingness/blackness is unsatisfactory to my main goal and acts more as an illusion. The light box I plan to make first when activated dispenses an attached film in a cone shape that is light resistant. The film is made of carbon nanotubes ground down into a paste. This paste is then applied to loose human skin via a twelve day incubation process. The skin once properly made black would then be made into a cone shape and attached to the light box, the light box will inflate the skin causing the illusion of a black light.

The first experiment went as expected, the illusion worked and tricked the human eye but as stated previously this was not what I wanted. This “light” if you would even call it that cannot envelop other objects the same way traditional light can, this purely is a cheap trick. However this was helpful as a test run for some of the materials I am going to use for the real experiment. 

You could do this method just as easily without the usage of human skin, you could do it even with a balloon. This was very low level thinking but acquainted me with the properties of skin. I must clarify here that I acquired these materials ethically, all the skin used was taken from the dead and no-one was harmed in the acquisition process.

My main experiment is focused on the properties of the human body and how that can be used to create the nothing I am looking for. The skin is a connective tissue that amplifies the functionality of the human body, it’s a building block in the gift of life. Now this is where some particular detractors may start to see my method as less than scientific. However let me remind you of the great quote from Arthur C. Clarke “Magic is just science that we do not understand yet.”

The second solution to the nothingness problem is based upon my principle of life matter, the human body naturally excretes what I have personally coined as life matter. This is a highly malleable light that fills out from every human being, specifically human. When I walk down the street, I see a light, an invisible light coming from every human being. A light that whilst not black is nothing. I am attempting to recreate this nothing with dead skin and my method of soaking the skin in carbon nanotubes was one of those attempts however it did not come up with anything scientifically valid. 

**10/07/2024:**

I have tried many a scientific method and have come to a scientific conclusion. I have concluded that I cannot do this with non living matter. I’ve tried so many methods all of which I was certain would provide me with any sort of information on how the life matter operates but none the less I come up with nothing.

It’s not possible to create life matter, at least not with the limited budget I have, I’m on the verge of something truly innovative however and I can feel it. Whilst I’m getting nowhere with the skin I’ve been using, I am getting somewhere with my understanding of light. I initially theorised black light to be a shadow, a covering of matter. Now I see its truth, its a deletion.

I’m not trying to cover, I’m trying to consume, it shouldn’t be a temporary light it should be permanent. You can't undo a nothing, that’s illogical, but you can undo a light. I’m starting to think better, being an Edison is too small scale, I need this invention to truly surpass everything before it. I want to be a Jobs or a Musk, someone whose intellect is revolutionary.

**11/07/2024:**

I’ve done it, the method is so clear to me now. I need the life matter for any of this to work, it’s the only material on this planet that creates the nothing I need. We all see it every day, the thrum of life flowing from one person to another like invisible tendrils marrying each other to the nothing. 

I’m not a theologian I’m a scientist, religion tells you that soul, that life is light. Science says otherwise, my research proves that the soul is nothing, not non-existence but true nothing. I need someone alive to do this, raw life matter, I need to find a way to harvest it and I have.

I could use myself as the raw life matter but I’m higher than that, I want to emit the black light not be a component in it. My methodology is so simple I can’t believe I hadn’t yet considered it. You take the carbon nanotube paste I made, and I coat myself in it, not like my exterior but my interior. I create buckets of the paste and drink it until I can’t anymore. This should fill me with the substance and then I allow it to incubate inside me for I guess a day, the time really isn’t important. 

The important part of this is the genius I’ve done. So if life matter is produced by the soul, comes out from the centre of the body, then coating it with the paste should stop it from getting out, however that is not enough. I then need to introduce new life matter into my body via injection and consumption. The new light matter will be refracted by the black coating and my body will be the conduit of the black light. However I need a subject for this, I will update further when that has been done. 

**13/07/2024:**

The methodology has changed, instead of two subjects I’m going to use one to fill both roles, this makes it a closed system and helps me prove my findings more to the scientific body. My mother is senile and not all to put together, I would personally describe her at this point in her life to be a lesser being of sorts. Her mind is so addled with problems, her body barely working that she might as well be a lab rat. Yet this lab rat has the life matter I need.

It’s simple really, she won’t be able to complain much and she can barely talk. Tomorrow I plan to do it, it has to be done in one day as I worry the paste may end the existence of her fragile body. I also need to make sure the flesh is fresh enough to produce the life matter. She’s rather obese so I plan to carve sections of her stomach away, half of it I will use to blend and then inject, the other half I will feed to her through tubes. I expect a bit of resistance but I’ve purchased some medical anaesthesia  to make it easier. I’ll update with my findings in a couple days. 

**14/07/2024:**

The experiment went swimmingly, I have not yet seen the black life matter however the original life matter has stopped which is step one of the process. It was easy to get her in a place of lucidity for the experiment. Cutting her up took quite a bit of courage from myself and I’m rather proud of it. It created a rather horrific stench but I had nose pegs on hand to aid with that. Feeding her the chunks of flesh were easy, her lucid self identified it as any meat and happily swallowed it once I pushed it down the tubes and into her gaping throat.

Injections were tricky, I have never really done any sort of injection before so at first I struggled to find the veins. The first few times I was just injecting pockets of ground up flesh under her skin, which whilst certainly comical was not scientifically useful. I think I eventually found a vein so I’m happy with that part of the experiment now. My mother is yet to wake up as she blacked out during the injection process but when she does I’ll make sure to give my final findings. 

**15/07/2024:**

Some bad news for the experiment, she didn’t wake up and I believe she is dead but who really knows when you’re working with such ground-breaking science. I do not see the black life matter or any life matter at all. Her body is also very much rejecting the process. I tried to push some more of her flesh into her mouth without the tube but it got stuck pretty quickly, to the point where her mouth is now overflowing with it. 

I’ve had to move her into the basement as she was smelling too bad, the large holes from where I was injecting here have also started to leak out some reddish liquid from the flesh smoothie I injected into her, so my conclusion is that this experiment is a bust.

However I have a solution, part of my failings are because she was already dying, whereas a younger more full person may be able to handle the arduous process of the experiment. I’m thinking of using my daughter as she is very healthy and rather brimming with life matter, she’s twelve so should be able to handle it a lot better. I am however slightly scared as I have grown to like her in my non work life, but the scientific discovery I’m on the verge of is vastly more important than any harm this may cause her.
