I'm not sure why I'm telling this. Considering that not many might believe it. People call me crazy for even trying to explain what happened, but I have to! Or else my brain will rot from the experience.
So I'll start from the beginning. I'm a simple farm hand on a family-owned farm in Iowa USA. I won't tell my real name so just call me Beck. My boss was a slightly older man with a reddish brown beard and bald head. People never called him by his name so everyone just called him Pop.

Since he was known as a good father in the small town and not to mention. His farm was one of the biggest suppliers of popcorn in the country. He grew more corn than the average person. It was almost like an obsession. I sometimes asked why he mostly grew corn and not anything else. Pop always said that he tried but strangely nothing other than corn grew in his fields.
Nothing! He tried potatoes, beans, onions, and even something called rutabagas. But nothing grew from those fields. Just corn and more corn.

He didn't mind. It made the farm famous around the town. However, some older folks said he was too obsessed with his corn. He always was so serious about it and yelled at anyone who didnt appreciate his crop. This was odd but I looked passed it. I dedicated myself to helping Pop with running the farm. He mostly did the paperwork for the farm while I did the heavy lifting. He had a wife and kid but they were too young and weak to do the major tasks. He had a wife Jane who was one of the most beautiful women in the state. I heard she even won a few pageants when she was younger.
Some folks said she was crazy for settling down with a man like Pop. She said she loved a hard-working man so that was enough. They had two kids.

Sam and Ginny. They were a pair of twins who always seemed to get into trouble. Sam the rambunctious brother was older by five minutes. And Ginny the young girl who was the brains of the pair. They once broke the tractor by using it to do donuts. Pop always seemed to scold them for their behavior. While Jane always defended them saying that they were just kids.
They always treated me with respect while I worked on the farm. Strangely they always acted good around me and not their parents. They said I was like their big brother. The entire family treated me like family.

So what happened shook me up. It was a sunny October morning and me and Pop were preparing for the harvest. We had to pick acres of corn fields and ship them around the country. So it was a big job. Jane and the kids were in the barn feeding the animals when I heard one of them say
"look"! I don't know why but Pop and I sprang up and ran towards the barn. We went inside and saw Ginny and Sam covered in dirt holding a big ball of mud in their arms. At first, I thought they were just starting a mud fight...again. But no, it was a big clump of mud they found on the ground. "The dog dug it up," they said. Pop told them to drop it.
He was saying that it was just a clump of mud. But then Sam rubbed it on his shirt. Breaking the clump and revealing a hard center.

Upon further inspection, it was some kind of old bowl. It was an old one made of clay with some symbols carved into it. I didn't know it at the time but this would soon be the reason for the devastation to come. A few hours passed. The kids went to the creek to wash the bowl. Once cleaned it revealed more strange things. It had scratches all around the bottom and was slightly burnt. I asked them why they were cleaning such an old, weird bowl. They didn't respond but after a few minutes. They said that there was something that told them. Their tone alone brought chills.
What they said didn't make things clearer either it just made more questions. Then once they cleaned all the mud from the bowl. They ran towards the house on the hill next to the barnyard.

I ran inside too wondering what they had planned.
That's when I saw Sam hand the pot to Jane who was by the stove. She was preparing something in a pot. And I knew exactly what. The popping sound and the smell of butter gave it away. This farm's specialty. Popcorn! Jane then took the popcorn and put it into the weird bowl. Next, she put the bowl on the table and said "Eat up"! Then the kids raced and grabbed the bowl of popcorn. I didn't feel like eating. I was unsure about the bowl and why they even considered using it.

It was mysterious and very eerie in my opinion.
But they seemed to disagree. I knew they ate any leftover popcorn that was produced on the farm.
But they were erratic about it. They almost wrestled over the bowl. Jane stepped in and said to slow down but the kids just kept going. I asked Jane why she used the old bowl for popcorn. She said that it looked perfect for popcorn. This was strange since it was just an old bowl. And that Jane usually uses nicer bowls. Pop came in telling me that I needed to help him with something. So l left to go work. I kept thinking about what happened. The weird bowl, the kids going crazy over the popcorn they usually eat every week.
And what they said about being told to clean the bowl. Jane thought it was perfect for popcorn.

This stayed with me until nightfall. I fell asleep thinking about it until a loud yell woke me up.
"What the heck happened to my fields"!? I jumped from my bed and ran out to the fields where Pop was standing. That's when I looked towards the fields and I nearly fell backwards. The fields had rows of corn destroyed and ripped apart. They turned over and over like an uneven maze. We looked at the rows and found that the corn was eaten and ripped from the ground. The stalks and roots were yanked out and chewed.

Pop immediately called everyone asking if they saw or knew anything about the fields. Then he saw some dirt on the kid's clothes. And a few leaves in their hair. He asked them if they were the ones who destroyed the fields. They quickly responded that they were asleep all night in their rooms. That they didn't hear or know anything about the fields. Well, that didn't sit well with Pop.
He was a good father but he had to be strict sometimes. Especially when his livelihood was harmed. The kids kept telling him they didn't do anything but he didn't want to hear it. He sent them to their rooms. Jane tried to defend them but Pop didn't listen. He said, “The evidence is right there”! Sure it was a bit suspicious. But how on earth would they do this much damage? By the looks of it, an animal or something huge did this. Of course, I could be wrong. When I got a better look at the corn I saw what had to be human bite marks. And I'm not just talking about the corn itself. I'm talking about the entire plant. Many of the stalks that were eaten had a few chunks taken out. Soon I also found another strange thing. The ground was soggy and slippery. I nearly fell down. It wasn't wasn't water, no. It was something very familiar. I had to know for sure so I grabbed some with my hands. And I smelled it. I knew it! This stuff was all on the ground where the corn was destroyed. It was butter! Tons of melted butter. 

I didn't understand anything! What is happening to this farm!? A few days went by and things didn't get better. The kids started acting strange and avoiding everyone. I tried approaching Sam but he ran off quickly to his room. I saw he got something to drink. He had a cup in his hand. But I swear that it wasn't water or juice. It had the same yellow color as the butter I found in the fields. Another time I tried talking to Ginny but she didn't say anything either. But I also noticed something about her. Her clothes were different than usual. Her clothes were starting to look plantlike. They were a bit green with a design that looked like roots. It could be that she just wore something different but I had never seen her wear anything like that. Also, her hair was always as red as her father's. Now was turning green. With the tips a bit yellow. These changes didn't stop. They just got worse. And somehow neither Jane nor Pop noticed at all. While trying to work Sam and Ginny came over to offer some popcorn. In the same bowl, they found buried in the barn. I didn't dare take any. I was too suspicious and nervous. Sadly Pop wasn't and he took handfuls of popcorn and swallowed it whole!

 He was a man who loved his popcorn but this was ridiculous! Then of course he went through changes too. But his were worse! His skin started to turn pale and white. And his sweat was different too. His once normal human sweat was yellow. Just like the butter. This started to stain his skin causing yellow patches. And I hate to say this but. He started to smell good. Like freshly made popcorn. Finally, Jane noticed these changes and tried taking them to the doctor. But they ran into the fields which now took on changes too. The fields grew higher than any corn I've seen. And the rows of corn that were destroyed were now more straight and clean. Like a real corn maze. Jane and I ran into the corn maze trying to find them. The ground was still soggy from butter. What's worse is that it's old and spoiled now. Which made the maze very smelly and gross. After looking around for what seemed like forever I saw the kids walking by. I yelled at them trying to get their attention. But I soon wish I hadn't. Their bodies were completely different now! Their skin was bumpy and white. Their clothes and hair looked like the stalks and leaves of corn. And butter oozed out from their eyes and mouths that were hollow and dark! They soon started talking. “Hey, Beck why so sad”!? I looked back trying to answer when. “We can help make you feel butter”! Did they just say a pun!? It wasn't original but still made me feel chills. “We might sound corny but it's very fun”! Okay, that wasn't even a good one! Of course, I didn't tell them that. Then they started walking closer and closer. I walked backward against a wall fearing the worst. When I heard a scream! It was Jane! I quickly knocked over the kids who were now disfigured. And I ran towards where I heard Jane.

 There I saw Pop who sadly met the same fate as the kids. His skin was bumpy and his beard was green like his clothes. His eyes and mouth were hollow and dark like an empty void. He only muttered and didn't talk. Then His mouth opened to an impossible size. And then it came out! A yellowish-white goo that gushed out from his mouth! It covered Jane completely smothering her! Then it started to sizzle and I heard blood-curdling screams from the blob! That's when I realized what it was. Creamed corn! But it was very hot and boiling! Then The kids showed up and said “Hello Pop-corn”! Then Pop opened his mouth and muttered “B-baby corns”! Then He took Jane who was still burning in the creamed corn and swallowed her whole! She was screaming the entire time and i heard her say with a scared, sobbing tone.

 “Honey why”!? Then she was gone inside his body. Suddenly arms started to burst from his stomach which was bloated and bumpy. Then it burst into a puddle of butter. Then Jane emerged but not the real one. Now she was just as disfiguired as the rest of her family. She said “P-popcorn family”! I nearly threw up from the sight of her. Her once beautiful face now melted and white like half melted butter. Her hair now green and long like corn shucks. And her arms and legs now thin and brown like twisting corn roots. Then she screamed a high pitch sound that made my ears bleed slightly. I wanted to run but couldnt. They were the people who made me feel like family. They gave me everything. But they werent them anymore. They were monsters. Popcorn people. So I ran for the mazes exit! Running and turning trying to find any way of escape. Did the maze get bigger!? Did it change!? I didnt know! I saw some of the buildings on the farm. A shed, the barn, even the house where we lived. But they somehow were now inside the maze. Thats when i saw it.

 The bowl in on the kitchen table. It caused all this! It had to be destroyed I thought! So I grabbed a metal pot and hit it multiple times. But nothing happened. It just sat there scratchless. Then I took it outside and thats when I saw the family running towards me! I threw the bowl as hard as i could and it broke on the ground shattered beyond repair! Then the family burst into flames their butter soaked bodies perfectly flammable. They screamed in agony their bodies produced a poping sound! And they fell to the ground!  “Were glad you popped into our lives”! Those words made tears fall in my eyes. While watching the maze, the farm, and my family burn to ash. Their buttery and blood stained tears soon became smoak! Then they were gone. Thats when I fell to the ground and blacked out. When I woke up. I was in the barn. I looked out the window and saw the farm. It was okay! Like the fire never started!

 I looked for any signs of what happened. But everything was completely fine. Except for this. When i went into the fields. I saw them… The burned and butter covered bodies of Pop, Jane, Sam, and Ginny. All wrapped in corn shucks. And a note written in ash sat on them. It said “Anything can pop into your life so be careful”! “Too much can be bad”! “Obsession is no popping matter”! I was sick to my stomach and called the sheriff immediately. But when he got there he said. “Who, I thought you lived here alone”? I didnt understand I brought up Pop and his family but the police insisted I ran and managed this farm on my own! They never heard of Pop or his family.

So I showed them the bodies and they were gone. And to this day people call me crazy for telling this story. But I know its true! Is it? Yes! Maybe? But it has to or maybe not?! I-I dont know anymore! Wait what was I saying just now? Hmm never mind. Time to tend to my precious, precious, precious corn!!! Th-Theres nothing butter than cooking the popcorn er-I mean. Running my farm! Wait d-did I make a pun!? No,no,noooooo!
