Nick’s words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. Now we can finally talk about what’s next.

“What… what does that mean?” My voice cracked as I spoke.

He tilted his head slightly, his eyes locked on mine. “It means you’ve finally found it. I wasn’t sure how long it would take, but here we are.”

I felt frozen, my mind screaming at me to run, to get away from him, but my body refused to move. “Nick, this isn’t normal,” I whispered, clutching the box as if it could shield me. “This—this isn’t okay.”

He smiled then, but it wasn’t the warm, familiar smile I’d known for two years. It was something else—something cold. “You don’t see it yet,” he said, taking a slow step closer. “But you will. I’ve been keeping track, making sure everything is perfect. For us.”

“For us?” I repeated, my voice rising. “Nick, this is insane. You’ve been stealing my stuff—keeping a journal about me. What is wrong with you?”

His smile faltered, and for the briefest moment, I thought I saw a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. But it was gone in an instant. “You’re just scared. I get it. Change is hard. But I’ve been preparing for this for a long time.”

I backed up until I hit the edge of the bed, the box still clutched to my chest. “Preparing for what?”

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he reached into his pocket and pulled out something small and shiny. A key. He held it up between his fingers.

“This,” he said, “is for the place I’ve been working on. I didn’t want to show you until it was ready, but… well, you found the box sooner than I expected. It’s not exactly how I planned it, but that’s okay. We’ll make it work.”

“The place?” I echoed, shaking my head. “Nick, listen to yourself. I’m not going anywhere with you.”

His face darkened. “You don’t mean that. You’re upset right now, and that’s normal. But once you see it, you’ll understand. You’ll see why I had to do things this way.”

“I don’t want to see anything,” I said, forcing myself to stand. “I want to leave. Right now.”

The air between us grew tense, the silence stretching painfully long. Finally, Nick sighed and tucked the key back into his pocket. “You’re not ready yet,” he said, almost to himself. “But that’s okay. I’ve waited this long—I can wait a little longer.”

Before I could respond, he turned and walked out of the room, shutting the door behind him. I heard the sound of a lock clicking into place.

Panic surged through me as I dropped the box and ran to the door. I yanked on the handle, but it wouldn’t budge. “Nick!” I screamed, pounding on the wood. “Let me out!”

His voice came from the other side, calm and measured. “You need time to think. I’ll come back when you’re ready to listen.”

Footsteps faded down the hall, and then there was nothing. No sound, no movement. Just the overwhelming silence of the locked room.

I spun around, searching for a way out. The window. It was my only option. I rushed over and yanked on it, praying it would open, but it barely budged. He’d jammed it somehow.

My chest tightened as the weight of the situation sank in. I was trapped.

That’s when I noticed something I hadn’t seen before—a small camera mounted in the corner of the ceiling, its tiny red light blinking steadily.

My stomach churned as I realized he’d been watching me. Probably for a long time.

The blinking light seemed to mock me, and I felt a wave of anger rise through the fear. I grabbed the closest object—a lamp from his bedside table—and hurled it at the camera. It shattered on impact, and the camera’s red light died.

For a brief second, I felt a surge of triumph. But the sound of hurried footsteps outside the door yanked me back to reality.

He was coming back.

The footsteps stopped just outside. I backed up to the far wall, my breathing ragged, clutching a book like it could protect me.

“Nick!” I shouted, forcing my voice to sound stronger than I felt. “You’re insane! You need help!”

A low chuckle seeped through the door, sending shivers down my spine.

“Oh, I’m not the one who needs help,” he said softly. “You just don’t see it yet. But you will.”

My throat tightened as the door handle jiggled.

“I don’t need the camera,” he murmured, almost lovingly. “I’ve been watching you long before that. I know exactly what you’ll do next.”

The handle stopped moving, but I could hear his breathing now. Close. Too close.

And then, so softly I almost missed it, he whispered through the crack in the door:

“You’ll never leave me.”
