**Friday, August 1st, 7:30 pm**

Day one of our plant festival. Mr. Shriner hired some teenager to watch the shop this weekend so I could do the kettle corn stand. However, I feel like it makes more sense to hire the kid for the kettle corn and leave me to my air conditioned shop. Safe to say, not into it but whatever.

So, I dressed myself in as much linen as possible, gave Demeter some extra kibble and headed out the door early to set up. Because Mr. Shriner is a traditionalist, I had to load 2 huge copper kettles into the truck of my car and hope my strap job stopped them from bouncing out. When I pulled in, Markus and Cami were just starting to unpack their car as well so we chatted for a moment.

Cami makes the crystal sun catchers remember? Her table is always some form of divination, but she switches it up every year. This year, she went with palm reading and pendulums.

I don’t think I’ve introduced you to Markus yet. He’s a younger guy, works at the elementary school as the gym teacher. He does the muscle work for the fair. Setting up tables and booths, moving stock, all the things you’d expect from a young buff meathead. I say that with love of course, but he’s closer to being a camp counselor kind of man then your stereotypical jarhead gym teacher.

I helped Cami pop up her booth while Markus McMuscles moved the kettles to my stall for me. By the time he came back, Cami was set up, and Markus and I were all soaked in sweat. I said my goodbyes and tootled off to finish unpacking.

After several trips to the car, I got everything to my booth, started to put it away, heat up my kettles all the fun stuff.. So I get the gas going and turn around to set out my kernels and my flavors, and I managed to only grab what I needed for caramel, not Jed Mei’s snow. I still don’t have a clue where that comes from or what flavor it is. Maybe it’s white like snow?  If we would have stuck with caramel and cinnamon-caramel, this wouldn’t be an issue but I digress. So day one is only gonna be caramel flavored.

Things went really well for a few hours. The mayor did her speech to open the festival, and the rides all started in a jarring scream of calliope and neon lights. Kids came up with their pocket money or their parents credit cards and walked away with bags of kettlecorn as big as they are. I seen some happy customers leave Cami’s tent, and even Rooter showed up for a few minutes. He stopped in and bought a bag to take to Sara and Loretta before heading to the cemetery.

Then things went weird. *oooOOOooo*. Realistically, I think it was heat stroke. It’s August.

So the festival is set up in the center of town, in a large paved plaza. In the middle of the plaza is a huge statue that’s been here since the town was founded. Not of the founder, like the one in the simpsons’ mind you. It’s a carving of a huge tree with the front of it missing. Kinda like a doorway you know? There’s a figure standing in that doorway, wearing long robes covered in leaves and a mask that looks kinda like this little tree guys from legend of Zelda, with a little branch kicking off the side and everything.

Karen and her husband were selling her oils across the plaza from me. I could see their table, and they didn’t have a gazebo or anything to keep the sun off of them. Her husband has been steadily sipping tall boys all morning, so he was at the very least buzzed. Karen was putting drops of some oil in every time he looked away from a new can. What was she putting in their coffee last week? Jamsonweed for mental clarity or something? I don’t think that’s going to negate the whole pounding beer all morning but whatever.

By noon, he had finished a six pack, and I didn’t see him drink anything else. So Ralph is sitting there, mildly buzzed and listening to his wife chatter when his eyes begin to bulge out of his head. He starts to mumble, trying to get his wife’s attention as he pushes back in his camping chair. Karen; in the midst of an ever important sale, ignores him until he goes “ass over teacups” as my mom says. Ralph flipped backwards in his chair, throwing his beer away from him in the process. He lands flat on his back, and keeps trying to push himself away, pointing at something in front of the table. Karen finally gives him attention, and tries to help him off the ground but he kept pushing her away, trying to crawl away until he backed himself against a tree. A few people rushed over to him, so my view was blocked but I could hear him start screaming. Something about redemption and reclamation of what is owed. Someone called an ambulance as soon as he started to vomit a black gooey stuff and started seizing. They rolled him on his side, and someone held Karen out of the way. Bless her, she was so scared.

It didn’t take long for the ambulance arrive thankfully, and they were both loaded in and taken away before he got worse. He hadn’t drank or ate anything but beer for hours, sitting in the hot August sun, so it’s not terribly surprising he got so sick so quick. I hope he feels better soon though.

Cami and I packed up Karen’s table for her and put it in her car. I scribbled out a note saying I had her keys and her purse and to call me when she’s ready for them, but if I don’t hear back tomorrow I’ll give a call.

The rest of the day went well beyond a weird vibe hanging in the air. I sold out on corn about an hour before anticipated, so I took a stroll around the other booths before I packed up. Ended up buying a new toy for Demeter and a cute cigar band ring for myself. It looks kind of like Rooter’s now that I look at it.  But the carving is an eye with a lil flame in it and the stone is a transparent orange instead of a deep green tree. It almost glows, isn’t that neat?

**Sunday, August 3rd, 2:39 am**

Is heat stroke contagious? Can heat stroke cause mass hysteria? Today was fucking nuts. I don’t know what happened but I lost my mind again. A lot of us did.

So I got up, got ready and left at the same time as yesterday, but I remembered Mr. Mei’s special blend this time. I even grabbed an extra bag of corn since I sold out early yesterday. Karen’s booth is gone when I arrived and someone else took her spot selling custom tumblers and those 3D printed dragons. Her car was gone too, but I still had her keys so she must have parked in a bad spot and got towed. I heard her husband was still hospitalized, so she’s probably not too concerned yet.

So, rinse and repeat of the process yesterday. I start to heat the kettle, unpack my supplies, say hi to Cami (who brought me a saffron latte. I could kiss that woman) and Markus, and start popping corn. I did up a batch of caramel first and bagged that, hanging it on the hooks by the window. Then I popped open the cartons of Jeb Mei’s snow and my entire field of vision is covered in this tacky, off white powder that smells like… composting plants is the closest I can get you. It was absolutely disgusting and stuck to everything it touched. So I get that batch going and try to wipe everything clean but the powder just kind of transfers to my gloves so I keep having to change them. I blow through a pile of gloves in five minutes, but I did manage to get things cleaned up. So I bag up our mystery flavor, and hang that up in my windows for display.. Things are ok, maybe a bit warmer than I would have liked. I start selling bags of both flavors, things are great.

I sell out of the first batch and start on the second when my hands start to tremble a little. Ok, it’s hot, so I start chugging my water and get back to work. Across the plaza, I hear a rattling scream. Then another, another, and another. When I look up, there’s several small pockets of people on their knees, screaming and collapsing to the ground, frothing at the mouth or gawking at the heavens above. Their friends watch in horror as they writhe around.

I glance over at Cami, and she’s on her knees, her face raised to the sky, just like everyone else. I try to rush over to her in case she starts to seize too but my legs won’t let me move. I drop down just like everyone else, staring up to what should be clouds, but instead is the greasy ceiling of my booth.

Cami starts to shriek, joining the horrid harmony of the poor other souls.

Being on the floor, I can’t exactly see anything even if my legs would move but I feel like I can hear everything around me.

The screaming starts to turn into a droning hum as people congregate in the center of the plaza around the big statue. They sort of congeal around it and their sound begins to change from that communal drone to speaking in tongues and begging for redemption.

My legs start to twitch under me, as if they have a mind of their own. I start to stand, being pulled to the statue myself. As I approach it, I feel the air vibrate, pulling me closer to it, until I’m trying to push myself through the masses at the marble base to touch it and praise her. Cami is on my left, a shambling mess covered in…. Soot? Why does she have soot bleeding out of her nose? They all do.  I jerk my head down to see the front of my shirt covered in soot and ash. *We* all do. A spark climbs up my spine, jerking my head back up towards the statue. I meet her eye, and begin to beg. I didn’t know the statue was a woman, but *she* felt like a benevolent soul I must appease.

The tone of our congregation suddenly shifts, and people are pulling each other out of the way, trying to touch it. I watch my own hands grab the collar of the woman in front of me and pull her to the ground. She sells earrings a few booths from Karen. I quickly take her spot, leaving her lying on the ground in this undulating mass of limbs and soot.

Someone pushes up behind me and I hear a sharp crack before the woman releases a feral scream that quickly peters out. *We* don’t care. No one stops to help her. We’re fighting for the right to touch the base of this weird statue.

As soon as my fingers graced the marble base, a surge of power that felt ancient and earthy launched up my arms and sends me into a frenzy. I clammer back into the crowd, letting the people behind us get a taste if they can manage to stay upright. If they fall, they’re underfoot and probably stepped on. With no control over my body, I rush for the nearest structure and begin to claw at the siding, trying to tear it apart with my bare hands. I think it was an enclosed gazebo where teenagers hid in to smoke pot at night. The wood planks had that plant smoke smell embedded in them and it felt like an offense to *her*. I don’t even know who *she* is but I needed to please her. I keep tearing at the boards until something becomes loose and falls to the ground then I move to the next one, this dryadic power telling me to destroy the structure because it’s an offense to *her* and what she’s provided for the town. I hear someone next to me, trying to do the same to appease *her* and win her favor. My body begins to grow heavy and slow at this point, and I think I blacked out.

When I came around again, it was dark outside. The streetlights had come on, and the entire plaza was absolutely destroyed except the statue. Booths and tables had been flipped, the gazebo was missing boards and covered in dark wet streaks. Something had been on fire at one point, but now it was just a pile of smoldering ashes, the smoke hanging in the air. Hopefully unconscious bodies are scattered around, some twitching a little and some totally still. The woman I had pulled down is still in a crumpled pile at the base of the statue, and I couldn’t bring myself to go see if she’d alive or not.

I pushed myself to my feet again and try to stay upright but my entire body feels like it’s on fire. My fingertips feel raw, I’m down at least one finger nail and maybe a few fingerprints entirely. I all but crawl to my car and climb in, patting around for my keys. Despite the utter chaos of the day, my keys never fell off my belt. This is why we have carabiners people. I crept home, grossly under the speed limit until I pulled into the back of the shop. I drug myself upstairs and crashed on my couch with Demeter on my chest for a few hours.

I just woke up again, and I needed to write this down. This entire day was fucking crazy and I don’t know what happened but I’m not the only one that lost my mind. Enough people went nuts and caused destruction, we hurt people and someone started fires. The plaza was an absolute mess and I have no idea what caused it. I don’t know why we wanted to touch the statue. I don’t know who she is. I’m scared.  I’m going back to bed.

**Sunday, August 3rd, 9:48 am**

The festival is canceled. But not from the mass hysteria or anything. There’s now an open investigation for embezzlement on the planning committee. And get this… The plaza is totally untouched. The gazebo is fine. No scorched piles of something. No people laying in the grass. All the ash and soot and everything is gone and sparking clean. But I’m still missing a goddamn nail. I don’t know what’s happening.
