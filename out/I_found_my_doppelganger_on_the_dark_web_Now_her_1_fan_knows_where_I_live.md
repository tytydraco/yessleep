When I awoke, it was to the sound of a scream. The noise tore me straight out of a nightmare about the white room; I remember sitting bolt upright, unsure as to whether the sound had come from myself or someone else. When a few seconds passed without further commotion, I decided that it hadn't come from a human at all, but instead an animal or even a passing car. 

Whatever the case, I was wide awake, and so I grabbed my laptop and almost instinctively navigated to DOV3S. Checking my email, I saw that I had not yet heard back from either the police or the IC3, but I had expected as much. So little time had passed, after all. What I had *not* expected was the reply that I received from Adam, which he had sent just after midnight.

**\[Adam\]**

*Ok. Let's talk. You're going to school at \[REDACTED\], right? I live around 90 minutes southwest from there. I don't have a car right now, but if you want to talk in person and you have time to kill, we can meet up in my town.* 

I was pleasantly surprised that he'd come around, though I wasn't exactly sure what had changed his mind. Seeing Mary's missing persons report likely convinced him that there was real danger in what we'd discovered. Desperate for answers and itching for something to do while I waited for the police, I accepted his invitation. Seeing that Adam was online despite the early hour, I gave him a call, although he quickly declined it. 

**\[Adam\]**

*I can't talk right now.*

**\[Me\]**

*Sorry. I guess it's still early.*

*I'm happy to meet you and I don't mind driving out.* 

**\[Adam\]**

*Cool. Let's not do a cafe or restaurant though. I don't really want to be overheard. There's a trail near my house where we can have some privacy. I'll send you the address of the trailhead if that works for you. Can you do 6:30 PM?*

**\[Me\]**

*Yeah. I can do any time today really.*

**\[Adam\]**

*Make sure to bring your phone and laptop and any other electronic devices you've used recently.* 

**\[Me\]**

*On the hike?*

**\[Adam\]**

*I was hoping we could go to my place after. I'll explain in more detail in person, but I have some theories about how the deep fakes are being made and need your help to test them out.* 

*Sending the address now.*

Making a plan gave me comfort, and after Adam and I finished working out the logistics of our impromptu get together, I managed to catch a few more hours of sleep. I then spent the late morning attempting to distract myself with schoolwork. When that failed, I returned to Tor. Instead of going straight to DOV3S, I searched for the forums that Adam had mentioned.

I did find one relevant conversation on *MirrorFrame*, which seemed like a website for rehosting lost or banned videos. "Help ID the actress in this vid?" read the title of the post. Attached was a twenty second clip from one of Angelica's videos. *Puncture 12*, I realized. I had spent so long staring at the sample images that I could recognize this particular video from the lighting and framing alone. I think it was this, the fact that I'd become so familiar with this content, that frightened me even more so than the video itself, which featured "Angelica" getting stabbed in the calf with what looked like a marlinspike. 

This particular clip of *Puncture 12* had audio. Unlike Angelica's sample video, which had been all grunts and sobs, this video actually had dialogue. She didn't say much, but the few words that Angelica said, she said in my voice. Somehow, hearing myself beg someone to stop hurting me made me far more nauseous than the deep fake visuals ever had. 

The only vaguely positive thing about the thread was the single comment:

*good luck! the DOV3S team is extremely private. 0 info about the models. i'd be surprised if that girl actually exists.* 

I used my phone to take a video of *Puncture 12*, then set my laptop down. I had learned two new things from the forum:

The first was that whoever was behind DOV3S had access not just to photos of me, but to recordings of my voice. This eliminated some of my earlier suspects, including the modeling agent from my teenage years. While he would've had enough content of me to make a deep fake, I never met him in person, and I never sent him any video recordings of me speaking. It would have been impossible for him to replicate my voice so convincingly. 

My second epiphany had to do with the sole comment on the thread. For whatever reason, DOV3S' maker was protecting my true identity. If this were someone who hated me personally, they would *want* to put me in danger. They would *want* their crazed fans to know exactly who I was. I couldn't reconcile the malevolence of their actions with this small saving grace. 

Inspired to continue my search, I punched in DOV3S' url and waited. And waited. And then waited some more. Eventually, I got the generic "Onion site not reachable" screen, no error code, no redirect. I refreshed. Nothing. I waited a few minutes. Nothing. I reopened Tor. Nothing. 

The site was gone, at least temporarily. I wanted to be optimistic and believe that the FBI had taken them down after my complaint, but I doubted it. It was more likely the case that they'd relocated to a new .onion address or rotated to a fallback link, but why? Did they know someone was onto them? Was it something Adam had done? 

I spent all afternoon trying to find out where the site had migrated to, but it was hopeless. I left my apartment at around five, and the minute I walked out the door, I was overcome with a sense of relief. Looking back on it, I had felt sick all day, but I hadn't entirely noticed until I stepped outside. 

Due to traffic, I didn't arrive at the trailhead until nearly seven. As soon as I parked, I received a text message from Lydia. 

***Lydia:*** *No creep today, but I still think you should sleep at my place tonight. Don't like thinking of you alone in that apartment.* 

***Lydia:*** *Btw I told Ben what's been going on and he says he thinks he saw the guy get into his car yesterday. He said it was a Jeep Cherokee XJ.*

Reading that made my gut churn. Of course, I'd already suspected it, but the confirmation that Angelica's "fan" knew where I lived was horrific. I decided that I'd sleep in a hotel that night, only briefly swinging by my apartment to grab a change of clothes. I also resolved to visit the police station in person the next day to see what could be done. I texted Lydia my plans, then focused my attention on my meeting with Adam. 

The hills were a beautiful little swath of nature, quiet but not too isolated from the city. There were a few other cars in the parking lot and a few people walking their dogs. I did not, however, see anyone that looked like Adam. I messaged him that I had arrived, and he quickly replied.

**\[Adam\]**

*Cool, I'm on the trail. Make a left at the first fork and I'm sitting on the bench.*

I got out of my car and started to walk. It was a warm evening, and under any other circumstances, I would've been delighted by the balmy breeze and colors of golden hour. I walked up the trail for a few minutes and saw the fork in question. I looked to the left, but thanks to the curve of the trail, it was difficult to see very far ahead. 

**\[Me\]**

*Hey I'm at the fork.*

**\[Adam\]**

*Take the trail on the left.* 

**\[Me\]**

*Can you come down*

I waited for a few minutes. Adam kept starting to type, then stopping. The sun was starting to set at that point, and I didn't want to be on an unfamiliar hiking trail after dark if I could help it. I gave Adam another call, but once again, he immediately declined.

**\[Adam\]**

*Walk down the trail on the left.*

**\[Me\]**

*Why can't you just walk down and meet me here? You're freaking me out*

**\[Adam\]**

*I'm like 30 ft away from the start of the trail it's fine*

**\[Me\]**

*I don't see you*

**\[Adam\]**

*But I see you*

I looked up from my phone, startled. There was no one else around, not even up on the ridges that overlooked the trailhead. No way in hell was I going any further up that trail. I waited around dumbly for a while longer, then decided to call it a day. As I turned around and started walking back to my car, I heard a man's voice say my name. I froze for a minute, whipping my head back in the direction of the trail. I opened my mouth to respond, but when I still didn't see anyone, I closed it and ran back to my car, thoroughly spooked. Though I didn't see anyone following me, I started the engine immediately and began my drive back home.

The entire way back to my apartment, I felt like screaming. That whole meeting had either been an elaborate joke or worse, a setup. I considered the possibility that it was Adam behind the deep fakes. He was a software engineer and certainly had the technical know-how to create them. He had been strange and standoffish throughout every one of my interactions with him and seemed to have something to hide. He grew up in my town and easily could've lied about knowing Mary. Despite all of these factors, though, he was missing a motive, and furthermore, he himself was a victim. 

When I got back to my apartment building, before getting out of my car, I scrolled through my message history with Adam. Not only had his perspective on DOV3S changed since the day prior, but so too had his texting style. It was subtle, and it could've been explained away by him typing on a computer vs a phone, but the texts he had sent me that day felt more formal. Better grammar, fewer sporadic line breaks. Maybe something had happened to him the day before. Maybe the Adam I was texting on that day was not the same person I had been texting previously. Again, it could've been a coincidence, but I still planned to bring it up with the police the next day. 

I went inside of my apartment after that, dejected and exhausted. Every new "lead" I had uncovered only brought me more questions, and now I couldn't even unwind in the comfort of my own home. That heavy, nauseous feeling I'd had all morning returned in full force once I stepped into my apartment and turned on the lights. I planned to use the bathroom, grab a few things, and make my way to the cheap-ass Motel 6 uptown. I threw my bag down, grabbed my phone, and headed to my miniscule bathroom.  

It was pretty stuffy in there, so I decided to let in some air. Putting both hands on the frame, I noticed that the latch was undone. Had I forgotten to lock the window the night before? I could have sworn I locked it. The thought of sleeping with an unlocked window while someone was actively stalking terrified me, but it was nothing compared to what happened next. 

I opened the window, and the bathroom was filled with a *screech* that sounded exactly like a scream. I knew instantly that it was the same sound I'd heard in the morning, the one that had awoken me. 

Someone had opened my window in the night. What if he had let himself inside?

What if he never left? 

Suddenly, I got the sense that I was not alone in my apartment. Quickly, I locked the bathroom door, then tried to listen for movement over the deafening pounding of my heart. I thought I heard the faintest sound of fabric rustling, and my every nerve screamed in response. *Get out*, they said, and I listened. I threw the window open all the way and jumped out. Before sprinting down the street, I stole one last look into the bathroom, just in time to see the handle turn as someone tried the locked door. 

After that, I ran like hell to the first open, public building I could find: a 24/7 convenience store a quarter of a mile from my place. I phoned the police from inside, and when they arrived, I told them about everything—DOV3S, the customer, Mary, my strange encounter on the trail, my suspicion that something may have happened to Adam. Thankfully, they took my words very seriously, especially since I had already started a paper trail and since I had several witnesses from the cafe to back me up. Before they took me down to the station to file an official report, they escorted me back to my apartment and searched the place. There was no one inside, but the unlocked front door and the plethora of stolen items, everything from my diary to some of my clothes, made it pretty damn obvious what had happened. 

I booked a flight home that night and left town the following morning. I was never close with my parents, even less so after the shit they put me through as a teenager, but I desperately needed an escape. If I had it my way, I would've packed up and moved to the middle of nowhere and never been seen by anyone ever again. Since I couldn't do that, I retreated to the only place I could think of—my hometown, the place where all this DOV3S business seemingly began. If nothing else, maybe I could finally find the answers I was looking for there. 

I watched the sunrise from 40 thousand feet in the air, and the sight soothed me tremendously. I looked down at my phone, swiping back and forth between two screenshots that I'd sent myself—one of Adam's selfie, and one of Mary's. I studied them like a mother whose adult kids had long moved far away from home. There was a terrible ache in my heart as I thought of all they’d likely been through, and the fact that I didn’t know if either of them were safe at that moment. 

*I'm gonna find out what happened to you*, I thought, not a wish, but a promise.
