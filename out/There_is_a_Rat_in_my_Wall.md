My name is Simon MÃ¼ller and there is a rat in my wall. It has been in there for the last 3 months and it should be dead. It should have starved by now or at least gotten through, but it hasn't. It's just been clawing through the wall for the last three months and I can't sleep.

I don't actually know if it is a rat, I've never seen it but it's there behind the wall.  I don't even know if this has only been happening for the last three months but that's around when I lost my job. It's big and I can hear it bulbous body squeezing through the space between my walls. I don't know if any of you can actually help me, but I just want it to stop. I want to get my life. I don't know if I can say I want my life back, but I want my life. I want to close my eyes and not hear the clawing through my wall.

I don't remember exactly when it started, or why I would deserve this. Maybe the rat was always there, but that can't be the case as I remember sleeping. I know there was a day that was normal. I was working at my job at the animal shelter. There was a couple of sick dogs and a cat that had to be put down. The dogs were sickly and ridden with worms but I loved that part of the job. The man who brought them in was nowhere to be seen. I lost that job, couldn't keep up with my work. I went home that day and cleaned my closet. It was messy but not more so than usual.

Then, when I went to bed that night I was woken up halfway through the night. I didn't even know why I had awoken, but when I strained my ear I could faintly hear a noise. I thought it was the groan of the house so I went back to bed. It didn't stop though. A rhythm made to torment specifically me.

When I was a child, I remember seeing a rat in the school field. I had been scouring through the grass and had found a piece of plywood by the edges of the yard. When I lifted it up, a sickly rat pounced at me and bit my wrist. I remember the school bully, James I think, telling me that I had rabies. I washed and scrubbed at the spot on my wrist with soap. I cried and clawed at the wound until the injury went raw. I still have a scar there, not from the rat but from the washing. Maybe that's when it started? But that wouldn't make sense.

By the end of the week, I realized what it was. It was more distinct now, determined in it's path. Before I even went to bed, I could hear it digging through the wall. It was centered directly above my bed. It was perfectly centered as if it knew, I bet it did. I knocked on the wall to try and scare it off but it didn't deter the thing. I had a hard time falling asleep that night, I feared it would break through and fall on my face and bite me. I wish it had gotten through. I dreamt that night of claws and fur. When I woke up and still heard the thing, I decided I would call pest control to come have a look.

Was there ever really a time before the rat in my wall? There had to be, I don't remember a time without the clawing but I remember having a job and sleeping. Do I remember a time where it did not speak to me in it's language of claws and teeth. Telling me that it understood me and just wanted me to understand it. With the gnashing of teeth and the gouging of drywall, telling me that it loved me and I loved it.

It clawed towards me every second of the time I was waiting for them to arrive. I flinched when I heard the doorbell ring. It was the first pest control operator, I don't remember his name. He might not have even given it. When I went to show him to the wall the rat was digging though, he didn't understand. The rat had gone silent. I had heard it every moment leading up to answering the door, but it had stopped. Still, he looked around and set up a couple traps in hopes of catching it. As he left, I cursed at him silently. This thing was smarter than poison. The instant I closed the door, I heard the rat resume it grand quest of torment. I didn't try to even get the pest controller, I knew it would be useless.

Did this start when I had found the dead rat behind my school in seventh grade when skipping class. It's corpse bulging after the week of rain. When it writhed and squirmed from the inside. I watched it sit there with it's sagging and undulating form. I'm not someone who is obsessed with death, but it was hypnotic. I stared at the rat behind the dumpster for the rest of the day.

By around the end of the month, I knew this was something more than a simple rat. It had been digging every day and had not broken through the wall. I decided to call an exterminator, they would kill this rodent along with any other skittering thing in my house. Same as last time, the exterminator arrived to the silent house. The rat was smart and knew how to best torture me. I assured him that despite there being no evidence, that there was a rat. He didn't care, bet he thought I was crazy and could get a few hundred bucks out of me. Maybe I am insane. I stayed in a motel that night and could swear the rat had followed me. I assume it was another rodent, it was a motel and was bound to be infested.

I got the call from the exterminator and he assured me that if there was a rat inside, it was dead. No body to claim but he said it would be slumped over in some shadowy corner. What a fool. This thing couldn't be killed, that would leave silence.

Have you ever heard of rat torture? I remember hearing about it from some documentary on the History channel on a night during exam season of university. Maybe it was a fantasy movie? Dutch soldiers would put a pot of rats on someone's bare chest. They would place charcoal on the pot and the rats would dig through the victim. I remember having a recurring dream about it happening to me. Not a nightmare but a dream. A nightmare would imply fear. A fear of being so close to another thing that it would nest inside you. I wish I could still have that dream.

I hadn't slept when he appeared at my door, he said his name was Johnathan Green. I asked him if he was from the pest control company and he laughed. I remember it was strange that he laughed because it wasn't a joke.

"You have an infestation" he said. It was my turn to laugh. He was neatly dressed, nice pale yellow dress shirt and brown pants. He was sweaty though and reminded my of a slimy car salesman. He outstretched his sweaty hand in a handshake, but when I looked at his hand it seemed wrong. The skin kind of sagged and sickly. I didn't immediately take him up on the handshake, but he didn't seem to care. He just stood there with an outstretched hand for about an hour. Then he smiled at me.

"I do hope that you can have this resolved soon Simon. No one likes a pest." Then he left as soon as he arrived.

I think the rat broke through now, but that was not respite. I collapsed from exhaustion in my bed, but it was not enough to make me feel less tired. I still hear the clawing, but it is no longer inside my wall. The rat has escaped my wall, but there is no hole. I checked in the mirror, but the back of my head has a hole with fur and tail.

I don't think you can help, it's probably something that can't be helped. I think having written this out, I realized that. Or maybe the voice in between the clawing teeth and nails whispered it to me. I am going to go to bed after this and have a nest inside me.
