\[Part 1\](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gzhpgu/the\_truth\_behind\_the\_hawthorne\_massacre\_part\_1/)

The temperature was rising as we pressed on through the Hawthorne building. The air thickening with a humid scent like a suffocating shroud around us. The silence seemed sentient, an oppressive force pressing in on all sides. No words were exchanged; the weight of what we’d witnessed sat heavy in the space between us. We advanced, muscles tense, anticipation thrumming in our veins. With level 2 access, we entered the workshops.

The blueprints we’d been given were proving unreliable, like a map to a place that had shifted beneath our feet. The doorway we entered should have led into the workshops—a sprawling area of benches, machinery, and half-finished projects. Instead, we stepped into another office space. It looked like what the previous office should have been, yet something still felt profoundly off.

Desks stood in neat rows, cluttered with scattered papers, overturned coffee mugs, and abandoned personal items, as if whoever had been there left in a sudden rush. Monitors, some still faintly glowing, cast eerie lights across the floor. The air was thick with the stale scent of paper and cold metal.

I took a step inside, the carpet matching the green of the other but distinctly dirty. It was almost as if the ‘main’ office had been duplicated here, its contents reassembled in a chaotic snapshot, complete with scattered pens and forgotten notes. But there were no signs of struggle, no upended chairs or broken glass. It was as if life had paused mid-motion, leaving only the hollow remains of activity.

The team shifted uneasily behind me, their eyes sweeping over the space, searching for any hint of what had gone wrong here. The silence was so absolute it felt oppressive, as if the room itself were holding its breath, waiting for us to move.

A phone rang. A shrill, jarring sound that sliced through the suffocating quiet. Had it always been ringing? It was coming from the other side of the too-large room, barricaded behind rows of cubicles. Jones stepped forward, his posture stiff, eager to lead us through this surreal maze. I broke the dreadful silence between the ringing. "Same as before. Search for the hostages."

We spread out, each of us taking a separate corridor between the cubicles, peering into the cramped spaces. The further we ventured, the more twisted the scene became. Some cubicles were empty, as if abandoned in a hurry. But just as many were occupied.

What we saw varied wildly, each sight more grotesque than the last. I passed six different figures as I moved through the rows, each seared into my memory. The first was almost normal-a man sitting perfectly straight, dressed in pristine professional attire, the ideal white-collar worker.

But his hands were stapled to the desk, metal pins driven clean through flesh and wood, and his eyelids had been peeled back, leaving wide, unblinking eyes fixed on a blank, black screen. They looked as if they were beginning to melt. My stomach twisted. Luckily, the man was dead. But the others, I don’t know.

The further I went, the more reality unraveled. Some figures defied comprehension-amalgamations of flesh, fused grotesquely to their chairs and floor as though they had melted and reformed in a horrifying mass. Limbs sprouted at unnatural angles, new, twisted appendages pushing out from the seething mass of tissue. The stench of blood and decay hit me like a wave, thick and suffocating. I swallowed hard, trying to keep the bile down as I pushed on. The ringing phone continued.

By the time I reached the end of my assigned row, I noticed the floor was no longer carpet. It was something wet, pulsating-a layer of meaty, organic flesh, like the building itself was alive.

Every instinct screamed at me to stop, to turn back. My fear and hesitation coiled tight in my chest, but something pushed me forward. It doesn't make sense now; I would have made the call that this was beyond anything we were trained to handle. But a thought, clear and commanding, echoed in my mind: Find the hostages. Complete the mission. I didn't know why, in that moment, it felt like an order I couldn't disobey. But something in that place was driving me, compelling me to keep going.

I heard the sound of someone vomiting, but I couldn't tell which one of us. The fetid stench of the room clung to the air, seeping into my clothes, making my own stomach lurch. We gathered at the end of the room, the ringing phone creeping up on us. Glancing back the way we came, I felt my gut twist-the entire floor was no longer carpet but a layer of scabbed, pulsing meat.

"I guess we know where the hostages are," Baker said, a laugh bubbling out of him, wild and inappropriate.

I turned to him, startled. His helmet and balaclava were gone, revealing his youthful, sweat-slicked face. His eyes gleamed with a manic light, and bile dripped from his chin. The humor was lost on me, on all of us. We stood frozen as Baker sank to one knee, gasping between fits of laughter, the sound jagged and wrong.

"Baker..." I finally managed, the word sticking in my throat.

The ringing persisted, relentless, slicing through the stale air. It droned on, a maddening sound that dug into my nerves. "Somebody answer that fucking phone!" | yelled, my voice strained, raw.

The quiet snapped back like a whip and held for a long moment. Francis and Jones looked at me, confusion written into their states. It was only broken by Baker's wheezing. My eyes darted to the phone, lying off its receiver, no connection, no dial tone-just sitting there silent, staring at me. 

Then, without warning, Baker's laughter cut off. He jerked, eyes wide, hands clutching at his throat as he began to choke. 

I turned and saw Baker struggling, his body convulsing as he clawed at his throat. We rushed to him, hands frantic, trying to figure out what was choking him. Francis's training took over; he rolled Baker to his side, pounding on his back to clear his airways. It didn't work. Baker's gasps turned into gurgles, his eyes bulging.

Then, suddenly, the choking stopped. Relief flared for a split second as we rolled him onto his back.

His breathing was ragged, eyes unfocused, but he managed to tilt his head toward me with a grotesque grin, blood smeared on his lips. "Wanna hear a joke?" he whispered, voice quivering with something dark.

His head exploded.

A wave of warmth and gore splattered across my face, soaking through my balaclava. The metallic taste of viscera filled my mouth, making me gag. I shook, frozen in shock as the scene unfolded in a nightmare haze. Francis stood upright, eyes wide, bits of skull sliding off his flak vest. Jones had scrambled back, pressed against a cubicle, eyes darting between us in disbelief.

I cradled Baker's lifeless body, the neck stump pulsing with dark, fetid blood that smelled of decay-like it had been rotting for weeks. My stomach heaved, and I yanked the balaclava off just in time to retch, bile mixing with the gore that covered me.

I sat in the mess, breathing hard, the world spinning in and out of focus. The silence that followed was suffocating, punctuated only by the harsh gasps of my own breath. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, the taste of death still on my tongue. But the compulsion, that insistent order in my mind, pushed me to move.

“Let’s go,” I said hoarsely, my voice cracking. “We still have to search.”

“No.” Jones stood up, meeting my eyes, defiance in his. “No.”

“What?” I snapped.

“We have multiple KIAs, including Baker!” His voice shook, but there was steel behind it.

“We still—”

“Look around!” He gestured wildly at the fetid, decaying office, the grotesque remnants of Baker fusing into the pulsing floor. “What the fuck are we supposed to do?”

“Overlord said—”

“We can’t get through to Overlord! I tried!” Jones’s eyes were wild, the whites showing as he glanced around.

“Her orders were clear to me,” I said, fighting to keep my voice steady.

“I couldn’t hear her! Nothing but static! Could you, Francis?” Jones turned sharply, but Francis stood motionless, eyes fixed on Bakers corpse.

Jones pressed on, breath ragged. “I’m calling it. As Lead Operator, I’m calling it.” He shouldered his rifle, the weight of command settling on him. “You are no longer fit for team lead.”

“Like hell I ain’t!” Rage surged through me, hot and unrelenting. “At least I listen to orders!” My fists clenched as the room seemed to close in. “You have no idea!”

Jones's face hardened, eyes flicking down to Baker's corpse as it continued to meld into the oozing floor. The unnatural sight twisted the moment into a fever dream. His rifle snapped up, trained on me. "Sir, I am ordering you to stand down."

"What? You going to shoot me!? How long have you known me, Jones? You know the mission is always the priority!"

Jones shook his head, eyes glistening with a mix of fear and resolve. "You're too far gone, just like the janitor. Like that guard." His voice was low, edged with resentment. "It's in your head."

His finger twitched on the trigger, the moment stretched thin, a hair's breadth from disaster.

A flash. The deafening crack of a gunshot.

My ears rang, the world blurring as I blinked through the shock. When I regained focus, Jones was on the ground, writhing, blood streaming from his neck. His eyes met mine, wide with pain and accusation. They screamed at me.

*This is all your fault.*

I turned, my movements sluggish with dread. Francis stood with his rifle raised, his hands trembling, tears carving paths down his face, eyes bloodshot and leaking. I looked back at Jones as his body went still, the light fading from his gaze.

"F-Francis?" My voice was weak, raw with disbelief.

"I want to hurt you." Francis's voice was choked, a sob riding each word.

I froze as I felt the cold press of the barrel against the back of my neck.

"I want to hurt you so bad," he said, his voice breaking, shuddering with emotion.

"I-I don't think you do, Francis," I whispered, forcing calm into my voice.

"No, I want to." His breathing quickened, ragged and desperate. "Why do I want to?"

"Francis, listen to me," I said, my words careful, each one a lifeline. Silence hung between us, a chasm of tension. "Jones was right. I'm not thinking straight. Neither of us is."

"No," he whispered, the gun barrel trembling against me. "If I do this, it'll feel so good. What's another body? What's another life snuffed out by these hands?"

"But you were right all those other times, Francis. I'm your friend."

"Jones was." His voice cracked, a mix of rage and sorrow. "If he was right, why is he dead?"

"Francis," I said, trying to anchor him. "Let's think this through."

"No," he said, the word breaking into a sob. "I have thought it through. I want to hurt you. But that's wrong... and it feels so right." The air thickened as he took another shuddering breath. “Our job is to hurt people. To hurt bad people.” 

I saw my rifle on the floor, too far. My hand still hung limp against me, I could feel my pistol in the holster. I won’t be fast enough. “Our job is to save people.”

His voice was breaking. "I have to. I have to. I have to.”

"Francis-"

The pressure lifted as the rifle pulled away. A split second later, another gunshot cracked through the room, and the sound of a body collapsing hit like a punch to the chest. I turned, eyes wide with dread.

The moan that escaped me was raw and broken. Sorrow flooded me, overwhelming and unrelenting.

I was alone.

I don’t know how long I sat there, in that hellscape, surrounded by the corpses of my friends slowly becoming one with the flesh. I couldn’t move. The sound of a heartbeat thudded in my ears, steady and rhythmic. At first, I thought it was my own, my body desperately trying to drag me back from the brink. But it wasn’t. The heartbeat didn’t belong to me. It was coming from somewhere else—somewhere deep below.

The phone began to ring. The sharp sound pierced the silence, but I didn’t flinch. I turned to look at it, eyes hollow, the noise a cruel reminder of reality. There was no reason to answer it, no logic to cling to, but I reached out and picked it up.

“Hello?”

“Thank God!” Overlord’s voice crackled through, rich with relief and something more—fear. “Where have you been? You’ve been dark for hours!”

“Where?” I whispered, the question hanging in the air as if lost.

“Yes, Alpha. We have reinforcements outside waiting. You can come out now.”

“Can I?” The words slipped out before I could stop them, detached and distant.

“Yes. We’re waiting for you.”

Overlords name fell from my lips, a slip of my fractured mind. “Sarah…”

“Come again?” Her tone sharpened, concern bleeding through the static.

“Sarah, they’re all dead… they’re gone…”

“Who’s dead?”

I paused, the room closing in around me. Who was dead? Right. My squad. “The rest of Alpha team. They’re dead.”

A brief silence. “All four of them?”

“Four…” I hesitated, a fog settling over my mind. When was there a fourth? “Affirmative, Sarah. It’s just me.”

“I see. Roger that, Alpha team is gone. Can you get out?”

Can I? Could I really leave this place? “I… have to find the… hostages. Sarah… the hostages.”

The heartbeat grew louder, pounding up through the floor, shaking the breath from my lungs. I pushed myself to my feet, legs trembling beneath me. Overlord’s voice broke through, panicked and urgent. “Alpha, I am—”

The phone slipped from my fingers, clattering lifelessly to the floor. I turned toward the far end of the room where a metallic door waited, its surface gleaming under the sickly light. The heartbeat thrummed louder, a pulsing echo that filled the space like a drumbeat from deep within the earth. I bent down and pried the rifle from Francis’s limp hand, his fingers loosening as if in farewell.

“I have to find them,” I muttered, stepping toward the source of the heartbeat—the unknown that waited below.

The helmet felt too heavy, pressing down like a weight on my skull. I stripped it off, letting it drop with a dull thud. The balaclava followed, the heat suffocating. I unbuckled my vest, its heft slowing me down. The humid, musky air stung my lungs, the sickly-sweet stench of decay coating my senses, but I barely registered it. All I felt was the calling. The urge to move forward, to complete the mission.

That’s what I do. I complete the mission.

A burst of static buzzed in my ear, sharp and grating. Her voice rose, strained with panic. “Alpha! Where are you going? Evac is here! You have to leave.”

“You said to find the hostages. Sarah, I have to find the hostages.”

“To hell with that, you’ve been through too much. Come back to us. Now.”

I yanked the earpiece out and hurled it to the floor. The wet squelch as it landed on the pulsing, fleshy surface felt like a final response. I crushed it under my boot, the muffled crack lost in the heartbeat’s rhythm.

I reached the elevator and looked down at the base of the door. A congealed mass of a corpse lay clinging to the ground, hand outstretched, clutching a keycard. I pulled on it, a few fingers snapping with wet pops. Level 3 Restricted was emblazoned on it. I swiped it over the reader. A green light flickered, and the doors slid open with a mechanical hiss. Inside, there were only two buttons: One labeled as Office and Lab. The other: Below.

The heartbeat intensified, vibrating up through the floor and into my bones, as if the building itself was alive and breathing. I pressed the button for Below, the lower floor, and the doors closed, sealing me in. Alone again.

The memories of the grotesque office space flashed through my mind. The fleshy carpet, the twisted remains—it couldn’t have been all of them. Something in my gut twisted, a deep-rooted feeling that more awaited below. There had to be more hostages. That was the only conclusion my mind would accept.

The heartbeat thrummed louder, almost in sync with my racing pulse, as if answering my unspoken thoughts.

Yes, I was correct. Somethings speaking to me. I am right. I will find them.

I could hear something. Was it the static? “Alpha!” Sarah’s voice was strained, filled with urgency. “This is your commanding officer! You are to stand down at once!”

How was she talking to me? My eyes darted around the elevator, catching the dull gleam of speakers embedded in the metal walls. Without thinking, I raised my rifle and shot them, the crack of gunfire reverberating through the confined space.

“Alpha. Do not enter!” Her voice cut through the fading ring of the gunshot, sounding almost ghostly as it dissipated into the enclosed area.

How does she know?

“Alpha!” It continued to echo in my mind.

My world shuddered and came to a stop. The elevator door opened with a low groan, revealing nothing but a yawning void. Darkness swallowed the entrance, a thick, suffocating shroud. I stood still, letting my eyes adjust, the thrum of the heartbeat growing louder, reverberating through my bones. How massive was this room? I realized I hadn’t noticed how long the elevator ride had been, too caught up in the pulsing sound that beckoned me deeper. The air was thick, humid, carrying the sharp tang of copper and decay. More flesh covered the uneven ground, a grotesque carpet that squelched underfoot as I stepped forward, rifle raised.

There were no man-made walls down here. It truly was a cave—a place untouched by reason. I glanced back at the fading light of the elevator, the only glow in this oppressive darkness. As the doors closed with a heavy thud, I was swallowed by blackness, blind except for the rhythmic, unnatural heartbeat that guided me.

Slowly, my vision began to adjust fully. Shadows shifted and shapes emerged. My breath caught in my chest as I saw it: a grotesque mass suspended from the ceiling, the size of a small house. Bodies frozen in desperate poses, limbs reaching up and faces contorted in silent horror, held up the amalgamated structure. Their flesh melded together seamlessly, veins pulsing visibly beneath a slick, sinewy surface. A low, rhythmic squelch accompanied each beat of the monstrous heart, filling the cavern with an unnatural cadence.

I stood paralyzed, the enormity of the sight dwarfing me. Was this place under the facility, or had I crossed into somewhere else entirely? Nothing made sense. The beat throbbed in my ears, compelling, hypnotic. I stumbled forward, the toe of my boot striking a cold, metal surface. My hands found a console, slick with sweat and grime. I felt around it, searching for a purpose when something cold and wet clutched my leg.

Instinct took over. I spun, pressing the barrel of my rifle against the source—but a sudden wave of calm stopped me. I blinked, focusing, and saw a man half-submerged in the grotesque floor. His eyes, wide with terror, met mine. Recognition dawned, cutting through my confusion.

“James.”

His lips parted, voice weak and trembling. “The runes… the ritual was broken…”

“What?” I asked, barely able to force the word past my dry throat.

“We need to contain it. The explosives. It needs to—” His eyes suddenly widened, horror etched deep into his features as life drained from his face. In an instant, his eyes sank into their sockets, his skin folding inward, and then his entire head collapsed as if being sucked through a straw.

I stumbled back, bile rising in my throat, unable to tear my gaze away from the now lifeless, misshapen figure. The heartbeat continued, unfaltering and relentless. 

I looked over the console and felt the lever beneath my fingers, a surge of thrill rising through me. Without hesitation, I slammed it down, and lights sputtered to life, casting the cavern in a sickly glow. The grotesque monstrosity was revealed in its full, fetid glory—a seething, pulsating mass of fused bodies, their limbs twisted in agony and frozen in a wretched tableau. A strange sense of accomplishment flooded me, almost as if something was congratulating me.

The network of wires connecting blocks of C4 was visible now, crisscrossing around the stone pillars that surrounded the abomination. The pillars were carved with ancient, alien symbols that I couldn’t begin to understand. The tendrils from the mass coiled around the stone, tightening like a predator constricting its prey. It was straining against the pillars, desperate to break free.

“Leave it,” Sarah’s voice echoed in my mind, clear and commanding.

My vision wavered, disoriented by the sudden intrusion of her voice. I blinked, scanning the area frantically for anything that could be a detonator—anything that could give me control over this nightmare. 

I spotted a worn, military-style bag near the base of a pillar, half-buried beneath a layer of flesh-like growths. Hope surged as I stumbled toward it, but the instant my hand reached out, pain lanced through my skull, sharp and blinding. I recoiled, gasping, as Sarah’s voice echoed again, more insistent this time, reverberating inside my head.

“Leave it,” she repeated, each word a spike driving deeper into my mind. My knees buckled, and I clutched at my temples, trying to force the pain away. The room spun around me, and the heartbeat—that relentless, thrumming beat—synchronized with the pounding in my head.

Before I could recover, the cavern shifted. The light warped, and the oppressive walls seemed to melt away, replaced by an endless, dimly lit hallway. The grey brick walls enclosed me, stretching out into an infinite tunnel under the harsh, flickering lights that seemed to press down from above, casting distorted shadows that wavered like ghosts. A single red light blinked above a door at the far end, pulsing in an unsettling rhythm that matched the drumming of my heart. Overlord’s voice crackled urgently in my ear, sharp and panicked. “Get out! Quick!”

I stumbled forward, my breath ragged as dread clawed at my chest. The hope that had carried me before was gone, sucked out by the unnatural silence and the sterile emptiness of this place. My boots thudded against the ground, each step slower than the last as if the hallway itself resisted me, pulling me back into its cold embrace. A chill ran down my spine, sweat trickling down my neck as the oppressive air thickened, weighing me down like lead. I had to run. Sarah needs me to leave.

“Wanna hear a joke?” a voice echoed from behind, slicing through the suffocating quiet.

I turned, pulse spiking, and saw Baker standing just outside the door, his hand raised in a mock salute, a grin stretching across his face. The moment felt wrong, twisted, like an echo from a memory that didn’t belong to me but only for a moment. A strange, misplaced relief surged in my veins, pulling me forward, drawing me to follow. He stepped through a doorway at the end of the hall, disappearing into the darkness.

“Alpha! Stop!” Overlord’s voice screamed, sharp and desperate.

I took the steps towards where Baker exited.

I was back in the cavern, the wet squelch of the fleshy ground clinging to my knees as I pushed forward, each step a battle against the grotesque, pulsing floor. The bright glow from the artificial lights above cast the cavern in sickly hues, flickering like a heartbeat in its final, erratic moments. My hand reached out, trembling, until my fingers found the rough canvas of the bag. This had to end. Now.

The hopeful feelings I felt started to coalesce into voices. Whispered pleas in my mind, clear and sad. I could hear them, feel them, their desperation seeping into my bones. Hope surged through me, raw and electric, igniting a flame that burned through my fear. They needed me to act; they were begging to be saved, urging me to end this nightmare.

“Help us…”

“Free us…”

“End it…”

“Please…”

“It wants out…”

“Finish it…”

“Stop it…”

Their cries spurred me on, driving away the paralyzing terror. My fingers clawed at the bag, fumbling with the slick, blood-soaked fabric until I found the cold, familiar shape of a detonator. It felt heavier than I expected, as if the weight of every soul trapped in this hellish place rested in my palm. An urgent, primal instinct screamed for me to run, to flee before it was too late.

A sudden, gentle pressure settled on my shoulder, light and almost reassuring. Memories rushed in—Jones’s steady grip, his voice calm and resolute, promising we’d make it out alive. Baker’s reckless grin surfaced next, masking unyielding resilience and that defiant humour that kept us moving even when fear threatened to break us. Francis, ever-vigilant and methodical, the one whose eyes never missed a threat, whose determination to protect us had carried us through countless missions. Their unwavering will to survive, etched into my mind, pushed me forward now, igniting the last flicker of hope in the dark.

I surged forward, abandoning the rifle that felt useless now. The heartbeat of the mass behind me thumped harder, faster, vibrating through the ground and up my legs, shaking me to my core. The grotesque form writhed and convulsed, tendrils snapping like whips, clawing at the pillars that strained to hold them back. The symphony of screams escalated, a chorus of agony that reverberated off the cavern walls, drowning out rational thought.

I stumbled into the elevator, the doors parting just as I reached them, as if welcoming me to safety. The moment I stepped inside, I turned to face the chaos. The monstrous mass thrashed violently, cracking the stone with each desperate heave. The carved runes glowed with a failing light, splintering as the pillars crumbled. The sound was deafening—a cacophony of splintering rock, shrieking voices, and the relentless thud of that hellish heartbeat.

My eyes dropped to the detonator in my shaking hand, slick with sweat and dirt. My thumb hovered over the button for an instant that felt like an eternity, the weight of every choice pressing down on me. With a final, shuddering breath, I pressed it.

—

The last thing I remember was walking out of the main foyer of that building. Clutched in my left hand were the remnants of evidence: the footage from my body cam and the recovered CCTV tapes. In my right hand were the uniform patches of three close friends. The media swarmed, their cameras flashing, capturing the solitary SWAT member emerging from the chaos with a vacant, haunted look. Overlord—Sarah—ran to meet me. I don’t recall what she said; I just handed her the evidence and trudged toward the Command Base, numb to the world around me.

They moved swiftly to cover up my exit, ensuring the moment was scrubbed from any official record. Only those who watched the live broadcast witnessed it—likely half of America—but any evidence of that footage was quickly buried. The government dubbed it a perfect example of the Mandela effect. They crafted my heroic interview without my involvement, editing out anything that didn’t align with their narrative. What I told them was met with disbelief; my story made no sense to them.

There were no official reports of an explosion, and everything supposedly matched the blueprints. I reported being in there for an hour at least, maybe more but Sarah timed it. Only 20 minutes had passed for her. They denied the existence of the flesh I described, the bodies were never released either - they claimed contamination. Even the footage, grainy and unreliable, hinted at the horrors but fell short of proving the truth to them. It showed only glimpses of what I’d seen—what had happened to my squad. To them, it was easier to dismiss my account as trauma-induced delusion than to confront the possibility that something unspeakable had taken place beneath Hawthorne Industries.

I know what I witnessed, and maybe one day the truth will be declassified—but I doubt it. That’s why I’m writing this now, so someone—anyone—will know. The thing down there was powerful, toying with our minds and warping our sense of time and space. I think it couldn’t get a hold of me like the others. I’m not special; I just did what I had to do.

For all I know, Sam could still be alive, trapped in some impossible limbo. Or maybe it was powerful enough to erase him entirely.

What I fear most is that I only stopped it temporarily, before it could grow stronger, consume more bodies, and become even more monstrous. Able to erase anyone at will.

James Wright, for what it’s worth, you were a hero. You tried to stop it. I wish the American public knew the truth.

The Hawthorne Massacre wasn’t a tragedy—it was a warning.
