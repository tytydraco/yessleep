  
Three days had elapsed since the mall incident and as expected, every trace of it had been concealed. The whole event was portrayed as a terrorist attack, resulting in the deaths of 40 people. I haven’t left my room since that day, nor have I had an appetite. I feel exhausted but I can’t sleep. Every time I close my eyes I can see them, the victims of that ordeal.  
  
If only I had killed myself back then, I could have possibly saved them. *I promise, I will erase you all from this world.* I did say that but, how many people would have to die for that goal to be realized? Would Olivia and the man be included in the next pile of corpses? I shivered at the thought.  
  
As I walked to the bathroom, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. Would you believe me if I told you I hadn't looked at my own reflection, at all, these past days? What stared back at me was almost unrecognizable.   
  
Bloodshot eyes, encircled by deep shadows, gazed back from the mirror's surface. I removed my shirt, exposing a tapestry of scars crisscrossing my body, some faded with age, others fresh and angry. In addition, I couldn't help but notice the weight I had shed over these past days.  
  
As I fixated on my reflection in the mirror, my bloodshot eyes seemed to morph into the very image of that monstrous entity. The one that possessed the man and almost me. Perhaps this was precisely why I had avoided looking into the mirror all along.   
  
Panic welled up within me, and I hurried to the toilet as an overwhelming urge to vomit coursed through me. Predictably, nothing emerged from my stomach.   
  
I had anticipated growing accustomed to this sensation by now, but it continued to gnaw at my senses relentlessly. As I lay on the floor, I struggled desperately to stifle the urge to scream.  
  
Olivia and the man were in the next room. I didn’t want them to worry about me. You see, I was scared, afraid of facing death once more. Even if I were to come back to life and time turned backwards, I didn’t want to experience that kind of pain again. I felt so alone. Would they even believe me if I told them that time resets when I die? Would they blame me for not using my ability to save the victims of the mall disaster?  
  
 A knock on the door snapped me out of my thoughts.  
  
“Alex, are you okay?” I could hear the man’s voice through the door. I guess he also has inhuman hearing amongst all other abilities.  
  
I composed myself and stood with my back against the door. I couldn't let them see how shaken I was. “I’m fine, how are you two doing?”   
  
“I’m doing alright, Olivia is somewhat better compared to two days ago. We’re both really worried you know?” That phrase, I really hated that phrase.  
  
“I’ll cope, just like I always do.” I bluntly replied.  
  
“Have you eaten anything? Olivia makes really good food!”  
  
“I’m not hungry, I’ll come eat when I feel like it.”  
  
“I see, well, please come out soon, okay? No pressure.”  
  
I looked at the time, it was 1:30 a.m. “I guess time really does pass when you lock yourself in a room huh? I guess I’ll try to sleep.” With that, I turned off the lights and tried to sleep again.   
  
As I lay in bed, my eyes started to play tricks on me once more. In the darkness I could see the twisted bodies of the dead. They surrounded me in eerie silence, their lifeless eyes fixed on mine. My body froze solid, and I struggled to move. Anxiety built up inside me as my breathing quickened, but I remained trapped in my paralyzed state.   
  
I could tell from their expression, they were asking me to help them. And how could I help them now? If I killed myself now, would I even go back to the mall again? I didn’t want to try and find out. I squeezed my eyes shut, muttering to myself that this couldn't be real. When I reopened them, the haunting figures had vanished without a trace.  
  
As sleep wouldn’t come, I felt the sudden urge to go for a walk. I haven’t been moving at all due to my low energy, so a little exercise wouldn’t hurt right?   
  
Thankfully, Olivia and the man were in their room. I didn’t want to be seen, so while making as little noise as I could, I left the hotel.  
  
Where was I going? I didn’t know, but I felt an overwhelming need for a change of scenery. The city streets were eerily quiet at this late hour, with only the occasional distant car passing by. The dimly lit lampposts cast long shadows on the deserted sidewalks. My footsteps echoed in the silence, each one a reminder of my sleep-deprived and weakened state.  
  
After a couple of minutes, a wave of dizziness washed over me, and I collapsed onto the cold, unforgiving sidewalk. The lack of nourishment had really drained my energy to its limit.   
  
As I rolled onto my back, my gaze drifted upward, captivated by the beauty of the night sky. A magnificent full moon bathed the surroundings in an ethereal glow, its soft light casting an almost surreal ambiance over the quiet streets.   
  
I guess misery makes you appreciate the small things huh? In the midst of my exhaustion and confusion, a haunting question surfaced in my mind.  
  
“Why am I still alive again?”  Never say that your life doesn’t have any worth again, do you understand?! That’s right, I finally had someone who wished for me to live. But did they really need me? What am I to them anyway?   
  
These questions gnawed at my thoughts like persistent shadows. What role did I play in their lives? Was I just a burden, or did my existence truly matter to them? The weight of uncertainty bore down on me, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had a place in this world, in their hearts.  
  
“Well, isn’t that just depressing.” As I was contemplating what to do next, I could hear footsteps behind me. Was it another hallucination?  
  
**“Hey.”**  
  
I lifted my head to see the man crouching above me. He appeared larger than life in the dim moonlight, his tall and imposing figure casting an eerie shadow.  
  
“You’re kind of scary right now.”   
  
“Sorry about that.” He sat down beside me. His brown eyes, usually so gentle, now held a glint of concern as they peered into mine. Despite his imposing presence, there was an undeniable warmth in his expression that offered a strange sense of comfort in the midst of my turmoil.  
  
“Look at the sky, doesn’t it look great?”  
  
He smirked. “Looks way better than you, dude. You’ve certainly seen better days.”  
  
“And Olivia?”  
  
“She’s currently waiting for us to come back. I told her to wait there.”  
  
“Thanks, I don’t want her to see me like this if possible.”  
  
“Oh, so you like her?”  
  
“What? No.”  
  
He gave me a sly grin. “Mhm, whatever you sayyy.”  
  
He paused. “But really, I’m happy you’re still alive."  
  
“Where did that come from?”  
  
His gaze shifted towards the sky. “We’ve just survived a life-threatening situation fighting against walking disasters. Surely, I can say that much?”  
  
“Hey, I have a question. Have you ever wanted to kill yourself?”  
  
He instantly responded, a sincere look on his face. “Yes Alex, I have. One of the reasons I asked Olivia not to come here was so I could talk with you in private.  
  
You’ve been through quite a bit, haven’t you? I can tell from your eyes, they look just like mine used to. Four years ago, one of those pigs attacked my home and killed almost my entire family in front of me. I killed it using the axe, but I was too late. I barely managed to save my grandpa.  
  
Next thing I knew, he didn’t recognize me, and I was left all alone. One year later, he hanged himself, unable to bear the weight of our shared misery. As I killed more pigs, I couldn’t help but question whether I had a reason left to live anymore.   
  
The only thing that somewhat kept me going was helping people. Even if they were to forget me later on, I still felt refreshed seeing their joyful expressions when they realized they were safe from the horrors I had faced.   
  
That’s why I feel so fond of you two. You honestly gave me hope, whether you realize it or not. I’ve been so lonely for all these years, just having someone to talk can really do a lot for a man.”  
  
I was touched, his honest words were really having an impact on me. All my life I had never considered that someone would be able to feel this much pain and still continue to push forward. Could I really open up to this person? Could I trust him as he trusted me?   
  
“What I’m trying to say is, you can count on me. Not just in combat, but as a friend as well. You’re a really brave person, choosing to fight against them instead of taking the easy way out. I really respect that about you. Not to mention, you were so badass at the mall. I don’t think we could’ve won without you.”  
  
I was barely holding back the tears welling up in my eyes. For years I pretended to be someone I’m not, trying to fit in with people. Just so I wouldn’t feel lonely, yet this man considered someone like me his friend. All these pent-up emotions came out at once.   
  
Tears streamed down my face as I covered my eyes with my forearm. I cried hysterically for a couple of seconds, feeling a strange mix of vulnerability and relief.  
  
“Are you feeling any better now?”  
  
I wiped my face. “I guess so, but there’s still something missing.”  
  
He gave me a confused look. “What?”  
  
“Your name. I’m gonna smack you if you refuse again.”  
  
He smiled. “It’s #!@\*%.”  
  
“Lovely name, and thanks for telling me about yourself. Speaking of which…”  
  
“Hmm?”  
  
“You’re fully clothed now? I’ve only just noticed.” We shared a moment of silent amusement, and then burst into laughter, our laughter echoing through the still night, regardless of any snoozing neighbors.  
  
After that, we returned to the hotel, Olivia was worried sick. Three days of isolation had certainly taken a toll on my appearance.  
  
Olivia and #!@\*% also got properly introduced which helped ease the initial awkwardness of this reunion. I finally ate a bit, however, I still couldn’t sleep. The specters of the dead were still haunting my thoughts. Their silent, beseeching gazes refusing to fade. Instead, I chatted with #!@\*% until the sun rose.  
  
The morning came, and my everlasting headache wasn’t letting up. Olivia entered the room and gave me a stern look. “Did you sleep Alex?” I looked at #!@\*%. “Yes…”  We both chuckled.  
  
“Take your health into consideration Alex! Getting improper sleep is bad for your health! Same goes for you #!@\*%!”  
  
\#!@\*% shrugged. “It couldn’t be helped, we were talking about love! He was just telling me how he was dying to go on a date with you.”  
  
Olivia's eyes widened, and a hint of a smile played on her lips. “Is that right, Alex? Planning a romantic rendezvous, are you?”  
  
Despite my exhaustion, I could feel the embarrassment creeping in. “I’m not! I just… can’t sleep.” They both exchanged a glance, their concern evident in their eyes.  
  
“In that case let’s go on a date, the three of us in the afternoon.” We both exchanged bewildered looks at #!@\*%'s unexpected suggestion, but after a moment, we decided to go along with it.   
  
When the time came, he led us to a nearby park, a picturesque scene with lush green grass and towering trees, creating a serene atmosphere that contrasted with recent events. It was a somewhat unexpected choice of location.  
  
“Today is a bit cloudy, so the temperature is perfect for a picnic. You two stay here for a bit and relax, I’ll be nearby doing some digging. Call me in case anything happens.” With those words, he hurried off and disappeared from view.  
  
Olivia and I remained silent for a while, the quiet of the park surrounding us. I was only half-awake, but it felt as though neither of us knew what to say amidst the tranquil beauty of the park.   
  
My thoughts went back to yesterday’s conversation with #!@\*%. I feel like we got a bit closer after that. What about Olivia though? After a pause, I decided to break the silence. “Thanks for being a part of my life.”   
  
“You're welcome, Alex. But can I ask you something personal?  
  
“Sure.”  
  
“Do you still think your life is worthless?”  
  
I blinked, caught off guard by her directness. “I… I don’t know. The past few days, the only thing on my mind has been you and #!@\*%. So, I guess it's fair to say that I'm living for you, not just for myself. At the very least, I can admit that something has changed. I just can't put it into words properly.”  
  
She looked skeptical for a second. “I’m not judging you, it’s probably the same for me. I no longer have a home to return to anymore and I’ve been depending on you quite a bit. Speaking of which, I never thanked you did I? For saving my life, twice now.”  
  
Flashbacks of the moment when Olivia was killed by the flowery creature surged in my mind. A tumultuous blend of anger and sorrow washed over me, threatening to engulf my senses. The image of her face, drained of life, haunted me, causing my breath to hasten as I clenched my nails into my forearms.   
  
Olivia, noticing my distress, intervened. “Alex stop, what are you doing!” She drew me into a warm embrace, and after a few moments, I placed both my hands on her shoulders.  
  
Her eyes met mine. *“Don’t die! You hear me?! You’re not allowed to die ever again! I promise I’ll return your life to normal, so… please, don’t say that. You’ve been nothing but kind to me ever since I met you. You… deserve to be happy. I… just want… to be by your side. That’s all…”*  
  
She was speechless. She probably couldn’t understand what the hell I was rambling about. As I started to calm down after this outburst, I once again realized how selfish I sounded. I suppose being half awake really messed up with my already compromised mental state. Amidst all this, my left eye was almost completely shut. Yelling like that drained most of my energy.  
  
I took a deep breath. “Umm, sorry for-“  
  
Olivia, without uttering a word, gestured for me to approach. I followed suit and with gentle care, she cradled my head in her lap. “What .. are you-“ I tried to protest but she cut me off.  
  
*“Just go to sleep already,”* she said softly.   
  
“Wh-what if we get attacked?”   
  
*“I'll keep watch.”* With those reassuring words, I succumbed to sleep completely. Even if it was just for that moment, it felt as though everything was going to be all okay. No dreams visited me. Instead, I experienced the gentle sensation of my head being caressed, as if my worries were being tenderly washed away.  
  
As I blinked my bleary eyes open, a sense of gratitude washed over me. Olivia had kept her word, watching over me as I rested. Her commitment to my well-being really touched my heart. She was looking elsewhere, her blond hair swaying in the wind as dusk had settled over the park.   
  
The world seemed hushed, as if holding its breath in reverence for the scene before me. Olivia's profile, bathed in the soft light of the sunset, was a portrait of serenity. I sat up carefully, my joints protesting from the uncomfortable position I'd slept in.  
  
As I shifted, Olivia turned her gaze toward me, her eyes soft and caring. She smiled, her expression emanating warmth. In that quiet moment, I realized just how lucky I was to have her by my side.  
  
“How long was I out for?”  
  
“Hmmm, an hour or two?”  
  
“Sorry about that, your legs must be very sore.”  
  
She stretched. “Surprisingly, I feel fine. What about you? You slept like a log.”  
  
I rubbed my eyes. “I still have a bit of a headache, but I feel somewhat refreshed.”  
  
Suddenly, I felt an arm over my shoulder. ”You sure you don’t wanna sleep more bro? Olivia seems to be feeling generous today.” #!@\*% said, a mischievous glint in his eye.  
  
“We can sleep together later.” It was then that I paused, realizing what had just come out of my mouth. Olivia blushing didn’t help matters.	  
  
\#!@\*% just couldn’t help himself. “Hmm, so much for not liking her.”  
  
“I already said I-“  
  
“What, you hate her then?” Olivia was paying close attention as if she was genuinely expecting a response from me.  
  
“I hate you, does that count?”  
  
\#!@\*%  clenched his chest. “What? Argh! Alex, I thought we had something special!”  
  
We shared a laugh, the awkward moment from earlier now replaced with a comfortable camaraderie. It was a welcome change from the weight of the past few days. With renewed spirits, #!@\*% insisted he wanted to show us something.   
  
I felt a wave of nervousness wash over me. “What are we doing in a graveyard?”  
  
He continued walking. “Closure of sorts.” We followed him until we stumbled upon a remarkable sight: a series of recently dug graves, each marked with makeshift tombstones, covering a section of the graveyard.  
  
Olivia spoke up, her voice filled with awe. “These are…”  
  
He crossed his arms, his expression resolute. “The people that perished at the mall. I couldn’t just let them rot in that building. It was the least I could do.”  
  
In that moment, amidst all the sad emotions that flew in the air, a strong wave of determination and gratitude surged through me. I had to get stronger, using any means possible. To get our revenge, our lives back, to protect the people dear to me. As night came, we returned to our hotel and as we were chatting, Olivia mentioned how she always wanted to go to Japan.  
  
Intrigued, I quietly retrieved the laptop I had “borrowed” and began delving into Japan. To my astonishment, a viral video was sweeping the internet, showcasing a recent earthquake of monstrous magnitude that had struck Tokyo.   
  
My anticipation heightened as I clicked on the video, expecting to witness a devastating tremor toppling buildings and chaos unfolding. Despite that, I was unprepared for what was depicted in the video.  
  
As I watched in disbelief, I couldn't ignore the bizarre truth that unfolded before me. I rubbed my fatigued eyes, as if hoping it was another trick of my sleep-deprived mind. In a desperate attempt to comprehend the inexplicable, I hit the rewind button.  
  
No matter how many times I replayed the video, the impossible remained undeniable. Turning to Olivia and #!@\*%, I urgently implored them to refute what I was witnessing. A part of me yearned for them to assure me that my sheer exhaustion had warped my vision.  
  
Their expressions mirrored my own astonishment. There, on the screen, a ginormous centipede-like creature was on a rampage through the city streets, obliterating everything in its path. Its grotesque appearance was unlike anything I could have imagined.   
  
Its skin appeared to be an obscene patchwork of human flesh, stitched together in a nightmarish quilt, while enormous, sinewy human arms grotesquely replaced the typical spindly appendages of a centipede.  
  
 I turned to face them. “What the hell is that?”  
  
\#!@\*%’s  expression grew grave. “That’s our next target.”
