Hey r/nosleep , this is not Nate, but instead Sarah, y'know, ex Night Fill boss, now that freak Jason's favourite thing to annoy? Yeah. Sorry, sadly I don't think Nate could post if he wanted to... because he's missing. 

Fuck me, this is gonna be long... how about I start by giving some insights for those who were asking questions? Yeah, that should do. 

1 - "Will Kyle join the Graveyard Shift?"   
No, Kyle isn't in another team anymore, he was fired, terminated is corporate lingo for booting someone from the team and cancelling their contract. (AKA: firing em.) 

2 - "Do you believe they are Aliens?"    
These freaks are definitely not alien, I don't think, considering what I witnessed Friday and the fact that Nathan is missing. 

3 - "Does Nathan get a day off considering his schedule?"   
Nate gets Sundays off, the lucky bugger, I made the mistake of taking Tuesdays instead. Woulda been nice to take that day off instead... 

And before everything else, I just have to say... that I'm truly sorry, this is my damn fault, most of what has happened.

That all aside, everything is getting crazy. Kyle came in on Friday morning looking like he'd not slept for twenty years, tried to get into a screaming match with David and then got dragged off the premises by security. Safe to say, he didn't take getting fired well. Then again, I'm not taking having been demoted well either, especially with Jason as a replacement, a damn shitty one at that. 

Anyways, focussing, Kyle went spastic, David had him removed... right. Security terminal footage, that's something that surprisingly took a long time for me to download over to my PC. But the results are... interesting. There's the usual, even some captures of Nathan's encounters on Wednesday. I can understand why he seemed rather disturbed the following day, with all that he had to endure. 

One thing, though that came as a surprise is that any time David was on the footage, it marked him as an oddity, as if it thought something was wrong with him. Considering how he's been acting, I think it's reasonable to assume that he may not be human either. I'm just worried on what would happen if someone finds out, or tries to confront him, would he go full Akira body horror monster? Would he become some sort of psychic demon? I dunno... but I'm shit scared of him, and to be honest, I'm worried about Jason, because what if David as he is is not the David we knew? I recall him being so much nicer, more down to earth, while the new him is so detached. Could Jason be doing the dirty work for something wearing his uncle's skin? Again, I'm not sure, but I don't want to find out either. 

Horrifying realisation aside, there's another issue, there's something in the vents at the store. No one else noticed, not even Nathan. He had a hunch, but he didn't believe it... I do.   
There's no way a vent clogs like that, no way that it smells like rotten meat. Something is in the vents and no one is noticing it. 

I noticed that halfway through my shift (around nine-ish, sorry, I don't like numbers, unlike Nate.), when I was refilling seed bags in the pet food aisle. I could practically taste the horrid aroma on my tongue when it hit, caused me to vomit, I felt so sick I had to call it a night. Suppose that's the one benefit to being a normal team member now, I can just flunk out when I want, as long as I have the sick leave hours for it. 

I lingered at my own house for a while, before I straight up passed out. I had been barely sleeping for a good while, kept for some reason imagining David appearing at my door with some unnatural grin. The fear had started ever since I saw that the camera always highlighted him. I think you all can understand, right? All those "Consumers", as Nate called them only had their bizarre traits highlighted, so it must have detected something extremely weird about David, then. 

When I pass out, I usually also experience a lot of bizarre visions, for some reason though, this time I dreamt of the store and of it going up in flames, like a funeral pyre. It felt almost prophetic, but I think it's also because, if I recall, Kyle's last words to David were: 

'I'll burn this house of horrors to the ground, you hear me?!'  

You know, writing it down now, it makes sense. I was already tired, so what else would come to mind when I pass out, but the ravings of a completely psychotic man as he's being dragged out like a mental patient? Doesn't really matter though, does it? Something worse happened, which I'll get into now. 

So, I wake up after passing out like a total lightweight at her first rave, pull myself up and notice I have missed two alarms. It was sometime around three in the morning, probably half passed. But I know that I was definitely behind schedule, way behind. Must have been four in the morning when I just got into town, another ten minutes later, I'm at the store. 

I give Nathan a ring, took three tries to get him to pick up, by that time, it was nearly half passed four. 

When Nathan finally got out of the store, he looked worn out, terrified, he was a mere three meters from my ute, I was about to make a joke about him looking as if he had seen a ghost, when the local clock tower struck at half past four. 

Now, I tell you this with full certainty, not pulling your leg or anything- Nathan. Fucking. Vanished. 

He was still in the parking lot of Willy's, I was just outside it. He was just a couple meters away when the clock hits and poof, no more scruffy checkout boss. I was shocked, thought maybe I had seen something. I actively looked around, there was nothing. But his boot prints did remain, but they ended right where he had been. Nathan was gone... gone as if he was just a ghost I had imagined. 

I think I stayed in the parking lot, looking around, trying to find him until five o'clock. That's when I knew he wasn't there. God, I tried to call him, again and again, he'd pick up, but it'd just be static. I think he's out there, somewhere...

Explaining such a thing to his mother would be hard, so, I had to be an absolute scumbag and lie my way into her letting me rummage through his stuff. I claimed he and I were dating and I had taken over for the night, but misplaced the keys. I know, shitty of me, I took advantage of a lonely woman's trust to get her to give me something, but this isn't AITA. 

She also ate up the claim that he was staying at my place for a couple days, it was embarrassing, I'm not even sure if he's my type, we don't know one another too well. But I was able to get a hold of his spare set of keys. I then said goodbye to Ms Weller and left (yes, Nathan's family name is Weller, it's pretty boring.), feeling like the biggest piece of shit this side of the planet. 

The next day went by with me calling in sick, so David would think I was out of the picture, but in reality, I had a plan. I had Nate's second pair of keys to the store, which could allow me to enter after hours. I'm lucky that apparently, I was not caught. The security terminal being my best friend for the night, since it isn't active on those nights, one of David's cheap shortcuts to conserve costs. I did technically trespass, but I don't think anyone is the wiser, at least, not at the moment.

To be honest, I was only doing this because of a hunch, regarding these creatures.

These things only appear a bit into the Graveyard Trading Hours period, so eleven til four. But Nathan disappeared at half passed four. So, if the timeframe is perhaps something like 11:30-4:30, where these things come and go, perhaps that is when they can come into our world... and the inverse. 

I packed the expected items, flashlights, some rations, heavy winter clothes and a pair of bush knives. I did also take a permanent marker. I intended to try and see if I could pass through Willy's and into whatever world was on the other side. 

Getting into the store was easy, I did have the keys, after all. Opening the roller doors too was simple. I opened them just enough in an area no one should notice too well and slid under. 

Weirdly enough, the area outside Willy's was warm, muggy and oh god did it stink. You ever smelt a sewage tank? I remember once I had to help my uncle crack the one for my current home open and I never forgot the stink. So imagine my disgust at smelling such a rancid odour all over the place. 

The walls just passed the hallway that linked Willy's the shopping centre were caked with mould and brown stains, as if concentrated bin juice had been smeared all over the place. Even though I was quickly starting to become drenched in sweat, I was glad for the coverings as it prevented any of the disgusting rot from touching me. 

All the other shops in the area looked run down, as I made my way towards the back entrance of the shopping centre, which happened to take you through a furniture shop, to try and invite you to buy something. Inside it was no different, mouldering cushions, rotted wood, rusted metal... it was horrid. When I got to the automatic double doors that lead outside, though, I found that they had fallen apart, instead, the broken glass worked as the door, whilst the frame had rusted into place. 

The outside world looked so much similar, but also was strewn with mounds upon mounds of garbage. Plastic rappers, half eaten food items, plastic bottles, they all covered any bit of natural aspect of the town's streets, it looked as if someone had dumped a landfill over any parts of nature that existed in the local area. 

The sky was also horrid, ruddy, no stars to be seen, instead a thick range of storm clouds covered the skies and brought down hot, stinking rain onto the cracked pavements. 

I wandered the area for a couple hours, probably three, before I had to head back. I did not once see any of the Consumers, at least while I quietly stalked the streets of the town. It didn't last too long, though.

Around the time I went past Mc'vey Theatre, I saw the stretched out man from Wednesday, MAGA hat and all. He was screaming like an animal at a poster of a woman. I could easily make out that he... no, it, was screaming about how hungry it was. 

I would have been hidden, would not have drawn it's attention if it weren't for that damned Pigeon I saw when I picked up Nathan on Wednesday, as it fluttered down beside me and began cooing for food.

The Consumer's head snapped around and locked eyes with me. Its face grinning as its jaw unhinged, I probably can't say verbatim what it began to ramble out, but I did make one thing out. 

'FEMALES ARE THE BEST MORSELS' 

It charged me. Like, full sprint on all fours. I didn't have time to react as one of it's tiny hands smashed into my left shoulder and pinned me against a dumpster. Stinking garbage bags toppled over me and it, but it didn't care. For me though, it hurt like a bitch. 

The fucker tried to pull off my clothes with its other hand, something about the tender part being the torso. It probably wanted to try and take a bite of my breasts, I didn't let it. It got off my scarf before I was able to grasp my bush knife and ram it into the wrist of the hand that was holding me down.  It squealed like a damn pig. 

I took the moment to then grab my other knife and slash it in the face. It backed off, but I couldn't fight it head on, as it quickly regathered it's efforts to try and pin me. Yes, in that way, this thing was every woman's fear, but god damn it, I wasn't going to let it take a single bit of skin contact from me. I headbutted it when it grabbed my wrists. I think I popped one of it's swollen, oval eyes. It was enough to make it run away, finally. 

The scuffle hadn't been long, but I was forced to wear my shirt, as my winter jumper and jacket had been wrecked, so I was in the stinking hot with only my bra, singlet and thin short sleeve to cover me. Truth be told, it felt better to not be swimming in sweat, but the stinging feeling was worse. My skin was going red raw from the air, as if it was acidic. 

I had no other option but to fall back, head back into the store and leave. But I couldn't leave without at least knowing whether Nathan was alive or not. So I called him, once I was in the safety of the rundown MC's Toys. 

The phone rang... it rang for what felt like an eternity. But he picked up. Thank God, he did. But he was still experiencing static. 

'Nate?' 

'...Sarah?' 

'Nate, where are you?' 

'I... I think I'm at the old look out, up Beverly Hill.' 

Beverly Hill was a good half hour out of town, how the hell did he get there? 

'Beverly Hill?!' 

'I had to, they didn't want to chase where there wasn't concrete everywhere.' 

'Nate, let me come and grab you, I'm sure that there's enough ti-' 

'No. It's 3:45am, you'd just end up stuck here too.' 

'I don't get what you mean...' 

'11:30 to 4:30, the two worlds connect, any time before or after, they are separate. They were right, it's a portal, of some kind.' 

'Surely there is a way to get you back?' 

'I... don't know, not on foot, at least. There's three of them waiting down the hill.' 

'That bad... I'll see what I can do. Hang in there, Nate. Please...'

'I'm trying.'

With that, he hung up. I didn't know what to do, at least, when it came to how to help him, at least, not yet. But I do have an idea...

After that, I went back through Willy's, closed the roller door, left the building. When I got to my vehicle, I ended up having a long and hard cry. 

I don't think I have the emotional stability now to recall it all, but the reason I had wanted to figure this all out is because I had encountered these things before, back when I didn't live in the town Nate and I call home, when I worked as a petrol station clerk. The things I endured, the near death experience... all by things that hide in another world, only to appear elsewhere as a festering blight, all assisted by things pretending to be people.

It's possible I've gotten Nate killed, that I've fucked up beyond compare. I do know, that I am going to post my experience tomorrow night, before I attempt to get Nathan out of that other world, to rescue him. I do know, if I ever see that horrid cap wearing Consumer again, I'm going to take its other eye. 

I'm going to sleep for now, try to then work up the courage to put to post my experience with these consumers and finally mop up my own mess. If I get Nate out, I'll ask him on a date, anything to make him happier, to make up for all of this. If I hadn't asked him to indulge my paranoia on Monday, none of this would likely have happened. The more I pointed out the bizarre, the more it became apparent. 

This is all heavy stuff, I know, unbelievable too. You can believe me, you can choose not to. I don't really care, either way. 

The only thing I'll ask is advice, some tips, I may be prepped sometimes, but I'm just a lady with a screwed up past and a car. I need tips, ideas, survival quick hacks, the like. Just... please help me, please. I don't want to be responsible for Nathan's death, I don't want the only friend I've made in this new home to be dead because of me.

See you all another time, guys.   
I'm sorry that I couldn't give you all much.

\- Sarah.
