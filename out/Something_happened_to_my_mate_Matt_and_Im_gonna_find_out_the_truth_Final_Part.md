Part 5 finale: The trees on the sides of the road were a blur as my car sped along. I was pretty sure that I went over the speed limit multiple times, hence, I got many fines and almost had my license revoked a month later. My heart thumped in my chest, trying to break free and a knot formed in my stomach.

The

Was I really gonna do this? Yes, yes I am, and nothing’s going to change my mind. I had nothing left to lose except life but when you’ve been through what I have, life doesn’t seem to have much value anymore, does it?

After what seemed like an eternity, which was probably just 5 minutes, the school came into view. I was going so fast that I had to brake hard, the wheels screeching on the concrete. I pulled a sharp right, entering the school and into the parking lot. I found a place to park, and pulled the gear into park.

I just kind of sat there in my car in complete silence for a while. I took a deep breath and opened the car door, stumbling onto the pavement. I scanned the perimeter of the parking lot and nostalgia washed over me. I remembered waiting here, in this parking lot, waiting for my dad to pick me up after school. Good times.

“Can I help you?”

I turned around and stood face to face with an old lady. She looked almost like Mrs. Almond but I knew it couldn’t be her, Mrs. Almond would be long gone by now. Anyway, this must be the school staff, perhaps the principal?

“Er yes, I wanted to check out the school. I was thinking of maybe getting my, er, son in this school?” I lied.

The old lady smiled. “We would be glad to accept him, come on, I’ll give you a tour. You can call me Julie, I’m the principal.”

Julie turned and started walking forwards, heading indoors. I followed her subconsciously, biting my nails nervously. When we entered the school, Julie started introducing me to staff and showed me classrooms filled with children but all her words were all garbled and distorted. I nodded my head at all the right times and responded blandly when she asked me something but I wasn’t really listening.

“Ah, look, this is Mrs. Jess…”

I barely heard it, it was faint and soft, but when Julie said ‘Mrs. Jess’ I whirled around madly to see what she was talking about. There she was, Mrs. Jess, a lot older than the last time I saw her, which was decades ago. I locked eyes with her and I saw faint recognition click in place.

“Sorry.” Julie said suddenly, pulling out an old phone, breaking my eye contact with Mrs. Jess. “I have a call to make, I’ll be back with you shortly.”

And with that, old Julie strolled away. I looked back at Mrs. Jess.

“I remember you…” I said to her, dreamily. Mrs. Jess didn’t respond, in fact, she didn’t show any signs of acknowledgement.

“I hoped you’d be dead already…” I say dryly. As I turned around, I saw her brows furrow in anger, but what could she do? She was an old, helpless woman.

“What was that?!” She asked, angrily, spit flying out of her mouth.

“I think you heard me.” I saw, not bothering to turn back to face her. Damn! That felt good!

I exited the school quickly so as to not be stopped by Julie’s return. I saw kids streaming out of the classrooms and into the school yard. ‘Those kids shouldn’t be there…’ I thought to myself as I hopped into my car.

Rain started to pour from the clouds, pattering on the pavement and my car. You know, now that I think about it, the atmosphere was awfully similar to the day when Matt was taken—raining, overcast, and cold. I guess it was just… meant to be.

I put the keys in the ignition and turned it. The engine came to life, sputtering and vibrating. I drove out of the school and parked some way further away from the school, so as to not be seen by any of the school staff or children, somewhere on the side of the road.

I had an umbrella and a poncho but I didn’t even think of using them. I was apathetic as I got out of the car and slammed the door shut, the rain saturating my clothes. The intensity of the rain rose steadily, beginning to flood the roads.

“Here I fucking go!” I said to myself as I marched into the bush with determination.

The decaying leaf matter squelched and squished under my boots as I walked further into the bush. The trees swayed and creaked as I walked past. I swatted away branches and foliage away from my face as I marched, stopping every now and then to pull off nasty leeches from my legs.

After about an hour, the tall trees stopped suddenly. A feeling of deja vu washed over me, but not in a pleasant, euphoric way—in an eerie, uneasy way. I had reached it, the chasm, the edge.

The gaping chasm in the ground was way fucking larger than I remember. Back then, I could’ve easily jumped the chasm, now, I could only jump about a quarter of the way, maybe even less. It grew… How could it have grown? How the fuck could it have grown? And why? Did it grow to get rid of more earth? To be able to consume more because it had a wider opening, a wider mouth?

“FUCK ALL OF THIS!!!” I screamed to myself, seething with confusion, rage, and frustration.

I looked down at the edge, and abstract terror surged through me, making me fall back. Great, my pants were stained with mud and decomposing leaf matter. I slowly and shakingly got back up to my feet to peer down through the damned chasm once more. A surge of terror went through me, but I only flinched this time.

‘Matt’s down there…’ I think to myself. Wait, what? Where the bloody hell did that thought come from? It’s just like the thought materialised out of nowhere in my brain. What the hell…

But now that I think about it, Matt could possibly be down there, down somewhere through the edge. No, he was most definitely down there, I was certain.

Now the question was, would I seriously risk my life descending down into the edge just to rescue Matt? I mean, what happened to Matt has seriously taken a toll on my whole life but I barely even knew him! Matt was just some forgettable kid, I always preferred Jacob.

“You know what? Don’t be a wuss.” I say to myself, clenching my fists and jaws in determination. Coming to a final decision. I take a deep breath, and, almost casually, drop down through the edge.

As I fall down the endless chasm, the sound of the rain fades away and color drains away, being replaced by a black nothingness. I fell into a deep sleep almost immediately…

The sound and sensation of rain splattering on me woke me up. I was lying on my back on the forest floor, spying the tree tops looming high above me. The first thing I noticed was that the rain that was pittering and pattering on me, the trees, and the foliage, was a dark crimson.

The color reminded me awfully of blood. I opened my mouth and a few drops landed on my tongue. The taste of metal bloomed in my mouth, I was definitely being doused in blood. Was some of this blood Matt’s?

I slowly and shakily got up, using my hands to push myself up when I felt a sharp prick on my left hand.

“Ah, what the fuck.” I mumble as I bring my left hand up to observe. There was a thin slit along my palm that was bleeding. I looked back down at where my left hand had been and lying there was a sharp piece of bone.

The bone was grayish in color and looked as if it had been there for a long time. As I got up, watching where I put my hands, I noticed the whole forest floor was littered with bone fragments. This place was wrong. I don’t think I was in the normal world—I was in the edge.

I stumbled forward, walking forward blindly and aimlessly. I continued to walk further for what seemed like an eternity when I stopped dead in my tracks.

I had reached a clearing, and in the middle of the clearing was a car. But this wasn’t any old car, it was Sebastion!

The car had scratches all along its side, cracks spidering along the windows, and the license plate was hanging off the front, DT 57 LM. Vines covered the whole thing, protruding from the ground to swallow up the car.

“No way!” I ran forward towards the car and observed it closer—it really was Sebastion! Wait a sec, who the hell was that in the car?

I yank open the door, though it didn’t open smoothly due to its condition and it emits an annoying screeching sound. Spider webs were everywhere, and the seats of the car were all mouldy and rotten away.

A pile of blankets shifted in the backseat. Slowly, whatever was in the blankets sat up and the blankets fell away revealing a 6-year-old boy.

The boy looked at me with big, wild, scared eyes. He looked malnourished, and his ragged clothes hung loosely. I bit perplexed by this sight, I ask tentatively:

“W-who are you?”

The boy continued to look at me with his scared eyes. “Who are you?” I ask again.

“Matt. I think that’s my name at least…”

The boy’s voice was hoarse and rough, as if he hadn’t drunk water in ages. Hearing ’Matt’ was all I needed. I grabbed Matt and pulled him towards my chest.

“I’m gonna get you out of here, it’ll be alright.” I reassured him and Matt nodded. With Matt held tightly to my chest, I ran away from the clearing, disappearing into the woods once again.

A screech filled my ears—it was a horrible sound, as if static was mimicking a horrible animalistic yelp. Matt flinched and I held onto him tighter as I ran.

“It’ll be alright.” I continued to run, gaining speed as I frantically searched for a way to leave the edge.

A tree branch shifted, descending down from the tree tops and I ran into it, scratching myself on the bony white branch. Matt screamed and I continued to run, being a bit more careful.

Then I froze in my tracks. A dark, shadowy figure stood in front of me. The figure was made of shadow and it pulsated and shifted. I turned and ran in a different direction, weaving myself through the trees in an attempt to lose the figure.

It was no good—the figure appeared right in front of me once again, the black, shadowy mist manifesting out of nowhere, and I couldn’t turn back! The trees wrapped themselves around me and the figure, trapping me in a wall of trees and branches!

Matt was sobbing in my arms now, and I realised how tired my leg and arm muscles were.

“WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT!?!” I shout at the entity in front of me.

The edge entity takes a step forward and I try to take a step back but I can’t! Then gunshots filled my ears—three rounds burst through the edge entity, the shadowy mist parting where it was shot.

I looked for where the muzzle flash had come from and saw Jacob, holding a pistol, standing on the wall of tree and foliage.

“We don’t have much time!” Jacob shouts down at me. “Go, get out of here, save yourself and Matt. I’ll take care of this wretched monster!”

Jacob adds in, bringing his attention back to the edge entity, gun raised. I look at the edge entity and its focus is transfixed on Jacob now.

“Matt, can you climb?” I asked, urgently. He nods. “Okay then, I need you to climb over these trees and onto the other side, alright? I can’t climb and carry you at the same time.”

Matt nods once again and begins over the wall with impressive strength and speed. I slowly climb up the wall, using thick branches to push myself up and place my feet on.

When I reach the top, I take one quick glance at Jacob fighting off the edge entity before jumping down onto the other side. I hope Jacob will be okay.

Matt is waiting for me at the bottom and when I jump down, I hold his hand and start dragging him along as I run. I hear the gunshots from Jacob’s gun in the distance, the sound slowly fading away.

“There!” Matt shouts, pointing off to the right. The edge is there, mouth agape.

“Matt, we're gonna have to jump down!” Matt nods. I hold his hand tighter.

“On the count of 3, 1—” I tighten my grip on Matt’s hand—“2—” I bend my knees, ready to jump—“3.”

I jump, pulling Matt along with me and the edge swallows us whole.

I am in my car, driving on the road. I do not know how I got here. My car pulls up on our driveway, I still do not know how I got here. I step out of the car automatically, and enter the house—I don’t know how I fucking got here!

Diana rushes over to me immediately.

“I’m really really sorry.” She says, dabbing away tears from her eyes with a napkin.

“What the hell just happened?” I asked. “How did I get here, where’s Matt, where’s Jacob, are they alright?”

She furrows her brow, still dabbing away tears but with a concerned and confused look.

“Matt isn’t here yet, Jacob… Who’s that?”

“Jacob, my friend? You don’t remember him?”

“No, there is no Jacob, dear.”

A loud knocking came from the door.

“Ah, that must be Matt. I’ll get the door, but seriously dear, I’m really sorry, alright?”

Diana says, before rushing over to the door and opening it. To my shock, an older version of Matt stood there, with a grin on his face, holding a bottle of Campari.

What the fuck!

Matt spends the day at my place, talking to me as if we were old pals and didn’t just come out from the edge! What the fuck!

When something like this happens to a person, they would try to reach a rational, reasonable conclusion. But all conclusions I reached are not rational at all!

Somehow, a gaping chasm in the earth appears, some entities take Matt and trap him in there, then I come along and save Matt, and now Matt exists in this world again but Jacob doesn’t?

Does that sound the least bit plausible? No, it doesn’t—but it’s the most likely conclusion.

I crossed over to an alternate dimension of horror that Matt had been trapped in. Now Jacob is stuck in there after trying to save me.

Of course I went back to try and find the edge again, in hopes to save Jacob—but the edge is gone. Gone, no trace…

I don’t know how to end this… If me and Diana ever have kids, we’re gonna homeschool them, because I worry the edge still exists somewhere, and it’s hungry for more, waiting to snatch up more poor souls.
