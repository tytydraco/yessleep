I awoke abruptly to the sound of quiet chatter outside my bedroom door, it was early Saturday morning, I’d been up late the night before and hadn’t slept great like the many nights before. I lay there for moment, groggy, trying to come to when my eyes widened as I realised, I wasn’t in my bedroom, I was in what looked like a basement.

I bolted upright and rubbed my eyes, maybe I was still in a dream. To my horror I was chained by my ankles, the chain was about 3 feet and was bolted into a concrete filling in the floor, another vacant chain lay scattered next to me and under me was a putrid, stained single mattress which smelled like stale urine and dirt. 

I fumbled around trying to stand, pulling the chain but to no avail. What is happening? Is this some sort of sick joke? I sat back down and took a few deep breaths to calm myself and try to figure out where I was and what was going on. I scanned the room looking for anything that might give me a clue. Then I spotted a small yellow watering can by the bottom of the basement stairs, I have one just like that? Oh god I was in my own basement.

Confusion took over as I tried to think how I possibly could have ended up in this situation. Ok so..lastnight I finished work at 6:30pm, got home around 7:15pm, had a shower, poured a whisky, made sure the basement door was locked and turned on crappy reality tv like I did every single night, nothing out of the ordinary, I tried to think of anything else I  may have missed but nothing, the last thing I remember was taking the last sip from my glass then… I can’t remember after that? I must have fell asleep. Surely I would have woken up if someone had broken in a dragged me to my own basement. Now the fear really started to set in.

I tried to listen, see if I could make anything out from the whispers at the other side of the door, I began to panic, to scream and yell “HELLO, PLEASE HELP” “HELP, SOMEBODY”. All of a sudden I saw a crack of light shine through the basement door, I stared up, eyes locked and waiting to see who or what id be greeted with. The door opened more and I squinted as I adjusted my eyes to the brightness of the outside world, I could vaguely make out 2 silhouettes at the top of the wooden stairs. “HELP…PLEASE” I screamed, just then a wicked laughter burst from one of the silhouettes, my body frozen as they got closer and that was when I saw them clearly.

Two young looking women, no more than 25 years old, one had long blonde hair that was raggy and unkept, she was so thin you could see her bones protruding through her skin, she wore a light pink dress that looked old and tattered, it was covered in holes and questionable stains. The other girl, who was much taller than her friend, had hair that was dark and cut short, her face was dirty, she glared at me with a sickening grin, her teeth yellow. She donned the same pink dress, except hers wasn’t as tattered and appeared newer. They both just stood for a while, staring, breathing heavily as if in a panic. All of a sudden the blonde girl spoke, snapping them both out of the trance they were in “hello Greg” she seethed, “WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?” I cried “HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?”. “Come on Greg, it was only a matter of time, you know that” she said with a smile. The dark girl stood, still grinning, she began to pull at the hem of her dress, she was nervous but trying to hide it. “Do you know how long we’ve waited for this? The patience it’s took to get to this very moment?” She said softly, I tried again to pull at the chains harder and harder as fear coarsed through my body. They were new, the concrete was fresh but hardened, the lock around my ankle was tight and strong.

They both edged forward, the blonde girl then picked up a chainsaw MY chainsaw that I had purchased a month earlier and began to pull, the loud roar filled my ears as I began to beg and plead, sweat dripping down my face. I know what what about to become of me. All I could think in that moment was how I was going to escape the shackles, but of course I couldn’t, they were unbreakable, I mean I would know right, I did make them.

I then had no choice but to sit and wait for my inevitable demise. 

God dammit Greg, if you’d only finished making them sooner you wouldn’t be in this mess, they would be the ones still in the basement now chained up and helpless, about to be ripped limb from limb, not you. 

“Bye Greg, see you in hell” they laughed
