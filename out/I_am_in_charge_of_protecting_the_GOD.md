Yes, you read it correctly. A mere mortal like me is trying to protect what you would call a God and I was shocked to learn about the truth too. It's not like I am really protecting, no. I am just a witness to something beyond extraordinary and here sharing it with you all even though I know it won't reach out to anyone really. I should begin from the start, so that it all makes sense. It's a bit hard for me to recall what is start or the usual order of flow of time at this point, so please excuse me for that error. 


Alright with no furder ado, it was just a boring regular Monday, September 25. I was walking on the side path of the road, both hands in my pocket and listening to a groovy/catchy song and I spotted a green light emerging from trees nearby. I ignored it and went ahead, 
 that day had so many events unpacked for me that I can't believe so much happened.

 First of all when I turned into my cabin and begin to start working, the CEO showed up and knocked on the door. Ofc, I delayed a bit not knowing it would be my ceo and mind you that 65 year old guy just likes to sit on his comfy chair all day long, so that was shocking. Anyways I did get up and opened the door, almost shocked to see my boss at the doorway. I almost began to menially calculate what I had recently done wrong to get this visit. The eyes of my boss were worn out and he looked soulless, I almost felt sorry for him. From those shallows he was just looking at me and a tick passes with no one of us uttering anything. Alright so in summary I was being let go of the company and the ceo himself visited me to deliver that piece of tidbit. It was shattering for me as I was clinging to this job and it had a perfect atmosphere. I had many good co-workers and one I even liked among them. We both knew each other from beforehand since highschool and today I thought that I better confess it out. 


With my sudden termination though, I decided to skip it and just go out to the park near my home for a change of air. I knew that I could easily get a job soon but what broke me was that I actually loved working up there. Plus nothing made sense like why did the ceo even bother with a person like me, so many places below him in hierarchy. So I went through the same path I came but backwards this time. Again I noticed the same green light emitting near the tree on the side of the road. This time I didn't ignore it though plus it was a perfect time pass for me. I started going towards the direction of this strange light, it was coming from the top of a tree. A little boy, no more than 10 was sitting on it and he looked terrified. 


Me: Oii, look over here. What are you doing up there boy?

The boy: oh umm I...I.

Me: Well just come down now or are you stuck up there. Let's talk sitting on that bench.(pointing towards a bench)

The boy: Alright but let me warn you, you don't want me speaking to you. It's best if you go back through your way Andrew.

Me (slightly agaped at how did this child know my name): Well boy, I am not leaving you alone. *Damn this kid is a bit wierd* what's your name btw and where are your parents?

The boy: I got no parents and if you want you can call me god if you want.

Me: *wth does he mean by God, this kid can sure talk* well explain yourself, what do you mean by God? You mean the creator of this Universe?

God: Not just this very Universe but many such Universes, the creator of hypermultiverse. 
Me(mockingly): Heh hypermultiverse, what a fancy word. You think you can just fool me by your role playing fantasy really? Plus you are just a timid kid. *This kid is strange, why isn't he showing any emotions*. 

God: I forgive you for your ignorance but I really am God Andrew and it was me who choose to seek you, not the other way around. Remember the circumstances today that made you come to this very spot, even though you ignored it and went to your office.

Me( becoming impatient): *this kid is so annoying, what does he think of me really uttering such blatant lies* well alright look here kid, whatever your name really is. You are not fooling me by your imaginary claims. Just tell me your parent or any guardian's number and I would call them for you and if you insist on being God, why don't you just show me a miracle.

God: I can't Andrew. Even though I am God really, inside this form I can't do much or it would know of my presence. I think it already does but I don't want any chances. 

Me: It, are you afraid of something and you call yourself the God. What's the name of it anyway. IT'S NAME IS *****************.
(I felt unconscious after that)

--------------------------------

I was floating up in bubbles, going fast through thin pipes. There were these bubbles all around me, up and down, left and right. The whole atmosphere was fluidy all around, like water. It was like this world was just liquid. There stood a strange being, it was made of entire liquid as fell and floating around this world but it had some distinct features, which clearly resembled the shape of something living. Hell, even my body was the same as it's. 

It spoke suddenly: come here now Xhual, or else we would be late. 

Me: Xhual, who is it? *oh crap I am speaking their language now*

The strange creature: well don't play around now Xhual. Let's go and begin the thing already. 

With that, the creature suddenly created a portal like thing glowing in blue and exited to somewhere. I followed anyway before taking a last glance around my surrounding and distance beyond. It looked really impressive, there were things made all around, many tube like piped structures and some large spheres. They all glowed so brightly that it was looking magnificent. On the other side of that portal thingy the world suddenly changed, it was still fluid all around but this fluid was different. There was a large table like hologram and many of those fluid like creatures were sitting on a beam of light. They then created one for me by pushing a button and placed it around. I sit on it, it was strange as I was just floating around but this was relaxing plus there were distant compartments surrounding me and it looked like it's borders were like spheres. So, I was inside one of those giant spheres. Suddenly all the glazes were made on me and they were all looking at me in some weird way. 

Me: what? 

Yhealta: Xhual, you were right. We tried your method and it worked. 

Me: Oh yes, I am glad. So what are you planning to do next? 

 Yhealta (using a strange device, which let only me hear it's voice): We must be very careful now. If we harness the energy of this big wave, we would be sucking in everything it touches and with it's extraordinary acceleration it could destroy the whole part of Universe. Sucking everything in void. Annihilating everything in it's path.

Me: I.. such a dangerous object. It sounds much more dangerous than even nukes. God why am I witnessing such a thing. 

God: You believe me now?

----------------

With that I waked up. Today was feeling such a cheerful day. I got ready for work, looked at the date and begin going for work... Looked at the date again, it was 25 September, 2023. Well I begin riding or else I would be late. I had a strange dream, that's what I told myself but on seeing a green light emanating from one of trees near the path, I screeched my tires almost. I already begin my walk towards God. He was up there sitting at the top of that tree looking terrified. 

Me: hey, do you remember me?

God: Andrew, it's good to see that you finally remember me in this timeline. 

Me: I don't understand. Umm, so we going towards that bench or not?

God (nodding): Yes. I know that you have experienced strange things, many different worlds and scenarios and you might even remember. 

Me: well yes, I do believe you now. So what happened? Aren't you the mighty God, the creator of this Universe, why do you need me to know about this all and..

God (raising his hand ): I know that you are having loads of question Andrew but I need you to protect me. Till now whatever you experienced is nothing, it's just some matter but at the higher realms you would find beings of the very form of something you might recognise as ideas or abstractions which have no form. This is the lowest realm possible. 

Me: Yes but why do you even need my help?

God: I would tell my story, once we reach at your home. This place isn't safe. It knows I am here perhaps. 

Me (already driving my car with the 10 year old child with me on the backseat): Well it's strange. So can you start explaining a bit, so that things make sense. Like what were those strange fluidy creatures and could they really destroy the whole Universe? 

God: oh my child, I would begin to explain things but let me be clear, the thing you are asking me of is really useless. There are infinite Universe in each Multiverse and many Multiverse but Multiverse isn't aligned or associated with numbers anyway. In each Universe, exists a vast space having multitudes over multitudes of things and creatures you would find. The thing you are asking for is just one among this possibility. There are even things that could control and destroy a whole Multiverse or even the Hypermultiverse but it is I who reign at the top and control everything.

Me: I don't really think that you control everything. Not with what I encountered anyway. So why do you need my help?

God: it's strange but yeah maybe I was not in control. It's only around you Andrew that I don't feel it's presence. I can stay in a safe place and not encounter it even though I have already witnessed it's tremendous power firsthand.

Me: What is it's n..

God (almost afraid): Shush now, don't dare say it. 

We then reached my house and entered it. I was so much burning with questions by now that I couldn't be patient anymore. 

Me: So as you promised, I wanna know everything from starting. Why are you running away and from whom?

God: Alright. Here's how it goes, I am a much higher entity than even some abstraction. It's like I am at everything and every form. I control this whole world, even created it. Then I created other conscious beings and let them know of me the God through some prophets, so that they worship me. Each kind of being knows me differently and follows different ideals and ways of life. I was here since there was nothing apart from me and created things going toward the lower levels of realism hierarchy and at the very base you could see things which are observable easily like you but I was wrong maybe. I wasn't the all powerful, all knowledge being I always thought. From the very starting there was this other being, who was present but I didn't know that it even existed. It watched over me silently as I created the Hypermultiverse and things above it. It never showed any activity and so I didn't know anything about it, infact even now I know nothing about it except that it exists and it was there from the very beginning just like me but it's impossible. I was always there. Anything you can say existed was me and if you find anything else existing it would be me because I was the very pinnacle of everything existing. Such a strange paradox. Anyway I let many being know about me and even worship me but it never let it's presence known. It was always unknown to everything, no conscious being however smart knows of it except I and that too when it sort of attacked me, overpowering me very easily like a child and controlling things even. It's like the most powerful things are not things which you know of but things which you don't even know of and can't even know. 

Me: *that was a big talk but I was listening keenly* So you are saying that there is this one thing which was all powerful instead of you and it's presence isn't known to anyone really. Things make a bit of sense now, thank you. 

The door suddenly shuddered and in came some people having big guns pointed towards me. There were many people rushing in the house. It was terrifying.
