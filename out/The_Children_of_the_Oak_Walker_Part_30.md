[\[Part 29\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1bkctt9/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_29/)

Bullets rang off the hefty steel of the front gates in a sing-song staccato that made my spine tingle in nervousness. The air stank of smoke, five buildings were alight, and there were dark pools of blood spotted on the ground in places from where the medics hauled away wounded fighters. Dark clouds clotted in the sky, promising a long night ahead, and the temperature had dropped somewhat, a cooler, crisper wind taking over to remind me how close we were to November. If somehow we survived this night, we would be forced to uproot everything we’d accomplished so far, and lug it miles to the south, across the ridgeline, to settle in Ark River for the winter. In our old world, moving before winter would simply mean changing houses, packing boxes, and ordering new keys. In this harsh reality, it meant possibly starving if our supplies didn’t make it, freezing if we couldn’t build enough houses in time, being eaten alive by freaks if our ammunition ran out. It was the worst possible move we could make at such a time, but ELSAR had forced our hand, and I refused to die in a hail of rockets after everything I’d endured this past month.  
Peter stood before the mighty steel gates, adjusting his equipment; the brace of pistols, daggers, his boarding axe, and of course, the curved pirate cutlass that hung from his belt. Dressed once more in his battle attire, he held his head high, even with the roar of combat all around us. If he was scared, he didn’t show it. The boy’s face was smooth, calm, like the surface of Maple Lake on a sunny morning. I wondered if he didn’t intend to fling himself into the path of the bullets outside, if perhaps this wasn’t some kind of suicidal ruse to escape hanging or rocket-fire, but I shook the feeling off.  
I’d trusted him this far, and even if he was a pirate, he’d always kept his word to me.  
“Once I walk out, no more shooting.” He accepted a draw from a water canteen held out by Ethan, and Peter kept both eyes fixed on the front gates, as if he could see some kind of end-goal beyond them that none of us could. “Not a round. No matter what happens, *do not fire*, or everything is lost.”  
I handed him the torch he’d asked for, the resin-soaked tip blazing with orange flame, and jumped despite myself as more hateful lead slugs bounced off the metal from the opposite side. “Are you sure about this?”  
He swiveled his head to look at me, and Peter let slide a buccaneer’s grin, dashing and carefree even in his doomed state. “If I’m going to die, I’ll die my way.”  
*And if you do, we’ll all die ELSAR’s way.*  
Without any other option, however, I kept my macabre thoughts to myself, and stepped back as the gates swung open.  
Wet earth kicked up around his sea-boots from incoming fire, but Peter strode forward, never wavering, the torch held aloft, his opposite hand resting on the hilt of his cutlass. Out into the dark he went, down the driveway of the hill, and as he did, our fighters ceased their shooting from the fort’s walls. As our resistance slackened, the returning fusillade from the pirate trenches began to weaken as well, until at last, it died completely.  
Eerie silence blanketed the broad plain around New Wilderness, and standing in the shadow of the gateway, I watched with bated breath as Peter drew one of his pistols.  
He held the gun high for the whole world to see, and a random shot from the pirate trenches whizzed by him to impact in the dirt a few feet away.  
Unphased by the missed shot, Peter continued walking forward, and tossed his pistol to the ground to draw another weapon from his belt.  
One-by-one, he taunted the attackers, drawing and raising his weapons with each step closer to bait them into another shot, and miraculously, none hit him. With every random *crack* from the trenches, I winced, ready for him to stumble back with blood spurting from his body, but Peter never wavered. He seemed to sail into the dark with the torch like a ship in a storm, the lead wailing around his head like lightning from a hurricane, unable to stop his advance. The trail of discarded firearms and blades grew longer until only his cutlass remained on Peter’s hip.  
This he drew, and stopped, holding the blade high for a moment, before plunging its tip into the dirt beside the road.  
“Grapeshot!” He bellowed out into the darkness, his voice loud enough in the absence of gunfire to carry across the field beyond. “I know you can hear me! Come out and face me like a man!”  
Nothing moved in the dark, all the stray fire gone, as if the besiegers couldn’t believe what they were seeing down their gun sights.  
“Come out, Roberts.” Peter tossed the torch to the ground so that it created an aura of orange light around him. “Stop sending children to do your dirty work for you. I’m right here, show yourself.”  
Still, nothing replied from the shadows, and I frowned to myself in the cover of the right-side gate post. What if Grapeshot had been wounded, or killed? I hadn’t considered that as a possibility until now. This entire plan depended on Peter talking to him, and if the pirates had a different leader, or none at all, it wouldn’t work.  
*Peter can only dodge bullets for so long. If I can’t get back to Lucille and the others . . . come on Hannah, you can’t think like that. This will work, it has to.*  
As if insulted by the silence, Peter’s face contorted with a vicious anger that made chills run down my spine, and both fists curled at his sides. “She trusted you, Sam. It’s your fault she’s gone. Tarren deserved better!”  
A shadow lunged from the gloom, half-running, half-jogging up the driveway, one armed raised in Peter’s direction. I saw Captain Grapeshot emerge from the haze, a pistol in his grasp, his eyes blazing with fury.  
My heart skipped a panicked beat, and I squeezed the Glock Andrew had given me a little harder, aware that I couldn’t break Peter’s rule, but desperate to do something.  
“We should take the shot, while we have the chance.” Ethan mumbled from beside me, his own AR in his hands.  
Sean shook his head, eyes narrowed at the unfolding scene, rigid and unmoved like a boulder. “We agreed. No interference. This is Peter’s fight, not ours.”  
Beyond the gateway, Peter noticed Grapeshot coming out of the dark, and he tensed, though he did not reach for his sword.  
Captain Grapeshot stopped a few feet away from Peter on the other side of the torch, breathing heavily in pent-up rage, the long-barreled flintlock in his hand aimed at Peter’s chest. I dared to summon the focus, to let my hearing sharpen as the ringing from earlier healed, and their words came to me as clear as if I stood right beside them.  
“Say it again.” Grapeshot snarled, his voice dripping with hate, the antique handgun shaking in his fingers. “Say it again, and I’ll kill you where you stand, you poxy, lying cur.”  
Peter regarded him with a cold glare and didn’t move so much as an inch backward. “You heard me the first time. She wouldn’t be gone if you hadn’t done what you did. She didn’t deserve this.”  
“I wasn’t the one who let the rangers go.” Grapeshot fumed, and stalked a few feet closer, the sputtering torch the only thing between them, its flames casting bizarre shadows over their gaunt faces. “I wasn’t the one who went soft. You betrayed us, Peter.”  
“No, Sam.” Raising one of his empty hands, Peter jabbed an accusatory finger at Grapeshot’s face. “*You* did. You promised to keep us safe but look where we are now.”  
“We’re alive because of me!” His face red with unquenchable fury, Grapeshot’s voice rose into an enraged scream, and from the trenches curious shadows crawled from their holes to sidle closer to the two pirates.  
“*We’ve got major activity out here*.” One of the rangers whispered over the radio, the squelch loud enough I could hear it from Sean’s belt. “*They’re . . . they’re all moving. We’ve got dozens of hostiles headed for the front gate.*”  
“Everyone hold your fire.” Sean clicked his mic button, his eyes focused on the confrontation outside, and his Clark-Kent jaw set in stubborn resolution. “Let them pass. Unless they point their weapon at you, no one shoots.”  
My spine tingled, nervous anticipation filtered through me like ice water, and I tried not to let fear take over my mind. Something was about to happen, the pirates converging on the little showdown outside our gates, and all it would take for an absolute bloodbath was one stray shot. The potential for disaster was too high, and I realized that I’d sent Peter to his death, promises or no.  
*We’ve got to get a team out there, someone with an armored truck, or he’s not going to make it.*  
“And what good did it do?” More of the children emerged from the dark to watch in solemn silence, and Peter let his volume increase so they could hear, waving with wild theatrics at the inky landscape around them. “We went from one prison to another. We have nowhere to go when the snows come, and once the refugees run out, what then?”  
“Then we *rule*.” Grapeshot swept his arm behind him in similar mannerisms, as if the two were actors on a stage, though the frustration betrayed that these boys were far from acting. “The sea will be ours, the fish, the islands, all of it. We don’t need anyone else. *We* are all *we* need.”  
“For what?” Peter turned his gaze to the dozens of muddy kids with weapons in their skinny hands, and his face took on a pleading expression. “What good is living if everyone hates us? What good is all the loot in the world if there’s no one left to spend it?”  
“And what would you have me do, huh?” Grapeshot pointed his gun at our gates, a move that made my stomach flop for how easily it could have set off a storm of bullets. “Lick the boots of your new masters? You think they’ll love you because you played nice? We’re pirates, Peter, no one loves us; they never have, and they never will.”  
I bit my lip and found myself wince at his words. In a way, Grapeshot was right. They hadn’t just stolen from people; they’d murdered, kidnapped, tortured, and worse. Even in this fallen world, where the laws and courts of modernity had vanished like the spring snows, there were lines that once crossed, were a step too far. Just because they could be granted life sentences meant nothing; they would always be pirates, criminals, thugs.  
*Kinda like what O’Brian said about the resistance, to be honest. And we at New Wilderness don’t exactly have clean hands. No one does, at this point.*  
“That’s not true.” Peter strode up and down his side of the torchlight like some kind of manic preacher at a revival, meeting the eyes of his former comrades with impassioned fervor. “We can still walk away from this; we can make things right, we can help people survive like we did. They’ve promised they won’t hurt us if we join them, and there’s food, medicine . . .”  
“Lies!” Grapeshot roared, though I sensed anxiety in his hunched stance, as Peter’s offer made whispers ripple through the armed horde. “They’re lying, can’t you see that? They lied about the box, they ran away when we had a deal, they kidnapped Tarren, and now—”  
“*I* came north to find her!” Peter beat his chest with both hands and threw his arms apart to give Grapeshot an open target. “*I* was the one who said we should ask for a truce so we could look for Tarren, but you wouldn’t listen. They don’t have her, Sam, but they can help us find her, and all we have to do—”  
“*Captain*.” Nearing the end of his patience, Grapeshot leveled his pistol once more, his movements jerky and tense as he seemed to realize he was losing the debate in front of everyone. “My name is—”  
“Your name is Samuel Roberts.” Peter finally lost his cool, the faux Caribbean accent sliding away to reveal a normal American one beneath the façade as he shouted over him with pain and anger. “You and I were roommates at Sunbright. Grace Harper was our friend, and she loved you, Sam. If she could see you now, it would break her heart.”  
Wide-eyed looks of fear crossed the faces of the pirate crew, and they all took a few shuffled steps backward, their gazes fixed on Grapeshot, awaiting his response. It was as if he were a human hand grenade, and the mention of Grace his only pin, the one thing standing between him and a complete, violent meltdown. Myself, I remembered the shiny rapier from the wall on their ship, the carefully cleaned books, the shark’s-tooth necklace the captain wore around his neck. I’d known a girl was involved, had suspected as much, but this confirmed everything and more. With all their secrets laid bare on the war-torn soil of our reserve, the truth hit me like a ton of bricks, horrible and cruel, but true nonetheless.  
The *Harper’s Vengeance* was more than a ship . . . it was a promise.  
*One made out of love.*  
Grapeshot’s face went white, and he seemed to be frozen, as if trying to will himself to pull the trigger. “Everything I did, I did for her.”  
Peter circled the torch and walked until his chest pressed to the muzzle of Sam’s handgun, a brazen act that made the other rangers in the gateway around me gasp. “Then finish it. Pull the trigger and send me into the abyss. Either way, I’m *done*, and anyone who wants to quit can follow me.”  
With that he spun on his heel, snatched the cutlass from its place in the earth to sheath it, and Peter marched up the hill toward the fort.  
Long seconds ticked by, and no one else moved.  
I braced myself, waited for the gunshot, to see Peter fall, to hear the echo of our defenses as we cut the children down where they stood.  
One of the pirates stepped out from the ranks and gave Grapeshot a venomous scowl.  
“Screw this.” The boy spat and threw down his shotgun to trudge up the driveway after Peter.  
A girl on the left side of the ranks tossed her rifle down too and dashed up the road after the first boy. Two more boys broke ranks, and soon a trickle became a flood, weapons clattering to the ground, each muttering their curses at Grapeshot as they passed. A few of the older crewmembers tried to drag some of the younger ones back into line, but these were torn from their grasp by more mutineers, who hissed insults at them as they rescued their fellows to make the hike to our walls. Under the watchful muzzles of our forces, the few loyalists dared not fire at their fleeing crew, and so all they could do was stand there and seethe.  
Soon, only Grapeshot stood at the base of the hill, flanked by Boatswain Emelia and a few others, a pile of guns at their feet.  
“I’ll kill you, Peter!” Grapeshot holstered his flintlock and shook a white-knuckled fist after his first mate, his voice cracking in the strain of unfiltered hatred. “I’ll cut your heart out for this, you hear me? I’ll kill you all!”  
Wrapped in whirling clouds of impotent rage, the pirate captain vanished into the gloom, followed by what loyalists remained, like coyotes slinking off to their dens.  
My jaw went slack, and I stared at the solemn procession of haggard children that shuffled through our gate.  
*He did it. Mad, brave, fool of a pirate. He actually did it.*  
Peter waited at the gates until the last of his deserters came in, and stopped where Sean, Ethan, Sandra, and I blinked at the spectacle in shock.  
“You shouldn’t have any trouble driving them off now. If he knows what’s good for him, Grapeshot will run back to the ship, and sulk.” Turning to Sean, Peter unbuckled his sword, and held it out in a weary form of surrender. “The *Haper’s Vengeance* is yours.”  
Sean flicked his eyes to the sword, then to Peter, and something in the lawman’s face softened. “Keep it. From now on, you come and go as you please; you’ll be present at all our council meetings, and you will be responsible for all your crewmates, and their actions. As far as your former sentence, consider it remanded to life.”  
Peter’s face twitched into a relieved half grin, and he belted the sword back onto his hip with a polite bow. “Aye, sir. My neck and I thank you profusely.”  
Myself, I couldn’t help but feel a slight weight lift from my chest, and flashed Peter a wide smile.  
*Now we’re halfway even.*  
With the outer fields now quiet, I caught Sean’s gaze, and motioned to the gates. “With your permission, I need to go get my team from Eldar Crossing. I don’t think the pirates know they are there, but we can’t risk them taking hostages for leverage. Can I borrow some men and an armored truck?”  
“Of course.” Sean slung his rifle over his back, the battle over, and lumbered toward the visitor’s center. “I’ll have a team of men go with you. And Brun?”  
I stopped mid-stride, and turned to find him smiling at me, with something like pride on Sean’s stoic features.  
He jerked his head at the pirates, who now sat in the parking lot, circled by guards. “As soon as we get to Ark River, I’m putting you in charge of your own platoon. That was top-notch work. Well done, *lieutenant*.”  
Heat flooded my face, and I scrambled to make a salute. “Thank you, sir.”  
Around me, the fort shifted into a heaving throng of activity, civilians coming out to aid in firefighting, medics calling to each other, and fighters restocking their ammunition supplies. Engines revved from near the mechanical garage, and a team of four riflemen slipped out the gates to collect the pirates’ discarded weapons from the driveway.   
I took a moment to lean back against the gatepost as people surged through the inner courtyard, a single pebble in a stream of faces, and looked up at the sky. Just between the ebony clouds, I could glimpse a twinkle of distant starlight, bright and clear, like a beacon of hope left just for me. How I’d ever made it this far, and who, if anyone, was responsible for my good fortune, I had no idea, but I knew my crazy night was far from over. Lucille and the others were probably scared to death, and the rest of the fort didn’t have much time to cram everything we owned into trucks, carts, saddles, and backpacks before we began the long trek to the ridgeline.  
*Better get moving then.*  
Wedging Andrew’s Glock into my belt, I turned to head for the lodge, and ran face-first into Chris.
