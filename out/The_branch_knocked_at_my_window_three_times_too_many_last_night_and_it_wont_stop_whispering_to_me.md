2009, after a night spent wandering campus, chasing lights and watching the walls breathe. The crack of dawn drew my doughy, bloodshot eyes to a massive, ancient Methuselah pine growing in the middle of the street - in which, as far as I knew, it wasn't there yesterday, the day before, and the days since.

Fifteen years ago, when my sobering sunrise stroll led me to the gates of Hell. Not to be burned by hellfire, crushed by brimstone, poked with pitchforks or pulled by medieval racks, but to have an audience with the devil's pine and together, watch the world end.

It towered over the lavish dorms. Hung high over the campus flags, enshrouding the block in fleets of spiny shadows. Its bristled arms outstretched, twisted over themselves like the ropes wrapped around the wrists of a crucified beggar. The street it grew from glistening with thousands of watery mirrors, running and gathering to its pothole.

It stood; silent and imposing - a constrast to the soft greens and pale reds of the many oaks and pistaches hedging the streets.

"... Am I crazy, or has that weird tree always been there?"

J, my buddy of five years, murmurs, "Oh ya," taking another long draft of his spliff. "Always been there, don't know what you're confused about."

"... Are you even looking at it?"

He puffs his cheeks, standing by for our neighbors jogging past: both blonde and oblivious. As they cross us, he gasses them with stale pot-plumes. The pair cursing between gags before dashing off. J doubles over, laughing at their disgust,

While he choked on spit, sunglasses tipping, my fingers traced the pines's bark: cracked and ashen. Its fractal patterns morphing, spiraling into these unnerving shapes. And while I circled its wide trunk, a gnarled root writhes within the mound of soil surrounding it.

"To answer your question, " J sighs, hoisting himself back up "You could be crazy. Isn't everyone? Maybe I'm not real! A second persona! Your Tyler Durden! Wait, who came first again? Tyler or the Narrator?"

"Fuck if I know, man. I still feel weird. You sure this was only for a night? Got everything you wanted out of this?"

"Nawww, Lady Momoy must be too busy seducing the unworthy. Man, what I'd give for a single night with her... Anyway, you should be fine."

"Are you still tripping?"

"When I am not is the better question."

The ground trembles under my feet, a quiet bellow pushing toward me. Roots of all sizes, arms interlocked by the elbows, squirm. My laces tangle on themselves, kicking up rocks and sending me splashing in a puddle. J laughs again, pointing at my brand new jeans now slathered in gunk; clutching his beanie and kangaroo pouch in sheer ecstasy.

"Yeah, yeah, hope you choke on 'em! I thought you said this shit would pass by the morning!"

Mournful warbles call out from downy patches of the pine's shiny foliage.

"Well, it should've! I'm sure you're fine! Now get up before a car comes by and turns you into another puddle."

I'm then hit with the cloying stench of rot, perfumed in the sweet but metallic taste of soured blood: the unmistakable odor of rotten remains.

Memories flood back, once forgotten, made vivid and haunting. Film reels stashed in the deepest, darkest depths of my mind. The reels, memories: burnt at the edges, as if I held a lighter to them but never finished the job. Enough left behind, but warped beyond recognition.

There's a dog, splayed across pavement. Fangs flared and mahogany chunks scattered by bloody tire tracks. The pine too is there, limbs shaking from an angry gust and leaves giggling.

I clamp my nostrils shut, stifling a crawling sickness behind cupped fingers. J backs off, arms tucked in a grappling stance. Ready to wrestle me away at the slightest inch closer. He retches, cheeks inflated, and chalky skin flushed in a shared horror.

"Dude! You know I hate it when you do that!"

"No. no! It's not you! Can you really not smell that?!"

"Smell what? All I smell is the fresh green of morning ganja, playa."

I row myself away, pushed by a rogue wave of nausea. Not focused on where I was going, but more how fast I could get there. The pine's long arms sending dappled patterns of light, thin paths of dark.

"Wait up! What's wrong?! You're fine, dude! I promise!"

My heel comes down on a lumpy mass. It squelches under the weight and pops as I slid; it sloughing with me. Tumbling to my side, I force up my foot in a panic, finding the sole caked in a syrupy black and patches of fur. A glance ahead reveals what I slipped on - the dog; a puddle of fur and bones. I scramble to it; the folds making up their snout somehow smiling. Its tongue lolls out, drooling and panting with its long bushy tail wagging with excitement.

Hands shaking, I brush its tanned mane, inspecting the deep gash I'd made; swarming with stink, and vibrating the air like leaking vapor. The cracks of the sidewalk blur into waves. The only words I could muster were "I'm so sorry," repeated over and over.  One hand trying to stanch the bleeding by cramming itself inside, and the other scooping its oily essence back in.  Yet, the dog laughs: a cruel series of pants and whimpers.

An echo of feet slapping on pavement pulls me away to, **it.**

In the distance, a figure, bald and hunched; red pants and arms bound in a pale pink hooded straitjacket. It thrashes, listing onto asphalt, heaving itself against the curb. Teeth gnashing at the rubber of its latex mask.

"Hello...?"

It stumbled closer, knees touching and feet split into hoof-like halves. Their lower half a bright, glossy crimson. Bloody footprints trailing behind. The straitjacket stretches; its covering held up by hooks pulling at the scalp.  I then realized: it was bound in skin flayed from their legs.

Speaking in the thousands. One voice cutting through in a pained, raspy wheeze. "... qpanfkg**FOUND**aisuqesld**YOU!"**

The creature charges, skipping on bare muscle. I flee, the dog's laughter cut short by the cracking of brittle stone, bursting into the rushing of water. Steps now wet and sloshing through what I imagined to be curdled seaweed.

Rounding the nearest corner, I vault over an AC unit. Gravel crunching under me as to huddle into a tight ball. The fan's rhythmic roaring enough to silence the mallets beating at my ribs.

"adhjgpsn**WHERE**snfpwmd**ARE**amdjpo**YOU**?"

I stare straight ahead, the whirring above by a dark, writing shadow falling across my tucked-in knees; shivering under its cold silhouette. Rubber, its skin, rips, drenching my face in blossoms of hot steam wafting through grinding molars.

"**I**yoshz**SEE**pnhasa**YOU!**"

Yet, it did nothing more - only prattle to itself; debating on what it should do next.

"**HE**ayxhsm**MUST**qudma**LIVE**posnd**THE**aqpodl**ELDEST!"**

Curiosity, the real worm wriggling in the apple, eats at the core; the rationale: what's it waiting for? You got me, so kill me, not like I can do anything now, so get it over with.

Defying all reason, I look up. Another puff of odorless mist exposing their crooked teeth, thick in black tar. The gash its only airway, pulsing with strangled gasps.

"**HE**ovlapd**WILL**snhfa**COOPERATE**fkap**HE**manpos**MUST."**

"... Are you real?" I ask, lips smacking from a dry mouth.

Gangly shadows dance above, stretching and splitting. The voices halt, distracted by the sounds of leaves skittering on pavement - static. With the twist of its neck, spine snapping and muscle twisting, it reveals a second face sewn onto the back of its head.

The face mine, but flayed into a mask: their sockets empty. Ivory teeth and coral gums gleaming in their cavernous maw. Corners of its mouth spread open with hooks to pull and form words.

"**DO YOUR WORST.**"

It slinks back, the AC's hard surface giving way to soft ground. Blades of grass, thin as hairs, grow tall; framing my view of the sky: now a pitch-black backdrop. No clouds, no sun, no stars nor moon - only darkness. However, the heat of sun continued, beating down with no care. The ground still well-lit, almost blinding.

"T!"

I roll onto my stomach, watching J struggle to catch up.

"What... The fuck?! How did you... Get here so fast!?"

Behind him, a picket fence encloses a house mangled by neglect. Its front door reduced to splinters. Porch peppered in bits of glass and windows boarded. Torn curtains its old skin, the walls, stripped of paint, its brittle bones. And the pipes, rusted veins.

A sudden, scorching gust sears my skin. The house too groaning under the intense heat; whistling through its half-lidded eyes.

The many houses beside it were pristine. Copied and pasted lawns cut to perfection and brick beds overflowing with wormwood, brightened by the golden hues of tall tansies. Children of every age played on their driveways. Some snatching handfuls to give chase.

I couldn't make out their faces, each hidden by blurs streaking as they skipped; like the smoke of burning film reels. Their laughter a cacophony of chirps, gurgled but deafening.

J's mouth moves, teeth bare to pronounce, coming out as more chirps: countless coos and cries. Hopeless and inconsolable, blending into white noise flossing my brain smooth.

I reach up to wave, stopped by a warm, slimy drop splashing on my cheek. Frozen in place, I wipe the glob off, only to recoil as my fist came back smudged in scarlet...

J waves back, motions blurring, oblivious to the blood soaking into their bright blue hoodie now made a murky purple. The distance fools me into assuming his sunglasses were still on, but as he stared more, the more I realized how they looked too round; like orbs of dark.

The children form a ring around us. The swirling haze girdling their heads lifting, revealing see-through chasms where their faces should've been. Shivers run through as a chorus of voices, chanting through the static of a broken mic, serenade me:

"THE ANTS GO MARCHING ONE BY ONE, HURRAH! HURRAH!‚Äù

Branches stretch above, speading across the sky.

"THE ANTS GO MARCHING ONE BY ONE, NOWHERE TO HIDE, NOWHERE TO RUN, WHEN THEY ALL GO MARCHING DOWN!"

My neck cranes, and there, impaled on its obsidian-black needles, were the many bodies of doves. Bellies oozing; all matted and clumped together into a monstrous mistletoe, with the bleached bones of a dog and tires spaced between them.

"Hey!"

A low timbre cuts through the suffering. My gaze darting to where J had last been, hoping he‚Äôd still be there, still soaked in the drizzling gore of the pine, but he's not. Worse yet, the voice, calling out from the unknown, was mine.

I spin around, the hairs on my neck standing when I catch those empty ruins creeping closer. Its boarded windows, eyes vacant of warmth, boring deeper into my soul. A scream erupts from its dark depths. Vocal chords swelling to their limits until what I heard was more animal than man, like a pig being beheaded by the blunt end of a cleaver.

A thunderous bang rumbles the stirring stillness, followed by a sickly pop. Then the distinct thud of a large mass crashing onto boards. Followed by nails scratching on wood and limbs flailing.

That‚Äôs when I met him. The Pine-Man: twitching within the darkness of the doorway. Pointy ends of his boots scraping on the floor. A gravely murmur usurps the children: a general chanting to his frightened platoon.

‚Äú**Dewhurst, do your worst**...‚Äù

The closer he lurched, the more I could make out in the black. How his arms, paved in a second skin of olive green wool, swung with a brisk, impatient flow. His shoulders rolling, legs pumping; running in place.

‚Äú... **It will never be enough.**‚Äù

Thorny vines snake out from a gaping chasm where his head should've been. Mangled mandibles ornate with teeth on charred flaps. Tongue, bloated and loose, dangling from the heap; wriggling as he spoke.

‚Äú... **For as much blood will be spilled.**"

A fur collar, spotted in oily grime, encases his neck, bulging with strain.

‚Äú... **There's no hole big enough to be filled**.‚Äù

A sleeve rose with a repulsive crack of joints. Yellow glove curling, the other hanging loose, index caught in the trigger guard of a shotgun; barrel sawed to half the normal length.

‚Äú... **All will learn, and all will see**.‚Äù

Branches, barbed and thorny, rupture from his fingertips.

‚Äú... **A forest, even in Hell, is best left to be!**"

As if on command, the finger branches bolt, flying to me. I throw myself over, slipping on the slushy soil soaked with blood. Whirling midair, I watch the branches race to the children, lancing though each of them. I plummet toward a spreading a yawning void ready to swallow me whole. Both arms bracing for the impending collision and then - darkness: washing over all things in a cold, inescapable absolute.

My vision holds, body untouched by the nothing, but the world gone... Erased in an instant; leaving me adrift in absence. Unable to speak, to breathe or stand, as such needs went unneeded in the No-Light.

It couldn‚Äôt have been my first time here. Since childhood, I've always had few to no dreams. I'd spend my nights engrossing myself in nothingness, and then return six to eight hours none the wiser.  But this wasn‚Äôt a lucid dreamstate or some interactive nightmare, as I could feel, and all I could feel was cold.

Imagine yourself trapped at the bottom of the ocean. How it seeps into your bones, the pressure holding you; keeping you from moving too much. Served on a platter for whatever beast lurks in the boundless, relentless, nameless cavity of Earth. True dark: there with you before birth, and waiting for you after death. So dark, so empty, and so absurd, I feared it was all there was, could be, or ever has been.

Yet, even when there's nothing, flaws still followed: I could think. And thinking leads to conclusions: like how everything I‚Äôd seen, everything I‚Äôd known, was nothing more than distractions, projections built to keep me from being crushed under the awesome weight of true reality.

And that thing, the Pine-Man, a harbinger sent to snatch me from paradise. Dismantle the lies I've immersed myself in for decades if not hundreds, if not thousands, if not millions of years. Maybe I'm the only creature who's ever existed, dreaming of a time where I wasn't.

I'll learn this again, but did you know the last thing to come and go when you‚Äôre born and when you die is your hearing?

Behind me, a series of wet squelches. Hands stirring in mud. Faint thwacks mixed with the sawing of wood and hurling of bags, spilling and splattering. A newborn‚Äôs cries following another tear of elastic.

I try to turn, until a jerk forces me to face a person, an actual person. The deep navy of her wrinkled scrubs clashing with their sun-kissed skin. Untouched by the dark... Say for the missing head, and her limbs, floating free, held together by long, uneven sinews.

With one hand drifting over, she pushes me back. Sent whirling through the inky black. A light shines in the distance, the No-Light receding from it. So intense and bright, when trying to shield myself, the shadows of bones peek past my arms. The light too recedes, giving way to the asphalt of a road. And then, a quick cut to back again.

I welcomed death. Not caring about how long it'd take to find my body, but a glimmer of waning consciousness ached for whoever does. Until that same ache of sentience catches a voice, her voice. Engaged in conversation with another: the bird and the bull who'd help start the apocalypse.

"Trevor... Come on, amor. Don't do this... Not in my place. Five more minutes and I'm doing mouth to mouth!"

"What the Hell is mouth to mouth going to do? He's concussed, not having a heart attack!"

"And? What if he dies?!"

"If he does, you'd only kill him faster. CPR from you is like French kissing a fuckin' leaf blower."

"Really, Jamison? I'm not that bad!"

"Mami, there's enough cracks in both your walls for the roaches to play hopscotch on. If the care for your apartment is the same for your patients, you'd belong in prison for life."

"... Don't call me that."

Batting away eye crust, I lock eyes with Mari, her hazel leer fenced by dark rings. The chill of latex gloves shocking the edges of my scalp as she raked through tangles of hair. She unties her messy bun of spiral curls, gaze widening and chewing on the band.

"Ugh, por Dios! Could‚Äôve waited five more minutes!"

While she covers my face to hide herself, I sneak a look, catching the way her cheeks flushed a faint rosy hue; I've seen more color in a corpse, but it works for her.

"Training! Yeah, training. Have an exam coming, you know? ¬°Te lo juro por mi madre!"

Before getting another excuse out, she's knocked to the side. Her lips pursed in scorn as wispy tendrils gushed from J‚Äôs toothy grin.

"Oh shit! Still alive! And here was I thinking we'd have to call an ambulance! Imagine how much shit they'd find in your urine test! Datura kicks ass, right?"

*Datura...? Oh, right.*

I'm not a druggie, nor have I ever wanted to be a druggie. J, however, was a true psychonaut; indulging in everything the sun touched and everything the dark hid. So, it was no surprise when I came home last night and found him stirring a stone bowl of seed oil.

Datura, for those not in the know, is an extremely potent and dangerous psychedelic. Grown and harvested for the recreational use of losing your mind. And J, a connoisseur of drugs and a fledgling "spiritualist", was drawn by stories about shamans accessing other worlds. People running into otherworldly beings and gods like Momoy of the Chamush people.

I, as anyone, didn't consent on being sent to another dimension to do conversation and battle with demons and deities. Wizard 101 is good enough for me. However, he needed a sitter and didn't want me to be a "stick-in-the-mud", which challenged me enough to take a sip.  Now, I've handled his drug use many times before, so has Mari: from finding his paralyzed on nitrous to luring him with bread crumbs after a hit of salvia. But as you can tell, he understimated the risk.

‚Äú¬°C√°llate, cabr√≥n!" Mari spat, holding me down by the chest.

"Actually, nevermind... You're too broke for an ambulance."

Mari strikes him upside the head, more than enough to ward him off like he was a pesky mosquito. Defiant to death. Forced to buzz away and live another day.

In a huff, Mari refocuses back on me.

"So, what happened? J told me you guys were out all night. Doing what now?"

Teeth bare, J signals from behind, waving his hand over their throat in a cutting motion.

"W-where, where am I?"

"My place. I would complain about the short notice, but Jamison showing up with your unconscious body at my door? Couldn't be too picky."

J‚Äôs smug voice perks up from the recliner beside us.

"I'm telling you! Dude dropped out of the sky like the gates of heaven closed on 'em! It's -!"

"Impossible. Impossible! He would've died! Instantly!"

"How- how did I get here?"

The two pause, the recliner creaking for J to turn and slump.

"... Your car."

"What?!" I asked, blood rushing to my limbs. Mari pins me down from above, pushing against my throat.

"I hit nothin' this time! Honest! No shades, no high, even had a seatbelt! Well, you had a seatbelt."

I rolled over, scanning over his face between the curling crescents of smoke; his eyes more bloodshot and steaming. *No high, my ass.*

"Where are they? The shades?"

"I uh, dunno. Think I dropped 'em."

"You don't know? I bought those for your birthday! I even had them in your prescription, asshole!"

Mari rolls her eyes, their digits still poking and prodding.

"Why am I not surprised? You should already know, amor. Unless it's ingested, injected, or inhaled, J has, and will, lose it. Now silence, both of you. I'm working."

After some more probing, her tentative touch sends a pulse so painful and so strong, I grit my teeth to muffle wails.

"¬°Uy! That‚Äôs a big ol‚Äô chipote, holy shit!"

Enticed by her words like a moth to flame, J rushes over.

"Woah! Did you grow another brain? First one too small, T? Needed a spare? No shame in admitting it. We've always known!"

Mari slaps his arm with a discarded glove in a playful swat.

"Talk shit when you get higher grades.‚Äù

Despite the harmless tease, the maternal comfort in Mari‚Äôs tone, as if I could do no wrong, gave me reason to lie.

"J drugged me and pushed me down a flight of stairs. Said he wanted to see what colors brains I have. Why else do you think he's so interested in mine?"

The blunt clenched in J's teeth drops, mouth agape.

"... I told you, that never happened!"

Wrath warped Mari‚Äôs dreary dial, "¬°HIJO DE PUTA!‚Äù She lurches in a feral crawl before finding enough footing to give chase. I arise to find J cornered, using her fridge door as a shield. One hand raised in a desperate plea while she whacked him with her one slipper.

"Why are you hitting me?! ¬°NO ES MI CULPA! ¬°NO ES MI CULPA!‚Äù

"¬°Aye pobrecito! Being high ain't dulling this beating!"

Both their blabbering, like styrofoam cups rubbing up on each other, grate on my eardrums. Mari‚Äôs relentless blows on J sending electric shocks through my spine. The bump, my head-heart, thumping at a furious pace.

"Yeah! You ain't shit now, ain't you cabr√≥n?!"

Her prideful shrieks double me over, sound itself dissolving into a nerve numbing buzz. Even as J cackled, the smacks echoing louder and the creak of her fridge swelling; their struggle is muffled by static until... *Tap, tap, tap.*

Someone taps at the window; a short rhythm of knocks piercing the background noise...

‚Äú**Trevor**...‚Äù

And there, framed by tan curtains: the colossal, hazy limb of the pine lurked. Its needles still twinkling with blood and feathers. The apartment goes silent. All sound entropying in an eerie, oppressive calm. Everything made quiet, making way for an icy hiss to brush the back of my neck.

"... **Want me to hurt them, Trevor?**"

"Mari!"

Yanked out of the trance, I leap across the couch. Mari's crumpled to the floor, clutching her stomach and curling into a fetal position. J and I race to her aid, steadying her neck and shoulders with a gentle pry. She recoils, hives budding across her skin beneath our careful grasps.

"What did you do!?‚Äù

J shakes his head. "Nothing! I didn't fight back or anything!"

"Is she overdoing?!"

He looks up, brows raised and furrowed. I snatch J‚Äôs thousand-yard stare by the collar of his hoodie, binding our terrified stares: mine sizzling into their soul.

"Jamison, you didn't tell me how much Datura you gave me, and I'm still seeing shit! How can I believe you haven't done anything to her too?!"

The pink undertones of his face drain.

"What the fuck are you talking about?! Do you honestly think I'd do something like that? To Mari, of all people?!"

Pasty streams of vomit erupt from her, spewing across the carpet and forcing us to step back. She races off, hands clamped over mouth for more vomit to seep through the spaces between. We follow, hopping over her rancid puddle in pursuit.

J outpaces me to the bathroom, wrestling with the handle. The door itself groaning in protest as he twists and yanks.

"Call someone! My phone's on the counter!"

Before I could, I'm stopped by a series of garbled "NOs!" Kneeling down, J pulls out a paper clip, inserting the metal into the notch.

"Ignore her! Phone is on the counter! Go!"

Their yelling drooping into static, mutating into giggling coming from the dark end of the hall; spilling from Mari‚Äôs bedroom. The door's cracked open. Beams of white shining through. And from underneath, a pale finger caresses the bottom rail, gesturing in a come hither motion. The light then flickers; well, what I assumed was light, until I noticed the latch of the door...

It was too round, too even. And the "beams": how they separate with black lines, frayed and stringy like eyelashes. Eyelashes. Another flicker forces the "latch" to move, rolling from side to side as I realized: there was no light, no latch, no beams, only the white, lashes, and pupil of a giant eye staring at me from the crack...

"I‚Äôm fine! I‚Äôm fine!‚Äù

The bathroom handle turns, toilet flushing as Mari emerges. She wipes her lips, hitching her waistline and shaking loose her bun, unleashing a cascade of curls.

Caught on one knee, J gazes up at her. Hands clasped around their paperclip in a prayer-like stance. Regret smeared over his glossy fish orbs in an unspoken penance. Mari, however, bore into him with a look of utter and unbridled contempt.

We both offer our arms, I more following J's lead, but Mari only takes mine. Her forehead collides with my chest, my eyes careening to the bathroom. And in those fleeting moments, truth strikes faster than a boa perched on a branch.

Scattered across her bathroom mat lay multiple amber bottles and crumpled pill packs. And peeking through the mesh of her trash bin, an emergency pregnancy test labeled positive.

J, pushed aside, tries to latch himself on Mari, but she slams the door on his foot with a quick kick of her heel.

She pulls me close, arms woven around my waist, refusing to move without me. The two of us locked together in a slow dance of a shared disquiet. We huddle on the couch, curls draped across my neck and our knees fusing. J, meanwhile, ransacks the fridge; shoving aside leftovers from last weekend‚Äôs party.

Even from Point Nemo, a hungry J with his oversized snout and uncanny attention to detail could sniff out seafood joints by the dozen. With such ability in mind, I have to keep Mari distracted long enough for the pungent scent of imminent breakdown to waft up into her vents.

"Found out what they‚Äôve been putting in the hospital lunch?"

A small, wiry smile plays on her full but chapped lips. Globes shimmering, threatening to spill onto their lap. I lean closer, subsumed by curls, and whisper:

"Where else do they store the bodies? Subway! Eat flesh!"

She snickers, dabbing her lashes.

"Yeah... Didn‚Äôt think a heart could be so gamy...‚Äù

The puffy welts on her bronze skin fade, leaving pretty, oval patches of cherry red.

"What? Never eaten a heart before?"

"Never had the pleasure, no."

"You mean, the heart for it?"

A shared sneer eases the tension, only for what little peace we held to be skewered by J‚Äôs dead-eyed stare. He takes another long drag from his blunt, blinking slow to croak.

"Am I missing sumthin' funny or?‚Äù

Silky miasma swirls in his dilated pupils, roasting in pupils in sagging corneas.

"You alright, Mami?"

Mari waves him off with an irritated sigh.

"Yeah, yeah, bufon. I‚Äôm fine. Nothing for you to cry about.‚Äù

J shrugs. ‚ÄúSee any tears on this chiseled face?‚Äù

I stare, eyes squinting. "Those sunglasses did your flabby face a real favor, man. Guess your next gift will be a paper bag."

A swift underhand toss sends a water bottle arcing towards me. Beams of sunlight diffuse through the plastic as it draws closer. Not thinking, my hand shoots up. The catch sending a bone-deep jolt and stealing breath.

"Oh shit!‚Äù J scoffed, a geyser of laughter held back by biting into his fist. "Didn‚Äôt know you were still practicing for the little leagues, champ!‚Äù

Little did he know, my surprise far exceeded his. Why? Because my hand-eye coordination was once so bad, so abysmal, when I actually played catcher in little league, I got hit with the ball so many times, the team argued if my nickname should be Magnet Man or Sheep Man. If you somehow get the reference, the Mega Man supremacy continues.

The bottle, cradled by I, a proud parent, is snatched from my delicate hold. One flick of Mari's finger enough to send the cap sailing before downing every ounce of it; a vampire feasting on the innards of my trophy child.

J‚Äôs jaw went slack as the plastic crunched and folded over her lips. A blazing pink blush surging as she flung the flattened remains behind the couch.

I force a chuckle, hoping to sidestep Mari‚Äôs murderous lour at J‚Äôs excited aversion.

"All good man... Maybe you‚Äôre the one practicing too much."

The two groan, "Right..." J's more cheeky, Mari's more disapproving; both equally dubious in their delivery.

Our unspoken words tug on the air, punctuated by the shuffling of feet.

"... How about we stick together for the night? Maybe order some pizza, or, oh! There‚Äôs a new horror movie- "

"REALLY?!‚Äù Mari squeaked.

Though fatigue showed in her eyes, the joy she radiated rivaled a neglected puppy being adopted. J, however, arms crossed and chest puffed, spoke out in protest.

"Pardon? As in, you staying here? You've never stayed the night here! Or anywhere near a girl since I've known you!"

To be fair, he wasn't wrong. It took me months before I slept in the same room with J, even longer to have consistency.

"And? Not like there's something wrong with that, Jamison!"

"I'm not saying there is! It's just a little weird, right?"

"Weird that he wants to stay here and look after me? At least he offered!"

"The fuck does that mean?! I offered to carry you! YOU'RE the one who pushed ME away!"

Mari's pointer finger shoots out, jabbing at him as she snarled.

"I did! No shit I did! Because it's your fault! You're the one who got the wrong pills!"

Helpless to intervene, I could only flinch as the flames from each of them spout and crackle.

"¬°Porqu√© to equivocaste de pastilla! Y hora estoy embarazada por tu maldita culpa!‚Äù

J stumbled back, mouth agape.

"No... No way...‚Äù

".. TU me hiciste esto ... Y ahora me vida... Mi carera... Todo esta arruinado!‚Äù She roared through gritted teeth.

"Parar... Please..."

Mari, gaining hefty ground, doesn‚Äôt give J any chance to retort; winding up for another swing of the napalm tennis ball.

"¬°Hasta un burro sabr√≠a la deferencia!‚Äù

"Stop! Stop it! I get it, I get it!‚Äù

"Why should I? You ruined everything! You-! ‚Äú

"¬°C√ÅLLATE LA BOCA! PUEDES CALLAR ESA MALTIDA BOCA?!"

Startled, Mari‚Äôs eyes bulged from their sockets. She rises to march, hips swaying in an erratic gait.

"I'll say this in a language you can understand motherfucker- "

I hurl myself between them, hands clamped on their shoulders to slow the momentum.

"Alright now! Mari, you've said what you needed to! J, shut up!"

"If not for you, running from your mansion, your rich parents, your entitlement to the ground you walk on, I wouldn't be stuck with a junkie for a sperm donor! ¬°DE TAL PALO TAL ASTILLA!‚Äù

"At least I have parents to run from! Be grateful your kid might, MIGHT, have two!"

Ouch. *Didn't know he started using rubber bullets.*

"LIKE I'D EVER WANT YOU TO BE THEIR FATHER! YOU- SU- ¬°SIGUE JODIENDO! ¬°VAS A VER! ¬°TE VOY A MANDAR PARA TRAS CON TU QUERIDA MAM√Å QUE NO TE QUIERE CABRON!"

Veins bulge on J's spotted temples. Venom flooding his irises. Lips twitching and cracking under the weight of offense.

"My dealer said they were legit! Maybe you didn't take them!"

Mari‚Äôs brow, honed to cut, softens, arching high in utter disbelief.

"¬øQu√© carajos dices? You think I did this? On purpose?"

J's thunder weakens, tiring into the faint rasp of wind whistling through the debris of a friendship; demolished by the blind idiot tornado that was himself.

"... You came onto me! How do I know you took them?! This was YOUR plan! Make him jealous, and look, he doesn't care!"

Mari looks to me, cheeks flashing red and words catching.

"I- no- what the fuck are you talking about?!"

"Listen to me, Mami! You don't need him! We can work this out! Maybe it's... It's a good thing, you know? It could- it could help with your status and stuff!"

"S-so what? You want us to get married? Ride off into the sunset? Not a damn given about what I'd want, WHO I'd want?!"

Mari hisses between tears, cutting down at J's resolve: her blade forged by wrath, sharpened by betrayal, and his shame cutting deeper than any blow she could make.

"I am not stupid enough, not careless enough, and especially not LAZY enough to earn my citizenship at the cost of my body and my freedom! And FUCK YOU for ever assuming I would!"

Near statuesque, she stood motionless, an effigy of ash; unable to be moved or move without falling apart in powdery clumps.

"... Get out."

A sullen grimace contorts J‚Äôs face upon hearing those words. He pleas to me through his sunken eyes, begging for me to tap in and justify his actions - to no avail.

An ache consumes me, beyond flesh and bone - hollow and dull. I'm not bothered by the senseless slaughter of my friendships, nor the idea of them coercing each other to fuck for me take interest like they're attention starved rabbits. The ache more emerged from the inability to pick a side. My confusion mirroring that of a child‚Äôs after walking in on their parents playing hot potato with their rings.

Choked sobs escape J, throwing open the door. Its hinges screeching before he vanishes into the glow of evening. A shudder running through the apartment, Mari‚Äôs hanging plants swaying; their withered buds and brittle leaves crumbling as they shook in a literal death-rattle.

Mari creases from a pained percussion of hiccups. Digits folded along her hips to trace up their body. Touch lingering on loose strands of hair to pull at, wearing a mask of unflinching apathy; even flicking away her tears as though they were droplets of rain.

"I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm crying."

"Mari... I'm so sorry, I'm sure he didn't- "

"I know."

I leaned in for a hug, hoping to rekindle any traces of warmth in her lifeless gaze. Once she notices, more the effort it took for me to offer, she throws herself onto me.

"Whatever you want to do, we'll do it, okay?"

My head-heart pulses with an electric, nagging pain; my skull, pure bone, bubbles as if being microwaved. Mari yelps, my hold on her tightening, her pleas lost to the droning static.

At her window, branches bobbed against the glass. Then pulling back as the pine, gnarled and giant, whirls in place. Its many arms bent around its warped body stretching. Joints cracking with so many pops, I could've mistaken them for gunshots.

Slender needles sway among the bright oranges like flames and cool purple palettes of the setting sun. The approaching night framing its wide trunk, outlined in shadow; an enormous gnomon of a five story sundial. It dances. Large as the buildings behind it, dancing over the skyline of Oakland. 

Thousands of its arms fork out into more arms, blanketing the streets a hail in darkness, filling every crevice to snuff out every morsel of light for miles. It lowers one if its larger limbs, bough bending downward to form a slide to the streets below. A slide for these, *things,* to crawl down from the dark thickets. 

Compelled by a want, a need to see more, I push Mari aside and dash to the window. View cupped and magnified by fingers in makeshift binoculars.

The first to be seen: ‚ÄúTwig-Thing". A crude figure made of twigs, twine and feathers. It races a stripped chassis. Bright red blemishes of rust marring the metal and skittering on wobbly rims. The driver, a reflective blur: censored from comprehension. They bump into each other along the spindly ramp, both struggling to knock the other off.

"**Behold...**" The voice within, the Pine-Man, spoke.

Last of them, the Bone-Breed: a collection of bleached bones held together with grey tendons in the vague shape of a dog. Specks of weak sunlight filtered past its open ribs, glinting off its shriveled heart: a bag of tiny muscle throbbing with air rather than blood. Unlike the others, it stays in the brush, watching their brethren wander the Earth.

"**For I bear fruit once more!**"

It howls, a thunderous roar shaking the ground; the first trumpet of the apocalypse singing, ushering the end of man - a plan fifteen years in the making. And the seventh just sang yesterday.
