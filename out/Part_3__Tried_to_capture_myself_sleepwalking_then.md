This will be my last update. Today has been… too much.

I spent all of the morning trying to call and get a hold of my wife. Nobody was answering my calls. I tried everyone I could. I found that people were now starting to block my number too… People I would consider my closest friends. Why would they just suddenly cut all contact?

Well, honestly, right now, I don't care about them, I just need my wife. 

I miss her so terribly, and just when I need her the most, she isn't here. There is nothing I wouldn't give to feel her embrace right now. She is the one thing in my life that keeps me grounded and lights up my world no matter how dark it gets. Without her, the darkness has closed about me, strangling me. I'm scared and alone. I feel like a child.

I was supposed to be back at work today, but I called in sick and instead decided to go try her mother's house…

After an uneventful journey on the bus and a short walk, I stood staring up at my in law’s house. For a few minutes, I paced, building up the courage. Eventually deciding I better just do it. I walked up to the front door and knocked. Nothing. I walked around the house to the back and tried to just open the back door. Locked. It didn't seem like anyone was home. I tried a couple of times more. Tried to peek through the windows… but not a peep. 

I'd given up hope and had started out of the garden gate when suddenly I felt the phone in my pocket begin to buzz.

A private number was calling me. I glanced back at the house, still no movement, maybe it was work? I answer.

“Hello?”

“Don't come back here again… And please stop calling.”

My stomach twisted as it jumped up into my chest, it was my wife. Well… it was my wife, but I could scarcely recognise her voice and her tone. I have never heard her talk to me this way before. She sounded wrong. All of the warm bubbliness that embodied the voice of the woman I loved most in my mind was gone. Replaced by a cold, emotionless monotone. She sounded like she had been crying for hours and chain smoking because she was barely able to get the words out.

I felt like she was about to hang up straight away, so before she could, I blurted out as quickly as I could, “Wait!... wait. Please just… tell me what you saw.”

Silence. A shaky breath. More silence.

Then, in a ragged whisper, she spoke, “You don't want to know.”

“I do, please.”

I could hear her sobbing. Not out of sadness, but fear. She was terrified. The silence continued for a minute or so, broken only by her soft sobs.

“I saw the real you.”

“What? What do you mean? I am the real me. I love you. Please don-”

“No. Stop trying to trick me. I saw you. I saw… what you really are."”

“Please… please just tell me what you saw. I'm so confused. Was it the way I was walking? Was there something wrong with my movements? Please, I'm trying to understand.”

“No, no… it was worse.” The memory caused her great pain, I could hear it in her voice.

I waited. My heart was now hammering so hard I could feel it throughout my whole body.

"At first, it was just you coming down the stairs," she said. "Slow, jerky… like you weren’t fully in control. But then, when you passed the camera, it… changed."

"Changed?"

She sucked in another breath. I think she was smoking now. Her next words came in a rush, as if she was forcing them out before she lost the courage.

"You stopped at the bottom of the stairs. You turned toward the camera. And then… your face…"

She started crying. Full-body sobs muffled like she was pressing her hand over her mouth.

"Tell me, please." My voice cracked.

"You… It smiled."

The memory of that eerie, too-still movement flashed in my mind. But that didn’t sound so bad.

"A smile? Just a smile?"

Her sobbing grew harsher. "No, no, you don’t understand. It wasn’t a smile, it was…”

She broke off into unintelligible mumbles gasps. I gripped the phone tighter, my own breath shaky.

"Your eyes… Jesus Christ, your eyes…"

"What about them?"

She whimpered. I didn’t realize how badly I was shaking until the phone quivering in my hand nearly slipped from my grip. Her voice dropped to a shuddering whisper. "You… looked at me."

Cold dread trickled down my spine.

“You turned, you looked straight at the camera, and… and it was like you knew I was watching. Like you could see through the screen. And then…"

She broke off again, her breathing shallow. She takes a draw of her cigarette.

"Then what?" I whispered.

"Then… you spoke."

The line crackled with static.

"I heard you. I heard you whispering my name from the phone speaker. And then you said…"

I could barely breathe.

"You said… ‘I see you.’"

A long pause. Then, barely audible, she whispered:

"And I think you still can."

The call disconnected…

I stood there, staring at the screen of my phone. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't collect my thoughts. I wanted to cease existing.

I slumped right there onto the ground… defeated. As I did so, my wife's phone slid from my pocket, clattering to the pavement. I still don't remember having put that into my pocket. 

I pick it up and click the side button. On the screen, there is a motion alert from the Ring App…

I gulp, visceral fear building, making me choke on my own breath… but I find the courage to hit play.

It shows me standing… it standing… No, me standing looking directly into the camera at the bottom of the stairs…

I'm going to try to describe what I saw, but words were not made for this…

Imagine a face stretched beyond the limits of human anatomy. My skin pulled so taut over my skull that it seems close to tearing open. My mouth… too wide, is frozen in a grotesque, rictus grin. My lips are cracked and split at the edges, as if I had been forced to smile for far too long. My teeth themselves are uneven, jagged, and spread apart like my mouth has space for double the amount of teeth.

My eyes… my eyes are the worst part. My eyes aren’t just wrong, they’re hungry. Hollow pits where eyes should be, but inside them, something shifts in the darkness. Watching. Peering. With malice so pure it feels like the air around you curdles. And yet, even with the lack of pupils, you know it's staring directly at you, into you.

The skin twitches and shifts, almost as if something inside me is pressing outward, trying to get free. And the longer you look, the more the face changes just slightly at first, a tilt of the head, a widening of the eyes, but then you realise… you can't remember how it used to look. A fraction of a second behind, like a reflection struggling to keep up.

As I watched, the smile grew wider, and wider still.

There is no kindness in that smile. No joy. Only an invitation to something worse than death. Like looking directly into hell itself.

The recording finishes. The file is nowhere to be seen and I stare at the phone… stare until the screen goes black and I see my reflection on the screen… smiling back at me… and I realise, like waking from a dream… the smile has always been there. Maybe I've always looked like this. I can't even remember how I looked before.

I felt myself start to slowly drift into a dream. As a looked at my reflection, sleep started to take me, right at the side of the road outside the garden of my mother in law’s home. I'm exhausted. My last thoughts, “I hope it's a nice dream, where me and my wife are happy.” 

I feel myself stand up.

Now I'm laying in bed at home, alone, in the dark. I haven't yet moved. I'm not sure if I have ever moved…  I am typing this on my phone. As you can guess, this will be my last update. It's likely the last thing I write ever. The last proof I was ever a good husband, hard worker, and decent human being… the only proof I ever existed at all. Because my wife was right… I can still see her.
