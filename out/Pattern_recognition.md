"Before you go, I wanted to tell you about a new research study." Sarah says.

I've been seeing Sarah as my therapist for six months now and she's worn the same cardigan to all of our sessions. I know that this is for my benefit as she once said hello to me when I came to reschedule an appointment and she was wearing a green jumper instead. The cardigan is unbuttoned today and a small part of me is dreading the inevitable wardrobe change of summer.

"What kind of study?"

"It's to look on the effects of a training regime to help people with prosopagnosia to recognise faces. They've been developing some software for the past five years and now they're ready for their first trial. Would you be interested?"

"Sure."

It's not something I say with enthusiasm. I've failed to recognise my sister when she joined the same gym as me and a particularly disgusting ex once took advantage of my condition to try and chat me up after our breakup whilst pretending to literally be a whole new man. Fortunately that last event happened at a party and a friend quickly swooped in but still, you can see why I wouldn't be overly optimistic on the matter.

I received an email with information about the software the very next day. There was even an app version as well as a website. Both logged the time I had spent training and told me what 'level' of facial recognition I was currently at. It was sort of like duolingo or those brain training games. I still wasn't feeling very hopeful but I was worried that Sarah would ask to see how many exercises I'd completed and I didn't want to look as if I hadn't tried...

The first week was frustrating. My level was apparently creeping upwards but it felt like I was guessing a lot of the time. In the second week though I started to actually improve. I recognised the people on the app—really recognised them—and even managed to recognise my sister when she was in the gym's sauna. Her hair was wet and curlier that she usually styled it, her face was flushed and the light was dim and yet I still knew who she was without her opening her mouth! I was elated.

Soon I was spending every free moment on the training app and I was making a game of recognising people who I saw in my day to day life. There were a couple of people at my gym who must pretty much be my neighbours as their faces reappeared regularly and I'd never even known. I begun to be able to recognise which actors were featuring in more than one of my favourite shows. I became obsessed with my own reflection, fascinated that I could now recognise it as my own even in things that weren't mirrors but windows and screens.

One of the exercises in the pattern recognition software would show me a complete, normal face and then a version of that face made of only dots or dots and lines. Sometimes it looked like the result of motion capture software or similar. I was then challenged to pick out this dot and line face out of other faces made of dots and lines. I'm not telling you this because I think it's interesting but to explain why the first time I saw a disembodied face I wasn't actually worried. It was in a towel that I'd left scrunched up on the floor. I'd heard of people seeing face shapes in places where no faces could be before but, perhaps because of my condition, I'd never experienced it.

"Who are you then?" I asked the towel and stared at it in wonderment before deciding that it probably didn't belong on the floor - face or no face.

I kept reaching new heights on my favourite app. I showed it to my friend Lisa one day.

"So it shows you this face see, and then it shows you the same face again but it's been distorted in some way and you have to pick it out of a bunch of others distorted in the same way. In the earlier rounds the changes were very subtle and the person would just go from a neutral expression to being slightly annoyed or tilting their head differently but I've gotten so good at it that it gives me more extreme distortions now. Are you ready?"

Mary took one more second to memorise the face of the man on the screen and then nodded decisively. I pressed a button and the normal face disappeared to be replaced with a set of ten wavy, murky faces.

"Wait, what?" Mary exclaimed, "No, that's impossible! I don't know. Four. My guess is it's number four."

"It's seven."

I pressed face number seven and my selection was outlined in green, the sign taht I'd chosen correctly.

"That's crazy. Did you guess? Or have you already done this one?"

I smiled at her proudly.

"Nope! None of the questions are repeated. I just knew."

"Wow. I guess you won't need me to be protecting you from scheming ex boyfriends anymore."

I shrugged.

"I don't know... I mean this app has improved my facial recognition but it hasn't improved my taste in men. I'm sure I'll date people with new and interesting ways of screwing me over for you to save me from."

Seemingly in response to an argument that I hadn't been following, the barman turned the TV off and I looked up at it instinctively, ready to test my ability to pick out any faces that might be reflected on its surface. Instead of the barman or any of the patrons though, I saw the face of a woman from my gym. Her face was so large in the screen that if it'd been a real reflection then she would have to have been stood inches from the screen, so close that she'd have blocked the whole thing.

"You okay?" Mary asked.

The face in the TV was gone already. I'd known that people could sometimes see vague pretend faces in clouds and the like but I hadn't known it was possible to see faces that didn't exist in a good level of detail on flat surfaces. Or that the face could be a face you'd seen before.

"I'm fine." I replied.

Maybe it wasn't the same face. My recognition had come along leaps and bounds but it probably wasn't perfect yet. I'd probably just seen a similar face and thought it was the face of somebody I'd seen before. Perhaps if I kept training this kind of thing wouldn't happen.

I was on a bus the next time something like that happened. I'd already reached the point where I could tell which of the faces sat around me I'd seen before on our daily commutes but the face that surprised me today wasn't on the inside of the bus. It was dark and miserable outside and in the reflection of one of the windows, I saw him. Towel Man. A face that I'd first seen on a crumpled towel on my floor and now here he was, reflected in the window. I looked in the seat where he must be sitting but there was nobody there. Looking back at his reflection I realised that although I could see his face, that was all I could see. There was no haircut, no shoulders, no body...

The bus slowed to a halt and I ran out into the rain even though I was a good half an hour's walk from my usual stop. I felt sick and I needed to be away from the face. For the first time since I'd started my training I did everything I could to avoid seeing any reflections in the windows I passed. I stared resolutely at the floor in front of me and when a series of cracks in front of me formed a face that I knew was familiar I actually screamed. I ran the rest of the way home and hid under my covers like a child, closing my eyes to keep any faces out of my vision.

I called in sick to work the next day and it wasn't entirely a lie. I *did* feel sick, my tongue tasting acid anytime I thought too hard about the faces I'd seen. Why hadn't Towel Man had a body? There was another revelation gnawing at me, waiting for me to figure it out. I didn't want to know but eventually my brain asked me the question anyway. The woman in the TV that I'd seen in the gym, had she definitely had a body? Or had I only seen her reflected in things, somewhere that she could conceivably have been stood behind others or through thick steam in the steam room? I left my room to get a drink and pretended that I couldn't see the outline of a face in the wall.

Could this still be relatively normal? I googled 'seeing faces where they shouldn't be' and came across the concept of pareidolia but that seemed less intense than what I was going through. I tried a few more searches with slightly different terms and Google suggested everything from spiritual reasons to outright schizophrenia.

It wasn't until the next day that I thought of checking the contact details for the people who'd made the app. I went to open the app up to check for a 'contact us' section but instead the entire app was down for maintenance. Desparate, I decided to head down to my therapist's office. Every part of the task was a nightmare. Open my wardrobe to get clothes, there's a face hiding in the folds. Look in my bag for my keys, there's a little face there too. I closed my eyes for some of the bus ride just so I wouldn't have to see the disembodied faces and when I arrived at Sarah's office I must have looked terrible.

"I'll see if she's free." the receptionist said almost as soon as I walked through the door.

Sarah looked worried when she came out to see me.

"Hi, it's me, Sarah."

"I know."

Her hair was tied up and she was wearing a shirt with no jumper or cardigan at all. Previously these changes would have made her a complete stranger to me but not anymore. We walked to her office.

"What happened?" she asked.

"It's the study, I th-"

I stopped myself because I realise that when I'd said that the study was the problem, Sarah had tensed up so much that it was almost a wince. She'd discussed my prosopagnosia and the anxiety issues that had given me with a perfect poker face in the past but she knew something had happened with the study.

"It isn't just me, is it?" I asked.

"There have recently been some reports of other members of the study seeing faces where they didn't expect to. This has only happened very recently though and whilst it might seem distressing, seeing an occasional face in the shadows can be very normal. The study has been paused for the time being though and even when it starts back up, nobody's going to make you continue if you don't want to."

I wanted to ask her for more details or what to do but I saw a face in the shredded documents in the wastepaper basket by Sarah's feet. I'd seen her face before, she was familiar to me. But worst of all, her eyes moved to look right at me.

I ran out of the room despite Sarah's pleas for me to wait and turned all of the lights out when I got home. As I write this the phone's glare is the only light in the room and even that feels risky. But I had to tell somebody what was happening because I don't know what these faces are but they're *everywhere*.
