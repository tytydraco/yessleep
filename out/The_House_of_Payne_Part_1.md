"Don't you ever get tempted?"

It's not a question the locals ask. Thirty years might have passed since the death of the last Payne, but they still remember the family.

Occasionally, though, a tourist will come to stay in one of the cottages the locals have been priced out of, to stroll around the lakes that have been ours for centuries and drink themselves sick on our ale. Inevitably, they'll end up in The Red Lion, where someone who should know better will tell them the peculiar story of the house on the hill.

When I arrive - as I'm inclined to do most nights, after I've locked up for the evening - the pub will fall silent when I push through the door. Although no words are spoken, I can read the darkly significant looks that pass between them. "That's the one," they seem to say. "The woman I was telling you about."

I don't blame the locals. The story's good for a free drink, and I take advantage of it every bit as much as they do.

Once I'm ensconced with a glass of wine or shandy, the clumsy dance begins. The tourist remarks about the weather; asks about my day. After a few minutes, they steer the conversation towards how I make my living.

Of course, they feign surprise when I tell them.

"I don't think I could resist it," they say. "A massive house sitting empty like that - I'd have moved in by now."

Inevitably, I'll respond with some guff about duty - some notion about not wanting to abuse the trust my former employers placed in me.

From time to time, a woman - somehow, it's always a woman, usually leaning into her partner's shoulder as she shudders - will come close to the heart of the matter in her response. "I get it," she'll say. "It'd be too creepy."

She doesn't feel the weight of history - not mine  anyway. But, yes; creepy pretty well sums it up.

Like my mother and grandmother before me, I began working for the Paynes as a young girl. Although they were modern in their pursuits and industry, their idea of service was firmly lodged somewhere around 1904.

"New money," my mother once explained to me with the air of a dowager duchess. "They feel they've got something to prove."

I stoked fires made redundant by central heating. I dusted figurines saccharine enough to make sentimental old ladies retch. When their friends - old names, no money - visited, I served tea and cake in the parlour.

The work was hard going. My parents' home was a fifteen-minute walk down the lane, but long hours forced me to live in. In the winter, I was hard at work by dawn. In the summer, long before that. Only after Mrs Payne had been seen to bed with a cup of hot chocolate was I permitted to retire for the night.

But the money was good. Servants might have been ten a penny ninety years prior, but in 1994, you had to pay a decent amount for that level of service. And at least I didn't have to wear a corset.

Just a few years, I promised myself. I had left school with a handful of dismal qualifications and no sense of direction. All I really wanted was to leave - to move somewhere bustling and anonymous, where my neighbours wouldn't hold grudges over someone's grandfather knocking down their fence in 1947. I would save every penny of the Paynes' money and use it to get to the big city. Once I was there, I could figure out what I wanted to do with my life.

Exhausting though it was, life was tolerable - sometimes even pleasant. Mrs Payne was a sweet woman, if generally oblivious to the world around her. A seventy-hour work week kept Mr Payne in the city most nights, but when he returned at the weekend, he took a keen interest in the minutiae of the household. He was a man who liked things just so. During my first few weeks, he drove me nearly out of my mind complaining that a chair hadn't been moved exactly back into place after hoovering, or that cutlery hadn't been evenly spaced on the dining table. Once I had committed his rules to memory, he wasn't so bad; you just had to be able to meet his standards.

My favourite member of the Payne household - though not a Payne herself - was Elena. Her family name was old in our village. Not in the same way as the impoverished aristocrats the Paynes so favoured, but her surname was inscribed on every war memorial and appeared in the very earliest parish records.

She was a rare example of someone who had left the village and then returned. In her youth, she had gone to train at culinary school. She had worked in the finest restaurants in the country, even some overseas. Decades on, when Mr Payne approached her with an astronomical offer, she came home.

"I don't get it," I once said to her. "Giving up travelling the world and cooking for celebrities just to come back here."

"I'm tired, Ruthie," she said. "If I'd have stayed in those kitchens much longer, it would have done me in. Besides," she dropped me a wink, "there's a magic in this place not quite like anywhere else."

I didn't understand her. Not then.

As incomprehensible as I found her decision, I was grateful for it. She always had a spare treat for me, and each night I took my dinner with her in the kitchen. My mother was an excellent cook, but somehow Elena's food tasted more like home than anything I'd ever eaten.

Those meals were the highlight of my evening for more than just the food. Elena was wickedly funny and swore like a docker. I'm sure Mr Payne would have heard her in the dining room, but she was the only person he didn't dare criticise.

If life had continued in that fashion, I'm sure I would have stuck to my plan. I would have squirrelled away my money for five years or so then, as much as it would have pained me to leave Elena, left to find whatever destiny awaited me in the city.

But Charles returned from university.

The Paynes' only child was breathtakingly handsome. I had no doubt he had his pick of women - or, at least, those who were able to ignore his eyes. They reminded me of a shark's. Black and glittering and wholly predatory.

I met him when I served dinner on the night of his return. He was nothing less than perfectly polite, thanking me as I set each course before him, but the way his eyes lingered on me made my skin crawl. I tried to fade into the background, eyes locked on the floor, only moving when it was time to bring out the next dish or one of the Paynes needed their glass refilled.

"Will you be coming to church with us in the morning, darling?" Mrs Payne asked as I uncorked another bottle of wine.

Charles scoffed. "You know I don't believe in all that nonsense. Besides, I have some reading to do."

"As commendable as I find your dedication to academics, you have the whole summer to do that," said Mr Payne. "You'd do better to get out into the grounds; you're looking a bit peaky."

"You might be right." Although I was turned away from Charles, I could feel his eyes raking over my back. "Perhaps I can show Ruth around."

I jumped so hard I sloshed red wine onto Mrs Payne's expensive cream skirt. I blushed and stammered apologies throughout the ensuing chaos, but it provided enough of a distraction that I was able to slip away without giving a response to Charles.

That night, for the first time, I locked my bedroom door.

At breakfast the next morning, he showed none of his earlier interest in me. Nose buried in a book, he paid little attention to anyone at all, acknowledging his parents’ comments only with an occasional grunt. Still, after the older Paynes had departed for church, I put off cleaning the dining room for as long as I could. It was only the thought of Mr Payne’s reaction should he return and find the breakfast plates still on the table that propelled me into action.

I checked all up and down the long corridor. Cracked the dining room door, peered into every corner. It was all quite empty. Whatever Charles had decided to do in lieu of church that morning had taken him far away from there.

Yet, as I bustled around the table stacking the dirtied crockery and cutlery, I was seized by that heavy, prickling sensation of being watched.  After I placed the last plate on the pile, I could no longer resist the urge to peep over my shoulder.

Charles stood mere inches away, watching with a placid smile.

The logical part of my mind said I had just missed him in the corridor, and I hadn’t heard the door open when he entered the room. But I couldn’t shake the image of him squatting behind the furniture – or, worse, somehow clinging to the corner of the ceiling – watching me with those glittering eyes.

“Running late today, Ruthie?”

A surge of annoyance. Only Elena and my mother were permitted to call me Ruthie.

“I suppose you can afford to be a little lazy while my parents are gone.” He sauntered over to the table, wrinkling his nose at the breadcrumbs and flecks of orange juice on the linen. “Or perhaps you’ve been avoiding me.”

“It’s been a busy morning, sir.” The words came automatically, my voice flat. I was grateful that this was, at least in part, the truth; the same part of me that urged me to lock my door last night now told me not to lie.

He hummed noncommittally, his eyes still roaming the table. They fixed upon the stack of plates and the leftover food I had scraped onto the very top one. “If you’ve been so busy, you mustn’t have had the chance to have breakfast.” He plucked a slice of black pudding off the plate, already nibbled and slicked with tomato juice, and thrust it towards me. “Here. Eat.”

Instinctively, I stepped backwards. He followed me, holding the half-eaten thing under my nose. “I’m not hungry, thank you.” 

It was the truth again; my stomach had been so knotted all morning that food had been the furthest thing from my mind. He discarded it anyway. “Don’t be ridiculous, I can practically hear your stomach rumbling. Eat.”

His face taut with anticipation, he nudged the black pudding against my lips. My palms itched to slap his hand away, job be damned. But that whispering voice of instinct, which had never had cause to speak to me before I laid eyes on Charles Payne, warned me that the consequences would be more severe than unemployment.

This was a win-win for him. If I conceded to his demand, it would fulfil whatever warped desire fuelled him. If I refused, it would give him an excuse. For what? I had no intention of finding out.

I made to take it from him but he tutted, swatting me away with his free hand. Instead I had to eat the thing from his fingers.

I hated black pudding. I was never able to forget what it was made of long enough to enjoy it. My stomach tried to revolt before I even swallowed the first bite, but I managed to choke it down. I tried not to look at Charles, but time and again my eyes were drawn back to his, and the burning excitement I saw there made me feel sicker than the food.

As I forced down the last bite, I heard the sound of an engine. Charles’s face contorted with the fury of a child denied his favourite toy, and I flinched away. When I looked up again, he had moved to the window, now the picture of that boredom peculiar to the wealthy.

“Better hurry up, Ruthie,” he said, staring down at his parents’ car winding up the drive. “Father will be furious if he sees this mess.”

Seizing the stack of dirty plates, I all but ran from the dining room. By the time I reached the kitchen, there was no more fighting my stomach. I made it to the sink just in time for the first heave, and remained hanging over it for the best part of ten minutes, tears streaming down my cheeks, silently apologising to Elena for splattering the pristine ceramic with vomit.

I almost shrieked when a hand fell on my shoulder, but it was only Elena. Instead of scolding me for the mess, she took a tea towel from the counter and wiped the tears from my face. “My poor love,” she murmured. “You look like death.”

“I don’t feel too well,” I said weakly, leaning against the sink for support.

“I can see that much for myself.” She glanced sideways at the contents of the sink before sliding an arm around my shoulder and steering me towards the door. “Get yourself to bed. You’re no good to anyone like this.”

“The breakfast things - ”

“Leave that to me. If Mr Payne has any complaints, he can live on bread and water for the next week.”

She saw me as far as the stairs and then bustled off to the dining room, her face set as if she was going to war. Sides aching and a headache blooming behind my eyes, it seemed to take an age to reach the bathroom to rinse my mouth and face, and then stagger on to my bedroom. I had just succeeded in swapping my now stained uniform for clean pyjamas when the door opened to admit Elena bearing a tray.

After setting it down on the bedside table, she peeled back the covers and helped me into bed. “I want every bit of that gone,” she said, pointing at the tray. It held a piece of dry toast and a mug of steaming tea. “It doesn’t look like much, but it’ll help settle you.”  

I didn’t think my stomach would be able to cope, but not wanting to disappoint her, I nibbled at the toast. As usual, she was right. The more I ate, the more my nausea eased. What’s more, the fear that had seized me the moment I saw Charles began to ease its grip.

Elena stood over me as I slowly devoured my meagre meal. A few times, she opened her mouth, as if on the verge of asking a question. But when I looked at her quizzically, she only shook her head and urged me to eat up.

With the tea drained and the toast reduced to crumbs, I laid my head on the pillow. Sleep had seemed impossible, but I suddenly found myself bone-weary – and a *good* sort of weary. Not the type that floors you after fear-induced adrenaline wears off, but the sort you earn from a long day of good work, which promises deep, dreamless slumber as a reward for your labours.

I closed my eyes and knew I would be gone within seconds. Teetering on the brink of sleep, I heard Elena whisper, “Steer clear of Charles. The old cook told me some things, and – well, best just to steer clear, Ruthie.”

I wasn’t certain whether she really spoke or I dreamed it. When I returned to the kitchen the next morning, after sleeping a full eighteen hours, she gave no indication of having issued any warnings. Instead, she gave me a brisk examination, announced herself pleased at the colour in my cheeks, then rustled up a far more substantial breakfast than the one she had served me the previous day.

An hour later, serving in the dining room, Charles had returned to ignoring me. That did nothing to prevent the tremor in my hands as I placed his plate in front of him.

“Are you feeling better today, Ruth?” asked Mrs Payne. “Elena told us you were under the weather.”

I expected Charles to smirk at me, or make a remark hinting at what had passed between us in that very room, but he remained engrossed in another thick tome. He didn’t so much as glance at me all throughout breakfast.

In fact, feigning ignorance of my existence became his new routine. In front of his parents, at least. At the table, he might as well have been served by a ghost. But my duties extended beyond the dining room.

Every day, I bided my time. Dusting or hoovering, I would find excuses to linger by the windows, waiting until I saw Charles stride off into the grounds or hop into his father’s Mercedes. Then I would race to his room, determined to make his bed and collect his dirty clothes from the floor before he returned.

Most of the time, I succeeded. But there were occasions – even when I was *certain* I had seen him leave the house – when I found him waiting for me, smile gleaming and eyes glittering.

He didn’t touch me again – not when I cleaned his room – but he found ways to make me uncomfortable. Sometimes, he would follow behind me as I went about my work, lingering so close I was certain I could feel his breath on the back of my neck. Other times, he lounged in his bed, clearly naked beneath a thin sheet. On a couple of occasions, he asked me to pass him an open book from his desk. They were written in a language I neither understood nor recognised, but the etchings – I can’t bring myself to talk about them. I still see those twisted, agonised faces in my nightmares.

Even in his absence, he felt present. Thick stenches permeated the room. Often, it was the reek of stagnant water or decaying leaves. More rarely, it was blood.

As bad as that was, the nights were worse. While locking my door had become a habit, I could do nothing to block out the whispers that seeped through the keyhole. Most of it was unintelligible, but I could pick out my name – always Ruthie, never Ruth. In the morning light, I could almost convince myself I had dreamed it. Lying in my bed – repulsed by the very sight of the door, too frightened to look away – I knew Charles stood mere feet away, grinning at the thought of my discomfort.

Once, I woke in the night with my bladder full to bursting. I put it off until my whole abdomen seemed to throb, but eventually I had to go to the bathroom. Before opening the door, I peeped through the keyhole – although I was certain I would see Charles’s eye staring back at me, the corridor seemed to be empty.

I neglected to check the floor. The moment I stepped outside, searing pain jolted through my foot. I looked down and saw a handful of broken glass. After wrapping my bloody foot in an old shirt, I hobbled to the bathroom to clean the wound. When I returned, there was no sign of either the glass or the drops of blood I had left in my wake.

I couldn’t shake the image of Charles curled up in his bed, licking my blood off the jagged shards.  

After that, I made sure not to drink so much as a sip of water in the evening so I wouldn’t be forced to leave my room.

By this point, I know what you’re thinking: why didn’t I leave?

I tried.

I *tried.*

Rucksack on my shoulder, I would make it as far as the gates, and then – well, it all got a bit foggy. I would forget why I had left the house, and seeing no reason to remain in the garden, return to my work. Back indoors, my memory would flood back, but if I made another run for the gate, I was seized by that same haziness. On my last couple of attempts, the sudden eclipse of my senses was so complete that I had no memory of the journey back to the house. One moment I stood at the gates; the next I was dusting in the parlour.

Those gaps in my memory terrified me so much that I abandoned any attempt at escape. 

Call someone? This was in the days before everyone had a mobile phone, and the house’s sole telephone resided near the entrance. Between Mr Payne examining the bill for the slightest excess in expense and doing my level best to avoid Charles, my opportunities to use it were few and far between. When I managed to muster the courage to call my parents, I heard only static on the line – even though Elena had reported no issues when she called the local grocer earlier that afternoon.

Tell the Paynes? I never considered the idea. How many times had I served at the dinner table, listening to Charles recount a run in with a lecturer over a bad grade, or a fistfight he had provoked with another student? No matter how grievous his offence, his parents always found a way to discharge him of any blame. I had no doubt that they would take his side over mine, and maintaining their ignorance of his behaviour seemed to be the only thing holding Charles in check – I dreaded to think what he would do should they give their tacit approval.

Of course, there was Elena. Not wanting to burden her – what could she do that I hadn’t already tried? – I didn’t confide any of my fears. But she saw me grow thinner and paler despite her hearty meals and the blazing sun. Increasingly as the summer wore on, I caught her studying me, her face drawn and contemplative.

My only hope was to make it to September, when Charles would return to university for the autumn term. Perhaps when he left, whatever spell he had cast over the house would vanish, and I would be able to flee. Although my savings were meagre, I only needed enough to buy a coach ticket. Under the Paynes’ roof, my dreams of life in the big city had collapsed; all I wanted was to put as much space between myself and that wretched family as possible.

Somehow, I made it. The leaves were finally beginning to turn, and Charles was due to leave the following day. The tension I had carried with me for weeks at last began to ease.

Perhaps that’s what made me careless.

I had developed a habit of checking every corner of a room before I entered it, but that evening, all three Paynes had gone into the city for a farewell dinner at a fancy restaurant. Perhaps it was because he was in the company of his parents, but I disregarded all the times I had seen Charles leave the house only to appear in front of me moments later. After all, how could be execute such a stunt from miles away, when he was meant to be eating hors d'oeuvres with mother and father?

For a moment – a *second* – I let my guard down. I breezed into my bedroom as if I hadn’t spent the last two months living in fear.

That was all it took.

Hands seized my shoulders and spun me around. I looked up into Charles’s face. He was there and yet not, like looking at a photograph that had come out blurry. But the force of his grip was very real.

He shoved me against the nearest wall, one hand clamped over my mouth, the other darting out to wrap around my wrist. His fingernails dug into the tender skin there, clouding my eyes with tears. The place where he pierced my flesh burned with a fierce iciness.

Even thirty years later, I still have those silvery crescent scars. They flare with pain every time I allow my thoughts to dwell on Charles for too long. I’m sure you can imagine how uncomfortable it has been to tell this story.

I tried to hit him with my free hand but my blows bounced off him. Wedging the heel of his hand between my teeth, I bit down with all the force I could muster. His flesh gave way beneath my teeth, but what spouted from his wound wasn’t blood. It tasted of decay; of your first grief; of nightmares so terrifying you wake in a pool of your own sweat and urine.

I fought in earnest now, with a strength I never knew I possessed. I knew if I had to keep swallowing that vile stuff, my mind would snap beyond repairing.

When he took his hand from my mouth, I could have cried with relief. But it was not mercy. He wrapped his hands around my throat and began to squeeze.

I knew I would die there, looking up at the wild joy in his blurred eyes. Although my heels thrashed against the wall as he lifted me off the ground, and I pounded the top of his head with my fists, I found a measure of acceptance in that fact. At least this ghastly ordeal would come to an end. Finally, I would be free of fear.

Just as my vision began to dim, his hands yanked back. I crashed to the ground, smacking my head off the wall hard enough to tilt the world on its side. Through this new view, I saw Elena, rolling pin held high above her head.

Charles growled and slunk away, but it wasn’t the rolling pin he feared. In her other, outstretched hand, she held a glimmering heap of green powder. He watched it as though it was a snake baring its fangs.

Elena took several swift steps towards him and blew the powder in his face. He shrieked, hands flying up to protect his eyes, and stumbled from the room. She followed after him, still brandishing the rolling pin like a club.  

When she returned, moments later, she trembled all over as she helped me up off the floor. “It’s okay, my love,” she murmured, though she could not control the tremor in her voice. “He’s gone now.”

For the second time, she put me to bed. No toast this time, but she did bring a tea that helped soothe the throbbing in my throat. While I drank it, she locked the door and slid onto the bed next to me.

I had questions for her: how had she known I was in danger? What was the powder that had banished Charles? Even if I had been able to summon the energy to ask, I doubted I would have been able to force so much as a whisper from my swollen throat.

Instead I allowed her to stroke my hair, trying to silently argue against her mumbled regrets.

“I should have known something like this was happening.”

I gripped her hand, urging her to read the thought in my face: *You saved my life.*

She shook her head, mouth turned down in misery. “I should have stopped it getting this far.”

Several hours later, we heard the Paynes return from the city. They gave no indication that anything was amiss; we only heard them laughing and bidding each other goodnight.

There were no whispers at my door that evening, but neither of us was able to rest. We remained sleepless, hand-in-hand, until dawn.

Three things happened the next day.

Charles returned to university. Elena was dismissed from her position. And they found the girl’s body in a field outside the village.

But that’s all I have in me for now. I need to let this story lie for a while, if only to ease the miserable throbbing in my scars.

More importantly, my coach is due to arrive any minute, and I daren’t run the risk of missing it tapping away on my phone.

It might be decades later than I originally envisioned, but it’s finally time to leave.
