Hello, My name is Connor, and I used to be an avid outdoorsman. One of my favorite places to go was in northern Wisconsin, known as Kaida’s Grove, a sprawling mass of trees and streams, a beautiful place with scenery that rivals Devil’s Lake. However, my Trip to Kaida’s Grove was the last true adventure I had taken into the woods, and now I’m afraid to even get near them. 

When I was young, my father was also an avid outdoorsman; we used to hike together and camp in the woods. My Father told me stories of Kaida’s Grove, a small lot of thick forest surrounding the old logging town of Swallow’s Call, and how he used to rule that place in his teens. But when I was older, He told me stories of the “Man in the Blue Suit” and “The Dream Catcher,” plus the many people who disappeared there when I was younger.

I always assumed it was a tactic to keep me out of those woods he loved to frequent, But that was almost fifteen years ago, and it has been six years since I was last there or even stepped foot in the woods, and I am finally ready to tell my story of my experience in Kaida’s Grove.

It was a lukewarm September weekend. The gray clouds loomed as I drove back from the neighboring town back home. I had just gotten off my shift working at the local plumbing supply company the next town over. It was a fifty-minute drive home, and I was exhausted, as the last rush to replace water heaters, well pumps, etc., before fall arrived was always taxing. I was driving my old Cadillac, which was crude, rusty, and reliable.

My Father was out of town for the week on a business trip to New York, so I decided to stop at Kaida’s Grove to relax, blow off some steam, and explore the place for the first time; the Allure of being so close to the place I assumed my father loved so much got the better of me, so I pulled down the thin two-lane road that wound through a thick grove of trees.

I pulled into a primarily desolate parking lot. A couple of ranger vehicles sat parked in the corner. An older truck had a big For Sale By Owner side taped to the inside of the windshield. I breathed the crisp fall air; I felt a tinge of uncertainty. The memories of my dad’s stories flashed through my head as I walked around my car to the trunk. I popped it open, grabbing my go-bag from my trunk, a smaller hiking bag that contained everything I needed for a spontaneous hike.

I threw the bag onto my back and walked towards the entrance of the Grove. I walked past an empty check-in booth as I listened to the sounds of nature, the birds chirping happily in the sea of lush green pine trees. I stood at the gate, looking at the healthy pine trees, a slight mist occupying the distance. I saw two paths, one heading straight and downhill and another, bigger one, that shot off towards the right. I saw something moving through the trees when an older couple appeared a few seconds later, cheerfully murmuring as they walked down the trail.

I passed through the entrance, following the trail that led downhill. Rocks shifted under me as I came to two jagged rocks shaped almost like a gate that loomed imposingly about twenty feet in front of me. I passed underneath it as the trail narrowed. As it started uphill again, rocks littered the pathway as I ventured deeper into the forest.

I calmly listened to the wind whipping through the trees and the calls of birds as little droplets of rain began to fall. I continued as the raindroplets were light. After around twenty minutes of walking, I came to an old building, the wood rotting slowly as the building appeared to be eroding into the dirt. It was no doubt part of Swallows Grove. I thought as I studied the structure, its old wood crumbling from years of decay.

I took out my old Polaroid camera, snapping pictures of the building until I was content with the amount. I continued on the trail for a few minutes when I heard a new noise like a low gurgle. I froze and ducked. Looking around, I saw something looking at me from the woodline. I swung my head around again as I had gone too far, but turning back, I saw nothing.

“The Hell?” I murmured to myself as I set off again. After around five minutes of walking, listening to the plenteous calls of birds and the soft swishing of the wind,  I came to a small stream. I quickly walked over to it, and as I did, I felt like I entered another dimension.

I could see an old footbridge to my right crumbled into the stream, and stone foundations of houses littered the pathway. As It split off into two sides, I took a left turn, walking down what appeared to be the ghost town's main street. An old blacksmith was to my immediate right, and then a couple more buildings lined the right side as I moved towards a distant Plaque placed on a pedestal.

As I neared, the outline of the house was prominent as the text read The Comble’s Homestead. I reached the podium, looking at the foundation of the wrecked house. I tuned into the forest, and the eerie silence that had filled the air sent shivers down my back like never before. That’s when I felt something watching me, a dark presence on my left shoulder; suddenly, a sense of dread filled my gut as I looked around to the right, not seeing anything. Turning to the left, I saw a gaunt-looking man in a blue suit glaring at me. His gray eyes almost matched his scruffy beard, the same color as the mist; his suit was ragged, and the white undershirt coated in blood. As he strode towards me, it was as if he made no noise until he stood about five feet from me.

“Hello?” I asked the man, feeling uncertain at his sudden appearance.

“Greetings, may I ask your name,” He spoke in an unfamiliar accent, sounding like it was Irish, but something was not right about it.

“My name is Gerald,” I lied, using an old middle school nickname as I faced him. He stood a couple of inches shorter than me, looking to be about a hundred to a buck twenty-five.

“Alright then, Gerald, what brings you to Swallows Call?” He spoke.

“The Adventure, mostly, I am an outdoorsman,” I responded, a note of fear resonating in my voice.

“You sound just like your father, Connor,” The man said, pulling one hand out of his pocket, revealing an old photograph, faded and torn. I looked at it; it was a picture I had lost of me and my dad at Devil’s Lake when I was six. My heart sank, and I started to panic. The story my dad told me, that I had blown off as some scheme to scare me into staying away from Kaida’s Grove, was real, and I was staring at it.

“What do you want?” I asked, slightly trembling as I reached into my pocket for my knife. But another glance locked me firmly in place with horror.

“I want to make a deal: You can join me, and I’ll take you to the place where you can hike forever,” He said as he swept his right arm open. I followed with my eyes until I saw plenty of people stuck in a trance, their eyes glazed over. Some looked like they had been there for ages, their clothes tattered and torn. Some even had vines growing on their skin.

I looked up slightly to see a large creature covered in shaggy white fur walking between them. The man looked over with satisfaction and obedience at the beast. As it turned to face me, the man took his eyes off me, and I felt all my senses return as I locked eyes with this wretched creature. Realizing I was not in a good situation, I booked it into the woods. After a few seconds, I could hear him shouting something unintelligible as I ran into the thicket.

The bramble felt like they clawed at me, trying to keep me trapped as I hustled, breathing heavily and steadily as I ran through the forest. I jumped the stream and ran through the woods, stumbling as branches sticking out of the leaves. I could still hear something behind me thumping into the ground with a furious intensity. After an eternity of running, I emerged by the rock gates, my clothes shredded and plenty of fresh cuts on my skin.

Taking a second to breathe, I heard the footsteps dissipate into the woods; as I caught my breath, I walked through the rock gates, then the main entrance to the park, through them into a sea of emergency vehicles, reading County Sheriff and Search and Rescue, I took a breath when someone in the gaggle of people noticed me, and they started rushing towards me, as I felt woozy, the adrenaline wearing off, as I slumped to the ground.

I awoke later that night. I saw my dad sitting in the chair next to my bed. I groggily stared at him, and once he noticed I was awake, he stood up and gave me the biggest hug he could.

“You were gone for five days, Connor. Where were you?” He asked, knowing the answer to that question as soon as he asked it.

“I saw The Man in The Blue Suit,” I said. My Dad quietly nodded as tears welled into his eyes.

“I told you to stay out of those woods,” He spoke, holding my hand as he shed a tear.

“I should have believed you from the start,” I muttered as a nurse came in, and my dad excused himself. A couple of days later, I was released. When I got home, we developed those photos, and in that dark room, I made a discovery: In one of the pictures stood a tall, gaunt man in a blue suit. I showed it to my Dad, who we agreed that is The Man in The Blue Suit.

Later that night, My Dad and I pulled down that long road, armed with a couple of Molotov Cocktails and a five-gallon can of gas, and we torched that grove; we sat for minutes watching the trees crack and crumble, but as we drove away, I swore I saw a man silhouetted against the inferno, white beads shining from his shadow. Still, I brushed it off as my imagination as we pulled onto the highway.
