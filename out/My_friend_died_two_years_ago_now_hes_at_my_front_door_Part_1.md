**My jaw rests open as I stare at him in my doorway, smiling as if nothing happened. I drop the beer can and stumble forward, embracing Jacob as my eyes still stare out toward the horizon, glossed over.** 

**His arms wrap around me without hesitation—warm, solid, real. I feel the pressure of his hands between my shoulder blades, hear the low, familiar laugh against my ear. It’s him. It’s really him.**

**I pull back, slowly. My hands press against his chest, as if they’re checking for seams or stitches. His eyes meet mine, bright as ever, but a little too wide.**

**“Dude,” he says, grinning. “You gonna invite me in or just keep huggin’ me?”**

**I try to laugh, but it comes out as a wheeze.**

**“I.. how-how are you..” My brain scrambles. I saw his body, hell, we held a funeral for the guy.** 

**“Well if you’d let me in already,” he says, stepping past me like it’s his own place. “Then maybe I can tell ya.”** 

**I shut the door behind him before the cold evening air can follow. My fingers tremble on the handle. My heart races as my vision tries focusing, not to relive that night like I have been.**

**He walks slowly down the hall like muscle memory’s guiding him, grabbing a soda from the fridge like no time’s passed. He even sits in the same spot on the couch where he used to fall asleep during movie nights.**

**And for a moment, I wonder—maybe I** ***want*** **this to be real. I look at the empty cans all over my living room table.** 

**“You gonna come sit down, buddy?” He asks, taking another sip from his drink.** 

**I pull out my cell phone, trying to calm myself as I open the camera app, taking a quick picture of him. He raises a hand and winces at the flash.** 

**“Yo, what are you doing, dude?”**

**“Just-hold on, man. Alright? Hold the fuck on..”**

**“Sheesh, you gotta chill out, dude..”**

**I hold the camera up, looking at his picture in the gallery for a moment before opening the messaging app. The last message was two days ago. I send out the photo to the group chat and wait as the first name sees it.** 

**Jacob leans forward, picking up an older book off my coffee table. It's got stains across the cover.** 

**“Interpretation of dreams, huh..” he examines the cover with a smirk before opening to the first page, “never thought you'd be interested in this stuff. Makes me wonder what the rest of the guys have been up to.”**

**My phone starts ringing.** 

**I look back to Jacob again, vision blurring as my eyes grow wet.** 

**“Jacob?”**

**“Told ya, it’s me, dude.” He laughs.**

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**The living room is louder now. Alive with voices, music, and the snap of beer cans. Everyone's here.**

**Kylie got here first, slamming the car door before sprinting up the steps. She didn’t say a word to me once she saw him, just forced him into the biggest hug I’ve seen her give.** 

**Noah followed close behind, stumbling to a stop in the doorway with his jaw hanging open.** 

**Liv cried. Quietly, at first, then full-on sobbing as Jacob laughed awkwardly and patted her back.**

**Sam’s hugging Jacob so hard his drink spills down his arm. Marcus hasn’t taken his eyes off Jacob since he walked in the door.**

**“We thought you were dead, man,” Sam says, pulling back, eyes wide. “We** ***saw*** **your body. We had a** ***service.*** **You don’t just.. How the hell are you here? Where the hell have you been for the last two years?”**

**Jacob shrugs, like it’s not a big deal. “I dunno. One second, it was all gone, The next—I’m waking up on the side of the road. Maybe someone up there realized I wasn’t ready?”**

**“That’s not.. We saw your body..” Noah takes a long swig from the beer in his hands.** 

**We were all sitting around the room like it was two years ago. Like he never went missing. Like we didn’t hold each other on the deck of the cabin, cold and shaking, waiting for the search team to come back with a body.** 

**But now he’s here. With the same voice. The same dumb hoodie he always wore. Same chipped tooth from when we went surfing freshman year.**

**We all watch as he struggles to think of an answer, looking around the group.** 

**Kylie coughs into her hand and forces a smile. “Let’s not do this now, alright? He’s back. Somehow. That’s gotta count for something.”**

**Jacob raises his drink. “Exactly. Let’s just... celebrate, yeah?”**

**They all raise their glasses, except Sam. I do too, though my hand is shaking.**

**“Well.. at least you don’t smell as bad.” Marcus chuckles. Everyone else follows suit, Jacob shaking his head as he takes another sip from his soda.** 

**That part was definitely true. Don’t get me wrong, Jacob never really stank, but he was one of those dudes that needed to wear deodorant, y’know? Like, his bo was immediately pungent every day. Now, he doesn’t smell bad at all. Like wet leaves and plastic. It fades when he moves, but catches in the air when he sits still. It’s hard not to notice the distinction.** 

**The night is a blur of laughter and disbelief. Old stories resurface like no time passed.** 

**“Alright,” Jacob says, finishing his soda and places it next to my beer on the table. “Let’s do it.”**

**“Do what?” Marcus asks, wiping his face.**

**He claps his hands together like he’s just pitched the best idea in the world. “The cabin. Let’s go back.”**

**The room falls silent.**

**Kylie’s eyes narrow. “Jacob… we haven’t been back since—”**

**“No. No fucking way, what are-what!?” Sam leaps up.** 

**“Easy, Sam..” I speak up, still caught off guard.** 

**“Fuck you-easy. He fucking died at that cabin and now he wants to go back?! Jacob, no offence man, but what the actual fuck?!”**

**“Exactly,” Jacob interrupts. “That’s why we should go back! One last trip. Come on! We’ve gone to that cabin every year since we were kids.. I don’t want you guys to just see that cabin as a bad memory, let’s fix that!”**

**I glance at Liv. She’s biting her lip. Sam looks between us both.**

**“Oh, you’ve gotta be fucking kidding me..”**

**“Sam, sit the hell down, bro.” Marcus chips in from the table.** 

**“That place is cursed,” Liv whispers.**

**Jacob laughs. “So you** ***do*** **think I came back from the dead.”**

**Nobody corrects him.**

**“Look, I don’t like it, but if that’s what you’d really want..” Kylie says, a deep sigh leaving her as she escapes back into her beer.** 

**“That doesn’t seem healthy, man..” Noah says, patting Sams back as he sits back down beside him, “Don’t you wanna go home?”**

**“I already talked to my folks about it, mom was chill with it.”**

**“Chill? Your mom?” Sam asks, shaking his head.** 

**“Yeah, man, she understood, alright?”**

**“I just don’t get it, bro, why would you possibly wanna go back up there? You literally just got back from.. Well, wherever the hell you were..” Marcus stands, grabbing for another beer from my kitchen counter.**

**“That’s exactly man, dude! Maybe if we go up there, I can remember something!”**

**We all look amongst each other, each waiting for someone to speak some sense into him.** 

**“We’re not kids anymore,” he says, softer this time. “And we’ve all changed. But it’d mean a lot to me if we could just go. Just one last time. Like nothing ever happened.”**

**He’s looking straight at me now. And something in his face… not wrong. Just a beat too still.**

**“Please.”**

**And God help me, I nod.**

**“Great!” Jacob says, smiling wide as he stands up, “let’s get goin’!”**

**“Wait, what,” Lena asks, voice tight. “Now?”**

**“Why not?” Jacob says, “I should have my things still up there.”**

**“Wait, why would your things be up there-”**

**“Jacob, it’s late man, we can’t just go right now.” Kylie says. He sighs.** 

**“Hold the hell up, who said we were even going?!” Sam shouts again**

**Jacob looks around the room, eyes glinting.** 

**I swear they flash—just for a second—*****too bright*** **in the low light.**  
  


**Kylie speaks up again, gently but firmly. “We’ll go tomorrow, okay? If we’re really doing this, let’s at least pack for the trip this time.”**

**“Yeah,” Marcus nods, cracking his last beer open. “I’ve got work crap to finish tonight anyway. Let’s meet at Greys early, say eightish?”**

**“Eight?” Liv groans.**

**“Eight-thirty, then,” Kylie says.**

**Jacob hesitates, then throws up his hands. “Alright, alright—tomorrow it is. Just figured, y’know…waited long enough.”**

**The group starts to break apart—Sam grumbles something under his breath but doesn’t fight it this time. Noah and Marcus start stacking up empties after Marcus jugs the beer,  Liv scrolls through her phone in that frantic way people do when they’re trying to avoid looking at something real.** 

**Everyone’s trying to make sense of what the hell just happened, and none of us are doing a great job.**

**Jacob pats my shoulder and grins. “It’ll be good, man. You’ll see.”**

**I nod weakly, not trusting my voice.**

**Jacob steps toward the door, stretching with a content sigh. “Alright, guess I should get going. I’ve got my bag packed already—left it at the house.”**

**He grabs the handle, then pauses. His tone stays light, offhanded.**

**“Still take that left at Miller’s Creek, yeah? Getting a little turned around here.”**

**“Yeah,” I mutter without thinking. “Just past the station.”**

**He gives a small nod, satisfied. “Right. That’s what I thought.”**

**The door shuts behind him with a quiet click.**

**No one says a word for a moment.** 

**“Wait, did he drive here?” Sam asks. Noah sighs as everyone looks around at each other.** 

**“I’ll give the dumbass a ride, see y’all tomorrow..” He rushes out as we all mumble our goodbyes, closing the door behind him as he puts on his coat.** 

**Everyone starts grabbing their stuff, the mood weirdly weightless, like we’re pretending this isn’t the most impossible night of our lives. Somehow we’ve all agreed: we’re going back to the cabin.**

**“So..” Sam speaks up, “Our friend that we all saw definitely die just came back and now we’re going back where he died?”**

**We all just silently nod.** 

**“Great. Just wanted to make sure I wasn’t** ***losingmyfuckingmind*****,” He mutters the last part under his breath, “See you guys tomorrow, I guess.” He grabs his keys off the table and heads out.** 

**“I can’t believe he’s actually back..” Kylie mumbles, slumping back into the couch beside me. She looks at the soda can on the table, her head tilting as her brow burrows together.** 

**“Me neither..” I say, leaning back and wrapping my arm around her. She leans into me.**

**“I mean..” Liv starts as Marcus sits down on the love seat. “.. I don’t know what to think, actually.”**

**“Same.” Marcus bellows out with a cough, covering his mouth as he does, eyes wide. We all look over to him and he waves us off, “Sorry, heh, just.. I mean what the fuck?” He sighs while leaning back into the seat. “Like.. no, seriously, what the actual fuck?”**

**“Your guess is as good as mine, man..” I reply.**

**“So like.. What the actual fuck?!”** 

**“I know!” I laugh, though it’s weak.**

**“Don’t get me wrong, this is one of the best days of my life, bro.. But what in the actual FUCK!?” He shouts this time, we all chuckle. There really was no other words to describe the feeling. What the fuck.**

  
  
  


**The sky’s still gray when I pull into the lot. Mist clings to the asphalt, thick and low. Kylie’s already there, leaning against her car, thermos in one hand, cigarette in the other. She’s bundled up in her big flannel, hood up, fingers tucked in her sleeves to fight the growing chill of fall.**

**She doesn’t notice me at first. Just stares off down the road.**

**“Morning,” I call from my car as I shut my door.**

**She looks over and gives me a tired smile. “Coffee?” she offers, holding out the thermos.**

**I take it and nod. “Thanks.”**

**She doesn’t ask if I slept. She already knows the answer. And I don’t ask her either.** 

**“You okay, hun?”**

**“Ye-” I spit out some coffee as I try speaking mid gulp, she grabs the thermos from me as I cough a bit, “Yeah, I’m alright, why?”**

**She smiles as she sits the thermos on her hood. “Just been a while, y’know. I-We missed you.”**

**I had a creeping suspicion the talk would come at some point. At least she waited for us to be alone for it.** 

**“Yeah, look, I just.. He died, man. I mean, Jacob fucking died and I..” I look toward the sky as my eyes scramble for some sort of answer. Her hand guides me back down when it touches my shoulder. I meet her eyes.**

**“It’s alright, hun. Just.. y’know, don’t do it again, alright?”**

**“Heh, yeah, alright.” I smile back.** 

**“You can ride with me on the way, get some actual sleep.” She starts fixing my hair, continuing even as I try swatting her hands away.**

**“I don’t need sleep, I’m fine-damnit, how are you so fast?”**

**“I’ve always been faster than you, dummy..” She smiles weakly as she curls a bang on my forehead, one final touch up, “also smarter. You can’t lie to me, babe. I see those dark buns.”**

**“Says the one that didn’t even notice my car, maybe you should sleep. I’ll drive us.”**

**“First, I did notice you, second, there’s no way in hell I'm letting- wait, how did you drive here- John!” She starts playfully smacking my body as I flinch away with every word, “You. can’t.drink.and.drive!”** 

**“Hey! We all got drunk last night, lady!”**

**Liv arrives with Marcus next, climbing out of his car with her hoodie pulled halfway over her face. She waves at us, sheepish, then retreats back into her sleeves. She doesn’t say anything, just drifts toward Kylie, who wraps an arm around her shoulders like a reflex.**

**Sam rolls in blasting music, shuts it off the second he sees us. He doesn’t look too thrilled, but at least he’s here. “No Jacob yet?”**

**No one answers as we all look around, “Is Jacob with us right now?” Marcus asks.**

**“No?” Sam mutters as he gets out.** 

**“Well there you go..” I chuckle lightly.** 

**“Alright, dick..” He makes his way over, “Dude’s been dead for two years and he’s still late to his own damn party.” He chuckles. Kylie wraps him in a quick hug before looking back at a car on the way down the road.** 

**Jacob.** 

**Wait, no, it’s Noah. He pulls in with Jacob’s truck.**

**Noah steps out, eyes puffy like he didn’t sleep either. He slams the door too hard and mutters, “Morning.” as he steps over.** 

**Kylie frowns. “Where’s Jacob?”**

**“Said he wanted to take his own car,” Noah says without looking at her. “Grab a few more things. He’s meeting us there.”**

**His voice sounds hollow.**

**“Hey,” Kylie says, stepping toward him. “You okay?”**

**“Since when does Jacob have two cars?” Marcus asks.**

**Noah hesitates. His jaw twitches. “Yeah. Just tired.”**

**“And why does Jacob have his fucking truck?” Sam whispers next to us.**

**Kylie lets it drop, but I can see it still working behind her eyes.**

**We load the cars in silence.**

**Sam stands off to the side, arms crossed, scanning the street. “This still feels wrong,” he mutters.**

**“Yeah,” Marcus says, hoisting a duffel bag into the trunk. “So did seeing him alive again. Guess we’re just rolling with it at this point.”**

**Marcus meets my eyes when he says it. Like he’s checking to see if I’m actually holding it together. I give him a weak nod and open the passenger side door. My hands are already shaking. Should get the drink out of my bag, but I really don’t wanna hear about it.**

**We take two cars: Kylie and Marcus’. Noah and I ride with Kylie. Liv, Sam, and Marcus pile into the second car.** 

**“I’ll lead!” Marcus shouts as he starts his car up, immediately pulling out of the parking lot. We leave behind him, Noah nestling his back into the back seat as we pass the edge of downtown, flashing red-and-blues catch my eye.**

**Two cruisers sit at the edge of the street. Yellow tape strung up near the alley behind Lenny’s. The place has some killer waffles, it’s the only place ever open past midnight in town.** 

**The cars slow down, instinctively.**

**“Jesus,” Kylie murmurs. “Is that… blood?”**

**Something dark stains the pavement beneath the tape. An officer stands near it, looking pale and kinda pissed.**

**Noah leans forward. “Why are we stopping?”**

**“You don’t see that?” I ask**

**He doesn’t answer, just sits back, “I’d rather not make Jacob wait any more than he has to.”**

**My phone rings before I can retort.**

**“Yaup.” I answer Marcus.** 

**“Can you see anything?”**

**“Who is it?” Kylie asks, now looking at me.** 

**“Marcus. Uh, no, not really. Some blood-”**

**“What does he want?” She whispers.** 

**“Yeah, we saw that. Wonder what’s going on?”**

**“He’s asking if we saw anything-Yeah, I don’t know, man, seems bad enough if they got both cops on it-”**

**“What’s he saying?” She whispers.** 

**“Would you jus-”**

**“Yeah, that’s what I was-hey what the hel-”**

**“Hey, it’s Sam, you don’t think- get the hell off, damnit, you’re driving.” I hear Marcus’s voice muffled in the background, something about it being his phone. There’s sounds of a struggle.** 

**“Just put it on speaker!” Kylie whispers louder.**

**“What, no, just chill the hell out, would ya?”**

**“What?” Sam asks.**

**“No, not you.”**

**“Well what’d you say- hey get the hell-”**

**“What are they saying now?” She whispers.**

**“They’re just fighting over the phone.. Probably.” Noah tells her.** 

**“Let me listen!”** 

**“Kylie-would you stop..” I hold the phone out the window away from here, “Damnit, hey.” I put it back to my ear, leaning out the window fully, “Look, I’m hanging up alright.”**

**“Why are you being so weird!” She shouts, reaching moreso after putting the car in park.**

**“Why are YOU being weird?!”**

**“What? Oh, you’re hanging up?”**

**“Give me the damn phone!” Marcus shouts, finally wrestling it back.** 

**“John, you there?”** 

**“Yeah, go- just, here, damnit, here!” I toss the phone in her lap and she lunges for it, pressing her palm into my face as she puts it to her ear with the other. “What are you-” I start smacking it away.**

**“Sorry, hey, Markie, it’s me. I know, yeah he was being really weird..” She smiles, “Yeah, alright, We’ll see ya there. Alright, bye, babe.”**

**She tosses the phone back into my lap and finally lets my face go. I can feel the red in my cheeks starting to calm down.** 

**“What the hell?!” I shout.** 

**“Oh, hush.” She pulls the lever back into drive and the car begins going again. “Marcus said hi, by the way.”**

**I shake my head, looking back to the yellow tape as we leave it behind.**

**It’s been a couple years since I’ve seen it.** 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**On the highway, we fall into a steady rhythm. Gray sky above trying to reveal the sun, but being stopped by all the thin clouds gathering. Wet trees on either side of the road. Miles stretch on in silence.**

**I check my mirror. Noah’s still leaning back. But he’s digging his eyes into the back of Kylie's head.** 

**“You uh, you tell Jacob we’re on the way?” I ask him, twisting in the seat a bit.**

**“What’s that?”**

**“I said, Did you tell Jacob we were on the way?”**

**“Oh.. he knows, why?”**

**“Huh?”**

**“Why are you asking?”**

**“Oh, I just.. Uh.. I don’t know man, just trying to make conversation to fill the time, y’know?”**

**“..Why?”**

**“Alrighty, that conversation is going nowhere..” I twist back, noticing Kylie's smile, “*****Forgot how much of a buzzkill you can be*****, Hey, how much longer?” I hold my hands together in my lap, the tremors getting worse. I’ll need to stop soon.** 

**“Uh, I don’t know, Hun, probably soonish.” Kylie shrugs her right shoulder, making a goofy face with her mouth as she looks on at the road.  I slump back with a sigh. Staring ahead, barely able to see Marcus’s car. I start bobbing my knee, then reach for the radio.**

**“Might as well get some-” The radio blurs out static, causing me to reach for my ears.**

**“Holy shi-turn it off, turn it off!” Kylie winces, gripping the wheel tighter. I use one hand to scroll the knob all the way down. “What the fuck..”** 

**“Heh, music just isn’t what it used to be huh?” she shakes her head, I know she’s trying really hard not to laugh. “Kinda sounded like that guy you like, what was his-”**

**“D.o.S, are you really saying that sounds like-no, I’m not giving you the satisfaction..” She drives a bit more in silence.** 

**“What? I thought it was pretty good! Why so defensive, sheesh!”** 

**“You were always jealous of my lovers, but this is a new low, John.” She chuckles.**

**“Sheeet.” I chuckle, leaning an elbow against the door and looking at the trees as they pass. Time to imagine the ninja man like the good ol days..**

**After a long while, I glance over as the road curves sharply and the trees part. There it is. The cabin, sitting dark and quiet, framed by bare branches scraping the sky. The windows look like empty eyes watching us come back.**

**Marcus’s car is already sitting in the driveway, alongside an older Sedan. I can’t put where I remember it from together, but it’s definitely familiar. As we pull in, Jacob is standing beside Marcus, nodding at us.** 

**I twist back real quick, Noah’s face is unreadable, but his fingers tap nervously on the door handle.**

**We step out, boots crunching on the gravel driveway, and the wind picks up, carrying a faint scent of damp grass.. Along with something metallic.**

**I swallow hard, trying to steady my breath. I can’t help but shiver against a chill down my spine.** 

**We all walk over to the other group, I can’t help but check on Jacob. But even from this distance, something feels off. His smile is too wide, too still, especially for somebody that was just dead two days ago.**

**“Oh, Jake, hun, did your mom get a new phone?” Kylie asks him.**

**He tilts his head, “Mom?”**

**“Yeah, she hasn’t been answering me, I wanted to talk to her about-well, you.”**

**“Oh, you two get along now, huh? That’s good to see, dude!”**

**“We always got along?” Kylie almost whispers.**

**“I don’t know, though, I’ll ask her to reach out to ya.” She nods, taking that as good enough for now. We all stand as a group, each taking steps onto the porch once more. Jacob extends his arms out wide toward the door.** 

**“Welcome back,” he stretches the words, voice smooth, eyes glinting in the fading light.**

**We all exchange uneasy glances as the sky hastens, the trees seeming to close in around us.**

**We really were back.**

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**The front door creaks as Jacob pushes it open with a theatrical sweep of his hand.**

**“After you,” he grins.**

**Inside, it’s dark. No lights. No fire. Just cold, stale air pressing against us like we’re breaking a seal.**

**Marcus moves first. One bootstep over the threshold, then the other. He stops just past the doorway and exhales.**

**The cabin smells like old wood and dried pine. But underneath that, there’s something else—wet soil? Old leather? A faint, bitter tinge of iron.**

**I step in next.**

**The living room’s exactly as we left it.**

**The battered blue couch in the corner, where Marcus once fell asleep with a bag of chips crunched under him. The coffee table with the warped leg and a faint brown ring stain that never scrubbed out. Kylie's old quilt still draped over the backrest, folded too neatly. Even the same magazines sit fanned out on the end table—same issue numbers, same tears in the cover. I notice Kylie staring at the couch, frozen in place.** 

**There’s no dust.**

**No cobwebs in the corners.**

**To the left, the kitchenette looks untouched. Cabinets shut tight, counters scrubbed clean. The old kettle we used for popcorn still rests on the stove. And beside it, on the wall—our old Polaroid photos. Still there. Still pinned in the exact crooked line we left them in. Each having us grow in age alongside them.** 

**I walk closer. Each photo is clearer than I remember. Like they’ve been reprinted. The corners are too crisp. The tape is fresh, like it was just stuck on yesterday. I grab one photo of all of us on the dock—I swear, Jacob isn’t** ***blinking,*** **but his face is… blurred in place.**

**I step back.**

**The hallway leading to the bedrooms is even darker. The doors seem to be cracked open, but I can’t see much without the daylight from the front door.** 

**“Place looks the same,” Marcus mutters behind me, tapping my shoulder as he walks toward the hall. His voice echoes along the walls, but it sounds deeper.**

**“No dust..” Sam adds, stepping inside slowly.**

**Liv frowns, arms folded tight across her chest as she surveys the room. “Did someone come up here and clean it?” she asks, but no one answers.**

**Jacob strolls forward, casual as ever, heading to the fireplace. He kneels down, stacking a few logs like it’s a normal Friday night.**

**“You’ve already come up here,” Kylie says, watching him. “Haven’t you?”**

**“Yeah.” He shrugs. “I-well, just this morning. Got here extra early to clean the place up for us, y’know?”**

**Click. He strikes a match. The fire sputters and pops to life, casting flickering orange across the room.**

**And for a second, it feels warm again. Familiar. I can feel the chill leave me as Noah closes the door behind him, setting a bag off his shoulder onto the ground.**

**“Make yourselves at home,” Jacob says, standing back and dusting off his hands. That damn smile still stuck to his face like it’s been painted there.**

**We linger in the living room a minute longer, standing around like strangers at our own funeral. Then Marcus claps his hands once, loud and final.**

**“Alright,” he says. “Call your beds. I’m not sleeping on the damn couch.”**

**That breaks it. Sam groans and heads for the hall, Liv following close behind with her duffel bag clutched to her chest. Marcus ruffles her hood as she passes. She still doesn’t say much, but the way she glances toward the old bunk room says enough. That was always her spot.**

**Noah crosses the room and flicks on the hallway lights. He jolts for a moment, almost like he didn’t expect them to work.** 

**The bulbs buzz to life. They’re a little too dim, but enough to cut through the dark. The hallway stretches long, carpet still matted in the same places from years of pacing feet. Dust motes float in the air, catching the light like ash.**

**Marcus takes the room on the right with the broken dresser. He always did. Says it ‘builds character.’ Whatever the hell that means.** 

**Sam disappears into the room across from him without a word.**

**I move to grab my bag back off the ground, but Kylie’s already got it slung over her shoulder.**

**“I got it,” she says, smirking a little. “I’m stronger than you, remember?”**

**“Stronger, huh?”**

**“Always have been, babe.” She bumps me lightly with her hip, then heads toward the hall, calling back, “You still want the loft, or you taking the bunks?”**

**I shake my head, grabbing her three bags and follow close behind her. “Loft’s mine. Good one, by the way.” I snark, my breathing getting a bit ragged.**

**The loft is in the last room on the left. It was the smallest in the cabin, made to be a closet, tucked beneath the angled ceiling, but it’s got a window that faces the lake, a desk just beside it and just enough room for a mattress along with a nightstand. We spent an entire weekend repurposing it when we were younger. Pretty sure the walls are thicker.** 

**Kylie tosses the bag down at the edge of the mattress and turns to face me, brushing her raven shined hair back from her face. The light from the hall throws a soft glow across her grassy eyes and for a second, I feel like I'm Seventeen again.** 

**“I think it still has that smell,” she says, wrinkling her nose. “Like cheap deodorant and body axe.”**

**“Could be worse,” I say, trying to hide my grin. “Could smell like Mark’s gym bag.”**

**She snorts. “Same thing.”**

**I subtly rock back and forth on my feet, not quite ready to leave the moment.**

**“You doing okay?” she asks after a beat, voice quieter now. “I mean it. You’ve been kind of… ghosty lately. And not the cute Casper kind.”**

**I exhale through my nose and lean back against the leaning ceiling “I dunno. Being here’s weird. He’s here, y’know? Like nothing happened. But something definitely did. And I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like, my best friend died two years ago, Kai, two years ago they brought his damn body up here, now he’s back and acting like nothing happened and we’re back here and I haven’t had a drink and-”**

**She stands and rests a hand on my shoulder. “Hey, hey..”**

**“I mean, are we all just gonna ignore the fact he doesn’t look like he’s aged a day? Or how he’s acting like nothing happened? It’s been two years, what the actual fuck are we doing here?”**

**Kylie bites her lip and glances toward the door “We’re not ignoring it. We’re just…We all needed this.”**

**She pauses.**

**“I needed this.”**

**I look at her, really look at her. The worry behind her eyes. The way she’s trying to hold the group together like she always has. And the way she looks at me, like maybe she still sees something in me I’m not sure is there anymore.**

**“Damnit, Kai, I’m..” I say, softly. “Thanks. For the coffee. For being here.”**

**Her gaze lingers on mine, warm and unreadable. “Of course, Hun. I never left..”**

**We both smile a little too long at that, and the silence that follows feels charged.** 

**She shifts slightly, her arm brushing mine as she turns toward the door. “I’m gonna go help Liv unpack. Try not to stay in here for too long, okay?”**

**“Can’t make any promises.”**

**Kylie stops in the doorway, half-smiling over her shoulder. “Good. I like a man that can keep me guessing.”**

**Then she’s gone, her footsteps padding down the hall.** 

**“Yo, Kylie, look at this shit..” I hear Marcus try to whisper as she passes his door. I close the door behind her.** 

**I stand there for a while, heart weirdly full, head still spinning. I glance around the loft-same ceiling stains, same warped wood panels-but somehow it feels smaller now. Or maybe I’m just bigger.** 

**I can’t help but explore the room, placing a hand against the window, looking out toward the dying sun beyond the tree line. I try to open it, but strain. I duck down, noticing the hinges bolted shut. I could’ve sworn we used to leave it open. I’m half tempted just to take the glass out, but it’s way too thick to bother. Smashing a window might not be the best idea right now, anyways.** 

**With a deep sigh, I turn to the desk, yanking the old school chair back and pulling the middle chore open. Ergonomics 101. I grab the book and open the front page with a smile, noting all the lame notes Jacob had written through it. The top of the page has the title crossed out, replaced with ‘Getting bitches 169’. I can’t help but chuckle lightly when I notice all the times he obviously erased the word bitches to spell it right. I toss the book on the desk and look at the walls for a bit.**

**Eventually I sit down on the mattress and crack open my bag. My clammy hands struggling to dig through it quick enough, grasping at the flask deeper inside.** 

**I feel my breath leave as I twist the top off, finally getting the sweet tangy feeling once more. Everything is right again. My mind clears up, the temperature drops in the room, my face stops sweating. Thank god for whatever I put in this thing.** 

**I take a longer swig, cutting myself off midway and closing the metal cap. Can’t lose myself tonight, gotta pace it out. At least until tonight.**

**Outside, I hear laughter. Sam shouting something about who’s cooking. Liv’s soft laugh. And somewhere in it all—Kylie’s voice, smooth and bright.**

**Like always.**

**Stop. Stop that. I uncap the flask and take another swig. Alright.** 

**I take another swig then tighten the cap, scrapping my hand as I keep trying to make it tighter. I really don’t need anymore. Not right now.**

**The fifth sip goes down much lighter.** 

**Now I can put it-**

**The door swings open and slams into the wall with enough force to rattle the frame.**

**“Yo, you coming out or-”**

**Marcus freezes, hand hanging on the top of the door.** 

**We lock eyes.**

**He sees the flask before I can tuck it behind me. His eyes land on it, then on me. That quiet calculation behind them shifts into something harder.**

**I lower it slowly, putting it into the bag and laying it on the ground.** 

**He doesn’t say anything right away. Just closes the door behind him with a soft click.**

**“Unpacking, huh?” he says, voice low.**

**I sigh, trying to keep it light. “It’s just a little-”**

**“Don’t,” he cuts me off, stepping forward. “Give it here.”**

**“It’s empty.” I lie.**

**“Great, makes it a no brainer then.”**

**I sigh.** 

**He scoffs. “Man, you’ve been gone for months. Barely answer any of our texts. Your house is full of fucking beer cans and empty pizza boxes. You show up to the lot this morning smelling like you crashed in a bar bathroom, and now I walk in and see you sneaking a drink like we’re in the back of my moms van?”**

**“It’s not a big deal.” My voice cracks sharper than I meant.**

**Marcus stares at me for what feels like forever.** 

**“I’m not trying to be your mom, alright? That's Kylie's job,” he says, sitting on the arm of the old desk near the window. “But it’s been two years, John. Two. You think none of us were hurt when Jacob died?”**

**I look down at the bag.**

**“I know,” I say. “I just… I don’t know what to do, man.. i've been seeing the guy in my dreams every fuckin night. I can't even wake up without having a damn panic attack. It was the only way I could.. I didnt wanna be around you guys when I'm like this. Like him.”**

**He leans forward, “Hey. You are not him. Hell, you think I’m fine? I still remember that call every night.. The way Sammy was pacing back and forth in the kitchen. I still see Liz’s eyes when they were loading up his body.”**

**Marcus reaches out and takes it from my hand. I didn't even realize I pulled the damn thing back out.** 

**He walks over to the larger window, trying to open it. He looks at me after noticing the bolts.** 

**“Yeah, I don’t know..”** 

**He puts the flask in his pocket.  “Come on,” he says. “Dinner’s happening. Kylie’s making that pasta mess she likes and Jacob said he’s grilling. Which is already weird, since he always hated grilling.”**

**“I don’t think we even have a grill out here..”**

**“Heh, we don’t. Dude’s fuckin’ weird. But I guess that’s what happens when you die for two years.”**

**He heads for the door, then pauses.**

**“You coming?”**

**I hesitate.**

**But then I nod.**

**“Yeah,” I say, standing slowly. “Yeah, I’m coming.” I dust off my legs, grabbing the bag as I stand fully and tossing it on the bed. I’ll unpack after.** 

**I follow him down the hall, noting all the doors are closed.**

**And my hands grasp together, the flask staying behind for some damn reason.**
