I want to talk about what convinced me beyond any doubt that the supernatural is real. A lot has happened since this night. Now I have more reasons to believe than I can remember. Back then, I had only my understanding of what the world is based on speculation and stories. A tulpa. Fiction witnessed and believed in until it existed always and almost immutably, save for what had yet to be defined. 

Very early on in my life, I witnessed time and again the manifestation of events I had imagined in my head. Children have incredible pattern recognition skills, and I was not different. It’s how we evolved. There was no denying I was vaguely foresighted, like my mother and grandmother before her. Considering I was adopted, I am fairly certain this is a learned ability rather than a genetic one.

By a certain age, seeing how often history repeats itself, how often the same occurrence can coincidentally happen around other instances of itself, I started to dismiss this gift as a mental health concern. That weekend, however, felt different.

I don’t know if it was the place, close to the ocean, the friends close to the time of our final closing argument, or even just the turn of the season we were observing. Likely it was all of them. Whatever the case, that weekend was full of magic; and it wanted to be noticed. 

Every time something strange would happen, the otherwise perfectly clear day would turn to fog. It rolled in so thick you could get lost in it. It stayed long enough for one of us to change in some small, almost imperceptible way. Broken relationships, mended trauma, changes in belief. 

There were three of us remained awake, we turned to playing cards. The discussion of what to play went on and on as my friend continued to shuffle. I feel my eyes glaze over, transfixed by the rhythm of the cards. I can’t see anything of them save for the floral pattern on the back. 

“5 of diamonds”, I find myself saying on a whim. “That’s the card on the bottom of the deck by the time you’re done shuffling.”

He pauses. “Okay…” then flips the deck over. It wasn’t. 

“I said when you’re done shuffling. Were you?” 

He looks perplexed, turns the deck back over and continues shuffling. More minutes crawl by as we finally decide on Rummy. Shuffling stops. The deck is flipped. A feeling of anticipation that had been building all this time releases in an excited yell of victory as the red “5” of my card is displayed. 

“You can do it too,” I say to each of them. “Right now, without looking or hesitating, tell me what comes next.” 

The shuffler was the first to respond, and true to my words, his card shows itself as mine slides away. The next friend, I knew would need time to be convinced. She was a skeptic by nature and always felt the need to be right, even in the face of all evidence to the contrary. True to form, her prediction did not show up. 

“It’s because you didn’t want it to be true. Wouldn’t want to be the only one to get it wrong, would you?”

That lit a fire in her. “Fine! Next one is ace of clubs!” Said with such determination, it left no doubt in anyone in the room. We all wanted it to work and cheered in unison as the card showed itself. She stammered, trying to explain it. 

The fog cleared, we stayed silent for longer than you might expect for three people who had just affected the physical world through our belief.
