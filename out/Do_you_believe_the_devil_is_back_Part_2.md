[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jiu3f0/do_you_believe_the_devil_is_back/)

We never got our answers on what actually occurred during those eventful days. Finn had dropped out of college and didn't come back but his father visited a week later to gather his remaining things. He was very standoffish and only explained to us that his son needed time to take care of his mental health and that he'd moved back home.

We didn't tell him about how he had drugged us or watched us at night, both agreeing that we wouldn't make this situation harder for his family than it probably already was. 

Before his father left, he gave us an address though. In case, we ever wanted to visit our friend.

And a part of me wanted to, a part of me needed answers, but it was almost as if someone had built a barrier between us. And I just couldn't bring myself to go see him. Neither did Younes, he never said it out loud but I think it scared him too much, just as it did me.

So we pushed it all down and tried to continue with our lives. We got a new roommate, but we were never as close as before. 

Then we graduated and moved to different cities. That was about six years ago. We tried to stay in touch, keeping us updated about our lives at first, but eventually that turned to only texting each other on birthdays. 

Until a few weeks ago, when Younes invited me to his 28th birthday. He lived about three hours away but this seemed like the perfect opportunity to reconnect. He told me that Lana would be there as well. I wasn't in touch with her anymore - she was always more Finn's friend than ours, but apparently the two of them were living near each other now and were hanging out more often.

So on Saturday I packed up my car and drove to a reunion of sorts - although there was a slightly bitter taste to it, knowing Finn wouldn't be there.

\--

I was nervous as hell standing in front of my old friend's door, but after I finally gathered the courage to ring the bell and he opened with a huge grin, it quickly faded away. 

"Noah-Fucking-Ferris, I didn't think I'd see your ugly face again until I lay on my deathbed," he joked and pulled me in for a hug.

"Good to see you too, man. Happy birthday," I laughed. 

"Come on in, my friends are dying to meet you. And Lana's already here too. She's like a crazy smart therapist now, so be careful what you reveal around her." 

I was feeling a little fatigued but his friends were great and I ended up having a really good time. I chatted with Lana for a while about school and the old days. She'd changed a little in appearance - her short brown hair now reaching all the way to her back but she’d stayed just as nice and funny.

After the other guests left, the three of us took to the balcony and the mood suddenly became a bit more tense, although I wasn't sure why.

"I wanted to say something earlier but figured it was better if we had some quiet," Younes started. "I talked to Finn today."

I swallowed. 

Finn's name and the serious tone of his voice sent an unexpected shiver down my spine that had nothing to do with the cold air. He must have noticed my unease, because he chuckled nervously. "I know. I was just as surprised. I got a call from an unknown number and  almost dropped my phone when I heard his voice."

In all those years, he had never called me. There were so many questions on my mind but I settled on "what did he say?"

"Well, just happy birthday at first. He apologized for not reaching out sooner to explain why he left. It was all very casual and nice, but something felt off."

"What do you mean?"

He shrugged.

"I told him that I'd be seeing you today, and that's when he asked if you were feeling unwell again." 

He didn't say much more, maybe because Lana was sitting right there. I stayed silent at first. I had been getting sick again more often - there was even a day where I believed I felt something on my tongue. But my doctor had assured me I was fine.

"That's strange," I muttered.

"Yeah, but that's not all. He asked about Lana too."

She looked at me and I noticed something in her eyes, some kind of understanding.

"And well, at the end, he kinda scared me. He said something I think the two of you should hear as well: 'I tried to keep away but I think it's going to happen again. It's not satisfied with me. I can't leave to help you.'" 

Lana's posture suddenly became rigid, reflecting my shock. 

"Do you know what he meant?" She asked, not looking at either of us.

"Do *you* know?" I asked. Younes gave her a sympathetic smile.

"Something happened to me before he left. I'm not sure if he told you."

I shook my head. 

"I'll tell you, but you have to promise not to look at me any different. Please. I swear I am fine now," she almost whispered.

"Lana, you don't have to-" Younes started, but she shook him off.

"No, it's fine. I think he should know. It was a week or two before Finn dropped out. I was sleepwalking. I don't think it ever happened to me before that, but I can't know that for sure I guess. All I know is that I went to bed and when I woke up, I was on the roof of our student building. Barefoot and in my pyjamas. And Finn was behind me, his arms wrapped around my waist as he pulled me back with force."

Her eyes started glittering.

"Apparently, I was just about to jump off and he held me back at the last second."

"Lana-," I whispered.

"I know how this sounds. To this day, I'm not sure how he knew I was there, but he saved my life."

I felt ashamed to even think about it, but I had to ask. "Do you think he may have brought you up there?"

"I wondered the same things," Younes whispered.

"I don't know, but he told me I should get away for a while. So the next day, I asked my parents to pick me up. And when I came back to school, Finn was gone and nothing like that happened again as far as I know, but after this call.. I swear I never consciously thought about taking my own life, but I still lock myself up in my room before I go to bed each night and hide away the key."

"I do the same thing. But for other reasons," I said in a soft voice. 

She nodded. 

"I told her about the day I was supposed to go on the excursion," he added, silently conveying that he hadn't mentioned what had happened to me. But she had just revealed something horrible, so I decided to share my side of the story as well. 

She took it all in silently. In the end it brought us to the big question I hadn't been able to answer in years.

Had Finn saved us, or was he the root of it all? 

When everything was out in the open, Younes cleared his throat.

"So, there's something I want to do but neither of you have to go along with it-,"

"You wanna visit him?" I finished for him.

He nodded.

\--

The following day, Younes and Lana took turns driving while I sat in the back. We had quite some hours ahead of us and I was grateful to sleep a little, as I wasn't feeling particularly well.

The time passed in a blur where I fell in and out of consciousness. As we got closer to our destination, there were signs all over, leading to towns with strange names I'd never heard of before. 

Finally, the sign of **Odessa** came into view. I tried looking up the town before, but there wasn't much I could find. As we passed the sign, my stomach seemed to do a backflip, bile rising in my throat. I wasn't sure whether it was the tension or all the potholes we were passing.

But as we continued, the streets became smoother again, and my stomach calmed down slightly.

"So, I know we're totally ready for all this, but what if Finn isn't even here? *Or* his family?" I asked.

Lana didn't react. She just kept staring at the trees out of her window. Younes found my eyes in the rearview mirror.

"Honestly? No idea. But in these small towns people usually know everything about each other. We'll figure something out."

For a while, there was no sign of any people. All we passed were trees and fields, but finally the first houses came into view.

"This looks like the kind of place people come to die," Lana muttered.

"What do you mean?" 

"It's so serene. All the houses look perfectly groomed, the architecture of them all so similar. Like there was one blueprint, and they just went with it. All the lawns are perfectly cut to the same length. And look at the people. It almost seems like they're acting out how to play human."

Younes slowed down slightly and I took in the surroundings in more detail. Birds were chirping, children playing on the streets, neighbors waving at each other. It looked like a catalogue for a perfect town. 

"Can you imagine a little Finn growing up here? Drawing with chalk on cobblestone or playing hopscotch?" Younes laughed.

I really couldn't. This place seemed to be the exact opposite of his personality. 

We reached the address and parked out front. It was a cute little house that was just like all the other ones here. A light shade of yellow, a bright green lawn and a mailbox that was a miniature version of the house. 

"Ready?" I asked as I unbuckled my seatbelt. The others nodded and at once we opened our doors and stepped outside.

The first thing I noticed was the scent. The air here was different - you could almost taste it on your tongue. And it tasted bitter. Bitter and somehow familiar. I took in my surroundings once more, my eyes falling back to the house. Smoke was coming out of a chimney on the roof, even though it was a warm day. 

As my eyes lowered, I noticed someone was watching us. From the window on the second floor, a woman had her forehead pressed to the glass. When our eyes locked, she came even closer, her mouth forming into a bright grin.

I glanced away, only to realize that the window next to her was the same. Only there it was a man watching and grinning.

"What the hell, do you guys see that?" I whispered but Younes and Lana weren't near the car anymore. While I was distracted, they had already walked up to the front door. 

I dared a glance back up, but the faces were gone, so I tried to shrug it off and quickly ran after my friends. 

"Did you knock already? I think maybe we should regroup first. Something is o-"

Before I could finish my sentence, the door opened, and a middle-aged man and woman greeted us with bright smiles. The faces I'd just seen stuck to the door. 

One of them was Finn's father. He didn't look a day older than the last time we saw him but something about him was different. When we last saw him, he was in a grey suit, his face was expressionless, and he barely spoke two words. Now, the man almost appeared like a caricature with a twirly red mustache, round glasses and a red and orange striped shirt tucked into his brown pants. The woman appeared just as noticeable in a twirly dress with lemons on it and bright yellow high heels. 

"Well, well, well, isn't this a surprise? I have seen these faces before, haven't I?" He said in a chipper voice that was completely at odds to the last time we saw him.

"Oh well I have not, Francis. You must introduce me to these handsome faces," the woman said. 

"Hello, Mr. Fabel and Mrs. Fabel, I presume?" Younes said in a charming tone and the woman nodded proudly. "We're very sorry to just knock on your door without a warning, but we were in the area and thought we might surprise our old roommate Finn."

"Ohh, you are the ones our boy lived with during his *expedition*," her mouth curved slightly downward when she said that last word.

"Uhm, yes. I'm Younes and this is Noah," he tilted his head toward me and I gave them a stiff smile. "And this is-,"

"Lana, I studied with Finn. And lived in the same building."

"How lovely!" Mr. Fabel called out.

"How very lovely, however you have the wrong address, dears. Our Finn moved away years ago," his wife said. 

A wave of disappointment washed over me. I'd been anxious to see him again, but now that we'd gotten so close I did not want to turn around.

"Oh, honey. Don't look so sad," Mrs. Fabel said to me. "Noah was it, yes? Your old friend is not far. His house is actually only a five-minute walk from here. I can take you there myself."

"That would be great, thank you!" Lana said. 

"Why, of course, it's no trouble. Just leave your car here. You can come back later to gather your belongings."

With that, she pushed past us, but not before giving her husband a look I couldn't decipher. 

\--

Mrs. Fabel kept chit chatting but to my luck, Younes and Lana seemed more than happy to lead the conversation with her while I tried to calm my heartbeat for the reunion that was awaiting me.

Finn's parents hadn't exaggerated, his home was only down the street. And it looked just like the one of his parents', only slightly smaller. We followed his mother to the front and she knocked exactly three times. 

But it wasn't Finn who opened the door. Instead, a woman around our age with long red hair greeted us - wearing a dress fit for a cocktail party. 

"Julie, I brought you some visitors. These are friends of Finn's. From his time away."

Julie's eye twitched slightly, but then she gave us a bright smile.

"How wonderful!"

Younes and I exchanged a confused look. 

"Boys and girl. This is Julie. The *new* Mrs. Fabel." 

"New Mrs.. Finn got married?" Younes asked, not even trying to hide the shock in his voice.

Julie nodded enthusiastically. 

I stood rooted to the ground, unable to react. The conversation continued, but I couldn't listen.

*Finn was married.*

Suddenly, I felt a touch on my arm and snapped back to reality. 

"Are you coming?" Lana whispered. Younes had already taken a step inside and Mrs. Fabel was watching me expectantly. 

When I started to move, she quickly said her goodbyes, and we were alone with Julie in the entryway. 

Everything around me remained muffled until loud footsteps on the staircase made me lock eyes with the friend I hadn't seen in years. Eyes that opened wide at the sight of us. Not with surprise or anger. No, Finn looked scared. For a moment that felt like an eternity, nobody said a word. Julie's eyes kept moving between all of us, the smile never leaving her face. Finn stayed at the bottom of the stairs. When he finally spoke, it wasn't to us. 

"Julie, would you mind going to the store to get some, uhm, cake or something?"

"Oh, yes! What a pleasant idea. I will get some cake for our guests."

She grabbed a purse from behind the door and disappeared swiftly. When the door shut behind her, Finn's face had turned white as snow. 

"What have you done? You were never supposed to come here," he spoke in a strained whisper.

"We- we were worried about you, man. I know it's been a while but after your call to Youn-," I started but Finn barely let me finish before he lunged forward, fists gripping my shirt. 

 "I stayed away to PROTECT you. This is bad. Really bad. It will never let you go. You will *die* [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)."
