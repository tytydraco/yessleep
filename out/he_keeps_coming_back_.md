He keeps coming back. 

 

My name is or rather was Marion Reynolds, my dad was killed on D-Day, storming the beaches of Normandy, he was in the first wave of soldiers, just one of 20,000 soldiers that died that day.  

My dad died not knowing that his new wife was pregnant with me, I was born in Glasgow in January of 1945. 

Mum struggled to bring me up on her own, my playground was the bombsites of the Gorbals, we lived near my nan, so, she would look after me while Mum was at work. 

When I was ten, mum met John Lister, he was a mechanic at the bus garage where mum was a Clippie, a year later, they got married. 

When Mum was working the late shift, that is when it happened, the sly looks, the “accidental” touches, I tried telling Mum, but she just said that I was lying or imagining it. 

Within six months, the touches had turned into full-on groping, when I hit puberty, it progressed to full sex, and this went on for months. 

Then, I started feeling sick in the morning, mum heard me one day and asked me what was wrong. I once again told her about what John was doing to me.  

Mum slapped my face for lying about John, she said, “John is a good man, he wouldn’t do something like that.” 

That night she dragged me off to some dirty, dingy backstreet, to a filthy basement flat, the door opened to Mum’s knock. 

Mum held a whispered conversation with the person who answered, I couldn’t tell if it was male or female. 

We went inside the disgusting, smelly hovel, personally, I wouldn’t have let a dog live in there, under the light of a single light bulb, hanging from a frayed cord, I could see that the person was a woman. 

I couldn’t even guess her age, she had matted grey hair, and warts on her chin complete with grey hairs protruding from them, she looked like a caricature of a storybook witch.  

She had filthy hands with thick nails encrusted with some dark substance, that looked like blood or shit, plus she smelled worse than the tenement block toilets during the summer months. 

I was led to the table in the middle of the room, it was cluttered with junk that she cleared by sweeping it onto the floor with her arm. 

Mum helped her lay me on my back on this rickety table, then Mum held my shoulders down on the table while this old crone pulled my navy-blue school knickers off, and inserted something metallic inside me. 

It hurt so much that I passed out from the pain, when I came around, Mum smiled brightly and said, “All done and dusted.” 

We left there and made our way home; I could barely walk because of the pain and because of the thick pad of material that I had pressed between my legs. 

When we got home, I was feeling faint, but Mum made me apologise to John for accusing him of wrongdoing, and then I was sent to bed. 

I awoke two days later in a hospital bed, my stomach was sore, and mum was sitting beside my bed, holding my hand. 

Mum had come in to check on me before she and John had gone to bed and found me lying in a blood-soaked bed, an ambulance had been called and I was raced to the hospital for emergency life-saving surgery. 

Just then the door opened, and a man walked in, he introduced himself as Dr McKenzie, checked my chart and causally sat on the side of my bed. 

He said, “Now then Marion, what have you been up to.? And at your age too. Was it a boy from school? Or someone from the tenement block.?” 

Mum squeezed my hand hard as if to say, “Don’t say a word.” 

Dr McKenzie shook his head silently at my refusal to speak, then he turned to my mum and said, “Well, whatever butcher tried to sort out her little “problem” nearly killed her,  

whatever they used, perforated her uterus, if you hadn’t checked on her when you did, she would have bled to death before morning. 

But the damage they inflicted was so severe that we had to perform an emergency hysterectomy, which means that Marion will never be able to have children.” 

Mum started crying at the doctor’s words, so I started crying as well. Dr McKenzie left the room as Mum, and I sat hugging each other.  

I was in the hospital for nearly a week, the day before I came home there was an arson attack on a filthy basement flat in a dirty, dingy backstreet,  

Somebody had wedged the only door shut and poured petrol through the letterbox, the only occupant perished in the flat, and there were no suspects. 

When I got home, Mum told me that she had informed the headmistress of the school that I attended, Mary Magdalen, Roman Catholic School for Girls, that I had been in the hospital with a burst appendix. 

This would explain the scar on my stomach, plus it would get me excused from P.E. for the rest of the year. 

Mum had to return to work the next day, due to missing a lot of time while I was in the hospital, so, John was going to be watching me, I inwardly shuddered. 

Two nights later, John said to me, “Now that you can’t get pregnant, we don’t have to be careful do we.?” 

We were in the living room, so I backed away from him, he steadily advanced toward me, so I snatched up the poker that was laid by the coal fire. 

I held it up in front of me and warned him to stay back, he laughed and said, “You haven’t got the guts to do it, go on then, try it.” 

All of a sudden, all my pent-up rage took over and burst out, I screamed in rage, “You bastard, you stole my childhood and now you have stolen my ability to have children in my future.” 

And I brought the metal poker down over his head. He collapsed back and fell breaking a wooden chair as he fell, he tried to pick up a broken chair leg. 

I grabbed it first and brought it down over his head, shoulders, and neck, screaming about how he ruined my life. 

The neighbours called the police, and they turned up, to find me standing over John’s battered body, still hitting it with the chair leg. 

I stood there panting from the effort of hitting John, one of the policemen said, “Come on lass, put the chair leg down, and sit down.” 

I was sitting down on the sofa when two ambulance men arrived, one of them said, “It looks like a blood bath in here, how many are you looking for.?” 

The policeman looked at him, and said, “She did it.” Pointing at me. The ambulance man said, “You’re joking, it’s always the quiet ones isn’t it.?” 

At that point my mum arrived, she flew at me, screaming incoherently, trying to scratch and slap me.  

I was taken down to the police station where I was signed in, searched, and then locked in a tiny cell for the night,  

the cell was cold and smelt of stale piss, the mattress was thin and lumpy, and I only had one itchy ex-army blanket to cover myself.  

The light in the cell was kept on all night, so the only way I could attempt to get any sleep was to cover my head with the blanket, but as it was so thin, it didn’t block out much light. 

At seven thirty am, I was woken up by a big, burly policeman, he unlocked the cell door and brought in a battered metal tray, which had two slices of burnt toast and a cup of cold, grey, watery tea. 

These he placed on the cold concrete floor, then turned and left without saying a word, as hungry as I was, I couldn’t stomach the tea and toast. 

Sometime later, a different policeman came and led me to an interview room, there I sat in a chair that was bolted to the floor, the policeman stood with his back to the door, and we both waited in silence. 

About ten minutes later, the door burst open and two plainclothes officers entered the room, one of them looked at me and said, “Why isn’t she wearing handcuffs, she’s in here for murder. So, get some cuffs on her now.” 

The other plainclothes officer said, “Hold on Robbie, she’s only a wee bairn, I doubt if she weighs more than six stone wearing a soaking wet donkey jacket, I’m pretty sure, that the three of us can cope with her.” 

I sat there, shocked by these two big men, both of them looked like they wrestled gorillas for fun.  

This started my interview, that afternoon, I was taken to the court, and two hours later, I was formally charged with murder and remanded in custody.  

I was taken by police van to a remand centre, where I would spend the next six months awaiting trial, when the other girls found out that I was on remand for murder, I was elevated in their eyes. 

Eventually, I was taken to Glasgow Crown Court for trial, I was sitting on a cushion on a wooden bench in the dock, looking at a sea of faces. 

Then a voice called out, “All rise.” 

The warden next to me said quietly, “Stand up.” 

Then a door that I hadn’t seen opened behind the big desk at the front of the court, a man entered, he was wearing a long black robe and a white wig. 

He walked slowly to the seat behind the desk, and sat down, the court usher said, “Please be seated”. 

The judge picked up and read the sheaf of papers on his desk, quickly read through them, and then looked over the top of his half-moon glasses at me, looked at the usher and nodded. 

The usher stood and said, “Today is the crown versus Marion Alison Reynolds, you are charged that on the night of November 7 1958, you did wilfully and with malice aforethought, you did murder, John Angus Lister. How do you plead, guilty or not guilty.? 

My court-appointed lawyer stood up and said, “My client pleads not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.”   

Then followed a week of legalese, that I didn’t understand, then on the third day, my mum took the stand, the story she told, painted me in the blackest light possible. 

She said that I was jealous of her and John, and that is why I told lies about him, then when I got pregnant by some spotty boy from the tenement block. 

And when that didn’t work, I killed him in a fit of temper. My lawyer argued that the police had scoured the block and couldn’t find anyone who had seen me with a boy of any age. 

But the damage had been done, I could see the way the members of the jury looked at me as if I was a piece of shit on their shoes. 

The jury was sent out to deliberate on a verdict, so, I spent another weekend on remand, on Monday morning, I was driven back to the court, where I sat in the cells below the court. 

After lunch, the jury returned, so I was taken back to the dock, the judge came back in, and he asked the foreman if they had reached a verdict. 

The foreman stood and answered yes. 

The judge said, “Do you find the accused guilty of the crime of murder.”? 

The foreman said, “No.” 

The judge said, “Do you find the accused guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.?” 

The foreman said, “Yes” 

The judge said, “is this the verdict of you all.?” 

The foreman said, “Yes.” 

The judge then asked the foreman to retake his seat. 

The judge then turned his attention to me, and the warden beside me nudged me to get me to stand. 

I stood and looked at the judge. He removed his glasses, and after a few seconds he spoke, he said, “Marion Alison Reynolds, you have been found guilty of the heinous manslaughter of John Angus Lister, for this crime, you will be taken to a secure unit until you are eighteen years old,  

Upon reaching this age, you will be released on licence, which means if you break the law for anything, you will be taken straight to an adult jail, to serve out a normal term for manslaughter. 

If you had been an adult now, I would be donning my black cap and sentencing you to be hung. Wardens, take her down.” 

As I was led down the stairs from the dock, I looked across at the gallery, my mum was sitting there with a look of pure hatred in her eyes, that was the last time I saw my mum. She drank herself to death within two years. 

I was taken back to the holding cell below the court, I was numb. Later I was taken upstairs and out to the courtyard behind the court and was placed in a prison van. 

This was the first time I had left Glasgow, we travelled northeast for about two hours and arrived in Perth, to a large stone-built building that stood on a hill outside of the town, a high stone wall surrounded it. 

We drove through a heavy wooden door and into a large grass-covered courtyard, this was the place where I was going to spend the next five years of my life. 

The prison van pulled up in front of a pair of heavy oak doors that looked like they could withstand a battering ram, and I was led inside a wood-clad entrance hall. 

There waiting were two wardens, one was a short, stockily built, middle-aged woman, with short grey hair and a scowl on her face, and the other was a petite woman in her late twenties, with long blond hair and a wide smile. 

I was taken to see Miss Jackson, the governor, who introduced the two main wardens, and about a dozen other women wardens, whose names just went over my head. 

But, these two women were to become the banes of my life, the older woman was Miss Thorpe, and the younger one was Mrs Turner. 

Within weeks I found out that Mrs Turner was in a relationship with the governor, both were lesbians, while Miss Thorpe was a sadist.  

Both used the remand home as their playground and the girls inside as their toys. The other girls soon filled me in on what went on in the remand home. 

The Top Girl, “Maggie Riley” came over to me and introduced herself to me, she asked me what I was in for, so I told her that I was in for killing my stepdad for raping me and getting me pregnant. 

Maggie asked me how I did it.? 

I just shrugged and said, “I beat him to death with a chair leg. This was after I had come out of the hospital, where I had to have a hysterectomy because of a botched abortion my mum forced me to have. 

He tried to attack me again, so I hit him with a poker, then beat his head in with a chair leg. That’s why I’m here. Ok” 

Maggie let out a low whistle of admiration, she said, “Well done, girl. Most of us just have to put up with it, but you fought back and won.” 

After that introduction, I was given no problems by the other girls from the home, I was given warnings about Miss Thorpe, and she hands out really strict punishments for the slightest misdemeanours. 

Mrs Turner is an aggressive lesbian, she gets very touchy-feely in the showers and changing rooms, don’t let her catch you there alone. 

The first week went reasonably well, but on Saturday, we had PE, after showers, I was the last one in the changing room. 

I walked out of the shower to see Mrs Turner standing leaning against the door, she said, “Come here, Girl, you might think that on the outside you are someone, big and strong. 

But in here, you are nothing, you are in my playground now, and I make the rules, is that understood.?” 

I was so shocked, that I dropped my towel. Mrs Turner smiled and reached forward with both of her hands, pinching, and pulling my nipples, so I had to move towards her. 

The pain from my nipples was excruciating, without thinking, I gave her a Glasgow Kiss, a headbutt to the bridge of her nose. 

Her nose shattered, blood sprayed everywhere, and she dropped to the floor screaming, as she fell, her fingers gripped my nipples, leaving deep, red scratches on them, that immediately started bleeding. 

I sat down in shock, dripping with Mrs Turner’s blood, I could hear footsteps running down the corridor, the door burst open, and three wardens were standing there. 

Two of them started checking over Mrs Thorpe, while the other checked me over, both of us needed to see the Dr, I had deep lacerations to both breasts and nipples and the ointment and dressings the Dr applied stung. 

Mrs Thorpe needed to go to the hospital in Preston for an X-ray and then to get her nose reset. I was put in a solitary cell for two weeks for assaulting an officer. 

Because of the lacerations, Mrs Thorpe had inflicted on me, I was given a lesser punishment, normally, it would have been at least six weeks in solitary. 

When Mrs Thorpe returned to work, she had two black eyes and a very swollen nose, even after the splint was taken off, it was still misshapen.  

Because of her black eyes, she was nicknamed “Panda” She hated this, which only made people use it more. I thought that as soon as she returned to work, she would be after me, but nothing happened. 

But six months later, when my guard was down, she pounced, another girl there was young Annie Prior, she was twelve years old and a bit simple. 

She was here for setting fire to the tenement block next to hers in Edinburgh, where it was so packed with people, that it was considered a miracle that there were only two fatalities, both of which were babies, one was a boy of three months, and the other was a girl of a year. 

Annie was placed here because there was nowhere else to put her, is she was placed in a mental asylum, she would likely have been raped before she had been there a week. 

So, Annie was placed here, in the Preston secure unit for Girls. Everyone here doted on little Annie, she was treated like a little sister, she was mostly dumb, and she communicated in grunts and by pointing. 

One Saturday, Annie was found, badly beaten up, her nose broken, and she was covered in cuts and bruises, the doctor patched her up, but when they asked her who had done it, she pointed to me. 

I was dragged upstairs to the punishment room by Mrs Thorpe and Miss Turner, inside the punishment room was a bare metal bedframe, I was forced to strip, and then I was tied to the bed frame, and gagged with my socks. 

While I was lying there helplessly, Mrs Thorpe stood over me and said, “You thought that I’d forgotten about you, didn’t you.? But revenge is a dish best-served cold.” 

She then punched me hard in the stomach several times, then proceeded to pinch and twist my nipples, and for good measure, she then slapped me hard between my outspread legs.  

As I was gagged, I couldn’t make a sound, Mrs Thorpe then left the room, leaving me at the mercy of Miss Turner, while I was still struggling to breathe after being punched in the stomach, Miss Turner took the opportunity to untie me from the bed and retie me. 

My hands and arms were tied tightly behind my back, my ankles and knees were tied, my head was forced down and a rope was looped around my neck and behind my knees so that if I tried to straighten my legs, I would choke myself. 

She then opened the window to let the cold November air in, then she left the room as well. Leaving me tied up like a Christmas turkey and suffering alone in my pain and discomfort. 

I was left there until Monday morning, because both Miss Turner and Mrs Thorpe had Sunday off, and didn’t think about me. 

When they realised that I was still tied up, they raced up to the icy cold room, to find me, blue with the cold, both of my hands swollen and turning nearly purple from restricted blood flow to them. 

I was quickly untied and taken down to the doctor’s office, she was horrified and wanted to call an ambulance, but the Governor, Miss Jackson advised her not to, saying, “Don’t forget, your contract is up for renewal in the new year. We don’t want to do anything hasty, now do we.?” 

The doctor, Fiona Campbell, shook her head and said, “Right, collect up every hot water bottle you can find and bring them here, call the kitchen and get them to boil up as much water as it would take to fill the bottles and bring the filled bottles here, ok”. 

Miss Turner and Mrs Thorpe ran off the gather hot water bottles, while Miss Jackson called the kitchen to get water boiled. 

While tending to me, Dr Campbell looked at Miss Jackson and said, “I see Miss Turner has been playing her games again, how long did she have this poor bitch tied up for.?” 

Miss Jackson said, “I don’t know, I haven’t been here since Friday, so I hope it was just since yesterday, but I don’t know for sure.” 

I spent the next two weeks in the medical bay, my hands slowly regained their usual colour, but it took months to get the normal feeling and use out of them, both Mrs Thorpe and Miss Turner blamed each other for what happened to me, but neither lost their jobs nor got reprimanded in any way.  

It was eventually found out that poor little Annie had been beaten up by Mrs Thorpe as a way of framing me and getting me locked up in the punishment room or as Miss Turner called it, “the playground.” 

Both Mrs Thorpe and Miss Turner kept their distance from me from then on, but I could see in their eyes the same look that was in John’s eyes when he wanted to assault me. I knew then that there were many like John in the world.  

The years passed, and I was approaching eighteen, soon to be released, I was informed that I would be given a new identity, and date of birth and would be relocated somewhere else in the UK. 

On a chilly Friday in April 1963, I was taken to London by train, taken to a scruffy, rundown bedsit in Camden, given a new birth certificate, five pounds and a letter giving me an address to report to on Monday morning.  

This was it, I was now officially Mary Ann Miller, age eighteen, D.O.B. 01/02/1945. Both parents are dead. I was literally thrown in at the deep end. 

I had no life skills, I couldn’t cook anything more than an egg sandwich, and I could make a coffee, but that was the limit of my culinary skills.  

Whilst in the secure unit, I was given a basic school education, as written down by law, but then afterwards, I was trained in shorthand, and touch-typing, thereby setting me up for a secretarial job. 

The address I had been given was for a temp agency, so the first thing I did was to find the nearest newsagents shop and purchase a copy of the London Street atlas, it cost me 3d. 

 

This proved to be a lifesaver, I was quickly able to find my way to the temp agency on Monday morning, I was given a quick test of my skills and was hired on the spot.  

The following day I started work in the typing pool at a large insurance firm, typing up quotes and getting them ready to be sent out to customers. 

I was working with two other girls, Betty, and Carol, both were about my age, and both were heavily into the music scene, which was starting to emerge in London, after all, it was the start of the “Swinging Sixties”. 

Under their guidance, I soon found my feet in London and on Friday and Saturday nights, we would go to the Monarch, a club in Camden, it took a few visits for me to come out of my shell, but soon, I was on the dance floor alongside Betty and Carol.  

Being slim and blond, I soon attracted the attention of men in the club, trying to buy us drinks, etc, as Betty remarked, not in a cruel way, “They are around you like flies around dogshit”. 

We all laughed, accepted the drinks, and danced with the better-looking guys, they might have got a kiss and a small cuddle, but we three girls left together.  

At work, I was regularly called to take dictation from Mr Jenkins, he was a slimy, overweight man in his forties. 

He thought that he was God’s gift to women, and he always stunk of an aftershave that was popular at the time, Hi Karate, admittedly, it smelt nice of the men in the club on Friday and Saturday night, but he smelt like he bathed in it. 

I dreaded having to take dictation from Mr Jenkins, what with the aftershave, he had bad breath, and he would get very “handy” if you got too close. 

I always felt like I needed a long bath after being in the same room as him, he would always try to get me to sit on his lap, to which I always refused, I had learnt my lesson in the first week. 

Back then, I was naive enough to do as he requested, he seemed to have more hands than an octopus, when I finally got out of his office, my stockings were laddered from his nails, and my blouse had been pulled out of the top of my skirt. 

I left his office and fled to the ladies, that is where Betty found me crying, she helped me fix my make-up and tidy myself up a bit.  

I said about reporting him to the boss, but Betty said, “I tried that when I first started here, but all the boss said was, “Oh, it just means that he likes you, you should be flattered.” 

So, I knew then that there was no point in doing anything but staying out of his clutches in the future. This proved harder to do than I had anticipated.  

It seemed that nearly every day, Mr Jenkins had some dictation that needed to be taken. But now, I stayed on the other side of the desk.  

It was hard to concentrate on what Mr Jenkins was dictating to me when I was constantly on my guard for him to make a move around the desk.  

 

One Friday afternoon, I was sitting at my desk, busily typing up the latest dictated letter from Mr Jenkins, when it struck me, I realised where I had seen his eyes before, it was my stepdad, John, somehow, he had returned and was trying to hurt me again. 

I sat and shook, the fear was building up inside of me, and the pressure was building like a kettle coming to a boil, just then, Mr Jenkins came out of his office and walked over to my desk. 

As he opened his mouth to speak, I screamed, “I killed you once, I can kill you again and picked up my old-fashioned Royal typewriter to throw at him. 

Unfortunately, for me, but luckily for him, it was too heavy to lift easily, so he managed to get out of the way before it smashed onto the floor beside him. 

Betty and Carol both sat in stunned silence at my outburst, I continued, “You don’t recognise me, I’m Marion, remember your stepdaughter, you raped me and got me pregnant, and I killed you five years ago. Why won’t you stay dead.?” 

Everyone was looking at me as I tried to get to Mr Jenkins. Two of the other male managers managed to restrain me until the police arrived. 

When the police arrived, I was still screaming profanities at Mr Jenkins, and saying that I was going to kill him for what he did to me in the past. 

I was arrested and taken to the police station, and locked in a cell, I was left there to “cool down”, I was interviewed later that afternoon. 

In the interview, I was asked what caused my outburst at work earlier.? I said, “Mr Jenkins is my stepfather, but I killed him five years ago, he has come back to rape me again, if he comes near me, I’ll kill him again.” 

The police doctor suggested calling for a psychiatric assessment, to see what was going on in my head.  

I was taken to St Pancras Hospital and locked up in the secure mental unit, to await a full psychiatric assessment on the following Monday. 

On Monday morning, I was seen by two clinical psychiatrists, they asked me lots of questions, and as I was talking, one of them was writing copious notes.  

I was asked about my childhood, so I told them all about John Lister and how he had abused me and got me pregnant at the age of twelve,  

and how my mum had taken me to a back street abortionist, who had perforated my uterus, nearly killing me, and having to have a full hysterectomy to save my life. 

Then after I recovered, John tried to rape me again, so I killed him with a chair leg, and how I had been locked up in a secure unit until I was eighteen, 

Then I was released with a new identity and relocated to London, but John Lister had found me again and wanted to hurt me, so it was a case of I had to kill him before he hurt me again. 

I was returned to my isolated room, while the psychiatrists tried to verify my story, but because I was a child when I killed John, all of my case papers were securely under lock and key. 

So, the psychiatrists thought that I was just making it all up, so, I was classed as psychotic and kept locked up and kept sedated or as the staff like to call it, “under the chemical cosh.” 

I was kept there for roughly four years, when I was taken in, I was bright-eyed, willowy, and blonde, when I left there, I was an overweight woman with pale blotchy skin, with hair like straw. 

I was deemed “cured” by the psychiatrists, so I was released into a hostel, that was full of Junkies and alcoholics. 

There I was, twenty-seven years old, with no family or friends, no job or even any job prospects, where I had spent the last years lost in a chemical haze, I barely knew my name. 

I drifted through life, surviving on dole money, unemployed and unemployable, slowly drifting in a never-ending downward spiral. 

Soon, I ended up on the streets, shunned by society, sleeping in doorways and alleyways, I ended up in the clutches of a pimp, who after getting me hooked on drugs, put me out on the street as a prostitute, earning money for him. 

One night, I was approached by a middle-aged man, he spoke with a Glaswegian accent, which instantly took me back to the Gorbals and my stepfather John. 

I saw John, looking out of the man’s eyes, I tensed up and grabbed the knife that I carried in my pocket for protection, and I stabbed him in the chest.     

The man gasped and dropped to the ground in the dirty, weed-covered alleyway, he shuddered and lay still. 

I walked away down the alleyway, leaving the man in a puddle of his own blood, ten minutes later, another prostitute took her punter down that alley and found him. 

The police flooded the area for days, searching for his killer, but without any leads, they got nowhere. All it did was scare would-be punters away from the red-light district. 

It took two weeks for business to get back to normal, but three weeks later, I saw John come back again, I saw him looking out from a young black man’s eyes. 

I kept my cool and led him down a nearby alleyway, and stabbed him to death again, over the next two years, I killed John, fourteen times and each time he comes back, I wonder how many more times I must kill him before he stays dead for good.
