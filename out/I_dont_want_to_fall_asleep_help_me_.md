I can't afford to fall asleep. Caffeine has lost its effect on me and sheer will only leads to me passing out. I tried multiple home made remedies as well as non-prescription drugs and my doctors are not taking me seriously. I've run out of all options and I'm scared I will sleep again. I understand it's not ‘normal’ to desire the lack of sleep. I understand it's not normal to want a plague that has taken hold of millions of people. But I need insomnia, I don't want to dream. I will try to explain.

I was in a car crash. I was told I got fairly lucky, that I only received a minor concussion. However, ever since that crash I haven’t been sleeping the same. Dreams used to be rare, about once a year or so. Most of the time I would forget about them right after waking up. But things have changed.

I get them every night…

At the beginning they were rather short and vague. Non descriptive and random. But recently the dreams became very detailed and very real. Lasting what feels like hours I wake up in worlds and places that don’t make sense. I used to be a spectator, watching people live their lives in rather unusual circumstances. But I've become the participant. Like a possession I live through someone else and experience their day to day. I speak with their family like they’re my own, experience their fatigue and pain as if on my own body. Live in their world for a few hours. At first I enjoyed it, there were no consequences. I could experience things I have never even dreamt of. But now I can no longer refer to them as dreams. 

The dreams became nightmares. Nightmares I struggle to wake up from. Nightmares that hurt. Nightmares that get worse by the day. It’s difficult for me to rationalise what happens to me after I wake up from them. Which is why I'm here. I couldn’t find anything on google that permanently stops sleep and my doctors told me sleep is needed for recovery. But I still have hope there is something. There must be something! Some sort of remedy kept hidden from the public. A prototype drug or a fucking magical spell? I'm willing to try anything. Please if you know something I could use, don’t hide it from me. I can't afford to fall asleep. 

Thinking about it now I know exactly how to convince you, I'll simply show you a glimpse of what I have been dealing with. You like stories? Let me tell you one. I had this dream yesterday…

I woke up to the sight of a bordered up window. The glass was broken, with its shards littering the wooden panels and window sill. The blinds were  ripped to shreds, the middle was part gone with only the two sides reminiscent of hair strands remaining. Due to the cold breeze they were waving in my direction, beckoning me to come closer. With each step the silence was interrupted with creaks of boards and thuds of my shoes. The closer I got the more outside light made the nearby surroundings darken, forcing my vision and my eyes to peek in between the boards. I saw remnants of giants, skyscrapers and office blocks. Most were intact, but some had entire chunks collapsed. The holes left by them appearing as if bitten off. Through those cracks and wounds I saw what beckoned me. It was over towering the other skyscrapers, cutting right into the low hanging clouds that entrapped our skies. A monolith of which end was not visible. Of deep red its mass flowed in the rhythm of a heartbeat.  Tensing with each pump its muscles twitched occasionally. It shined as if it was fully liquid or slime but stayed rigid as If it was bone.  The more I stared the more I thought I heard voices within its veins. It reassured me to-

“Oi new kid! What I tell ya about staring at the tower, you here to work or to stare?” A deep and growly voice stenching of nicotine shook me awake. The man was my ‘teacher’. Sitting on the floor next to the portable cooker he resembled a large beaver. With his short arms and obese stomach he wore a dark jacket that hung on him like a robe. Its layers of dust did a good job at hiding the numerous stains that grew on it. His face was hidden behind a gas mask with two filters on each side, his own stare hidden behind a black visor.

“Your dad, if you have one. What did he say happens to people that stare at the tower for too long?” He pointed his massive and greasy finger at me.

“You die…” I reluctantly muttered. 

“He was never on outside duty then, lucky bastard! I’ll explain after we eat.” rolling to his side he reached for the portable gas cooker and turned it on. Its flames caused the corners of the room to darken. I sat down next to him with my knees tucked to my chin. My teacher reached deep into his rucksack to retrieve our meal, the can was so rusty its label was no longer eligible. Neither was the food that came out of it, it always tasted like dog food and looked like sludge. I didn’t want to look at it, so I stared off into the dark corridor to our front. From it a shape moved closer to us, it reared its head through the shadow until I recognised its face or rather what was on it. A gasmask, with it came the sound of slow and low pitched beeps. They  filled me with comfort. 

“It’s safe, masks off.” the man emerged from the shadows while ripping the mask off of his face. It revealed a skinny man with dark bags under his eyes as well as a deep stubble with a full buzz. Upon hearing this news my teacher and I both did the same. Sluggishly I peeled it off… It was the same as theirs but somehow felt different, It looked more worn. Visible scratches and marks all around especially at the visor. It stared back at me with hate, I couldn’t understand how something so foul could sit on my face. 

The slender stranger sat down further away from us. Most of his body was hidden in shadow except his eyes which reflected the flame of the portable cooker. He had his own food and water. He sat in the furthest corner with most of his body hidden by a rubber cloak.

“So kid, as you were told I'm a Marker. I mark spots that should be avoided or exterminated.” The Marker's greasy hand passed me a folded up map. Unravelling it exposed a giant hand drawn map of the city. Multiple areas have been drawn over in red. Next to those zones were names like: “Hive”, “Tree”, “Man Squid” etc. The map itself was old and torn. Safe houses were marked with coffee stains. 

“When a location is found, I go to identify it. Once I know what it is, I mark it. That's what you’ll end up doing if you listen. You may be the new kid for now but you will become a Marker soon enough. “ Using a spoon he hid in his front pocket he stirred the mass.  I stared blankly at the old map, trying my best to avoid locking eyes with the sludge.  

“Don’t be sad kid. Being a marker ain't that bad. Look at me I'm fat, old and ugly. It’s rare for someone working on the outside to have a beer belly. You know why? It’s because unlike Mr Serious over there Markers do fuck all!” Marker raised his hand and extended his sausage finger towards the other man in the shadows. I couldn’t tell if the man's facial expression changed at all, I'm not even sure he was blinking. He seemed less human than the things we were hiding from. He was a Scout, every few months someone new becomes a Scout. They don't live too long…

We ate, we packed and we left. 

“So kid, what do YOU think happens when you stare at it too long?” My Teacher asked while stumbling down the road ahead of me. Like a penguin swinging from side to side with each step. 

“You don’t die?” I asked while staring blankly at the ashy road. 

“You do to some. Look around kid, you’ll see one of the poor bastards who didn’t listen.” I raised my head and panned over the surroundings. Giant grey buildings melted into each other due to decades of dust merging them together. It was impossible to tell what their purpose was, most signs and advertisements rotted away with the products inside. The only thing left were their giant entrances. With most glass shattered the buildings had wide gaping holes instead of doors, making them not even a viable campsite. What used to be the pride of man now reduced to a landmark.

Everything from our clothes to homes was grey, It made me forget that colour used to exist. And more importantly that red still does. About a few blocks in front of us stood a giant being. Its deep and thick roots grew through the building it blossomed out of. It caused major structural failure making the building to collapse in favour of the being growing. It was about 4 stories high, it sprouted hundreds of branches and thousands of leaves that occasionally floated through the wind. Its deep red colouring easily stood out in the nearby gloom. It’s bark was in the shape of hundreds of arms either hugging each other still or trying to claw and pull themselves closer to the top, with each arm constantly in motion. The branches were the lucky arms that manage to get any sunlight and sprout their offspring. Similar to a muscle the bark tensed and relaxed causing it to dance as if manipulated by the wind. But the wind was too rhythmic. At first I felt it brush against me, causing me to work harder with each step. After a noticeable pause however, it reeled me closer making it an effort to slow down. It was breathing, that thing was alive…

“That particular bastard took out a whole building.” I quickly glanced to my left. My Teacher was sat on a nearby car with a flask in his hand. It reeked of booze. 

“I knew a guy that stared too long. It only takes 15 minutes to grow roots.” The Scout's lifeless voice made my heart stop. All this time he was dead quiet, I forgot he was with us.

“Oh reeaally? What you do to him?” My teacher in a mocking manner raised the pitch of his voice while holding in laughter.

“Burned him.” The scout still refused to blink. A strong silence followed.

“So... Are we here to mark… him?” I asked while pointing at the tree.

“No no no, that bastard has been on my map for a few years now. We’re here to mark an actual threat.” The Teacher in an aggressive and swift swing pointed towards a large building on our left. It looked exactly like the buildings adjacent to it. Other than a hole on the other side of the building which created a nice shortcut. 

“A shortcut?” I asked in confusion.

“Hah good one. You look confused kid, cmon time for you to learn. Go in and tell me exactly what is wrong with that building.” He waved his hand in a shoo motion. I fixed my backpack and began marching towards the building. Almost instantly I felt the Teacher's thick hand grip my backpack and yank me towards him. I ended up leaning back on his sweaty chest, the stench of alcohol managed to break through my filter. 

“And that's how your life would have ended Kid. Not even a body to bury. Look at it. This building wasn’t there a few days ago, you think we built it?” I stood up and stared at the building. There were no signs it wasn’t brick, in fact it looked more realistic then the buildings nearby.  As if the thing got so good at mimicking the reference became the cheap copy. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed that the scout was continuing down the road without us. My teacher noticed and loosened his grip.

“He’s a Scout. Scouts scout. He should be back by the time we finish marking. Anyway marking is simple. You paint a mark on nearby buildings and the thing itself. Then mark it on the map, then I drink.” He handed me a home made spray can, made from an old hairspray connected to a small bag of paint. Approaching the building my body began profusely sweating and my heart beating an inconsistent orchestra. My hairs stood up and skin gained goosebumps. The light coming from the other side of the building was blinding, too bright to be coming from the outside. I couldn’t even hear any wind coming from the building, it was absolutely dead quiet. But I refused to be paralysed by fear, I began drawing giant red crosses everywhere nearby. 

“Write on the building ‘Mother in law’. GIANT letters.” He ordered between the sips of his flask. Frequently moving his mask to the side to fit his rusty flask. “That’s what we call it. Nothing else matches it so closely hehe.” he chuckled underneath his stinking breath. I Took a few steps back in. Between hundreds of small red crosses the name of ‘MOTHER IN LAW’ could be read. It did somehow fit quite nicely. Marking the building was short but tedious.

“Can’t we just destroy it?” I asked while handing back the spray can to My teacher. He leaned his heavy body back which caused the metal hood to bend.

“That's the ‘Exterminators’ Job. But I haven’t seen em in years. The best way to get rid of those things is by burning them. The problem is, fuel ain't cheap. They stopped giving them supplies once we began running low, Exterminators had to find their own. After that most became scouts, but some tried to continue their job. They’re probably dead now. ” He took a few deep breaths, before downing the flask. To my horror his rucksack was full of them.

 We waited for 15 minutes but the Scout never came back to us. Even after waiting another 15, even after a few forced sips of the gasoline from the flask he was still not here. My teacher began to show signs of frustration. I could hear from underneath the stench of alcohol how he cursed the scout for his unpunctuality. It didn’t take long for my body to begin rejecting the ingested liquids. Headaches and dizziness disrupted my equilibrium. At first I thought the falling droplets on my head were a part of this alcohol induced migraine but I was mistaken. 

It began to rain…

“Get up kid. Up on your feet now!” My teacher exploded onto his feet immediately pulling me up to mine. He began swinging his head from side to side to find shelter, with an anxious step he hesitated to pick a direction to head towards. In the short pause I noticed how the rain bred and multiplied. Slowly creating multiple puddles of deep red sludge all over the road. An overpowering stench of rot began to fill my nostrils.

“Faster!” He began hobbling in between puddles trying his best to avoid them. It didn’t take long for the rain to turn to a storm, waves of blood gushing from the sky trying to drown us like ants. 

“What about the scou-” 

“FUCK HIM!”  With clenched teeth he growled at me. His bark temporarily drowned out the raging storm and I became paralysed in fear. I glanced down at my hands, hidden behind a thick layer of leather I saw nothing. No battle scars, no signs of ageing, achievements or even embarrassments. Only cuts and stains from someone else's story, in fact all of my equipment came from someone else. Each piece of fabric on my body could tell more stories and tales then I ever could. How many times was my mask ripped off a corpse before it was forced into my hands? Just how much colour faded away due to sunlight? Is my name even written down somewhere? ‘No…’ I thought.

The storm quickly turned into a hurricane, standing underneath its ruthless barrage was becoming damaging by the second. I knew that if I stood still any longer, I would simply become a red mist or something far worse. I quickly shook my head from side to side trying to find any form of shade or safety. Most houses were broken due to these frequent barrages, apart from one. Massive almost colossal building, its entrance spacious and wide. It looked almost pristine even having a few steps making it elevated and safe from the flood. The inside was hidden by a half opened metal shutter, only reaching down to my hip. I should have at least considered other options before dashing towards it like a mad man. I didn’t even consider why My Teacher didn’t think of it as a viable option. Before sliding down into the darkness I decided to look over my shoulder and shout.

“It's safe here! MARKER!” At first I thought the storm drowned out his response. But he indeed was nowhere to be seen, the road morphed more and more into a river by the second. It must have taken him, changed him. Not even his precious flask was visible in the red, the only piece of him left was that stench that burned into my clothes. Searching for him would be suicide, so instead I saved myself. 

Upon turning on my flashlight I realised I made a mistake. The floor was overtaken by leftover jackets, trousers and other cloth. So numerous it created  mounds which piled up almost to the ceiling. The mounds were so large they casted multiple shadows which made the room harder to navigate. Every few steps I had to glance around a mound to ensure nothing was hiding, but with every step I simply heard a skitter next to me in the darkness. My patient walk turned into a nervous march until I reached a small opening in a wall. It was a narrow cone shaped corridor leading to a downwards staircase. The staircase made from metal seemed to have been mobile at some point, yet now it lay overgrown with dust and dirt. It led so deep underground my flashlight failed to penetrate the bottom. My stomps didn’t even echo back to me, they were fully taken in by the tunnel. Everything was telling me not to take another step, even the cold breeze from the tunnel was gently pushing me away. But I didn’t really have a choice.

The storm wouldn’t disappear for a few days and going back home through it would be impossible. I thought at least I would be safe from it underground and maybe I could even find another exit which would lead me closer home.

 With each downward step I tried to convince myself I wasn’t naïve nor curious, that Instead I was correct and smart. I was surrounded by the remnants of the past, posters about upcoming theatre shows and most effective painkillers. Full of bright colours and scripted smiles they extended all the way to the bottom where I could see more cloth and luggage. The underground extended to multiple intertwined corridors of identical walls and posters. The deeper I marched the less clothing overtook the floors. Instead grime and rust began showcasing just how abandoned this place really was. Turning my head towards a nearby wall I saw a graffiti in the style of the Marker. In bold yet faint red it read “Shortcut”. My heart began pounding and I felt a sudden rush of energy, my whole body shook. I marched, no I sprinted towards the tight turn. Eager to leave this wretched place. To go home. To live. 

The corner lead to the corridor's end. Another giant room similar to the entrance, it was gently lit by sunlight flowing down another metal staircase. It lit the nearby stained posters, it lit the shiny columns, it lit the floor covered with blood. Piles of meat and bone were scattered around the room, fresh and rotten they were blended together. Human limbs and torsos half eaten or ripped to shreds were stuck to walls like trophies. Some parts were hanged by their intestines hanging from the high ceiling, dripping blood which slowly crawled towards my boot. I stopped counting at 15, this was a mass feeding ground of a nest…

Or one… One big one…

Through the shock I didn’t even notice the hand gripping my mouth shut until that recognisable cold voice spoke to me. 

“Don’t scream. It’s here with us.” The scout slowly let go of the pressure. Instead sliding down to my shoulder and pulling me away from the massive room. He was drenched in blood, similar to me. Somehow I could tell he was smiling behind the mask. Not because he found me, but because he found it.

“If it's your size, aim at its chest. If it's bigger, aim for your head.” He handed me a well kept pistol, it was loaded with the safety off. He began walking away, without even asking if I knew how to use it. I followed him deeper underground, passing other bodies and growths. Red roots grew in the walls and floor making the rust look extinct. The stench of rot grew.

“That exit was caved in. We never write the word ‘Shortcut’.  I will show you another exit… You’ll make it home from there.” The scout explained while carefully traversing the mutated tunnel.

“Why? You left us, why are you helping now?” I asked, tightly gripping my pistol. He came to a sudden stop, bouncing off of his back I lifted my head to see his black visor staring me down. 

“Didn’t you leave him?” The silence after stung like daggers. I was left speechless. Only after a moment I realised the Scout was no longer eying me down with his black visor. His gaze was fixed above my shoulder, I could see his face muscles tense as a wide grin began to overtake him. Very slowly and methodically he unsheathed another pistol, far bigger and dirtier than mine. With his spare hand he grabbed my wrist and pulled me behind him. Something stalked us.

The Scout kept his grip strong, purposefully preventing me from shining light towards the thing. The bouncing rays however managed to faintly illuminate its rearing head which almost touched the ceiling. With its massive carcass hidden in shadow I could only make out the look of its face. Rows of elongated human teeth were bent out of shape to resemble a crooked grin. It must have bashed its head on the nearby concrete until it resembled a smile. Its skull seemed to be elongated to resemble the jaw of a dog while still being part human. With its skin pale and smooth no hair grew on it, lacking eyebrows or even eyelashes. Its eyes were fixed on me. Its eyeballs were  twice the normal size but its iris’ were shrunken. I only made out a hint of blue as for the first few seconds I was convinced its eyes were fully white. 

“Don’t run until I shoot. Find a place to hide.” The scout released his grip and began gently pushing me deeper into the tunnel. As if routine I began slowly walking deeper into the growths. In between my shallow breaths I heard a moist thud followed by a loud gunshot. I began sprinting into the shadows while the ringing in my ears grew, for a few seconds I heard faint pops until I couldn’t hear anymore. In my panicked escape I found a lonely opened door which I crawled into. I tried my best to slam it shut but its locks were rusted over. The room was too small and it had no other exit, I had to find a hiding spot. The room was mostly empty with only a few sofas and lockers littering the corners. I crashed into the closest one ripping it open and hiding inside. 

My heart was pounding and my lungs burning. I shut the flashlight and gripped the pistol tightly. The ringing of my ears slowly subsided alongside my irregular breaths, chaos slowly clawed its way back into silence. When my hearing came back I focused, I tried to find any evidence for the Scout being alive. A cough, his inhuman breathing or even his cold voice. But the outside darkness didn’t budge. I heard nothing.

I lost count so many times I can't even tell you how long I was in that locker. I was naively waiting for the scout to find me cowering in that locker, even though I knew well enough he was dead. A part of me was even waiting for the ‘dog’, I hoped it would at least take pity and kill me quickly. But none of my prayers were answered, so I was forced to leave the locker myself.

With my hands trembling I gently pushed the locker open. The room was covered in shadow so I lit it using my flashlight.

Its head was now full of blood and its teeth had visible chunks of meat and skin stuck to it. It was less than a few inches away from my face, its bright blue eyes stared me down. The dog's top jaw began sliding open, the rows of teeth extended all the way down to its throat where I saw the scout's severed hand waving to me. With full force it bit down on my forearm causing me to wake up from the trance. I tried to shoot it with my pistol but It dragged me out of the locker and onto the floor where its massive paw pinned me to the floor. Its limbs were bony but so strong I felt my lungs collapse on themselves. Like a rottweiler the dog began shaking its head trying to rip my flailing arm off.

I screamed in pain as I felt my nerves shoot all the way through my body, a sudden rush of adrenaline caused me to grip my pistol and begin shooting. I didn’t look nor care where I hit, I continued slamming the trigger until I realised I was screaming in my bed. 

It took me a few minutes to stop my panic attack, I went to my bathroom to wake myself up when I realised my whole arm was covered in blood. I left a whole trail leading to my bed where my mattress was fully drenched. I had to rush myself to the ER/

My doctors told me that I bit myself during sleep, that it happened while sleepwalking. The wound needed multiple stitches and I still can't move my arm properly. Even now looking at it I notice that my jaw just can't extend that far. I don’t know how it happened, if my dream even meant anything. But I just know one thing, I can't fall asleep again, I'm scared of the consequences.

Help me. I beg you.
