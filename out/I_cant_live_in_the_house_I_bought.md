So, backstory first:

The only reason why I managed to buy a house on my own, at my age, is that I pretty much won the lottery.

About four years ago, the man I worked for turned out to be a complete monster, and the lawsuit finally paid out around six months back.

I didn’t really know what to do with that money. I have neither great ambitions nor dreams for my life. I don’t need an expensive car or shit like that, and yeah, a family would be neat someday, but I’m definitely not in a rush to make one...

Then again, people told me that I couldn’t just let the money rot in my bank account, and honestly, I don’t trust stocks too much, so I chose to do something else.

I bought a house.

The only things I told the nice realtor lady were that I wanted it to be modest and not part of an HOA. I’ve heard too many horror stories about those these past few years...

The location wasn’t too important either, since I don’t have kids and I’m taking a bit of time off from work to finally reorganize my life. I even joked that I didn’t mind living someplace with a dark history, as long as the price of the property reflected that. The realtor didn’t look too happy with that; he just smiled politely and nodded.

She showed me a few houses, and the one that stood out to me was a single-family home built in the sixties half an hour away from a small city out west.

The location wasn’t that great, and the building itself had a few tiny problems, like DIY repairs made by a past owner, but I fell in love with the price and the tranquility of the area.

Officially, it’s part of a small town, but the houses are sprawled out enough so you don’t get nosey neighbors, and not having to listen in on other people’s conversations is such a godsend!

I brought someone in to check the structure and foundation, and they gave me the green light as well, so I signed the documents, and now, since Wednesday last week, I’m the official owner of the house.

And that is where the problems began.

I got pretty much all my stuff in with me on moving day, but since there was hardly any furniture in there besides two old wardrobes, it still looked and felt somehow empty.

Two of the windows didn’t close completely, which I apparently missed during all those walk-throughs; sometimes the water pressure lowers, but only for a few seconds; and then I found white dust all over the floor of one room.

Well... the first night I spent in there was dreadful.

I could feel a breeze even though all the windows were shut; there was this soft whistling sound keeping me awake, and worst of all, I smelled this strange musty stench every time I closed my eyes.

Honestly, after I woke up for the third time, I contemplated selling it all again and just moving back to the city... but that’s not how I was raised.

The next morning, I did what I always do:

I made a list of things that needed to be done.

First, I got someone in to check the boiler and the pipes, but there was no problem with the water pressure when he was here, so the guy took my money and drove off.

Then, I called a friend to help me look at all the windows, and we found three of them with slight gaps even while closed. I ‘fixed’ the problem with some duct tape and made a note to get someone in here who could switch them out.

Next, after my friend had left, I tried to find out where the whistling sound and the stench were coming from. I started in the attic, stood in the center, and waited for a few minutes for something to happen.

Nothing.

So I moved through the house, stopping in every room.

Still, I didn’t find what I was looking for. No sound, no smell, but three of those rooms had this white dust on the floor, right by the wall.

I remember feeling this unease then for the first time. Curiosity got the better of me, and I bent down and picked up a bit of the stuff between my fingers. It was dry and didn’t smell of anything in particular.

The relief I felt didn’t last long though.

I found two more rooms with that white stuff on the floor, and my thoughts turned to termites or the like.

It was almost midnight already, so I decided I would simply go to bed and wait for the sun to rise again before I began looking for possible pests.

The next few days, while waiting for my window guy to call me back, I started noticing other things around the house.

Lights were switched off after I left. A scraping sound coming from the next room over, slight traces of the stench sometimes when I entered a room, and more white powder on the floor.

But there was no sign of dead insects, nor could I hear anything when I put my ear against the wall, besides my own breathing.

It was then that I started to get paranoid. At least, I think so.

From time to time, I felt like someone was watching me, and it wasn’t just when I was in a specific room. I could walk down the stairs and suddenly stop because I could feel the hair on my arms standing straight up. While I was brushing my teeth, I thought I could hear someone walking by the door of the bathroom.

Just when I started to fall asleep, I dreamed I heard a person crawling through the house downstairs.

Stuff like that.

Every day I found myself almost sneaking from room to room, listening for suspicious noises in my own home. This wasn’t what I had imagined when I bought this house, I had to admit.

Only... this paranoia seemed to increase.

Some days, when I woke up, I found things missing from my fridge. Others, I came down in the morning and noticed pictures hanging on the wall having shifted off-center. Once, I even lost a blanket for two days before it seemingly reappeared out of thin air on my couch again.

I felt like I was losing my mind in there.

Well... that was until three days ago.

After showering in the evening, where the water suddenly stuttered again, and I felt a cold breeze blowing through my bathroom, I finally had enough.

Dressed in slacks, with my phone in hand, I rushed to the first room where I had found that white dust on the floor, and as soon as I entered it, I could feel those eyes on me again.

That room had been the bane of my existence since I moved in. It was one of the two with a wardrobe, and no matter what I did, it always felt kinda breezy in there.

I stood in its center for five minutes, looking around and listening.

Nothing moved, I thought, but I didn’t give up that time.

Instead, I walked over to the side, right to the spot where the white stuff had fallen, and pressed my ear against the wall.

I could hear myself breathing heavily, then clasped a hand over my mouth.

The sound didn’t stop. It didn’t even get quieter.

With my ear still against the wall, I could hear someone breathing, maybe two inches away from me.

I froze up completely and listened to this other person slowly taking in air and then letting it out again.

It sounded raspy and old.

I think whoever was in there realized I had noticed them as well.

The breathing stopped, and then I heard the same noise I had listened to almost every time I had laid down in bed. A scraping sound as someone shifted their body inside the wall, and then slowly started crawling away.

My eyes fell on the wardrobe, and I was running toward it before the noise could disappear.

Something inside me screamed at me to run away, but I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I needed to know.

Without wasting another second, I ripped open the door of the wardrobe and looked inside.

It seemed... normal. Empty.

Not thinking clearly, I kicked out at the backboard and felt it shift and break, then saw it fall inward.

The noise inside the wall got louder as the person in there started to speed up.

I screamed at them, turned on the light of my phone, and shot forward into the wardrobe.

A wave of this musty stench greeted me before I could even put my head in there.

Still, I pushed on. I wanted to see what was hidden in my walls, and as I finally managed to get my head and arm inside, I caught a single glimpse of the figure squeezing itself around the corner of the crawlspace.

It was pale, old, and gaunt, with white hair and calloused hands and feet.

This thing... this person disappeared, and all I could do was stare into the empty space between my rooms as I heard it crawling and shuffling away.

I didn’t follow it. I’m not that dumb.

Instead, I pulled back and called the police while I ran to the kitchen and armed myself with a knife.

The officers arrived twenty minutes later, which I still find completely unacceptable, but as I led them through the house and to the wardrobe, I could see the expressions on their faces turn from annoyed to bewildered.

One of them put his whole upper body inside and looked around with a flashlight before quickly stepping back and shaking his head.

There was no way he would crawl into that space, he told me, and honestly, I can understand him.

Flanked by the two officers, who were now waiting for backup, we walked through the house, listening for the noise of the man in the walls.

I think the last time I heard him move was somewhere on the first floor.

He was rushing past us, then crawling upwards.

I’ve spent the last two days in a hotel, hardly able to sleep, while one of the officers is kind enough to give me updates.

They found four entry points for now, all located in different rooms, hidden as either wardrobes or some even as fake vents.

Somehow the guy installed a tap in the pipes, which explains the sudden drop in water pressure.

Worse yet, they also found what looks like an old, rusty bayonet that was used to scratch holes into the walls, which could be hidden by the wallpaper.

They discovered over a dozen of them, spread out throughout the house.

This man was watching me. Follow me. Studying my daily routine, I think.

I’m glad I found out when I did, seeing as the officer I’ve been in contact with had something else to tell me.

Apparently, there was some sort of diary in one of the crawl spaces. He didn’t say what was in it, but his refusal tells me enough.

Sadly, the thing they didn’t find, is the man.

He’s still there, my instincts tell me.

Hiding somewhere.

There’s no way in hell I’m going to set foot on that property again.

I’d love to burn it down and wash my hands of it, but I’m afraid it won’t be that easy, right?

So... does anyone want to buy a house? The area is great, but your roommate sucks...

At least I can promise you it’s [cheap.](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/comments/10hqkpe/haunted_tales_a_horror_anthology_podcast/)
