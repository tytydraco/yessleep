Wilmington County has the Worst Drivers in the World

I know everybody says this. I’ve driven in fifteen states, 3 countries, and probably hundreds of small towns. My fiance got me into it. Every town has a soul, she’d always say and she was right. You go to all these places and it feels like there’s something in the air. Not like they’re brainwashed or even necessarily like-minded. It’s like a frequency on the radio that everyone has tuned in the back of their heads. You feel some sort of noise when you enter a close community anywhere across the world. Sometimes you and everyone there knows you should leave before things get ugly. People gravitate toward the frequency of their location. I’ve seen all kinds of places, all unique. And across all of them there are bad drivers.

But when I went back to the county where my fiance grew up, where her parents lived, it became a nightmare I still barely believe. We noticed it the moment we saw the sign:

Now Entering Wilmington County

A white van driving on the wrong side of the road made me veer right into oncoming traffic and then off the side of the road. I put the car in park on the grass. Jessica and I stepped out of the car and cursed loudly at the cars that kept on driving, no horns or rolled down windows.

“You alright Jess?”

“I’m fine, just in shock. What the hell happened? Who were those assholes?”

“No clue.” I replied.

“They must’ve been together, right? Some sort of gang.”

“Maybe, yeah.” I opened the door, got back in our red Honda Civic and put my phone back on the holder, reloading the GPS directions to Jess’ parents house. As she got in the car she looked at me judgmentally for a few seconds before saying.

“Should I call the cops?”

“I mean you can do what you want I guess but we won’t make it for 5:00.”

“Alan, they almost killed us. People could get hurt.”

“They are driving out of the county, I just don’t want to waste our time filing a police report that won’t go anywhere.”

The roads were fairly empty on the way into town. There were a few people speeding on the other side, and one guy in a white pickup overtook me. It was when we reached the first four way stop that everything turned to shit. At first there was nobody there. An empty intersection in a bizarrely empty town. I stopped at the stop sign and pressed on the gas into the open street. Out of nowhere a prius smashes into the back passenger side of our car, sending us spinning.

“ALAN!” I heard Jess screech as we slid into a stop. My heart was racing and I tried to focus through the shock. When I finally could, I unbuckled myself and got out of the very damaged car. I look out into the distance to see the prius driving away, fast as they hit us. I ran to check on Jess, who was making her way out of the car when she collapsed face first onto the pavement. She yelled in agony and slithered on the ground.

“My… my ankle…” she muttered as I held her. “Call 911!” She shouted in my face. I looked off again into the horizon where the prius had disappeared into. The intersection was still completely empty. Even the tire shop and the ice cream store seemed completely abandoned.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Some sick bastard hit my car and then ran off! My fiance… Her ankle is hurt, we need help!”

“Okay, and could I get your location sir?”

“We’re at the intersection of Randall Ave and Green. We need help. Please send someone fast.”

“An ambulance will be with you shortly. I’ve dispatched a nearby officer who should be with you in about a minute. Would you mind staying on the line with me?”

“Thank you.” I said and hung up the phone. “They’re sending an ambulance.” I assured Jess who was moaning in pain.

I helped her move to the side of the road and sat with her by the curb. Fetched some water from the car and reassured her again that someone was coming to help. I felt an intense relief when the sound of sirens started getting closer. I didn’t know if I should contact Jess’ parents, or try and figure out if I can still drive the car. I see the dodge charger make a violent, screeching around the corner onto Green St. I stand in front of Jess to wave the officer toward us. The police car was speeding in our direction at 80 MPH and wasn’t slowing down. It was barreling straight toward us. The sirens were deafening. I heard her crying my name as I rolled out of the way. The grille guard tore her apart, leaving her mangled body unmoving on the pavement.

“No…” I said to myself and looked away in horror. The police car stopped suddenly a hundred feet down Randall Ave. There was a streak of Jess’ blood on the road leading from its tires. A tall, pale officer blocked the sun as he exited. He gave me a puzzled look and I backed away, shaking.

“What appears to be the problem, sir? You’re the one who called, right?” He approached me while his partner got out and glanced over. I kept walking backwards until I was right in front of my red car. “Sir, do not get in that vehicle, we just want to talk. Figure out what happened here.” I watched his partner reach for her gun and I darted into the driver's seat, praying the old civic would still accelerate. I never turned off the engine, so I slammed my foot on the gas and turned out the way I came. I saw in my one attached side mirror, the cops rushing to get back in their car. Soon enough, they were right behind me, the sirens that moments ago brought me relief filled me with existential terror. Another police car joined the chase from an intersection I blasted through. I had to weave through a few cars, drive on the wrong side of the road, the shoulder, but I was getting the hell out of there. I peered through the cracked windshield and saw a stopped truck in the distance. It was blocking off a couple lanes in front of me. I swerved the front of it, to see a body in the driver’s seat with a crow pecking at it.

As I kept driving, I heard a smash and an explosion. A cop car had driven straight into the truck and brought a few units down with it. They were still chasing me though. I looked out the window to see a motorcycle pulling up beside me. It wasn't the police, it was like a guy in a full biker outfit, with tattoos and sunglasses. He looked in my direction and shoved his bike right into me, sending himself violently over my windshield and onto the road behind me.

“What the FUCK!” I shouted as I tried to speed up but I could feel the car falling apart. “No, no no no no…” the piece of junk began slowing down as two police cars, one completely busted itself, gained on me. I saw smoke coming from my engine and in a panic, jumped from the moving car. I rolled, collecting scrapes and bruises, but quickly got up and ran off the side of the road into the wooded area.

When I made the mistake of looking back, I watched a cop car hit the curb of the street and fly up toward me. It ended up upside down, wrapped around a skinny tree, and I kept running. The other cop car, the one that was already beaten up, managed to get up over the curb and was driving me down in the scarce woods. I ran faster than I ever thought I could, my tears and sweat morphing together. I was getting tired and I knew I couldn’t outrun a crazed cop car. I braced and made myself as small as possible in the grass. The police car, the first one that still had my fiance’s blood splattered over the front, bumped on a hill and in an act of God, flew an inch over my face and right ahead of me. It kept driving, straight into a tree. I shuddered and walked away as one of the cops got out of the completely totaled Charger. “Hey!” She yelled at me, as I kept walking off, not looking back this time. “What’s going on here? Who the hell are you? Dispatch, I’ve been in an accident. Officer Denman isn’t responding… Hey, stop!” She continued shouting in my direction. I tried to wipe some mud off my face and ended up smearing it across my cheek. I walked right out, passed the sign that read:

Now Leaving Wilmington County

I’m never going back there. I’m never driving again. I don’t know what happened to her family. I don’t care. I’m just glad it’s behind me.
