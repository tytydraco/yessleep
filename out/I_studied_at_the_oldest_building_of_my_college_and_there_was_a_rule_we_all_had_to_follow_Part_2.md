 *Finally!*

That voice haunts me. Every time I’m alone I hear it. It’s as if an invisible thing is following me. I try

to ignore it, research about illnesses that it may cause it and since I am the right age for most to show the first signs. I ponder over whether or not I should go and see a psychiatrist but as soon as the thought enters my mind the voice stops. Like it was never there. Like it had been just my mind going over the things I had seen at the college. 

Everyone’s parents areworried and rightly so. Even though the girl, Naina, was alright, thankfully, she doesn’t remember what happened. As far as she remembers, she was out with her boyfriend and they were looking for a place to talk and then nothing. As for the guy, Chase, he was alive but barely so. Doctors do not know what happened to him. His vitals are fine but he was in a coma, but his brain activity suggested he was wide awake and doing something strenuous like running.

Even though all the departments were shaken, there was nothing to be done. We had our classes and lives to get on with. So, after the well-deserved weekend, we all went back to college, but now there was a certain air of unease. As soon as we entered our building it was as if we all let out a collected sigh of relief. There was now a closure put up in the gallery which led to the restricted area. Some curious necks were raised, including mine, to see the condition of the rooms, if they have been closed or not. To our relief, those were now barred shut with heavy iron board fitted horizontally and bolted. 

Letting out a nervous chuckle, which seemed to break the tension we all moved to our respective classrooms. Once again, nothing interesting was going on, just the revision of what we had learned in the advanced classes in school. I was doodling, it was one of the things I did when I was bored. Draw some flowers, trees, and so on. It calmed me and got my overactive brain to concentrate on the petals or the shape of the leaves of trees.

“Well, that is different,”

Sara said. “Ana, look.”

“Huh,” I reply non-coherently. 

Then as if the back of my notebook finally came into my absolute focus. I have been doodling flowers alright but instead of outlines being just lines it was linked with tiny words.

I lean closer and gasped. The flowers were made of thousands of *“Finally”* written minutely. My heart was beating so fast that all other sounds were blocked out. All sounds except one, one which reared its ugly head after 2 days. 

*Finally!*

I close my notebook with more force than necessary trying to block out the sound that was growing in intensity. 

“No, no, no,” I mutter under my breath. Trying to convince myself that this was just some form of PTSD.

“Hey, Ana, are you okay?”

Sara’s concerned voice finally made the head-pounding pitch “Finally” reaching, to quieten. I turn to my left and see Ana looked unblinkingly at the door where the girl was. Since that door was directly across the window where we were sitting it wasn’t weird. You get bored, you look out and get lost. But the problem wasn’t that. The problem was that despite Sara’s shaking Ana, Ana didn’t blink or look away. We tried everything. Shaking her, pinching her, sprinkling a few drops of water on her face but nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

*You know what she wants to hear. Say it.*

A voice inside me piped up. It was my inner voice but so unlike the one that I was used to. But we were getting out of options, so I did the only thing that somehow my subconscious knew was right.

“Finally!” I say in a low voice. Hoping against all hopes I was wrong.

Ana jerked back as if someone slapped her. Fear in her eyes took over the blank look that had been there.

Oh no. But at the same time, the same voice said something else for the first time.

*Oh Yes!*

I gulp as the fear overtakes me. No, no, no. Ana cannot be- this cannot be true. I was the one who moved forward. It was because of me that Ana came forward. If this was happening to Ana then it was my fault.

“You look worried, \[iknowthisischeesy\],” Ana asks, worried.

I look at her, my eyes were huge. “You don’t remember?”

“Remember what?” Ana frowns.

I narrowed my eyes. But soon realise that Ana really was confused. I let out a sigh of relief. Maybe it was a fluke, nothing more. Maybe Ana was just bored and went to dreamland like I initially thought. Though it didn’t explain why she didn’t react to any of our proddings but I conveniently choose to ignore it. 

“Dude, you were like staring outside continuously and didn’t respond to any of our prodding or even water!” Sara says, her voice rising.

“Shh.” Professor shushes us.

Ana looks stricken for a moment then chuckles. “I was just messing with you guys.”

Even though I was certain Ana was lying, I chose to ignore it. Looking back, I should have kicked myself to action. And I will forever be angry at myself for that.

Soon it’s lunchtime and we forget all about it and get to gossiping. Swapping our lunches and story we don’t even realise it’s time for the next class till we see the empty cafeteria. Giggling we all get up and pick up our stuff and run back to our class. 

“Oh, shit! I need to pee.” Ana says still laughing then clutching her legs tightly so she doesn’t pee now.

Chortling we take her stuff and move towards the classroom. 

“Professor,” I call out as I enter the class. “Ana is going to be a little late.”

The professor nodded saying nothing but Sara once again dissolved into giggles. Nudging her, but smiling myself, we find a place. 

But half an hour later there’s no sign of Ana and I start to get worried. I chew my bottom lip and try to gather my courage to ask the professor if I could go out and look for Ana when we hear a shout.

“Girl! Get away from there.” 

Everyone peers out of the class letting out a gasp. 

“It’s Ana.” Whisper travels across the room and my heart drops.

I run outside; permission be damned. I see Ana trying to pry open one of the bolted doors, not the same one as the girl's but a different one. I run past the screaming guard and stand behind Ana calling her name over and over again but she is not listening to me. She is hellbent on opening that door. I see a small amount of blood on the floor and gasp.

Throwing caution to the wind I grab Ana’s elbow and pull her back. She turns to look at me with such fury that I almost step back. 

Cold chill running up my spine, I say once with all the heart I can muster. “Ana, please.”

Her eyes fog over and shattered out of whatever trance she was under. Before I could speak another word, she screams.
