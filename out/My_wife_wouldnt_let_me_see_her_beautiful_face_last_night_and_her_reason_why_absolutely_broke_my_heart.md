Whenever I thought about my marriage, I always thought the word ‘mistake’ immediately after. Crazy how it only took twenty-three months from our perfect beach wedding for me to start working late rather than rush home and see Rebekah.

Although, as uncomfortable as our relationship became, I never expected I’d never want to see that beautiful face of her's again...

See, this morning started out the same as any other. I got up at seven-thirty, as quietly as possible, and by eight I was out the door and on my bike.

Down the street there’s this huge country park. Early on, you normally only share the path with dog walkers, running groups, and a few territorial geese, but today a little mob had swarmed around a metal bench in the shade of a chestnut tree. Curious about all the commotion, I skidded to a stop.

“Hey, what’s going on?” I asked one guy in bifocals, toward the back of the crowd.

“Some poor woman’s having a nervous breakdown, I think. Poor thing won’t talk to anybody.”

Over the concerned bystanders’ heads, a thin lady in a pink jogging suit lay sprawled sideways under the bench with her face buried in her hands, all quiet and solemn. One man crouched alongside her, attempting to coax her out of her shell, while others offered words of encouragement.

“Tell us what’s wrong. Maybe we can help?”

“My brothers a psychologist, won’t you please speak with him?”

There didn’t seem to be much I could do, so I continued along the trail through the rear exit, into the heart of our ugly, little village.

My store is—was?—called Tech World, your one-stop shop for laptop and smartphone repairs. At midday, after I’d finished explaining to my sole customer Facebook *wasn’t* broken, she’d simply cleared her browser history, I took a look along the high street.

Footfall had become so scarce even the stingiest café owners sent their staff home early. Weird.

Five slow, plodding hours later, I pulled the shutter down and cycled back toward the park.

Alongside the children’s play area, a little boy, ten or thereabouts, blitzed across my path, too suddenly for me to slam on the brakes.

The world rotated 360 degrees as I flipped over the handlebars. From the ground, I looked over at the kid, who’d been sent careening backwards, his arms and legs getting raked open by the gravel.

A little dazed, I sat up rubbing my side. “Crap, sorry bud. Are you okay?”

His eyes flicked from me to the gate he’d burst from, and then he scrambled to his feet and sprinted off into a scattering of trees.

As I lifted my bike, more kids marched after him in no real rush, giggling away. I glanced around just in time to see them disappear into the woodland, their hands cupped over their little faces. Because their arms stayed locked in place, their torsos over-rotated with every step.

Was this some online craze? The newest TikTok trend? It was so difficult to keep track; after ‘planking’, they all sorta blended together…

By the time I arrived home, the sun had slipped below the horizon. In faded jeans and a white T-shirt, my wife sat at the dining room table. Her yellow-butter hair was pulled up, the ponytail swinging cheerfully as she tucked into a lasagna. She had a slender face, with a big, bright smile and wide eyes which balanced out perfectly.

I went into the kitchen, microwaved a Rustlers burger, and ate while leaning against the counter. Was today the day I finally muttered the dreaded D-word? How should I have made the announcement, though? Charades? Or maybe a joke: *what has two thumbs, a great solicitor, and thinks this marriage has run its course?*

To hell with the theatrics. No more procrastinating. Time to rip off the band-aid, quick and easy.

Just as I stepped into the lounge, Rebekah’s phone buzzed. From her concerned expression, I *thought* I knew what direction the night was headed in already, although I couldn’t have been more wrong…

“I’ll be right there.” She hung up, looked over at me, and said, “It’s Darren.”

“What’s wrong?” I asked.

“I’m not sure. The neighbours said he’s crying in the garden, won’t listen to anybody.”

Great, how was I meant to broach such a tender subject now? *Hey babe, sorry your brother’s drinking again, but is this a good time to talk about our relationship?*

Instead, I simply said, “Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.”

She hesitated, as though debating whether this proposal sounded genuine. “I will. If it’s really bad, I might bring him back here.”

Her phone buzzed again. On her way down the hall, she said, “Yes Mom, I’m *literally* on my way over there now. No, I can handle it by myself.”

The evening blitzed past in a whirlwind of Diablo 4 and wildlife documentaries. Come midnight, Rebekah still hadn’t returned, although that wasn’t exactly unusual. If my brother-in-law had a bad day, everyone else did too.

I climbed into bed. That uncomfortable conversation about our marriage could go back to the jury for now, unvoted on.

A stifled sob startled me awake. Tired and groggy, I rubbed my eyes.

In the middle of the darkened room, Rebekah stood frozen mid-stride as though she’d been tiptoeing up on me, crying.

“What happened?” I asked. “Is Darren okay?”

No response, except for more snivels. As my hand fumbled for the bedside lamp, I sat up against the headboard.

Past the foot of our marital bed, Rebekah shielded the smooth oval of her face using her hands—a celebrity hiding from an onslaught of paparazzi cameras.

“Becks?” I said, confused.

She retreated into the shadow of the corner and hovered there, motionless. Ten seconds passed. Twenty. I swung my legs out of bed and walked over to her. “Is something wrong?”

She didn’t react. After a full minute of me trying to elicit a response by massaging her shoulders, I pressed my left ear against her head. Wait, those weren’t sobs—they were giggles. Her shoulders bounced up and down in these wheezy, full-body chuckles.

“Really?” I asked, outraged. There was zero doubt in my mind what this was: a punishment. A giant screw you. Had she sensed the oncoming divorce?

Biting down on a spurt of anger, I put my hands on her forearms and pulled, all in vain. “Are we gonna play this stupid game all night?”

I pulled again, with enough force to tear a phonebook in half. Those soft hands which couldn’t pry open a jar of mayonnaise by themselves didn’t budge a single inch, as if they’d been welded in place. When did Rebekah get so strong?

As I stepped away, panting now, the doorbell rang.

I said, “I take it you want *me* to answer that?”

Nothing. With a weary sigh, I pulled on some sweatpants and a t-shirt. On my way past the door, I heard more chuckles, muffled by Rebekah’s palms. When I spun around, she retreated from the centre of the room once again, making herself as small as possible in the corner.

I went downstairs, where a quick look through the peephole confirmed *more* bad news had arrived. Ut-oh.

“Finally,” my mother-in-law said, as the door swung open. She elbowed past me, stood alongside the staircase and the little side table there. “Can you *please* tell me what the hell is going on? Where’s Rebekah?” The elegant blonde lady unrolled her scarf and slid off her coat.

I said, “Nice to see you too, Anne. She’s upstairs.”

“What happened with her brother?”

“I’m not sure.”

“But wasn’t Rebekah just there?”

“She was, but she’s acting a little…*weird*.”

“How do you mean?”

“…I’m not sure.”

“Useless, absolutely useless,” she said, with a roll of her eyes. “Let me speak to her.”

I gestured at the stairs. “Be my guest.”

Halfway up, she said, “Go make me and Becca some tea. No milk no sugar. And get the guest room ready. I’m not driving home at this time of night with those dope addicts prowling around out there.”

In truth, we lived in a peaceful neighbourhood, just not one that reeked of wealth like hers. By ‘dope addicts’ she probably meant ‘people who make less than six figures a year’.

There’s a very good reason Becks and I eloped and married on a tropical beach...

Delighted to get some breathing space, I went through to the kitchen and popped the kettle on. I’d just poured out the hot water when a door got set banging, randomly, somewhere on the ground floor.

“Hello?”

There was no sound except the house shivering in its various joints. I marched back upstairs, a cup in each hand.

The landing and hallway lights were off. “Rebekah? Anne?” I called. Doors lined both sides of the claustrophobic corridor.

The bedroom door shivered open, only by a few inches. I pushed through using my back and spun into an empty room. “Becks?”

From further down the hall, around the bend, a quiet laugh went up. The rhythm of my heart quickened.

One slow, steady step followed another until I reached the sharp turn—slow half because of the nerves, half so as not to spill any tea.

Across the cramped space, Becks legs poked out under the curtain. Her choked snicker died as I swallowed a gulp and said, “What’s going on? Where’s your mom?”

As her upper body leaned out of the hiding space, her face still encased inside her hands, a dry cramp seized my throat.

My gut begged me to run. My brain, however, defied this wisdom. “If this is a joke, I’m not—”

Behind me, a floorboard creaked.

As my arms flailed around, terrified, I caught a glimpse of wrinkled fingers unlacing, accompanied by a sound like wind hissing through a blown-out window, deep and tonal. Both cups launched into the air, splashing hot tea across the ceiling, while Anne got knocked flying backwards and slammed her skull against the wall. It all happened so fast I couldn’t process the chain of events until I registered the blood splatter above my mother-in-law’s head.

“Oh fuck,” I stammered. “I’m sorry, I’m *so* sorry.”

She slid to the carpeted floor leaving behind a crimson smear, her arthritic claws enveloping her face. She rocked and rolled like a turtle flipped onto its shell, and then, *without* using her arms, rose gracefully.

More laughter crept along the hall, drawing louder and closer. As I whipped around, Rebekah scurried back toward the window, abandoning her attempt to sneak up on me.

Another laugh. From over my shoulder. Now her mother had crept forward, blood dripping with every step—drip, step, drip, step. When my gaze landed on her she reversed into the bathroom, all skittish.

I gasped, my insides jumping around, and backstepped in the direction of the staircase. “What is this?”

At the very edge of the gloom, the two blonde ladies stood side-by-side. Beneath their child-like giggles, an alarm wailed at the back of my mind. Those kids at the park, hadn’t their faces been masked by their hands? And that crying lady, her too.

Downstairs, deep in the bowels of the house, a porcelain lamp crashed against the floor. What the hell was going on?

My head turned from the stairs back toward the ladies, who had come within arm’s reach. Muted ‘tee-hees’ tapered off as Becks dashed into our bedroom while my mother-in-law cowered behind a fern which barely concealed her right leg.

Whether this was a sick way of getting revenge on me for being a crappy husband or something more sinister, I just wanted away from that damn house, quick. In a wild flurry, I scrambled a dozen or so paces until the upstairs landing opened around me.

The second my foot landed on the top step, chills raced along my spine. Because a head poking out sideways past the bottom banister quickly got reeled away. Beneath my brother-in-law’s balding head, his squat fingers had been interlocked.

Behind me, the narrow hall vomited up Becks and Mumsy who dove for cover behind a vase and a storage cupboard, respectively. Each time my gaze switched between the women and Darren, those laughs started up again, and everybody crept forward, moving like a slideshow, in a series of still images. My wife’s family had suffocated any hope of escape.

On unsteady legs, I retreated halfway down the steps, my eyes never settling in one place for more than a single second. Wicked laughter closed in from both directions, climbing in volume as the figures approached. This unbearable sense I couldn’t let them get any closer overcame me, so I swung my lower half over the banister and let myself drop down.

I scrambled toward the front door, snatching my car keys off the side table along the way, and fumbled with the lock. All the palm sweat made my hands so slippery the mechanism wouldn’t twist around.

From behind, I heard cackles drew louder and closer, accompanied by a flurry of footsteps. Warm breaths engulfed the back of my neck and made my arm hairs stand to attention. I gritted my jaw, tight. Finally the lock clicked. I bolted through the entrance, along the driveway.

Up and down the street, high, wavering screams rang out as individuals who had their faces covered snuck up on those who didn’t, illuminated only by cones of light thrown across the pavement by lampposts framing the road. Despite their eyes being covered, many seemed to sense my presence, converging on my location as I stood there surveying all this, my feet rooted on the spot.

What finally startled me alert was a shriek from next door. Facing away from me, the neighbour lady whose name I never remembered had popped up from behind a hedge with her hands up over her skull like a set of antlers. By her feet, sprawled across the garden on his elbows and knees and bug-eyed with terror, her teenage son looked up at his mother’s exposed face and shrieked. His hands shot up and clamped over his head, but for a fraction of a second, I caught sight of the face underneath. I never got a good look, and for that I'm grateful. The features appeared to be hideously elongating, though, becoming engulfed by shadows, undetectable.

The kid’s body went wild with spasms, eased, and then he rose without using his arms.

Together, he and his mother rotated towards me, their faces hidden.

More chuckles. I glanced over as my dearly beloved and her family peeked out from the cracks alongside the opened door.

The mother and son got set laughing now. A quick check over my shoulder, and they both dropped vertically beneath the rose bushes, already at my garden’s outer edge.

In a single heartbeat, I scrambled inside the car.

As the engine sputtered to life, figures closed in from all sides, hunched low. Ten, no, fifteen. Male and female, young and old, all boxing me in, quietly tittering away. Shit.

Beyond the driver’s side window, Rebekah popped up, her skull inches from the glass. As the corner of my eye landed on her, those delicate hands unlaced, peeling apart like a budding flower. At the very last second, I squeezed my eyes shut.

“PEEKABOO.” Her voice was wreathed in static, a violent hiss. Others echoed the call, and soon the cabin resounded with a chorus of, “Peekaboo, peekaboo, peekaboo.”

Those chants didn’t even register as human. They rattled the glass, got inside my skull, and even made the pressure inside my inner ear change, the way you’d expect on a plane battling turbulence.

Still blind, I slammed the vehicle into reverse. The back wheels lurched up, then down, followed closely by the front. Guided by muscle memory, I swung the car around in the middle of the street, sending the herd scattering like bowling pins judging by the rapid succession of heavy thuds, and then slipped into first gear. Only after ten seconds did I peel my left eye open, just a slither.

In the rearview mirror, an elderly man’s innards hung from a hole in his stomach, dangling in pink, wormy loops. Despite this, his hands stayed glued to his head, like all the others.

I sped down the street, thirty miles over the limit, passing neighbours fleeing from ‘gigglers’ who hunched behind bins and lampposts. At the next shout of ‘Peekaboo’, my eyes snapped shut on instinct.

My mouth was filled with warm, sticky blood when I woke up, and my nose all swollen.

Before I could kick the dented side-door open, laughter rang out from around the car. Eyes closed, I tried to start the engine. It sputtered along for a few seconds before dying with a little rasp.

I’m sprawled across the backseat now, afraid to even glance up. Each time I move, there’s another, “Peekaboo.”

Although I’m no doctor, I think my vision is blurred with a possible concussion. The emergency services aren’t answering my calls, the line just keeps ringing out. I’m still not sure what’s going on, and I’m not sure what to do, besides keep trying for the police.

All I know for certain is, if I ever see my [wife’s beautiful face again, it’ll be too soon…](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
