My name is Markus. I'm 17 years old, and ive been having odd dreams everyday for a few years now.  


It all started when I was about 12 years old. It was a Saturday night. My mother was cooking dinner for us while I watched Spongebob on my TV. It was a normal night. My Father came home late again, and my mother greeted him as he opened the door. I felt a presence behind me as my father walked past. I looked over at the dark staircase and looked away again when i verified that nobody was there.  
The TV cut to static. I looked over to my  parents. They seemed to be unbothered by the static. As I looked back at the tv I saw myself staring at the tv.   


I was confused. I thought that there was a camera built into the tv and that I accidentally turned it on.   
I looked behind me on the tv and saw a pair of glowing eyes, staring right at me. I looked behind me again to find nobody on the staircase. I looked back at the tv and saw the figure right behind me next to the couch. My heart sank. All i could do was watch the figure stare at me. Eventually, after a few minutes, or what felt like hours, my mother called me for dinner. I occasionally looked at the tv to find the figure sitting in the couch, looking at me.  


After dinner, I forgot about the figure. I guess I thought I was just daydreaming again. Spongebob was playing on the Tv again, as if nothing ever happened. Later that night, when I was about to go to bed I remembered what happened on the TV. I felt a chill down my spine as I realised I wasnt daydreaming. I somehow knew that all of that actually happened. I went to sleep that night afraid. I had a nightmare later that night of the figure watching over me as I slept.  


I told my mother about the dream. She had a frightened look on her face, as if she witnessed somebody get murdered. That night she told me to sleep with her. That same night i had another Nightmare. In this nightmare, i would wake up  on 1 of 3 chairs. The chair on my left had a mirror sitting on it, along with the right chair. I would always be in my attic for some reason. There was a candles lit infront of me. There was a bucket and mug of water on the floor. The large fan on the roof was on. In my hands was an old teddy bear i would not let go of when i was about 5 years old. My mom gave it to a charity once i was old enough to stop sleeping with teddy bears, although I never wanted to get rid of it. the bear's name was Walter. When i woke up i noticed something moving in the mirrors. I tried to look in the mirror, but for some reason my body didnt let me.  All i could do was look at them in my peripheral vision. I felt a presence in the chairs. I heard people talking very vividly, but i couldnt hear it properly because of the fan. For some reason the fan was really, really loud. Like a hurricane. I would always be a bit frightened, but comfortable. I felt as if i wouldnt get hurt.  


"H-hello?" The conversing stopped.  
"is anybody here?" i asked the presence. I dont know why i just knew i could talk to the presence. It was odd. It felt like i've done it before.  
"i'm here."i heard a clear voice reply. I felt shocked from the reply. I noticed the same eyes that were staring at me in the Tv staring at me once again in both the mirrors.  


"who am i talking to?" i asked the presence.  
"yourself." replied the presence in the right.  
"the person you saw." replied the presence in the left.  


"Are you the man in the TV?"  
"The "person in the tv" is a mere illusion. An illusion meant to block you from the truth." the presence in the right said.  
"Be not afraid. We are not the person whom is looking for you. You should be afraid of fear. Fear is nothing but an emotion. emotions created by yourself so you can be aware. Awareness is merely an aspect of fear, yet fear and awareness are not the same." said the presence on the left.  


"what- what are you saying."  
"You do not need to know. Who you should know is the person behind you." said the presence on the right.  
I felt a cold hand grasp my shoulder, along with a scream before waking up. My parents were around me, i had sweat dripping from my head. My body felt limp and weak. "Mark! Mark! my mom was shouting.  
I went to the hospital shortly after that. I was having a seizure.  
After that hospital visit my parents brought me home. I didnt want to tell them about the dream i had. The night after i had the same dream. It was continued from the previous dream.  


"What? Im here again! Why am i here again?" i asked the presence. "youre here because you want to be." said the presence on the right. "I dont want to be here!"   
"Then leave. Simply wake up." the presence on the left said.  
They continued with their conversation before i felt a hand pull me by the shoulder, and suddenly I was awake. It was morning.   


Now, i wont be explaining what happened in every single dream for 5 years, so i'll give you a brief description of what happened in most dreams.  


Every night id wake up in the chair while the presences were having conversations, theyd always welcome me back. we'd converse. Id wake up. It was too bad, but after 2 years of having these dreams... They got more terrifying.  


The presences would be aggressive, and mad at me. i'd hear screaming and shouting as they conversed. While they were screaming i'd gesture a cross over myself and i'd wake up having a seizure. It's been like that for 3 years now. I dont know how to make it stop. Anybody have some advice?
