I had been working at the Greywood National Park for ten years. I loved my job and the serenity that the park offered. The sound of birds whispering and chirping about their day filled my head as I watched the sun rise over the mountains and turned the pink clouds into a brilliant orange. Also, I knew every inch of the park like the back of my hand.  
  
As a park ranger, I've seen and heard a lot of strange things over the years. Some of them are hard to explain, and others are downright spooky. But it's all part of the job, and I've learned to take it in stride.  
  
One of the strangest stories I've heard happened a few years ago. A group of hikers had gone missing in the woods, and we launched a massive search and rescue operation. We combed the forest for days, but we couldn't find any trace of them. It was like they had vanished into thin air.  
  
Then, a week later, one of the hikers stumbled out of the woods. He was disoriented and confused, and he kept muttering about how the forest had "swallowed them up." We took him to the hospital, and he eventually recovered, but he never spoke about what had happened in the woods.  
  
Another odd occurrence happened when a group of campers reported seeing strange lights in the sky. They described them as bright orbs that seemed to move in a pattern. We investigated, but we couldn't find any evidence of a UFO or anything like that. But the campers were so convinced that they had seen something otherworldly that they refused to stay in the park any longer.  
  
However, there was one area that I always avoided â€“ the Whispering Woods, a dense and dark part of the forest where people claimed to hear strange whispers at night.  
  
It was a patch of forest where the trees grew close together and tangled branches blocked out most of the light from the moon. The canopy was so thick that it housed a complete layer of epiphytes, plants that grow in trees but never touch the ground. In some places hanging vines stretched from tree to tree and gave a glimpse through the treetops, like ropes holding an invisible net up high. I hated to think about what might be lurking in the dark there.  
  
Some said it was ghosts whispering, while others said it was the restless spirits of trees that had been felled in a great storm many years ago. Whatever the case, I never went near it.  
  
One day, I was on my routine patrol in the drizzly, foggy forest. The musty scent of old leaves and damp soil leaked into the air as I brushed past the nameless trees. A low droning grew louder, and I spotted a silhouette through the mist. It took me several moments to adjust my vision and make out that it was an elk.  
  
Suddenly, I came across a group of terrified hikers. They were huddled together, their faces were pale, and their eyes wide with fear. They were trembling and clutching at each other, their bodies tense and braced as if expecting an attack. Their clothes were disheveled and streaked with dirt and sweat, and their breathing was shallow and rapid.  
  
They claimed that they had ventured into the Whispering Woods and had heard eerie voices, urging them to go deeper into the forest. The hikers had barely made it out, and their pale faces were enough for me to take their claims seriously.  
  
"Officer, thank goodness you're here. We heard these strange voices in the woods, and we don't know what to do," he said, his voice quivering with fear.  
  
I nodded, trying to calm them down. "Can you tell me more about the voices you heard?"  
  
Another hiker, a woman with short, curly hair, spoke up.  
  
"They were like whispers, you know? But they were so clear, and they seemed to be coming from all around us. We couldn't understand what they were saying, but it was like they were urging us to go deeper into the woods."  
  
I frowned, taking mental notes. "Did you see anything unusual in the forest?"  
  
The hikers shook their heads in unison. "No, nothing. But the trees seemed to be closing in on us, and we felt like we were being watched," said another hiker, a young man with a backpack.  
  
I scanned the area, looking for any signs of danger.  
  
"Alright, just follow the path and leave the woods for now," I said and the group did so.  
  
As the sun began to set, I decided to investigate the woods and put an end to this mystery. I ventured into the forest with a flashlight and walkie-talkie in hand. The sun's light peeked through the canopy of trees, barely touching the ground and leaving everything in a deep shade. The shadows stretched out like tendrils, reaching into the distance. Mist loomed in the air, making the trees seem bigger and more imposing.  
  
The wind picked up, howling softly and rustling the leaves of the trees as if beckoning me forward. A strange stillness hung in the air as if something hidden waited in the shadows. In the distance, I heard faint whispers barely audible on the wind.  
  
As I was getting deeper, the air became colder and I tried to ignore the chill that ran down my spine.  
  
Then I stopped in the middle of a small clearing and started to listen. The place was bathed in a deep and eerie darkness, the moonlight filtering in through the canopy of trees. The shadows of the trees stretched out like tendrils, reaching deep into the darkness. The mist loomed in the air, making the trees seem bigger and more imposing. The ground was damp and muddy, littered with pine needles and fallen branches.  
  
A hush crept through the night air, interrupted only by the soft chirping of crickets and the occasional croak of a frog. The breeze rustled through the leaves of the surrounding trees and an owl hooted in the distance.  
  
Then I started hearing them. But they did not come from the forest, they were in my head. They were low, almost inaudible, yet highly unsettling. It's as if a thousand tiny voices were speaking at once, but all at once. Every syllable was whispered in an otherworldly tongue, full of unknown sounds and unfamiliar syllables. It felt like a cacophony of unearthly sounds that reverberated through my mind.  
  
Then I could make out a sentence.  
  
"Go away!"  
  
As I stood there, the ominous tone of the words sent an immediate shiver down my spine. It felt like someone or something was warning me of an impending danger, and my mind quickly processed the potential risks of staying in the area any longer.  
  
Without a moment's hesitation, I turned on my heels and ran away, out from the forest. Adrenaline coursed through my veins, fueling my quick escape as every step felt like a matter of life or death. I could sense the presence of an unseen danger lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced with every passing moment.  
  
The dense underbrush and tangled branches seemed to conspire against me, but I pushed on, fighting my way through the obstacles in my path. My breathing became ragged, and my heart beat faster and louder as I ran for my life.  
  
Finally, I emerged from the forest, gasping for breath, and I realized that my whole body was trembling with fear. The warning had been too intense to ignore, and I was grateful that I had heeded it. I took a moment to collect myself and to calm my racing thoughts, trying to make sense of what had just happened in the depths of the foreboding forest.  
  
"What the hell was it?" I muttered to myself in the comforting safety of my car while driving home 20 miles away.  
  
When I returned home, no matter how hard I tried, the memory of the foreboding whispers still lingered in my mind. Those voices were enough to keep me awake late into the night, my thoughts filled with dread and confusion as to what had happened in the forest.  
  
I decided to research the area in an effort to uncover the source of the mysterious whispers. I scoured historic records and digital newspaper clippings, hoping to find some evidence of what could have been lurking in that forest. What I found were only reports of people hearing the whispers. Also, I did find news articles with evidence of disappearances and strange sightings, but I was not sure if they were relevant or not; the thing is, those reports were from different parts of the forest each year. I was looking for a pattern but there was nothing that could explain what had caused those whispers. Although I didn't discover any conclusive explanation for the phenomenon I heard in the forest that night, I could say with certainty that there was something strange lurking beneath its surface.  
  
I did not understand it yet.  
  
The next day, I was so scared that I called in sick to work. I needed a rest, to put myself together and process the events of the previous night.  
  
I looked out of the window. The sky was a deep shade of grey, with heavy clouds that blotted out the sun and concealed any hint of blue in their shadows. Rain poured down in sheets, puddles forming in low-lying areas and overflowing into the streets. The world outside was blurry and distorted, an endless landscape of grey and mist.  
  
The rain tapped heavily outside like a symphony of drums, creating a mesmerizing rhythm. The windows were blurred with droplets, creating a static soundtrack from the raindrops hitting the glass. The wind whipped through the trees and the thunder rumbled like waves crashing against the shore, and the lightning flashed briefly like an explosion of light.  
  
I reclined on my couch and listened to the raindrops but a few minutes later, I turned on the television. Soon, a report about a forest came up as the news of the day.  
  
Huge rocks, trees, and debris were strewn across the land. The force of the landslide had upturned the entire terrain, leaving a mangled mess that stretched for miles. Heavy boulders have come crashing down from the mountain and there is destruction everywhere. Huge cracks had formed in the ground and deep ravines had been created as far as the eye could see. Pools of muddy water reflected the dull sky, and a thick haze hung in the air.  
  
Then I realized it was the forest, where I had been working for years. The forest was completely destroyed by a landslide.  
  
"Good morning. We begin this morning with a breaking news story. A massive landslide has struck Greywood National Park, causing extensive damage and destruction." the reporter said.  
  
People were walking around, carrying equipment and searching for survivors.  
  
"The landslide occurred early this morning, and it has completely destroyed the park. There are no reported fatalities at this time, but many people are missing. The cause of the landslide is currently unknown, but officials say that recent heavy rainfall may have played a role. The park was a popular destination for hikers, nature enthusiasts, and tourists. It is estimated that millions of dollars in damage have been done to the park's infrastructure and facilities."  
  
"This is a tragedy. The national park forest was a place of natural beauty, and now it's gone. I can't believe it," a local resident said to the reporter.  
  
"Recovery efforts are underway, and emergency services are on the scene. However, the park is expected to remain closed for an indefinite period. Our thoughts are with those who have been affected by this disaster," the reporter finished his news report.  
  
I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and my jaw hung open in disbelief. Suddenly, everything clicked into place.  
  
The whispers were not meant to cause harm. They had been trying to warn us all this time. The forest seemed to know its death was coming.
