This all started when we moved into an old 1973 farmhouse when I was sixteen.

Though "farmhouse" may conjure images of a large wooden structure with a sprawling porch, this house was anything but that. It was a small, pale-yellow thing with two bedrooms and one bathroom. I thought it looked rather quaint. But from the 70's it was definitely. The previous owners hadn't updated much in the \~45 years they lived there. Most of the walls were covered in dark wood paneling that cut off about a foot from the pale ceiling. All fixtures were domed things emitting dim yellow light. There were double ovens in the kitchen, but each were half the size of a oven today. Everything was carpeted. Everything. Even the bathrooms.

We'd started some light renovations, namely, painting the living room paneling white, which had opened the space up. Though rest of the house remained cramped and dark. The bedrooms were small, the hallway had the same dark paneling and felt shrunken, like your shoulders could brush both sides.

The second bedroom in particular was uncanny. Located at the end of the hallway on the left, it had been left there entirely intact. The rest of the house was -- as would be expected -- entirely void of furniture or any belongings from the previous owners. But the second bedroom wasn't. The items in the bedroom weren't personal or anything, in fact, the room felt entirely disconcerting in it's inoffensiveness -- cream comforter, white curtains, dingy yellow lamp, and crammed with dark furniture which consisted of an armoire, two nightstands, and a elaborately carved bedframe. The pieces were too large for the space with one of the nightstands overlapping the closet door and the armoire only about a foot-and-a-half from the end of the footboard. I figured that it had been a guest bedroom. The carpet was free of stains and had no impressions from constant foot traffic. There was no heavy, recognizable scent like that of more regularly used rooms in the house -- such the scent of Cherry Blossom perfume permanently etched into the bathroom grout or grease and garlic from the kitchen.

My parents were confused, because the previous owners hadn't said they were leaving an entire furniture set behind. They figured due to the size and weight of the pieces the owners had simply left them there rather than deal with moving them.

Due to an error in truck routing and the scheduling of my father's new job, we had to move in about a week-and-a-half before the moving trucks would arrive with all our things. So, we sat on folding chairs and ate chilli dogs off paper plates with plastic forks in our laps. My parents slept on a mattress in the would-be master bedroom. I, on the other hand, was lucky to get the second bedroom. We planned to work on selling the pieces on Facebook Marketplace or something, they were heavy with old timey brass locks on the drawers and the large door of the armoire, and surely worth a pretty penny. Though the set was hardly flying off the shelves -- the pieces were locked up tight and the keys nowhere to be found -- but in the meantime the bed was perfectly fine to sleep on.

\*\*\*

So, I slept there feeling distinctly like a guest in my new home.

Strange events happened immediately.

\*\*\*

When I was little, I would wake up in the middle of the night. I could never fall back asleep immediately and would sit there for hours, admiring the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling and the butterfly nightlight by my bed. The first night in that 1973 farmhouse, there were no stars or butterflies and the room was completely pitch black when I woke. The house was silent and my dad wasn't snoring (which was odd, now that I think about it. Dad sounded like a freight train when he slept).

The bright light of my phone said 2:17 AM. I sighed and flopped myself back into bed, preparing myself for several long nights of poor sleep due to the newness of the space. That's when all Hell broke loose.

Screaming and banging sliced through the quiet, my heart leaped in my chest and I could feel it beating hard against my ribs. The noise was ringing in my ears like a cymbal. I jumped out of bed and flipped on the lamp; it's dingy little light streaked shadows across the room.

"Mom?" I yelled, my hindbrain leaping to an intruder or fire, "Ma? Shit, what's going on?"

I heard no response, the screaming continued.

"What's happening? Mom? Dad?"

Nothing.

I was torn, if it was a fire or I should try to get out of the house, but if it was an intruder I... I was scared and didn't want to confront them. Nevertheless, I steeled myself to sprint out the hallway and out the front door. If it was something serious I would be out of the house, if it wasn't I would take the ensuing laughter with dignity.

Just as my hand touched the doorknob, it hit me. That God-awful noise wasn't coming from the rest of the house, and it wasn't just white noise screaming.

It was coming from the armoire, and it sounded like pleading.

I forced myself to speak, "H- hello?"

The noise abruptly stopped and the silence was deafening. Crying took it's place.

"Please... please let me out. Please. I'm sorry I made a messssssss..."

The human mind always tries to find logical explanations for even the most bizarre scenarios. Occam's Razor. Hear hooves? Think horses not zebras and all that. For me, trying to explain this situation involved the ludicrous thought that a little girl had broken into our house, somehow climbed into the armoire, locked herself in, and hadn't make a single peep for at least the two straight days we had inhabited the house full-time. But that seems to be what happened.

What had before been blind-animal fear, now transferred to a whole new kind of panic.

"H- holy fuck! Shit, sorry-- oh fuck, honey, how long you been there?"

"Foreveerrrrrrrrrr."

"Can you get out? Do you have the keys?"

"Nooooo," the child sobbed, "I made a mess and they put me in the dark and they never came back. They left me alone. I'm so alooooone. Please let me out. Please, please, please..."

I pulled at the doors, leaning as much of my weight back as I felt comfortable with. While the armoire creaked, the doors did not open.

"Honey, I'm gonna get my parents. We'll call the cops and get you out--"

"NO!" The response was shrill and histrionic, "I'll get in even more troubleee and then they'll really never let me out."

This seemed bizarre to me, "Honey, I'm sorry, I don't know who put you there, but I'm getting my parents. You'll be just fine. They're real nice, they've got cookies!" I tried to make my voice cheery and excited, hoping the prospect of sweets would calm the child, but it didn't work.

A litany of nononononnopleasenopleasenononoimsorryimsorry followed me, but the second I cracked the door all noise ceased. The house was as quiet as it had been before. My parents had heard none of it.

I woke my parents and after the initial confusion my dad, humoring me as he put it, plodded to the guest bedroom in his flannel pajamas. He first jokingly asked "Is there a little girl in here?" but received no response. Dad then went about asking, "Is anyone in there, do you need help?" still no response. He turned to me.

"Steph, there isn't anything in here." He slammed his hand against the armoire doors several times. I figured the little girl would shriek with Suprise at the least, but the armoire only echoed with emptiness. "There definitely isn't anyone in here. Thing's locked up tight and has been for a while. Locks are rusted."

"Dad I heard a little girl. I talked to her. You didn't hear the screaming?"

"Steph, hon, I don't know what to tell you." Dad leaned hard against the side of the armoire and tipped it up onto it's corners. There was no sound of a body rolling or anything, really, moving in the big, locked cabinet. Dad sat it back down almost immediately with an almighty huff. "It's empty. Still a heavy son 'a bitch though."

"Dad- dad- I heard-"

"I'm going back to bed, Steph. You probably had a bad dream, or something. You used to sleepwalk as when you were little, y'know?" I did know, ma loved telling about me trying to go outside or pour orange juice all while completely dead to the world.

"Yes. Okay. Sure. " I replied, unhappy.

"Goodnight, Stephanie. I love you."

"Love you too dad," I grudgingly said, "'night."

When he shut the bedroom door, I turned to armoire. I was irritated, tired, and afraid.

"Why didn't you talk to my dad? He would have gotten you out! There's-- there's cookies! Who doesn't want cookies?"

Now I was the one to receive no response.

"Well, the human body can't survive more than three days without water. You could die, hon, you know? Do you know what that even means? You. Could. Die."

Nothing.

"Okay, well, now I'm going to bed." And I did. I never fell asleep, I felt too weird about apparently having a little girl in the armoire mere feet from where I lay. So I laid there all night long watching the dark, imposing stance of the armoire.

No sound came from it the rest of the night.

\*\*\*

I had to very quickly come to the world-crashing realization that a ghost was possessing the armoire. Because the next night at 2:17AM I was woken by screaming in the armoire while my parents remained oblivious. I talked to the child and the child talked back. She did not sound raspy or parched like someone in need of water, didn't complain of hunger. She just repeated an endless loop of pleading and crying about wanting to be let out, but remained completely opposed to anything that entailed opening the armoire.

"Honey, we could still call the cops... who put you...?"

"Nonononono, cops mean trouble I don't wanna get in trouuuuuubleeee..."

"Okay, okay, I'm sorry. My dad can get his axe and break open the door?" That one led to a full-blown histrionic meltdown.

This repeated night after night and my parents heard none of it.

The human mind always tries to find logical explanations for even the most bizarre. scenarios, but I couldn't find the login to begin with. It wasn't a physical, living little girl in the armoire. I had come to terms with that. I looked for hidden bugs or radio equipment, a PA system that could be transmitting a girl's voice to the guest room. But, then why didn't my parents hear any of it? The initial noise every night was deafening. I racked my brain for scientific explanations, but could find none.

There's that good old Sherlock quote, "Eliminate the impossible, and what is left, however improbable, must be the truth.”

So, ghosts. Yeah, I wasn't so sure at first either. Nevertheless, I became bought in rather quickly and began to, well, talk to the little ghost girl possessing the armoire in the guest bedroom of my new house. No conversation occurred until 2:17AM at night and only after the initial banshee screaming wanned away. Though any statements were usually book-ended with the girls statements I've described earlier. One night, the girls pleading to be let out turned to pleading for me to go into the armoire with her.

"It's dark in here. They left meeeeee. I'm so alone. Please please. They left me. I'm sorry. I'm so alone..."

"Hon, I... I can't really do anything..."

"You could... come in. Please? Please? Just for a moment. I would feel so much better. Please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Don't leave me alone I'm sorry..."

"The armoire is locked. I can't come in. I can't."

"You can." The little girl was stubborn and certain. "You can, I can let you."

"Not... not yet. Honey, not yet."

My heart hurt for the little girl. In life I concocted a story of some poor child locked in an armoire by her caretakers as punishment, left alone in the dark for hours, maybe even days on end. A morbid thought-- maybe she died in there and that's why she hadn't moved on? I wanted to help her. If she wouldn't get out of the armoire on her own and "pass on" then I would help her. I guess that's just some deep-seated human urge. To help a small child in distress, even if that child isn't you're own. Or a ghost.

Several more days passed. The girl continued to ask me to climb into the armoire. I refused gently each time, uncomfortable with the request but guilty at my own refusal. What if that was what the girl's spirit needed to move on? Children clutch at their parent's hands to cross the road or simply for comfort. Maybe that's what she needed. For me to take her hand and lead her out?

\*\*\*

I stayed up late in the living room one stormy night. When I looked at the clock it was 2:15AM. That ticked something in my brain and, spur of the moment, I decided to do it. It was inevitable, wasn't it?

My heart was beating wildly in my chest and sweat ran down my back. I was nervous, but oddly relieved at finally deciding to do something besides twiddle my thumbs. Thunder rolled outside as I walked down the hallway. All other doors were closed except for the second bedroom and a flash of lightning sent watery gray light clawing it's way across the carpet. I took a step forward and was terribly, terribly aware of the ensuing quiet.

I took another step. And another. The world swirled around me like I was drunk.

I expected someone to be sitting on the bed. In my mind, I had the image of a little girl sitting with her hands in her lap and a pink bow in her dark brown hair.

But nothing was there, then again, deep in my chest, I wasn't too surprised by that. Of course she wasn't there. I knew where she was.

I turned to the armoire. I gripped the brass knob and pulled. It opened easily.

I climbed in.

\*\*\*

I made sure the doors didn't latch when I closed them behind me. I thought the bedroom was pitch black and terrifying during the night, but this completely redefined my thought of what black was. It was all consuming. At least in the bedroom there was faint moonlight, but here I couldn't even see my hand in from of my face. The air reeked strongly of furniture polish and dust. My knees were crammed against my chin and my arms knocked wildly against the wood. I wanted out immediately.

I forced myself to sit there in that dark for several long minutes. It was completely silent.

When feeling around, my elbow brushed cloth. I froze. She was in there with me.

Crying started. At first it sounded like it was coming from a long tunnel, before it steadily became louder and louder until it was right in my ear.

"They left me... they left me here. They'll never let me out. Never. Never. Neveeeeeeeer." The child cried, as she had every time before.

"Shhhhh," I said, "Everything will be alright I'm here now, honey."

I felt along the wall and took a small, cold hand in mine. I shivered. It felt like death. The crying had stopped and, as I was soon to find out, the act had ended. "Come with me, honey. You're not in trouble now. We're both going to leave together."

All I heard in response was low laughter and the door clicked shut.

My heart froze in my chest. I pushed against the door.

It didn't open.

I began to frantically push against the door, trying to open it.

The tiny, cold fingers gripped my hand like a vice, and suddenly the child was shrieking into my ear, the voice first high pitched like a little girls and steadily dropping to a deep, chilling growling "YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE! YOU'RE TRAAAAAAPED IN HERE! HAHA-HAHA! TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME! WE'LL NEVER LEAVE! YOU'LL STAY HERE AND YOU'LL MAKE A MESS AND YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE! YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE! YOU'LL ROT AND MAKE A--"

I had been confident I was being rather intelligent with this whole supernatural business. The crashing realization came to me that I had made a grave error, one as old as mankind itself. Hubris. I was a sheep who had happily walked into the wolf's mouth with my neck bared.

I became hysterical, screaming and throwing my body against the doors with all the force the cramped space afforded me. I gouged at the dark wood with my nails and felt several of them come off in my hysteria, flying through the air like hot popcorn kernels.

"Open it! Open it up! Dammit, you- you motherfucker! You motherfucker!" I gasped, "You lied to me!"

The voice, calm and crooning, like a mother to her child:

"Yoooouuuuuu'rrrreeeeee traaaaaaaaaped in heeeeeere."

Now I was crying, snot and tears streaked down my face, dripped off my lips and chin.

"Let me out... Let me ouuuuuuut..."

I don't know how long I lay there crying, curled up like some sad pill bug. Resigned to my fate. Angry at myself for falling for such blatant manipulation. Eventually, though, I tired out. My face felt hot and my shirt was soaked.

A large, cold hand took mine now. It was scally and sharp claws poked into my arm.

"Come on, now, Stephanie," That low, awful chuckling, "Do you want to dance here, in the dark? That's all there is to do, twist and twirl and twist and twirl..."

"No," I said, voice trembling, "No, I can leave. I can leave. I'm leaving"

The laughter continued.

"I can leave." I repeated, more confidently now, "I'm leaving. I-- I don't know what you are. Some demon from Hell, I'd guess. But I'm leaving. You. You won't burn, sure, but you'll experience something so, so much worse. You're alone. And you'll stay alone, here, in the dark."

I turned to that deeper-than-deep darkness and demanded, "Give me the key."

Nothing but a low, long hiss in response.

"You'll give me the key." I assured "You have no power, in here. Give me the key." Rather than some terrifying creature, I envisioned a lion, declawed and neutered, with it's teeth filled down to nothing but nubbs.

"Nooooooooooooo--"

"Give me the key. Give me the key. You have it. GIVE ME THE--!"

I felt a weight in my pocket then. Reaching in, I felt it. A small key. Brass, I knew.

The demon began screaming then, cymbals in my ears. It was begging and pathetic.

"LEEEEEET MEEEEE OUUUUUUUUT! THEY LEFT ME IN HERE I'M SORRY I'M SORRY PLEASE PLEASE LEEET MEEEEEEEEEEE OUUUUUUUUUUUT! LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!"

I ignored it, feeling along the door I found the lock and inserted the key. The *kerchunk* was a bomb going off.

I pushed, hard. The doors didn't budge. I pushed harder. I could feel my biceps bulging, tendons ripping with overextension. Let me out let me out let me out endless in my ears.

The demon was screaming and I then I was screaming and I was pushing harder, my abs clenched to drive more force against the doors. Push push push. Blood pouring from my ripped nails. Screaming. And then--

\*\*\*

(There's something I need to tell you.

When I was five years old, I would wake up in the middle of the night. I could never fall back asleep immediately and would sit there for hours, admiring the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling and the butterfly nightlight by my bed.

And then I would scream.)

\*\*\*

I felt out of the armoire against the footboard with an almighty crash. Something cracked in my chest and I yelled. With the adrenaline still coursing through my vewins, I threw myself against the armoire doors and locked them. Only then did I let myself curl up in pain. Seconds later my parents burst into the room.

"Stephanie?" Mom said shocked, "Are you alright? What happened?"

"Yanking on the armoire" I gasped the lie, "Trying to get it open. It opened alright. Oh, oh God--" I clutched at my chest, "Something- something's broke."

They took me to the hospital and though I was discharged the next day, it took about a week and a half before I could breath without stabbing pain in my chest.

So, that's my crazy story about my new house. You can believe it or not, but the broken rib, six ripped-off fingernails, and muscle contusions on my arms confirm it was certainly real for me. We still live there, though I insisted we move the furniture set under the carport. I threw the key into the pond in our backyard. I also asked my parents to take it off Facebook Marketplace, making the excuse that I wanted it for when I moved into my own place, which I guess it will. It's my burden to bear now. I couldn't stand the guilt of what lived in it possibly dragging someone else into the dark.

Things are normal. I'm twenty now, and I haven't heard any voices or noises from the armoire since.

Let's hope it stays that way.
