I am in dire need of time and cannot afford to waste, I apologise for any grammatical or punctuational errors.

Hello, to whoever may be reading this, I just want you the entirety of it's contents, that's all I ask from you. My name is David, and I have exactly not even 3 days left to live. Don't feel bad, it isn't a cancer. It's something, much, much worse than that.

I want to let you know how it all started first, how I was doomed and set in stone to this *thing.*

I work as a blue-collar office worker in downtown Montreal, in Canada, and I usually receive calls as part of my job as we may communicate with different companies to do mergers, contracts, all of that bureaucratic stuff. Or I get calls from my girlfriend.

On April 1st, I knew that I may be getting prank calls so I was mentally prepared to what I could possibly get, silence, jokes, insults, etc. All that newby stuff kids or pre-teens like to do.

What happened instead, was, shocking to say the least.

When I went to work and headed to my desk, I begun to work immediately as I didn't want to waste any time that I had that I wasn't getting bombarded with calls, didn't take three minutes before I heard the telephone ring. I couldn't ignore it, so,

I answered it.

On the other line, I heard silence for a seconds, and then low, non-consecutive breaths. I waited a few more seconds before I was going to hang up, and as soon as I was putting the phone down, I hear these exact words, in a distressed, female voice.

"0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longtitude. *It* is approaching, *It* will never lose sight of you."

Before it just hung up abruptly. I get goosebumps and I feel an immense sense of dread loom over me. I attempt to brush it off as just some teen who was trying to fuck with me, try to get into my head. I wish that was the case, I wish I could've had the rest of my life to live after that.

I will ignore the rest of the day as it had nothing of significance to really mention, but the next day, is when shit made me think twice about yesterday's explanation that I made for myself.

I get another call, I pick it up, thinking it's my boss or something, but no, it's that same female voice again. Now, she said another different bunch of degrees.

I have enough at this point and decided to go to google maps to see what was the coordinates all about. I search the first pair to see it's where the prime meridian and equator intersect, nothing weird, I guess.

When I input the second set however, that's when something clicks in my head. The coordinates have changed to a lean to the northwest. I think nothing of it until I get more calls, more coordinates, and, that's when I realise:

Those coordinates are getting to closer to where I live.

How does it know where I live?

I don't have the time or brainpower to answer these questions, but, it's getting closer. Right now, it's around the Canada-United States border, I just feel like I could not wake up the next day. I've quit my job, stayed inside all the time, and have essentially given up. I don't know how to prevent this thing from coming for you, so, the only piece of advice I can give you is:

Don't pick up the phone, it'll come for you.
