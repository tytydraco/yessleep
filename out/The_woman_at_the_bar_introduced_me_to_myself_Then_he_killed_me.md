She Wasn't Supposed to Be There

It started like any other Thursday night: with that heavy, dragging feeling that came after another week of thankless shifts and the kind of white-collar monotony that chews through your soul like acid on paper. Rialto’s was my place to escape. It wasn’t fancy, but it had just the right amount of darkness, just enough background noise, and enough booze to help me forget that I had bills, aging parents, a job I didn’t care about, and a life so hollow that sometimes I felt like a ghost haunting my own apartment.

That night, the bar was quieter than usual. A couple of older men nursing beers at the end. A pair of girls giggling too loud in a booth. Some guy in a business suit passed out with his face on the bar, like some tragic punchline.

And her.

She wasn’t dressed for Rialto’s. Black leather boots polished to an obsidian shine. A long, tailored coat too clean to belong here. Even her hair was wrong—dark, sleek, and coiled like a snake ready to strike. She sat perfectly still at the far corner of the bar, drinking something deep red from a short glass. Neat. Not a hint of condensation. Had it been there before I walked in?

At first, I thought she was beautiful. Striking, maybe. Her features were sharp and symmetrical in that unsettling way people describe mannequins. But the longer I watched her, the less human she seemed. No phone. No drink refills. Not even a glance at the bartender.

Just staring.

At me.

I tried to ignore it. Turned back to my whiskey and tried to act like I hadn't just made awkward eye contact with Morticia Addams’ evil twin. But you know how it is—once something snags at your brain, it doesn’t let go. I’d take a sip, glance up. There she was. Same position. Same expression. I’d look away, wait a while. Glance again. Still there. Still staring.

I even did the thing where you pretend to look at something behind someone, just to check if maybe they’re looking past you. Nope. Her gaze was locked onto mine like she was measuring me for a coffin.

Eventually, I cracked.

I got up, walked over, and forced a casual smirk.

"Buy you a drink?"

She tilted her head, almost like she was studying how I moved. Then she said something that stopped me cold.

"I've already had one. But you should sit. We don’t have long."

I blinked.

"Do I know you?"

"Not yet. But you will. You’ll meet him soon."

I tried to laugh it off, tried to sit, even. But the moment I did, something shifted. The air. The lighting. Her face. Her eyes were wrong—too reflective, like black mirrors with no bottom.

Then she stood, drained the last of her drink, and whispered:

"When you see your smile from the outside, it'll be too late."

She walked out.

And I didn’t sleep that night. Not just because she unsettled me—but because something about her voice sounded like mine. Not an impression. Not a coincidence.

It sounded exactly like me.
