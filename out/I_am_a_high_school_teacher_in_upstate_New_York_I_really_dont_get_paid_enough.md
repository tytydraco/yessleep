I was breathing heavily, my legs pounding through the forest.
Branches slapped against my arms as I ran, heart hammering, lungs burning.

Behind me, I could hear it—something big moving fast.
When I looked over my shoulder, I saw it: a massive shadow darting between the trees, yellow eyes glowing like headlights.

A wolf.
At least, that’s what my brain told me it was.

I ran harder, but my foot caught on a root. I went down face-first into the cold dirt.
By the time I rolled over, the beast was already on top of me—

—and then I woke up.

Cold sweat.
Dark room.
The same nightmare.

I sat up, wiping my face and staring at the ceiling.
“Will these dreams ever stop?” I muttered to no one.
Knowing my luck… probably not.

I dragged myself into the bathroom.
The mirror didn’t do me any favors—pale skin, black curly hair sticking out everywhere, and the dark circles under my eyes looked worse than ever.

After getting dressed in my school uniform, I caught my own reflection again.
Yeah, I know what you’re probably thinking.

“This guy’s a student?”

Nope.
I’m a high school teacher.
A tired, underpaid, over-caffeinated high school teacher in upstate New York.

And I’m running on maybe three hours of sleep.

The drive to school was slow. Snow blanketed the streets, the kind that made your tires slide even when you were going twenty under the limit.

When I finally pulled into the parking lot, I spotted someone waving.

“Good morning, Mr. Jack!” Susie called out, walking up to me with that grin of his. “Still not getting much sleep, huh?”

I laughed awkwardly, rubbing the back of my neck.
“Yeah, you could say that.”

Susie’s one of the first people who gave me a chance here. Blonde hair, soft round eyes, dimples that make him look way too kind. The makeup helps that illusion, too.

I’ll admit—the first time I met him, I thought he was a girl.
Found out the hard way in the restroom.

“Don’t look at me like that,” I told him. “It’s just been hard lately. My mom didn’t train me for nothing.”

The words slipped out before I could stop them.
Susie frowned but didn’t say anything. Luckily, the bell rang, saving me from explaining myself.

Class went as usual—until it didn’t.

I was handing out history books when I noticed something strange.
There was one more student than normal.

At first, I thought maybe I’d just miscounted. But then I saw her.

Short bob-cut hair, deep brown.
Her breathing was… odd. Raspy, almost like a wheeze.
And when she looked up at me, I swear her tongue flicked out—
forked, like a snake’s.

I caught a glimpse of something else too.
Scales. Faint, but there. Around her neck and forearms.

I cleared my throat.
“Sorry, miss. Mind telling me your name? I don’t remember seeing you in class before.”

She pulled her scarf up a little, voice quiet.
“I’m Annabelle, sir. My mom and I just moved here. We’re… not used to the cold yet.”

I sighed. Another new student, more paperwork, more meetings.
And of course, no raise.

“I get that,” I said. “But I’ll need to talk with you and your mother soon. You’ve missed a lot of material.”

Truthfully, I wanted to help her—but I also knew better.
Whenever there’s one monster, there’s always more.

As the class went on, I noticed Annabelle’s eyes wandering.
She wasn’t paying attention to the lesson. She was watching her classmates.
Like they were prey.

When she started to lean toward a boy in the back, her mouth opening wider than it should’ve, I slammed my hand on the desk.

The sound echoed through the room like a gunshot.

“All right, class,” I said, forcing a smile, “we’re ending early today. Grab your things.”

As everyone packed up, I added, “Annabelle, stay for a minute.”

The room emptied. Silence settled.
I called her mother right away.

It took forty minutes before she showed up.
She walked in calmly, closing the door behind her.

Her hair was deep brown with a faint orange tint, tied up in a neat bun. She looked perfectly normal—until she heard my last name.

Her face changed.

Her lower half began to shimmer, shifting, scales replacing skin.
That’s when I realized what I was dealing with.

A Naga.

Half-human, half-snake. Shapeshifters. Dangerous.

She hissed and lunged. I barely dodged, and she crashed into the wall hard enough to leave a dent—there went part of my paycheck.

She came again, fangs bared.
I caught her by the neck, holding her back as she struggled, her venomous teeth inches from my face.

Then—voices. Footsteps in the hall.

We both froze.

Slowly, she shifted back, panting.
“I don’t know what a hunter like you is doing here,” she said quietly, “but my daughter and I haven’t hurt anyone. We just came here to live… with her father.”

I looked at her like she was insane. There was no way a monster didn’t hurt someone. I should have gone in hard—done what hunters do—but I didn’t. I went against what they were.

I rubbed my forehead softly. Three hours of sleep. My head throbbed. “Let’s say I believe you—say you’re some friendly monster just trying to live with her husband or whatever he is. Why put a monster child in a school of humans? Doesn’t that seem irresponsible? Dangerous for any of the kids?” The thought of some snot-nosed brat getting hurt made my blood boil.

She stared at me like I’d grown a second head, like she expected me to finish them both off then and there. Maybe that was a safe assumption. I had planned on it. Change of plans, I guess… for now.

“Do you really think there are schools for monsters?” she said. “It’s not like we can build our own buildings just for our species. That’s why we shifters learned to blend in. I would’ve expected hunters studying us for hundreds of years to know that. But I guess I expected too much from humans.” The last part came out with a hiss—poison in the voice, literal or not.

“All right, fine, you make a fair point,” I said. “But your daughter did try eating another kid. I can’t just let that slide. I can’t take you both out here where anyone can see, and I can’t let her eat the other students.”

The two of them looked nervous. The mother—August, I’d learn—was a very serious woman and a mother who would bite someone's head off literally.

I thought for a long second, looking at both of them. “…So how about this: I’ll tutor your daughter. Teach her how to behave around humans. How to blend.” My voice hardened. “I’m not thrilled about it. If either of you causes trouble, I will not hesitate.”

I went to my desk and took a sip of black coffee. If the other hunters found out I was sparing them—if they knew I hadn’t dealt with them—my head would be on a pike. That thought was always close. Hunters run in the family; it’s in the blood. You don’t get out of it. I’d been told that since I was a kid. The Hemmings name carries weight—old scars, older promises. Some nights that legacy sits heavy behind my teeth. I didn’t say that aloud.

August hesitated, then nodded. “Fine. Teach her only what she needs. Don’t fill her head with lies that monsters must be destroyed because of what we are.”

I almost barked at her—there are reasons hunters do what they do—but the bell for the next class was ringing and we couldn’t keep going. I adjusted my tie and forced my face back into the mask.

“Fine. I promise not to teach anything hunter-related. Only what she needs for school.”

I mentally cataloged what else I had to do. Nightwork. That was the word I used at home: investigating, watching, making sure there weren’t more hiding in plain sight. I had a job to do after dark. That was when the real teeth of the world showed.

I tried to cover the dent in the wall with some paint from the supply closet and walked them both out to the door. I closed it behind them and sat back at my desk. I closed my eyes for a beat and let the silence in.

There were a lot of unsaid things—about August, about Annabelle, and about me. The agreement would buy them time. It would buy me something too: a way to watch, to learn, to prepare.

The hunters in my family would not have approved. They were the kind of people who kept lists, kept trophies, kept blood at the ready. They believed in endings. I had always believed in endings, too, but lately I kept feeling like I was straddling two sides of a knife. Sometimes the hair on my forearms would rise for no reason; sometimes my jaw ached as if I’d been running all night. I told myself it was stress. That was easier.

The door to the classroom stayed closed for a long time after they left. When I finally opened it, the hallway was empty and the dent in the wall looked less noticeable in the fluorescent light. I made a note in my planner: tutor Annabelle, meet mother, check dent repair cost, check night patrol routes.

I wrote the last line in the back of my head—this isn’t over. This was only the beginning.
