The rough rumbling of the engine and intense popping from the ignition did not wake me up. It used to, back when I cared about having a sleep schedule, but with school out and work being at 9, I saw no use in going to bed early. But the noise of the car did really annoy me, not because it was loud but because only I could hear it. I could see it too. An old R32 Skyline, jet black, windows tinted, and fast. Some days it stood as if taunting me, like it wanted me to see it, but most of the time it zoomed by before I even knew what happened. Once I tried filming it only to get a blur but I tried to use it as proof nonetheless.

 “Ehh, your camera is probably just shit. You gotta get an iPhone, man; those have like night stuff for cameras.” Jason was an idiot. A lovable guy but an idiot. Jason lived down the block; we’ve been friends since high school, and fate just had us together at every meaningful moment, sitting next to each other in class, together for group projects, and at the same university, but for some reason our fates did not align when it came to this car.

 “Jason. My phone is not that old. But you had to have heard it. It comes by every single night. It’s loud! It goes down the whole damn block.”

Jason just shrugs. “Sorry, man, no matter how many times you ask, I just don’t hear or see nothing.” I can only sigh and thank him as I settle back down. Everyone seemed oblivious to this; I even got the courage to ask my neighbors. I’m not the social type, and the neighbors only know me because of my parents. “Oh you’re Mary and Robert’s sweet son! Though you’ve gotten so big now, haven’t you?” Is how I was greeted practically every time.

One neighbor was Margret, a sweet old lady. A bit weird but nice. “Cars at night? Well, I do hear my fair share of roughhousing boys, but at 2 in the morning? I’m asleep, boyo, but if that car is as loud as you say…then sorry, I don’t hear anything.” Damn, another dead end. “Oh! Wait, my daughter has been showing me the TikToks and reels; she’s been warning me about those uhh. These fake A-I generated videos. Maybe you’ve been seeing one of those?”

 “Thanks, Miss, but no, I think this is plenty real. Thanks though.” With that, I was back on the case, all alone. My mind whisked itself into batter with theories. Was it some elaborate prank? But why? From who? Why every night for the past 2 weeks? Maybe I’m just crazy? Or is it the work of aliens? Demons? I settled with the crazy argument. Maybe it’s some advanced form of tinnitus or just a random hallucination just because my brain was weird. Well, that argument evolved into a cope. “Well. If I’m crazy enough to hallucinate cars…then I’m crazy enough to follow it. Catch it.”

What else was I going to do at 2 in the morning? Jerk off? Boring. Tonight, the plan was simple:

Get in car. 

Wait for ghost car. 

Follow ghost car. 

And that’s exactly what I did. Turns out when you’re in a red 2012 Camry, a car that easily zooms by has a much harder time zooming away from you. I grinned to myself, thinking I had outsmarted this “ghost” but then a thought hit me. Did it…want me to follow it? Did I play into its hands the whole time? In response my foot pressed harder on the car tailgating the car. There was no going back, not anymore. The tunnel vision had hit a bit too hard that I was able to ignore how dark the world around me was getting. I didn’t break eye contact with the R32’s spoiler until, from the corner of my vision, I saw a point zooming past us on the ceiling. Not a streetlight or a sign albeit I was not paying attention to those in the first place but, a large point. Then another, and another, a smaller one. All sharp like the graphite tip of a sharpened pencil.

 My foot instantly switched to the brake, the sharp stop lurching me forward only for the seatbelt to lurch me back in response. The damn R32 kept going, deeper into the inky, spiky darkness. As the adrenaline wore off, I realized how cold it really was. The hairs on my arms prickled, and my breath was visible. I took a few more breaths trying to relax and unlatch the death grip my fingers had on the steering wheel. “Hello…” I muttered to myself. Hearing my own voice made me a bit more comfortable. Then I turned my neck again, making sure it worked. I had experienced sleep paralysis on two occasions. The feeling that a single excessive move could easily snap my neck still haunts me to this day.

 My neck works. My eyes work. So does the rest of my body. I don’t turn the heat on. It’s not worth it if I’m just going to step into the cold afterwards, so instead I turn the car off and step out, the swirling darkness be damned! But my bravado lasted a few minute moments as I turned on the flashlight of my phone.

I was expecting a gooey, thriving mass, but all I got was cool, wet silence. Each step felt like I was walking on a water balloon; putting more pressure into my steps would make me pop a hole into the ground and I would sink into dark nothingness. I approached the first stalactite; the inky blackness was wet. It was water trapped in a different stream of air. It didn’t move, nor did it run. It was still. Perfectly still. My finger unconsciously reached out and poked it. It went through smoothly, a soft ripple running through the entire spike. 

An unconscious smack of my lips reminded me I was thirsty. Really thirsty, in fact. An animalistic desire rippled through my head. My body was a desert, and in front of me was the first rainfall in decades. I fell to my knees as my mouth found the small tip of the spike; like a newborn ripped away from the nutrients coming from the umbilical cord desiring mother’s milk to fill the void, I sucked. 

Water. Water. This. This is water. Something pure, something refreshing, something that filled your soul with utter bliss. One hydrogen and two oxygen in their purest form. This was water. 

I gulped and gulped and gulped and gulped and gulped and gulped…and wait. Gulp. No more. Gulp. I feel good. Gulp. No, I feel amazing. I don’t need more. Gulp. But I could not stop. It felt as if I had popped a hole in earth’s vast endless ocean and all its water was rushing into my mouth.

 The different stream of air had trapped me, and now I was a stalactite, one with the inky water. I had accepted my fate until a deep bellowing groan shook the entire tunnel. A whale? The water stopped, and I ripped myself free, coughing and vomiting back up what felt like gallons of liquid with the consistency of ink. 

Silence returned except for my coughs, gasping breaths, and spitting. Another wave of adrenaline hit me as the tunnel shook; the groan was louder and closer? It felt like it was coming from everywhere. My phone lay beside me, dead but thankfully dry. It didn’t matter at this point. All I knew was that I had to go. My movements had me feeling like an Olympic sprinter only to punish me by making me feel like I had eaten nothing but pounds of lard. Whiplash between a cheetah and a slug every few steps.

The car was right where it had been left. Well, even if it had moved, the collective inky darkness made it impossible to tell. All I knew was that it was shaped like a car. It took a few tries to get inside and even more tries to get the car started. I had become a sloth; each flex, each exertion of force, and each pull felt like it would take ages. I would attempt to jam the key into the hole only to watch myself miss yet be unable to pull away until the key stabbed the car. “Fuck!”

Key in. But I didn’t know if I was going to escape, I just had to drive. I fumbled the pedals. It felt like I had three feet, it was cramped and uncomfortable and it took too long to make the car go. But once it moved it wouldn’t stop. Perfect. In what felt like an adrenaline charged drunken stupor I watched the speedometer grow higher and higher as the inky spikes in the dark grew more and more blurry; each breath held a prayer to freedom. It only took a blink for me to find myself speeding down the open road once again, seeing the familiar sight of my street. As I pressed my foot down on the brake, I found…a third pedal. Brake…acceleration…and was this? I looked around me. This was not my car.

My brain went into overdrive. Clutch. A manual, it had to be. I needed the neutral position for the stick. I racked my brain on how to park a type of car I only dreamed of owning. A few jumps and lurches later I stopped and immediately got out. A jet black R32 Skyline. I took 4 laps around the car, with the occasional knock on the hood or kick on the tire to reinforce how this was real. The car had my plates too. What happened in that darkness? How long was I even there for? The time of day looked the same as when I had left. Time had never once entered my thoughts inside that dark cave. All I found myself doing was driving home. It took a bit. But keeping the car in the first gear and remembering whatever knowledge I had about manuals made it so I actually did get home. 

Instantly I got into my bed and went to sleep. It felt like I could do nothing else. The next few days went by in a blur. It turns out I had gotten out of that tunnel three days later at 3 AM. Those blurry days turned to weeks. No one commented on my new car, hell no one even noticed I was missing. I had even been paid for the days I was missing from work. I had gotten used to it pretty quickly as the repetitive aspect of living took over. Life returned to normal. Though drinking water never felt as satisfying as it once did.

Recently a new family moved into the neighborhood. They’re good people, friendly and warm. They have two kids, two boys that have thrown plenty of balls into my yard. I even played with them sometimes if I had spare time. I never minded it, of course, but what I did mind was when one day they asked something.

“Hey, Mister Daniel. Have you seen the car at night?”

 “Yeah, me and Owen have been hearing it every night! It’s red and really fast!”

“Yea yea! It only comes at night too.”

I instinctively said, “No. You sure you’re not having funny dreams?”

Both of the kids looked confused and a bit hurt. “Aw, our parents said the same thing.”

It took me a moment to register what had just happened. A car…at night? A red one. Didn’t I used to own something like that? Some sort of bell was ringing deep in the crevices of my mind, but nothing ever came.
