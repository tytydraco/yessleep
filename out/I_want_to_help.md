Dear gentlepeople. I've spent a significant amount of time on this subreddit over the past couple of years. And by god have people done some stupid shit.

I am here to help, through familial relations, a knack for finding places and things I shouldn't and talents considered unnatural by some I know stuff.
And I am here to share my knowledge with you. 

All of the stories we've read here are based on the fact that reality is actually quite weak, and once it starts slipping it almost  never stops. People don't know how to stop it. I am here to hopefully teach some of the more clever ones here what to do.

First things first.
Follow the damn rules.
Almost all the run of the mill reality fuckery follows certain rules, and specific circumstances warp reality which allow some rules to lose efficacy. 

However, humans being humans, we tend to find out the new rules by trial and error (often involving some ‘better him than me’ sacrifice) and when we follow these things work out fine, giving us the list stories we are all familiar with. The best outcome is usually survival by having followed the rules. 

The way to fix a clusterfuck like this is to re-establish reality, by introducing more, stronger observers. This is difficult because situations like this tend to attract people who are already slipping down the drain and are less bound to reality than most.

Yes, the people who get in these situations are less real than most, definitely less real than me and my companions, propably not that much worse off than you unfortunately.
Your best bet is to restore your own reality simply by interacting more, crawl out of your hole and find people in normal places, whatever you do, don't go to that shady, secretive rave you've heard of and propably got invited to. I guarantee you nobody there is on the right sight of the reality collapse you're sinking into.

Go grocery shopping when it's busy, stand in line in a coffee shop during rush hour, and interact with normal people doing normal things. A sense of isolation is one of the first things you will notice before shit breaks down.

Second.
And already touched upon.
Assert your reality.
Reality is fragile, and drags things down with it.
A good example is the U.S. nowadays. It's simply too big to have enough observers everywhere in order to keep things from going to shit. Ghost towns abound where a handful of people live. If you come from one of these small towns you'll be able to tell. 

When you reach a new place, one closer to being fully real, you'll notice a number of things. The air feels fresher, breathing is like drinking that first sip of water after a long warm day
The weather feels more committed, no vague dreariness or exhaustive, lifeless heat. But cold biting rain, burning sun you feel deep in your bones, wind that buffets you instead of isolating you. You yourself will feel more aware, as if you finally woke up after a slow, early morning. Not the sudden jolt of caffeine, but actual awareness.

And you will remember, you'll remember all the little things you've failed to notice because you are slowly becoming less of an observer, less real in your dilapidated town circling the drain. 
The man without a shadow, the mother with an empty stroller. 
The lady with twins that have been the same age for years now. 
The dog that doesn't actually look like any kind of dog you've ever heard of. 
The lack of insects in the day to day, the overabundance of pests that invade your house. 
No ants in the garden, no bees in the field, flies and cockroaches in your bed and kitchen.
The childhood friend you've helped move away but who never left or returned unnoticed, failing to assert his reality in a place a few rungs up the ladder.
Who walks around blank faced and unseeing gaze, he's farther down the hole than you are, I don't think he can be salvaged.
But you just might.

Third.
Avoid slipping away, don't take the fucking night gig. The moment someone tells you. “I have a lucrative graveyardshift job, there's just some rules to follow” turn around and walk away. 
And if it's your childhood buddy with his blank stare.
Run.

When you see a building or entrance that shouldn't be, don't go in, not one step. It might seem like a small thing, after all what's one step into the darkness?
 But it's an enormous leap from a reality standpoint. It's a deliberate move downhill into obscurity and many of you have already done this at least once. 

Remember the time you woke up to piss?
How the hall was a bit longer and a bit darker? How the bathroom felt deeper, the damp smell, the sound of something keeping very still? The relief when you got back in bed beyond the emptying of a bladder? That was a threshold, and you would've been better off pissing the bed.

When you see a pair of stairs in the woods? Don't go up,  you won't get down the same place, if at all.

Accept that nature can hold a grudge, and some places are out for blood. I don't have any tips there, I don't fuck with cornfields 3 hours away from anything that matters. And I don't go into the woods to find some long forgotten forest god who went insane with age (gods are some reality fucking bullshit in and of themselves, ask me if you like, but know that curling up and dying is often the better choice).

If you feel real enough and the forest is kind to humans the woods can help, but if you are slipping? Stay out of the scary places, like all of Appalachia, Aokigahara, Hoia-Baciu.

Fourth.
Don't give up, you are a human goddammit, you are an observer and with practice you can fix this shit.
Everything out to get you is either afraid or jealous of you.
These things invariably manifest as anger, hatred and obsession. Don't allow the things that go bump in the night to lure you in, don't allow the drowned to drag you down to the depths. 

Focus on the mundane, focus on the real.
Keep reaching out, do not give in to the void, it's not calmness and rest, it's nothingness, it's lack of being. And you'll just turn into a hollow shell, all scooped out and ready to be worn by whatever the broken rules allow, fucked up and ready to mingle.

If you can, get a pet, your reality and theirs reinforces one another, two entities stand out more than one. The awareness required to take good care of your pet will make you a stronger observer.
And if you get really good and want to start kicking back? You're already 50% of the way to a familiar.

But for now?
Look around, asses how real you still are. I'm warning you, you won't like what you find. You're propably leas real than you thought. And I'm sorry,  knowing is te only way to get better. But it's also the worst way to stay hidden.

The ones that have already slipped away will become jealous. Your childhood buddy will contact you soon, don't meet up.

P.S. If you live in the Appalachians? I can't help you, all you can do is get out now. Whatever drain I was talking about? You're stuck in a fucking metaphorical whirlpool.
Seriously, fuck the Appalachians.
