The bass thudded through my bones, and the lights pulsed like a heartbeat. At first, everything felt normal—just another rave in an abandoned warehouse, the kind of night I’d been to dozens of times before. My friends and I had come in a pack, laughing and shouting over the music, but they’d drifted off into the crowd hours ago. I'd tried to follow them at first, but everyone seemed to melt together in the shifting lights, and I found myself alone.

It was fine. I didn’t mind being the sober one for once, taking it all in. Besides, it was actually kind of interesting watching everyone in their states of euphoria, moving to the beat like they were all part of some strange ritual. But as the night went on, things started to feel… off.

There was a guy stumbling past me, his eyes wild, his mouth stretched in a strange, open-mouthed grin. He muttered something under his breath, words that sounded half-formed, like he was speaking in fragments. I couldn’t catch what he was saying, but it made the hairs on my arms stand up.

As I moved deeper into the warehouse, a girl caught my eye—dancing wildly, her movements almost manic. She was facing me, her eyes locked on mine. At first, I thought it was just a coincidence, but as I tried to look away, she kept staring. No matter where I went in the room, her eyes followed me, huge and black, swallowing the light. It felt like she was peering right through me.

My phone buzzed. I pulled it out, hoping maybe one of my friends was trying to find me. But when I looked, the screen showed a message from an unknown number.

LEAVE NOW.

A chill ran down my spine. I quickly typed back, Who is this? No response. I shoved the phone back into my pocket, glancing around. The party had felt so alive, but now… there was something wrong. People weren’t dancing the same way anymore. They were swaying, yes, but slower, almost mechanical. The music seemed to thump in time with their movements, like they were all part of some synchronized nightmare.

Then the crowd parted slightly, and I saw someone collapse onto the floor. No one noticed. They just kept moving, stepping around him as he lay there, his mouth opening and closing in a silent whisper. I felt an urge to help him, so I crouched beside him.

“Hey, are you okay?” I asked, hoping he’d respond.

He didn’t look at me, just kept whispering. But as I leaned closer, I could just make out his words. “Eyes… they’re watching us.”

A surge of dread washed over me. I stumbled back, my heart pounding as I scanned the room. Faces everywhere, slack and staring, people moving like puppets, but their eyes… the eyes were wrong. Too wide, too dark, too knowing.

Then, the music stopped, cutting out mid-beat, and a voice crackled through the speakers—smooth, calm, and eerily cheerful. "Thank you all for coming to our experiment. You were the perfect subjects."

My stomach twisted. Experiment? The people around me, all of them staring blankly, twitching and whispering in eerie unison. The sound was low, almost like chanting, filling the space in a way that clawed at my sanity. I felt trapped, boxed in by their glassy-eyed faces, each one as blank as the next.

Frantically, I yanked out my phone, ready to call for help. But before I could open the screen, another message popped up.

YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO LEAVE.

I stared at the words, my breath catching in my throat. Then, the realization hit me—the message was from my own number.

I felt the walls closing in, the locked warehouse doors towering over me like prison bars, and the people—those empty, staring people—started moving toward me, closing the gap between us. My own reflection in the phone screen looked just as empty as theirs, and with a sinking heart, I knew what they all did.


They’d let themselves go. Given themselves over completely to whatever this… experiment was. Whatever they’d taken, whatever trance they were in—it was more than just a high. They weren’t just intoxicated or altered; they were part of something larger, something that had taken their minds and stripped them down to empty vessels. I realized with dawning horror that they weren’t just staring—they were waiting.

Waiting for me.

The people around me weren’t just random ravers lost in a drug-fueled haze; they were participants, willing or not, in some kind of horrific psychological test. And now that I was fully aware, fully sober, I understood: I was the final subject, the last one resisting. All of them had given in, one by one, until I was the only mind left that was still my own.

I looked back down at my phone, at the message from my own number. YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO LEAVE.

My heart hammered as the crowd closed in, their blank faces contorting into something almost... expectant. I realized they weren’t just a part of the experiment. They were the experiment.

And in this moment, as their empty eyes bore into me, I understood their final test. The voice crackled back over the speakers, almost soothingly.

"Will you join them, or will you resist?"

The choice was mine—but so was the price. I could let myself fall into the same mindless rhythm as them, surrendering whatever control I had left. Or I could resist and become a target, the last thread to be cut.

And as the crowd pressed closer, chanting softly in unison, I felt the terrifying weight of that decision. I realized they hadn’t let themselves go. They’d been taken. And if I didn’t find a way out, they would take me too.

The crowd pressed closer, their faces twisted with expectation, their whispers rising, forming a single, chilling phrase:

"Join us. Join us. Join us."

I stumbled back, desperate, eyes darting toward the locked doors, the blackened windows, any possible escape. But there was nowhere to go. They were all around me, a wall of empty faces and twitching bodies, closing in, pressing against me like a human vice. Their eyes, glassy and dark, were now fixed on me, drilling into my mind, and I felt my own sense of self start to slip under the weight of their gaze.

"Will you join them, or will you resist?" The voice repeated over the speakers, calm, even amused. It was as if it already knew my answer.

My hands shook as I looked down at my phone, the final message from my own number glowing up at me: YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO LEAVE.

The words flickered and blurred on the screen, twisting into a new message:

WELCOME TO THE EXPERIMENT.

In that instant, a chilling realization hit me: I hadn’t just wandered into a trap—I was its centerpiece. The experiment was about breaking minds, stripping them down to nothingness, one by one. I was the last one left to break, the last subject to lose myself to the darkness that had consumed everyone else. And now, they were waiting for me to give in.

Suddenly, I felt an icy chill creep up my spine, and a strange fog settled over my mind. My thoughts dulled, and my heartbeat slowed, syncing with the bass that thrummed through the walls, into my veins, into my brain. The whispers grew louder, drowning out everything else until they were all I could hear.

"Join us. Join us. Join us."

I tried to resist, to cling to my last shred of sanity, but it was slipping, like water through my fingers. I could feel myself fading, my sense of self dissolving into the darkness, joining the void that surrounded me.

And then, finally, I felt it. That terrifying surrender. My mind fractured, split, and all I could see were their faces, their empty, expectant faces, welcoming me into the dark.

The last thing I heard before my own voice joined the whispers was that calm, eerie voice over the speakers, its words sealing my fate:

"Thank you for participating. The experiment is complete."
