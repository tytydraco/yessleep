I was visiting a friend who was living on the third floor of Notchwood Arms Apartments when I heard first heard the sound. A ceaseless thudding rang through my ears. My friend swore he didn’t hear anything, but it was relentless. The sound distracted me from our conversation so much that I had to find the source, so I left my comrade to explore the building.

After a look around, I found a set of stairs leading to the fourth floor. The sound seemed to echo down these stairs and into my ears. The stairs looked like they hadn’t been kept in a decade or more, but my curiosity had gotten the better of me and I had to ascend them.

I found myself on the fourth floor and at the opposite end of the hallway from the noise. As I slowly made my way down the corridor; its lights flickering like a fluorescent lightning storm, a horrendous smell seemed to creep from underneath the doors and out of the walls.

The smell reminded me of my grandfather. It was a nauseating mix of cigarette smoke, beer, and unwashed bodies. It was a thick smell with an iron tinge that hung in my nostrils. The smell was a wall that I couldn’t get past even if I tried holding my breath. I could taste the dirt and the iron and other things that my mind couldn’t (or wouldn’t) identify.

The sound I’d heard a floor down came from the end of this hallway. It lay past a dozen rotting doors with chipped paint and secrets they kept well-guarded. It lay past the moldy, musty brown carpet that seemed as solid as quicksand on a rainy day and had a distinct smell of its own.

The sound was almost mechanical, a melodic thumping with no echo. It was a muffled thud with an occasional stop every few seconds. It was the pause that told me it was a human performing the mystery task that I had become so curious about.

Thud…thud…thud. It sounded like wood was breaking. Thud…I noticed a wet sound as I approached the end of the hallway. The sound was not very loud but audible just under the rhythmic impact like a secret buried between the lines of a book. The secondary sound reminded me of walking through thick mud as a child and the slurping noise my feet would make as I pulled them out of the quagmire. I wasn’t sure what was producing that disturbance and part of my mind didn’t want to know.

I stopped my slow, steady creep midway down the decaying hallway. I didn’t know, exactly, why I was being so quiet, but I seem to recall the same feeling I had when I was a child, and I would sneak out of my bed to play during naptime. I knew I shouldn’t being doing this. I knew that, if I got caught, there would be hell to pay. I was too busy thinking about repercussions than watching where I should step. So, when I began walking again, I stumbled.

I don’t know if it was bad luck or just a lump in the carpet, but I tripped and landed face down in the carpet. The taste of ancient, unkempt carpet would have been enough to make me gag and vomit, but everything was driven from my mind when I heard the noise stop.

I don’t know if I lay on the floor for a second or an hour but the terror of being found in such a prone position by the unknown person or persons was enough to make me wish I had been invisible. I pressed my face into the filthy carpet wishing that the noise would resume and I could have my security back.

It did resume and against my better judgement I began my trek once more. I was two doors down when I started discerning guttural sounds. Grunts and cursing emanated from the room at the end hallway. My curiosity had now firmly seized control, and I couldn’t help but see this endeavor to the end.

I reached the door after an eternity of creeping and skulking. I stopped just outside and listened to see if I could hear anything more. I was hoping that any information I might learn without going inside might satiate my curiosity. It didn’t. It just added fuel to the fire.

I carefully leaned my ear to the door to listen. I heard the same thudding as before as well as the sickening, squishing noise. I also perceived the guttural speech from earlier and I discerned multiple voices this time. I heard a recorded lullaby in the background, which seemed very out of place for this strange and lonely room.

I was trying to lean closer when my luck ran out for a second time. As I was listening, the door fell open and I plummeted to the floor. A wet, blood soaked floor. The carpet had been brown at one point in time but had since been stained a dark red from years of godless work.

What happened next is a merciful blur. I raised myself off the floor and ran back through the door and down the hallway. I jumped down the stairs and ran into the street.

I was picked up by the police and institutionalized for six months. They said I was a danger to myself and to those around me, but I didn’t do anything. I just told them what I had seen. I, eventually, rescinded the story and started taking the pills they prescribed so I could leave but I know what I saw.

I don’t care if the building only had three floors, not four. I don’t care if they couldn’t find any evidence of what I described. I know what I saw, and I see it every night when I sleep.

I see the blood stained, red carpet. I smell the fetid death that permeated the entire room. I still see the human limbs hanging from hooks like slabs of beef on display at a butcher shop.

I remember the horror of seeing a play pin made of human bone and sinew. I recall the fear when I saw that person on that macabre slab still twitching and moaning. Even after being hacked to pieces, he was still alive…and looking at me.

These things I can try to overcome with the counseling and medications but the creatures will haunt me for the rest of my life. Those twisted visages of man and beast. Those distorted features and elongated canines. Those tiny, dark eyes that stared at me with a numb evil in them torture me in my dreams.

Before I ran, the eyes of the one doing the butchering seemed to be sizing me up. It must have found me unfit because it turned away and threw a slab of meat into the play pin for its offspring to feed upon and returned to its grotesque task.

I can’t get the picture out of my head. It’s almost cost me my sanity and may still, but I can’t help but replay the scene every time I sleep, every time I close my eyes, every time I blink. I can’t escape them.

Late at night I still hear the thud and the guttural voices. I can’t hide from the ceaseless, relentless chopping sound that drove me to my quest, initially. I feel it rhythmically summoning me, calling to me. Once again drawing me, inevitably, down that cursed and unholy hallway. Again, pulling me towards that door and my doom.
