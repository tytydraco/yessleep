Five of Spades. It was the decisive moment, and he didn’t let it slip away. With skill, he picked up the card from the pile with his right hand, its texture as sturdy as a ham hock and rough like sandpaper. The deck, a silent witness to countless games, revealed the history of past matches in its worn cards. He then lowered his hand, and victory unveiled itself as a well-earned prize.

His fellow players grumbled in protest, their hoarse voices echoing through the ancient corridors of the mine. It was a place where the daily grind was as constant as the passage of time. The interior, scarred by decades of excavation, held the mine’s history in every crack. The yellowed light from incandescent bulbs made the shadows of the miners dance on the walls.

The winner, for his part, allowed himself one last look at that familiar place, which he witnessed daily—the old silver mine. The players gathered at the entrance to the deepest tunnels, seated at a weathered wooden table, shuffling worn cards from an exhausted deck. The solid stone walls stretched through the subterranean landscape, and ahead were numbered entrances, each leading to a tunnel where he would spend hours digging through the depths that night.

— Speak, my friend… — intervened his playing companion, breaking his reverie.

— What did you say? — he asked, bewildered.

— I asked if you want to start a new game or if you plan to begin your work soon. — the companion repeated.

— Well, the sooner I start, the sooner I’ll finish. — replied the veteran, stroking his graying beard.

He stood up, heading to one of the crates against the wall. Opening it, he pulled out his work tools — a rusted pickaxe and a yellow safety helmet, its scratched surface bearing the marks of years of service. The pickaxe, with its handle worn by sweat and the vibrations of mining. Inside the crate, an oil lantern remained, now obsolete due to the modern convenience of electric lights. As he organized his equipment, his colleagues gathered the cards and began preparing to leave, but not before offering a warning.

— Hey, are you planning to go deep today? — asked the taller, darker-skinned miner, the one who owned the deck.

— With every trip, I go deeper. That’s how the mine works. — the old man replied impatiently as he adjusted his helmet.

— I see. In that case, take the lantern. The lights have been failing down in the depths recently; it’s better to be safe. You don’t want to get lost in the dark down there. — the miner suggested, tucking the deck into his pocket.

— I’ll do that. — the old man said, retrieving the lantern and a matchbox from his hiding place.

The lantern was a reminder of times when darkness was the only companion in the depths of the mine, before electricity illuminated the way.

— Are you sure you want to go down there alone? You know, after the accident... — said the youngest miner. — They found Judas’s body, battered and unrecognizable... down there, — he finished, his voice heavy with concern.

— Forget those fears, boy. I’ve spent more time in this mine than you’ve been alive. A mere ghost won’t haunt me. That man was on the brink of madness, not sleeping or eating for days, muttering delirious things about the mine and cursing everyone. He probably threw himself into the machinery, ending his own suffering. — the veteran stated, heading toward the tunnels.

— Judas wasn’t always like that... — murmured the young miner, remembering the stories circulating about the miner who had lost his sanity in the mine’s depths.

— Let’s go before he gets even crankier without the work. — instructed the older miner, and both made their way to the elevator.

— Have a good night, sir. — the young man said, a trace of concern in his eyes.

— See you tomorrow. — replied the old miner.

The two activated the elevator, which, with its noisy gears, began to rise.

He gripped his pickaxe, fastened the unlit lantern to the bar of his coveralls, and entered the tunnels, unaware of what awaited him that night.

Four hundred and twelve... Four hundred and thirteen...

— I wonder if the dawn has already come? — he asked, alone, as he continued his tireless task of hammering the rock with his tool, collecting the rare fortune of silver that, by chance, he had managed to find.

How much time had passed since the farewell? Hard to say, in those depths, the flow of time seemed to have ceased, and it would have been a feat beyond human ability to perceive the approach of another being, given that the miner had ventured so deep into the tunnels that any sound of arrival was drowned out by tons of earth. Likewise, any cry from him would have been a silent lament in this abyss.

He only interrupted his laborious digging when he reached the coveted personal goal, four hundred and thirteen feet of depth explored. In a way, all the solitude that enveloped him while the pickaxe pierced the ancient rock was overcome by a proud, almost triumphant sigh. However, his triumph was overshadowed when the lamps around him began to flicker, and then...

The lamps buzzed, wavering, and finally... turned off. Ah, yes, the darkness, how beautiful the darkness is.

His colleague had been right, the electricity showed weakness in the deepest abysses of the mine. However, he had followed the advice, letting the old tool fall to the ground, creating a clink that echoed through the subterranean cavity. With his hands groping for his overalls, he maintained his calm, despite the growing despair. No matter how much he resisted the idea, he knew that age had taken its toll, and his memory was no longer what it once was. Among the numerous corridors of the mine, it could take a long time before anyone found him, time beyond what he himself had, and this caused a lump in his throat.

With the skill of a man familiar with the equipment, he detached the lantern and, with a single motion, brought a flickering flame to life. A faint, shimmering light filled the space. He took a deep breath, controlling the rising anxiety, maintaining control of his breathing, while, with one hand, he directed the fragile light through the labyrinth of dark tunnels.

The orange light of the lantern bathed the worn stone floor as he breathed with growing anxiety, his initial cautious steps turning into a frantic walk. He desperately tried to recall the way, but confusion took over—did he turn left or right, or was it the opposite? The rhythm of his steps became a run, his breathing agitated like a hurricane. Where was the exit? Cold drops of sweat began to run down his forehead. The fear... The tips of his fingers were growing cold with increasing anxiety. Not a common fear, but an inner, childlike fear, locked away for years, that resurfaced relentlessly. He tried to deny it, suppress it, pretend it didn’t exist, but now it was there, more real than ever, consuming him like an insatiable flame. His despair grew, the darkness enveloped him, and he was lost, struggling against — ***CRACK.***

Silence surrounded him like a cloak. With an inadvertent movement, he lowered his gaze, surprised to see what he had just stepped on. His gaze settled on a broken crate, and his leg, now wounded by the jagged wood, was proof of his carelessness. However, something caught his attention: a solitary object, resting inside the shattered crate. Blood splattered on the cover of the item, a cruel reminder of his injury. With difficulty and a grimace of contained pain, he freed his leg from the wreckage, revealing a diagonal cut that ran from his right calf to his left. As quick as a thought, he ripped the shirt from his sweaty torso and turned it into an improvised bandage, wrapping it tightly around his leg.

He breathed quickly, nervously, his old heart racing. Then, he forced himself to breathe deeply again, trying to calm himself, inhaling deeply... and exhaling forcefully.

Carefully, he picked up the object that had caught his attention: a notebook, its cover stained with his own blood. His leg lay painfully on the cold, damp floor of the mine, next to strange scratch marks on the solid stone walls. With a choked sigh, he placed the lantern by his side, letting its trembling light reveal a glimpse of the notebook’s contents. His breath was heavy, laden with anxiety as he held the notebook with trembling hands and opened it. Deep down, he hoped the words written within could illuminate his path as much as the uncertain light of the lantern.

The notebook showed signs of severe wear, with pages torn out and others completely scratched in a chaotic manner. As he moved to a partially legible section, he began to read the content.

“Today, another day in the mine. ~~My little corner!~~ But... sometimes, I see something, like an onhmribassyaiw, but when I stare at it, it disappears. Am I losing my *screws*?”\*\*\*

With trembling fingers, he turned the page with growing concern, looking around the corridor, seeing only darkness, but still feeling a chill:

“The little lights are flickering non-stop. When it gets dark, I feel ~~something strange~~. The lantern has been my compadre. As it flickers, I’m *locked in*. But I’m afraid it **will go out**. You’re my only friend now, notie.”

Intrigued, yet terrified, he slid his bloodstained fingers over the next page, as he tried to read, tapping his foot on the ground incessantly, restless:

“Today, I bumped into some **marks** of nails on the walls of the holes. \~\~Deep, deep, deep, like something wild had **ripped** the stone. I feel like it's getting close. **Close**. *Close.* close.”

Holding his breath, he lifted the lantern to examine the marks stretching across the walls, as a silent prayer lingered in his mind. His hands trembled, wavered, and the temperature of his body dropped, as fear increased. When he turned the page, the revelation was distressing:

“Can’t deny it anymore. The **THING** is almost on my *tail*. It doesn’t **see right**— My only **way out** is to follow the ~~direction arrows~~ and find my way back to the elevator. GETOUTGETOUT. Wait, i think i heard something. - JD.”

Finally, the journal revealed its last page, which was unreadable. Whatever had been recorded there had been covered by a large patch of dried blood, and it definitely wasn’t his.

Terrified, no, completely scared, in an impulsive movement, he threw the object away, losing focus on his breathing, and began to breathe in a frenzy.

In great haste, he struggled to rise, desperately wishing to leave as quickly as possible. While trying, unsuccessfully, to keep calm.

Limping, he dragged himself through the tunnel, taking the lantern and his last hope with him. He breathed rapidly, terrified, wanting to leave. He leaned against the wall, leaving a trail of blood behind him, while feeling along the wall and lighting the path, running his hand over the mysterious claw marks. He definitely wouldn’t want to see what made them firsthand. Then, by some stroke of luck, his calloused fingers found something: an arrow carved into the rock. It could have been his mind playing tricks on him, but at that moment, his hope was rekindled. The timid flame of the lantern seemed to come alive for a moment.

Suddenly, the lights returned and then went out again. The electricity had not been restored, and to his misfortune, the electrical panel was up on the surface, out of reach. The lamps began to flicker frantically, and then a guttural sound echoed through the corridors of the mine, as if a terrible beast were prowling in the shadows. The noise seemed to come from all directions, making it impossible to discern its origin. The sound was not just a simple noise; it was intense, so strong that he could feel the ground shaking, feel his heart pounding faster, feel death approaching. The poor man paled at the sound, tears trembling down his face, tears of fear. And even with a wound open on his leg, he did not hesitate to follow the carved arrows, desperate for a chance to escape this nightmare, even if it meant running aimlessly through the darkness while bleeding, leaving a trail of crimson-red on the ground.

He launched forward with renewed hope, the pain in his leg a cruel reminder of his fragility. The carved arrows in the stone were his guide, his only connection to salvation, but the growing fear began to take root in his mind. The dance of the lantern’s flame was an unsettling sign, threatening to extinguish at any moment.

Then, a terrible ***BAM! BAM! BAM!*** reverberated through the dark corridors. Heavy, hurried footsteps, a presence approaching with brutal force, and the old miner knew that time was running out. Each step was a drumbeat in his chest, and the sound echoed in his mind as a warning that something terrible was closing in.

He slowed his pace, forcing his wounded leg to continue, but deep down, he was already accepting the facts. He was alone, wounded, and being pursued by a beast from the depths. The lantern’s flame, trembling like his own heart, threatened to go out—his last line of defense between him and the unknown.

And then, ***BAM! BAM! BAM!*** The relentless footsteps approached rapidly. The miner felt as if a shockwave ran through his body, from head to toe, making every hair on his body stand on end. There was no immediate escape. As a last resort, he silently ducked into a tunnel curve and held his breath. The steps resonated, an imminent encounter. ***BAM! BAM! BAM!*** The beast passed straight by the curve, and the old man exhaled, not daring to peek at what it was, for the creature’s putrid scent was already torturous enough. His body was exhausted, aching for rest. He felt his muscles scream, his bones creak, longing, begging him to give up. The sounds distanced themselves, and the roars faded into the darkness.

He knew he had escaped by the skin of his teeth, and despite all the pain, the fear, he couldn’t waste this chance. The fear slowly transformed into a kind of fuel that wouldn’t let him stop. With determination, he stood up and continued his journey. And then, he saw it—the light of the moon filtering through the elevator shaft, and it renewed his strength. The lantern burned brighter, his heart felt as if it would leap out of his chest, his hyperventilation turned into joyful breathing, a relieved smile on his face. He began to run as fast as he could, which, due to his injury, wasn’t very fast, but for a moment, he felt young again, alive. The adrenaline consumed his blood, his pupils dilated, and he craved his goal, his salvation, more than anything.

Along the way, his injured leg began to fail, forcing him to slow down and pay attention to his surroundings. And then, he saw it—the wooden table, where everything had begun that fateful night. He used a chair as an improvised crutch and hobbled over to the elevator. With trembling hands, he pressed the button to call the machine. The mechanism creaked, making a loud noise that seemed to echo through the depths of the mine. Then, another roar echoed from the depths, the steps approaching ferociously—***BAMBAMBAMBAM***. That sound made his entire body shiver again. He felt the vibration of the ground, he knew it was coming. He had come so far; he couldn’t give up now. To buy himself some time, he threw the chair forcefully in the direction of the sound, hoping to distract the beast for a brief moment.

The chair shattered into a thousand pieces upon hitting something in the darkness, a figure he couldn’t fully make out. After all, his eyes were no longer the same. The lantern flickered, the footsteps ceased, and a brief silence hung in the air. The creature seemed momentarily distracted. It was all he needed. The elevator finally descended.

He hurled himself into the elevator, sitting against the safety grate, looking up and seeing the silver light of the moon. Hope was reborn—he had made it. His accelerated heart announced his triumph, and he raised the lantern to guide himself when… The beast was there, covered in a thousand shards of the chair. Apparently, he wasn’t the only one who could be silent. They stared at each other for a moment. The creature was between his hand and the up button. It slowly moved closer. His throat closed completely. He was suffocating in tears, shaking, completely overtaken by terror. He kicked, hit the walls, muttered curses until... He stopped. It was useless. The man took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and let his last tears fall. Then, the beast gently blew, and the lantern’s flame went out.
