I went to talk to the professor that sponsors [the Rain Chasers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zeoek1/how_to_survive_college_the_stabbed_student/).  Professor Beatrice.  The folklore professor.  On one hand, it seems a little suspicious that the professor that specializes in folklore also sponsors the Rain Chaers, doesn’t it?  But on the other hand, she’s the only professor that specializes in folklore so her interest in the club is kind of obvious.

She seemed happy to see me, even though I’m not certain she remembered who I was.  My tentative plan is to take one of her classes as an elective next semester so that I’ll have an even better reason to drop in on her office hours.  For now, however, she seemed like most professors - the door is open, her own students don’t make enough use of her time, so why not talk with a random person that clearly has an interest in her subject?

She didn’t even seem disappointed when I told her I was there to ask about the Rain Chasers and not folklore.  She’s kind of hard to read, though.  Like I get the feeling if a werewolf came charging in through the front door, tore down all the movie posters her colleagues hung on the walls and then dove out through the front window, she’d just be like ‘okay that was exciting’ and get busy cleaning up the tattered wallpaper while humming off-key.  That’s just the vibe I get from her.  She seems pretty unbothered by… everything.

I’m more than a little jealous.  What is her secret?  What dark pact has she made to not spend every day running through every scenario of everything that could possibly go wrong?

(my mental scenario of what could go wrong visiting her office hours was that she’d tell me I wasn’t allowed to be there unless I was in her classes and that she’d be mean about it, too)

I asked why she reformed the club.  She looked surprised for a moment and said she wasn’t aware it had been disbanded.  From her perspective, the person running it hadn’t submitted the paperwork, which could have just been an oversight.  It wasn’t unheard of for students to get busy with something else or lose interest, after all, and the smaller clubs were especially prone to falling apart over a lapse from one person.  They wouldn’t have someone ready to step up or wouldn’t have people checking and double checking that everything was filed correctly.  Smaller, niche clubs like the Rain Chasers just needed a little help from time to time, she explained.

Something something road to hell, good intentions, etc.

“It’d just be such a shame,” she continued, “if it weren’t around anymore.  Sure, they get a little… sensational… sometimes with how seriously they take these stories, but they’re the only organization dedicated to *preserving* this town’s local culture.  I know people only tend to think of fairytales in terms of what gets made into a movie, but our body of folklore is actually made up of all these little bits and pieces of stories that get passed down through the generations.  It’d be a tragedy to lose it.”

I could sense she was about to go off on a tangent and while I can’t say I wasn’t interested, I needed to stay focused.  I asked who was leading the club now and where the new members had come from.  The rift that caused us to shut it down at the end of the year was pretty bad, I said, hinting that there’d been a falling out between members and that’s why most everyone left.

“I asked one of my students from the previous year,” she said.  “He’s signed up for more of my classes and seems really interested in folklore.  He was excited to get more involved in the subject.”

The new members were recruited either through her connections or at the campus recruitment fair, which I’d totally forgotten about and hadn’t gone to this year.

“It’s good to find *someone* that cares,” she said mournfully.  My diversion had failed.  We were back on this topic again.  “The town doesn’t dedicate any resources to preserving their history.  Oh, sure, they’ll fund the arts festival, but this isn’t *art*, it’s just silly stories kids tell.  And the administration, well…”

She sighed deeply and airily waved her hands at our surroundings.

“We don’t even have a proper building.  I said we could take some rooms in the English department, but they were like oh no we need those rooms even though-”

“You don’t want to be in that building,” I interrupted.  “There’s something that roams its hallways.”

Yes, dear readers, the English department is in the building with the thing in the hallway.

I blurted that out partly to stop her from continuing down the road of a rant against the administration (as entertaining as that might be, that wasn’t why I was here) and also because I kind of wanted to see her reaction.  She took the bait and asked what I meant by that.  So I told her.  I told her about the thing in the hallway, but I phrased it as this was something that someone else had told me.  I changed some things.  I told her that the way you knew it was coming was by the sound of humming coming down the corridor.  The way you saved yourself, by not looking and acting like it wasn’t there until it left, I didn’t change.  She needed to know the truth for that bit.

“And what happens if you break the rule?” she asked with interest.  “There’s *always* a condition and there’s *always* a punishment when it’s broken.  That’s how these work.”

“Oh, uh,” I stammered.  I hadn’t thought this far in advance and didn’t have a lie prepared.  “Well, it, uh, it eats you.”

“Less gruesome than some of the fates in the fairytales,” she said happily.  “Maybe I should ask my colleagues in the English department if they’ve heard this story.”

My heart skipped a beat when she said that, then I remembered that she’d actually never asked my name.  She had no idea who I was.  Not that I think anyone would care.  I mean, there’s a whole *club* devoted to this, after all.  And she’d made sure they’d keep meeting.

Also they’re not named the Rain Chasers anymore.  Can’t say I’m sorry to see that name go.  It sounded like something Daniel would have come up with.  They’re now the <university’s name redacted for obvious reasons> Folklore Society.  Good change.  It’s the *only* good change though, because let’s not gloss over the fact that the group has been rebuilt after we explicitly tried to put it in the grave, on account of how it got a bunch of students put in *their* graves.

So I seethed on the inside but smiled politely outside and thanked her for her time.

I was a bit of a mess walking back to my dorm.  It really bothered me that the club was still there.  It’s obvious to me why that is - it felt like everything I did, all the terror and risking of my life and all, was futile.  For a moment I’d thought that maybe we were making some progress, with Maria shutting the club down and with the list of rules.  I felt like I’d made a difference in a big way, instead of just for one semester.

But here we were again.  Another set of students dabbling with things that were going to get them all killed.  I wanted to cry.

Maybe I’m putting too much on myself.  Even the devil said I wasn’t that important.  Just convenient.  These stories are perpetuated by inertia and the campus is a heavy load.  One person throwing themselves against it wasn’t enough to stop anything.  I was lucky I hadn’t been crushed underneath the weight of it all.

I was brooding through these thoughts when I heard a door slam somewhere up ahead on the sidewalk.  Two people had just come out of a side entrance for one of the dormitories.  One was struggling.  The other was dragging him behind her by the wrist.  I opened my mouth, about to yell at them and draw some sort of attention to the situation, but then I got a good look at the lady and my voice died in my throat.

The laundry lady.  It was the laundry lady, dragging off some hapless student, and I wasn’t the only person here - there were other students walking along the sidewalk - and not one of them noticed the terrified student struggling to free himself from her grip.  

Just me.  Only me.  Because I know the inhuman and it knows me and we can’t hide from each other any longer.

In a metaphorical sense, at least.  I realized the laundry lady was turning to walk in my direction and I scrambled for the nearest tree and threw myself down beside it, hastily pulling my jacket hood up and fishing a book out of my backpack.  I could totally hide in the physical sense.  If the other students weren’t noticing her presence, then I’d act like I didn’t see her either.

I mentally ran through the contents of my backpack.  I needed a weapon.  Something to distract her and maybe break her grip so the student could run.  I could throw a book at her, I supposed.  It was heavy.

Then someone else walked up to her, coming from the opposite direction, and all my hopes were dashed.

It was the flickering man.  The sky was overcast, but there was no rain, yet here he was.  He hooked his thumbs into his jean pockets and stood directly in the lady’s path, a thin smile on his stupid, smug face.

She stopped short and stared at him with undisguised disgust.  My hiding place wasn’t *great*, but I had a clear view and I was close enough to overhear their conversation.

“What are *you* doing out here?” the laundry lady snapped.  “It’s not raining.  You must be struggling to keep yourself corporeal.”

“I can go without the rain for a short time,” he said casually.  “It takes a little effort, obviously, but sometimes it's worth it.”

“My understanding is it takes more than *a little* effort.  Perhaps I could poke you and you’d collapse and then I wouldn’t have to see your ugly face anymore.”

“*Try it.*”

He hissed the words between clenched teeth, his lips still peeled back in a grin.  If there was pain in his voice under the strain, it was utterly masked by the anticipation in his challenge.  He only needed an excuse and from the wary expression on the laundry lady’s face, she knew it.

“No thank you,” she said dryly.  “I’m in a bit of a hurry, anyway.  It’s… *dinnertime.*”

“Where were you taking him?” he asked casually.

The laundry lady’s lips tightened into a thin line.

“Somewhere I could kill him quietly,” she replied.

“Are you *certain*?”

His expression didn’t noticeably change, but his smile seemed more smug.  I could feel it.  Like oil on my skin.  From the laundry lady’s narrowing eyes, she felt it too, and didn’t much care for it either.

“Where *else* would I take him?” she snapped.  “I just wanted to find someplace where I could leave a mess behind.  I spent all that time helping with his laundry, it’d be a waste to ruin it with blood and bits of his body.”

The student jerked in the laundry lady’s grip at that comment, finally stirred out of his paralyzing terror.  He struggled to free herself, throwing his entire body weight into it in an effort to wrench himself out of her captor’s grip.  I remained where I was, shaking violently, raising my textbook so I could hide my face behind it.

What could I have done?  What can any of us do against the inhuman, except hope they don’t come for us at all?

“Well, it’s just… you know.”

The flickering man looked thoughtful for a moment, then smiled slyly.  He was watching the laundry lady intently.  Whatever he was insinuating, they both knew very damn well what it was.  Still, she refused to budge.

“No, I don’t know,” she replied stubbornly.

Then she shook the student with one hand clasped on the back of his jacket.

“That’s enough flailing,” she snapped.  “If you didn’t want to be here, you shouldn’t have dumped all that clothing I so diligently folded *onto the floor*.  What do you have against hangers?”

“Here, you seem to be having some trouble with that one,” the flickering man said.  “Allow me to help.”

He reached out and grabbed the man’s free wrist.  The student’s back was to me, but I didn’t have to see his face to know his panic was starting to overwhelm him.  He jerked convulsively in their grasp, yanking his arms so hard I swear I heard the tendons pop.  His feet scrambled for purchase but it was no use, he might as well have been trying to free himself from a block of concrete.  They held onto him and glared at each other past his frantically struggling body.

The laundry lady refused to relinquish her prey.  She tightened her grip on the student’s arm and began to pull it towards her.  I saw it bend.  Twist.  She wasn’t going to let go and from the look on his face, neither was the flickering man.  The student was caught between them like a ragdoll clutched by two squabbling children.

I couldn’t watch.  I couldn’t stop it and I couldn’t watch.  I threw myself to the other side of the tree so it would be between me and them.  Then I squeezed my eyes shut tight and covered my ears with my hands so I couldn’t hear.  I resolved to stay like that for a long, long time, until I was certain the pair were gone and they’d taken with them whatever was left of the poor, doomed student.  I might be one of the few on campus that has experience with the inhuman and that might mean that I was going to keep running into it over and over, but I’d be damned before I *watched*.

I wished I could sink into the earth.  Just let it swallow me up and be gone, be senseless, be like the dead, until it was all over.

I crouched there for I don’t know how long.  The only sound was that of my own breathing, echoing in my ears.  

Then a finger tapped my back.

I didn’t scream.  I don’t react that way.  I don’t panic.  I just… freeze.  My body sort of went rigid and I think if the person had pushed me any harder, I’d have simply fallen over.  

Like cow tipping.  Which… isn’t a thing, I know, I did grow up in a rural area after all.

“You can come out now,” a voice said above me.  “He’s gone.”

My brain started to churn back into motion and I made small, frantic noises in the back of my throat.  She was still here.  The laundry lady was still here.

Did that mean the student’s remains were still there too?  Was I going to open my eyes to a pile of limbs and vacant eyes, frozen in their last moments of terror and agony?

“Oh *please*,” the laundry lady hissed.  “If I wanted you dead I would have figured something out already.”

“T-the student-” I managed to squeak.

“He took it with him.  Said the thing in the hallway has been going hungry lately.  You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?”

I opened my eyes and found her crouched in front of me.  The crow’s feet at the corners of her eyes were crinkled in narrow suspicion.  The kindly look she had when I first met her was wiped away, leaving not a trace behind.  There was only cunning malice.

“Are… students not getting eaten?” I whispered.

“Well, it doesn’t feed very often, so it only takes one bad round of hunting to leave it starving, you see.  So let me ask again - do you know anything about that?  Because that man that just left - he doesn’t like it when things are out of order.”

The list of rules.  She was asking if I’d written the list.  I lowered my gaze, not trusting myself to look at her any longer.  Perhaps she’d take that as an admission of guilt in of itself, but I had to hope that *some* of the old rules still applied.  Humans could lie all they wanted.  The inhuman, however, were bound to stricter standards when evaluating truth.

“I don’t know,” I mumbled, which I guess technically isn’t a lie.  I don’t know if my rules are helping or not.  She did just say that it didn’t hunt very often.  Could be a coincidence.

“Well, if a human *did* intervene,” she said, standing.  Her joints popped when she did and she winced.  “I’d advise them to be *very careful*.”

“Are you… helping me?” I asked, daring to look up again.

She scowled down at me and crossed her arms over her chest.

“No, I’m just offering advice and not telling my murderous colleague we were being watched because I’m bored.  Of course I’m helping you!  Children these days, I swear.  Show some gratitude.”

I stumbled to my feet, somehow managing to stammer out something along the lines of ‘thank you for not getting me killed.’  Her expression didn’t change, but neither did she do anything *bad* to me, so I have to assume it was good enough.

“So… you knew I was there the whole time?” I ventured.

“Of course I did.  Hiding only works on us in very specific circumstances.  Oh, you don’t need to worry about him,” she hastily amended, seeing the look on my face.  “He’s a special circumstance all of his own.  Specifically, he’s so busy being full of himself that he wouldn’t see anything that wasn’t directly in front of his face.”

I laughed.  It just sounded so absurd, hearing something like that coming from something like her.  And yes, my laugh bordered on hysteria, but I just felt so relieved to hear that maybe there was another inhuman thing that had the same enemy as me and it wasn’t just me depending on the devil to save my stupid butt anymore.  Dangerous, I know, letting my guard down around *anything* inhuman.  But the laundry lady might be the unholy union of a crotchety boomer and your favorite mom figure, who just *ripped a student in half*, but she was still one of the few things around here that wasn’t trying to kill me or get me killed. 

So far.

“I guess I’m not alone in hating him?” I ventured.

“Who doesn’t hate him?” she seethed.  “Strutting around like he’s better than us, when all he’s got going for him is he doesn’t mind licking their feet.”

Them?  The administration?

“They don’t… work for you?” I ventured.

“Wouldn’t that be lovely?  But no.  They’re not here for our benefit.  We’re here for *theirs*.”

My brain sluggishly turned that over, quietly reevaluating everything I’ve assumed about this university.  If they weren’t subject to the inhuman… then why did they tolerate them here?  Was this another honey pot like the campgrounds?  But that still didn’t seem right with what she’d said - they were here for the administration’s *benefit*.  Not trapped here or anything else that might imply this place was keeping them out of the general populace.

Benefit.

“I have a proposal,” the laundry lady said, interrupting my whirling thoughts.  “As much as it pains me to admit it, we actually made a pretty good team last time.  I think we should work together again.”

“Are you sure?” I asked, trying to find reasons to refuse.  “I got you in trouble that one time.”

“Oh, but that’s different.  That was an accident.  You didn’t know what you were doing.  This time… this time we’re going to do this on *purpose*.”

“Do what?” I asked dumbly, because I apparently don’t know when to just shut up and walk away.

She gleefully rubbed her hands together, her eyes glinting with ill intention.

“The flickering man,” she said.  “This time, we’re going to get *him* in trouble.” [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
