I looked up at the imposing multi storied brick building that seemed to loom 100 feet above me. It was my first day as an intern at this psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of the city, far removed from the bustling sounds of normal city life. The hospital had a dark past that involved a string of suicides in the late '80s. It would not have been my first choice, but I really needed a job, and they were hiring.

The first part of the day was very routine, marked by a welcoming smile from Dr. Gordon, the head of the facility. He guided me through the labyrinthine corridors, reassuring me with stories of the institution's commitment to healing the individuals behind these walls who are grappling with severe mental illnesses. As we traversed the dim hallways and heard distant screams, an unsettling feeling began to gnaw at the edges of my brain. Dr. Gordon reassured me that I had nothing to worry about, and that some of the patients simply suffered from very bad night terrors.

After the tour, Dr. Gordon introduced me to some of the other hospital staff, and they were all nice enough. But I couldn’t shake this feeling it was like they were all hiding something from me. As we navigated the shadowy hallways, the distant screams persisted, growing louder and more unsettling with each step. Dr. Gordon assured me that I would soon get used to the sounds and wouldn’t even notice them anymore.

He then led me to a small, dimly lit room nestled deep within the hospital's heart. He explained that it was time for me to watch the orientation video. I sat in the chair, perfectly centered in the room. Dr. Gordon walked up to the TV, turned it on, and pressed play on the VCR. Then he promptly exited the room, leaving me alone, only being lit by the glow that came from the TV. The video looked like it was filmed in the mid-1980s, with dust and static dancing across the screen, creating an eerie ambiance.

The video began with an elderly doctor named Dr. Elizabeth Simms stepping into frame, her gaunt appearance slightly unnerving me. She introduced the hospital as a place of healing and transformation, promising to guide patients to a “brighter tomorrow." The staff, who all wore unconvincing smiles, showcased "state-of-the-art" treatment methods and revolutionary therapies. However, something about the way the patients all stared into the camera with empty, hollow eyes sent shivers down my spine.

The video then cut to Dr. Simms with the rest of the staff standing outside in front of the hospital. Then Dr. Simms's expression got very serious as she said, "We understand the importance of unlocking the deepest fears and desires that dwell within our patients. We push the boundaries of the mind and reality itself. Only then can one truly confront the darkest recesses of their soul and find healing. We are not here to heal in the traditional sense, you could say. We are here to unleash potential, to delve into the abyss, to explore the uncharted territories of the human psyche. This journey will change you forever.”

Then her face softened, and then a beaming smile spread across her face as she said, “Welcome to Westin Hills.”
