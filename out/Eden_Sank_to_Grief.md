The title is a line from one of my favorite poems: Nothing Gold Can Stay, by Robert Frost. It was read at the celebration of life the city held for the victims of the Roanoke Easter Massacre–a case I have a very personal connection with. My name is Corporal Chris Fulton, and I wrote the incident report that morning. Aside from the officers stationed at the parade when it happened, I was the first one on the scene. I put the son-of-a-bitch in handcuffs.



That was in nineteen eighty–long time ago now. I’ve retired, and now I sit at home most of the time watching television. It struck me a few years ago that the world is cruel and people are vile animals. After all I’ve seen, I don’t think I want to interact with them any more than to buy groceries from a teenager at the register, or get a haircut from my barber. If only more people knew the truth of things.



But I’m writing this up now to spread that truth. The report twenty-something year old me wrote all those years ago is free to read in Roanoke–at the library in their local history records, or at the police station if you ask for a copy. That’s how big this thing shook the city… the event itself, and what we discovered after. How it took a breakthrough archeological discovery, and flipped it into a horror story. A tragedy. One that took the lives of twenty three people. 



So here’s that police report I wrote. I’ll come in after to give some better context, and cut in whatever I feel needs to be cut in. Hopefully I can get the message through clear.

***Case Number: 666397200***



***Date: 13 August 1980***



***Reporting Officer: CPL Fulton***



***Incident Type: Vehicular Rampage***



***Address of Occurrence: 9-19 Franklin Rd SW, Roanoke, VA 24011, USA***



***Evidence:***



***Closed-circuit surveillance footage***



***Numerous eyewitnesses***



*On August 13, 1980, at approximately 12:53, a green Jeep Wrangler driven by the suspect, Scott Michael Cranston (D.O.B. Aug. 13, 1943) drove into the crowd watching the Easter Day Parade passing through Franklin Rd SW. The Jeep made it through the crowd and smashed into the shopfront window of the Kohl’s located at 13 Franklin Rd SE, Roanoke, VA 24011, which was closed at the time.* 



*Cranston remained in the vehicle until I, CPL Fulton, arrived on the scene. I approached the vehicle with my pistol drawn, and ordered him to exit the vehicle and place his hands on his head. Cranston complied with no resistance. As I did so, I observed at least three motionless civilians pinned underneath the wheels of the Jeep. I could not identify their features or ages, as their bodies were covered in blood, and/or obscured by the tires.*



*I handcuffed Cranston and read his Miranda Rights, then I placed him in the back of my cruiser and allowed time for backup to arrive, which they did at approximately 12:59. After which point I drove Cranston to the department.*



*During the drive, he began to describe alleged motivations behind his crime. He told me that he was an accomplished archeologist from the Virginia Department of Historical Resources, which has since been confirmed. He then began to repeat himself in what seemed to me like a psychotic rant, uttering the name “Eileen” over and over again, as well as stating that he had “released our ten plagues,” and “eaten from the apple.” I asked him what his reasoning was for committing a vehicular rampage, and he stated to me that it was, “the only way to make us listen,” and that, “God made me do it. Terrible God. With a red mask and horrible wings larger than the void, and part of the void. Black pillars, taller than redwood trees, rising up out of the endlessness... and screaming... everywhere.” More was said, but I cannot recall the specifics.*



*Once we arrived at the station, I passed Cranston off to the booking team.*



*There is nothing further to report.*

I’d been intrigued by what he’d said to me during that car ride, so when he was interrogated, I sat behind the glass to watch it. All five times. Each time had heightened my curiosity, and my discomfort. Before, I’d imagined he was another “the devil made me do it” nutcase, but afterward, his explanations had me wondering. I couldn’t make up my mind on it. 



Now what I’m about to dictate here was recorded, and is also available now for public viewing. I think I saw it posted on YouTube. Again, this was a very publicized case in the area, and anyone in Roanoke will have at least heard about it.



I’ll paste the transcription of the audio here. The detective talking to Cranston is Harry Mccarty. Nice guy, as far as I can remember.

***Detective:*** *So You’re with the Department of Historical Resources?*



***Cranston:*** *Yes.*



***Detective:*** *How long?*



***Cranston:*** *Around eleven years now. I… studied in Richmond… at the, uh…* 



***Detective:*** *Where’d you study? Sorry?*



***Cranston:*** *… … Sorry?*



***Detective:*** *Where’d you study, Scott?*



***Cranston:*** *U.V.A.*



***Detective:*** *Okay. Thanks. … … I think I read about you in the paper not long ago. Like a month ago now, was it?*



***Cranston:*** *Could be.*



***Detective:*** *You discovered something up on Roanoke mountain. Can you tell me about that?*



***Cranston:*** *Eileen…* 



***Detective:*** *Who’s that?*



***Cranston:*** *Uh… sorry?*



***Detective:*** *You said ‘Eileen.’ Who’s that? That one of your team? Your wife?*



***Cranston:*** *We found a… human body. It was preserved… very well. It was embedded in the rock, in a little clearing. The underbrush… wouldn’t grow around it. Animals didn’t seem to have touched it… didn’t approach it. Uh… … …* 



***Detective:*** *Why not?*



***Cranston:*** *… … It was old. Very… old. Tabbie thought it was Clovis.*



***Detective:*** *Who’s Tabbie?*



***Cranston:*** *Tabitha Lynette. She has razor blade scars all over her arms.* 



***Detective:*** *Was that… like… was that a team member that was with you?*



***Cranston:*** *Yes.*



***Detective:*** *Okay.*



***Cranston:*** *And there was Jackie Rathkin. He was the one who named her.*



***Detective:*** *Eileen?*



***Cranston:*** *Yes.* 



***Detective:*** *Okay, Scott, go on–about Eileen.*



***Cranston:*** *We uh… we dug her up–chiseled her out of the rock. Jackie had a headache. … … Clouds came in from the West. Dark clouds. … … We laid her out on a blanket, and the head came off, and I looked at the skull. There were… uh… enlarged nasal cavities. More space for the cranial nerves.*



***Detective:*** *What’s that mean?*



***Cranston:*** *Uh… bad things.*



***Detective:*** *… Sorry?*



***Cranston:*** *I ran my hand over the skull… I could smell warm baking bread… the… warmth of my children. But the bone was cold… old… and cold.*



***Detective:*** *Alright. Go on.*



***Cranston:*** *If we got our trowels too close to the bones, Jackie would snap at us. He had a headache… and it was getting worse… and his nerves would bite when we touched the bone. Uh… She had some skin. And all the organs were still there. Just dried up and preserved. Well preserved. And the brain…* 



***Detective:*** *What about the brain?*



***Cranston:*** *The backup team came up that afternoon with some stuff to get the remains off the mountain… uh… But it felt like they were taking her away… Jackie had a headache. He got so pissed off. But they took her away.*



***Detective:*** *Scott… uh. So what happened then?*



***Cranston:*** *We studied her in our laboratory. Dissecting. Cut… cutting.*



***Detective:*** *What was your role with that? Like, what were you in charge of?*



***Cranston:*** *The brain.*



***Detective:*** *Can you elaborate a little?*



***Cranston:*** *Uh… can I have some water please?*



***Detective:*** *Yeah, we’ll get you a refill. While we do, how about you give me your answer?*



***Cranston:*** *Um… what was the question, sorry?*



***Detective:*** *What were you doing with the brain? Did you find anything?* 



***Cranston:*** *Uh… yeah. There were… things that shouldn’t be there.*



***Detective:*** *What things?*



***Cranston:*** *Extra things. Uh… nerves. Cranial nerves. They were big and… we don’t have them anymore–humans.*



***Detective:*** *Why’s that?*



***Cranston:*** *To keep us safe.*



***Detective:*** *From?*



***Cranston:*** *(doesn’t answer)*



***Detective:*** *Where are your two team members, Scott? Tabbie, and uh… Jackie?*



***Cranston:*** *Dead now.*



***Detective:*** *What do you mean?*



***Cranston:*** *Tabbie cut herself a thousand times with a razor blade… she’s… lying in her bathtub. And… … Jackie… uh… Jackie’s head wouldn’t stop hurting. So he… put his Benelli between his teeth while watching David Letterman.* 



***Detective:*** *How do you know that?*



***Cranston:*** *We all did it at the same time… like we agreed. Cause we all saw God.*

  
***Detective:*** *What do you mean? Where did you see God?*

  
***Cranston:*** *He showed me heaven... a swirling void... screaming... and God, larger than the void, but... but he was floating through it. Wings taller than anything I've ever seen. And there were black pillars... like redwood trees, growing up out of the endlessness... They were singing... vibrations.*

  
***Detective:*** *You said your partners saw this, too?*

  
***Cranston:*** *Yes.*



***Detective:*** *Where are they, Scott?*



***Cranston:*** *In their homes now. (addresses censored)*



***Detective:*** *If we show up and find them exactly how you just described, you know how that’ll look?*



***Cranston:*** *It doesn’t matter.*



***Detective:*** *Why’s that.*



***Cranston:*** *I’ve given myself up to save all of you. They did the same for themselves.*



***Detective:*** *… … We searched your house a few hours ago, Scott. Can you tell me what you think we found?*



***Cranston:*** *(doesn’t answer)*



***Detective:*** *We found Eileen. Right?*



***Cranston:*** *Yes.*



***Detective:*** *Torn to pieces in your kitchen. Her brain was pulverized in your blender.*



***Cranston:*** *Yes… … Can I get some water now, please?*

There were four more interrogations after that one, mostly due to the fact that they found his two team members exactly how he’d described. The woman had cut herself and bled to death, and the man had blown his brain out. Theories were tossed around as to what happened; some people were thinking it was a cult ritual, or some sort of shared psychosis due to gasses or toxins released by the body they’d dug up on the mountain. Maybe. 



It was impossible to tell directly if Cranston had been lying about those “extra pieces” on the brain, or the cavities in the skull. He really had made a brain smoothie that morning, before heading out the door with the keys to his Jeep. The skull had been smashed to dust as well. As far as records and photographs go, they seem to corroborate his story, and people at the Department of Historical Resources who weren’t involved in the whole thing claimed to have seen the extra nerves and the cavities in the skull. But pictures and reports are one thing, and physical evidence is another. 



In over forty years, not one shred of real truth has come out of this whole thing. Everyone has their theories on what went wrong with Cranston and his team, but no one knows for sure. The lucky bastard managed to kill off whatever chance there was when he destroyed that brain. Me, personally–I think there was something in his eyes whenever he was interrogated that I can’t say I’ve ever seen again. Not in any murderer, or pedophile, or rapist. I saw it first-hand through that one-way mirror. They weren’t the eyes of a liar. 



And I keep hearing his voice in the back of my cruiser–what he was telling me. The passion, and the fear. How he described God. I don't suppose we're gonna know anything definitive--only what we choose to believe.



In my opinion, whatever it was he saw–whatever reached his team through that mummified body… that was not God.
