I don't know if these types of posts are allowed on this subreddit, but I've tried everything else I can think of.

I'm looking for a story I read posted here that I only finished halfway. I need to know how it ends. It was about 3 years ago I  think. Here's a summary of the story:

A man starts getting emails from an anonymous source asking him for help and to share this with the media. This is what the documents said. This person and 6 others woke up in some sort of facility with matching clothes (like scrubs or something ) and no one remembers how they got there. They are in a pure white room with nothing in it except a typed document and a door in the middle of the room. When you open the door it's filled with smoke and you can't see it but you can hear people pleading for help. It's impossible since the door is in the middle of the room and there's nothing behind it.
They go and look at the document, and it lists rules for the "competition". 
1. There is no way out other than the door
2. The first 6 people who walk through the door will go to hell.
3. The last of the 7 people to walk through the door and leave the room gets out. 
4. At the end of 7 days if they refuse to go through the door they all go to hell. Meaning, if there are even 2 people left and that second-to last person refuses to go, they all go to hell, even the one who could have walked free.

They all call BS and argue the whole day, except for one woman who just cries because she wants to get back to her kids. They all go to sleep, agreeing to not go through the door. Except, she gets up in the middle of the night and walks through the door.

The next day they realize she is gone and are upset about it but they get on with their plan to find another way out. While they are lifting one of the men up to see if they can reach the ceiling (they can't see one), one of the young women is standing and watching and she hears more voices coming from the door. She listens closely and recognizes the woman's voice from last night! And she's screaming for help, telling them all to stay away. The girl outside screams when she hears it and that causes the group to drop the guy they were supporting, and he breaks his leg. The rest of the day is spent tending to his injury.


I didn't read any more chapters after that. I bookmarked it and everything but I went through every single bookmark from the last 3 years or longer, my entire account. Can't find it. 

If anyone can tell me ANYTHING about the story, the title, the author, where to read it, or even a link, that would be so amazing. I NEED TO FINISH IT! You know what I mean lol.
Thank you so much
