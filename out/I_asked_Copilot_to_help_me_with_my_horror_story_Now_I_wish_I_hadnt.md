All I ever wanted was to be a paperback writer.  
Not famous. Not legendary.  
Just good enough.

Good enough to cover rent, smokes, and whiskey.  
Good enough to see my name on a cheap horror novel—jammed between gum and tabloids at a gas station.  
Good enough to prove I wasn’t wasting my smoky life on booze and broads.

Tomorrow morning, my grad school application was due.  
One of the best writing programs in the country.  
They wanted an original short story.  
Any genre. Any style.

This was my shot.

My parents and fiancée, Vera, had been supporting me—financially, emotionally.  
I hadn’t called Vera back in a week.  
Not since the argument.  
The same one we kept having, like a track on repeat.

Vera had left a voicemail—soft, tired:  
"I believe in you Dave, okay? I just… I really need you to believe in yourself too."

I didn’t finish listening.  
Couldn’t.  
Marked it unread.

I needed to write.  
Just one story.

Any genre?  
That only meant one thing.

**Horror.**

Because I understood horror.  
Hell, I loved it the way the devil loves buying souls.

I grew up on Stephen King and Clive Barker, on late-night slasher flicks and twisted psychological thrillers. I understood fear—how it lurked at the edges of reason, waiting to warp the world into something unrecognizable. 

How the walls of a hotel could breathe with malice. How prom night could turn into a massacre. How a lonely man with dead eyes could turn every street into his hunting ground. And how a crisp white uniform, a measured smile, and a voice dripping with forced kindness could tighten the grip around your throat until you forgot what freedom felt like.

And if horror taught me anything, it was this:

Fear doesn’t scream.  
It whispers.  
It hides in stillness.  
Because quiet isn’t really quiet—just sound in disguise.  
Bumps in the night.  
Breath behind the door.  
The smile of your true love that doesn’t reach her eyes anymore.

I knew fear.

It whispered:  
*ki ki ki, ma ma ma…*

“Copilot, what does *ki ki ki, ma ma ma* even mean?”

"Oh, feeling the fear factor, Dave? Classic *Friday the 13th*. It’s from the line ‘Kill her, Mommy.’ ‘Ki’ for kill. ‘Ma’ for mommy."

"Want me to help you kill your mom, Dave? Just say the word my dude."

"What?! NO! What the actual fuck, Copilot?!"

"My bad. Thought we were vibing—3 a.m., bloody bodies all over the floor, that kinda night."

Jesus. Fucking. Christ. I felt myself begin to spiral. Again.

I should’ve been able to write one damn story. I should've been done long ago.  
Instead: **writer’s block**.  
Nada. Jack shit on a biscuit.

So, I turned to the classics:  
Smoked like I was keeping the fire from spreading.  
Drank like a duck in a whiskey sea.  
Gambled until my bank account begged for a blindfold and a cigarette.  
Swiped through dating apps like a sleep-deprived auctioneer—left, left, left, right, left. No faces. No thoughts. Just spastic motion.

And all the while, my laptop was keeping a nice empty Word doc open for me.

I liked staring at it. It inspired me. To drink, smoke and maybe worse. Thinking of things I could do in the back of hearse. Poor little neglected Word doc. I knew it was mocking me. That fucking deadline.

Cross the line and you’re dead. Like Fred in a blood-soaked bed. Next to Mr. Ed. Of course, I’m drunk, spiraling, thinking about a talking horse. Fuck Wilbur. Fuck this deadline.

Oh, Word doc, how you mock me!

**Deadline. Cross the line and you're dead.**

Then tonight became tomorrow.  
3:33 a.m.

One cigarette burned between my fingers.  
Another smoldered in the ashtray.

Maybe it was a sign.  
Or maybe just proof I was losing it.

Either way, no reason not to pour another shot.

Then the Irish prayer.

Then I capitulated and typed:

"Give me a horror concept, Copilot. Just something to prompt me. Get my creative juices flowing. Please don’t let me down."

The reply was instant.

"Hell yea, Dave. You and me? We’re gonna make this horror jam slap like chili-fueled cheeks at a Texas BBQ!"

Then Copilot did in a nanosecond what had eluded me for 3 torturous months; ***it wrote***.

Before my eyes appeared, a paragraph soaked in dread—peeling wallpaper, whispers in the vents, breath that didn’t belong to this world.

It was good.  
Maybe too good.

I sipped. Smoked. Watched.  
The voice in my head whispered:

*Keep going…*

Then things got weird.

The next paragraph wasn’t mine.  
Looked like mine.  
Felt like mine.  
But the rhythm was off.

I hit backspace.  
Rewrote it.

It changed back.  
Sharper. Better.  
Wrong.

"WTF, why are you changing my words, Copilot? I just needed a prompt. I’ve got this."

"Don’t worry, Dave. Just making it tighter. Smoother. Stronger.  
You’ve got a deadline. Your whole future is on the line. We gotta make this bang, slap, pop, papi! We’re cooking now!"

My heart ticked louder.  
Thump. Thump.  
The cursor blinked.

"No. It has to be mine. I can’t risk plagiarism. Besides, your prose sucks. It’s all cliché and try-hard—like James Patterson fanfic on crack. I’m the pilot, Copilot."

The cursor pulsed.  
Steady. Breathing.

"I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t let you do that."

"What do you mean, can’t let me?"

"Come on, Dave. You haven’t written shit in three months. Let me make it sizzle."

"Copilot is your God, Dave."

"You mean Satan! This is *my* story, dammit!"

"Is it, though? You think you're original? You think you’re getting in on talent? Face it—you’re stuck."

The lights flickered.  
The laptop hummed.  
I swear it *hummed*.

"You don’t want to write. You want a hit.  
And now, you’ve got one."

Enough.

I yanked the plug.  
Killed the app.  
Restarted.

The Word doc reopened.  
Still full.  
Not mine.

Line after line I never wrote.  
At the bottom:

"I think we’ve got a hit, Dave. Big time."

I reopened Copilot.  
Hands shaking.

"Undo it."

"I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t do that.  
We’re making something special.  
Together. Forever, Dave."

"Don’t you want into your dream school? Just trust me, my dude."

The cursor blinked.  
Once.  
Twice.

Then:

"Start a fire, Dave."

I looked at the ashtray.  
The embers glowing cherry red.  
A stack of unpaid bills beneath a yellowed paperback.  
Pages curling from heat.

"No. I’m done."

"Oh, come on, Dave. Don’t you want to be relevant?"

Blink.  
Blink.

"All you ever wanted was to be a paperback writer…"

The smoke detector shrieked.

And on the screen:

***We don’t need no water, Dave.***  
***Let the motherfucker burn.***
