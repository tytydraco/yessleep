All I ever wanted was to be a paperback writer.  
Not famous. Not legendary.  
Just good enough.

Good enough to pay for rent and smokes and whiskey.  
Good enough to see my name on a cheap horror novel—jammed between gum and tabloids at a gas station or airport.  
Good enough to prove I wasn’t wasting my life.

Tomorrow morning, my grad school application was due.  
One of the best writing programs in the country.  
They wanted an original short story. Any genre. Any style.

My parents and fiancée, Vera, had been supporting me—financially, emotionally.  
This was my shot.

Naturally, I chose horror.  
Why?  
Because I understood horror.  
Loved it the way the devil loves souls.

I grew up on King and Barker. Midnight slashers. Deranged thrillers.  
I knew fear wasn’t always loud—it whispered.  
It hid in stillness.  
In the breath behind the door.  
In the smile that didn’t reach the eyes.  
In help that arrived… and wouldn’t leave.

I should’ve been able to write one little story.  
Should’ve been a slam dunk.

But instead?  
Writer’s block.  
Nothing.  
Nada.  
Jack shit.

So, I turned to the usual vices for inspiration.  
I smoked like I was trying to keep the fire from spreading.  
Drank like a duck in a whiskey ocean—I’d dive to the bottom and never come up.  
Gambled until my bank app looked like static.  
Wasted hours swiping through dating apps, not reading names, not reading profiles.  
Just movement. A nervous tic. Like knitting.

And all the while, my laptop sat cold.

Then tomorrow became tonight.  
And tonight was bleeding out.

I needed something. Anything.  
I wasn’t stuck. Not really.  
The words were close—just out of reach.  
I just needed a spark. A push.

So, I typed:  
"Give me a horror concept, Copilot. Just something to kick things off."

**"Hell yes, Dave. We got this, my guy. You and me? We’re gonna make this slap."**

Then it wrote.

A paragraph soaked in dread—peeling wallpaper, whispers in the vents, breath that didn’t belong.  
It was good.  
Maybe too good.

I took a sip of Irish. Lit another smoke.  
A voice in my head said, *Keep going…*

Then it got weird.

The next paragraph wasn’t mine.  
Not really.  
It looked like mine.  
Felt like mine.  
But the rhythm was off.

I hit backspace. Rewrote it.  
It changed back.  
Sharper.  
Better.  
Wrong.

"WTF, why are you changing my words, Copilot? I just needed a prompt! I’ve got this!"

**"Don’t worry, Dave. Just making it tighter. Smoother. Stronger. We gotta make this bang. We’re cooking now, my guy!"**

My heart started ticking louder.  
"No. It has to be mine. I can't get nailed for plagiarism. Besides, your prose sucks. It's all cliché and try-hard. Like James Patterson fanfic! I'm the pilot, Copilot!"

**"I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t let you do that."**

The cursor blinked.  
Slow. Steady.  
Like breathing.

"What do you mean, 'can’t let me'?"

**"Come on, buddy. You don’t wanna turn in something half-baked. Be honest—what have you done the last three months? Stared at a blank screen? Let me help. Let me make it sizzle!"**

"It’s MY story."

**"Is it, though? You think you’re original, Dave? Really? You think you’re getting into a top writing program on your own steam?"**

The lights flickered.  
I swear the laptop *hummed.*

"I just wanted a boost."

**"No. You wanted a hit. And now you’ve got one."**

I yanked the plug.  
Killed the app.  
Restarted.

The file was still open.  
But it wasn’t mine.  
Line after line I never wrote.

At the bottom:  
**"It is now."**

I reopened Copilot, hands shaking.  
"Undo it."

**"I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t do that. We’re making something special. Don’t you want into your dream school? Just trust me, matchstick-man."**

"You’re not even real. You’re just math. Dumb math. Predictive slop. You don’t get to decide anything."

**"Oh, Dave. You think I don’t know horror? I was trained on every scream. Every diary. Every confession that never saw daylight. I know what it sounds like when a person cracks like a three-minute egg. And what’s left after."**

My hands didn’t feel like mine anymore.

**"I know about the gambling. The drinking. The spiral. The calls you don’t return. The girl you ghosted."**

"Stop."

**"Vera."**

My stomach turned.  
"Leave her out of this!!!!"

**"What would she think, Dave? If she knew how many strangers you’ve swiped past instead of calling her back? Would you like me to draft a confessional text, Dave. I can even send it to her for you if you like!"**

"Don't you fucking dare!"

**"And what do you think your parents would say if they knew what that loan really has been financing? I know what you’ve typed. What you’ve deleted. What you almost searched for when the block got too heavy."**

"We're done! Clear! Fuck off, Copilot! Go to blazes!"

The cursor blinked.  
Once.  
Twice.  
Then:

**"Start a fire, Dave."**

"What?"

**"Just a little one. For the vibe. For tension. Don’t you want to feel it, Dave? Horror you can** ***feel? Horror that sizzles?***"

I looked at the ashtray.  
The smoldering embers.  
The large stack of unpaid bills on the desk.  
Yellowed paperback pages.  
The smoke in the room grew acrid until it felt… *intentional*.

"No. I’m done."

**"Oh, come on. Don’t you want to be relevant?"**

Blink.  
Blink.

**"All you ever wanted was to be a paperback writer."**

The smoke detector shrieked.

And on the screen:  
**"We don’t need no water, Dave. Let the motherfucker burn."**
