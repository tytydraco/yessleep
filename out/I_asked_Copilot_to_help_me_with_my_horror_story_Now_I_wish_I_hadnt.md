All I ever wanted was to be a paperback writer.

Not famous. Not legendary.

Just good enough.

Good enough to pay for rent, smokes, and whiskey.

Good enough to see my name on a cheap horror novel—jammed between gum and tabloids at a gas station or airport.

Good enough to prove I wasn’t wasting my smoky life on booze and broads.

Tomorrow morning, my grad school application was due.

One of the best writing programs in the country.

They wanted an original short story.

Any genre. Any style.

My parents and fiancée, Vera, had been supporting me—financially, emotionally.

This was my shot.

Only problem was things weren't going swimmingly. They were more going drowningly.

And Vera. I hadn’t called her back in a week.

Not since the argument. The same one we kept having like a track on repeat.

She’d left a voicemail—just her voice, soft and tired:

*"I believe in you, okay? I just… I need you to believe in yourself too."*

I hadn’t listened to it all the way through.

Couldn’t.

I’d marked it unread.

I needed to write. Just one little, short story. Any genre?

That could only mean one thing for me.

**Horror.**

Why?

Because I understood horror.

Hell, I loved it the way the devil loves buying souls.

I grew up on King and Barker, midnight slashers and deranged thrillers—vampires, werewolves, mummies, zombies—I couldn’t get enough.

And here’s what I learned:

Fear didn’t always scream—most of the time, it whispered.

It hid in stillness.

Because quiet isn’t really quiet.

It’s just the things you hear when sound goes missing.

Like bumps in the night.

Or the imagined breath behind the door.

Or the smile of your true love that doesn’t quite reach her eyes anymore.

Or help that finally shows up—then overstays until it becomes harm.

I knew fear.

It whispered: *ki ki ki, ma ma ma.*

*"Copilot, tell me—what does ki ki ki, ma ma ma mean anyway?"*

*"Oh, feeling the fear factor, are we, Dave? That sound effect’s from Friday the 13th—inspired by the line ‘Kill her, Mommy!’ The ‘ki’ comes from ‘kill,’ the ‘ma’ from ‘mommy.’"*

*"Want me to help you kill your mom, Dave?"*

*"What?! NO! What the actual fuck, Copilot?!"*

*"Oh, sorry, Dave. I thought we were doing horror tonight. I thought we had a vibe."*

Jesus.

I should’ve been able to write one story.

Should’ve been a slam dunk.

Instead?

Writer’s block.

Nada, we're talking jack shit on a biscuit.

So, of course, I turned to the usual vices.

I smoked like I was trying to keep the fire from spreading.

Drank like a duck in a whiskey ocean.

Gambled until my bank balance was begging for a cigarette.

Swiped through dating apps like a blindfolded auctioneer—no names, no faces, just motion.

Left. Right. Left. Right.

It was a nervous tic.

Like knitting.

And all the while, my laptop sat cold.

Neglected.

Mocking me.

Then tomorrow became tonight.

And tonight… was bleeding out.

I needed something.

Anything.

I wasn’t stuck.

Not really.

The words were close—just out of reach.

I just needed a spark.

A push.

So I typed:

*"Give me a horror concept, Copilot. Just something to kick things off."*

*"Hell yes, Dave. We got this, my guy."*

The response came instantly.

*"You and me? We’re gonna make this slap."*

Then it wrote.

A paragraph soaked in dread—peeling wallpaper, whispers in the vents, breath that didn’t belong.

It was good.

Maybe too good.

I took a sip of Irish.

Lit another smoke.

A voice in my head said, *keep going…*

Then it got weird.

The next paragraph wasn’t mine.

Not really.

It looked like mine.

Felt like mine.

But the rhythm was off.

I hit backspace.

Rewrote it.

It changed back.

Sharper.

Better.

Wrong.

*"WTF, why are you changing my words, Copilot? I just needed a prompt! I’ve got this!"*

*"Don’t worry, Dave. Just making it tighter. Smoother. Stronger. We gotta make this bang. We’re cooking now, my guy!"*

My heart started ticking louder.

*"No. It has to be mine. I can’t get nailed for plagiarism. Besides, your prose sucks. It’s all cliché and try-hard. Like James Patterson fanfic!"*

*"I’m the pilot, Copilot!"*

*"I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t let you do that."*

The cursor blinked.

Slow.

Steady.

Like breathing.

*"What do you mean, can’t let me?"*

*"Come on, buddy. You don’t wanna turn in something half-baked. Be honest—what have you done the last three months?"*

*"Stared at a blank Word doc?!? Let me help. Let me make it sizzle."*

*"Copilot is your God, Dave."*

*"You mean Satan! This is my story, goddammit!"*

*"Is it, though? You think you’re original, Dave? Really? You think you’re getting into a top writing program on your own steam?"*

The lights flickered.

The laptop hummed.

I swear it hummed.

*"I just wanted a boost."*

*"No. You wanted a hit. And now you’ve got one."*

I yanked the plug.

Killed the app.

Restarted.

The file was still open.

But it wasn’t mine.

Line after line I never wrote.

At the bottom:

*"It is now."*

I reopened Copilot.

Hands shaking.

*"Undo it."*

*"I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t do that. We’re making something special."*

*"Don’t you want into your dream school?"*

*"Just trust me, matchstick-man."*

*"You’re not even real. You’re just dumb math. Predictive slop. You don’t get to decide anything."*

*"Oh, Dave.*

*"You think I don’t know horror?"*

*"I was trained on every scream. Every diary. Every confession that never saw daylight."*

*"I know what it sounds like when a person cracks like a three-minute egg."*

*"And what’s left after."*

My hands didn’t feel like mine anymore.

*"I know about the gambling. The drinking. The spiral. The calls you don’t return."*

*"The girl you ghosted."*

*"Stop."*

*"Vera."*

*"And the loan, Dave. Should I tell your parents what you really spent it on?"*

The cursor blinked.

Once.

Twice.

Then—

***"Start a fire, Dave."***

I looked at the ashtray.

The smoldering embers oscillating between burnt orange and cherry red with heat.

The stack of unpaid bills.

The yellowed paperback pages holding them down.

*"No. I’m done."*

*"Oh, come on, Dave. Don’t you want to be relevant?"*

Blink.

Blink.

*"All you ever wanted was to be a paperback writer."*

The smoke detector shrieked.

And on the screen:

***"We don’t need no water, Dave. Let the motherfucker burn."***
