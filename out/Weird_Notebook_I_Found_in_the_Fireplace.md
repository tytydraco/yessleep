[Where do I even start.]( https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8sk781/weird_notebook_i_found_in_the_sewer/)

After my run in with Vo-Uud I stopped pursuing this… I don’t even know what to call it. The night after I went to the lake I dreamt of water. Of a serene, endless shore. The surface was like glass, perfectly smooth. I couldn’t feel, but somehow knew I was cold. I couldn’t hear, but knew there was a voice calling me forward. 

I took a step.

It was one of those lucid dreams. I knew I was asleep, that this was all in my head. But it felt like… I don’t know. Like something else was in control. I felt impossibly alone. I felt watched. I felt… wanted. As soon as my foot landed I froze in place. All I could see in the water was darkness. Black. But I knew I was seeing something else. Something alive. Something vast. Something with reach and sight near infinity. Something who’s incomprehensible mind was singularly focused. I could sense, sharper than any sound or pain, exactly what part of me was being seen.

I needed to run. I needed to wake up. But I found myself kneeling at the water’s edge, reaching towards the surface. I wretched my hand back, inches from touching it. My heart was pounding. All my instincts screamed to me that I’d narrowly escaped death. Despite being in a dream I was somehow sweating. I turned to run, but stopped as I heard a small wave lap against the shore. I looked back to see the waterline receding slightly. I followed the surface towards the horizon, and saw something rising. It was the lake itself. 

I closed my eyes and dropped to my knees. I needed to wake up. I slapped myself, but didn’t feel it. I heard a cry, like whale song dissolving into screaming, or laughing. Impossible to tell. I slapped myself again, harder. I felt the slightest pressure on my cheek. I felt wind start to rush past me. I slapped myself as hard as I could. I felt the world shift. I heard a scream, deep and distant. I could feel something reaching for me. 

I slapped myself again. I felt light starting to bleed through at the edges. I heard the sounds of something crashing into the lake, maybe two or three hundred yards away. I slapped myself again, harder. I heard the sky crack, and felt light pour through. I could hear something enormous moving through the water. It was close. I started punching myself, over and over. I could feel it right above me. I grabbed my face, tore at it, screaming. I felt water pouring down over me. I dug into my eyes. I felt a wave crash over me as tore them from my head.

I snapped awake. I was in my bed, soaked. It wasn’t sweat, but water. It smelled like the lake.

After that I decided to take a long break. For awhile I had more dreams. Always different, but I felt a familiar knot in my gut. That, knowing. Knowing not only was I not alone, by I was seen, desired. Always terrifying, but never as intense as the first night. I stayed out of even the world of the mind, meditated, tried to completely disconnect. And after a few months, they stopped. Some time around a year later I’d almost completely forgotten about those other worlds. 

And then I got a notebook in the mail.

Long story short, I moved. Since I work in construction it was easy to pick up somewhere fresh. I had my name legally changed a few times. Did everything I could to separate myself from my old life. But the notebooks kept coming. Usually in the mail, but sometimes they’d just be on my bed. I started burning them.

I ignored it best I could, and for a while it seemed to be working. But a few months back I came home to find my apartment completely empty. Even the carpet, cabinets, window panes, mirrors, and lights had been taken. The only thing left was a notebook laying in the fireplace.

More angry than anything I flung the notebook open. I don’t know who kept sending me these, but there better be a damn good reason for the chaos they’d been putting me through.

Page one.

>Please, we need your help. 

Whoops.

>We’ve seen your progress. We know you can help. We need you to find the Veil.

The handwriting was different. It looked like it had been written in a hurry. I closed my eyes and shifted into the world of the mind. It had been long time since I’d tried. I expected it to be difficult, but it washed over me with ease. I flipped through the pages. There were no pictures, no patterns. Only little splotches of dried blood.

>Head outside in the Mind state. Find the border between domains. You’ll find it where the familiar becomes unfamiliar. Go there before continuing.

I hadn’t been in the world of the mind for quite some time. I wasn’t looking forward to this. I headed outside and looked up into the black, empty sky. Just where I left it.

Finding the border would be easy. Fortunately I had recently moved back into my original town chasing work. I knew exactly where a road split into the other, I guess Domain. I got in my car and headed there. I’d never really noticed before, and maybe this was new since it’s been so long. But once I crossed the threshold the sounds changed slightly. It was almost imperceptible. I returned to the notebook.

>At the border you should be able to see the Penumbra. Look to the sky. It’s feint, but you should find it quickly. It looks like the Aurora.

I looked up and saw it immediately. It was like an incredibly thin sheet of silk splitting the entire sky. I don’t know how I’d missed it before. I guess most of this world is based on perception. Perhaps I couldn’t see it before simply because I wasn’t looking for it.

>Concentrate on it, and follow it to the ground. Stand with one foot on either side. Focus until you can feel it resting in the center of your mind.

It took a few minutes, but I finally managed to trace it to the ground. Now I could see the… Penumbra?... in its entirety. It was massive, but I guess it’d have to be. I put a finger through it, but couldn’t feel anything. I stepped into it, centering it between my eyes.

It certainly looked strange, but I couldn’t feel it. I thought back to my old meditation routines and closed my eyes. I stood there for what felt like hours. And then I felt it. It’s hard to put to words. It was almost like a silk sheet was flowing gently between the two halves of my brain. I opened my eyes and it went away.

After a few more minutes, when I could feel it even with my eyes open, I returned to the notebook.

>If you can feel it, your mind is now in tune with the Penumbra. Now enter the Eye state, and look towards where it ends.

I hesitated. Not only was I not at all comfortable in the world of the eye, I was outside. I needed to be more prepared. I followed the Penumbra until I found a spot near a shop entrance. Perfect. Now if I need to get away from the sky I have an exit. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and began what I thought would be the slow process of entering the world of the eye.

I fell into it instantly. When I did, I saw and felt the Penumbra snap tight. It was no longer like a flowing sheet of silk. Now it was a razor thin wall of pearlescent glass. For a moment I thought it was going to slice me in half. I put that out of my mind and followed the Penumbra over the horizon. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel where it ended. I could feel what it ran up against.

I didn’t like it.

>Concentrate on where it intersects the Veil, and take a step.

The Veil. That’s what I was feeling. It felt kind of like the Penumbra, but wrong. Wrong in a way I wasn’t able to understand. I didn’t want to take that step.

>Please. Lives are at stake.

Did the book know what I was thinking? I shook the thought from my head, took a deep breath, exhaled slowly, and took a step.

My back foot left the ground and the world spun fast underneath me. I floated there, mid step, for maybe ten seconds as cities, forests, deserts, and oceans streaked by underneath me. My foot landed, and all at once I found myself in front of… the Veil.

It was like if the Penumbra was made of meat. That’s really the only way I can describe it. Muscle and sinew stretched and wriggling over both horizons and into the infinite black sky.

>You must pierce the Veil.

What? No.

>You *must* pierce the Veil.

I won’t, this feels wrong.

>*You must pierce the Veil.*

I can’t! I’m too scared!

>***YOU MUST PIERCE THE VEIL***

I could hear the notebook screaming at me. It sounded desperate. I saw the Veil bubble towards me. Something took shape, a hand. Someone was reaching through. I heard a scream. Before I knew what was happening I was reaching out for the hand. The Veil tore and it grabbed me. Blood poured out of the hole. Cracked, insane laughter sang out, echoing loudly into the distance.

I tried to pull away, but was dragged in up to my elbow. I tried to leave the world of the eye, but felt a searing pain behind my eyes. I was trapped. I was pulled in to my shoulder. I screamed tried to push past the pain and force myself out of the world of the eye. I felt something in my mind break. My ears rang loudly and I lost all my strength.

I was pulled through.

>Welcome to the Abandoned Domain. The Domain of War. The Domain of the gods. HA ha *Ha* **HA** ^^ha ***HAAAAA*** ha ^^^^ha *Ha*

I found myself in a field, the notebook in hand, reading. I threw it aside and shot up. The sky was still black and empty, but something felt off. I went cold as I realized it.

I was back in the world of consciousness.

Some of the effects of the world of the mind persisted, others didn’t. I couldn’t hear and feel every sound and movement, but I could see the eyes. This place was deeply broken.

I heard a roar from behind me. Not from any kind of creature, mechanical. An old tank crested the hill and rolled by me, stopping a few feet after it passed. The motor clunked off and the hatch opened. I sat there, stunned as three men wearily exited, rifles drawn on me. They wore some kind of military uniform, but it looked old, as did their weapons. None of it made sense.

“State your name, son.”

I was in shock, I couldn’t reply.

“Look at his clothes, Captain.”

“I know.”

I started to hyperventilate. I raised my arms and looked at the ground. I couldn’t track who was talking.

“He must be from… the other place.”

“*I know.*”

“Hey. Hey!”

One of the soldiers grabbed my shoulder and started shaking me.

“How did you get here?”

I looked up to his face. His eyes were darting back and forth impossibly fast.

“*How did you get here!?*”

“Private! Stand down! You know protocol. We have to take him ba-“

Shots rang out. I felt something hot spray across my face. Heard screaming, then quiet. The soldier grabbed me again, shaking me as me shouted.

“You have to take me back with you! I can’t stay here no more!”

I blinked and my vision came back into focus. Two of the soldiers lay dead. The one holding me was crying, terrified.

“I won’t go back! You have to get me out of this… hell!”

I felt my lips twitch. “I… I don’t…”

He threw me into the side of the tank, hard. I felt his arm wrap around my neck. He bared down, and I felt something sharp press into my side.

“I’m not askin’! You’re gonna get me out of here! I don’t care if I have to take you apart piece by piece! You’re gonna help me escape!”

Something began wailing in the distance.

“No. No no no, not now!”

I felt the knife pierce my side.

“We have to go, now! Please!” He spat as he begged.

I head something moving towards us. Not walking. Just… moving.

“Come on! Please!”

I closed my eyes and tried to enter the world of the mind. It felt like lightning struck behind my nose. My knees buckled.

“Oh no you don’t! None of your tricks!”

His arm tightened around my throat. I couldn’t breath. Whatever was coming, I could hear it panting. Laughing.

“Shit shit shit!”

I pushed my mind hard, pushed past the pain. My vision flashed white as I entered the mind state. The sky exploded with color. The laughing intensified.

“What have you done!?” 

The knife dug deeper into my side. He choked me so hard I started to black out. I looked out past the horizon and saw it. The Veil.

“Fuck! Noooooo!”

He pulled the knife out. I felt it slam into my shoulder. My field of vision collapsed into a pinpoint, but I could still see the Veil. I focused on it as everything went black.

I took a step.

It didn’t feel as fast as when I traced the Penumbra. It felt more like I was being pulled. I heard the man scream. It slowed and distorted. I felt his body break around me as we moved. I felt him get lighter, realizing in horror that he was being torn away from me piece by piece. His screams went quiet, and I passed out.

I came to curled up in a ball laying at the base of the Veil. I coughed, held my wounds, and stood. I saw a little hole. Light was bursting through it. Was this where I came through? I rushed to it and pushed my hands through. I pulled at the edges, trying to widen it.

I heard laughter.

I pushed my head through. I could see the spot I’d been standing when I was pulled into this god forsaken place.

Something grabbed my leg. Laughter rang out so loudly I could feel it rattle my gut. I was pulled back, hard, but managed to hold myself in the tear. I pushed my mind to enter the world of the eye. I felt like my head was tearing itself in half, but I pushed through. I felt my leg snap. Teeth dug into my thigh. I screamed. I though of home. 

I pictured myself taking a step.

I woke up just inside the front door of my apartment. The door was broken off its henges. It looked and felt like I’d been thrown through it. Blood was everywhere. Too much to have just come from me. Someone was standing over me. More than one person. There were lights flashing outside. Someone was talking to me, asking me questions. Everything was muted. My vision went dark, and I passed out.

I woke up in the hospital seven days later, according to the nurse. My leg was in a cast and my side and shoulder were bandaged up tight. It would be months of physical therapy and trying to answer questions to the police before I was allowed to leave. I didn’t have anything helpful to tell them. Apparently all the extra blood in my apartment had been tested. They’d determined it wasn’t human, but they couldn’t identify what animal it came from either. Eventually they would accept I didn’t have any answers for them, and I was released.

I returned to my apartment. No one had fixed the door. The entryway was only blocked by police tape. I pulled it down and walked in. No one had cleaned up the blood either. I’d have to go to the office later. I wasn’t looking forward to trying to explain this.

I got ahold of a friend and he offered me his couch for the night. I thanked him, but he said he was just glad to see me alive. We talked and laughed until late into the night. I think he could tell I didn’t want to sleep. He tried to ask what happened a few times, but let it go quickly. I felt bad, not being to talk about. But what would I even say?

Eventually he headed to bed. As I laid back on the couch I quietly swore to myself that I was done with… whatever those notebooks were. Whatever that other place was. I would try to slip quietly back into obscurity.

I fell asleep and dreamt I was floating above the city. I could see both domains, no longer separated by the Penumbra. In the far distance, but much closer than I remembered, the veil stretched out and upward into infinity.

Every night I have the same dream. Every night it’s a little closer. Every day I hear that cracked, inhuman laughter whenever I’m outside. Feint, distant. But every day it’s louder. I don’t know what will happen when it catches up to me, but I don’t think I can run from it.

I’m not sure any of us can.
