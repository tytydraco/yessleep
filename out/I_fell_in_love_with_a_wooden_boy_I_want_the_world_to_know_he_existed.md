All my friends were pointing and laughing as he came trodding down the street. His wooden feet clunked and clacked as he made his way down the street. 

One of the girls in our group wiped the snot from her nose as she sized up her target. As he came into range she flung a rock the size of a baby's fist at his wooden head. A hollow thud echoed around the street as he fell to the floor. 

“I told you he had an empty head,” shouts one of the girls as the rest fall around laughing. 

 My heart broke for him as I stood there watching as he tried to get back on his feet. He stumbled back and forth as he tried to steady himself on his bent wooden legs. The other girls jeered at me as I ran over to help him. 

His faded, painted face made his sad, weary voice sound lost. The only thing that looked real about him was deep, soulful blue eyes and even they seemed void of joy.



“My name is Lucy, what’s yours?”

The wooden boy looked away in embarrassment. 

“I don’t have a name,” said the boy as his blue eyes burned into mine. 

“Everyone’s got a name. Even my dog has a name.” 

“My father just calls me boy,” he says in a shameful soft tone.

 His wooden frame was warped and infested with woodlice from years of neglect. 

“I know what to call you. From now on, your new name will be Woodworm.” 

When I held out my hand to shake his hand, his eyes lit up. “It’s nice to meet you, Lucy,” he said as he gripped his cold wooden hand around mine. 

Days passed with no sign of Woodworm. I stood at the top of the street waiting for the sound of his wooden feet to come clip-clopping down the street. Instead, Woodworm's father came stumbling down the street drunk. 

“Have you seen your son, today,”

He looked at me cockeyed.

“Who are you?” he incoherently blurted. 

“My name is Lucy. I’m a friend of your son.”

“Who would want to be friends with that freak?” he said as he stumbled away mumbling to himself. 

Woodworm's father was the local carpenter and drunkard. When he wasn’t busy mending barrels for the brewery he was busy drinking it dry. You always hear him cursing as he staggers home at night with a belly full of whiskey ready to unleash what demons stir in his soul on poor Woodworm.  

The town was busy getting ready for the spring festival, and all the wives were busy scrubbing the year-old grime from the cobblestones. 

I cut left down by the old flour mill and made my way towards the field at the back of the church. As I neared the rusty iron gates, I got a strange smell of burning damp wood.

 When I crossed the clearing, the burning smell intensified. Across the field of bright blue wildflowers, I saw a group of boys dancing around an open fire as two other boys held Woodenworm over the flames. 

“Leave him alone,” I shouted while holding a thick tree branch above my head.

One of the older boys looked me up and down with contempt

 “This is none of your business. Now go home before we throw you on the fire with him.”

I brought the branch down on his brutish shaved head, knocking him to the floor. I swung the branch around like a crazy person hitting anything that got in my way.  
 
The boys left standing, picked their friends off the floor before making their escape from the field. 

I brought Woodworm to the river and threw water on his smouldering backside. 

“That should do it. Just a little scratch.” Woodworm looks to the ground in silent shame. 

“As the boys held me over the flame I wondered if the flames felt as nice as its glow,” he said as he looked down at his wooden hands. 

“Why does your father treat you so badly,” 

A sadness emanated from Woodworm's eyes. 

“My father and my mother couldn’t have kids so he made me. But when my mother got sick he blamed me for dying. He said I was an abomination that shouldn’t have existed. 

I took his hand and placed it on mine before kissing him softly on the cheek. “I’m glad you exist,” I whispered gently in his ear.

Today was the spring festival, and the people were busy getting their stalls ready. The fresh spring morning brought a happy vibe, and everyone was eager for the festivities to begin. Amongst the hustle and bustle, I caught two of the boys from yesterday whispering to each other before running down one of the side lanes. 

“Knowing those two, I’m sure they’re up to something,” I thought to myself as I followed discreetly behind them.

I followed the winding lanes to an old abandoned tannery and watched as they disappeared through a broken window. I run to the window and watch them scurry through the dark, damp building, laughing and hollering to themselves. 

The first thing that hit me was the unforgivable stench. I held my nose as I followed the sounds of laughter up a dilapidated staircase. I made my way down a narrow hall to a room with a large tanning pool in the centre. 

The same boys from before, along with some of my so-called friends, stood around jeering as they held Woodworm over the stinking, festering pool of sludge. 

“Go home, traitor. You’re not wanted here,” shouted one of the girls. 

“We want to know if it floats like a boat,” laughed one of the boys.

I puffed my chest out in defiance. “Put him down, or you’ll have me to deal with,” I screamed”

“What will you do? You're just a weak little girl.”

I walked over and punched the boy in the nose. He stumbled before dropping Woodworm to wipe the blood from his face. 


 “That’s the second time you’ve embarrassed me,” he bellowed as he came at me.

He grabbed my neck and squeezed it tight. I fought to get his hands off me, but his grip tightened around my neck.  I felt my legs go weak as I gasped for breath. I pushed and shoved when all of a sudden, he lost his footing and fell backwards into the pool of sludge.

Some of the boy's friends ran for home, while the others stood and watched as their friend struggled to keep afloat before he disappeared into the murky depths of the pool

I picked Woodworm up and we made a run for the woods. We both kept running and didn’t stop until we got deep into the woods

Too tired to keep going we stopped and huddled behind a tree.

 “We’re in trouble, Woodworm. I just killed that boy.”

 I felt his cold wooden arms wrap around my waist.

 “It was an accident, right,” he says softly. 

“That won’t matter to these people. Trust me. I know what they’re like.”

Beams of golden light shone through the branches as the sun started to set.

“Why are those boys so mean to me,” he asked with a saddened voice.

It’s because you are different and not like them. People in our town don’t like different.”

Woodworm looked up at me with sad blue eyes. 

“I dream about becoming a real boy. In the dream, there’s a beautiful woman with arms of fire, and she wraps them around me in a warm embrace,” he said in a soft broken voice. 

“You’re real to me,” I said as I drifted off to sleep. 

I woke to angry eyes staring down at me. I tried to scream, but they grabbed me and stuffed me in the back of a horse-drawn carriage. 

The carriage stopped in the middle of the town center. A crowd of people were waiting and started throwing rotten fruit as we emerged from the carriage. I saw my dad, who barely made eye contact as he hid behind his shame.

My heart started racing with dread when I caught a glance at the large stack of wood piled in the center of the town 

“What are you going to do to me? I didn’t do anything.” I pleaded

Three of the town elders sat at a makeshift bench, waiting to pass their judgment on me. They looked down on me from their pedestal of righteousness, judging me with their leering eyes. 

“For the murder of Mr Goldberts, son, what do you say in your defence?”

 I looked around at all the angry faces and realized my fate was already sealed. One of the boys from before stood by the bench and pointed aggressively towards me. 

“She did it. She pushed Henry in the pool.” A feeling of anger rose from the pit of my stomach. 

“He’s a liar. It was an accident. He was trying to kill me, I swear on it.” 

As I pleaded my innocence, a piece of rotting fruit hit me in the face. The crowd started shouting even louder. “Burn the murderer.”

Men in black hoods began pouring oil on the stacks of wood. The guy that grabbed me from the woods stepped out from the crowd with Woodworm in his grasp. 

“We believe this thing was with her when it happened.”

 He shoved Woodworm in front of the elders, who stared at him as if he was worthless. 

“What do you have to say for yourself?” He looked at me with sorry eyes before looking back to the bench. 

“I did it. I killed him. He was going to kill Lucy, so I pushed him.” 

The three elders started whispering back and forth. 

One of the girls that took the most pleasure in tormenting Woodworm stood from the crowd. 

“He’s telling the truth. I saw it myself. We need to burn him.”

The crowd jeered and hollered as the elders continued to whisper to each other. 

“We have made our decision.” 

Their eyes focused on Woodworm as he stood there shaking. 

“For the crime of murder, we sentence you to death. Take him away immediately.” 

I felt my heart snap in two as they dragged Woodworm to his death. I ran to the front of the screaming crowd. 

“Please, Woodworm, you can’t do this. You can’t leave me. Please, I love you.” 

He reached down his hand out close enough for me to touch the tips of his wooden fingers. 

“I’ll never forget you, Lucy. You made me feel like a real boy. I love you too.”

 I looked up at his sparkling blue eyes, and the painted-on smile disappeared. The tips of his fingers start to feel warm, and his cold, wooden hands turn silky soft. 

“Look at your hands, Woodworm.”

“What’s happening to me, Lucy,” he said as the momentary excitement was broken as the crowd pulled me back.

I stood and watched him turn from a broken wooden toy into a handsome blue-eyed boy, as one of the hooded men set the wood alight. 

The look of sheer terror on Woodworm's face sent me into a hysterical mess. I pleaded for them to let him go, but my words got lost amongst the roaring crowd. 

The crowd went silent as the fire engulfed his entire body, and his unmerciful cries rang out through the town. 

Some people gasped in horror as others walked away in shame. I stood there helplessly when all of a sudden, Woodworm's tortuous screams stopped. The flames started twisting around his body and a sudden calm appeared on his face.

Woodworm's eyes focused on something within the flames. He beamed a big bright smile as the figure of a beautiful woman appeared. Just like the woman from Woodworm’s dreams, she wrapped her fiery hands around him, engulfing his entire body. The fire quickly dissipates, and all that’s left is a smouldering pile of wood.

As I sat by the river, hoping to feel Woodworm's presence, I looked out over the blue fields and saw the figure of a beautiful woman and young boy dancing amongst the glow of the setting sun.

I write my story to let the world know that the blue-eyed boy I called my friend existed.
