It was routine for me.

Simple job. Get my stuff, go to the place, kill the pests, and get paid so I can keep the lights on in my shitty apartment.

All things I was used to. For 5 years, I've been an exterminator and if you ask anybody else, it's all I'm good for.

Well, this morning, phone rings, I pick up,

"Tugg's Merc-A-Bug, how could help you?"

"Uhh, yeah...We're looking to see about some coyotes in the woods behind the house. Think they got hold of the dog last week."

"Real sorry sir, biggest thing I kill are raccoons-"

"I'll pay double. Please."

I wasn't a "traditional" exterminator by any means. I barely used the gas anymore and I'm not a cage type of guy. So, I deemed this a fair exchange for my services.

"Alrighty, sir. Could I get an address on that?"

"Okay...213...Sawyer Way. How soon could you come?"

"I'll be by later today around three."

The familar sound of the dialtone hit me.

"Damn it. He had better pay up front."

‐--------------------------------------‐-----------‐-------------------------------

Then, I headed out around two cause Sawyer Way was practically in across state lines. 

Along the way, I was flashed by a bright detour sign. Police and ambulances lined the front of the bridge. Smoke floated up into the sky billowing from one of the overturned cars.

The damn detour was gonna make go around the river. I was gonna be late but they were gonna have to wait.

I was two hours late. By the time I got to the house, the sun was already set and the one street light was already on.

I got out of the van and knocked on the door.

"Hello? Exterminator?"

I was standing there awkward and piegon-toed. The wind nipped at my face so I knocked again.

"Hey! Tugg's Merc-A-Bug! You called me about the  coyote problem!"

Nothing. The lights inside were off. The car was in the garage. I felt like I was being punked.

I was about to just leave and get something to eat until I accidently kicked over a potted plant.

Shit. I'm not gonna for any damages. Until I saw an index card lying face down in the yellowed grass.

I picked it up, "Left for groceries. We think they're going back into the woods near where the old warehouse is."

Bunch of fucking help he is.

I got back in the van and drove down a road that probably hadn't been paved since '62. And after a mile or two of driving, I arrived at this old warehouse.

Right away, I found some tracks off into the brush.

Then, they disappeared. And then, the same thing.

Again and again. By now, it was nightfall. You could hear a mourning dove every now and then, maybe a bullfrog far off in the distance. 

Even with the floodlights from my van, it was starting to get a little tense out there. As stupid as it should sound, I was and currently am afraid of the woods. Despite I am what some call, "an outdoorsman".

About 200 yards from me in the woods, I hear a quick yelp quickly disappear. I shoot up and move further in. 

*FWOOM*

*CRACK*

I hear a limb crash down from the other side of my van. I slowly get over there. My hands were getting numb from grabbing my rifle.

There it is right there at my feet. A dead coyote. Not just dead. Mangled. Everything tangled into a strange mass, it's eyes were straight open, wide.

Fuck. This.

I jet into my van and turn the key. Nothing. It wasn't even trying to start. I slammed the dash in frustration, my Ice Cube bobblehead toppling into my center console.

"Come on!" "Come on, you son of a bitch, start!"

Then, the engine roars to life, the radio still playing  "Photograph" barely audible over static. 

I slam my foot on the gas and speed down the old road.  Thoughts were racing. One most than the others was, " Where is that family?"

I make a sharp left towards their home just I see a silver Honda Oddessy pull into their driveway.

I stomped the brake just short of their mailbox and stormed up to who I assumed to be who I talked earlier.

"Where the hell were you!?"

"Woah, look. Didn't you read our note?"

"Yeah, I did! Look, you can have a full refund! Just let me leave!"

But the man didn't budge. I told about the coyote seemingly becoming mutilated out of nowhere only to be stared at with either disgust or a strained look of skepticism. 

Him and I argued for almost 5 minutes with his family standing right there in the driveway. Out of nowhere, we heard it.

*SCRAWWW*

It echoed through the hills and reverberated with fear. 

In an instant, the family instructed me to come inside, blank faced. Of course, I didn't reject.

We sprinted down to the cellar and the whole family sprang into different acts.

The man pushing a heavy wardrobe in front a small window.

His wife was pulling a secondary mesh shutter over the basement door.

And his two children were setting up cots and blankets on the chilly concrete floor.

"What the fuck is going on! What have you gotten me into!?"

"We don't what it is! It started showing up two months ago! It claws at our house! It killed our chickens, our cat, our dog!"

"You lying shit! How could you lie to me!"

"We thought you could take care of it! That's the only way I could think of to protect them!"

Upstairs, there's a massive crash.  Loud skitters is all we can hear, baring on the hardwood floor. The thing chitters near the cellar door and we all looked at each other and silently prayed that we would make it to see another sunrise.

Then, it goes quiet. Nobody breaths. Everyone is motionless. My head is about to burst. All I could think of was how nobody would remember me or care that I was gone. I was going to die there and it would be like dust to the wind.

We were huddling together cause that we think we're okay. The kids were in tears. Mom is gripping their shoulders so hard, they're turning white. And the man is stone-faced but his eyes are bloodshot and misty. This was horrible. I didn't care what was outside. I couldn't sit here and watch them suffer.

It bursts through the ceiling and rolls behind the stairs while the wife gets pinned under sheets of wooden planks and debris.

It was so ugly. It was so horrible. It was a massive bug. A big indescribable manhunting bug. It leaned back upwards and overturned to look at the mother who was staring me dead in the eyes.

It made a multitude of clicks and other noises before it shot a net of piss-yellow silk all over the mom and the basement exit. 

Everyone was frozen, nobody could react.

The father grabbed my rifle from the wall and fired directly at the bug's middle.

It shrieked at him as it bled profusely.

"Grab the kids and run." 

He said it so calmly and at peace that I reacted instantly.

Out of the corner of my eye, before I ran through the thick web, was the man cowering as the insect unearthed 2 pairs of massive butterfly wings and lunged towards him.

I had the boy and girl by the wrists and quickly threw them in the back of the van.

They were both crying loudly now. There was no consoling I could do. I slammed on the gas and sped down the road. In the rear view mirror, I saw the bug smash through the roof and begin to fly off into the sky.

"Listen, don't worry! We're gonna be fin-

We were rammed at around 90 mph and got spun out into a rocky ditch. I tried to reverse out of it but it was no use.

I looked out the passenger side window only to see a small cubicle car being torn open by that thing.

The older woman who was driving it ran down the road and was then flown away by the bug fast as I don't know what. I felt so hopeless. We were stuck in the ditch for what felt like hours all the while I was still trying to get out. 

Then, by some miracle from above, the van managed to back out without much more damage. I continued down the desolate strech of road until I made it to the interstate.

It was smooth from there. Sarah and Walt are the kids' names and happen to be irish twins. I managed to get them not to think about their parents for the ride to the next town. I called 911 on the road and informed them on what happened at 212 Sawyer Way. 

Only two days passed before the investigation was closed and I was given a generous amount of money to say that the destruction and casualties that day were caused by a natural gas explosion. It was on the national headlines for about a week.

Sarah and Walt were given to their grandmother in Connecticut due to their mother being comatose and their father having not survived the bug attack.

I was doing alright, I could say. The thought of that day didn't cross my mind until the day of my accident. The Lexington Bridge Collapse. I was left paralyzed from the waist down and being left with free time, I surfed the web frequently.

Until today. The reason I decided to even post this in the first place.

In the photo of Lexington Bridge moments before its collapse, was the unmistakeable shape of the bug perched on top of one of the suspension wires.

Knowing I would be led into its trap one last time.
