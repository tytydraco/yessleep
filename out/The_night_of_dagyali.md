In a small village wrapped in superstition, a boy once sat with his mother as she spoke of dayans.
“Women who die in childbirth,” she whispered, “their souls wander restless. They are dayans, hungry for life stolen from them.”

The boy, malicious at heart, did not tremble. He smiled. If such a spirit existed, I would command her. I would make her mine.

The next day, he sought answers from the village gur, a priest who was keeper of sacred rituals. But the gur, sensing darkness in the boy’s intentions, cursed him under his breath and sent him away.

Yet someone else was listening. The gur’s estranged younger brother—a man shunned for his cruelty—approached the boy in secret. His eyes gleamed with malice as he whispered,
“You wish to control a dayan? I know the ritual. But what you summon may be… more.”

That very night, they went to the shamshan, where smoke from funeral pyres lingered like ghosts. The boy followed the brother’s chants and lit the offerings. But unknown to him, the brother began his own ritual beside him, calling not for a dayan—but for something far more ancient. The Dagyali.

The boy’s incantations awakened a dayan, who rose weeping from the ashes. Just as he turned, confused and trembling, to ask what to do next—he felt a knife pierce his chest. The gur’s brother had sacrificed him, for the Dagyali demanded blood to awaken.

As the boy’s cries faded, the dayan shrieked and lunged at the murderer. He ran, stumbling through the night, until he splashed across a river. The dayan, bound by death, clawed helplessly at the riverbank—unable to cross. The man laughed cruelly and spread lies in the village: “The dayan killed the boy.”

But when the gur arrived at the scene, he felt the air heavy with a darker presence. His brother’s eyes no longer looked human. Something peered through them. The gur knew he could not face this alone—so he left the village in secret, seeking help.

Without him, horror bloomed. Cattle vanished. Their carcasses returned mutilated, throats torn as if by unseen beasts. At night, villagers whispered of shadows moving under the peepal tree. Women swore they heard a wet chewing sound in the fields.

One night, a woman saw her calf dragged away by a black figure with glowing eyes and a mouth that stretched impossibly wide. The village shuddered in fear. They knew now: Dagyali had awoken.

The gur’s brother smashed temple idols and declared, “This is no demon! She is our ancient goddess! Worship her—or be destroyed.” The people, terrified, obeyed in silence, for he had grown too powerful.

But Dagyali was not loyal. From behind the peepal tree, she whispered to him in a voice like grinding stone: “Bring me a child.”

The man agreed—but fate betrayed him. While he prepared to sacrifice a villager’s child, Dagyali crept into his own home. His wife awoke to a nightmare: a monstrous, pitch-black figure, its jaws splitting wider than her body, cradling their newborn before vanishing into the dark.

The brother’s rage turned to despair. He knew only one way to kill Dagyali—by destroying the bones of the first boy he had sacrificed. He ran to retrieve them. But when he arrived, Dagyali was already there, feasting upon his infant in a trance.

He collapsed, weeping, begging forgiveness. Dagyali turned, her maw dripping red, and leapt upon him. His screams echoed through the village until they broke into silence.

That same night, the gur returned with six other priests, each bearing an enchanted blade. The battle was fierce—flames, mantras, and shadows tearing through the village. Dagyali shredded six of the gurs before the last, bleeding and broken, cast the boy’s bones into the fire. The demon split apart in flames.

But victory came at a price. All seven gurs perished, their blood soaking the earth. The village was saved—but haunted forever.

Even today, on the August eclipse, villagers place thorny shrubs outside their doors, for they believe the Night of Dagyali still stirs. And sometimes, when the wind howls through the peepal trees, cattle refuse to move.

As if they still see something the living cannot.
