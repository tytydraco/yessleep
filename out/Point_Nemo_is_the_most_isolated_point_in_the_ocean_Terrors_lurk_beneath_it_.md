A couple of weeks passed without incident. I got deep into my research, taking water samples, testing the amount of micro-organisms and other boring science shit that I know nobody reading this cares about. I was starting to get more familiar with the rig and those on it, though it was taking some getting used to.

Flam was… well, Flam. He was a weird dude, extremely neurotic and always seemed like he was spaced out. Shannon was uptight as hell, usually more likely to bitch at anyone in range than be anywhere near helpful. Hap was nice, though I think he kept trying to awkwardly hit on me without realizing I wasn’t too interested in men. Can’t say I blame him though, it gets lonely out here.

Sandy ended up being one of my greatest comforts out on the cold ocean. In the evenings we would sit out on the platform, watching waves pass by as the sun set on the horizon. Despite everything I had seen out here so far, it was calming, almost serene when it looked like this. I was just losing myself in the sunset, gazing off into the distance when suddenly a skunky smell hit me, almost knocking me back to my college days.

”How did you get weed out here?” I asked, turning to look at her lighting up a joint. All she did was laugh at me.

”Why, you a cop now?” She said back. We passed it back and forth, laughing as the plant took more of an effect. At some point Shannon walked out, though all she could do was be disapproving and tell us that we shouldn’t be doing that here. Sandy’s retort made me laugh even harder, “We’re on maritime law, babe. Nothing illegal out here.”

Shannon only shook her head, looking directly at me before walking down to the living quarters, “Remember we’re taking a dive tomorrow morning. I don’t want you fucked up when we go down.”

I saluted, giving a stiff ‘Aye, cap’n’ as she walked off in a huff.

”Nervous about going down there?” Sandy asked me now, getting serious again.

”A little. I know we’re not going too deep for this one, but it’s still a little terrifying, y’know?” I replied, looking out at the reflecting sun as it dipped below the horizon line. In a little over twelve hours I would be taking our small submersible down to the Twilight zone, almost two thousand meters to see what kind of organic life is down there. I might have been a little excited, because there was always the possibility of discovering some new species. Wonder if they would name it after me…

Sandy and I shot the shit for a while longer before finally heading to bed, Hoping to get some at least decent sleep before reaching the dark depths.

I slept fitfully that night, in fear of what we may find down there. I hadn’t seen the giants again, but that giant eye through the porthole the other day was still haunting me every time I tried to close my eyes. All I could hear was its voice, telling me to join them in the depths.

After one of the worst nights of sleep I’ve ever had, we started loading in. The submersible was cramped, with stale air being pumped through for ventilation that left me sweating. Flam and I went down together, with Shannon and Hap staying back up with Sandy as our comms. The only window was at the very front, a small porthole with an incredibly limited view of only what was directly ahead. Maybe the worst part was that other than the console lights and a couple of low red accent lights to see by, this thing was completely dark. I felt like I was crammed into a can, and my claustrophobia was… not doing well.

The descent was fine, nothing out of the ordinary at least. We went in phases to be safe, dropping a few hundred meters at a time before stopping for a few minutes, making sure there weren’t any issues with the submersible. I kept looking over at the small hatch that we clambered in through, a bulkhead and multiple thick seals keeping us from the massive pressure outside. Every damn creak this thing made as we descended I expected to be liquefied where I sat, lost forever to the depths outside. Even in the stuffy air of the sub, I was getting a chill.

”Approaching 1500 meters.” Shannon’s voice coming over the small radio, “Reaching target depth in about five minutes.”

”Thank you.” Flam said, flipping a couple of switches and pushing the shift further. I don’t know if that’s what it was, but it looked like there was a flightstick installed to control this thing. Better than an xbox controller, but still…. “Ellie, turn on the outside cameras please.”

”Copy that.” I said, flipping around buttons in front of me. The three screens in front of me flashed on, eight different feeds popping up. We had wide-angle cameras on the port and starboard side, one at the top and bottom of each end of the sub. All the corners were coverd, giving us a full view of everything within our radius. “Cameras on, powering on lights.”

The lights outside came on, flooding the ocean darkness around us. Despite the output of the lights, strong enough to light a damn fire back on land if you left it on for too long, we were only able to pierce the abyss so far before losing sight. That was when I saw movement right off the edge of our front starboard camera. My heart skipped a beat, amazed we found something already as we had barely reached depth at this point.

”There’s something out in front. Go forward toward starboard.” I told Flam, trying to study what was there just at the edge of our visibility. Flam moved us forward, slowly so as not to scare whatever it was off. Unfortunately whatever it was dashed off, but on the screen as it ran away, it almost looked humanoid, dashing off like an olympic swimmer. “You see that?”

”Yes, it’s much faster than us though.” Flam said, still pushing the flightstick down, propelling us deeper. “Still not there yet.”

”Uh. We’re at two thousand, Flam. Think we’re deep enough for what we’re after.” I said, looking over at him with anxiety rising. “How much is this thing rated for?”

”Five thousand meters.” He replied, muttering some sort of calculations under his breath while still descending. “I know we’ll find it…”

”Shannon, Flam is going even deeper.” I said, breathless into my radio. My heartbeat was picking up, tension rising as Flam didn’t even react to my message. “Any idea what’s going on?”

”Flam, where are you going?” Shannon asked, concern rising in her voice. “You need to come back to target depth. We haven’t done prep for a deeper dive right now.”

”We’ll come back up quickly. I just need to check something.” Flam muttered again, flipping the radio off so Shannon couldn’t interject.

”Woah, okay. Flam, we need to go back up. You’re not thinking straight.” I said, moving forward to flip the walkie back on. He smacked my hand away, turning with a wild eye reflecting the intense red light of the cabin. I almost fell back from just how much he startled me. Flam may have been a little odd, but usually he was a gentle person, more awkward and introverted than anything. “Flam, what the fuck are you doing?”

”They told me I’m welcome in the depths.” He said, turning back to the small window and looking out ahead. “I have to see them.”

”Okay, that’s not a good idea, man. Come on, you take monitors, I’ll take pilot. Let’s switch.” I said, moving to take the console. I felt a sharp pain in my arm, looking over to see he had stabbed me with a lab scalpel he had smuggled on board.

”I have to see them.” He reiterated. “The last place uncorrupted by humans. They’re waiting for us.”

He pulled the scalpel from my arm, pointing it at me in warning before turning back to the console. I fell back to the floor, clutching the wound and trying to stem the bleeding. Thinking quick, just trying to live while I still could, I tore my shirt off and wrapped it around the wound, pulling my makeshift tourniquet tight. 

”Stop. Take this privilege.” Flam was shouting back to me now, voice getting higher and more raving mad with every second that passed. “They’ve promised to show me knowledge that humans could only dream of, things that we’ve had questions for thousands of years! You would pass up this kind of opportunity?!”

“Yes! We’re going to fucking die down here you idiot!” I was shouting again. The monitors were flickering, cameras unable to sustain integrity at the increasing depths without proper protection. I could hear the hull clanging as it bent and expanded, trying to keep integrity in the crushing abyss. “Flam, what the fuck has gotten into you!”

”Shhhh look!” He said, pointing through the front window now. Beyond him, I could see something in the distance, coming into view better as we got closer. 

“What the hell is this?” I was looking downard, our submersible pointed toward the depths as he cut off our lights, plunging us into complete darkness. My eyes took a moment, unable to cut through the most complete, terrifying void of nothing I’ve ever seen. Suddenly something far below us started to glow, starting faint but getting brighter and brighter as it spread, soon covering the entire sea floor. Cracks and veins ran through the light, all meeting in one central point, flowing towards a deep, dark chasm it circled around.

My first thought was bioluminescent microorganisms, because we find that all the time on in the abyssal zone. This though, had to be far too large. It would comprise miles and miles of organisms, all glowing in time with each other before stopping at this one, deep, pit. It was going further than I could see through the viewing window, off to drop further into the depths below.

It blinked.

At least, I assume it blinked. The glowing purple came rushing closed from opposite sides, meeting completely over the pit and plunging us into darkness for a moment. When it opened back up almost immediately, I could feel a shockwave hit the submersible moments later. The chasm in the middle started narrowing to a ravine, a deep glow coming from the furthest depths. It reminded me of a cats eye, but the glowing purple started becoming a deep red. All I could feel from this thing was an intense hatred, like we were bothersome and waking it from a deep nap. 

I acted as soon as I possibly could, grabbing the small fire extinguisher we kept at the back and hitting Flam right from behind with it. Thank god it knocked him out immediately, and I was able to take the flight stick, pulling back as hard as I possible could to return to the surface. The narrowed slit kept watching us as we made the ascent, me praying to whatever gods may be on the surface that it didn’t decide to come after us. This damned thing must have taken up most of the sea floor, whatever it was.

Flam was grumbling beside me now, saying something that didn’t even sound like a language I knew of. As we rushed to the surface, hull clanging and banging the entire way, I could finally see light beginning to break through the depths, strands of sun filtering down to guide our way. Flipping the comms on, I immediately heard Shannon shouting through the radio, demanding to know what had happened and if we were still alive.

”Flam tried to fucking kill us.” I said, still pulling back as he started coming back to his senses. He looked like he didn’t know where he was or how he got there, now mumbling in perfect English about how much his head was pounding. “We’re resurfacing. I’ll fill you in once we get there.”

We pulled up to the surface, Sandy grabbing the sub with the lift on the platform as we got near. As soon as I felt the thump of us settling on the platform, I threw the hatch open and ran out to sweet surface air. The salty smell of the ocean was one of the most relieving things ever, but knowing that thing was down there… god. I started babbling to Sandy almost immediately when she ran over, pulling me in to a hug as I started crying. 

Shannon called in a med evac for Flam, who couldn’t remember a damned thing since the night before. It’s like he wasn’t even in control, that knock to the head sorting out whatever short circuit was happening. The chopper picked him up a few hours later, still babbling about how he wasn’t sure what happened, waking up in the sub as we were tearing through the ocean for the surface. All he could remember was looking out of the porthole in the living quarters last night, his usual routine to relax before falling asleep. He said the last thing he remembered was seeing something out there looking back at him.

I gave Shannon and Hap a full run down, disclosing to the med team that yes, I may have given him potential brain damage. None of them were mad, considering the circumstances, but I think Shannon was suspicious. Can’t say I blame her. I told her all about what we saw, but her hard skepticisim wouldn’t. take the idea of an eye covering most of the seafloor.

Sandy believed me, thank fuck. When we talked about it that night, laying in my bunk, I was sobbing uncontrollably because I felt like I was going fucking insane. After I descr4ibed it to her though, she surprised me.

”I’ve seen it too.” She whispered, looking me in the eye from across the pillow. “Not like you have but… in dreams. It talks to me sometimes, tells me to swim down to it, feel the embrace of the oceans… I don’t like it.”

”There was so much… hate in it though?” I said, grasping for whatever words I could through deep, anxious breaths. “It looked like it had nothing but loathing for us. The giants were indifferent, but this thing was angry that we were there.”

”Sshhhhhh. It’s okay.” She said again, brushing my hair away from teary eyes. “You’re going to be okay. It won’t come up here.”

”What if it does though, Sandy? It was… it’s probably bigger than an entire fucking continent. What if it does come up here?! We’ll all die, Sandy!” I was almost screaming, seeing Hap come around the living quarters hallway with concern on his face. Sandy just shooed him away, making a motion that she had everything handled.

”If it does, not much we can do. But we can face it together.” She said, looking deep into my eyes. It was the first comfort I had felt since arriving, before seeing what depth of insanity was out here. She kissed me, holding me tight as I fell asleep.

——-

A week later, and I’m still holding in there. The eye still looks into me from my dreams every couple of nights, but Sandy’s been keeping me company, comforting me through the nightmares. I’m not really for all the romance stuff but… she had me. Something about her just set me at ease whenever I was on edge, no matter what kind of stress I was under.

We were hanging out on the deck that night, sparking up again and watching the stars play off the waves as the night grew longer. I thought at first that I was seeing a star on the horizon, falling toward earth, but after a moment she noticed it too, standing up and looking out toward the horizon.

A pyre of flame was heading our way, roaring over the ocean and boiling the waves as it went. I could see huge sails with a jolly roger emblazoned on a flag high above, the flames burning it but never making it fade. It kept getting closer and closer, threatening to ram us at high speed as the two of us started screaming for the others to wake up and get ready for impact. 

Their screams were audible over the crackling timber and whooshing flames as it came near, and both of us looked back when we heard them. Dozens of people were standing out on the deck of the ship, all doused in flames, burning high into the air alongside the lumber around them. Some were dancing, others were writhing in agony, but all were screaming and shouting to the high moon above like banshees in the night. It was coming at us, speeding ever closer and accelerating the entire damn time. There was nowhere to go, just Sandy and I stuck here against the platform railing as far as possible from the sailing inferno. We hugged each other tight, closing our eyes in preperation to be tossed into the waves by a burning juggernaut. 

It never happened. The ship passed straight through us like we weren’t even there. We could feel heat of flames, the screams whipping by us as it pulled our screams with it, joining the cacophony of hell on the waves.

Then it was gone, racing the other way across the sea towards another destination, screams trailing behind as it sunk over the horizon, water reflecting the pyre even after it was out of sight. 

“Did you guys hear that?” Hap said, coming up from the living quarters and rubbing sleep from his eyes. “Damn, it’s hot down there too. Sounded like a bunch of screaming, did something hit us? Is there a breach?”

Sandy calmed him before he got panicky, looking at us in the night, “Just us, don’t worry. All good out here.”

”Oh, okay.” Hap said, starting to turn for the door before letting out a sudden, understanding “OH!” 

“Not like that!” Sandy said, shooing him back down to the living quarters as he laughed. We held each other, looking off into the night where the ship had disappeared to before she spoke, “Gonna be honest, that was a new one for me.”

”Jesus christ.” Was all I could say, heart still racing as I tried catching my breath. She pulled me closer, brushing my hair back over my ear and humming low, a soothing melody as the night returned to peace, completely undisturbed by the death that just roared [through](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/qWzw5yMBC0).
