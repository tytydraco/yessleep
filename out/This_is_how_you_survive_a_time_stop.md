I'm quickly typing this out as fast as I can before I lose my memory of the place so please don't mind my writing. To the people who have just been back from Time stop you will probably know what I'm talking about and if you remember anything please please add anything that could help and your experience for the newer people in the comments. I'm actually surprised by how little information there is on the internet but it is not surprising, not many people retain their memory and those who do only remember for a day at most.

Now for those who don't know please read carefully, this is what you do if you happen to become a part of the time stop.

To explain quickly, randomly the time stop completely, but for some reason beyond my understanding only a few unlucky people are no paused. Then this hole? ( I myself am not sure of what it is) will appear in a random part of the world and everyone will jump into it. Don't worry about that for now or how to get there, your gut feeling will guide you what you should worry about is surviving the passageway to the hole, the hole is a gateway to another place it is safe, don't hesitate just jump. Then after some time the time unpause and we return to how it was before losing our memory of the time stop after we return, If you survive of course. Any death during the time stop will result in your death after the pause.

When the time stop don't panic, don't make a noise, if someone calls, you don't respon, pretend to be frozen in time. Don't ever EVER answer back. It's a classic way to fall trap to it. The voice will be of someone you know but you will have to ignore it, freeze then continue when nothing is there. If you encounter the "thing" ( I do not know what it is but when you see it you will definitely know) freeze, stay still and close your eyes as if your paused during a blink so you can be more still. Hold your breath if you can.

Staying still is your best friend 

Make sure to pack something before you go traveling to the hole will take months or even up to a year in some case to reach it. Here is something I suggest you to pack.

- matches or any lighting source
- water bottle
- sunglass (the hole can be located somewhere there is snow, take it to protect eyes, it's not heavy just bring it)
- knife
- container to hold things especially those foldable groceries bag will be great

Do not bring a torch, no phone, no guns, or anything that will make too much noise or light. Travel light you will be walking for a long time and food can be taken from stores unless the hole is in an isolated place then pack at the nearest source. Be mindful of where you sleep make sure it is in an inclose space.

NEVER EVER LIGHT A FIRE, LIGHT IS A BIG NO NO. The night sky is brighter than you think or travel during the day only.

If you see a person ignore them, it can both be a time stopper or the thing it is best to avoid anything that moves until you'er nearer to the hole.

Surviving this stage is the hardest. The disasters you see in the news are no coincidence, they are people who did not survive the passageway. Recently a large time stop group in Japan tried to study the thing so we all could finally understand this strange world we live in, and look at how that turned out. 

Everyone has the potential to get sucked into time stop, be ready when it arrived. My first time was when I was 15, I was an international student in an Indian boarding school, it's quite a large school and there's a path in the woods we call the wood's way (just a shortcut to get to the dinning hall) I was on my way to dinner alone and did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I was lucky then that at that time I was not the only time stopper in the area. It was my senior's first time too but he wasn't so lucky. It was beside our art building where he encountered the "thing" I was lucky my fright response was to freeze so I watch the "thing"   consume my senior. It wasn't violent, my senior simply dissolved as if he wasn't there to begin with. When back, he later disappeared on our camping trip, back then I did not remember, I found it strange that a kid in our school would suddenly go missing. I wasn't particularly close to him I only know who he is so I wasn't really affected when they reported that he fell down a cliff. But now I remember and it shook me of how fast it had been if he had stayed still then maybe he would've been alive. Another loss is a friend of mine I know from the second time stop I had I met her during the passage way and we became friends. It was her first time stop.

It was the thing that took her. Everything is because of the thing. It's the thing. The thing is the cause of all pain. The thing The thing The thing. 



That is all I can remember, this is my third Time stop. I am so tired. When will this end. I can feel myself forgetting the events, if any time stopper who still retains a bit of their memory sees this post, I ask you again to help add anything that can be helpful to others, I can not stand this anymore, even if I will forget soon, now in the state that I still remember I need to warn others, I can not stand by knowing that there is something I can do to help. 

I wish you all luck and see you again when the Time stop.
