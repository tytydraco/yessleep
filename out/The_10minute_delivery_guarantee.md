It was a lazy Saturday night, and I was starving. I grabbed my phone, found a new pizza place called “10-Minute Delivery,” and thought, *Why not?* The promise was bold—if they didn’t deliver within ten minutes, it was free.

I hit order.

Exactly two minutes later, my doorbell rang. I froze. Two minutes? That had to be a mistake. I opened the door, and there he was—a delivery guy, eyes sunken and deadpan, holding a pizza box.

“Uh, that was fast,” I said, half-joking.

“No time to waste,” he replied, thrusting the box into my hands before walking away. No small talk, no tip. Just gone.

I shut the door and set the box on the kitchen counter. The box was covered in strange symbols, not the usual cheesy pizza place logo. I brushed it off, too hungry to care. But when I opened the box, I found no pizza—just a black, swirling void that seemed to suck in all the light from the room.

Before I could react, something grabbed me. I couldn’t see it, but I felt icy fingers clamp around my wrist, pulling me toward the box. I struggled, but the force was too strong. My body was being dragged into the darkness, inch by inch. My mind screamed, but my voice was lost in the void.

My feet left the ground, and suddenly I was free-falling into the blackness. I landed hard on a cold, wet surface, the stench of rot filling my nose. I scrambled to my feet, disoriented and terrified. Around me was a twisted, nightmarish version of my apartment, walls dripping with a thick, tar-like substance. The furniture was warped and covered in what looked like bones.

“What the hell?” I gasped, spinning around. The door was gone, replaced by a gaping hole in the wall that pulsed like a beating heart.

From that hole, shadows began to emerge—twisted, grotesque figures with elongated limbs and eyes that glowed a sickly green. They moved toward me with unnatural speed, their mouths opening wide to reveal rows of needle-like teeth.

I bolted. I ran through the distorted version of my apartment, every exit I found led to another room that was worse than the last. The walls closed in on me, breathing, pulsing with life. The shadows were getting closer, their hissing voices echoing in my ears.

“No, no, no!” I yelled, my voice shaking as I reached the kitchen, only to find it filled with dozens of those delivery boxes, all swirling with that same black void. The shadows were at my heels, claws outstretched. 

In a desperate move, I grabbed the nearest box and hurled it at the advancing figures. The box exploded into a blinding light, and the shadows shrieked, dissolving into nothingness.

But the victory was short-lived. The entire room started to twist, reality itself warping around me. The walls spun like a vortex, pulling me back toward the void in the center of the room.

I clawed at the ground, trying to find something—anything—to hold onto. My fingers wrapped around one last box, and I did the only thing I could think of: I opened it.

A blinding white light shot out, enveloping me. The shadows screamed as they were ripped apart, and the vortex slowed its spin until it was nothing but a dull hum.

Then, with a violent jolt, I was back in my living room. The pizza box was gone, replaced by an ordinary, grease-stained cardboard one. My heart was pounding, sweat dripped down my face. The symbols, the shadows, the void—gone, like nothing had happened.

My phone buzzed. I picked it up, my hand shaking. A new message from “10-Minute Delivery”:

**“Order completed. Satisfaction guaranteed. No refunds.”**

I deleted the app immediately.

No pizza is worth that kind of horror.
