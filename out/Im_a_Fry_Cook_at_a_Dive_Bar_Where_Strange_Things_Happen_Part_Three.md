Dave didn’t have to hire a dishwasher, because that monster that killed Lydia is now “working” for him. I came in one day and he was just there. There was a sign posted next to the dish room explaining not to enter the dish area unless you had dishes to give him. I don’t know how Dave did it, but the massive man had a small tag with a handwritten name, “Larry.” I realized I was staring when my eyes drifted up to meet Larrys’. I jumped back, startled, but he didn’t move. He just stared at me as I stood there. His eyes looked almost…sad. For some reason I immediately thought of an abused puppy, shivering in the pound. Trapped and unable to escape. But the thought was fleeting and I shook it off as he reached down to pick up some pots on the dish-table. He turned and slowly lumbered to the sprayer to clean them off before sticking them into the dishwasher. I watched him for a moment before walking behind the line. Jose was already there. He was the one who drew the short straw and had to open that day.  

He smiled when I walked up, “Did you see who was back?”

I couldn’t help but smile when he asked that. I knew who he was talking about without him having to say, “Henry’s back? How is he doing?”

Jose went back to cleaning the flattop. I thought I saw a look of pity flash across his face. “Well…” he hesitated, “He’s currently drinking at the bar…” I sighed. Drinking wasn’t uncommon here. Dave allowed us to drink before and after shifts. With what we had to deal with we probably would drink even if Dave didn’t let us. But I remember Henry saying that he didn’t drink. He explained his father was an angry drunk and he was more often drunk than sober. I saw Jose had already cleaned the fryer and replaced the oil so I told him I’d be right back and walked out of the kitchen.

Sure enough, Henry was choking back a cocktail Tommy made. He had recently started trying to mix drinks. I don’t know what compelled him to do this; but even a few things prevent his drinks from being drinkable. One, Dave has never bought anything for mixing drinks. Two, the alcohol here is cheap and tasted like horse piss on its own. And finally, Tommy never learned the basics of mixing cocktails. He just throws things together that might work. I sat next to Henry and tapped his shoulder, “good to see you came back. How are you doing?” 

Henry looked up at me and smiled. I noticed his smile had changed. Before it was filled with joy and was always genuine. But at that moment, it was empty, hollow. It felt as if he was wearing a mask to hide the emptiness underneath. “I’m good.” His response was short. I was sure he was trying to convince himself more than me.

I forced a chuckle, “Of course you aren’t good. You are back here with us. You are just as crazy as everyone in this building.” Henry laughed. My smile became genuine as I could tell the laugh was an honest one. When he smiled at me it seemed to be back to how it used to be. Tommy slid me a shot of whiskey. I had asked for it enough that eventually I stopped having to say anything. “Thank you Tommy. I’m glad you didn’t give me…whatever that is.” I pointed at the drink in Henrys’ hands.

Tommy feigned a frown and confused look. “I don’t know whatcha talkin’ about. That’s my best one yet, it doesn’t even have a name.”

Henry risked another sip of the concoction and gagged, finally setting it down and pushing toward Tommy. As if it being too close to him would kill him. “It’s like licking someone's butt crack.”

I elbowed him, “you know the taste of ass crack? What do you get up to with the ladies?” I teased him.

Henry laughed and shrugged, “not as innocent as you thought I was huh?”

I shook my head in disbelief, “I guess I should never underestimate you.”

Tommy scooped up the drink and sipped it. It didn’t seem to affect him and I wondered if that was why he made those drinks. His taste buds were obviously shot. “Maybe that’s what I’ll name it! I introduce to you…” he held it up as if to put it on show. Henry seemed to catch on and smacked his palms against the bar in a mock drum roll. Tommy waited until Henry’s drumroll came to a climax to announce in a triumphant way, “...My Ass Crack!” 

I chuckled and pinched the bridge of my nose out of sheer embarrassment. “There is no way you are giving that to the custom-” The rest of the sentence caught in my throat as I glanced at the end of the bar.

There was…something…sitting across the bar. I could only see its upper body but that was enough to disturb me. It seemed to have the torso of a man. It was wearing a brown leather jacket. It was unzipped allowing its white undershirt to be visible. That was normal, but what stopped my words dead in their tracks, was its neck. It had to have been six feet long. It was bent in an upside down ‘U’ shape, leaving its head and face upside down as well. Its flesh was gray and puffy, a bloated corpse in the water. Its tongue was so swollen that it forced its mouth open and puffed out of the lips.

“Look away.” I heard a sharp whisper that snapped me out of my daze. I looked over at Tommy. He had a fake smile stuck on his face. His face was pale with accents of green. He looked like he was about to pass out and throw up all at the same time. “Don’t acknowledge it anymore,” he hissed between his teeth, “don’t even look at it.” I heard the sound of the bar stool squeak as the thing pushed the bar stool away from the bar and stood up. I heard heavy footsteps approaching us. I was too scared to talk or look at Henry. I just tried to zone and look at the bottles that lined the bar wall. I’m glad there was a mirror on the wall. 

Dissociation from the situation seemed to be working. That was until I felt wet splashes on my hand. I dared to glance down. It was inches from the side of my face. It drool from its enlarged tongue dripped rhythmically onto my hand. I forced myself not to pull away in disgust. Not just for the spit that was slowly drenching my hand, but from its smell as well. Its skin had a smell that matched the dead, rotted look it had. I had to push down my panic before it totally took over. I looked at Tommy. He was staring at me stone faced. He was so focused on me that his eyes shook slightly. I kept looking at Tommy as I felt the drool dripping down my hand and pooling under my palm. It’s hot, wheezing, rancid breath invading my nostrils.

I don’t know how long the monster lingered there, but eventually it moved away from me. I heard it walk toward the bathrooms. I still didn’t dare to glance in its direction. Eventually I heard a door open and close. Tommy let out a giant exhale and gasped trying to catch his breath. “It's gone.” 

That was all I needed to hear to dart up and run around the bar. I leaned over the trash can next to the bar sink and threw up. After unleashing a tsunami of vomit into the trash can, I began scrubbing my hands. “What the fuck was that Tommy?” I looked up from my hands that were turning red from the continued scrubbing.

I could see Tommy shaking slightly as he spoke, “you have your monster back there and we have ours up here.” 

I always assumed that the front-of-house had things to deal with. But because no one really talked about the things we experience, I didn’t know what they had to deal with. The only time we are warned of each others’ monsters is when they directly affect everyone. Like Larry, front-of-house and back-of-house learned how to deal with him because both would frequently have interactions with him.

When I finally felt like my hand was stripped of the filth from that thing, my hand was a deep red. Tommy was prepping for the day as I slowly walked back to my seat. Tommy had wiped away the drool by the time I sat down. I looked over at Henry as tapped his thumbs on his phone.

“You okay?” I asked as I noticed Henry was in his notes app. He was typing away before he noticed me looking and closed it.

He looked up at me and gave me another fake smile, “Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?” I didn’t like him pretending like it didn’t happen. I nearly pissed myself so I knew he had to have been at least a little shaken up. At first I wondered if he still somehow thought we were messing with him. I pushed that aside though as I knew that was ridiculous. What he was actually doing was worse. He was ignoring it and acting like it never happened. I’ve seen people try this method of coping before and it never ended well. 

I didn’t want to push the issue because I felt like I would push him away at the same time. So instead I put my hand on his shoulder, squeezed it, and nodded, “okay well I nearly pissed myself.” 

His smile filled with joy and humor again as he laughed, “pissing yourself and throwing up is what is meant to happen in a bar right?”
I chuckled, “why are you asking me? You know what ass tastes like, so you should be mature enough to know what happens in a bar.” We both bursted out into a fit of laughter. I checked the time and stood up, “we have to get back into the kitchen. We open in ten minutes.” As Henry stood up to leave, I looked over at Tommy, “Thank you Tommy. For the drink…” I tossed it back and drank it all, “...and for keeping me alive.” 

Tommy turned and smiled, nodding his acknowledgement to me, “sounds like a ticket to free lunch from the kitchen.”

I nodded and turned to follow Henry into the kitchen. “Just let me know what you want and I’ll make it for you.” I said in an exaggerated, exhausted tone.

We ran into Nathan as we passed past the back door for employees. Henry gave Nathan a fake smile but it doesn’t seem like he noticed. He smiled back and nodded, “Good to have you back Henry.”

“Good to be back.”

As Henry passed into the kitchen Nathan stepped in front of me to keep me from following. I heard Jose and Henry chatting as the door swung back and forth. “I need to talk to you.” Nathan’s voice was hushed. “I think Henry has something to do with what’s going on at the bar.” I was surprised by this and stared at Nathan blankly before looking over his shoulder. I could see Henry through the door's small window. He was setting up some stuff around the fryer and talking to Jose. I could tell his smile was still fake but it seemed a little warmer and genuine.

“Are you sure?” I found myself whispering as I looked back at Nathan. “This bar has had stuff happening long before he showed up.”

Nathan nodded in acknowledgment of my point, “No…I’m not sure…and I don’t know how the bars’ strange things have come about before Henry showed up. But I know I saw him sneaking into the restaurant the other day when it was closed. I noticed him when I drove by. I didn’t follow him in but I saw him just as he entered the building. The next day was when Larry made his first appearance.”

I shuddered at the memory of that day. “Are you sure it was him?” I didn’t know what else to say.

Nathan nodded, “I’m 100% sure. I just thought I’d let you know. You seem close and I just wanted you to keep an eye on him for us. Just please…don’t mention it to him. Not until we know what’s going on.”

I wasn’t sure how to feel about what Nathan said. But I nodded and he went into the kitchen. I stood there watching Nathan pat Henry on the back as they talked. I couldn’t hear what they were saying. I just stood there for a while thinking over Nathan’s words. I shook away my thoughts and decided to put a pin on the issue. I decided to not mention what Nathan said to me. I was going to tell him only if I decided not to keep an eye on Henry. For the rest of the day, I suppressed the want to talk to Henry. I trusted Nathan enough to seriously consider his warning.
