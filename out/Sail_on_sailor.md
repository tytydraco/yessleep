“You sure you don’t want me to read Jack and the Beanstalk again?” I asked, tapping the cover of the faded old book. “You know—beans, giants, kid saves the day?”

“Nah,” my boy said, curling up under the blanket like he wanted the world to go away. “I want the wizard. And the whale.”

I sighed. “The wizard and the whale? Again?” I sat down next to him, the bunk creaking under my weight. “You know I made that up for you, right? Outta thin air. I ain’t some big-shot storyteller.”

He shrugged, staring at me with those big eyes—the kind of eyes you can’t say no to. “Please?” he asked, so soft I almost didn’t hear him over the waves smacking the hull.

“Alright,” I said, rubbing my face. “But don’t blame me if you’re up all night, scared outta your wits.”

“Promise I won’t be,” he said, gripping the blanket tight.

“Alright,” I started, leaning back. “There was a kid. Same age as you, small for his size. But he wasn’t ordinary. He had magic in him. Real magic.”

“What kind of magic?” he asked.

“The kind that makes people better when they’re sick,” I said. “The kind that brings rain when the ground’s bone-dry. Stops storms before they tear everything apart. But magic like that—it ain’t free.”

The ship groaned again, deeper this time, like it was answering me. He didn’t flinch, just kept looking at me like the story was all that mattered.

“So one day,” I said, “somethin’ came up outta the ocean. A whale. Bigger than anything you can imagine. Bigger than mountains. With eyes darker than a junkie’s soul and jaws that could swallow the sky.”

His breath hitched. “Why was it so angry?”

I shrugged. “Who knows? Some things just are. The kid tried to stop it. Cast every spell he knew. Used every bit of magic he had in him. But it wasn’t enough. The whale wasn’t just big—it was old. Smarter than you’d think. And it wanted one thing: a sacrifice.”

His hands curled around the blanket. “What’s that mean?”

“It wanted someone brave enough to climb into its jaws,” I said. “Alive. No tricks, no magic. That was the deal. If it got what it wanted, it’d leave. The storms would stop, and the world would go back to the way it was.”

He sucked in a shaky breath. “Did the kid go?”

I nodded, my voice quiet now. “He didn’t want to. Who would? But he looked around at his family, his friends, all the people who’d lose everything if he didn’t go. He knew he didn’t have a choice.”

The lantern swung on its hook, casting shadows that stretched long and thin across the walls. The air felt colder somehow, heavier.

“They put him on a ship,” I said softly, “sailed him out to the deepest part of the ocean, where the whale was waiting. When it rose, its mouth wide enough to eat the world, the boy stepped forward. Climbed right in.”

The cabin fell silent. Just the sound of the waves, steady and mean. My boy tilted his head, his voice barely a whisper. “What happened to him?”

“The sea went calm,” I said. “The storms stopped. The world was saved.”

“But the boy?” he asked. “Did he die?”

I leaned closer, my voice low and even. “Sometimes,” I said, “stories aren’t just stories.”

His face twisted, confusion first, then fear. “Like Mom?” he asked.

I swallowed hard, staring at the bunk. “Yeah, kid,” I said. “Like your mom.”

“She didn’t even say goodbye,” he murmured, his voice cracking.

“No,” I said. “She didn’t.”

The ship groaned louder, the wood creaking like it was ready to give up. The porthole rattled in its frame, spray slicking the glass. He pulled the blanket tighter around himself, shaking.

“What was that?” he whispered.

I didn’t answer. Outside, the shadow passed across the porthole—huge, blocking out the horizon. The air felt wrong, like it had stopped working.

“Dad…”

I stood, bracing myself against the bunk. “It’s just the waves,” I lied.

The sound came then—a low growl, deep enough to shake the walls. It wasn’t thunder. It wasn’t the wind. It was something alive.

He grabbed my arm, tears streaking his face. “Dad, I’m scared.”

“I know,” I said, my voice breaking. “Me too.”

The shadow outside grew, swallowing the ship in darkness. The lantern flickered, sending jagged shapes racing across the walls. He clung to me, his small fists gripping my shirt.

“Why’s it here?” he cried.

My throat burned. I couldn’t look at him. “Because,” I said quietly, “it’s time.”

His eyes went wide, panic spilling into his voice. “No! You can’t!”

I didn’t let go of him. Not yet. “I made a deal,” I said, my words raw. “A long time ago. Before you were born.”

“What deal?” he sobbed. “What did you do?”

I turned away. “It was supposed to save us,” I said. “Me. Your mom. It was supposed to fix everything. But it wasn’t about us. It’s you it wants.”

The whale’s growl turned into a roar, shaking the ship so hard I thought it might splinter. The porthole shattered, spraying ice-cold water across the cabin. He screamed, clutching me, begging me.

“Please, Dad. Don’t make me.”

I let him go.
