**Opposing Pairs are Inherent In Creation**

&#x200B;

*\[Mr. Guna  Darshana from Indonesia asked “When will God destroy injustice by  stopping the people who find entertainment in gambling, cock-fights and  so on?” Given below is Shri Swami’s response.\]*

&#x200B;

The creation  created by God always consists of pairs of opposite items like day and  night, summer and winter, justice and injustice etc. If one of the pair  is absent, the other loses its significance and does not exist. The very  existence of any item of the pair depends on the relative existence of  the other. If the injustice is removed, where is the need of effort to  avoid the injustice and support the justice? In absence of these pairs,  the souls become mostly inactive and slowly become inert. Inertia is not  the theme of the creation.

 Activity is the basis of the creation. If  you remove the concept of failure in the examination, there will be no  activity and effort in studies and the concept of merit vanishes and the  process of rewarding disappears in the absence of defect and  punishment. When the injustice is totally absent, the relative justice  does not exist and establishment of justice by God also disappears. In  the absence of injustice, justice may exist but you will not call it as  justice since the word justice arises only with reference to the  relative injustice. In such case, not only the souls but also God  becomes inactive.

This creation is created by God for  entertainment through constant engagement. For the transfer of current,  both positive and negative poles are equally important. The very  foundation of the creation gets cracked if these pairs do not exist.  Even the necessity of knowledge disappears in absence of ignorance,  which leads to the absence of Human incarnations of God, which come to  preach the knowledge. Therefore, the process of suppression of injustice  followed by establishment of justice is continuous so that the life of  the creation exists. In the Gita, it is told that whenever the injustice  comes up suppressing the justice, God incarnates (Yadaa yadaahi...). 

 This means that the injustice is only suppressed by God and not really  destroyed. The villain in a cinema appears to be killed by the hero but  the villain is not really killed. The same villain appears as villain in  the next cinema. Similarly, whenever God kills a demon, such killing is  apparent only since the individual soul in the body of the demon is not  killed and takes birth as demon again. This concept was preached to  Arjuna by Krishna in killing the devilish fore-fathers of Arjuna.

Your  question becomes valid if the injustice is uncontrollable. Again, the  foundation of the creation is cracked if only negative exists  continuously and the scope of appearance of positive is not seen.  Therefore, you need not fear about the continuous existence of one of  these pairs. The alternative motion of ups and downs of these two items  in a pair is the essence of this dynamic creation like the blades of a  moving wheel. 

Whenever a demon becomes active disturbing the society,  the sages always were patient spectators because the sages are scholars  knowing the dynamic nature of the creation. They know that when the sin  of the demon ripens, God will incarnate to punish the demon. Their  patience is the result of their knowledge. Only ignorant human beings  were undergoing tension over the disturbance. Similarly, the life cycle  of every human being is also constituted by the moving pleasant and  unpleasant events in alternate fashion. A realised soul also watches  these events patiently without any tension and such a person is called  as ‘Sthitha Prajna’ in the Gita.

A devotee asked Me: “Swami! Recently, I did not get any messages from You? What is the reason?”.

&#x200B;

I  replied “My messages are always answers to the questions. Therefore,  the reason is that the questions are not coming to Me. The Gita is also a  group of answers given by Krishna to a group of questions put by  Arjuna. The Gita is not a spontaneous speech given by Krishna without  the enquiry from Arjuna. Therefore, both Krishna and Arjuna are the  authors of the Gita. Question is as important as the answer. Both these  form the two items of the pair called knowledge.”
