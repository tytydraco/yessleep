Hiya guys. I’ve got another update. The last one was taken off of here, so I’ll leave a wee link at the bottom of this to the past couple posts to get yous all caught up. 

So aye, I finished writing update 2, picked up my axe and headed into the forest. I went out there with the intention of finishing this. Of getting wee Alfie back. God knows what that man would be doing out there with him. 

Before it was deleted, I did manage to see a few of the comments. Asking what I meant when I mentioned I’d had some trouble with the police in the past. Listen, I’d had some whisky’s. I mentioned some things that were on my mind, but I’m sure they’re not relevant to what’s going on now…ah fuck it. I’ll let you know the gist of it anyway. 

It was about 18 months ago, December of 2022. I was putting in serious hours working. 12-13 hour days, 7 days a week. Cutting, shaping and transporting logs from the local forest into the surrounding towns and villages. My work is tough, and in the Scottish Highlands in winter the weather gets pretty atrocious. The winds easily hit 60, 70 or 80mph up the ben’s (hills, for the Americans again) which is where I’m based. There was this one day, Christmas Eve in fact, we were working up one of the bens. Clearing it of any tree’s that posed a warning to the roads at the bottom of the Ben if they were blown over by the wind. 

Eileen was annoyed I was working Christmas Eve. She grew up in an orphanage so this time of year was hard for her, but money’s money. 

We had this young lad working with us at the time, Alfie Simmons, he had only just turned 17. Was just wanting to learn a trade, and picked tree surgery. I wish he’d have picked plumbing, or carpentry, or fucking anything else. Anything other than what he did…

Anyway, we were nearing the end of the shift. About 7pm or so, we were talking about the plans for Christmas Day the next day. I remember it so vividly. We’d began to walk back to the car, when a huge gust of wind hit us. Probably 120-140mph, we were all floored. I remember hugging a boulder next to me, praying I didn’t get dragged down the rocky side of the Ben. I closed my eyes and waited. After a few seconds, it died down enough that we could all stand up and look around. And aye Alfie, the young Simmons boy, well he…he fell. 

I became more and more distanced from Eileen after that, then in January 2023, she vanished. She left a note saying I was getting too much to deal with, and left while I was at work. We searched for her for weeks, never found her. Well, we found - some of her. A hand and a leg, out in the forest. Police said that she’d probably wondered off into the woods in a manic state and died of natural causes , and then was scavenged by animals. So no body. Due to the closeness of all the community, and that I grew up with the police, they said they’d ’look the other way’ and ‘nae investigate further’. As if there would be anything else to find anyway! Cheeky bastards. So that’s it. 

The last thing she ever got me was a new puppy. Yous can all see where his name comes from now. 

Now that’s out the way, I’ll tell yous about what I found last night. 

So I headed out, axe in one hand and torch in the other. I was traversing through the tall dark trees for only about 10 or 15 minutes or so, following this path that seems to have been made, when I heard it. Alfie’s wee bark. It was close, just through some more bramble bushes and fallen trees. I shined my light through a gap in the branches, and that’s when I saw it. It was an old abandoned shed by the looks of it, maybe only the size of a living room. One of the walls had near enough entirely rotted away, so I could see inside. There was rusty tools hung up, a stained mattress in the corner - and dead animal carcasses littering all of the floor. Most of them looked half-eaten. 

Another wee bark beside the shed. There he is! Bless his poor wee heart, he was chained up at the side of one of the walls, shivering. I ran over to Alfie and quickly started undoing the chains, he started wagging his tail as soon as he realised it was me. It’s okay boy, ya dad’s here! I freed him, and was about to leave, when I took another glance at the shed. 

That glance revealed something interesting. 

Some old photographs scattered on the floor by the mattress. I had to look. I had to see what this monster looked at for sentimental value. And when I saw what it was, I was floored. 

Eileen? I asked myself. 

It was her. Unmistakably. Sure she was younger, probably only 15 or 16, but it was her without a doubt. And there he was as well! I recognised his dark eyes and hair, his brown skin, his smile…

But in this photograph his smile wasn’t crazed, it was normal. He was also way younger, and not disheveled of course, and was only about 11 or 12. They had their arms around each other, and were hugging for the picture. I went to pick up a second photograph, when I heard footsteps approaching the shed. 

Shite. 

I scooped Alf up under my arm, and ran around the corner - hiding behind a tree. I watched the man approach the shed, crawling up on all fours. His scraggly beard was dripping with blood, and his mouth clutched what looked like a dead rat. Was he planning on eating that thing…fuck…those animal carcasses were eaten by him. He suddenly noticed the empty chains on the ground and dropped the rat. He began screaming, screaming this horrific scream. I don’t know if you have heard a fox cry, but it sounded like that. He looked around and saw me. And I saw him. I saw him and his missing eye - Jesus - he had gouged his own eye out and left it for me. He let out another blood-curling scream, and began to bolt towards me. 

I turned on a dime and raced back the way I came - Alfie under my arm - the man on my heels. I burst back through the tree-line into my back yard, and tore up the back steps and through the back door of my house. I finally turned and looked. There he was. Stood just on the tree-line, perfectly still. Mouth dripping with rat blood, eye socket dripping with his own. He stared. I stared. This lasted about a minute. Then he turned, and walked back into the woods. 

I put Alfie down and hugged him, crying. Eileen knew this man? What the fuck? What did he want? And - oh my god…

I have to do something. 
That’s me signing off for tonight. 
I’ll update when I can. If I can.
