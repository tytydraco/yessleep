Just so you know, this end isn’t pretty at all. I’m shaking, scared and confused, and I still have trouble believing what just happened. I’m not even sure why I’m writing this here, it’s probably just a desperate cry for help. So here you go.

For context, I’m a young adult, I still live with my parents in a decent apartment, we get along well and, as far as I know, there’s no one who I can think of who would do this. None of us are have any psychological disorders as well. Really, we’re average on all accounts. And we have a two-year-old German shepherd, Sheila. I mean, used to have. She was sweet, never hurt or even barked at anyone except when playing, but all dogs do that, no one could hate her.

Today, I went to college and mom went at work as usual. Dad stayed with Sheila at home. She can’t stay alone for too long, and he can work from home so they spend most days together. When I came back home after class, our car wasn’t there. Mom was still at work so it was dad who took it but it’s nothing unusual. When I entered, I didn’t see Sheila so either she was with my dad or she was in another room. But I unusually felt really tired so I didn’t think much of it and decided to rest a bit.

Just before I woke up, I heard a man whispering in my ear. I wasn’t fully awake yet but I know I actually heard it. I swear it wasn’t just in my head. He only said three words.

*One.*

*Two.*

*Three.*

Then I heard finger snapping while I started opening my eyes. I think I saw a very tall shadow leave my room, which was enough to make me almost jump from my bed. But in the end, I concluded that it was my dad so I went in the living room. No one was here. I heard some scratching on the front door, which was slightly open. And I **know** I locked it before going to sleep. Worst of all, I heard *nothing* while I was asleep. Not even Sheila. And she would've been loud as hell.

Honestly, I should’ve called the cops or something by then but I didn't stop to think, and pushed the door. There wasn’t anyone outside. But right there, at my feet, was Sheila’s torn off head, eyes wide open, fresh blood smeared in a six-foot-long line from the entrance, as if her neck was scraped on the ground right after being beheaded.

From there, I blacked out. My parents and the police are here so I must’ve called them. An officer asked me questions like I was the one who did that. They asked to come in and went in every single room there was, investigated the building up and down, even asked neighbors. And they found exactly nothing. Not even the other half of Sheila.

My mom is crying. My dad is barely holding himself up. I have no idea what to do. I’m just lost. I wish I could stop existing.
