[Hello again](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ohacz5/i_manage_a_museum_full_of_cursed_objects_my_boss) \- your favorite idiot still clocking in at the world’s least OSHA-compliant haunted museum.

It’s that lovely pre-Halloween chaos again, which means I’ve been running around trying to make sure nothing in storage starts floating on its own before the tourists arrive.

Don’t worry - I’ll give you all the gory details once the madness dies down. Assuming I survive it.

Anyway, since I’ve finally managed to sneak in a break (and the typewriter hasn’t started typing my name again - yet), I figured I’d use the time to answer a few of your questions and share some more stories from this wonderful little slice of paranormal retail hell I call a job.

For now, I just wanted to clear a few things up, answer some of your questions, and, since Walt’s actually here this week, maybe get a few answers of my own.

So, I figured I should tell you, dear people of the internet, a bit more about my workplace. Seems like a lot of you had questions after my last post and honestly, I don’t blame you. This place raises more questions than it answers.

I’ll do my best to clear some of them up (or at least try), and while I’m at it, I’ll share a few more stories about our less-than-satisfied customers. Because, believe me, when something goes wrong with a “haunted collectible,” it really goes wrong.

First off, someone asked about Gordon - and what exactly he is.

So, I finally gathered enough courage to ask Walt about him. At first, he didn’t even know who I meant, which, fair enough - he doesn’t call him Gordon like I do. But the second I mentioned the code name B-45, his expression changed.

I told him I was just curious, you know, trying to keep up with the records and all. He gave me that usual polite smile but didn’t answer right away. Instead, he just stared at the floor for a few seconds, then said quietly, “Ah… the Talking Head.”

Here’s what I managed to get out of him.

Gordon - or The Talking Head, if you want to be official about it - was human. Or at least, parts of him still are. I was right about the skin; it’s mostly wax. But underneath? Everything except the eyes is real. Walt said the eyes are glass, maybe porcelain. The rest - teeth, tongue - that’s all human.

When I asked whose parts they were, he just told me, “Someone who wanted to be remembered.” Then he changed the subject.

So yeah, turns out Gordon’s a little more… authentic than I thought. Maybe that’s why he’s always hungry.

Someone also asked me to check with Walt about a “Jade.”

Now, I really doubt he knows anyone online - I’ve never even seen him touch a phone, unless you count one of those old rotary ones we keep on display (and I’m pretty sure that one’s not plugged into anything). He’s not big on technology in general. No computer, no tablet. Just a dusty old notebook, a fountain pen, and a memory that seems a little too good for someone his age.

But hey, you asked, so I asked.

When I mentioned “Jade,” he just smiled in that usual quiet way of his, reached into his pocket, and handed me a green lollipop. Didn’t say a word. Just gave it to me like it was the most normal thing in the world.

So yeah, I guess we don’t have any Jades here - unless you count the apple lollipop I got from him.

And before any of you ask, no, it’s not for sale. I already ate it.

Since I’m already on the subject of cursed items you all seem weirdly curious about, someone asked me about “a tin full of snow that never melts.”

The closest thing I could find was a crate of canned beans that are always warm and ready to eat. Apparently, they’re totally safe. The notebook says they “replenish daily” - and yeah, I checked. Every other morning, the crate’s full again, like someone restocked it overnight.

I’ve tried one. Tasted normal, maybe a little too fresh - like something cooked five minutes ago. But when I looked down, the can was empty, and when I looked back up… there was another one sitting right where I’d picked it up from.

So yeah, no tin of snow, sorry - just bottomless beans. I’ll try to feed them to Gordon and see if he prefers that over a Snickers bar.

Someone asked if I’ve ever had anything follow me home from work, and I’ve got to say - that necklace Walt gave me is really doing its job so far. Nothing weird’s happened to me.

People around me, though? Yeah… that’s another story.

Lucky for me, stuff like that never seems to happen directly to me.

I remember back when I first started here, I swiped a small bag of bath salts from one of the shelves. They looked harmless - just a little pouch with this soft, pearly shimmer to it. Figured it was one of those decorative items that didn’t actually do anything.

Well, joke’s on me.

The next morning, I woke up to the sound of water sloshing. When I went to check, my bathtub was filled to the brim with crabs and these pale, mangled fish. The smell was awful - like the ocean decided to die in my plumbing.

Apparently, my neighbor ended up in the hospital the same night. According to the doctors, he’d been vomiting seawater.

And believe me when I say it’s hard to get the smell out - I really mean it. Sometimes I’ll find tiny salt crystals clinging to the tiles or stuck in the carpet when I’m getting ready for work.

And, well… Walt doesn’t have to know about any of that. If he ever asks, I’ll just tell him the bag got sold for a few good bucks.

So yeah, I don’t take souvenirs home anymore. Lesson learned.

So yeah, you wanted some stories about unsatisfied customers, and I deliver.  
 Here are a few that stuck with me the most.

I think this one happened during my first month working here. Back when I still didn’t quite believe in all the “haunted item” crap - and honestly didn’t care much either.

So this guy walks in - the kind of guy who looks like he wrestles his reflection every morning. All muscle, no brain. You know the type.

I doubt he even knew what kind of shop he was stepping into, but hey - some people don’t really care, as long as there’s something vaguely woman-shaped behind the counter.

He starts throwing pickup lines at me like he’s auditioning for some discount Johnny Bravo reboot. I wish I was exaggerating. Every single one was worse than the last, and my replies were limited to either a flat “Great” or an even flatter “Aha.”

Eventually, he gets frustrated, slams his hands on the counter, and demands to know what kind of place this even is.

So I give him the usual spiel - haunted items, cursed objects, supernatural powers, yada yada yada.

That’s when his eyes light up, and he leans in with this greasy grin and asks if we have anything that could, quote, “get him some nice chicks.” Not exactly his wording, but you get the point.

So, I pull out the old notebook, flip through the pages, and find something marked B-97. According to the notes, it’s a small pink crystal flacon - perfume - supposedly enchanted to make whoever smells it absolutely irresistible to you. Basically, bottled lust magic.

He pays up front, snatches the bottle, and sprays himself right there in front of me.  
 A big pink mist fills the air - smells like strawberries, vanilla, and something else I couldn’t place.

For a few seconds, we just stand there looking at each other. Then he suddenly throws the bottle to the ground, shattering it, and starts screaming in my face about how the whole store’s a scam. Then he storms out, slamming the door so hard the shelves rattled.

I figured that was the end of it.

Until he returned a few days later.

I was in the middle of cashing someone out - wrapping up this lion plushie in our “fancy” paper, which basically just means old newspaper with a red ribbon slapped on top.

We offer to pack things up as gifts for people who either have no taste or secretly hate the person they’re giving it to.

It was one of those warmer days when we keep the front door wide open. The chalk line on the threshold is more than enough to keep out whatever shouldn’t come in, so we let the breeze through.

So there I was, minding my own business, tying the last bit of ribbon around the plush when I noticed its glassy black eyes shift - not in that “it’s badly stuffed” way, but like it was actually looking past me.

Straight over the lady’s shoulder.

Naturally, I had to look too. And there he was - that same guy again. Running. Full sprint. Right toward the museum door.

I handed the granny her wrapped gift and quietly told her not to mind the guy behind her. She just gave me this polite little smile - the kind old ladies do when they think you’re the one being dramatic - and tucked the package neatly into her purse.

But of course, nothing here ever goes that smoothly.

Before she could even step aside, the guy came crashing into my desk, hard enough to rattle the register. He was rambling - something about “them,” and “it won’t stop.”

I tuned most of it out. Around here, everyone’s got a story like that, and nine times out of ten, it’s not worth losing brain cells over.

I was about to point at the “No Refunds, No Exceptions” sign when I noticed the gift bag start to move.

The wrapping paper twitched once. Then again.  
 A small yellow paw poked through, tearing a neat hole before pushing free. The lion plush gave me a slow, pitiful little wave.

And just like that, the old woman adjusted her purse, thanked me, and headed for the door - her new toy squirming quietly inside, on its way to a new home.

I barely had time to process that before the guy slammed his fists on the counter.

“ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING?!” he bellowed.

I blinked. “Who is them exactly?” I asked, keeping my tone light, polite - like we were discussing weather and not whatever nightmare was apparently breathing down his neck.

He froze, chest heaving. Then leaned forward and hissed,  
 “You don’t get it. THEY ARE AFTER ME.”

And that’s when the floor started to move.

Not a tremor - a deep, guttural shake that rolled through the floorboards. The shelves rattled. The display glass chimed.

Before I could react, Johnny Bravo over here leapt over the counter and crouched behind me like I was going to save him. This guy could’ve bench-pressed a fridge, but apparently hiding behind the cashier was the better survival strategy.

Then I saw it.

A crawling, shuddering mass dragging itself toward the entrance - a crowd, not a monster.  
 A solid wall of bodies, trampling over one another, clawing and shoving just to get closer to the museum doors. Their screams blurred together into one long, desperate wail.

“Woooow,” I said, deadpan. “People really love you, don’t they? What did you do this time?”

“It’s that fucking perfume!” he shouted. “I still reek of it!”

And he wasn’t wrong. Even under the stench of fear and cheap tanning spray, I could smell it - strawberries and vanilla.

“Relax,” I said. “We’re safe here. The chalk line keeps bad things out.”

Except it didn’t.

Because when I looked down… the line was broken. Smudged inward, the white dust dragged by a shoe.

“You didn’t,” I whispered.

But he did.





One of them slipped through the break - moving wrong, like its bones were remembering how to exist.  
 It dragged itself across the floor, slow but deliberate.

I grabbed its arms - bad idea - and yanked it forward. Its joints popped like bubble wrap. Then it hit the floor with a wet slap.

The rest caught on.

Bodies pressed against the doorway, twitching, shoving. I didn’t think. I just shoved a mannequin - the one with the pink fedora - against the door and locked it.

The himbo was crawling away, muttering prayers that sounded more like apologies.

The thing I’d pulled in was folding itself upright, its body bending wrong.

I flipped through the notebook like a maniac, looking for B-97 - the perfume entry.  
 If it could make people love him, maybe it could make them stop.

“HURRY AAAAAA—”

He screamed as the thing grabbed his jaw, trying to crawl into him.

I found the note. “The user must accept who they are.”

Of course. Cryptic bullshit.

I slammed the notebook on the creature’s head - it hissed, body turning translucent.

“WHO REALLY ARE YOU, DUDE?!” I yelled.

He blinked. “I-I’m Michel!”

Figures.

Then it clicked - the horde, the perfume, the desire, the thing trying to merge with him.

“ARE YOU GAY?” I shouted.

He froze. “WHAT?! NO! OF COURSE NOT!”

The slug twitched, gurgling something that sounded like liar.

The smell grew thick and sour.

“Just admit it!” I yelled.

“I-I’m not—”

  
 But then, quieter:

  
 “…yeah. I guess I am.”

And just like that, the slug dissolved into pink mist.

“Congrats,” I said. “You survived a spiritual gay awakening.”

He just blinked.

“You’re welcome,” I added, patting his shoulder.

Turns out Michel’s actually a great guy - y’know, when he’s not trying to act like a protein-powder commercial.

He drops by the museum sometimes to thank me for “saving his life,” which sounds way more dramatic than it was.

It got a little awkward explaining to Walt that no, Michel isn’t my boyfriend - and even more awkward explaining what being gay actually means to a man who keeps a jar labeled cursed toenail clippings behind the counter.

Anyway, I should probably get back to the register.  
 Walt’s “keeping an eye on things,” which usually means he’s pretending to be a statue again, and we’ve got four loud idiots demanding “spooky Halloween costume crap.”

Something tells me this night’s not over yet.
