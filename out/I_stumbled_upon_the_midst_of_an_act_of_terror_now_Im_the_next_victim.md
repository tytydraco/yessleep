I had perceived the horror. I apprehended it as soon as the muffled exclamation and the repercussion of a carcass impinging the asphalt assailed my auricles. I had been ambulating home from my vocation, taking a detour through the somber alley, when I discerned the heinous scene. A masked demon, grasping a sanguineous blade, dragging a flaccid figure into a corvine sack. I had solidified in trepidation, hoping the slayer wouldn't detect me. But he did.

The slayer's oculi met mine, and I felt a surge of adrenaline. I whirled and bolted, hoping to find an egress from the maze of narrow lanes. I heard the slayer's footsteps behind me, reverberating in the nocturnal. I swerved and zigzagged, trying to shake off my pursuer, but the slayer was expeditious and agile than I anticipated. I spotted a flicker of hope when I reached a barren field, with no vestiges of civilization. I scampered across the grass, hoping to find a refuge. I peered back and saw the slayer gaining on me, his sanguineous blade shimmering in the moonlight.

I thought I had made it, but I was erroneous. I didn't notice the barbed wire fence, until it was too late. I collided with it, feeling the acuminous metal puncture my dermis. I tumbled and fell, bleeding copiously. I tried to rise, but the slayer was already there. He seized me by the collar, and hoisted me up. He held me in front of his face, his respiration stinking of death. He murmured one word: "Why?"

I had no rejoinder. I had no cue why he had killed that person, or why he was after me. I had no cue who he was, or what he wanted. I had no cue how to flee, or how to survive. I had no cue what to do, or what to say. I had no cue.

He grinned wickedly, and impaled his blade into my chest. I felt a searing pain, and then everything went black.

I floated in and out of consciousness, feeling a frigid hand squeezing my cardiac. I opened my oculi and saw the masked demon looming over me, his sanguineous blade dripping with my blood. He had dragged me into a tenebrous cave, far away from any luminosity. He had revived me, but not for my benefit. He had a plan, and he was not done with me yet. He had a question, and he wanted an answer. He had a knife, and he was ready to use it. He leaned towards me, his oculi gleaming with malice. He uttered one word: "Why?"

I still had no rejoinder. I still had no cue. I still had no hope.

He chuckled maniacally, and slashed my throat. I felt a gush of blood, and then everything went black.

I awoke in a hellish nightmare, feeling a scorching sensation all over my body. I opened my oculi and saw the masked demon standing over me, his sanguineous blade glowing with fire. He had brought me to a volcanic crater, surrounded by lava. He had resurrected me, but not for mercy. He had a plan, and he was not done with me yet. He had a question, and he wanted an answer. He had a knife, and he was ready to use it. He moved towards me, his voice booming with fury. He exclaimed one word: "Why?"

I still had no rejoinder. I still had no cue. I still had no hope.

He bellowed angrily, and stabbed me in the oculus. I felt a burst of flame, and then everything went black.

I never awoke. I was trapped in an endless cycle of pain and death. The slayer had tormented me, but not for fun. He had a plan, and he was not done with me yet. He had a question, and he wanted an answer. He had a knife, and he was ready to use it. He repeated one word: "Why?"

I never had a rejoinder. I never had a cue. I never had hope.

He was the hunter, and I was the prey. He was the judge, and I was the guilty. He was the executioner, and I was the condemned. He was the master, and I was the slave. He was the devil, and I was the damned.

He was the why, and I was the why not.
