Alcove Mall. I can’t say I’ve heard of it, but according to friends and family, it was something special. It was two hours away from where I live, and from what I’ve heard from other people, it seemed like a cool place to hang out. One of my brother’s friends said he’d take girls here on dates, hit the food court, watch a movie, and then sneak off somewhere to have sex. Then the late 90s hit, and the mall started tanking. The rent got higher to try and stay afloat, but unfortunately, the store vendors couldn’t keep up. One by one, the stores closed; it was like an organ failure. The final nail in the coffin was the movie theater, which was independently owned and was the only theater for miles. Then, it was announced that a Regal Cinema would be opening soon. Fourteen screens, IMAX included. 

After that, game over. I only know this stuff because my family loved to talk about memories they had while they drove past it. My older brothers would talk about girls they met, movies they saw, the arcade, and so forth. Dad talked about how good the food court was, and he kept going on about how he wished he had caved in and bought one of those massage chairs they always had on display. Mom, she always said she loved reading by the indoor fountains, listening to the water ripple and splash. I thought it’d be demolished by someone by now, but it just stands there on the side of the road like some sort of commercialistic monolith to 80s Americana. 

I was in college, cash was drying up, and Christmas was getting close. After being laid off from Walmart, my savings started to dwindle quickly. Between tuition fees and everyday expenses, I was trying to manage without going broke. I eventually moved back in with Mom & Dad while I was searching for a job. I’d refresh Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, the works. All the jobs were the same: fast food, car sales, and janitorial positions. I was about to bite the bullet and apply to be a janitor when I refreshed the page one more time and saw a new listing:

**NIGHT MONITOR FOR ALCOVE MALL**

**FULL-TIME**

**MON-FRI**

**6:00 pm - 5:00 am**

**100$ AN HOUR**

**DESCRIPTION: Night Monitors are to survey the premises and keep the mall safe and secure. Monitors must be willing to stay awake throughout the night to ensure that this historic establishment is safe from vandals and will remain adequate until its eventual sale**

I instantly applied. 1,100$ a night? Ain’t no way I’m not skipping out on this. Something I didn’t expect was to get a response. I surely thought they’d hire a former cop, bodyguard, or whatever other tough guy they’d have fill in the position. But to my surprise, I got a call. I answered,

"Hello?"

"Are you the one who applied for the Nightwatchmen position at Alcove Mall?"

"Yes."

"The name is Mick. I saw the application you sent in, and after careful consideration, I think I'm gonna hire you."

My jaw hung open, and I was at a loss for words. I was just glad that I had a source of income for the first time in months. 

"I understand you know what your duties are, correct?"

"Yes, sir, do you have a ballpark for when I'll be able to start?"

"Monday, if that's okay with you."

"Yeah, man, cool. Do I need to go through any training videos or dress in a uniform?"

"You wear the clothes on your back along with an orange vest. I'll mail it to you along with a set of keys to the place."

Out of curiosity, I asked,

"Do I get a gun?"

The voice laughed,

"Good lord, you ain't a cop, you just watch the place. However, I would advise you to bring something with you. Baseball bat, mace, taser, anything like that. We get our fair share of squatters and most are harmless, but you don't want to be empty-handed on the chance one of them ain't. But these little run-ins don't happen that often, though, I'd pack something to read or listen to. Boredom is your worst enemy for a job like this."

"Right. Is there anything else I should know?"

Mick was silent for a second, and he cleared his throat,

"Well, my last night watchman quit because he said he saw ghosts or some shit."

"So, it's haunted?"

"Allegedly. But I guarantee you it was just some of the squatters, that, or some kids playing a prank. You're not skittish about that stuff, are you?"

"Uh, no, I'm good. I don't really believe in ghosts."

"Thank God. The last guy drove me fucking nuts about this superstitious paranormal shit. Best of luck, kid."

"I'm twenty-nine."

"...Okay...Bye..."

Eventually, the mail came: a bright orange reflective vest, along with a set of keys, all of them discolored with age. Phone calls and applications are one thing, but actually receiving my vest just made it a little more real. Dad walked by, patted me on the back, and congratulated me. Mom made me supper to take with me. I had a thermos full of chicken noodle soup, a spoon, and a bowl. As for entertainment, I brought my phone, a charger, and a Bluetooth speaker with me, as well as a copy of 'Outer Dark' by Cormac McCarthy. I also brought an aluminum baseball bat. I was set, I pounded an energy drink and went off to my new job.

I knew it wouldn't be a looker, but the damn place was rough-looking. The exterior was covered in moss, rain stains, and cracks. The entrance had faded signage and milk colored glass. I looked towards the keys in my pocket and fiddled for the right one to unlock the front entrance. Once inside, it was darker than I expected. Usually, malls have skylights, but I found my answer when I looked up to find that the skylights were darkened by leaves and rainwater. There were only scant little dots of light that pierced through; the floor almost looked like it was decorated in stars. 

The interior, remarkably, was unscathed by the outdoors. Now, it wasn't perfect, not by any stretch of the imagination. The air was musty, dust coated everything, and I was most certainly convinced there were rats in here scurrying about and digging around. The size of this place was immense; although it was only a single story, the vast amount of open space gave it an almost temple-like appearance. It felt like I was walking on hallowed ground, and in a way, I was; this used to be people's whole world back in the day. I walked around admiring old stores that I'd not seen in the better part of a decade, some I'd never even heard of at all. But it was interesting, the whole place was frozen in time, it was kind of tragic, really. This place used to be full of people, and now it's a husk. 

I got a phone call, the sound was so loud that I nearly jumped out of my skin. I reached for it and saw it was Mick,

"You there, kid?"

"Yeah, I'm here."

"Have you found where your station is?"

"I just walked in ten minutes ago, and this place is pretty damn big, so no."

"Well, it's set up in the food court. We put up a site cabin in the food court. It's dead center in the mall, you can't miss it. If you're lost, follow the mall maps."

"Thanks again. Hey, just curious, why the food court?"

"Hm. Well, we had a security room, equipped with cameras and everything. Then we got black mold, moisture tore up the cameras, and...listen, it just went to shit, okay?"

"Sorry, didn't mean to pry."

"Eh, you're fine, kid. Just find your post and settle in."

"Thanks, Mick."

"No problem."

I walked down the mall corridors, noticing the glimmers of lights from the obscured skylights were starting to change color, and more importantly, they were starting to dim. I whipped out my flashlight and turned it on; the harsh, pale light illuminated the floors and walls brilliantly. I definitely got my money's worth when I bought it on sale; the damn thing was like a mini sun. I followed the corridor until I came to a large opening. A busted-up plastic sign above the entrance read: 'FOOD COURT'. In the center was exactly what Mick said would be there, a site cabin. Dark green windows and a generator next to it to give it power.

I flicked it on, and the lights within the cabin blasted through the windows and onto the floor of the court. All around me was a massive array of overturned tables, chairs, trash, and cracked tiled floors. It was just peachy. I entered the cabin and found it strangely welcoming. The rest of the mall was dark, damp, and just plain creepy. This was a small room with comforting warm lights and enough room to kick back and relax.

The first few hours were extremely boring. I made my rounds, took notes on any suspicious activity or any signs of forced entry. I came across some graffiti of a pig in a cop uniform, a graveyard with cartoon ghosts, and lastly a shittly drawn swastika that someone x'ed out with red paint. I returned to the site cabin and looked at my phone for the time: 9:59 pm. 

"Jesus Christ."

I decided to take a seat and read some chapters of 'Outer Dark'. I was listening to Bruce Springsteen over the Bluetooth speaker, and that's when I heard a very loud and visible scream from the dark. I fell backwards from my chair and landed on the floor with a thud. I could hear the reverberations of the scream still echoing in the mall's emptiness. I got myself up, reached for my bat, and ran into the mall. I clicked on the flashlight, waving it around me to see if I could spot anything. 

"Hey! Show yourself!"

I got no reply. So I went around, looking through every corner of the mall. My first thought was that some little fucker thought it'd be funny to scare the new nightwatch guy. Another thought I had was that someone broke in and got scared by a rat, or worse, hurt. Yet, I spent an entire hour looking the mall up and down. The stores, the food court, the theater, everywhere. No one. Not a sign of a person. I didn't let my mind wander to the paranormal. If anything, I was pissed someone screamed, scared the shit out of me, and dipped.

The rest of the night was thankfully uneventful. I made it halfway through the book when Mick called, 

"Hello?"

"How're you holding up? You only have two hours to go."

"Fine. Some jackass came into the store and screamed. Scared the shit out of me."

"Yeah, probably some teens, they get their jollies on seeing workers scared."

"Why are you up so late?"

"Why not?"

I didn't respond to it and just changed the subject.

"Everything is good besides that. There's some graffiti near the K&B Toys, the Spencers, and the uh...Hot Topic."

"Noted. I'll have some guys clean it up during the day. You're doing great, kid, you're doing great. Remember to be back at the same time tomorrow, okay?"

I collapsed into my bed when I came home. I had no dreams, but I awoke feeling sore and tired from all of the walking I did yesterday. I returned the next day and was less creeped out by the interior this time. However, I did take note of something I had never noticed the first night. The mall must've closed during Christmas. Hanging from the ceiling were threads of tinsel of red, green, and gold. There were delapitated trees decorated in bulbs that were sometimes whole and sometimes broken. And when I walked past the stores, I noticed that they were themed for Christmas. Then I walked past. The theater was even showing *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*, and on top of the marquee, there was a massive sign that said,

'HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM ALCOVE MALL!'

"How the fuck did I miss that?" I murmured to myself.

The night was normal, I finished my book, and started another. This time I chose to read 'The Ninth Configuration'. Unlike the last book, I finished this one in one sitting, and I was left just listening to music the rest of the night. It was boring, but I could handle boring if it meant getting paid.

The next day, something new happened: I found six teens smoking weed near the fountain where my Mom used to read. There was a nativity scene with a plastic Jesus, Mary & Joseph. The kids were halfway through talking about how creepy the mall was when I turned the flashlight on them, and they scurried away like roaches before I could say anything to them. When I turned around to look at the fountain, I saw a face staring at me from the ceiling. Stark white with black eyes. I almost screamed, but when I looked closer, it was angelic but plastic. I pointed the flashlight at the rest of it and realized it was an angel, dangling from the ceiling. Golden wings, red robe, yellow hair, & she even had a little halo attached to the crown of her head.

“How in the fuck did I miss you?!”

I got up, brushed myself off, and walked around to finish looking over everything else before I went back to the site cabin. Oddly enough, this looked more Christmassy. The store windows had little advertisements for holiday sales, and there was more holiday decor within the gutted stores. Turned over plastic Santa’s, styrofoam snowmen, and there were even paper snowflakes hanging from within the stores. And strangely, all of this felt new, but it couldn’t have been new. Everything was old, weathered, and aged by time. 

I returned to the cabin to find a rat sniffing my thermos,

“HEY, GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!”

It scurried away, and I shoed it out of the room. I sat in my chair and texted Mick about the kids. He just sent a thumbs-up emoji. I got three chapters into Under the Dome when a loud electronic screech assaulted my ears. I clasped my hands over them and gritted my teeth until it stopped. It took me a second to realize what it was.

It was the Mall’s sound system, turning on. Then, it started to play music:

*Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy*
*Do you hear what I hear?*
*(Do you hear what I hear?)*

My skin began to crawl as Bing Crosby’s voice played on the scratchy speakers and echoed into the grand emptiness that was Alcove Mall. I called Mick, but he didn’t answer. The song continued, so I grabbed my bat and headed to the control room. I don’t give a shit about the mold; somebody was fucking with me. I ran down to where the control room was, busted open the door to find…nothing. I pulled my shirt up over my nose as I observed the dead equipment that littered the room. Then, just as abruptly as it started, the music was gone.

When I awoke the next evening, I had a missed text. I opened it to check who it was from, and I saw Mick’s contact.

**U TRY TO CALL ME?**

I replied,

**yeah, someone was playing music over the speakers in the mall. Went to check but found no one**

**WEIRD**

**Can the speakers be turned on?**

**NOT AT THIS POINT, THEY PROBABLY WOULDN’T WORK**

**well, they worked just fine last night.**

**WELL IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, KEEP ME POSTED**

**Sure thing.**


The next night got stranger. I went inside, and this time, there was a little metal sign pointing towards the center of the mall: ‘MEET SANTA CLAUS!’

I gripped my baseball bat a little tighter and headed for the site cabin, I was sure that this wasn’t here before, but maybe I was just tired, or stressed, or whatever the fuck. At this point, the Christmas stuff was starting to make me worry about my own Christmas shopping. My brother Stephen had been wanting a new pair of steel-toed boots for his work, but Mom said she didn’t want anything but made it abundantly clear she wanted a new sewing machine. Then there was my Dad, who was impossible to buy for; whatever he needed, he bought himself. While I was in the cabin, I fell asleep. I know we weren’t supposed to sleep on the job, but it was just one of those sudden things. I don’t know if it was sleep deprivation or not, but I just went. 

The speakers turned on, music played again, it was Gene Autry:

*Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane*

I jolted awake and grabbed my bat in a singular motion. I left the cabin, bat in one hand, flashlight in the other, looking around. I walked on, looking around the old Christmas decorations, waiting to see somebody with a speaker, CD player, record player, whatever the fuck could’ve been playing music this loud. I didn’t want to believe it was the speakers, Mick said it himself that they didn’t work. Yet, here I was listening to *Here Comes Santa Claus* in a dead mall.

I turned the corner and was stopped in my tracks. There, by the fountain, was a setup to meet Santa Claus. There was damped fake snow, decrepit fake trees, and a red throne. In front of it all was an old camera & a withered flash umbrella.

This wasn’t here before; this time, I was sure of it. Yet, all of it was old, like it had been here since it closed. But I know I’m not crazy, right? Maybe someone put these here, got them from a storage closet, and placed them. That was the only explanation. Then, in the distance behind the 'Meet Santa', barely visible to my light within the dark was something that made my skin break out in gooseflesh. I had to have been hallucinating, but I could've sworn I saw a man dressed up in a Santa outfit. The jolly red suit was filthy, and the fake beard was dangling from a face that I couldn't see. I shouted,

"Hey!"

The figure did not move, the song began to skip, repeating the same phrase over and over,

*Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus*

It began to run at me, fast. The boots were clopping onto the floor like horse hooves on cobblestone streets. I wish I could've told you that I was heroic and stood my ground. I dropped my bat and ran as fast as I could back to the site cabin. I could hear it running behind me, the boots thudding growing closer, too close. All while the sadistic, repetitive Christmas jingle blasted through the distorted speakers. I made it to the food court and slammed the door behind me, locking it back. I waited for something to start pounding at the door...but nothing came. The music stopped, but I just sat there in the cabin, waiting. I wasn't taking any chances whatsoever; I'm pretty sure I was petrified in fear. 

Eventually, I fell asleep. I don't know when or how, but I did. I was awoken by a phone call from Mick.

"Hey, what's going on, kid?"

"Mick, someone broke into the mall and chased me!"

His voice got very low and serious,

"Tell me everything. I'll call the police if I have to."

"It's one guy, he's wearing an old Santa outfit, and...I just got freaked out, man! I just ran!"

"Shhhh! Calm down. Is he still in the Mall?"

"I'm not sure, I think so!"

"Okay, okay. Right now it's...it's three AM, just call it and go home, okay? I'll chip in a bonus for you for Christmas, sound good?"

I didn't know what was crazier, the bonus or having me just try to walk out of here when that guy was still here. I just responded with a simple,

"Okay."

"Good. I'll call the police; they'll be there shortly. You can't stay where you are, you're gonna have to let them in."

"O-okay, I-I can do this."

"Stay strong, kid."

I shone my flashlight out of the windows of the cabin to see if anything was waiting for me outside. There was nothing. I grabbed the keys and ran for the exit. The moment I left the cabin, the music started up again, the scratchy speakers blaring a new song,

*Do you hear what I hear? Said the night wind to the little lamb, Do you see what I see?*

I was running past the fountain and looked at the nativity scene near it. Everything was where it was, except that the angel that was suspended above them. It was gone. I felt fear jolt through my body like lightning, and I continued to run. The song began to skip,

*Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear?*

Within the dead stores, I saw dull Christmas lights start to illuminate the path before me, and that's when I heard great swooshes from behind me. It sounded like a pair of great wings rising and falling. I looked behind me. Within the dark, barely lit halls of Alcove Mall, the plastic angel was flying above me. Her plastic shell was lit by dull reds and greens, and the artificial wings, defying all common sense, flapped like some mythical bird. The door was so close; I had to make it. My legs were aching, but I pushed through the pain until I reached the door. I scrambled for the keys, the sound of the wings grew closer, and the music loudly taunted me with the repeated phrase over and over. I found the right key and sprinted into the night air.

I was gasping when I exited the mall, sucking down all of the freezing cold air. Sirens were wailing in the distance, and I felt a relief that I'd not felt before or since. I pointed towards the mall and told them everything. I sounded hysterical, and I was, to be honest, who wouldn't be after experiencing what I did. Mick showed up shortly after, and to make sure I was okay. By the time they searched the building up and down, they didn't see anyone, and asked me for the Mall Santa's description, but I couldn't give anything other than what he was wearing. I didn't mention the plastic angel; no one would believe me if I did. After they wrote up the report, Mick turned to me and said he'd treat me to Breakfast.

The Waffle House was empty, its yellow lights illuminating the wet asphalt of the parking lot. Mick covered the meal, and I got eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and some waffles. He got waffles, sunnyside-up eggs, and ham. We ate in silence until he asked,

"You gonna be okay?"

"Yeah."

"I'll be hiring more help soon. Less work, more free days."

I didn't know whether this was a blessing or not, considering I'd have to go back. I came close to telling him I wanted to quit, but the money was good, especially with the holidays coming up and tuition still piling up. I just said,

"I appreciate it."

"Hey, you've got the next two weeks off, enjoy Christmas. And expect that bonus soon."

"Funny, I kinda don't want to think about Christmas anymore."

"Aw, how come?"

"Because of all the Christmas shit in the mall, the decorations, the ads, the music..."

"What are you talking about?"

"You're joking, the whole place was full of decorations!"

"...Kid, we stripped that mall of everything years ago. All that's left on the walls and ceiling is just old paint."

I am writing this because I know what I saw. I know that Mick means well, but he wouldn't believe me. I'm not sure my family would believe me either. But right now, I awoke first on Christmas morning to get the presents ready for everyone to open, and I found one I didn't recognize. It was an oblong box with old school-looking wrapping paper, and it simply read,

FROM SANTA CLAUS

I opened it, and I found my baseball bat. The same one I dropped on the filthy mall floor two weeks ago. Beneath it was a Christmas themed gift card that read,

*IT'S ALWAYS CHRISTMAS AT ALCOVE MALL!*
