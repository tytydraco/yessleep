Ever since I was a young girl, I needed to be the center of attention. No one could outshine me. My hair had to be the silkiest, my skin the brightest, and my smile the most irresistible. I couldn’t bear the thought of someone else taking the spotlight. I tested my charm early—on my friends’ boyfriends, no less. One by one, they gravitated toward me. Their loyalty didn’t matter. What mattered was the power I held over them. My beauty was my currency, my weapon, my shield.

When I married my husband, I thought I’d finally settled, but I quickly grew bored. He worked tirelessly to provide for me, but what was the point of having someone who was already mine? It was too easy. I craved a challenge, and that’s when Roger entered my life.

Roger was my remote boss—a charismatic, successful man. When he visited India to oversee a major project, I made sure to be in the spotlight. I wore my lightest baby pink shades, styled my hair to perfection, and spoke in the soft, lilting tone men seemed to fall for so easily. It wasn’t long before I saw the spark in his eyes. He was enamored, completely captivated by me.

I knew what I was doing. Roger wasn’t just a man; he was a symbol of power, control, and validation. And he wasn’t like the others—he was married, which made the conquest all the sweeter. His wife was miles away, and I was right there, pulling him deeper into my web. By the time he returned to the U.S., he was smitten, setting up “special projects” that only I could handle. Late-night calls turned into intimate conversations. He told me about his wife, about how distant they’d become, and I played my part perfectly, telling him about my own lonely marriage.

Eventually, during one of those late-night calls, he confessed he loved me. “You’re the only one who truly sees me,” he said. That was all I needed. I revealed my body to him over the screen, whispered how neglected I felt, and from that moment, he was mine.

His obsession grew. Roger spoke endlessly about me at work, granted me privileges, and even lashed out at colleagues who dared to criticize me. I basked in the jealousy of others. Rhea, my manager, couldn’t hide her disgust, but I didn’t care. Roger’s favoritism protected me, and the whispers of resentment only fueled my ego.

But last night, it all came crashing down.

Roger’s wife wasn’t supposed to find out. She wasn’t supposed to walk into his office while we were on a call, let alone see him touching himself as my naked body filled his screen. I’ll never forget the moment her fury erupted. She slammed her hands on the keyboard, accidentally turning our private call into a broadcast across the entire company. I watched in horror as her voice carried through the speakers, calling him a cheater, a narcissist.

“And Priyam?” she spat. “This hussy from work?!”

I felt the air leave my lungs as name after name appeared in the call list. My colleagues’ faces appeared, their expressions shifting from shock to disgust. The whispers started the next day, but now they were louder, sharper, inescapable. Roger avoided me, and everyone else did too.

That night, I locked myself in my bathroom, clinging to the only truth I’d ever known: *I still have my beauty. I still have my youth. That’s what matters.* But then the itching started. It wasn’t new, but it was worse—spreading across my body like fire. When I looked in the mirror, I saw them: faint handprints crawling up my arms and neck, as if my skin was being claimed by unseen forces.

I scrubbed until my skin was raw, but the marks only darkened. And then I heard them—the voices.

“You have such an ugly heart, Priyam"

“You are a snake.."

The faces of the men I’d used appeared in the mirror, their hollow eyes accusing me. Their whispers grew louder, suffocating me with their anger, their pain, and how I'm ugly in their eyes.

“No,” I whispered, trembling. “No! I’m still beautiful. I’m still young!”

I swung my fist into the mirror, shattering it. The glass cut deep into my skin, blood dripping onto the floor, but I didn’t stop. Grabbing a shard, I slashed at the dark marks, screaming, “I’ll cut you off! I’ll get rid of you!”

But the marks wouldn’t fade, and the faces wouldn’t disappear. They were etched into my skin, my very being, a haunting reminder of everything I’d taken and destroyed. As I collapsed onto the floor, surrounded by blood and broken glass, I repeated the words like a mantra: *I’m still beautiful. I’m still young.*

But even I didn’t believe them anymore.
