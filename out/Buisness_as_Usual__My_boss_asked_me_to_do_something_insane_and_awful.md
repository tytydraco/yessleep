Every day I just want to call in sick, to tell my boss that i have some kind of stomach problem and I simply cannot work today. Its a thought I'd had every day before this happened and id always stuffed it down. I knew my parents wouldn't like me skipping work, they always tell me i need to be doing something if I'm not going to college yet.

I have to drive to work at four in the morning on unpaved, snowy roads, after scraping the snow off my shitty car which was not made for this weather. All i could think was how the hell did it start snowing all of a sudden? Just yesterday it was sunny, and dry, in a cold winterey sort of way. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.  But when my alarm rang, I was greeted with a serene coat of white covering the world outside. I looked out at the serene beauty of nature with nothing but dread. My younger brother will almost certainly spend the whole day watching Minecraft videos on YouTube, since school will give him the day off due too the dangerous conditions. But unfortunately for me, my boss doesn’t care if I die.  
I drove through the freshly snow-covered roads out of the suburbs, past the small towns, into to the highway between two mountains, and arrived at the shitty little building in the woods where I worked. “Funkee Monkee Pizza.” I don’t know who the fuck was going to be getting pizza at this hour all the way out here, but this is my job.

Our job at Funkee Monkee Pizza is to make a pizza every hour. There always needed to be fresh pizza ready to be served to the few people who ever came to this fucking place out in the middle of nowhere. We don’t deliver so the pizza just rots in the display case until we are required to make a new one and throw the old one in the compost bin. The compost bin is unlovingly referred to as the “Bernard Bin” due to it having a photo of our boss, Bernard, with his wide smile, giving a “thumbs up” above a label reminding you to throw it out every two hours and that you would be severely punished if you ate any of it.  
(His name isnt actually Bernard, im giving all my co-workers nicknames for privacy.

I walked past two of my co-workers, Tom and Elijah, and into the break room, praying to god Tom didn’t say anything when I walked past him. I had been up until midnight scrolling twitter, so I wasn’t exactly running on a lot of energy. We keep a coffee machine in the employee break room, but you have to sign a sheet saying you drank from it and it would be deducted from your paycheck, along with a mandatory fee for milk and sugar even if you didn’t take any. Every once in a while, I try to sneak a cup while nobody’s looking.

Tom, my co-worker strolled right into the room as I was sneakily sipping my morning brew. I nearly had a heart attack but tried my best to play it cool. He looked at me and then the sheet before whispering “Look, Cass, could you please just stop doing that?”

“Hey, look, sorry. I just forgot to sign okay, I was going to do it after I finished.” I blathered out.

“Please, you know its against the rules, and Bernard says that if we see anyone breaking these rules, we are required to report it, and that makes me complicit, ya know. I don’t want to report you, but I also really don’t like going behind Bernard’s back like this.”

Tom was a Scrawny guy, looks about 25. Tom’s the type of guy who always has a big fucking smile that can really piss you off if you’re in the wrong mood. He’s always bringing doughnuts so other people will like him, and since everyone else seems to like him, I can never bring myself to tell him to shut the fuck up. He’s also the only person here who seems to like Bernard. He tells me that Bernard is friend of his family, which is what got him the job here. Every time I hear him speak he goes on and on about how much he loves this shitty job, about how satisfying it is to make a pizza and “serve up smiles” or whatever. He’s the only person whose “customer service smile” seems remotely genuine. Or maybe he’s just really good at faking it. Overall there’s nothing wrong with him as a person I guess I just find him really annoying.

I got on the floor and saw Elijah setting up the pizza oven. He turned to me, looked me in the eye and looked back at the oven without saying a word. Elijah had been working there longer than anyone else there. His employee tag said he was 42, but his face had the stress lines you would expect of someone at least 55. His slightly greying beard was scruffy and his hair was in dreads. He had deep sunken eyes, that looked like he had the life sucked out of them over the years. He wasn’t usually very chatty, I cant remember the last time I heard him speak to anyone outside of work duties. It was kind of hard for me to have an opinion on him.

Bernard arrived about half an hour late, but he’s allowed to do that because he wasn’t going to fire himself for it. Bernard is a man with a constant corporate smile that never quite semes to reach his eyes.

Bernard strolled, or more accurately waddled, up to us. His slim fit blue shirt and skinny jeans emphasizing his obese figure. His tie was a bright purple with a paisley pattern. Every day he seemed to have a new brightly colored tie with some crazy pattern that always looked stupid on him. He had a small coffee mug with the same photo from the Bernard bin plastered onto it. He gave one of those to all of his employees every Christmas as if that made up for not paying them anything above minimum wage. “Hey there Funky Monkeys, crazy weather today am I right?”

He looked to Elijah, the only black man in the room, and joked “Elijah, my homie, you’re looking like a real funky monkey today.” I have no idea if that was an intentional racist remark or if he’s just that fucking stupid.

Tom smiled “heya Bernard, we were wondering where you were.”

“Well look,” He said casually. “I have a little bit of a special task for you today, I know this isn’t what you’re used to… I need you to hide a dead body for me.”

I thought it was another one of his weird, unfunny jokes. And that he would reveal he was actually planning another one of those “team building exercises” he makes us do after closing time without pay. Tom and Elijah seemed more confused than anything. But all doubt was done away with when Bernard dragged the body in through the front and dropped it on the floor.

It was the naked corpse of an Asian man, slightly obese, maybe early thirties. “He wasn’t wearing any clothes when I found him.” Bernard mentioned glibly. His whole naked body, with every wrinkle, every hair, freckle or glob of fat was laid bare for all of us to see. He probably wouldn’t have been happy about that fact but maybe I can take solace in the fact that he’s too dead to care. The strangest part about it was the face, it was twisted and contorted into a frozen scream. One that didn’t die when he did. The cold freezing the echoes of his last moments of maddening terror. That ruled out him dying of the cold. If he had died of frostbite, he probably wouldn’t have done so screaming.

Tom was shaking, he looked like he was on the verge of tears. Elijah was just standing completely still, mouth slightly open and with the widest eyes I’ve ever seen. I was pacing around the room with my head in my hands muttering “What the fuck” over and over again.

Tom was the first to speak up “you… want us to like, hide this?”

Before Bernard could say anything I budged in “Who is this? Why can’t you just report this?” I wanted to ask “Did you kill him?” but I doubted Bernard would answer that honestly.

“Are you kidding me? If it gets out that somebody died anywhere NEAR our establishment, what do you think what that could do to business? for sales, for customers, for the property value? I guarantee everyone in the Funkee Monkee family is gonna make a lot less tips. Look, for all I know, someone could come looking for this guy any minute, now all we got to do is move the body deep into the woods, somewhere where it won’t be associated with us. We have a few hours where the snowstorm will hide our footprints and eventually someone will find it, far away from anywhere where it could be associated with us. Now, if you are unable or unwilling to fulfill your duties here, I understand completely, but it will result in termination of employment.”

Elijah’s eyes somehow got even wider before he finally spoke up “Where do you want us to put it?” he asked with a deep exhaustion in his voice.

I turned to him angrily “I’m sorry are you just okay with this?”

He glared at me with his tired, sunken eyes “No, not really… might was well get it over with.”

Bernard, still cheery as ever was tapping away on his phone. I’ll send you a maker on google maps for where I think it would be best to dump it, it’s just out in the woods. Bit of a hike but I’m sure it’ll be fine.” He turned to Tom and put his hand on his shoulder. “You’ll do this for me right Tom? It’s a heavy body so I’ll need all three of you to carry it.” Tom started trying to stammer out a response before Bernard kept going. “Look Tom, you’ve been my best employee for a few years now, and right now I’m giving you an opportunity to go above and beyond. After all I’ve done for you, surely you owe me this one favor.”

“You… we.. we’re just going to move the body right? Like we aren’t going to hide it really? nobody’s getting hurt. The families and everyone will still get closure, right?”

“Right! yeah Tom, that’s the attitude I want to hear. I knew I could count on you. Good boy!”

I could not fucking believe what I was hearing. I watched as everyone turned to me, expectantly. “Fuck you! No! I don’t want any part in this I…..” Their stares were burning into me, killing the words in my throat. There was no way I was going through with this, but they all wanted me to. “Don’t let us down Cass. We all need this.” Bernard said through his disarming smile.

“Cass, lets just get this over with.” Elijah chimed.

Tom didn’t say anything but gave me puppy dog eyes.

“Shut the fuck up, this is fucking illegal and... I… I… I just can’t.”

Bernard’s smile disappeared for a split second, before he put it back on and stepped towards me with his hands held open to me. “Okay I’ll admit this might not be entirely legal but do you know what? We here at Funkee Monkee are a family, and as a family we need to watch out for each other, isn’t that right you two?” My two co workers nodded glumly. “Now, if you don’t want to do this for us, then we might have to find some other explanation for the body, perhaps we could even say that you suddenly snapped and killed him. you wouldn’t want that would you? His mouth was smiling like always. But his eyes, usually dull and empty, were filled with contempt. “Now, that would still be bad for our business, but it would be much worse for you. Given that, I think it would be better for both of us if you do this for us. I’ll stay here and make the pizzas, capiche?”

 

And so that’s how I ended up out in the woods, shivering in the snowstorm at 7 in the morning carrying a dead body in a bag by the legs. Trudging my feet through the snow with my only real light source being the flashlight on Elijah’s phone. My winter clothes weren’t the greatest, but I still couldn’t do anything about it.

Everyone had been completely silent for almost the entire trip. which wasn’t unusual for me or Elijah but, definitely for Tom. I could see him in front of me, Holding up the body by the stomach, barley managing with his skinny arms. “So…. how much further?” he finally peeped up. Elijah, who was in the front holding up the shoulders, grumbled “I don’t know, I can’t get a signal out here, but last I checked we were about a third the way there, give it an hour and forty minutes.”

Bernard had given us coordinates to a spot to dump the body. It was deep into the woods and off the track of any hiking trails. I had a look at the map of the area and noticed the nearest building was another pizza place about a kilometer away.

“I still can’t believe you guys agreed to this so easily.” I told them. Elijah just chuckled while Tom started sputtering. “Hey, you agreed to this as well.”

“Yeah well we could have told Bernard to just do it himself. but you guys left me alone”  
Elijah turned back to give me a dirty look. “I have a kid Cass. I can’t lose my job, I’m already making minimum wage. A week without a paycheck will kill us. I know you go home to your mommy and daddy who let you live with them cook all your meals but I’m a fucking adult who has to actually work for a living.”

I spent the next 45 seconds silently trying to figure out how to respond to that before Tom tried to change the subject. “So… who do you guys think the body is exactly? Where did he come from?”

“I think Bernard killed him.” I said. “I don’t know why, or whether he’s done this before, but he definitely murdered him.”  
Elijah laughed again. “Nah, guy like him, You think he’s some kinda serial killer? Really? He’s a shithead but I don’t think he has it in him. If he did kill this guy, he probably hit him with his car on the way here. And now he’s trying to cover it up.”

Tom seemed weirdly mad at that. “You guys Bernard is a really nice guy if you get to know him, I understand that he does some bad stuff some time, but running a business is hard and he’s doing this for the sake of our jobs and…“

“Tom. Shut the fuck up.” Elijah said, something I’d wanted to say ever since I started working here.

Tom decided to change the subject again. “Do we even know how this guy died? I couldn’t see anything obvious on the body.”

As they were bickering, I felt something I had never felt before, like several alarms in my brain, that I didn’t know were there, going off suddenly despite no stimulus. I got an implacable feeling of being watched. I can’t describe it as anything other than that. I could see that Tom and Elijah felt it tooyeah as both of them had stopped and Tom was looking around nervously. That was when I heard the footsteps, just barley audible, with the snow cushioning the steps. they were coming from right behind us. I had to force myself to turn around. It took every ounce of courage I could muster.

There was the face of a man inches away from mine, way closer than the footsteps made me think. I jumped back screaming like banshee. Tom and Elijah jolted at the sound, dropping the body bag before turning to look at the man. The flashlight on Elijah’s phone lit up his features in the pitch darkness. He was a tall Asian man, with a broad frame wrapped in a yellow winter coat. Like Bernard, He wore a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. The man looked so familiar, familiar in ways I couldn’t place until… The realization felt like getting hit by a truck.

It was the corpse. It was the same fucking guy, he didn’t just look like he could be related.  He looked exactly like the corpse we had been carrying in a bag.

“Heya there.” He said “Its funny to see other people out here in this weather, huh?”

“Oh, uhh, yeah it is.” Elijah replied “What brings yyyyYYYYOOoouuuu……. Uh… out here?” I could hear in Elijah’s voice the exact moment when he noticed it too.

“Oh nothing haha, just enjoying the winter weather y’know. Hey, what’s in that bag you guys are carrying?”

 “Oh, just some supplies. For work.” Tom sounded completely calm and composed despite the situation.

Tom added “Yeah, yeah, our car broke down and y’know we have to carry all these supplies to work.”

I could feel my heart beating in my ears. Every cell in my body was telling me this guy was bad news, or maybe that was just the fear of getting caught. The more questions he asks the more he could tell to someone investigating the body once it gets found. but it was hard to focus on not getting caught when there was a much bigger issue at hand. I knew that whatever this was, I had to get rid of him.

“Well, we should probably get going, hope you have a nice day sir!” I said in my best customer service voice. Smiling through my teeth just like he was.

“Yes you’re right, I best be on my way, although I think I wouldn’t mind helping you guys carry that bag, it looks almost as heavy as me, haha.”

“Ohhhh… Nonono sir you don’t have to do that we wouldn’t want you to waste your hike through this lovely weather on us. we hope to see you again sometime.” Inside my head I was fucking begging him to just leave.

“oh sure, haha. Hey, where do you guys work by the by? I’d love to stop by there sometime.”

Tom answered before I could “Oh, just Funkee Monkee pizza. Look it up sometime. Bye!”

Idiot.

“Well, I’ll be seeing you around. Laters!”  He trudged off into the snow covered forest, footsteps much louder than they were when he was walking towards me. He turned back to look at us for a split second just as the darkness swallowed him up and he was gone. Him leaving felt like watching a storm pass. Elijah turned the light on his phone back towards the direction we were going. As im recounting this, I’m only now realizing he seemed completely unbothered by the light from Elijah’s phone shining right in his face.

 

We wandered deeper into the forest. the snow kept getting thicker, the sun was still absent. We still couldn’t find a spot where we could get a signal. Nobody seemed to want to discuss what the fuck just happened or who that was. If we had lost our way and were going in the wrong direction we would have no way of knowing. Tom said something about how a couple of trees looked familiar, but neither of us knew what to do about that. At that point I wasn’t sure how we would even know we were at the dumping spot when we got there. We saw a broken down abandoned cabin.

After who knows how long I felt Tom tap me on the shoulder before whispering.

“He’s following us.”

I began frantically scanning the dark forest, seeing absolutely nothing but snow covered trees. I whispered the message to Elijah. This seemed to agitate Tom, who I guess was hoping we wouldn’t speak aloud.

Elijah didn’t even bother whispering. “Who? The guy from earlier?”

“Yeah,” said Tom, “the guy from earlier, he’s trailing behind.”

Elijah scanned the trees behind us with his flashlight as I had, also finding nothing.

“What do we do?” I asked

Tom thought about it for a second. “I think we should have someone confront him while the others take the body away. Keep him distracted.”

The idea of being alone with that guy sent a chill down my spine. I couldn’t describe why or how. He was already creeping me out when we outnumbered him. “Bad idea. Bad fucking idea.”

Elijah nodded. “Yeah I don’t know about that, he gives me a bad vibe.”

Tom seemed absolutely taken aback. “What why? just cause he kind of looks like the guy who died?”

There was more to it than that, but I felt like I just couldn’t vocalize it in a way that made sense so I kept my mouth shut.

“Look, most likely, he’s related to the guy.” Tom whispered.  “He might be looking for him which could be a problem. If we distract him long enough to drop off the body, we can report it, giving him closure and hiding suspicion.”

“Do you think he suspects something about us?” Elijah asked. “Why else would he be following us?”

“Well, all the more reason to get him off of our trail. So keep your eyes out for him.”

Me and Tom both took out our phones for the flashlights. I hoped that deep seated instinct from before would start telling where he is, that primal feeling of being watched keeping me safe, but I felt absolutely nothing. Does that mean he isn’t here and I’m safe? I had no way of being sure. that was honestly more frightening than if I felt his presence.  Trudging through the snow now felt like we were prey being hunted by a predator. One that we don’t even know the nature of. We don’t even know where we were going. Just hoping we had been heading in the right direction. I did not like the idea of finding out we were going the wrong way and having to turn back, only to find him trailing behind us. Being the one in the back meant if he snuck up on us, I would be the first person he got to.

As we hiked I began to feel a little at ease, which might have been wishful thinking. I wanted to believe that he had left us alone and we could dump the body in peace. It was still so dark despite how long we had been out there.  After a while I heard Elijah stop and mutter. “Holy shit holy shit holy shit.” he was looking at something in front of us.

Tom started panicking, looking ahead. He and Bernard were blocking my view so I couldn’t see what it was.

I had to ask “is it him?”

“No,” Tom replied. “We got to tell Bernard about this when we get back, this is really bad.”

“What are you talking about? Who are you talking about?”

Tom and Elijah looked back at me before shifting to the side to give me a better view. There was another body lying in the snow. Up against a tree. It was covered in snow, but it looked naked, with a face frozen in a deep scream. Tom got out from under the belly of the body bag, leaving me and Elijah to have to support the weight. He ran up to the body. Examining it. “I think it’s uh… a woman, looks maybe….. 65? I don’t see any cuts or anything.” He began looking around with his phone scanning the snow until he saw it. A lump in the snow. I set down the bodybag by the legs before apolizing to Elijah. I inched towards the bump slowly, I got a feeling I recognized its shape. but I desperately hoped I was mistaken. I began to cautiously dig through the snow on top of the bump,  trying to scrape it with my gloved hands., as if the snow was trying to fight back against me. I was met with a dead blue screaming face, lit up by my phone. I turned to Elijah and Tom who were staring at me with dread.

“How many more? Do you think?” I asked.

Elijah sighed “Who knows. There could have been dozens that we just didn’t see.”

Tom was hyperventilating at this point “Oh God, Ohhhh god the the hell. W-what happened here how did they die? What is this?”

“I don’t know what you’re asking us for.” Elijah replied.

I asked “Do you think we could just leave the body here? There’s no way we are too close to the restaurant. It would be fine. We could send in an anonymous tip and they would find this body among the others.” Elijah suggested.

“I’ll ask him.” Tom said. I noticed his phone was dialing. I wanted to tell him no but he was already going.  “I got a small signal, I’m telling Bernard about all of this.”

“What the fuck is Bernard going to do? Come up with another insane, poorly thought out plan and then force us to stick to it, I don’t want to hear whatever he- “

Bernard’s blaring voice on the phone interrupted me.

“Hellooo, Funky Monkey Pizza. Just to clarify, we do not deliver, what can I do for you?”

“Heeeyy… It’s Tom, we found more bodies in the woods.”

“Shit, are they close to the restaurant?”

“yeah, like halfway away from the restaurant and the drop off point.”

“Well move them too.”

Tom was stunned. Elijah just groaned and rolled his eyes.

I sputtered out “What all of them?”

“Yes all of them. We can’t let a single body be found near our establishment!”  

I looked around the place. We had no clue how many bodies there even were. For all we know, there could have been hundreds of bodies buried in the snow that we didn’t see. and any body we missed that gets found would be blamed on us. Plus that guy was in the area, possibly watching us. I could already see Tom unzipping the body bag, dragging the body of the old woman into it.

“There’s a guy who might be stalking us.” Elijah mentioned. “We don’t know where he is but we saw him following us.”

Bernard paused for a second “Hmmm… yeah that does seem like quite the pickle, if anyone sees you doing anything with a body you would have to kill them haha.”

A silence hit everyone in the group like a truck. We were too stunned to say anything. the shock of what he had said left all of us shooting glances at each other hoping they would be the one to break the silence until Tom cracked.  “Uhh… Bernard are you, like, telling us to kill somebody. I- I don’t want to kill anyone, I think that’s a really bad idea.”

“WOAH! hold your horses there kiddo I’m not telling anybody to do anything. I’m just stating the obvious fact that if somebody saw you doing something illegal like this, your only real option would be to kill them y’know? After all, that’s the only way to stop all of us from going to jail since corpses don’t talk. Is it wrong to state facts?”

I could not believe what I was hearing. there is no way he thought any of us would buy that. Then again its not like I could think of a better solution if someone sees us. “Yeaahh… we um, know how being dead works.” Although given what I had seen today I might not be sure about that.

“Good” Bernard said “So we’re on the same page then.”

“uh… Are we??”

Elijah chimed in “I think we are.” Me and Tom looked at each other, hoping the other knew what to make of that.

“Alright, you two keep your eyes peeled for anyone who might be watching us alright.” Elijah was speaking to me and Tom like we were his personal soldiers.

Tom hung up and looked at Elijah, “We aren’t killing anyone alright. we can find another way to deal with it.”

“When did I say I we were going to kill anyone?” Elijah asked. there was an apprehension in his voice.

We still had to do our jobs though. I thought about running away right then and there, but I was already doing something illegal with three witnesses. If I leave, then Tom would be alone with Elijah, but if me and Tom outnumber him, maybe we could stop anything to drastic from going down.

And then we could spend half of our lives in jail. I didn’t know what the penalty for this is exactly, but I knew it wasn’t good. I don’t know how we were going to convince anyone who sees us not to talk but I knew we had to try. It’s better than the alternative. If there was ever a point where I had a choice here, I missed it.

Tom tried stufffing the old woman’s body into the bag with the other one, but decided it would be too heavy. We decided it would be better to take the bodies one at a time. we had no clue how long that would take but we hoped there wouldn’t be any more bodies.

Suddenly Elijah shouted. “Over there!”

I couldn’t see anything, but was looking off into the trees at something I couldn’t see. I thought it was another body at first but that hope was quickly put to rest.

“It’s someone watching us. Not the guy from earlier, it was a woman. She was behind that tree.” Elijah began to sprint towards where he thought he saw our stalker. me and Tom exchanged knowing glances.

“Hey Elijah, what are you going to do to her?” Tom pleaded.

“I just want to talk with her.” by the sound of his voice I don’t think he did. He began pacing around a tree. “Where the hell are you?” Definitely not. His attention jolted towards another tree that I wasn’t looking at. “What the hell?” He ran towards a different tree. “She was just behind this tree didn’t you see it?” I looked around trying to see who he was talking about, until I saw an old woman peeking out from behind a tree next to the one Elijah was looking around. She was smiling. Her features looked subtly familiar until I realized who it was, I turned back to look at the screaming body of the old woman. It was the same woman. Just like the Asian man we met before, the corpse that was lying there screaming looked just like her. I froze in terror before looking back to the old woman who was now looking at me. She was wearing a yellow winter coat and had her mouth contorted into a smile showing all her crooked teeth her eyes were wide open and yet it was like I couldn’t see anything beneath them. I looked to Tom, he saw her too. Eliah turned around and noticed her and jumped in shock, falling back and dropping his phone. She ducked her head behind the tree, hiding herself completely from us.  “Do something you dumb shits, get her, she’s running away. I couldn’t see her running behind the tree but I took his word for it. Tom ran up to Elijah and grabbed him by the arm.

Tom pleaded with him “Stop! Stop It, What are you doing. We aren’t killing any-” Elijah punched him square in the face, knocking him on his ass in the snow. Elijah didn’t say a word before running off into the darkness, the light from his phone bobbing up and down as he ran through the pitch black darkness.

I checked on Tom who was groaning. There was blood from his nose leaking onto the snow he looked up at me and yelled “Stop him, please!”

I ran off towards where I thought Elijah had gone, until I saw his flashlight scanning the trees. desperately around him. I picked up a large tree branch and held it like a club.

“What the fuck do you think your doing?” I screamed at him.

Elijah turned his head towards me, shining his phone directly in my eyes like a flashbang. “That woman’s old, she’s lived a full life. My Daughter hasn’t.” I didn’t even know if that old woman was alive, or human. “I don’t know how the hell she’s so fast though. HELP ME LOOK FOR HER.”

“Th-that woman.” I replied “She looked exactly like the corpse of the old woman we found screaming

Elijahs eyes widened. “oh shit, just like the…” I could see gears turning behind his eyes, each rotation causing his eyes to grow wider and wider, his lips starting to quiver.

We were cut off abruptly by an ear-piercing scream. It echoed through the forest like the call of an animal but it was distinctly a human scream. It was Tom. Elijah and I sprinted back to where we had left tom. We were running like a deer that had been seen by a wolf. when we got to where we remember leaving Tom, he wasn’t there. The other bodies weren’t there either. We were frantically scanning our flashlights around, trying to find where tom left them, but we saw absolutely nothing except the empty body bag.

“Tom!” I screamed out. “Tom what happened?” I couldn’t see any footprints around. despite the snow, there would still be some footprints visible to us if Tom had wandered off. there was nothing indicating the three bodies were dragged away

“I don’t think Tom’s here Cass,” Elijah responded “I think whatever that thing is, it took away all the “dead bodies while we were distracted.”

“You think it took all three bodies on its own just like that?” I snapped

“I think it took all four bodies just like that yes.” Elijah looked at the ground solemnly.

Elijah looked at the blood in the snow from where he had punched him. “Maybe she got him because we left him weak and vulnerable. I knocked him on his ass and you left him alone.”

I began to shake uncontrollably, crying. “TOM PLEASE CAN YOU HEAR US?” I was met with no sound but the constant droning blizzard and wind that I had been listening to all morning. I don’t know what I was crying about, I didn’t even like Tom all that much. “WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU MAN?”  I looked to Elijah with tears in my eyes. “This is all your fucking fault you know that.”

Elijah shrugged. He was looking down at the ground he was hiding his eyes from me “Can’t do much about it now.” There was a crack in his voice. He looked at the body bag for a second. “I say we just take this back and say we dumped all the bodies at the sight. We don’t know what else we can do.

I was keeping my distance from him, tree branch in hand

He checked his phone before walking off in whatever direction it told him the restaurant was. He looked back at me and said “I don’t feel like staying in this forest any longer.”

For the rest of the walk back we didn’t say a word to each other. I kept looking around for signs of someone watching us but there was nothing. It was about 11AM so we could finally see without flashlights. Around every tree, rock and bush I expected to see someone watching us, to see the Asian man, the old woman, or even Tom smiling at us. But somehow we were left alone the entire time. Maybe whatever it was had it’s fill. Or maybe it was trying much harder at hiding itself. So all I had to keep me company was the silent Elijah trailing behind me and my own thoughts. My mom had taken me hiking in some woods near here when I was a kid. so these woods had always felt so safe and comforting up until now. When I finally saw the warm glow of FUNKEE MONKEE’s PIZZA just as it felt like my legs were going to give out from all the walking it was like seeing a lighthouse. I had never before been happy to see this place.

I there were no cars outside except the employee owned ones. I ambled into the empty pizzeria, I slumped down on the nearest chair to the entrance, throwing off my winter coat and taking time to catch a breath. Elijah came in after me and did the same. My legs felt almost numb, at this point. after all that had happened my body yearned for the opportunity to just sit down and not do anything. The pizza ovens warmed up the place quite nicely.  I wanted this brief reprive to last forever. I saw the no smoking sign taunting me from the wall. I looked to the pizza stands, with their shitty, greasy pizza shimmering from the lights. I collapsed down on a three seated round table next to the front door. Elijah came in after me and sat across from me, leaving the third seat empty.

“you’re not out of the woods just yet!” Bernards voice called.

“what?”

He stuck his head out from inside the kitchen. He was eating one of the doughnuts Tom brought “gotta get to work, remember? You are still on the clock.” He pointed to a clock on the wall with a sticky note on it that read **You** in big bold letters. Bernard was smiling from ear to ear at his hilarious joke.

I sat in silence for a few seconds, not wanting to move before I mumbled. “Tom is dead.”

“What?”

“Tom is dead. he died out there.”

“Oh…” Bernard said it with the same tone as if I told him there was a dead skunk in the parking lot. “well shit.”

 

The story Bernard came up with for Tom’s disappearance was he turned off the security cameras (right around the time Bernard came in with the body, which is why there’s no footage after that point) and started trying to steal all the money from the cash register, only to get caught by his employees and run off into the woods, never to be seen again. The police bought it as far as I can tell.

It's been a week since then. Elijah brought his daughter in on his day off. She’s 7 years old, cute kid. She seemed so happy to be here, even though the pizza crust felt like cardboard and the cheese tasted like plastic, and it was covering the sourest marinara you’ve ever tasted, she gobbled it up like it was fine dining. Elijah was unusually chatty that day, and at one point, while he was talking with one of my other co workers, he looked directly at me with his tired eyes mid conversation and said, “yeah you know, I work hard to feed her, it would be a shame if anything were to threaten my employment.” His eyes were practically burning into my flesh there before he just looked back at my co-worker, continuing his conversation as usual. That was the last time I heard him speak to me about anything other than work duties.

The hardest part of all of this is probably the fact that even after all of this, I still have to go to work tomorrow. I still have to drive into those woods every day, and walk along the floor where a dead body was dumped, and see Tom’s employee of the month portrait on the wall, and sometimes even see Elijah working the shift with me. And every day, Bernard is there, to give me his big empty corporate smile. I’ve considered telling the authorities what happened that day, but even if they would believe me, I would be implicating myself as well, and its my word against Bernard and Elijah's. I guess I'm only telling this to you guys now because i want the truth to be somewhere.

After looking into it, I found a ton of missing persons in that area. I found the old woman, who went missing three days prior. and the Asian man was reported missing a few days after Bernard found him. Still it’s impossible to tell if every missing person in this town was because of whatever I met in those woods but there are a lot of them that all seem to begin with someone going hiking there alone. Needless to say I don’t plan on going back in the woods anytime soon.
