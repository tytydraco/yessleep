My wife hasn't been herself 


Do you believe in the supernatural and the things that go bump in the night.
I surely didn't until my wife was acting unusual. Let me start from the beginning for more context. It was late winter night and my wife and I were heading to our cabin in the middle of the Canadian woods near lake Chandos about five miles away from the nearby settlement. It's a nice secluded oak tavern no different to any you see in the movies,  surrounded by beautiful pine trees as far as the eye can see, with the lake only 500 yards from the front of the tavern. During this time of the year the lake is frozen due to the extreme cold but still showing its natural beauty.
 'are we there yet'
My wife called out frustrated, 
Almost there' I retorted, barely holding my own frustration. It had been a long 5 hour trip and the heater was not working properly causing our trip to be bitter and cold. From when we left  our summer place early in the afternoon traveling was not the easiest during this time, we had to take many road detoures adding many hours to our journey. Plus my wife's constant belittling of me made the journey a lot more harder than it was.
Look out! 
I was so busy in my own thoughts that the sudden shouting took me out of my haze. I slammed on the brakes snaking my head onto the wheel, I looked up standing in my Beames was a deer  meters from my hood. I look Up from the wheel and I saw the deer's face staring at me. I felt  An odd sensation before me. A cold mocking and sadistic tone emanating from those cold and lifeless black eyes reflecting my two car beams in those eyes. It perked up and ran off into the void of the night
Dan!

Dan!
I was shot back and heard my wife screaming at me
'What the fuck dan you almost got us killed with your incompetent driving'.
Sorry 
Sorry? Is that all you got to say sorry, fuck me.
She slapped me over the head gesturing not to that again
Ow!
I turned to face her but something caught my eyes. Something in the distance is heading straight towards us.
'Whats the matter now you pale as a fucking ghost'? She snarkly said I pointed out the 'window on her side and she looked 
'There's nothing there dumbass'
'Could I be imaging those two glowing eyes, there's no way I can't just imagine them, 'they were just there?' 
'Can you turn on the engine we still got 30 min before we get to our cabin she retorted angrily'

She punched me and I got out of my daze. 
I started up the engine and headed off toward our cabin. Still pondering the two glowing eyes I saw. The snow was getting heavier making it harder to see the road. 
Luckily we made it to the cabin without any more run in with wildlife or those glowing eyes. Before the snow really turned on us we ran into our cabin and quickly closed the door behind us

'Finally  here' I exclaimed happily about the long five hour drive being over with.
 almost killing us my wife muttered as she was walking up the stairs not even glancing back at me
'I'll start the fire' 
No reassuring reads came from my wife except a grunt.

I sighed as I headed towards the cabin  fire pit. The cabin wasn't the best, it was passed down from my father and so on so it was kinda a family heirloom. My wife doesn't see the beauty as she huffs and heaves her luggage towards the upstairs bedroom. As I lit the fire I noticed an uneasy feeling like the whole room felt colder than the outside. It felt like something was watching me peering into the depths of my soul. This unnerving feeling brought chills to my spine. I looked over to make sure my wife was okay, she had made up to  her room, I thought to myself. I huffed in relief. I lighted my match and whatcha as the fire engulfed the logs turning brown from black. The light from the fire flickers, making my shadow dance on the back wall. I stood up and turned around and I stood frozen. I turned as white as a ghost and before me were two eyes staring at me the same two starry white eyes I saw a mere moment earlier that nearly caused me to crash that eye.

My stomach dropped and all my fears came true. Staring down the two eyes I couldn't move I was frozen in panic the whole world stood still that very instant. I was too afraid to move. I don't want to provoke the creature whatever it was standing outside my window. The only thing that broke my stance was my wife screaming at me. The eyes darted around my living room to find the source and quickly vanished as a loud scream echoed throughout the cabin. I ran up to see my wife throwing the lamp at me screaming as I entered the bedroom screaming  about god knows what this. The lamp hit my face causing blood to rush down my face. My wife was screaming at me about something but I couldn't focus. 

All I could focus on was the splitting headache and the blood trickling down my face. I looked at her in pure anger.
'What' I screamed
She pulled out a sheet of paper
''What do you mean what!'' she hissed
''You're divorcing me on our trip?'

''17 years I put up with this 17 long years you treated me with disrespect''.
"Fuck of and die you worthless shit you've never down anything for me!"
With those stinging words I felt my world shatter all these times. She never loved me. I knew we were growing distant after our attempt at a child but hearing those words brought pain.
I turned around and ran down the stairs
Towards my car I got in and drove All the while my wife was cursing and throwing abusive slurls at me. The nearest town  was about a five mile 30min trip in this weather. That's all the time I needed to clear my head. I made it to town just before 8pm. I headed towards the bar. It was a rudimentary and old style bar resembling a 1950 bar. It was a hell a lot better being here than at my house at the moment. The atmosphere was very welcoming. I went into the bar and ordered a double shot of whisky with chips.

 The first thing I noticed about this bar wasn't the decor resembling the 50s, it was the giant skull perched up on the bar table. I look Up at it with awe and fear. Know that such a creature could easily hunt us down. 
"It's called the wendigo an native monster to this parts"
I looked around and saw a person sitting alone.
"Pardon me?"
"It's a wendigo skull"
"I looked back in amazement" 
"But I thought these creatures were stuff of legends" do they still exist?
"Very much if you see two glowing eyes 
Your fate is sealed" the old geyser grunted 
"Sounds like a load of bullsit to me"
He looked at me with a grumpy expression and stood up.
"Well boy is this bullshit to you"
He lifted up his shirt to reveal 3 massive claw marks on his stomach.
I looked wide eyed at him. I couldn't ''believe what I'm seeing.
"A-are you sure it wasn't a bear claws?" I stammered
"No bears hibernate during these time easy prey for those things"
I looked back at the skull and into those empty black sockets.
"Shit shit!" 
"What's up boy?"
"You said that wendigo eyes glow white right"?
"Yes" he retorted back
"My wife is in a lot of danger"
"Come again lad"
"On the way here I nearly hit a dear and when I looked out I saw two glowing eyes but my wife didn't, the next incident was when I was lighting the flame and out the window"

"Well not boy you better drive home quickly"
I ran out of the bar as quickly as I could not worrying about the seatbelt as I sped off. All I could worry about is my wife. My  wife ahri. I couldn't get the thought of her dead on the couch with her guts ripped out or her head ripped off. All I could do was speed down the road. I hit 90 miles per hour. I could feel my car shaking as it wasn't meant to go this fast but that wasn't the least of my concern. 
My face went pale as I drove up the drive and saw big marks on the ground leading up the way toward the cabin. I got my flashlight and ran through the blistering cold to see the door off its hinges. My heart sank when I saw the state of the door. 

I moved the door and all of my colour drained from my body. My home was wrecked there when there were signs of a fight and struggle. Blood was covering the floor in one corner and up the wall. I feared the worst. My wife may have been slaughtered by a wendigo. I looked around and my heart jumped when I heard 
"Dan?"
I saw Ahri in the corner of the room shaking uncontrollably. 
"Ahri are you alright'
"Yes love I'm alright, a giant moose had smashed its way in".  
I looked at her in disbelief and towards the door. 
"How can a moose do that?"
Puzzled at the claw marks on the door no moose could even produce those marks let alone fit in this cabin.
I looked at ahri and she had passed out
Not wanting to push it any further I grabbed my wife and headed up towards  our bedroom and laid her onto our bed. I looked back at her in confusion why she had lied about the moose attack and how there was so much blood everywhere.

 I god the blood that's gonna take a while I thought to myself. Dreading tomorrow house choir. Out in the dark forest I pondered to myself what nightmare lay out there and how long they had been here. I heard my wife rustling on the covers, quickly covering her and extinguished the light.

That night I didn't get much sleep as our incident at the bar and running home to find a bloody mess left me with so many unanswered questions. Why did my wife lie to me was that skull truly a wendigo. I finally got to sleep around 1am. But that was short lived as I suffer from nightmares and this day didn't help. 

I woke up to the smell of eggs and bacon simmering through the house. Drawn to the smell I headed downstairs to see my wife singing a happy tune and smiling. I took one step and she perked around so quick. 
"Morning darling I cooked you breakfast"
"Uhh thank you I responded confused"
I pulled my chair out from the table to sit down. As I was doing so my wife walked up and placed the plate and gave me a kiss. 

I tried to hide my shock and confusion but my face betrayed me.
"What's wrong dear?" Ahri said with a puzzled look.
"Is the eggs too runny or the bacon too burnt?".
"No no there perfect in just surprised that your up this early" I lied
"Oh really why's that?"she retorted
"Well you usually up after me dear" I quickly replied not wanting her to see the confusion and terror on my face while I sipped my coffee. 

"Is that so she giggled" 
"I guessed I wanted to cook you breakfast" she said smiling.
As I was eating I thought back to the events of last night.
"So babe about last night?"
Don't worry about it, I cleaned and fixed the door while you were out cold.
I looked stunned and looked at the entrance of the cabin near the fireplace. What she said was true: the door looked brand new and on its hinges and there was no sight of blood anywhere. It looked like it was cleaned by a clean up crew.
"What how?"


She put a finger on my lips
 "don't worry," she whispered.
She got up from her chair and headed over to the cabin to pull a box full of bandages and medicine.
"I notice that you got a nasty scratch on your head, let me help you clean and dress your wound love then we go out to the lake."

I held my terror in as she was cleaning and dressing my wound. I forgot all about last night with everything going on but why did she not remember throwing a lamp at my head and screaming at me. This is strange what's going on.
 "The divorce paper I" screamed.
Ahri looked at me in sadness.
"Can you please get dressed and meet me by the lake" quivering under her lips.
I saw the sadness in her eyes and I nodded to reply to her question.

It took me longer to get dressed with so many thoughts going through me. I ran outside to see arhi standing by the front porch looking towards the lake.
Let go, she said quietly.

The soft crunch of snow under our feet did not ease the atmosphere between us as we slowly walked. She then stopped and looked at me.

"Babe, why do you want a divorce?"
That question made me slipp with my words as I tried to find an answer. Doesn't she remember the 17 years she had treated me like shit and the abuse she did. I was beyond comprehension filled with rage at that question. But before I answered she put a hand out to hold mine.
The moment her hand mine I felt the coldness of her hand. It was unnatural.

Her hands shouldn't have been that cold; they should be frostbitten. But yet they are beautiful and delicate.
I flinched and pulled my hand away.
She looked at me teary eyed and knelt onto the ground. 

"Please give me another chance. She said, `` I love you so very much!"

I looked at her kneeling on the ground wailing as if she lost the most important thing in her life. I need time to think about this. I picked up the paper and put them in my pocket and walked off not saying a word to my wife.
She looked up crying.
I walked back into the cabin and looked around to see that last night's incident was totally gone. I sat in the coach thinking about the past 24 hours. When I suddenly dozed off.

By the time I woke up I saw my wife staring at me from the door handle. Her expression was of nothing. The truth was that it freaked me out a bit.
She walked past me not saying a word and headed straight up to our bedroom.
Turning back towards the fireplace I saw that the log had been put out and scattered around.

I got up and put the logs back in the fireplace when I heard what sounded like a deer coming from the woods. Scared me a bit but then the most awful and gut wrenching sound replied. The only way I can describe it is that it sounded like you took a recording of a deer and slowed and added reverb to it then you sped up that slowed down reverb repeating  many times till it doesn't sound like a deer anymore.
