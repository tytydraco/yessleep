My wife and I were both in our late 20’s. Our relationship was no different to most couples that age. 

We loved each other wholeheartedly. We had our issues sure, but what couple didn’t?

One of our couple issues that we had was a disagreement over moving house. You see, we bought a little apartment when we were in our early twenties with the money we had. 

If I’m being honest, it was a total dump but it was cosy and perfect for just the two of us. 

Skip forward a few years my wife Sarah wanted to move to a more expensive house a few streets away. 

You see, Sarah’s sister Angie lived only a few doors away from this house. When Angie was 6 she fell from the second story of her home and landed poorly. This led to her being stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. 

I always understood that Sarah wanted to help her sister as much as possible. They had always been really close after the accident according to her. Lurking a few doors away would allow Sarah to engage with her family significantly easier. 

Sadly, we just didn’t have anywhere near the money to buy the house. 

Sarah however, refused to take no for an answer, even though it was literally impossible for us to buy the house. 

The weirdness started one night when I was home from work early. I decided to treat us both to some chicken teriyaki. I was a terrible cook but I wanted to do something sweet for her. 

Normally she’d make me the dinner as I was often home later so I thought I’d surprise her with my atrocious cooking.

In the middle of making our meals I remember glancing over my shoulder towards the hallway. 

I jumped back in fear as I saw Sarah standing in the open hallway glaring in my direction. 

It was odd as I hadn’t heard the sound of the door opening. Almost as though she was sneaking up on me. 

“Jesus you scared the hell out of me” I shrieked. 

Sarah didn’t respond. 

Instead she just stared at me from the luminous hallway. 

I could tell she was annoyed with me, she often gave me the silent treatment if I’d messed something up. 

“Okay what’s this about then?”

Her expressionless face suddenly changed. All of a sudden her eyes widened and mouth swung open. 

“Please help me” she muttered. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked now feeling guilty about not asking what her day was like. 

Sarah then made a bizarre little twitchy movement with her face. Her expression then changed and the frown on her face somehow twisted into a broad smile. 

“Can we please go visit that house?” 

The way she said it was almost like the way a kid that had just seen a toy through a store window. 

“It’s 6:46PM. I said no before. You know we can’t afford it too Sarah. I’d buy it if we could!” 

Sarah then ushered backwards whilst still peering into my eyes before she jolted up the stairs away from me. 

From that point onwards, Sarah began acting extremely weird.

She became very emotionless. Whenever I’d ask her questions she’d often ignore me or answer with as little effort as possible. 

Physically she was emotionless too. I’d catch her sometimes just standing still around random parts of the house. After saying her name a few times it’s almost like that would reboot her back into existence. 

Sometimes during the night I’d be awoken and look over at her. I’d see Sarah’s eyes wide open staring at the ceiling. Like she hadn’t been sleeping at all and was on 500mg of caffeine. 

Every single day, multiple times, Sarah would say the same things. 

“Please help me.” 

“Can we please go visit that house?” 

Every time after I said no, she’d walk away from me and go do something else. 

This went on for a while but on one night there was a tipping point. 

We’d both gone to bed on one late Thursday night after not talking much following the work day.

In the middle of the night I awoke to the sound of rustling coming from across the room. My blurry sleep-deprived vision could just about make out the silhouette of my wife.

For some reason she was standing in the open doorway to the bathroom. As my eyes adjusted to the dull darkness that consumed our bedroom I could see my wife’s face more clearly. 

Yet again, she was staring directly into my eyes. 

I froze with fear as I began to make out more of her facial features. 

Her hair was partially frizzy almost as though she’d been in a fight with another woman.

She looked really pale as though she had suddenly become deeply ill. 

Her eyes were what made me almost run out the house. They were broad and her pupils had dilated to a size I didn’t even think was possible. 

She looked at me as though she genuinely wanted to murder me. 

“Wh…what is it Sarah?” I nervously asked. 

She asked me in a sinister tone. 

“Can we PLEASE go visit that house?” 

At this point my fear was now conflicted with anger. This had gone on for too long. Why did she so desperately want to visit a house she knew we simply couldn’t buy? 

“Sarah NO! I’ve had enough of this every day. Just SHUT UP!” 

Sarah’s expression dampened a little however stood firm. Suddenly, I noticed a tear begin to the edge of her right eye. 

I could see she was about to begin crying. I felt awful. It was always difficult for me to see her upset. 

“Okay look Sarah I’m sorry I shouldn’t have yelled. If you really want to, we can go visit that house tomorrow after work. I’ll try set something up with the estate agent.” 

I thought that after all this buildup up and persistence, me succumbing to her questions would’ve brought about a reaction. 

Nothing. 

She didn’t react to it at all and just got into bed. I was disappointed but hoped that after we visited the house she would go back to normal. 

The next morning I tried to make a call to the estate agent we’d previously learned about. Sarah had gotten his number before as I remember she said she wanted to ask the man some questions about the house before. 

I called the number a few times and received no answer. 

Later after work I told Sarah about this hoping she wouldn’t react in a dramatic way. 

“Let’s go visit anyway” she expressed. 

“But we won’t be able to get inside? We will only see the exterior of the house?” 

“We can get inside” she said before poorly attempting to wink at me. 

She surely wasn’t suggesting we break inside of the house. I brushed it off and decided to drive her to the house. Maybe if she just saw the outside of it she would be content. 

I made the short drive with Sarah giddy in the passenger seat. We arrived at the house and before I could say a word Sarah got out the car. 

I looked at her and said. 

“Well…that’s the house!” 

She gazed at it before her eyes darted back to me. 

“Now…go inside”

“What? We don’t have the key? The estate agent didn’t even answer our calls?” I asked bemused. 

“It’s unlocked” she said with confidence. 

I started to creep up to the creamy wooden door. I then attempted to open it and to my shock it was indeed unlocked. 

At this stage my curiosity was overcoming all my other emotions and I entered the house before Sarah had even taken a step away from the car. 

Upon opening the door, the most disgusting smell I’d ever experienced swarmed me. 

It was unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. It made me gag but fortunately I didn’t vomit. 

I slowly moved into the relatively empty house before taking a left turn towards the living room. 

The smell grew stronger. 

As I now looked into the living room I could now see the source of the smell. 

My heart dropped. 

I could see a human arm sticking out from my viewpoint in the hallway.

The large couch obscured the view to the rest of the human body. I suddenly felt extremely ill. 

Cautiously I tip-toed into the living room to see behind the furniture. 

My heart dropped further as I could now see the full body. 

It…was Sarah. 

She was laying with her eyes and mouth partially hanging open. Her skin had turned a disgusting grey. 

I couldn’t fathom what I was looking at. I began to hyper-ventilate as I turned my head to the window. 

Outside I could still see what I thought was my wife, now a couple steps closer to the house. 

I looked her in the eyes before she then seemed to let out a faint smile in my direction. I then saw her slowly fade until she eventually completely disappeared. 

I burst into tears as I called the police.

After months of depression and constant panic attacks the police were able to finally comprehend the full situation and explain it to me. 

Previously, Sarah wanted to visit the house even though we couldn’t afford it. I said no to her as I thought it was a waste of time back then. 

It turns out, that behind my back Sarah booked an appointment with the estate agent to visit the apartment and see how much she liked it. 

She took a day off work to do this. 

On that day she met up with the estate agent who was a man in his mid 30’s at the house. 

The police told me that the estate agent appeared to have made a move on my wife Sarah. My wife rejected the approach which caused the estate agent to react angrily. 

The police believe that the estate agent choked my wife to death as they found hand marks around her neck. 

He was arrested fairly quickly after I discovered her body. 

It was all my fault. 

I didn’t go with her. 

If I was there I could’ve saved her life. 

If you can somehow hear this Sarah, I’m so sorry. 

I will always love you. 

I hope you can forgive me somehow.
