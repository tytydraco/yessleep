The first time i saw him, i was probably around 4 or 5 Years old, Memories were fuzzy at that age. He looked no different from a normal person, at least until he started talking, and my god, how much he talked. 

His voice and even his eyes seemed to carry some kind of old wisdom, like he was some kind of ageless god instead of the normal looking guy his face showed him to be.

 He used to talk to me about all manner of stuff - History, Science, Fiction and Even philosophy - Not that i understood any of that, and he did not care either, seemingly happy to hear himself talk.  The weird thing is that he would talk about most of it like it was something he personally got involved with.

After talking to me, he would sometimes give me weird trinkets, like crystals, watches, little old toys, leave my room, and the only thing i would hear after was a whirring, weird sound. My parents, obviously, never believed me, always saying about kids having vivid imaginations and dreams being way too real sometimes.

I learned to just stop bothering them about it, after three or four failed tries and a visit to the psychologist. The man never stopped coming though. He would sit by my bed and talk to me about all the impossible things he supposedly lived through. When i had the courage to ask about some of them, he would happilly answer me, glad he managed to break my shell. 

When i was 16, he came to my room for the last time. Once again talking about all his exploits and adventures, all his friends and foes, and all the lessons he learned from it all. This time, it was different though, i could feel in his voice that he was apreehensive, a bit sad, even. 

He said to me that i was a great kid, bound to do great things, but that it would never be enough, i would always feel like something was missing. And that it was okay, that it would be better for me this way.

He never specified what he was talking about when he said "great things", but my mind raced with the ideas of adventuring with him, going to places no other men could. He never invited me, though. 

He said goodbye, and like always, left through my bedroom door. But, this time, i never heard that weird sound that came with his departure. It was almost like he disappeared in thin air. Like he never was there in the first place. 

Since then, i did exactly as he said i would. I got my medical degree and saved many lives through my work. Married the most beautiful woman and had the most adorable kids. These kids turned into fine adults and had kids of their own, My favorite being the youngest, Susan. But i never, once in my life, felt like i belonged there, felt like what i did was enough. It was like he said. Now, in my advanced age, i Have the feeling that i could do so much more, even though i had a life longer than many could even dream of having. and while some people old like me want to kick the bucket as soon as possible to Rest, i don't really wanna go like that.

Even now, Decades later, i still wonder, who was that man who visited me in my bedroom and night, and why he chose me to hear him?
