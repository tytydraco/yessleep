Hi NoSleep! This is my first post ever. I just got confirmation on my worst fear. 
Ill tell you what happened about an hour ago

About a year ago, i had to move out of my parents house and on my own. There were a lot of places i could have chose, but growing up in the capital city in Connecticut, i wanted a little quiet. So i chose to settle at a small apartment complex in Ellington CT, for those who know that area. Its farmland, open fields and woods, well where i was at least.

Adjusting to it being so quiet was hard, but the rent was cheap and there was only a slight smell of cow shit. I got used to the new conditions. The rental place is far from acceptable, pvc pipes sticking out of the ground, terrible landlords, stray cats. But those have just became the least of my concerns.

The layout of my apartment is important so ill try to describe it. 
Im on the second floor, the way you get there is a staircase that leads to a balcony which leads to a long stretch of apartments, mine is the second one from the staircase. Each apartment has 2 doors leading to the outside. One is a sliding door leading to the bedroom. And the other being the main door to the living room. Both connected to the balcony. Inside there are 2 rooms. Bedroom and living room, only separated by a door. 
Im sorry im not very good at describing the layout but the sliding door and bedroom door are important.
The sliding door has a wooden plank right outside it that makes a large thud whenever someone steps on it. Enough to wake you up. The sliding door also has a lock. I never mess with it because i dont want to open up my bedroom to the outside to often. So over the course of six months, i know i never touched it and im certain it was locked.

But occasionally throughout certain nights i would hear strange noises, rustling or moving. But i chalked it up to paranoia of living alone. 

6months into living there i decided to open the door and do some summer cleaning. But.. i opened the blinds and saw. It was unlocked. Keep in mind the lock is stiff. It takes some pressure. So its not so easy to open. But it was. 

I was certain i never left it open, so again i chalked it up to paranoia. But after i locked it, things got worse. Knocking on my main door, footsteps, banging. And the thud of the plank outside. But every entrance was locked. I made sure of it, right? In the nights i would see a shadow figure in the corners of my room, there is no built in light in the room so i have to turn on a lamp to see. I do and its just the darkness playing tricks on me right? But what about the times i didn’t turn it on?

Well i got my answer. I stayed up late tonight. But it got bad. As almost every night i hear the thump from the plank, i just assumed it may be a neighbor. But then, I heard someone try the sliding door. And pure fear struck me. I grabbed the hatchet i keep next to the bed and slowly go and peek behind the blinds and. Eyes stared back at me. It was a man maybe late 20s. I was so scared i jumped and screamed and immediately called 911. But by the time they arrived. He was gone. But it was clear. He had been here before. I knew he had. The times he may have watched me, the times i head shit in my apartment. All almost completely justified. 

Im posting this an hour or so after the cops left. I move in 2 weeks far away. Different state. I just hope i don’t have to deal with him anymore.
