As I started to regain consciousness, I knew something wasn't right. I felt panic set in as I realized I was strapped to some sort of table. 

A big bright light beamed down onto my face, blinding me. I could make out silhouettes moving around me as they whispered something.

“ She's perfect, daddy, thank you.” 

I tried to scream but the gag in my mouth muffled my cries. I heard a little girl giggling as something began to brush my hair. 

Only two hours before I was responding to an Ad on Craigslist, looking for a live-in nanny. And the last thing I remembered was ringing the doorbell. 

As the whispers continued the light switched off. Leaving me with blind spots that covered the face of what appeared to be a man peering down at me. As the blind spots began to disappear and my eyes readjusted, I was greeted by a toothless, frail, old man and two dolls that sat behind him staring in my direction. The dolls were beautifully dressed in silk, Victorian style gowns. 

“I want to introduce you to my little girls. On the right is Masha and on the left is Dasha. Say hi to your new mommy girls,” said the man in a creepy, raspy, voice.

“Hi, Julie,” said the voice of a little girl that emanated from the dolls. 

“My girls need a mommy, ” said the old man as he moved over behind the dolls, rubbing their hair and staring at me with a lustful, toothless grin.

The old man moved clumsily over to the table I was strapped to and removed the gag that was in my mouth.

“Please don't scream, it will scare the girls,” said the old man.

I knew if there was a chance someone could hear me, I had to take it so I began screaming at the top of my voice.

“Make her stop, Daddy, ” sounded a voice from the direction of the dolls.

As I screamed for my life, the old man began reigning blows down upon my head. 

“My God, for a frail, old man, he was really strong, ” I thought, as the blows kept on coming.

As I faded in and out of consciousness the old man left the room, leaving me alone with the two dolls sitting across from me. 

As I frantically tried to free myself from the straps, I suddenly heard a noise. I looked at the chair, where the dolls were sitting, but they were gone. Then I heard the patter of footsteps behind me. 

“You're a bad mommy, ” giggled a voice from behind.

I froze, I was sure I heard the old man leave the room. That's when I felt the porcelain hand of one of the dolls start to stroke my face, as the cold, hard feel of a steel blade slid in under my chin.

“Masha, Dasha. Naughty girls, that's not how we treat guests now, is it,” bellowed a voice from behind me. 

I looked up and the dolls were sitting back in the chair. They were sitting there, just staring at me with their lifeless eyes.

I felt the old man approach from behind. My skin started to crawl as his cold, bony fingers gripped my neck. The stale, sickly smell of his breath washed across my face as he leaned in to whisper something to me.

“I could snap your neck like a twig,” said the old man before he skipped over behind the dolls with childlike enthusiasm.

“I think she could be the one. She seems different from the others.”

My eyes widened. “Others,” I thought.

I knew there and then that if I didn't escape I was never going to see the light of day. I was going to die in this cesspit.

The old man with the same childlike enthusiasm skipped back over to me. As he undid the straps my fight-or-flight instincts kicked in, and I rolled off the table, hitting the floor with a thud.

The old man laughed as he landed a foot on my back.

“Broken dolls don't get played with,” he screamed as he landed another kick.

“Broken dolls get put in the room with the rest of the broken dolls.”

As I struggled to catch my breath the old man walked over to the back of the room and picked up a hammer. With a ferocity of pure anger, he furiously started to pound the steel workbench.

As pain surged through my body, my eyes began darting around the room looking for an escape. That's when I spotted the two dolls still sitting there, staring at me.

I mustered as much strength as I could, picked myself up off the floor, grabbed one of the dolls, and made a run for the door. 

“No, no, no, not my Masha,” screamed the old man as I ran for the door. 

I found myself running down a long hall. Strewn about the place were a bunch of old mannequins that seemed to have their eyes covered with tape. 

As I was running down the hall, I heard the screams of the old man crying out for his beloved doll. 

“Masha, Masha, come back to me, Masha.”

I came to the door at the end of the hall. I slowly opened it, to find a staircase leading into total darkness. I could hear the old man pounding down the hallway. As I made my way up the stairs, the door behind me shut, and I heard a voice rise from the doll.

“You will never escape us. You will die like the rest of them.” 

I continued up the stairs feeling my way through the darkness. The further up the stairs I went, the thicker the darkness got. I made my way to the top of the stairs and was suddenly hit with the stench of death.

I felt around the walls of the room looking for a switch. As I felt my way around, I stumbled upon a table. I felt what I initially thought was one of the mannequins, but as that familiar sense of panic washed over me, I realized it was too soft to be a mannequin. 

As I fumbled around in the dark I tripped over something on the floor. As I tried to pick myself up, I felt a hand grab my ankle.

“Help, help me.” said the strangliated voice from whatever grabbed me. 

Panicked, I started kicking whatever had me, till it let go. Scared and confused, I huddled against the wall and began shaking.  I started crying hysterically and prayed to God that my death would be quick. 

A disembodied giggle rose from the doll and echoed around the room.

“You're in trouble now. Daddy's coming.”

  As I huddled against the wall, I heard the old man pound up the stairs, singing a tune as he made his way up to me.

“Ring-a-ring o' roses,
A pocket full of posies,
A-tishoo! A-tishoo
They all fall down .
THEY ALL FALL!” screamed the old man

 Light from the hall flooded the room, as the door burst open. The horrors of the room I found myself in was worse than any horror.

There was a half-decomposed body on the table. Dry decomposed corpses strapped to chairs, were scattered around the room. There must have been at least ten bodies. The severely mutilated body on the floor that grabbed my foot seemed to still have a bit of life in it.

Baring his teeth while hissing at me, the old man ran towards me. As he came at me the mutilated body on the floor grabbed his leg, sending him with a fierce thud to the floor. Then I heard that strangulated moan again. 

“Run, run for your life.”

I edged my way towards the door. As the old man tried to run at me again I raised the doll above my head. 

“Take one more step and I will smash this bitch into the floor. I will turn her to dust,” I said defiantly. 

“Don't you dare,” cried the old man as he collapsed to the floor.

“Please, please not my Masha. Don't hurt my baby.” 

As I watched the old monster turn into a pathetic bag of bones, my fear was replaced by utter repulsion and anger and I sent Masha crashing to the floor, smashing her porcelain face into a thousand pieces. 

Something in the old man snapped and without warning, he came charging at me. He tackled me hard, picking me off my feet and sending me flying down the stairs and on to the floor below, knocking me unconscious.

When I came to the old man had me suspended off the ground by my neck. He tightened his grip around my throat, cutting off my airways. As I felt the blood pool behind my eyes I jabbed my finger into his, blinding him.

He screamed in pain before dropping me. When I turned to run I saw an opened window and the last thing I remembered I was running for it. 

I awoke in the hospital, and according to the nurses, I had been in a coma for two weeks. I eventually recovered and after a short stay in the hospital, I was fit to go. 

After a thorough investigation, the police never found any trace of the old man, nor any evidence of bodies and no sign of any dolls.

It had been eight years since it happened. I never went back to being a Nanny. Instead, I started a family of my own. I married a lovely man named Sean and Sean gave me a beautiful girl named Aisha, who was turning five. 

Everything was looking great and I was finally starting to put the events of that day behind me. 

My husband had got back from town with my daughter after a small shopping spree for her birthday. I was sitting there drinking coffee when my daughter ran into the kitchen.

“Look, mommy, look what daddy got me. The broken one is named Masha and the pretty one is named Dasha.”

She raised Masha to her ear as if it was whispering something to her. 

“Masha said you could be their mommy too.”
