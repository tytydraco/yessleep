Have you ever got the right job for the wrong reasons?

I did back in 1998 when I became a nurse. Things where easier back then in every sense. In those days it was still fairly uncommon to see male nurses. I'd say a good 80% of the public would have described you as one of two things, weird or definitely gay. This suited me just fine because the public would still actively avoid those kinds of people too. 

My delve into the world of health started much younger though. As a kid I was fascinated with the human body. My foster Mum bought me the board game Operation several times. I used to tell her I'd worn them out or lost too many pieces and she would always get me a new one. I would happily sit quietly in my room for hours, I think that was the reason she always did. 

I don't know if she would have cared, but she never did find out the truth. That I'd stole a bunch of Stanley knives from school one day, and that I was attempting to make real incisions, with great success I might add. Some of my first souvenirs are the parts of that mans body I managed to expertly remove. This didn't cut it for long though, but I kept cutting nonetheless. I really do love that game, even to this day!

The first time I did CPR was probably the reason I wanted to become responsible for saving people. Having someone's life in your hands had a feeling of euphoria, especially if you did a good job. In my opinion I always did a very good job. I would be here telling this story if I didn't. They say you haven't done CPR properly if you don't crack a few ribs, and over all these years I haven't just cracked a few.

The first time I did it I caved a woman's chest in. I'll never forget it. What is now an educated guess, I reckon she had been dead for an hour at least, but I didn't know that then, so I rang 999. That weird smell I noticed when I first found her ended up being death. It's not a smell you forget and nor would I want to. It was that smell that kicked in my primal instincts, it turns out my fight or flight response leans heavily into fight.

I think I must've bust nearly all of her ribs in when they advised me to start compressions. For her age she really was quite fragile and frail, that took me by surprise. Her chest ended up resembling like a warped, huge spider. The heart being the body and the ribs being the legs, that's how I pictured it beneath the blood and bile and bits anyway. It was in that exact moment I decided I wanted to be a nurse. But I didn't want to save lives, I needed to take them.
