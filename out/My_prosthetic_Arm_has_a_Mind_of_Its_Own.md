  
My prosthetic arm was shinier than ever. It was brand-spanking new. At the time I wish I knew that the only thing the prosthetic would do is blood on my hands. I took a quick peek outside my cubicle. The coast was clear so I put up my feet on the desk, my feet avoiding brown coffee stained papers and empy coffee cups. I pulled back my sleeve further and admired the blue tinted sheen it gave off. I gritted my teeth, those bastards. I had been on my wits end after my car crash. I was in a car crash put since it was after work hours I didn’t have proper insurance.   
My expresssion returned to a grin once more when I remembered my prosthetic. A guy approached me after my surgery. He was honestly quite creepy. He had pale cold skin and he wore tinted goggles but he offered to give me a prosthetic. He worked at a prosthetic startup, he had said that the arm would be provided for free since it was still experimental. They gained a tester and I gained a new arm. It was honestly a steal. I clenched my left fist and rubbed my fingers together. It was so advanced it even had touch. Sure not as sensitive as my normal hand was but pretty darn close.   
I should have recognised the early signs but I was too stupid. After work, I was buying groceries. I’m not a big spender. I buy only what I need for the next 2 days before going again. I was walking past a grocery store worker stacking mustard packages.   
“Excuse me,” I said “can I get past you.”   
“Sorry, of course.” They said moving. I reached for ketchup and put it on my cart. I felt a strange itching sensation. I was watching the worker stack boxes. Their exposed neck had a trickle of sweat running down it from the exertion. My left hand twitched. I moved on before going home.   
I was greeted at the door by my dog Charlie. He jumped into my arm, shaking and whimpering in excitement. He’s the only saving grace in my life at the moment. I recently moved and I have no family close by.   
I petted him with my left arm. He whimpered moving away.   
“It’s okay,” I reassured him in quiet tones. “See,” I said touching it with my other hand.   
He moved back forward and I pet him. Suddenly my hand tightened. Charlie whimpered and shook. I couldn’t control my hand. I tried to rip it off but it wouldn’t budge.   
“Let go, let go.!” I begged. My arm relaxed and Charlie shot away from me.   
I was thinking over the incident the next day in my cubicle. I took a sip of my coffee. I hadn’t gotten much sleep. The coffee didn’t taste all that good but atleast it was free. Although considering last night I wasn’t drinking it for the taste.  
 “Julian we need your help with the printer,” said a whiny voice.    


  
I slotted the printer shut.   
“Wow you’re a real miracle worker, I can tell you’re tech skill training has been paying off!”   
“All I did was refill the paper boss,” I said tiredly. I don’t know how he even got his job. Even though it isn’t part of his job, who doesn’t know how to refill a printer? I hate my boss. Not only is he incompetent but he brags about how much he works and how he’s a romodel for us. People like him are a drag on society without offering anything in return, they’re just dead weight. I’m sure nobody would miss him if he died. Maybe I should just kill him ….   
My cup still carried in my hand shattered. Coffee and broken glass fell on the ground.   
“I’ll have this cleaned up, my apologies.” I burst out. Immediately picking up the pieces. “I’m not quite used to this arm yet.”   
“Well get used to it soon,” my boss said before turning and leaving.   
What had I been thinking? Did I really just think that that wasn’t me right?  
   
I felt a presence to my left. Before I even knew what I was doing. My arm shot at and grabbed at it.  It grabbed around the neck of a coworker. The man chocked under my grasp. With a twist of my left arm’s wrist his neck snapped in two.
