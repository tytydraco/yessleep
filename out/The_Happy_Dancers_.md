Nobody ever believes me when I tell them about the happy dancers. 

I first saw them up in the hills as a kid, I was maybe 8 or 9 when It started.

My mum had a close friend who lived up in the hills, where I'm from it doesn't take long to get from the suburbs that hug the central city to the hills that surrounded us, it wasn't a very big place, and so we would visit them every other weekend.

I always liked going up there, they had a son I'd hang out with who I'll call J, and our mum's would usually get pizza for us while they talked and laughed in the dining room.

One night while driving back home, the streetlights that often illuminated the twisting and winding roads weren't working, leaving only the red lights on the railing that protected us from many descending Kilometers of darkness.

I'd always been afraid of the idea of us accidentally driving through the railing after taking a tight corner too fast, tumbling and crashing down into the earth.

Naturally my Mum was taking each corner with much more caution and deliberation than usual - especially the tight, blind spot corners which there were many of.

While she slowly peeked around a corner before the final stretch home, the headlights had exposed what looked to be a young woman in a white dress standing on the side of the road. 
There was no sidewalk or much room for her in general so this was really unusual and obviously dangerous.

I remember pointing it out to my Mum and she said she didn't see anybody, I was in disbelief as we passed her without so much as a sound, she was so close to the car I was scared we would hit her over the railing.

I looked behind me through the back window, and the woman was performing some kind of dance. 

It was beautiful, and elegant, with ethereal grace and precision.

It was similar to ballet, but her feet weren't on her tippy toes or anything, in fact they barely seemed to touch the ground at all, they glided across the road as if there wasn't even a speck of friction. 

I pointed it out to my Mum, who once again, said there was nothing there, but I wouldn't let up about it the whole drive home, I knew what I saw, and I wanted Mum to have see her dancing too, because it really was beautiful. 

I couldn't stop thinking about it, it was like the movements of her body, despite the darkness of the night, had completely hypnotized me. 

I remember for the next two weeks before going back there, every night I desperately replayed it over and over in my head, trying to conjur up new details to swoon over, I remember being in class and unable to concentrate, it was all I could think about. 

The next time we were driving up there I was watching the roads like a hawk, my attention was drawn to them like iron to a magnet, and even though I'd seen her on the way home, there was an intense instinct to make sure I didn't miss anything, but alas, it was a regular drive through the setting sun as it normally was.  

The night was uneventful, truthfully I barely remembered what I even did because my mind was so locked in on the trip home, so locked in on the roads that brought us to and from, and it felt only moments had passed after arriving that the darkness of night was long past joining us, and my Mum telling me we were leaving. 

I could barely contain my excitement but I didn't tell mum about it, I'd been sitting on it for two weeks which as an 8 year old was an eternity, and now I wanted it all for myself, as if it was a secret for me and me alone, one small thing that my mum couldn't control.

The street lights were still out of order, something that seemed to really agitate my mum as she rambled about the dangers of the layout of the roads, the irresponsibility of the local council, and other equally valid concerns that completely flew over my head as I pierced through the window with uncompromising intensity.

And that's when I saw them, a few tight turns sooner than before, illuminated by my Mum's headlights, but this time it wasn't just the young woman, but a group of them, all standing in a line behind the railing and holding hands, 

They all wore outfits that were white, and all either a dress or long robes, but this time I could see their faces, and they all smiled these huge, bright smiles that almost acted as their own sources of light.

Their teeth were impossibly white, their skin impossibly smooth.

They moved and danced in unison as we passed them, spilling over the railing and into the road behind us.

My mum kept asking what I was looking at but I didn't care to explain it even if I could. It was indescribable. They flowed like gravity didn't matter. They weaved in and out of eachother, conjoining and then letting go, in these patterns that I wish I could explain... It brought a tear to my eye. 

Right as we were turning the last corner, I swear I could see them climbing on top of eachother to form a strange shape, kind of like a triangle I think , but it was dark and more silhouette than anything else...  And like a well trained hivemind, they scattered over the railing and into the pitch black.

I didn't see them after that for years, but I always thought about them. I was just as enamored as a 12 year old as i was when I was 8. 

Every night, I replayed it and replayed it, painting shapes in my mind using their dancing movements as the brush, obsessing over the feeling of enticement I'd felt those two nights.

By the time I was 11, I really began to wonder if I even saw anything at all.

That was before they began to appear everywhere in my teenage years, from my first year of highschool, like a multiplying infection that only I was able to see. 

In hindsight, I wish I'd never seen the happy dancers, never noticed them that one night.. 
because when they returned all those years later, they weren't how I remembered them at all.
