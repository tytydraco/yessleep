The wind was full of humidity as I tore down the Indiana gravel road in my 2003 Chevy Impala. In my rear view mirror, thunderclouds gathered like artillery ready for battle, and the first flashes of lightning hit the ground at regular intervals. The cornfields rippled like waves. The sky’s greenish hue made the world feel alien, and the dust cloud behind me made it seem like the ground itself was trying to escape the storm.

I turned onto a small dirt driveway and parked in front of a white two story farmhouse. Shielding my eyes, I grabbed my duffle bag from the front seat and bounded up the three stairs, closing the whipping screen door behind me.

My grandpa was seated in his chair in the living room watching Hogan’s Heroes. His dinner plate sat next to him, remnants of tater tot casserole speckling it.

He adjusted his ninety-two-year-old frame to turn and see me, then stood at a snail’s pace to offer a greeting. “Alice, how are you, my girl?”

“I’m doing good, grandpa, how are you?”

“Oh, just dandy. You got so tall,” he said, hunched shoulders raising to their limits to give me a hug. Thick arthritic fingers patted my back, hands now more like claws than hands. My grandpa had been a farmer all his life. When none of his kids wanted to take the farm over, he just kept working, selling off land piece by piece to pay for his meager living. Even now, he still kept a garden with cabbage, peppers, onions, rhubarb, and a few tomato plants. Three chickens gave him an egg for every morning’s breakfast, and a neighbor brought him milk every week. He was a simple man.

“How’s school going for ya?” His voice was gruff, yet joyful.

“I’m all graduated now.”

“Really!”

“Yep, got a job and everything.”

“That’s wonderful. Where at?”

“It’s in Washington State. That’s where I’m headed now if you can believe it.”

“Really? That’s a long drive.”

“Well that’s why I’m staying with you. Break it up a little bit. I’m visiting national parks and staying with friends too.”

“Oh wow. That sounds super. Well, if you need anything to eat, I’ve got tater tot casserole on the stove.”

I helped myself to a plate and sat on a lightly dusted sofa across from my grandpa. I told him all about school, and he told me about life in town. The bakery he went to every morning for the same burnt coffee had changed ownership, and now the rolls he brought home for Saturday lunch were sourdough, which he liked. His coffee group was now significantly smaller, as at least three of them had died and two had moved into assisted living. It was a whirlwind of names I didn’t know, yet somehow my grandpa recounting their life stories made it feel like they were old friends of mine too.

Conversation grew sparse after an hour, and grandpa was getting tired. The wind outside the house eventually triumphed over the TV as the primary background noise. The storm clouds churned as the front got closer to the house. As the wind gusted, it swayed and bounced the old power lines running to the house and barn. It made a strange, twanging sound, reverberating in the turbulent air.

My grandpa perked up at the sound. The lines in his face shifted as he turned to the window enough to see the trees whipping around them.

“He’s on the lines.” His usual content tone melted away.

“What was that grandpa?”

He turned to me with a tired face that looked older than ever. With a thoughtful ponderance I had never associated with him when I was a child, he told me the strangest story I’ve ever heard.

“When I got back from the war, I bought this house, and your grandmother and I had our own little slice of paradise, it felt like, before kids came along. Not that that wasn’t paradise, too. Just a little noisier.

Well with my pension I had a mind to buy me a tractor and so I did. It was a beauty of a thing, Minneapolis Moline, white with yellow stripes, 37 horsepower. Got it second hand, but it served me real well. Our neighbor Frank had an older one that went caput, and he just used it for parts. Said I could use anything from it if I needed.

I was out in the field planting in May when a hose on the back broke. I knew Frank had the part and I was fairly close to his farm, so I decided to walk on up the gravel road to get there. Did you come from town or from the highway?”

“Town,” I said.

“Ok, if you came from the highway you’d have passed it. I was making my way back to the tractor with the hose when I walked up over a slight hill and saw a man walking toward me on the gravel road.

He sure was peculiar looking. Even though the summer heat had just started, he was wearing a black suit and a bow-tie. His shoes were covered in dust, but I could tell they had been shined recently. At first, I thought he mighta been some traveling preacher or something, but he didn’t carry no Bible nor a suitcase. Instead, he was dragging this steel T-post of sorts. It was like two sections of four inch pipe, one welded to the middle of the other one. I thought it mighta been a tractor component of some sort, though I’ve never seen anything like it.

When I finally got close enough to say good afternoon, I could see he had this greasy jet-black hair, done up with pomade so not one strand was out of place. When I called out to him, he gave me a smile with teeth as white as a sheet, and his eyes were something deep brown. In the afternoon sun, his face didn’t have no sweat on it. Real strange. He called back to me in a sort of sing-songy way.

‘Good afternoon, mister.’ He sounded like he had a voice for a pulpit, full, but not too deep and booming.

‘What are you up to, sir?’ I said back. We were now a few paces away. The sound of gravel grating against that pipe had stopped by that point, which I was glad for.

He said, ‘I’m just a-walkin the road, mister. Looking for something or someone.’

‘Whatcha looking for?’ I said. ‘You lost?’

‘No, no, not lost,’ he said ‘Just wandering. Wondering while I wander.’

So I asked ‘You a preacher?’ He kept smiling at me, so I figured maybe he had some holy disposition. But he shook his head and said ‘No, not by profession, but perhaps related to it.’

Now he was looking over at the power lines. They were running along hundred foot between posts, set horizontal across the top bar, and there was the landline too. So I asked him ‘You a lineman?’

‘No,’ he said, still grinning.

I kinda half laughed at the thought of a strangely dressed fellow wandering around not knowing what he was looking for. ‘Then whatcha doing out here?’ I asked him.

He turned to me and raised an eyebrow. ‘I’m looking for a name.’

Something in his tone made me tense up a little bit, so I just asked him ‘Like looking for somebody? Wanting to know who lives around here?’

But he just went on like he didn’t know what I was saying. ‘Oh, perhaps,’ he said. ‘I’m just in need of a name.’

And with that, he hoisted up that T-post and planted it in the loose gravel at his feet. Somehow it stayed upright. The top bar sat a little above our heads, and in a quick step he jumped up so he was hanging on it, back to the post, arms wrapped around each side of the top bar. He crossed his legs and hung there, grinning at me. That trick was strange. Something about him looking down at me didn’t feel right.

So I asked him ‘Where’d you learn a trick like that?’ He hopped down, but that T-post stayed put.

‘When you have time to wait, you have time to balance.’ He gave a little half bow and looked at me like I was supposed to clap or something. Then he asked me, ‘You been in the army, mister?’

I said I had, and he asked me where. I told him about the Pacific and his eyes sorta lit up at every detail I was giving him. After a bit, I got feeling so strange I just stopped in the middle of a sentence. He kept looking at me, then he asked ‘Did you find your service worthwhile?’

Seemed like kind of a strange question, but I said ‘Well I say it’s what I had to do.’

He started parroting me, going ‘Mmm, yes, what I had to do.’

So I asked ‘You ever been in the service?’

He perked up again. Wouldn’t give me a straight answer. ‘In a sort of way, yes. The service has treated me mighty fine.’ He knocked on the T-post, caught it as it started to tip over, and then set it back up. Then he kept talking, ‘I’m looking for a name. You got one for me?’

His smile was making me uncomfortable. I watched him pull himself up to the top of the T-post and sit there on the middle of it. I was waiting for him to tip over, but then he hoisted himself up to his feet, and by Jove, he was walking along the top beam like some kinda tight rope. So I said, ‘You from the circus?’

He looked at me, standing on that beam, smiling like a loon, and said, ‘You might call it a bit of a circus. Maybe as chaotic as one.’ He jumped down and landed like a cat.

It was then that I realized how late in the day it was getting, and that the sun had been swallowed up by some clouds on the western horizon. They were big ol’ storm clouds, and it sure looked like rain. So I said that it looks like rain and that I might be needing to go. His eyebrows shot up at that, and I got scared he might follow me. Didn’t know how I’d get away, considering the tractor was busted and it was almost a straight shot back to the house. I didn’t want to try and outrun him neither. So I just figured I’d keep talking until he decided to leave. ‘You afraid of getting caught in the storm?’ I said.

‘No, I love a good storm,’ he said looking at the clouds. Then he turned to me and said ‘You got a wife?’ That grin was as big as ever. Thankfully I had turned to look at the clouds and my face couldn’t betray me to him. It was like his gaze was boring into the side of my head. I could feel it pressing up against me, sure as he was standing there. I managed to croak out a no. Then he asked me one more time. He made me look at him in the eyes like I was under compulsion or something. He looked in my eyes and he said, ‘I’m looking for a name. You got one for me?’

That grin was still there, and I was waiting for it to twist, for him to leap on me and drop that post on my head. But it stayed steady and I felt like I forgot how to speak. I couldn’t tell if he was asking for my name or for me to give him one, or to tell him someone else’s name, but I didn’t like the thought of what might happen if I told him one. I felt like he knew my name just by looking at me. So I swallowed a lump in my throat, shook my head, and croaked out another no.

He held my gaze for a bit longer, and then he started laughing. Just chuckling at first, kind of a hearty sound, but then it escalated, and he was all over his register, high and low, cackling like a loon.

He picked up his T-post and slung it on his shoulder. I was scared he might swing it at me, so I took a few steps back. He didn’t move toward me, to my relief.

He turned towards the powerlines and jumped, like he had springs in his shoes, some thirty foot in the air, and that T-post became light as air. The wind started to pick up, and he almost floated down between the powerlines, some twenty foot in the air, and he caught one powerline on one side of the T-post and two lines on the other side. And it sparked something awful, and he just laughed louder. All the time, laughing. And those wires, they didn’t bend like normal wires. They stretched like rubberbands as his weight settled on them. Then, following the lines, they launched him up and over the nearest telephone pole onto the next stretch of wires, almost floating like gravity didn’t remember him, all the while cackling and hooting like it was the most fun he’d ever had.

I watched him swing off into the distance, dark suit against that darkening sky. After a minute, I lost sight of him, but that telephone line was still twanging like a guitar string. The wind picked up and the sky was turning green, and I felt this overwhelming sense of fear since I couldn’t see him anymore. Only other time I felt like that was not being able to see the enemy in the war. So I turned and started running. Left the tractor in the field. That storm chased me all the way home. And that twanging of the wires…It almost sounded like laughter.

I got home, my feet were bleeding in my boots, and Dorene thought I was sick or something from how pale I was. She asked why I’d left the tractor and I just said it broke down. I didn’t say anything about the man. Seemed like he might know if I told her. Weighed heavy on my mind. The one thing I never told her before she died.”

He stopped and sat for a while, just staring out the window at that turbulent sky.

“You know, your sister inherited your grandma’s looks, but I think you inherited your grandma’s spirit. Thank you for coming to visit me.”

“Of course, grandpa,” I said, a little confused.

“Want a piece of peach pie? I got a little ice cream in the freezer.” He seemed to shake himself out of the funk pretty quick. We had some pie, and I retired to the spare room upstairs.

The storm made it hard to sleep. I tossed and turned as rain battered the window and thunder boomed and shook the house. It sounded like a war outside.

The next morning, I had a drowsy cup of burnt coffee and an egg and bacon with my grandpa before I gave him a hug, climbed into my car, and shuttled off down the gravel road. Grandpa seemed back to his usual self as he waved goodbye from the front porch. But maybe the lines in his face hid the fatigue in his eyes.

As my car zoomed over sluggish gravel roads now wet from the rain, I thought about the story. I looked to the side of the road, half expecting to see evidence of a strange man dragging a metal T-post. Maybe some of the indents in the new mud were footprints.

I finished my road trip with all the normal and happy memories I had hoped for. This one, though, stuck out in the bunch of them. And I haven’t been able to forget it easily.

Yesterday, I got a phone call that my grandpa passed. He was sitting in his chair in the living room. We had a big storm come through in Washington last night, and it made me feel like I should share this with somebody.
