The town I grew up in was strange. That statement *typically* garners a fair bit of narrative intrigue when I say it in person, but peculiar childhoods seem to be alarmingly common among the contributors that skulk about this particular forum, so allow me to be more specific.

My hometown was *professionally* strange.

Five and a half square miles of humble farmland that doubled as a hotbed for the unexplainable and the uncanny. Strangeness was our lifeblood, the beating heart of our economy, attracting tourists from three states over with rumors of the closely kept secrets lurking within our one-of-a-kind showroom. An orphanage for the enigmatically aberrant that was simply titled:

*“Curbside Emporium”*

That strangeness *used* to be the love of my life. Now, I’m starting to suspect it’ll be my tomb.

But hey - it isn't all bad news.

At least I’ll finally be a part of it.

That is what I wanted, right?

\- - - - -

The way my parents tell the story, *Curbside Emporium* was my first true passion. Something that really put life behind my eyes. To borrow a lovingly dumb expression from my dad, the mystique of the various oddities seemingly *“bonked my consciousness into second gear”*. Makes it sound like I was an exceptionally dull toddler before that day, glazed over and fashionably disinterested, until I glimpsed *Miss Sapphire*, the world’s only sparkling blue tape worm, and then, *violà,* I was awakened.

Not to veer too far offtrack, but have you ever heard of the *Mütter Museum*? It’s a lovely little gallery nestled in a quaint section of Philadelphia’s downtown, collecting and curating a wonderful assortment of oddities. The lady whose body turned to soap. The world’s largest colon. A plaster cast of two conjoined twins. *Curbside Emporium,* and by extension, my hometown, are certainly comparable. The amount of strange things stuffed within a single location, the raw density of it all, inspired a deep thrum of nostalgia within me when I visited the *Mütter Museum* for my cousin’s wedding a few months back. Yes, you can in fact get married there. Why in God’s name would you want to? Well, if it reminded me of home, it must have reminded my cousin and his high school sweetheart of home, too, and that’s probably as good a reason as any to select a venue. Plus, *Curbside Emporium* doesn’t have a reception hall.

There’s one key difference between the two, however.

The *Mütter Museum* imports its strangeness from all over the globe. My hometown? We’ve never had a need to outsource like that. Strangeness springs up around us like weeds, whether we like it or not. Let’s put it this way: whatever cosmic radiation stirs within the waters of the Bermuda Triangle, that same radiation seems to stir within the soil of our small, Podunk stretch of land.

Assuming you believe the anomalous exhibitions aren’t a series of well-intentioned hoaxes, of course.

As a kid, that thought never even crossed my mind. It felt like a lie too cruel to even exist. Family and friends quickly learned that disbelief was akin to blasphemy in my eyes. My parents sidestepped many a screaming match between my older sister and me by prophylactically outlawing *Curbside Emporium* talk at the dinner table. Begrudgingly, I complied. As long as she didn’t disparage those consecrated halls, then I wouldn’t argue she had shit for brains. Tit-for-tat.

To be clear, though, she was right to be skeptical.

First off, the unassuming layout and hokey decor didn’t exactly scream *scientific integrity.* It was the second tallest building in town, squeezed tightly between the fire station and our local burger joint, marked by a piece of ostentatious, neon signage that rose unnecessarily high into the air. I loved pretty much everything about *Curbside Emporium,* excluding that damn sign. It made no earthly sense. The nearest interstate was ten miles away, and the tallest building in town was the adjacent fire station: who was the elevation for? Birds? Angels? Distracted, low-flying biplane pilots? Not only that, but the fluorescent green bulbs cost a small fortune and were prone to malfunction. For them all to work at once was nothing short of a miracle. The first “R” burnt out for what seemed like my entire freshman year of high school, making the sign read *“Cubside Emporium”,* which, to be perfectly frank, just sounds like a very odd, very specific porn outlet.

Now, I get it was meant to be symbolic; not practical. A signal to visitors that *Curbside Emporium* was clearly the crown jewel of our otherwise no-name town. Still, the building itself was in a state of perpetual disrepair. Why not siphon money from the sign towards fixing the crumbling foundation or eradicating the carpenterworm larvae that chewed up the floorboards every winter? But I digress. Disrepair didn’t dampen the magic. Not for me, anyway. Walking through those oversized double doors, those towering slabs of dark oak that divided the dullness of the real world from the brilliant shimmer of dreamlike possibility, never failed to lift my spirits.

The lobby set the tone for the showroom to come, with a palpable air of mystery and an abundance of kitschy charm. Shadows flickered in the dim lighting provided by scattered, gold-plated oil lamps and a centrally hung electric candelabra, with telescoping rows of gold teeth that glowed above the swathes of eager patrons. The color scheme leaned heavily on deep reds and dull golds, which made the room look simultaneously regal and cheap. A burgundy-colored carpet that could easily hide a spilled glass of Merlot or a bloodstain within its fibers. Gold tassels on the curtain seperating the lobby from the showroom that matched the gold threads embroidered into the curtain itself.

Unlabeled knickknacks devoured every inch of wall-space. At first glance, the ornamentation could appear chaotic. The more you looked, however, the more it seemed to fit together like pieces to a puzzle, implying some perverse method to the madness. Feathers dangled off the rim of a dreamcatcher to fill the U-shaped emptiness framed by the antlers of a taxidermy deer's head below. The borders of scenic painting fit snugly between the legs of an antique artisan’s bench, which the owners had bolted upright, extending laterally from the wall behind where Mr. Baker operated the ticket counter.

Mr. Baker, to my knowledge, is the only confirmed employee of *Curbside Emporium*. A gaunt, joyless corpse of a man, always sporting a black tuxedo, an off-white button-down, and a golden cummerbund. Tickets cost at *least* ten dollars, although you’re technically permitted, and subtly encouraged, to give over ten, as long as that amount is an even number. Mr. Baker won’t accept odd-numbered donations. Most people pay ten on the dot, but I’ve seen bills as large as a hundred deposited into the enormous gold cash register by Mr. Baker’s skeletal, liver-spotted hands. Why would you pay over ten? Well, the simple answer is that it’s good karma to support local business. There are more convoluted answers, of course: baseless conspiracies spurred on by the message written in gold lettering above the curtain that leads to the showroom:

*“The more of yourself that you give, the more of yourself that you’ll see.”*

Once you push through the thick crimson fabric and enter the cavernous showroom, the Gilded Age aesthetic disappears completely. Instead, the presentation is very plain and down to brass tax, with wood panel flooring, eggshell colored walls, and natural light provided through a trio of large windows along the wall farthest from the curtain. To me, this sharp contrast has always felt logical. The lobby establishes mystique via its flamboyant interior design. The showroom, in comparison, needs no crutch.

The exhibitions speak for themselves.

I’ve already mentioned my favorite: *Miss Sapphire.* Don’t get me wrong, I’m no tapeworm enthusiast. The creature’s bluish, crystalline exterior did little to mitigate the bubbling nausea I experienced when I imagined all thirty-two inches of it squishing around some poor cow’s intestines. No, I was enraptured by the idea of it being *“one-of-a-kind”*. That idiosyncratic quality really struck a chord with me. It made the creature seem powerful, and oddly important. There’s only *one* extra-long, blue-tinged tapeworm, and hey, you’re looking right at it. Bow your head and pay your respects to the first and last of its kind. Not to mention the way they displayed *Miss Sapphire* helped romanticize the creature, its segmented body held gracefully in the air by lines of nearly invisible string, with a watercolor illustration of a starry night attached to the inside of its glass box acting as a scenic backdrop, which I think was meant to evoke the image of a traditional Chinese dragon flying over the countryside, rather than a parasite swimming through filth.

And that’s just a sample.

There’s the blackened bones of a man and a boy, which, presumably, fell from the sky and landed in our town back in the eighties, although no one actually witnessed a descent. No missing person reports could explain them. No commercial and or private planes were traveling overhead early that morning.

A young woman, Erica, discovered the skeletons as she was walking her dog. As dawn broke, she saw them lying side by side on *Curbside Emporium’s* front lawn, holding hands, vacant sockets peering up at the unseen. Onlookers assumed they were father and son, based on the size difference, their clasped hands, and their narrow hips.

Once the Sheriff had been sufficiently convinced that they represented something anomalous, rather than something acutely murderous, the strange bodies were added to the collection, and since Erica was the first to lay eyes on them, Mr. Baker granted her the distinct honor of naming them. She went with the first thing that came to mind, cheerfully admitting her lack of creativity. Thus, she christened the bones *Atticus* and *Finch*, having just finished *To Kill a Mockingbird* for high school English. Of course, *Atticus* and *Jem* would have *technically* been more appropriate, given that the remains were canonically related, a father and his son, but she claimed those names didn’t *“feel right*”. No one pushed back against the decision. She found them, so the responsibility of naming them was hers and hers alone.

That’s the rule. You get a plaque engraved with *your* name posted below the exhibition, too.

There’s a framed black-and-white photograph showing a farmer listed simply as “*Jim”* leaning on a down-turned pitch fork planted in the ground like a flag, beside a small, circular patch of earth blurred with motion, as if spinning. He named the phenomenon *“Flush-Dirt”* on account of the soil’s toilet-like churning. Supposedly, his boot sank into it like quicksand when he stumbled upon the anamoly. Only lasted for a day or two before the ground’s physical properties spontaneously reverted to normal.

There’s Phillip and his wooden flute that, for a brief time, when played, supposedly emitted noises that sounded like human speech in an unknown language, rather than its normal whistling. More than a little disturbed, Philip happily gifted the instrument to *Curbside Emporium*, but refused to play along with the tradition, offering no name for the anomaly. According to the mythos, when Mr. Baker prompted him a fourth time, unwilling to take the thing off his hands without a name, Phillip replied, *“Listen, I don’t want to!”.* From then on, the flute became known as *“Listen, I don’t want to”,* which had an oddly appropriate ring to it, given the backstory.

Every bit of it was magic. Every story, every relic, every inch of that place spoke to me. So, when I was finally old enough to wander about town without supervision, my mission became clear.

I was going to find something anomalous.

I was going to have a plaque with my name carved on it.

I was going to earn my place in the showroom.

In the end, I succeeded in achieving those goals, but only partially. I discovered something wildly inexplicable. A story worthy of *Curbside Emporium*. I don’t believe I’ll be getting my plaque, though.

Not in the way I imagined it, at least.

\- - - - -

When I first conceived of my so-called *expeditions*, they were not such a lonely affair. Sometimes I had more than a dozen kids following my lead - digging holes, overturning rocks, looking towards the sky for the first glimpses of more heaven-rejected bones - hoping to catch wind of an oddity. For them, though, it was a fad. Something to be discarded once a new, shinier hobby came along. Years passed, and the team shrank. The number of kids I considered friends dwindled into the single-digits. By the time I turned ten, it was just me and Riley, and he only came because I was so damn insistent. Eventually, even Riley had become fed up with the pursuit, but, unlike the others, we remained friends, despite our diverging interests.

Honestly, my parents were more worried about my social situation than I was. They didn’t want to witness their son tread the path of the outcast, consumed by what they considered a fruitless passion. Sure, I missed the banter. Missed the sense of belonging, too. The rejection was more than a little painful. There was an upside to the solitude, though. Something I didn’t mention to my parents.

If I were the only person on an expedition, that meant I didn’t have to share the credit when I inevitably found something. More plaque-space for my name, more glory for me.

I could tell my fanaticism scared them; it was in the way their faces contorted when I gushed about *Curbside Emporium*, all shifting eyes and half-smiles, like they didn’t want to support the hobby, but they didn’t want to strike me down, either. Unspoken prayers that the fire would go out just as long as they didn’t give it any more oxygen. I certainly didn’t soothe their concern when I returned from one of my first solo expeditions with a discovery in my backpack, beaming with pride.

*“I can’t believe it - honestly I can’t believe it - but I think I found something! The first of its kind! Do you have Mr. Baker’s number? I need to donate it right away before it gets rotten. I’m going to name him ‘Volcano Bug’, I think.”* The blunt but forceful odor of decay exploded from my backpack as I unzipped it and unveiled my discovery. Reluctantly, I allowed my father to examine the dead critter, holding it upside down by the tip of its tail and spinning it.

*“Enough, Dad, we gotta call him, we gotta call him quick…”* I pleaded. If it wasn’t obvious from the specimen alone, the shrill anxiety creeping into my voice likely gave me away.

Needless to say, we didn’t phone Mr. Baker regarding the salamander corpse imperfectly coated in *Sharpie* ink. Later that evening, when my tears had dried, I admitted to drawing over the creature’s scales posthumously, desperate to “*find”* an anomaly at any cost. The only thing that saved me from a much more significant punishment was that they believed me, or mostly believed me, when I claimed I hadn’t killed the lizard specifically to fuel the lie. Which was true, by the way. I’d stumbled upon the body, face-down, stuck in the small crevice between the sidewalk and the nearby dirt. From there, the scheme crystalized quickly. I feverishly went to work, watching myself scrape the marker over its brittle flesh like my mind was outside my body, lost within some terrible fugue state, a soul possessed. So, when I finally found my anomaly, as opposed to fabricating one, I knew I had to be absolutely, irrevocably sure of its strangeness before I told anyone else, especially my parents.

That discovery would come four years later.

I was trekking along the eastern edge of town, engulfed in the song *Zero by The Smashing Pumpkins* blaring from my new wraparound headphones, a gift I’d received for my fourteenth birthday the week prior. Technically speaking, I shouldn’t have been searching there. The strangeness of my hometown did not immunize it from life’s harsher realities. We, like many of Pennslyvania’s small communities, struggled with heroin abuse, and the poor souls who succumbed to the drug’s siren call insulated themselves on our town’s eastern perimeter, injecting within the safety of its rundown infrastructure. My parents forbade me from wandering around that area, especially since I was alone most of the time. Naturally, I still searched the eastern side of town periodically, ignoring the agreed-upon restriction without a second thought. How could I resist? To know that there was a part of town unexplored, potentially harboring an anomaly - that would’ve driven me up a fucking wall. I couldn’t limit my search. That said, I didn’t want them to worry, so I pretended to honor their request.

When I found it, it wasn’t what I expected. It couldn’t be seen. Couldn’t be heard.

No, my beautiful anomaly was something you *felt*.

The air was cool, but it seethed with the hidden electricity of an impending storm, though the sky was bright and cloudless. The soles of my feet ached from traversing the crumbling sidewalk, with its uneven cracks and jagged slopes. The nearest house was a quarter mile down the road, an empty ranchero with mostly boarded-up windows that served as a map marker. Once I reached that dusty ghost of a home, even I knew it was time to turn around.

I was gazing up at the sky, that perfectly empty blue abyss, when I felt it.

All of a sudden, my heartbeat turned rabid. Wild, boundless fear gnawed at the base of my skull. Sweat dripped down my torso by the bucketful, pouring from me at a rate that seemed liable to send me to the hospital, critically dehydrated, starved kidneys screaming for water.

It was all so…automatic.

I leapt backwards, sneaker catching on a crack in the terrain, nearly causing me to tumble to the broken ground ass-first. My mind attempted to catch up with my body, scanning the horizon, eyes hunting for whatever threat had sent my nervous system into manic overdrive. A flock of blackbirds cawed somewhere above me. Wind blustered over my skin, turning my sweat icy. Electricity writhed within the atmosphere, making the hairs on my arm stand at attention, but there were still no visible signs of an imminent storm.

No visible signs of *anything*, actually. The entire scene was motionless, bland, and docile. It didn’t make sense. It didn’t match what I felt. Where was the danger? What in God’s name had I just become attuned to?

That’s when it hit me. Pangs of excitement thumped within my chest.

*Whatever this is, it could be my anomaly,* I thought.

So, against my instincts, I crept forward. Tiptoed over the weeds springing from the shattered sidewalk slowly, carefully. My fear rose accordingly. Every step inspired another ounce of terror, but, for the life of me, I couldn’t determine why.

One more step, and my hands trembled.

Two more steps, and my vision softened, blurring, dimming.

Three more, and I’d reached my limit. I physically couldn’t force myself further. Once again, I scanned my surroundings.

*It must be right here. If I can’t push myself forward, this is it - it’s gotta be right in front of me.*

I peered down. At first, all I saw was a normal, thoroughly unremarkable square of sidewalk, but that’s just it. The concrete was normal. Uncracked. Clean. No invading shrubbery, no cigarette butts, no brown crystal shards that once formed a beer bottle. It was *perfectly* normal - so much so that it was distinctly out of place.

I squatted down, sat on my haunches, and inspected it closer. Watched the damn thing like I was waiting for it to flinch, and thus would be required, by the laws of the cosmos, to divulge its arcane secrets. After ten minutes, my calves started to burn, so I sat down and crossed my legs, still observing the potential anomaly with a retrospectively embarrassing level of intensity, never once letting my eyes wander.

Hours passed. The perfect sidewalk refused to flinch, and I still couldn’t step on it without experiencing immediate, mind-melting panic. Trust me, I tried. As the sun dipped down, threatening night, I considered leaving, but the story of Jim and his *“Flush-dirt”* flashed through my mind, and I recalled his phenomenon had spontaneously disappeared after a day or so. That fact kept me tightly glued to the ground. I wouldn’t allow it to slip through my fingers. The thought of missing my opportunity made me feel decidedly ill.

I just needed to figure out what I was looking at, or, at the very least, determine how to document it.

As if the universe heard my prayers, a line of black ants emerged from the dirt and began silently traversing the blemish-free concrete, seemingly unbothered by whatever was holding me back. I watched them with bated breath. They started their march at the left-hand corner, closest to me,  continuing diagonally across the sidewalk. Suddenly, the one leading the charge pivoted course, although there was nothing blocking their path. The turn was awkward. Unnatural. The insect reared on its hind two legs and spun its body ninety degrees to the right. When the ants trailing behind the first reached that same spot, they pivoted too, identically.

I sprung to my feet, biting my nails, star-struck by what was transpiring.

The strange pivots continued, all sharp and unprompted, each mirrored by the insect that followed. After a few minutes, a black shape began to materialize, this half-circle with two stout, pegged protrusions, outlined by the procession of living dots. More soldiers crawled from the grass, and more of the image emerged. Eventually, the last of the line dragged itself from the earth and onto the concrete. To my absolute astonishment, they seemed to have the perfect number of volunteers. When the last ant pivoted, the first was there to connect them all together. The shape was complete. The march stayed strong and the pivots continued, so the shape never lost its form.

An oval with three closely clustered pegs on top and two more distantly spaced pegs on the bottom.

A five toed cog twisting within the belly of some divine machine.

The *whoosh* of a passing trunk sundered my hypnosis, and I came crashing back to reality.

Just seeing it wouldn’t be enough.

I needed proof.

I bolted towards home. I figured I could spare the few seconds required to keep my parents off my back when I didn’t come home that night.

I swung open the screen-door and screamed:

*“Staying at Riley’s tonight!”*

Didn’t stay for their response. Both cars were parked in the driveway. One of them must have heard me. Plus, they’d been pestering me to spend more time with friends, anyway. Doubt they would have told me no.

As the orange glow of twilight began to dim, I sprinted to Riley’s.

He was the only person I knew who owned a camera, and the only person who still had a faint, lingering interest in *Curbside Emporium*. I was confident I could convince him to lie to his parents, tell them he was sleeping at my house.

With a seemingly heavy heart, he trudged from his stoop to grab his digital camera. agreeing to accompany me across town in the dead of night.

Because of me, he’d never return home.

Because of my obsession, he’d never sleep in his own bed again.

I used to feel ashamed about my involvement in his disappearance.

Though, as of late,

I don't know that I have regrets.

Don't know that I have any regrets at all.

\- - - - -

*“A shape…made of ants?”* Riley asked, voice dripping with sarcasm.

Grass crunched beneath our boots. The moonless night provided meager illumination. Still, I could tell Riley was smirking like an idiot.

*“Listen, it’ll make more sense when you see it…”* I replied, but he cut me off.

*“Was the shape a middle finger? That would scare me, too.”*

I sighed, but through a sheepish grin.

*“Wow, yeah, how’d you know? Dipshit.”* I chuckled and gave him a gentle push.

*“Ow! Dude, watch it, collarbone,”* he remarked theatrically.

*“God, man, that was two years ago; when am I finally going to be let off the hook?”*

*“Never. The fracture may be healed, but my mental scars….Lord have mercy, they ache…”* he said, adopting a southern twang for the last few words.

Riley was tall, athletically gifted, and, as far as I could tell, fairly handsome. He had all the ingredients to develop social standing. Because of that, I wasn’t too surprised when he started phasing himself out of my expeditions. A tiny bit hurt, yes, but not shocked. Riley was a good friend. He wanted to keep me around, in spite of my desperately uncool interests, so he browbeat me into attempting some more mainstream hobbies. To that end, his family took me snowboarding in the Poconos one winter. I was a goddamn mess on the slopes. Crashed into Riley and sent him chest first into the trunk of a tree, turning his collarbone to rubble. Shattered the bone into eight distinct pieces. From then on, we agreed to keep our hobbies separate while remaining friends, common ground be damned.

*“Maybe if you weren’t so menopausal, the bone wouldn’t have completely disintegrated. Things brittle as fuck. I mean, eight screws? Really? You needed eight screws to hold that toothpick together?”*

He pushed me back, laughing. For a moment, I forgot about everything: *Curbside Emporium*, the relentless pursuit of strangeness to call my own, the ants and the shape and the sidewalk. For once, I wasn’t trapped in the endless labyrinth of obsession. I just felt warm. Unabashedly, transcendently warm.

Which made what Riley said next hurt that much more.

*“Yeah, well, at least I don’t spend all my free time walking around town by myself, searching for make-believe like a loser.”*

Based on his inflection, I don’t think he intended the statement to be so pointed. A slip of the tongue. Regardless, the damage was done. I said nothing in response. We were close to our destination. I put my head down and just kept walking. For all his positive traits, Riley had one major flaw: he was stubborn to a fault, and prone to doubling down.

*“Oh c’mon, man, don’t be a baby. You have to know that it’s fake. No scientist is verifying that shit. Whoever owns the place doesn't let anyone test the stuff, like a real museum. It’s all just…I don’t know, smoke and mirrors? Sleight of hand? It’s a trick.”*

Dejection curdled in my gut like decade’s old milk, transforming into an emotion I’d never felt before.

Rage.

*“You’ll see, asshole,”* I whispered. Then, I ran ahead, out of the grass and onto the sidewalk. We were only a block away. The most vulnerable piece of myself needed to beat him there, confirm it was real, which would mean that it was *all* real, and Riley would have no choice but to eat his goddamn words.

My sneakers squeaked against the uneven concrete. Crisp night air inflated my lungs by the gulp-full. Static electricity sizzled over my exposed skin. As I felt the faintest echoes of fear, I began to slow my pace. Sprinting to jogging to just plodding forward while breathing heavy. The fear rose, seething, setting my blood on fire. Eventually, abruptly, I hit an impasse, physically incapable of pressing forward, and there it was, a perfectly normal slab of concrete, a lonely raft adrift in a sea of decay.

But there wasn’t a single ant to be seen.

I felt myself deflate. I could practically hear my confidence hissing like a teakettle as it leaked through my pores, rising into the night, never to be seen again. Before I could sink too deep in the mires of self-loathing, something startled me. From about fifty feet away, Riley was shouting, but the message made no sense.

*“Hey! Who is that?”*

Quickly, I spun around. Did a full three hundred and sixty degree rotation. There was the boarded-up house at the end of the road, the field we’d been walking through to arrive at the eastern edge of town, the flickering streetlamps, and nothing else. Not a soul to be seen anywhere.

*“Are you alright?"* he bellowed. *"Seriously, who the fuck is that? Standing behind you?”*

A little delirious, I shrugged, chuckled, cupped my hands over my mouth, and shouted back at him:

*“Genuinely…”* I paused for a moment, panting, “*…I have no idea what you’re talking about.”*

He started barreling towards me, shoulders angled like a quarterback. All I really felt in that moment was disorientation. That changed once Riley was close enough that I could appreciate his expression under the sickly glow of the streetlamps. His eyes were wide. His skin had turned table-salt white. The muscles in his face looked taut, almost spastic.

Riley was terrified.

Moreover, he could see something - *someone* \- on the sidewalk behind me. Someone who made him worry for my safety. Someone who looked dangerous. Right as it all began sinking in, there was a shift in Riley’s demeanor. In the blink of an eye, he’d stopped charging; sprinting with abandon one moment, walking gingerly the next. His panic disappeared, leaving his face unsettlingly blank. My head swiveled between the perfect sidewalk and my friend, side to side, back and forth, trying to understand what he was witnessing, and what it was doing to him. He about to pass right by me when I put my hand on his breastbone and held him there. His heart rate was slow, downright languid, but it was incredibly forceful. Each beat practically detonated inside his chest, pulses reverberating up my arm every few seconds.

*“What’s…what’s happening, Riley?”* I pleaded.

His eyes were open, but only slightly.

*“He’s been waiting for me,”* he stated.

Words failed me. Felt like my throat was caving in on itself.

*“The Five-Toed Man says it's my time.”*

I kept my hand on his chest, clasped his wrist in my other hand, and gently began tugging him away.

*“Riley…this was a mistake. We need to go.”*

Briefly, it seemed like I was making headway. Although his eyes remained fixed on that perfect bit of sidewalk, his legs were moving with mine, away from whatever was luring him closer.

Then I heard the last thing he ever said to me.

*“Don’t worry; it’ll be your time soon enough.”*

He gripped his digital camera tightly, like it was a stone, and in one smooth motion, sent it crashing into my head.

I collapsed, falling from the sidewalk onto the road, groaning, vision swimming. Sticky warmth trickled down my temple. When my eyes focused, all I could see what the night sky, moonless and grim.

Riley grabbed my hands and dragged off the street, back onto the sidewalk, laying me at the foot of the anomaly, The Five-Toed Man, like an offering.

The word *“wait”* quietly spilled from my lips, but it fell on deaf ears.

I saw the silhouette of my best friend arc the bloodstained camera over his shoulder.

I didn’t even feel an impact.

The world just faded away.

\- - - - -

When I came to, it was morning. The woman who owned our town’s pharmacy was kneeling beside me, asking what happened, asking if I was alright, her truck idling nearby. Memories of the night before trickled in painfully; a cheese grater rubbing against my concussed brain.

*“Where’s Riley…”* I muttered.

Before the ambulance arrived, I was able to get myself upright. I stumbled to where I thought that perfect bit of sidewalk was, but, to my horror, there was nothing. All the concrete was equally dilapidated.

Whatever had been there before was gone.

Later that week, I found myself in a police station being interrogated about Riley’s disappearance.

*“What drugs were you both on?”*

I stared at the officer, eyes wide with disbelief.

*“We weren’t on anything! I haven’t even had beer before, let alone drugs...”*

He clicked his tongue and shook his head.

*“Really? Y’all were sober? Sober on the east side, taking pictures of yourself in the middle of the night?”*

My heart fell into my stomach like an anvil.

*“…what do you mean, pictures?”*

He pulled four high-quality printouts from a manila envelope and threw them in front of me. They were all almost identical. We were standing on the sidewalk, arms around each other’s shoulders, looking into the lens, only visible from the waists up due to the way the shots were angled. Looking at the empty air above our shoulders made me squirm. In each picture, Riley’s face was concealed behind by what appeared to be motion blur. My face, on the other hand, was cleanly visible.

I was smiling, blood streaks glinting against the camera’s flash.

*“Who could take thousands of pictures, pictures like these, sober?”*

*“I…I…”* my voice trailed off.

Finally, he asked the question that’s plagued my broken psyche for decades.

*“Who’s behind the camera, taking the photos? Who else was with you that night?”*

To the officer’s frustration, to my parent’s utter disappointment, and to Riley’s parents’ absolute indignation,

I didn’t have an answer. I didn’t have a name to give.

I still don’t.

So, I said nothing.

Riley was pronounced legally dead two years later. The town assumed he got caught up in the drug trade somehow. Kidnapped and killed because he owed the wrong person money.

I knew that wasn’t true, but I couldn’t provide a better truth, so that became his story.

But I think I found that better truth.

It was inside *Curbside Emporium* all along.

\- - - - -

Like I mentioned at the beginning, I attended my cousin’s wedding in Philadelphia a few months back. I hadn’t planned on attending. As soon as I turned eighteen, I left Pennslyvania with no intention of returning. Out of the blue, though, my cousin called me, practically begged me to attend, claiming the family missed me, so I relented.

Sure didn’t feel like they missed me at the wedding, though, everyone leering in my direction with that all-too familiar look of thinly veiled disgust. Even my cousin seemed to surprised to see me, which was a little bizarre. Only got more bizarre when I thanked him for convincing me to come at the reception.

He denied ever calling me in the first place.

From there, though, it was already too late. The seal was broken. My trajectory felt inevitable, no matter how much I wanted to resist.

Yesterday, I handed Mr. Baker a hundred-dollar bill, pulled back the curtain, and walked into the showroom.

It wasn’t so bad. Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be, I guess. In fact, the nostalgia was sort of sedating. Took my time wandering around. It was all exactly as I left it. I even grinned when I passed by *Miss Sapphire*.

Eventually, I found myself in front of *Atticus* and *Finch*, those blackened, anomalous bones that seemingly fell from the sky in the eighties. It was never my favorite exhibit, so I had no intention of lingering, but a faint shimmer caught my eye. I tried to ignore it, but I still ended up standing in front of the glass, squinting at the shimmer.

Don’t know how long I just stood there, eyes glazed over and catatonic.

I’d never noticed the shimmer before.

It certainly couldn’t have been new.

How could I never have noticed it before?

I rubbed my eyes. Mashed them around in their sockets until their soft jelly hurt. Even slapped myself across the face once. No matter what I did, though, the shimmer didn’t change.

The light was reflecting off something buried in *Finch,* the smaller of the pair. A gleaming drop of silver jutting slightly from his collarbone.

There was no denying it.

It was a screw.

My neck creaked forward. I was standing in such a way that my reflection overlapped with the other, larger skeleton, *Atticus*.

We seemed to be a perfect fit.

I haven’t slept since.

I know that I’ll return to the east side of town. Eventually, I will.

Because it feels like its about my time.

The Five-Toed Man is going to make something out of me. Something important.

I never got my name on a plaque, but I suppose, in a way, this is better.

Honestly, I’m just happy to know that I’ll be with Riley again.

We’ll fall through the atmosphere, together.

Land in front of *Curbside Emporium*, together.

And maybe, if I’m lucky, if Riley’s forgiven me,

We’ll look up into the sky, together,

and I’ll feel that perfect [warmth again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
