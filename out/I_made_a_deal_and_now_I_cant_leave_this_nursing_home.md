I made a deal and now I can’t leave.

 I started working at this particular nursing home two years ago. I got the job by complete chance. My mother just so happened to be working as the main cook at the time and the previous dishwasher had died in a robbery gone wrong (unfortunate, I know). I wasn't even looking for employment, but my mother mentioned it was part-time and all I would be doing was washing pans all day. Deciding I could use the extra money while working on my college degree, I accepted. 

Very quickly, I realized this place was more than it seemed. Old buildings plus people dying regularly equaled an unsettling cesspool for the strange and unexplained. I could go on about the weird situations I’ve had, but that’s not why I made this post. 

Before I get into what happened, I need to explain some background. As I said, I’ve been working this job for two years. The deal in question happened a year ago from what I can remember. I wrote this post while sitting at my computer at home. I rushed home as soon as my shift was over because, for some unknown reason, I keep forgetting about the deal when I remember after I’d gone to bed. I only remember it now because I saw the thing I made the deal with today for the first time since. But, again, I’m getting off track. I must apologize for my frantic dumping of information, but I feel the tendrils of sleep clouding my mind and I have to write this out before I fall asleep and forget. Maybe then, I’ll start to remember more. 

This nursing home houses 3 types of residents. There’s memory care, which is end-of-life hospice care. Basically where sick and disabled elderly go to live out the rest of their days being sponge-bathed and spoon-fed gruel until the day their heart mercifully stops. Then there’s assisted living. Only slightly more humane, each resident is allowed to live alone in an apartment-style room while nurses constantly monitor their health and medications. Then there is independent living. It’s in a completely separate wing of the building and is almost devoid of nurse intervention. 

As I said, I started working here two years ago as a dishwasher. The work wasn’t complicated, but it was physically taxing. My hands were dried out from the chemical soap, my shoulders hurt from stooping over the sinks, and my asthma was constantly aching my lungs. I was, unfortunately, a victim of many respiratory infections as a child. While I hadn’t been hospitalized in quite some time, I still had to battle insistent asthma nearly daily. 

The worst part of the job was the other kitchen staff. My mother quit working in this nursing home a month into my employment to accept a position somewhere else, and her brutish, no-nonsense reputation didn’t extend to me. I spent my first few months as the bitch of the kitchen. They would leave all their unsavory side work for me to do and I would do it because I was spiteful and thought I could make myself too valuable to lose from the management perspective. In my childish, stupid mind, I thought I could choke out a raise or a promotion. I realize now that I’m a fool. 

My mother’s replacement was an older, softer woman by the name of Edith. Meeting her for the first time, I couldn’t help but think she wouldn’t last long here. My thoughts were only enforced by her complete lack of cooking expertise. She bragged that she used to work in a government building, but her terrible cooking must have been the reason why she no longer worked there. And much to my ire, she and I were lumped together as the two newbies disrupting the tight-knit group of kitchen staff. 

What followed was an elaborate round of hazing that was only disrupted by Miss Lorraine (the assistant kitchen manager) stepping in. They would take hour-long smoke breaks and leave Edith and me with all the prep, they would intentionally dirty dishes in ways that led to hours of scrubbing, even at one point, they broke a cart so that I had to make several trips with the smaller carts to get the food down the halls. 

Now, Miss Lorraine was an authoritative woman. She was in her late 50s and should have been retired but couldn’t bring herself to leave the kitchen. She was the sweet southern mama type, but when she was angry there was hell to pay. I knew better than to assume she liked me, though. She just hated to see the kitchen unorganized in the wake of the other staff’s hazing. 

And thus we get to the deal I made. 

As punishment after the hazing (for not sticking up for myself, I assume) Lorraine demanded I take the independent living cart (IL) to their wing. It was inconvenient seeing as how I had to wheel a long metal cart through stretches of hallways and through a courtyard to get to IL without the food getting cold. And said the courtyard was often used for assisted living (AL) smoking before meals. With my previously mentioned asthma issues, you can imagine how badly this trip could end for me. I tried explaining the situation to Lorraine, but she wasn’t having it. I was stuck taking the cart and living with the consequences. 

So, I loaded the plates of food onto the cart and started my journey. The cart was heavy with all the plates and pitchers of drinks, not to mention the ice chest on the bottom. I was already giving wheezing pants by the time I walked through the courtyard and saw the usual gaggle of 7 residents smoking their arrays of cigarettes. There was an attendant at the entrance of the IL wing who took the cart quickly. Leaving me to try to hurry away before I could get a whiff of the clouds of smoke. 

Of course, my luck was always terrible and one of the residents called me over to ask all kinds of questions about the lunch menu. Despite my desire to tell her to shove it and leave, I did my usual ‘smile and nod’ routine. I told her about our selections and how I could edit her ticket if she changed her mind about her entree. The entire time, I tried to avoid taking too many sniffs of the cigarette smoke permeating the area, but my work was for naught as she blew an entire lung full of Marlboro Reds in my face as a dismissal. 

For some ungodly reason, my brain seemed to think that I would be fine if I made it back to the kitchen. And while I’m sure that idea would be partially correct since I would have access to my inhaler, there was no way a simple puff would soothe the terror growing in my lungs. 

The way the building was set up was that the kitchen had two entrances. Each entrance led to a dining room on either side, separated by a wall in between. In the back of these dining rooms were doors that led to the same church-like chapel area they often used for physical therapy when it was raining outside. This room had one more side exit that I used to get to the IL courtyard and it was in this room I found myself collapsing. The pressure on my chest was just too much. Deep gulps of air passed into my mouth but never seemed to touch my lungs. At this point, my hands and lips started to tingle. 

There’s a moment when you’re having an asthma attack that you feel that you can force yourself to breathe. After all, it was a simple thing to inhale and exhale. But the mind over the body doesn’t work when your body just refuses to cooperate. I think I even threw up on the clean chapel carpet. The burn of bile in my nose and throat did nothing to aid my attempts at breathing. 

I knew nobody would hear me quietly choking to death. The kitchen was loud and the dining rooms were vacant. The nearest person would be the receptionist who was four empty rooms away. 

I had fallen to my knees in the aisle of the chapel. In front of me sat a lectern on an elevated platform the nursing home would usually let guest speakers present at. Behind it was a piano and one of those box speakers. Even farther back sat potted plants framing the giant cross hanging on the wall. I’m not a religious person by any means and I have witnessed firsthand that there was a lack of deity-like intervention in the world. But when your life is fading from your eyes, you get pretty desperate. 

I kneeled in a puddle of my own sick, one hand clawing at the carpet while the other pounded on my chest to try to get it to inhale. I mentally begged God to come to save me. As if someone could drop an inhaler on my head and I would live to see the next day. I didn’t realize it as the three doors to the room slowly closed with a click. Nobody was there to hear me before, but certainly, nobody would find me now. Piss soaked the crotch of my jeans and joined the mess on the carpet. The force of my gagging causes my muscles to contract and release. I hadn't had an asthma attack this badly ever in my life. And now this one would kill me. 

“How unfortunate,” I remember a voice whispering to me. I flinched harshly, the kind you do when a wasp flies right by your ear. “Such potential snuffed out so soon.” 

There was a weight on my back and when I looked up, I saw it was a man’s hand. 

But the man was grotesque. I had seen so many disfigurements in my time at the nursing home and dealing with the less-than-welcome guests. None of them looked even half as bad as this man. He was maybe in his 40s with a receding hairline parting his sparse blond hair. But the most eye-catching (no pun intended) thing about him was the scarring. 

All along the front of this man’s face was scarring. It wasn’t quite burned, The skin didn’t bubble, but was a smooth raised texture. It was heaviest at his eyes, leaving behind nothing but empty sockets.  His nose was mostly missing as well. Harsh shadows in the chapel outlined the shape of his skull. But the further down one looked, the less the scarring occurred. The only scarring on the lips was very slight, pulling the lip up to expose a pristine white tooth to my fuzzy gaze. 

“-Elp me,” I gasped, reaching to grip the man’s pristine pant leg. “Inhaler. Kitchen-” 

“Shut up,” The man demanded in his deep, honeyed voice. I whimpered pitifully while my vision clouded. In the next few seconds, I saw glimpses of people I had seen before. Josiah, an apparition who often liked screaming blood-curdling wails when you walked down the hall by yourself. Brenda, a wheelchair-bound woman who just pushed herself around asking- no begging anyone who would listen to help her find her way home. And finally, Derek, who once knocked a dirty mop bucket over onto the dining room rug when we cleaned up a biohazard.  

“You’re attracting too much attention to yourself," The man warned while the pews filled with old residents, some flickering in the dim light, some as unyielding as the man before me. "I will make a deal with you." 

A deal? I remember thinking. What kind of deal? 

My body slumped until my forehead was pressed into a blessedly clean part of the carpet. The man's hand on my back seemed to be the only thing holding me up. I could still smell the cigarette smoke on my shirt as it bunched up but was halted from going any further up than mid-back where the man touched. 

"You're close to death now. Do you accept my terms?" He asked so casually as if we were discussing the weather or the menu in the kitchen and not my next uncertain moments. We hadn't discussed terms for this deal, but I was in no position to negotiate (literally and metaphorically). With the last of my strength, I frantically nodded. I needed it. I needed it badly. I was afraid to die. 

The man raised his hand and for a moment I was afraid he was leaving without helping, but then it came down once more unto my back with such force I swore he's broken something. The sound I let out was little more than a gurgled groan whereas I wished to scream. My back burned with the aftershocks of his blow, but I found myself able to inhale properly now. 

Embarrassingly, after an asthma attack, you usually get a very bad case of burps. It's all the air you swallowed coming back up from your stomach. I wasn't sure how long I lay on the chapel floor, shaking, heaving, burping, and breathing. But the next thing I remember was sitting in one of the pews with my head in my hand. The burn in my lungs was gone, the pain in my back a dull throb. I no longer smelled of vomit and cigarettes. Just the strange twinge of scentless chemical soap. I was clean. 

I barely had the presence of mind to stand and exit the chapel to go back to the kitchen. Nobody seemed to notice my absence, and I realized we were still serving. Service usually took 45 minutes, 30 after taking IL. So I had been gone for less than that. 

The rest of the day passed in a blur I don't remember. When I got home, I showered. I stood under the scalding spray until it turned to icy daggers and barely managed to dig myself out and wrap a towel around my waist. My back burned something awful and I twisted and contorted myself in the mirror to get a glimpse of an angry red handprint. It looked like paint, it was so vividly red. The outer edges of it were raised in scar tissue. The skin outside of the scarring was a deep purple bruise. 

I take breathing treatments at night so that I don't stop breathing in my sleep, and usually after such a hot shower I would feel the slightest bit wheezy, but this time I felt fine, back pain aside. 

I may be foolish but I'm not an idiot, I took the breathing treatment anyway and went to sleep, making sure to lay on my stomach. By the time I woke in the morning, I didn't remember a thing. My back wasn't in pain, but I know now the handprint was still there. My asthma had disappeared. My inhaler sat in my backpack unused until it expired and even my coworker Wanda seemed to notice my improved health. She complimented my healthy appearance and told me about her own health issues. 

I saw the handprint today when I came home. I ripped off my shirt and twisted in the mirror to see it again. Still the same vivid red. Although the bruising was long gone. I met the thing I made the deal with today. The man. 

I had been tired of all the shit I'd had to deal with in this kitchen. Wanda, the woman who trained me, dead. Shit pay. Shit hours. Shit residents. I was tired. I was angry. I wanted to quit right then. Stomping to the manager's office, I slammed the door open when I would usually give a polite knock. Of course, the manager inside flinched hard, a look of anger on his face at my rude entrance. But I was looking at the other chair. 

The one that housed the man. The entire night flashed before my eyes once more and I knew him. 

"Jordan!" The manager cried. "I'm in the middle of a meeting! Get out!" 

The man raised a hand to stop his indignant demands. "Let's give him a chance to speak, Robert." His voice was the same. 

"I quit," I told them. "I can't work in these conditions and I quit."

Robert's face paled drastically, but the man seemed unbothered. The sockets where his eyes used to be twitched, like eyebrows, were furrowing. But the skin lacked the range of motion.

"That's unfortunate to hear, son," He said as if expressing condolences. "Robert, that's two employees in as many months." 

Robert looked like he was about to start crying. "I-I am sorry you feel that way, Jordan. Is there any way I could get you to stay?" 

I felt like hot shit then, I guess. "I'd stay if you paid me double." I spat, meaning to over-exaggerate in a way that conveyed I was not staying. 

"Done," The man purred like a cat who caught a pesky mouse. "Unfortunately, we're too far in the pay period to put that into effect now, but you should see it later this month." 

Both Robert and I stared with disbelief at the man who did nothing but run his fingers over a braille watch on his wrist and stand. "I should go, Robert. But I will return for our next meeting." 

Numb, I stepped to the side and let him pass. He had no cane or dog, nor did he lean against the wall as he strutted out of the kitchen in his clean three-piece suit. 

Robert sent me home early to relax and I'm doing everything but. I'm terrified.

I can't leave now that I know the man is real. And not just real? But provoking me. After all, who would agree to pay me double just to keep me here when they can hire someone to do my job for much less? I'm unsure of what to do and even less sure I will remember in the morning. 

I will leave this tab open and hopefully remind myself of what is going on before it's too late.
