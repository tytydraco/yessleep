The attic smelled like cold dust and dead Christmases.

The box was still there. Taped shut. Undisturbed. But the towel inside was damp, and the air around it felt wrong. Like stale breath.

The camera was warm.

And tucked beneath it, where the velvet lining had flattened with time, were three new photographs.
Each photo showed Grace’s room. Same angle. Same muted light, like the house itself was tired.
But things had shifted.

In the first, the door was open. The bed slightly unmade. Like someone had just left.

In the second, Grace stood beside the dresser. Her neck bent too far. Her foot wrong. Like she was learning how to wear herself again.

In the third, she was gone.

Only the mirror remained – cracked at the edge – and across the back wall, scrawled in something thick and black, one word;

***More.***

There was a second word, fainter – half hidden beneath peeling wallpaper.

Some kind of name.
Something *ancient* and *wrong*.
Letters I didn’t know how to say.

••

I took the camera outside and locked it in the shed. Not symbolic. Not ritual. Just fear. Old, animal fear. The kind that tells you to bury the bone and run.

That night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, trying not to blink.

Just after 2am, I heard something slide across the floor.

When I turned on the lamp, there was an envelope under the door.

No stamp, just my name, written in the same stuttering hand as the last one.

Inside: A photo of me.

Asleep.

Taken from the hallway, through the crack in the door. I was turned towards the wall. And in the reflection of the wardrobe mirror-

*Grace*
*Lying in bed next to me. Dead eyes burning a hole into the back of my head.*
*Not smiling*
*Just waiting*

And standing above her, barely visible in the dark glass – A second figure.

Bent and long. Antlered. Rooted.

Something that had *grown* wrong and put on the shape of a man.

It’s hand hovered just above her.

••

I tried to destroy the camera.

Smashed the lens with a hammer. Cracked the casing. Tore it open until the screws shrieked and back split wide.

No film inside.

Just a coil of something soft and pale, like wet string or gristle, tucked where the reel should’ve been. It twitched when I touched it.

I gagged.

On the inside of the back panel, scratched into the metal, were symbols – thin and spiralling.

I wrapped the whole thing in bin bags and drove to the canal. I didn’t say goodbye. I didn’t need to.
Whatever it was, it had already moved on.

••

The photo was on my pillow when I got home.
Same composition.

My bed. My shape under the blanket.

With me was unmistakably Grace. Watching me as I sleep.

The other figure I am not so sure about. It was too tall.

It’s arms too long, fingers bent backwards like snapped twigs. Mouth too wide.

It stood beside Grace, watching.

*Waiting*

••

Mum has changed lately.

She hums lullabies I don’t know. She talks to empty rooms. Once, I caught her drawing something on the bathroom mirror.

*Three interlocking circles.*

When I asked what it was, she wiped it away and spoke

*”It helps her find her way home.”*

She didn’t mean Grace.

••

Today I found another photograph in my coat pocket.

It showed the kitchen.

Grace at the table. Mum brushing her hair. And me, mid laugh.

My eyes were wrong. Too dark. Too empty.

Like someone had drawn them in charcoal and never finished the detail.

And standing behind the curtain – half hidden in shadow – was that same figure.

Closer now.

Horned.

Still watching. *Still waiting*

••

I’ve come to terms with the fact that the camera was never just a camera. It was a key.

And now that it’s open, something has come through.

It isn’t just feeding on memory. It’s replacing it. Redrawing the world. On frame at a time. Every photo shows a house that is less like mine. A family I don’t remember becoming.

Grace’s skin is smoother. Her teeth straighter. Her face brighter, Like the negatives are being re-exposed.

But I am always fading.

••

I’ve started finding old books in the hallway and dotted around the house. One’s I don’t remember anyone here owning. Pages marked with symbols – eyes, spirals, reflections scratched in with ink that shimmers under the light.

I destroyed one.

The next morning, it was back on the shelf.

The dedication now read:
*”To the one who watched.”*

••

I packed a bag and left.

*Or tried to.*

At the edge of town, I found a wooden gate I’d never seen before. Beyond it, fog. Nothing else. Just stillness.

Taped to the gate was a photo.

*Of me.*

Standing right there.

And in the background – unmistakably close now – was the figure.

*Antlers in silhouette.*
*Grace holding its hand.*
*Both of them beaming a welcome smile.*
