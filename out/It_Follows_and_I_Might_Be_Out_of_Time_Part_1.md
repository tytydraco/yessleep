It's close. Searching. I can feel it like a storm rolling in. We have to stop for a few days and... I'm terrified it's going to catch up. We both are. So for my sanity, I'm going to tell you how we got here, from the beginning. You're going to be smarter than I was if it ever follows you.

Thinking about it, I never liked living in an apartment complex. Pine Cone Landing is tucked into a part of town avoided by families and law enforcement alike. It wasn't just the sketchiness that put a bad taste in my mouth; there were too many people, too close by all the time. It didn't matter when it was, odds were good there was someone somewhere close. If it wasn't outside, it was noise from the unit to my left, right or above, small house noises from my own place. The walls were little more than drywall that may have sat near insulation before their installation. All of this in an environment with poor lighting, wandering junkies and no cameras. It isn’t too different from how I grew up, so I knew the ropes. I spent a lot of time in some degree of alertness. I now spend every moment that way.

 I worked from home in data entry, and kept to myself. It left a lot of space to observe the habits of the people I could always hear. From above, it was usually creaking, footsteps, human and dog. Maybe some random sounds of a phone dropping or dishes shifting. What are you gonna do? Apartment living. As far as I knew, apartment 23 above me was a chill middle-aged guy and his doggo, who kept pretty quiet too. 

It started one evening when he seemed to have some company. It was a lot of moving, floor groaning, random bouts of loud talking. It had been going on for a couple of hours, ebbing and flowing with its noise level. I didn't mind. It was easy to tune out while I worked; the tapping of keys was usually accompanied by a YouTube video or some music. I was typing out the final notes of the invoice, my fingers hesitated as I double checked the notations. Then, I hesitated a little longer, hands lowering as something else took the front seat of my attention. A quiet that wasn’t there before. That was never there if he was home and awake. 

Every sound from the unit upstairs had ceased. 

I looked at the ceiling, scowling. I'd heard something drop only a few minutes before between the walking and shuffling. You might think they all left, but they'd have to go right by my front door, and down the stairs on the opposite side of the wall I was facing. That was something you could feel in the floor with that many people. They were still up there. It was strange. Even so, I didn’t usually care enough to follow up on any of the weirdness that came through. After a few moments of wondering where the bustle went, I returned to my work. 

I didn't hear another sound from upstairs for the rest of the day or that night. A perfect Saturday passed with a couple of phone calls, food, a nap and wine in the evening. I had a glass for me, a glass for Evan. Another for me and so on; I had almost polished off the bottle when it occurred to me, I still hadn't heard a damn thing. Not even his sweet old dog. I racked my brain, trying to remember the guy's name. I quickly gave up, and poured the last of the wine into my glass. It didn't help the growing unease. I decided as I curled up in bed that night, that if I didn't hear anything by tomorrow afternoon, I'd take action. Maybe pretend I needed a cup of sugar so I could check in. I know this may sound excessive for a neighbor I've exchanged maybe ten words with, but I don't have a lot going on. I was accustomed to his daily routine, because it was constantly in the background of my own. There was no denying it had changed in the last two days. I've always liked quiet but this didn't feel like that. It was more like silence.

It’s important to note, I had my home set up oddly; the designated bedroom space was where I had my office and my bed was in the living room area. It was as far from the stairs as I could get, and usually unoccupied. I arranged it that way with my boyfriend’s help, for the quiet.

At some point that night, I dreamed it was snowing. I was standing on the back lawn, under the maple tree that grew a little closer to my balcony every summer. Its leaves were gone. I looked up at the gray sky, watching the flakes fall between its branches.... but it wasn't quite right. The snow felt abrasive, bounced off of my cheeks and onto my coat instead of melting. It fell in small bursts instead of that soft and steady way. 

When it got into my eye, I woke up gasping, coughing and blowing from my nostrils like a reflex, something covered and scraped me like sand. I brushed at the dusty substance in a blind panic, too breathless to scream, blinking around at the darkness, trying to figure out what the hell was happening. My last two coherent brain cells remembered that I had a lamp on the nightstand that I quickly flipped on. I was already covered in sweat, and gasped for air as I looked down at the rest of me. A thin layer of what looked like plaster coated most of my bed. I stared down at my powdered arms--

BOOM- BOOM-BOOM!

I jumped, stifled a scream as a few more flecks of the popcorn ceiling fell. All I could do was try to blink away the grit and breathe, make sense of what the hell was happening. I started to move, but froze when I heard another sound.

Something heavy dragging, scraping metal and fabric on hardwood. I tracked its path like I could see through his floor, and listened when he moved towards the kitchen. Then it stopped. I waited for footsteps to start making their way around the apartment, but there was nothing except my labored breaths. Trembling, I got out from under my blankets and shook them out, leaving the mess for tomorrow. I looked back up while I dusted my arms, thinking 'if he can stomp and make plaster fall, how sturdy is this ceiling?' That sounds intentionally stupid, but believe me. These apartments are made on the cheap and filled with the sort that have odd lives. A few loud stomps was nothing compared to some of the other sounds I've heard from surrounding units. 

I shook my head, deciding that at least there were signs of life again. I crawled back into bed, trying to ignore the chill that settled over me. Instead, I focused on the sound of someone walking up the stairwell, another tenant letting the door close in the laundry/mail building across the sidewalk. All the while waiting to hear any sign of the neighbor as I drifted off. 

The next morning I slept in until 10 a.m., then proceeded to clean up the mess from the night before. After doing some laundry, more tidying, I still didn't hear anything and decided: maybe the guy was shacking up somewhere else. Perhaps thinking about moving? That would explain the weirdness so far, and good on him. Later on, I closed my laptop for the night, standing and stretching after the busy but comfy day. Mid-victory stretch, my balled fist bumped the coffee thermos that kept me going... before I could fully gasp, it was clattering on the floor, sending the last swills splashing all over. I cussed under my breath, moving around the desk to start cleaning up before it soaked in. 

A short series of sounds came from above, but they blew to the wayside as I sprung into action. I started rushing around for paper towels, for cleaner, I looked under the bathroom sink, in the cupboard, anywhere my scatter-brain might put a bottle of chemicals. I felt strangely agitated, damn near overstimulated by trying to track down something to scrub the carpet. It was like there wasn't enough room in my brain to see it even if I did come across it....

I was reaching to move stuff under the kitchen sink when it finally hit me. I froze, half bent over. I watched the hairs raise on my extended arm as my body registered what already took me too long to notice. 

A flurry of noise from the neighbor’s place had suddenly stopped too. A mix of steps, hardwood groaning, and something else had followed me through my crusade. I’d been too worried about the damn sub-floor to notice, but that was over. A different part of me now clocked the growing unease.

Anyone who has experienced a hostile home or even a bad neighborhood knows what I mean when I say: you can tell when approaching footsteps are meant for you. You learn when they’re fine, angry or coming for you. It made me think of things I didn’t want to, and I knew this wasn’t the time. I had to calm down and think; as difficult as it was, necessity is that simple. My upstairs neighbor barely acknowledged I existed and I granted him the same courtesy; it was our system, we stayed out of each other's hair. Could someone else have moved in? I scrapped that immediately, that would have been loud, impossible to miss. Maybe someone house-sitting? No, that wouldn't make sense if he had company. I was pretty sure it was still him up there.  

After a couple more minutes of silent contemplation, I decided there was no way or reason for him to follow me through the apartment. No point. I quickly grabbed some bottle from under the sink, closing the case on being.... what would you even call it, micro-stalked? It doesn't matter. It was in my head. Even so, I tiptoed to the office. I scrubbed, sponged up and cleaned as quietly as I could. 

I went to bed exhausted that night. My eyes closed on their own, and it occurred to me that I should try to get to sleep earlier. It wasn't a crazy day by any means, but I felt drained. Tense. A few minutes passed of me dozing; I was on the edge of deep sleep when wood groaned from the ceiling just above my bed. My eyes snapped open, accompanied by a sick feeling. Nauseating dread. A part of me didn't want to move as I stared at the spot bare of that popcorn texture. I was suddenly conscious of how loud my breath was, how my bed would creak if I did get out of it. It was a feeling all too familiar... And that pissed me off.

The tension, the fear gave way to white hot anger; I ripped off my comforter, putting all of my weight into the mattress so the upstairs neighbor could hear my crappy metal bed frame as I got up. I stomped over to the TV, turned it on and up to eleven, letting the laugh track of some sitcom fill the quiet apartment. The floor above creaked as I heard him move back towards the kitchen, then the office. I laid back down, fighting the urge to yell a few choice words to the ceiling. 

The doubt let itself in a little later as my heartbeat slowed and my eyelids fluttered again. I'm not the best person to deal with what seemed to be happening above. Changes in manner mixed with dead silence, with a dash of sleep deprivation. As someone with a harsh past and anxiety I had only recently learned to control, I could admit: I'm wired to fixate and that's what I was doing. Over a couple days of passing weirdness. I was turning it into a problem. Possibly making it his, with passive aggressive gestures.

I jumped with the sharp ring of my charging phone, pushing all else from my mind. A pang of missing him ached as I hit the green circle on the screen, putting it to my ear as I muted the TV with the remote.

"Baby I thought you'd be out of range for a couple days!" Evan's chuckle sent a ripple of warmth through me. 

"It’s so good to hear your voice, did I wake you up?"

" No, no, have you been taking pictures?"

"Of course, and all of them will be yours. I wish I was seeing it all with you, Mimi." I grinned at hearing the name he kept just for me. That I only heard from him. My real name is Miranda. He makes that feel so much sweeter. He'd been in France for nearly two weeks. *Only 5 days to go* I thought, wrapping my other arm around me.

"With this new job, I'll pay for our next trip there. Tell me everything."

"I'm not sure there's time, so we'll call it all great. Except for missing a particular sassybutt back home."

"Come on now, I’ve behaved."

"Only because you miss me too, now tell me. How are you?"

I looked back up at the ceiling. "It's been a time. It feels like..." I trailed off, trying to think of a way to explain it without sounding paranoid. He was quiet for a few moments.

"Is everything okay there?" I sighed, lowering my head into my hand, rubbing it. "The upstairs neighbor has been acting off. Or at least, the sounds from up there are odd."

The last few days tumbled out in tired murmurs. I told him everything. From how it started Friday to the weird familiar feeling it all brought about. He listened, matching the quiet and calm I was trying to keep. By the end I was bone-tired. I waited, expecting the usual optimistic note he brought to the dark. I closed my eyes and leaned back, ready to absorb the cozy. 

"I'm coming home."

"Babe, that isn't what I was saying."

“If you don't feel safe, I should not be here. I take my role as best boyfriend very seriously and you notice everything, compulsively. I’ll hedge my bets that something is up, Mimi.” I slumped against the headboard. His complete acceptance always has a way of taking the wind out of me. Even so, he'd had dreams of France. Paid through the nose to take this trip. 

"It's only a few more days. I'm okay."

"You're unsettled at the very least. I don't like that you're alone." I didn’t really know what to say that wouldn’t make his case. I didn’t want him to give up a single day of adventure for me either.I heard a sigh from the other end and knew he’d read my mind. I also think a small part of him wanted just a little more time too, and that’s okay. I still appreciated his concern.

“I’ll be working my way down the mountain starting tomorrow. I’ll be headed your way. Will you put that security bar on the door? For some peace of mind." 

"You got it. I love you."

"I love you, Mimi. Sleep well with kind dreams."

"Be safe, have fun." The call disconnected. I stared down at the screen for a few moments after: 12:19 a.m. Odds were good he was about to cook up some oatmeal, maybe watch the sunrise over the Alps. All the while fighting off the freezing cold; I didn’t envy him. I’m not sure how his body could pull him up the heights of the earth and nature then return, but he loved it. Damn did I miss him.

I jolted a little against the unmistakable sound of the door just above my own in the stairwell, opening. Closing. My reaction was instant. I got up, staring at the front door as I scrambled to move, thinking of my promise to Evan. Heavy footsteps trudged down the first flight, seeming to slow on the landing. I moved around the bed, tiptoeing towards the pantry. I could hear him coming down the next five stairs, which would bring him to the second floor. I quietly opened its flimsy door and grabbed the adjustable bar of steel. I turned to use it but paused.

The footsteps stopped. My mouth went dry with that certainty you get. That you’re in danger or being watched. As if he knew, the floor just outside creaked. So close, I felt it in the soles of my feet. 

My chest was pounding, I was counting the moments he stood there, just a couple of feet away, was he waiting? Stopping to look at his phone? The only answer was another groan of flooring. I fought panic, desperate to put a steel bar between the door and wall, in front of him, between us. He’d hear it, though. Any movement would give away just how frightened I was. How I was monitoring him. The thought jerked me into a glimpse of rationality. I was stalking him. Tracking his movements, I had no way to prove he was doing the same to me.

*He’s the one standing outside of your door.*

I took a deep breath, mustering courage: paranoid or not, I couldn’t live like this. It was time to stop with the questions, and confront whatever in the hell this was. Gripping the door bar tighter, I unlocked the deadbolt with my free hand. I grasped the knob, turning it and letting in the impending winter. I hoped the neighbor might get a startle, or a message: do not fuck with me.

My stomach dropped as my eyes swept the small landing. No one was there. I looked down the stairs, up the stairs, nothing. No one. There was no noise of retreat either. I quickly darted back inside, slamming and locking the door.

I didn’t sleep much that night; around five in the morning, I decided to put my deepening anxiety to work. I knew what I heard, but it felt like there was nothing to be done. I couldn’t prove or explain it. All I could do at the moment was plow through some of those invoice entries, and nap later without worrying. If I was lucky, I could just be. I missed that I thought, fighting not to hunch over my keyboard.

Work went by in a blur as the sun rose, warming the office more and more. I had the insulated curtains to thank for that; they provided privacy and kept the room from getting too chilly. My stomach started to growl around 9:30 a.m., pulling me out of the zone. I was more than halfway through the day I realized, which felt like success. 

I went to break, grabbing some crackers and munching as I found something to watch on my phone. I wasn’t feeling documentary or commentary type stuff. I had a few comfort shows I liked, and felt weirdly indifferent to that idea too. I put down my phone, feeling a spike of annoyance as I picked something random from the history channel. Great. I couldn’t eat, sleep or mindlessly watch something. I threw the saltines back in the cupboard with a small amount of disgust, letting the cheap compression wood fall back closed. Like a hostile echo, a cupboard door slammed from the kitchen above mine, then another, then one more. I couldn't hear if he slammed any more through the rushing, growing pulse in my ears.

The human race did not survive because of its intelligence, or ability to procreate. Yes, those definitely helped us along, but the very first contributor to our longevity as a species comes down to one thing: adrenaline. It kept us running, fighting, living.

That primal mechanism threatened to overwhelm me; my fingers and toes prickled, ready to burst with blood-flow while my heart tried to tear through my ribs. The swelling of muscle in my calves, my thighs was almost painful, begging me to run as far from whatever in the hell was going on as I could. It already felt like I was being attacked, ripped apart, dying, fleeing, fighting, my very veins felt like they were trying to escape my body. I put my hand on my chest, trying to breathe, trying to think through the ringing in my ears. My whole body felt damp, I braced my hands on my knees, staring at the grains of the faux wood flooring. He had to be following me, listening to me, it was too many coincidences. I sank to the floor, watching the world get further from me, an illusion that sealed my understanding of what was about to happen. One last thought clawed its way to the surface of the violent terror embracing me: *Please don’t let me be out for long.*
