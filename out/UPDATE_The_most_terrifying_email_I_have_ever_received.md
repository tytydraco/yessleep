[The most terrifying email I have ever received : r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p2p9gf/the_most_terrifying_email_i_have_ever_received/)

As you know from my previous post, I am too curious for my own good. It nearly got my family and I in great danger. This luckily happened a while ago, and I have updates. You have to know exactly how dangerous these people were. This is my experience of a series of disturbing revelations from video calls and a Google search.

After posting I decided to go to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine and type in the URL. I was trying to curb my curiosity and mind my own business. I wanted to do it, get closure and move on. Part of me wanted to know, because it barely felt real. I typed in the URL and I saw it was saved twice. It didn't exist for very long. I was taken to a webpage about childcare options. The headings were in English but the main texts under them were your standard Lorem Ipsum type text. It was deeply weird, and I don't know what it means.

A week or so after posting my experience, I got a private message request from a burner account. They gave their email address and number. We began video calling each other and chatting on Whatsapp. I'll call her Sydney, after a famous final girl. She started by talking to me about music, movies and food. We both love horror. She's a beautiful woman only two years older than I am, an American of Korean descent. She's also an adoptee emancipated from her adoptive parents. She told me this straight away, unashamed of her story. I told her about my story in response.

After seeing I was trustworthy, receptive and that we have similar taste in movies and music, she opened up to me. She told me about her husband, how they met. I won't go into detail. Their song was Champagne Supernova, the song they kissed and danced to. They honeymooned in Europe. Her father-in-law had warned them about going to a certain area of Belgium. He warned of his estranged brother and his family.

After a blissful time touring through Britain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. This is the part where things get dark. They made the ultimate mistake in horror movies and in real life, you don't go into places you're not supposed to. The two of them had befriended Nicole Dubois, and she invited them to their castle. They were very polite and it was their first time in Europe. They were terrified of the cultural and language barriers, that they'd upset someone.

The Dubois were friendly if not a bit detached. The castle was massive, with amazing architecture. She sat on her bed, quickly getting her phone. She was so incredibly beautiful even just doing that, her purple hair up in a twist. She sent me photos that I checked out. They took her on a tour; she spoke of and showed me strange symbols and a hall of mirrors. Most bizarre was a room with tall pillars and arches, with a large carpet at the centre. A circle inside a square in two different shades of red. When she looked up at the ceiling, she saw many lights that reminded of stars. She sent me a few photos. It was incredibly beautiful, to be honest.

My father and I must share this laptop I'm posting from, and he wanted to be on it doing who knows what. I hung up and gave it to him reluctantly. Everyone also asks who I'm talking to. As soon as I could, I texted her and asked if we could video call. When she gave the go ahead, we did just that.

We both had Indomie Mie Goreng noodles, both of us can't get enough of it. I listened and ate; she told her story.

Sydney told me that she couldn't sleep on the second night. She kept hearing music. She followed it and recorded a video on her phone that she sent me. It depicts a ritual, in which cloaked figures chant and try to summon a dark being, all in a circle. The music is strange, both jubilant and mournful, both profane and sacred. I was terrified when I saw that they slit a woman's throat. I was so disturbed that I started crying, both from shock and disbelief. I suddenly felt the weight of my curiosity, the price for meddling with things I don't understand. I was akin to an investigative journalist, learning what the CIA award for investigative journalism was. I knew acutely that it wasn't a game. I felt like a dumbass, but Sydney said she was the same. "Too curious for my own good. We'd be great in a horror movie together lol."

Sydney recalled wanting to leave, showing her husband the video. She backed it up on the cloud, knowing they'd try and delete the video. They tried to pack as quickly as they could. They were done being polite. The Dubois family confronted the couple, who were planning to leave. They shot her husband in the head and knocked her unconscious. She burst into tears, saying it was still raw. I said I wished I could hug her. "I just miss him so much. I miss how he looked at me. I missed how he made me feel like I belonged."

She took a while to compose herself, but I sat with her. She resumed telling her story. "The next few hours were brutal. These degenerates were running around with guns hunting me and other victims of theirs." she said. She was wearing sneakers, the rest of them had terrible footwear. They got glass in their feet, one of them even got caught in a trap.

She was strategic, choosing to hide and use objects around her to her advantage. She heard screams and even saw someone get shot in the head. She wasn't injured much, but the surviving members ultimately found her. They were going to kill her when the figure in the red cloak intervened. It was her husband's lost twin sister, who her father-in-law had to give up so they could walk away alive. She was very kind but traumatised, so much that she had a dissociative disorder. She killed the remaining members of the cult and then herself, leaving Sydney crying and bloodied.

Sydney says that the important players are dead, but that it's a rabbit hole that no one wants to go down. "I don't know what the investigation will turn up, or if there will even be one."

Her father-in-law inherited the business, but Sydney brought him on the video call and he said he is looking to sell it. He wants to donate money to organisations that help people going through similar things. He is a wonderful European gentleman. He clearly took her under his wing and I'm happy for her. She'll be just fine. Not completely of course, she often has nightmares and certain sounds trigger panic attacks. I learned a lot from her, and if I had the money, I'd go to visit her. 

As many of them are dead, I don't know what that means for me. What it means for the guy that threatened me. I hope he's dead, and if he isn't I hope I am as brave as her.
