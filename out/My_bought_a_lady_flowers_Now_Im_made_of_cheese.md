Yeah, yeah.

Say what you will about it.  But that's what happened.  And it wasn't like I *wanted* to be made of cheese.  It does have its perks, I'll admit.  And its drawbacks.

One of the perks is that beautiful witch.  I get to sit on her table everyday, just reading stupid nosleep stories and adorning her bread.  I guess in a way, she accepted my advance!  I always wanted to date a witch.  Mission accomplished.

The drawbacks... well, she eats me, for one.  That goes without saying.  But it's like a lovely kiss, to match that lovely face.  Matilda is welcome to eat me anytime she likes.

You might be asking 'alright now, hol'up, how's a block of cheese using a computer?'

Glad you asked.  You ever seen that 'Pickle Rick' episode of Rick and Morty?  I'm sure you have, and that is absolutely *not* how I'm doing it.  I'm not smart enough to be Rick Sanchez.  No, I actually just have the cat type for me.  Hah, you knew there would be a cat!  You knew it, you son of a bitch!  And of course it's a black cat.  God, I love Mittens.

You know, just yesterday, Mittens and I were having a conversation about spoons.  I fucking love spoons.  Matilda gave me a whole pile of them.  Fantastic.  Some of them are wooden, some are gleaming silver.  She even has one made of plastic.  Plastic is cool.  I think the world needs more plastic.  Wouldn't it be neat if the entire ocean was made of plastic?  I think so.

Anyways, I'm rambling.  There's a point to all this, I assure you.

Yesterday, while riding the cheese wagon into town, I ran into Mayor Bubbles.  Mittens was a bit grouchy that day, a bit annoyed at having to pull the cheese wagon, so we didn't talk for long.  But it was a fruitful exchange, even if brief.  He told me this:

"I am a very special boy.  Vote for me!"

And I will.  I think it is very important to vote.

Now let me tell you something else.  The mayor has a dark secret.  And you know what that is?  Well, I'll tell you - he's a Jedi.  He once showed me his laser sword.  Mittens was not impressed, but I was.  Laser swords are the tits.  Ah shit, I think I'm getting distracted again.

So I was going to town, in my cheese wagon, and I realized I probably needed new wheels of cheese to replace the old wheels of cheese when I noticed the wheels of cheese were growing moldy.  So I asked Mittens to pull over at the cheese wheel dealer so I could deal in some wheels.  And when I rolled inside, the wheel dealer dealed a wheel so delicious Mittens ate it.  So now we were back to moldy wheels.  But I forgive Mittens, he's the best.

Then we went to New Spain, which is the best Spain and pretty easy to fly to on your frogs.  When we landed, ribbits abounding, we had to hire a car because frogs can't fly the cheese wagon.  But neither hell nor high water would stop me from getting that sparkling, brand-spanking new cheese wheels.  But I did realize I'd forgotten to call Matilda and let her know I'd taken her frogs.  So I had Mittens dial and he looked a bit annoyed but he's a bro.  He said 'Meow'.  I couldn't hear her reply, but I imagine it was something like 'I love my cheese boyfriend so very much.'  Undoubtedly.

Gertrude's Cheese Wheel Emporium is the best cheese wheel emporium in New Spain.

I was beyond impressed.  There was Swiss cheese, provolone, spicy cheese, whale cheese... every kind of cheese.  So I bought all of them, using Matilda's magical credit card that she never had to pay off, because it's a little something called theft.  Yeah, I mean, she's a witch.  Of course she has magical credit.  But I digress, when the frogs landed us back home in Old Spain, I had Mittens put those new wheels on the cheese wagon.  It was glorious.

And that was when it happened.

A giant walrus.  No.  Not again!

It descended from the clouds, all tusks and flippers, top hat and monocle.  It landed on a giant pedestal.  Always, pedestals, those walruses.  With a proper *harumph*, it took note of my cheese wagon.  Mittens arched his back and hissed.  What's with walruses?  I don't know why they don't just stay up in the sky where they belong.

"I am Mr. Tubs.  I have come for your cheese wheels," it bellowed.

"Over my sharp flavor!" I yelled.

We battled for five years.  But of course, I was the victor.  Mr. Tubs fled back to the clouds in shame, and I finally got my cheese wagon safely home to Matilda.

"I was worried about you," she said.  How beautiful.  "I heard there were walrus bandits harassing the cheese caravans.  You know, if you're going to be away for five years, you should probably call and check in."

Mittens meowed.

"Watch you language," Matilda replied.  "Or take it outside."

Mittens shrugged, then left to go to his dance classes.  He'd have to make up for five years of absence, I suppose.  But he's my boy!  I believe in him!  Woooooo.

At this point, I was pretty ready to be eaten again.  Five years battling a walrus, a boy deserves some recompense.  So I told Matilda to get out the toast.  She had the best toast.  So she did.

I bet I was delicious.  I love being cheese.
