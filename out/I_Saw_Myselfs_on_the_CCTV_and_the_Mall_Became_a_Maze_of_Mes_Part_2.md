The moment I stepped into the corridor, reality buckled like a heat-wrapped film.

I ran, my flashlight beam fracturing into prisms, painting the corridors with colors that didn’t exist. The mall wasn’t the mall anymore. The hallways twisted like intestines, walls glistening with a sheen that pulsed like breathing flesh. Clocks hung from the ceiling, their faces liquefied, hands spinning backward, then forward, spiraling into impossible knots. My footsteps echoed, but they weren’t mine alone.

Others joined—too many, out of rhythm, some skittering like insects, others heavy as stone. I passed a storefront, its glass now a mirror, and saw not one reflection, but hundreds, crowding the surface. Their faces melted, mouths screamed silently, eyes blooming like flowers of black light.

The air tasted of ash and static, and the lights flickered in patterns that carved shapes into my vision—spirals, fractals, things that shouldn’t be seen. I stumbled into the food court, now a cavern of impossible geometry. Tables floated in mid-air, their legs twisting and curling like roots; chairs sprouted thorns of glass that shimmered in the dim light.

In the center stood another me, his uniform shredded, skin translucent, veins glowing like constellations. His head lolled unnaturally, neck bending at angles that made my stomach churn. He turned toward me, and his eyes were not voids but endless depths, swirling with stars that pulsed in time with my heartbeat. I froze, horrified and mesmerized, as it stared back at me—*through* me, as though it knew something I didn’t.

*“You’re late,”* he said, his voice a chorus of mine, layered with tones that made my skull throb. His mouth split wider, teeth spiraling inward like the jaws of a black hole, pulling at the very air around us. *“They’re here. The ones who are you. The ones who aren’t. Time’s a tapestry—and you’re the tear.”*

I screamed, my voice unraveling into threads of light that floated upward. I ran, the mall folding in on itself, corridors looping into Mobius strips, doors opening to ceilings, to voids, to versions of the food court where the other mes waited. One grabbed me, his hand cold as deep space, fingers sinking into my arm like roots. ‘Don’t look at the stars,’ he whispered, his face collapsing into a swirl of colors that burned my retinas like poison. I struggled, my arm locked in his grip, skin sizzling as the roots burrowed deeper. And then—*a flash*—I tore free, my skin peeling away in ribbons of light.

Somehow, I reached the parking lot. The sky was a wound, stars pulsing like infected sores, constellations whispering my name in languages older than bone. My car sat where I left it, but its reflection in the asphalt split into a dozen shadows—each with a different me inside. One clawed at the glass. Another grinned, teeth too many. One just wept, eyes static-blurred. I got in. The engine groaned like it knew the road was wrong. I drove, the road stretching into infinity, the horizon folding upward like a wave.

I’m home now, but home isn’t right. The walls shimmer, the mirrors show faces that aren’t mine but are. I checked my apartment’s security camera feed. There I am, standing in the hallway, my body a silhouette of writhing shapes, my eyes leaking light. Behind me, the shadow is taller, its edges blooming into fractals that swallow the frame. I’m inside, typing this, but I hear footsteps in the hall, too many, all mine.

I don’t know what I am anymore. But I know I’m not alone.
