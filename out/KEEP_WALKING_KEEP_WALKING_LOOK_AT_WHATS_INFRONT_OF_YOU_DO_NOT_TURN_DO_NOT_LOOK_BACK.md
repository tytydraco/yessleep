“EVERYBODY KEEP YOUR FOCUS AT THE FRONT. I REPEAT. EVERYBODY KEEP YOUR FOCUS AT THE FRONT!!” 


I could barely make out the announcements.


The cacophony of helicopters and planes shot through the sky with every second that passed.


It wasn’t like i wanted to hear the same repeated bellow, but i did want to hear something different. 



Yet, i already knew nothing would change. 



It was hot and musty but somewhat cool, you know that feeling when you’re at the beach - sand resting in between your toes, sweating from the intense heat as you feel the suncream tickling your back. Then you run into the water, dipping your head beneath the waves, tasting the saltiness that lingered in the corners of your mouth. 


I like to picture those moments.



The smooth ground, not a single rock. Hopping on a new bicycle for your birthday, gripping the handles as your heart races with excitement. You pedal slowly. Then you watch yourself progressively get faster and faster, the wind blowing your ears the smells of trimmed grass. Then you fall, feeling the warm hands that carry you, tears brimming your eyes, blood trickling down your nose that stain the flowery plaid dress that you always wore. 


The air smells like that. 




I wasn’t even scared. 



“KEEP WALKING. KEEP WALKING. LOOK AT WHATS INFRONT OF YOU. DO NOT TURN. DO NOT LOOK BACK!” 


I ignored the next announcement that blared in my ears. Why do they make the most nonsensical commands? There were heaps of people in front of me, so i there was no way i could “look” at what was “in front” of me anyway. 


Instead my gaze was at the floor, i peered at my shoes. I thought about the evening when i first opened them - i knew that they were my favourite pair, i cleaned them everyday and night thanking them for making my feet happy. But now they were badly smeared in mud that you couldn’t tell that they were shoes that i was wearing. 


I didn’t care.



Although the frequent wails of the alert numbed my ears, i was still able to hear the little boy that cried in desperation. 



“I WANT IT BACK. MOMMY LET GO! I WANT HIM BACK! MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY!” 


I saw the boy drop the stuffed animal out of his soggy, hand just a while ago. Ever since then he has been screaming at his distant mother whose grip tightened on her son.


I could tell from the way she yanked her child. Her matted hair in chunks, her boobs lacking any support as they were solely covered in a pink tank top that exposed some parts of it. Her child screamed more, tears rolling down his reddened cheeks - a mop of uneven brown hair that moved in the wind. 


She didn’t care. 



His hoarse voice still carried on, yet she did not care. 


The people behind us trodded on without a single thought, her slim, boney hand simply let go of the little boy - and her body just turned around.


And we kept moving.


The boy stopped. 


I did feel a pinch of sympathy for him, the way his eyes widened and his messy brown hair rested against his wet cheeks. The crowd behind us were moving, he could not react or turn - so i snatched his hand. 


I didn’t care. But i wanted to avoid any interference with anyone. He was not my problem. Just not trying to provoke one.



The road seemed to drag on for eternity. No rocks, no cars, just walking on a singular wide road. 



I felt a pull on my arm as i realised i was holding a kid in my hand.



I turned to face the boy who frowned and quivered his lips. 


“I want my mommy…” he whimpered, i barely heard him over the noise.


“She’s gone.” i replied deadpanned.


“Where’s your mommy.?” he asked, fresh tears forming around his eyes.



“Dunno…” i looked up at the heaps of grunting men and women.


“How old are you..?” the boy asked inquisitively, as he plopped his thumb in his mouth.


“Did mommy ever teach you basic manners or you just a dumbass like everyone else.?” i shot at the child who seemed offended. 


I didn’t care. He was at least seven by the looks of it, and a draining, whiny kid. 


But i had to take him. 


And i would admit he did a good job with taking onboard his mother’s death for the good hour that passed by. So i asked him.


“You still miss your mother?” 


“Mommy always leaves and she will come back.” 


He replied faster than i expected. 



“This time she wont come back.” i coldly said. 


“Nobody ever comes back for me.” his face began to tense up and he started to cry, i rolled my eyes and tucked my free hand in my pocket. 



“EVERYBODY KEEP YOUR FOCUS AT THE FRONT. I REPEAT. EVERYBODY KEEP YOUR FOCUS AT THE FRONT!!” 



I pulled out the golden necklace with a green turtle on it and wrapped it around his neck and quickly clipped it at the back. It bounced with each step he took, shining through the thick, scorching dust. He gave a short smile, the one that reminded me when i was given two of those necklaces, i didn’t want to give it to anyone else, just me.



I had to keep the kid smiling.




But with every step, the more and more i found myself sinking into a pit of—



“ALL PEOPLE;  DUE TO THE CURRENT INTERFERENCE THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE, YOU WILL BE SAFE AND PROTECTED SOON; PLEASE FOLLOW RECENT COMMANDS, DO NOT HESITATE. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT! I REPEAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT. DO NOT HESITATE.



I believe i heard the sound of relief from multiple people as they carried on walking, some held their precious belongings, tucked underneath their hands and arms, some held babies and small children. But for me. I didn’t have anything to hold. 


“Are we going home now?” the kid asked me, a faint smile plastered itself across his pink cheeks.


“Not sure. We just have to keep walking—“



“My legs hurt, and im hungry!” the boy began to whine but gave him a scolding look to show im not picking him up like a fucking baby and that he could eat his mismatched socks for all i care. 



“What’s your name?” the child questioned, after a long silence between us.


“Not like you can remember it anyway..” i sneered, feeling the warmth radiating from his hands as i realised i was still holding it. 


“Well, my names Aryan.” his flock of hair danced in the predatory wind and tickling his face, covering parts of his hazel eyes.


“Maeve.” my gaze altered from his sparkling eyes. I always thought that my name was stupid, and here i am, the growing shame crept inside of me as i mumbled my name to this kid.


“When we get saved, you can come to my house whenever you want to—“


“No thanks im not a child.”


“But you are one!” the boy giggled, i squeezed his hand for a split second before he tugged away, yelping in pain and then he smacked my arm.




“ALL PEOPLE;  DUE TO THE CURRENT INTERFERENCE THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE, YOU WILL BE SAFE AND PROTECTED SOON; PLEASE FOLLOW RECENT COMMANDS, DO NOT HESITATE. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT—“



“Maeve…legs…really.. hurt.. can we turn back now…?” my eyes widened, i shot him an agitated response.


But of course, he didn’t listen. 


I couldn’t have the people around us get more annoyed than before so i did what i had to do. I quickly ordered him to jump on my back, which he instantly did. His dinosaur shoes coated with dirt, softly hitting my old hoodie with each step we took. 


“When we get…home…we can…play with my new toys…mommy got from her new boyfriend…” Aryan yawned, nesting his head against my neck, his warm breath fanning the areas of my shoulder that was somewhat cold. 



I wasn’t used to keeping a track of time especially when my entire focus was on the people that trotted in front of me, each step caused a groan from them and without the frequent blares of the announcements, i couldn’t figure out exactly what was going to happen next. 


My body was stiff. Legs burned out. I remember hurling down the streets after snatching bread of the market trays and the two older men chased after me. My body was stiff. Legs burned out. Sitting next to the two kids who were starved - i shakily broke a piece of bread in my dirty fingers that wanted to savour the moment. I gave it to the kids who instantly shoved it into their small trembling mouths, eyes pleading for a home to stay, hair desperately seeking for the hot water to wash away the pain that they carried with them.



It was only at that moment where i found myself tracing back to those old memories, that my eyes caught a glimpse of something truly inexplicable. 


The sky was black and scattered with milky dots. But…


“Are…we…h-home..now…may..may??..” groaned Aryan as he wiped the sleep from his eyes, my shoulders ached, i slowly let him down grabbing his small fingers in my hands and tugging him forward.



“W-what’s going on… why we moving so fast…” whined Aryan, his big brown eyes looking into mine for answers, but i didn’t have any.



I dragged him along like his mother, the boy clutched the golden turtle necklace as i held mine around my neck - the crowd behind us becoming more hectic, pushing and pushing and pushing. 


Something was wrong.



The announcements screamed at us, but my mind was a blur, the only sounds that i could acknowledge was…



“KEEP WALKING. KEEP WALKING. LOOK AT WHATS INFRONT OF YOU. DO NOT TURN. DO NOT LOOK BACK!” 



That was when i could see it… 


 Blinding white light. Straight ahead. This blinding white light. Straight. Straight. Look straight. 


“MAEVE!!! MAEVE!! I DONT WANT TO GO! LET ME GO, MAEVE LET ME GO!!” the shrill echoed through my body. There was no time for opting out, something is terribly wrong here, that is why all these people are barging one another. 


I acted on instinct and threw Aryan over my shoulder as he pounded his fist against my back, wailing and wailing. 


The crowd amongst us became more enraged, fighting each other and shouting. But my focus solely remained in front, despite whatever happened behind me - my focus was at the front. 



The light became closer and closer, the pushing from behind us became more intense, something that coursed this sickening, cold feeling inside of me. Running away from home, that feeling, only people that have ever done anything like that could really understand the emotions you feel. However, this was different. 


Then everything just clicked.


Silence.



My eyes lingered upon the unusual sight that was far beyond any human knowledge could really comprehend. 



All the noises from around me just stopped, the announcements and cries, the shouting and begging. It silenced. Like a gentle breeze wrapping each person’s worry and morphing it into a docile halt. 



“ALL PEOPLE;  DUE TO THE CURRENT INTERFERENCE THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE, TRANSPORTATION TO SAFTEY HAS BEEN PROVIDED; PLEASE GATHER ANY PERSONAL BELONGINGS AND BOARD; PLEASE FOLLOW ALL RECENT COMMANDS.” 





“MAEVE!!…MAEVE!!…NO!!…WE CANT GO!!…” Aryan cried but we had to board. 


The large metal door clashed onto the ground blaring the screams and making the ground beneath us shake. Heaps and heaps of people ran inside, i already knew. 



Part of me already knew that there was not enough space for everyone. So i did what i had to do, i pushed Aryan forward, i couldn’t see his gushing brown eyes, from the people in front of him, however i did hear his blood-curtling scream when he realised. And he just wailed my name, i didn’t like when i hear my name from other people but for some reason, it felt like warmth as soon as i heard it from Aryan. 


Then the door closed. And safety rose itself into the air, the engines roaring like rampaging lions on their next hunt, clutching onto my necklace as the colourless plane desended into the lifeless sky. 


I could tell from the weeping and yelling from passers behind me that we have to keep walking and walking.


It was only when my heart sunk in my chest. It was only when the heavy breaths and racing thoughts about what just happened came to an instant stop.


“ATTENTION; DUE TO THE RECENT COMPLICATIONS, PLEASE DO NOT TURN. PLEASE DO NOT ABOARD. PLEASE DO NOT STOP WALKING. PLEASE LOOK AT WHAT’S INFRONT OF YOU.”


Perturbation jittered every movement. Locking me into place with everyone else who seemed to be transfixed to the ground like a herd of deer, waiting for any signs of danger.


That was when my mind alerted me. Something that trepidation itself, hid amongst the panicked citizens behind me. 
From way above the grey clouds, the high-pitched, muffled screams became louder, as i realised it sounded like a mixture of people.
