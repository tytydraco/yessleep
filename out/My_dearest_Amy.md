My dearest Amy, I still remember the day we first met.  Our mothers had become acquainted via a shared and palpable love for shooting heroin.  Eventually, they had found solace in using it together. With both of them having young children, only a month apart in age; it came naturally for them to introduce us to each other.  We were 6 years old. I was sitting cross legged on the living room floor of our trailer home, with a wii remote in hand— staring blankly at the tv. Our mothers stumbled through the front door, and there you were.  You were attached firmly to her waist, but there was a palpable curiosity in your eyes when we first saw each other.

After a brief introduction, our mothers let us be while they went on to indulge their habits.  Being a 6 year old only child, I still remember how hesitant I was to interact with you. My eyes darted back and forth from you to the closed door of my mothers’ bedroom– with more paranoia than any six year old should ever reasonably have.  We both had the shared appearance of children that had been through too much for our age. our parents cared about us, but when both of them were spending more money on drugs than clothes, it couldn’t have been hard to tell.  We were wearing whatever clothes our mothers were fortunate enough to dig out of the donation box.  You looked at me with bright eyes and asked if you could play whatever game I was so fixated on. I remember selfishly looking down at the controller, and back up to you—and with an exacerbated sigh, handing you the remote.  I remember the way your eyes lit up. I remember how shamelessly confident in yourself you were and how much I admired that

After some time, your visits became more frequent, and we grew closer.  Seeing you once every two weeks slowly turned into two times every week— and with this sudden change, we grew close.  Neither of us were particularly rejects—- But we also weren’t a stereotypical definition of popular.  Growing up in rural upstate new york, our class had about 20 kids.  Most of them belonging to good homes, but still fortunately too young to realize exactly why we were so different 

When I was 8, my mother was arrested with me in the car.  Her and whatever druggie boyfriend she was currently with had decided to go on a heroin run in Schenectady.  I do not remember the specifics. There were flashing lights, men in uniform, and there was me clinging to my mother—It took multiple policemen to pull me off of her.  I stayed the night in a foster home while she was undergoing processing. It took all night for the police to get ahold of my father, who was now living on Long Island. The next day, he came to grab me and I lived with him for the next coming months. 

My father was a complicated man. He had fallen victim to his own habits, but was admittedly better at hiding them. It was an endless cycle.  Buy drugs. Run out of drugs. Get sick until you can afford more drugs– like an ouroboros.  You can only imagine how difficult it was for a young child to adapt to these changes and mood swings.  Eventually, I learned it was best to just keep quiet. I know it had to have been similar for you, Amy. 

In the months when I was under my fathers custody, I never saw you. The whole thing was a blur. I barely knew my father. I was always a bit of a mommas boy. Admittedly I cannot recall much from this time.

I do remember the first time I saw you after the previously mentioned events.  Mom was out of jail—and seeing that we were back at your house must’ve meant that it didn’t take long for her to fall right back off the wagon. It had been some time– but I recall how natural it felt for us to return to our old habits.  I suppose it’s easier for children. I hadn’t seen you for a while–and then we saw eachother– and just like that, it was like nothing had ever changed.  My mother was with your parents. They were in the bathroom, door locked.  I remember muffled conversations, moaning, groaning, and then blissful silence.  This was a common occurrence. You were always more aware of it than me.  You were confident, you asked questions. I was sheepish.  I knew that what was happening wasn’t right but it was easier for me to keep my head down than to pry. At least I had a friend to help me get through it 

And then there was the night your father overdosed.  Years had passed. My mother had found a new man. A good man.  My stepfather, Luke.  He had  a good job, a big house, and was always in love with my mother.  I used to call him “Uncle Luke”.  You can imagine the shock of a young child, suddenly being ripped from a dilapidated trailer and placed into the nicest home in town, with a caring and loving man that I could call my stepfather. I was upstairs, I was playing minecraft on my brand new xbox 360.  I remember the ear piercing scream my mother let out downstairs, I remember running down– and I remember my mother falling into my stepfather's arms.  She had just received the call. She looked at me through the cracks of his hands, tears in her eyes, and whimpered. She told me your father had died

It was only an hour after, that you and your mother had arrived. You were in a state of catatonic shock, as was I.  I was never close to your father, but me– a now 10 year old boy, understood the severity of the situation. I remember you didn’t cry, you were absolutely emotionless. We sat in my room, in front of my crt TV– And this time, I didn’t hesitate to hand you the controller. I let you do whatever you wanted. After 30 minutes, I broke the silence. You were playing minecraft, aimlessly placing blocks.

“What are you building?” I asked?

“Something that makes me happy” is all you replied.


Even more time passed, we both changed.  When you grew older, the trauma of your childhood had caught up with you. In the very beginning of our highschool years you had grown depressed.  You were drinking, smoking, and partying.  It was just you and your mother now.  She was clean, but also drinking, as was my mother.  We would still hang out.  Our mothers were still close.  I Had developed a passion for music. You would come over, and lay your head on my lap while I played guitar. We would make eye contact, between coughs and hits of a joint. We would lay like that for hours.  It was around this time I started to develop feelings for you

In the coming years, we would continue this on and off dance.  We were 16.  You would come over and stay the night, we would watch movies and smoke pot and kiss—I had completely fallen in love with you.  At this point you weren’t ready to pursue anything.  We would go weeks without talking but I still waited for you.  It was becoming clear that I was more in love with you than you were me.  This didn’t matter. I would wait, and wait, and wait.  I would hang on the edge of my seat every night and wait for a text or a call from you. Even when it became apparent that you were only using me as a convenience, I didn’t care.  Because the second you walked through my bedroom door, my heart would melt.  It was complicated.  We had been friends for so long. We had shared so much trauma.  You were nervous to throw that away for a relationship.  I wasn’t– I was ready.

It was now junior year of high school.  It had been two consecutive years of me chasing you, us hanging out off and on, you staying the night—and then me seeing you in school the next morning like nothing had happened.  I was still in love with you but it was becoming increasingly clear that you weren’t ready to be with me. You’d ignore me for weeks on end, and then you’d come over for a night, and I’d be right back in.  I loved you so much.  I couldn’t take the sleepless nights, the crying. Every song I listened to reminded me of you. I wanted more and YOU weren’t ready.

It’s now the summer of my junior year. We still see each other off and on but nothing has changed. I picked up a job as a dishwasher for the nicest restaurant in town. I needed some extra cash for weed.  It was a decent gig. 

One day, my boss approaches me and tells me that I'll be training a new girl.  She’s from the next town over.  My job was to show her the ropes–explain to her the fine and complicated arts of dishwashing.  She starts her shift an hour after me.  Her name is Avery.  She’s cute.  I showed her where everything goes, how to unclog the sanitizing sink, which was notoriously finicky–and after a couple hours, I realized we were laughing with each other almost the whole time.  It had been weeks since I'd last seen you, Amy, and at this point I was tired of the hurt.  So like the 17 year old doofus I so clearly was, I decided to shoot a shot with Avery.

“Hey, so like.  If one of us never needs to cover each other's shift, we should probably exchange numbers?” high, stupid idiot. 

But to my amazement, she giggled.

“Are you asking me for my number?” she chuckled

“Uh. yeah, well I guess I am.”

She gave me her number. It felt wrong, because I was still in love with you. But I couldn’t wait around forever.  

Weeks passed, I heard nothing from you– I was picking up shifts just to see Avery.  Now that we had a new dishwasher, I had been promoted to line cook, which I thought was pretty sweet. We would get stoned and listen to music in the kitchen, while I undoubtedly messed up everyone’s order.  It was around this time I had learned my mother and stepdad were going on vacation.  I would have the house to myself for the week.  I took this opportunity to invite Avery over. We had decided we were going to get some friends together, and party every night of that week–like any stupid teenagers would with a big house to themselves. I can undoubtedly say–that week was one of the best of my teenage life.  I still can’t think about pink whitney without getting sick to my stomach.  Avery was bold.  She was ready to pursue me in ways you weren’t Amy.  She didn’t hang me out to dry. After a night with her, I didn’t have to wait a month to hear from her again. 

We spent that week bringing friends over, listening to music, and dancing until everyone turned in for the night. She would take me upstairs–and well, you know. I felt like an adult. I felt confident in myself.  This was short lived.  Unfortunately, living in  small town upstate New York, word gets around fast. Everyone knew about Avery and I.  The end of my parents vacation was growing near. Avery had just gone home for the night, and my friends were passed out on the couch—or the floor, or wherever they could find a place to sleep.  I felt a buzz in my pocket.

It was you. 

“Have you been seeing Avery?’

I’m still drunk at this point. I still hold resentment for the years you hung me out to dry. It seemed incredibly ironic that you cared what I was up to now of all times.

“Yeah, I have.” I replied.

What followed were a series of texts about how hurt you were.  About how you did love me and how you just needed more time.  I suppose two years wasn’t enough.  

Me, still obviously in love with you, stewed for days about how to play my cards. Avery was sweet, she clearly liked me and wasn’t afraid to say it, like you were. She was going to college at the end of the summer, though.  We hadn't discussed at length how we were going to handle this when it came. It had only been about a month of us seeing eachother– and even then, we weren’t together. Even writing this now, I see myself rationalizing the choice I made.  I’m sure by now, it’s obvious the choice I made.  I still feel bad about it. I stopped talking to Avery. After a day or two she knew something was going on, and instead of being honest, I was cold to her.  I avoided her at work, and didn't respond to her calls until she eventually left me alone. I broke her heart. I still regret this.  

When I made my choice Amy, I made it clear.  I was not going to be dicked around anymore.  If I was to stop talking to Avery, you would be with me and not be afraid to own that.  You agreed to these terms.  Honestly it was just weird seeing you so ready to be with me after years of using me whenever I was a convenience to you.  I know now and I knew then that it was because it hurt too much to see me with another girl.  You weren’t just a girl to me though. 

We had gotten together just in time for the start of our senior year. We were in the same class, and the first couple weeks it was hard to ignore the prying eyes of our peers. Again, small town, 20 kids to a class. We’d all known each other since kindergarten.  Eventually it became natural, and we were just another couple. We finished our senior year, both barely graduating.  And you move in with me and my parents.  
We loved each other,  Everything about you was perfect to me. For two 18 year old kids, our love was mature, our fights were mature.  We had both been through so much, not just together.  We both understood more about the world than most people our age. After high school, we both got jobs.  She's a server at the olive garden, I work at a packaging facility for our local garnet mine. We spend every night together.  We go on dates, we go on long drives.  It felt so good to have you and know you were all mine for the first time. 

We’ve now been together for 2 years.  It’s time for us to start looking for our own place, but times have changed and local housing is hard to come by.  We opt to stay with my parents a little longer until we can get our funds a little more in order.  We would stay up, you would lay in my arms and and we would fall asleep watching shitty early 2000’s comedy movies—but this time, I knew you’d be here the next morning, and the morning after.  It was a good feeling.  We would still fight though, and that was becoming more frequent.

I think at about 2 and a half years of being together, you started to realize you may want something else. You were good at hiding it.  We would fight a lot, always about trivial things, our own insecurities.  She thought I wanted more than her, when in reality she was all I had wanted for 5 years now.  I thought she wanted other men.  Things went on like this for a while, both of us slowly growing unhappier–but I always knew that in the end I wanted it to be her.  I wanted to marry you, Amy. 

A month before our 3 year anniversary, you went on a trip to Canada with your best friend.  You were to stay for a week. You were going to go out to eat and go barhopping. We were both 19 years old, but the legal drinking age in Canada was 18, which you and your friend were excited about.  I was admittedly nervous.. I shouldn’t have been.  If our relationship was truly as perfect as I always had fantasized it would be, I shouldn’t have had any worries. We spent the night packing your bags.  I was going to miss you. You and your friend were leaving early the next morning.  When I dropped you off at her house that night, and I gave you a hug goodbye–Something felt different.  You were quick to say goodbye, you gave me a peck on the cheek and you walked away from me without so much as a glance over your shoulder.

Days passed, I barely heard from you.  It was the two nights before you were supposed to head back when I got the text

“Can we talk?”  This put an immediate pit in my stomach.

“Yeah, did something happen?” I replied

“Yeah. I want to wait to see you in person to explain.”
Immediately I am spiraling. I already knew.  The pit in my stomach had turned to a dizzy sensation accompanied by a shortness of breath. How could she expect me to wait 2 days to hear what she had to say? So naturally, I called her

“ you need to tell me what happened” I said, clearly sounding like I was on the verge of a panic attack

“I really don’t think it’s a good idea to tell you right now,” she replied. Her voice was reserved, calm and collected, but with a twinge of guilt.

I could barely breathe. 
“God damnit Amy, TELL ME” I was yelling at this point,I knew what was coming.

“I slept with someone”

I hung up the phone. My world was spinning.  I knew what was coming but hearing her confirm my suspicions in her own words sent me over the edge.  I screamed.  I cried.  I didn’t sleep all night long, and I didn’t care for an explanation.

I loved you, Amy. Countless dates, countless moments and inside jokes that were only between us.  I loved you YEARS before you ever even considered me an option.  You lived with me at this point.  I was sitting on the bed that WE BOUGHT and assembled TOGETHER.  None of that was even a thought to me at that moment. I didn’t speak to you until you arrived home.  Your friend was bitter, she wouldn’t say a word to you. She didn’t agree with what you had done. And when you walked into my room, you looked like you hadn’t slept in days.  

There wasn’t much of a conversation.  We both knew it was over.  You drove to the dollar store.  You bought cardboard boxes and tape and I proceeded to watch you pack years of our life together away right before my eyes. You had no choice but to go and live with your mother.  

I can’t sleep, I can’t eat. I am lying awake every night. I truly think you broke something in me.  You took your bed, you took your TV.  You fell out of love with me.  I was sleeping on my own floor with a blanket, pillow, and a handle of vodka.  

I was never much of a drinker, but after you left it was the only way to get to sleep.  I grew thin, and emaciated.  My parents and my friends were worried about me, but there wasn’t much they could do when I refused to get up off the floor–unless it was to piss or find more booze.  

I loved you Amy, so much.  It’s been months now. We haven’t spoken since.  Things weren’t getting better for me.  I never bought a new bed, I never bought a new TV—hell, i quit my fucking job.  I sold most of my guitars to buy more liquor, and I fell asleep every night staring at the ceiling, while the room spun. 

But then Amy, something  happened.  Truly nothing short of a miracle.  I woke up and something had changed. I realized that despite everything we have been through together– and all the individual troubles of our lives, that things can be okay.

I hear you’ve moved out to Canada. That guy must’ve really been something else. Truly I wish you the best.  There really isn’t much to gain from sitting around depressed all day, so I’ve decided to put in the work.  I’m going to better myself, in ways that you never could.  

I think I'm going to get out of here, things aren’t the same now anyways.  I truly never saw a point in living without you.  But It really does make me happy to know you’re doing better for yourself.  I did do some digging, Simon seems like a great guy.  He’s everything I couldn’t be.

Sometimes I lay on the floor and I wonder if things would’ve been better off for me if I had chosen Avery, if I had never given you the benefit of the doubt, if I had never loved you so completely. It doesn’t matter now.  Maybe I was always this broken. Avery probably would’ve found a way to hurt me in the long run anyways.  It’s okay.

I wanted to say thank you for all the good times, truly.  I can’t remember the last time I was happy like you made me happy.  And I will always treasure that.  You were everything I ever could have wanted.

My dearest Amy, I will always love you, and  I’ll see you very soon.
