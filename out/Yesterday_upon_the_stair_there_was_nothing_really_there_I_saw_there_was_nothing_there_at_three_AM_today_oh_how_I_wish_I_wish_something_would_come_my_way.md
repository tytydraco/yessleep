Yesterday, upon the stair there was nothing really there. I saw there was nothing there at three AM today, oh how I wish, I wish something would come my way.  
  
When I was younger, I was living my life on the edge. Growing up with alcoholic and drug-addicted parents, I didn't know anything much about anything other than the pure joy of intoxication. I was hooked on the spirit by twelve. Every day, something went wrong. My eldest sister killed herself by accident. My brother was shot right in front of me over a botched drug deal. I watched Pa sell Ma to other men for money to buy more booze he'd drown me in. Things went wrong every single day, but at least it was something.  
  
Then one day, I got clean; I got sick of being sick and tired and I got sick and tired of living on the edge so I got clean and I made something out of the nothing that I was. I turned my life around and made a career for myself, helping other people like myself. Eventually, I fell in love. At first it felt like I had made it, like I was on top of the world, but after we settled and got married and built a family, love did the worst thing imaginable.  
  
It gave birth to absolutely nothing.  
  
Gradually, then suddenly, I stopped finding any actual joys in life.  
  
Everything grew more and more mechanical, monotonous, and cold.  
  
Lifeless.  
  
Meaningless.  
  
Waking up every day felt the same until I stopped feeling anything altogether.  
  
A chasm of emptiness opened up, following me everywhere I went, swallowing everything around me until there was nothing.  
  
Waking every morning, I saw nothing of importance.  
  
Kissing my wife, and her lips tasted like nothing, and so did her food.  
  
Hearing my kids and their voices sounded like nothing.  
  
As did my own voice.  
  
Every day passed like nothing had happened because nothing ever did happen in my home town designed in accordance with the gloomy architecture of nothing.    
  
Every now and again, I would wake up drenched in cold sweat, fearing for some odd reason that something had happened. Nothing ever did, leaving me empty and distraught over the fact the Nothing was slowly and methodically squeezing the sanity out of me.  
  
Even when Pa passed away, I felt nothing. At his funeral I stood there, completely submerged in the emotional void of nothing as they lowered him into the ground. My eyes watered, but I felt absolutely nothing.  
  
Life just went on, as if nothing had happened, because nothing indeed ever happened.  
  
Even now, coming from work to the site of a catastrophe…  
  
To the pile of ashes that used to be my home…  
  
To find the scattered bone fragments of my family…  
  
After everything that was mine was reduced to nothing –  
  
even after something had finally happened, only nothing remains.  
  
When a police officer told me I should find some solace in the fact that the explosion killed them so fast they felt nothing, all I could say was;  
  
"Neither do I."
