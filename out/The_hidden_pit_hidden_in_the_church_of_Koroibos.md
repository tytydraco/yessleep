Given the name of the title, I was a devoted sorcerer of the Koroibos. Why I say 'Was'? This story will explain to you the reason I abandon the faith of Koroibos.

In the beginning, Koroibos created the universe, then the world, then us. In time, us humans have well adapted to the spiritual life. Humans have abandoned the lord Koroibos, which led to their fall unto Earth. Koroibos denies us from entering heaven, the kingdom to which will be our end. Soon, he grew pity upon us as we fear the world. He gave us a religion to connect with Koroibos. And so, begins an indestructible society, where humans have spiritual connections and gain powers of an angel. He once again allowed us to enter heaven. He too has granted us gifts to live upon society, but that is only the beginning of a new evil.

Many humans have rebelled against Koroibos. Using their own witchcraft and powers to murder the innocents and take their souls as energy. So, the faith of Koroibos are forced to fight and destroy the enemies of Koroibos, beginning a never ending war (The Rebel War). Many have spilled blood of their enemies, leaving every soldier to suffer a terrible nightmare. I cannot describe this nightmare, for it is terrible and will leave us sleepless.

The wars have not yet ended, even to this day. The men, women, and children of the faith of Koroibos never feared a terrible death, for Koroibos will protect and aid us from evil. For Koroibos is the one and only god.

Our society has been developing faster than ever, allowing us to do many things like never before. A new set of technology that can communicate from very distant areas, a variety of transportation, weaponry, homes, facilities, and many more. Yet, the enemy too have developed fast. How interesting and terrifying to realize they are catching up to our levels of power and intelligence.

When I was born, I was blessed with a gift to wield the powers of the galaxy, to which god chose me to wield. In years of studying and creating, I have encountered many of my own mistakes. Even though I repeatedly create mistakes, that does not mean I ignore nor forget them. I studied my mistakes, and I grow from them. Even when I am behind other sorcerers, I still stand to improve my abilities. They do not see me as their own, for they see me as a failure to the faith, you see.

Us sorcerers must attend to the church every day, for it is sacred and we must appear before the lord. The interior of the church always has a fountain at the centre, to display the beauty before the world. The sun light glitters stars upon the water. Flashing its holy light upon our eyes. I wished I could taste this water, but I am prohibited to thirst for it, for it must not be touched by the flesh.

Tall towering statues circled around the interior of the church, displayed near the walls. The statues are the heroes of the faith, who fought for the innocent, but also strongly capable of fighting an army on their own. It admires me so much. The most I admired was my teacher, Mother Malka, a great mighty sorceress who can annihilate on billions of powerful enemies. Her signature cast is the fallen angels; showering dozens of bright angels down unto the enemies, annihilating them with just one impact. She too is a great healer, the healer of God.

Before entering the church, a stranger approached me. He wore a dark dirt jacket, with a bright opal strap around from his left shoulder to his right hip. He wore dark blue pants I never seen anyone wear. And his caramel boots are strapped with black straps around the shaft. "Hey. What's this place?" His accent and use of language is alien to me, with a kinder smile. I would guess he's in his 20s. You will wonder how I am able to write what he said and how I wrote this language. Later, you will understand.

I do not know how to respond, for I do not understand. I said nothing, nor gesture. I just stand where I stand. In front of the church doors.

In a few seconds, he again asked. "So.... Is this like a church or something? I gotta be honest, this place kinda gives me the creeps."

Till the doors of the church opened, we are greeted by the priest. He wore a grand bright cloak, with a sacred cross strapped to his chest; a symbol of the faith. "Come in, sorcerers. The lord awaits us." I followed my colleagues into the church, leaving the stranger outside alone.

Every one of my colleagues wore the same uniform as mine. A dark black coat, with a pearl-coloured cross strapped on the chest. A short silky cape that floats of dreams. A dark ocean-coloured sweat pants, with a rose-coloured waist sash that adds to our dignity. And strong boots that matches the pants colour. Our necklace's holds a silver cross that dignifies our levels as sorcerers. That, which meant we are at the middle ranks.

As we stand by the fountain, A woman stepped out of the door in front of us. It was Mother Malka, wearing a pure holy white cloak, with a golden waist band that dignifies her ranks. Her face shined by the light of the sun. How pure and holy she looked before me.

"Today, we will sing us a sacred song to the lord. For we shall present our mornings with joy and holiness." Her lips moved so delicately when she speaks. Her voice echoed a holy sentence that comforts my soul.

After the song has ended, the light of the sun shines greatly upon the church, lighting the entire interior into a heavenly world. This means that God is pleased. A pure warmth clothed my heart, which made me smile and gaze upon the windowed ceiling, displaying the beautiful healthy bright sky.

"Now everyone, return to our class and start studying. We must not delay our progress." We begin to leave the church, gracefully. But I was stopped when my teacher lay her hand on my shoulder. "Dear Thomas Emery."

I turned to her, face to face. Her face made my heart pump with such admiration. I indeed wanted to be just like her. To be the greatest sorcerer and defender of our society. "Yes, Mother Malka?"

"Will you stay here for the night?" I do not understand why she asks me to stay in the night without studying. Does that mean she is testing me? Or is she expelling me from class?! "Mother Malka? Have I done something to upset you?"

She smiled and replied. "No, Thomas Emery. You have done nothing wrong. I just wanted you to stay here for the night. You will wait for my return and we will have a talk. Can you do that for me?" I am relieved to hear that. But I question. Why in the night? Does this mean she will teach me her secrets? Or is it something else? I cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong. Without questioning, I answered. "Of course, Mother Malka. I will await for you tonight."

And so, I am left alone in the church. The light of the sun narrows to the fountain, and so I sat with it.

From day to night, I have done nothing but gaze upon the statues. They looked royal and strong, holding their dignity with their history. The water reflected my image when I lay my eyes upon it. My eyes shared with the clouds of the galaxy. My long milky white hair dangles like curtains of a wedding. Looking at myself, I see struggle and confusion. I wondered what is beyond our world. I know there is heaven, but what is beyond heaven? That question leaves me to think for the rest of the hours.

As the moon rises upon the church, my eyes begin to close. I do not know how long I've been asleep. Until suddenly, the sound of weeping echoed amongst the church. Hearing the weeping from the ground made my heart sank. Not saddening. Disturbing.

I jolted awake from my boredom slumber. I looked around to see nothing. There was no one in sight. Upon seeing the statues, my instincts went high alert. They looked menacing, filled with darkness. I do not understand. Why must this happen? And where is that weeping coming from.

"Hello? Do you need help?" I asked, but no one answered. The weeping still lingers as I investigate around the church. I suddenly got this hint: If I walk to the entrance door, the weeping will be more silent. I circled around the fountain, trying to find any clues as to where it was.

To my fear, I realized, it was coming from below the fountain. I had this urge to call for help, but something about it makes me wonder. What is or who is weeping below this church? Did Mother Malka orchestrate this? Or is it something I cannot deem to question?

I raised my hands, readying myself to move the fountain. I understand that sorcery will be complicated for you. I do not mean by 'you do not know how it would look like' or 'you will not know how it works'. I trust that you would understand them. What I mean is how it works and feels from our souls. Our souls are a powerful structure, capable of doing anything. But the flesh prohibits us from our true potential. The soul is how we live, to have life. It is not that I am born with powers. It is that God removed parts of my flesh before I was born: In order to allow me to do sorcery.

You see, the flesh prohibits many of our special opportunities. We will not be able to comprehend what is beyond the flesh, for it will annihilate us into a puddle of blood.

Upon my hand, a bright axis blue sigil appeared upon my palm. I felt my soul attaching to the fountain as I move my hand slightly to the left. Truly, it is heavy as a boulder. I do not know how to explain this clearly to you all. I would say it is like cupping the waters with your palm. Each cast gives you a different water. One will be warm. Another will be cold. Then another will be too cold or too hot. And another will be painful. The painful will be like tasting poison or lava, and you will have to endure that pain. For if not, you will fail to cast.

This cast is no problem, for it felt like warm water within my soul's cupped hands. To my shock, a dark pit is revealed. I cannot believe it myself; I tell you. What sorts of mysteries lies beneath that pit? It seems the more I look deeper into the pit, the more I begin to fear. But I dare to know what secrets lay in the pit, and who is the one weeping.

We do not have stories about anything secretive in our society. The reason will be told in the end. You will understand, I trust you.

I float down into the pit, with a bright orange flame held on my palm. The cast's water is warm to my soul's cupped hands. Floating down into the pit, I felt like I have been going down for hours. How deep is this pit, truly? I do not know. Once I lay my foot on the floor, I began to walk deeper into the tunnel of the pit. The weeping echoed the tunnel, a terrible fear striking my breathe.

My journey into the pit has been rather troublesome and confusing. I would find carvings on the walls that do not make sense. Just what are these dark figures? They have horns on their heads, with eyes that blaze of hatred. Their faces are contorted into a mess of unholiness. Each of them have different shapes, colours, and sizes, depicting them as evil. I do not know what these are. And perhaps, maybe at the end of the pit, there'll be answers to this mystery.

What bothers me most is the last figure I see near the end of the pit. It was a tall centipede like creature, with a torso of a human. Its arms flails around, demanding for.... what? And its face is not like any other face I have seen in my life. Its eight eyes circled on its empty overshadowed face. The features of the eyes were realistically eerie, as if they were alive. It seems enraged. But why?

I dare not to look at it for too long. I begin to have these imaginations. Many are the faces of evil, with stretched smiles that defies everything in our reality. Their eyes sunken deep into their hollow sockets, distant from the light and hungry for our life. I do not seem to have imagine their teeth. In their mouths were nothing but the void. What truly terrifies to my soul is that they were ancient. I trust you understand this. And if not, please continue.

I heard a single footstep echo behind me. I immediately turned to see nothing but darkness. No light. Nothing. But I still couldn't push away the feeling that I'm not alone here. It is not god nor the people. It is something sinister.

Throughout my undergoing discovery, I realize the more I go deeper, the more feelings of fear crept into my soul. I have never felt this in my life. It left me alienated, as if I am in a different world.

Until, at the end of the hall was a rotten wooden door. The door, it holds something I cannot shake off. The weeping became worse, clear to hear in my ears from behind the door. I should be infuriated, yet fear and confusion overwhelms my senses. I have felt true terror as I stared, dumbfounded. This is a prison. But for what? And what lies behind that prison?

My mind demands me to leave and never speak of this. But for some reason, my soul demands to see the truth. To see what secrets lie behind The Faith of Koroibos.

With a single touch on the metal doorknob with my fingertip, a jolt of terror hits my body and soul. This terror made me retract my hand quickly like never before. "What is this?" I whispered beneath my breath.

I hesitated before touching the doorknob once again. This time, I did not hold back. That terror, it was not like anything I've ever felt. It was mixed with pain, terror, insanity, confusion, fear, madness, and many words I couldn't understand. The terror was suffocating my entire body, mind, and soul. Such terrible terror has existed that I question god's doings. Has he created this?

Twisting the door knob, the door opens. I immediately released my hand away from the doorknob for the sake of my sanity. I held my flame near my palm to see no scar. I felt something slide from beneath my nose. With a touch of my finger, I felt something wet. When I held my finger in front of me, I realized then that I was bleeding. I checked beneath my eyes to find drips of blood. What is this? Truly. And why did it exist?

When I saw what's behind the door, I became frozen to the core. The weeping had stopped, leaving only the cold dead silence of the void. Before me was another form of the interior of the church, but opposite. The towering statues are entities I never knew existed. They had this energy that can be described in one word. Evil.

At the centre was a well, eerily waiting for me to see what's inside. I started walking into the dark room. The ceiling above me was a mural of ancient history. The same figures from the hall are displayed upon the mural. They were beating on the humans. No, not beating. Torturing. And then, I saw a familiar figure. It was God.

I fell to a deep confusion as I stare at the mural over and over. I do not understand. What is this supposed to tell. Was there an evil we have not yet known? Is this our future?

"My dear Thomas Emery." That voice. I wish I never knew, but it was too late. I turned around to see Mother Malka, standing by the door, with the innocent smile on her face. She is a part of this mystery. This terrifying discovery. Was she hoping I would come here? But why?

"Mother Malka?! What is this?!" I can hear my own voice tremble as I asked. She raised her arms open and spoke. "This is what god has been hiding from the world, my dear Thomas Emery."

"What?! But why must hide this secret?! Why has God created this?!" I stepped back, only to be bumped by the well behind me. She stepped forward, embracing the darkness around her.

"Oh, dear Thomas Emery. You must understand. This is to make sure all humans will continue the cycle."

"What cycle?"

She grew a wide smile I've never seen her express before. It was as if she's overjoyed for the first time, and that terrified me.

"For many years, humans have been at war endlessly. The reason why the rebellion exist is because god made it happen."

"But that cannot be?"

"God separated every human on earth apart, creating the 2 nations. One is here, where we are all gifted with the power of his angels. And the other is being governed by Koroibos's right hand. God gave message through his angels to our nation, a message that there is a rebellion. The rebellion too are told by their governor about the existence of our land. They both found each other, and started the never-ending war.

"Even though billions have died, more have been birthed, continuing the war. Birth, war, death. A cycle that will never end."

Every word she spoke left me speechless. I could not let out a word.

"You must have heard that humans are able to return to heaven once again, correct?"

"Yes."

"That is entirely untrue. Heaven only belongs to he himself and his Seraphims. Heaven does not belong to us."

My heart shattered to bits, listening to what might truly be the truth. "Then, where else must we go?"

Her smile faded. Her eyes looked down to the ground. Could I have imagined she was looking down below the ground itself? Was she able to see what is beyond the pit?

"After death, we will be forced to go to Sheol. A plane where the souls will slowly forget their life and functions. Thus, their suffering begins when they forget everything. Screaming for air or life. It is neither. For they have forgotten to exist. They will live in constant confusion and fear, unaware of their existence."

I can feel my eyes widen, with the realization of terror unto death. "There must be a plane for salvation?!"

"Unfortunately, no. There are more alike. Stygia, Hades, and Heaven."

"I do not understand?! How must Heaven be connected to this?!"

"Oh, dear Thomas Emery. Heaven is only but a word to comfort the minds. It is not truly the heaven they interpret."

"Then what is heaven? And what are the other worlds?"

"Heaven is the throne of the one and only true god. To go to heaven will be a test. To see if they are worthy to be his disciples. But if not worthy, they will be sent to be recycled."

"And what is to be recycled?"

"To be reborn again. And again. And again. Until they finally submit to God. If not, they will suffer before rebirth.

"And the other worlds. Well, they are where the souls are forced to suffer for eternity. Their screams, pain, cries, laughter, they are the energy source to strengthen us angels to become the strongest warriors. That is the reason the war must continue, to become the dominant society of the universe. And do not worry, your powers do not come from them. You are something much more, my Dear Thomas Emery."

She stepped closer, much closer to me. Only a foot away perhaps. Her eyes locked to mine, freezing me from escaping. Her eyes radiate such heavenly glow, yet there is something dark within them.

I dare to say a word, but my voice was caught in my throat. Behind me, the sound of cracking bones echoes from the void of the well. I can feel its weeping growing behind my back, this time it is more terrifying than before. My muscles couldn't shake off my frozen state.

"What do you mean?" I muttered.

She cupped her warm-eerie hands upon my cheek, with a smile that triggered something in my mind. It is as if I knew this in the oldest of times. "You create the mistakes to experience the greatness of your journey. Without failure, without mistakes, there is no fulfilment nor experience. You have made mistakes and yet you still stand to achieve your values. That's why you're more than just a sorcerer.

"It is true you are not like any other sorcerer. They always succeeded without mistakes. And they never learn the true meaning of mistakes. They will not achieve their greatness. Instead, they achieve nothing."

"What do you want?" I muttered.

"I want you. To be my apprentice. What you're always meant to be since the beginning." I wished she said this elsewhere than here. If I've never found out the pit has existed, she would've told me differently. Instead, here, I am confronted by a terrible truth. If I am to be her, I'll have to accept this fate and become the enemy we never realized.

"No. I'm sorry, but no. I..." She shooshed me before I could say another word. Now, the weeping is close. Too close to me. A towering slithering figure overshadows us. The sound of cracking bones and mushing flesh sends my mind to a state of wild imaginations. I imagined its face in the darkness, with its eyes staring hungrily at my soul. The smell of rotten flesh twists my stomach to puke. When I looked at the shadow, its shape triggered a sense of familiarity upon my memory. Similar to the last figure of the painting. My voice box could not utter a word as the figure towers over us.

Mother Malka creeps into my ears and whispered. "Do not be afraid." And with that, the thing behind me shrieked ear piercingly loud that my ears begin to ring. At the corner of my eyes, digits of fingers start to wrap around me. A rain of wet oozing blood dripped on my head.

I never thought about my death. Never have I think about it. It seems that the concepts of death to others is rather distant, as if it is considered as an offense. Death can come in different ways. Peace, fear, self-hatred, unfortunate, pain, insanity. What happens after being consumed by something I do not understand? I do not know.

I never wanted this to be my end. But here I am. Being consumed by something terrifying. I dare to scream out loud, yet I could not. I wished I never come here, to never remember nor learn of this.

Then, something unexpected happened.

A beam of light darted at the creature behind me. It screamed in agonizing pain that broke me free from my frozen state. I realized I haven't breathed for so long that I took a deep breath. "What is this!!" Mother Malka yelled out. I looked to see the same man I encountered outside of the church.

He raised his hands forward, which calls for whatever weapon he threw at the creature. Until the weapon returns to his hands like thunder, I see what appears to be a spear like nothing the world has ever seen. He threw it again, the same beam of light thunders against Mother Malka. Her body sent flying backwards with the spear in such a thunderous speed.

"RUN!!" I immediately ran without hesitation. I dare not to look back, for if I slow down and get caught by its spindly arms. I do not need to turn back to know Mother Malka is still alive, for her laughter is enough.

As we both ran, behind us, I can hear the spindly legs of that creature pursuing us. How awful they sounded. It is as if I was in purgatory filled with violent warriors in the darkness without light.

When I looked at the walls, the paintings of the figures are different, much grotesque and nightmarish, same as the nightmarish imaginations I've been having. The many senses of fear, confusion, insanity, all are beginning to pull my soul apart. It is as if I was being tortured by the terror indescribable. Yet I still ran with endurance. It was survival.

At the corner of my eye, the stranger threw another spear to the ground. I don't recall him calling back his spear, but it seems he had another one. When we passed the spear, the creature's arms wrapped around me and started pulling me away. But suddenly a blinding flash of electricity emitted from the spear, stabbing into the creature which released me from its grasp.

Finally, we arrived at the start of my journey. I couldn't tell you how much I wanted to be in the light. I started flying up to the light when the creature screeched again. I looked down to see the stranger had disappeared, nowhere to be seen in the dark pit.

The light is getting closer as I reach it with my hands raised up towards it. In such shocking disbelief, above the edge of the pit, the stranger already escaped. He looked down at me, reaching his hands for me. His voice echoed through the pit. "Come on!! You're almost there!!"

Finally, I see the clear moonlight gaze upon my soul. I begin to reach for the stranger's hand. Without my knowing, a hand grabbed tight to my leg that I yelped. The creature was there, now pulling me down with all of its spiderly fingers. It screeches for my return, to return to my fate it has chosen for me.

I have never screamed in my life, but now, this is my first. It was this scream I've never thought I ever have in my soul. The stranger caught my arm and started pulling me back up. Both the creature and the stranger tug with such strength. I believe in the stranger, but the creature slowly gets the upper hand.

While the creature screeched, another voice came from above. The screech made the voice unclear for me to hear. "Rishika, Help me!!" As he yelled, sweat begins to pour out of his hands. My hands too are sweating. I can't tell you how much I am terrified at this moment. To slowly slip away from someone's hands into the deep dark pit, full of indescribable nightmares not able to comprehend.

Its hands are crawling to my face, they're terribly cold to the touch of my skin. Is this how cold it is in the void? Timeless, hopeless, mindless? I dare not know.

Another stranger appeared at the edge, pointing down a sharp long object never have imagined before. A bright sharp explosion came out of the tip of the weapon. Whatever it was, it zoomed passed me and made impact at the creature, which makes it release my grip and fall back into the pit.

I cannot believe what I have just endured.

The stranger pulled me out of the pit. He let go of my hand and lie on the ground with both arms spread out. "Thank god! We're alright." He breathed deeply while looking up to the moon. The moonlight became so beautiful to my eyes, much beautiful than before.

I took deep breaths of my own, taking in what I have experienced from my journey. "Thank you." I thought they would not understand, for they do not know the language. "Yeah. Your said it buddy." His breath still deep, regaining his comfort of his lungs.

I turned to look to another stranger, a woman wearing a caramel coat, with obelisk buttons aligned from top to bottom right. She wears void-coloured pants with a bell-like shape at the knees. The moonlight shined on her dark brown hair. When I looked at her eyes, the pupils turned and shifted, as if they were telescopes. She was staring into the void, looking for any sign of the creature.

She turned to face me with a warm smile. "Hey, you're going to be alright. It's not going to come back up again. I'm sure. My name is Rishika Belmont, and the man who saved your life, Geralt Chou." She was speaking in my language.

"Thank you, both of you. But we don't have much time. The world, everyone must be saved. We have to stop the war."

"We know. That's why we came here." Geralt said, as if he understood what I said.

"This is only the beginning. We don't know what they're planning yet. But we do know it's not going to be good." When I lay my back against the floor, the overwhelming sensation shock my whole body to a relaxation. Such a delicate sensation is it not? Lying in bed and drift into rest, a reward you've earned after all of your effort. To me now, the knowledge I have learned keeps me awake. What if that creature comes back? If it can leave the pit, why hasn't it done it yet?

Instead of staying in the church, we sat outside, watching the horizon. A bright sharp line of warm light coloured the surface of the land. I swear to you, I thought I saw the tormented souls rising up from the horizon. Their shadowy silhouettes flailing around, the wheats blown by the terrible wind near the ocean.

I can't believe it. My whole entire life was led to a lie. We, everyone, we've been taking part of this performance since the beginning. God didn't create us to be free and joyful. He created us as multiplying resources. Our souls are their power to consume and use it for....what? God and his disciples manipulated everyone into bloodshed for eternity. It is as if Koroibos and his right hand, whoever it is, created us as puppets for their amusement. To feed entertainment in their hunger.

Who was I going to be if I was to be consumed by that creature? Was I reincarnated to join God to conquer the world? To be a part of his disciples and feed the innocent on a rich dining table? Who was I before now? My past self, before rebirth, I have denied God since the beginning, the same reason I have now. I wish I was born different, never to be born here. But I am trapped in an endless cycle.

"Well, I'm terrified. We should head back home now." Geralt stood up with his hand in the pocket of his jacket. He pulled out a small model disc with 4 small rose-coloured buttons, aligned in a diamond shape. He pressed the button at the top side, a bell rang once upon that push. Shockingly, a bright oval shaped hole appeared in front of him.

"Hey. Who are you?" I turned my head to the left to face Rishika with hands on her hips. Her smile closely matched to Mother Malka's - except it the complete opposite. A smile with the quality of pure heart.

"I am Thomas Emery."

"We already know your name. I mean, 'Who are *You*?" It is shocking to know they know my name. But the question is more overwhelming. I looked to the rising fireball from the horizon. I am a sorcerer. But is that all I am? Just a sorcerer? Now my admiration was shattered, I come to a realization of myself. Such a unique question, yet I know not my answer. "I'm.... I do not know? Who.... But I am a sorcerer? Is that all who I am?"

Rishika's gloved right hand reached out to me, offering me some sort of choice. I look up to see the same smile. I stared at her baffled, until she broke silence. "Well, you coming or what?" This question was connected to a choice I must decide- a choice to change my life or to stay trapped with no power to be free.

I answered without word- taking her offer. "Well, looks like we got another member of the team. Welcome aboard, Tom." Geralt said. He stepped into the oval, disappearing from sights eyes. Nobody was here other than Rishika and myself. She pulled me up and she walked into the oval, disappearing.

Before I stepped into the portal, I turned to face Mother Malka, glaring at me. I froze, locked eyes with the disciple of God. "I will see you again, my dear Thomas Emery." Her whisper reached to my ears, sending chills coursing through my soul. I understand I cannot run away, but I can do more in this life.

I turned away and walked into the oval.

\-

This will be the end to my story, for now at least.

I've been going through terrifying missions with the team, but in those times, I get to visit extraordinary worlds. Unlike where I was born, nobody seems to have a god to depend on.

I've been a part of the team for 3 years, an experience I never thought would be given. Every world we visit blew my mind, watching the bright contrast of the fireworks. Over time, my soul begins to grow exponentially. It was shockingly exhilarating I tell you.

I heard news about entities going missing, even the sleeping man [Darwin Michigan](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13s6hmh/theres_a_universe_where_earth_is_filled_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) was after. And these entities come from different worlds. This could mean that someone stronger is using them... But for what? What bothers me is the guesses I have in my mind. Mother Malka is a part of this, could she? What else have she not told me about?

These questions will not be answered easily.

Before I end this, I want to tell you this. In some nights, when I fall asleep, I dream I was back at the hideous well again. Sometimes, I see the dark silhouette of the slithering creature rise from the well. I hear terrible whispers in my ear, demanding for my return. And sometimes, I saw Mother Malka rising from the well. And her smile stretched wider to the corners of her ears, revealing nothing but darkness within. I wake up with sweat over my head. And in some cases, I saw a shadowy figure dash away from my sight as if it was being pulled by a terrifying force.

I tried to forget about it, but it keeps returning no matter what.

One night, I received a papyrus letter I woke up to from my nightmare. This is what it said.

***You will soon embrace your destiny, for when the time comes, all will surrender to Koroibos, the one and only god.***
