Call me Jack. Jackass, jack of all trades, jackanapes, jack daniels, jackoff—all of those apply to me to some degree, but “jackal” is the closest to how I see myself. I’m a grifter and a con artist. Mostly online scams, but I used to steal cars pretending to be a valet, or get invited into McMansions in the guise of an internet provider. I’ve signed up plenty of wealthy older women to sponsor a child in need of books for school. I’m still in communication, actually, with a woman named Martha, who has spent years supporting little “D’Shawn” and putting him through junior high and high school. D’Shawn is starting college at Harvard in the fall. All thanks to her generous sponsorship. He sent her a very sweet letter with a picture from his high school graduation (culled from someone’s FB page—luckily Martha is not wise in the ways of the internet). She loves that D’Shawn cares enough to send handwritten letters!

But hey, sadly, poor Martha might not be getting letters from D’Shawn much longer because it looks like he’s going to meet a terrible, tragic end.

Said tragedy is the reason I’m writing this post. Truth doesn’t come easy to me—but I’m baring it all in the hopes that you’ll see my sincerity and that this isn’t some elaborate grift. What would I get out of it, anyway? I don’t need money. I’ve *got* money. Like the title says, I’ve got a million bucks!

… Well, minus about a hundred thousand I’ve already burned (in my defense, hiring a private jet and all those train and plane tickets were spendy, not to mention the assassins!)

Oh God. It sounds like I’m making this up. Ok. Let me back up.

Hi, I’m Jack. And I need your help.

Three days ago, a gorgeous lady contacted me online offering me a million bucks for a chance to hunt me. Yes you read that right.

I assumed it was some sort of scam. Her profile picture looks a lot like my catfishing ones—all curves and windswept hair and smooth buttery skin and have I mentioned curves? Legs for miles. You get the idea.

One thing leads to another and soon I’m agreeing to meet her in a CVS parking lot.

And before you say, Jack, seriously? She’s a scammer! *Duh*. But I mean, how else am I gonna learn what this new scheme is if I don’t play along? I’ve never heard of paying people to let you “hunt” them! And I mean, *obviously,* I’m going to take precautions and not give up anything (got nothing to give anyway—I’m so poor my pockets have holes in their holes!). But heck, if there’s some new way to grift people, Jack here sure wants to know it! Anyway the CVS has lots of foot traffic, so an in-person meeting is nothing to worry about, despite the high degree of weirdness.

There is *one* thing that sets my jackal senses tingling though.

It happens right at the end of our exchange:

**CoyoteWil3y:** kk, 10am CVS parking

**LadyBlood2023:** See you soon, Jack

I never told her my name.

Right, so. Obviously whoever’s behind this “LadyBlood” persona is a better hacker than I am, having somehow gotten my deets even though I keep all my accounts pretty anonymous. It’s never a good idea to walk into a situation knowing *less* about your opponent than they know about you. Essentially you’re playing an open hand, which unless you’re the dummy is a terrible way to play—you’re all but guaranteed a loss.

But since I don’t even know the game yet, I’m willing to suffer a loss in order to sniff out potential new opportunities. I make sure to get to CVS plenty early and browse the shelves while keeping tabs on the parking lot.

And then suddenly, she’s there.

She looks *exactly* like her photo: a slim dark woman in a flowing red dress, wavy hair, ombre sunglasses. Like a walking Prada advertisement.

My jaw drops to the floor.

In her hand is a silver suitcase.

“I’ll be damned,” I mutter. (Yes, damned indeed. An exclamation that, when I look back on it now, seems *hysteri*cally on point, heavy emphasis on *hysteria.* OH GOD I’M SO FUCKED.) *Ahem.* Sorry. Okay, back to the story. I head out to meet the mysterious lady in red, mostly thinking dumb thoughts about how I shoulda got a haircut ‘cause I look a mess. Good thing I have a hat. Hats are sexy, right? Haven’t shaved in days and normally I like the scruffy rascal look but she’s so *classy* I wish instead of bristles I had a proper goatee—I mean, been on T how many years and the best look I got is unshaven coyote? And oh, golly, she’s turning this way!

She flashes a brilliant white smile. “Jack.”

“Lady.”

And obviously, she’s a paid actor. Gotta be. Still, very effective—even knowing she’s here to make me believe in whatever scam this “hunt” is, I can feel myself wanting to come to heel and wag my tail.

She invites me into a nearby camper to look over the contract, and I hesitate a fraction of a second, my jackal sense tingling. But curiosity gets the better of caution. The lady and I sit at the small table inside. The RV has the fresh new smell of a rented vehicle. No personal touches. It strikes me that it’s been rented solely for the purpose of having a private space to meet with me. *Very* elaborate. Kind of a lot just for her to approach a small-timer like me. This should set off red flags, but I’m still too intrigued by the suitcase and, let’s be honest, those curves and the way she fills out that dress in all the right ways.

She opens the suitcase so I can see the cash inside.

It’s the cash that catapults me from what feels like the real world into the surreal.

It is actual cash. The *smell* of actual cash is pretty distinct. I feel higher than if I’ve just inhaled coke. The bills are not counterfeit—I’ve dealt with counterfeit. My instincts are usually pretty good at telling me what I’m dealing with. Right now those instincts are telling me that not only is that million dollars *real*—but that I should get the hell out of here.

But oh, that’s a lot of money. And I’m *so* curious.

She passes over the contract.

I skim it, look at her to see if she’s kidding, and then read it again, and again. By the third time I have it memorized.

It’s exactly like she messaged me about. She pays me one million dollars to hunt me. If she catches me, she will end my life. There’s no small print around it or anything. It’s right there. But if I can evade her for two weeks, I’m off scot-free and get to keep whatever’s left of the million that I haven’t spent.

What’s more, there are heavy restrictions on how she must conduct the hunt. No drugging or poisoning me, no restraining me via ropes, handcuffs, locks, traps, etc. I must always be free to move unhindered. She may not kill me in my sleep or by stealth. Before any assault she must make sure I am aware of her approach. Only *she* may conduct the hunt—no surrogates or assistance of any kind. She may not use any weapons against me, only bare hands. It’s a list so restrictive as to render me virtually unkillable.

I almost laugh. “What is this?”

She smiles. “The rules of the game.”

I just look at her for a moment in disbelief. And then at the money. That cool million.

I whistle, considering the money, and then her. I mean, even in “The Most Dangerous Game” the wackadoodle hunter uses a gun. She’s tall. A bit taller than me actually. But slim. I assess her up and down and decide ~~she can wrestle me anytime~~ I can probably take her if it comes to it. Actually might welcome the physical tussle—

*Ahem*. I decide her terms are fair. I mean, not really fair. *Crazy.* But come on, what’s she gonna do? Scratch my eyes out?

Well—her polished nails are pretty sharp. Eyeing them, I slightly reassess and decide I’ll wear glasses and a thick jacket.

But then. Yeah, sure. I can take her.

Bring it, Lady.

I’ve just signed the dotted line when she grips my wrist—oh, *hello.* She smiles. I smile. Her thumb rubs the inside of my wrist and it’s—oh, it’s very nice. She licks her lips. Then her thumbnail lightly grazes my skin, and then suddenly *digs in.* I yelp, trying to jerk back, but the Lady is surprisingly strong. She holds my wrist and tells me to give her my other hand, which I do (what can I say? I’m a puppy dog when a lovely lady bosses me around. More please.) She presses my thumb into my bloody wrist and then my thumb to the paper, right next to my signature.

Ok. Weird. Kinky.

Is it bad I like it?

Then she hands me the suitcase. “I’ll give you a twelve hour headstart, Jack. Don’t disappoint me.”

“I just have to keep out of your reach for two weeks? That’s it?”

She smiles. “I’m a real good hunter, Jack.”

“What if I *want* you to catch me?” I say, flashing her a flirty smile.

Her stare turns flinty in an expression I can best call… predatory. “Well… let’s just say none of the others liked it very much when I caught them.”

“Others?” I say. “Oh, so you’ve played this game before?” I’m not sure if I’m worried or disappointed. “I was hoping I’d be your first.”

“Oh.” She laughs. “You’re *far* from my first, Jacky Boy.”

Mmkay, she’s definitely flirting now. “How long did it take you to catch these previous… contractees?”

She leans her chin on her hand, pouting. “Twelve hours.”

“Hah.” I smile. “Well. I think I can do better than that.”

“I sure hope so, Jacky boy. It’s why I picked you. You’re clever. Rarely caught. And when you are, you just disappear and reinvent yourself somewhere else. It’s worked well for you until now. But Jack… I already know all there is to know about you. I did my research. So. Don’t be lazy about it. Give me a challenge, please.”

Is it bad that in the moment, I almost want to *let* her catch me? Just to see what she’s going to do to me?

Oh I regret it now… Lord help me, but how deeply I regret it now… past me was such a total fucking idiot.

\*\*\*

Easy Street.

That’s what past me thought. All I have to do is vanish for fourteen days, right? Simple. I book a ticket to New Orleans. Fly there in the first twelve hours. Once there, buy a fancy new car. Then it’s a question of where to go. A glimpse of a *Where’s Waldo?* book in a bookstore window gives me an idea—where better to vanish than into a crowd? I purchase tickets to Disney World (heck, *all* the worlds. Why not? I’m a millionaire!) under the name D’Shawn since it’ll make a good letter for Martha later—Disney, Busch Gardens, Universal—the whole magical package.

D'Shawn is very, very excited.

As for the Lady—I’m not worried about her. Why should I be? How’s she gonna find me? If she traces the plane ticket, plus the other breadcrumbs I seeded around New Orleans, she’ll wind up at one of several hotels with reservations under the name “Jack,” (hey, she did say to make it a challenge). I’m only on burner phones and sent my GPS and original phone off with a fake Jack I paid to check in at one of said hotels. I mean, I kinda doubt she’s gonna go through with it—but if she *does* fulfill her wackadoodle bargain, she’ll kill fake Jack (sorry, buddy).

And for a couple days, D’Shawn lives it up.

First time experiencing a theme park. First time at a five-star resort. First time feeling that Disney magic and whoa, *really* hard not to steal stuff but D’Shawn has got Harvard to think about (ok, he leaves a couple of stores with swag plus a giant-sized Stitch stuffed toy—can’t help those sticky fingers. But he gives Stitch to a tiny toddler whose bright smiles make his day!)

And the roller coasters! Such stupendous roller coasters! As a roller coaster virgin, D’Shawn absolutely hates them the first six times at Busch Gardens, but he’s determined to satisfy his inner child who never got to ride them and by the seventh try, he finally loves them.

He plays the bottle toss, a rigged game designed to rip off parkgoers. But because he has literally a *million* bucks, he can buy so many buckets of rings that he forces a win through sheer statistics and is awarded a giant stuffed tiger and doesn’t even have to cheat.

It is the best day of ~~my~~ D’Shawn’s life.

Definitely gonna write Martha about this.

\*\*\*

After devouring an entire bucket of churros, I decide it’s time to let D’Shawn ride one more coaster (despite the peril of being so full of sugar and soda) and climb into this giant monstrosity with an interlocking double loop. Everyone screams.

The soda and churros stay down. Barely.

I’m on my way out when I see pictures up at the store of all the people screaming on the coaster. Automatic cameras snap these photos for each group. I scan them, looking for a face that might pass for D’Shawn’s so I can send it to Martha. But then my eyes catch on a scruffy twenty-something—his hands thrown up, wild hair needing a trim, dark brown eyes wide, his smile huge and exposing that one missing tooth I could never afford to replace (it’s the reason I smile crooked). I almost don’t recognize myself I look so happy. But then…

Looking closer at the picture, I squint.

And then I go inside and buy a copy.

My heart rate has escalated just a little bit. I try to ignore the thumping as I walk right out of the park. I was originally planning to head to Universal, but instead I find myself meandering along the City Walk, that touristy strip of restaurants and shops lining the water. Families with children wander past me, laughing, arguing, chatting. The Hard Rock Café is packed, countless voices mingling in happy babble. I tune all of it out, still looking at the picture.

In the row immediately behind me on the coaster, in a red tanktop and with her face serene, as unruffled as if she were sitting for tea and not in a coaster moving at 70 mph, is the Lady.

It can only be her.

She’s looking right at the camera.

*Right*, I realize, *at me*. As if she anticipated I’d buy this picture and wants me to see her *watching*.

“Jack.”

Ice trickles down my spine. My intestines wind into knots as I turn.

She sits on a bench on the boardwalk, wearing the exact same red tanktop as in the photo, and a red miniskirt. Her lips curve in a smile, but her eyes have no light in them.

“Wow! Lady!” I feign the biggest smile. “Uh, fancy meeting you here!”

It’s the first time I feel genuinely afraid of her.

“You’re not trying hard enough,” she says, pouting.

“Well… I did hire a fake double and leave a trail for you to follow… in New Orleans.” I pause. “How did you find me?”

“You need to try harder,” she says, more seriously now.

“So… what happens next?” I look around the crowded City Walk. What’s she going to do, murder me in full view of all these bystanders? The entire horde of folks at Hard Rock? The kids throwing bread at the seagulls? I smile at her my most winsome, apologetic smile. “I’m afraid I already blew the money. Disney’s expensive. So were all those decoys I made for you. So… I can’t give it back, I’m afraid.”

“The money’s yours.” She stands, hands held demurely in front of her, those long red nails clicking slightly as she pulls her fingers together. “Is this where you’re making your last stand?”

“Last stand? I mean… you’re not really… going to make a scene in front of all these… kids and families?”

She only smiles. It strikes me, suddenly, that her lipstick looks very much the color of blood.

“Okay,” I say. “Um… how about I… maybe hide better this time. You’re right, I wasn’t taking you seriously enough. This time though, I’ll use my *very best tricks* to make absolutely sure you can’t find me. How about it? I *do* want you to get your money’s worth.”

She clicks her tongue. “… very well.”

“Great. Welp. Bye then—"

“But Jack?”

I stop as I’m retreating from her.

“Next time I catch you, I’m going to take something from you. You’re not taking this seriously enough. You’re a fox that thinks I’m just playing a little game, that we’re friends and all this is just for fun. But for you, it’s not. I’ll have to show you my teeth.” She flashes a grin.

I squint. “Aren’t you showing them now?”

She just laughs.

I swear her teeth look pointier.

\*\*\*

Disney World was, in retrospect, an easy guess. Give a guy a million bucks and let him go anywhere in the world? Where else is he gonna try to get lost in a crowd while throwing money away? It was too obvious. So for my next disappearing act, I decide to swing to the opposite end of the spectrum and go completely off grid.

I drive around the coast until I find a guy with a houseboat. Boat’s not even for rent. I flash some cash and rent it from him. Drive the thing along the coast and spend a couple days living that boat life. See some dolphins. Feed some seagulls.

It’s not bad, actually. Plus there’s no cameras, no traffic lights or tolls or witnesses or much of *anything.* Heck, even an actual bloodhound couldn’t find me because I’m out on the waves. And after two days of quiet, I start to relax. I even go for a walk on the beach and look for shark’s teeth. I’ve made sure to avoid all the touristy popular spots. I don’t even think this beach has a name. Or if it does, I don’t know it (and if *I* don’t know where it is, how is *she* going to find it?). I have a bottle in my hand and drink from it occasionally, the light buzz of my cheaply-made lukewarm pina-colada a poor man’s version of the five star drink I’d be getting if I were still at the resort. But hey, I tell myself, the sea is the same sea and the waves are the same waves—

“I agree.”

“Wha—”

She comes right out of the water. How she heard me muttering to myself under my breath when she was hiding *under the waves* I have no idea. How long has she been lying in wait at the shoreline? Was she holding her breath? Did she have a snorkel? Fuck, how did she even find me here, at this beach? A mile or so up the shore? A mile or so away from… the boat…

Fuck.

In my windbreaker I’m carrying a gun (sooo easy to get in Florida. I bought this from a kid who, I swear, was like thirteen.) I pull it out, intending only to threaten her away, but suddenly she’s running at me and my brain goes into fight or flight and I fire—why the hell do I fire? At an unarmed woman? The bullet doesn’t even graze her—the shot goes wide—then she’s disarmed me and the cold barrel of the gun is at my temple. It’s so fast. So ungodly fast. I wait for the *BLAM—*

But no, she tosses the gun aside, *smiling,* and then she grips my arm.

I shriek.

Holy Jesus her *claws!* They’re tearing—oh god oh god oh GOD! And then my arm is flopping limply because she’s torn *something* Jesus Christ so much blood! Is it possible to die from pain? I’M GONNA DIE FROM PAIN! Oh God let me faint! And all the while the small clever jackal part of my brain that is always figuring out the next move whispers, *What can tear a human arm like that? Look at her shadow…* And it’s true, there’s something wrong with her shadow—it doesn’t match her movements. The claws are the shadow’s, and the absurd idea comes to mind that *she* is somehow only a projection, like a profile pic, and the shadow is the real hunter that has just torn open my arm and is *hungry* and, worse than hungry, *bored*—

*“You’re not trying hard enough, Jack…”*

“Fuck me,” I gasp.

And then I’m on my back, the gritty sand warm against my skin and the sky spinning above me. Oh, the Florida clouds are so beautiful (Stop! Jack, Jack! Get it together!) But my alcohol addled brain is spinning the world like a top. I squirm but she has me pinned, her hot breath on my neck. And as terrified as I am, the touch of her skin almost melting into mine is so very, very warm and it’s such a confusing cocktail of emotions for my inebriated brain. I really can’t think. Her lips part. She leans down as if she’s going to kiss me. I feel the prickle of her shadow-claws on my bare skin, on my chest, and her soft lips press to the skin of my neck and oh no it’s not a kiss, she’s about to rip my throat right out—

“Hey! What’s going on down there!”

In a flash, she is gone. There’s a splash.

A scolding old man runs breathless across the sand, his lobster-red, sunburned skin wrinkled and scaly. Not my favorite beach buddy, but in that moment I could’ve kissed him! Tongue n’ all! Hell, c’mere buddy!

“What the *fuck* are you doing?” He steps back when I try to lean up to him (I’m not sober, okay?). “This is a public beach you know. You can’t go around doing indecent stuff,” he grumps.

“I completely agree thank you SO MUCH for pointing that out to me,” I gasp. “Seriously, thank you.”

“Where’d she go?” He looks around, perplexed.

“Hell. I hope she stays there.” I fall back into the sand.

“Wha—what happened to your arm?” gasps the old man.

“S-shark attack,” I manage.

Need a better plan. A much better plan. Gotta run—harder, better, faster, stronger.

The old dude helps me to my feet. I stagger with him up the sand, glancing over my shoulder to look back once at the shore. She stands in the water and raises an arm and waves.

I try to give her the finger but it’s weak. I know it’s weak. I’m weak. I wasn’t ready for this.

And yeah, it’s clear to me now that I fell for the oldest trick in the proverbial book. That I fell hook, line, and sinker for the pretty face in the red dress that’s all just that shadow thing’s version of a catfishing profile pic—and I’m a fucking idiot who, frankly, has pulled the same trick enough times I should’ve seen it coming.

And now I’ve got Lady Blood(Hound) from Hell on my heels. But this jackal has got teeth, too. So yeah. Those assassins I mentioned? Well. What else do you think I’m going to do with a million bucks? But it’s not going to be enough. I already know it’s not enough.

And that’s why I’m posting here. I’ve got a pretty unusual problem, gonna need a pretty unusual solution. So… how do I escape? How do I make it out alive for seven more days? There are no bad ideas here, folks. And I’ll pay back anyone whose plan keeps me alive, with whatever money I have left. So please. Please, please, please.

For God’s sake, [help me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
