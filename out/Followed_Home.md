Ok, I'm now officially freaked out.

Went to Walmart last night for my favorite ice cream. Left there around 10:30. Driving home a car came up almost beside me, but didn't pass.

I saw a bus loading in front of me, waited to see if the guy would pass me or let me over. Ok, moved in front of the car, noticed one of his headlights was out and got back in my lane after passing the bus.

Turned onto the next street I needed and when I put my signal on to turn into my subdivision, I noticed the same car again.

Weird, this is a small subdivision. Not too weird, just unusual. But I got a BAD feeling and went past my house and turned right. There's another street a block down that connects back to the main I just left. If he doesn't follow I can feel silly.

HE FOLLOWED!! WTF?!?! All the way back to the main road.

WTF WTF WTF Turned left and immediately turned on another cross street in the subdivision across from mine. He followed.

I took the next right. He followed. Right again and I was back to the main street again, between the street I live on and the other one I used to cross to the other subdivision. The streets are staggered, you have to use the main road to get from one subdivision to another.

He pulled behind me while I was waiting for traffic and put his turn signal on to go left.

I turned right and turned left back down into my subdivision.

HE FOLLOWED ME AGAIN!!

I'm past freaked out and tried calling my roommate. No answer, ack, he must be asleep.

Turned left past my house again and went back to the main road.

Turned right this time like I'm going back to Walmart. Got in the left lane and the guy followed in the right, never going past me - even though I drive like the old lady I am. I got in the left turn lane at the next light. Turned left on green and he crossed all the lanes and followed me again!

I called 911, beyond freaking out. I was telling the operator about the guy following me for the last 15 minutes, but he turned right at the next light while I kept straight.

I turned around and asked for a deputy to meet me at home. I gave the Sheriff deputies the story and told them where I'd last seen the little dark car with one headlight out, but I doubt they would have much luck. With a crappy description like that? But if anyone goes missing they will at least have a clue.

I have NO idea why anyone would do that to me. I'm not pretty, I'm not rich and I weigh two hundred pounds at five foot four, I'm fat. My van is 10 years old, dirty and has green mold along the top. No markers you would expect a person to want to stalk me. But that car followed me back and forth through two subdivisions. WHY?!?!
