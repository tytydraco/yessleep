Hey guys. Uh, season’s greetings? Merry Christmas? Happy Fest- man I don’t know. I’m not gonna lie, I think December’s going to be ruined for me for the rest of my life. There’s just something missing after [last year’s battle for our lives](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zuj3sf/every_year_on_christmas_eve_my_parents_drug_us_i/).

  
Some of you guys wondered what happened after Christmas last year. SOME OF YOU (who I’m not going to name) asked if I’m watching It’s a Wonderful Life again this year. Listen, I vote for A Christmas Story EVERY YEAR and I am outvoted by three. Of course I’m watching it again. I also volunteered to take my ‘magic pill’ early but I was also outvoted on that. To be honest, the vibe is just different this year. A lot changed. Nothing feels quite the same, even if my mother’s working overtime to keep it that way.

  
Going back to last year, I took the longest sleep I have ever had, and none of us got together for our usual New Year’s smoke. We were all just kind of happy to pretend things were over, even if we could tell they weren't. For one thing, my mother's flower shop had every event for the end of the year canceled in just a couple days. Ella's mother had her first two week of January showings canceled in about a day. But the rest? That's a long ass story.

  
And for anyone else wondering, this year’s pajamas are reindeer in ugly sweaters. I’m just grateful they don’t have feet.

The first warning shot that shit was about to hit the fan was the closure of the button shop.

  
Now yeah, under most circumstances a decades old store dedicated solely to selling buttons that doesn’t even have a debit machine closing down would probably be considered normal, maybe even expected, but in my little town? Ye Olde Feed ‘Em to the Christmas Spiders small town Canada? Where the mayor literally tried to call an emergency last year when the tree in the town square turned brown? That’s called a death knell; and it freaked all of us out.  
“What are the odds that she just died?” Greg questioned, then visibly winced when we all turned to stare at him. Max had spotted it first, calling us downtown to come gawk at the papered over windows. “What? Old people die, right? Right? Come on! Guys!”

  
We were already crossing the street, trudging through the slush. Honestly, I didn’t blame him. I’d been doing my best to pretend to ignore the whole ‘our town has a deal with something supernatural’ situation. We’d done our best, done our time, and now it was April. The town hadn’t exactly ‘flourished’ since Christmas but it hadn’t exactly imploded either. But the giant red ‘closed’ sign on Mrs. Alps’ Button Emporium suggested that something had shifted, and it made me itchy. I wasn’t stupid enough to believe that the problem was actually resolved but like I’d said when I talked to you guys last year, I was tired, I’d barely slept through most of 2022, and I was just done with the Christmas spiders. At least for a while.

  
What else do you do after battling four-legged twinkly monsters on a rooftop but sleep and try and ignore things? My biggest concern after that night was covering our tracks and making sure Rosie’s family heard about her death. Thankfully it snowed so heavily that it literally covered our tracks. Not that I didn’t get questioned by the police. After my ‘let’s burn the tree’ incident, my family’s door was the first they knocked on for something suspicious. Not about the Smiths’ house mind you. Nope! Somehow the smoking husk on our street didn’t warrant as much attention as the idea that maybe I’d poisoned the Christmas tree in the town square. The only reason I got out of that conversation was a quick, hushed talk between the officers and my parents and the rattle of a pill bottle. According to my folks I was ‘asleep, waiting for Santa’. Right.

  
“I don’t see anything,” Ella announced with a disappointed sigh, standing on a tipped over crate and trying to squint through a crack in the paper.  


“Nothing here,” Max grumbled, kicking the building a little and then looking suddenly hopeful. “Hey, what about your mom? Doesn’t she have access to a lot of the buildings in town?”  


She shook her head and hopped down. “She does residential only.”  


“Oh right, that Carl guy that your mom hates does commercial, right?”  


Yeah, somehow there was not just one realtor, but two competing firms in a town with almost no property for sale.  


“Nothing back here! But man is it gross and cobwebby... Yuck!”  


The three of us shared a look and went to find Greg who’d gone searching around the building. We found him trying to wipe off a clump of spider webs in the alley, attempting to smear it onto the faded brick wall.  


“Ew.” Max shuddered, making a face and keeping far away from him while I looked at where he’d touched, and then crouched down for a better view.  


“Hey guys… Look.” A quick peek and we all started to shove, pushing the rusted out dumpster just enough to reveal an old exhaust vent. It went right into the Button Emporium, and it was caked with webs. So was the wall actually. If you stood back and looked from vent to roof, the webbing fanned out like a cheap Halloween display, hanging off the brick and sticking to the back door where Greg had been… “Wait were you trying to break in?” I asked suddenly, shocked. He shrugged.  


“I started watching this YouTube channel where this guy cracks open safes! Figured it might work here.”  


“Did it?”  


“Nope!”  


“Did you try just turning the knob?” Max asked, giving the door a little push and using his cell phone as a flashlight, shining it inside the dark hall. “Gross.”  


We all gathered outside the door while Greg furiously worked his phone. You could see the cracked linoleum, old shelves and faded yellow wallpaper. Boxes were still stacked in corners. It looked like the storage area of the Button Emporium, except it looked like a smooth tunnel of webbing had encased everything. “Found it!” Greg just about yelled, thrusting his phone into my face, then Max’s, and finally jamming it into Ella’s nose. “Funnel-web spider! My cousin got his ass bit by one last year!”  


“Would you stop that!” Ella hissed, shoving him away as I stared transfixed into the hollow core. It was like one of those incredible displays at a fancy Haunted House you’d see somewhere like Hollywood. “Hayden? No. We’re not going in there!” I pulled out my lighter, snapping it open and holding it out until I hit one of the cottony edges. It lit up in an instant, and I took a step back as the webbing continued to ignite and spread in one big orange wave. I swear we all held our breath for a moment, watching clumps hit the floor and dissolve.  


“Okay that was cool,” Max breathed with a grin when the show seemed to stop, shining his light around and then stepping through the doorway. “I don’t like, see anything moving!”  


“Here’s hoping there’s no giant tunnel spider.”  


“Funnel,” Greg corrected her as we all stepped inside, quietly shutting the door behind us.  


If this was any other store I would’ve worried about security cameras, but Mrs. Alps wasn’t exactly known for her dedication to technology. A few years back she’d started walking around with one of those fall alert buttons, and everyone was amazed her daughter had managed to convince her to use that. There definitely wasn’t a secret alarm just waiting to trap us. There was, however, an incredibly large amount of buttons. Buttons everywhere! Buttons on displays, buttons in bags on wire racks, buttons in boxes and buttons… just buttons. A lot of buttons.  


We looked around for a bit, noting that in every room there seemed to be a new coating of spider webs. I pushed the cash button on the register, watching the drawer pop open, still filled with money. It was odd, and I looked around the place before watching Max take a seat on a dusty stool. I could’ve sworn the shop had been open just a few days ago. It wasn’t exactly a big town. If you wanted to get anywhere or do anything you usually had to pass through the downtown. Most of the stores had little chalkboard signs they put out on the sidewalk. It would’ve been noticeable if she’d started running closing sales.

“It’s weird, right?” Max asked finally, clearing his throat a little. “Like… this place looks like it’s been closed for years. But… I’m *pretty* sure I saw it open, like, yesterday.”  


Ella came up beside me and peered in the register. “It’s still full? If she closed the shop, why wouldn’t she take her money?” She rifled around a bit and then elbowed me, picking up a couple of coins. “They’re all… dirty.” Some of the coins were almost unreadable they were so filthy. I picked up a nickel and rubbed it between my fingers, a black residue flaking off. “I think its soot,” she practically whispered, before quickly dropping them back in the little slots.  


I picked up a twenty and looked it over. It seemed almost moth-eaten. “Aren’t those made out of plastic?” I wondered, flipping it over a couple of times before stuffing it back in and checking the others. Every coin was blackened and every bill was filled with holes.  


“I think we should go,” Greg mumbled, bouncing a little on his heels and looking around nervously.  


I meanwhile couldn’t leave well enough alone, and started lifting the cash drawer to peer underneath. The moment I got it up even a few millimeters a cascade of tiny black spiders poured from the bowels of the machine, and I let out an embarrassingly pitchy scream. I dropped it, coins bouncing while Ella rolled herself over the counter and we all made a scattered run for the exit.  


We all danced around outside, smacking spiders until we were ‘positive’ that they were gone before Greg abandoned ship, darting down the alley. “I’m not getting in trouble again!” he barked over his shoulder, stomping off while I tried to catch my breath, viscerally aware of what had just been crawling on me.  


“Oh come on!” Max cried out, rolling his eyes and following after him, giving us a dismissive wave. “I’ll deal with him. Let’s meet up this weekend!” He made a smoking motion and then grinned.  


“And I’m supposed to be the moody one, right?” Ella muttered, zipping her jacket up a little tighter and shuddering one last time before trudging forward. “Hayden?” She stopped, doubling back and grabbing my arm, pulling me out of my trance. “Come on, if my dad finds us here we’re in deep shit, let’s go!” I couldn’t help it though. Looking down at the vent, I swore I could see a black shadow writhing within the cobwebs. It was like they were watching us.  


&#x200B;

A few days later, we’d dusted off the usual stumps and found the Rona bucket that had rolled into the forest. Max dug out his special box and was merrily rolling up a fresh one. A quick light, and a puff of smoke, and he grinned, passing it on to his left. “Court is in session! Greg? Anything you wanna say?”  


He scowled, taking it and taking a puff before rolling his eyes and passing it on. “I’m sorry I left when we had to run from the spiders after breaking into the button shop,” he droned, wincing as Max gave him a hearty slap on the back.  


“Good job! Hayden?”  


I took the joint and puffed, hesitating. “Uhhh… I’m sorry I released hundreds of tiny spiders?”  


Ella snatched it away from me and gave us a look like we were off our crock. “I’m sorry I’m friends with such little girls!”  


“Yeah well… Has anyone noticed an unusual amount of spiders at home lately?” Greg asked suddenly, stopping her mid-smoke. I swear we all shared that ‘seen a ghost’ expression, gawking at him before taking up one of those awkward silences where everyone’s thinking the same shitty thing but no one wants to say it. “Guys?”  


“I found a spider in my shampoo bottle this morning,” Ella mumbled finally, and I shrank down on my stump. “It just kind of… popped out? I thought it was dead at first but it wasn’t.” Max turned to her in wide eyed horror, quickly turning off the mood music on his phone. Greg meanwhile let out a sigh of relief.  


“Man, I thought it was just me. My mom went to make coffee and they were in the sugar bowl. Two really fat ones.”  


“And she just kept going?!” I asked in horror. Greg kind of paused and scrunched his face, shaking his head.  


“Yeah? Now that I think about it, it was like she didn’t even see them.” He frowned, clearly picturing it. “I don’t think my dad did either. I don’t know. I skipped breakfast. That shit creeped me right out.”  


“You people are disgusting!” Max griped, gagging quietly.  


“Hey why does shit never happen to you?” Ella asked and gave him a suspicious glare. “Mr. Ambien-never-drugged-on-Christmas-Eve?”  


“Hey maybe you’re just, like, hallucinating!” Max accused. “That button shop is old as fuck, I bet there’s asbestos or something in there!”  


I sat there thinking while the two of them squabbled. Had I seen any extra spiders? Maybe? I mean, I’d seen a few. After the button shop trip I’d gone home and showered, stomping a couple stragglers that crawled out of my clothes. I hadn’t really thought much about it then but it wasn’t like I’d found the bodies when I went to clean them up. Just these small little circles of black, which considering the dust in there, and the soot on the coins, I’d kind of chalked it up to just being dirt.  


You ever experience something and then go to reflect back on it and wonder what the hell is wrong with you? How could you have missed something so obvious?  


“Why is it always spiders,” Greg groaned, trying to ignore the ongoing verbal slap fight.  


“Because it always is,” a voice interrupted from behind. Max and Ella sputtered to a stop and we all spun around to find a tall woman with salt and pepper curls in a puffy down vest standing behind us. “You must be Hayden, Max, Greg and Ella. I’m Allison Walsh. Welcome to your first bad year.”  


Max panicked and snatched the joint right out of Greg’s mouth, dropping it into his special box and just about throwing it. Allison snorted, shaking her head a little and coming to co-opt the bucket as a stool. “Don’t worry, I’m not here to tattle on you.”  


“How’d you find us?” Greg asked, looking owl eyed.  


“Oh the lady at the gas station said you kids come out here to get high. What, you think nobody notices?” She chuckled. “All I had to do was ask about the kid that tried to burn down the tree.” She bobbed her head in my direction. “Small town. Everyone knows everyone’s business. Did you know people think you’re going to shoot up the school?”  


I groaned, slumping a little further. *Great.* That rumor was still working its rounds.  


“What do you mean a ‘bad year’?” Ella asked, still just as shocked as the rest of us.  


“And you’re a Walsh?” Max added.  


“I am. I’m Rosalee Walsh’s youngest daughter. I left home at nineteen. Went to college. Got married. I’ve tried not to come back. A couple years ago I moved two hours that way,” she pointed to the West. “Close enough that I can keep an eye on my mother, far enough away that this place’s special brand of ‘Christmas magic’ doesn’t apply.” She let out a bit of a sigh, almost shivering for a second in the spring chill. “Mom called last year, early November, said she’d had some special guests visit her on Halloween.” She smiled a little bit, though it wasn’t entirely happy. “Said that trouble was brewing. She always had a sixth sense for the bullshit in this town. I got the call from the paramedics a few days after Christmas.” Her brows went up and she scanned the four of us, searching. “I’m hoping you kids have her journal.”  


I raised my hand like I was in elementary school again. “… and the box. I’ve got the box.” She let out a big sigh of relief, nodding.  


“Good. Suffice it to say my mother didn’t trust a damn soul in this town, and for good reason. Mom hid a lot and some of the folks around here are none too bright so they didn’t know quite where to look, but they definitely tried. It looked like someone robbed her house. That diary is worth its weight in gold, don’t let anyone take it.” Seemingly comforted, she thought for a moment before finally answering the other question.  


“A bad year happens when the little monsters don’t get to take a sacrifice with them. There’s not enough milk and cookies in the world for those little spirit suckers, so they take people too. If the town doesn’t give a sacrifice every year, the next year is a bad year. Starts off slow, really turns to shit before the next holiday season. I suppose it’s a way for them to inspire compliance.” She turned to Greg and gave him a stiff smile. “And it always starts with spiders, kid.” She stood up, brushing her butt off and pulling some gloves from her pocket. “Come on, I’ll buy you guys lunch.”  


An hour later we all had a plate in front of us, crammed into a booth at Joe’s Place. Allison picked at a Cobb salad. I had a burger and fries but hadn’t touched a bite. She looked a lot like Rosie, just younger. When I did the math it put her in her fifties, and while she didn’t have the same creases lining her face, she had that same hard stare. Like she’d seen more than enough for a single person’s lifetime. I glanced around the table. Greg was eating, Ella was also wrist deep into her meal, but Max was giving me the same thousand yard stare I was certain I was giving him. I had a sense of déjà vu from last year. A growing creeping sensation that things weren’t right, and we might be better off trying to convince our families to move.  


“Bad years don’t happen often,” Allison said finally, keeping her voice low. The place wasn’t busy, but it was a wordless agreement between all of us that we had to try and keep this quiet. “The last bad year was 1992. I’m sure you already know this but my parents poured cement down their chimney the year after I left. A lot of families did the same. No one would ever admit my mother was right, but she got letters all the time from families that had lost loved ones. People that wouldn’t look her in the eye at the grocery store but secretly stood with her. Halfway through that year the mayor threatened the hardware store and made them stop selling cement. People started driving into the nearby cities to get it. To say it was a catastrophe is probably an understatement. That Christmas, no one was taken. The acting mayor at the time managed to whisk the tree away before anyone saw what happened to it, but I’m going to take a wild guess and say it probably looked the same as last year.”  


“It was like it turned brown in an instant,” Max said softly. We’d all been amazed when we walked up to see how it had withered. Allison’s eyebrows shot up, and she nodded.  


“I think you’re one of few people to ever see the tree collapse.”  


“We visited the farm!” Ella piped up, getting a look of surprise back.  


“You went to Raully’s?” she asked, then shook her head and speared a piece of egg. “Crazy coot. I’ve met that man only once. I’m not entirely convinced he’s not also kept alive by ‘Christmas magic’.”  


“He’s a real person?” I blurted out, getting quickly elbowed by Ella and receiving that same cocked brow expression from Allison that Rosie would fix you with if you asked a stupid question. “I mean, he’s not some brand or something?”  


She shook her head. “Nope. Man’s real. I don’t know what his stake in the whole venture is exactly, but he’s real. If anything I’d guess he’s some sort of emissary for the little bastards.”  


“Emissary?”  


“Representative.”  


I nodded, thinking about it. He grew and protected the trees, it would make sense. “So the spiders…”  


“It always starts with spiders,” she said with a sigh. “A bad year always starts the same. A little economic downturn, and then a business shuts down. Last time it was the mill. This time, the Button Emporium.”  


“Why didn’t the mill ever reopen?”  


“That’d be rude, don’t ya think?” she pointed at Ella with her fork. “The bad year is a punishment. A slap on the wrist for bad behavior. If the town’s success is a gift they give, they can take it away just as easy.”  


“A la ‘I made you, I can take you out’ style,” Max piped in, frowning.  


“Bingo. And reopening a shuttered business would be very bad behavior. This town has always, always accepted its lumps. That store is never going to reopen.”  


“Does Mrs. Alps know?” I asked, wondering if the woman had any idea what had happened to her pride and joy. For all of its general uselessness, I’d never seen her happier than when she was talking about buttons. It seemed particularly cruel to take away a business that just genuinely affected almost no one.  


“Oh,” Allison scoffed. “She knows.”  


The way she described it, it was impossible not to know. It all started with spiders. They’d trickle in, slowly making the place uninhabitable until there was no possible way to ignore it.  


“And if they do, the accidents start. That’s what happened with the mill. A lot of families depended on that place for an income. They held off as long as they could until someone lost an arm.”  


“Someone lost an *arm*?” I asked in horror. I’d looked at the old newspaper articles about the mill closure and not once had they mentioned that someone lost a fucking arm! Allison gave me a sympathetic smile. I ate a fry and tried to process it all, a growing sense of dread sitting in my stomach like a rotten nut. “So what does that mean for us? We’ve all seen spiders at home.”  


“No one else seems to see them,” Ella added, sounding worried. Allison stiffened up, looking at each of us and for the first time, looking concerned. Up until now she’d just been telling us a story. Sharing facts. I could tell just from the look on her face that what we were seeing wasn’t normal.  


“You’re seeing spiders?” she asked cautiously, and I nodded. The woman seemed to do a bit of mental math and grimaced. She dug into the large purse she’d been toting with her, pulling out what looked like a pile of rotten paper stuffed haphazardly into an old, faded book. “I was worried about that. That’s why I came. News travels fast even outside of town and when I heard that the crazy old button store had closed down, I knew it was a bad year. Mom wasn’t the only one in our family to make a stand.” She pushed the pile across the table, and motioned for me to hide it. I stuffed it in my backpack. “Great Uncle Dan. He was a logger. Lost a kid one Christmas and was never the same. So the next year, I don’t know how, but he made sure no one lost anyone. Of course, the year after was a bad year. But instead of it *just* being a bad year, they came after him. It wasn’t just the town they were pissed at, it was him.”  


“What happened to him?”  


Allison hesitated a little and then pointed at the pile I’d stashed away. “Taken, I assume. He got real close. Really, really close. But they got him in the end.”  


“What was he trying to do?” Max asked, having now completely abandoned the rest of his food. Everyone had.  


“You’ve been to Raully’s Tree Farm, what did you see?”  


We looked at each other, thinking about the still standing giant spruce. A twin to the tree used in the town square every year. “We-”  


Suddenly the waitress came up, checking in on us with a smile. “How’s everything tasting?” We went round with a chorus of ‘good’ until she nodded, dropped the check, and made her way back to the register, where she stood and kept an eye on us. I glanced at her, the cook standing in the kitchen, peering at us through the little window, and then brought my eyes back to Allison, and immediately I knew. She wasn’t welcome in town any more than her mother was. People were watching, and it put a chill down my spine.  


“I just want to say thank you again for checking in on my mom. She said having kids at her doorstep on Halloween was just the highlight of her year! You really made her last couple of months easy, and I can’t tell you how much it means!” She said it cheerfully and at a volume meant for everyone to hear, pulling her wallet out and going to pay the bill. “You kids take care!” she called out before she left, waving and disappearing down the street. Later on, I found her phone number written on a card, tucked into the papers she’d given me.  


We ate the rest of our lunches in near silence, all of us spooked by the implications of what she’d shared. Afterwards we went our separate ways. Greg and Ella both still worked the same fast food job, though they’d noticed their hours slowly disappearing. Max went home to help his grandparents clean out the garage, and I went home and played Mario Kart with my little sister. Every once and a while I’d notice something wriggling from out of the corner of my eye, but every time I turned to look there’d be nothing there. It went on like that all afternoon, right up until I noticed a fat, round, wiggling black spider no bigger than a dime making its way up my sister’s back. I nearly crashed twice watching it round her shoulder, checking her face constantly to see if she felt anything as it crawled up her neck. I was just about to reach for it when she suddenly jumped, letting out a sharp “OUCH!” and reaching up to smack her neck where it sat.  


The little fuck had bit her! *And she’d felt it.* I watched in horror as the spider erupted into a tiny puff of soot on contact. She rubbed the spot red before rolling her eyes at me as I crashed into a wall. “If you don’t wanna play just say so Hayden!” she yelped at me, abandoning her controller and running into the kitchen for a snack.  


“No I… hey, I wanna play!” I called after her. My heart was beating out of my chest though. I couldn’t help but look around the living room with a dawning sense of horror. She couldn’t see them, but they could still bite her. “She can’t see them.” But they could still bite her. That meant that anyone close to us could be affected by the spiders.  


Suddenly it put what happened at the mill into perspective.  


I looked over at my backpack, grabbing it and pulling out the mess of loose paper and the old book. The book didn’t have a title. I couldn’t see an author. There wasn’t a publication date or location. It was just a book, cheaply bound and now falling apart, that looked like it was printed using a typewriter. The loose papers were a mix of fading handwriting on sheets of lined paper, scribbles on scraps and napkins, and pages carefully typed. I tried to shuffle them into something organized, finding what looked sort of like the start.  


“It started with the spiders,” I read aloud, squinting and trying to read the man’s handwriting. It was squiggly, almost as bad as a doctor’s prescription pad. “Hey Hannah!” I called out. “Would you bring me a coke?” I waited a beat. Nothing. “Please?” Again, nothing. “Yo – Hannah!” Still nothing. I stuffed everything into my backpack and then got up to head to the kitchen. Usually my kid sister was pretty cool. Maybe she was just grumpy I hadn’t paid attention to the game?  


The second I got into the kitchen I lost my shit. Hannah was on the ground. You’d think that going to war with Christmas spiders thing would’ve made me a little more capable of handling something like this, but the second I saw my little sister unconscious I was a bawling mess. I nearly tripped over the coffee table trying to get back to my phone so I could call 911. It was an absolute nightmare. I’ve never rode in an ambulance before. I’ve never so much as broken a finger before! Seeing my sister unconscious on a stretcher had to be one of the worst moments of my life.  


Max was the closest one to the hospital, so he got there first. I’d called 911, then texted everyone in a panic. My parents left work and were now busy talking to the doctors. They’d gotten her stabilized but she was still unconscious. The guess was an allergic reaction to something. Maybe a suddenly developing nut allergy, considering where I’d found her. That was their theory anyways. I knew better.  


I sat in the waiting room, holding a cup of watery hot chocolate when Max appeared, offering a hug I didn’t really have the energy to give back. He sat beside me and waited until a nurse passed by, then leaned in. “What happened man?”  


I clutched my backpack under one arm, guarding it like a dog defends a chunk of scavenged steak. “It bit her,” I whispered. He looked confused. I glanced around carefully, no longer trusting that the walls didn’t have ears. “One of those spiders? It *bit* her.” I watched him stiffen up, eyes going wide before he sat back, trying to keep it all casual. Neither of us wanted to draw attention. The implications of what happened to Hannah were terrifying, and it meant one very distinct, important thing.  


We'd ruined their last feeding season, and now they were coming after us. We were fucked.
