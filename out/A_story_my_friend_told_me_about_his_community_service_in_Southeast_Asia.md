This isn’t my story; it’s the experience of my international classmate which he told me years ago. For the sake of simplicity, let's just call him Daniel.

Back when Daniel was a student in his home country, he participated in a community service programme in a remote mountain village somewhere in Southeast Asia. You know the type—isolated, beautiful, and quiet, but with that eerie stillness that makes your skin crawl if you think too hard about it.

Daniel stayed there with 20 other students. They all shared a large boarding house near the edge of the forest. The house was owned by the village leader. It was simple but functional, with creaky floors and windows that rattled whenever the mountain winds blew. Their daily routine was packed—teaching, fixing roads, running workshops. They were busy enough to mostly forget the weird vibes of the place.

Every afternoon, two students would ride a motorcycle down the winding dirt road to the market at the foot of the mountain. The market was where they bought food, toiletries, and other supplies. The road was narrow and steep, snaking alongside giant water pipes that stretched endlessly downhill. These pipes transported water from the mountain’s natural springs to the town centre far below. To Daniel, they were just pipes, though their sheer size was a bit unnerving—they loomed over the road like silent sentinels.

One day, it was Daniel’s turn to head to the market. He was paired with one of his friends, let's call him Alex, who was known for being sensitive. Sensitive as in...supernatural-sensitive. 

Alex wasn’t shy about it either. He’d often tell the others to avoid certain parts of the house or warn them about strange noises at night. Some believed him; others teased him for being overly dramatic. Daniel fell somewhere in the middle. He didn’t entirely believe Alex, but he wasn’t about to test his luck either.

The trip to the market was uneventful. They navigated the steep, bumpy road without incident, bought everything they needed, and even joked about how the village shopkeepers seemed to overcharge outsiders like them. But as they loaded the motorcycle for the return trip, Alex started acting...off. He grew unusually quiet, his face pale and his hands trembling as he tied the bags onto the bike. Daniel asked if he was feeling sick, but Alex just shook his head and muttered, “Let’s go.”

The ride back was when things took a turn.

The sun was setting, bathing the road in orange and casting long shadows. As they climbed higher up the mountain, the towering pipes on their right seemed to grow darker and more imposing. Daniel noticed Alex gripping his seat tightly, his breathing quick and shallow. Halfway up, Alex suddenly let out a soft gasp, like he’d seen something he wasn’t supposed to.

“What’s wrong?” Daniel shouted over the roar of the engine, but Alex didn’t answer. He just kept his head down, his shoulders shaking.

By the time they reached the boarding house, Alex was full-on sobbing. He jumped off the bike and ran inside without helping unload the supplies. The other students quickly surrounded him, asking what had happened, but he just kept crying. Daniel, now equally shaken, had to explain what little he knew—that Alex had been fine until halfway up the road, and then something spooked him.

It took nearly an hour before Alex calmed down enough to speak. And when he did, the whole room went dead silent.

“I saw them,” he whispered. “The headless ones.”

Apparently, as they were riding up the mountain, Alex saw figures standing on the pipes. Not just one or two, but dozens of them, evenly spaced out, their bodies glowing faintly in the dim light. They had no heads, yet they seemed to be watching him—or at least he felt like they were. As they passed each figure, they raised their hands and waved at him in unison. A slow, deliberate wave, as if mocking him. That was when Alex started crying and kept his eyes shut for the rest of the ride.

The room was silent as Alex finished his story, his voice shaking with fear. Some of the students tried to laugh it off, saying he was probably imagining things because he was tired. But the locals, who were helping them with the programme, didn’t laugh. In fact, their faces grew grim.

One of the older villagers spoke up, his voice low. “You saw the ones who were sacrificed.”

Everyone turned to him, wide-eyed. The old man explained that the water pipes had been built during the colonial era, a massive project that required years of labour. The mountain was treacherous, and the work was brutal. Many labourers died from accidents, illness, or sheer exhaustion. But there were also rumours—whispers that some workers were deliberately killed as sacrifices to ensure the project’s success. It was an old belief in the region that large construction projects needed offerings to appease the spirits of the land.

“Those spirits,” the old man continued, “don’t always find peace. They stay near the pipes, where they were bound in death.”

No one slept well that night. Alex refused to step outside after dark, and the others couldn’t shake the mental image of headless figures waving at them from the shadows. Even Daniel, who had always been skeptical about ghost stories, felt uneasy.

The rest of their stay in the village was filled with uneasiness. No one volunteered to go to the market anymore. The students resorted to rationing their food and supplies to avoid taking that cursed road. And when the programme finally ended, they left the mountain without looking back.

Daniel told me this story with a nervous laugh, as if trying to downplay how much it rattled him. He doesn’t really believe in the supernatural, not like Alex does, but every time he remembers that night, he can’t help but feel unsettled.

Since hearing Daniel's story, I can’t look at beautiful mountain villages the same way. What used to feel serene and untouched now feels like it hides something—memories, secrets, or perhaps even restless spirits.

Whenever I see long, winding roads, or huge water pipes cutting through the landscape, I find myself wondering what kind of secrets might have been kept to build them. The crisp mountain air no longer feels refreshing; it feels heavy, as though the land itself is holding onto stories it doesn’t want to tell.

Daniel’s story has stayed with me in ways I never expected. I consider myself a skeptic, but his account has made me question how much of a place’s beauty is built on buried pain. It’s unsettling, the idea that progress often leaves behind scars, not just on people but on the land itself.

And sometimes, when I visit places like that, I catch myself looking at the shadows—half-wondering if something is looking back.
