 It was a hot summer and I worked at a small restaurant in my small town and since it was summer night and everyone was either asleep or out of town we didn't have had any clients. 
Me and I and my shift mate Kate, a short girl around my age with fair skin and a small mole under her lip, were about to finish our night shift and go home, when suddenly a small boy runned inside.

   He was relatively short with long white hair cut differently and baggy clothes that covered every inch of his body. Weird choice of clothing keeping in mind that day was more that 31 Degrees Celsius.

  The boy runned into one of the couches and just laid there for at least 3 minutes.Me and Kate looked at each other confused and in the end we decided to approach the kid. I'd stay in the back, just in case it was some sort of trap while Kate would go and talk to him.

   She went and I saw her talking with the kid for a little bit, before returning back to me.
- So? Who is he ?
- He says that his name is Joseph. Just Joseph nothing more nothing less.
- That's what he told you?
- Yes. Exactly word by word.
- and what does he want?? Is he okay?? I asked worried. The kid looked exhausted and tired and what's more his hair was so dirty that looked as if someone had dumped a whole entire bucket of oil at him. Well he was also sweaty but that was obvious with his choice of clothing in that  weather.

  - He says he is fine and he just wants a cup of water, Kate said as she filled up a paper cup...but I don't think he is okay...he is extremely skinny and he looks like he hasn't slept in days. He is shivering and shaking and he has dark eyebags and some sort of weird brushes everywhere...I don't know he might be abused, she said as she shook her head...And don't even get me started on the smell! She said with a sigh before leaving again to give the boy his water and she soon returned with a puzzled expression on her face.

  I looked at her with worry.
- Smell? What smell?
- he smells as If he is rotting! Literally that is the most gross thing I've ever smelled....and he is so ghostly and pale I can see his veins. HIS VEINS SARAH HIS VEINS, she said and she exhaled sharply.

  - And what are we going to do? We can't just leave him in the restaurant, neither can we just leave him outside in that state! I protested. She hadn't said anything about doing such I thing but I knew her. She was thinking about doing just that.
- I don't know girl, maybe he is a ghost what can I tell you, she said with a half baked chuckle...all I know is that it's getting late, I am tired and there's a freaky kid in the restaurant that stops us from leaving! 

 - So? He is human too we can't just leave him!
- Yes , but we can't just take him home with us! What will we say to our parents? Hello mom I am home and I brought this weird kid that looked and smells as if he is in the 3 stages of decomposition with me???

   I sighed and smiled. 
 - I mean your parents aren't home...
- No.
- yes
- No.
- yes
- No.
- yes.
- No.
- yes
- FINE. Sarah said throwing her arms in the air. I'll take the creepy kid, happy?
- Very! I said with a smile. Now go go it's late.
 She opened to door and too our surprised the kid was standing behind the door staring at us menacingly with his soulless eyes.

 - I am glad you'll host me tonight miss! He rasped !
- Yeah yeah, Sarah said as she took him by the sleeve carefully not too touch him. C'mon let's go it's late. 

   Before leaving she looked at me worried and that's the last time I saw both her and Joseph.

  The next day she didn't show up at work and by the next day I was able too call the cops for a investigation. They found her dead in her house, skinned alive and her limbs cut off. They also found that her younger brother's formal  clothes were missing and as for the boy he was nowhere too be seen.

   A year passed after that and soon summer came once again. I was about to close my night shift when someone entered.

 - Sorry, we are closed. I said in a monotone voice.
- Oh I know! A young and playful  voice answered...A voice that I was engraved in my memory. I turned around and just as I thought the same boy was standing in front of me.
  Though this time he looked happy and healthy, clean and neat with a small mole under his lip, a mole identical to Kate's, a mole that he didn't have the last time I saw him.
