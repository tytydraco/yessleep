  

 I need to get out a warning. Maybe if I get this story out in an anonymous place such as this, it could be enough to save some people. I am in a seedy hotel in the worst part of the city as I write this account of what befell earlier today. The Wi-Fi is not the greatest, but hopefully it will suffice. I am using a high security VPN, but with what I am dealing with I am not sure it will be enough to keep me hidden.

I was hired by a government agency to test a new medical procedure that could revolutionize all medical treatment as we know it. When I was hired, I was thrilled to be part of such a project. I had worked in computer and medical research facilities, but this was a huge advancement in my career. I was full of excitement, as my work up until this time had been pretty routine and boring.

This morning, I was going to run my first complete test on a human subject. I was sitting at my computer, and the door to the testing room opened. I looked up as a facility assistant, George, led a man in. The man was large, middle aged, his face drawn, and his eyes darted at me and around the room.

“Hey Maggie,” said George. “This is Thomas.”

George handed me a file, I took it and smiled at Thomas as he stood just within the door and fidgeted.

“Good luck!” George said, giving me a thumbs up and left, closing the door behind him with a click.

“Hello Thomas,” I said trying to sound casual and yet reassuring in my tone. “Before we start, let me know if you have any questions.”

Thomas nodded twice, the side of his mouth quirking up.

“I’ve been briefed on the procedure,” he said softly. “This is my last chance, according to the doctors there is nothing they can do. I have less than three months to live.”

I know I am supposed to be clinical and professional, but I hesitated on what to say to him. Do I give him hope? If the test failed, if the results were not as we expected from the simulations we had run, how do I tell him? 

So, I just nodded and got up from my seat to lead him to the “slab” as we called it. It was made of a special glass, and was below an array of lasers that hung from the ceiling. It was not very comfortable, but if all went as planned he would not be there long. I gestured for him to lie down on his back, and then fastened straps over his forehead, wrists and ankles. 

‘You okay Thomas?” I said when I was done.

“Yeah, I guess.” Thomas replied, his eyes shining with a mix of apprehension and just maybe hope.

I sat down at my computer station and started the program. A low hum filled the room, and a very light vibration could be felt. I waited for the AI that ran everything to come online and give me the sign that all was ready. 

*Systems go, Maggie….*

My heart rate picked up, and I took a deep breath.

“We are starting Thomas,” I said.

*Go*

I turned to watch as the lasers came down upon the prone man. Many beams of white light lit up his body, like a million tiny stars sparkling on his skin. I glanced at the screen that monitored his vitals. I let go a breath that I did not know I was holding as I saw all was in the green. Next I looked at the screen that showed me his progress. It was an outline of his body, and the areas being treated were blobs of red within it…so many blobs. I felt myself wince involuntarily. He must be in so much pain, it was amazing he could remain so calm. Next I watched the rush of data that the AI was collecting, the adjustments it was making. The lasers began to change colors, blinking in and out of the rainbow, I could not even make out Thomas’s form anymore. 

Slowly, the red blobs on his progress monitor began to shrink. It was working! I smiled and bit my lower lip so as not to shriek in elation and disturb Thomas in his cocoon of rainbow light. After twenty minutes, there were no more red blobs.

*Great job* I typed to the AI. *Let’s wrap this up.*

I waited for a reply…nothing from the AI. I tried again, but there was still no response. Nervously I looked at the screen that showed Thomas’s vitals. All was well, in fact more than well. The screen that showed his progress was free of red blobs still, but something else was happening. I jumped up and looked over at Thomas. The lasers blinded me, their light was so bright I reflexively threw up my hands in front of my eyes. 

“Thomas!” I called. “Are you okay?”

I got no response. Shaking I tried typing in the override in to shut down the AI.

*That won’t work Maggie.*

I started to panic, my chest heaving as my heart tried to jump out of my chest. I could barely move without shaking, when a massive vibration began to penetrate the room and go painfully through me. I ran to the door to try and get help, when everything suddenly stopped. I threw the door open, but it shut in front of me with a force that made me stumble backwards.

Before I could react something gripped me, and I felt myself being lifted off my feet. My body was turned so I was facing the slab. My breath caught in a gasp. In front of me stood a being, perfect in every way, except that it was made of a white light that radiated outward and almost filled the room.

“Mortal,” said the being. “You will make it known to all humankind, that I, their new and only god, demand that they give up all their false gods and worship only me. For I am the cure for the wretchedness of their existence. Those who do not comply will feel my wrath. You have five days.”

My eyes darted around the room, looking for Thomas. Could I really be alone experiencing this? I felt like I was caught in some kind of delusion.

“Thomas…” I squeaked.

“The one called Thomas is no more, there is just me the only god,” the being replied coldly. “GO, do my bidding or incur my vengeance!”

Suddenly I was dropped to the floor, my legs buckling underneath me. The being in front of me lit up like a white-hot star and in a burst, was gone.

Before I fled the facility, I tried to retrieve the data on this test that the AI transmitted to the server storage. But I failed. I downloaded the data and the AI onto my laptop. Everything that happened is in the hands of the government agency that conducted this research.  I don’t know who to fear more – the agency or the one who calls itself the “only god.” No, I have not done as this only god has asked, who would believe me? But those of you reading this here, if you can believe my recounting of events, can make a decision for yourselves.

I don’t know what will become of me. I keep reviewing the data, hoping to find something, anything that can help undo this mess. I have done my best to be sure I can’t be tracked, changing IP addresses and all means for them to trace me. But….I just got a message on my phone.

*Found you Maggie….*
