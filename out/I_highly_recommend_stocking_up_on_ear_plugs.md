 When I was a kid, all I wanted to do was become a professional hockey player. In the winter, I’d play for hours on the lake with my friends. I was good. *Really good.* I truly thought I’d play professionally one day. But as I got older, I realized that dream would never be a reality. My dad did the best he could as a single parent, but we didn’t have enough money for hockey camps or proper coaching. I’d never even owned a new pair of skates (all of mine were hand-me-downs from my neighbour and I’d routinely have to wear four pairs of socks to stop my feet from sliding around in them). I was a really good hockey player, but I realized that without proper training, I would never be good enough to play professionally. By the time I was in high school, I knew I needed to be honest with myself: that dream was just a fantasy.

I just wanted to share that because I wanted you to know that it was never my dream to become a prison guard. It was never my calling. When I graduated, there were limited jobs in my area. I could’ve ventured out West to look for different employment (many of my friends fled our town as soon as they were done school), but I wanted to stay close to home. My dad was sick at the time, and I didn’t want to go too far. Plus, there was a girl I really liked, Noey, but I hadn’t had the courage to ask her out yet. 

In hindsight, I should’ve gone. 

But I didn’t. I stayed. And I became a prison guard. 

At first, I didn't think I was cut out for the job. It was demanding and stressful work with very long hours. It could be very dangerous as well. But over time, I realized that I had a natural talent for it. Always being able to stay alert and pick up on even subtle changes in inmates were skills not everyone had. Many think being forceful is the key to being a good prison guard, but my ability for silent and skillful observation was my greatest asset. I was usually able to pick up on where there’d be trouble and head it off before it got too bad. Eventually the warden recognized this. I got promoted quite quickly compared to the rest of my colleagues. Eventually I was working maximum security. 

To be honest, I secretly hated my job. I wanted to leave (especially after my dad passed away) but the money just kept on getting better each time I got promoted. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t a lot better, but it was enough to keep me there. By then, Noey had become my wife. My everything. We had wanted to start a family together, and it was important to me that we’d be financially secure when we welcomed our little bundle. 

I buckled down with the new dream of becoming a warden one day. I knew I could do it if I worked hard enough. I wanted to make sure my kid had what I didn’t. If they wanted hockey coaching, or whatever they needed to follow their dreams, I wanted them to have it. I started taking online classes on top of continuing my job at the prison. 

I should’ve known by then that it was foolish of me to have dreams. 

Life has had a way of turning my dreams upside-down and then grinding them into dust. 

Noey was driving home from work late one night. She had stopped to pick up some take-out, Pad Thai and Tom Kah with spring rolls, because I had told her I didn’t have time to make dinner because I was studying for an exam. People have told me not to blame myself, but I do. And I always will. If I had just made dinner that night — if she didn’t need to pick up that take-out — if she had just driven her normal route — she would’t’ve been on the road at the same time as the drunk driver who killed her. If she hadn’t married me, she wouldn’t’ve been killed. 

But she was. To be honest, who I was before died that night as well. On the outside, I became a hardened shell. On the inside, the shadow of who I once was hid away clutching tightly to my pain like it was all that was left in life to hold on to. I pushed away everyone who tried to comfort me. I didn’t care about anyone or anything anymore. It was like a monster now wore my skin. 

But that isn’t the monster story I’m here to tell you about. 

I’m getting to that now. 

What came before is important in understanding how I got the next job I had.

They clearly wanted talented prison guards. But they also wanted people who were unattached. No family, no loved ones. They wanted people who would leave everything behind to accept the job. But they also wanted people who wouldn’t be missed if they never returned. Of course, they didn’t advertise that part. That part, I only realized later. 

When I got the job offer, it was highly secretive. I needed to sign an NDA just to view it. Yes, I realize that I am now currently in breach of the NDA, but I’ve realized now that I have something to care about again: your safety. I really don’t care what happens to me, but I know it’s important that you are all prepared for the danger that is now out there. 

The job offer was for a guard position at a facility called The Vault. Nothing more was explained to me then except that they were seeking highly trained prison guards for full time, live-in, positions. The pay was extraordinary. I had nothing to lose at that point and I wanted to get away from anything connected to my previous life. The job was perfect for me. I accepted immediately, signed my name on the dotted line, and expected never to look back. 

I was told I couldn’t pack anything. For safety reasons, nothing from the outside could be brought into facility. That didn’t bother me. Everything I needed, I was told, would be provided for me there. When I asked when I was to supposed start work, I was told: “Now”. And that’s the last thing I remember before I woke up. 

I was brought into semi-consciousness by the horrible sound of a SNAPPING-CRUNCH. Then a female voice said: “I thought you hated celery.” I could hear, but I couldn’t move or open my eyes.

“I do,” a male voice responded in between his crunching chewing, “but I gotta slim down a bit.”

“Why?”

“I heard a couple of the inmates whispering yesterday. They said I was getting to a tasty size.” 

“Don’t let them get in your head, Seward. You’re a healthy size. And you need to stay healthy. We can’t afford to lose any more guards.” I listened to the woman’s footsteps pace nearby as I tried to figure out what was happening.

“This lot better be more capable than they look,” she said.  

“They do look a bit weedy. But I heard they’re all that could be rustled up with such short notice.”

“I guess we should see what we’re dealing with now, eh?”

Footsteps walked towards me. I heard a click right by my ear. Then, something sharp and incredibly painful stabbed into my neck. My eyes snapped open as clarity hit me. Whatever drugs had been in my system left immediately. But it took my brain a moment to fully be able to register my sudden new surroundings. 

I was now sitting at a desk in what looked like some sort of training hall. Beside me was a row of other chairs and desks filled with unconscious men and women all wearing the same black guard uniform. I realized then that I was now also wearing a new black uniform matching theirs. 

A female officer, dressed in a red uniform, walked down the row of unconscious guards, clicking a device against each of their necks to wake them. She had a strong and formidable presence to her. A male officer, also dressed in red, was watching everyone wake while munching on his celery. He too, looked strong, but had a more relaxed posture. These were the two whose voices I had heard talking, I assumed. They were obviously a higher rank than the rest of us. The male, I remembered, had been called Seward. I saw this confirmed on his ID tag. The female’s tag identified her as Officer Irving. 

After each click of Irving’s device, another new guard was woken. I noticed everyone bore the same look of disoriented bewilderment as they came too. Some, like the man right beside me, also looked a little sick. Everyone looked around, trying to make sense of their surroundings. 

Everyone, except, I noticed, the second to last guard in the row: a woman with dark hair and dark eyes. When she was woken, there was something different in her eyes. Instead of lingering bewilderment or sickness, her look of disorientation quickly disappeared and settled into a look of quiet determination. I thought it seemed odd. But because the whole environment was so new to me at that point, I didn’t linger on that thought long. But it’s something I remember vividly when I think back on what happened.

“Rise and shine, all!” Seward shouted at us. 

I saw him pick up a bucket from the side of the room. I wondered what it was for. 

“Welcome to the Vault!” He said. "And congratulations! We only hire the most impressive candidates.” He moved towards me with the bucket. I was confused until I saw him put it under the chin of the guard right beside me, just in time for him to vomit into it. Then, he moved three chairs down to let another guard hurl. This seemed pretty routine to Seward.

“We’ll just give you a sec to find your heads before we dive into training,” he said. “We appreciate your cooperation with our transportation methods. As you know, it’s of paramount importance that we keep our facility’s location a secret, even to staff.” 

“We can’t risk an information leak,” Irving explained. She had a dry and practical way of speaking. 

“Right,” Seward continued, “there are those out there who want to break our inmates outta here. And if they do... well, it’d be like opening the gates of hell to the world. It’s our job to make sure these monsters stay in here.”

My attention was caught by a booklet on the desk in front of me: “THE VAULT: Containment Officer Training Manual” was stamped on the front. I flipped it open. Inside was written: “Specific protocols for specific inmates.” An index with page numbers corresponded with: “Vampires, Werewolves, Banshees, Witches, Mermaids, and Demons”. *What?* Was this some sort of horrible joke, I wondered. 

My eyes shifted around the room, looking for cameras. Was I on TV or something? I couldn’t see any cameras. 

Seward continued: “Yes, the Vault contains monsters. Real monsters.”

“What is this? What are you playing at?” The man beside spat out the question that was also burning in my mind. 

Seward answered calmly, almost jovially: “Yes, we understand it’s pretty unbelievable. A lot to take at first. But if you don’t believe me right now, I’m not really worried, because you will as soon as you meet the inmates. I can tell a lot of you are still skeptical, but it would be helpful if you could keep any words of doubt to yourself for now. Getting to the proof part will come much quicker that way. Before we take you on the grand tour, there’s some crucial information we need to share with you first.”

I was usually so good a picking up on when someone was lying, so I was confused why I thought it sounded like he was telling the truth. Rational disbelief shouted loudly in my brain even though my instincts were telling me to trust what the officers were telling us. For some reason, I felt it was important to remember every word they said. And I have. I think their words will be imprinted on my mind forever:

“You’ve all been hired because you’ve had prior experience in correctional institutions,” Irving said. “But let’s be very clear on this: the Vault is not a normal prison. There is no possibility for correction here. This is a containment centre. The inmates here are here for good. They are all very dangerous. And many of them are… extremely bored. Which means that they’re constantly thinking of different ways to escape.”

“Especially the vampires,” added Seward. “Some have been here for as long as the Vault’s been in existence. So... a hundred years?”

“One hundred and two. In January,” Irving confirmed. “Many of the inmates will want you to think you’re friends. But they are not your friends. It could prove a fatal mistake to think otherwise.” 

Then Irving pulled out a box. She dumped its contents to the floor. They were black uniforms. All torn to shreds. She held up a shirt out so we could all see it better. Although difficult to notice at first because the black material, I could see it was covered in blood.

“We recently lost eleven officers because someone thought werewolves could be trained,” said Irving. 

“Rehabilitated”, I think was the word Officer Grey used,” Officer Seward added. 

“Eleven officers were killed?” A new guard sitting in the middle of the row asked, shocked.

Irving answered: “Well, four were killed and the rest are now inmates in Wing 5, including Officer Grey. His stupidity has left us both short staffed and overcrowded.”

“So we trust you all will understand the seriousness in which we must follow protocol here. In the manual in front of you, you’ll find everything you need to know. But if you have any questions, feel free to ask myself or Officer Irving. We will be overseeing your training. Oh yes, I am Officer Seward. Very pleased to meet y-“

BANG! His pleasantries were interrupted by Irving using her baton to smack a map of the prison on the wall. It was clear she didn’t have patience for wasting time with anything beyond what was absolutely necessary. 

“First thing you need to know is the Vault’s layout. Separate Wings house separate types of inmates, all with different needs and containment strategies. Wing 5, as you’ve probably gathered, is for werewolves.”

“Recent break out attempt aside, containment is actually usually pretty straightforward,” Seward said. “Just keep an eye on the lunar calendar.” He pointed to a calendar on the wall beside a countdown sign that showed: 8 DAYS to FULL MOON. “They tend to act out more coming up to a full moon, but otherwise, they usually seem pretty normal.” He seemed almost laid back about it. 

“Don’t let that fool you,” Irving said. “When full moon hits, strict confinement is absolutely crucial.”

“This should go without saying, but, it must be said…” Seward continued: “Do not let the werewolves bite you. Or the vampires. Don’t let any of the inmates bite you.”

Then I heard someone ask: “They’re always behind bars though, right?” I looked over to see who it was: the man on the far end of the row. He seemed to be genuinely asking the question. Like he genuinely believed that there were monsters being kept there. My rational brain was still telling me it couldn’t possibly be true. 

The woman beside him, the dark haired one who had caught my attention earlier, spoke up: “They’re monsters, not animals.” Her voice had both a grate and resonance to it. Somehow beautiful and intimidating at the same time. I felt my blood run cold for a reason I couldn’t explain. No one else seemed to be unsettled by her. 

But I saw Irving’s eyes study her with greater attention. Irving’s eyes flicked down to read the woman’s ID tag. “Right, Officer Thornley,” Irving nodded at the woman. “Inmates who have proven themselves trustworthy are allowed in the general population. But if you find an inmate is approaching you without keeping proper distance, we have several deterrents.”

Irving took items off her utility belt to show us: “Tasers are most effective at keeping werewolves in line. For vampires, you’ve got your spray. You’re probably used to using mace. This is a mix of holy water and garlic juice.”

“Debilitating to vampires but harmless to us. If not a bit stinky,” Seward added. “Give it a spray, you’ll see. Go on.”

I, and the rest of the new guards, examined the items on our own utility belts. I saw others taking out the spray can and spritzing the liquid on their hands. No one had any extreme reactions. There were just a few wrinkled noses at the smell. It seemed safe, so I did the same. It did smell like garlic. 

I noticed that Thornley was the only one who didn’t spray hers. Irving noticed this too. She was watching Thornley with a suspicious gaze. 

I saw Thornley realize this.  

Thornley then took the spray bottle out of her utility belt and sprayed it on her hand. She sniffled it, just like all the other guards. Irving looked away, satisfied. She continued: 

“Now, demons... they are the ones we do keep under strict 24/7 confinement. Their cells are built completely of iron and bricks of Himalayan rock salt. 

“Quite pretty, actually, when they blaze in rage,” Seward added. “The cells glow like lanterns.”  

Irving shot Seward a glare to stop him talking and continued: “Demons don’t need food or water so there’s no need to interact with them. Once we lock their door, we never unlock it. And keep in mind, these are not the deal-making wish-granting kind of demons.”

“Those are genies,” explained Seward. 

“Which are not kept here,” Irving said. “Remember, demons are extremely manipulative and excellent liars.”

“Plus, they have the ability to... assume a pleasing shape,” Seward said. “They can look hot,” he clarified. “I mean, obviously they can look hot as in hot, like fire hot, but they can also make themselves look very physically attractive to our human eyes.”

“So don’t get any worm-brained ideas about trying to talk to them,” Irving warned. “We keep Officer Potts here for a reminder of that.”

She picked up a jar of ashes with Officer Potts’ ID tag tied to it. 

“A demon turned an officer to dust?!” The guard beside me, the one who had hurled earlier, asked. He still looked unwell, but now it was probably due to the thought of being turned to dust. 

“No,” Irving said, as if he had asked an incredibly ignorant question. “Demons can’t turn people to dust. Officer Potts let one out, he was possessed, there was a botched exorcism, he died. And then he was cremated. Everyone, raise your hand if you have any more questions. This random blurting out is getting tiresome.” 

The same guard then raised his hand. 

Irving, seeing it, had no choice but to say: “Yes…?”

“What do we use to keep demons back?” The guard asked.

“Nothing,” Irving answered. "If a demon’s coming at you, the best thing to do is... accept your fate because you’re pretty much screwed. Demons are Wing 1. Vampires are Wing 3.”

“The vampires are usually pretty chill,” Seward noted. “We just make sure to keep the library well stocked. And they like to play chess. There’s a tournament on the 8th, actually. They’re pretty excited about it.”

“We like to encourage that type of excitement,” Irving explained. “Oh yes, and due to recent budget cuts, part of the Containment Officer job now also requires regular blood draws. To keep our blood bank full. We don’t want a riot in Wing 3, now, do we?”

Irving then pulled out a pouch from her utility belt. “In this pouch is your ear protection. If you’re working the Banshee wing, you must make sure to wear proper ear protection at all times. At close range, their screams will have you unconscious in under five seconds.”

“It’s not pretty,” Seward added.  

Then I saw Thornley raise her hand. 

“A question?” Seward asked. 

“Yes,” Thornley answered. “You didn’t say which wing the Banshees are held in.” 

“Ah, that’s Wing 2,” he pointed to it on the prison map. 

Then, I saw a smile creep on to Thornley’s face. It frightened me. Alarm bells started ringing in my head, but I didn’t know what they meant then. Or my rational brain didn't yet allow me. 

Seward continued: “Wing 1 is Demons, Wing 2 Banshees, Wing 3 Vampires, Wing 4 Mermaids…” But as everyone else watched him, I was watching Thornley. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I knew deep in my gut something was terribly wrong. 

Then, Thornley's eyes turned on me. Her eyes locked on my gaze. 

Something clicked in my brain. In that second, my hands flew for my ear protection. I almost had the ear plugs in when Thornley opened her mouth and SCREAAAAAAAMMMMMMED! 

It was unlike any sound a human could possibly make. My head felt like it was going to explode. I dropped to the ground, clutching my hands to my head, along with everyone else. But because I already had the ear plugs in my hands, I was able to push them into my ears. 

The sound of Thornley’s screaming was dampened but I still kept my hands pressed over my ears. It was the worst sound I’ve ever heard in my entire life. The scream reverberated through the entire room - lights flickered, glass cracked.

I watched in horror as soon everyone else started to convulse on the floor. Blood then started pouring from their ears. There was nothing I could do to help. I closed my eyes tightly, willing this all to be a nightmare. 

Then, Thornley stopped screaming. Irving had said that a Banshee scream would have you unconscious in under five seconds. Thornley had screamed for at least fifteen. I knew that me revealing I was still conscious wouldn’t do me any favours. I pretended to be unconscious.

When I thought she would be gone, I snuck a look. But she wasn’t gone. I could see Thornley had the prison map in her hand now. She kicked over Irving’s body. Then she bent down to unfasten the ring of keys from Irving’s belt. I closed my eyes again as Thornley got up. 

When I was brave enough to open them again, she was gone. 

I looked around at the motionless guards around me, not knowing what to do. I let my instinct lead me. I found a door, and another door, and another door. Then I was outside. 

I had no idea where I was. Trees stretched for as far as I could see. I ran into them. I ran and ran. I knew I needed to get as far from that place as I could. 

Then I felt it. A deep rumble in the earth. Then a sickening CRACK and BOOM. It came from the direction I was running from. I know what had happened. The Vault had been opened. 

I ran until my limbs couldn’t carry me anymore. I honestly don’t remember anything between that and the hospital. 

They said I had been found in the woods, distressed and near death with starvation and dehydration. 

No one believes my story. But it’s true. I’ve learned to trust what my instincts are telling me. The Vault is open and there are monsters out there. I want you to stay safe. 

I’d highly recommend stocking up on ear plugs. And garlic and holy water. I'd pick up a taser too. I hope you never come across a demon. 

Irving and Seward never went over what to do with witches. 

Or mermaids.
