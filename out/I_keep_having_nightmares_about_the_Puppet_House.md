Last night, I had the creepiest fucking dream. It started with me being hired to travel to some small town so I could organize an event at their local theater hall. When I got there though, the place was a total ghost town. Nobody in sight. Eventually, I located the theater hall at the center of town and made my way inside. I entered the theater proper and saw that a small house occupied the length of the stage at the far end.

It was roughly the scale of a kid’s Fisher-Price playhouse but far more realistic in appearance. The house looked almost exactly like your typical colonial two-story, complete with a brick facade and shingled roof; only it was about 1/10th the size. A banner hanging above the stage read:

THE PUPPET HOUSE

There was movement at one of the house’s first-floor windows; a hideous humanoid puppet was rising into view. The puppet was distinctly male in appearance with a gray combover and ghoulish, exaggerated features and what I soon realized were dozens of tiny black ants stretching a line from one corner of his smirking mouth to the recess formed by the puppet’s cartoonishly concave chin. He looked directly at me and in a voice that sent a chill down my spine, the puppet said, “Bad time, buddy."

Somewhere inside the puppet house, a woman began to scream. The screaming eventually stopped and a female puppet, equally hideous in her own unique ways, appeared at the window adjacent to the one the male puppet was standing at. She pulled up her skirt and was straightening her bra when the male puppet pointed a thumb at her and said, “And that’s what she sounds like when she’s HAPPY!"

He paused (I assume for laughter) and that’s when I finally noticed the silhouette crouched behind him. I realized this was the puppeteer and, judging from the shape, it was clearly not human. As I tilted my head to try and get a better look, the silhouette seemed to shift before my eyes, changing from a vague mass of lumps into something more sleek and angular, like a large praying mantis.

I stepped closer to the stage to try and get a better angle and that’s when I finally registered the voice behind me repeatedly screaming, “Stop!”

I turned to see a beautiful woman with her shirt unbuttoned, exposing an excellent pair of breasts. It was then I realized I was now standing ON the stage, mere feet from the puppet house’s slowly opening front door and this woman was desperately trying to pull me in the opposite direction.

I let her guide me outside and once we were there, the woman finally let go of my arm and unfortunately started to button her shirt. As if reading my mind, she said, “It was the only thing I could think of to snap you out of it.”

I started to explain that my job had sent me here but the woman quickly cut me off, shaking her head as she said, “You manage a Domino's Pizza. You weren't sent here. You were lured. See?”

The woman gestured back through the theater’s open doorway and I turned to see that the rows of seats lining the hall were now filled with hundreds of wide-eyed, slack-jawed corpses…

And that was when I woke up. Now, I am a grown-ass man who has had plenty of nightmares in his lifetime. But nothing that has ever stayed with me like this one did. I spent the whole day thinking about it; which is probably why as soon as I drifted off to sleep tonight, I found myself back inside that theater.

I told my legs to turn and run but it was no use. Something else had control of them now. As I was guided toward the stage, I could hear the first chords of Burl Ives’s “A Little Bitty Tear” emanating from the puppet house. The male puppet (who I’ve come to call “Bad Time Buddy”) appeared at his window on the first floor, mouthing the lyrics along with Burl…

*“A little bitty tear let me down… Spoiled my act as a clown.”*

On cue, the female puppet rose into view at her window to mime singing along as well…

*“I had it made up not to make a frown… But a little bitty tear let me down.”*

The eyeless corpse of the beautiful woman from the night before was suddenly shoved through the front door of the puppet house. Like a cuckoo emerging from a clock, her mangled body had been folded to fit through the puppet-sized doorway but then it quickly sprung up to stand at full height. I glimpsed the puppeteer’s silhouette just inside the doorway as the corpse began to sing along with the puppets.

*“You said you were leaving tomorrow…”*

Finally, I managed to force myself awake but it felt like trying to claw my way out of quicksand. I had only slept for about an hour but there’s no fucking way I’m going back to bed tonight. I thought maybe typing it all out would make me tired enough but no such luck.

Any thoughts on what this is all about or advice on how to deal with a recurring nightmare would be greatly appreciated.
