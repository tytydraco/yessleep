We made a mistake today. A beginners folly. We left without warning. We didn't prepare.

Arriving, we walk in as though passing through a mirage. The air about the door shudders and shimmers in undulating waves, rippling outward around the point of our intrusion. A gull circles the parking lot, wings flapping just a little too precisely, adrift a breeze that tastes like vaguely like batteries.

"Whats wrong?"

The hairs on the back of my neck begin to wonder before I do.

The aisles look the same as usual. Stocked meticulously and perused into a haphazard array. Though it doesn't seem to matter, does it? Busy hands touch, but eyes, elsewhere occupied, do not. 

The eyes are with us. 

"What's wrong?" 

A shiver of insistence laces its way through the question and up my spine this time.

Lips pull back in polite smiles. A man lingers by the door. Another by the cash. A cart pushes by, as empty as the face of the mannequin pushing it along. A passing glance becomes a holding stare. Why are they staring? 

Because. 

We left without warning.  

We don't belong here.

And they know it. 

And they watch. 

I'm moving now. Slowed but purposed like a fly quagmired in honey but still savoring the sweetness. 

And in a fleeting thought I recall the taste of arsenic too, is sweet; I read that once. 

Moving.

Watching.

Watched.

The same man appears in far too many aisles to still be empty handed. 

A woman tries on shoes in grocery. 

A child wanders automotive with a too-knowing eye. 

The well dressed couple browses camping gear in shiny shoes yet to touch dirt and gold watches that don't tell time. 

All watching. 

"What's wrong?" 

The air is heavier than it should be, isn't it? I look to see who else notices but their lungs seem unbothered, almost like they're doing no work at all .. almost like .. 

"What's wrong?"

There's not enough noise in here.

The lines are milling and dissipating with no telltale beep to sing out a transaction.

"What's wrong?" 

Wading through a sea of floating apparitions. Wearing street clothes in no correct way. Wearing vapid expressions. Walking like their shoes don't quite fit.

"What's wrong?" 

I think of a hapless swimmer, how they'd gasp when something snares their ankle. 

"What's wrong?"

They would hope it was seaweed.

"What's wrong?" 

A clerk scans my things a little too carefully. 

What's she looking for? 

Why is she taking so long? 

What's wrong? 

I think of airport security.

Do they know?

*What's wrong?*

Do they scan with the same diligence 

The passengers 

That board the planes

That drop from the sky? 

What's wrong?

A tingle in the shape of a noose works its way around my throat. 

We left without warning. 

They didn't have time. 

The standard players weren't ready.

The usual inhabitants were already gone for the day.

This space is populated with 

*. . . something else.*

What's wrong?

I blink in staggered staccato.

What's wrong?

The clerk adorns her very best impression of human concern.

"Nothing. Sorry. Thank you." 

I carry my things to the car. 

The gull no longer circles. 

Instead, perched on a lamppost now, he watches. A little too closely. 

I shut the car door.

A man pushes past with a long line of carts.

I exhale. 

Something on the wind carries a whisper.

*"So close."*
