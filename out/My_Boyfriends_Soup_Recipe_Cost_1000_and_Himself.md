The soup was fine at first.

Creamy, rich. Chicken and garlic. I even thanked him.

But over the next few weeks, he cooked nothing but soup. Every night.

Then one night, I pulled something out with my spoon: a clump of golden hair, still attached to the roots, trailing a fishy stench that made my stomach churn.

That’s when I knew something was wrong and I deserved better than this.

I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 years. He moved in with me this year after quitting his job in another state, and now we live together.

He said he wanted to take a break from work, so he took over the chores while I continued working and paying rent and bills.

His savings ran out six months ago, so I gave him access to my credit card.

Last month, when I got my credit card bill, I noticed he had spent $1000 on a personal account named SoulKitchen. 

I wasn’t sure what SoulKitchen was, it sounded like a porn account, or worse. Either way, it felt wrong. The lease for our apartment was also due that month, and I needed to pay for the next year’s rent.

I held my temper and asked him what the $1000 was for.

His answer pissed me off:
“Nothing special. That’s my privacy.”

I pushed him gently, but he acted like it was something way more serious.

He suddenly cried out and tried to call the police. He’s always overreacting.

I calmed down, apologized, kissed him, and persuaded him to hand over his phone before dialing 911.

He gave me his phone, and later that day, we watched a movie together. I understood that he might need some entertainment since I couldn’t be with him all the time, so I didn’t bring up the $1000 again and assumed everything was fine.

The next day, I came home from work with a bouquet of flowers for him. He had already prepared dinner.

It was soup. Just soup.

I don’t mind soup sometimes. It tasted good, creamy with chicken full of flavor.

I said, “Thank you, babe.”

He smiled gently but said nothing, eating soup across from me, while humming a low and strange tune I'd never heard.

The next day, soup again. Tomatoes and beef. Still nothing else.

The day after, mushroom soup.

I asked, “Why have you been cooking soup lately? Trying new recipes?”

He dropped his spoon, looked hurt, and said, “You don’t like it?”

Knowing he’s sensitive, I reassured him, “No, babe, I’m just curious.”

“I just want to nourish you,” he murmured. I didn’t understand.

Soup every evening continued, and I saw no more strange charges.

Peace seemed to come back. Until last week.

I couldn’t eat soup every day, so I politely asked if he’d try other dishes.

He refused firmly and ignored me.

I don’t remember what we had that day. Maybe I didn’t eat and spilled my soup.

He was startled and finally paid attention.

I asked for an explanation, but he was silent like I was horrible.

That day was stressful at work, I lost my temper and yelled, like any normal person would.

He trembled, scared. But that was on him, he had to take responsibility. I can't stand being ignored, and he knows that perfectly well.

Later, like always after our fights, we made up again. That night, we even had sex twice.

The next day, soup again.

This time, nothing was in front of him. He said he ate before I got home.

I was exhausted and just wanted to finish dinner and sleep. I didn't even notice how bad the soup was until the first spoonful: tasteless, cold, and carrying a strange fishy smell.

After two spoons, I spit something out, a tangled ball of golden hair with roots lying in my palm.

I almost threw up.

I looked at him, he smiled harmlessly, his hair thinner than I remembered. The shadow under his feet twisted to a sharp angle, just for a second.

“Babe, what’s wrong? Don’t you like it?” he asked.

“I’m okay. But are you feeling alright?”

“Of course. Why?”

“Because you’re acting so weird, I think you might be mentally sick, ” I said as I held up the hair.

He said nothing. I insisted he see a doctor. He denied but I pushed because people like him don’t admit illness easily.

I’m a good partner. That’s my duty.

The doctor said he was fine, just sleep-deprived. I don’t know how, since he stays home almost all day except for groceries.

I bought him an Apple Watch the next workday to help monitor his health, and brought it home that evening.

He thanked me without expression, his face was pale.

That night, soup again.

This one had vegetables and even blood sausage, definitely better than the last one.

“Wow, babe, blood sausage? Crunchy.”

He stood in silence, a pair of rubber shoes on his feet.

“Why shoes inside?”

“I was making blood sausage, didn’t want to dirty my pants while cleaning.”

His lips were pale and trembling, like hypoglycemia symptoms.

My instincts told me he was lying. Something was wrong.

The way he acted so indifferent made me suspect he might be cheating.

Then I remembered the SoulKitchen charges and thought the answer was at home.

I secretly took a day off. 

I left home at 8 a.m. as usual and found a seat in a café across the street from our apartment to watch him. Just to see if he was really seeing someone behind my back.

Before I left, I noticed he was already awake, lying there staring at the ceiling without saying a word.

He wore socks to bed last night, which was unusual.

He left, carrying a blue shopping bag. He looked pale, and his steps wavered as if he wasn’t fully there. The shadow beneath him was as pale as he was, and from certain angles, the building's shadow seemed to reshape him, making him look more like a shadow than the real person.

As soon as he disappeared around the corner, I turned back and searched the apartment from top to bottom. Every drawer, every closet, under the bed, behind the curtains. 

But there was no one else there, and no sign of any secrets.

Until I stepped into the bathroom.

Behind the shower curtain, I saw a human-shaped shadow.

I pulled it open quickly. But there was nothing there, just his shoes.

I felt fooled. I picked them up, and a horrible, bloody smell hit me like a punch to the face.

Looking closer, I saw dried blood inside. And two broken toes, cleanly severed.

He had been standing in those shoes all night.

I felt sick to my stomach. 

Maybe that explained his strange, detached behavior. But what about the SoulKitchen? What was that for?

I needed more answers, something to make sense of all this. I remembered the locked drawer in our bedroom. He kept some old family photos and college bills in there.

The contents never changed. I know, because I secretly checked it twice a month. You have to know your partner, right? 

And yet, even with all the effort, I still can't avoid his secrets.

I had just gone through it two weeks ago. But now, I had to be sure.

I found the key in his jacket pocket which was on the sofa.

Strangely, there was a phone in there too.

It was red. His phone is black. He’s had it for years. This wasn’t it.

I grabbed the red one. No password. It unlocked.

There were no messages. No notifications. Just a wallpaper staring back at me.

But he hadn’t cleared the background, or the album.

The gallery opened to a video. One I’d never seen before:

A man, grinning ear to ear, explains calmly while demonstrating in person, how to remove parts of your intestines without dying. 

By the end, he’s holding both the knife and his intestines.

His smile is bright and healthy, that’s what makes it unhealthy.

There had to be more.

I used the key to unlock the drawer in the bedroom.

Beneath the old family photos and faded college bills was something new. It's a single sheet of paper.

A recipe list. Containing thirty days of soup, scrawled in childish handwriting.

Day 1: Cream and chicken.
Day 2: Tomatoes and beef.
Each line followed the exact meals I’d eaten.

I scanned down to yesterday’s entry: "Human toes and vegetables."
The day before: “Hair soup with fish flavor."

Tomorrow’s? 

"Human intestines and eggs." 

That's what the video was for. I want to throw up.

At the bottom, in small, uneven print:
"Thank you for booking through my website.
All tools needed are in the package. 
The recipe will improve the bond between your partner and you. Each of you can gain something.
The toxic, manipulative or unhealthy relationship will be over.
Let the shadow guide you to perfection.
Enjoy it :) 
—SoulKitchen"

So that's what the $1000 was for? What does the paper mean by a "toxic, manipulative or unhealthy relationship"? And why did my boyfriend keep this since our relationship was just fine and healthy?

Sick joke or not, he was following it.

I heard the door knob turning. He was back.

I locked the drawer immediately and crawled into the closet.

I'm not afraid of him at all,  though I didn’t want to face him still. I thought it's a wrong time.

His footsteps wandered the living room, slow and searching. I heard rustling, then the footsteps moved toward the bedroom.

He was going for the recipe. 

Probably realized the key was missing.

I heard someone was swallowing and it wasn't me, though it didn't sound like my boyfriend either.

The closet cracked open.

A faceless shadow with massive horns appeared. Man-shaped, about the same height as my boyfriend , gleaming dark unnatural light, like it had just stepped out of someone's nightmare. 

Now I knew what I'd seen behind the curtain in the bathroom.

It didn't move. Not until I tried to back away. 

It gripped my shoulder.

My whole body felt like it was splitting inside and out, though to my eyes, everything looked normal. I screamed, struggling with all my strength to tear its hands off me.

The pain wanted to tear me in two and pour itself into me. My nerves were shaking violently, I had to summon more strength than I thought possible just to grab a wooden clothes rack and smash it over the shadow’s head.

The grip on my shoulders vanished the moment the rack shattered mid-swing.

The force sent me stumbling backward, right into the closet.

Then I heard a scream from the kitchen.

This time, it sounded like my boyfriend .

I rushed in. The kitchen was still empty.

I glanced at the fridge.

And opened it.

My boyfriend was curled inside.

Pale as a corpse, blood frozen where it had once flowed. The shelves were broken, plastic shards scattered around him. He was unconscious, the scary gashes across his belly were the cause.

In one hand, he loosely held a military knife, caked with frozen blood. In the other, he was holding his own intestines, part still inside him, part spilled out, everything covered in dark red ice. His feet were bare, every toe had been cleanly sliced off.

I gagged, realizing I’d eaten him, which was super disgusting.

He had actually tried to follow the tutorial, and cut himself to make soup for me.

But he didn’t finish, and somehow, he ended up curled in the fridge, twisted into an unnatural pose.

Luckily. Otherwise, I might’ve been the one unconscious on my way to the ER.

I’m sitting here now, in the ER. I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Maybe twelve hours. I haven’t checked the time.

They say he’s still in a coma. That’s the only reason I’ve had time to write all this.

I don't know what the shadow and the whole thing is, but everything seems done now and he had ruined my life, now I have to take care of what’s left of him.

That thought alone makes me sick.

A few minutes ago, I saw doctors and nurses rushing toward his room.

I think I heard someone say a patient was in critical condition.

I stood to check, and that’s when I saw him leaving the ward.

His eyes were empty when they met mine. Then he turned the corner and vanished.

My hands shook with rage. He woke up and just stepped away without telling me, and no one’s explaining anything.

What's his problem?

I swear I have to pace after him and ask directly why he kept the recipe claimed it could fix a toxic relationship. He can't consider our relationship unhealthy.

The shadow behind him crawled up the wall like it was alive, gleaming darkly.

No one else noticed. 

No one ever does.
