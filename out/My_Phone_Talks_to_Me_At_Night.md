I’m blind. You guys might think I’m crazy, but I’m not. I swear I’m not.

It all started on a Wednesday night of all nights. I was just laying in bed, hoping I would fall asleep soon. I have an iPhone XR, yes, in 2025, and it has a built-in voice over. So basically, I’m just laying there, until I hear my phone speak.

“Hi,” it said.

When I tell you I shot up, I shot up. I have no history of being schizophrenic. And I swear I wasn’t dreaming. It was clear as day.

“You’ll get a perfect score on your history test tomorrow,” it said.

“What the fuck is this?” I asked.

There was no reply. I brushed it off as me being crazy. That’s when I got a notification the next morning telling me that my grade was changed to an A.

It was like the phone had predicted my future. Then, it happened again.

This time it was on a Thursday. I’m chilling in my room, headphones on, Vibing to my music. Until the phone speaks.

“Don’t get on the bus tomorrow.”

I immediately paused my music. I wanted to respond to my phone so bad, but I decided not to. I decided that would make me look more crazy.

The next morning, I woke up. I got ready for school. As soon as I stepped out of my house with my cane, the most chillest morning hit me. Perfect temperature. Birds singing.

My best friend Max stepped out of his house.

“Holy shit. Bro, I’ve never seen this kind of morning in my whole life,” he said.

“I know right?”

“You know what? Let’s take my electric scooter to school.”

The idea didn’t seem crazy to me. Especially when my phone said not to go onto the school bus.

“Fuck it. Let’s do this.”

Without another word, Max walked into his house. A few seconds later, I heard the garage door open. Then I heard him driving up to me.

“Get on,“ he said.

I carefully stepped onto the scooter and placed both my feet on it. Then I folded up my cane and placed it in my backpack.

“Let’s do this shit!” I yelled.

“Fuck yeah!” Max yelled back. I quickly wrapped my hands around Max so I wouldn’t fall off the scooter.

As soon as I did that, Max floored it. We instantly sped up. When we drove by the bus stop, the bus was already there.

I tried not to think about the phone incident, but my mind kept racing. What the hell was gonna happen? Why did my phone say not to get on the bus?

We quickly sped past the bus. I decided that nothing was going to happen even though I knew that my phone predicted something last time.

A few minutes later, we arrived at our high school. We had managed to beat our bus. At least, that’s what Max said. Then I heard another bus pulling up.

Then I heard a big thump. Like somebody’s shoes hitting the ground hard. Then footsteps running. Towards us. Passed us.

“Holy shit!” Max said. “Bro, Jackson just jumped out of our moving bus.”

Jackson was what I considered mentally unstable. He once stuck gum in one of my classmate’s shoe. Another time he brought a jar full of honeybees to school. During class, he unleashed the bees. Me and a few of my classmates were lucky to escape out of the door. But a whole lot of other classmates, including the teacher, had to go to the hospital.

And then, I heard it. Screaming. Lots of screaming.

Then I heard what sounded like bus doors opening. Then footsteps. Lots of footsteps. Running.

“Jackson just slit Andre‘s fucking throat!”

I felt my eyes go wide.

Then I heard sirens. Lots of them. Tire screeched. Footsteps running. Then a taser. Then someone dropping to the floor.

The rest of the day was blurred. Interviews. Questions. I tried my best to tell the officer what happened. School was canceled that day. I went to my school’s Facebook page, where I found a post. It was from one of the kids perspectives Who was on the bus.

They said that the whole ride was going perfectly normal. That the pick ups went smoothly. That was until the bus was approaching the school.

They said that as soon as the bus turned into the bus lot, Jackson stood up. He walked over to Andre’s seat, even though the bus driver told him to sit down.

Andre was sitting with his legs poking into the aisle. Jackson proceeded to pull out a knife. Not a kitchen knife, a real knife. Then with one quick motion, he slit Andre‘s throat.

Andre immediately clutched his throat and then stood up and then collapsed. The bus driver slammed on the brakes. Andre‘s body slid down the aisle and slammed into the front of the bus. There was a loud crack. Then Jackson hopped onto Andre‘s seat that was already covered in blood.

Then Jackson slid down the window and then jumped out. While the bus was still in motion. Everyone began to scream. Jackson’s shoes were covered in blood.

He began to run. With every step, he left behind a bloody footprint.

My phone spoke. Again. Today.

“Look outside of your window.”

I’m sitting in my room now. I’m too scared to move. I can hear footsteps pacing back and forth outside of my window. I don’t know what to do. My phone just started to cuss me out. Telling me to look the fuck outside.

If you don’t hear from me in 12 hours, that means I’m dead. And please, if your phone starts to speak to you, throw it away immediately. Don’t do what I did.

Author’s Note: Fun fact. I am actually blind. I wrote this whole story by myself. Just decided I wanted to try something new. If you liked this story, and want me to write something else, DM me and give me an idea and I’ll consider it.
