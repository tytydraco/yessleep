There’s nothing like a good game of truth or dare with your friends.

This was our third game, and it took place in the same spot as the last two, underneath the bridge. It would also be our last, unfortunately.

There was me, Carson and Leah. But just like the last two games, we brought someone new to the third. We would walk around our school and ask fellow students if they wanted to participate in our game. The lucky ones would deny. But some were dumb enough to agree. Of course, they don’t know they were making a dumb decision. But we did. And Cameron was one of those kids.

Me and Carson arrived at the spot early to set up while we waited for Leah to arrive with Cameron. Carson set up the camera while I set up the bottle, rigged to always stop where I wanted it to. Now it was just up to Cameron.

Him and Leah arrived about 10 minutes later, and the game began.

‘’Ladies first.’’ Carson said.

Leah reached over and spun the bottle. It landed on Carson.

‘’Truth or dare?’’ Leah asked.

‘’Ummm…..dare.’’

‘’I dare you…to kiss me.’’

‘’Bet.’’

Carson leaned over and planted a kiss on Leah’s lips. Not an unusual thing for boyfriends and girlfriends to do. But Cameron didn’t know that.

‘’Me next.’’ Carson said. As planned, the bottle landed on me.

‘’Truth.’’ I said.

‘’Is it true, that you wish you could kill someone?’’

‘’I mean I would like to do it again, so yeah. That’s true.’’ I replied while looking straight at Cameron. His eyes went wide. The 3 of us started laughing. After a few seconds of looking at each of us, Cameron started laughing too. Just a joke.

‘’My turn.’’ I said and spun the bottle. It was time. I reached down and picked up the string attached to the end of the bottle. The string was short enough that when I pulled it, the bottle would stop spinning and point right across from me, where Cameron was placed. He didn’t even notice Carson attaching the string before he spun it.

I tugged on the string as I shifted my seated position, as to not make any weird or sudden gestures with just my arm. The bottle stopped at Cameron.

‘’Truth or dare?’’ I said.

Cameron chuckled nervously.

‘’Umm…dare.’’

*Bad choice* I thought. *For you anyway.*

‘’See that cave over there?’’

‘’Yeah.’’

‘’It's said to be haunted by the students who have gone missing at the school. I dare you to walk over there and shout something into it.’’

Cameron looked at Carson and Leah, who shared the same glare that I did.

‘’Uhm…okay.’’

He stood up and started wandering towards the cave. I smiled at my friends. Carson mouthed the words ‘’*got him’’*.

We followed him and watched as he peered into the entrance, hunched over. It was a small cave, but big enough to fit one person. All we needed.

The three of us walked up behind Cameron and I looked at Carson, then at Leah. She nodded, and I removed the gun from my pocket. Carson threw me the suppressor from his pocket.

As Cameron began to shout into the cave, I lifted the gun and aimed at his head. I fired to two shots. He fell forward, his upper body landing a few feet inside the cave.

‘’Any second now.’’ Leah said.

And she was right. No more than 5 seconds later, it appeared. We didn’t have an actual name for it, because we didn’t know what it was. So, we just called it ‘’The Being.’’ It was hairy, like a dog, but stood like a man. It was thin but strong. Strong enough to drag a human body deep into the cave. We watched as it did just that. Cameron’s body disappeared into the darkness. I’d usually follow that with ‘’never to be seen again’’, but unless The Being got rid of him in last hour, the police would probably find Cameron’s body. But I doubt they’ll find the others.

Anyway, the policeman is back, and I have to finish this confession. They really shouldn’t let you type these things on a laptop. You never know where they might end up.
