The first thing I want to share with all of you happened when I was about 12 years old..

&#x200B;

To help you understand and sort of set the scene for you, I need to walk you through the layout of my neighborhood. It wasn't any different than any other neighborhood in America. But there were some particular landmarks and areas within that are important to the story.

&#x200B;

I lived on 18th street. It was the last street in the neighborhood, you could go no farther. If you walked out of my front door and made your way across the street, you would pass my neighbors homes across the road. Behind their properties was an expansive chunk of forest that we spent a ton of time in as kids. We knew those woods like the back of our own hands so to speak.

&#x200B;

I was born in '86. So my childhood consisted of a lot of Nintendo 64 and a ton of time outdoors. Technology wasn't what it is now. We had a family computer, and it was equipped with the internet through AOL. Back then when you got online it would tie up your home phone line. So anytime you were on the internet you could never get or make phone calls, people would just get a busy signal if they tried to call. One of my most nostalgic memories of the internet back then was signing on. Your computer would make a cacophony of noises and you would be met with the standard AOL greeting. Welcome. You've got mail. I still love the memory of that to this day, even though it was quite annoying to be honest.

When I was 13, I wanted a beeper so badly, but my grandmother would not allow it. I even spent my allowance at the mall beeper stand, to buy a black Nike branded beeper case. I never got the beeper that went in it though. She claimed they were for drug dealers or some craziness along those lines. She got me every other machine I could possibly want though. I always had the newest video game consoles and games. I even got her hooked on Crash Bandicoot and Final Fantasy. She was also fond of Bubsy and Dr. Mario.

&#x200B;

She got me a word processor for Christmas one year. I used to set up on that thing staring at the screen, with it's orange colored font, writing story after story, through the wee hours of the night.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, the woods were great. We manifested every kind of grand adventure a child's imagination could possibly fathom or dream of in those woods. We took our girlfriends on walks through them, when we were old enough to start having love interests anyway. We even had a huge rock we would take them to, we all affectionately liked to call, The Kissing Rock. The woods extended far away from the neighborhood and we knew every inch.

&#x200B;

One of our favorite past times in the summer was to trek deep into the far western side of the woods. Where there was an old abandoned stone quarry that was hidden in the forest. When that quarry was active it would have been visible from the road like the one across the other side of that particular road was. The new quarry pit and company marked the end of the woods for the most part on that end. But the older pit across the way had been taken back by nature. It almost seemed hidden or secreted away. Every kid in town that knew about it and was within walking or riding distance, would sneak back there every other day of the summer.

&#x200B;

There had been many bad accidents back there. It was a massive whole in the earth, and it was filled in with water. but the water level stopped short of the rim. Depending on where around the rim you were standing the rock rim just became cliffs. The highest point we would jump from was an area we called, Dead Man's Drop, or just Dead Man's for short. That jump was probably a good 60 to 80 feet. One side we called, The Triangle, had some great 30 and 40 foot jumps, and a lot of exposed rock that was vegetation free. That was where kids would just hang out or build fires at sundown.

&#x200B;

I'll get to the rest of the woods some other time. There is so much about them, and so many times they were the source of our fun, and fear. Countless creepy experiences happened to us all the time back there. Braving them at night was a completely different experience altogether. Between the local urban legends and stories, and just the general spookiness that comes with a forest at night. You would freeze in your tracks at the hoot of an owl, or the snapping of a branch. We would sometimes build fires and tell creepy stories around the fire at night. We would party back there too when we got a bit older.

&#x200B;

And so, now that you have general picture of the area. I want to take you back to 1998. A year earlier the Phoenix Lights had been national news. The Heaven's Gate cult committed their atrocity in a mansion in California. Princess Diana died in a horrible car crash in Paris. Mars Pathfinder landed on the surface of Mars. The first signs of the dreaded Bird Flu in China where the first documented case of the jump to humans causes Hong Kong to kill 1.25 million chickens. The first successfully cloned mammal is revealed by the Roslin Institute. It is revealed to be a 7 month old sheep, it's named Dolly. And the first book in the award winning Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling is published, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone".

&#x200B;

Needless to say it was a strange year leading up to the summer of 1998. It was one of those nights where it's warm and still, and the sky is alive. Heat lightning pulsed through the clouds and it felt like it  could of been storming if the conditions were slightly different. It was about 10:30 at night, and a handful of kids hung out under the street light on the corner. I'm sure a few creative ways to share new curse words were shared. General child-like chaos that comes with the absence of an adult presence ensued. I couldn't tell you everything we did that night while we hung out on our darkened street. But that is where it happened.

&#x200B;

Mid-sentence the quiet night air exploded around us. The sound of the explosion was so loud that you felt it in your bones. It vibrated you to your core and drove us like a herd of cattle stampeding away from danger. The instant the explosion happened we were robbed of our sight and thrust into a darkness that was like being in the dark expanse of space. As far as the eye could see we were robbed of our sense of safety, robbed of the light. Even the porch lights on all the houses had went. It was a complete blackout of the power grid on our side of town.

&#x200B;

I was so terrified I ran shakily back to my house. It felt as though I levitated there in slow motion. Flanked on either side by my little brother, my best friend, and a couple other kids. We ran for our lives, we genuinely felt a primal level of fear set in with that explosion. After gathering back our wits and regrouping mentally. And after making sure we all still had ten fingers and ten toes. We began to slowly make our way back outside and into the road. Braving the darkness to try and get a feel for what had just happened to us.

&#x200B;

I don't know who noticed the next thing first, but an incredible sight lay before us. Out there across the road, looking all the way back to the tree line of those black woods. About 8 to 10 feet high up in the tree line was what looked like a window. A window in the woods. Lit by an internal fire, it glowed a vibrant amber color. What was terrifying about that image was that it was unobstructed. Not a single branch of a tree or anything at all for that matter, obstructed the window. If it even was a window. Matter a fact I know it wasn't a window, like I said before, we knew those woods better than our bedrooms. And there were no structures back there.  Not in that area and not for miles.

&#x200B;

The next day we went back there to look around and we couldn't find anything that suggested that anything weird had ever happened there at all. That next night the street lights were back on, and the window in the woods was back too. It returned nightly for over a week that summer. And for that week of the summer we exhausted all the possibilities, we explored and figured until our minds gave up and just accepted the fact.

&#x200B;

I wish I had answers to what happened back then.  But I doubt I will ever know what truly caused the high strangeness of that terrifying week during the summer of 1998. Next time I will tell you about the time we had a kid from the area go missing for eight days. And how that led to us suspecting one of our long time neighbors of being a serial killer. And how that led to one of the worst winters of my life. Thank you for listening, keep your eyes peeled, and never make the mistake of thinking you know everything about something so familiar. Because sometimes strange things happen, and sometimes something so familiar to you, can be absolutely terrifying.
