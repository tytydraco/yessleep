It started ordinarily enough. A Costco at night, the warehouse humming with that particular late-evening energy, sparse enough to feel spacious but populated enough to remain grounded in normalcy. I walked through the entrance alone, the fluorescent vastness stretching before me in familiar aisles of bulk goods and oversized packaging.

Then I saw the elevator.

It stood immediately to my left, unremarkable except for one detail: I couldn't recall ever seeing a two-story Costco. Still, there it was. I stepped inside and pressed the button, expecting the mild stomach-lift of ascent.

Instead, I dropped.

The sensation hit immediately, that unmistakable downward pull, the floor seeming to fall away beneath my feet. Confusion gave way to nervousness. A basement, I thought. Just a basement. Storage, maybe. Receiving docks. Something reasonable.

But the elevator didn't stop.

It continued down. Past where any basement should end. Past any logical depth. The descent stretched on, and with each passing second, my nervousness curdled into something colder. I jabbed at the buttons, all of them, hoping one would halt this plunge into the earth. Nothing responded. The elevator maintained its inexorable descent, the cable whirring somewhere in the darkness above.

That's when I noticed the panel.

Forty-seven floors. The number glowed there in cruel specificity. And the button for the forty-seventh floor was lit, burning like an accusation. Forty-seven floors down. The mathematics of it overwhelmed me. How deep was I going? How far beneath the surface world? What could possibly exist at such a depth beneath a Costco parking lot?

The descent felt endless, a sustained plunge into some subterranean hell, until finally, mercifully, terribly the elevator began to slow. The whirring diminished. The mechanism settled with a mechanical sigh.

Ding.

The sound was obscene in its normalcy.

The doors opened.

What stretched before me defied comprehension. A town, or the skeleton of one. Vast and flat and utterly empty. Buildings stood at intervals, but they were wrong, two-dimensional somehow, lacking depth or texture, like cardboard facades on a film set that had been abandoned mid-construction. No cars. No people. No movement at all except the slow drift of fog across the lifeless ground.

I stepped out, compelled by a curiosity that overrode my mounting terror.

The air was frigid. Each breath materialized in thick clouds of steam. Above me, where sky should be, there was only darkness, and within it, black clouds that moved like ink diffusing through water, shapeless and wrong.the

I turned back to look at the elevator I'd emerged from, following its structure upward. It rose as an infinite column, a tower of industrial metal and fluorescent light that climbed and climbed until it simply vanished into the black above. There was no top. No ceiling. Just an impossible architecture that suggested I'd descended not into earth, but into somewhere else entirely.

In the near distance, a gas station stood beneath sickly white fluorescent tubes, the only other source of light in this place. But it was generic, featureless, bearing no brand or signage. Just the crude suggestion of a gas station, stripped of all identifying detail.

Then I saw it move.

Near the station, a figure. Black and humanoid, with the blocky proportions of a default character model from some forgotten game. Life-sized. Featureless. The surface caught what little light there was, reflecting it with the dull sheen of plastic. I approached, drawn by the only other presence in this desolate expanse.

It began to sink through the floor.

Not falling. Phasing. Descending through solid ground as though reality here operated on different principles entirely. I watched it disappear, my skin crawling.

When I looked back at the sky, something else was there.

A shape. Massive and slow-moving, barely distinguishable from the darkness itself but undeniably present. And the sound it made a deep, resonant rumbling that I didn't just hear but felt, vibrating through my bones, my teeth, the cavity of my chest. It was the sound of something so large that its mere existence was a threat. Every animal instinct I possessed screamed at me to run.

I bolted back to the elevator, jamming my finger against the buttons, desperate for ascent. Nothing. The mechanism was dead, or worse, designed for one purpose only. This elevator went down. Only down.

Panic set in fully now. I spun, scanning the impossible horizon of this prop-world, and there, far in the distance, a pinprick of white light. Another elevator. It had to be. The one that went up.

I started running across the flat expanse, the rumbling still resonating through the air, that massive shape drifting somewhere above in the ink-stained sky. The cold bit at my lungs. The distance refused to close quickly enough.

And then, mercifully, I wrenched myself awake.

But the image remained: forty-seven floors down, and that infinite column rising into nothing, and the certain knowledge that somewhere beneath a Costco parking lot, that place is still there. Waiting. Empty.

Always empty.
