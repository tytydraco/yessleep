What I’m about to describe is my personal account of an accident that happened about six years ago in Utah. If you’re from the area, you might have heard about it on the local news. For whatever reason, it never made national headlines—one of my theories being that it got overshadowed, as a massive political scandal was happening at the time, but I don't have an explanation. It’s as if the world simply brushed it off and continued onwards. But not us.

To our school, it was a tragedy that caused years of mourning. It broke families and took away best friends. A haunting event that, to this day, nobody fully understands.

Nobody except me.

I never told anyone what really happened that night. Partly because I never had a solid reason to, but mostly because my story is so absurd it borders on unbelievable. I figured people would write it off as trauma-induced delusion and told myself not to bother trying to convince them. So, I buried it—kept it to myself for years. The authorities knew the when and where and families got to bury their loved ones. It was officially chalked up to a freak incident of nature.

And in a twisted way, they weren’t wrong.

So in a way, you could say I wasn’t hurting anyone by hiding the truth. Today, however, I’ve decided to finally share what I’ve kept hidden for so long. Keep in mind, I don’t know how to explain what happened and you might end up just as confused as I am. Whether you choose to believe me or not is up to you.

It was the end of our final year of middle school. I was around 15 at the time. Exams were done, the stress was behind us and summer vacations loomed. Despite that, some of us were sad to leave our small private school in California, especially that it had a family feel that I hadn’t experienced before, given the number of students was lower than in an average educational facility. I moved schools often due to my parents’ constant relocation, but this place felt different than any school I had attended before.

To celebrate and shake away the bitterness, people started talking about organizing something fun before we inevitably parted ways. There were talks of going to New York—maybe even an ambitious trip to Europe or Asia, but the organizers ran into too many issues trying to plan something on that scale. That’s when someone suggested a wildlife resort in Utah called the Brown Coyote Resort. It wasn’t as exciting as the other options, but it felt safe, easy to organize, and a chance to spend time in nature—something us city kids could really use. Surprisingly, it was also cheap for what looked like a luxury resort to most of us. It had pools, bowling alleys, cozy wooden lodges, and natural scenery that anyone could appreciate—it all sounded perfect.

About a week later, we were on a bus packed with teenagers, excited and carefree, awaiting an adventure in Utah. We had no idea what was coming and frankly, I really miss that time.

The first day went smoothly. We arrived tired after a long ride. Teachers handed out room assignments, sparking the usual complaints and attempts to switch with other students. Some were already plotting to sneak into other rooms at night. We ate dinner that was waiting for us, unpacked, and spent some time in the outdoor pools and game areas. I was playing volleyball in the pool with a few other students and two teachers—one for each team. We weren’t allowed to use a real ball because our caretakers feared we’d break windows or hurt other guests, so we used a beach ball instead. I was exhausted after a long day and eventually got out to dry off. Just then, someone hit the ball too hard, and a gust of wind carried the air filled object beyond the resort’s fence, toward the woods. Since I was already dry and outside the pool, everyone nagged me to get it. I hopped the fence and looked for the ball. I saw it near a small cabin, probably rented by other guests.

I picked it up and was about to return when something caught my eye deep in the woods. A pair of glowing eyes stared back at me from the darkness. I jumped and squinted my eyes, trying to make sure I wasn't just seeing things. I couldn’t make out what it was exactly. The figure seemed roughly human-sized, but the thick darkness skewed my efforts to determine its size. The only detail I could really make out was that it was bipedal and stood completely still, as if studying my every move.

“Did you fall asleep out there?!” someone yelled, snapping me out of my trance. I was about to head back to the resort, but turned to face the woods one last time.

The eyes were gone.

That night, some guys in my room schemed to sneak into the girls’ room on the other side of our hallway and brainstormed a plan on how not to get caught. I was too tired to entertain it and decided to just call it a day—my friends called me a killjoy for it. Still, my mind kept circling back to what I saw. Was it just a reflection? A hallucination? An animal? At that point, I wasn’t entirely sure. Eventually, exhaustion won and I drifted off to sleep.

Day Two: We were forced to sit through a lecture about local wildlife from one of the seemingly sleep-deprived guides. Of course, even weeks before graduation, our school needed an excuse to make this trip educational in the dullest and most uninspired way possible. After what felt like forever, finally, something interesting happened. The guide decided to show us a live feed from a nearby protected area. It was deer season, and we saw a few of them grazing around.

I zoned out a bit, watching the peaceful animals living their lives on a sunny day surrounded by nature. It was way more entertaining than listening to a middle-aged man in dire need of coffee. That was, until something spooked the deer and caused them to run off into the distance. Every one of us seemed to notice—even the guide paused his lecture.

He chalked it up to coyotes or another predator making noise, maybe even one of the deer snapping a twig and scaring the others, though the camera had no audio to confirm any of those theories. To me, however, something felt horribly wrong about the whole situation. It didn’t look like they were spooked by a noise. It looked like pure panic, like something truly terrifying just happened off-screen. My stomach twisted into knots. I tried to dismiss it as lingering anxiety from the night before, but I couldn’t shake off the weird feeling that stuck with me long after that moment. It was almost like some primal instinct inside me was trying to send me a warning. The two reflective marbles in the woods were still staring into my soul in my memory. I barely remember the rest of the day. My focus was all over the place, and the memory of the activities is quite foggy to me. I couldn’t sleep much that night either.

Day Three was more relaxed. We visited some monuments, explored rare plant life, and spent time at a nearby lake. Some of us even got to ride sailboats. For a brief moment, I felt like a kid again—away from the dread that had been following me lately. It was exactly what I needed to ease my nerves. It was a great time.

The fourth day—the last—was meant to be free. We could enjoy the resort however we liked. That evening, we went on a short hike along a safe trail, accompanied by some teachers and resort workers. We split into two groups and played a game to make things a bit more fun before ending the trip. One group would write challenges on paper for the other group to find and record themselves doing, my group being the one that was to brainstorm the tasks. The guides were to make sure the papers were easy to find and wouldn’t drift off somewhere and pollute the environment.

It proved to be quite effective at entertaining us. Everyone was laughing and trying to come up with funny or surreal challenges. A lot of times our teachers had to step in, as some suggestions were either inappropriate or too extreme—something to be expected from teenagers. During that activity, however, I couldn’t shake off the feeling we were being followed, but seeing everyone else so carefree, I forced myself to ignore it.

I wanted to enjoy the last days with my classmates before parting ways after graduation. I didn’t want to let my paranoia ruin that for me. After all, this was the last time I would see everyone in this setting—a chance to build memories I would never get back. With that in mind, I tried all I could to relax and join my friends in suggesting funny things for the notes we left.

It was then I saw something that made my heart jump into my throat. The guide immediately stopped us, and even they went pale. It was a corpse of a deer, lying right in the middle of the trail. To say the body was massacred would be an understatement. It had claw marks on its side—two of which were especially huge and deep, followed by bite marks all over its neck, with a ton of flesh ripped off. It was especially shocking, as we were told this area was free of bears and cougars, and the smaller predators in the area wouldn’t have been capable of such assault. The placement of the body also felt very wrong. It was almost as if something had dragged it there on purpose knowing we would be passing through eventually.

To add salt to the injury, one of our teachers received a phone call that changed the entire tone of the event. Two of our classmates from Group 2 had gone missing. They were a pretty well-known couple at our school. The girl—let's call her Vanessa—was a big adrenaline junkie, and the two of them were known for being irresponsible. It was easy to imagine her convincing her boyfriend to sneak off somewhere once the guides weren’t looking. Idiotic, but completely on-brand for them.

Given all the developments, the staff decided to call the game off and head back to the resort. Police and rescue teams were contacted. Some of us were allowed to help search the safer areas, while trained professionals searched deeper into the woods. I joined the search for a while. We called their names, used flashlights, they brought in police dogs and even helicopters. But the hours ticked by with no results. Eventually, some of us, including me, grew too exhausted to continue, and we were escorted back to the Brown Coyotes.

Back inside, I sat in a room with a few other kids. Only one teacher and the receptionist were around. We were mostly unsupervised and still scared, but also oddly carefree in the way only tired, traumatized teens can be. We used the moment to play games and stay up late despite everything. It was our last attempt to salvage something from this trip. We talked about what might have happened to them. Some mentioned the deer corpse. Others said they felt a presence following them during the hike. It seemed I wasn’t the only one who had that gut feeling. Still, I stayed quiet.

By 1 a.m., I’d had enough. The entire situation didn’t mix well with the anxiety I’d been feeling since day one. Thinking back now, I don’t know why I never told them about the eyes I saw in the woods. I guess I’ve always had a bad habit of keeping important things to myself.

After the conversations turned more stressful, I made my way back to my room. It was empty and silent. I opened one of the windows and took a few deep breaths. The warm air felt nice, and the view was calming to my overstimulated brain. I could see an empty road faintly lit by a few streetlamps. In the distance stood the forest, and beyond that, the mountains. Everything seemed peaceful, like all the commotion had paused just for this one moment.

I knew that somewhere in those woods were rescuers, police, teachers, resort staff, and my classmates—probably worried sick. I couldn’t imagine what it was like to be one of the teachers in this situation. I sat there for a while, because being alone was exactly what I needed at that moment.

It was then I saw something move in the distance.. 

It walked alongside the road. At first, I couldn’t tell whether it was an animal or a human, but as it got closer, I began to recognize its features. It walked on two legs and was roughly the height of a tall human—maybe six feet. But its silhouette was much more than just tall. It was long. Reptilian in shape, with a lizard-like snout, bulky legs, and a long tail. Its head bobbed slightly in a bird-like manner as it moved and in its jaws, it carried something long.

As it passed beneath one of the streetlamps, its form became even more horrifyingly clear.

Its body was covered in dusky gray feathers, darker along its spine. Its snout was stained crimson with blood. Its arms ended in three razor-sharp claws, and long feathers along its forearms gave the illusion of wings. Its powerful legs ended in talons, each foot featuring one massive raised and hooked claw. It looked sharper than a kitchen knife. In its partly opened jaws, I saw a set of glistening teeth gripping a human leg dressed in ripped light denim jeans—the same jeans I remembered Vanessa wearing earlier that day.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. I was frozen, staring as it carefully placed the leg under the streetlamp, almost as if it wanted us to find it, playing a twisted game of intimidation.

Then it looked around, its head twitching in sharp, birdlike movements. It scanned its surroundings, until it looked directly at.. me.

I ducked beneath the window, my heart pounding. It saw me. 

I began hyperventilating, my mind spinning out of control. Fight or flight kicked in as I quickly sprang into a different empty room fearing it might try to break in through the fragile window. I pushed a dresser in front of the door to barricade myself and crawled under the bed. It was all I could think to do.

Then I remembered—I wasn’t the only one in the building.

I tried to force myself to move, to warn everyone. But it was too late. The first screams rang out from downstairs. The floor was wooden so it carried vibrations very well, giving me a horrifying insight into the scene downstairs. One by one I heard bodies slamming against the ground, screams and cries for help one by one dying down. I heard attempts to flee, followed by more thuds against the wooden floor. Whether it was looking for me or not, it already made its way inside and managed to kill a bunch of people.

I wanted to run. I wanted to save them. I wanted to steal a car and be anywhere else but here. But all I could do was sit there, frozen, and listen to a massacre unfold beneath me.

I've heard loud stomps. Whatever was walking along the hallway outside my room now was too heavy to be a human. I could hear a sound of low rumbling and clicking—almost like I was listening to a bass boosted emu combined with a grizzly bear or an alligator, sending unnatural vibrations throught my body. 

One by one the steps edged closer. It wasn’t moving at random—it was listening. I could hear it pause every few steps, soaking in the silence, as if waiting to catch the faintest sign of life. Each still moment stretched like an eternity, the tension growing to unbearable levels. For whatever reason, the creature kept emitting weird low frequency sounds, which I could feel almost in my skeleton. To my detriment—I could barely control how much my body was shaking and how hard it was to mask my terrified breaths. I tried to cover my mouth with my hand as I panicked over whether this thing could actually hear me or not. 

Thats when it started. The scratches. I could feel my heart pounding so hard it threatened to jump out of my chest, while the razor sharp claws of my pursuer began studying the entrance to my room. It knew where I was and was now trying to figure out how to get inside. How to get to ME. I heard the door handle go down slowly as the only thing blocking them was the dresser. Realizing its efforts weren't enough, I heard it pounding on the door as if it was trying to kick its way through. Loud slam, followed by another. I was convinced I was reaching my final moments alive. My life flashed in front of my eyes as I heard the monster pounding on the door. I wasn't ready to die. Not like this. 

As it seemed the doors might give in soon, out of nowhere another scream could be heard. It seemed like one of the girls sleeping in a room near me decided to check on the noise and witnessed the monstrosity punding on my door with force. I've heard an attempt to run followed by quick heavy steps and a loud slam against the the floor once again. Sounds of agony came next. There wasn't a roar or even a growl like one would expect a monster like this to make. Just quick and precise assault of what seemed like a definition of an apex predator. Another innocent life taken away, I could hear the girl begging for help as the thing was likely eating her alive pinning her against the ground with its talons. Seeing the sheer size of them, I can't even imagine the pain she must have been feeling at that moment. The struggle slowly became lesser and lesser as the only thing left was a sound of flesh being ripped off and chewed on. 

After what felt like an eternity, it began moving again. For whatever reason, the heavy footsteps slowly faded into the distance… until there was only silence. Shortly after that, someone opened the front door and shouted a loud “Oh God”. The others were back to witness the massacre that had transpired downstairs. The monster must have realized more humans were coming back and fled. It is only thanks to that I lived to see another day. 

Everything after that is a blur. I remember the hospital. The questions. The numbness. The crushing weight of realization.

Seven people died that night—including the missing couple. Their bodies were later found deep in the forest, unrecognizable. I could have warned someone, said something, anythibg.. but I never did. Now I have to live with that. 

The official report? A bear attack. They claimed a black bear wandered into the resort and felt threatened. They even speculated there might have been multiple bears, considering the body count.

What a joke.

But it seemed to be enough to give people closure. The Brown Coyote resort shut down after that. Ironically, you won’t find any information about it online. Thinking back, if anyone in the government knew the truth, they probably did cover it up to avoid panic. That might explain the lack of media coverage. I mean, six out of seven people who lost their lives that night were mere children, thinking about it now, I can't believe how this managed to slip under the radar. 

Our school mourned. It was the worst tragedy in its history.

I never left California after that. Despite everything, I graduated high school. I’ve avoided forests like a plague for the past six years. Recently however, I was forced to find a new place to live—and I found the perfect apartment on the outskirts of my hometown. The only downside? Its close proximity to a nearby forest. I didn’t want to take it, but my poor economic situation left me with little choice.

Every time I look at those trees… I feel them staring back. It could just be trauma. It most likely is. But that doesn’t change one thing:

The creature that killed my friends that night… was intelligent enough to remember the one human it left behind.
