My job as a utility locator was a fun time. Getting to drive everywhere and getting to see the different walks of life had me on complete thrills every day. The farmsteads I got to see on a regular basis were fascinating, but one stands out like a sore thumb to this day still that I cant forget!!!!

&#x200B;

It was a fresh, crisp fall day in October. I woke up for the day, anxious to see my work load and too also see where my tracks would be set. I opened my work phone, opened my work app and patiently waited for the jobs to load. 17 sites, two of them in the middle of NOWHERE!

"Great, got to put those first!" I said to myself, as I got ready to head out the door

I got into my vehicle and made the 25mi journey to the first farm house, not knowing what awaited me. As I pulled up, I noticed a strange heavy feeling. You know that feeling when you are being watched, but you don't know where, yeah, that's the feeling I got when I pulled up.

"Good morning, just here to locate some lines for you so you can do your work" I said to the homeowner as he walked out of the door to greet me!

"Okie dokie. just be mindful of the barn area, lots of nails and stuff!" Dan, the farm owner said, as he went back inside

I hooked up my gadgets and went about my duty, paying no attention to the outside world. Thats when I notice a strange odor in the air. It wasn't that pungent animal smell, but a sweet one. The ones you get with an older perfume or cologne.

I got near the barn area and noticed the door was wide open, but didn't see anything. I love old barns, they always have a great, old smell that tickles my nose! I decided to put my machines down and take a stroll through. Circa 1900s barn, nicely kept up and still had the old look.

That sweet, deep smell was back. I turned around and saw her. I didn't know if she was the wife or someone of my imagination. She was wearing an old style dress, probably 1920s era. She gave one glance at me and faded into the morning light. That's when I knew I was dealing with the supernatural and not a real person.

I went up to the door of the house and politely knocked. The farm owner came to the door with a concerned look.

"Is everything ok?" He asked

"Yeah, everything is fine. I just had a general question about the barn! Its definitely old and I'm into those older, historical buildings and the such!" I said, with a smile on my face.

"That barn has been in my family since the 1800s. Lots of history and it's got some dark stuff to tell as well. Not many people know about the murder/suicide that happened in there, but some nights you can still hear the effects of it!" He chatted

"I would love to hear more about this barn. Here's my number, call anytime! I have to get back to it! It was a pleasure meeting you!" I said, shaking his hand

I didn't want to tell him what I saw just yet! Maybe it was a distant relative, but I wanted to keep it under wraps until I got clear confirmation if was able to investigate the barn.

Well, I got my wish. The homeowner called me later that day and told me I could walk around the barn at night, but warned me of the cattle that stay in the corrals. He said the cattle, when spooked, make a wailing sound that'll scare anyone away.

That first part of the night was uneventful, but the worst part was coming and I wasn't prepared for what is about to happen! At just about midnight, that undulating smell came back, sweeter than it was before, but it had a sickening stench to it. She was here!!!!!

A clatter came from behind me near the barn door and I spun around to see nothing!

"Who's here!?" I said, hoping to hear a reply!

No response. I continued through the barn, searching high and low, looking at the old framework, admiring how beautiful of a barn it was, even if my only source of light was my flashlight.

Another sound, this time in the form of a loud bang

I stopped!! I quietly ducked behind a stack of hay and waited for whoever it was to go away!! 

 FOOTSTEPS, I hear footfalls getting closer. The breathing, the deep, shallow guttural breathing made my skin crawl. I poked my head around the bales, I should have never done that!

There, in the moons light, she was standing! She didn't have the same complexion as when I first saw her. But this time she was in worse shape! Her skin was grey and shaggy, her clothes were tattered and ripped! What stood out the most was the rope like bruising around her neck!!

Her and I locked eyes for a few, horrifying moments! She didn't have eyes, just black sockets! Then, she raised an arm and pointed a finger at me!

In that moment, my throat clinched and I couldn't breathe! It felt like she had a hold of my neck, squeezing the life from me!!!! I tried to move, but couldn't. I was stuck in this scary situation for a good ten minutes before she lowered her arm and the hold released!!!!

She flashed a smile and pointed up to the top of the barn, where there was a third level. I quickly realized that she was the relative of the farm owner that was killed! She was showing me where she had died. She lowered her arm and faded away into the night. 

I got up and continued up the top level of the barn. She was there, I knew she was! As I got to that level, everything changed! It got heavier and darker, and I couldn't walk without feeling like I was walking in a pool. 

I didn't feel right up here. I quickly took a picture and bolted. I got back down to the second level and checked my camera! What I caught changed my mind on everything! 

There in the foreground was a man, early 40s, overalls and watching me from the back corner! He had a look of complete hatred and disdain. I could feel his rage from just the photo. Thats when I knew, he was the husband of that woman and he's probably coming after me as well.

It was around 4am when I decided to pack up and head for home! I was a very interesting but terrifying night! But apparently that man wasn't going to let me leave without stirring up his own problems.

As I got up to leave, I noticed a wet area near me I hadn't noticed before! I checked myself to see if I ran into anything and that is when I felt the long scratches on my leg! I quickly shinned my flashlight on them and they were deep! 

"So you want to cause issues! Well, you are a coward for killing your wife then yourself! Thats what I think of you!" I shouted, knowing this entity could hear me! I SHOULD have never said that.

More footsteps, but this time behind me! I felt it get real cold, then the hands of a man grab me from behind.

I tried to get away but it was too late! He had me by the neck, strangling me! We locked eyes and I knew I was in for a fight after provoking him. He grinned the most sickening, frightening smile ive ever seen.

I don't know how long I was caught in this sadistic, paranormal grip but I woke up to the farm owner hovering over me!

"OH MY GOD" I yelled, seeing him as I opened my eyes.

"You ok?? We woke up to you screaming. What happened?" He asked with a look of concern

"Haha you'll never believe me if I told you!" I said, with a tired look

"Come inside and have some breakfast and coffee! We'll let you calm down and then you can tell us all about it!" He exclaimed, helping me up and walking me inside!

After I ate my fill, I proceeded to tell them everything that happened, from the moment I got there for work to the time he came to me after it all transpired. The face on this man went from understanding to absolute terror.

"I should have warned you! My Uncle killed his wife in the 30s. He was a very evil, abusive human being! Jennifer, his wife, tried to leave. He beat her, dragged her out to that same barn, hung her up in the rafters on the third level then turned on himself!" He said as he drank his coffee

"I'll tell you, that was the worst experience I've ever had! I think his wife was trying to warn me, but I didn't heed it in the end and paid for it!" I said, exhaling.

"You probably did, he didn't like people he didn't like or know in his space! Jennifer, however, if she liked you from the start, welcomed you in with open arms!" Dan said, with a tear in his eye.

From that day forward, I went back a few times to say hello to them, but ill never step foot back in that barn, no matter how many times I see Jennifer, welcoming me with a smile!!!!
