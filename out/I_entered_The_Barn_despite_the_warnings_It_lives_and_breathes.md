I live on a farm on the outskirts of the county. It's a small town, around 500 of us total, but I enjoy the humble and quiet life that comes along with it. I live alone, but I do have some pets- though that would've been obvious, no? I have 2 cats who I keep indoors, 2 guard dogs, a herd of sheep, 3 horses, some cows, and a plentiful amount of chickens. Of course, I do have some other animals as well, but I'm sure that me listing off the names of all my animals isn't an entertaining way to spend your evening.

My routine is simple. Wake up, do whatever I need to for the day, eat, sleep. Clean the stables, feed the animals, check on the crops- all boring farm work. And that's what my life was. Boring. Utterly and pathetically boring. I'm not going to go on a rant and say that I detested the repetitive routine of my day to day life, but in short, it wasn't the most amusing being. 

That was until all this happened.

It was early morning, around 6 a.m. My alarm was screaming into my ears, shouting at me to wake up. I groaned and sat up, smashing my finger repeatedly onto my phones screen as I groggily tried to shut it up. It finally went silent after after a few more finger-breaking hits. 

"Stupid morning," I mumbled under my breath, getting to my feet with a sigh. Stretching out my arms, I walked over to my closet with a sigh. Tossing the old wooden doors open, I grabbed a clean, black sweater and a pair of jeans that didn't have a hole in the middle. Work on the farm was rough, and it had only been a year since I'd inherited this farm from my grandfather. He'd died mysteriously, and a lot of rumors surrounded his death in what actually happened. 

He had been found dead near the barn house out back, right near the edge of the property of his land. His best friend had found his sprawled out on the grass, his eyes wide open and mouth gaping in horror, as if my grandpa had seen some eldritch horror before his demise. The only thing he had left behind in his utterly decimated room was the will saying ownership of any and all things left behind went to me, including the farm. 

There had also been a poorly hand-written note shoved in the envelope along with the will. In barely legible letters, the words, "DON'T ENTER THE BARN." were scribbled across the half torn paper. I didn't care. I wasn't close to my grandpa after he had all but kick my dad out when he decided to go against his wishes and marry my mom. I never met him- neither wished to -which was why him giving everything to me was such a shock.

Not like I didn't take advantage of that. Sure, I never knew the man, but if he wanted me to get his fortunes? Pfft. Who am I to complain?

I ignored the note, and ignored his death, choosing to be smart for once in my life and take heed to his advice. He dies right next to the barn and a mysterious note about not entering the barn is found with his will? Then hell no, I'm not some protagonist in a horror movie. To hell with all that.

**How ironic that I did it anyway.**

I had finished up with all my duties and it was night now. The moon was shining overhead, a beautiful light watching over me and guiding me with its brightness. As I put some food in my guard dogs bowls, I heard a sound akin to something heavy falling off a high shelf. I was pretty far into the farm (it really was a large farm) and away from my house, so it couldn't have possibly come from my home, unless I'd somehow grew super senses- which I did contemplate for a minute before remembering people get admitted into psych wards for thoughts like these. 

The only place close enough for there to be a crash and it be audible to me was the barn.

"Nah. Not in the mood to die," I said to myself as I rose from my crouch and began the walk back to my house. That was when I heard it.

"CAZ!!! HELP!! *HELP!!*" A female voice screamed from the barn, her voice oddly flat for someone seeming to be in so much distress.

It took another scream or two for me to realize I recognized that voice.

"Mum?" I asked quietly, slowly inching closer to the barn.

The screams only intensified, a strange and nauseating gurgling noise accompanying the shouts of despair, as if hell itself had opened its mouth and began singing a symphony to those who dared listen.

I stepped back warily before taking two unwilling steps forward. It was like the screeches that were coming from the barn had wrapped their tendrils around me and were pulling me forward, saying, "Look at us. We are here. Come help up."

I slowly inched forward, the sounds of my mom's yells slowly morphing into the bellows of something more inhuman. More atrocious. The voice grew deeper, more gargled and raspy then before, but I couldn't bring myself to turn away. To stop advancing.

And soon enough, I was right in front of the barn.

All the farm animals had already fled, skittering away like flies from a trap. It's widely known that when all goes silent in a forest and no animals are around, something bad is likely to follow. This felt like the same thing, but more sinister. I swallowed and looked the barn over. A normal small wooden barn, painted red. Though for some reason, the paint on the wood seemed wet, a bit too much of a bloody texture for my already unneased mind.

The shrieks for help seemed quieter than before, which was unusual, seeming as how one would've expected the yelling to be louder as they got closer. It had died down to more of a pitiful whimpering sound that dug deep into my soul and grabbed ahold of all sane instincts inside me. I didn't remember even raising my hand before I had shakily grabbed the handle of the barn door, slamming it open. My whole body was covered in a sheet of sweat when I couldn't have felt colder.

And just like that, all went quiet.

Even the wind seemed to cease it's calming whistling, stopping to watch me, as if a mockery of my decision. 

"H-hello...?" I called out into the pitch black expanse of the barn. I couldn't see the end to it. Maybe it was just a trick of light since it was nighttime, but it looked as if the barn had no end. Despite my earlier concession of being a smart person, I stepped into the barn. It was far larger than it looked like from the outside, but it was desolate. It took me a moment to even realize what I was staring at- and to realize the inside of the barn was made of cement. Cement walls, floor, and what I assumed was a ceiling, though it was too dark for me to tell.

*Impossible. The barn is made of wood. Not cement.*

Nothing happened and for a moment I contemplated whether I was possibly having some kind of schizophrenic episode- *Have I finally gone insane?* -when there was a small scrape.

Raising my head, I squinted in the darkness, looking at the far wall of the barn. Wait. I couldn't see that wall before. I took a step back. The wall inched forward. It moved. Sliding across the floor with the sound of nails against chalkboard. Then stopped as I did. My heart was threatening to claw out of my heart, each beat against my ribs the equal to a bird trying to escape its cage. I took another step back, not daring to look back at where I was going. Not wanting to take my eyes off *whatever* this was. 

It moved forward again. Slightly. Just the same amount I had.

I gasped for breath, taking another step back. It was breathing. It's surface expanding and contracting like a humans breath. There was a soft sound coming from it too, the sound of a breath being taken and exhaled. The wall was alive.

"***Ruuuuuuunnnnn***" 

It moved forward but this time didn't stop. Rushing towards me and closing in on me faster than even a human could move. The rough walls exterior moved back and forth and it's breath turning quicker, a weak pant, like a humans breath after exerting themselves by running.

I barely let out a whimper as I turned and sprinted to the door, the wall rushing behind me, nipping at my heels like an excited dog.

*I wasn't this far from the door. I only took one step in. Why am I this far?*
*I'm going to die.*

I threw myself outside the barn and tumbled on the grass for a few beats before halting. I stared up at the night sky, my heart pounding and my breathing so quick it would put a fan to shame. Slowly I looked over to the barn. The wall that had come after me was right there, pushing at the door of the barn. The wood had begun to crack slightly under the pressure, splintering and moving outwards like a volcano ready to explode.

I quickly got up and backed away, slowly at first, then stumbling to a sprint, my legs pumping to get me as far from the barn as possible.

The last thing I heard before I sped off in my car was the groan of wood breaking into pieces and a voice all too human.
"NO! COME BACK!"

I didn't. I didn't even bother looking behind me as I drove away. 

It's been 2 weeks since that incident, and I can't get any sleep. I refuse to be inside anything with 4 walls enclosing on me. It feels like it can watch me through them. See me. *Breathe* on me. I've been running. Skipping towns and trying to get as far away as I can from that barn. 

But every so often, when I think all is safe, I turn my head to find a breathing wall at the end of a corridor, humming my name.
