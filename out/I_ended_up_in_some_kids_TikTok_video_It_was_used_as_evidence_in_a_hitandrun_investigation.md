“I can’t believe you have more likes than me! I’ve had my account way longer than you!”

Those were the first words that I heard as I was crossing the small street between the Shop ‘n Save, where I had just finished grocery shopping, and the bus stop outside of the Target next door. I was at the Waterfront, a large shopping district that was located just a bus ride away from my apartment. As I carried my two cloth bags and backpack that contained my carefully chosen items, I noticed the boy who had shouted this statement. He was sitting on one of the red benches, staring at his phone. He couldn’t have been more than ten years old. The girl, who was the recipient of this assessment, was around his same age, and standing nearby.

But truthfully, I didn’t really notice either of these kids. Instead, my eyes and attention were fixated on a younger girl, probably eight years old, who was with them. Because she was actively putting all of her strength and effort into pushing a large shopping cart into the street.

When I sat down at the bench that was unaccompanied by the children, my mind, which was always on high alert, quickly assessed the situation that was unfolding in front of me.

I looked to see if they had an adult with them. There was a young woman who was sitting on the bench next to the boy, who I supposed was with them. However, she had her nose buried in her own phone, and didn’t seem to notice or care what the kids were doing, or how potentially dangerous it was. I watched her in my attempt to figure out what the hell was going on, and I didn’t see her look up once, even to check to see if her bus was coming.

Next, I looked at my phone to check the time. It was 6:30 pm. A few years ago, the Waterfront had implemented a youth curfew policy. After 6 pm, visitors who are under 18 must have an adult with them who is 21 or older. As someone who was often unaccompanied by an “adult” when I was 18, I found this policy to be unfair. After encountering this situation, though, I was starting to have doubts.

As I was continuing to watch the girl set the shopping cart into the path of oncoming cars, my mind continued to race, trying to compare this to any other situation I’d come across, in an attempt to figure out how to handle this. When I came up blank, a question came to mind:

“What are you going to **DO** about it?”

Because I was also starting to notice that, to everyone else, this was a non-issue. The woman with them, whether she was their mother or just a shitty babysitter, clearly gave no fucks. The other adults who were also waiting for the bus gave them dirty looks and either stared off into space and waited for their bus, or simply left to wait at a different bus stop. Indeed, the slightly older girl was retrieving the carts that the younger girl was carefully pushing into traffic. I was starting to relax a bit…Until I noticed that the boy wasn’t merely looking at his phone. He was recording what the girls were doing and posting it on social media. That made the comment he had thrown at the girl all the more relevant - and also concerning.

The question that I had originally posed to myself, that had gone unanswered, came to mind yet again, though phrased slightly differently: “What are **YOU** going to do about it?” From there came an unending stream of what-if scenarios that played on a reel in my catastrophizing mind. In an increasing panic, I remembered noting on my journey here that drivers seemed to be driving more quickly and aggressively than usual, probably eager and impatient to get home from a long day of work and errands.

As these thoughts raced through my mind, I heard the screech of tires and screams in response…And then, impossibly, I heard the crunch of gravel, felt the near weightlessness as my back bike tire slid, and the pain as I impacted and crashed alongside an SUV.

In actuality, the kids had cleared the street and ran to the young woman. They had gotten out of the way as my bus had finally driven up to the stop. In my traumatic reverie, I had inadvertently walked into traffic and nearly gotten hit myself. The driver laid on the horn, staring daggers at me, and opened the door to scream at me. “What the hell, man! I could’ve killed you and you weren’t even paying attention!”

“You nearly DID kill me! Fuck, look at my toe!” I hobbled up the steps and showed him the toe of my Vans sneakers, my groceries forgotten in the chaos.

“There’s no **way** I could’ve hit you! I stopped the bus before anything happened, and the cameras will prove it! Look! There’s even witnesses who saw the whole thing!”

“Yeah fuckin’ right! I’m gonna call the cops and I’m pressing charges! **You’re** the one who’s driving! **You** should’ve been paying better attention!” At this point, between the intrusive thoughts I was having, the traumatic flashback, and my minor brush with death, I was incensed. I was hellbent on doing anything and everything to get this asshole bus driver in trouble, including lying about getting hit.

He called my bluff, however, and screamed, “You fuckin’ liar! Get the fuck out of my face!” He shoved me backwards off of the bus, slammed the door shut, and sped off.

As I mentioned, I *hadn’t* been hit - or almost hit - by the bus. In my mind, though, I might as well have, just like I had that day in sixth grade when I was riding my bike and accidentally got hit by a car. But maybe I should’ve been paying closer attention to what the driver was saying, because he was right. There **was** a witness - the boy who was continuing to film the whole thing for TikTok.
