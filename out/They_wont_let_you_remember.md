**I need you to remember.** You, right now, reading this. You're going to die if you don’t remember. I seem to be the only one who can, and I'm trying not to lose hope. I can’t stop this by myself.

This is my eighth attempt to free you.

Earlier this year, scientists in Antarctica drilled a hole 2 miles (3 kilometers) deep and successfully hit bedrock. The chunk of ice they extracted was approximately 1.2 million years old. This is the only thing related to them that they will let you remember; you can still read articles about it online without forgetting.

All of the scientists involved suddenly wanted to go home. They stopped researching. Why? It was interesting enough that a news crew was present a month later when they sailed back.

Live footage recorded them casually disembarking the ship with a pile of gore on deck behind them. One of the scientists was missing. Next to the remaining scientists was an adult Entity.

Entities have a larval stage and an adult stage. Their larval forms are parasitic microorganisms that infect the brain. They are incredibly infectious—spreading easily by air, water, droplets, surfaces, or simple physical touch. The incubation stage varies greatly in length, and most of the people who were infected near the beginning haven’t died yet.

Yes. After the larval stage is over, you **WILL** die. In agony.

They will *eat you from the inside out*. Alive. Over a period of days, until they finally reach their adult stage. They will let you fully experience and remember your last moments; I can hear people screaming and begging from across the city almost every day.

No one else can hear them. Your family won’t notice you being eaten alive in the same room.

Adult Entities are far, *far* worse.

On live TV, the returning Antarctic scientists looked confused as everyone in front of them cried out in terror. Footage cut out for a while as the cameraman panicked, but eventually came back to show everyone acting normal.

When the news anchor questioned the reporter on scene about what happened, the reporter was confused and replied, “We’re about to interview the Antarctic scientists, what do you mean?”

Quickly, people watching knew that something was wrong and the police were called.

The police reported nothing unusual.

The military was called.

The military reported nothing unusual and decided to check other cities. No one ordered them to do this, of course, but they decided it was better to be safe.

Everything went to hell. No one could figure out what was happening. People had a *perfectly normal* desire to travel to new places. Someone terrified and screaming for help suddenly wondered what they were worried about. Rich people were pulled out of their bunkers by the military to make sure they were okay. Global emergency declarations turned into false alarms.

Anything unusual—like buildings leveled by bombs or windows riddled with bullet holes—goes unnoticed. “Looks normal to me,” they’ll say, *even as they’re cleaning it up*.

People who died during the violent beginning of this pandemic suddenly never existed. You never had a child. You never had a wife. The house next door was always vacant. No recorded evidence exists to prove otherwise.

None of you remember. *The Entities won’t let you.*

I was saved by unique circumstances that prevented larval Entities from infecting me. When I realized that I was immune, I went over everything I did step-by-step to figure out why.

Most importantly, I also found a way to avoid adult Entities.

Humans are going to go extinct. I don’t know how the Entities will reproduce after humanity is gone, but I’m not letting everyone else die to find out. We might have a chance to survive if we can cure others, which is why I’m working so hard to make you remember.

It feels like they’re not trying to stop me from posting these messages. It should be easy for them to make people think that I'm a terrorist or something, so it doesn’t make any sense. Maybe they think I won’t succeed? For now, it seems like the Entities can’t do anything to silence me.

At this point I have described the adult Entities six times, I told you how to break free of the larval Entities in two different ways, and I explained how I avoid adult Entities. You may not recall some of this if I’ve failed again, but you'll at least be able to read everything else and hopefully draw your own conclusions.

I’m not sure how many variations of this message it will take before I can get people to wake up, but I won’t stop trying. I’ll keep doing this until I’m contacted by someone who remembers.

Again, my name is . You can contact me at .

Please reach out to me if you remember.
