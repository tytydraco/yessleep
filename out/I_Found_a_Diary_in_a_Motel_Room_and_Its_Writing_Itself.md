Hey, I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but I need to share what happened to me last night. I can’t stop thinking about it, and I don’t know what to do.

So, I’ve been on a solo road trip for the past week. Just trying to clear my head after a messy breakup. Yesterday, I’d been driving for hours, and it started pouring rain, like the kind where you can’t see anything in front of you. So I pulled off the highway and found this cheap motel. You know the type : flickering neon sign, paint peeling off the walls, total dive.

I went to the front desk and told this guy I wanted a room, he gave me a key, I thanked him and left.

The room was exactly what you’d expect : Musty carpet, gross old bedspread, a lamp that barely worked. But there was one thing that stood out. On the nightstand, there was this notebook.

It looked kind of fancy, like leather-bound and old, way too nice for a place like that. I wouldn’t have thought much of it, but when I picked it up, the first page had something written on it :  
"This is your story now."

I don’t know why, but it creeped me out. I figured it was some kind of weird joke from a previous guest. I put it back on the nightstand and went to bed.

Okay, this is where it gets really weird.

This morning, when I woke up, the notebook wasn’t on the nightstand anymore. It was on the bed. Right next to me. And it wasn’t blank anymore.

There were pages and pages of writing, and I swear, it was describing everything I did yesterday. Pulling off the highway because of the rain, checking in at the front desk, meeting the guy there, his name tag said Ron (I didn't even know his name myself), and even the exact moment I opened the notebook.

Then there was a new line at the bottom of the last page. It said I’d wake up this morning and read what it wrote. And that’s exactly what’s happening.

But the best part as the last thing it said : "Don’t leave the motel."

So yeah, I’m freaking out a little bit.

I packed up my stuff and decided to leave right away. I threw the notebook in my bag and went out to my car. But when I tried to start it, nothing happened. Not even a click.

I went back to the front desk to ask for help, and Ron just shrugged. He said something like, “Your car was working fine yesterday, wasn’t it ?” Then he said it wasn’t his problem.

I tried calling a tow truck, but I don’t have any service out here. I ended up going back to my room to figure out what to do, and guess what? The notebook was back on the nightstand. Not in my bag. On the nightstand.

It was open to a new page. It said :  
"You can’t leave."

Last night, I couldn’t sleep.

I started hearing noises outside my door, like footsteps. At first, I thought it was just another guest, but then it sounded like they were pacing back and forth.

I looked out the window, but the parking lot was empty. Then I heard knocking.

It wasn’t loud, just this slow, deliberate knock. I froze. I didn’t know what to do, so I asked, “Who’s there?”

No one answered.

I went back to the notebook, and there was a new sentence. It said :  
"Don’t open the door."

So I didn’t.

I have no idea what’s going on. I don’t even know if I should keep reading this thing. Part of me wants to throw it out, but another part of me feels like I need to see what it says next.

I’m posting this because I’m hoping someone else has experienced something like this. Or maybe you can tell me I’m just overthinking it.

I’ll update if anything else happens.
