“…Police have discovered what seems to be a grisly murder in a downtown Rapid City apartment. Remains of a body were discovered in the apartment of 25-year-old Sonya Wu. Apparently, the killer attempted to use acid to dispose of the body. Police are baffled by the lack of…”
  
I turned off the car radio and pulled into the parking lot.
  
I was meeting Antoine at a small restaurant on the edge of town. We had found each other online. He was tall, with nice eyes and a goatee. His dad was from France, and he claimed he had just a bit of an accent, which admit I was looking forward to listening to. I think he liked my blond hair, my sense of fashion, and that I was an art museum curator.
  
We met outside the restaurant. He told me he loved my dress, and held the door open for me. A waiter seated us. After exchanging some pleasantries, he asked me about my career.
  
I told him about my love of Picasso and the Cubists; I showed him photos on my phone of some of my favorite works. We talked about what it was that made something beautiful, and how beauty inspired people.
  
Then we veered into the subject of past relationships.
  
“I’ve had a few,” Antoine admitted. His face turned dark and angry. “But they all left me. I tried to make them stay, but them left.” His face softened, and he suddenly seemed a bit embarrassed.
  
Then a waiter came by. “Sir, Ma’am, we’re very sorry for the delay. There’s been an accident in the kitchen, and it might be some time before we can get to your order. If you’d still like to stay, you’ll only have to pay half-price for the meal.”
  
I gave Antoine a questioning look.
  
“You know, I’m actually pretty hungry. My house is only a few minutes from here. We could eat there.”
  
I grinned at him. “That sounds fantastic.”
  
We took his car.
  
…
  
Antoine had a secluded home, on the edge of a forest and a suburb outside Rapid City. He pulled into the driveway, and he led me into his house. We shared a naughty smile as he shut the door shut the door behind us.
  
“How hungry are you actually?” I asked flirtatiously.
  
“For food? I can wait,” he said.
  
I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him close. “Well, I’m famished.”
  
Then I unhinged my jaw. Three tendrils launched out of my mouth and latched onto Antoine’s face.
  
A bioelectric shock surged into his body, and had him writhing on the floor in seconds. I savored the look of shock on his face. In his last waking moments, he must have seen my eyes starting to bulge and glow red, and my human façade starting to crack and fade.
  
I vomited up cocktail of digestive juices, getting him ready to eat.
  
While my dinner was tenderizing, I let my human disguise fade away, and went to find Antoine’s shower. I cleaned off my lumpy, octopus-like skin. Then I returned to where my host lay, now just a human-shaped pile of red meat-sludge. I dished some of him onto a plate, threw him in the microwave, and mixed in a bit of lettuce from the fridge. Then I flicked on his TV, and enjoyed dinner on the couch.
  
…
  
A lot of Mimics will wait in dark alleyways or lonely hiking paths to catch humans. They’ll take on a human appearance, walk up to an unsuspecting jogger, saying “Excuse me,” or “I’ve sprained my ankle,” and then pounce. I suppose there’s nothing wrong with that; we all need a quick meal from time to time. But where’s the art? The thrill of the chase?
  
We Mimics are just as smart as humans; smarter, actually, in many ways – in part,  because we can absorb some of the memories of our prey through their brains. But human social interaction – all the nonverbal cues, customs, figures of speech, pop culture references… it’s just so much to keep track of.
  
A lot of Mimics, especially younger, less experienced ones, can hold up a basic conversation with a human, but if they have to talk for more than a minute, the human will sense there’s something wrong. The creep-alarm in the back of their head will go off, and then there’s no way you’ll convince them to go off alone with you. Then you either have to find a new target or chase that one down, and running while in human form is so uncomfortable. Speaking of movement, I know some younger Mimics that can’t even walk with a proper human gait. They raise their legs too high, hold their arms forward like they’re about to grab you, they don’t blink at all… it creeps even me out.
  
Me, on the other hand… I take pride in my work. It’s taken practice, but I’ve mastered the art of living as a human. I can create flawless personas, like my last one, Sonya Wu. I can step into the lives of the people I devour. The Wu persona was fun, but too many people associated with her had disappeared, so I lured Gianna Montaigne – a pretty blond artist and closeted bisexual – to my apartment.
  
As soon as we were alone, I knocked Gianna out with an electric surge through my tongues. Then I dug my tongues in under her skull, eating through the… soft parts. I reached into her brain, and absorbed her memories. I don’t really understand how I do it; it works autonomically. I’ve read a bit on human neurology. My theory is that I consume parts of the frontal cortex, most of the hippocampus, and a bit of the cerebellum. Once I do, can recall some of the victim’s memories, learn about their friends and family, and even gain some of their skills.
  
Once that was done with learning from Gianna, looked over her one last time. My flesh began to bulge, constrict, and change color, and within a minute, I looked just like her. I melted and ate her, took her wallet and possessions, and packaged the leftovers for later eating. Then I went to live in her apartment, work her job, hang out with her friends.
  
It’s actually quite exhilarating, living the life of a human you’ve devoured, fooling their loved ones and coworkers into trusting you. Just this morning, Gianna’s neighbor was whining to me about her boyfriend-troubles on the couch of my new apartment, oblivious to the fact that the real Gianna was in a Tupperware in the fridge, fifteen feet from her – and apparently in the Rapid City Police Department. I guess I spilled some on the way out.
  
No matter. No one knew Gianna was visiting Sonya Wu’s apartment that night. To the human world, Sonya Wu had disappeared, and Gianna Montaigne was doing business as usual.
  
I’ve even come to enjoy getting to know my prey, like with Antoine. I like learning about their careers, their hobbies, their dreams. I like making them feel safe and understood, even excited when they think they’re about to get laid – and then eating them, naturally.
  
If I were human, I would probably feel empathy for my prey, and guilt for hurting them. But I’m not, and I don’t. It’s just not my nature. Wolves don’t feel guilty for eating deer. Humans don’t feel guilty for eating cow meat – well, at least not most of them; I’ll never understand vegans. Nature is made of food chains, and, despite what they think, humans aren’t on top. We are.
  
…
  
I awoke to a bang. I had fallen asleep under Antoine’s bed, in my true Mimic shape. It sounded like the front door had been forced open. Burglars? If it was just one guy, I could probably take him, make a good meal out of him. Two or more, I would be better off just sneaking out the window, although that would mean leaving the remains of Antoine to be discovered in the fridge. Acceptable losses, I supposed.
  
I crawled on all fours up to the bedroom window, opened it, and was about to cut through the screen with a retractable claw when a thought popped into my head – the police could search Antoine’s computer and phone. They would learn the last place he was seen was that restaurant with Gianna Montaigne. They could talk to the waiter, and learn he had gone home with Gianna Montaigne the night he died. I didn’t want to give up this persona just yet. Maybe I could scare the burglars off…
  
Wait, what was that buzzing noise?
  
“I’m telling you, it’s in the house,” called someone from downstairs.
  
My curiosity piqued, I snuck out the bedroom and peeked down a balcony.
  
There was a man in a hooded black jacket, standing in the house’s entryway, holding some sort of beeping device with an antenna.
  
Then he looked up and saw me. He must have seen my large red eyes in the dark.
  
“Vampire!” he shouted, and started sprinting up the stairs.
  
I clumsily turned around, banging my head – it was a narrow hallway, not designed for large four-legged creatures. I crawled frantically back to the bedroom, loud footsteps behind me.
  
I leapt over the bed, tore open the window screen, and started crawling out the second-floor window.
  
The man grabbed me by the leg. I could hear more coming. I hissed, wriggled, and kicked with the other leg. I kept kicking air, until, finally, I got his face. His grip loosened – I was free – then I was falling… out the second-floor window… headfirst… oh no.
  
I tried to roll. I managed to not break my neck, but I sprained my right foreleg. I lay flat on the ground, looking up at the crescent moon.
  
A hooded head peeked out of the open window. “It went out the window! Go out the back. Go! Go!”
  
I half-limped, half-dragged myself to a row of bushes. This was bad.
  
I needed to take human form. I pictured Gianna Montaigne in my head. My skin smoothed over and turned pale. My flesh and muscles twisted, bloated, and constricted around by bones. I hissed with pain in my right arm, as sprained ligaments tried to twist and reshape themselves against fractured bones.
  
A sliding door opened, and two hooded figures with flashlights ran out.
 
Time for an Oscar-worthy performance.
  
I emerged from the bushes, now an attractive, naked woman, a look of terror on my face. Their flashlights beamed in my face.
  
“It went into the woods! It killed my boyfriend, and it would have killed me too! Please, you have to help me!” I limped toward them with tearful, begging eyes.
 
One of them turned off his light and started to take off his jacket.
  
“You’re gonna be okay,” he said. “Which way did it go?” He handed me his jacket.
  
“Wait!” said the other one. It sounded like a woman, though I couldn’t see her face. “Look at her arm.”
  
We all looked down at my right hand. It hadn’t transformed properly. The flesh was wriggling, and there were streaks of dark blue-green.
  
I turned to run, but I felt a prong break skin in my back, and then I was on fire, every muscle in my body seizing. I fell to the ground. They’re tasing me, I realized. I wonder if this is what my prey feel like.
  
Then both of them tackled me and held my by my arms. “We got it!” the woman shouted.
  
…
  
They handcuffed me, carried me to the bathroom, and threw me in the bathtub. Then the woman pulled out a cell phone, started a video, and tased me again. I screamed like a human woman, but the jolts twisted my throat, distorting my voice like a broken record player.
  
“What the hell was that for?” demanded the man. He had a red-brown goatee. He looked hardly older than 20.
  
“Did you see the way its skin ripples? It’s like a cuttlefish,” said the woman. She had cocoa skin and dyed purple curls under her hood.
  
“A what?” asked the young man.
  
“Haven’t you seen a nature documentary? They’re like little octopuses, and they can change color so quick it looks like a neon sign.”
  
Just then, I sensed it. I could feel the aura of another Mimic. We have auras, that allow us to sense each other’s presence. None of us know the science behind it, if there is any. If there are multiple Mimics in an area, the sense gets clouded and doesn’t work that far. But if you’re alone in an area, and then another Mimic starts moving towards you, it’s possible to feel their aura from four or five miles away, and get a general sense of their direction.
  
Maybe, just maybe, the other Mimic would search me out?
  
Then a second man walked into the bathroom. He had a patch over his left eye, with deep, old scars surrounding it. He was tall, slender, and pale as a sheet, like he hadn’t been out in the sun in years. He had a sharp, severe expression.
  
He held the antennae-device that I had seen earlier. He pointed it at me and turned it on; it whirred and clicked; then he turned it off.
  
“That’s a vampire alright,” he grumbled. He had a deep, gruff Southern drawl.
  
“What do you want?” I moaned, trying as much as I could to sound like an innocent girl.
  
The scarred man knelt down so we were eye-level. His fierce scowl and one blue eye seemed to bore right into my soul. For the first time in my life, I looked into a human face and felt real fear.
  
“Thirty-five years ago, in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, I was eight years old. My father had left us, and my mother was caring for me on her own. We didn’t have much, but she gave me what she could. I loved messing with old technology. She would bring me used phones, radios, even a computer once, and I would take them apart and put them together again.”
  
The man with the eyepatch continued his story. “Sometimes, after I was in bed, she would bring… company home. One night, I woke up to hear a buzzing noise. There was a little radio on my dresser. It was disassembled; it shouldn’t have been able to pick up any signals, but something was making it buzz. Just then, I heard my mother and some man come home. I heard them talking and laughing for a few minutes. Then I heard her yelp and groan.
  
“I hesitated. I remember waiting in bed, just a child, scenarios running through my head. Was it a happy noise? What would I see if I went down to check? Had she just fallen? Or had he hit her? Was he going to hurt her? Would he hurt me? …Then I heard the slurping sounds. I grabbed a Bibi gun – closest thing I had to a weapon – and snuck down the hall… and there, I saw it.
  
“Something just like you – hell, maybe it was you – was standing on four legs, over the remains of my mother. It stopped, looked up at me with these big, glowing green eyes; and I swear its face twisted into a wide, toothless grin.
  
“I pulled the trigger on my toy gun. Shot it in it right in the eye. It screamed, then pounced and returned the favor. Clawed my damn eye out. Then it ran out of the house, hissing in pain. It left me and my mother on the kitchen floor. She was melting like old ice cream; I was bleeding out and unconscious. But the neighbors had heard the screech. They kicked the door in and got me to a hospital.
  
“I spent decades trying to learn whatever I could about you… vampires, or whatever the hell you are. The radio, that picked up a signal that night – I realized it was you. You give off signals. It took me years, but I figured out how to create this device–” he held up his scanning-device, “–to track you vermin down. And I’m not the only one who’s been searching.”
  
The leader stood, smiled as glared down at me, and then turned purple-haired woman. 
  
“You got video proof?” She nodded, and handed him the phone.
  
“I’m going to upload it, contact the others, set a livestream up. I want you to get the equipment ready. You,” he said, turning to the other man, “watch it.”
  
The two walked out of the bathroom, leaving me under the scared, shocked, suspicious gaze of the one guard.
  
…
  
This was bad. This was really, really bad.
  
We Mimics have a law, set in stone by the Elders over 900 years ago. If you’re discovered by humans, you have one moon cycle to find and eliminate any who learn of our species’ existence. If you’re captured, or the Council has to dispatch the Enforcers to clean up your mess, they take you back to the Undercity to be Punished. And believe me when I say, that being Punished by Mimics makes Medieval executions look like a spa-day.
  
Back when I was barely older than a larva, in the late 19th Century, we didn’t have to be quite as careful as we do now. Mimics would be sighted by pesky town-watchmen from time to time, and we’d have to sneak back into town and eliminate anyone who saw us. Once, In 1932, my older brother had to ask me to help him take the place of a couple of small-town police who had spotted him mid brain-sucking. We killed them and took their forms, told the sheriff we had made the story of a brain-eating alien up, and then skipped town.
  
That was before cell phones and the internet. Now, if you aren’t careful, any regular shmuck can snap a photo of you and upload it. And if you go online, the Enforcers begin hunting immediately. They wipe your photo from the web… and then wipe you from the face of the earth.
  
The Enforcers are probably the most dangerous creatures on the planet. They’re even better at imitation and identity-theft than me. They can kill anyone, and they can become anyone. Human or Mimic, there’s no hiding from them – especially Mimics, since we can track each other by our auras.
  
Though apparently, now humans can do that too.
  
…
  
My mind raced. I could still feel the aura of the other Mimic. It was getting closer. That was a good sign. But what if that video of me was posted online before they arrived? What if it were an Enforcer? If the video was posted, the Enforcer would kill all the humans itself, and then haul me off to the Undercity. Was it an Enforcer? I could only sense one presence, and Enforcers rarely worked alone… Whatever the case, I had to do something.
  
I looked at the man standing over me. He was so young, so nervous, so obviously in over his head. Maybe, if I played this right…
  
“Is he… going to kill me?” I whispered, making my voice sound dry and brittle, and my eyes go cracked and teary.
  
The man looked away, uncomfortable.
  
“Please… we’re not… we’re not all monsters.” I lied. “Some of us do… bad things. But I’ve never hurt anyone. I just like pretending to be one of you.” I could probably get away with that lie. I doubted they would recognize Antoine’s remains in the fridge right away.
  
The purple-haired woman reentered the bathroom. “Hold her down, I’m gonna draw blood.”
  
The man grimaced, but did as he was told. I didn’t struggle, but I made sure to whimper in pain – only partly acting – as the woman jabbed a needle into my shoulder.
  
“Look at that… blue blood!” she slowly walked out of the bathroom, staring at the syringe in wonder.
  
I huddled in the corner of the bathtub. I made a tear fall from my eye, and then looked at the man.
  
“Can you… can you at least cover me? I don’t like being naked,” I sobbed. He sighed, then took off his jacket and began to drape it over me.
  
Then I unhinged my jaw. Three tendrils launched out of my mouth and latched onto the young man’s face.
  
He shook and groaned – not very loud – and kicked the cupboard; then slumped over me. 
  
“Cole! Everything okay?” the woman called. I heard her walking up the stairs. Quickly, I shifted my throat to imitate the man’s voice.
  
“Yeah, all good!” I called back.
  
The woman stopped. I held my breath. If she came up and saw me mid-escape, it was over. But she didn’t. I heard her turn around and walk back down the stairs.
  
“Alright ‘Cole,’ let’s get to know each other better,” I whispered, and my tendrils went into his skull, through the eyes. I absorbed his memory. I learned about his past, his motives, and about his partners.
  
At the same time, I twisted and squeezed the muscles and tendons in my left hand. It hurt, but I made my hand slender enough to squeeze it, painfully, out of the handcuff. I pushed Cole off me, looked over him, and then, I became him.
  
…
  
Cole hurried down the stairs, into the kitchen. The purple-haired woman, Katherine Williams, was sorting through a bag of medical gear and scalpels on the kitchen table.
  
“Kat, you gotta see this! I think she’s dying!”
 
“What? Shit!” Katherine bolted up and started toward the stairs.
  
“Go, I’m gonna tell Michael!” I said, running past her.
  
I ran out of the house, toward a black van that sat on the end of Antoine’s driveway.
  
Back in the house, Kat screamed. She must have found Cole’s eyeless body. I suppressed a snicker.
  
Then I pulled open the van’s back doors.
  
Sitting with a laptop in the back of the van, was the man with the eyepatch, Michael Gillman, the leader of this little monster-hunting group. He glared up at me.
  
“Something’s happened, you gotta help!” I shouted.
  
Michael slammed the laptop shut and leapt out of the van. “What’s going on?!”
  
We started running toward the house.
  
I pulled Cole’s pocket knife out and switched out the blade.
  
Michael must have heard the knife click. He turned around and caught my arm just as I lunged for him.
  
We fell to the pavement. I pushed the knife down, with both arms, but Michael held it back.
  
“I must admit, human… for a moment, you had me nervous,” I hissed through gritted teeth. The knife inched toward the man’s one good eye.
  
Then he twisted, bucked his hips, and rolled both of us over, and suddenly he was on top, pushing the knife towards me.
  
“No fangs, vampire?” he said, snarling. His face got close to mine. Close enough.
  
“I don’t need them,” I answered. I opened my mouth, and my tongues surged up. Michael roared, convulsed, and then went limp. The knife clattered on the pavement.
  
I grabbed the knife and drove it into Michael’s chest. Just then, Kat burst out the door.
  
“Noo!” she screamed, and started shooting.
  
I ran back to the van. One of her bullets pierced my shoulder. I cried out and stumbled, and then dove into the back of the van.
  
Bullets punched through the car as Kat fired wildly, emptying her magazine. One shot a few inches by my head.
  
“Michael? Michael, stay with me!” I heard Kat moan.
  
I was pinned down. I could run out the side-door opposite Kat, but she would hear, and chase me down. Car keys? No, Cole didn’t carry a pair of keys, or a gun, for that matter. Or…
  
I sifted through the memories I had taken from Cole. He had escaped a Mimic when he was eleven… Traumatized, he became a loner, who spent all his free time on the internet… When he was sixteen, he discovered a group called the Night Hunters, who operated on the deep web, sharing stories and theories about Mimics… Apparently the Enforcers aren’t as all-knowing as I thought… Cole met up with the Night Hunters’ founder, Michael Gillman, and helped him create the device that could detect Mimics. Then, the two of them and Kat drove around the Midwest in Michael’s van, searching for Mimics… and while they were on the road, Michael had once said something about always keeping a hidden gun… What was it he said? “I always keep shotgun seat loaded.”
  
Under the shotgun seat.
  
“I'll kill you for that!" Kat howled. I heard her reload and march toward the van. I pulled the van door shut, then went for the shotgun seat, felt around under it, and retrieved a beautiful, shiny-black pump-shotgun.
  
I pumped the gun just as Kat yanked the van door open and screamed, “Go back to Hell, you motherf–” *Bang!*

Wouldn’t be salvaging any memories from *her* brains.

I threw the gun aside. My shoulder seared with pain. I unzipped Cole’s jacket and looked at my shirt; it was stained blue with my blood. Mimics regenerated, but a bullet hole would take a couple hours to heal.

I had to get out of here. Kat’s pistol had a silencer, but that shotgun would have woken up the whole neighborhood; there were probably a dozen startled old ladies dialing 911 that instant.

Then I remembered the video.
  
I leapt over to Michael’s laptop, and flipped it open. The password was no problem.

The computer opened to a some unlabeled message board. The video – of me, being tased in the bathtub, in my Gianna form, changing colors and making unnatural noises – had been posted.

Then I heard a high, raspy voice just behind me.

«*Don’t move. Hands up. Turn around slowly.*»
  
I did as I was told.
  
It was the other Mimic. I had been so focused on escaping, I had entirely forgotten about its aura, until it was right on top of me.
  
I turned to see it, standing just outside the van doors, in a black trench coat, holding me at gunpoint. It’s face was undisguised: its skin was a lumpy, dark blue-green; its temples pulsed slightly with its heartbeat. One eye glowed emerald-green; the other eye was scarred, and had a weak, pale lime color.
  
«*Enforcer?*» I asked, revealing my true face and red eyes.
  
«*Yes. I know the video has been uploaded. You made a noble effort, Young One, but I have no choice but to take you to the Undercity.*»
  
I hung my head and nodded.
  
«*Get out of the van*,» it ordered. I obeyed. «*We’re going to walk to the black car at the end of the driveway. I’m going to open the trunk, and you’re going to get in. If you cooperate, I will ask the Elders to be lenient toward you.*»
  
I walked forward, dragging my feet. My shoulder stung terribly. We approached the Enforcer’s car.
  
I looked stared at its unblinking, asymmetrical eyes, as it unlocked the car and pulled open the trunk. And then I realized something.
  
«*The ringleader, Michael Gillman! He saw a green-eyed Mimic when he was a child. Shot its eye with a toy gun!*»
  
«*Get in the trunk. Now*,» the Enforcer ordered.
  
«*I sensed you coming. Before these humans uploaded the video of me.*» I continued. «*You knew about this group… the ‘Night Hunters.’*»
  
«*Yes. That’s my job,*» the Enforcer scoffed.
  
«*But you’re alone... Enforcers hunt in packs. Are you... are you working in secret? To hide your mistake with the child Michael from the Elders?*»
  
The Enforcer’s eyes narrowed. *He’s going to kill me, right here, right now*. I thought.
  
Then, Police sirens sounded in the distance.
  
«*Let me go, and I will tell no one! I swear!*»
  
The Enforcer hissed in annoyance. «*Get out of here. I will deal with the video and the police. See that no one hears of this, or we will both face Punishment.*» Its face morphed into a stern-looking man, and it pulled out a matching lanyard that marked him as an FBI.
  
With that, I fled into the night.
  
I sprinted through the woods, on all fours, for a half-hour. Then used Gianna’s form to hitch a ride with some half-drunk man in a pickup truck. I absorbed and became him, took the driver’s seat, and was out of state before the sun rose.
  
I had survived, and would continue to hunt. Continue to become. Continue to consume.
  
*Almost* at the top of the food chain.
