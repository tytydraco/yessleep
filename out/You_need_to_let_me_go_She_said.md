You need to let me go.

Why?

Because you just have to.

But I don't want to.

You have to try, my love.

Please, don’t call me that.

The world isn’t the same anymore, and you need to brace yourself for what’s ahead. If you keep trying to build with the old, crumbling bricks of yesterday, everything will fall apart, and you'll be buried beneath the ruins.

You always know what to say, don’t you?

She let out a soft, bittersweet chuckle. "Baby, it's only fair. Let go of the rope... the water isn’t as cold as you think."

“Alright,” I muttered, though every fiber of my being resisted.

As I stepped into the water, I found that she was right—the temperature was mild, almost welcoming, just as she had said. She was always right, always so damn sure of everything. She didn’t need glasses to prove she was smart; it radiated from her in ways that made you feel small, insignificant.

“I think it’s time to go home!” I yelled, the desperation clinging to my words.

But there was no response, just the quiet echo of my own voice mingling with the gentle lapping of the water. I looked around, searching for her, but she was gone, vanished like a ghost that had never been real to begin with. The warmth of the water suddenly felt like ice, creeping into my bones, chilling me to the core.

Home. The word felt hollow, meaningless. Without her, home was just a place—a collection of walls and memories that were slowly disintegrating, just like the bricks she had warned me about. I stood there, ankle-deep in the water, realizing that I was alone in every sense of the word, and the truth of it was suffocating. The rope had slipped from my hands, and now I was adrift, without her to anchor me.

I had to let go, but instead of relief, all I felt was the crushing weight of loss. I was tearing myself apart every day, if only I had her again, if I could relive the life, I once knew but I needn’t prose. The ropes indeed hang to keep us all awake, I should have known. Life just isn’t the same old song anymore.

If only we had lived together in a universe that had favored us. Maybe I just needed to feel the warmth of the sun again and so I did. I grabbed my keys and got in my car.

Outside, the world was beautiful, it was intricate and peaceful, the bustling sound of the traffic, children playing on the streets, it was refreshing for once. I decided to go for a cup of coffee, maybe it would freshen up my mind, bring me back to the world I once loved. I pulled up into the parking lot of the small autistic café in town. It was a cute place, the freshly baked coffee beans, crumbs of the croissants and donuts made me feel hungry and I was surprised too. It had been too long since I had enjoyed my meal.

“Hi, my name is Emily, how can I help you sir?”

The petite barista smiled at me, “Two large black coffees and one of those glazed donuts”

“That’ll be $4.99”

I used my card to pay, I hadn’t time to even withdraw cash from the ATM. I don’t need cash to where I’m going

“Here’s your receipt sir, there’s a surprise at the bottom!”

In my slumber, I hadn’t realized that she was flirting with me and had written her number on the bottom of the receipt, I smiled;

“Do you know how old I am?”

“She chuckled; I like older men”

“Maybe try again in another life” I said as I showed her my wedding ring.

“Aww shucks”

I waited in the brown leather booth in the far corner of the café. Its aura was quite gay but eccentric, feeding off from the energy of the customers who seemed all busy in their everyday lives. To the nerd with the glasses who typed away at his laptop to the casual meeting being held with the full suited men. It kind off reminded me of the life I lived, I was busy too once in my own life….with her. The café would have felt dead if it wasn’t for the smiles of the first date sharing a strawberry smoothie together.

I picked up my order and got in my car, the engine roared and came to life. I fixed my GPS to where I had last seen her. It was going to be just like our first date.

\*\*\*

I checked my watch again. Five minutes had passed since the last time I looked, but it felt like an eternity. The café was bustling with the usual weekend crowd, the clatter of cups and murmur of conversation filling the air, but I barely noticed any of it. My eyes kept darting to the door, scanning the faces that walked in, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.

"You're really nervous, aren’t you?" Jake, my best friend, leaned back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips. He took a sip of his coffee, completely at ease.

"Shut up," I muttered, fidgeting with the napkin in front of me. "It’s just a first date. No big deal."

Jake chuckled, shaking his head. "Yeah, sure. Just a first date with the girl you've been talking about non-stop for the past two weeks."

I shot him a glare, but he wasn’t wrong. I had been obsessing over this date since the moment we’d set it up. We’d met online, exchanged messages for a while, and now, finally, we were going to meet in person. It felt like a huge step, and the pressure was getting to me. What if she didn’t like me in person? What if we didn’t click the way we did over text?

“Dude, relax. You’ll be fine,” Jake said, as if reading my mind. “Just be yourself.”

“Easy for you to say. You’re just here as a wingman,” I replied, trying to keep my voice light, but the anxiety was creeping in.

Before Jake could respond, the café door opened, and I saw her walk in. My breath hitched. She was even more beautiful than her pictures—long, wavy hair, a warm smile that made her eyes sparkle, and a kind of effortless grace that made her stand out in the crowd. She was with her friend, who looked equally stunning, but my eyes were glued to her.

“There she is,” Jake said, nudging me under the table. “Game time, man.”

I stood up, my heart pounding in my chest as they walked over. “Hi, you must be Emma,” I said, my voice sounding a little too high-pitched for my liking. I cleared my throat, trying to regain some composure.

Emma smiled, and the nervousness I’d felt all morning started to melt away. “Hi, yeah, it’s great to finally meet you in person,” she said, her voice just as soft and kind as I’d imagined.

“This is my friend, Sarah,” she added, gesturing to the woman beside her. Sarah gave a polite nod, and Jake quickly stood up to introduce himself, smoothly taking over the conversation with Sarah, leaving me and Emma to ourselves.

We sat down, and for a moment, I was at a loss for words. All the things I’d planned to say seemed to slip away, leaving my mind blank. But then Emma laughed—a light, musical sound—and the tension broke.

“Nervous?” she asked, her eyes twinkling with amusement.

“Yeah, a little,” I admitted, running a hand through my hair. “But in a good way, I think. I’ve been looking forward to this.”

“Me too,” she said, her smile widening. “It’s funny, I was worried it might be awkward, but I’m glad it’s not.”

“Definitely not,” I agreed, feeling more at ease. “So, what do you think? Is this place okay?”

She glanced around the café, taking in the cozy atmosphere. “It’s perfect. I like the vibe here. It’s casual and gay, but still nice.”

“I’m glad,” I said, relieved that she seemed comfortable. “So, how was your day?”

We started chatting, and the conversation flowed easily, just like it had online. We talked about everything—our jobs, our favorite movies, even our most embarrassing moments. Every now and then, I’d glance over at Jake and Sarah, who seemed to be getting along well, but my focus was on Emma. The more we talked, the more I realized how much I liked her. She was funny, smart, and had this way of making you feel like you were the only person in the room.

At one point, she leaned in a little closer, her voice dropping to a more intimate tone. “You know, I wasn’t sure what to expect, meeting you in person. But I’m really glad I came.”

My heart skipped a beat. “Yeah? Me too. I mean, I was kind of a wreck this morning, but now… this just feels right.”

She smiled, and for a moment, everything else faded away. It was just the two of us, in this little bubble of connection that felt both new and familiar at the same time.

“I hope we can do this again,” I said, feeling a little bolder now that the initial nerves had worn off.

“I’d like that,” she replied, her eyes locking onto mine. “I’d like that a lot.”

The rest of the date went by in a blur. We finished our drinks, laughed at Jake’s terrible jokes, and even made plans to meet up again the next weekend. By the time we left the café, I felt like I was floating on air.

As we said our goodbyes, Emma gave me a quick hug, and I caught a whiff of her perfume—something floral and sweet that lingered in my mind long after she was gone.

“So, how’d it go?” Jake asked as we watched them walk away.

“It was perfect,” I said, unable to stop the smile from spreading across my face. “I think I’m really going to like her.”

Jake clapped me on the back, grinning. “Told you, man. Just be yourself. Looks like it paid off.”

I nodded, still watching the spot where Emma had disappeared around the corner. “Yeah… I think it really did.”

I smiled as the memory faded away, I had blacked out and didn’t realize I was already at my home. She was waiting for me. When I walked inside the house, it felt warm and the smell felt refreshing. She was cooking.

“Make sure to leave your muddy boats at the door babe”

 “And ifn’t I don’t?”

“Then you’ll meet a fate worse than death partner”

I chuckled and kissed her neck, “Hey goodlooking, what’s cooking?”

“I found some leftover meat in the basement freezer so I decided to make steaks for dinner”

“What freezer?”

The night was perfect, at least on the surface. The table was set with our best china, a bottle of red wine breathing on the counter, and the steak resting just the way she liked it—medium-rare, with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The flicker of candlelight danced on the walls, casting a warm, golden glow over everything. She looked beautiful, sitting there across from me, her smile soft and sweet, like it always was when she was happy. But something felt off. There was a dull ache at the back of my mind, like a distant memory trying to surface.

"Anyways, can you fix the table, honey?" she asked, her voice gentle but insistent.

I nodded, pushing away the unease. "Of course," I said, getting up to steady the wobbly leg. I could feel her eyes on me as I worked, her gaze like a weight on my shoulders. But I didn’t look up. I just kept my focus on the table, trying to ignore the strange, creeping feeling that something wasn’t right.

Dinner was delicious, as it always was when we cooked together. The steak melted in my mouth, the wine was rich and full-bodied, and the conversation flowed effortlessly, just like it always had. But there was something in her eyes tonight, something distant and cold that I couldn’t quite place. I wanted to ask her about it, but every time I opened my mouth, the words died in my throat. Instead, I just smiled and nodded, pretending everything was normal.

After dinner, we cleaned up together, laughing softly as we washed the dishes and put them away. The whole time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong, but I kept it to myself. I didn’t want to ruin the evening. Not when everything seemed so perfect.

When we finally climbed into bed, I wrapped my arms around her, pulling her close. She snuggled into me, her body warm and soft against mine, and for a moment, I let myself believe that everything was okay.

“Relax, its over. You belong to me. I want to fill your mouth with dirt”

“What?” She whispered

“Relax, my love. It’s over, now you can never leave, I take your second digit with me”

 

 

Just then—a loud crash came from downstairs. My eyes snapped open, my heart pounding in my chest. She stirred beside me, but I gently shushed her, kissing the top of her head.

“Stay here, I’ll check it out,” I whispered, slipping out of bed and grabbing the baseball bat from the closet. The floorboards creaked under my feet as I made my way down the stairs, the darkness closing in around me. The house was quiet, too quiet, and every shadow seemed to move as I passed.

When I reached the kitchen, I saw a figure standing there, shrouded in darkness. My breath caught in my throat as I gripped the bat tighter.

“Who are you?” I demanded, my voice shaking. The figure didn’t move, didn’t speak, just stood there, staring at me with eyes that seemed to glow in the dark. I took a step closer, my heart racing. “I said, who are you?”

“Ethan…” The voice was low, rasping, and familiar. Too familiar.

“What?” I whispered, my heart sinking. “How do you know my name?”

The figure didn’t answer. It just stood there, its eyes locked on mine, its expression twisted with something that looked like pain and it pointed at something, when I looked away to what It was pointing, I heard it—the sound of something moving in the basement, something heavy and slow.

I turned away from the figure, my heart in my throat as I made my way to the basement door. The smell hit me before I even reached the stairs, a putrid, rotting stench that made my stomach turn. I gagged, covering my mouth as I descended into the darkness, the sound growing louder with every step.

When I reached the bottom, I saw him—Jake, tied to a pole in the middle of the room, his body broken and bloodied, his eyes wide with terror. He was dead, skinned alive, and parts of his flesh had been ripped apart, as if something had been feeding on him. But that wasn’t the worst of it.

I stumbled back, my mind reeling, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. And then it all came rushing back which in my slumber, I had forgotten, my wife, her death, and the day I found out about Jake; the rage, the grief, the overwhelming need for revenge. I had captured him, brought him here, and made him suffer for what he’d done. But that wasn’t enough. No, it wasn’t nearly enough.

I had dug her up. My beautiful, sweet wife. I had dug her up from her grave, brought her back here, and pretended that everything was normal, that she was still alive. But she wasn’t. She had been dead for five years. The woman upstairs… was nothing but a rotting corpse, her flesh decaying, her bones brittle and cold.

I had lost my mind completely.

I stumbled back up the stairs, the reality of what I had done crashing down on me like a tidal wave. When I reached the bedroom, I saw her—my wife, her body decomposing, lying in our bed. I had been living with a corpse, pretending she was still alive, pretending that everything was okay and everything was okay. She is mine…. She is mine…. *YOU ARE MINE; YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE, I CAN TEAR YOU APART, I CAN RECOMBINE YOU. ALL I WANT, IS TO COVET YOU ALL, YOU BELONG TO ME AND I WILL KILL YOU TO LOVE YOU.*

I fell to my knees, my body shaking with sobs, when I heard it—a knock at the door. The police. They had finally come for me and the figure is there no more.
