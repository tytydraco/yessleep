Obsession is an iron grip that twists the mind and consumes the soul. This is my story of obsession. 

I feel the hard sip of Bourbon trickle down my throat, as the smoke from my cuban rises to the ceiling. It hits the top of this room and dissipates. Sitting here in this chair, I reminisce. The soft crunch of the cheap leather I sit on, parked upon laminate floors. I reminisce about a time where life was a little simpler. Today was not a rainy day, nor gloomy; in fact, a beautiful sun pushed through the window. My eyes follow cars on the busy street below me; the constant sound of honking floods my ears. But still I sit here, thinking about someone who had once inspired me.

At the end of my time in High School, I had a literature teacher named Mr. Wescott. These days I wish I’d listened to him more. Instead, I spent my school days messing around with some friends I had back then. One story that I do remember going over was “The Turn of The Screw”. It always stuck out to me. Mr. Wescott, with his penchant for Gothic literature, opened our eyes to Poe and Louis-Stevenson's works, urging deeper exploration beyond our class schedule.  
  
My wristwatch beeped and flickered. It was 4PM, I’m supposed to meet Rachel for dinner today, and with this traffic I ought to leave now if I want to make it there by 5:30. I gently place my rocks glass upon the table seated next to my chair, and ash my cigar on the tray. Made from cedar, it was like a dance captured in wood: a sleek, swirling cigar embraced by wisps of smoke, etched with meticulous detail.

 I took one last look at the busy street below me, all the folks in their suits rushing to find a taxi. Grey, Brown, Black- Such a static selection of colors in professional wear. I grab the keys to my sedan and head down the stairs of the building. The weathered bricks, worn with time, seemed as ancient as the stones of a monastery. Each step on the grated metal stairs gave a slight downward push beneath my weight. Reaching the big green door, I pushed it open and walked to my car. I slid the key into the ignition—gas, spark, air. Click. My car roared to life. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of that sound, though with what I’m financing it for, maybe I should be. I flicked through the radio stations, searching for something to match my mood, and finally settled on some softer classic rock. My hands pounded the beat of the song on the leather steering wheel as I drove. On my right, the restaurant came into view. "Finally," I thought, as I approached the restaurant.

La Dolce Vita Lounge & Trattoria. Rachel and I’s favorite date night spot. Unfortunately we don’t get so many of those these days since she started that new banking job. But it’s good money, so I can’t complain. I exit my vehicle and wander my way into the front doors, greeted by the hostess.  
  
“Hi, reservation for Charlie” I told her.   
  
I did end up getting there quite early so she told me to sit at the bar until the table was ready- about 10-12 minutes she noted. I strut towards the rustic bar and receive a friendly nod from the bartender. A middle-aged man, well dressed, cleanly shaven. The red fabric of his vest ran vibrant in the brown color scheme of the bar. I sit down on the black & metal stool at the counter, making sure it spins around like the rest of them. It did, if you were wondering.   
  
“Evening, what’ll it be?” Asked the bartender. 	“Honestly, give me something a little lighter. What do you think?” I replied  
  
He raised his eyebrows, and nodded to himself. I read his nametag, “Paul”, it said. Paul turns around and gets to work. I take a look at myself in the mirror behind the various liquor bottles seated on the shelf. I brush my hands through my hair and crack a slight smile, getting excited to see Rachel again, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. Funny, it was her calling.	“Hi Honey, traffic is pretty rough right now, I’m still gonna make it but might be a little bit late, just wanted to tell you.” She admitted.	“Alright, no big deal. I’ll see you soon, love you.”	“Love you too, bye.” The line clicked.   
  
Unfortunately with the place she and I live, this was all too common. Oh well. The bartender approached my seat with a glass in hand. I thanked him. What sat in front of me now was an Aperol Spritz, not bad. I glance upwards as the first sip of the drink comes down, when I notice a figure approaching on my left. It was another man, I raised my glass in his direction, & he replied with a polite smile.   
  
The man sat upright, with the most perfect posture I’d ever lay my eyes on. From neck to waist, a precise angle. Wearing a stark blue suit. The sleeves cut off at his wrists. Holding an Old Fashioned, his hands, so vascular. Upon his right hand was an antique watch which matched the suit seamlessly. I was jealous. A pair of italian leather shoes at the bottom of his legs. I sit here, in my stool, seething at this stranger I’d never once seen before. His face was so clean; hair, well taken care of and full. I don’t know why I’m having these thoughts. His skin is as clear as a crystal and glowing. With every fiber in me I was filled with nothing but resentment and envy and bitterness towards this individual who had only come in my vision this past minute. His presence was so demanding. This man was not The Devil in appearance but at this point he may as well be. He was my Devil. I couldn’t handle it. This has never happened to me befo-  
  
“You alright man?” He looked at me, and questioned informally.  
  
The thoughts stopped.   
  
I watched his lips travel upward and down as he spoke to me, it took me a good few seconds to register this. I pulled my upper body back and began to reply to him.  
  
"Oh, yes," I stammered, straightening in my seat. "Sorry, I zoned out there for a second."  
  
He gave a slight chuckle.   
  
“I understand, It happens.” His gaze strayed from me and to his watch. I take that reminder to look at mine, it should be time to get a table now.   
  
I stood up from my stool, the man giving no more attention to me, and approached the hostess stand. She raised her eyebrows at me.   
  
“Charlie? We have your table right over here.”  
  
“Perfect, thank you” I replied.   
  
She took me to the table, adjacent to the bar counter. It, adorned with a small white cloth, and a clearly fake golden candle centered. In view of the front door, I watched it become ajar, and entered Rachel. I took one last look at the bar, and the man was gone. All the negative and envious thoughts that I had in the last 5 minutes were gone. It didn’t matter anymore. Rachel was here, I felt a wave of calm rush over me. I gave her the same look I’d always given her since the first day we met.   
  
I still am able to smell the spring air of the park that day. In the middle of a busy city, the park was the sense of peace in a concrete ocean that I needed. It was my island. Meeting Rachel is the one memory I replay in my head when I need to think of a happy time in my life- not saying that the rest of our time isn’t happy, this one is just my favorite.   
  
She sat before me, placing her patterned, purple purse on the floor to her left, next to the wall. Purple was Rachel’s favorite color. Mine, Green, if you were curious.  It’d been at least a minute now. And not one word was spoken between the two of us, just admiring each other for a moment. I broke.   
  
“So, how is work treating you? Working that big bank life now! Haha!” I asked playfully.  
  
“Well,” She began proudly.  
  
“They definitely keep me fed. Not really a dull moment so far, besides the meetings. But.. I digress. I like it, I really do. It’s much better than what we had before. The money no doubt”.  
  
“I bet.”  
  
I was so happy for Rachel. She’s right, though. I made decent money, but this was a huge upgrade from what either of us had ever been familiar with.   
  
We eventually ordered, and caught up with each other. While it wasn’t long distance, we’d only be able to visit every couple of days or so- It’s just how things worked out, to be honest. The eventual goal is to live together but for now it’s just not possible.   
  
I got the seafood, her pasta dish. Too much pepper for me, though I don’t want to bother the waitress so I dealt with it. Rachel pushed her plate away with a satisfied sigh. “

“Thanks for dinner,” she said, leaning back in her chair. 'It was nice catching up.'

I nodded, feeling a pang of reluctance as reality set in. “Anytime.” I replied, though my heart felt heavier than the words implied. As we walked out of the restaurant, the cool evening air wrapped around us. Rachel paused by her car, turning to face me with a warm smile. 'I'll call you when I get home. And I’ll see you tomorrow”' she promised, leaning in for a quick kiss. I watched her drive away, the red taillights fading into the night. With a sigh, I turned towards my own car, the familiar routine of driving home alone settling in once again.

“Shit” I mumble to myself after dropping my apartment keys on the ground. After some wrestling with the door handle it opens and out comes the smell of my apartment. Something about the smell of cheap grocery store candles always stood out; right now, this one is a soft, warm smell of spices. It creates a welcoming and familiar environment. They say the sense of smell is closely linked with memory. I like it.   

After some general tidying of my space, I retreat to the white couch in the living room and sigh. I get comfortable on the couch. It’s only 8 PM, but my eyes begin to close. Vivid dreams dance before me. Flashes of environments I’d never seen before come into my vision.

 I sit on a mound, overlooking a lively, flowing stream. Peace. That’s the best way to describe the feeling. Longing for something I couldn’t find in my daily life, only in my dreams. I take a deep breath. But this was different from the regular world. The grass I sat on wasn’t lush green but a formal blue, cut flat on top. I didn’t mind the difference. I began to embrace it. What is life without experiencing something new? I sprawl out on the grassy mound below me, feeling the brisk wind flow across my bare skin. From the ground, I watch the clear sky above me. The simple sound of nature just existing created the ultimate peace for me. Everything was blue here. It envelops me. Before, I had embraced it, but now I had no choice.

Screams.

I was stuck. A formless shape began to lay over me, pinning me to the mound. My ear canals puckered; it was so loud. That's all I could hear. A scream. A constant, flesh-eating scream. Panic races over me, but still I can’t move. I just want the yelling to stop. I don’t mind not being able to move. Just stop the screaming. It gets louder. Louder than I can begin to tolerate. The shape blanketed me completely, it *was* me. I knew nothing more than only this formless thing now. I couldn’t see anything. I had become just a pile of flesh surrounded by a blue mold. I started screaming at myself. It was useless; no one was coming to save me. I still couldn't see anything but I could feel my vision and consciousness start to fade out. 

But just as it started, it stopped. I was awake. No more mound. Just a tattered white couch, the kind you'd find in a grandmother’s house. Weathered, aged. My heart pounds in my chest like a man trapped, trying to escape. Maybe the man in my chest was me. I catch my breath. I am calm again. My watch beeps and flickers. 1 AM, “How long was I out?” I think. The cold air from the vents softly brushed my skin, the once alive street my apartment overlooks had vanished. 

I stand up after some time, and make my way to bed. Follow the usual nighttime routine, nothing out of the ordinary. My room was a good sleeping temperature, underneath the comforter it wouldn’t take long for me to pass out again. The thought of the dream I just got out of mocked me, though. It was hard not to think about. Things felt so real. I really felt scared. Whatever time it was, I finally drifted off to sleep. No strange dreams this time, though. 

Across my room began the frequent and rather annoying sound of my alarm clock. It takes some willpower to get out of bed sometimes, for sure, but alas I power through & begin my day. The usual routine takes place, and frankly nothing out of the ordinary. My morning schedule is mirrored each weekday of every year. Humans are animals. Routine is what knows us best. Get my suit on; a dark navy today. I give myself one last sharp look in the mirror, before I decide it’s time to go. Same as yesterday; metal grates below me push in as my weight falls upon them. I walk slow. The apartment door slightly buckles as I open it, the rust on it creeping in.  

Another part of my routine is walking to the Ma and Pop coffee shop, I’m a regular there. It’s a 10 minute walk or so, depending on the foot traffic. Today is another beautiful day. The sun, shining. Weather was perfect. Upper 60s weather is simply the best in my opinion.

 One time, in Mr. Wescotts class, he led us outside the stuffy highschool classroom and into a small batch of trees neighboring my school. My classmates and I gathered in the circle around the trees. He held up a worn copy of Thoreau's "Walden", crisp leaves crunching beneath his feet; and began to read aloud:

 "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.".  He closed the book and looked at us, his eyes twinkling with enthusiasm. "Thoreau understood that nature offers us lessons we can't find in books.” He continued, and gestured to the trees around us. "Think of these trees as the great poets and thinkers of the world. They stand tall and silent, yet they have so much to tell us if we take the time to listen.” 

I think about that moment a lot. I think about his teachings to us, and his importance of self. Lately, I’ve been pondering reaching out to him and catching up. But, I’m not sure he’s still working at Walker High School anymore. 

 As I walk toward the paned doors of the downtown bricked building, incoming crisp autumn air touches my cheek in a comforting way- my favorite season. Bells ring after the front door becomes ajar. “Morning Charlie, I’ve got yours ready right here” Said Norma, who happily sighed as I walked in. Norma, the owner, had that place for longer than I’d been alive. At least 30 long years of her life had gone into that pile of bricks. My usual order was an Americano with only a little bit of cream. I give Norma some cash and offer a polite smile as I grab the paper cup seated just in front of me. It’s still hot, so I take a quick seat by the front windows before I walk to work. Cars used to be so full of color, and now anything other than Black, Grey, or Maybe white tend to stick out like a sore thumb. I see them pass by on the other side of this window; traffic hasn’t quite picked up to its usual degree yet. Suits begin to scurry by, everyone else is off to work now- I always try to get my coffee ‘fore everyone else comes in, and fortunately today was one of those days. You never know what’s going on with an individual, that’s what makes people-watching so entertaining to me. 

Like the older fellow wearing just a shirt & shorts on this chilly morning, where on earth was he walking to? I blow into the lid of my coffee and take a sip. “Shit” I whisper. Hot as lava.  How about the younger woman trying to make a name for herself? What about the- 

I spat out my coffee. The brown liquid emulsifies with the table, the glass pane parallel to me now stained with Americano. The burning hot drink pouring onto me from the table I sat at- did not matter. What mattered in that moment was what my eyes were communicating to me. I don’t know which neuron was for pain but at this moment it’s as if I never even had one. The only thing I knew this morning was a tall, stark figure in a navy blue suit. The same shade of cloth my skin brushes against now. I couldn’t believe it. 

The thoughts I had yesterday.. To think they were a one time thing was completely foolish by me. I never noticed that everyone else had noticed me. It was like a spell was cast upon me, this was the only thing I knew right now. My legs tightened, my knees flexed. I stood up and burst out the door. Left. Right. Which way did he go? Left. Pushing through crowds of people, I attempt to follow the figure. In this downward stream I find myself fighting upwards. I am an animal hunting its prey. My nose is a Bloodhound and my eyes an Owl. 

“Out of the fucking way!” I pushed through the shoulders of two business people slowly straddling along the gray pavement. One of them hits a short tree & the leaves rustle. What once was my walk of purpose had now turned into a pursuit. I followed him, turn by turn. His stride was simply unmatched by any measly presence in the area. At the final left I see his pace pick up. I can’t reach him. Whatever I am, he is better. I am outpaced. My heart catches up to me. The man fades away from my view.

I return to reality, not realizing the stain which now tattered my suit torso. The walk to work was nothing short of empty. My mind no longer chained, bound, to the idea of that figure. Work was normal. I appreciate normal things sometimes. A lot of the time, actually. I am a normal man. In fact, the rest of the day carried on as if nothing even happened in the morning. For that matter, so did the week. And the month. That 24 hour time period became quarantined in a set of memories that might never arise again, given sometime. 

Given the time, that is. Sometimes, curiosity might get the better of one. I am one. Even though things died down, and it’d been days since I saw him, I wanted more. A virus lives within me, and I am a healthy host for all of its desires. My head rests upon the corkboard, pointed at the floor. Deep in thought I pondered where I might see him again. In my right hand rests a blue pin. I tighten my hand, and place it on the map nailed to my board. I had to find him again, I had to. Days turned into weeks, and the city moved on without pause. I found solace in the mundane, the predictability of my morning coffee and the rhythmic hum of my daily commute. But every now and then, I would catch myself glancing around corners, hoping to catch a glimpse of a man who had stirred something so unsettling within me. 

Rachel and I continued our dance of short visits and long phone calls, each interaction a poignant reminder of the life we were building together despite its imperfections. One evening, as we nestled into our favorite corner of La Dolce Vita, the warm ambiance enveloped us in a cocoon of familiarity and comfort. Rachel reached across the table, her fingers intertwined with mine, and gave a gentle squeeze. "You've been distant," she said, her eyes searching mine. "Is everything okay?" 

Her words, gentle and soothing, were like a balm to my troubled soul. I could feel her love enveloping me, a stark contrast to the swirling chaos in my mind. I reflected on the first time I had ever seen her, in a quiet library. She was standing by the classics section, looking lost among the shelves of timeless literature. I had suggested a novel by Ken Kesey, but the moment our eyes met, the suggestion seemed trivial. The warmth of that old library had felt like a sanctuary, a place where I had first felt a connection that transcended words.

My mind becomes flooded. Liquid. A liquid pulses through my veins. Everything I see is only a drop of darkness in an ocean I’ve stained black. 

“Yeah, babe. I’m okay. I just started thinking about my mom again lately.” I squeaked out. My head no longer positioned into her lost eyes. 

“I’m so sorry. I know her death was hard on you. I want to give you the space you need; just let me in when you can. I love you, Charlie” Her words should have been a comfort, but they only amplified the weight of the lie I had just told. It wasn’t entirely untrue, but it wasn’t the whole truth either. The heaviness of my unspoken thoughts pressed heavily on my chest, a constant reminder of the chasm growing between us. In that moment, I felt the sting of dishonesty, a painful reminder of how far I had drifted from the person who meant the most to me in this world.

I lay next to Rachel on her bed, her breathing soft and steady as she slept. I, however, remained wide awake, my mind restless despite the brisk air from the open window. The memory of his perfect posture and unshakable presence haunted me, leaving me a shell of myself, my focus shattered. The thoughts kept creeping in, no matter how hard I tried to ignore them.

For Rachel, I thought. I need to get it together for her sake. She’s so important to me; I can’t risk losing her. Life continued to move forward, and surprisingly, I found myself enjoying parts of it. The following week brought a semblance of normalcy back into my life. I returned to work, greeted by familiar faces and the routine tasks that had once felt monotonous but now provided a strange comfort. Mornings were spent with colleagues over coffee, discussing the latest office gossip and upcoming projects. My productivity began to improve, and I even managed to close a few important deals, earning nods of approval from my boss.

A subtle uneasiness lingered, like a shadow that refused to dissipate. During lunch breaks, I found myself drawn to the window, watching the world outside with a restless curiosity. The busy streets and bustling crowds were a reminder of the city’s relentless pace, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing.

My conversations with Rachel felt more distant, her voice a gentle reminder of the life I was neglecting. Navigating through meetings and deadlines became a mechanical routine, my interactions with colleagues devoid of real connection. The office felt like a stage where I executed my role with robotic precision. Conversations about weekend plans or vacations seemed trivial, an escape from the deeper unrest brewing within me. Evenings at home were a delicate refuge from the chaos. Preparing a meal brought a soothing rhythm to my fractured thoughts, the boil of the kettle and the hum of the refrigerator offering brief respite. Rachel’s calls, however brief, were a lifeline. Her voice was a warm embrace, pulling me back from the precipice of my obsession. Each "I love you" was an anchor amidst the swirling chaos of my mind. As my fixation on the man deepened, Rachel's reassurances began to clash with the growing darkness within me. Her words, once a source of solace, struggled to counterbalance the mounting tension and agitation. This inner conflict escalated, pushing me toward an inevitable confrontation, where the man’s spectral presence became a tangible and disturbing force.

As the day wore on and the office lights flickered to life, I found myself sinking deeper into the work. Deadlines loomed like dark clouds, and the hum of the air conditioning became a steady, droning companion. The usual chatter and clatter of the office had faded, leaving only the soft rustle of papers and the occasional clink of a coffee cup. My desk, cluttered with documents and notes, felt like a small world of its own. Hours passed unnoticed until the sky outside darkened, casting a warm glow through the windows. As I wrapped up my tasks, a sense of quiet accomplishment settled in. Despite the long hours, there was a satisfying feeling in having tackled the day's challenges. The city lights twinkled outside, a comforting reminder of the world beyond the office. With a sigh of relief, I packed up and headed out, looking forward to a quiet evening at home, where the routine of dinner and relaxation awaited.

I found myself waiting for the bus home, the rain falling steadily around me. The chill in the air was brisk but refreshing, and the gentle droplets of rain felt soothing against my skin. It was the kind of night that made you want to curl up and sleep in. I gazed at the bench I was sitting on, taking in the faded drawings and names etched into its surface. The carvings seemed to tell stories of others who had waited here before me, adding a touch of quiet nostalgia to the rainy evening; but my gaze switched. It switches to what stands in front of me, across the street. 

My eyes grow wide, I am a deer in headlights. My heart, sinking to the bottom of my torso. I hadn’t even noticed I gave myself a splinter with the iron grip I now had on this bench. There he was, under the neon glow of a flickering sign. He’s a void that resonates within me. Facing me, no movement. He was my stalker. Or was I stalking him? The pathogen in me, now reawoken, mutated into a flesh eating monster. I walk towards him, my pace quick. What burned within me now was no longer an obsession. No more a passion. No. This was now an anger that no one word could describe. The blood under my skin is as hot as a dying star. He is a mere few feet from me now. 

“Who the fuck are you!” My teeth grind against each other. I feel the enamel scraping off onto my tongue. I push him into the alleyway just behind him. He falls back upon cold and wet concrete. He sits up, crawling backwards with his arms, eventually reaching a blue dumpster. Rain dripped from my eyelids- you wouldn’t even notice the tears I was shedding this moment. How much this now mattered to me. Tonight, his suit was a clean black. No color. It hid the rain falling onto the expertly made cloth. His palms open up and hands in front of his face. A sign of peace. But the man who became my Devil would know no peace tonight. I left the mask on the shelf this evening. This rage was the real me. No more pretending that he did not eat up the last few months of my life. Sleepless nights. Days, droning- on, and on, and on. He got in the way of my Rachel. I love her so much. I could not let this figure once again make me a lonely puppet on its string, dancing along with the stillness of the wind. 

I swat away its hands from its face, and grasp his collar. I was all muscle now; it lifted from the ground like a feather. Back, sprawled out against the brick wall now. My hands are a vice grip around its throat. It tried to fight back but the obsession of this figure within me was too strong to care. I could almost feel my hands touch each other around its neck. A black hole creeps into my eyesight and soon becomes the only thing I can see. The world narrows down to this singular, suffocating point, where rage and despair converge into a singularity. The rain continues to fall, a relentless reminder of the world outside this dark, oppressive space. My breaths come in harsh, uneven gasps, each one a struggle to maintain the fragile semblance of control. I can hear my own heartbeat pounding in my ears, deafening, drowning out any remaining shred of reason.

Its struggles weaken. Its eyes, once so piercing, now grow dim, reflecting the flickering light of the alley. The weight of what I am doing crashes over me, but it is too late. The line between the monster I have become and the man I used to be has blurred beyond recognition. The rage that fueled me now feels like a void, consuming everything it touches. Its body goes limp in my grasp, and I release it, stepping back. The rain washes over me, mingling with the sweat and tears, as I stare at the broken figure on the ground. The alley, now silent except for the steady patter of rain, seems to echo with the gravity of what I have done.
