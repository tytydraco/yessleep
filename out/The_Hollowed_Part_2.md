I’m still kicking, but the news isn’t good. It doesn’t matter how many miles I put between me and that thing; it always catches up within the day. I abandoned my family, my friends, everything. I ran to the other side of the country, then the other side of the world, and still, I couldn’t get a full 24 hours of relief. I can tell it has taken more from me, because I don’t miss the life I left anymore. My heart ached being away from my wife and my children. I wept knowing how confused they must be. How worried, scared, sad. Now all I know is what I should feel. Sonny was right. I’ve lost my ability to feel but I still remember how I am supposed to feel. Years of social conditioning I suppose. It’s infuriating.

I understand why Sonny went mad now. I feel myself slipping. I can’t stop to sleep; I can’t stop to eat. Anytime I stop it catches me. It tears into me, and it hollows me out. Even if I survive this, I don’t know if I’ll still be me. Am I me anymore? How can I return to a family that I can’t feel love for? I could try to fake it; I could try to live off the memories of my love for them. Would they know? I might do more harm than good trying. It would be so much effort too. I know I have a duty to them but how much is reasonable to expect? What if I want to just live alone after this? Is that so wrong? My head is telling me yes, it’s awful to think this way, but my heart is silent.

All of that is assuming I make it out of this alive. I’m no saint like Sonny. I’m more likely to crack faster than he did. I already have started to hear its whispers. It tells me to strangle the old lady next to me on the plane. It tells me to kill the cab driver and steal his car. It doesn’t matter how far I get; I can always hear it whispering. When it is hollowing me, it might be leaving something to fill the void. Something of itself to poison what little of me is left inside. I will not listen. I will not break yet.

My goal is to find out all I can about these things and report them here. The more I find, the better a chance we all have. If I can feel anything I know I can still feel fear and spite. Funny, that’s what Sonny was left with too. I wonder if the Hollowers have a preferred order of emotions they devour. I wonder if there is a reason to why they target those emotions, or if they just want their victims to suffer as much as possible. I wouldn’t put it past them to be so sadistic. 

Here's what I’ve found. You can’t see them until they have struck you. There are many of them, not exactly a 1 for 1 ratio, but a rough estimate would be maybe 1 for every 100 people. They are more prevalent in certain areas; cemeteries, hospitals, and veterinary hospitals are big ones. I see more in the city than I do in rural areas, but when I do see them in rural areas, they are tightly packed. I’ve never seen more than one stalking a single person. They can go through certain matter, seemingly at will. I’ve seen them walk through walls, phase through speeding traffic, and even walk through other people without attacking them. I haven’t found any weapons that work. Guns, baseball bats, Tasers, fire, light, water, salt, silver, gold, loud noise, acid, smoke, Holy water, crucifix, Star of David, Bible, Qur'an, Book of Mormon. Nothing works. I don’t know of any Pagan, Norse, Greek, Roman or Egyptian holy items so if you have any recommendations, I’ll be more than happy to try. I’ll try anything at this point. Finally, when it strikes you, you will feel nothing but pain and cold. The pain will overwhelm you at first, it feels just like a mortal wound. The cold comes after, right where it struck it will feel as if your body was devoid of all warmth since creation. It will not cease until hours after. The cold comes from the creature. They are absolute zero. 

Now for my speculations. I think they activate off tragedy. That’s why they try to drive their victims to do heinous acts. I’ve seen them on television. I’ve seen one of those things recently on reporting of that mass casualty story. I’ve even gone back and watched reports on past events and sometimes I’ve seen them there too. It’s not every time, some people are just genuinely evil, but it’s not an insignificant amount either. Tragedy must weaken our defenses or strengthen their powers. The more tragedy they create, the more they get to feed. I also believe they must leave a mark on their victims, something that signifies that this prey is theirs and that keeps others from muscling in on their territory. While testing weapons on one of them it did acknowledge my existence, but it never tried to retaliate. It stood there and stared at me for a while before returning to stalking its prey. I think they are intelligent; they certainly show signs of intentional behavior. 

Mine likes to wait until I pass out from exhaustion before striking. Mine likes to taunt me a lot. On the way to the airport, I hit traffic. While stuck it ran in and out of my vehicle multiple times. It walked into the back seat of my car and sat there staring at me through the rear-view mirror. I asked what its name is, but it did not respond. I asked why it hunts me, but it did not respond. I asked what it wanted, but it did not respond. I asked if it is the one that killed Sonny, and it laughed.

I don’t know how much I have left in me; it has taken from me a few times now. I will do my best to survive, relay what information I can, and beat this thing. If any of you are in the same boat as I am, stay strong.
