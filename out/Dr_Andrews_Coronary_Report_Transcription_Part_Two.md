[**CAMERA: ON**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11d1f96/a_barista_an_overworked_daycare_attendant_a/)

"Alright, hoping this ol' camera is working. My name is Doctor Matthew Andrews, the coroner here at Millsview Hospital. I'm currently going to be accessing the body of a... Mr. Will Cheng. Ah, I actually know this boy, he's the son of Ms. Cheng, very sad to see him go. No matter, on with the log."

*Shuffling heard in background, sheet moving heard in background.*

"Okay... Mr. Cheng here died due to a seizure that occurred while he was in a coma, time of death around six in the morning. If I could only find my scalpel, I should really just keep that in my coat pocket."

*Chuckling from Dr. Andrews is heard.*

"We'll be making the first incision around his chest area, in a "Y" shape, like usual."

*Humming heard in background from Dr. Andrews.*

"Well, it's sort of nice, it's like I have someone to listen to my banter... although instating this whole policy due to the lawsuit last month is a bit... overkill I'd say. I mean, recording every single one of my coronary reports? Absurd!"

"You see, last month I had a young girls body come in, died after being impaled by a kitchen knife her father laid carelessly about... she fell directly onto it. Idiotic behavior resulted in the death of the girl, obviously. The girl might've lived if she had just grabbed onto something. But of course, it's the father's fault. I don't know how anyone could live with themselves knowing they'd essentially killed their own daughter. Monsters, I tell you."

"The girl's father sued, saying *I* hadn't recorded enough information on the report, and that I was jumping to conclusion off of bias, can you believe it? Man was insane, I tell you, insane."

*Sound of liquid in background*

"Ah, shit, accidentally spilt my drink... I better clean that up later. Ah, great, and my lab coat is all dirty. How... annoying."

*Groan heard, following shuffling of clothing, inferencing based off text being Dr. Andrews lab coat.*

"Bit unsanitary, but I can't work in a wet lab coat, can I? I got to remind myself to repair that old coat rack, the damn thing is constantly tipping over, such an annoyance!"

"Alright, taking a sample of Cheng's blood here, and now placing it in one of these handy dandy machines that analyze the blood, it's quite interesting actually, it tests the blood in such a short amount of time, the entire toxicology department has been downsized to one person, showing how good these machines are! Hopefully they don't take *my* job.

*Chuckling from Dr. Andrews is heard.*

"While that machine does its thing, I'll be continuing the incisions in Cheng. So far, it doesn't seem as if the seizure was related in any way to his nerve system, which is a bit odd. Just finished the incisions, now starting the investigation into the organs."

*Humming head in background from Dr. Andrews.*

"Today's Martha's birthday, she would've turned sixteen today, she would've been able to drive! I still think about that day every single day."

Tone and volume of Dr. Andrews voice gets less bubbly, more "sadder," and quieter.

"Martha was nine years old and desperate to fit in... she was invited to this girl, Josephine Stuart's birthday sleepover. It was supposed to be *"all the rave, Dad!"* I was supposed to be at home, watching the game, on my fifth beer. It was supposed to be a good night, the fire was roaring, and the cold couldn't get inside. But of course, I *had* to drive Martha, Lauren said it was *"good bonding time with your daughter!"* I told her I didn't want to do it!

"I brought a beer with me to the car, to try and savor the night, you know? Martha put her sleeping bag in the back, along with her bag, and I drove her over to the house, but of course the damn intersection stopped us. The light... the light was green; I know it was. The camera in that area was broken, so there wasn't any proof that it wasn't green. It had to have been green, my memory is just cloudy from that night."

"Martha was complaining about how she forgot her stuffed animal, and to... to teach her a lesson I swerved the car around, took a U-turn, nothing crazy, it's not even that illegal."

"Ford hit us straight on, some fucking crazy person didn't see the red light. Because the light was red, not green. It had to have been red for him. The car apparently tried to stop, but there was ice, and he wasn't able to. The Ford collided with my car, and the ladder on top of the Ford flew off, right into..."

"Right into Martha's car seat. It's all that man's fault, and God knew it, so he punished the man. The man's seat belt stopped working, and he got flung out that God damn windshield. He deserved it, he killed my daughter."

"No other cars were there that night except for mine, the Ford, and a dozen police officers. I'm great friends with the police officers, I know everyone in town! They all helped me out of the car, gave me their condolences... those officers are great people. Especially Officer Victor. God, that man did so much for me. He helped me through tough times, pointed me in the way of pastors who could help me through my situation."

"It's not like it mattered, but he even threw away the beer bottle in the cup holder for me. We never really spoke of that, though. It's not like it was my fault, though."

"Goodness, I probably sound insane talking to myself in here, there's no one even here, just this dumb camera footage no one will ever review."

*Light chuckle, still quieter and "sadder."*

*Dinging noise heard in background*

"Ah! Toxicology report is back, let's see... according to this Cheng was... hm."

"This can't be right... the toxicology report has some... concerning details in it, I'm going to quickly write them down on a sticky note and review them later so the body doesn't get too warm."

*Quick scribbling noise heard.*

"Alright, getting back to the body..."

*Sudden banging noise heard, presumably from morgue freezer door.*

"What in the world, the freezer door just swung open, how odd."

*Shutting of freezer door heard.*

*Sudden banging noise heard, presumably from morgue freezer door.*

"Hm. Seems as if multiple doors in here are broken."

*Liquid noise heard, and yelp from Dr. Andrews.*

"Oh goodness, almost slipped on the flask, I seriously must clean that up."

*Shutting of freezer door heard.*

*Sudden banging noise heard, presumably from morgue freezer door, followed by multiple other freezer doors banging open, and closed.*

"Alright, this is odd."

*Sound of computer suddenly turning on, playing news clip. Each highlighted word was louder than the others.*

*"Today, tragedy struck in the small town of Millsview yesterday at around 7:00 PM, after beloved doctors' daughter, Martha Andrews tragically dies after being struck in head by a loosely secured ladder on top of a Ford truck that collided with Dr. Andrews car, reports here are saying-"*

*Sound of computer switching audios, this time to the "Mom Spot" blog.*

*"Managing children is hard, especially with that phrase. "****It's your fault****, not mine!" Well, today-"*

*Sound of computer switching audios, this time to a computer ad.*

*"It's hard breaking a habit, but people want to support you. Alcoholics anonymous is a group meant to-"*

*Sound of computer switching audios, this time to a different computer ad.*

*"UBreakIFix can fix it, even if* ***it is YOUR fault!"***

*Sound of computer switching audios, this time to a Facebook post.*

*"Some fucking idiot did a U-turn in the middle of the road yesterday, it totally pissed me o-"*

*Sound of computer switching audios, this time to a podcast.*

*"You're listening to Apple Music's podcast,* ***It's Your Fault.*** *I'm your host-"*

*Sound of computer suddenly turning off.*

"What the fuck."

*Dr. Andrews voice sounds panicked, his breath quickening.*

"No, no, this is fucking insane, it wasn't my fault, I swear!"

*Sound of computer suddenly turning on, videos of Dr. Andrews past coronary reports are pulled up and begin playing random clips. Each highlighter word was louder than the others.*

\*"\****It's*** *the pulmonary vessel that-"*

*"I kept on trying to tell him it was* ***your***\*'s, not mine!"\*

*"You see, the incision here clearly shows Dr. Edmont was not at* ***fault."***

"WHO THE FUCK IS DOING THAT? WHO'S THERE?"

*Dr. Andrews is now telling, loudly, loud foot steps are heard in background.*

*A creaking noise is heard, and Dr. Andrews footsteps suddenly stop, and are replaced with a quick yelp, and a "squeaking" sound, something light then falls to the floor, following something louder, and then a finally yelp is heard from Dr. Andrews before the audio stops.*

**CAMERA: OFF**

*Based on the video from Dr. Andrews report, Dr. Andrews was quickly walking toward his wallet, keys, and phone, when suddenly one of the freezer doors opens up and hit him in the back, causing him to take a quick step forward. That step forward was directly in a puddle of alcohol, leaked from a flask Dr. Andrews had dropped earlier during the report. Trying to catch himself, Dr Andrews grabbed onto the nearest object, a coat rack, however the coatrack was not able to support him, and cracked in half, causing the coat rack to tip over, along with Dr. Andrews coat, and Dr. Andrews. In Dr. Andrews pocket was his scalpel, which slipped out of his pocket as he fell, causing him to fall directly on top of it. Dr. Andrews was impaled at around 7:00 P.M. by his own scalpel, resulting from the accident that took place.*

*The camera oddly turns off without any interaction from outside forced.*

*The camera is not turned on again until a few hours later, this time by a panicked Aiden Walker, a barista employed at the hospital's "Mocha Cafe."*
