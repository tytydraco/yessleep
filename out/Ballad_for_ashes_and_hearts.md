PART ONE:

 

A dim red glow tells me it’ FRI 1:11 AM. Slowly, I begin to crawl out of the drenched bed, stumble into a shower. Briefly checking the mirror, I conclude that I still look like crap. When I get out, the walls are just as sweaty as I had been a few minutes ago. Stepping outside and waiting for a moment, my eyes once again adjusted to the darkness. I make my way into the living room, carefully avoiding the creaky floorboards so I don’t wake my parents.

When I was passing by their bedroom, I peeped through the half open door. The cross above their bed standing guard as always. My room feels dirty; the air is stale and the sweat from my nightmare doesn’t help. Cardboard boxes full of my things are laying on the floor, most of the shelves are empty. I grab my phone from the bedside table and lie down on the couch in the living room. Knowing I wouldn’t be able to fall asleep again, I just doomscroll Instagram for a while. The time seems to be frozen in place.

After a couple of hours and not wanting to wait any longer, I decided to show up at work early. Thinking that Nikole would appreciate the company. Not like I could sleep anyway. It was 4AM when I sat in the car. Faded memories of my nightmare resurface and I paranoidly check the back seat to see if I’m truly alone. Grateful that the only thing sitting on the backseat is an empty box of pizza I failed to throw out yesterday. With the key in the start position, my dad’s corolla complains for a moment and then starts.

The city is very calm at this early hour. There are barely any pedestrians. For the whole drive I’ve only seen one or two other cars. Only a few apartments have lights on at this hour. When I get deeper into the city, I notice some business owners are preparing their shops for the day. A young girl in running attire walking her dog in the park. Some old folks smoke on the balcony.

As I pull around the final corner, the hospital comes into view. Behind it, a dim orange glow is becoming visible in the clear sky. With my ID card ready I stopped the car at the gatehouse. The gatekeeper, and older man with an astonishing white beard – It’s only flaw a thin scar running down his lover left cheek – gestures at me to roll down my window. 

“Coming in early today Milan? You seem a bit more tired than usual, everything all right my boy?” I cleared my throat preparing to use my voice for the first time today.

“Yeah, nothing a good cigarette and warm cup of coffee couldn’t fix” The first syllables rasp.

After a barely noticeable, understanding nod, he opens the gate for me. The parking lot is almost empty so finding a good spot isn’t difficult. After getting out of the car I wave at the pair of nurses in front of the side entrance, patting my pocket for the reassuring feel of the carton box and lighter. I slam the door shut and with a cigarette in my mouth I approach the nurses, we exchange a few tired looks. Swallows nesting on the balconies slowly come alive.

“How was the night?” I said.

“Ah you know, the same old” said Andrea.  

“Why so early?” came the other nurse.

“Couldn’t sleep, so I decided to check in early”

“I wish I had that kind of motivation in the morning” mumbles Andrea jokingly.

I snuff out the spent cigarette and throw it into the ashtray and wish the nurses a pleasant day. The damn coffee machine in the main hall is broken, which greatly disappoints me. Thinking back, I should have made some while I was at home. I decided to use the stairs this time, maybe making my heart work would wake me up a little. The changing room smells of disinfectant and something I have never been able to place. Now dressed in all blue scrubs I enter the ward. Nikole gives me a surprised look.

“An early bird for a change?” I hug her like we didn’t see each other for a year.

“Thought I would surprise you today”

“You look horrible, couldn’t sleep again?”

“Yeah, these past weeks are full of headaches”

“Did you finish packing your things up?”

“Almost, it’s going to take a few trips to move all of that. Just pass me the shift and head back home all right?” We sat down.

“Well, you know I ain’t gonna complain. We only have two patients” she yawns.

“They let Miss Kovacs home yesterday?” I fidget with Father Joseph’s calling card.

“No, she has been transported to St. Peter’s. Something about internal bleeding, sorry, I don’t know more”

“Shame, she was getting better really quickly, what about these two?”

“You already know Mr. Andras and the new one had cerebral ischemia but they caught it early so he should be relatively fine. Otherwise, vitals stable, I’ve already administered the heparin for 6AM so don’t worry about that” 

“So, it wasn’t too busy?” I try to wipe the tiredness from my face to no avail.

“I even managed to close my eyes for a while after 2AM”

“Fine, I’ll take over then. Go home sweetie, get some sleep for me”

“The new bed is supposed to arrive today” she winks at me.

After signing some paperwork, she comes back to me. She leans in for a kiss, packs her thing up and reluctantly leaves the ward. I wonder what she’d say if I went to shower with her. I shake my dirty thoughts away. Anette was my assistant for today, she is an older lady, but I quite like her. She could be my mother three times over. We finished with the morning hygiene at around 8AM, I still managed to get sweaty. After all, Mr. Andras wasn’t a particularly thin man. Then I sat down at the desk and began doing paperwork. A flash brings up the nightmare back and I quickly blink it away.

While writing, I imagined Nikole, in her small, but cozy bed, my sleeping beauty. We have known each other since childhood. Our fathers were best friends and as a result, we often visited them in their house not too far from the city. It was a really nice place. They had a classic eastern European two story house in a clearing above the city, surrounded by tall and very old spruce trees. The winters there were amazing, the howl of wind in the branches, mountains covered with snow and an inlaid brick fireplace gave the house a warm welcoming vibe.

Her mother was probably the best cook I knew, the whole house smelled of sweetness because of her. She also has an older brother, Ivan. thought of him as a cool older brother because he was in his late teens. I look at my right palm, a line of scarred tissue reminds me of the stupid blood brother thing. We really were stupid weren’t we.  

I enjoyed playing with Nikole. We used to run around the backyard like crazy, often coming inside only before dark. Always a few new bruises on our hands and legs. They had this cute little dog, sadly I can’t remember his name. But he really liked playing fetch with a frisbee. Nikole had this ability to talk me into doing things that almost always lead me to being in trouble.

I never refused her challenges, maybe because I wanted to show her how brave I was or maybe I wanted to impress her. One time she dared me to climb up one of the spruce trees. Confident I could do it I began climbing. About halfway towards the top I misjudged a branch, and it snapped under my weight. Gravity got the better of me and I fell, broke my hand in two places and dislocated my ankle. Fond memories.

A call from the lab snapped me back. They complained that one of the samples had coagulated, seems they screwed it up again. Annoyed I went to draw the blood again. Mr. Andras joked that I messed it up on purpose so I could torture him some more. He is one of those older men that you would consider your grandpa, likes to talk about the old days.

The new guy is in a coma, silently sleeping in his bed. His GCS was pretty good, above average for his condition I’d say. The Neurologist said that the clot has dissolved nicely and there shouldn’t be any permanent damage, so he might recover fully. He is a young guy, I wonder how this could have happened to him. I guess bad things happen regardless of age.

During lunch, Anette probed about my relationship with Nikole. This reminded me to call her after I finished eating. So, I grabbed a cigarette and went to the balcony. The hospital is a rather tall building, and it sits near the main square of the city. The view is pleasant. You can see all the way to the park, and the tall apartment buildings in the distance provide a nice backdrop. The church’s bell tower peaks around one of them. We aren’t supposed to smoke on the balcony, so I hid in the corner, out of view of the charge nurse if she decided to check on us.

After I have finished smoking, I grabbed my phone and dialed Nikole’s number. It just kept ringing. I tried again but she still didn’t pick up. Maybe she is busy assembling the new bed, but it still got me worried, so I just sent her a message that everything is all right and I’ll come over when I am finished at work. Her place isn’t far from here, I’d say about five minutes on foot. I let out a disappointed sigh and went back into the ward.

The charge nurse just entered and managed to startle me. I hope she didn’t notice the lighter in my hand, but I managed to hide it in my pocket quickly. She asked if we need any more supplies and I’ve passed her the list of things we were running low on. She thanked me and promptly left so I just sat back down.

It can get very hectic here when we are at full capacity but if we only have two clients, like today, there isn’t much work to be done. The new guy doesn’t have too much medication, and Mr. Andras should be transferred somewhere else soon since his condition is improving nicely. So during days like this I just need to distribute the IV drips on time and keep the clients clean and in as much comfort as the hospital can provide.

I realized how the time had flown by, and it was almost 6PM. Hurriedly finishing the paperwork and checking if our clients were happy and clean, I double checked if all meds had been distributed properly, all urine bags were empty, work surfaces clean.

Jana came to take the shift; she’s the only nurse in my age category. She looked at me with big eyes while I briefly explained what still needed to be done. After finishing with the formalities, she asked how I was doing. Of course, I said that I was fine. Not wanting to listen to her babbling I quickly but politely brushed her off. Passing through the changing room I tossed the scrubs into the used basket. Then I put on my civil clothing and sprayed myself with deodorant. A pointless act really, cigarette smoke will be the only thing coming from my clothes in but a few minutes.

I was surprised to see Nikole waiting next to my car. Her blond hair flowing with the light wind, she looked at me with her pretty, deep brown eyes and smiled her familiar smile. She was dressed in a gorgeous white sundress with red roses all over. I think to myself if I could be happy with anyone but her. I gently grab her behind the ear and give her a short, but passionate kiss.

“Where did you put your phone?” I queried.

“Oh, sorry about that, the bed has arrived, and I fell while carrying one of the boxes up the stairs”

“Are you all right” I check her hands and legs for bruises.

“Don’t worry I’m fine, I caught myself on the railing, but my phone slipped out of the pocket”

“So, it’s broken?”

“Yeah… the screen is shattered, and it doesn’t turn on. I’ve given it to the repair shop on my way here”

“As long as you aren’t hurt. You should have let the delivery guy carry it up”

“I wanted to help”

“Has the bed fit nicely?”

“Well, it’s a bit crammed but it looks nice”

“Do we go to your place, or do we go sit down somewhere first?”

“The Usual Place?” For a second, I forgot it’s the actual name of the restaurant.

“Sure, sounds great”

We got into the car, The Usual Place was on the other side of the city, and I didn’t feel like walking. Nikole didn’t protest, usually she prefers walking, but she seemed tired. She didn’t get much sleep either. During the short drive there we didn’t have much time for talking, she asked how my day went, how the patients were doing and so on.

I spent a good while looking for a place to park, The Usual Place is a busy restaurant. It has a nice, American Steakhouse vibe to it which gives it an unusual charm. But somehow, it doesn’t feel out of place. Despite its name, we don’t come here often. Not because it’s kind of expensive, but because it’s relatively far from the city center and I prefer take outs. It’s nice to go there from time to time.

When we got out of the car, there was a homeless looking person on the other side of the road. He stared at me intently and I did my best to ignore him. I don’t think Nikole noticed him. A beautiful carved, wooden sign above the entrance welcomed us. Passing through the door we are met with pleasant country music, a faint smell of well-aged whiskey and most salivating scents. It was almost full even during this evening hour.

I looked for an empty table and with a bit of trouble I found one. I gestured for her to take a seat first; she chose the better spot with a view of the street. I sat in front of her; my view consisted of a wall covered with paintings and pictures which I had no interest in. The chatter of people around us faded into the back of my mind. The menu here isn’t big, but each item is great in its own way. Almost as soon as we sat down a waiter came to our table.

Nikole chose some salad; she is a little obsessed with her physique. Not that she needs to look after it much, she looks great. Nonetheless whenever I order fries, I never get to enjoy more than a third of them. I ordered my favorite meal, of course with a side of fries and diet coke. The waiter was very polite and offered us some wine with a name I could never pronounce or remember, said that it comes somewhere from France. Unfortunately, I had to decline since I’m the driver today so only Nikole got to enjoy it. And so, we waited for our order.

“So… I went to visit mom” said Nikole.

“How is she?”

“Not great, when I reminded her that I am her daughter she didn’t believe me” She let out a long sigh “Only said that her daughter is much younger than me”  

One would expect I would have a great ability to talk to people going through bad times given my job, but this is not the case. Consoling people isn’t my strong side. I reached out to her hand and gently squeezed her thin fingers.

“I am so sorry to hear that, I should have been there with you. I can’t imagine what you are going through…”

“It’s just… I don’t know what will happen, I know what is happening to her but… seeing her like that”

“Are you all right?”

“I…, I am sorry for brin-“

“No, don’t say that. Just know whatever happens, I am here for you” I rudely interrupted her.

“I know you will” I feel her warm hand wrapping around mine.

“I love you”

“You know, I think I love you too” she says while resisting the urge to giggle, she always gets a little smug when I say it.

Noticing that she doesn’t want to continue with the topic, I try to shift the conversation towards something else.

“Sorry I’ve just noticed, Is that a new necklace? I swear I saw it somewhere before”

“Mom gave it to me on my 18th birthday” Fuck, I think at my failed attempt to sway the conversation elsewhere.

“Where did you find it?”

“In a box behind the old bed, I’ve completely forgotten I put it there”

I wanted to say something about how I keep forgetting things, realize that would just remind her of mom and promptly shut up.

“Have you thought about how you want to furnish the living room? I really hate the couch”

“Nah the couch is fine; the table bothers me more. The corners are pretty banged up”

“While we are at it, I think the whole room would use a fresh coat of paint”

“Do you have anything particular in mind?”

“I think we could shift the whole room to like, dark olive-green color palette”

“Oh no no no no no, you still have poor taste” she says while giggling. “You should probably leave this one to me”

“You got any better ideas?”

“I have a whole library on Pinterest ready, here, I’ll show you”

When the waiter brought our food, I noticed that he was giving a weird look in the direction of the entrance, but I thought nothing of it. I don’t want to take my eyes off my partner for any longer than I must. A small child is laughing somewhere in the far corner. I notice an almost inaudible clatter of dishes being washed in the kitchen. Needless to say, the food looks amazing, and tastes even better.

About halfway through our meal I noticed that Nikole was looking over my shoulder with an expression I couldn’t quite place. Is she confused? Shocked? Scared? My paranoid self was reminded of the nightmare, and I turned around to look. A few steps behind my seat, a man stands behind us. It’s the homeless man from outside. He is wearing a torn up and messy jean jacket, sweatpants covered with dust and grime but surprisingly, I don’t smell anything foul. Just as I am about to ask what he wants, Nikole speaks a single word.

“Ivan?” Two neurons in my brain form a new connection.

“I almost thought you won’t recognize me, Nikki” Mutters the ragged figure as he comes to the side of our table, grabs a chair and sits down.

“What are you doing here?” I ask.

“Just checking up on you two, it’s been a while, hasn’t it?”

He’s right, I haven’t seen him since Molly got sick. One of his hands still inside of a pocket, he’s fidgeting with something. Briefly letting my eyes slip away from Ivan’s presence, I notice that Nikole seems more scared now. I don’t feel comfortable with him anymore. It’s a shame, he used to be a good guy.

“You should leave” Ivan’s gaze snaps at me.

“I just sat down, don’t you want to hear what I have to say”

“No, we don’t” said Nikole.

Ivan laughs and shifts his gaze to her “Nikki, I’ve told you that if I ever see you with him again”

“Then what?!” I barked out.

“I am not talking to you. But I think you remember well don’t you, Nikki” he says while playing with her hair, my fists clench. Knuckles white from the tension.

“You gonna do what? Break us up?” I say mockingly.

“If you want to put it that way”

He spits on my plate; a few droplets land on my face. I noticed the dirt under his broken fingernails. I know he is on bad terms with Nikole but what is his problem with me?

“Fuck you”

“Milan this is between us”

“No it isn’t”

“I guess you really want to know, fine then, I’ll tell you” He leans closer to me, as he does, I finally smell what I expected earlier. “I told her that I’ll fucking kill you” he whispers into my ear in a quiet but menacing voice. Strange bugs crawling in his messy hair.

“You can try” I spring up from my seat, a hand lands on my shoulder from behind.

“Is this man bothering you?” asks the waiter.

“He was just leaving” Nikole reassures the waiter.

“No I fucking ain’t!”

The restaurant went quiet as Ivan got ready to throw a punch. He stands just a few centimeters in front of me; he is a bit shorter than I remember.

“Sir, I have to ask you to leave, we don’t want any trouble here” Ivan turns towards the waiter.

“Fine”

He pretends to be leaving but I don’t let my guard down. And rightfully so. He turns around quickly and throws a punch right at my face. I narrowly avoid it, and his fist grazes my ear.

“You stupid motherfucker”

I punched him in the stomach. People around us gasped in shock, a few flashes went off. Unfortunately, in the heat of the moment might have used a little too much force and knocked the wind out of him. Ivan bend, with hands on his stomach he went to one knee. While he tried to collect himself, I started feeling bad for the man.

This is the first time I have been in a fight – if it even can be called a fight – in a long time. The last time was during martial art training when I was a kid, my dad forced me to go to a few lessons. Honestly, I don’t remember anything about it. Some people stood and recorded the drama unfolding before them. Nikole didn’t seem happy.

“Listen, take a slow and deep breath” I said while patting his back. “it should go aw-“

He threw my hand off him.

“Don’t touch me asshole” 

“Sure”

He looked at me, face red from anger or lack of oxygen. Just then I noticed a pink hairclip laying on the ground. Ivan’s eyes widen; he throws himself on the ground to quickly pick it up. He takes it into his ugly fingers and freezes up for a moment. Nikole looks a bit frightened, like her heart stopped for a moment.

When he fully caught his breath, he stood upright. The waiter looked at me and sighed. Then he grabbed Ivan under the shoulder and escorted him out. Ivan shook him away; I’ve heard the chain around his neck snap. He stopped for a moment; the waiter held a necklace with a cross in his hand. Stretched his hand in front of Ivan so he took his belonging. I could still see that he was very angry.

“I saw him when we got here; I should have told you” said Nikole.

“I saw him too; just didn’t realize it was… him”

The waiter threw him out; I caught a glimpse of his angry face and hand showing me his crooked middle finger flailing in the air. The waiter looks at me, nods, and goes behind the counter to call someone. People were still looking; some began eating their food again.

“We should go”

“I agree” With a wallet in hand, I approach the counter.

“That would be uh… 40€ and 75 cents, please”

I handed him a 100€ bill. “Keep it”

“That’s too much sir”

“Are you kidding me? You are not a bouncer at a club. You shouldn’t deal with this kind of things”

“Mind If I ask you what that was about?”

“I… don’t know”

“I see this guy walking around often, he seemed to be a decent person for, you know, his situation”

“I remember him as such”

“Strange how fate plays with some people”

“Thank you, again”

“Don’t mention it, I think I’ll get some credit form that hot chick over there” He nods towards one of the female waiters, but I don’t look.

“I am sure you will, goodbye”

“See you again soon”

I get back to Nikole, gently hold her hand and guide her outside. Almost every person in the restaurant looks at us. I try my best to ignore them. Stepping out, I look around if that bastard is lurking somewhere but don’t see him anywhere. It’s slowly getting dark; a reverse of the sight I had this morning is on the opposite side of the sky. A police car is slowly driving down the street, the two men inside are looking around. Recognizing one of them as Anette’s husband, I wave to them, but they don’t notice.         

I take the pack of cigarettes from my pocket, look at it, think and put it back. Afraid that Ivan would show up again I don’t want to be here for a minute longer. Worried that my dad’s car was vandalized, I checked if the tires were flat, which surprisingly they aren’t. I don’t notice if the paint is scratched, maybe he hasn’t noticed us when we got here or he isn’t that petty.

“Your place?” I put the key into ignition.

“Do you want to deal with your parents?”

“That was rhetorical” (Yes, I still live at may parent’s, I just left college)

“I know, I’m just messing with you”

“Care to explain what happened back there?”

“I…, I don’t really want to talk about it right now. I’ll tell you later, I need to think” I nod, mess with my transmitter for a moment and play some music to release some of the tension.

Nikole is two years older than me. She helped me in college a lot, somehow, we both decided to study nursing independently. During college we hung out a lot, we studied in Prague and were in the same dormitory. It helped us become something more. We had more time for each other. Yeah, when we were younger, we often visited each other. But after her father left, my parents didn’t come around to their place anymore.

Or at least not as often, I think it was too awkward for my father. Going there on my own took around two hours by bike and a lot longer if I had to walk. She didn’t go to the same school as me, so our friendship slowly deteriorated. We still texted each other but her brother started taking the phone away from her, so we didn’t get to talk that much.

I digress, what I meant to say is she finished school two years sooner than I and she managed to get a good deal for a flat near the hospital. Even managed to secure me a cozy spot in the ICU. Now the plan was for me to help her furniture the apartment and move in with her. It felt lonely sleeping there when she was at work, so I mostly stayed with my parents for those nights.

Part of why I felt weird sleeping there when she was at work is because she only had single bed. Sleeping in it without her, I felt cold. The couch she has there isn’t too comfortable, and my neck always hurts after. We decided to fix this problem by buying the biggest bed that could fit inside the room.

When we arrived most of the windows in the building were already dark except the neighbor bellow us. I looked around while she fiddled with the keys, it felt like someone was watching us from a distance. I think it was around 10PM when we got in. Her place wasn’t big, just enough room for the two of us. A small kitchen, toilet combined with the shower, a decently sized bedroom and a living room.

Also a small balcony overlooking the square, I really enjoyed that place. It was a nice, cozy place although sometimes a bit crammed. We took a long, warm shower. While she made her hair I went to the balcony to enjoy one last cigarette for today, and later she joined me. The city was quiet at this time. The only thing I could hear was our neighbor watching some football match.

“Is now a good time?” She hands me an open bottle of cold beer. I blow off some smoke and take it “What’s better time than the present?”

“So… where do I start?”

“Wherever you want. And, by the way… if you are secretly mad at me, I’m sorry for not asking earlier. I just… didn’t want to push you…” after a moment of silence, she began speaking.

“It was hard on us you know, when mom got sick. My dad was at home less and less, said that he was working on something. I think he couldn’t bear the sight of her. Watching her slowly getting worse over time. One day, he came to us after he returned from work. Said that he would have to leave us for a while, promised that he would come back when he could.

I remember one day, after you and your parents left our house. He gathered us around the fireplace in the living room. He told us that he has to leave for a while, that he got promoted in work and would have to travel a lot. I think Ivan was around twenty two at that time, I was only thirteen. He believed that Ivan was old enough to look after me while he wasn’t home.

At that point it was so bad with my mom that we couldn’t take care of her at home anymore, so we had to put her in a care center. Ivan had to quickly grow up to handle everything around the house. I never held it against my dad, watching your wife slowly dying in front of your eyes for years must have taken a toll on him. I don’t blame him for leaving, he did what he thought was the best for us” She stopped for a moment.

“I feel bad for him, for you. You two had to go through some bad shit” I put the burnt cigarette butt in the ashtray and reach for another.

“Pass me one, will you?”

“But you don’t smoke”

“Come on, not like I’d get cancer from just one, right?” she sighs.

“Come on, give me” I hand her one.

“And light?” I gesture towards the ashtray.

“I never figured out why you like this thing so much”

“At this point, it’s just addiction” She passes me the lighter.

“What has that to do with how you reacted at the restaurant”

“Well ever since mom got sick he was… different, something about him changed”  

“If you don’t want to talk about it, you don’t have to”

“No, no I do, it’s just… he loved me in ways a brother shouldn’t”

“Like the thing he did at The Usual Place? I got really creeped out by that to be honest. The way he played with your hair, the look he gave you ugh” I feel my stomach turn.

“Yeah, like that…”

“But he didn’t…”

“I think he wanted to, do… that… something just always stopped him right before he did” She flicks the ash into the tray.

“Maybe I made him too uncomfortable, I put up a wall against him. But he is a man, and a lot older than me so there wasn’t much I could do”

“If I knew earlier, he would still be spitting teeth by now” I cringe at what I said.

“No, please don’t make him angry, I don’t know what he’s capable of anymore”

“Why is he so angry at me?”

“He wants me for himself”

“Why didn’t you say anything?” I notice the beer on the table; I take a long sip and put it down again.

“I was a just stupid fucking kid Milan. I know I should have known better, but you must understand how hard it was, how scared I was”

“Fuck I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…” Our neighbor shouts in excitement as a goal is scored.

“Forget it” She throws the cigarette butt over the balcony.

“You tried to get away from him?”

“Yes, but it took time, I had to get older first”

“That’s why you studied in Prague?”

“Partially, I wanted to be a nurse. I thought that with a degree I could take mom back home. To take care of her…”

“So, what do we do, just, hope we don’t run into him again?”

“He needs our help Milan”

“How do you help a man like him?” She grew angry at this, and rightfully so.

“I don’t fucking know” She stands up and leans over the railing “I thought if I studied nursing, I’d be able to help mom in the long term and somehow fix him as well. But seeing mom like that…” I notice a sparkle flowing down her cheek “I can’t even fucking look at her without wanting to cry, she doesn’t even recognize me anymore. Her own daughter”

I notice she is on the verge of collapsing into a flood of tears, I stand beside her, supporting her body with my hand. I allow her head to rest on my shoulder. The moon hid its face behind a cloudy veil. I imagine the sadness deep inside of her and tear up as well. We stood there for what seemed to be an hour. The lights of an ambulance illuminate the distant road. I think about work, that I might see that person tomorrow. I know, I’m a horrible person, but I would do anything for Nikole.

“We can look for Ivan… help him find his footing again, set him on a right track” I suggest quietly.

“I don’t think he’ll listen, he’s too dam stubborn for that”

“Don’t worry, he’ll listen, he has to” I kiss her neck.

“We’ll can give it a shot”

“And, if you want, we can bring Molly here. I’ll arrange my shifts so she’s not alone, we can take care of her. Maybe she’ll get better here, with us”

“I would love that. But it doesn't work like that, you know it doesn't”

“I… I do”

“It’ll only get worse; we can’t do anything about it. We can only make her feel a little better”

“I should stop by her sometime, sorry I haven’t been there for a while”

“We’ll go together sometime, first we have to take care of ourselves”

“You helped me a lot” The bell of the distant church tolls twice.

“Damn, time does really fly doesn’t it?”

“We can sleep in tomorrow if you want, I bet you are tired too. I have a night shift tomorrow, so it doesn’t matter when we wake up. We’ll order pizza for lunch, okay?” I held the balcony door open for her.

“Sounds good”

We went straight into the bedroom. The bed looks very good; it fits nicely with the aesthetic of the room. The thick, grey wooden legs contrast nicely with other furniture. Identifying my side of the bed is easy enough, hers is cluttered with pillows of all shapes and sizes. The room is faintly illuminated by a new, pink backlight. It created a cozy atmosphere.

When she lay beside me, her back against my chest, I snuggled up to her and ran my hands down her velvet soft body. Her hair smells of strawberries. I kiss her on the neck and wish her sweet dreams. We adjust and find a more comfortable position for sleeping. After a moment of cuddling, she turns around. Her pretty eyes reflect the pink light, and it gives her an even prettier look.

Looking deep into my soul, she kisses me. Grabbing my head from the back, I can’t take my eyes away from her. Goosebumps form involuntarily all over my body. I put my leg between hers, pull her closer to me; she feels my warmth grow and sighs with excitement. My breath ramps up with each kiss. I turn her over to her back, now over her I stop myself.

“We don’t have to… if you don’t want to” I don’t want to make her uncomfortable after what we were just talking about.

“Shut the fuck up” She pulls me by my chin, kisses me and raises her thigh to feel me. Her hand sliding over the scars on mine. A reminder of her dares.  

“I love you”

She rolls her eyes “Obviously”

I hate her so much. Gently moving to down towards her warmth, I leave a trace of kisses, only a thin piece of clothing divides us now. She moans with excitement as my lips make contact. The sound she makes sends shivers down my spine. Her hand burrowed in my hair. Every fiber of me screamed to go at it right now, somehow, I resisted. I admit I got lost at this moment, and after an unknown amount of time I finally looked at her face again. She looked uncomfortable. Her hand reaching for something on her back.

“What’s wrong, I’ll stop” I said, panicking at the thought of making her feel bad.

“No, please don’t, it’s just, I have a strange pain in my back, I’ve noticed it in the shower. It’s been slowly getting worse, maybe I stretched my back when I tripped”

“So, you want to be on top?” She gently slaps me, which sends a surprising amount of hormones into my bloodstream. I didn’t know she had this side, for that, I didn't know I did either.

“I take it as yes” I said with a face I’ve never made before.

“I’ve told you to shut up” she says as she takes control of the situation.

“Jesus when did you get so strong?” She puts the piece of clothing that has divided just moments before in my mouth and I finally, mostly shut up.

My head slams into the window as the car takes a sharp turn waking me up. It’s so dark outside I can’t see fifty meters out. The only thing that is in my view is the trees dimly illuminated by the weak headlights; we are moving so quickly that they turn into long blurs. It sounds like a hurricane is raging outside, the car is going so fast I can feel it vibrate under the stress. The spot on the window where I bashed my head is stained by blood.

I look to my left to see who is behind the wheel. A ragged man with long and seemingly unkept beard and a crazed, angry look on his face stares intently at the road. When my eyes finally focus on his desolate form, I notice that he is covered in bugs of no earthly sort. They have many legs and crawl in and out of every possible orifice his body has to offer. Smoke rises from their smoldering bodies as they leave countless scorch marks on his body.

He doesn’t seem to be bothered by them at all. I attempted to speak but my mouth is unable to open. It feels like it has been sown shut. He probably couldn’t hear what I had to say to him anyway over the rumble of the air from outside. He steers the car closer to the side of the empty road and a branch of a tree knocks off the side mirror, startling me.

I try to move my body, but the driver pushes even harder on the gas pedal, the force of acceleration pulls me even deeper into the seat. It feels like I’m suffocating, unable to draw proper breaths. I’m starting to panic and so I decide to pull on the handbrake as hard as I possibly can. He didn’t pay attention to me until this point, so I think he won’t even notice. It takes every ounce of my strength just to reach it. 

Just as I was about to start pulling the car swivels out of control for a brief second, my eyes zip across to the road as a blur resembling a deer disappears into the dark forest. The sharp maneuver sends me back into my seat. I notice the driver is now staring at me angrily. The smoldering bugs from his body now made aware of my presence, start swarming me. They take flight with their terrible wings and clumsily land on my hands and neck, feels like a stack of white-hot nails has been thrown at me.

The driver mumbles something under his nose in anger, his teeth clenched and grinding on each other making a disgusting creaking noise. I hear the steering wheel crumble under the pressure of his grip; his knuckles turn white from the strength he puts into his fists. He says something which I cannot recognize and just as he goes silent, the bugs begin biting me. Their needle-like legs pull on my hair and skin like freshly forged fishing hooks. I feel one of them bravely entering the uncharted territory of my inner ear.

Unable to fight back from the shear force pushing me into the seat I feel like I’m about to faint at that moment. My eyes now forced open by the hellish insects I watch as a pair of greenish glowing eyes appears in the distance. We close the gap to it in an impossibly short time. The forest now blending in a homogenous blur. The car moves out of the way at the last second. Tires screeching in pain, desperate to hold to the tarmac they slip and send the car into uncontrollable spin. My body is thrown against the driver; he quickly grabs onto me and whispers in my ear.

“She will be taken away from you”

For a split second, I see a tree illuminated by the headlights less than a meter from the car.
