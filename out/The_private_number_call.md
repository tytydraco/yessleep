I am a totally normal guy with completely normal medical history without any signs of odd mental health issues. But this morning I just woke up to an unescapable, undeniable feeling of dread that existed without any stimulation from reality aside from complete darkness. The night before tonight was a normal regular night. I was excited for my upcoming interviews as I just recently completed my nursing lisencing exam and their qualifications. But then, there was a phone call that day which was private. It did not bother me at first but it felt strange. I had, never ever, in my existence, ever, recieved one before. Then I started researching why it happened and if it was normal. It was my very average anxiety attack essentially. A part of me thought it might be an interviewer that I skipped out at but it turns out to be much much worse. 

At a certain point, I decided to leave it alone and continue with my work then gaming with friends that night. This went on until 2 AM which then I fell asleep quite quickly. This is where the creepy shit starts to happen. Normally my dreams make some sort of sense but tonight it felt like it was controlled by someone or something. Let me explain. My dream started off normal. I dreamt I was an graduate student studying marine biology and was about to embark on a submarine that would descend deep sea. However, it was testing new equipment which would push deep sea diving further than we imagine. So I descended with the whole crew until a certain point and I was nominated to enter "the room". "The room" was a specialized and protected compartment that would isolate me and put me in visualization with the surrounding marine life. Essentially I would see all of my surroundings using specialized light beams. But something went wrong. The submarine had started breaking and was descending at a speed that was too fast. All I could hear is the captain saying its going to be alright and the rest of the crew working with smiles on their faces while we descended into hell. My compartment has better insulation so I could see them slowly freeze before my eyes. It disturbed the hell out of me so I decided to close my eyes. 

Which brought me to my second dream. This second dream was quick and swift, filled with happy memories like a weird mix of batman, my university life, an anthropology class and random friends that acted like "mean girls". Felt like a sitcom. But for some reason, they started to disappear as though someone was killing them off. You know the feeling of comfort when you watch a sitcom but then people start leaving or get killed off? This was the feeling. For me, it was similar to watching Micheal Scott leave the office. No more comfort. This person in control of my dreams was intentionally destroying my escape from the deep sea nightmare. Usually the happy parts is where I wake up from in the morning but this was not the case. 

Essentially what happened next was the person dragged me back into the first dream where I woke up in the submarine randomly on land. I had talked to the villagers and they said everyone else in the submarine had all disappeared. The reason I escaped was because the compartment pulled off and rose to the surface before I experienced death. But then the dream got weird. I began to see pokemon in hallucinations as though they were alive. None of this felt real and I wasn't sure why. Then I started getting cold all of a sudden. And colder. Then I started freezing. I blinked my eyes and I was in submarine again. But this time, I had no escape. It was as though someone had control of my dreams and was dragging me back into the deep sea dream. 

So me being logical, I didn't believe it and I woke up. At first, it felt normal as my senses were gathering. But I couldn't move, I felt paralyzed. I turned to my left and there was a chair imagined as shadow. It was weird. I couldnt control my body temperature and I started feeling colder and colder. I had to break out of the paralysis so I started screaming until I felt I had some touch with reality temporarily. My temperature and body started regulating but my mind was slowly losing sense of reality and going through some psychosis episode. I know because Ive seen this in dementia patients Ive worked with prior. I tried my hardest but every shadow around my room felt like someone or something was watching me and controlling me. Ive never felt this feeling in my life before. Even my thoughts started to get unnatural while I was imagining things everywhere. I had to use the bathroom to pee but I would walk downstairs with this uneasy feeling that something was controlling me. After I came back upstairs, I immediately started hallucinating all the worse things like death and murder for a split second but I pushed myself to look through my phone as a distraction. It helped me but I needed someone to snap me out of this psychosis and put me back into reality. As I sit here slowly writing this post, I wonder to myself if I will ever get another dream that makes me this paranoid. Some part of me thought it was triggered by the unknown of the private number. Its like it could be anything. I could be an interviewer or a scam call or a call with someone who had just wanted to mess with my dreams.
