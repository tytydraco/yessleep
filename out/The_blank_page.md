As I sit here, staring at the blank page in front of me, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched. It's as if something, or someone, is lurking just beyond my perception, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself. I've tried to brush it off as just my imagination, but the more I try to ignore it, the more intense the feeling becomes.

I've always been a bit of a night owl, so it's not uncommon for me to be up late working on a project. But tonight, the silence feels oppressive, as if it's trying to suffocate me. I turn on some music to drown out the silence, but even that doesn't seem to help. The sense of unease only grows stronger with each passing minute.

I decide to take a break and make some tea to calm my nerves. As I wait for the water to boil, I can't shake the feeling that I'm not alone in the room. I turn around, expecting to see one of my cats, but the room is empty. I try to laugh it off, telling myself that I'm just being paranoid.

But as I sit down at my desk to resume my work, I see something out of the corner of my eye. It's just a fleeting glimpse, but it's enough to send a shiver down my spine. I quickly turn my head, but there's nothing there. I try to tell myself that it was just a trick of the light, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched.

I decide to take a walk to clear my head. As I make my way through the quiet streets, the sense of unease only grows stronger. It's as if the darkness is closing in around me, suffocating me. I can't shake the feeling that something, or someone, is following me.

I quicken my pace, trying to outrun my fears, but it's no use. The presence is always one step behind me, just out of sight. I start to run, not caring where I'm going, just wanting to get as far away from whatever is chasing me.

I don't know how long I run for, but eventually I collapse to the ground, panting and gasping for air. As I lay there, trying to catch my breath, I hear a voice whisper my name. It's a voice that I recognize, but it's one that I haven't heard in years.

I slowly turn around, expecting to see a ghostly apparition, but instead I see a figure standing in the darkness. It's a woman, her face twisted into a grotesque mask of hatred.

"You shouldn't have left me," she hisses, her voice filled with venom.

I try to run, but my legs won't move. I'm paralyzed with fear as the woman steps closer, her hands outstretched as if to strangle me.

"It's time to pay for what you've done," she says, her voice dripping with malice.

I try to plead with her, to explain that I had no choice, but the words die in my throat. I'm at her mercy, and I know that she won't show me any kindness.

As she wraps her hands around my throat, I close my eyes and wait for the end. But it never comes. When I open my eyes, the woman is gone, and I'm left alone in the darkness.

I don't know what to make of the encounter. Was it just a nightmare brought on by my overactive imagination? Or was it something more sinister, a warning from the beyond?

I may never know.
