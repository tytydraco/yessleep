 I'm completely freaked out, I'm writing this so there is something people close to me can search for if anything happens, he is after me… How did this nightmare start? I guess I'll have to explain since I'll be posting this. I will try not to give too much details about my life, I'll try to keep it vague enough so that the ones close to me can know who I am.

I think it started happening around the early days of may, he started staring at me, trying to get to me somehow, even stalking me, I remember the first time I noticed his gaze. It was late, me and a couple of friends were going home after a movie night at Sarah’s place, we all lived pretty close not further than a couple streets in a peaceful neighborhood outside town. For the contest I live in a small town surrounded by forests and mountains. It was getting dark and the street lights barely lit up our surroundings, then i felt something was wrong

“ Hey, Audrey! Are you even listening?” Said Emma, i guess she noticed how I looked a bit nervous

“Sorry Ems, I must have zoned out for a second” I said as calmly as i could, Emma chuckled a bit and carried on talking but i couldn't fully concentrate, i couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched and or followed, i kept looking around the entire time as discreetly as i cloud.

Then I was him, he looked like a man but something felt off, he was far away from us staring at us i couldn't help but try to warn my friends, they just said they couldn't see anything that i was probably paranoid and that we were really close to home so if he really was there at least i would be with my parents, i just hoped he would go away and that my parents would be home, although they usually work all day if i'm lucky they are home by 9 o'clock.

We finally reached our hoses so i waved goodbye and entered to my home as quickly as i could looking the door behind me, i thought i would be safe in there but to my horror i was home at 10pm witch was unusual so i tried to call them but one one answered so all i could do was hope he couldn't know where i live that he would have gotten bored and not have followed me home, that was so stupid considering that he could have easily seen me and the others enter our hoses. Few minutes passed by and I was already calmer. It was Friday after all, then suddenly I started feeling anxious again. I heard loud noises from the window of my bedroom.

I have to say I didn't want to go there at all but they were starting to get louder. The thought of calling the cops crossed my mind even though the nearest police station is a lot of kilometers/miles away from here, so I went to check it out, phone in hand. I don't know that i expected, he was there staring, the same man really close so much so that i could see his sketchy facial expressions, next thing i know i drop my phone from shock and notice his oddly shaped teeth, he was smiling so creepily, his eyes were literally empty voids and then he spoke

“Let me in Audrey” he screamed while banging the window with his fist so hard i thought it would break into pieces, worst of all he somehow knew my name, i was freaking out “Fuck off or I’m colling the cops!” I screamed as loud as i could, next thing i did was close all blinds and double checking that all doors and windows were looked properly. I don't know what he is but ever since then he tries to get to me, day by day starting getting closer to the point that some of my friends started to notice him too, asking about it they just think he is a weirdo, a stalker at worst. My parents don't believe me though, i’ve tried to tell them about him yet they don't believe me they say i'm too old to be whining about imaginary monsters. I'm 16 so why would I even lie about something like that? It is not like I'm telling them all details either.

I think I'm going crazy. He's even started mimicking some people's voices, most of the time strangers, sounding like an old man, a kid, an annoying neighbor, other times people I know, my father, my cousins, heck even my friends and my own voice. He always tries to go near me when I'm alone, he knows that i'm home alone most of the time, always trying to make me invite him in, he wasn't done anything too damaging just yet but know he wants to hurt me, don't know why I don't even know if he is even rational. A few things are pretty clear: he isn't human and he clearly has enough force to break in but he doesn't do so, almost like he needs to be invited in. Maybe I’ll share some stories of my experiences later on. 

I feel like I'm in danger all the time. I'm growing paranoid that he must be nearby. Every time he or it grows more and more aggressive, stronger, faster, I don't know if I'm going to make it next time. Will there even be a next time? I think that at the very least I need to know a few things about the humanoid creature. Does anyone know what this human looking thing is? Has anyone encountered anything like “him”? Is there any way to be safe? Can I get rid of this thing? Now that I think about it, is it even safe to talk about it? Maybe there is a possibility to trigger it or something, I hope not though, i can barely deal with it lately.

Oh shit! He's back at it… Shit.
