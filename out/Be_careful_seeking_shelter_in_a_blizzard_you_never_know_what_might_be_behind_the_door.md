A quick respite from the brutal cold was all I wanted, so the sight of the small building was enough to fill me with hope. A concrete gray slab in the distance broke through the monotony of uninterrupted, sprawling fields of white. 

It feels like I’ve been wandering for hours, but I know I wouldn’t have lasted that long. I quicken my pace, squinting desperately for any sign of life. I mentally rehearse the speech I’ll give them, half afraid my mind will be frozen over by the time I get there.

The building nears right as I feel my legs start to give.

I muster the last of my strength to trudge through the thick snow separating us. 

Light pools out from the structure ahead. I attempt to look for any identifying sign for the building but my view is too obstructed from the snow.  

My knees buckle as I lurch into the door, leaning against it for support. I hammer my first onto the thick metal.

“Please, is anyone in there?” The icy wind gets caught in my throat, my shout coming out strained. “Please help me, my car broke down and my phone’s not working. I have no idea where I am.” My hand impatiently reaches to try the handle. To my luck, it turns. 

Warmth instantly hits me as I swing it open, immediate relief tingling all over my body. I peel my hands out of my soaken mittens and bring them up to my mouth, blowing all of the air left in my lungs to warm them. 

A quick glance around the room reveals the place to be a lobby of sorts. Brochures are lined neatly in little stands off to the side of a large wooden desk, a faint pine scent wafts through the air. There’s a lit fireplace in the corner. I take a few steps toward it and my attention is turned to a bin in the corner labeled “Lost and Found.” *God, I hope someone forgot their blanket.* 

I begin walking over to it while scanning the rest of the area. There’s no sign of anyone despite the fire.

I dive my hands into the basket, pulling out a bundle of entangled fur-lined jackets. I hastily separate them and hear something clatter to the ground. 

A flip phone lays at my feet. Grabbing it, I stare at the object for a moment, dumbfounded. *Why would this be here?* 

I flip it open. A single bar of signal dips in and out at the top of the screen. Please, please work. The flimsy keyboard clacks as I pound three digits into it. My breath hitches in my throat as it begins ringing.   
  
A second passes. Dial tone. *Fuck*.

I slam it onto the counter in annoyance. Sweeping up the bundle of thick jackets, I make my way over to the fire. 

I peel off my soaken coat, tossing it and my own phone in front of the flames to dry. *Hopefully the owners won’t mind that I’m here. Maybe I should go introduce myself.* 

The heat melts away my worries for a moment. Leaning forward, I close my eyes and let the warmth soothe my chilled bones. 

I feel myself begin to drift off, the comforting air lulling me to sleep. 

*Thump*. My eyes shoot open, darting to find the source of the soft sound. A door sits ajar past the reception desk. *Thump*.

“Hello?” I stare at the visible crack in the door for any sign of life inside. “Is anyone there?” My voice blares over the soft crackling of the fireplace. *Thump*.

I glance towards the front door as I make my way over. A blanket of white encompasses the plane, blocking all light from entering into the small room. The other windows are similarly blocked, piles of thick snow sealing the building in. *Guess I’ll have to make myself comfortable here.* 

An uneasy feeling washes over me. I slowly push myself off the floor, patting my pocket to feel for my knife. I inch closer, feeling more and more unsure with each step. 

The building feels like it's going to collapse inwards on top of me, suddenly feeling much smaller than before. *Has it always been so cramped*? Rough hail threatens to break the windows, pelting the building with sheets of snow. 

A faint sound emits from the dark, so light that I have to strain myself to hear it. An inconsistent stream of liquid drips to the floor like a leaking faucet. 

I stare into the inky blackness seeping through the crack, straining my eyes in an attempt to see anything. My hand pauses around the door knob, my focus stolen by a faint sound coming from the depths of the room in front of me. It sounds as though something slick and heavy is being dragged across the floor, a sickeningly wet sound of smearing across the tile. 

My legs move involuntarily, stammering backwards. Part of me wants to call out, plead for help, yet something instinctual tells me to hold my breath. The sound grows increasingly fainter as it sinks further into the room.

A sudden high-pitched creaking pierces through the silence, followed by a soft click as a door shuts. I take it as a sign to allow myself to breathe. Setting my hand flush against the door, I hesitate for a moment and reconsider what I’m about to do. 

Light trickles into the room as I begin to push it open, revealing a scene to me in glimpses. This area seems to be an extension of the lobby, much larger than the room I had entered from. Small tables that held local craft goods are now toppled to the ground. Shards of glass shimmer in the darkness, a glittery highlight atop dark red smears across the floorboards. *The footprints make it look like someone was pacing.*

My body screams at me to leave, to hide, to try and claw my way out through the wall of snow blocking me in. 

The dripping continues a little louder than before. My attention is directed far off to my right, landing on an ajar door spewing out a tauntingly golden beam of light. A pool of red sits between the entryway. A large sign labeled “Bathroom” sits above it. 

Seeing no other option, I begin to creep over as quietly as possible. My steps are slow and steady as I make my best attempt to cling to the wall. Glass crunches softly under my feet. 

I cling to the door frame and brace myself to peer around, immediately recoiling once I do. Smears of dark red decorate the floor, preserved shoe prints dancing in circles around the small space. The off-white walls are painted a sticky maroon, drops and specks decorating any untouched surface. 

Despite the amount of blood, absolutely no sign of a body or anything that would indicate what happened here remains.

My feet move faster than my mind can react, turning in a desperate attempt to flee and run anywhere but here, but I then begin to feel myself gliding on the slick floors and my legs tangle. My shoulder smashes into the sink basin on my descent, red hot pain searing through the bone. In an instant I’m on the floor, scrambling to my soaked knees and watching as my covered hands paint the ground I crawl upon. 

I drag myself towards the door, shooting pains ricocheting throughout my body with each movement. I stare out the gap and strain my eyes to see if whatever had been out there has come for me yet.

Summoning the last of my strength, I launch myself from the ground, my shoes sliding wetly across the floor. My adrenaline-fueled heart jolts in my chest as I hear the door slam open to my right, bare feet smacking rapidly across the tile, like it was waiting there for the moment to strike. 

The pounding reaches just behind me as my hands flail desperately for the exit, rapid animalistic breaths growing louder and louder until the frantic gasps brush against my neck. My hand grasps the handle as I practically throw myself into the room, swinging the door shut and slamming into it with the entirety of my body weight. 

The world crashes to a silent standstill. I remain flush against the door, filling my strained lungs with as many ragged breaths as I can manage to choke down. 

No resistance meets me on the other side. I try to gather the willpower to move, to crawl further away, to be anywhere but pressed up against this door yet I remain rooted in place.

I practice in my mind over and over the series of actions to grab the cabinet to my right, shoving it in my place and building a barricade of sorts, yet a million what-ifs course through my mind. *What if it’s still there? What if it’s just waiting for me to move again? I can’t just keep waiting here.*

One more moment passes before I project myself off the door, grabbing the dresser with practiced movements and flinging it where I had been. My body moves faster than my mind can process my actions as I stack more and more objects against the door. I lurch gracelessly in pain and strain against the weight of a tall bookshelf as I drag it closer and closer, paper cascading like an avalanche to the floor. 

My back begins to give as I finally rest it in front of my makeshift barricade. I recoil the moment I let go, walking backwards, trying to put any distance between myself and the door while my chest heaves. 

The phone rang out suddenly with a piercing cry, filling the room with high pitched ringing.

I whip around and stare at the object blaring on the floor. A rush of relief flushes over me as the ringtone continues to play out. I take one more cautionary look at the door before sprinting over and scooping up the object. Fumbling with it in my hand, I clumsily flip it open and jam the green button.

“Hello? Please, do you hear me?” I sob into the phone. “Please help me, please, I don’t know where-”

“*Hello? Please, do you hear me?*” My own voice plays back through the receiver. The phone nearly slips through my fingers, my heart plunging to my stomach. The rest of my plea begins repeating back to me interspersed with rapid, shallow breaths. 

Without thinking I throw the phone across the room and run opposite of the door, shrinking against the wall and finding myself on the floor. My breathing runs rampant, uncontrollable, my lungs struggling to keep up as I hyperventilate. The soft sounds coming from the phone seem to mimic my own. 

My head whips around the room, searching for any possible escape or solution, yet I find nothing. It’s either go face that thing or struggle with the mountains of snow blocking the entrance, which would not be possible with my shoulder in such bad shape. I crawl over to the safety of the fireplace, curling into a ball and resigning myself to accept what may be my end. I bundle one of the jackets into a pillow and try my best to ignore the deep, ragged breaths coming from the other side of the room.

*Bang, bang, bang*. My eyes shoot open and I instinctively shoot upright, backing myself further into the corner. *Bang, bang*. 

“Hello? Anyone in there?” A gruff voice calls through the front door. I propel myself off the ground and run as fast as I can. “I saw that the lights were on and-” 

I cut him off, swinging the front door open and collapsing into his arms. My body convulses uncontrollably, heavy sobs flowing out of my throat. He hesitates before lightly putting his arms around me, leading me out and shutting the door. I close my eyes and shrink against him, reduced to being inconsolable. 

He lets go for a moment and begins reaching towards the door. An inhuman wail leaves my body and I pull him backwards with what little strength remains inside of me. He acts like he’s going to protest, but then he turns and looks at me and the thought seems to die in his throat. 

Everything that happened next was a complete blur. 

We step out and he leads me to his cabin. I explain everything to him through labored breaths as we walk, him listening and nodding sympathetically. He tells me that he’s a neighbor and had noticed he hadn’t seen the woman that owns the shop leave before the storm hit. He had also noticed the lights on and her car still in the driveway. 

My sobs become more ragged and I collapse a bit inward, leaning on him for support, and tell him of the blood I saw in the bathroom and the state of disarray the shop had been in. He stills for a moment. He asks if I saw her or anyone else in the building but my throat has closed completely, incapable of getting any sound out. He nods solemnly. 

At his cabin, he allows me to use his landline to get in contact with a tow truck while he calls the police on his cellphone. The man seems welcoming, allowing me to stay and recover in his guest room. The rest of the night went by in a blur between giving my statement and trying to locate where I had abandoned my truck. 

It’s been about a month since the incident now, and I still really don’t have answers for anything that had happened during the blizzard. To my knowledge they never found the woman that lived there, and when police had searched the building it had been completely empty – just the devastated, blood splattered remains of the store lingered.

I’m still working on processing everything, none of it feels real to me yet. I've found myself doubting my memory of it frequently and just repeating the events that happened in my head over and over. Sometimes I wonder if I imagined it all, but the occasional ache in my shoulder casts those doubts away.

I’ve been doing my best to avoid the area but have been slowly building more confidence driving there when I have to, yet I still don’t know if I’ll ever feel comfortable leaving home when it’s snowing ever again.
