A few months ago, I’ve probably lost my two best friends. I wrote about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13rlq8y/something_has_erased_him_from_our_memories/), but if you are reading this, you possibly don’t remember that anyway. Don’t worry, I’ll explain everything.I created a cloud document to write this journal and programmed a bot, so if I don’t open the file for a week, the bot will automatically post this online, so you’ll know what happened.

If you don’t remember me or my last post, long story short: the three of us had stumbled upon a cave. One of us (I don’t remember his name), entered the cave, and vanished, along with any memories associated with him. We don’t remember him at all, nobody does. After that, I revisited the same cave with my other friend, Scott (I only know his name because of my journal). Scott went inside, and suffered the same fate.

I tried to make sense of the events since it happened. I’m alone, and I have no idea what to do, my friends are gone, and nobody remembers they ever existed.

I can’t tell this story to anyone, they would think I’m crazy. But I have to find out what’s inside that cave. Somebody must know. There must be someone who tried to explore it before, we just… we just can’t remember them…

I decided to ask a neighbor, Peter. He was 78, I hoped he could give me some useful information. I asked him about the cave, and he said nobody ever went there in recent times, but he worked as a journalist in his twenties. He talked about working on an article based on a cult, that had a secret hiding place at the cave. Unfortunately, he didn’t remember much anymore, but he told me which year’s newspaper I had to check to find the article.

After that, I went to our library’s archives and quickly found the newspaper with Peter’s article. He wrote about occultists originating from the Middle Ages, or even before that. They used the cave as a place to make sacrifices to someone they called the Supreme God.

The military planned a raid in 1930 because even they considered the cult dangerous, but nothing came out of it. The article also mentioned someone called Simeon Ryder. “The last time anyone visited that cave was decades ago, but Simeon decided to explore it in the following week. I’ll keep everyone updated on how his mission went,” wrote Peter.

Strange, he never mentioned Simeon before. I checked the following week’s newspaper, and there was no mention of him either. Maybe Simeon suffered the same fate as Scott and my other friend. I was thinking about going back to Peter to ask him about Simeon, but I decided it would’ve been pointless, if Simeon is also deleted from people’s memories, Peter won’t remember him.

I spent the next few days searching for information about this cult. They were called the Sons of the Supreme God, and were active mostly in Europe, but some of them came here with the colonists, then settled here, in Harwich, and used it as a base of operations in the US.

Some sources say the reason they chose Harwich is because there was an entity living in that cave, called the Servant of the Supreme God. They believed it was a cosmic entity coming to Earth millions of years ago.

I would say this whole thing is bullshit, but after losing multiple people at this cave, I don’t know, there’s a chance it may be true.

I’ve also found a report about the military raid. The papers said they would be deployed in March of 1930, but there’s no information if the raid actually happened or not.

Okay, a few days have gone by since I last updated this journal. Right now, I’m at the entrance of this cave. It’s around midnight. I had a sudden urge an hour ago to visit the cave, I don’t know why. It’s fucking cold, but anyway, if I’m here, I’m going in. If I die, it doesn’t matter, this post will get posted automatically. But I must know what happened to my friends.

UPDATE: I’m inside that cave. I don’t know if there’s internet down there, so I have no idea if I can save this or not. The cave is full of unknown symbols, probably occultist. There are no pentagrams, but a lot of signs remind me of it. I also found a few old skeletons. Some look like they’ve been here for hundreds of years, but some seem quite… recent.

UPDATE 2: Okay, I’m shaking right now, but I think I’m safe enough right now to write down what happened in the last half an hour. As I walked deeper and deeper into the cave, I found dozens of corpses. There were about ten skeletons in old US Army uniforms. They could’ve been the soldiers who came here in 1930.

But the most terrifying thing I saw was a living human being. He appeared out of nowhere, and I almost shat myself. He looked the same age as me.

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Me?” he responded with a shaking voice. “I’m nobody. I… don’t… exist.”

“Yes, you exist, for fuck’s sake. You’re here.”

“So… do you… see me?”

“Yes, I see you.”

“No, no, it can’t be,” the guy started screaming. “I don’t exist, I never existed. I will die in a few days, anyway…”

“How can you die if you don’t exist?” I asked. The guy looked familiar…

“I… I…” he paused for a few seconds, thinking. “I don’t know.”

I suddenly heard a deep, long sound coming from even deeper. It sounded… I can’t even describe it. It was something I never heard before.

“It was the servant,” he exclaimed.

“What servant? The…” I remembered the research I’d done. The Servant of the Supreme God. A cosmic entity coming to Earth millions of years ago…

“Doesn’t matter. I don’t exist anyway, I…”

“Scott!” I said. “You’re Scott. I remember now. We came here together, remember?”

“Scott,” he repeated. “Scott, Scott… My name is Scott, my name is Scott, NO, I DON’T EXIST!”

He started shaking, then collapsed to the ground. I tried to catch him, but then… I don’t know what happened. I suddenly got here. I’m at this empty place. There’s nothing, absolutely nothing here. I think there’s not even a ground I can stand on. I’m just floating in darkness, there’s nothing here. I just hear those deep sounds.

But… but I exist. I don’t think I’m dead. So that means, I’m probably erased from people’s memories, but I’m still alive. So there must be a way out. I don’t know if this journal will update or not, since there’s barely any signal down here, but if you can read this, please, you have to help me. I still exist, I just don’t know where. But I feel the Servant coming [closer and closer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)
