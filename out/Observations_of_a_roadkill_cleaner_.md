I’ve been cleaning roadkill for about ten years now, and I can honestly say it’s a job I enjoy. It’s one of those things you get used to, you know? You’re out on the road, you do your work, you move on. Nothing fancy, but it’s satisfying in a strange way. I’ve worked all over the country—different states, different highways. It’s always the same, but always a little different, too. People think it’s a pretty straightforward gig, and for the most part, it is. But every now and then, you come across something that makes you stop and take a second look.

Take the staged roadkill, for example. I’ve seen it enough that I know what it looks like. These are the animals that seem out of place for some reason. Usually, it’s deer—though it could be other things, too. But what’s odd is that they’re always missing their left antler. It’s not like they were hit by a car and lost it in the collision. It’s just gone. And sometimes, the animal looks like it’s been set up—arranged in a certain way, wounds clean like they were intentionally made that way. Then there are the ones with stitches in them. I’ve found that more than once. Like someone decided to patch the animal up and drop it by the side of the road. It’s not something you see every day, but I’ve seen it enough to know it’s not just a one-off.

Then there are the pelts. You wouldn’t think you’d find just a pelt, but I’ve seen it. Fur, perfectly skinned, laid out neatly on the side of the road. There’s no body. No blood. Just the fur. Not sure how a car’s supposed to do that, but I’ve come across it more than a few times. Some of the pelts even have stitches in them, which is always a little strange. But like I said, this job comes with its own set of weird things, and that’s one of them.

The “sortadear” is another thing we joke about at work. Every time we get a call, it’s the same thing: “Some sort of deer.” It’s not always a deer, but it’s close enough that you can tell what they mean. But when you get there, you know right away—it’s not quite right. It might be the way it’s standing or the way it’s shaped, but something about it’s just off. Missing legs, fur that doesn’t look quite right. It’s enough for us to call it the sortadear. Nothing alarming, just a weird little pattern that’s popped up enough times that we’ve given it a name.

One thing that’s always a bit strange is the disappearing roadkill. It’s not like I’ve never seen a body vanish, but it happens. You’ll pull up to a spot, there’s a fresh carcass, blood, tire marks—it’s all there. But the moment you turn your back for a second, go grab your supplies, when you come back, it’s gone. The tire tracks and blood are still there, but no body. Not even a sign of it being moved. I’ve seen it enough times that I’m not surprised by it anymore. I just note it down and keep going. Happens more than you’d think, especially on certain stretches of highway. You learn which ones to watch out for.

And then there’s the hitchhikers. You meet a lot of them doing this kind of work. Most are just looking for a ride, maybe a story or two along the way. But some of them are a little too interested in the animals we clean up. They’ll stand there watching us, asking questions about the roadkill, the injuries, how we do our work. Some get in the way more than others, and I’ve had my fair share of them standing too close, watching too intently. It’s not that it bothers me, but it does stand out. Most people don’t care that much about the carcasses, but these ones seem to.

Anyway, it’s a job. It’s a job that gets repetitive, but there’s always something a little offbeat about it. I’ve seen a lot of weird things on these roads, but I don’t really think too much about it anymore. It’s just another part of the work, and at the end of the day, the road’s a little cleaner, and I can keep moving on to the next one.
