They say a donkey braying in these lands means the devil is nearby… I’ve heard of these dreadful stories of menace in evil-infested towns, the men no better than the masters they serve as they enslave and belittle their own kin. Ever since I was born these demons walked the earth, of various shapes and sizes they say, but I only ever saw one. He moved like a castle on two legs, fortified with armor, unrushed, filling the street with a sharp stench of ash and char as he passed. When they came, there was bloodshed as humans defended their homelands, the demons shaking with delight as they tore through the steel of man like a beaver through wood. They captured towns with quick pace, slaughtering armies and taking many Lord’s heads. However, what was surprising was their rule. They rarely come out of their captured castles, opting to stay in and almost never intruding in men’s lives. They need no sustenance and no pleasure as they lie in wait, as if anticipating something. So as the months passed, the slow stand-still of many town’s life renewed, men began sowing the fields, tending to livestock and bearing the winters and opting to speak less of the evil lurking within.

Meanwhile, I’m always looking for work, most of it menial that I find: help bury the slain, work the fields or in the mines, anything to eat well and see another day. That is how I found the town of Midshade, its warriors and guards long slain and folk continuing life as it were. It’s keep captured last winter by a demon and its party that no one has seen come forth since, what drives them to conquer but not rule? 

I’ve been working as an apprentice at a tannery, I assist in cleaning the flesh off the hides and soak it to cure it. Hides sell well as the winters in these lands can just as easily take a life as the fiends that inhabit it. The owner thinks little of me as he’s seen many travelers come and go. He’s a well built man, hardened by the labor of his profession, scars across the nape of his neck, forearms and lips. Odd for a tanner. He bent as he walked in doors and greeted by townsfolk with a craned back neck.

As I walked through the streets, the putrid smell of flesh and urine still on me, I caught a consistent pace in the shadows. My eyes set on well dressed and clean man, forcing himself on to a young girl. The girl released muffled yelps as he relieved himself on to her. She would not stop looking at me, soaked eyes pleading and begging to help. All my life I looked at the world as an observer, unvested in the happenings or its structure. But as I gazed into her sorrowful and engorged eyes it seemed her soul was screaming for me to take action. An overwhelming emotion overtook me for the first time in my life. I stepped onto the grand stage of life now as an actor, an active participant as I pushed him off her. In the shock of the moment or blackness of the night he tumbled into the filth ridden puddles of Midshade alleys. I noticed an immediate thickening of the air, a watchful eye somewhere took notice of this violence. Furiously the man attacked, arms outreached to gnaw my eyes but I evaded and landed a stiff strike to his temple, knocking him out cold. In this moment it’s as if my lungs paused, for fear of taking another breath could end me. I sensed great evil lurking but before I had the chance I was dragged away, bent at the waist to avoid escape. As I glimpsed back, her eyes which should have reflected gratitude for my opening act, instead showed horror for what she brought onto me.

I was thrown into a dark, mold infested cell with only a shimmer of moonlight peeking through. This was the end, what a meaningless life I’ve led, with no memory to hang on to to remember in my dying moments, no moments to cherish or to escape to. The blue hue of the moon turned yellow as I began hearing the faint sounds of the town waking. But no sooner than my eyes adjusted, a hellspawn took me and brought me to a large, unkept hall. It threw me a well crafted shield and spear. It wanted me to take it and prepare to fight. My opponent was a demon smaller than the one I remember. He wore shoulder plates, had slim but lanky arms with nails as lengthy as my fingers and sharper than the tip of my spear. Skin dark and scar-ridden, smelled of ash. 

He charged at me with the excitement of a mutt being called to dinner, happy to be in the moment and have the chance to split me in two. I raised my shield and stopped his claws in its tracks as I slipped away and thrust my spear in his stomach. He enjoyed that, he truly was savoring this moment. As we skirmished I sensed greater evil awakening and rumbling in the shadows of the dimly lit hall. An audience as it were, observed our match. My blade flashed with each swing, each strike more difficult to pull away as it penetrated his flesh. His nails screeched on the metal of my shield as I weaved away. Strangely, I felt no fear or panic. I adapted to his movements and weaved effortlessly, bewildered at my own skills. Unsure of how long after, but I dealt the finishing blow through his chest and knelt on top of him as he lay flat, both my hands clutching the mid of my spear. The demon, although his life fades, was satisfied with this chance to perform and gazed at me in such a way that I can’t describe - was this gratitude? Is this why they lie wait in these castles? Yearning for battle? 

As I placed my other hand on his chest to regain my footing, I felt an immense warmth fill my palm as if the sun itself channeled through it. What I saw next shook me to my core. In just a moment, rays overtook him protruding from every part of his body, followed by smoke from the gaping holes as if water kissed fire as he unraveled. The hall followed a brief silence, equally stunned before it roared with screeches and shouts of a thousand fiends coupled with the cacophony of stomping feet just overtaking the sound of my heart pumping through my ears in shock. The shuffling of armor so deafening as an army stood to attention and set their sights on me. What had I done? What happened to this demon? What will happen to me?
