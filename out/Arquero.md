“The Lord gives us Life in His image, but gives us Death in our own…”

The Père’s last words strike my heart in much the same way I did his. 

As I stare through his spyglass at the comet heading for me, the horror I experience is the knowledge that he is right.

At only 6 years of age, I let fly my first stone-tipped fleche from a makeshift bow and hit my pomme-de-terre target dead on from 10 meters away.

I knew what I was meant for before I even understood what it meant to shoot one’s shot.

The military had regular vacancies and the campaign was always afoot, so I found plenty of work as a young man.

The arrow of time makes a slow and unpredictable flight. My skill was noticed early on, but the forging of a reputation took over half a decade; the honing of my skill the whet of a hundred battles, a hundred orders from the General to nock, to draw, to ready, to loose.

My shooting was too skillful not to notice; I was called to live, and perform regularly, at court by our monarch himself.

And after all, taking orders from The King should be the same as taking orders from The General, should it not?

It wasn’t.

My military honor had desiccated into public entertainment. Targets were set up, tourneys were hosted, nobles and royalty sat under shaded tents while I shot apples off the heads of willing participants. My life revolved around the acquisition of mild applause.

I couldn’t brave the shame, and took to the bottle.

But the Pére saved me. 

He was a holy man, and a learned one. He knew The Scriptures by memory, understood modern mathematics, and was a historical encyclopedia of ancient civilizations (cultures who believed in many heathen gods instead of our one; my favorite was the god who carried The Earth on his back). 

He even doubled as the court’s astronomer; he had set out to study the Heavens so as to prove The Church’s geocentric model. 

He became an inspiration and confidant to me.

It was the Père who first saw the comet.

Bright white with a burning red tail that forked so as to make it look like an arrow mid-flight, heading directly towards our village.

The Père’s mistake was informing the public. 

The King overruled his proclamations, urging calm from the people, decrying the Père as a religious zealot, bent on causing chaos.

But the chaos grew as the comet in the sky itself did; it took only a week for it to become visible by the naked eye.

It was ever present, detectable by day but outright radiant at night.

It was the end of times, and we all knew it. People tried to flee, but the King was determined to maintain his grip on the population. His soldiers executed any “deserters”, explaining the comet as God’s wrath being sent to us for The Père’s unholy investigation into the Heavens.

In order to stop the comet, the Père must die.

My own life would have been forfeit if I did not aid them. 

The arrest occurred overnight, and no trial was held. Early in the morning, soldiers tied him to the post, and I was to deliver the killing shot in front of a fully assembled populace.

I did as I was ordered, as I always did. 

I asked for his final words, and the Père spoke that haunting phrase as though he was possessed by The Lord himself. After that he fell into a nearly inaudible mumbling. I took that as my cue.

One arrow to the chest was all it took to silence The Père’s whispering prayers. 

“The Lord gives us Life in His image, but gives us Death in our own…”

The Père studied the Heavens to prove the truth of God, and ended up dying because of it.

That did not sit right with me.

Especially since I believed him.

Other’s belief came with time. 

A few days passed, and the comet doubled in size, and it became obvious the blood-sacrifice did not work.

By the time it competed with the Sun for illumination, the whole village fled. Even the King understood; the castle itself became an abandoned and ransacked hovel. 

I alone remained behind.

I knew the comet was my justice for killing the Père, for abandoning my post in the field of battle in favor of a cushy court appointment. 

There was no point in running anyway; the arrows of misfortune are just, and always strike center-target.

I spent my days tracking the comet’s approach using the Père’s spyglass, which I had been sure to secure from looters.

And just as the comet began to eclipse the Moon in the Sky, I saw it, and the Père’s last words shot me directly in the pit of my heart. 

In the vast reach of the milky Heavens, floating in the sea of God’s creation, I saw Him: the star-laden silhouette of a man the size of 1000 Suns.

And just behind His head, I spotted his quiver.

The figure was in the position of upright release, his celestial left-hand wielding a bow-shaped constellation at the apogee of its follow-through.

I traced the path from the bow to the comet using a straight line.

The knotted and splitting surface of the comet became visible, signaling my approaching end.

“The Lord gives us Life in His image, but gives us Death in our own…”

I breathed in, closed my eyes, and thought back to The Père’s lessons on ancient civilizations.

My last thought was to wonder if instead of resting on God’s back, perhaps our world was an apple balancing upon His head.
