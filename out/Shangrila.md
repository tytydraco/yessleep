To start things out, I'm not a writer in any shape, way, or form. I had just turned 16 when I started this. I had a diary, like an actual one. My therapist told me to write down my feelings and log them in order to have "healthy coping mechanisms." I figured I'd try that before I get put on any medications. Anyway, most of the recollections will be logs from my diary, and I'll fill in the missing pieces if needed.

Part One
[08/25/24]  
It's been three days after my birthday. I got my dream car. I gotta save up and get a wheel cover, like, all decked out in rhinestones. Sonny says he'll put in new speakers, which I'm super excited about. And even if he doesn't (he'll probably forget), I can get Jeanette's boyfriend to. Me, Jeanette, Paisley, their boyfriends, and mine are all going to Bear Paw today, one of our hangout spots. Sonny doesn't ever like hanging out with my friends, says they're weird. But I finally convinced him to come this time. He picks me up around 11 and opens the truck door for me. He kisses me as he tells me good morning.

"Now listen, how long do we have to stay there?" he interrupts me as I return the greeting.

"I don't know yet. I'm thinking we're leaving a little bit in, then going to the springs," I reply.

He groans, then moves his hand to my thigh as he looks. "Do we have to go there right now, or are you up for a little detour?" he asks, meaning we stop to either make out or fuck. I figure it's best to give in to it, so he's in a better mood for the rest of the day.

Anyway, we finally meet up with the rest of the group. I ran and hugged Jeane and Paisley, trying to shake off the unease. Sonny awkwardly walked up behind me as I introduced him to Paisley. He muttered a “hi” as I introduced him to the boys. He’d quietly nod or grunt in an effort to act like he was invested in the conversations. I made small talk with the guys, more reserved than usual. Sonny hates when I talk to guys.

We made our way into the water, but I ultimately decided it was too cold and tanned as Sonny just sat beside me, annoyed. About 40 minutes passed by. “Let’s go,” he grumbled.

“We haven’t even made it to the springs yet. Calm down,” I replied.

“I don’t care. I don’t know these people. These are your friends. I’m ready to leave.”

I sat up. “We’re going to the springs, Sonny. It won’t kill you to spend the day with me and people I care about.” I got up before he could reply and told everyone we should leave for the springs. We packed up and did so. Jeanette already didn’t like Sonny, and judging by her face reading mine, she knew the reason for leaving. I tried my best to ignore the tension and headed for the truck. He didn’t open the door this time, and I put all our stuff beneath the speakers in the back. Getting into the front door, he wouldn’t speak to me.

We got back into town when he did his usual, “Do we gotta get there right now?” with a smug look on his face. After his antics, I wasn’t in the mood and replied, “Maybe after.” I had gone about two hours without nicotine (he doesn’t know I smoke), and I was annoyed by him and his attitude.

“Whatever,” he responded. He moved his hand off me, placing them both on the wheel, as he rolled the windows down.

We finally made it to the springs, and waited for the rest of them to show up. “See, they’re off doing their own thing.” He commented, as I rolled my eyes. We bickered back and forth for a little bit, ultimately ending up in an apology from him. I rested my head on his shoulder as their trucks pulled up. We mingled for a bit, as we rented our canoes and went off to Shangri-la, our hangout spot. 

It included a cave system, and there we would climb up into the forest. I was in charge of the cooler and , (Sonny wasn’t filled in on that part), and I got those set up on a dry rock by a shady tree. I forgot to mention, Paisley’s brother, Hunter met us up there. He was very sociable, and we got along great. We start to climb up onto land, and, Hunter, Sonny, Paisley, and her boyfriend Dave start to make our way down the trail. 

It had been about half a mile of fighting off mosquitos before we reached our destination. It looked like an abandoned house, but the ceiling and doors were missing. On the walls, there was satanic imagery along with normal graffiti. I didn’t think too much of it. I had never been here before, and I walked around the house, taking it all in. The rest of the gang was talking about random stuff, and Sonny clung to my side. I loved abandoned creepy places like this, and I was the last one to leave the house. Sonny insisted it was the perfect make-out spot, and as the others went back, we did just that. That’s when I heard something. “Hey!” shouted a deep voice from the woods. I immediately got off him and went to go look. Sonny asked, “What the fuck?” and I shushed him. “Shut up, Sonny.” I crept to a wall and stuck my head out. I didn’t see anything. That’s when I heard it again. “He-ey.” It shouted again. I got my shoes on and we immediately went back down towards the water. “Wonder what the fuck that was,” I said mostly to myself. Sonny had already lost interest in it, and we weren’t quite caught up with the group yet.

We kiss one final time before we jump back into the water, telling everyone what we heard. “Oh, shit. That was probably a skinwalker. I saw one the other day,” Jeanne said. I laughed and said, “Probably.” 

“You’ve never been up there before?” Hunter asked.

“Nope, I’ve only been here once with my ex,” I replied, which pissed Sonny off to no end.

“Haha, well, a hell of a first time,” Hunter laughed.

I agreed with Hunter, while I swam to a rock where Sonny was sitting to argue with him. “I’m not inviting him next time,” I thought to myself. Anyway, nothing else unusual happened. He dropped me off at home, I took a shower, wrote in here, and called him as I went to sleep.
