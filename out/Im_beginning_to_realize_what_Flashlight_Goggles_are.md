First off, thank you all so much for your feedback and input on my last post. All of your interpretations and suggestions have helped me piece this strange puzzle together just a little better, I think. That being said, it has also set me in the opposite direction just as much. The more your theories rolled in and the more you all showed me different angles to take it, the more it just made the thing unravel, opening new questions that I hadn’t even considered. Like I said, this has helped me to better understand how I should be *looking* at the puzzle, but it hasn’t made the pictures on the pieces any less blurry. If this diary was taking up more time than it needed in my life before, it’s completely consumed it now.

Overall, there seemed to be two camps of people: Those of you who viewed the log as paranormal, and those of you who saw it as a gruesome tale of a father taking the lives of his family. Let’s talk about that latter one first.

This was the explanation that I was ready to believe. I’ve never been the kind of guy who believes in the paranormal, mainly because I view things very logically. It was setting my heart at ease when I read your explanations of night vision/hunting goggles and how they could easily match up with the titular “Flashlight goggles”. That would mean that my fears about the diary were wrong, and this was nothing more than an old book recounting a bygone murder case. Paired with a few other details that could be overlooked as the imagination of a child, I was almost willing to write it off, but it was those very details that were bothering me the most.

What were the snakes Roxy mentioned? One of you suggested intestines, which was a very good interpretation, but then what was the glowing puddle of liquid on the ground next to them? And if it was her father that murdered the sibling and mother, why did it seem like they were being attacked before he left the bedroom to run to them? Once again, I was ready to pacify myself with “It was an inaccurate account coming from a young girl,” but then a few more of you weighed in, and affirmed what I might be thinking.

That flashlight goggles might not be goggles at all. That they might be the way a child rationalized glowing eyes, and that the snakes on the ground might be something even more sinister than entrails.

If you were on the same line of thinking that I originally was, then all of that might be a little confusing to hear. Before I break that interpretation down, however, I’d like to share the next log. I think it offers a lot more insight than the first one did, and if you’re hesitant to believe that more outlandish theory, I think it might change your mind.

I’ll have my thoughts for you at the end, but for now, here it is:



*Daddy and I are hiding in a shed with Aunt Sarah. It’s the shed behind her and Uncle Charles’ house. It's very cool to be allowed in here because normally Abby and I aren’t allowed when we play in the backyard. I am getting to do so many fun things tonight that I don’t normally get to!*

*Uncle Charles says there are too many dangerous things in here and that's why I’m not allowed to come inside. He probably means things like the big sword Daddy is holding. Daddy calls it a ‘macshety’, but it looks more like a sword to me. He's still shaking very badly, but it’s not even cold in here. I wonder if Daddy is sick. I shiver a lot when I’m sick too.*

*I can hear people outside still, but I think they are far away. They all are still crying and yelling, which I really don’t like hearing since they’ve been doing it so long. I don’t know how they haven’t found who they’re looking for yet when there are so many of them looking. Lucky us they haven’t found us either, since that’s why we’re hiding in here, Daddy says. I wish we had a TV or music to listen to so that I don’t hear the people outside anymore, but Daddy says that we need to be quiet since we’re hiding. I really like hide and go seek, I am the best in my class at it, so I don’t think they will find us.*

*Uncle Charles isn’t with us right now. Daddy says that he was too tired to drive, and that he’s going to sleep a little longer before joining us at vacation. Aunt Sarah must not have been sleepy like him because she’s here with us. She seems sad about something, but I don’t know what. Maybe it’s because Uncle Charles chose to stay in the house and she already misses him. I heard her say his name to Daddy a little bit ago.*

 *Her tears are getting my head all wet while I sit in her lap. She’s holding me tightly right now, which is making it hard to write because she’s also shaking like daddy. I'm glad Daddy put me in my coat, since it must be so cold outside.*

*I asked Aunt Sarah why she’s crying and if it was because of the snake, but she just told me that sometimes grown-ups just cry, and that I don’t need to worry. I am worried, but I won’t tell aunt Sarah that.*

*I wish Coop was in here with us. Petting him always makes me feel better. Maybe Aunt Sarah would feel better if she pet Coop. He’s sleeping back in the house with Uncle Charles, though. He must be tired from helping look for the missing person. He didn’t even bark when we came to the house like he normally does!*

*Daddy didn’t knock, though, so maybe that’s why. We had got out of the car very quickly and ran to the door when we finally got to Auntie and Uncle's house. Daddy grabbed a secret key from Aunt Sarah’s flowers and we went inside. He told me to stay by the door and wait, and to be very quiet. It was very dark since none of the lights were on in the house, so when Daddy started to leave I got scared. I tried to be a big girl and just close my eyes like Mommy told me, but it didn’t work very well. I held Nuzzle tighter, though, which made me feel a little better.*

*Uncle Charles and Aunt Sarah have a very big house because they have a lot of money, Mommy says. Abby and I like it here because there’s a lot of room to play castle and adventures. Coop is also here, which I really like because we don’t have any dogs at our house. Nuzzle is a dog, but he’s stuffed and not as big as Coop is.*

*I was wondering where Coop was while I sat with my eyes closed. It would be a lot less scary if I had him to hug, I thought. I heard Daddy calling out for Uncle Charles in the living room, so I thought it would be okay for me to call coop. I did it quieter though so that Daddy wouldn’t be mad if he heard me.*

*Uncle Charles has a small door on his big door in the kitchen that Coop can use to go outside, and I heard the sound it makes when it opens. I got excited because I knew that meant Coop was coming, so I called him again. I didn’t open my eyes, because I was still too scared, but I could hear his nails clicking on the floor as he got closer.*

*Usually coop runs very fast and almost makes me fall because he jumps on me because of how happy he is. Coop was moving slow and breathing very hard, though. It sounded like when we make him run really fast around the backyard but even slower than that breathing. I wondered if Coop had been outside running.*

*When I heard his nails clicking closer to me, I could see light on my eyelids, so I opened them because I thought a light had turned on. That had not happened and it was actually still dark, but I could see Coop now, and the light was coming from him! He was carrying a flashlight in his mouth! It was so cute, but I couldn’t see very well because the light was shining right at me.*

*I called for Coop to come closer to me. I wanted to get the flashlight from him before Daddy saw since we aren’t supposed to have those right now and I didn’t want Coop to get in trouble. He kept walking slow, and I thought he might be scared. It looked like he might have been hurt too, since he was walking all wobbly and tripping a lot. Coop really likes Nuzzle, so I held him out to try and cheer Coop up, and I think it worked! Coop dropped the flashlight to come take nuzzle instead, but then something very scary happened.*

*Coop fell over when he let go of the light, like when we pet him a lot and he falls down so we can get his tummy. The flashlight started rolling when it landed and moving toward me, but  It was still hard to see because it was pointing right at my eyes the whole time. I tried to make my eyes smaller to see it better and then screamed really loud. It was a snake that Coop had caught! He dropped it from his mouth!*

 *It’s head was funny like it had a light bulb stuck to it, but I was still very scared. I know I should not have screamed because Daddy told me so, but it was coming to get me and I was so afraid. I dropped Nuzzle on the floor, because I was so scared, and the snake must have thought he looked better than I did because it jumped at him. It was so fast!*

*It landed on Nuzzle and then went inside him with its tail. This snake was not like the ones daddy used to show us in the garden. It was black and sharp looking. It ripped out some of his fluff, and I screamed, which made Daddy start running back downstairs to me. It was so dark again since the snake had its head inside nuzzle, so I didn’t know where to run and I was so scared. I couldn’t move.*

*The snake heard me scream and it’s head poked out of nuzzle. The room was bright again but I still could not move. My feet weren’t working because they were shaking so bad. The snake started slithering at me again but then it’s light went dark. There was a foot that was stomped on top.*

*I thought it was daddy, but then I heard Aunt Sarah’s voice! It was her who stepped on the mean old snake! When she lifted her foot, there was an icky goo that was glowing on the floor, and the snake wasn’t moving anymore. I didn’t feel bad because it was so mean, but I still didn’t like seeing it like that. I wondered if I had glowing goo inside me, too.*

*Aunt Sarah picked me up with Nuzzle and told me that I was okay now. I was so happy to see her. Daddy made it back into the room, and he called out for me as he ran back to us. I told him that I found Aunt Sarah, and he ran over to hug us both. He asked her where Uncle Charles was, but she didn’t answer because a noise from the basement made us stop.*

*Uncle Charles and Aunt Sarah have a very cool basement, not a creepy one like Bonnie Mayhew’s basement from church. They have a lot of games and a TV and drinks that Daddy says we can’t have down there. That must be where uncle Charles was, I thought.*

*The door was open, and there was a light coming up the stairs that we could see. I could tell it was Uncle Charles when he got up because of his big belly like Santa Claus. He was making noises like the people outside and had a pair of flashlight goggles on just like them. His had both eyes lit up, and were very bright. Aunt Sarah started breathing really hard and shaking while I was still in her arms. It sounded like she might have started crying too.*

*Daddy told Aunt Sarah that we needed to go and grabbed us so we could leave. We went to the door, but outside the door window there were a lot of lights shining in. Daddy looked through then yelled some naughty words. He said we needed to go to the backyard instead. I wondered if it was the people outside, and felt very guilty if they had found us because I had screamed. I also felt very confused. Why was Uncle Charles helping the people outside, and why were Daddy and Aunt Sarah not saying hi to him?*

*Aunt Sarah started holding me like Daddy had earlier with my head buried into her neck, so I couldn’t see anything. Daddy yelled for her to ‘Go’ while he went forward to hug uncle Charles. I was glad he did this because I didn’t want Uncle Charles to be upset that we were all ignoring him, even if he’s being a bad man by using a flashlight right now. Aunt Sarah ran by without saying anything, though, which made Uncle Charles upset, I think. He made a loud angry sound, but maybe it was just because Daddy took his flashlight goggles off. I could barely see daddy holding one of the lights in his hand.*

*Aunt Sarah ran out the back door and was going to run across the lawn, but there were more lights flashing from the woods behind her house. Instead, she started running for the shed, and we ran inside. She set me down, then started peeking out the door while whispering things that I couldn’t hear. I asked her what Daddy and Uncle Charles were doing and if they were okay, but she didn’t answer me. I was starting to think something might be wrong, which really scared me. Were Uncle Charles and Daddy fighting? Were there more snakes out here, like the one Coop caught? I asked Aunt Sarah where Coop was, but she didn’t answer that either. I hope the snake he had caught didn’t bite him and hurt him.*

*I was about to ask Aunt Sarah where Daddy was again, but then I heard her call his name. I could see lights shining through the space in the door and the tiny window above the table in the shed. I was getting worried that the people with flashlight goggles might know where we are, but Daddy burst through the door all the sudden and shut it behind him. After that, all I could hear was people outside crying still.*

*Daddy grabbed a chair from the table with all of Uncle Charles' tools and put it under the doorknob. I asked him if something was wrong because he was breathing hard and covered in more red paint, but he smiled and told me that everything was okay. I’m not sure if I believe Daddy. Something feels wrong.*

*Daddy went over to Aunt Sarah and gave her a big hug. He didn’t let go for a long time. When they were done, Daddy told me to plug my ears and hum quietly to myself so that him and Aunt Sarah could talk. The adults do that a lot when they’re going to say something naughty that they don’t want me and Abby to hear, so I listened to him. Usually Daddy taps me on the arm when I’m okay to listen again, but it took him a lot longer than he normally does. I wondered what kind of naughty things they might have been saying.*

*When I was okay to unplug my ears and stop humming, Daddy told me that we were going to have to wait in this shed for a bit until all the people outside get bored and leave. He told me that I should write in my diary so I don’t get bored, but I told him that I needed to help nuzzle first. Daddy took Nuzzle to check on his hurt spot, and told me that he can fix him for me while we wait, and that I should sit with Aunt Sarah while I write. I was okay with that because Aunt Sarah could hold her phone to help light my diary, and also because she seemed like she needs a hug. I may not be Coop, but I hope my hugs are good enough to make her feel better.*

*I don’t know what’s wrong, but everyone is acting very funny tonight, and I hope they’re okay. I hope that we can just go to vacation soon…*

 

At this point, I think it’s undoubtable that something hit this town that’s never been seen before—Or maybe it has, which is why I’m still bringing all of this to you, praying that there’s some sort of worldly explanation for what is going on. Because if not, that means that the subtext of this girl's writing is meant to be taken literally, and that the snakes are…

Well, the snakes are some sort of parasite…

That leads me into the research I’ve done with the last post and this one in mind. One of you suggested looking into parasites with bioluminescence since that would explain all the glowing mentioned in the text, but my digging led to nothing of real substance. The only “snake-like” creatures I could find that emit light are glow worms and certain types of eels and sea creatures, none of which would be able to glow as bright as a flashlight, let alone be on land. None of them are parasitic either; a front I also had no luck on.

The closest thing to what was mentioned that I came across were “Taenia solium”, or pork tapeworms that can sometimes wind up in the brain and cause a thing called cysticercosis. The effects are usually never anything worse than headaches, seizures, or minor cognitive disfunction, though, and while it can result in death if untreated for long enough, that process takes years. Whatever happened occurred quick, and its effects were completely changing people—almost turning them into puppets.

The thought makes my skin itch, and I feel sick imagining that something could actually do that to a human being. It’s even more terrifying that it all seemed to happen so fast. None of this seems real, and yet, I know it had to have been, because how else did this damn book end up in my locker?

It all gets worse, however.

Maybe there was time to convince myself that the notebook was all a hoax or an overactive imagination, but unfortunately, I dug deeper. One of you suggested I try to find the notebook’s origin, something I had already been considering, and while there was a lot of risk in doing that without giving away what I was poking in to, after translating that last passage I needed to know.

I mentioned in my last post that tampering with evidence could get me in a lot of trouble, even dead evidence. This is why if I went digging into files on a closed case that’s evidence was just listed as destroyed a few weeks ago, the station could very easily figure out what I’d done. Still, I was smart about it, I think. Told our archivist that I needed to confirm that I’d destroyed everything for the case and managed to sneak a look at the file. What was listed there was dread inducing.

Nothing. There was absolutely nothing in the file.

For those of you who are confused why that’s such a terrifying concept, the average file for any federal case is usually *hundreds* of pages long; thousands if it's an event that took place on a mass scale. If something really happened to this town, even if the journal is wrong—even if it was the most insignificant event of our millennia—there would be *something* logged in our system. Evidence showed up from the scene of the crime into my locker, which means that at one point something *did* happen, and we *were* there. So why is there no record of it? Just a white screen where words and pictures should be. Not even a line saying “Site investigated, nothing of interest.”

You know the strangest part, though? It’s not necessarily true that there wasn’t *anything*. In order to log a file, even a blank one, you have to at least have some placeholder information like a case number, a state and city, and a few other necessary identifying information. Would you like to guess where this file allegedly took place?

“Washington, Pennsylvania”. Do you know how many towns and cities are in Pennsylvania named Washington? *28*. It’s the most common town name in the country with a whopping 88 townships holding that title. It’s almost like that town name was chosen to throw off anyone who went digging farther into this case.

Well, I went digging, and still didn’t find anything. None of those “Washington's” match up with any sort of outbreak or mass death that has ever occurred, and when I ditched that path and just started looking into abandoned towns and cities in general, that turned up even more dead ends. Whatever happened to this town—to these people—It was wiped off the face of the Earth, and with how horrifying the implications of this journal are, I can’t even blame whoever did it. My only hope is that they got whatever happened under control. What I don’t understand, though, is if that’s what somebody was trying to do, then why even have a case file in the system in the first place? Why not just delete it from the servers entirely? Was there some sort of encryption I missed?

So where does all of this leave me? More lost, confused, and freaked out than ever, for sure. I can’t even trust my own department at this point… This Journal is consuming my every waking thought, and while I know I’m running the risk of getting caught up in something I don’t want to be a part of the more I keep looking, I can’t help it. This changes so many things if this is real, and I just… I need to know if it is. I need to know if this poor girl escaped whatever got her town.

The thing that scares me the most now is that I may not like the truth I find at the end of all this—if there is one.

For now, there're more entries left to go. I’m going to keep plucking away at them when I can, but in the meantime, I would greatly appreciate any more thoughts or theories that you all have regarding what I’ve found. I’m in desperate need of some answers, and you all seemed to have some good one's last time.

I’ll be back when I have something else for you all. Thank you again for your help so far; I’ll see you soon.
