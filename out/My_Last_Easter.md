To most the Easter Bunny is a happy mascot to a beloved holiday we celebrate year after year, but to me he’s the complete opposite. The last Easter I ever celebrated took place at the age of fourteen. I’m an only child and we didn’t live around family so usually it was just Mom, Dad, and I most years. This year was the same in fact it’s was identical to last year. Dad barbecued on his new Treager Grill and mom hid eggs for me to find. I remember telling them I was too old to hunt for eggs but she insisted that” Her baby boy stay a baby as long as he can”. I was the most unenthusiastic egg hunter you’ve ever seen. After the hunt we sat down for dinner. 

After dinner I went into my room and turned on my Xbox preparing myself for a long night of gaming. The Xbox started up and I sat down on my bed. I’ll never be able to explain it but a feeling came over me. It felt like I was immediately uncomfortable almost panic like. I stood up and looked around my room in confusion. An eerie silence coming from the living room where my parents were just in full swing of their shows. I slowly crept into my living room like a mouse. Fear lodged in my throat as I made my way down the hallway. I began to hear what sounded like a crunching sound coming from the back side of the living room. What I seen next would change my life forever.

A giant bunny that looked like one of those men in a suit at the mall, was holding my mother in its arms while my father’s torso less bottom half lay next to him bloodied and mangled. I stood there in absolute horror not understanding if what I was seeing was some sort of messed up nightmare of if I was really watching my parents be consumed by a giant bunny. My mother let out a last whimper and cried “Run”. I let out a scream that could crack diamonds. The bunny gaped its mouth wider than anything I’ve ever seen with thousands of razer sharp teeth lining its gums. He then bit down onto my mothers skull. I turned and ran out of the front door straight to my neighbors house tears streaming down my face. I remember banging on the door screaming for help rambling nonsense. They brought me inside and asked me what was wrong. I told them my parents were attacked and they called the police. I didn’t say what attacked my parents because at the time I wasn’t completely sure what I had just seen. 


The police showed up three minutes later and stormed into my house. No trace of my parents or the bunny were in the house. My parents were just missing and there was no sign of a struggle. When the police asked me what had happened I just let it all out at once. They immediately shot down everything I said and started to accuse me of wrongdoing in my parents disappearance. I sat in a mental ward for four years after that. They could never pin anything on me but assumed that I somehow
Managed to make my parents disappear. I’m out now and I go to a therapist once a week I’m also on loads of psych meds after all of this. 

Im nineteen now and I moved into my own house. After all these years I still battle with what I seen exactly. Today is Easter and I’m quite on edge now. This morning I opened my door to a knock only to find a single Easter egg sitting on my doorstep. On the egg was a picture of my mother and father painted in perfectly but on the other side it read “See You Soon”.
