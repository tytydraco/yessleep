(part 1)  
Hi, My name is Vincent, and a week ago, my oldest friend died. The cops ruled it our as suicide. I don’t buy it. Me and Elliot have been friends since we were kids—him, the quiet genius; me, the one who always got us into trouble. We drifted apart over the years, the way people do when life starts pulling at the seams. But no matter how much time passed, I always figured he’d be around.

Then one day, he wasn’t. The day of his funeral will haunt me forever. Not because of his mother’s sobs or the angry red marks on his throat where the rope had bitten deep. No, what stayed with me was his face—frozen in time, almost… at peace. He looked calm. Too calm. Like he'd just dozed off and would wake up any second now. But no one who dies like that should look so… content. No forensic evidence. No signs of struggle. No note. Case closed before it even began. Just another lonely man who couldn’t take it anymore. That’s what they told his mother. That’s what they told me. Sleep never came that night. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for answers that never came. The silence of my apartment felt too heavy, like something pressing down on my chest. The nightmares started the following night and haven’t left me since. I see myself in his tiny apartment, my hands gripping his arms, trying to hold him up, trying to undo what’s already been done. But his body is limp, slipping through my fingers like sand. His eyes are open. Watching me. And then I wake up. My phone rang. I knew that voice too well, but this morning it sounded different. It was Elliot’s mother.

My phone rang, Barbara Grayson. I knew that voice too well, but tonight it sounded different.

"Vince? Hope I didn’t wake you, sweetheart."

"No, Barbara." I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. It was always hard to sound awake on the other end of the line when the night had swallowed me whole. "What’s the matter?"

"Vince," she paused, voice cracking slightly, like she was testing whether or not she could trust me with what she was about to say.

"I’ve been going through some of Elliot’s things. I found something strange. I... I need you to see it."After a few failed attempts to get her to give me more details over the phone, I decided to go over and see what she meant.I grabbed my jacket from the hook by the door, taking one last look at the quiet apartment. As I stepped into the kitchen to grab my keys, I froze.

There, on the floor, was a shard of glass—broken and jagged. The faint smell of old coffee mixed with the sharp, metallic scent of the glass. My heart skipped a beat.

I bent down to inspect it, a bit groggy still from the restless sleep. I thought maybe I had knocked it over in the night while stumbling around in a half-sleep state, trying to get a glass of water. I haven’t given it too much taught at the time. Just another detail lost in the fog of bad dreams. I rushed to his apartment, my hands sweaty on the steering wheel. My mind was going all sorts of irrational places, mostly due to the nightmares, but it had to be just an old photo or some memento she would want me to have. Yet something felt wrong in my gut. After a few failed attempts to get more details out of her, I threw caution to the wind and rushed to his apartment. My hands gripped the steering wheel, slick with sweat, heart racing in a way I couldn’t explain. My mind was spiraling, jumping to irrational conclusions—the nightmares were wearing me down, messing with my head. But it had to be something simple, just an old photo or a memento she wanted me to have. Still, something gnawed at me, deep in my gut, telling me it wasn’t.

Each turn only deepened the dread crawling up my spine. What could she have found that was so important? I’d known Elliot for years—there shouldn’t be any secrets. So why the hell did it feel like I was heading straight into something I couldn’t see, something waiting for me? Once at the apartment, I hesitated at the door. I knew Elliot’s familiar face and tired smile wouldn’t be waiting to greet me. That thought made my chest tighten, but I shook it off. I wasn’t here for memories anymore. I pushed the door open, deciding to let myself in.

Barbara was sitting on the couch, clutching a tiny notebook in her hands. She looked like she hadn't moved much since the funeral, as if her whole world had shrunk to this small apartment. We shared a few quiet words, exchanging memories that felt too distant, too hollow. Then, the air shifted.

“I found this in his nightstand,” Barbara said, her voice soft but strained. “The first page said it’s meant for you to read... and I wouldn’t want to go against his wishes. ”I grasped the notebook, feeling the weight of it in my hands. I gave Barbara a long look before flipping to the first page. The ink looked fresh, as if it had been written recently, after everything else.

“For Vincent.”

The words seemed to burn into my mind, the finality of them unsettling. I turned the page.

It didn’t take long to figure out the purpose of the notebook. The first entry was dated October 23rd, 2021. It was a dream journal.

I glanced up at Barbara, the realization settling heavy in my chest. I shared the discovery with her, and her face flickered through a mix of emotions—sadness, confusion, disappointment. Her lips tightened, as if she had been hoping for something different, something easier to understand.

“I was hoping…” she trailed off, her voice barely above a whisper, “I was hoping there’d be something else. A reason. A motive.”

I didn’t have an answer for her. I could feel the weight of her expectation pressing down. "I’ll read through it and let you know if I find anything, Barbara.” I said, standing up. “I need to get to work.”

She gave me an understanding nod and, after a moment, invited me over for dinner one of these days.

As I mentioned in the title, I’m a private investigator. It sounds glamorous to some, but in reality, the job is often slow, repetitive, and draining. Most of my days are spent in my car, tailing cheating spouses, snapping photos, or digging through social media profiles. Today was no different. The case I was working on wasn’t anything special—just another husband hiding something from his wife.

But as I sat in my car, waiting for my subject to show up, I pulled the journal from my bag and flipped it open, letting the words take me somewhere else for a little while. I gave the first few dreams a bit too much thought, trying to interpret whatever was going on in Elliot’s life, and reading everything three times. I quickly came to the conclusion that this was nothing special, so I just kept reading it as if everything was normal. That was until entry January 5th, 2022. It reads: In tonight’s dream I was wandering through my friend’s Vincent apartment. I saw him in his bedroom, sleeping distressed. I decided to leave, knocking down a coffee mug on my way out. The dream ends. I spent the first few entries overthinking them, trying to find hidden meanings, interpret whatever might have been going on in Elliot’s life at the time. I read the words over and over, looking for clues that weren’t there. But after a while, I concluded that it was nothing special—just a series of disjointed dreams, like anyone might have.

I kept flipping through the pages, reading each entry casually, until I reached January 5th, 2022. The words on the page hit me like a cold slap.

“In tonight’s dream, I was wandering through my friend Vincent’s apartment. I saw him in his bedroom, sleeping, distressed. I decided to leave, knocking down a coffee mug on my way out. The dream ends.”
