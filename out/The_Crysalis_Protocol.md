My name is Jason, if you take anything away from my story please take away this. It’s not a matter of if but When he will come for you. There is no escape, no solace for mankind. It happened to me. It will happen to you.

The following account takes place during the days of June 8th through June 10th 2022.

I live in a small town in Ohio. It’s one of those towns where it’s the same mundane routine everyday. Seeing the same people in the same old place over and over again. It’s enough to drive you crazy. I have a few close friends Kenny & Dave and a girlfriend of 3 years, Sarah. 

We were all going a bit stir crazy and we wanted to do something different for the summer for a change. After discussing with everyone for a few days Kenny suggested we go to Point Pleasant, West Virginia. 
He said he’s always wanted to visit the Mothman Museum. He’s one of those guys who is obsessed with creepy cryptid stories on Reddit and online forums. While Sarah, Dave, and I weren’t too keen on going just for a museum, we all agreed West Virginia is a beautiful place to spend a few days.

So we did what any young adult would do. We packed our bags, filled up our cars and sped down the highway. 

We started our drive at 4am and arrived at our hotel at about 7am.  Only stopping for small snacks and the occasional restroom break. 
When we arrived in point pleasant it was beautiful. 
Dave, Sarah, and I decided to get a bit of rest at the hotel first but Kenny was too eager to explore so he left to explore the city alone. 

“Okay, okay Kenny just make sure you don’t get lost. And don’t go getting stoned with a cryptid without us” I said with a chuckle

“Just don’t take too long I want to go the museum as soon as we can!” 

Sarah and I went up to our room flopping on the bed not even bothering to unpack. 
We almost instantly passed out with Sarah and I cuddling into a conjoined ball. 

We awoke to a knocking on our room’s door several hours later. Groggily I got up and opened the door. It was Dave. 
“Dude have you heard from Kenny? He still hasn’t come back and he won’t answer his phone.”

“We’ve been asleep this whole time. He probably just got lost and let his phone die. You know how he is man”

Pulling out my phone from my pocket. I checked to see if Kenny had tried to contact me and to my surprise I had 4 missed calls and a dozen text messages.

I quickly listened to the 4 voice mails.

“Hey man, I’ll be headed back to the hotel soon! You guys really gotta check out this place the history is really awesome.”

I quickly became concerned as the voice mails took a much more chilling turn. I could hear a slight panic to Kenny’s voice.

“Hey, so it’s starting to get pretty dark and I don’t really know how to get back call me back when you get this. I think something weird is going on”

“I think someone is following me man. Please call me back, I’m kinda freaking out.” 

I could barely make out what he was saying as a loud static seemed to emanate from the background
 
But the next message was what unsettled me the most as Kenny seemed to be calm and very monotoned, almost robotic 

“Jason, it’s peaceful now.” 

“What the hell is that about?”

My phone suddenly rang from an unknown number… a video call.
I quickly answer hoping it was Kenny. 

“Kenny?”

But what came through wasn’t a voice.

It was that same static from the voicemails, but louder. Sharper. Like it was inside my skull instead of in my ear. I jerked the phone away, but the sound didn’t stop. It just lingered in the air like a scream echoing across time.

Sarah winced and clutched her head behind me.

“Jason… turn it off!”

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t move. My eyes were locked to the phone’s screen. The static slowly shifted—pixels warping, melting—until I saw it:

Two glowing red eyes.

Kenny’s voice whispered over it, distant and hollow:

“He sees through the dark between stars. He watches the ones who look back…”

Then the call dropped. The screen went black.

I stared at my reflection in the darkened glass, but something about it wasn’t right.

My reflection blinked a second after I did.

June 9th, 1:14 AM

We contacted the police, but as soon as we said “adult male, wandered off,” they were already making excuses. “He’ll turn up.” “Probably got drunk.” “Happens all the time.”

But Dave and I knew something was wrong.

We decided to retrace Kenny’s steps. His last texts mentioned a park—Tu-Endie-Wei State Park, right near the water where the Ohio and Kanawha rivers meet. Fog rolled off the banks like smoke from a dying fire. Everything felt too quiet. No bugs. No wind. Just the sound of our footsteps and… something else.

A distant fluttering..

That’s when we found his phone.

It was laying perfectly upright on a bench, screen cracked, but still recording. The footage showed Kenny’s face in darkness, eyes wide, mouth slack. Behind him… something stood in the tree line. Tall. Winged. Not quite man, not quite insect. Not even alive in the way we understand it.

Then the video cut to static. That same pulsing, high-pitched tone.

Dave dropped the phone. He stumbled back, muttering something over and over.

“He’s underneath… he’s underneath everything…”

June 9th, 3:00 AM

We barely made it back to the hotel. Sarah was furious, terrified, and begged us to go to the police again.

But Dave wasn’t speaking anymore. He just kept looking at the TV, which wouldn’t turn off. The static on the screen… it wasn’t normal. It pulsed in rhythm—like breathing. And if you stared long enough, the shapes behind the noise started to form patterns. Eyes. Wings. A tower of flesh made of thousands of broken beings, stitched together by silence and time.

That night, I dreamed I was flying.

Not with wings—but pulled through the air like a puppet. Above the hotel, above Point Pleasant. Everything below me was wrong—warped, decaying, like a map burned at the edges. The sky above wasn’t stars—it was a membrane. And something was pushing through it. And that’s when a black viscous void began erupting and spilling out. It warped around me like a fly trapped in motor oil. It began to seep into my skin, mouth, ears and eyes. And as fast as it began it stopped. 

That’s When I woke up. 
Alone.

Sarah was gone.

And So was Dave.

Just the static remained, still playing on the TV. Like ants crawling over a pile of rice.

June 9th 7am

I called and called both Dave & Sarah’s phones. But was greeted by nothing but voicemail again and again. 

It was at that moment that panic began to set it. What had they seen in that static? What had Kenny found in that forest? 

My head was buzzing.

And then I noticed it. Sarah’s phone left on the nightstand. Open and playing a music track. But what was emanating from the speakers wasn’t music. It was that same static hum that seemed to pulse and vibrate in my head. I closed it and investigated the phone to see if there was any kind of clue as to where they had went. 

In the photo album was a picture of the hotel room. A selfie of Sarah in the mirror, a blank stare affixed to her face in pure darkness. And behind her a black shape that stood out  inside the void of darkness. Those same red eyes. But they weren’t looking at her. They were looking at me. As if it knew I would see the picture.

June 9th 7:45 am

Going down to the lobby I approached the receptionist.

“Hey, I’m looking for my girlfriend and my friend. The two I checked in with.”
 
She looked at me puzzled.

“Sir is this some sort of joke?  You didn’t check in with anyone. You checked in alone remember?”

“No that can’t be right I came here with 3 other people! We all came in the same car.”

Flipping the screen toward me. She showed me the date and time of our arrival but when I looked closer there wasn’t a single other guest booked with me. 


Noon

I drove around Point Pleasant, retracing every step every landmark I could remember. 

But something was off about the town.

Streets I remembered were nowhere to be found. Buildings were in different places or gone entirely replaced by completely different ones. Street signs were only half-legible—warped and twisted, as if the letters were being pulled inward by some invisible force.

The air was thick, buzzing.. No bugs. No birds. No wind. Just the hum, like an old television turned up too loud in another room.

And then I saw it. The statue of the Mothman. I could swear it turned to look at me as I drove past and to the museum which was somehow untouched by whatever fracture in reality had overcome the rest of Point Pleasant. I approached the curator and asked about the Mothman and what exactly he was.

He looked up at me, dead-eyed, almost robotically and said

“He is neither man or beast. He is what watches through the gaps. He has always been here. He will always be here. He was never here to warn us. He was here to prepare us.”

I asked, “Prepare us for what?”

The man just smiled. His teeth were wrong. Too many of them. Sharp and Jagged. 


4:44 PM

I tried to leave.

I got in the car, turned the key, and drove west—toward Ohio.

Except… I kept ending up back in town.

Every route, every GPS direction, every back road—led back to Point Pleasant.

I even tried leaving on foot.  I Walked for hours. Just to end up back at Point Pleasant. 

Until I saw the Mothman statue again. And again.

And again.

The town was folding in on itself. Space was looping.

Or maybe I was.


5:26 PM

I found Kenny.

Or… what’s left of him.

He was standing in the middle of the street, facing away, motionless. I called out to him.

He turned.

But his face was hollow.

Not metaphorically.
literally hollow.
An endless void of blackness that seemed to bend and warp the matter around him. 

And there was light pouring out of him. A red, unnatural glow, like the inside of a dying star. Like a wound in the fabric of the universe

He said—no, something said, through him:

“You see now. You remember. You never brought them. They were never real. You were always meant to be alone. A vessel must be empty to be filled.”

Darkness seemed to swallow me I could feel myself twist and warp.
An agony I don’t even know how to begin to describe.
 
And then I woke up in the hotel again.

Alone.

9pm

The static is a constant now.
I can feel it wrapping around and inside it now.
I feel it writhing inside me like the black void from my dream.

Had I really imagined them?
Had the delusions of my mind conjured them?
How long had I been in Point Pleasant?
Was it Days or Weeks?


I had no answers to these questions.
And honestly I didn't want to know.
I just knew I had to find a way to escape this town that had so constricted me.

I again walked out of the hotel room and made my way to the lobby. It was empty. Outside I could see a large crowd had formed. All staring into the entrance. I could hear chanting coming from the crowd. 

"You have been chosen. The vessel must filled." 

And then in the crowd I saw him. The thing that had enveloped my nightmares and watched me as I slept.
The Mothman. 
He stood before the crowd with those same red bulbs. 
His thoughts seemed to seep into me like oil into water. 

"The process has already begun. Fight as you may. You cannot stop it."
As i watch him step closer and closer. I felt myself unable to move or speak my mouth a gape. Suddenly he began to dissolve into a thick cloud of black moths. The moths rushed out with intense speed into my throat. I felt myself start to go into convulsions as they began to writhe into my body. Their spindley legs clawing at my throat on the way down, It felt as if hundreds of nails were raking at my insides. The swarm finally dissipated into my body. 
 
The world around me bagan to wash away before my eyes and I felt myself constricted. As the world washed away, behind it a wall of yellow translucent hard material was all around me. I was encased. Mummified. I began to panic and claw at the material around me.

 That's when I realized my hands were no longer my hands. They were covered in a black fur and claws seemed to be protruding from them. What had that thing done to me? 

From outside the capsule i began to hear a cacophony of sound. An alarm of some sort was blaring. Men and women in white lab coats were rushing from monitors to computers. 

I felt a rage inside of me like no other for these people. The people that turned me into this abomination. I put all of it into bursting out of the cocoon. Like glass it shattered around me as I stepped out into the facility. The scientists began to scramble around like ants. I barreled through them as I made my escape. Before I left the room I caught a glimpse of something on one of the monitors.
