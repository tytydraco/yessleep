When I was a kid my family owned a jailbroken Wii. Because of this we got access to a lot of games that either went out of circulation or were outright banned. But one of the games was different, it was called Getting Closer. The cover was pretty innocuous, just a black background with the title in white writing on the USB Loader menu. I never really wanted to play it but after getting bored with Kirby, Mario, and Dino Strike I finally gave in and decided to play the game. Usually when you hover over a game with the Wiimote it would play the theme song or some little audio snippet of the game, but when I hovered over Getting Closer it only played the sounds of heavy breathing and some kind of scraping sound.

When I hovered over It I could swear I heard the same scraping sound just down the road from out the window, but I chalked it up to our pretty state of the art speaker system. I clicked on the game and it opened up. It was a 3d platformer but as opposed to the usual bright colors and flashy visuals of your usual Nintendo games, this one was drab and dark. The character was a tall pale man in a ratty jacket, his face was stretched and warmed, each polygon looked dirty and somehow unnerving. The levels consisted of walking down cracked and broken roads and killing enemies with a large knife. I wasn't used to a game that graphic on the Wii with even red splotches forming under the bodies of defeated enemies.

 It was a far cry from the games I was used to. The enemies were odd too, rather than attacking enemies would stand and scream at you in this high pitched horrible cry. At the end of each level though text would flash on the screen “Getting Closer” in white letters just like the title. Something felt off every time it flashed, the character's warped smile would grow and grow until the screen changed to the next level.

 After a few levels though things got stranger, the street started to look familiar and the houses got more detailed, and the screams of the enemies were louder like it was coming from just outside my house. And the scraping sound only got worse. At the start of the final level though my heart dropped as it was the interior of a house and it was unmistakable, it was my house. Now with every step the message flashed “Getting Closer, Getting Closer” flashing faster and faster, the scraping sound coming now from just down the hall. I threw down my remote but it kept getting closer the message getting bigger until the scraping sound was just outside the door. I looked up to see something peeking around the doorframe, its head nearly scraping the ceiling, and its face was pale and malformed. Looking at the screen it was a perfect recreation of the room, there was one more enemy sitting in front of a TV, and the message had changed “He's Here, He's Here” in bold letters flashing faster than ever before. 

The character in the game and the monster before me moved in sync dragging a knife against the floor, walking closer and closer slowly he raised the knife. I jumped to turn off the Wii but the button burned my finger. He brought the knife down and it stabbed into my pant leg pinning me in place, but I wasn't going to quit. I grabbed the Wii and ripped it out from its cables in the wall, it sparked and even touching the console burned my hands. As soon as it was unplugged I tossed it across the room where it shattered against the wall. When I turned to look at the door frame the monster had disappeared, leaving only the carved mark from his knife in the floor through the house. 

I learned the next day from my parents that apparently a serial killer had gone through the neighborhood slashing people in the street, but it looked like he'd stopped mysteriously after entering our house. I tried to explain the situation to them but being that I was 8 they thought it was just my wild imagination mixing with the trauma of a stranger coming in the house, but no matter how much therapy they put me in, I knew what I saw. The police looked for years to try and find him but they never did, and I knew they never would. Nowadays I investigate other instances of this game, sometimes it appears in bargain bins burned into CDs, a lot of the time I find it on old jailbroken Wii’s like ours. I collect every piece and burn it, destroy it, erase it anyway I can. I won't stop until every copy is gone. So if you ever find a game on at some garage sale or at the back of your local game store with that distinct black background and white lettering. Do not get any closer, stay far far away.
