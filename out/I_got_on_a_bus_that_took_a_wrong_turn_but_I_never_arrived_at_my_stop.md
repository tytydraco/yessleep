On a warm summer night, I was hanging out at my friend’s place, and it was getting late, I got on a bus to go home. It was the usual route I took home, as always, and the weirdest things I had seen late at night were usually just junkies being twitchy. It was a warm summer night around midnight and surprisingly bright outside. As I got on the bus which was already 15 minutes late, I greeted the bus driver but he just looked through me and didn’t have any emotion on his pale, mid 40’s face. I ignored it seeing as he might had just been tired for working a late night shift. I sat on the bus in the back, as I usually did and started listening to music, and everything was going okay, until the bus I was on forgot to turn to its usual route. I thought it was probably just a tired mistake, but I was more surprised when the driver didn’t announce anything on the intercom of the bus, which is what they usually do when they miss a stop or take a wrong turn. 

Things got weirder as the bus kept missing turns and just driving completely off the route, which made me doubt if I was on the completely right bus at all. I double checked the screen that stated the next stops and how long it’d be until were there, and it still said that it’s route 12. I figured that maybe the route had changed but that thought was shaken away as I realized that we were driving out of the city onto the freeway surrounded by pine trees and occasional small patches of field. I was starting to panic, and I tried to ask the other passengers what was happening but no one seemed to mind it. Most were just on their phone or looking out of the window, waiting for their stop patiently. Then my phones service got spotty, and my gps failed completely. I eventually fell asleep, since I was tired. When I woke up we were still driving.

I looked at my clock and it said 8.06AM. How. How? It was still dark and we were still on the damn same freeway. I couldn’t see outside, the other passengers had no reaction. I was hoping desperately for it to be just a bad dream. I tried to press the stop button only to realize that it didn’t work. I tried to press all of them, and none worked. I was getting hungry, and very weirded out by the bizarre situation. Was I dreaming? Am I in some sort of psychosis? Only god knows. I try to yell at the bus driver and he doesn’t have any reaction whatsoever, as well as the other passengers, but not one had any reaction at all. I could only wait.

Day 4:
We’re still driving. Amazingly we haven’t stopped for gas, or anything. It’s still dark outside, and we’re driving on the same fucking road. Something I also found eerie was when there were occasional bumps on the road, and the passengers head didn’t even bob. It’s like they were welded to their necks. At this point I was starving, sweaty and claustrophobic. I wanted to simply get out of the bus. Then I just snapped. I wanted to go home. I wanted to sleep in my own bed. I wanted to eat. I wanted to hug my girlfriend as a reward for this horrifying experience. I tried calling her, my friends, the emergency services. Nothing. The calls got disconnected instantly. I tried grabbing the emergency window breaking hammer, but it too seemed to be welded to the holder. I kept calling and calling until it suddenly got connected and a soft voiced woman answered on the other side. ”911, what is your emergency?”, I started screaming immediately in panic that I was on a bus that wouldn’t stop, and I want to go home. She answered ”Calm down, sir, can you explain better”, and I tried to calm down, but then everyone on the bus turned their empty of emotion faces towards the like some sort of dolls. I got so creeped out, I didn’t say anything for a minute, and when I finally did say something, I realized the call had been disconnected. I’m aware that emergency calls work without service, but somehow it didn’t. It’s like I was in outer space.

Day 7:
It’s noon. It’s still dark outside. I don’t know whats happening and I’m losing my mind. No one still is reacting to anything at all. This can’t be happening. This has to be some sort of bad dream, but I just can’t wake up. My phone was also running dangerously low on battery. I was starving, and I had only survived on a bottle of water I had in my backpack. My panic grew bigger until I screamed, and threw up. No one had any reaction. I ran to the bus driver, hitting the glass between us, and finally he turned towards me. He had no pupils. He had no fucking pupils. For fucks sake whats happening? His eyes are completely white, yet somehow I still could sense that he was looking straight threw me. My hands were bleeding already for hitting the glass, and I passed out on the floor from fear and exhaustion.

Day.. well.. I don’t even know what day it is, but nothing has changed. I woke up on the same spot. I crawled back to my seat in the back, where I could sleep laying down. I’m completely isolated from the outside world, other than the occasional spotty service. I’m so fed up of looking at the same faces, and the navy blue seat covers of the bus. I’m trapped. I’ll see if I can post this somewhere. Please. If you see this. Please. Please. Please, send help. I am stuck on bus number 12.
