I was 16 and starting to become a bit of a jerk. One of my best friends since I was 10, Arthur, invited me to a party, and I dressed up nicely for the occasion. I wore a cap and my silver chain, which were all the rage in my town. I was growing quickly, nearing 5’11” and shedding the baby fat that had plagued me since childhood. Arthur was short and skinny, so skinny that my mom always offered him a sandwich whenever he came over.

The party was organized by one of Arthur’s friends and was held at a club near the beach. As the night went on, we hit the dance floor, where Lydia had been hanging out with a group of friends. Arthur had had a crush on Lydia for two years since she transferred from another school. I knew she had a drug problem and was quite alternative for our town—basically a goth in a place where there were no others like her.

At some point during the party, Lydia pulled me aside and started talking to me in a very intimate way. I recognized it as flirting, but I wasn’t interested; I was more drawn to Lydia’s friends, even though they paid me no attention at all. A few hours later, I completed my cycle of being a jerk by bragging to Arthur and another friend, Eugene, that Lydia had flirted with me and that I wasn’t interested in her. I boasted about my achievements for nearly 30 minutes, and Arthur fell silent, making me begin to regret my words.

 He forced a smile and disappeared after a few minutes.

When Eugene and I noticed he was gone, we went looking for him and found him standing at the edge of the beach, staring out at the sea. Eugene and I tried to cheer him up. After a promising conversation, Eugene suggested we walk along the beach, which was quiet and calm, with only a few boats anchored by the shore. Arthur talked more than I had ever heard him talk in all the years we knew each other. 

He spoke about his disconnection from schoolmates and family, especially his alcoholic mother and his strange father. Everytime he talked about his father he paused, like he took a minute to be certain of what exactly he was going to say, and normally stopped there.

After an hour of conversation, we came across a seemingly empty boat anchored near the sand. Eugene suggested we climb aboard, for no particular reason, just for fun. Arthur and I hesitated but eventually climbed on, as it appeared deserted. We started jumping around and banging on the doors until a hatch opened, and a pale, shirtless man emerged. He was a blonde man, extremely thin, with a wound covering part of the left side of his face. A really strange figure. 

He stood about two meters from us, glaring with anger. We were startled, and Eugene tried to defuse the situation, saying something like, “Hello, sir, we were just at a party next door; we didn’t know…” until the man yelled something in Spanish, “Hijo de puta,” or something like that, and pulled out a shotgun. We jumped off the boat immediately and ran back to the party. We heard a gunshot and Eugene yelling at us to run in zigzags.

We made it back to the party unscathed, still in shock, and collapsed on the sand. After a mix of panic and tears, we began to laugh uncontrollably, our laughter echoing into the night. It’s the last good memory I have of Arthur.

 After that day, he never treated me like the friend I had been before, and I responded by forgetting him. I didn’t know at the time, but the internal battles Arthur was fighting would lead to his suicide three years later. I have no clue of why he did that, but deep inside my body I feel like that decision was always roaming around his head, just like that day at the beach.
