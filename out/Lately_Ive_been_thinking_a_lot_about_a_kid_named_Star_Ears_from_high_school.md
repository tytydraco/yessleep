Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about a guy I went to high school with, and I don’t know why, but I just feel like I need to stop lying awake in bed staring at my lazily spinning ceiling fan and get this all out. Maybe it’s how the fan blades extend out right over me, or maybe it’s the black pit of the turned off light. I don’t know about that, but I do know the unease in this place has gotten worse and worse. This isn’t a confession or a secret or anything. It’s just something I, and nearly everyone else around her just doesn’t talk about. And maybe I should.

Is it bad that I can’t even remember his name, his real name? We called him Star Ears. He had "star" ears, or at least that's the shape that made the most sense to call him since no one could really pin down what that horrible ear shape really was, so we settled on "star".

I always thought flower was more apt, the way triangles of throbbing flesh splayed out from his gaping earhole. He hated them and hated us for hating them too. He'd “wink” his ears, closing the petals, the points of the stars, and this seemed to cause him great pain. It was like he wasn't in control when his ears winked. It was like he heard things he didn't want to hear when his ears winked. Sometimes it was one ear, sometimes the other, but if ever both star ears closed at the same time, he'd suffer from horrible seizures. He shook and drool with those to skin bananas re-peeled and pulsating, and of course we tried to help him, tried to make sure he didn’t whang his head on the desk or something, but at the same time, he was too weird to really touch, and when his ears yawned open again, we hurried away from him as if their were the open and ready jaws of cobras.

Probably that was why he was made fun of by us. We probably didn't know it, but we were scared of Star Ears and cruelty was a way to cope with bizarre appearance and behavior. We were scared to look into his abyssal ear holes. Those ear holes. At least least the grotesque winking gave us reprieve from those earholes. We dared each other to do it, to chance a glance into those bottomless voids, like a game at his expense, though I'm not sure he truly knew how much of a freak he became.

Star Ears the pariah of high school. Things only got worse and worse for him. The ears grew. The petals became redder and more ridged, more jaw-like, and more vicious in their closing, almost snapping. Poor Star Ear's brain must have been melted by his auditory horrors. I couldn’t imagine what horrible echoes he must have heard when they closed. He responded to almost no one, said almost nothing, showed almost no emotion. Those who tried to show sympathy or tried to talk to him were only met with either dead eyed stares or a nasty combination of hissing and yelling.

His star ears, of course, never ceased to flap and wriggle. They licked and lapped at the air, at the sounds, at the smells, at the sights. Star Ears took to keeping his eyes closed, perambulating around the halls with frightening deftness. By all accounts, he seemed like he did fine in school as far as grades go. Showed up everyday. Completed all his assignments. That didn’t do much for our opinion of him though.

The stories were piling up. It was always the same story too, just with different people under slightly different circumstances. Some student or teacher or parent or whoever would find themselves alone with Star Ears, and it wasn’t like he stalked them or cornered them or anything like that. It was just that they found themselves alone with the guy. It was just that they found themselves drawing nearer and nearer to him, to the “come-hither” furling of his ear petals, nearer and nearer to the glistening, orange mucus that rimmed his ear canal, to his ear hole.

If you had any sympathy for the guy before then, you certainly didn’t after a brush with those abyssal earholes.

Those ear holes… That’s what’s still keeping me up at night. I can't forget those earholes. I can't forget the sense that his fleshy petals of cartilage and bright blood vessels could taste me, could taste what I'm thinking, what I am going to say before I said it, and not just that, but knowing everything I’ll ever know before I know it, before I know what can even be known. I felt the gravity of the hole. I was leaning into it, falling into it and the only thing keeping me from being consumed and lost forever was the slimy embrace of his star ears. Like leathery tongues, they cradled my nose, cheek, and brow, holding my eye up to the earhole, that endless, shivering truth. And it was terrible. All of it.

The next thing I knew, I was jerking my head up at my desk in the middle of class.

And now I still spend my nights staring at my ceiling fan wondering if I’ll ever feel that way again.

Why was he still in school? What the hell was he?

It was clear by senior year as his ears had grown more petals and danced constantly like a pianist's fingers, that he should not be here. He should not be a part of our community. He could not graduate with us. We were not peers. Too many of us had been cursed by him with a dreadful recognition of our insignificance, a recognition that was better left unfathomable.

I'm not proud of it, I doubt any of us are, but of course we had to do something. Those ears were doing these things to us, who knew what else they were planning to do, to siphon something from us, or putting something in us? I didn’t know. I still don't know. I didn't understand any more than the next guy and no one was about to ask Star Ears what he thought he was doing.

So, some of us took action. Days before graduation he was ambushed in the halls. The teachers did nothing. They were probably glad to see it when a handful of the seniors tackled the freak to the floor. They struggled for a while, but not because of Star Ear's strength or wily physicality, but because of the apprehension from touching his lashing ear petals. Silently snarling and snapping, being nipped by one felt like it would be certain death, even though too many of us knew their soft and strange embrace.

Box cutters and pocket knives in hand, they struggled mightily to cut them off, hacking and sawing gracelessly, letting thick globs of blood and juicy orange wax splatter around. They did it though. It was a disgusting affair, sloppy and unsure, but they did it.

The newly severed star points of flesh writhed on the floor like burning slugs. All that was left was his gaping, almost gasping earholes, pits of void-black darkness delving well beyond the human mind.

That's when Star Ears started screaming and didn't stop until we wrapped his head in bandages, covering his eyes as well. All of a sudden, he was human again. All of a sudden, we cared about who he was and how he was feeling.

The star points were still alive though. Since I had been touched by the abyss, I felt like I had a duty to step in and gather the petals to spare those around me. They seemingly “died” when I held them in my hand. More than a dozen of them were stuffed into my backpack and then my backpack was taken away by the principal.

It was over, but the mood in the air felt anything but. At least Star Ears calmed down.

The boys who cut the petals were never the same. Maybe they stared too close, too deeply into those ear holes and got a dose of the stuff like none of us others ever did. They don't talk to anyone anymore, and no one likes to acknowledge their heroics. The ear flesh was burned in the school's furnace.

Star Ears still lives in our town. His parents left him behind after the incident. He's blind and deaf, though it seems to be by choice, wearing tight head wrappings and earmuffs at all times. He gets by, and although we accept him for who he is now, we stay cautious. We don't know what will happen if one day he decides to take off the wraps.

Looking at my ceiling fan every night, it seems to close towards me like it’s an octopus descending upon me, the prey. I run my finger around the smooth bumps of my own ears, squishing the cartilage around, wondering. I keep my own ear holes clean and open and listening.

He can hear me, can’t he? Can’t you? Even through the earmuffs. The work isn’t over, is it?
