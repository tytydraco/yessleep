I’ve never really been a fan of mushrooms. The texture always gave me the ick, so slimy and spongy. But as a vegetarian, they’re practically unavoidable, so I force myself to eat them on occasion to build up my tolerance for when I’m inevitably served a stuffed mushroom as a starter at a dinner party. 

I have always been a bit of a foodie, and I love to cook for myself, so I decided to take a recipe for mushroom stroganoff I saw on TikTok and make it myself. I hoped that the creamy sauce and delicious spices would stop me from cringing so much at the texture. 

I bought all my ingredients and brought them home, and started to work on the packet of chestnut mushrooms, slicing them finely and peeling off that nasty outer layer of skin. 

I got to the bottom of the punnet and saw a little yellow mushroom at the bottom. It didn’t look like the others, they were brown and fibrous and round. This one had a kind of bell shaped head and was mottled with brown and yellow spots. I contemplated throwing it out, but I assumed this was just a kind of funky looking fungi that they included in the packet in an attempt to reduce food waste, like they do with those ‘wonky’ bags of carrots and punnets of strawberries these days. 

I chopped it up like the others and added it to the steaming pan of oil and sautéed it together with garlic and cream and spices. It smelt divine. Despite my aversion to mushrooms, I loved the smell of them, and the savoury scent filled my kitchen as I continued to prep my meal. 

The little yellow mushroom was soon lost in the sea of brown and white as they reduced, and I practically forgot about it as I played myself up a portion with a hearty serving of rice and sat down to watch some Doctor Who. 

Surprisingly, I actually didn’t mind the stroganoff. The texture disturbed me at first, but as I continued to eat, I managed to move past it all together, even returning for a second helping that I’d hoped I would save for lunch at work tomorrow. I never normally had that big of an appetite, so I was surprised, but I just assumed it just have been a long day, and I’d tired myself out from prepping my dinner. 

I’m writing this now at 4am. And I don’t know what is happening to me. I’m scared. 

I woke up and looked over at the clock, feeling a burning sensation in my lungs. They felt full somehow, like they were going to burst out of my chest. I coughed, hard, and spluttered. I couldn’t stop this feeling of fullness. I turned on my lamp and kept coughing, and that’s when I noticed what was coming out of my mouth as I coughed - spores. 

They had to be spores, I’d seen videos of people growing mushrooms online, I knew what they looked like. Despite how much I hated the taste of them, I thought fungi were fascinating. They scared me, but I had some kind of morbid fascination with them. I’d spend hours watching sped up videos of them growing in mycelium. They were cool, even if a little creepy. 

I managed to control my coughing, my lungs eased but I still continued to wheeze as I took shallow breaths in and out. The spores floated in the air of my bedroom, landing on my sheets, my carpet, everything. 

I could still feel them in my lungs, and I coughed again, trying to get them up somehow, hoping this would all be over eventually. I strained and wheezed and coughed so hard I made my throat bleed. I can still feel it, agitated and weak right now as I type this. My sheets are mottled with tiny yellow spores and specks of blood. 

My lungs don’t feel so full or heavy now. I think I managed to get most of them out of me. Every so often I have to pause to cough, and a few spores float out into the air, but nothing as dense of heavy as it was earlier. 

So this is a PSA. If you see a little yellow mushroom with a bell shaped cap in a packet of chestnut mushrooms you buy from the supermarket, don’t eat it. 

It’s 4:15am now, and I’m tired. I think I need to sleep this off. Maybe I’ll wake up tomorrow and it was all a bad dream? Probably not. I’ll probably go and get checked out at the hospital too, and deep clean my room in the morning. Last thing I want is a bunch more of those little yellow fuckers growing out of my carpet. 

I don’t think I’ll be eating mushrooms again, that’s for sure. I might even try suing the supermarket for what happened to me if I find out the mushroom did any kind of permanent damage. 

If anyone has any advice on what to do, with a lawsuit, or even identifying the kind of mushroom I ate, that would be much appreciated. I might post an update if anything new happens or if there are any developments. 

Thanks.
