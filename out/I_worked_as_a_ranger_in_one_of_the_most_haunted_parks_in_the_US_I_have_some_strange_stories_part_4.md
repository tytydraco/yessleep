“Why are you doing this?” I asked him, stepping back and slowly flicking the safety off my shotgun with my pointer finger. “And where’s Stacey?” Roger laughed.  
  
“Your wife is somewhere safe, I can assure you,” he said, his face a mask of insanity and evil. “She is being transformed. She is becoming. Something more than human, greater than humanity ever imagined. With my help, she will live forever. Would you like to join her?”  
  
“I’d rather die,” I said, raising my shotgun and pointing it at his head. He smiled.  
  
“If you kill me, your wife will die, I assure you,” Roger said, pushing his blonde hair to the side. “She will die slowly, probably starving. She is in a place no one will ever find her. Only I know where she is being held. But, it is your choice. Do we not all have free will?” The creatures around him stood as still as statues, each of their blood-red eyes focused directly on me. If I hadn’t seen them move earlier, I might have thought they were simply grotesque Halloween decorations. They didn’t even seem to breathe. And then I realized, perhaps they didn’t.  
  
“What are these things?” I said, pointing to the blackened, emaciated bodies that surrounded him. “Some sort of black magic?” He shrugged.  
  
“Black magic is just a word, my friend,” he said. “There is no such thing as white or black magic. There is only power, and those with the will to change the world. As a great man once said, ‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.’” I shook my head.  
  
“I have no idea what that means,” I said.  
  
“‘Do what thou wilt,’” he said, his eyes blazing with intensity now. “Do what you will. When God created the universe, in His infinite energy and power, he willed it to be. In the space of a moment, it came out of the void. I, too, have a will. We are made in His image, after all. And my will has been honed and intensified until, soon, I will approach the power of the angels, and one day, even of God himself.”  
  
“So what’s your actual plan here?” I asked. “You want to create a race of monsters that goes around killing anyone they want at random? You want to kidnap innocent people and subject them to God knows what kind of horrors? All because of your will?”  
  
“Yes, exactly!” he said, his voice raising in excitement, a fanatical gleam shining in his eyes. “And I make myself the ruler of all, starting with this infinitesimal state, and moving onto the country and, eventually, the world. Can you imagine what we could accomplish without nationalism separating people into competing groups, without countries constantly fighting over resources? What if we had a leader with a true vision, one who could unify everyone and help to push humanity towards the next stage of its evolution, perhaps even towards colonizing the rest of the galaxy? But it all starts here, with you and me. So I’ll ask you- would you join me?” I looked over at Dean, who stood close to me, looking pale and terrified. His eyes flicked from Roger to me, as if he were watching a sports game rather than an insane spectacle of death and black magic.  
  
“I’d rather die,” I said, my heart pounding in my chest, my mouth going dry. Roger’s face turned into a mask of fury as he screamed for his minions to attack. I fired the shotgun, but they swarmed in front of him, and the slug hit one of the burnt abominations in the chest instead. I swore, turning to run into the cabin.  
  
“Dean, let’s go!” I screamed at the top of my lungs. I looked back and saw him standing there, shell-shocked and vacant-looking. “Dean!” I said again, and his head snapped towards me. He began sprinting as the creatures closed in around him. I had already reached the cabin door and waited for him, breathing fast. I raised the shotgun and shot one of the creatures only a few feet behind Dean. The slug broke through its leg, sending splinters of bone and blue blood spurting into the earth below.  
  
Roger screamed in rage behind us, an incomprehensible roar of fury and madness. As if on queue, the creatures started screaming too- a shrill, maddening sound like someone being burned alive. They didn’t seem to need to breathe, and the screaming went on for an inhuman length of time.  
  
I pulled Dean into the cabin quickly, slamming the door shut. A blood-stained padlock hung from a nail on the left side of the door. Looking quickly down, I saw a metal ring connecting the door to the wall. I pushed all my body weight against the door and took the open padlock in my hands, feeling the cold metal and the sticky, congealed blood. A sense of revulsion and horror overtook me, but I brushed it aside.  
  
With fumbling fingers, I slipped the padlock’s shackle through the door’s ring, but at that moment, a creature smashed into the other side, sending me sprawling on the ground. My shotgun went flying, sliding across the rough planks of the blood-stained floor and stopping beneath the crucified body of the cop. His intestines swayed back and forth from the force of the gun. The door flew open, and I saw the leering faces and the red, bloody eyes of the abominations as they stared in, dripping long strands of saliva onto the dirt below.  
  
“Kill them all,” Roger shrieked in an insane voice, and the creatures rushed in. Dean began shooting, and I pulled out both my pistols, pressing the thumb levers on the holsters and releasing them. I started shooting madly, and their screams turned from fury to pain as they fell on the floor, their blue blood mixing with the red, coagulated stains below them.  
  
Within seconds, we had blocked the door with bodies. The cabin was small, barely even a room, though the wood was strong and fairly new, totally free from rot or holes. The only way in and out was through the door. With the narrow doorway blocked by a dozen blackened corpses, the rest of the creatures behind them tried to push through but made no progress. One tried climbing over the pile of corpses, and I shot it in the head as soon as it peaked through. The rest didn’t follow his example. I heard their high-pitched whines and screams outside, and Roger’s much deeper one bellowing orders.  
  
“Get some dry leaves, twigs and logs!” he said. “If they won’t come out, we’ll burn them out. No witnesses. No loose ends.” He said this last part as if to himself, his voice slowing down and becoming reflective, almost meditative in its quality. I turned to Dean, terrified and exasperated. His face reflected the emotions I felt. I regretted ever coming out here. We would most likely die, and my wife would be left in the hands of that psychopath outside, unless the police made some sort of unlikely break in the case and found her.  
  
“Well, Dean,” I said slowly and sadly, “I think this is the end. Unless you have any plans. I sure don’t. I guess we could start moving the corpses and try to fight our way out- that’s probably what we’ll have to do.” Dean shrugged, his movements apathetic. He looked as if he also had given up hope. And then a miracle occurred.  
  
I heard a voice I had not heard in what seemed like eternity. It was the voice I had heard through my walkie-talkies, the one talking about dead stars. What had he said to me?  
  
As if in a flash, my subconscious repeated the strange words I had heard. I remembered, as if I were there- as if I had gone back in time and stood in the woods, calling for help with a mutilated corpse walking up behind me.  
  
“Get out of there and never come back. That cabin is for the sinners, those who worship the dead stars, those who have offered their lives to the ancient ones.” The ancient ones, yes, that is what he, or it, had said. That stuck with me for some reason. I thought of Roger, and his bizarre ideas on will. It reminded me of NIetzsche, or Hitler. Hadn’t they made a movie about him called “The Triumph of the Will”? Roger clearly had an obsession with the power of the will. In fact, I thought perhaps his obsession had come from black magic and Aleister Crowley, but I couldn’t be sure. These thoughts all flashed through my head in a fraction of a second, and I thought, for a moment, I understood something ineffable- some way out of this madness. But then it was gone, and I was just a scared man, sitting in a blood-soaked cabin, listening to an otherworldly voice.  
  
“You and your cult have trespassed on holy ground,” the voice said, booming and God-like. It seemed to come from everywhere at once, from all around me and even inside the cabin itself. It shook the ground and sent the crucified body of the police officer swaying again, his disemboweled intestines slowly moving from side to side. “You have committed horrors and disrupted the peace of the dead. You and your creatures are doomed.”  
  
“You have no power over me!” Roger said, his voice seeming faint and almost child-like in comparison to the voice of the other. “Come out here and try it! Don’t hide. Let’s see your true form.” The voice laughed. Dean began moving some of the corpses, trying to look out the door. I got up and went to his side. I saw the creatures surrounding the cabin had gone. They stood in a circle around Roger. His white face was the only color, a contrast to the blackened bodies of his minions, and the jet-black robes that he wore. He looked like a dead star in infinite space, his skin lifeless and pale.  
  
“The ancient ones use you as a puppet,” the voice said. I peered around, and saw Dean doing the same, but I could find no source for it. “I, too, have an army. But mine are not drawn from the dead, or the despicable art of necromancy. I use the forest, and its many secrets. And who do you think is the stronger- the dead, or those with a connection to the living and breathing holy ground of this place?” Roger’s eyes widened as hundreds of animals came out of the woods, a stampede of fur and feathers. I saw bears rushing in the front on all fours, approaching the emaciated, blackened victims of Roger and standing on their back legs, roaring and clawing. They swiped at their chests and faces, leaving deep gouges before lunging for their throats, and with a quick side to side motion, ripping the heads clean off.  
  
Roger turned and began to run, his remaining minions following suit. The animals chased after them, and within a minute, everything had started to go silent again. We kept pulling bodies out of the doorway, and by the time we got outside, no one was left- except for some of the corpses of the monsters.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
We made it back to the cabin in record time, moving quickly with guns drawn. I saw police cars and FBI agents everywhere, and they started moving into the woods with searchlights and dogs. Antonio Brown was back, bandaged up and looking haggard and pale, but otherwise OK. He came up to me and Dean.  
  
“We know it was Roger. We’re looking for him now,” he said. “The FBI and state police just searched all known properties associated with him. We found the blood of your wife, Cal. I’m sorry. We didn’t find a body, but it’s a lot of blood. Too much for someone to lose and survive.” His words stunned me into silence. I had held onto the glimmer of hope that Stacey was alive, that we would just need to capture Roger and then we could find out where she was held prisoner. I started shaking and almost collapsed, but Dean caught me. He pulled me over to a bench and sat me down.  
  
“Take a minute,” he said. “Just breathe.” I sat there for what seemed like hours, watching the police and FBI agents pass by, going into and out of the woods. After a few hours, a team came back. Antonio was outside, talking to the police chief of the town. The team went up to him.  
  
“We found the body of Roger Grey,” the police officer in charge said. “It looks like an animal attack. There were all sorts of blackened corpses around him, we don’t really know what they are. It looks like he dug them out of a graveyard and burned them, for some reason. The whole scene is… well, it’s bizarre. We don’t know what to make of it. There were no animals around when we went, but the tracks look like hundreds of bears, deer, owls, crows and others passed right through there and attacked him.” He shook his head. “I swear, this job gets weirder and weirder every day.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I went home that night. Everywhere I looked, I saw traces of Stacey- in the bedsheets she had chosen, the pictures she hung on the wall, even the dishes she had washed a couple days ago, which seemed like years ago now. Little did I know, but I would see her again.  
  
My insomnia got worse after that night with Roger and the strange voice in the woods. I had always had trouble sleeping, but now I didn’t sleep at all. I would sit up, night after night, drinking scotch and watching the 24-hour news channel, or just there and stare out the window. And then, after a week, I saw something strange.  
  
It was Stacey, my wife. I would’ve recognized her anywhere. But at the same time, it wasn’t her. She had the same eyes, yes, the same hair, even the same clothes as the last time I had seen her. But now, she was covered in blood, and dragged one leg behind her, weeping and gnashing her teeth. I saw her lunge down and grab a raccoon from next to the garbage, biting its neck as it squealed and thrashed in her arms. After a few seconds, its thrashing died down, and then stopped. She sucked the blood into her open mouth, her eyes shutting in pleasure, then she dropped it, turned to me and smiled.  
  
I couldn’t believe my eyes. I ran outside, but by the time I got there, she was gone.  
  
Only a dead racoon with its neck broken remained at my feet.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I took a leave of absence from work and began to search the woods. It was the only place I could think of, the forest where all this strangeness had begun. My intuition guided me, and my heart told me that if I was going to find Stacey, or what was left of her, it would be in that forest.  
  
I would return home every night, disconsolate and broken-hearted. After a month of this, I returned home and turned on the news, pouring myself a shot of whiskey and sitting back in my recliner.  
  
“...the corpses were found in a campsite next to Windermere Lake, within the Temple National Park,” the broadcaster said, and I sat straight up in my chair. That was where I worked. I knew exactly where Windermere Lake was- hadn’t I hiked it every day? The lake itself was only three miles from the cabin where this had all started, that cabin of horrors and blood.  
  
“They apparently had their throats mutilated and the blood drained from their bodies,” the broadcaster continued. “Authorities are tight-lipped on the mutilations and murders, but one officer told our reporter that eight people are now dead or missing. The governor has responded, saying that they will close down the park if…” I turned the TV off, getting up and going into my bedroom. I got dressed and put on my hiking shoes.  
  
After all, I now knew the reanimated corpse of my dead wife roamed the forest, attacking and killing innocent people. Roger was dead, but there was more work to do.  
  
I saw my wife’s smiling face in my mind, and I remembered the way she smelled, like perfume and flowers. I quickly blinked back tears and grabbed my shotgun, strapping a pistol to my waist.  
  
No matter how long it took, I would bring her down, and hopefully free the forest of this evil. It’s been three years now, and still, I haven’t had success. To this day, I still go out at night, roaming the trails. I’ve found bodies skinned alive with limbs twisted around tree branches, and campers with their faces eaten off, leaving just a mask of gore and bone behind. I’ll never know if they’re all from Stacey, or if something else lives there, but I have a mission, and I’m determined to fulfill it.  
  
I know my wife’s soul has moved on, and that something else has taken over Stacey’s body. Whatever shell remains is just an extension of Roger’s Satanic magic, his necromancy and evil. And I won’t stop hunting until I know she is at peace.
