A few nights ago, I couldn’t sleep and decided to go for a late drive. It was close to 2 AM, the streets were empty and I just wanted to clear my head. I’ve always found something calming about driving when the world feels like it’s shut down. No traffic, no noise, just the hum of the engine and the occasional glow of a streetlight. I rolled the windows down a little and kept the radio low. The night air was cold enough to sting, but it felt good. My thoughts wandered like they always do when I’m alone at that hour. At one stoplight, I reached for my phone. I’d left a couple of apps open earlier in the evening, some random sites nothing unusual. I checked the screen, glanced at a notification, then tossed it back onto the passenger seat. The light turned green and I pulled forward. The stretch of road I was on was straight and lined with trees, no houses, no shops. That’s when I saw him.  
At the very edge of my headlights, a figure stood on the shoulder. A man. He wasn’t walking or signaling, he was just there perfectly still. His posture was stiff, almost unnatural, like he’d been planted there. I slowed down automatically, thinking maybe he needed help, maybe his car had broken down further up the road. But the closer I got, the more wrong it felt. His arms hung at his sides, unmoving. His head was tilted slightly upward, and though the light hit his face, I couldn’t make out any detail. It was like the shadows clung to him even as my high beams washed over the asphalt.  
When I passed him, he didn’t move. Not even to follow me with his eyes. Just that fixed stare, straight ahead. My stomach tightened, but I told myself it was nothing. Just some drunk guy, or someone walking home late. I kept driving, trying to convince myself I was overreacting.  
Then I glanced at the rearview mirror.  
He had turned. Slowly. Deliberately. His head followed my car as I drove away, his body still rooted in place. My chest went cold. I pressed harder on the gas, not wanting to see him shrink in the distance.  
A few minutes later, I pulled into a gas station just to calm down. The place was quiet, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. I went inside, bought a bottle of water, tried to laugh at myself. Sleep deprivation, imagination, that’s all. When I walked back out, I caught sight of the glass windows of the convenience store. And my heart stopped. In the reflection, standing at the far edge of the parking lot, was the same figure. Same height. Same posture. Same stillness. Watching.  
I whipped around nothing. The lot was empty. The only sound was the hum of the gas pumps and the chirp of some insect in the distance. I drove home faster than I probably should have, checking the mirrors every few seconds. Nothing else happened that night, but I haven’t driven that road since.  
Sometimes, though, when I’m driving late and the streets are empty, I catch myself scanning the shoulder of the road. And every now and then, I swear I see a figure standing just beyond the reach of my headlights.
