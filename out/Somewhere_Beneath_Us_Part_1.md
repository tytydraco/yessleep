It wasn't long ago, and yet, the memories feel almost like a terrible, blurry dream when I think about the House. It's mildewed carpets and rotting walls, endlessly ensnaring us for years and years. When I lay in bed sometimes, I fear that when I open my eyes, I'll find myself back there, trapped as I once was. I suppose even though one can free themselves from a jail, the mind still likes to make prisons of its own, holding you captive in those memories that haunt you. Sometimes, though, as grim as those thoughts may be, sharing them makes the load a little lighter, and perhaps you all would be willing to listen to mine...

I uncapped the red pen and added another "X" to our calendar. A small one, as not to take up more space than needed. After all, the box already had three others inside just like it. Who knew how many more we would have to add? I put the cap back on the cheap ballpoint, clipped it to the top of the page, and then stared at the sheet for a while. I traced through the previous days with my eyes; each red mark I saw made my heart sink more and more. It hit rock bottom when I reached the end of the X's and saw tomorrow's date. ‘Happy birthday, Andi!’ the box read in small letters. My throat tightened, and I closed my eyes.

"Hey, has anyone marked the calendar for today?" Jan suddenly called as she exited the bathroom.

"Yep. Just did." I replied, pulling myself back into awful reality.

"Thank you, Joel."

I nodded with a half-hearted smile. "How are you feeling today?"

"I'm feeling alright. She's kicking a lot, though."

"Oh? 'She', huh? How'd you figure that one out?"

"I had my first dream about her last night," Jan said with a warm smile, placing her hands on her stomach. According to the calendar, she was about seven months along now. "And you know what, Joel?”

"What's that?"

"In it, I was outside of this place. I dreamt we were back in our world at a park on a sunny day. And she was so beautiful. She looked just like her father. Maybe it was a sign."

"Maybe," I said warmly.

"I'm surprised you were able to sleep at all last night." Daniel chimed in from the dining room. "That damn Thing was being louder than usual. Sounded like it was banging that stupid instrument of theirs right up against the wall."

The tone went solemn as Jan turned back to me. "That reminds me, I think it's your and Bea's turn today..."

I sighed deeply, "Yeah, I think you're right, unfortunately. I'll let her know. Why don't you get everyone around for breakfast, and we'll get it done after?"

She smiled and nodded before heading off to the bedroom to gather the rest of us.

I made my way through the house and into the sunroom, where Bea and Ethan sat on the floor, locked in their 2-day long game of Monopoly. It had started as a full eight-player game, but we had gone bankrupt one by one over time until only they remained. Ethan hunched over the board in careful examination, and I could tell the tensions were high.

"Bea still winning?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes," He grunted in annoyance. He flipped over one of his properties and grabbed some money from the bank. "But not for long. She's heading right by my side of the board." He looked at Bea with a smug face. "It's game over, sister."

"Dude, just give up. Didn't you already stake a Kit-Kat on this?"

"Exactly why I can't lose."

"Don't bother, Joel. I already offered him a way out. He's not budging." Bea said with a smirk as she rolled the dice.

"Ah-ha!" Ethan yelled in triumph.

"That's the property you just mortgaged."

"Son of a bitch--"

"Well, I hate to interrupt this riveting display of action, but we're doing breakfast here soon." I cut in.

"Yeah, I heard," Bea said. "Small house, remember?"

"Then you probably heard Jan remind me that--"

"Yeah... It's our turn to grab the basket." she turned to Ethan, "I'll give you a green property if you take my turn today?"

"Ha. No way."

"Don't worry. You're just on guard duty." I told her with a reassuring smile. "At least you aren't the runner."

The two stowed their money and cards beneath the board, and together, we headed to the dining room. Jan had already gathered the rest of the house and set out the food on cheap plastic tea party plates. Graham crackers and old juice boxes. Not a bad way to start the day. We all sat on the floor as we slowly munched on the honey-dipped wafers, savoring the taste. This was most likely the last of them. After this, it was back to stale saltines. Talk was small, but the nine of us seemed to be in good spirits, nonetheless. All except for Daniel. He had been especially distant lately. I'm sure everyone noticed, and I didn't want to draw attention to it, so I just let him be. Decided I'd talk to him later.

I waited until everyone was finished and the conversations had died down before I stood and helped Bea up as well. The anxiety was already growing in my chest.

"Alright, everyone, it's time. Bea and I are going to make the basket run."

The room grew heavy, and everyone nodded. One by one, they all stood and filed into the bedroom. Jan gave me a sympathetic look as she passed me, and Benjamin placed an old, weathered hand on Bea and I's shoulders.

"Be safe, you two."

I nodded with a look of confidence, hoping it would set the group at ease. After they had all entered, the bedroom door shut and the lock clicked. I turned to Bea.

"You ready?" I asked.

She sighed deeply, "Ready as ever."

We walked into the kitchen and crossed to the end of the room. Together, we slowly and carefully slid the heavy wooden pantry away from the wall. Immediately, I felt the instinctual feeling of danger in the pit of my stomach as I looked at the door hiding behind it. Bea looked at me and pursed her lips. I smiled and brushed a strand of hair from her face.

"We'll be okay."

She nodded and then grabbed the sharpened broomstick that rested in the corner. We were certain that it would do nothing to help if anything ever did go wrong, but nobody wanted to admit that. It allowed us to feel like we had some sort of power. When we were both ready, I turned the lock on the black doorknob and gently opened the door.

The scent of mildew and age hit us as I slipped into the old, empty, yellow room. The air was cold and stale, carrying only the sound of my shallow breathing. The window on my right was caked with dust and moisture stains, painting only a blurry image of the endless hills outside. The orange shag carpet had been matted down with a perfect path from the past years of the same routine; a walkway straight from the door to the middle of the room. Another door hung open on the farthest wall opposite me, revealing only darkness beyond. No matter how many times I had seen that open doorway, the dread never went away. In the center of the empty space, alone on the floor, sat the basket.

The basket was a loose name for it. Really, it was whatever container the Thing downstairs could find to fill with junk. Junk that had kept us alive since we arrived in the house. Food was the only consistent thing it put in the container. Everything else was always a gamble. One week, we might get something we were happy about: Books, board games, clothes, soap, things like that. Other weeks, we might get a bunch of trash. Old circuit boards, doorknobs, children's toys. Everything it brought was always used, dusty, or covered in mold, but we learned to deal with it after a few months. Just clean it off and make do. After almost four years, we still had no idea why it did it each week or where the stuff came from. Our best guess was that it was some sort of game to the Thing. That, or it was still trying to bait us out. Regardless, it kept us alive, and we never wanted to think about it too long.

This week's basket was big. A grey plastic storage bin filled to the brim. It would likely be heavy but easy enough to drag across the carpet. I turned back to the doorway, and Bea quietly slid me the trash can we kept by the door. The container from the previous week, always filled with our waste and whatever we didn't take from the last basket. Anything left in the room, the Thing would take back. I set it beside the door, then quickly glanced at Bea, just in case it was the last time I'd see her. She stepped into the doorway, clutching her broomstick, and watched me intently.

Here we go.

I walked slowly across the carpet, making sure to step as gently as possible. With each stride, I stopped to listen to the opposite doorway. So far, I heard nothing but the heartbeat in my chest. I crossed farther in, making my way to the bin. The few feet into the room always seemed like miles. Bea watched the other door while I kept my eyes on the basket and continued my routine.

Step.

Nothing.

Step.

Nothing.

Step.

Nothing.

Finally, I reached the basket and glanced inside. Sure enough, this was a good one. Not only was it full, but it was packed with valuable supplies. Boxes of cereal, blankets, I could see two rolls of half-used toothpaste, A deck of cards, and a whole lot more. Not wasting any time, I placed my hand on one of the side handles and began to carefully pull the basket back to the safety of the house.

Step.

Nothing.

Step.

Nothing.

Step.

*Tink, TINK!*

Shit.

"Joel!" Bea called, alerting me of the noise I was already well aware of.

Forfeiting stealth, I yanked the basket hard and bolted for the doorway. Below me, I could hear a chorus of thuds as the creature beneath scurried to the stairs, banging its instrument the whole way. I heard it round the corner of the steps and collide with the wall as I reached the kitchen. Bea let me inside, then turned to help pull the basket. From the doorway across the room, I heard it dragging its body up the steps, letting out a high-pitched and inhuman squeal of excitement. Together, we yanked the basket inside, but added momentum from Bea caught me off balance and forced me to fall onto my back. She stumbled as well but quickly leaped up and slammed the door shut, flicking the lock into place. She collapsed onto the floor next to me, and we both crawled backward on our palms until we hit the dining room wall. She grabbed onto me, and I held onto her, and together, we just watched the door, listening to the beast thrash against it. It violently jostled the handle to no avail, and I thanked God that the house was indestructible.

I had only ever caught a *glimpse* of the thing, one time right at the beginning. Based on the size of its arm and hand alone, there was no way any normal structure would have held. Luckily, however, the house seemed to have its own strange set of physics. Items and things within it could be destroyed, however, anything that was a part of the house itself wouldn't break. That meant windows, fixtures, walls, and, luckily for us, doors and their locks. We learned this when we tried busting open the door in the back of the bedroom for an entire day. It was locked from the inside, and we had hoped that it might be some sort of exit. No matter what we threw at it, though, the metal grey door didn't get so much as a scratch. This, of course, was good news for us later, as it meant that as long as we kept the kitchen door shut and locked, the Thing downstairs couldn't get us.

Bea and I sat there for a while before it finally gave up. It let out a couple of disappointed screams before I heard its body tumbling back down the steps and into its half of the house.

When it fell quiet again, Bea sighed and rested her head on my shoulder. "I hate that thing so much."

"Hey, don't be so hard on it," I told her, panting, "It buys us groceries," I said, pointing to the basket. She didn't find it funny.

We stood and pulled the crate into the living room, then walked to the bedroom door and signaled. Three knocks, wait two seconds, knock again. Jan opened the door, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief when they saw that both of us were still there.

"I'm glad you two are alright. That sounded rough."

"Eh, not too bad. Not as bad as some days. Good haul, though." I told her. "Sometimes, I wonder if you got pregnant just to get out of basket duty."

"Ah, you caught me. I'd take 9 months of this any day over running basket."

The group gathered in the living room and began to sort through the bin, separating community items from personal items. Grace was already breaking out the rusty bingo cage for the raffle. Meanwhile, Bea, Ethan, and I returned to the kitchen to slide the pantry back into place. The door may have been indestructible, but, like the broomstick, it helped us feel like we had power.

"I'm glad you guys are okay. I was worried when I heard Bea shout." Ethan said.

"Yeah, it was oddly close this time," I replied. "Usually, it doesn't wait that close to the stairs."

"Maybe it's getting smarter?"

"Could be. Although after years of it still not catching on to the same routine, I'm not too worried about that possibility."

"Hey man, you never know. We've only been here a couple of years. Maybe it's getting older."

"Oh gosh, don't say that." Bea groaned. "I don't want to think about that thing getting any worse."

Once the pantry was back in place, we rejoined the group. Grace had the bingo cage ready with all of the balls inside. Each one had the numbers etched off and our names written on in magic marker. In the basket was the remainder of what had been left over after we had taken out necessities.

"Alright, everyone, Raffle time. As usual, the two heroes get first pick." Grace said, smiling at us.

"You first," Bea told me, "You had to run."

"You sure?"

She nodded.

I walked over to the bin and sifted through what was left. A book of poetry, some pens, a roll of floral wallpaper, a keychain, some clothes... Bingo! A bag of old gummy candy. It was long past its expiration date, but living in the house had taught me that with artificial foods, it's usually just a recommendation that your stomach might disagree with. Bea went next and took the book. After that, Grace spun the cage and drew names, each person taking whatever scraps were left to add to their collection. When nothing remained, we set the container in the kitchen and returned to our business for the day. I followed Bea and Ethan back to the sunroom, where they resumed their game.

"I'm so glad you didn't die," Ethan told her. "Can you imagine if I had never gotten the chance to beat you?"

"I can imagine it. Cause you're never gonna beat me."

I smiled as I watched them pull their money out and resume. In a scenario where I was trapped in a total of six rooms with only nine people, I was lucky to have friends like them. However, as soon as I had the thought, I felt a pit form in my chest. We had arrived at this place with 15 people. We were down to 9 in such a seemingly short amount of time. We had lost 3 alone our first night here. 2 more the next. Then last year, Andi...

I winced and tried to force my mind to think about something else. Unfortunately, as I anxiously glanced around the room, looking for a distraction, my eyes caught the words painted above the door.

*‘IN MEMORY OF HILLARY. YOUR SACRIFICE SPARED US ALL.’*

She was the first of us to go. We didn't even know her name until after she had died. I had woken up to Daniel shaking me.

&#x200B;

"Hey, kid, you alright?"

"Huh?" I asked as I sat up, taking in the muted, water-stained room around me. I also noticed other people in the space, all of them looking just as confused as I was. The place clearly wasn't familiar to me. The last thing I remembered was falling asleep on a bus. I was on my way to... Well, that's not important. What *was* is that I was not where I was supposed to be.

"W-Where am I?" I asked.

"I'm not sure. None of us do. We just woke up as well."

The floor felt damp beneath me, and the air smelled toxic, like mold and rotting dry wall. Light leaked in through a window next to me where a girl stood looking out, a perplexed expression on her face. This was Andi, but I wouldn't know her name until the following morning. Daniel helped me to my feet, and I glanced around. Everyone else seemed like they, too, were gathering their bearings. A door led out into another room, and I saw a few people cautiously looking inside. When they found it seemed safe, they stepped through it.

"What's going on?"

"I'm afraid I don't know that either." Daniel continued. "We're still trying to figure it out. We were all on the bus together; I just don't remember what happened after that. We're in someone's house, but I don't know where." He gestured to the window, "Not exactly easy to tell."

Looking outside, I realized what he meant. The landscape outside and all the way into the horizon was nothing but steep, grassy hills. They were unnatural-looking, perfect round mounds; the way a child might draw them in a picture. The sky was covered in a thick blanket of clouds, blocking the sun and painting the hillside in a gloomy, dim light.

Now that I had fully come to and analyzed the immediate situation, I turned back to take in the room. A woman, who I would come to know as Jan, held her phone to her ear. After a moment, she dropped it to her side, defeated.

"There's nothing. No signal."

"Me either." Another woman said.

"What's going on?" A man asked angrily. "I had places to be. If this is some sort of sick prank, then it's not funny."

"Yeah, I'm sure someone drugged a bus full of people and took them to an abandoned house as a prank."

"Oh, well, do you have any other ideas?"

"Maybe we've been kidnapped?" A younger gentleman chimed in. He looked worried but seemed more like he was eager to help. Ethan.

One of the men who had left the room re-entered the doorway, "Well, if we have, then our captor isn't a very good one. He left the front door unlocked."

A few of us, myself included, made our way out of the bedroom and into the hall. From where we stood, we could see the sunroom where two people peered out of the open front door. A doorway led to a bathroom on the wall next to us, and just past that was an entry into what looked like a kitchen. We all dispersed around the area and began to investigate. Some people tried their phones again, others looked out the windows. Some began interrogating each other over information. A group formed by the sunroom door, and a few shuffled outside. I heard someone moving in the kitchen and peeked around the corner. Andi and another girl gathered around a door on the far wall. It was white with a texture that matched the paneling of the surface around it and had a black doorknob. Andi wrapped her palm around the handle and swung the door open.

From where we stood, there was a clear line of sight across an empty yellow room and into another doorway that held nothing but darkness. We may not have known how dangerous it was at the time, but I still recall feeling incredibly uneasy at the sight.

"Ugh, that's creepy." The girl with Andi said.

"Yeah, I'm getting really bad vibes from this place..." She muttered back.

"Is this even a house? The layout makes no sense. And why on earth are there no lights?"

"Maybe it's really old."

"Could be. But it looks newer. Like 70s or 80s."

"That's true. Although Shag carpet is *definitely* out of style." Andi joked, pointing to the floor of the yellow room. The other girl chuckled softly. It must have been that small interaction that solidified their relationship so early, as Andi and Bea stuck close together from that point on.

Suddenly, I heard the people by the sunroom door start to raise their voices in an argument. I watched as one of the three who had gone outside ran back in.

"No way. That don't feel right." The man yelled, pointing out the door.

"Well, what other choice do we have? We can't just wait around here forever." a woman's voice yelled back.

"We haven't even checked the rest of this place! Maybe there's a landline we can use to call someone. Or there might be someone here who knows what's happening."

"What's going on over there?" I heard Andi ask behind me, startling me a bit.

"Oh, um, I'm not sure. Sounds like they're arguing about something." Together, we walked closer as Bea shut the kitchen door behind us.

"You seriously don't feel that?" The man by the door continued to the woman outside.

"I mean, yeah, it's unsettling, but this whole situation is. I just don't think sticking around here is the best idea."

"Why not? Someone will notice one of us is missing eventually and come looking."

"Yeah, and whoever brought us here is also probably in the house still. I'd rather take my chances looking for a road and flagging someone down over staying in that crack den."

"Fine, suit yourself. All I'm saying is it's a bad idea. I just feel it."

Andi and I reached the sunroom and stood in the doorway. Daniel stood nearby, and I tapped him on the shoulder.

"What's going on?"

"This guy here says that something's not right out there. He doesn't think we should be outside."

The man heard Daniel and whipped his head to us. "I ain't crazy! Go out there and feel for yourself. That is not... natural."

Daniel looked at me and shrugged. He crossed to the front door and took a step outside. I hesitated but followed out of sheer curiosity. At this point, I was starting to grow nervous. Something wasn't right about this situation. And while that was an obvious observation, there was much more to it. The man was right. None of this was natural. With all of the worldly possibilities for what was happening, none of them answered any of the questions that the house presented. It felt like we were somewhere that we shouldn't be. That was only reinforced when my foot crossed the doorway and stepped onto the cracked stone landing.

Instantly, I felt dread swell in my chest. The sensation of danger mixed with the feeling of fear. The whole scene before me was... wrong. The landscape felt unnatural. The hills too perfect. The sky too solid of a color. The grass too vividly green. It felt like a cheap imitation of something we knew. The air was perfectly balanced in temperature, and yet I still felt cold. No wind blew, not even a slight breeze, and it was quiet. No birds. No rustling. Nothing. This place was not for us. It felt like it was never meant to be seen. The worst part was the nagging sensation I felt in my stomach.

Have you ever had those dreams where something is chasing you? It doesn't know where you are, and you're trying to round the corner before it sees you? That was the feeling. The outside was the chaser, and the house was the corner. I desperately wanted that corner, no matter how unknown it was. I looked at Daniel, and he looked to me. We both felt it.

"W-wait..." I started. "Something is wrong."

"We should get back inside..." Daniel added.

"Oh, great," The other man who followed the woman out said. "Them, too."

The woman sighed, "Listen, I understand everyone is terrified and confused. I am too. But we need to figure something out, and we aren't going to do it by standing around here. You don't have to follow; just stay here and be safe. Once I find help, I'll come back for you all."

"Don't say that we didn't warn you!" The first man called after her.

The woman turned to the man still with her. "Are you coming?"

He nodded, and together, they began to make their way across the grassy field and to the hills. As they walked, Daniel and I stepped back inside. Instantly, I felt relief wash over me. I breathed a deep breath and turned to the sunroom. At this point, everyone had gathered and looked out the long wall of windows at the two people traversing the hills. I found an open spot and began watching as well.

"You alright?" Ethan asked next to me. He had witnessed the whole interaction.

"I'm... not quite sure. Something is seriously wrong."

"Why is he stopping?" Jan suddenly muttered.

I turned back to the window to see that the woman was still trudging up the hill while the man following had halted before the slope. He was saying something to her, but we couldn't hear. She waved a dismissive hand and continued onward.

"Maybe he changed his mind?"

"I told them..." The first man muttered. "This is not a good idea..."

As the woman scaled the hillside, we watched her begin to sway back and forth on her feet. At first, I thought it was just due to the hill's incline, but it soon became more drastic. She stumbled about like she was drunk, collapsing a few times and picking herself back up as she continued. We could now hear the man screaming for her to stop and come back, but it didn't seem like she even heard him. She stood to her feet as she crested the hill, then stopped. She glanced off over the horizon for a minute. All was silent as we watched, waiting to see what happened next.

The room gasped as we saw her fall straight back and tumble down the hill.

The man ran over to her body as it tumbled to a halt and flipped her over. He shook her a few times, put his ear to her chest, then suddenly leaped back  with an expression of pure terror on his face, mouth agape and eyes wide open. He scrambled to his feet and dashed for the house, tripping over himself as he ran. Jumping up onto the concrete porch, he burst through the door. Immediately, people were there with questions.

"What happened?"

"Is she okay?"

"What's going on?"

The man didn't answer. He just walked out of the sunroom and into the dining room with a ghost-white face. He leaned against the wall and slid down into a corner, hugging his knees. A few people followed and surrounded him.

"What's going on?" Jan asked, "Is she alright? Why did you leave her?"

The man looked up with unblinking eyes. "She's dead."

I would like to think we had handled everything rather collectively thus far for the situation we were in. But that sentence was what broke the dam. The room felt heavy. Whimpers and gasps echoed among us. The woman who was Grace began to hyperventilate.

"W-what is happening? What is going on?"

"She's dead? What do you mean dead? She was just fine a second ago!"

"What happened out there?"

"I don't know..." The man just muttered softly as he stared vacantly at the floor.

"What do you mean you don't know? You were standing 20 feet away from her!"

"We have to go get her! She could still be alright!"

"No!" He suddenly shouted from the floor. "Nobody goes back out there."

"We can't just leave her! Maybe she needs CPR."

"Did you not just see what happened? You're all crazy if you think that-"

"That's enough!" Daniel yelled above the chorus of voices. "The last thing we need to do right now is panic. I think it's obvious by this point that this situation is not normal. Who here has ever seen something like this?"

Nobody answered.

"That's what I thought. So, let's just take this nice and slow." He looked at the man on the floor. "I know something is wrong out there, but these people are right. Dead or not, we can't just leave her out there. Now, her body landed at the bottom of the hill. You were safe the whole time you were standing there. I'll go get her body and bring it back in."

The trembling man took a silent moment before responding, "You can get her body, but for everyone's sake, don't bring it inside. Something ain't right about it."

"What do you mean?"

"You'll see when you go out there."

Daniel looked baffled but didn't push any further. It was clear the man was in shock. He turned to Ethan and me. "Do you boys mind coming to help me?"

I really did mind. After what I had just felt and witnessed in the last five minutes, outside was the last place I wanted to be. But everyone was scared, and I didn't want to cause more fear. We both nodded.

People continued to murmur quietly among themselves as we headed for the door again. I stepped outside and instantly felt the dreadful feeling overcome me once more. I turned to Ethan to see his expression as he, too, felt it for the first time. We went down the steps as everyone watched us from the window. Slowly, we made our way across the field, and I began to realize why the man had stopped before the slope. The closer we got, the stronger the feeling in my chest was. I felt like a magnet trying to push itself against an opposing force. We moved cautiously, and I watched the crest of the hills the whole time. I didn't know what she had seen, and I probably never will, but I hoped whatever it was didn't come charging over the ridge after us.

Her body lay in the grass, face up and unmoving. Gingerly, we approached and knelt down beside her. I nearly jumped back as I saw her face. It was not the face of someone dead. It was locked in an abnormally large smile as if she was using every muscle in her cheeks to twist her lips upward. Her eyes were completely open and bulging out of her head, pink and bloodshot. Blood pooled around the edges and ran down her cheeks. We all stared down in horror.

"What the hell..." Ethan muttered.

Daniel hesitantly reached out a hand and touched two fingers to her neck. After a moment, he nodded, "He was right. She is dead."

He tried CPR for a few minutes, but he gave up when it proved fruitless. There was no saving her now. Daniel touched her eyelids and attempted to close them, but they wouldn't. Each time he shut them down, they would snap back open to their haunting gaze.

"I don't think they need to watch this anymore," I said, looking over my shoulder at the house. It was a small building with dirty white slats and a scuffed mossy roof. However, it appeared to go back further than we had seen so far. "Let's just get her back," I suggested.

Ethan and Daniel agreed, and together we hoisted her body up. Daniel and I grabbed her arms and legs, and Ethan supported her back as we moved. While we carried her along, something slipped out of her back pocket. A small wallet. Ethan stopped and picked it up, and once we reached the house, we lay her down against the wall. A few people peeked around the corner.

"What do we do with her?" I asked.

"I'm not sure. If she's dead, this might be the best spot to leave her." Daniel answered.

"Yeah, plus that guy was right. There's something off about her." Ethan added. He had a point. She may have been dead, but the body had a strange life to it. The face muscles were so tightly locked, and her skin still had so much color. It felt like she might jolt up and begin screaming at any moment. We mutually agreed that, for the time being, we would leave her here while we sorted out the rest of our problems.

Had we known what would become of the body, we might have done differently.

As we headed back up the stairs, Ethan thumbed through her wallet. I looked at him with slight judgment.

He suddenly realized what it looked like. "Oh! No, I was just--" He slid her license from the wallet pocket and showed it to me. "Her name was Hillary. I felt like we should know that."

It hadn't seemed important at the time, but after we realized that we might be at the house for a while, we felt that she deserved some sort of remembrance. While she had been warned not to go, it was bound to happen eventually anyway. After the first night in the house, we would have undoubtedly run for the hills. Hillary sacrificed herself to show us that that wasn't an option. She ended up saving the rest of us from her fate.

‘Your sacrifice spared us all.’

I like to hope that wherever Hillary is now, God rest her soul, she knows that she really did help us in the end...
