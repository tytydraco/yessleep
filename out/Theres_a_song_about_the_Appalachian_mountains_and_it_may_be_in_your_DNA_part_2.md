When we got to our campgrounds we all went and set up our tents first, I’m guessing I wasn’t the only person who was thinking a nap on my sleeping bag sounded perfect. When I finished setting my tent up I stepped back and looked around to see if anyone else needed my help. Pretty much all of us had our own little one or two person tents. Marybell seemed to have finished first and was helping Lana. Gabriel and Scott were apparently sharing a tent, and working together on it, and Leano was already done, and putting rocks in a circle to form a fire pit. I went over and started helping with sourcing and arranging rocks, then we collected some fire wood and got everything set aside, ready to go for when we needed it.



He flopped down on a stump with a smile and pulled something kind of crumpled out of his pocket. 



I leaned over, “What’s that?”



He smiled toothily, his skin so pale it was almost blue against the whiteness of his teeth, “A postcard I purchased to remember this place by, when I leave. Or perhaps if I don’t leave, to simply remind me to admire the world around me.”



Leano is a little weird, but in a sweet and harmless way. If I had a sister I might set them up.



He showed me the postcard, it had a picture of some mountain range I was unfamiliar with, but I assumed it was what we were on now. I looked at it for a long time, feeling something like an itch in the back of my brain. It felt like something was in the furthest corner of my mind, shaking itself loose, but it hadn’t reached the front of my mind yet. I felt the itch grow to a crescendo, a feeling like having a song halfway stuck in your head, where you remember what the song feels like and not what it sounds like. 



I stood, feeling as uncomfortable as I had when the deer got on its hind legs that morning, and backed away slowly, “Thanks for, uh for showing me that Leano. I just remembered.”



I didn’t bother finishing the sentence as I got back in my tent and zipped it up. All of a sudden I wanted to go home. Not back to that stupid rental house and its dumb creepy deer, I wanted to go right back to Alaska and my parents.



But that wasn’t really an option, not right then anyway, so I laid on my sleeping bag, ignoring the voices of my coworkers chatting until sleep finally found me. I didn’t sleep for long, just under two hours, but I dreamed. I dreamed that I was walking along with my five year old self, we were hand in hand, but not talking. Her skin shimmered gold in the light, and her red hair (I was a true ginger as a kid, now my hair is more like a dark red-brown color) bounced against her cheeks in a way that was almost ridiculously cute. God damn I was a cute kid.



After a moment I heard a familiar, commanding voice call out, “Samira! Stop!”



The voice jarred me, and I looked up, realizing all of a sudden that I was laying on the ground. I looked over, trying to spot little me to see if she was safe, and realized she was about two feet away from me, staring at me with a mix of fascination and terror. I looked down, and saw that my body had become long and sleek, not a human body at all but the body of a snake. I had red and yellow diamonds on my scales, interspersed by patches of black. An old rhyme tried to play in my mind but I couldn’t seem to get it right, "red and yellow, black and red, kill a fellow, venom lack”. I looked down again and saw the red and yellow on my scales seemed to be moving, taking on strange new patterns.The diamonds swirled and moved, forming unsettling images that seemed to disappear from my memory as soon as they disappeared from the scales on my body. I looked back at my younger self and opened my mouth, wanting to explain that I wouldn’t hurt her, couldn’t hurt her, but all that came out of my mouth was a hiss.



Little me reached toward the snake, a look of concentration on my young face, and then I woke up. With the same half rhyme stuck in my head about snakes, I stumbled out of my tent, feeling like I was bursting out of a coma. Leano, Scott, and Gabriel were gone but Marybell and Lana sat by the fire that still had yet to be lit. Lana looked at me with a crooked grin, she wasn’t necessarily someone I would consider pretty, her teeth are crooked and one eye is noticeably larger than the other. But she has a warm smile that always seems to be masking just a little bit of chaos. I couldn’t help but like her.



I leaned against a tree next to them and said, “Where did the guys go?”



Lana pointed vaguely into the trees as Marybell said, “Good morning sunshine, were you napping or fighting a cougar in there?”



I furrowed my brow and both of the other women laughed. Marybell said, “You look like you just got out of a wrestling match, And I’m inclined to think you lost.”



While I tended to like Lana, Marybell was a different story. She reminded me of one of those high school mean girls who starts bullying you to take the spotlight off herself. As a result I had avoided her in the research lab, sticking closer to other people, even just keeping to myself.



I responded to her teasing with a forced smile, “Yeah, apparently.”



I looked around, wishing there were more people around so someone else could talk to Marybell and I could wander off to a place where she wouldn’t be staring at me. After a few minutes Lana sighed, slapped both hands to her knees, then stood.



She said, “Alright, now that Sam is up I’m heading down to the water. Do either of you want to come?”



Marybell shook her head no, and while I didn’t love leaving her at camp alone, I agreed to walk down to the water with Lana. I didn’t have a watch, but glancing up at the sky it seemed to be around 2 in the afternoon. 



We walked in silence for a while, until I said, “So, do you like hiking a lot?”



Lana gave me a pitying look, as if she understood how awkward I felt and how hard I was trying to mask it and said, “No, not at all. I mean I work out a lot, but this is my first time doing anything like this. What about you?”



I shrugged, “Tons when I lived in Alaska. But this is my first hike out here.”



She smiled and nudged my hip gently with her own, the way a lot of my gal pals had back in high school. It felt familiar, kind, and friendly. “So in a sense this is the first time for both of us, huh?”



I smiled back, “I guess so.”



We walked in silence for a while before she said, “So, Alaska? What’s that like? I always imagined it as just… unending wilderness. With like a diner, a few cars, and a couple houses. Maybe a gas station.”



I laughed so hard I had to stop walking, leaning against a tree until I caught my breath, then said, “God, I’m sorry that’s just weirdly accurate to what it feels like to drive through Alaska. Like, you can drive for hours and not see a single thing then: boom! House, car, moose, diner, and then wilderness again.”



She laughed too, “Okay great, I’m glad to learn that I was right.”



We kept walking and in the distance I could see the small lake and hear the guys laughing and splashing around in the bright sun. All of a sudden all the fear I’d felt earlier in the day vanished, replaced by a full body rush of excitement. Lana and I looked at each other, then began running towards the water, shedding items of clothing as we did. The guys noticed and began whistling and laughing, causing both of us to dive into the water, splashing the three of them as we did. 



That started an all out splash war that ended with everyone soaked, laughing and exhausted. By the time we got out of the water we were exhausted in a happy way that I hadn’t felt since I was a kid. As we walked back, Scott, who usually gets in trouble with Nora for flirting with all the interns, had an arm around Lana who was blushing gently as he talked to her.



I watched for a moment, feeling hopeful for Lana and a little anxious that Scott might just be trying to take advantage of the camping trip. But I could smell dinner before I even saw our campsite, which made my stomach rumble with hunger, and erased pretty much any other thought from my mind. I was starving. We’d stopped to eat a few hours earlier, and I was glad Marybell had taken the initiative of starting dinner.



While we had been swimming, shel had gotten started grilling hotdogs, hamburgers, and a few veggie burgers just in case (apparently Marybell is a vegetarian) and even had the buns toasted by the time we got there. My stomach rumbled as I sat down, and I could tell everyone else in the group felt similarly. We made short work of dinner and did what little cleaning up there was left to do as a group.



After dinner Leano flopped down next to me with his postcard. 



He traced his finger along the mountain and said, “Where do you think we are?”



It was cute, Leano had always felt like a little brother to me, and that seemed like a little brother kind of question. I studied it, dredging up everything I could remember about US geography and finally planted my finger where I assumed we were. 



I traced a circle with my finger and said, “Right around here somewhere.”



Leano hummed, something that sounded familiar, but wrong, like he was hitting the right notes but in the wrong order. His humming changed, still wrong but getting closer. As Leano continued his humming I turned towards Gabriel, a tall quiet Latino guy and tried to strike up a conversation with him. He nodded politely as I chatted, but I didn’t feel like he really wanted to be a part of the conversation.



I turned back to Leano, who looked like he had just made a very exciting discovery. 



He shoved the postcard back into my hands, put my finger at the base of one of the mountains and said, “Follow along, move with the elevation, like you read music.”



Before I had a chance to stop him, he started whistling. Despite the sense of foreboding that came over me I followed his notes with my finger, moving along the mountain range: a three second high note that seemed to climb up a mountain, two second lower note following the dip back down, the same three second high note followed by a two second higher note (going up the incline), a sustained three notes, another one second dip, and another two second lower note.



When he stopped I stared at the postcard in a wondering horror. I felt bad about what I was about to do, considering multiple people I trusted and respected had told me not to whistle, but to be honest I also resented that advice. What danger is there in whistling? Why was everyone being so bossy, while also giving little to no information about why I needed to listen to them?



I swallowed my guilt and said, “Do that again?”



Leano grinned and whistled the same pattern, as I traced a line along the mountain range. At the sound of the tune we were studying, the rest of the group made their way over and I held the postcard up so they could see what we were doing. Leano continued to whistle, seemingly trying to sight read the rest of the mountain range, which worked relatively well. It seemed to follow the same general tune he had been whistling before, the changes fit though, like adding another line to the chorus. 



When he finished whistling, I thought I heard a bird pick it up in the quickly darkening forest around us, but aside from that we all sat in contemplative silence for a while. 



Finally Lana said, “So the genetic memory tune… is the Appalachian mountain range?”



Marybell and Gabriel nodded, as Scott blew his light brown hair out of his eyes and said, “Well that sucks. Mystery solved I guess.”



We all turned to look at him with surprised expressions. I’ve never met a scientist who could be disappointed by new data and I think my shock must have registered in my tone as I said, “What do you mean?”



He sneered, and for a moment I hated him more than I’ve ever hated anyone before. I’m not even sure exactly where it came from, all of a sudden I just felt this deep, overwhelming hatred, and then it was gone.



He said, “Well clearly the early settlers were just making up tunes based on their surroundings. We see that with art work all the time right? Cave drawings of their surroundings, stuff like that. So some early cave dweller made up this tune, and it’s spread out through their ancestors, getting different words over the years but the tune itself is like a memory of where you came from.”



He offered another smug shrug (I suffered another surge of hatred), and Marybell said, “Just because we know where the tune came from doesn’t mean the mystery is solved. In fact, I would say the mystery is even further from solved because we have so many new questions now. New data doesn’t end the study, it gives you a new avenue to work from.”



I nodded in quiet appreciation of Marybells statement, but Scott opened his mouth as if to argue. Marybell cut him off with, “If you call yourself a scientist you should know that.”



No one else spoke, but I could sense the way the air shifted. Lana looked conflicted, Gabriel looked tired as if he just wanted Scott to be quiet so we could go back to Science (or maybe I was projecting) and Leano looked slightly amused, like he’d been waiting for someone to take Scott down a peg (I still might have been projecting). 



Scott didn’t say anything else, but he did slink over to his chair and throw himself into it, still holding the smug look on his face. I looked around the rest of the group somewhat nervously. I wanted to go back to discussing the discovery we’d made, but Scott’s smug behavior had sucked the confidence out of all of us. No one wanted to be the first to bring it up and risk more mockery.



Finally I cleared my throat and turned back to Leano, keeping my voice low to hopefully make it clear that we were having a private conversation.



I Said, “So what do you think it means?”



Leano jerked as though startled, "Sorry, again please?”



I smiled patiently and replied, “What do you think about the discovery? Why do you think the tune follows the same… rhythm as the mountains?”



He smiled back, even as a worry line formed across his brow, “That’s well said. I do have thoughts, but they… may sound strange.”



He finished this with an almost pleading look, as though he desperately wanted to share but didn’t want to be shot down again like Scott had. I gave him what I hoped was an encouraging look and said, “Go ahead, I want to hear it.”



Leano gazed off into the trees, “Well I’ve always been fascinated by the stories that go all across the world. Every people group has stories of specters, yes? There are angry or unsatisfied dead that return to the land of the living, in all cultures.”



I shivered. The way he said it managed to break the various concepts of ghosts, specters, even other “living dead” stories like zombies, into the singular universal theme they encompassed. 



I nodded my encouragement and Leano went on, “Ghosts aren’t the only example of that. The Slenderman has traveled through many, almost all cultures. The strange almost human man that lives in the darkest forests and takes away children. Where did that story originate, Samira?”



I wracked my brain, feeling like I was in the woods with my mom again being quizzed about which plants were safe and which ones weren’t.



I said, “That would be Germany, right? The American Slenderman stories were basically borrowed and then built on, from the German character der grosmann.”



Leano gave me a smile that lit up his entire face, “Yes! Der Grosmann is one of many, Samira, so many stories. It translates loosely to the Tall Man, which is a very common type of story. It can be found in American folklore, German folklore, Russian, Asian, and these stories continue to pop up all over the world.”



I held up a hand for him to stop as I pondered where he seemed to be going with this. Finally I said, “Okay, so you’re saying that there are some stories like Slenderman, that seem to pop up almost organically, right? Like with ghosts, people groups just naturally create these stories and they all seem to follow common themes.”



Leano gave me a “maybe” motion, “But Samira, are they created or discovered?”



I jumped as Lana said, “Oh, Leano that gave me chills. You’re good at telling ghost stories I bet.”



He smiled at her shyly, as I found myself looking around to see who else was listening. Marybell and Gabriel were both leaning forward with wide eyes, and entranced expressions. I just wanted everyone to shut up and stop interrupting, I felt like we were close to finding more data that could be usable, and I just wanted to focus.



I leaned forward, eyes locked with Leano, “What do you mean, discovered?”



His eyes twinkled with something that looked like mischief, “Do you believe in ghosts?” When I shook my head no he faltered, then gave me a secretive smile, “Well, neither do I. But the idea would be that because these stories pop up naturally, they are based in truth. Right? So, if every culture speaks of ghosts it stands to reason…”



He trailed off, waiting for me to finish the thought, and I gave him a mischievous smile, “That every culture has seen its people die, and every culture has a fear of the unknown beyond death. So they created stories to explain what might happen after death.”



It was Leano’s turn to shake his head no, “That is why afterlife stories exist. We created heavens and hells and reincarnation to explain what is after death. So why do ghost stories exist?”



I was stumped, but after a moment of contemplation I offered, “Maybe ghost stories exist as an alternative. You know, like the wandering Jack story. Banned from both heaven and hell, doomed to walk the material plane forever.”



Leano shrugged amicably, “Perhaps, and these are good theories.But back to the subject at hand, this musical tune. Perhaps the mountains are a mere coincidence. Or perhaps the tune was carried by something else, perhaps birds, and early settlers merely added words. Or, my personal favorite theory-” He paused dramatically and I realized that Leano probably made a great older brother. “The song may have been a warning. These things often were, they are meant to be catchy and easy to remember so children will know to be cautious.”



Something occurred to me and I blurted out, “Like the snake rhyme.”



Leano cocked his head, “I’m not familiar.”



I grimaced, “Well, I guess I’m not as familiar as I thought. I remembered it earlier but I couldn’t seem to get it right.”



He smiled, “Perhaps I can help, if you can share some of it.”



I thought back to my dream with a light shiver, “It’s something like… red and yellow something, red and black-”



Marybell cut in startling me, I had forgotten she was there, “Red on black venom lack, red on yellow kill a fellow. Right?”



I nodded, “Yes! That’s right. My mom taught me that rhyme after I almost stepped on a snake when I was a kid. I don’t think she even noticed what the snake looked like, she was just scared and usually dealt with fear by either learning or teaching.”



I glanced at Gabriel and Lana, my eyes sliding from person to person like a tongue searching for a lost tooth. Finally I realized who was missing: Scott.



I looked at Marybell, who had been sitting closest to Scott and asked, “Hey, where’d Scott go?”



Marybell glanced to her side as though he should still be there, “Oh he said he needed a second and he would be right back. I was a little too interested in your conversation though, so I didn’t realize he never came back. Until you asked, I mean.”



A chill crept down my neck and I did my best to shrug it off, “Okay, it’s dark so we should probably find him.” When no one else moved I added with a forced laugh, “Nora will give me the worst assignments for the rest of the month if I lose one of you guys.”



Everyone gave me what I could only assume was a pity chuckle as we slowly struggled to our feet. Our muscles were sore from the day's activities and everyone groaned as we became aware of the aches and pains. I had forgotten how stiff an eight mile hike could make a person.



I staggered to Scott’s tent and peeked my head in. His and Gabriel’s sleeping bags were laid out, both of their packs sat near the doorway. There was no sign that Scott had made his way back here, and it didn’t seem like he had taken any of his supplies. 



It was fully dark outside by this point, and I was honestly furious with him for wandering off by himself. I popped my head back out of the tent and nearly stumbled into Gabriel, who was standing behind me.



He said, “He’s not in there? We haven’t seen any sign of him either.”



I turned to look at the rest of the group and saw that everyone else had gone from tired and a bit annoyed, to concerned. I gestured for Gabriel to follow me as I fetched the flashlight from my bag and went back to the group.



I got everyone’s attention and said, “Alright guys, grab your flashlights and let’s go look for Scott.”



Lana scuffed her foot nervously against the earth, “Are we splitting up?”



Gabriel, Marybell and I replied at the same time, “Absolutely not.”



Lana sighed in relief, and I felt the energy of the group shift again. From fear and unrest to a general sense of togetherness. 



We made our way into the woods, and it occurred to me for a brief moment that splitting up would let us cover more ground, but I remembered what my mom had said: *Don'*t *test the wilderness.* Splitting us up felt a lot like testing the wilderness, keeping the group together seemed to make a lot more sense, even if it did mean covering less ground.



We walked through the darkness all the way back to the lake, calling for Scott the entire time. When we didn’t find him, we went back to camp, following rabbit trails through the woods as we called out increasingly frustrated summons.



“Scott, where are you?”



“Scott! Scream if you can hear us!”



“Scott! Olly olly oxen free!”



(That was Gabriel, I have no idea what that means.)



“Scott! Come on man!”



“Scott, get out here before we make you sleep outside!”



And me: “Scott, I’m going to tell Nora on you!”



On and on, we called out for him as we tumbled exhausted through the woods. Finally after several hours we made our way back to camp, asked Gabriel to let us know if Scott appeared in the middle of the night, and then went to our separate tents. 



We figured we could call rangers or the police in the morning if he didn’t appear. At the time no one really thought he was hurt. In the lab, Scott was the kind of guy who would unplug your equipment if you made him mad, he even once stole one of my samples just to get back at me for something. He returned it quickly of course, but my point is that Scott is… kind of a dick. We all just assumed he was being a jerk and hiding. I snuggled down in my sleeping bag, turned off my flashlight, and closed my eyes.



As I was drifting off I could have sworn I heard whistling, swooping through the trees in a familiar tone.
