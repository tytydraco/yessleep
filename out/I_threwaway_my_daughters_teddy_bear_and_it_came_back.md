Hi everyone,
I don’t usually post, but I need help. I’m seriously starting to think something’s wrong — with our house, or maybe with me. I don’t even know anymore.

I’m a single parent. My daughter is six. We moved into a small rental house about two months ago — older place, creaky floors, nothing fancy, but quiet and cheap. She loved it right away. Especially her bedroom.

She has this stuffed teddy bear she’s had since she was two. She takes it everywhere. It’s old, worn down, one eye a little loose, but she refuses to sleep without it.

It was just a normal toy — until a few weeks ago.

One night, she came into my room around 2 a.m. and said, “He was talking again.”

I asked who, and she said the bear. I thought she was dreaming. She said, “He doesn’t like this house.”

I tucked her back in, told her she was safe, and went back to bed.

A few nights later, she came back again. “He said you were listening,” she whispered.

That one made me pause. But I still figured she was imagining things.

Then weird stuff started happening.

Sometimes I’d pass by her room at night and hear whispering — two voices, low and quiet. When I opened the door, she’d be asleep. The bear would be in her arms, turned toward her face.

I thought maybe she was talking in her sleep. But then I started finding the bear in strange places.

One morning, it was sitting upright on her dresser, facing the bed. Another time, it was on the floor by the doorway — positioned perfectly, like it was waiting.

She swore she didn’t move it.

I even tested her once. I put the bear on the top shelf of her closet before bedtime, where she couldn’t reach it. At around 3 a.m., I woke up to a soft thud. When I checked, it was back in her bed.

She was sound asleep.

The next morning, I asked her about it. She got quiet and said, “He doesn’t like being up there. He gets lonely.”

I laughed it off, but she didn’t smile. She just said, “You shouldn’t touch him.”

Something about the way she said that — calm, flat — got under my skin.
That night, I stayed up late. Around 3 a.m., I heard this faint shuffling sound from her room. I peeked in, and the bear was sitting up, not in her arms, just next to her. Propped up. Staring toward the door.

I stood there for a long time trying to convince myself it was just her moving in her sleep.

The next day, I checked the bear. It’s just fabric and stuffing — no electronics, no batteries. But when I held it, it felt heavier than it should.

I almost cut it open, just to see, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

That night, she woke me again. This time, she was holding the bear by one arm and said, “He wants to talk to you.”

I said, “What do you mean?”

She lifted it up toward me and whispered, “Say hi.”

I told her to go back to bed. She frowned and said, “You made him mad.”

I took the bear after she fell asleep and put it in the closet.

Around 3 a.m., I heard something fall. I ran in — the closet door was open, and the bear was lying halfway out.

She was still asleep.

The next morning, she had dark circles under her eyes. I asked if she was okay, and she said, “He doesn’t like the closet. He said you should apologize.”

I didn’t know what to say to that.

That evening, I caught her sitting on the floor, holding the bear, whispering. I asked what she was doing, and she said, “Listening.”

I said, “Listening to what?”

She said, “He’s telling me about before.”

“Before what?”

She didn’t answer.

Later that night, I was on the couch when I heard her bedroom door creak open. When I looked, the bear was in the hallway, sitting upright, facing my room.
She was asleep.

I threw it in the kitchen trash.

The next morning, she couldn’t find it and started screaming. “You shouldn’t have done that,” she cried. “He’s going to be mad!”

I told her it was gone. She stared at me, totally calm, and said, “He’s not gone. He told me he’s coming back.”

I took out the trash right then. Watched the garbage truck pick it up the next morning.

That night, I woke up around 3:10 a.m. to the sound of something soft hitting the floor. When I turned on the light, the bear was sitting at the foot of my bed.

Its fur was damp.

I grabbed it, shoved it in a garbage bag, and locked it in my car trunk. The next morning, I drove to the dump and got rid of it myself. I made sure it was gone.
For a few days, everything felt normal again.

Until last night.

I woke up to her laughing — not playfully, but this quiet, muffled giggle. I went into her room, and she was sitting up in bed, facing the wall.

I asked what she was doing, and she said, “Playing with [Name].”

I froze. “Sweetie, remember? [Name] is gone.”

She smiled — this slow, sleepy grin — and said, “He came back. He missed me.”
There was nothing in her hands. Nothing on the bed. But the air felt cold.

She turned toward the empty space beside her and whispered, “See? I told you he’d find us.”

I didn’t sleep after that. I checked every inch of the house, even the car. The bear is gone. Physically gone.

But this morning, when I went to wake her up, there were faint paw prints across her blanket.

And her window was open.

She’s been quiet all day. Just humming to herself and talking under her breath. I tried to record her once, but when I played it back, there was static — and under it, this low, slow breathing that didn’t sound like her.

I deleted it.

Tonight, I told her we might go stay with [Name] (my sister) for a bit. She didn’t even look at me. She just said, “You can go. He doesn’t want you here anymore.”
Then she rolled over and went to sleep.
It’s 3:07 a.m. right now. I can hear soft footsteps in the hallway.

Her door just creaked.

I don’t know if I should go in there.
I keep telling myself it’s her. That she’s just awake and moving around. But part of me knows what I’ll see if I open that door.

I don’t know what to do.

If anyone’s ever experienced anything like this — if you know how to make it stop — please tell me.

Because I think [Name] is back.

And I think this time, he isn’t just here for her.
