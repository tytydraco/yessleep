*Ping.*  
I ducked low in my canoe, as another bullet whizzed past me, and impacted on the side of the old coal barge.  
Floating around the stern, I paddled toward the opposite side, even as flashes of gunfire cut through the darkness all around. Night had come fast in the fifteen minutes it took me to reach the meeting point, and already the sun had sunk low behind the ridge. Long, eerie shadows crept over the water, and the barge loomed in the dying light, its red and black paint spotted with rust, the bow stuck into the nearby shore. Mold and algae had grown up the lower sides of the hull, and just under the water at the stern, I could glimpse the enormous propellors covered in tangled watergrass. Such a wreck would have driven Matt and Carla crazy had they still been part of my life, but I was too busy listening to every shot that sang into the night to bother with such thoughts.  
*What they heck are they shooting at? That’s way too many bullets for Jamie or Chris. Did they find some more poor civilians to kidnap?*  
My little craft pierced the veil of tall weeds along the shore, and I scrambled to get out of sight.  
Cinching the rolled-up wool blanket to the underside of my backpack, I slung it onto my shoulders, and jumped out onto the weedy bank beside the barge. I couldn’t see anyone yet, but there were shouts and gunshots coming from all directions, and lead slapped the rusted barge in whiny ricochets. With my Type-9 close in hand, I kept my head down, and wove through the prickly foliage, scanning the woods around me for people.  
*Snap.*  
I ducked out of instinct, the bullet sailing right past my head.  
*Snap, Snap.*  
Two more danced into the dirt beside my feet, and I ran in a haphazard zigzag to the nearest fallen log, heart thudding against my ribs. I could barely see anything with the sun fading away, but it would have been suicide to turn on my headlamp, as that would be a sure-fire way to get shot in the face.  
Someone screamed in pain nearby, and a cacophony of gunfire roared in reply, flashes sparkling in the trees. Fear snaked through my mind, and I forced myself to breathe slow, hands trembling on my submachine gun.  
*Get to the pirates. If they’re here, they’ll want their box. Get to them, find Chris and Jamie, and make a run for it.*  
Sucking in a deep gulp of fresh air, I lunged from behind my cover, and crashed through the underbrush at top speed.  
Lead ripped apart the leaves around me, some rounds coming close enough that I felt the air move as they passed my skin. Briars stuck through the legs of my pants, and the stale scent nervous sweat floated up from my shirt collar. My mad dash got me to the prow of the barge, and I rounded the corner to slide down behind a massive tree stump.  
Shouts echoed closer, so I clawed one of the grenades I’d taken off the dead soldier from my pocket, yanked the gritty pin out, and heaved it in the direction of the forest.  
*Ku-whump.*  
Crumples of earth rained down, and I poked up head up like a gopher to peer at what lay ahead.  
Dozens of gray-uniformed soldiers huddled behind trees, stumps, and fallen logs, shooting into the forest with their machine guns. Four armored trucks made up the wall of their crude barricade, one burning with great pillars of black smoke, the others under constant rifle fire. Next to them, the pirates let loose as well, and the *Harper’s Vengeance* sat just on the other side of the stranded barge, its portside cannons belching smoke with deafening shots. Geysers of dirt went up every time the cannons roared, trees falling, and a few brush fires burst to life. I couldn’t see who they were shooting at, but no freaks charged from the trees, and the flashes that responded from inside the forest told me they were human.  
*Rangers?*  
Hope swelled in my chest, and I debated what to do. If our people had in fact found us, then it would be smart to run to them, and help overwhelm ELSAR to rescue Jamie and Chris. On the other hand, the pirates could turn and escape out to sea, taking my friends with them. If I betrayed their trust, the others were as good as dead.  
A flicker of movement caught my eye, and several objects sailed through the air to land amongst the small perimeter of ELSAR troops.  
“Down!” One of the men screamed, and they all scattered for cover. “Everyone dow—”  
*Boom-boom-boom.*  
Several detonations rocked the small clearing, but with less concussive force, and more ashy smoke. Men screamed, and dozens of what sounded like pebbles clattered against the stump I hid behind. Smoke covered everything, blocked all view of the trees, and cast a dingy pall over the shoreline.  
If I wanted a chance to move unnoticed, this might be the best I could hope for.  
I rose to dart from behind my cover, and my eyes locked onto an array of red spines imbedded into the stump. They hadn’t been there a few moments earlier, and something about their haphazard pattern told me that they’d come from the fog, like a strange, organic form of shrapnel.  
Jets of orange and yellow arched into the sky from the dense trees, and I stared in horror at the cloud of fiery pinpricks that rained down.  
*Run you stupid fool.*  
My legs came alive, and I sprinted past the coughing soldiers. They lay helter-skelter, with red spines stuck in their skin, their clothes, the flesh swelling angry purple around the objects, a few wounds leaking milky pus as if they’d become infected in a matter of seconds. Pitiful screams wailed from the wounded pirates, and a part of me felt sorry for the children. Bullets flew everywhere, and the uninjured combatants fired into the fog with all their fury, unable to see a thing.  
I dodged a few shots directed my way, heart threatening to jump from my chest, and crouched next to a large chunk of limestone.  
*Bawoo-bawoo.*  
Somewhere in the forest, a strange horn splatted with primitive triumph, and a multitude of human voices roared all around the beach. There were hundreds of them it seemed, and something in my guts twisted with dread.  
Those weren’t our people.  
There were too many.  
Arrows slammed into the soil from the barrage above, their fiery tips lighting dry grass as they went, and flames roiled across the beachhead. The pirates ran for their longboats, the soldiers spread too thin to stop them, and everything descended into absolute bedlam. Burned gunpowder hung on the wind, salty and sour, the horrific cries of the dying enough to curdle my blood, and I could taste soot on my tongue.  
Unable to make a break through the carnage, I wove around the outer edge behind a clump of trees, and made for what looked to be a quiet section of the battlefield.  
A figure appeared through the fog, all dressed in gray tactical gear, and before I could hide, he spotted me.  
His M4 came up, the barrel pointed right at my chest.  
My training took over, and I jerked the submachine gun to my shoulder in a blind reflex.  
*Brat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat!*  
The soldier got off a single shot before my fusillade struck him, his bullet clipping a leaf by my right shoulder, and he stumbled backward into a tree. I heard him grunt in pain, and the man collapsed.  
All at once, a mortified realization seized me, and I stopped dead in my tracks.  
*I just shot someone.*  
Both arms trembled like noodles, a little curl of smoke rose in front of my eyes from the muzzle of my gun, and I edged closer in timid, tip-toe steps.  
He lay with his back to a small sapling, crimson blood spattered on the bark. Round holes marked where the bullets climbed up his right leg, shattered his hip, and stitched their way to his throat across the armored vest he wore. The man looked to be around 30 or so, with a brownish-red curly beard, burly arms, and chocolate-colored eyes. A tattoo peeked from under one of his rolled uniform sleeves, and the words Rangers lead the way made my intestines churn in remorse. His rifle lay by his side, but the hand that still grasped it was a mass of scarlet, another bullet hole near his right elbow. The pale flesh around his neck twitched near the ragged trench dug into the side of it by my last shot, and he pressed his opposite hand to it, both watery eyes fixed on me in shock.  
The Type-9 weighed heavy in my hands, and I ground my teeth together, steeling myself enough to sight in on his reddened face. This man was our enemy, one of the mercenaries who had killed our people. Because of men like him, Jamie’s brother was dead, and Matta and Carla could be as well. This was *his* fault.  
Our eyes met, his coated with a veneer of pain, and my finger refused to move on the trigger.  
*He kinda looks like Dad. Maybe he is a dad? What if he’s got a wife and kid somewhere, counting on him, waiting for him to come home and now . . .*  
Regret knotted in my chest, and I dropped my gun to paw at the medical pouch on my belt. “I’m sorry!”  
Crouching down, I ripped open the plastic package for my field bandage, and pressed the soft, white gauze to the hole in the man’s neck.  
He didn’t fight, merely stared at me in surprise, and something like sympathy crawled over his rugged face. The man tried to say something, his jaw moved, but he could only gasp in muffled groans.  
“I’m so sorry.” I whimpered, and wracked my brain for a solution, as the blood ran hot between my fingers, too much too fast. Jamie had taught me basic first aid, but what could I do for a bullet to someone’s throat?  
Turning, I scanned the smoke, and cursed my luck. The battle raged on, shots flying all around us, but we were too far into the brush to be seen. “Medic! Someone help us! Please, we need help over here!”  
Clammy fingers touched my face, and I whirled in fright to find him watching me.  
The soldier patted my cheek with a cold, blood-covered hand, and a tiny smile crossed his gray-tinged face. Both brown eyes started to glaze over, and for a moment, he acted as though he recognized me, a few hoarse words choking through the blood.  
“Kat . . . Kat, what . . . what are you doing . . .”  
*He’s hallucinating. Oh God, is he going to die? No, he can’t die, I don’t want him to, I didn’t mean to do this.*  
Guilt rammed into my heart like a runaway train, and I held his hand, felt the warmth leaving it. “It’s okay. Someone’s going to come soon, you’ll see. Just stay with me, alright?”  
All at once, his eyes went dark in alarm, and the soldier frowned.  
He twitched, tugged at my shirt front as if to struggle, and gurgled an attempt at words over and over again, but to no avail.  
“No, it’s okay.” I shook my head so hard the ends of my tangled hair whipped in my face. “I’m not going to hurt you, I promise. Just stay still, stay still or you’re going to—”  
But the man’s face contorted into a fierce snarl and he balled his fist up in the cloth of my polo shirt, sending terror through me. Would I have to kill him? I didn’t want to; I wanted a team of medics to magically appear through the fog of war and swoop him up to safety. I wanted to get the chance to explain to him that it was an accident, that I was scared, that I never meant to hurt anyone.  
I wanted to fix what I’d done.  
The soldier yanked at my shirt, and the force of his pull made me lose my grip on the bandage over his throat, more red streams spurting out.  
With all my strength, I did my best to press him against the tree, to keep him still so he wouldn’t hurt himself more. “Stop, I’m trying to—”  
“*Move!*” A deep grunt burst from his tattered esophagus, and the man seemed to find new strength, hurling me to the side like a paper doll.  
In the dim twilight, I watched his hand streak for a pistol on his belt, and my eyes screwed shut in anticipation. He was going to shoot me, all because I didn’t have the stomach to do what was necessary. Jamie would have done the right thing and put him out of his misery. Chris would have too. I’d been a weak-willed moron, and now I would die for it, my own weapon lying in the dirt behind me.  
*Bang, bang, bang.*  
I cringed, ready for the life to seep out of me.  
A shrill cry of pain cut through the cacophony of war, and something landed on the ground behind me with a dense *thud*.  
My eyes flew open, and I rolled over.  
Not ten yards away, a figure gasped in short breaths of pain, clutching at the front of her plate carrier where the armor caught the rounds. Her helmet had come loose to reveal brown hair like mine balled up in a ponytail, and another M4 lay where she’d dropped it. A green shield-shaped badge rested on one shoulder, and despite the tactical gear, the girl didn’t appear to be much older than myself.  
She wheezed, and pushed herself up on all fours, a gleaming black combat knife resting amongst the weeds.  
*Oh.*  
I looked back at the wounded man, and saw his vacant eyes staring far, far away, his body limp against the tree, the smoking pistol in his hand.  
“*Fall back! All units, fall back to the trucks! We’re pulling out!*” A panicked voice blasted through the radio on her gear, and the girl stumbled to her feet. We locked eyes, and despite the darkness, I couldn’t help but see the raw hatred there, a visceral rage that seethed like black fire in her gaze.  
With one hand still pressed to her armor plate, likely over a few cracked ribs, she reached for her rifle.  
A low rumble broke through the night, dozens upon dozens of feet stampeding closer in the underbrush, and another bullet snapped between us.  
I lunged for my submachine gun, fear thick in my brain.  
Cold steel met my palms, but by the time I looked up, nothing stood in front of me save for swirling clouds of smoke.  
*Bawoo-bawoo.*  
Through the trees, floating blobs of green light thundered toward me, a huge line of what looked like branches lunging through the vegetation.  
No, not branches.  
Antlers.  
A wall of blurry shapes tore through the tree line and charged into the smoky beachhead, filled with the grunts of animals, and shrill war cries in strange words I didn’t recognize. Flaming arrows ripped apart the air, and the firelight reflected on overlapping plates of iron. Soldiers and pirates fell as the shadows caught up to them, and the sound of gunfire began to be replaced by the bone-chilling echo of metal-on-metal.  
I ran as fast as I could toward the water, but the shapes were faster, and flooded by, in a sea of vibration and noise. The *Harper’s Vengeance* wheeled around to sail for the safety of deep water, more fleeing longboats trailing in its wake. A few of the armored trucks revved their motors and drove off with the rest of the soldiers, leaving two wrecks in flames. Shadows took over the field, too many of them between me, and the water.   
Too many to get past.  
I’d lost my chance, and now, the murky things were everywhere, cheering like banshees in the gloom.  
*What are they, what are they, what are—*  
*Boom.*  
A stray cannon shot landed a few yards away, the shell explosion throwing me to the ground. My ears trilled with incessant whines, and the air rained dirt over my face. The world grew muffled for a few moments, and it seemed as though a giant hand pressed me to the ground.  
Coughing, I curled into a ball to avoid being trampled. I no longer thought of Chris, Jamie, or even the dead soldier who had saved my life. The primal switch in my brain reactivated, and once again, I searched desperately for an escape route as more figures galloped past.  
“Unus est!” One of the shadows spotted me, and the glowing green antlers trotted closer, another foreign voice calling to its brethren in words I couldn’t understand.  
The subconscious weight lifted, and I struggled to find my weapon in the morass of weeds and canvas straps that entangled me.  
*If I can get back to my canoe, I can follow the ship.*  
Stubby iron sights rose into my field of vision, but a sudden jerk tore the gun from my hands, and an arrow clattered to my feet.  
“Aspice hunc, Herculem putat.” A gruff voice chuckled from somewhere behind me, and others laughed as well, as if whatever had been said was amusing.  
Scuttling backward on all fours, I yanked the knife from my war belt, and swallowed my fear. This was it then. It was my turn to bleed, my turn to die.  
Five of the shadows circled me, and as they did, they came close enough I could start to make out details. Riveted plates of metal clinked against one another, leather flaps holding them in place. Glowing like jade stars, the antlers led to a head with the boney protrusion on the front of the skull layered in steel plates. Hooves denoted a deer, but these deer seemed larger, stronger, and more fleshed-out than the glowing ones we’d seen around New Wilderness, easily as tall as a draft horse. They snorted, pawed at the ground, and the taut muscles in their limbs beneath the armor rippled with desire to run.  
Astride each stag’s back, brown leather saddles held upright figures, with black rifles in their hands, all pointed at me. Painted sheets of iron scales covered every inch of their bodies, shaded green, brown, and gray to match the forest. At their sides hung curved bows with quivers full of arrows, and conical helmets topped with tufts of brown fur adorned their heads. Their faces bore rigid masks shaped with eerie similarity to Puppet smiles, the eye slits painted an off-white, the breath holes overlaid with a mural of a wooden smile. Long swords dangled by their opposite hips, not curved like the pirates’ but straight, with cross-shaped hilts. Round shields bounced on their backs, knee-high boots on their feet, not a sneaker or T-shirt anywhere to be seen. It would have all fit much better in some Renaissance festival somewhere, if not for the automatic rifles that rested in their hands, or the assorted handguns and spare magazines in pouches on their belts.  
Flexing my fingers on my knife, I dug my teeth into my lower lip, and squared up like Jamie had taught me in the boxing ring, as one of the riders dismounted across the circle from where I stood.  
The armored figure slung its M4 over one shoulder, and drew the broadsword from its belt, a man’s tone echoing through the layers of steel. “The knife. Drop it. *Now*.”  
*I’m not going to make this easy for you.*  
“Leave me alone.” I snarled back with the most aggressive voice I could muster and tried to decide how to stab at my metal-clad assailant.  
*Whack.*  
Sharp pain flared in the back of my head, as something hard hit me from behind.  
I fell to my knees, but kept hold of my knife, not about to die helpless and pleading.  
“Hoc unum contumax est. Cave, Aleph.” A female voice spoke from one of the onlookers, and she hefted the butt of her rifle that she’d just used to smack me in the head.  
A long steel blade swung at my face, and I dove to avoid it, heart racing. I was completely outmatched here. Boxing had been my worst skill set thus far, all I had was a stubby knife, and nothing in the way of armor. I couldn’t escape the circle, not with all those guns trained on me. One lucky strike, and my opponent would open me up like a Christmas goose.  
*Come on Hannah, you can’t die now. If you can’t get away from him, try to get close. Maybe you can stab him in the eye or something.*  
I tried a feint with my right, which held the knife, but the man didn’t fall for it.  
His blade flashed toward my mid-section again, and I barely slid out of the path of it, lashing out in desperation.  
My blade clanked harmlessly off his shoulder armor without so much as leaving a dent.  
*Slam.*  
Pain ripped through my temple, as an armored elbow connected to the side of my head, and stars appeared before my eyes.  
Both feet buckled, and I went down onto all fours, groaning in pain.   
*Man, that hurt.*  
“Jam satis.” Another male voice barked from the onlookers, and this seemed to stay my attacker’s hand. “Hoc unum absolutum est. Pater Adam nullam crudelitatem dixit.”  
More feet stumped over to me, and the knife was jerked from my grasp. Just as fast as it had begun, my resistance was quashed, and I found myself a humiliated prisoner once more. They unbuckled my chest rig, along with my war belt, and one of them scooped up my Type-9 with curious hands. Rope tightened over my wrists, and a dark bag was drawn over my head.  
They rummaged through my pockets with hurried, rough fingers, and one of them cut the straps of my backpack to pull it from my shoulders.  
“No!” I thrashed against their strong hands, panicked tears in my eyes that they couldn’t see. “That’s mine, give it back! Please, I need it, give it back, please!”  
But the strangers didn’t reply, and instead hoisted me up until I felt fur and a bony spine under my legs, more rope tying me upright. High-pitched war cries echoed through the night, the gunfire began to slacken, and the rattle of hoofbeats swelled into a horde.   
The world lurched in a bumpy gait underneath me as my captors rode off into the dense trees, taking me further and further from Chris, Jamie, and my only route home.
