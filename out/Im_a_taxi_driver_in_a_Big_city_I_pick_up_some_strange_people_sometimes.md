I should start by saying that most people I pick up are overwhelmingly normal. A few drunk guys, some college students too tired to walk, young adults off to another bar or club, but every now and again I find myself driving around with some real oddities. I guess you can say that’s the product of Big City, but I shudder to imagine this could be normal anywhere else. I’m also not going to tell you where Big City is, just know it’s a big city with lots of people.

&#x200B;

Here, this first guy will be a good example. It was a normal night, around 11pm or so when I spot a guy on the sidewalk waving me down. He’s dressed in a formal looking suit with slicked back hair and an expensive looking watch on his wrist. Definitely not the usual attire of somebody who needs a taxi, but I’m not in the business of making judgments.

&#x200B;

“Hey, how are ya?” I said.

&#x200B;

“It’s been a pleasant evening so far, and you?” He said while ducking into the back seat.

&#x200B;

“I can't complain. Where ya headed?” I said.

&#x200B;

“I’ll be staying at the Grand Yhatt Inn this evening sir! I’d be delighted if you would take me there.” He said with a smile full of grandeur.

&#x200B;

“You got it” I said.

&#x200B;

I flipped off my taxi light and started my tally, I didn’t need the directions as this was a very popular destination around here.

&#x200B;

“That’s a nice looking suit” I said.

&#x200B;

“You have a sharp eye there Mr…?” He said.

&#x200B;

“Call me driver” I said.

&#x200B;

“Ha, alright Mr. Driver, you’d be correct this is a nice suit, and someone with keen eyes like yours might also have asked yourself why a man such as myself would be taking a taxi when he clearly has stature for someone who owns a personal car and driver?” He exclaimed.

&#x200B;

His arrogance kinda pissed me off but after 13 years of driving this taxi one thing I’ve learned is how to stomach anger.

&#x200B;

“It’s because I’m an inventor dear driver, and though my driving personnel are reliable wheelmen, they’re shitty confidants. I must keep my invention away from those in positions to steal it.” He continued.

&#x200B;

“Ahh, gotcha, so you must have invented something pretty great then huh?” I asked.

&#x200B;

A smirk grows on his face. He ducks down behind my seat and pulls out a small black box, then puts on a black glove. He flips open the lid and turns it around, revealing what looked like a small metal ball bearing.

&#x200B;

“You invented a ball bearing? Hate to break it to you but that’s already been invented” I said.

&#x200B;

He scoffed dramatically before picking it up and holding it close to my head.

&#x200B;

“This here is… well to put it extremely primitively, this is an amalgamation of rare earth elements with very unique reactionary tendencies to almost all physical objects!” He said.

&#x200B;

He flips the ball into the air and catches it in his palm.

&#x200B;

“If I were to drop this ball right here in your car it would eat straight through the floor in seconds, then pass right through the pavement and into the crust of the earth. Not even the earths core would be able to stop it, not until it hit the center of gravity where it would remain forever. The only reason I can handle it now is because I’ve put on my control glove, along with the my container. They’re made of another rare earth element resistant to this ball’s properties, so rare in fact that there isn’t enough of it left on earth to make a second glove!” He said.

&#x200B;

“Hey man, I’m not sure I understand but please don’t toss that thing around in my car while I’m driving” I said.

&#x200B;

He frowned at me, like he was dissatisfied with my response. He puts the small metal ball back into its box.

&#x200B;

“I don’t think you appreciate the greatness of this invention Mr. Driver. Something like this could revolutionize industries all over the world! This one object alone breaks multiple laws of thermodynamics as we know it. The creation of this object could mean that the laws of nature so sternly placed by god himself could be bent to my will!” He said.

&#x200B;

“Alright alright, I get it, just calm down there friend I didn’t mean to insult your invention” I said.

&#x200B;

He takes a deep breath and seems to relax a bit.

&#x200B;

“Apologies Mr. Driver, I didn’t mean to become excitable, but to satiate your concerns you should be aware that I will not drop this invention, I could not be so crass.” He said.

&#x200B;

“It’s fine, we’ll be arriving at your destination here shortly.” I said.

&#x200B;

“Excellent, but I must insist of you Mr. Driver, do not tell anyone about this, I trust that this will suffice for keeping your silence” he said.

&#x200B;

He hands me a fancy clip of cash, all hundreds.

&#x200B;

“Yes sir, that will do nicely, and if any of your other rich friends need a ride let me know. I’d be glad to take them” I said.

&#x200B;

He laughed as he stepped out of my cab, I promised one last time I wouldn’t say a thing and he walks into the hotel lobby. Now I know what you must be thinking, clearly I did not keep his promise based on the fact you’re reading this right now, but as you’re about to read it doesn’t really matter.

&#x200B;

About 2 days after I dropped him off there was a headline in the local newspaper about a mysterious murder in the Grand Yhatt hotel. A man with no ID and a fancy suit was found shot in his hotel room bed. The door was locked from the inside and no casings could be found. The bullet managed to pass through the floor of his room and the police can’t find it. My guess is he was ogling his invention and accidentally dropped it on himself. I felt bad for him honestly, his invention absolutely worked. One little mistake was all it took to destroy both the invention and the inventor in one foul swoop. That ball is probably on its way to the core of the earth by now, I just hope it doesn’t do anything disastrous when it gets there.

&#x200B;

Not every encounter ends up being so whimsical though. Not that his death was anything funny but you can’t say he didn’t have it coming throwing that thing around like that. The next story I want to share was far darker. I still think about it late at night.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I like to take unusual roads around town when it’s been a slow night. It’s risky for sure since it’s not the nicest side of town, but I’ve built up sort of a small reputation around here as the cabby who doesn’t ask questions and drug dealers tip big for silence. Doesn’t make me feel great but it puts food on the table and I have a daughter to put through college some day, so there I was. This girl stepped out in front of my car out of nowhere, she was about late twenties, had straight brown hair and fair skin, definitely not the kind of girl that should be slumming it up with the prostitutes and crackheads, which is why my heart sank when I saw how torn up and bloody her clothes were.

&#x200B;

This was the scenario I dreaded the most when coming down this way, honestly I’d rather be shot and robbed then have to look into the eyes of some young girl who’s life is now ruined. It breaks my dad heart. She just stood there crying in front of my car so I ushered her into the back of my cab and just started driving on instinct to the hospital.

&#x200B;

“Thank you! *\*sniff\** Thank you so much for stopping” she said, barely keeping it together.

&#x200B;

“What happened? Are you ok?” I said.

&#x200B;

She lifted her knees to her chest and hugged them.

&#x200B;

“I was at a bar and then… I… I don’t know! I don’t remember anything but my head hurts and I woke up in the alley and… and…” she said.

&#x200B;

She just breaks down. Dribbling and crying into her knees.

&#x200B;

“It’s ok, it’s ok, you’re safe now alright? I’m gunna take you to the hospital to get you checked out ok?” I said.

&#x200B;

She looks up from her lap and nods slightly.

&#x200B;

What’s your name?” I said.

&#x200B;

“Emily” she said.

&#x200B;

“Ok Emily, do you know who did this to you?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“No, no… I just… I don’t know anything! I can’t remember anything!” She screamed.

&#x200B;

“Hey it’s ok, don’t focus on that now alright? Was anyone around when you woke up or were you alone?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“No one was there, I was just laying there in the alleyway and… and…” she said.

&#x200B;

I felt my heart beat in my temples, I was just so mad I swear whoever did this to her probably felt a shiver.

&#x200B;

“It’s alright, you’re safe now I won’t let anyone hurt you, just hang in there we’re about 10 minutes from the hospital” I said.

&#x200B;

“Thank you… *\*sniff\** I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t-” she suddenly stopped.

&#x200B;

She just stopped crying instantly, put both her legs back down onto the floor of the car and carefully placed her hands in her lap.

&#x200B;

“I’m ok now, there’s no need to take me to the hospital” she said in a perfectly calm voice.

&#x200B;

“Wha- What?” I said.

&#x200B;

“I’m perfectly ok, I was just overreacting to a minor situation. Instead I would like you to deliver me to this address.” She said, handing me a small piece of paper.

&#x200B;

I could hardly believe what I was hearing. This girl had completely changed her entire demeanor in an instant. I really didn’t know what to say, but I definitely was not taking her to that address.

&#x200B;

“I must return to my home, please take me there at once. You will be paid handsomely for this service.” she said.

&#x200B;

“Look, this trip is going to be free of charge ok? Just let me take you to the hospital to at least have them check you out, I wanna make sure you’re not hurt alright?” I said.

&#x200B;

“I demand to be dropped off at that address, you’re a cab driver are you not? You take people to where they want to go.” She said.

&#x200B;

“What the hell is the matter with you? Snap out of it!” I said.

&#x200B;

“You will drop me off at this address or I will contact the police and report you for theft.” She said.

&#x200B;

“I am *not* taking you anywhere but the hospital lady, and if that means you’re going to call the cops on me then so be it!” I said.

&#x200B;

“Fine, if you will not take me home then I will walk there myself.” She said.

&#x200B;

Then she opened the car door while I was diving on the freeway and just stepped out. I was going fast too, over the speed limit. The sound it made as she was sucked out of the back of my cab still wakes me up at night sometimes.

&#x200B;

She was killed instantly, which for all I know could have been a mercy. The ambulance had to practically scrape what was left of her off the road. I got brought in for questioning by the police but the interior camera I installed cleared me of any wrongdoing. For the most part it seemed like the they felt bad for me so I didn’t spend that much time there. The cops ended up going to the address she gave me and found nothing but an empty lot, other than that I haven’t heard anything about the situation since.

&#x200B;

I was pretty destroyed by the whole thing. One thing she said stuck out to me as particularly odd though. When she mentioned calling the cops she said she was going to report me for theft, not kidnapping. I don’t know what could have happened to her before I found her, but I’m glad I never took her to that address. I went home from the police station that night, hugged my daughter and cried a bit. I try not to bring home the crazy shit I see at work but that one hit too close to heart.

&#x200B;

That interior camera is a life saver by the way. It’s actually how I’ve been able to recreate the conversations so well thus far. I know what you’re gunna say, don’t ask because I’m not going to show you any of the footage, it has my face and car interior on it and I don’t want you to see that. I’ve already said some shit that might get me fired and I won’t take that risk.

&#x200B;

In this last story I’m gunna tell, that interior camera probably saved my life. I’ll let the story speak for itself but perhaps this can serve as an example to all you cabbies out there. Get yourself some video evidence.

&#x200B;

It was a pretty slow day for the most part, when it gets rainy a lot of people just stay where they’re at and don’t need a cab. This one old fellow waved me down from the underside of an apartment awning so I stopped to pick him up. He looked to be in his 70’s to 80’s, he walked slow so I helped him into the back seat. He thanked me with a really sweet smile and told me he wanted to go to the Big City bridge, so off we went.

&#x200B;

“It’s beautiful weather for a walk don’t you think?” He said.

&#x200B;

“I can’t say I agree old timer, I’m more of a summer guy myself, the cold fall weather chills me to the bone” I said.

&#x200B;

“Bah! It’s the cold that really makes you feel alive!” He said.

&#x200B;

We talked about the weather and other trivial things until we made it to the bridge. Not a thing was odd about him, just a friendly old man. He paid his fee, tipped his hat, and slowly walked off towards the bridge. That was that last time I ever saw him.

&#x200B;

When I stopped at the bridge, another person ran up to the side of my cab and asked for a ride, so I let him in. He was a younger guy, maybe twenties, in good shape, and was meeting up with his girlfriend for lunch at a popular restaurant around here. I started a new tally and off we went.

&#x200B;

About 5 minutes after we left the bridge the kid in the back lifts something up into his hand.

&#x200B;

“What’s this?” He said.

&#x200B;

“Don’t know, looks like some kind of little statue, where’d you find that?” I said.

&#x200B;

“I was here under the edge of your seat. Awe man! I think that old guy must have left this in your cab. We should turn back we might still catch him.” He said.

&#x200B;

I let out a big sigh.

&#x200B;

“You’re probably right, don’t worry kid I won’t add this to your tally, we’ll find him” I said.

&#x200B;

With that I turned the cab around and started heading back the way we came.

&#x200B;

“This things weird, kinda old and creepy. Maybe it’s some family heirloom or something.” He said.

&#x200B;

“Just don’t break it alright? Who knows what’s valuable these days.” I said.

&#x200B;

“I won’t I won’t. There’s this weird inscription on the side of it. It says…”

&#x200B;

Now I’d try and describe what he said next but I really don’t have any idea, it was pretty much gibberish. I ran it through a few language detection sites and all of them come up empty. He also stammered through the whole thing which I guess makes sense when you’re reading a nonsensical language. After reading the whole thing he gets this weird look on his face. Then he just started screaming.

&#x200B;

“GET OUT OF MY HEAD AAAAUT OF MY HEEAAD GET IT OUT OF MY HE-“ he screamed, then went limp.

&#x200B;

I slammed on the breaks and turned to face him.

&#x200B;

“JESUS kid what the fuck? Hey! Hey, are you ok?” I said.

&#x200B;

He sits up, looks me dead in the eye and gives me a huge sinister grin.

&#x200B;

“Oh I’m more than alright friend, but no more questions alright? You will now drive silently to a nice lot on Middleton street yes?” He said.

&#x200B;

He makes some kind of hand motion and I got completely silent. I faced the road with an empty look on my face and just drove.

&#x200B;

“That’s better, don’t worry I don’t have plans to kill you right now, I mean I’m still in the car right? Haha!” He said.

&#x200B;

He motions his hand again and like a puppet on a string I laugh like a mindless henchman. It’s here I should mention that I have absolutely no memory of any of this. It would have been a totally normal day to the best of my memory if I hadn’t viewed the footage.

&#x200B;

“My, this body is a real good one! Thank you taxi driver for finding me such a suitable replacement. That old one was starting to turn to dust I say, a truly horrid behavior of normal people I might add.” He said.

&#x200B;

“Yes… master…” I said in a voice that sounded nothing like my own.

&#x200B;

“Good boy! Now, drop me off right about here, this should do nicely.” He said.

&#x200B;

I park the car on the side of the road and we both step out. From here I can’t see what’s going on but you can still hear him chatting away.

&#x200B;

“Fantastic work! Now, I want you to forget everything about this little outing we had today, not one bit of it will remain in your memories. Furthermore, in three days while you’re driving your taxi, I want you to drive it directly into the Big City river and don’t come back out, understand?” He said.

&#x200B;

“Yes… master…” I said.

&#x200B;

“Delightful! I’ll be on my way now, au revoir!” He said.

&#x200B;

After that I got back into my taxi I drove off, from there I can remember things that happened for the rest of that day while completely oblivious to anything being wrong.

&#x200B;

About midway through the second day since this happened, the police contacted me about a missing person they were looking for. An old man named Mike Cole. He was last seen exiting his apartment and getting into my cab and the police wanted to know where he went from there. I let them view my interior camera footage and they were satisfied after seeing Mr. Cole exit my cab on the Big City bridge. I however was far more interested in the fact that I didn’t remember him at all, or the guy who got in my cab next, so I watch the rest of the footage and figured it all out.

&#x200B;

I stayed home on the third day, never got behind the wheel once, and honestly if it weren’t for the fact that I needed this job to live I probably would have stayed out of cars forever. After driving my cab a few times on the days after my death date I’m satisfied in saying I’m probably not going to mindlessly drive into the Big City river, but I still avoid driving near it when I can, just in case.

&#x200B;

Mike Cole was found by the way. About 2 days after the police saw my footage they were dragging his body out of the river. I hope he didn’t remember any of it. Not the brainwashing or the life he missed out on. I don’t want to imagine him finally regaining control over his mind just to witness his own death. That would be too sad.

&#x200B;

That’s all the stories I have for you for now, not that I don’t have more it’s just writing all of this out really brought back a lot of the trauma I thought id packed away deep inside me. Regardless of that, I’ll continue driving my cab. I don’t think I can do anything else really, it’s what I’m good at. My daughter is turning 16 in a few months and I absolutely have to make enough cash to send her somewhere better than this. I’ve seen some pretty horrible things living in this city, and even worse things driving in it every day, so I know better than anyone how much of a hell hole it is.

&#x200B;

I will give her a better life, even if it means I never sleep a peaceful night again.
