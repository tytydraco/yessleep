First off to clarify, If you ever plan on being a SAR Officer, I recommend you get adjusted to being isolated in the woods because if you don't, You get paranoid and it can fuck up your entire perception of the job.  


With all that said these are the stories that made me quit the profession and why i avoid the woods at all costs.  


Story 1  
\---------  
First off to date this is the only experience i have ever had with something you could consider a "Rake" or "Skinwalker" When i was learning advanced rock climbing for an expedition coming up, The rock climbing was mandatory by the way. We were taught how to properly hook our "Chisel" As we called it so we could have a very tight and efficient grip on what we were climbing. The issue is that in order to do it you had to put in such immense pressure to the rook to even see if it was stable and if it wasn't it would just suddenly drop.  


I was called out on a search for a missing 27 year old male, His name was Alex Burnwoods. He was as i put emphasis on this, The most athletic person I've seen on the profession, This guy did everything: Skiing, Rock climbing, Surfing etc;  


So i was dispatched to the immediate area to search in something called a clover quadrant among our crew, It was a infinity type loop with a tail at the bottom like pattern to see if an enclosed area had any traces etc; It sounds very fucking weird I know but its our little thing. The first thing i notice is my canine i was put with "Sandy" Had no scent whatsoever, Now this on itself would be nothing special, However what makes this odd was that i saw a blood trail leading around the area the moment i crossed past the treeline, Sandy should have easily been able to scope the scent out yet she couldn't.  


I thought there's a chance this is an animal carcass and nothing too special but i go anyway cause its my job to. As i stumbled upon the boulders the only thing i can describe is meat, It was the male and there was no distinguishable features apart from his clothing and his boots, However this wasn't the worst part, About 11 feet up from where he was stood a chisel so deeply encased in the stone i couldn't see the curvature of the blade, It was just like a sword in the stone only this was solid fucking mountain and it was so high up.. It just didn't make any sense. The other thing was that the body looked **Too** decayed, He had been missing 2 days and what was left looked like he had been there for about 2 weeks, There was purple-green pockets of puss residing among the mass of flesh that was left. This was not normal.  


That's when the final detail hit me. **Silence** Now when people say the woods go silent in most tales, It usually means no insects no wind just stillness, This was different, I almost wanted to cry when i realised how desolate and not moving everything was, It now just hit me there was no snow falling, No clouds moving, Not even a tree branch flowing, It was like i took a photo of everything, Imported it into a game engine and made it so that everything was 3D without animation or sound effects, It was so quiet and yet i couldn't hear my breathing.   


Then out of nowhere i heard 1 sound, 1 of the worst things I've ever laid my ears upon. "Hello?" The mans distinct voice shouted "Anyone there?" It was coming... From up the mountain on a ledge.  
I didn't even have to look up, I just ran immediately, The fact that i had just heard whatever the fuck that thing was mimic the voice of an absolutely obliterated missing person was so bone chilling i almost passed out, It felt like madness was seeping in through my cerebral and i was about to snap like that.   


The rest was a haze, I made it back to ops and they all knew something was up, They asked did i find anything and i responded "Nothing.. Just wanted to get back before any blizzards hit" I doubt the supervisors or for the matter anyone believed the bullshit i spouted but what choice did they have? They couldn't go on a wim and accuse me of shit.. Thinking back i probably shouldn't have done that cuz' well.. We ended up going back a year later to the same mountain for a missing **KID**.  


Her name was Juliane Andies and she is the one missing persons case i knew was gonna go stale before it even started, I knew what had happened off the dot and i didn't want to but i had to... And so as we approached the paper white landscape to begin our clover routine something hit us but we didn't know what.. It wasn't silence or a smell or anything it was just an atmosphere, We were WELL Adjusted to these types of situations to the point that we would just pull out a gun and wait for the predator to try us but something was so terribly wrong about today, We all felt it and nobody wanted to edge any closer but we had to.   


It didn't take long before we saw her red satin dress flowing out of the corner of a tree stump sitting to the right of the mountain, Then we found her left arm and her shoes but nothing else, The arm was immediately sent back to the coroners as we dreaded the possibility of this kid even possibly still being alive and sitting there in such pain..  


That's when it hit me of what had happened, The arm was positioned to a fur tree that was next to the mountain and as i looked up i saw the land had clearly just shifted. The log wasn't hollow on the end we saw the dress and it was filled with snow.. God i dread the sinking feeling i felt knowing what i had realised, It just.. Yeah..  


Basically what had happened was the girl was wandering around likely lost when out of nowhere a small avalanche occurred. It likely swept a log down and in a very unlikely circumstance it was going perfectly vertical, Where the girl was standing. She likely rushed to get cover from the log by going to the fir tree but she wasn't quick enough, The arm she used to try and pull her self tight to the tree log was her left and it was basically forced off by this log, The reason her shoes came off is likely cause when the log finally fell it vibrated so hard she bounced around. That wasn't the worst part however.  


When we finally removed the snow out of the bottom of this log we saw nothing, No body, No blood, Hell not even any evidence to prove this even the same girls arm to begin with. So who the fucks arm was this?   


We never found the girl and the arm is still being tested.. I will get back to you guys soon to explain more about this type of stuff cause there's more to do with the guy who got fucking obliterated by whatever thing i heard on that ledge.  


# Part 2 coming soon!
