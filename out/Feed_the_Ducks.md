*The following contains a transcript from a short radio broadcast that has been picked up by various listeners across the continental United States. Many have been perplexed by its sudden appearance and how it seems to preempt whatever song or radio program they are listening to at the time. It has even been known to appear on streaming programs such as podcasts or Spotify. Listeners have described hearing different episodes and there have been many different situations and incidents.*

*Stephanie and Jennifer were two sisters in their early twenties. They had both been together when they heard the program known as* The Rules of the Road. *I spoke with both of them to get a separate account of their experience with the cursed rule.*

*I was unavailable when Stephanie first contacted me. Her message was skeptical, with a hint of distress underneath. Unfortunately, I didn't get a hold of her until a few weeks later, after the rule had already decided what it was going to do.* 

*If only I had checked my emails while on vacation. Perhaps a life could have been saved.* 

*But my therapist says I shouldn’t beat myself up over this. I’m only one person. I deserve a break every now and then.*

**Jennifer**

When I was in fifth grade, this one kid would always tell the same dirty joke. Back then, we all told inappropriate jokes, sharing them in the back of the class with whispers and giggles, even though we didn’t understand them half the time. 

This kid’s joke wasn’t that funny and it wasn’t that dirty, but he would repeat it at each cut-up session. 

Like if he said it enough times it would stick, transform into something hilarious. 

Well, I guess it finally did stick. 

I remember it to this day. 

The joke goes something like this:

*There's this old married couple. They're sitting on a porch, rocking in their rocking chairs, drinking lemonade, watching the sunset.*  

*All of a sudden, the wife gets up out of her chair and smacks her husband in the face, really packs a wallop.* 

*"Sheesh, what the hell was that for?" he asks, rubbing his head.* 

*"That's for fifty years of bad sex," she replies.* 

*After a while he gets up and throws his glass of lemonade right in her face.* 

*"What was that for?" she sputters, taking off her glasses and wiping her eyes.* 

*"That," he says, "is for knowing the difference."*

The joke didn't really land back in fifth grade. We hardly knew what sex was and definitely not *bad* sex. 

But lately that joke’s been on my mind. Because here lately I've been thinking I'd be kinda like that gal, not knowing the difference until it was too late, until my life had passed me by. 

And it wouldn't just be the sex stuff either, but the whole relationship. 

What I'm saying is I've been questioning things. I bury these questions deep down though. Ignore 'em. I don’t think they do me any good. I mean, I think I’m happy enough. Why pick away at it? It’s only natural to have doubts, right? 

**Stephanie**

How can it be so obvious to those of us outside looking in, but so invisible to those in the relationship? It's like there's a built-in excuse for every issue that's brought up. I guess people in these situations lack awareness. They’re blinded by love. Or insecurity. 

Because, yeah, Jen was really insecure. She kinda went unnoticed in high school and that definitely affected her. But really, it's not like this was warranted. She was shy and had a little acne issue and she wasn't happy with her weight, but really she was just being too hard on herself. 

I'm not going to say it's an ugly duckling situation, because she was never *ugly* to me, but she really came into her own once she hit college, at least I think so anyways. 

**Jennifer**

Before college, I had never had a boyfriend. Not really. 

Throughout high school, I had always felt like something was wrong with me. I hated the way I looked: bad haircuts, bad acne, my weight, my body. I’d look in the mirror and think, *who’d want to date this?* 

I must've been onto something. Nobody ever asked me out.

My older sister would say college was gonna be so much different. "You'll find your people. Don't get hung up on this high school BS." 

Easy for her to say. She had always been the pretty one. The skinny one. Little Miss Popular. 

I wish she had told me before I got to college to not fall too hard for the first guy that paid me any attention. 

Because, maybe I would've had my guard up. Maybe I would've taken things more slowly. Maybe I wouldn't have gotten so involved so soon,with a deep and unhealthy attachment.

**Stephanie**

I was excited for Jen when she told me she had started seeing Zach. I did have a few concerns about her starting a serious relationship so soon in college, but I tried to not be negative. Hopefully it wouldn’t get that far. A good little learning experience to boost her confidence.

If I stop and think about it, I guess it's true that in those early days with Zach I could see a shift in Jen. She was glowing, started wearing a little makeup and putting an effort into the way she dressed, definitely seemed happier than she had in her final years of high school. 

And Zach, at that time, he was alright I guess. Wasn't super talkative. I don't feel an ounce of pity in saying this now, but I'd always thought he was kinda schlubby. If we were judging on looks, I thought Jen could do a lot better. I mean he had definitely outkicked his coverage as they say.

But whatever. 

Looks aren't everything and none of that superficial shit would have mattered had he been a good boyfriend. 

**Jennifer**

How can I reconcile the sweet, kind and attentive guy that I started dating and the one that sat before me? The one that was so distant, the one who had forgotten Valentine's Day, the one who hadn't offered to take me on a date in over a month, the one who watched porn frequently, even when I was going down on him? 

**Stephanie**

Zach wasn’t a good boyfriend, not at all. I couldn’t believe the kinda stuff Jen would tell me. She would come to me for advice—advice she seldom listened to, mind you—and I would just be appalled. 

At first it all seemed benign, like stuff that you could *maybe* give him the benefit of the doubt on. Jen would ask,“Is it normal for him to not text back for hours on end and after I’ve sent him multiple follow ups?” And in an effort to reassure her I’d say, “Maybe he’s not a big texter or he was just taking a nap at the time.”  That seemed to relieve her and she’d thank me, apologize for getting so worked up and anxious. 

“I just really think he’s something. I worry I’m going to push him away with my neediness,” she’d say. 

I should’ve told her, “Girl that’s the last thing you should worry about.”

Some of the more egregious behaviors didn’t appear until months into the relationship, when that new spark started to fade. It was how I didn’t hear from her as much, how she didn’t have any real friends or hobbies, how her life was just school, work, and boyfriend. 

I would outright tell her that various behaviors were huge red flags and that’s when the excuses would set in. 

Once she complained that he had quit taking her on dates, that it had been weeks, that if they ever went anywhere she had to plan it. I told her that, honestly, that kinda sucked. Her response was, “Well, he knows that I like planning dates. He also knows I like watching him play video games, so I think that he views that as quality time.”

“God, Jen. I’m rolling my eyes so hard right now. You’re gonna have to pay my eye doctor bill to  get them put back in place.” 

After they moved in together, she asked if it was normal for guys to watch porn. What she described certainly seemed anything but normal, but who was I to judge? I told her, “All guys watch porn now and then. As long as it’s not interfering with your relationship, then it’s probably ok.” 

She was just quiet after I told her that, didn't offer too many other details. 

*Thank God*.

There was this other time she had car trouble on campus and his lazy ass wouldn't come pick her up. He said he was in the middle of an important match and asked if she could get an Uber. 

He was just really inconsiderate that way. Like there’s this creepy dude that hangs out in the courtyard at their apartment, a guy they call Itchy or Scratchy, on account of him always picking sores in his arms. I’m not sure he even *lives* at their complex or is somebody’s friend or dealer or what, but he’s always there. 

Anyways, Zach would let Jen go out there by herself to get something from her car or make her get food and not even get up from his video game. It’s just bullshit.

**Jennifer**

I was never really worried about Scratchy. 

Well, I guess I was a little at first when we first started dating. I’d get to the apartment and have to walk through that area and up the stairs to Zach’s place and he’d be out there pacing and smoking and mumbling to himself. I’d just give him a wide berth and not make eye-contact, walk quickly to the second floor. When I said I was a little creeped out by him, Zach just kinda blew me off, told me he was harmless. 

Zach never walked me to my car late at night, never offered. Maybe that was the first red-flag I should’ve picked up on, but I guess in the beginning I just didn’t see the flaws. 

But everyone has flaws, right? I should probably just learn to do a better job at communicating with him, express my needs. I do love him. He loves me. I think it’s just that the honeymoon phase is over and that we might have to work at it a little more.  

**Stephanie**

For a while there we just kind of . . .drifted apart. 

**Jennifer**

So one night, I got really sick. It started with nausea, abdominal pain down low. Then the fevers came and soon the vomiting.

“You good?” Zach asked, as I lay curled up by the toilet. I was only able to whimper a response. He kneeled beside me and felt my back, muttered how I was burning up, and he left for what seemed like a very long time. From the living room I thought I could hear his Xbox fire back up again. My mind spiraled in despair and my heart hurt. I was going to have to call my sister. The thing is, I wanted so desperately for *him* to take care of me. I burned for it almost as much as the fever scorching my skin.

Soon, he returned. He placed a cool rag on my forehead, gave me ibuprofen, rubbed my back. “Sorry, had to get to a stopping point there. You need me to take you to the doctor or something?” 

We ended up at the ER. They did a bunch a tests: bloodwork, urine, CT scan. Zach was there through the whole thing, but he wasn’t really *there*. He was pacing around. Sighing heavily. Messing with his phone. He did let me squeeze his hand when they started the IV, but that was the extent of his comforting presence. 

Turns out I had a severe UTI and a few small kidney stones and they pumped me full of fluids and some antibiotics in my IV. The doctor came in and discussed that she thought the stones were small enough to pass on their own. 

“There’s a little tricky one right near the bladder. It’s almost passed,” she said.

“How soon before we—she—can have sex again?” Zach asked.

I couldn’t believe it.

“I mean, she’s not that far away from being admitted and she’s in a lot of pain. I think that’s the last thing on her mind right now,” the doctor said, looking at me. I could only glance away in shame. I would never be someone as confident as her. How did I end up here? The doctor ignored Zach from then on, discussed how I would be discharged with a prescription for antibiotics, anti nausea meds, and some pain pills. 

“Make sure you get these for her, ok?” she said to Zach, sternly. If only she could come home with me and lecture him from time to time to be the partner he needed to be. If only I could be that person. 

Zach dropped the prescriptions off on the way to our apartment. I couldn't wait on them and I needed to lie down in my own bed. He said that he would get me settled and then go pick up the medication. 

I awoke several hours later, all disoriented and in pain. I called out Zach's name, but there was no answer. Just the slamming of the front door. 

I was crying and looking for my phone and when I finally found it, I texted him and he eventually responded that he was on his way back from the pharmacy. It was obvious what had happened. He had gotten distracted with a video game before realizing he needed to pick up the meds.

"Scratchy was hella interested in my pharmacy bag. I swear I shook that pill bottle and it was like a mating call. He came out of nowhere, sniffing my bag."

"Please," was all I could say from my fetal position on the floor. It was a 'please' to give me my medicine. It was a 'please' to shut up and take this seriously. It was a 'please' to be a better boyfriend. I was nauseous and in pain, a pitiful mess. And here he was making jokes and acting like everything was ok. 

It was over. It had to be. 

**Stephanie**

Something happened between Jennifer and Zach after she got really sick that one time. I just remember calling to check on her and she was like, "I'm done."

**Jennifer**

When I told him, he broke down crying. Got down on his hands and knees, was pleading and everything. Bargaining. Apologizing and vowing to change. I had honestly never seen an adult cry that hard. I didn't know how to take it. I told him I just needed some space. 

He slept on the couch while I finished recovering, constantly asked if I needed anything. Wrote me long emails about how sorry he was for how inattentive he’d been, blamed his depression. It had been a vicious spiral. College hadn’t gone how he had thought and when he got down about what he was doing with his life he had withdrawn from himself, from us. 

I didn’t commit to breaking up, but I didn’t commit to leaving, either. It was like we were in limbo. 

**Stephanie**

After that, I reached out to Jen. It was a good sign to me, a sign that she was standing up for herself in some way. Zach was working a couple shifts at the pizza place over the weekend and Jen was free, so I figured it was the perfect opportunity for us to spend some time together. 

We were gonna drive out to the nature preserve, hike around for a bit, then come back to town for dinner, maybe see a movie or go over to one of my friend’s houses. 

**Jennifer**

The day started off pretty good. It was this beautiful early spring day, the sun was warm and there was a nice breeze. The green in the trees was starting to awaken after a long, gray winter. The season seemed to be a perfect backdrop for the hope I had for mine and Zach’s relationship.

Zach was going to change. I could feel it. And it was important for me to kind of show Steph how well I was doing, that my judgment through all of it hadn’t been misguided. I mean, I valued her opinion and if she could see that things were improving, then I would feel . . . I dunno, validated?

**Stephanie**

We had a good time hiking around this lake, just talking and soaking in nature. Jen was feeling hopeful and confident, but in the back of my mind I couldn’t help but feel skeptical. Not wanting to ruin our time together, I tried my best to ignore the feeling. We didn’t even mention Zach. My only hope was that her newfound confidence would lead to some clarity and she would wake up and dump that motherfucker.

We had decided to take the scenic route back to town. That’s when we heard it. Jen heard it first. She asked me if I could hear that quacking noise. 

“You better not,” I said, thinking of a joke our dad had played on us time and time again.

“No, I’m serious.”

And I *could* hear it. Something that sounded like a sea of ducks. Faint at first. Was it outside? I rolled down the window, but there was nothing out there.

My stereo was on low, yet the quacks drowned out the music. It was coming from the speakers, wouldn’t respond to the volume knobs or power switch or anything. Louder and louder with the God awful quacking chorus until a crackling static pierced our eardrums. 

“Holy shit, is this *The Rules of the Road*?” Jen said. 

“What?” I asked.

“It’s like this urban legend thing. This must be some viral marketing deal. I didn’t know it was *that* popular. Let’s listen.”  

Then, this old-timey happy cowboy guy got on the radio, started talking.

***Howdy folks! We’re taking a little detour from our regularly scheduled programming of “The Rules of the Road” to try a lil’ something different. Today I’d like to introduce y’all to a new segment called “Duck Facts.” Yes, it’s time to learn about our fair feathered friends.***

***Did ya know a boy duck is a drake and a girl duck is a hen? Did ya know that drakes have corkscrew shaped dongs? And there is a purpose to it and it’s not just because they’re big fans of cabernet. The hens have little ducky hoohas that are the reverse of that corkscrew. Like the rest of us they’re out here trying to find the right fit, the one that will fit them like a key to a lock.***

***I bet ya didn’t know that ducks practice something called seasonal monogamy. Only monogamous until the leaves change color. Somebody different every winter to fly south with. Now that’s what I call a summer fling!***

***Swans and geese on the other hand, they're the ones that mate for life. That’s some hardcore monogamy, right there. Some real “til death do us part” junk.***

***I’ve talked with a few folks over the years who think monogamy might be one of our biggest shams. Maybe they’re right. Who am I to judge? But I do know it didn’t come from nowhere. Besides, the geese seem to get along just fine with it. But I guess with a goose you know that any other partner you could get ain’t gonna be that much different than what you already got.*** 

***The grass ain’t greener on the other side. It’s just more gooses.*** 

***I guess all our variability made things a bit more complicated, all these dang choices we got nowadays. What happens if you pick the wrong one? Well, you don’t gotta stick around for a season to find out. You’ve got options. And oh the options we have nowadays.*** 

***You been to a cereal aisle recently? Holy Moses! Why just the other day I tried to get me an ice cream cone and there were 37 different flavors and it took me 50 minutes to decide and at the end of it all I didn't even want ice cream anymore and I just staggered out into the sunlight in a daze.*** 

***We have more choices now than at any point in human history, but somehow we’re all more unhappy than ever.*** 

***Now apply that to life partners.  We’ve got a smorgasbord of options on our phones, on the internet, at school, at work. No longer are we confined by geography or a dowry.*** 

***Maybe all these choices ain’t all they’re quacked up to be. Of course, making do with what ya got might not work out too well either. Are people able to change? Like really? Can ugly ducklings become swans?*** 

***I guess at the end of the day you just gotta ask yourself: are you a duck? Or are you a swan?***

***When you get sick of his snoring, when the way he chews his food makes your skin crawl, when she complains over every little darn thing, when she never seems satisfied with what she’s got, when he doesn’t seem to care anymore, when he doesn’t seem to try, the seasonal monogamy of a duck looks pretty damn enticing.*** 

***On the other hand, fighting through the hard times might make you stronger in the end. Remember it's the swans that are monogamous and they are just so dang pretty. Just look at ‘em. Now look at a duck.***

***Think of it! A partnership pulled through the strands of time, stretching across the years. After all it was the ugly duckling that flourished into the swan, the beautiful creature that mates with its partner for life. Maybe your own little relationship is like that ugly duck…bumbling along and hideous to everybody else until it is nourished and grows into that beautiful, everlasting swan.*** 

***Now my name wouldn’t be Buck Hensley if I didn’t have a little Road Rule for you fine folks to follow. I’ll quit quacking around and jump straight to it. If at any point during your journey, you come across a “duck crossing” sign, then it would greatly behoove you to not run over any of those little buggers.*** 

***But that’s not all. That would be too simple. This rule ain’t just about avoiding a hit-n-run of our little waddling buddies. You’re gonna have to work a bit.***

***Once you pass this sign without harming a duck, then you have 24 hours to come back and feed the ducks. Simple enough, right? Just grab a loaf of the stale bread that’s sitting on your counter and come back and feed the ducks.*** 

***Au contraire. . .you can’t do that. Not unless you want a bunch of constipated and obstructed fowl running around. Why these guys were doing gluten free before it was cool!*** 

***No bread allowed. You must feed them the proper foods. We’re talking sliced grapes, frozen peas, oats, or Jimmy cracked corn (and I*** **do** ***care).*** 

***What happens if you don’t feed the ducks? Well then the ducks might feed on you. Kinda funny, isn’t it? Being chewed to death by a buncha ducks. Be that as it may, ignore these warnings at your own peril. Your punishment will roll offa me like water off a well . . . you know.*** 

***Y’all stay happy out there. Stay safe. Stay lively. Stay lonely. I’m Duck Hensley and these are the Rules of the Road.*** 

**Jennifer**

“Well that was weird. Kinda relatable, too, eh?” Stephanie said with a grin. “You said this was for some sort of video game?”

I couldn’t talk. Later, for a brief period of time, I’d wonder if Zach was somehow responsible for it. Especially after I got home. It seemed entirely too coincidental, the subject matter and everything.

“Jen?”

“It’s not a video game,” I said, trailing off. 

**Stephanie**

Jen made me promise that I would take the rule seriously, just in case.

I remember asking her, “You really believe that shit?” and she was just like, “What could it hurt?” 

At dinner she was distracted, constantly checking her phone. 

We didn’t pass any of the signs on the way back to her apartment. When I dropped her off, I told her I loved her.

**Jennifer**

There was this oppressive sense of dread when Stephanie dropped me off. Toward the end of the day, I had received some cryptic texts from Zach and I just wasn’t in the mood to face whatever was in store for me at our place. But as I crossed the courtyard to our place, I could see something scattered on the walkway, something red leading in a trail toward our apartment. 

Blood?

No.

Rose petals.

They were a strange juxtaposition to our dingy apartment surroundings, the rusted balcony railings, the dead bushes in the overgrown planters, all while Scratchy hung out and smoked cigarettes with a weathered, leathered woman in a nearby alcove. 

I followed the petals to our front door. The welcoming mat was more welcome than ever before. Inside there were candles, a smell of something delicious, an indie folk playlist softly playing, a well-worn path in the freshly vacuumed carpet where he had been pacing about the place. 

It was the sweetest thing anybody had ever done for me.

My ugly duckling relationship was now a swan. Maybe.

People *could* change

To err was human

To forgive was divine. 

**Stephanie**

Well, I tried. But I can’t say that I was surprised. Maybe it was like quitting smoking. How it took multiple attempts for it to really stick. 

**Jennifer**

For a while there, things were good. *Really* good. We didn't leave the bedroom that entire weekend. He took me on dates. He texted me during the day. He had turned back into the person I'd fallen in love with. 

I suppose I should’ve known it wouldn’t last. It hadn’t the first time. Why would it now? Gradually, we returned to the rut we were in before the reconciliation. He quit texting me during the day. I went to bed alone most nights while he stayed up with neverending video game sessions. I became an afterthought.  

We seldom had meals together and when we did it was with a TV or phone screen in between us. Hadn’t been on a date in over two weeks. Hadn’t had sex in almost as long. 

All this distraction and I almost forgot about the broadcast, almost forgot about the rule. I really should’ve just done what Steph suggested.

**Stephanie**

Why leave it to chance? A minor inconvenience, I guess. Took about an hour out of my day. I told Jen I’d do it with her. But she said she was busy with Zach, said she'd get around to it eventually.  Maybe deep down we really didn’t take it seriously, like one of those chain letters your grandma sends you.

I got some grapes and oatmeal and shit and went down to the campus duck pond. I drove past the sign. I fed the ducks and left. Took me maybe ten minutes, tops. 

**Jennifer**

I almost drove past it without thinking. I’d passed by it so many times before, that it was just an imperceptible part of the scenery. I hadn’t been this way in some time, yet a post-exam celebration for a brutal physics final with some fellow classmates at a patio bar took me here.

My mouth turned to cotton. My palms grew sweaty. I made my way back to the apartment. 

Zach was in his usual place. Parked on the couch with his eyes glued to the TV screen, controller clutched in his hand. 

“Hey,” he said without looking at me.

“Hey,” I said. “You know when I told you about that radio broadcast that Stephanie and I heard?”

“The Rules of the Road? The fanmade thing?”

“I mean, I guess it could’ve been fanmade. It was pretty creepy.”

He was distracted, cursing under his breath at the screen.

“Zach,” I said. “I need you to listen to me. Can you take a break?”

He sighed, set his controller on the coffee table, blinked a few times. “Okay, I’m here,” he said with a strained smile. 

“This rule or superstition or whatever you want to call it. Could you do it with me? It’s really easy. All we gotta do is feed some ducks.”

“Feed some ducks? Like stale bread?”

“Can’t do bread. Has to be something they can digest.”

“Wait. They can’t digest *bread*?”

“The rule has a list of things they’re supposed to eat. I was thinking, since we haven’t had a date in a while we could have a little picnic and feed the ducks.”

“Oh yeah, sure thing, babe.”

“Zach,” I said, my tone serious. “I *need* this.Things have been slipping again.”

“I know, I know. I’ve been slacking. Gotta keep it in check. Hey, how about you give me the list of duck approved foods? I’ll take care of everything.”

# 

The day was hot as hell. Miserably humid with air you could practically drink. A heat that clung to you and made every corner of your body sticky with sweat.

“I know the perfect place,” Zach said as we trudged across the vast lawn of the park toward the duck pond. I was carrying our picnic blanket while Zach carried a small ice chest.

But the perfect place was on the other side of the duck pond, and we had to cross a small bridge to get there. All this to say, that we were a long way from the car and were coming up on the 24 hour cutoff.

We spread the blanket out under the shade of a willow tree. Zach rifled through the ice chest, setting out beers and koozies, a jar of mayonnaise, a tub of potato salad. He mumbled to himself as he did so, started piling up more cans of beer. Soon there was an aluminum pyramid built next to a jar of mayonnaise, a tub of potato salad, and a half loaf of sliced wheat bread. 

“Umm,” I said. “Is that it?” Desperation rising in my voice.

“I swear I put it in here,” he said, looking around all perplexed.

“What?”

“The sandwiches. The other sides. If you hadn't been rushing me—look, I guess I got distracted. We can have beer and potato salad. A little snack before our task and then I can take you somewhere. How about that?” he said, cracking a beer.

“But what about the grapes? The oats? The stuff for the ducks.” 

“That's what the bread's for.” 

“I told you it had to be something other than bread. That's what the rule said. It gave a whole bunch of alternatives, a list I gave you.”

“Jesus, Jen. *Relax*.” 

“I need to go buy the stuff.”

“Seriously?”

“There won't be time. Oh it's gonna be too late.” I was freaking out, pacing back and forth, trying to control my breathing.  

“Babe calm down.”

“Give me your fucking keys,” I hissed. 

He made a pained face, handed them over. “I’ll be right back,” I said, not waiting for him to answer.

Through curtains of heat, I jogged to his car. By the time I got there, I was panting and drenched in sweat. Opened the door, put the key in and turned it.

Of course.

The engine just clicked and wouldn’t turn over. I tried again and again. Nothing. 

“I forgot to tell you,” Zach said, coming up behind me. “The battery’s been on the fritz. I think it’s on its last legs.”

I didn’t even have the energy to scream. Could only sink into the driver’s seat, my legs melting into the floorboards. 

**Stephanie**

Jen called me that night. A complete mess. She was certain that this was the end. I tried to talk her through it, tried to make the notion of a killer radio broadcast as absurd and ridiculous as it sounded. 

“It’s just an urban legend, Jen. What’s the rule? If you don’t feed the ducks, the ducks will feed on you? Has anybody in the history of mankind been killed by a duck?” 

“I’m thinking of a guy in a duck costume,” she said. “A deranged serial killer with a mascot suit from Disneyland.”

“Well. I guess that’s a possibility. But you would think you would hear about something by now, yeah?” 

“I guess.”

But what really pissed me off was Zach. Of course he would find a way to fuck this up.

**Jennifer**

There in the parking lot, while we waited for a jump, I lost it on him. Not even because I necessarily believed the rule at this point, but more because of everything else. How he couldn’t follow a simple instruction. 

“You don’t understand,” I said. “It’s going to be too late.”

“C’mon Jen. Calm down. It’s not real. Nothing’s gonna happen.”

“That’s not the point! I asked you for one thing. *One* thing! And you don’t know that it’s not real. What if it is, huh?” 

“Seriously? Look, I’m sorry.” 

“No you’re not.”

“Whatever. You’re overreacting.” 

**Stephanie**

Later, I got to doing my own searching for “The Rules of the Road.” This was against all rational thought. I found your blog and series of posts on all of the previous cases. Even though these case studies seemed outrageous, it honestly started to freak me out a bit. 

**Jennifer**

I was driving home from work when I saw it, lumbering across a vacant lot. A shadow out of the corner of my eye. Could only make out a general shape of the thing, its movement. Bigger than a buffalo. It was gone in a couple of blinks. 

I had dreams of dead, black eyes staring at me, shiny and shimmering and boring a hole into my soul. I had visions of ducks swarming me like piranhas, of duck mouths gaping open, their bills lined with serrated edges that could saw through my skin. Their heads tilted back to force my blood and flesh down their throat. Nobody heard my screams.

Later, that shape I had seen previously? It was getting closer. 

I could see the ridged spine of its back as it slithered through parked cars, platypus-like on four legs, legs that ended in clawed, webbed feet. It faded out from this plane to the next, gone in an instant, but I knew that it was only a matter of time before it got closer, before it was time for it to feed.
