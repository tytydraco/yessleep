**There’s Something in the Darkness and It Wants Me to Join It** 

I first encountered it when I was a teenager, probably 16 or 17, as I was sleeping on a school night. It was 3 o’clock on the dot when I glanced at the time on my watch, rubbing the tiredness from my eyes after waking to the sound of something in my room. Being young, I was a little apprehensive about looking around my room in complete darkness, my blackout curtains preventing any moonlight from coming in and the soft glow that usually came from my idle computer screen was predictably absent. I heard the noise again, a gentle wispy whistling like how wind sounds when it travels through a narrow opening, but loud enough that it sounded more like quiet whispering. The very thought that someone or something was in my room whispering, even if it was just the wind sent shivers down my spine and I dare not move a muscle. I laid there in the bed for what seemed like a century just listening, waiting, wanting to see if what I was hearing was indeed the wind or if it was something far worse than that. 

It wasn’t until the sound became louder that I began to realize that it couldn’t have been the wind, the only place it would’ve been coming from was my window and the curtains were as still as death. I then chanced looking around from my supine position and could only see one of the two far corners in my room, the other being blocked by my desk in my field of view. I decided to lift my head slightly to get a better angle but immediately regretted my decision when I caught a glimpse of something just beyond the wall of my desk. I flew back into a flat position, instinctively trying to conceal my location though such a thing would be fruitless seeing as I had already moved around so much. I wasn’t sure what I had seen, it was darker than the darkness of my room and the black of the things around it, but again, I only witnessed it momentarily.  

I inhaled deeply, weighing the possibility of it being an animal that may have somehow breached the window or a person that broke in, something that was causing such a strange noise. I made another decision, I thought to myself that if it was an animal, the only way it’ll leave is if I make it, it’s probably terrified or hurt, coming through a window. But, if it’s a person, sitting and waiting for them to attack me in some way is a kind of crappy way to die, so I have to do something, I have to confront it. So, swallowing hard and taking in another breath beforehand, I slowly rose from the bed and peered past my desk towards the corner to try and see if I could discern a figure of some kind. 

What I saw still puzzles me to this day. It was like a dark, black, misty substance in the corner of the room, tucked behind and beside two small crates that sat adjacent to it. It was the deepest black color I had ever seen in my life, like looking straight into the void. There were swirls of smoky wisps coming from it and fading into the air and as I stared at it, brows furrowed and eyes wide, I could hear the whispering coming directly from it.  

My curiosity had gotten the better of me and I was good and ready to get up and go investigate, just like the idiot from every horror movie ever. But something held me in place, although only momentarily because, before I could realize what I was doing, I was half across the room only a few feet from the darkened corner. It was as if my mind wasn’t my own for a few seconds, I was just in my bed, but now I was a short distance from some spooky thing in my room. I moved again without thinking as the whispering continued, its volume fluctuating as I took one, then two steps toward it. A misty appendage stretched out from the collection of darkness and extended out to me, the sound from the whispering becoming so loud, I was sure it was going to wake up the others in my house. I pushed my own hand forward to the wispy limb and let its tendrils wrap around my fingers, palm, and wrist. I could hear the whispers so loud in my ears, they were starting to ring as the smokiness moved up my arm and over my elbow. I couldn’t move, not that I wanted to, the feeling of it wasn’t obscene in any way and the longer I held onto it, or it held onto me, rather, I started to see a blinding white light come into view. I could see it begin to cloud my vision and, although it was a little unsettling for my eyes to suddenly to be flooded with light, the appearance of it was calm and comforting, loving even. I liked it. 

It started to feel like I was slipping out of existence, like I was floating, not in my own body. The light overcame me, and I was swimming in my own head, trying to get ahold of something around me but I was both flying and falling in the open air. It felt like this was happening for hours, like I was moving through untouched space for so long, but then it ended with a soft squeak, a gentle light, and a familiar voice. 

“Whatcha doin’?” The voice of my mother who peeked in to check in on me sounded from behind me in the direction of the door. I snapped my head around and, with my arm still outstretched, gave her a look that must have worried her, because she further stepped into my room and flipped on my lights. “Natalie? You alright?” She asked, the usual motherly worry present in her words. 

I looked at her for a moment but remembered what was just happening. I whipped my head back to the corner but there was nothing there, not a single ounce of evidence anything had even been there in the first place. My brows knitted together once more at the sight of this, the loss of such an inviting, comforting warmth tugging at me. 

“Natalie?” Her equally comforting voice pulled me away from where I was standing and as I walked towards her, I lowered my arm and gave her an awkward, brief smile. 

“I’m fine.” I finally spoke, moving to get back in bed and cover up. “Just sleepwalking, I guess.”  

“You’ve never done that before.” My mom put her hands on her hips and watched as I tucked myself in, stepping back towards the doorway to leave while she did so. 

“First time for everything.” I joked; the blanket I was previously wrapped in now snuggly draped over my figure again. 

“Hm. Well, get some sleep, you’ve got school in the morning, and I don’t want you complaining that you’re tired.” She closed my door after turning out my lights again, leaving me in darkness once more.  

Once she left, I sat back up, looking to the corner in my room to see if I could see the black mass, but there was nothing but the wall in the place where the misty apparition had been. I watched the area for a few minutes, possibly hoping to see something happen, but nothing ever did show up. I sighed in defeat and laid my head back onto my pillow, letting sleep take me. 

The last few hours of sleep I had before the morning woke me were...remarkable. I dreamt of the most terribly wonderful and dreadful things. The warm light came back to me, a vast unending comfort, like what you would expect from your mother’s bosom as you are held tightly just after birth. I felt calm and protected and let the feeling of floating in mid-air take over me, but it did not last. I was suddenly thrust into darkness, a void much like the blackness of the ghostly figure I witnessed only for it then to ripple into visions of devastation and destruction all around me. Natural disasters, floods, landslides, earthquakes, the earth literally splitting like a ripe melon and swallowing massive skyscrapers and small cottages alike; the sky falling into the earth, meteors and asteroids plummeting into massive bodies of water and burning them up, decimating the land around them; living creatures, big and small, struck with famine and disease, collapsing one-by-one at the feet of their caretakers; and finally, anything and everything green shriveling up to brown mush and spoiling down to their very roots, trees, grass, corn, wheat, beans, everything a farmer planted in his lot fizzled away in the wind as if it was made of nothing but dust itself. 

Then, after the tormenting images flashed in front of me over and over, the sound of whispering flooded in, and the scene around me turned to white again. Sadly, it too did not last. The white faded out and I was abruptly standing on the shore of a large beach, the waves crashing in slowly, but as I peered into the distance, I could see a terrible, powerful storm was approaching. I heard the whispering again, louder this time and it drew my attention to just behind me. Upon turning around, I was greeted with the sight of a lifetime

There stood an at least 100-foot tall, crimson-colored dragon. Now, this isn’t an unusual sight for a dream, dragons happen often in dreams. But this seemed vastly different, in many, many ways. The deep redness of its scales shimmered in the sunlight, the commanding, domineering presence in which the creature held without me yet seeing its face sent waves of goosebumps from the top of my head all the way down to my toes. I could only gape at the scene before me. I took several panicked steps back and realized this thing was no ordinary dragon, it held seven colossal, crowned heads and ten equally enormous, sharp horns. I swallowed hard and just as I was about to say something, it seemed the massive monster caught sight of me in some of its many eyes and started to lower one of its many heads. As it got closer and closer to me, the whispering got so intense, I could barely stand it, it was as if it was coming from the dragon itself. The beast’s large head was only feet from mine now and it opened its mouth like it was about to speak but, just before it spoke, or before anything happened, everything suddenly evaporated and faded into the darkness that, without warning, enveloped me. Then I heard it. Ringing. First it was a quiet humming but soon became a loud chirping and it was driving the very sanity from me. Before I tore my hair out, I finally woke up and realized it was my alarm clock on my phone, ringing to wake me up for school the next day. 

For the next few hours, I was on auto pilot as usual, getting dressed, eating breakfast, and getting to school. The day dragged on as if it was any other day, like I didn’t just have some sort of ethereal experience in a dream the night before. It was odd, the dream, and I was thinking of it the whole day, that is...until what happened after lunch. 

The cafeteria had just let my group out and everyone was headed to their respective classes, me included. But then I passed an area partially blocked off by a ‘WET FLOOR’ sign and I spotted the janitor, a nice, older man of some Spanish descent, I believe. When I noticed him, he was mopping up a mess another student had made, likely a spill from the previous lunch groups, but nothing out of the ordinary, his hunched over posture tugging his collar forward and revealing the nicotine patch on his neck. He was minding his own business doing janitor stuff. I started to lag behind the larger group of people as the students began to dissipate and I stopped to wave at the man, he was a generally friendly person and I was just being friendly back. When I did this though, he looked up and me and an expression of pure horror grew upon his face, like he’d seen a monster of ancient times ready to rip off his face and tear a new hole into his body.  

“Ay Dios mio...” I heard him whisper as he made the sign of the cross over his chest and pull a cross that was tucked into the folds of his collar out to kiss it.  

It unnerved me and I gave him a puzzled look, starting to walk away from him, but as I turned my back and began to take a few steps I heard a loud splashing sound. I snapped my head around to look at what the source was but found a horrifying occurrence instead. The janitor was pulling out a lighter and sparked it in his hand. 

“Dios nos salve...” The man held it to his clothes and before I could react, he burst into flames, his clothes, hair, shoes, everything...one big fireball. I must’ve screamed at the top of my lungs at the sight of it, but it seemed like it took people forever to respond. 

After everything was said and done, the man had died from the smoke inhalation, at least that’s what I heard. They couldn’t put him out fast enough because of whatever he poured on himself as an accelerant, he just kept burning. People kept saying he was one big mess after they finally did put him out, just a mass of flesh and blood. All I remember is seeing him go up in flames and I kinda blocked out what happened immediately after. The cops sat me down a few days later and asked me if he said anything to me, the cameras showing me waving to him but there's no audio. They wanted to know if he threatened me or spoke any words at all, or if maybe I said something to him, maybe told him to do it or something like that. No words were ever spoken between us, is what I told them. I didn’t really understand what was happening or why the guy did it. What I do remember is that the moment I heard the splashing of whatever he used to set himself on fire, I heard that whispering again, quiet but still audible.  

For a while I didn’t believe these things had anything to do with each other, the strange dream and the janitor, even with the whispering and the looks the man gave me just before he died. Until it happened again.
