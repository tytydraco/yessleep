before i get started. i need to explain that i was part of a religious community and recently left. there was no electricity. no books. no access to other communities. i have spent most of my life there. and it has effected many parts of my life. my grammar for example isnt great. and i am in a process of recovery. but i had to write this. because someone. somebody needs to know about the something...

here goes.

there have been disappearances. everywhere. and everybody notices, in this town atleast. but nobody says a word. except me. 

i first heard about "don't" when i was a kid. it was a sleep over at teddy bridgers and i must have been about ten years old. i still remember him whispering the tale to the four of us with a candle near his face.

he wrote each letter on separate pages and told us to never say it out loud. d. o. n. t.

dont.

looking back its kind of funny growing up in a small town and not realizing that not a person ever uttered the word. kids couldnt even be trusted to know it. teddy only knew about it because he seen some writings his mother left out. they were for a meeting. so we could only assume the adults would attend secret meetings about it.

besides that daily life was simple. you went to school. played with friends. sometimes kids came home. sometimes they dont. we never heard why. we never heard how. we just knew not to ask.

what exactly was "don't"?
well truthfully nobody really knows.
but there have been some "survivors" or witnesses as we like to call them. but they never lived long after.

people say it appears to you as the three things you find the most frightening. but all combined. and it chases you through your house. 

you see, it only haunts the house until you die. but then it begins to hunt. how does it hunt? it listens. it hears the word...

im so sorry how could i forget. before "don't" appears to you. it comes in shape of a person. it could be friend. it could be family. it could even be a stranger. and it makes you say a word. or even read it. it tricks you into doing it, the devil that it is. what is the word? one can only assume "don't". how many times? i don't know.

i know this all sounds crazy. and how do i know this is real? well...i can remember a couple weeks after the sleepover. they found parts of ellie. some in a tree. some in a stove. some in boxes sent to homes.

you see he thought teddy was lying to us at the party. trying to get us crying like babies and running home. so he apparently said it infront of his parents...

after. after it happened. after they saw it. well they both died shortly after. and i never heard their description. but ellie was afraid of manniquins, spiders, and extra teeth...i cant even... i cant even imagine.

anyways i am writing this to you to let you know. for your own sake. your own protection. please. be careful. please stop saying the word. because it will come.

and remember. it appears as three things. but first it possesses somebody. tricks you into saying the word. do we know many times? we don't.

here is proof that im real.
