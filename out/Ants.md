Roused to consciousness, I found myself staring at the ruby red floor, unable to look away. Realizing the state of my accursed position, I began to see them, marching slowly, uniformly, toward the source of the crimson river: ants. Some of them small, others a little larger, but all of them fixated on the same task. I could only see in my periphery the insectoid army separating my pale flesh further, invading my body. Each ant brought its own little strike of pain, which was minor and sharp, but repeated every half second or so.

The water in my tub was fairly cold now, matching the 65 degree ambient temperature, and my body no longer had the heat necessary to warm it any further. My brain begged me to shiver, but my body refused. It begged for me to withdraw my limp, extended arm, to rub the onslaught off of my forearm, but my body again refused. It weakly requested that I move at all, but was met with nothing.

I could hear, through the rain tapping at the frosted window, rubber grinding against concrete - my parents. Mortified, I could once again feel the begging return, as I sat here in the silent, pale bathroom with the door unlocked. They couldn't see me like this, but there was nothing I could do. It was as the front door opened downstairs that the typical dotted pattern was abruptly broken, and I glanced down to see one final, heaving, massive ant trudging its way towards my outstretched fingers. She was surrounded by a number of smaller drones, who seemed to be pushing her along, supporting her oversized body.

She crawled onto my hand with some difficulty, and I could only widen my eyes, attempting to make contact with the queen and somehow, maybe, send her a signal to turn the other way. My effort, however, was unsuccessful, and she approached the crook of my elbow, preparing herself for burrowing.

This time, the pain was excruciating, and I wondered how I could be in this state; where I had gone wrong and found myself half-dead but still capable of experiencing this tortured existence. My nerves still sent every punishing signal to my brain, which in turn still processed all of my surroundings, just without the ability to control my muscles in any meaningful way. Finally, she popped herself into my arm, and I could hear my parents beginning to climb the stairs to the second floor. I could only brace for the inevitable now, and hope that they would avert their gaze upon entering the room.

The wind and rain had picked up now, and the window pane began to rattle. Slowly, my eyeballs turned towards the door, and something shifted inside of me. My arm twitched, and without exerting any effort, I began to sit up in the tub. Blood spilled out onto the floor from my arms, and ants spilled out across my face from my mouth and ears. It was becoming difficult to see now, as the ants indiscriminately darted across my nose, eyes, and lips.

I lurched out of the tub, fully standing now, and water spilled across stained tiles and a pocket knife. The sloshing of the water surely alerted my parents to my body's presence. My father opened the bathroom door as my body stood to stare at him.
