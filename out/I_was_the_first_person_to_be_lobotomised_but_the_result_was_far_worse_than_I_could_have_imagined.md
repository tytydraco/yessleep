I had the procedure so long ago that I can only remember vague pieces of the events surrounding it. It must have been the late 1800s or the early 1900s, but as I said I can’t exactly recall. 


I do remember enough of my old life, though. I was an ex-criminal and had heard whispers of this new procedure whilst I had been incarcerated. I enjoyed my eventual freedom until a knock at the door led me down a terrible path. My supposedly reformed status together with my criminal past meant I was the ideal test candidate, the perfect canvas for this twisted experiment. 


I wish I knew what I was in for all those years ago.


Throughout an extended period of time, the same men who knocked on my door explained the procedure in an exceedingly positive light and the novelty and apparent professionalism of it all managed to convince me I would both be doing a service to humanity - to people who had a past like my own but just needed a little push in the right direction - and would greatly improve upon my own life. It took months of preparation and careful explanation, and my memories begin to fade as I attempt to recall the days and weeks prior to the day of the procedure. 


The months, years and even decades following the procedure are a blur. Time mutated from a simple linear function to some mutated blob of nothingness. I do remember being able to live to some extent, but much of what my lived experience was for many decades is forever lost upon me. 


My memory began to clear up at some point in the 1960s. At that point, I should have been rapidly approaching my death, yet I maintained some semblance of youth. I had certainly aged, but not nearly as much as I should have. I remember knowing something was very wrong, yet at the same time, I enjoyed my impossibly youthful look and feel. Still, it was a good idea to figure out what went wrong - or right- with the procedure and I stumbled through my hazy memories to recall the name of the doctor who had operated on me all those years ago. Eventually, I managed to come up with it, but he had unsurprisingly died a few decades earlier and his practice had been shut down.


The people I knew were fascinated with my condition, and understandably so. If I knew somebody who aged at an impossibly slow rate, I would try to understand it too. They never managed to, though, and the existence of those I loved was the eventual turning point of my apparent strength into a living nightmare. One by one, I had to watch all of them die.


They say that grief changes a person, and I am living proof of that. By the time the last person from my old life passed, I had grown to resent every waking moment. The existential horror of a life span with an unknowable length grew day by day. I tried to end it an innumerable amount of times, but unsurprisingly not a single attempt yielded any results. 



I found out after my first attempt that I would feel all the pain that came with a suicide attempt, though. Waking up in a sterile, drab hospital room with a body that had crashed against the open ocean from the tallest bridge I could find - full of shattered bones and torn flesh - instead of being free from my terrible curse was the worst thing that had happened to me. I closed my eyes for each night of my long, arduous recovery with the desperate wish of being freed from my earthly prison. 


As you can imagine, it never came. It still hasn’t, and I have no reason to believe it will any time soon.


I won’t bore you with the details of all the other attempts, but I did learn from the first and eventually perfected the technique of suicide attempts that would cause the least pain in the inevitable case I survived. The dawn of the Internet was a large help in this, and the novelty of new technologies made some aspects of my existence at least *somewhat* interesting. Perhaps I kept trying to end things myself in some subconscious form of self-punishment for the terrible mistake I had made decades before. I gave up eventually, resigned to the fact that only natural causes could end my suffering. I have been ageing throughout the decades, but I am still far from the ending I so desperately crave. I am forced to adapt to generational changes that I should never have lived to have seen, forced to live in a world that should never have existed for me and forced to walk amongst people I was never born to. The natural causes I have been waiting for are still far out of sight and reach. 


I still catch myself occasionally wondering how and why this fate became mine. My theory of choice is that the procedure went exactly as planned. That I was never the first human subject in a test of the efficacy of lobotomies in improving the criminal mind, but rather the first human subject in a test of pushing the limits of human age beyond what they were ever supposed to be. A test to see how far punishment could be taken. To see how impossibly inhumane punishment could be.


Well, they succeeded.


I am not sure if anybody involved in the mutilation of my existence is still out there, but I can only hope they were never aware of the success of their experiment. The thought of others suffering this fate is one of the few things that still has the ability to make me feel emotions that are otherwise long lost. 


Some say it’s morally wrong to wish death on a fellow human being. 


I say that I am *barely* a human being anymore.


Please, if you are reading this, wish for my release from this torturous life. It may be the only situation in which it is the moral thing to do. 


I can only hope something gives soon.
