It’s hard to explain to people who don’t have kids how the love you feel for your child is unlike any other emotion. How, in your gut, you know you’d die for your child, you’d sacrifice anything and anyone. Until the last few days, I’d never considered the consequences of feelings like these. 

“You’re not supposed to wake him up,” my wife said from our bed. I was not, in fact, going to wake my son. I knew—from where, I didn’t know—that you don’t wake up someone who’s sleep walking. 

It was 3am. Sullivan, our son, was standing statue-like in the doorway to our bedroom, a little-boy mannequin in baseball PJs. How long he’d been there, I didn’t know, just that when I got up for my nightly visit to the bathroom, there he was. Silent. In the doorway. Watching. 

“You okay, buddy?” I whispered and waved my hand in front of his eyes. He didn’t blink, didn’t seem to see anything. I placed my hand on his shoulder to guide him back to bed when Penelope’s voice stopped me: “Do you really think he should have that thing around his neck while he’s sleeping? He could choke.”

That “thing” was the locket I’d bought for my son earlier in the day.

Sully had a big baseball tryout on Friday, to see if he could make his middle school team. An anxious kid already, he’d been a ball of nerves for a week. So when I stumbled across the four-leaf clover locket at that little booth outside the Wednesday farmer’s market, I thought I had hit the parenting lottery. Baseball is a game full of superstition, something Sully had already picked up on. 

“He said it makes him feel lucky and we need all the good feelings we can get right now.” I pointed at Sully, made a face that said “case-in-point.” 

Penelope frowned. “The chain’s thin, at least,” she said and rolled on her side.  

The next morning, Thursday, Sullivan didn’t remember a thing. Over his usual breakfast of corn flakes and a banana, he was his typical eleven-year old self. I dropped him off at the school car line and hoped that, as my internet search suggested, his sleep-walking was just a one-time stress-induced event.

It wasn’t. That night, Pen was the one to wake first. She shook me (too roughly, I thought) and there was Sully: a blank-faced mannequin again, closer this time, at the foot of our bed.

Gently, like the internet directed us, Penelope replied, “It’s okay, sweetie.” 

Sully, asleep but not, didn’t respond.

“Fun,” Penelope whispered. “I guess this is going to be a thing now.” She tried to sound breezy, but I know my wife and could tell she was stressed about it. Honestly, I was stressed about it, too. Not so much about the sleepwalking itself, but more that neither my wife nor I have an easy time getting back to sleep after the lights come on. 

The next morning, I was exhausted, Penelope moreso. There’s that quip about youth being wasted on the young. Well, sleep is wasted on the young, too. Neither my wife nor I cared about sleep in our twenties. Now, in middle age, we care about few things more. One thing we cared about more was Sully. It was time for professional help and Pen said she’d call the pediatrician but she was in court all day so could I do it? Sure, I told her. 

The only well-rested person in the house was my boy. Nervous about his try-outs, yes, but the kid bounced around like a caffeinated Chihuahua. He kept fingering the locket that hung outside his shirt. I liked that. I liked to think that the locket was the source of his energy and good spirits. 

Once I got Sully dropped off and I got settled into my office, I called Sully’s doctor. The first available appointment was Monday morning. I said my wife was very worried (sorry Pen!). The office lady wasn’t. Kids do stuff like this all the time, the lady said. Nothing I told her raised alarms.

When I picked Sully up at school, I was more nervous about the baseball tryouts than the sleepwalking and was relieved to see him bouncing up to the car. He’d hit a home run! I whooped and yelled *great*! What wasn’t so great is that he’d become even more of a caffeinated Chihuahua back at home. Penelope, who had a rough day at trial, wasn’t her best self and for some reason zeroed in on the locket again, which Sully didn’t remove during his shower. She wanted him to *take the damn thing off*. Sully said it helped him hit the homer. I said *I* thought it helped him hit the homer. And so that little trinket, that little gift from a dad to his boy kid, *that* became *a thing*. 

Pen stomped off to bed and fell asleep quickly. At 10:30, two hours after his normal bedtime, the lights in Sully’s room were out and it was quiet. By the time I got back to our bedroom, Pen was up again, worried about the trial, worried about our son, worried, now, about not sleeping. She asked me to check on Sully. I did. Totally zonked. Back in our room, I could feel the tension dissolve and, within twenty minutes, both of us were, mercifully, asleep. 

The next thing I knew, Penelope yelped. I bolted awake. Sully was there, next to the bed, his hands resting on his mother’s arm.

It’s an awful feeling to be creeped out by your own kid. But seeing him there, his face blank, his hands on his mother’s skin, was frightening. 

I said nothing as I went through the routine of guiding him back to bed. 

“The pediatrician can’t see us until Monday?” Penelope asked when I got back to bed. The blanket was pulled up to her neck. 

“They said there’s nothing to worry about. They said this is normal.” I spoke definitively, as much to convince myself as to convince my wife.

Neither of us was convinced, but what more was there to say? I couldn’t think of anything until I did.

“Why don’t we get a hotel tomorrow night? Like, for a sleep vacation. One night. Have my sister come over if she’s available.”

I expected Pen to shoot the idea down, to say she was too worried about Sully to leave him. Instead, she said, “I think that’s a great idea.”

Things were falling into place, almost like they’d been fated. My sister was available. I told her about the sleepwalking and she wasn’t fazed at all. Sully was beside himself with excitement to spend an evening watching movies and eating crap food with Auntie Summer. Penelope and I ate at our favorite Italian restaurant. For dessert, we had tiramisu, Penelope’s favorite. 

Pen was passed out by seven. 

Before passing out myself, I checked my phone. A text was waiting from my sister. All good on the home front. Sully must have been as exhausted as we were; he’d conked out less than halfway through *The Sandlot*. Summer had already put him to bed and asked me if she could uncork the bottle of Turley I’d been aging. Without hesitation, I gave her a thumbs up.

Within minutes, I was as unconscious as my wife and kid. 

Some time later, I woke to a quiet click, which I now realize was the sound of our hotel door opening. I fell back to sleep only to wake again moments later when I heard Penelope’s scream.  

What I saw in the dim light: a small dark figure with its arm raised. The flash of metal. Penelope next to me, on her back, a black stain welling through her T-shirt. 

Without thinking, I rolled across my wife and launched myself into the attacker. His body was small and familiar.

Sully was knocked off balance and, despite my legs being tangled in the bedcovers, my weight was enough to pin him to the ground. I screamed my wife’s name as I slammed my boy’s arm against the floor. Penelope was silent. Sully was silent. The knife bounced across the carpet. 

I got to my knees and, not letting go of my boy, looked at Penelope. Her white T-shirt was now black with blood. Her eyes and mouth were open and unmoving. 

Sully tried to free himself from my grip. I threw him to the floor with more violence than I’d even used on another person. He crumpled and immediately began to wail, the first sound he’d made. 

Insane as it might seem, I had the brief thought to go to my boy, comfort him, make everything okay again. 

But Penelope…

I slapped the switch to the nightstand light. As my head whipped round to Penelope, something glinted from the floor. It was the locket, torn from Scully’s neck in our struggle. It had smashed open, freeing the clover from the glass.

The clover wasn’t four leaves, it was five. And traced on those leaves were five scratchy lines in the shape of a star. A pentagram.
