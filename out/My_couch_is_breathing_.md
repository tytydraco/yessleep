I promise you, I’m not crazy. I’ve seen it with my own two eyes - my living room couch is breathing. The cushions pulsate rhythmically, expanding and contracting as if a pair of unseen lungs lie just beneath the fabric. I sat there staring at it for 3 hours this morning, trying to convince myself it was just a trick of the light, a quirk in my vision, anything other than what it seemed. I got up and made myself a fresh, piping hot cup of coffee, but by the time I took my first sip, it’d gone stone cold, as if hours had slipped by in mere seconds. My eyeballs felt as if they were on fire. I had to force myself to blink, alleviating the stinging. For what seemed to be the 100th time, I rubbed my eyes. Didn’t work. My goddamn couch was still breathing.

How could a couch be breathing? It's just a piece of furniture—an auburn lump stained with the remnants of last month's dinner. I knelt down to the level of the couch, my knees hitting the floor with a soft thud. Putting my hand on the surface, I almost expected it to feel warm, alive, almost. But of course not. It’s a couch. The leathery surface was cool to the touch, but unmistakably throbbing. My couch is breathing.

I wrote an email to the furniture company that day. *I know it’s been 4 years since I bought it*, I said. *But I’d like a refund. The couch is breathing.* I never did hear back from them. I made up my mind to give them a 1 star rating on their website.

I got up from my desk, softly shutting my laptop. Venturing over to my kitchen for a cup of coffee, I stop dead in my tracks as I pass the living room. My couch looked odd. It almost looked as though it was…breathing?

I stepped closer. Yep, it was *definitely* breathing. It made no sense. It was a couch, how could it be breathing? If I strained my ears, I could almost hear it, too - soft, wheezing breaths. It made no sense. Nothing makes much sense to me lately. I need coffee. Where did my coffee go? I was just drinking it.

I woke up this morning with a start, 2 hours before my alarm went off. I have these nightmares, you see. Terrible nightmares. Horrifying ones. Ones in which I’ve committed crimes so heinous, it makes me disgusted to think my brain could come up with stuff like that. I was sweating, and my head was throbbing. Coffee would fix this. I should make myself some coffee. I really love coffee.

I stood there in my living room, steaming mug of coffee in my hand, which was strange because I didn’t remember making it, and I don’t like coffee that much anyways. My eyes flickered back to the couch in my living room. It was still brown. Still stained. Still breathing. I took a sip of the disgusting coffee, only to spit the mouthful back into the cup, because the coffee was now ice cold. I placed the mug on a table, and walked over to the couch. Plopping down on the worn out, brown leather, I let my body sway up and down, gently, with the breathing of the couch. There was a red stain. It seemed bigger than it was the last time I saw it. It was growing. And the couch was breathing.

My phone buzzed with a notification. It was the furniture company. “We’ve received your complaint," it read, the words cold and clinical. Strange. I don’t remember making any complaints.

But that wasn’t the disturbing part. Beneath the message was an image—a photo of me, sitting on the couch, staring blankly ahead with my hand pressed to the cushion. The angle was odd, slightly off, like it was taken from the corner of the room. I hadn’t seen anyone. No one had been here. I was sure of it. It was just me and this couch. It was just us.

My pulse quickened. I glanced around the room, half-expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows, watching me. But it was just me—and the couch. Me and the couch. The couch and I. Just us.

Slowly, I looked back at the couch. The red stain had spread, darkening, seeping further into the fabric. I reached out, half dazed, and touched the stain. My fingers came away damp, and I stood up with a start, wiping my hand on my jeans. It felt sticky, almost warm. I shook my head, trying to clear the fog, but the details kept slipping, as if my mind was fighting to keep things in place.

I think I just need some coffee to clear my head.

In the kitchen, I hear my phone ring in my pocket. The water boiled on in the kettle, and I picked up the call on the 3rd ring. “Hello?”

“Mr. \[Me\], this is Detective \[Detective\] from the police department. We'd like you to come down to the station for a few questions regarding an ongoing investigation. It’s important we speak with you as soon as possible.”

That’s funny. Why was the furniture company calling me?

“Uh… yes, of course,” I stammered, trying to clear my throat, my mind still muddled. “Did you say… the police department?”

“Yes, Mr. \[Me\]. The station’s address is in the email we sent you. We expect you here in the next hour,” the voice said, with an odd, almost mechanical precision. There was a pause, and then, in a quieter tone, the detective added, “And please, don’t try to clean anything.”

The line went dead.

I poured the boiling water from the kettle into a mug. I took a sip, grimacing as I realized it tasted metallic, and thicker than it should. Don’t try to clean anything?

I walked back into the living room. My head was spinning, and I wanted nothing more than to take a nap on my couch that is definitely not breathing and not blood-stained and not alive and ready for me to nap on.

Huh. Is my couch…breathing?

There’s a red stain on it I hadn’t noticed before. I don’t know how I never noticed it, because not only does it take up half the couch, it’s also still damp. A fresh wave of nausea rolled over me. I don’t remember spilling anything. I don’t remember anything that would leave a stain like that. And yet, here it was, spreading, like a living thing, taking over the fabric inch by inch.

Gingerly, hands shaking, I reach out for the zipper on the cushion cover. Pulling it backwards, I reveal an eyeball. It blinks, and I can hear knocking on my front door, but I can’t get myself to go open it because the more I unzip, the more of the face I uncover. It blinks. Morse code. Since when do I understand morse code?

.. - --- .-.. -.. -.-- --- ..- -. --- - - --- - .-. -.-- - --- -.-. .-.. . .- -. .- -. -.-- - .... .. -. --. ·-·-·-

*I told you not to try to clean anything*, the eye says, silently.

The knocking at the door turned into pounding, and I could hear a muffled voice calling my name. I tried to call out, but my throat closed up, as if something was squeezing it from the inside. The eye slowly turned bloodshot. I was vaguely aware of the red stain growing onto my jeans.

“Mr. Me!” came a muffled voice from the door—a different voice now, deeper, angrier, as if whoever was outside was about to break the door down. “We need to talk to you about your couch's extended warranty!”

God, my head hurts. I need some coffee. I wish my wife was still around. She made the best coffee. Too bad she’s couch. I mean, dead. Too bad she’s dead.

I open the door. Its a policeman standing there, but I can tell he’s really from the furniture police. His clothes don’t fool me.

“Please,” I plead, turning my mug over and letting the coffee spill down at his feet. “My couch is breathing. You have to help me.”

The furniture couch police man tilted his head, studying me with a strange, detached look. I caught a glimpse of his badge. It didn’t say *Police Department*. Instead, it read *Customer Compliance*. Beneath it, in smaller print, was the company’s name: *Furniture Solutions, Inc.* I felt a cold sweat break over me.

“Sir,” he said, his voice calm and measured, “we’ve received several reports of unusual maintenance issues. Now, if you’ll just let me in, I’ll have a look at the couch.”

I wanted to protest, to tell him that this wasn’t a maintenance issue, that I needed real help—not a corporate lackey. But when I opened my mouth, the words wouldn’t come. Instead, I just stepped back, allowing him in.

He walked over to the couch and ran his fingers over the cushions, tracing the lines where the stain had spread. He leaned in close, inspecting it, and then—he pressed his ear to the fabric. My stomach lurched as he nodded, as if he could hear something I couldn’t.

“It’s breathing all right,” he murmured. “Classic case. You should’ve called us sooner.”

“Classic case?” I repeated, my voice cracking.

“Oh yes,” he said, straightening up. “Say, you don’t suppose I could have a cup of coffee while I’m here, do you?”

“I..” I looked up at him. It hurt to swallow. “I don’t have any coffee, sorry. Never buy it, don’t like the stuff.”

Looking visibly disappointed, he reached into his jacket and pulled out a scalpel. With a practiced motion, he began to cut along the edge of the cushion. The fabric peeled away, revealing something soft and pink and disturbingly alive beneath.

“Honey?” I couldn’t feel the words in my throat, but the voice saying them was unmistakably mine. “Oh *darling*, I missed you so much.”

I knelt down to peel the strip of black duct tape off of her lips. I noticed her wrists were raw from the rope that bound them together. I loved her so much. I almost felt as if her wrists were mine, I felt my own wrists being bound together now. That’s how strong our bond was.

Her eyes were still closed. Taking a nap, I presumed. After all, it was a very comfortable couch.

I’m gonna make her a cup of coffee for when she wakes up. Then, I can tell her all about how I was so tired this morning, I almost thought the couch was breathing.
