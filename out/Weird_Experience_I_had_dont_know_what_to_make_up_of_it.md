In my hometown nothing really happened, streets were empty for the most part, always just one person going outside their house though, going out in all black with a beanie and a puffer jacket.  
  
Surprised people don't come out more often, especially in the winter, considering our town is also very close to the city. That could explain why they don't come out now more though. The cold. But even in cold times like this they'd come out. One day I got really bored from doing all those, usual procrastinations. Playing videogames, doom-scrolling, and all that. So I went out for a walk into the city. I wore a black puffer jacket and beanie.  
  
With my left foot, I stepped into the city, but I noticed that the streets were, very absent. A few cars here and there passing by, nothing else. The shops nearby, still open. Their lights still shining with advertisements and cold nothingness. The only person I could spot was the man in charge of the Shawarma shop preparing to close down. I wasn't hungry, sadly. The sky was getting darker, pure black when I reached the park. 

The orange light that came from the light poles near the park benches reflected on the concrete beneath me. Every step I took was a step towards either the light or darkness, having to bask in both every bench I come near to or pass by. I decided to go by the swings. I sat down on one of them. A light pole nearby illuminated so I could at least stay on it without shitting myself from the dark. I lit a cigarette before swinging. The silhouette of the parks tree's and their skinny, claw-like branches were blacker than the sky only because there was a few stars in its infinite void.

For a while I swung. I stared blankly at the driveway miles and miles away from me, looking at the lights emanated from the street lights, shops and the very few cars that drove by. Melancholy. The mosque nearby started to sing. The time of prayer. The dogs howled along with it. I was in a bit of state of calm. It felt like I was in my bed even if I was just swinging. And swinging and swinging and swinging. And so I blinked.  
  
I blinked and everything around me except for the light pole and swing I was on was gone. The ground beneath me stayed the same, but now the sky engulfed me in shadow. The light pole nearby lit me up like a spotlight. For a second I just sat there on the swing, looking at my surroundings, nothing there--My heart started to race, what little comfort there was was all lost in a single blink of an eye. That's when I remembered, my phone. I got out of the swing and races to whatever pockets I had, my pants, my jacket--I felt my phone in my left pocket and took it out--my fingers were erratic, like spiders--I tried to dial up the police--No service. No service whatsoever.  
  
I was scared to scream for help, or to make any single noise. The darkness was dominating. But, I managed to muster enough courage. So, after a bit of hesitation, I yelled out.

''Hello?''   
''Is anybody there?''

No one answered. I took out my phones flashlight and tried to my best to walk into the void without scurrying back into light pole's light. I stepped into it with my right foot. Then my left.

For a second I was walking through it, step by step I was able to confront the darkness, the unknowable. A minute passed, And I started to hear things. I was paranoid, I started to hear voices calling my name, but quietly, and always cut off before they fully said it. As well as quiet and cut off screams. I decided to run.

I was terrified, I felt like I was flying with how fast my feet were going. Didn't even bother to keep my phone in place--The light coming from it was bouncing around the ground as I ran--It never revealed anything towards and beyond me no matter how hard I shined it at the darkness outside of the ground--I was running towards nothing. An empty field. The entire time I was holding in all my fear, and tears, and every guttural noise I wanted to spew out. So I finally did.

I screamed out, my voice slowly getting muffled by me gargling. I kept running to the point my feet were practically burning. So it naturally appeared.

A black ambulance appeared out of thin air and with its appearance, a loud metallic screeching car sound blasted throughout the void came with it. It shook me to my core and I fell to the ground face-first, scraping my knees, elbows, palms, face and chest--And my body--And my bones chipped--And then two men in black hazmat suits--And they dragged me with such force--They turned me, they turned me over, they beat me--They ripped my heart out--My lungs--So, so much blood, and.

I woke up on my bed in cold sweat. I went to the bathroom to take a shower cause I felt so. Dirty. I looked in the mirror after it. I looked at my chest, and saw my birthmark again. It was a bit big, covering most of my chest below my collar bone. I always wondered why It looked the way that it did. I'm not really a religious or spiritual guy so I don't think it had to do anything with the dream that I had, nightmares usually happen from time to time here and there so no I don't think it was cause of that. Even if it was that horrifying. The human body is very interesting. I have also been, staying up at 3 AM for a while now. Those energy drinks really do work after all huh.

After I got done in the shower, and got dressed, I decided to look outside my window out of boredom.  
Not a single soul outside, but a person dressed in all black, with a puffer jacket and beanie, walking down the street.
