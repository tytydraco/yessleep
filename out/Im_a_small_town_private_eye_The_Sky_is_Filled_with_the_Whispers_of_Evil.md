The corpse was dangling upside down on a pike right at the outskirts of town. With skin peeled off and fileted as a second warning, the grisly display made the otherwise scenic Pacific Northwestern forest feel weighed down with blood and sin. 

If it weren’t for the name badge dangling from the innards on the left side of the stake, identification would be impossible. Still, as I took samples from the mutilated flesh to be processed upstate, I wondered what sort of evil someone like a small town meteorologist was involved in that would make them wind up looking like chopped beef. 

“Who found the body?” I asked my contact. I didn’t want to presume that the small town lawyer had anything to do with the death, but I still treated him with suspicion. Despite the vicious circumstances that brought us together, I knew better than to presume anyone might be innocent. 

“I did. At first I considered calling local law enforcement… but honestly… well maybe we should put this all on record. I don’t want to repeat myself,” he responded as he looked down the road. It was the first time I’d noticed he was jittery since my arrival. He was turning his head toward the highway that led to the sleepy town both he and the meteorologist called home. 

“It will be. Are you saying you don’t think you can trust the Oak Peak Police Department?” I asked as I took out my pen and paper. 

Something off in the woods made a noise and the lawyer jumped, startled by it. 

“For someone that discovered a body you seem a lot more concerned about critters,” I joked. 

“Detective Balinor… only just recently moved to town myself, and ordinarily I would say that this is paranoia… but strange things have been happening a lot lately near this town. Especially in these very woods. Owls have hurt innocent people, animals have been mutilated… and now this. It’s enough to make anyone uncomfortable around here,” he responded. 

“My apologies, Mister Roland. I suppose you would have to have good reason to call me, this is definitely not your everyday homicide,” I commented as we walked away from the crime scene.

“So you think it was murder?” the attorney asked, his eyes wide and fearful. 

“No animal could have done this. It was a deliberate warning. That means we need to start digging into this young woman’s life. Find out who were friends, who were her enemies. Everything eventually comes out in the wash,” I told him. 

Roland nodded anxiously, giving me a business card before getting in his car driving off. 

I considered dropping it on the ground and calling the police against his wishes. For all I knew, he was the culprit leading me down a path that would wind up as a dead end. 

But something deep inside me told me that there was a deeper story here, not just to the murder but to this sleepy town. I started toward my car once the attorney rolled away. 

 My partner finished taking photos, jumping from her hunched position behind a bush and commenting, “We aren’t going to just leave the body hanging there, are we boss?” 

“Afraid we don’t have a choice Fran, besides which I’m sure local police will find it soon enough whether or not we want them to. This highway is the only way in or out. The south side splits and winds around some old lake, and then circles back to here.” 

“So what’s the next move then?” she asked getting in the car. 

“I saw a small bed and breakfast near the base of the mountain, we can get a room and then start asking around town what people knew about this Chloé Cladise.”

“That’s her name? Sounds phony,” my partner remarked. 

“Everyone thinks your name is fake too Tess Thornson, doesn’t mean it is,” I pointed out. 

“Point taken,” she conceded.

It took the local yokels a full day to find Chloé’s remains, but during those fresh feverish hours I found out quite a bit about Oak Peak’s favorite weather girl. Although it became quickly apparent that there were some inconsistencies. 

First off, no one seemed to be quite sure where she actually lived. The owners of the bed and breakfast Tess and I checked in at seemed quite convinced they had seen her as a guest a few times, yet she has always paid in cash. The diner she frequently ate at said she lived in a nearby culdesac but neither of the cooks could agree on which one. A garbageman claimed she was homeless. 

One thing that was abundantly clear: Chloé liked her privacy, and she wa devoted her job. 

An antique store owner that Tess talked to said that Chloé had faithfully given weather reports to the town every week for as long as she could remember. 

Another inconsistency cropped up when we went to the facility where these broadcasts came from. The radio station had no record of her being there either and the DJ claimed that she had always been working out of her van. 

“It’s starting to sound like our weather girl had a lot of secrets,” Tess said that first evening as we compared notes. 

“She was running from something, the question is what. I wish that someone around here knew her better,” I commented. 

“For a small town where everyone claims they know everyone else, no one really knew her,” Tess quipped. 

“That’s the problem with places like this. They think they have their neighbors figured out but all of us are wearing masks essentially. And from what Mister Roland has told us, there seems to be a bit of small town corruption happening here,” I told her. 

We confirmed that on the second day of our investigation when a local tarot shop owner called the cops on us just for eating some waffles. 

“Sorry to do this to ya folks, it’s just we don’t get many visitors around here,” the sheriff told us as they checked our ID. 

“Did we really stand out that much?” Tess asked as she sipped her coffee. 

“What brings you here?” he said, ignoring her question. 

“We’re friends of Chloé. We came for a visit but no one here seems to know where she is,” I offered. 

“Not everyone is the trusting type around these parts. And we got our fair share of problems just like anywhere else. Take me for example, new to the job. Oak Peak can’t seem to keep a good sheriff,” the man joked as he passed our licenses back. 

“And some people forget they aren’t the sheriff anymore. Roscoe,” a new voice chimed in from across the bar. It was a middle aged woman with dark red hair and brown eyes. She looked pissed. 

“Well don’t let us interrupt your political battle,” I said, getting ready to leave. 

“These out of towners are searching for our weather girl. Doing more than you, I’d say,” the man who’d claimed to be the sheriff responded. 

“Roscoe if I find you pretending to be a law man again I’ll haul you in myself,” she told him icily. 

“You ain’t got a right to wear that badge. You’re a phony. And soon now the same fate that falls on all false prophets will befall you!” Roscoe shouted as he left the diner. 

The real sheriff offered a half hearted apology. “I think cabin fever is a little stronger in small towns like this.” 

“Oak Peak has a history of strange occurrences,” she added as she offered her business card and left us to finish the meal. 

Her odd remarks and the encounter itself made us decide to do a bit of digging, and before you knew it we were cascading down a rabbit hole of weird news articles. 

Like so many other small towns across America, it became clear that Oak Peak thrived off of tourism, and the only way they seemed to be able to make that stick was with bizarre tabloid experiences across the town. 

Despite the unusual nature of the news we found, a few things seemed to add up; such as the sheriff being replaced on a consistent basis just like the former one had said. Another thing that connected a few dots was how wild and remote the mountain near town was. Not a single accurate map seemed to exist and there was also apparently a federal building near the area for reasons unknown. 

And there was frequent weird weather too, most of which oddly enough wasn’t what Chloé ever reported about. The storms would pop up unexpectedly and disappear just as frequently with no rhyme or reason. Was this somehow connected to her gruesome demise? With all of these loose threads at our disposal, I hardly knew where to begin if I’m being honest. 

“We might find ourselves stuck in this small town for longer than we anticipated,” I told Tess as we waited for the attorney at the diner again. Despite the fact that the sheriff now vouched for us, I felt that a lot more of the patrons to the restaurant were watching us. 

“I figured. I got us a room for the next few days, but this check better clear or I’m hightailing it out of here,” Tess said as she texted her brother. 

“Walt asking for cash again?” I asked. 

“Nah. I asked him to do a bit of research. Did you know before 2022 Chloé Cladise has absolutely no digital presence? Almost like she didn’t exist,” Tess said passing her phone to me. 

I glanced at the data and passed it back. “Okay, but we also know that this town is a relatively private place. So maybe she came here to keep under the radar.”

“Or like I said it’s a fake name,” Tess said. 

Roland entered the diner with his briefcase and suit like he was on his way to court. “Sorry I’m late. Had a job interview. Here’s that check. Have you got anything on our weather girl yet?” 

“Only that she was very good at keeping her life hidden from anyone here. Do you know if she was trying to investigate something?” I asked. 

“Not really. But I did hear some chatter over the radio this morning. They found her van near the lake. I’m guessing that means our killer wanted the police to search in the wrong place,” he said and passed me a print off of all of Chloé’s online activity. 

“Looks like she was heading to the woods to rendezvous with someone… probably the same person that killed her,” i paused as I looked at the weird hatch in the side of a hill. 

“Do you know where that might be?”

“No but I know someone who should.”

_________

The “someone” our attorney claimed knew the woods like the back of his hand was actually a homeless man that said his name was Tom. 

“Of course I know the place. I know all the places that need to be known,” he said as he crawled out of his little shack like a hermit crab. 

“Can you take us there?”

“and what’s in it for me?”

I sighed and offered him a hundred bucks but that just made the wanderer laugh. “You see how I live? Money is imaginary. Give me what’s real.” 

“I don’t have anything else.” 

“Sure you do. Everyone does. Especially around here. There’s a price that must always be paid,” Tom cackled. 

“Information? I think you’ll find I’m sorely lacking. Besides, anything I tell you about myself wouldn’t benefit you.” 

“Then why would I tell you the truth about the woman who called herself Chloé Cladise?” 


This made me take a pause because I hadn’t divulged anything to the stranger, and immediately I felt uneasy. This crazy old man knew more than he led us to believe. 

“Do you know what happened to her?”

“The forest whispers to me,” Tom responded. 

“And what does it say?”

“Payment first,” he grinned. 

I sighed, trying to think of what I could offer this insane vagabond. 

We stared at each other for a long time before I felt that uncomfortable sensation in my body again and I said something that I didn’t anticipate saying. 

“I think I have been to this town before.”

Almost on cue, Tom’s eyes glistened like fire and he smiled a gnarly grin. “And you will be here again.” 

He reached behind his back and pulled out old cow skin and what looked like a piece of coal and started to create a map of the mountain around us. As he did, it sounded like he was babbling nonsense. 

When he was done and showed us the path that our weather girl had clearly taken I couldn’t help but notice that the pattern resembled an eye of some kind. It was hypnotic to look at. 

I took it and was about to leave when Tom stood up and told me he had something else for me. 

He came back with what looked like the remnants of skin; perhaps even from the crime scene itself. “How did you get this?” I asked. 

“I hear the whispers. The sky is full of them. If you listen you can hear them too. Eventually they will start screaming,” he responded. 

I gave Tess a look as we made our leave before things got even weirder. 

To our surprise though, as we returned to our vehicle; the police were waiting. 

“Somehow I knew that you were a private investigator,”a deputy remarked as he finished running our license plates. 

“Colton Balinor, that’s a peculiar name. You from around here?” he asked. 

Before I could respond, all of us heard a loud noise somewhere in the woods. Like a machine transformer blowing up. It was enough to make the officers raise their weapons and think that it was coming from us. 

“What the hell was that?” The sheriff asked anxiously. Something about the noise also rang familiar. It was giving me a headache. 

The noise became a little louder and the officers seemed transfixed, pointing their weapons first to me and then toward each other. 

“Whoa. Lower your weapons all of you,” the sheriff ordered. 

The noise got louder again and from the forest I saw a familiar face, the man who’d claimed to be the sheriff from the diner. His eyes looked as black as night and I was certain the noise we were hearing was coming from him. 

“I warned you before. Your falsehoods will come to light,” he snarled. 

The deputies pointed their weapon toward the sheriff and I pounced into action, screaming for her to duck. We fell to the ground together and the officers wound up shooting each other. 

Tess tried to keep up with us as we reached our car for safety, the sheriff shouted that we needed to leave. But the noise had died off as quickly as it had arrived and so had the man that had caused the chaos in the first place. As we drove away from the bizarre scene, I found myself catching my breath. 

“I see what you mean about sheriffs having short terms.” I was trying to joke, but honestly I was scared out of my mind. I had no idea what I had just witnessed. 

We didn’t stop driving until we made it back to the bed and breakfast and the sheriff made a call to the federal outpost. 

I washed up, still shaking from the supernatural event; and asked the woman what we were expected to do now. 

“Leave town for all I care. Actually, no. Don’t do that. I have a feeling that whatever happened to Chloé is just the beginning… but it’s out of your control and mine too. The Feds are taking over the case immediately.” 

“Did you tell them about your predecessor somehow gaining mind powers and trying to kill all of us?” I asked. 

“They wouldn’t believe me even if I did. Look, do whatever you want. Just keep a low profile. I don’t need to dig more graves this week,” the sheriff responded as she grabbed her things. 

Tess and I said nothing, frightened and overwhelmed by the thought that there might be forces beyond our control at play here. 

“That check the lawyer gave us can keep us here for quite a while boss… but I’m starting to think we’ve worn out our welcome,” Tess told me in the morning. 

I wasn’t listening though, I was looking at the blood that was smeared on our motel room wall, seemingly appearing from thin air. 

It’s message haunted and puzzled me because it told me that this place had a hold on me I didn’t understand. 

OAK PEAK WELCOMES YOU BACK

And I knew it meant the worst was yet to come
