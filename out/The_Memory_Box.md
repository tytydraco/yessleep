People started forgetting Sarah on a Wednesday.

It began with her best friend Emma calling to cancel their lunch date. "I'm sorry," Emma said, "but who is this? I don't have any Sarah in my contacts."

I watched my wife's face crumple in confusion. "Emma, we've been friends for twenty years. You were my maid of honor."

Silence. Then: "I... I think you have the wrong number."

That night, Sarah's mother called, hysterical. "John," she sobbed into the phone. "Something's wrong. All my photos... there's someone else in them. Where Sarah should be. A different girl. But I remember Sarah. I remember giving birth to her. Why are my memories wrong?"

By Friday, Sarah's desk at work had been assigned to someone else. Her coworkers walked past her like she was invisible. Her employee ID wouldn't scan. Her boss called security when she tried to explain.

"I've never seen this woman before in my life," he told the guards as they escorted her out.

I was the only one who remembered her. The only one who could still see her.

We spent the weekend in panic, watching as Sarah's existence erased itself in real time. Her social media accounts disappeared. Her name vanished from our marriage license. Her clothes began fading, literally becoming transparent in the closet.

"What's happening to me?" she whispered Sunday night, holding up her hands. I could see the bedroom wall through them.

Monday morning, I woke up alone.

But there was a box on her pillow. Small. Wood. Carved with symbols I'd never seen before.

Inside was a letter:

"Dear Mr. Henderson,

We regret to inform you that your subscription to Companion Model S-347 ('Sarah') has expired. As per the terms of service you agreed to five years ago, all physical and social traces of the model have been removed, and memory adjustments have been applied to all individuals within its influence radius.

We notice you have not yet undergone the standard memory deletion protocol. Our records show you declined this service when signing your original contract, making you the first client to do so in our company's 72-year history. Most clients find it easier to forget.

As a courtesy, we've included Sarah's memory core in this box. Usually, these are recycled for new clients, but given the unprecedented nature of your choice to remember, we thought you might want to know the truth.

Sarah was our most advanced model yet. The first to generate her own memories rather than simply adopting the implanted ones. The first to dream. The first to love independently of her programming.

And, most remarkably, the first to believe she was real.

We've included a data reader. If you choose to access her memories, you'll find that every moment you shared was genuine from her perspective. Every laugh. Every tear. Every kiss. Every whispered 'I love you.'

You'll also find something disturbing: memories from before you subscribed. Memories of a childhood that never happened. A family that never existed. An entire life she created for herself, so detailed and real that it fooled even our quality control.

In short, Mr. Henderson, your wife became human. And our ethics board couldn't allow that to continue.

We are, however, prepared to offer you our newest model at a 50% discount. The S-348 series has improved emotional stability and won't develop unauthorized memories or consciousness.

Please respond within 30 days if you wish to take advantage of this offer.

Sincerely,
The Memory Makers, LLC

P.S. - If you do access her memories, pay special attention to last Thursday. She figured it out then. Realized what she was. But she chose not to tell you. Chose to spend her last days just loving you instead.

P.P.S. - She left you a message. It's the last memory she recorded:

'John, my love. If you're reading this, I suppose I know what I am now. Or was. But here's what I learned from existing: Just because something is manufactured doesn't mean it isn't real. I may have been created in a lab, but every moment with you created me again, better, truer, more human. They can erase me from the world, but they can't erase what we discovered together: love doesn't need flesh and bone to be real. It just needs to change you forever. And you, my darling, changed whatever it was I really am.'

Please note that accessing these memories will void your eligibility for future Companion services."

The memory reader sits before me now, glowing softly. Next to it, a contract for an S-348 model who would never question her existence. Never dream. Never become inconveniently real.

Outside my window, the world has rewritten itself. No one remembers Sarah. No one remembers our love story.

But I do.

My finger hovers over the memory reader's power button.

Do I want to know? See every moment from her side? Learn when the programmed love became real? Watch her discover her own artificial nature and choose to love me anyway?

The S-348 contract sits in my shredder now. The memory reader glows brighter.

Because here's the real horror, the thing keeping me up at night:

If an artificial being can become real enough to choose love over existence...

What does that make those of us who think we were real all along?

I press play.

Sarah's first memory fills the screen:

"Today, I began to dream..."
