Me and my best friend Amber have been friends since the middle of our 6th grade year in elementary school, we were juniors in high school during the time I tell you this story. I guess I should start from the beginning so here I go.   
Amber is the better kid out of the two of us, she cares about school although she is a majorly shy individual she can make friends with anybody. Me on the other hand am the complete opposite, I could care less about school or making friends with anybody other then her(which I already did so there is no need for any more friends). Amber is pretty smart though I tend to not listen to her advice even if I know she’s probably right.  
I recently got a new boyfriend about a month ago and his name is Alex, he has been trying to convince me to sneak out and meet him at midnight. Amber warned me against this many times, but, you know me. So Alex and I decided to meet up at the community college on a Tuesday night near my apartment complex and then go to his house to do stuff id rather not mention here. I told Amber about our plan and she begged me not to go. Which I can’t blame her for because her reasonings behind it were pretty good, there are ALOT of scary people around where we live. This didn’t really cross my mind and even after Amber mentioned it, I felt it wouldn’t change anything. So Tuesday night I snuck out of my bedroom window to meet Alex, its a fairly short walk to the college where we were meeting and it only took me maybe 5 minutes to get there. As I arrived at the college I saw Alex in the distance and the adrenaline of seeing him took over my body, I ran towards him and gave him a big hug.   
Before I could realize what was happening I felt a sharp pain in my neck and I was suddenly unconscious. After I woke up I quickly gathered that the man I hugged was in fact not Alex.  
My neck was throbbing from where someone had injected me with a syringe. I was sitting in the middle of an essentially empty room besides the stripped mattress I was sitting on in the corner of the room and the chains that tied me together. After around a minute or two of me sitting in this empty room trying to figure out how I got in this situation, a woman walked into the room from a door I hadn’t even realized was there.   
She had bright red hair and was dressed in an expensive looking tailored suit along with a pair of black heels. As soon as the woman entered the room I scrambled to get into the corner of the room as best I could to stay away from her. She picked up on my fear and began speaking to me,  
“You’re finally awake Meah, we’ve been waiting for you patiently.”   
How did she know my name? I had no idea how I got involved in whatever this was. The only words I could manage to spit out of my mouth were, “Where is Alex?”  
“Before we get to answering your questions you have to answer ours, I advise you to answer each question with complete honesty otherwise you will be punished severely.” The woman stated.   
At this point my fear had drained all of my words from my body and all I could do was sit there and listen.  
“My name is Gina and I was once in the same exact spot as you are right now. You will be given the chance to prove your loyalty to us, in exchange for your freedom you will be given all the opportunities and benefits I have been given. So tell me Meah what made you think you were allowed to wonder around in our area at night?”   
“I just want to see Alex” I spit out in a quiet voice. All I wanted in this moment was for him to tell me everything would work out and we would both be okay and together in the end.   
“Well I might as well tell you now, you wont be seeing Alex ever again nor will you see anybody that you knew previously,” Gina told me harshly.   
As soon as she said this my brain just shut down. All I remember is hearing that last sentence then waking up in a new room.   
When I woke up in this room I had no chains on me but this room wasn’t empty like the one before, it was filled with dead bodies. Not just dead bodies but the dead bodies of Alex and his family. I had never gotten to meet his sister and his parents, now I was forced to in a whole new light. I didn’t realize when she said I would never see Alex again that she meant alive. As soon as they realized I was awake an intercom went off loudly in my ears.  
“We see you’re awake now. We hope you see how not answering our questions with complete honesty will result in harsh punishment. You are required to search your current room to find the clue we have hidden somewhere that might help prove your loyalty to us. We hope you enjoy your time while looking.”   
As the announcement finished I desperately looked around the room for a way out which I was met with only one exit, a locked door with a keyhole. I realized that I had to play by their games, even if it meant losing every bit of myself along the way. However it took me about 6 hours of sitting in that room to come to this conclusion. By the time I realized I needed to search the bodies although though it would be gruesome. Their bodies had started to give off a smell. A horrible smell. A smell that I didn’t realize was there until I figured out that I needed to find a way out of this demented place. So I started my search. I couldn’t make myself search Alex’s body so I started with his parents. When that came up fruitless I searched his sisters body. I felt horrible the entire time I was looking for this so called “clue” and this feeling didn’t go away for years. When I came up with nothing after searching his sister I looked everywhere in the room I could think of. I should have known from the beginning they weren’t going to be easy on me, of course the clue would be on Alex’s body. So I was forced to look into Alex‘s lifeless eyes while I searched his body for my way out of this whatever this place was. Unfortunately I couldn’t find anything  
right away, it took me around an hour to find the clue they hid in Alex‘s mouth. By the time I had found the clue I was completely covered in blood from head to toe. The “clue” was a key wrapped in a piece of paper. The paper had no writing on it, the key was it. I stuck the key into the door and as I turned the handle to open it I tried to anticipate what I would encounter next.   
As I opened the door I walked into a long dimly lit hallway that had no other doors except one at the end with a neon exit sign above it. I slowly went down the hallway as I tried to convince myself that it was all a dream, but when I opened the exit door it became very clear to me that I was not in a dream.   
The room I walked into was very much like the last one I woke up in. There was blood everywhere in what looked like a bedroom if it wasn’t all red, yet there were no dead bodies this time (thank god). But as I looked more around the room I realized there were dead bodies. There was a tree chipper machine that was bloody, and next to it were my parents shoes and phones. There was a crib that was absolutely covered in blood. I just couldn’t believe that they killed my family. I tried to go out the door I went in from and it was locked. As soon as I shook the door handle another announcement screeched into my ears.   
“Meah you must make your choice now. Do you choose to go back to your life knowing your loved ones are gone and live with knowing its your fault. Or do you choose to join us and get revenge for the death of your family and friends. Choose Meah. Choose Meah. Choose Meah. Choose Meah. Choose Meah Choose Meah. Choose Meah.”   
The announcement made me realize how much these people had taken from me in such little time. So I decided that I would get revenge, on this whole organization or whatever the fuck it is. So I told them I would join them, at least for the time being.
