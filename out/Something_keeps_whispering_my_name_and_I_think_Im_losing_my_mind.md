Hi all. My (M26) name isn’t really important.

Knowing it isn’t going to change anything. I’m pretty much fucked either way, so I’m just posting this here for an official record. Yeah, I know the story is about something that won’t quit whispering my name, but you really, really do not need to know what my name is.

No.

Quit asking.

Okay, fine.

Just so you feel better, my name is Harry Gloriole. 

Yeah, you read that right. Like fucking “glory hole.” Go ahead and laugh. I’ve already heard all the jokes, and yes, everyone called me exactly what you'd expect when I was growing up. I hate my parents, and I hate the wonderful wizarding world that gave me my first name even more. I’ve had twenty six years of hell.

Anyway, I recently bought a shitty house on the shitty side of a small town I just moved to. It’s still recovering from some factory closing up shop so the homes are pretty cheap still, even in 2025 money. I had a rather embarrassing accident at a fast food restaurant I won’t name and settled out of court for a not insubstantial sum of money. All I can legally say is that I’ll never look at ice cream machines, salt shakers, and accidentally ripped pants the same way again. I’ll leave it to your imagination.

Anyway, the house. It’s not great, but it’s what I could afford after paying off my student loans. It used to be the office of a private investigator type who randomly left town one day with one of the nuns from the local Catholic church. It was apparently a minor scandal at the time, but the incident with James Cartwright and his cow happened about a week later and everyone forgot about it. 

I’ve probably said too much. People doing unspeakably violating things to dead livestock with tannerite on New Year’s Eve is unfortunately a yearly tradition around here now. I wish I’d known that before I moved here. Whatever you’re imagining, I can guarantee it’s worse. 

Small town America, everyone. People go insane when there’s nothing better to do. 

The zoo an hour from here had an elephant pass away last month, and all the local churches took up an offering to buy it and freeze it for this year’s ass blasting. I’ve tried calling the ASPCA, and they didn’t believe me. It was almost as embarrassing as the time the suicide hotline operator put me on hold back in high school.

Wow I got off topic. Sorry. Kinda stream of consciousness-ing this intro here. Haven’t slept in a few days. Not just because of the voices in the or anything, just an insomniac. The worst was once when I went a full six days without sleep just to turn around and sleep for three. In a way, being the one person who ended up in an emergency room that actually did slip and fall and get something stuck in their ass (unfortunately, there were thirteen witnesses) was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me. I can actually afford the medication to fix my brain now and the doctor says that in a couple weeks when I level out I might even get a full eight hours for the first time in ten years.

But yeah, it’s not just the insomnia. The voices are a problem too. Specifically a single voice. It’s a man’s voice, about middle aged, maybe a bit higher pitched. It keeps whispering my name. It all started three nights ago, when I finally broke down the door to the room the private investigator used as his office. The house has been abandoned since the private investigator left town, so the door was firmly jammed shut. 

God I fucking hate realtors. For the rest of you looking to buy a house in the event that you also win the saltshaker-up-the-ass lottery, apparently realtors don’t have to disclose that the house was used for a Satanic ritual. That’s the sort of thing you apparently have to ask about. I knew I shouldn’t have cheaped out and skipped hiring a building inspector.

Fortunately, after forty years the dead goat in the middle of the ritual circle in the center of the room had more or less evaporated so there wasn’t a smell, but I’ll still have to buy new carpet. Even if there wasn’t a pile of bones with a rusty knife sticking in them in the middle of an old bloodstain, the fucker had spraypainted his pentagram on the goddamn floor and burned the candles without plates underneath them to catch the wax. The carpet was ruined. Some people have no class. If you’re going to do unspeakable things to a goat to summon a demon with the nun you’re sleeping with, do it in the woods like a normal person.

Anyway, I finally kicked the door in and looked around the room. As soon as I stepped into the pentagram, all of the candles lit themselves and the symbols written on the walls in 40 year old blood caught fire. I suppose that would have scared most people, but I dropped a lot of acid in college. I’ve seen worse in my cereal bowl. 

My reaction went something like this: “Ohfuckohfuckohfuck there’s a fire ohfuckohfuckohfuck and I just bought this house!”

I tore out of the room and ran for the kitchen. I don’t trust my new 40 year old gas stove, so I keep two fire extinguishers beside it. I’m also not on good speaking terms with the local fire department after- well it’s not really relevant to the story.

Anyway, I got the fire out and suddenly the house shook. A deep voice boomed “LEAVE NOW!”

I did what any self respecting homeowner would do in 2025. “Do you know how expensive houses are? Where the hell else am I supposed to go?”

Objects started floating. “LEAVE NOW, HARRY GLORIOLE!”

It was kind of hard to take the ghost or demon or whatever-the-fuck seriously. I mean, my name is basically ‘hairy glory hole.’ Even I laugh at it sometimes, when I’m feeling more cynical than usual.

“Make me, fucker,” I said angrily. “My name’s on the deed.”

“YOU WILL LEAVE THIS HOUSE, HARRY GLORIOLE.”

“And I told you, I bought this house.”

“I WILL SHOW YOU UNSPEAKABLE AGONY-”

The voice cut out and I put out the fires, again. The voice cleared its throat. It spoke again at a normal volume with what I can only assume was minor secondhand embarrassment. “Your name is ‘Harry Gloriole?’”

I knew where this was going. “What about it?”

“Harry Gloriole? Your parents actually named you that?”

“Yeah.”

“I’m so sorry. Harry Glori-”

The voice burst out laughing, shaking the house. I put the fires out again. 

“Sorry,” managed the demon between roars of laughter. “I can’t think of anything worse I could do to you. Harry Gloriole!” 

That was three days ago. The demon laughed for a full hour before he calmed himself down. Ever since, he’s been infrequently whispering my name. He snickers every time he says it. It’s getting fucking annoying. It’s been three days. He won’t quit giggling and whispering my name, and it’s driving me crazy.

I’m not leaving my house. I paid good money for it. All the same, I’m going to feed myself a bullet soon if I don’t get some peace and quiet.

How can I make him shut the fuck up?

Please reddit, I’m desperate.
