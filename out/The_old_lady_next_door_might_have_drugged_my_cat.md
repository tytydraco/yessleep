It's 3 in the morning and I can't sleep.

For the past hour or so I've been laying in bed trying to ignore the soft, frantic scrabbling of tiny claws with an occasional thump mixed in. These noises are a little easier to ignore than the muffled sobbing coming through the wall from the apartment next door. God, I hope that's not because of me.

Sweet Pea has never been the most energetic cat. She's usually curled up in front of the hall closet napping, when she isn't giving me judgmental stares from around a doorway. I don't know how such a small creature can be so haughty, somehow looking down a nose only four inches from the floor. She didn't even run around the place when we first moved in a couple of months ago. Something must have happened to her today, and I think I might know what it was.

Earlier today when I had just gotten home from work I found the door unlocked. Inside I found a diminutive older woman who appeared to be dressed as a rodeo clown's lawyer crouching down over Sweet Pea with a small plastic bag of handmade treats. I'm sure to most people something like that might be shocking, an event that joins the reliable old party stories like "The time I thought my dog was a pile of laundry" for decades to come, but for me it was just Thursday. My landlord Ruth has a little issue with boundaries. 

She's the kind of woman who, in theory, might be lovely to be around in tiny doses. She brings over trays of delicious homemade pastries and cookies that always seem to disappear faster than you think should be possible. She listens to you talk with eyes open wide, bulging behind her thick rhinestone rimmed glasses, heart open even wider.

But it was the third time this week I had come home to find her in my apartment. The third time this week a surprise social interaction was sprung on me when all I wanted to do was kick off my Customer Service Voice at the door and not think about how one day a robot will be able talk to people better than I do.

"Goddamnit Ruth, why are you here when I'm not?"

She jolted upright with a cry like an extinct bird's mating call, knocking the single dining room chair over with her prodigious backside. Sweet Pea tore out of the kitchen like her ass was on fire, bringing down a tower of old pizza boxes in an uncontrolled demolition. Ruth sheepishly kicked a couple of pizza bones into a pile and swiped surprisingly steady hands down the front of her neon fuchsia pantsuit as she hit me with the full force of her $50,000 smile. The cacophonous rattling of her many plastic arm bangles was drowned out by her voice, as soft as a buzzsaw and twice as loud.

"Oh darling I thought I would just poke my head in and tidy up a tad, and then I couldn't just not say hello to Sweet Pea! Oh isn't she just a darling you know I had one just like her except he only had three legs, this was way back in, oh, yes I think it was-"

"You can't keep coming in here when I'm not home, Ruth."

"Well why not? It's my gosh darn building! I'm here offering my services at no extra charge, to boot! I cook, I clean, I'm pretty nifty with a screwdriver and hammer, I can conversate with the best of 'em! Heck, just the other day-"

"It's against the law?"

"The law!" She threw her head back and cackled deeply, lime green fingernails clutching at her midsection as she leaned back against the sink. "Well according to Johnny Law you're just a friend who stays over a lot and helps with the light bill sometimes! I know you don't mean it anyhow, you know if you tell me to get out I'll just up and skedaddle! Come on now Jack, I'm just trying to make a connection. You like me, dont you, Jack? I just want to help my tenants, what's so gosh darn bad about that? Look, the sink is absolutely crawling with ants, this place could sure as heckfire use a woman's touch every now and then!"

I stormed over to the faucet and opened the hot water handle full blast, swiftly and decisively washing the horde of tiny, squirming bugs down the drain. In a way, I felt bad for them. They were just living their little lives, oblivious that in an instant I would decide to wash it all away. Ruth was silent as I enacted my ant genocide and when I turned around afterwards she wore a strange expression I couldn't place on her pinched, leathery face. I thought I was being a bit harsh at the time, but sometimes you kind of have to be to get your damn alone time.

"There, no more ants. No more ants, no more Ruth. Get the fuck out. Please."

If I had hurt her feelings she recovered quickly, once again blinding me with a smile far too big for her face. Getting hit with that at point blank is like realizing the light at the end of the tunnel is the reflection of your flashlight on a sleek metal cowcatcher bearing down on you.

"I can tell you're having a tough day darling so I'll get out of your hair, the last thing I want is you closing yourself off to me like some of the other tenants. I'll be back another time when you're ready to grab a bag and a broom! Please give Sweet Pea my love, and tell her she's the prettiest most-" 

Sometimes you have to end her sentences for her so I cut her off there with a winning smile of my own, one forged through many years of serving the public. For maximum effect I squinted my eyes the same way she did. Most people subconsciously enjoy being mirrored, it makes them feel like they're not alone. 

"Okay, thanks Ruth, bye!" I shouted as I shooed her away from the door and finally she began trundling her way to the elevator. Her thick, square heels portend her looming approach and I pictured the townspeople shuttering their shades in fear that she may darken their doorstep.

Before I could flee to the safety of my nest I turned around to see my neighbor from the other side of the apartment, Darla. Though she had a smirk on her mousey face and a bottle of whiskey in her hands I could also see that her little black tee shirt was inside out and her mascara was running.

"Hey Jagoff. I see you just survived Hurricane Ruth, wanna forget your troubles?" 

She tilted her head and looked up at me with bright blue eyes that were swimming as her chipped nails played a beat on the glass bottle. I knew that turning her down would just have her crying and throwing things at the wall all night and I was so tired I almost did anyways. I figured with any luck, she would be passed out on the couch in twenty minutes and I could finally get to relaxing.

Today is just not my lucky day.

If she had any comments about the state of my apartment she mercifully kept them to herself, collapsing into the couch like a crumbling ruin as she eagerly unscrewed the bottle. We didn't talk much, thankfully, merely passing the bottle back and forth as we stared blankly at the flickering glow of the TV. Something was clearly bothering her but she didn't want to say, and I didn't want to ask. In a way, it was nice to let all of my thoughts slide out of my head like a cracked egg and just exist.

Eventually, the bottle ran dry. Then the unopened bottle of rum I had stashed in the back of the cabinet ran dry, too. I don't remember what we said as she stumbled out the door. As my hand fell from the knob and I turned around I thought I saw her keyring sitting on the coffee table.

In retrospect, perhaps the way I threw open the door was a bit dramatic, but whatever I had been planning to say was shocked out of me when I saw Darla was still standing there. I turned to look inside to restart my train of thought but the bare top of the table gave me nothing. In hindsight, I had probably been looking at a giant cockroach with my bleary eyes the first time. When I turned back to look at her my swimming mind once again struggled to convey anything. It's supposed to be my job to communicate with people, it was downright shameful.

Whatever I had been trying to communicate, she got a different signal. I won't bore you with the details, for my sake more than yours. The only pertinent ones are that it was unfortunately short, I'm a bit out of practice it seems, and that she was never out of my sight the whole time. Well, we both had our eyes closed for most of it, but you get what I mean. She was probably thinking of someone else, too.

When we were finished I made the worst mistake of all, I tried to be funny.

"Hey, try not to forget your keys this time."

I think I was setting up some lame pun but I never got that far. She burst into tears and immediately started grabbing her clothes, turning her face away as I tried to explain.

"No, wait, I wasn't saying you should leave. I just-"

She cut me off with a harsh hand gesture, still facing away. Her reply came in a warbling, artificially cheery voice.

"No, no, I know that. I just suddenly remembered s-something and I have to go check on it right now."

She sniffled loudly and pulled her clothes on with jerky motions, slowly making her way towards the door. Just before she walked out she turned and did her level best at a smile that looked like a chalk sidewalk drawing in a downpour.

"This was... um... nice. Maybe we can hang another time. Sorry I made it so weird."

She was out the door before I could correct her, and it wasn't a full minute before I heard her softly crying through the wall.

It was getting pretty late by that point so I filled up Sweet Pea's bowl, only briefly stopping to note that she hadn't immediately come sauntering up to judge me through half-lidded eyes, and headed to bed. I should have probably checked her litter box but I was exhausted, and had a pretty good idea that Ruth had made it her first stop.

I haven't seen Sweet Pea all night since I caught Ruth feeding her homemade treats.

Suddenly, a blood curdling scream echoes through the wall, followed by several impacts of smashing glass. I it up motionless in bed for long seconds, struggling to listen for any signs of life over the maddening scrabbling coming from my kitchen. My heart races a mile a minute as I slowly climb out of bed, taking a step towards the wall I shared with Darla. I almost jump clear out of my skin when a crashing sound rings out from my kitchen.

Sweet Pea must have knocked over a mug.

I cross the distance to the wall swiftly, leaving behind a string of mumbled curses I'd rather not repeat here. I press my ear to the wall to listen for signs of life from next door but that only seems to amplify the frantic scratching sounds, the wall somehow picking up the vibrations. Eventually I hear the sobbing pick up again and I breathe a sigh of relief. I'm not going to say she's okay, but at least she's alive over there.

The door to my bedroom makes a soft clicking noise when I turn the handle and the scratching sounds immediately stop. Swallowing hard I open the door and slowly step into the silent stillness. I had forgotten to turn the TV off and the input screen bathes the room in a cool blue, casting harsh shadows across discarded cardboard and half empty plastic bags. The room is as still as you always hope a grave will be.

The compressor in the AC kicks on and a small styrofoam cup clatters to the floor, making my eyes dart to the sink. On the floor below the tiny white cup lazily rolls back and forth in a small field of shiny ceramic shards. The air from the vent must have knocked over the styrofoam, but the mug?

Sweet Pea knows better than to run around on the counter.

I'm tempted to leave the mess for later but I know I'll be stepping in it when I make my morning coffee, plus it could be dangerous to the eight pound cat that lives in the bottom half-foot of my apartment.

I was walking past the sink to grab the broom when I heard the light creak of a stealthy step on a loose laminate floor tile. When I turn to look I see a dark shape dart out of view under the couch and instinctively take a step back, holding in a scream by biting my lip almost as deep as the shards of my favorite mug bite into my heel. The mess can wait, I need to get ahold of that goddamned cat before she gives me a heart attack.

I want to go pluck the broken chunks of ceramic in the bathroom but for some reason I can't bring myself to walk past the sofa.

"Sweet Pea? Come on girl, come out."

I feel stupid calling to her like that, especially as the silence that answered hangs heavily in the air. She's as likely to come when I call as she is to climb up onto my lap, we just don't have that kind of relationship. I hoped that at least she would move or something, give me some indication that she was alive.

Anxiety digs it's long fingers deep into the back of my skull and squeezes my mind tight as I struggle to dismiss the dark thoughts hemming me in. She's just acting weird. Maybe she caught that roach I saw earlier and doesn't want to talk with her mouth full. Maybe the mug had landed on her head and she lay dying under the couch right now, grey sludge trickling down the sides of her tiny face as she watches what's supposed to be her caretaker tremble in fear and do nothing.

I take a deep breath in to calm my nerves, and almost immediately I can feel the grip of anxiety loosen. Being careful not to bump the shrapnel in my heel I slowly lower myself to the floor to peer underneath the couch. I should have turned on the light, it's pitch black under there and cluttered with old plastic wrappers and long lost socks. 

Jesus, I need to clean up a bit sometime. I know it's been getting bad, I know I have to clean it up at some point, but I just never seem to have the energy. Putting on the Fake Smile Voice all day to deal with entitled rich assholes is exhausting, by the time I get home I just want to sink into the sofa and forget about the day.

Crawling towards the couch on my hands and knees I think I see movement so I lean down and stick my arm under, turning my face away to reach further towards the back. As my fingers probe into dusty cobwebs and forgotten pieces of discarded food I think I hear a rustle and call out to her again.

"Getting real tired of this Pea." 

She responds with a soft growling whine, somehow coming from in front of me. I turn my head and see her tense body crouched in the darkness under the coffee table. Did she sneak around behind me when I was bending down to reach under the couch?

Before I can react she thunders past my face like a wooly freight train, scattering trash and stray hairs like a smoke bomb. She streaks down the hall and around the corner, yowling and hissing the whole way. I hear her collide with a door as I shoot to my feet, ignoring the searing pain in my heel to sprint after her as the sounds of her own struggle intensify. I round the corner to the sound of a dull thud that precludes a heavy silence and come to a sudden halt.

The door to the hall closet is open.

I don't know how long I was standing there but the thought of Sweet Pea laying on the floor with a broken neck, an accusatory glare with vacant eyes, snaps me out of it and I step into the threshold. The closet looks just as I remember with one small difference. A small cardboard box has fallen off of the shelf and lay slanted in the corner. The side that was labelled is facing away but I don't need to see it to know which box it is. 

I don't even realize I've been slowly backing away until a shard of ceramic embedded in my heel makes contact with the baseboard in the hallway, sending a bright bolt of pain up my spine that snaps me out of my daze. I realize now that the perfect silence has been broken as a low growl emanates from just underneath me.

I can't begin to describe the relief I feel when I look down and see Sweet Pea hunched at my feet staring into the darkness of the hall closet. I swiftly close the closet door and bend down to pick her up, wincing as the pain in my leg begins to really make itself at home. Surprisingly she doesn't complain as I escort her to the bathroom for first aid.

I'm not a Vet but as far as I can tell she has no injuries, save for one small patch of fur missing on her flank. I assume that's from running into the closet door so hard it popped open. Her eyes are clear and alert, and she hasn't had any more episodes the whole time I was pulling shards of coffee cup out of my foot. My best guess is she had a reaction to something in the treat Ruth fed her earlier, God only knows what the hell it's made of, and it seems to have worn off. If I see any other strange behaviors tomorrow I'll get her looked at but for now I'm eager to put this night behind me. On the way out of the bathroom I pause at the hall closet and, without turning to look, gently turn the small lock on the handle.

Maybe Sweet Pea can sleep in my bedroom tonight, just this once.
