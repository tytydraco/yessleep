**July 1st: "The First Night"**

Welcome to the Graveyard Shift, eh! Honestly, I took the job because I needed the money. Simple as that. The mall’s been closed for years, left to rot like the rest of this town, but they still pay someone to keep an eye on it. A security guard to make sure no one breaks in: no homeless squatters, no teenage thrill-seekers trying to film some urban exploration nonsense. Just walk the empty halls, check the cameras, and clock out at sunrise.

Easy work.

Truth be known, the place isn’t in bad shape. Sure, there’s plenty of dust, and some of the neon signs flicker like they’ve got a death rattle, but it’s not some crumbling ruin. Even the escalators still work when I flip the breaker. The air though, that smells like a ghost of the old food court: grease, stale cinnamon, something artificial.

Too fresh, to be honest.

You know what? I tell myself I imagined that part.

The floors are still polished enough to reflect the overhead lights, but they make the place look wrong: too bright in some spots, swallowed by shadows in others. A few storefronts still have old sale posters in the windows, frozen in time: *BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!* *FINAL CLEARANCE: EVERYTHING MUST GO!*

The last time I set foot in this place, I must have still been a teenager. Back then, it had life: shoppers hurrying between stores, kids loitering outside the arcade, the smell of cheap pizza and pretzels filling the air. That was before the crash. Before businesses dried up and moved elsewhere.

Now, it’s a corpse.

And I’m the one keeping watch over the body.

There are stories about this place, of course. Urban legends. Every town has them.

When I was younger, people whispered about shadows moving behind the storefront glass, voices coming from the empty food court, the occasional security guard who quit without explanation. I’d heard the usual ghost stories too, tales about the mall being built over burial grounds, old tunnels, places best left undisturbed. Back then, I’d laughed them off. Just dumb rumors. Now, standing alone in the middle of it all, I don’t feel like laughing. Still, I tell myself the same thing I did when I took the job: It’s just a building.

Nothing more.

I check my watch. 10:47 PM.

My shift officially starts at eleven, but I wanted to get here early. Get a feel for the place. The security office is near the old Sears, a windowless room with outdated monitors and a desk that smells like stale coffee. A single metal filing cabinet sits in the corner. It’s locked. The monitors flicker to life when I hit the switch. Twelve feeds in all. One for each wing of the mall, plus a few in the service corridors. Most show nothing but empty hallways, silent and still. The one outside the food court is the same, except for the occasional glitch, a static ripple crawling across the screen. I make a mental note to check the wiring later.

There’s an old logbook on the desk, the pages yellowed with time. I flip through it, scanning the last few entries.

June 23rd – 2:14 AM: *Heard something in the west corridor. Checked it out. Nothing there.*

June 24th – 3:41 AM: *Power flickered again. PA system made a noise. Almost like… music?*

June 25th – 4:02 AM: *Saw movement on camera 3. No one there.*

Then, nothing. No more entries. Damn… The last guard must have left in a hurry.

I grab my flashlight, clip my radio to my belt, and step out into the mall. It feels too quiet. Not just empty: hollow. The silence isn’t natural. It presses in on me, like the whole building is waiting for something. I shake the feeling off and start my first patrol.

The first hour is uneventful. I walk the halls, flashlight cutting through the dark. My footsteps echo back at me, the only sound in a place that once thrived with life. The food court tables are still set, as if waiting for customers who’ll never come. The plastic chairs are slightly pulled out, frozen mid-motion, abandoned in a hurry. A few empty soda cups remain on the tables, lids sunken, straws discolored. I try not to think about how the janitors should have cleaned all this up before the mall shut down.

The mannequins in the department store windows stand like frozen spectators, blank faces staring out into nothing. Some are missing limbs. Others are dressed in outdated clothes—pastel polos, acid-  wash jeans. There’s something wrong about the way they stand. Not quite symmetrical. Not quite balanced.

I keep moving.

The neon sign outside an old RadioShack flickers when I pass. The bulbs hum, buzzing like trapped insects. The gate to the store is down and locked, has been for years. but inside, I swear I see movement.

Just a shadow. Could be my own reflection. I don’t stop to check.

It happens near the carousel. I pause to take a sip from my water bottle, leaning against the metal railing around the ride. The horses are faded, their once-  bright colors muted with dust. Then I hear it.

Faint mall music.

I straighten up, turning my head to listen. It’s distant, like a song playing from a speaker buried under concrete. Fuzzy, warped. A tune I almost recognize, but can’t quite place. The thing is… the mall’s PA system is dead. I checked. The power is off. I grip my flashlight tighter, scanning the ceiling where the speakers are mounted. Nothing.

I tell myself it’s just sound traveling from outside. Maybe a car with the bass turned up, parked too close to the building. But the mall walls are thick. Too thick. I shouldn’t be able to hear anything. I take a slow step forward. The music is coming from deeper inside, past the carousel, down the wide corridor lined with empty storefronts. The song is half-familiar, like something I heard as a kid—an old commercial jingle, maybe. And then, it stops. Dead silence.

Like it was never there at all.

A chill runs down my spine, but I shake it off. Probably just my mind playing tricks on me. Still, I can’t help but check over my shoulder. I settle into the shift. I tell myself it’s just another night job. Walk the halls. Check the cameras. Ignore the way the darkness presses in at the edges of my flashlight’s beam.

Then the patterns start.

11:47 PM.

I pass the department store again, letting my light sweep over the display. The mannequins stand just like before, their plastic faces blank. I walk a little farther, pausing at the next storefront. The glass is covered in dust, reflecting my own tired face back at me.

Something nags at me.

I turn back to the department store window. One of the mannequins is different. Its head is tilted, just slightly, turned toward the path where I just walked. Like it’s watching. I hold my breath.

No. That’s not right.

I tell myself I must have missed it before. Maybe a trick of the shadows. Maybe I’m just tired. I keep moving.

12:20 AM.

At the security station, I check the monitors. The feeds flicker, switching between angles: grainy black- and- white shots of empty hallways. The upper level. The food court.

Then, static.

I frown. The cameras have been faulty for years, but something about the sudden glitch puts me on edge. The static clears. For half a second, I swear I see movement on the upper level. A figure, blurred by the distortion. My breath catches. I switch the feed back.

Nothing.

Just empty corridors and locked storefronts. I exhale slowly. I’m imagining things. I must be. Still, I feel colder than I did before.

1:04 AM.

I head toward the old bookstore, near the back of the mall. A wall clock still hangs just inside, its glass cracked, hands frozen in time. I shine my light on it as I pass.

4:02 AM.

I stop. That can’t be right. I check my watch. 1:04 AM. My stomach tightens. I take a step back. The cracked glass catches the light at a different angle. The hands haven’t moved. They’re stuck. I swallow hard and keep walking.

1:40 AM.

I loop back toward the security office. The department store window is on my right as I pass. I don’t want to look… But I do. The mannequin that had its head tilted? Now, it’s facing the opposite direction. I stop. My pulse hammers in my ears. I know it wasn’t like that before. I would have noticed. A feeling settles in my chest… deep, instinctual.

I am not alone.

I turn quickly, scanning the corridor behind me. My flashlight beam cuts through the dark… Nothing.

No movement.

No sound.

Just the faint buzz of an old neon sign, flickering overhead. I tell myself to calm down. It’s just my imagination. But I pick up my pace anyway.

2:12 AM.

Back at the security station, I check the cameras again. The upper level feed glitches. For a fraction of a second, I see something in the distance. Not a person.

Not exactly.

A shape… just at the edge of the frame. It disappears before I can process it. I feel cold all over. I switch the feed back.

Just me.

Just me in this whole empty mall.

3:00 AM.

I tell myself I’m being ridiculous. I need to prove it to myself. So I go for another walk- through. I check the food court. The loading bay. The abandoned arcade with its silent, screen-burnt machines. Everything is just as it should be. I start to feel better.

Then I see it.

The back hallway door, the one leading to storage rooms and old employee offices. It was locked earlier. Now, it’s open. A sliver of darkness yawns beyond the threshold. The air feels wrong… too still, too expectant. I step closer, heart pounding.

Something is waiting.

I hesitate. I mean, it could be a mistake… the lock was faulty, or someone forgot to secure it before the mall shut down. That’s what I tell myself. But my body doesn’t believe it. There’s a feeling in my gut, a tension winding its way into my limbs like a warning I don’t understand. Still, I step inside.

The hallway is longer than I remember. It should only be about twenty feet, a short stretch of bland corridor leading to the old employee offices and storage rooms. But as I walk, the air gets heavier, staler. I shine my flashlight along the floor. The tiles look different.

Older.

The linoleum pattern has changed: no longer the scuffed, off-white flooring I walked over earlier. This looks… older than the rest of the mall. A darker color, worn down in strange patterns. Like hundreds of footsteps have passed through here over the years.

I stop.

Something feels off.

I glance behind me. The door I just walked through looks farther away than it should. The hallway seems… stretched. No. That’s impossible. I keep moving. There’s another door ahead, standing slightly ajar. I don’t remember this one. It looks older, too… a heavy wooden thing, completely out of place in a building from the 1980s. The paint is peeling, and the handle is an old-fashioned brass knob, the kind you’d see in a house from decades before the mall even existed. My flashlight catches movement inside. Just a flicker… like something shifting in the dimness beyond. A trick of the air, I tell myself. Or maybe a rat. Yeah… A rat.

I step closer.

Then, the PA system crackles to life. The sound cuts through the silence like a blade. A burst of static. Then a faint, distorted whisper.

My name.

I freeze.

My skin goes ice-cold. The PA system has been dead for years. I turn slowly, flashlight trembling in my grip. The hallway behind me looks wrong. It’s longer now. I can still see the door I came through, but it’s… farther away. Like I took twenty steps, but the distance doubled behind me. That’s not possible. I turn back to the open door. The darkness beyond it feels too deep.

Something is waiting.

I don’t go through. Not yet. Instead, I step back. I reach for the doorknob and pull it shut. The second the door clicks into place, the air feels lighter. Like I just slammed something out. I stand there for a long moment, heart hammering. Then I turn and head back the way I came. I don’t check the security cameras again. I don’t want to see what’s on them.

I sit at the security desk, rubbing a hand over my face. One more hour, that’s all. Just sixty minutes, and I can be out of here. I can go home, crawl into bed, and convince myself that nothing weird happened tonight. I glance at the monitors. Something’s different. I lean forward, staring at the grainy black-and-white feeds.

The mannequins have moved.

Not just one. All of them. Every mannequin in the department stores, the clothing boutiques, even the old window displays. They’re no longer in the positions I saw them in earlier. They’re facing the cameras now. Their blank plastic faces stare directly into the lenses. A cold sensation trickles down my spine. I swallow, scanning the feeds. I know they weren’t like that before. Earlier, they were arranged normally… dressed in outdated fashion, mid- stride in fake promotional displays. But now… Now they look posed.

Deliberate.

Like they’re watching me.

I don’t breathe. I don’t blink. I check another camera. The food court. The chairs have been rearranged. Before, they were scattered, some overturned, like they’d been abandoned in a rush. But now, they form a perfect circle. Neatly arranged. Symmetrical. I stare at the screen.

Who the hell…?

No.

No one’s here. I am alone. A chill creeps through my body. Something is wrong. I reach for the radio. Static hisses from the speaker before I even press the button. A whisper seeps through. I jerk my hand away. The whisper doesn’t stop. It’s not words, exactly. Just a breath, drawn out, endless. The screens flicker.

Static.

A sharp burst of white noise blasts through the monitors, the kind of interference that makes your teeth ache. For a split second, I see it… A figure. Standing just outside the security office.

Tall. Still. A silhouette against the glass door.

I spin around. The hallway outside is empty. I know what I saw. I whip back to the monitors. The static flickers again. The figure is closer. This time, I catch details. The shape of a man. A mall security uniform, just like mine. His head is tilted too far forward. I can’t see his face. My pulse pounds in my ears. Another flicker. He’s gone. The hallway behind me is still empty.

The power flickers. The overhead lights buzz, dim, then flare. The monitors flash to black. For a moment, I am completely blind.

Then…

The sound of footsteps. Slow. Measured. Coming from inside the security office. Behind me. I whip around. Nothing. The room is empty. The only sound is my own ragged breathing. The monitors blink back to life. The mannequins have moved again. They aren’t facing the cameras anymore.

They’re facing me.

I stand up so fast my chair scrapes against the floor. Enough… I’m done.

Whatever this is, my mind playing tricks, some elaborate prank, or something else, I don’t care anymore. I grab my flashlight, my radio, and my keys. One more sweep of the mall. Then I’m out.

I don’t finish my rounds… I can’t. My hands are still gripping the edge of the desk, knuckles white, but I don’t remember sitting back down. My breathing is uneven, my chest tight like something’s pressing against it. The monitors still show the mannequins.

Facing me… Watching.

I tear my gaze away and force myself to stare at the far wall instead. I don’t check the cameras again. I don’t look at the food court. I don’t look at the mannequins. I sit in silence.

And I wait.

The PA system crackles. A soft, distant sound… like someone breathing. I press my hands over my ears.

Not real.

Not real.

Not real.

I stare at the clock on the security desk.

3:57 AM.

Three more minutes. I can make it three more minutes.

I don’t move.

I don’t blink.

3:58 AM.

The lights overhead flicker. A shadow moves. Inside the room. I shut my eyes.

I won’t look.

3:59 AM.

My radio hisses with static. A voice comes through.

Not words.

A whisper.

I press my hands over my ears. I don’t listen.

4:00 AM.

A soft knock at the door. Just one. I stay perfectly still. The air in the security office feels wrong. Too heavy. Too thick. Like something else is here with me. I don’t turn around.

4:01 AM.

The whisper stops. Everything is silent. The lights hold steady. The air feels… normal again. But I still don’t move.

Not yet.

4:02 AM.

The clock stops. A single blink… then the numbers vanish. I hear the sound of the glass doors creaking open, but I haven’t moved yet.

It’s time to go.

I stand up, legs unsteady. I don’t check the cameras. I don’t look at the mannequins. I don’t look at the food court. I just walk. Through the hall, past the empty stores, toward the exit. The glass doors feel heavier than before, but I push them open, stepping out into the humid summer air. The heat presses against me, sweat beading on my forehead. For the first time all night, I breathe.

Then I get in my car, turning the key with shaking hands. The dashboard lights flicker on. The digital clock glows in the dark.

4:02 AM.

I never checked my watch. I never checked my phone. The security desk clock could’ve been wrong. The car’s clock could be wrong. But I feel it in my bones: it’s not. Something changed inside that mall.

Or maybe… I did.

Tomorrow night, I come back. I don’t want to. But I have to.

I grip the steering wheel, my breath slowing, heartbeat steadying. It’s over. At least for tonight. I throw the car into reverse, ready to leave this place behind… And then my radio crackles. Not the mall’s radio. My car radio. A familiar tune starts playing. The same warped mall music from earlier.

My breath catches. I reach for the dial, twisting it all the way down… But the music doesn’t stop. It just keeps playing. Faint. Muffled. Like it’s coming from under the seats. Like it’s coming from inside the car. The rearview mirror flickers. For a second, I swear I see movement. A shape in the backseat. I twist around, heart pounding…

Nothing.

Just an empty car.

But as I turn back to the wheel, I see it: my reflection in the rearview mirror. Only… I’m still sitting at the security desk.

The radio hisses… then the music cuts out.

Silence.

I don’t breathe. I don’t move. Then, slowly, the clock on my dashboard changes. The glowing numbers shift, flickering, stuttering… Until they settle on:

4:02 AM.

Again.

And again.

And again.

Like I never left.
