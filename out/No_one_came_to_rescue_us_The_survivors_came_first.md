My father kept the rusted pipe in his hands like it was the only thing holding him upright.

Across the flooded alley, three men stood on a nearby rooftop, silhouettes against the gray sky. I couldn’t see their faces clearly, but I could hear them. Their voices carried strangely over the water, like the flood wanted us to listen.

“Kid’s alive,” one of them said again.

“Supplies?” another asked.

My father didn’t answer them. He didn’t shout back. He didn’t warn them to stay away. He just pulled me behind him and whispered, low and sharp, “Don’t talk. Don’t move.”

I swallowed hard. My throat still burned from choking on the wave. My skin felt raw, like the salt had scraped me from the inside out. I wanted to ask him what he was doing. I wanted to believe those men were like us, scared, hungry, trying to find someone to hold onto.

But my father’s eyes told me the truth before his mouth did.

He wasn’t afraid of the flood anymore.

He was afraid of people.

The three men didn’t wait for permission. They stepped onto a broken concrete slab bridging the gap between rooftops. It wasn’t a real path, just debris wedged into place, half collapsed, slick with algae and blood. One of them had a crowbar. Another had a knife shoved into his waistband. The third one, tall and bald, wore a raincoat that didn’t belong to him. It was too clean compared to everything else.

They moved like they’d done this before.

The tall one raised his hands slightly as if he wanted to look harmless.

“We’re not looking for trouble,” he called out.

My father tightened his grip on the pipe. His knuckles were white. “Then walk away.”

The man smiled.

It wasn’t friendly.

It was the kind of smile you see on street dogs right before they bite.

“Too late for that,” he said.

Everything after that happened too fast and too slow at the same time.

The man with the crowbar lunged first. My father swung the pipe and caught him in the shoulder. The sound it made was wet and hollow, like hitting a sack of meat. The man stumbled back, cursing, but the knife guy was already moving.

He drove forward with his blade like he knew exactly where ribs break easiest.

My father tried to block, but he was exhausted. We hadn’t eaten. We hadn’t slept. He was still bleeding from cuts I hadn’t even noticed.

The knife flashed.

And then the crowbar swung again, hard.

My father’s head snapped sideways and he went down like someone had turned him off. Blood poured from the side of his skull and spread across the rooftop in a fast, ugly puddle.

I forgot how to breathe.

The tall man stepped closer, looking at my father on the ground like he was checking if a bag of rice was torn.

Then he looked at me.

I’ll never forget the way his eyes moved over me. Not like a human looking at a kid.

Like a butcher counting weight.

The knife guy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and took a step toward me.

“You should’ve run, kid,” he said.

I didn’t think so.

I grabbed the rusted pipe when no one was watching my hands.

It felt heavier than it should have. Slippery from floodwater and blood. I swung it with everything I had left in my body, fear, rage, shock, all of it.

The pipe connected to his face.

I felt it hit something soft.

Then something hard.

He screamed and stumbled backward, clutching his jaw. Teeth hit the rooftop and scattered like seeds.

The tall man swore and rushed me.

He tackled me so hard my lungs emptied. We rolled across the concrete, hitting rubble and shards of broken tile. He smelled like salt and old sweat. He pinned me down, his forearm across my throat, squeezing until my vision started narrowing.

I clawed at him, nails digging into skin. I bit his wrist so hard I tasted blood. He didn’t even flinch.

He leaned close to my ear and whispered, calm as prayer, “Quiet. Just quiet.”

My body started to shake. Not from fear.

From the realization that he’d done this before. That he liked the way I stopped fighting.

Then **crack**.

The crowbar hit him.

Not my crowbar. The other man’s.

But it was my father holding it.

He was standing over us, swaying like he might collapse any second, blood running down his temple and into his beard. One eye was half shut. His lips were split.

But he was alive.

And he hit the tall man again.

Hard.

The tall man’s grip loosened. His eyes rolled. His body went heavy.

I shoved him off me and scrambled backward, gasping like I’d been underwater again.

The knife guy cursed and grabbed his friend by the collar. The crowbar man, hurt, bleeding, terrified, looked at my father and then at me and made a decision I will always remember.

They ran.

Not because they suddenly grew a conscience.

Because they realized we weren’t easy.

They jumped back across the broken slab and vanished behind the rooftop wall, leaving one of them behind. The one with the shattered jaw lay on the ground groaning, blood pooling under his cheek. His hands fluttered uselessly like a dying fish.

My father stood with the crowbar raised.

I expected him to finish it. I expected him to kill the man right there, the way you’re supposed to in a world with no rules.

He didn’t.

He just stared at him, breathing hard.

Then he lowered the crowbar slowly.

“No more,” he said, but his voice didn’t sound like it belonged to him.

It sounded like someone older. Someone empty.

The man on the ground started crying, choking, and gagging through broken teeth. He tried to crawl away.

My father didn’t stop him.

We let him crawl until he disappeared over the edge and into the floodwater below. I heard a splash… then nothing.

After that, the rooftop felt different.

Like the ocean had gotten closer.

Like the air itself had teeth.

My father sat down against the wall, shaking so hard the crowbar rattled against the concrete. He finally looked at me, really looked, like he was seeing me for the first time since the wave.

His eyes were wet, but no tears fell.

“You can’t trust anyone,” he whispered. “Not now.”

I wanted to argue. I wanted to scream that people weren’t supposed to be like this. That we were all victims. That we were all drowning.

But the words wouldn’t come out.

Because I’d seen it too.

Those men didn’t come to check if we were alive.

They came to see what they could take.

My father leaned his head back against the wall and shut his eyes.

I sat beside him, pipe in my hands, staring at the ruined city below. Bodies floated through the streets like broken dolls, spinning slowly in dirty water.

The sky stayed black.

The water didn’t leave.

And somewhere in the distance, another scream echoed and then cut off too quickly.

That was when I understood what the flood really did.

It didn’t just kill people.

It turned the ones who survived into something worse.

That night, my father and I didn’t sleep.

We sat with our backs to the wall, clutching rusted metal like it was faith, watching the edge of the roof like wolves.

And in the dark… the hunger inside me woke up.

Not hunger for food.

Something else.

Something colder.

If you’re still reading this, I’ll tell you what happened when the food ran out completely.

Because that’s when the real nightmare started.
