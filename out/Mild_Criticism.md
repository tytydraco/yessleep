Before we begin, this account isn't my main one. It's one I use to post about whatever I feel like. Memes, casual conversations about video games, so on and so forth. My main account is a more prolific writer you may recognize, hence why I've switched to this account. But that isn't why I made this post. The problem is what has happened in the last year.

I've never been a particularly popular horror writer. I've had some hits and misses here and there, the occasional small youtube channel wanting to voice a story I wrote. Never anything mainstream. I've had praise, criticism, good and bad views on what I've written for a while now. All of this took a turn when I got my first "fan". His name was Critical\_Clancy, though I think that account has long since been deleted. I still have his original message:

>*Yo dude! I really loved your story \[ACCOUNT NAME\]! Definitely one of the spookiest things I've read in years. I really enjoyed how \[MAIN CHARACTER\] had to grapple with his lingering trauma with the \[MONSTER NAME\]. You've got yourself a fan! I'm going to be watching what you make in the future! - C.C.*

I wasn't a stranger to people sending me messages like this. Likewise, I wasn't a stranger to the opposite messages. Criticism isn't herently a bad thing, but it felt good to get praise. I didn't respond to the message but I took it well and felt encouraged to write a bit more on forums and websites about scary stories.

A few days later, I posted another short story. It wasn't even up for ten minutes before I got another message from Clancy. More praise, more enjoyment of my work, more watching me in the future. I had written off the original message as just positive buzz but this? I felt like I had an actual fan, someone who would talk about my stuff. It felt good. I loved it. After all; who doesn't want to be recognized for their work?

It was like clockwork; For the next two months, anytime I'd post a story, Clancy would respond in a private message. Always praise, always gassing me up. It felt good. Looking back I don't even know if my work was good or if it just appealed to him (I'm assuming him, if Clancy is even their name). Positive reception, comments, all the things a creator wants to see. Those first two months were the honeymoon period.

Then I wrote about a monster. We'll call that monster the Yigba, the monster's actual name was stupid

In truth, I think this was just me getting my ego too inflated. After all, all those good comments? Surely I could create something that'd last and be an icon. So I crafted some spooky monster called the Yigba. I figured it'd be a new face of horror, something that'd end up in the pantheon like Slenderman or the Backrooms. I posted in pure confidence. Reception was...bad. People thought it was too shlocky and like a story from the earliest days of the internet in the worst way.

I had figured it was a dud and decided to just throw it away. But that's when I got my next message. Clancy, my number one fan. I figured it'd be some positive words of encouragement or a "Hey, we all stumble, try again later". His response was...not that;

>*\[NAME\]*  
*Hey, I just read your story on the Yigba. I'm going to give you some mild criticism, I hope you don't take it personally, but the rules for how the Yigba works weren't well done. I felt it was lacking in numerous aspects and not your best work. We'll just consider this a misstep. Just don't make anything like the Yigba again. - C.C.*

Something about the tone was just off. It was weird. Clancy was treating me like he was HR and I was some kind of employee who wasn't getting his old lunch out of the refrigerator. I didn't respond as my mood was rather shot from people making fun of my writing. It'd be a one time thing, to be sure. I'm certain I could write better things in the future.

The next few stories I wrote were better recieved, but after the Yigba story, Clancy's criticisms didn't let up. All the hype and the praises were replaced with minor grammatical proddings, minor spelling errors that'd slip through the cracks, tiny things that he insisted made for a worse story. "You're better than this", he'd offer. "You're doing another Yigba. You shouldn't be doing another Yigba." Every story, my inbox would be filled. Small notes became entire paragraphs. Paragraphs became critiques longer than the story it critiqued. And every time, he'd reiterate: "I'm going to give you some mild criticism".

Eventually, I was fed up. I wrote these stories for fun. If I wanted to publish them and get paid for them, I'd hire an editor. For the first time, I responded to Clancy;

>*Clancy,*  
*I'm glad you liked my earlier stories but this is getting ridiculous. I can handle minor criticism, but you're sending me critiques longer than my story. I'm sorry you don't like my new stories. Please do not send me more criticism. A thumbs-up or a thumbs-down is enough.*  
*\[NAME\]*

That I felt would be the end of it. I closed my laptop and went to bed. Woke up, went to work, did my daily grind, came home, opened my laptop. My inbox was filled with thousands of messages to the point that it overflowed. Clancy had not taken my refutation of his criticism well. At first it was benign, disappointment that I was "turning my back on such mild criticism" before wishing me the best. Then more messages, each one more abrasive. Anger that he put so much time into critiquing my work. How ungrateful I was. How this all started with the goddamn Yigba. And when it was clear my inbox was full, he went to every single story I posted.

Comments ranged from furious tirades to snapping at any user telling him to calm down. The moderators deleted most of the comments and cleared my inbox for me but Clancy had left digital graffiti all over my stories. As with anyone, it burned me out. I didn't feel the desire to write anymore. I thanked the mods for their work and decided I'd take a break from writing for a few weeks. Life was good in that time, I saw my family, I played games with friends, worked my job. It wasn't anything special but it was mine.

In this time, I'd get emails from Clancy on my email I had registered my account with. Every one I'd block would prompt another new burner email to be made. The message always varied; some were apologetic that he'd gone too far with his criticism. Others were furious rants filled with offensive language and slurs. After email number thirty, I had enough. I deleted the email address, removed my website account and considered calling the police. Clancy had too much time on his hands to dedicate all this to me.

It was in the fourth week of my "break" that I got a text from an unknown number:

>*\[NAME\]*  
*Where's the next story? I've been waiting. - C.C.*

Immediately I was shocked. How the hell did he get my number? Maybe there'd been some internet sleuthing? I couldn't imagine. I logged into everything associated with my deleted email, double checked all my information. Had I accidentally overshared? A social media mishap? A data leak? Either way, I blocked the number and immediately researched into how to protect myself. I lived alone in a small apartment so it was easy enough to make sure nobody could get in. Calling it "Paranoia" wouldn't truly cut it. Clancy seemed hellbent on finding me.

The texts kept coming even after I blocked the initial number. I called the police and told them what was going on, that I had a stalker. They said they'd keep watch and collect evidence. They'd find who Clancy was and arrest him, finally getting me a restraining order so he'd get out of my life. A guy I never met, obsessing over some stories I wrote on the internet for free.

Three days after this, I went to my job. H.R. called me in. They said they found explicit material on my work computer. I told them there was no way that could be true. Someone either planted that or hacked into the network. I even explained to them that I was currently tending a case of a stalker. H.R. wasn't interested. "Nobody had access to this but you and our IT team noted no odd logins or tampering." We argued longer and longer. There'd be no win. I packed my things, being escorted out of my office. I started texting my parents, telling them what happened. Instead I saw a text there waiting for me;

>*Checking to see if you have more time for writing now, \[NAME\]. Eager to read your next story. - C.C.*

I took this text to the police. They couldn't do anything about my job and even this information seemed to lead to more dead ends but he had to be behind this. More evidence for the pile. I went home. I sat at my desk, running my hands through my hair. I was so frustrated. People were doing their best but slowly the bricks in the foundation of my life were being picked out one by one. Then I recieved a message on my personal account. One I never used for anything other than being around my personal, real-life friends.

>*CC: Where's the next story?*

If I kept him on long enough, maybe the police could trace where he was messaging me from?

>*Me: What the fuck is wrong with you? How'd you get shit on my work computer?*  
*CC: What? Your real life problems aren't my problem. Anyways, about your next story?*  
*Me: No, fuck you.*  
*CC: Harsh*  
*Me: YOU ARE FUCKING WITH MY LIFE.*  
*CC: I give you mild criticism and you turn everything against me? Whose the real one going too far?*

By this point, I had called the police and let them know what was going on. They said to keep things going for as long as possible.

>*Me: You got me fired, you blew up my inbox, you looked up my REAL LIFE INFORMATION. I wrote scary stories for fun and you won't chill the FUCK out*  
*CC: I like your stories though, I just had mild criticism*  
*Me: Enough with this mild criticism BULLSHIT*  
*Me: You filled my inbox with comments and slurs, you're out of fucking line, you've KILLED my desire to write and you won't leave me the fuck alone.*  
*CC: ...*  
*CC: You know some people would kill for someone as passionate as I am about your work while you offload your problems on me. No clue what's going on in your life, but if I could give you some advice, it sounds like you're blaming me for things going on that I had no business with*  
*CC: Maybe a little less victim card flashing, more writing? Honestly you went downhill after the Yigba story and you really fell off. But that's OK. We can fix things with just a little critical review*  
*CC: Considering we're in this chat now, how about we share some ideas?*  
*CC: \[NAME\]?*  
*CC: \[NAME\] I can see you're still logged in.*  
*CC: \[The next few paragraphs were nothing but all-caps threats, offensive comments, threats of violence against me and more\].*

I didn't type anything after that. Clancy stopped responding. Police eventually arrived, checking the account. It'd be a while before they got the go-ahead from the company for the information to find out where Clancy's account came from. The cops said once they had the information, they'd be able to do something.

That was three months ago. I think the cops either wrote it off as paranoia or didn't believe me. I sent them all this information. Anytime I call them, they tell me they're working on it. I don't know if they are. Clancy wouldn't go out of his way to call the cops just for this, would they? No, that's stupid and paranoid. But what if he had a friend? Why is he taking all this fucking time just for me?

My door is locked. I'm looking for work from home jobs. I don't feel safe here. I contacted the phone company about getting my number changed, I've got the police ready to be called the moment something happens. I haven't been sleeping well, my funds are slowly drying up. I'm borrowing the free wifi from the coffee shop across the street, two stories down. If anyone knows what I can do here, please help me.

EDIT: After I wrote this, two minutes later I got a private message in my inbox from a deleted account:

>*\[My full home address\]*  
*Stop playing the victim because you got criticism and get to writing*
