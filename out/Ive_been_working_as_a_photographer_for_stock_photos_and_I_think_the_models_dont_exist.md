I have been working as a free-lance photographer on and off since I was in high school. It started off as a way to make money on the side but as my portfolio casually grew I began to land bigger jobs.



Now I am a college graduate and I have been pursuing a professional photography career more seriously. For the past few months I have been doing jobs for companies that produce stock footage and photos.



Funny enough, I had never considered there was really a market for that, but thinking about it now, I suppose it makes sense. However, I had an experience with one of the subjects of a recent shoot that has turned me off of doing any jobs for a long time. Just thinking about what happened to me is making me feel nauseous and just anxious, but I have to share it. It is just so damn strange.



For the past few weeks I had been doing shoots with a group of models at a studio in my area. I never understood the prompts for the photos, but I never questioned it because I was being paid. I took photos of the models in generic clothes doing various poses, holding random objects, and acting out oddly specific scenarios. I always wondered who were the people buying these stock images and why?



On the last shoot, about a week ago, one of the models approached me afterwards and very forwardly asked me to dinner. She was wearing a grey t-shirt with blue jeans and brandless white tennis shoes. Her hair was tightly pulled back in a ponytail, and now that I think about it, I cannot recall much of her facial features. I just remember thinking she was an attractive and kind woman.



The way she spoke to me was a bit odd however. Her phrases were very short, uninteresting, and unnatural, but I assumed maybe it was just because of the odd nature of a stock photo shoot. I always thought there was something kind of eerie about the lifelessness of the photos we took. They were all completely devoid of any human elements. It was almost like the people in the photos we took were not meant to be seen as real.



Anyway, I obliged because, honestly, since college I had not dated much. She gave me her number, and that was the first real odd thing I noticed about her. The area code was not the same as the area code we lived in, and looking the code up, I could not find for which state the area code was for. It was seemingly for a non-existent state.



I sent her a text when I got home to confirm her number.



“Hey, this is Blake. Is this Jane?”



She only took a few minutes to reply.



“Hey, Blake. This is Jane. How does dinner at my place this Friday sound? Does 7pm work?”



I was kind of thrown off by the idea of having dinner at her place, but I reasoned that was not such a weird thing, and I honestly found the idea endearing. I confirmed the plans and after that we did not text much.



Eventually Friday came and I asked for her address, which she provided, and before I knew it I was making the drive. She lived a surprising distance outside of town and when I put her address into maps, the name kept coming up as a set of coordinates.



The drive was eerily quiet, even with the radio playing. As I followed the maps, the whole atmosphere seemed off, but I did not think much of it.



When I got to her street I noticed the street was not on the map on my phone. Where there usually was a gray line, indicating a road, there was just a blank area. Yet, I saw a road, and populated houses lined it orderly. The street honestly looked a little out of place, because the surrounding houses were all spaced out and it was a pretty sparsely populated area. I just assumed maps had made an error, and turned onto the street.



Her house was at the very end of the street in a cul-de-sac. It was modest, one story, and slightly beige-colored with dark shutters. The lawn was kept, and a symmetrical flowerbed bordered the walkway up to the porch.



I texted her to let her know I was here.



“Come on in. I’m excited to have you.”



I walked up to her front door and knocked. A light was on in the living room, and although not trying to be intrusive, I took a glance at the living room through the window.



It looked like the set of a stock photo shoot.



“Just come on in. I will be home soon.”



She was not home? I found that immediately strange, and did not want to go inside but reluctantly I entered. The door was unlocked.



Her house was so strange. I got a better look at the living room. A blue rug, a coffee table with nothing on it, a navy couch with a lamp in the far corner. There was a TV stand, but no TV.



The walls. A sickening gray with framed photos. I looked closer at them, and realized they still had the placeholder photos in them.



To the left of the entryway. A room with a dining table. A singular house plant in the corner. Sitting on the center of the dining room table was an empty bowl.



The whole house smelled like the warehouse section of a supermarket. At this point I was starting to feel uneasy. I decided to take a seat on the couch.



Somewhere in the depths of the house I heard a clock ticking hypnotically.



I did not even get on my phone to pass the time waiting for her, I just sat there soaking up the entirely strange house, devoid of any personality. I stared at the pointless TV stand. The sun was starting to set.



She sent me a text.



“Hey, Blake. This is Jane. How does dinner at my place this Friday sound? Does 7pm work?”



What? I chalked it up to a messaging error.



“Hey, Blake. This is Jane. How does dinner at my place this Friday sound? Does 7pm work?”



Something about the second time seeing the message was too much. I went to the living room window looking out it, hoping to see her car headlights heading down the street.



Her car was in the driveway and it was off. I remembered, it had been there the whole time. I then was overcome with the horrible feeling of eyes on my back. A chill coiled up my spine and I immediately felt sick. I turned.



Through the living room was a side hallway. She was standing there. Although shrouded in darkness, I knew her eyes were fixed on me. The feeling was so malicious, so menacing, I began to heave. I left frantically out of her front door, I got to my car, and got the hell away from her house.



As I was pulling out of her driveway, I saw her figure move past the living room windows with an uncanny speed, yet her body remained stiff. She was at the front door, looking through the glass. Her eyes had never left me.



I actually ended up driving to a friend's house to stay the night. He was very kind to have me on such short notice, and I explained everything to him. He’s a good friend for not thinking I am crazy. In fact he helped me search for her socials using the photos from our shoot as a reference.



We did find her. We found the whole damn group of models. We could only find their photos on one website though, and just thinking about it makes me queasy.

Yesterday I got one final message from her.



“Thispull at@ down house\*\*msg00\_\_Blake”



Then our conversation went green, indicating her number had been terminated.
