We were just two fat kids who stuck out like chewed bubblegum on the bottom of a shoe.  It was our last summer before freshman year of High School when things would get a little more serious for us in Woodward Harbor.  My best friend Paul wore his obesity like a suit of armor; not even the harshest of insults could break through.  I—on the other hand—could barely stay on my feet from the verbal pummeling I took daily.  Luckily, I had Paul by my side to fight my battles.

Our little town of six thousand provided little amenities for teens.  Sure, we could throw rocks from the dock and chase seagulls around until we were out of breath, but growing up in our little seaside dump made life turn into a series of chores without an allowance.  So, I was quite fortunate to spend my free time hanging out with Paul, especially when we were bored beyond belief. 

Paul also helped me take my mind off the accident.  My father, Clark, had perished from a forklift accident.  I was only a kid at the time, but my mother, Catherine, told me in as simple terms as she could manage that dad slipped out of the lift while he was going up a loading dock and it fell over onto him, crushing him.  I never saw his body, and I’ve been told that was for the best. 

Mother worked the overnight waitress shift at our downtown diner Simmer Down By The Sea, so I was home alone most nights.  Paul’s parents just happened to work the same schedule as mothers, as police officer and nurse, respectively, which meant most nights Paul and I could kick it.

It was a Friday afternoon when our world changed.  We dropped by the convenience store for sodas and snacks like we usually did before an evening of video games and TV.  Paul spotted an eighth-grade classmate of ours, Tina Hutton, just before she was leaving the parking lot.

“Hey Tina,” Paul said, trying to contain a smile.

“Paul,” Tina responded stone-faced, uninterested.

“Do you like butter?”

“What kind of lame question is that?”

“Well, if you do, you can be the butter to these rolls.”  Paul lifted his shirt and jiggled his blubber. 

“You’re disgusting Paul!” she responded and stormed off.

Paul high-fived me as I followed him into the store.  “She’s into me,” he said, grabbing a bag of chips.

“I don’t know dude.  She didn’t look too impressed.”

“Of course, she’s not going to show it.  But I know how she feels.  She wants Paulie.  She’ll come around one of these days.”

After gathering the supplies, I took out the twenty Mother had given me and paid the cashier, Ronnie, a slender, always irritated old man who looked back at us with disgust. 

“Have you ever considered a banana?” he said to us, pointing to a bowl of rotting bananas sitting atop the counter.

“Maybe next time,” Paul replied, grabbing the bag of snacks.

“Why are people so mean to us?” I asked Paul during the walk back to my house. 

“That old man is a dickweed.  Just ignore him.  He’s probably miserable just sitting on that stool all day and night.”

I nodded and felt a little better.  We exchanged laughs during the fifteen-minute walk home.  After going inside and greeting Mother, we retreated to my room and played some multi-player fighting games for the next four hours.

“Alright dude, I’m bored.  Think you kicked my ass enough times.  Do you want to watch some TV?” I asked.

“He’ll yeah!  Maybe we can find that show with that woman remodeling her house.  You remember the size of those things on her?  They were enormous!”

A day never passed where Paul didn’t have women on the mind.  While I admired his confidence, I felt hideous.  I didn’t think anyone would ever date me or even consider dating me.  My confidence was at an all-time low.  Stress eating was practically one of my hobbies.  I started flipping the channels.

“Stop!  Check this out,” Paul shouted.

“Good evening all you food lovers and welcome back to Eat It Or Else!”

The woman on the TV looked morbidly obese.  Her sad tiny eyes, nose, and mouth were surrounded by a mass of fat.  The shape of her body with the white pants and pink tank top made her resemble a giant ice cream cone.  Our eyes were glued to the TV.

The voice off-camera continued.  “A show where living large can put you in charge.  No more getting made fun of.  No more put-downs.  Everyone loves you here.  You can get the respect you deserve.  But the task at hand will not be easy.  You will have to survive six rounds against our defending champion, Chrissie Crumb!”

The camera panned to a studio audience of adults cheering and clapping.  The shot changed back to the stage.  A tall, slender woman walked out from behind the curtains.  The camera zoomed in on her.  She wore a gray business suit and silver bangs dangled like icicles over her forehead. 

“And I’m your host, Waggy Maggie!  Thank you for allowing me to be here tonight, right here in Woodward Harbor.  That’s right.  We are casting for our live show right downtown.  Do you have what it takes to be the next contestant on…”

Waggy Maggie pointed the microphone at the crowd, and they yelled, “Eat It Or Else!”

“Come on down to our studio on thirty-two Brighton Drive.  You must be between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate.  A parental chaperone is not required.  Knock three times on the door and when the security guard opens the door, just ask for Waggy Maggie!”

Paul grabbed my shoulders.  “Holy shit dude, this is like the coolest thing that has ever happened in town.  I have to be on this show.  Let’s go!”

“Why?  Did you see that Chrissie woman?  She looked like she didn’t even want to be there.”

“Put your shoes on.  I’m biking over there right now.  You should come and watch me win.  I’ll eat anything man.  You know that.”

I glanced back at the TV.  The show returned from a commercial break.  The camera remained on Chrissie Crumb, who awkwardly paced back and forth while a catchy tune played.  There was something off about the show.  My stomach churned watching this woman in the spotlight.  I looked back at Paul, but he was gone, already out the front door.  I reluctantly joined him.

When we arrived at the industrial business area street, we located the building and went up to the front door.  What struck me as odd was the empty parking lot.  Only a handful of cars in the giant lot.  The dull and cold looking building made me a little uneasy, but Paul was overly excited.  He knocked three times.

A buff security guard opened the door.  “Can I help you?”

“I’m here to play on your show, to meet Waggy Maggie,” Paul replied, giggling.

“Come on in,” he responded.

I tried to follow Paul inside, but the guard stopped me.  “Hey, you’re not allowed in.  Only one new contestant at a time.  You will have to just watch him on the TV.”

The man gently pushed me back outside, and I had no choice but to do as he said. 

Paul looked at me and smiled.  “It’s okay dude.  I’ll come by after the show.  After tonight, everyone will know who I am.  Everyone’s going to remember Paulie.  Hey, maybe you should tell Tina to tune in!”

“Are you sure about this?” I whispered.  “This place looks kind of creepy.”

“I’m fine.  I’ll see you soon.”

The guard closed the door, and I just stood there quietly for a few minutes, eventually placing my ear against the door hoping to hear something, anything to reassure me everything was okay.  The silence lingered to the point it was unbearable.  I started talking aloud to myself. 

“He’s okay.  They are probably just getting all the cameras ready.  They probably just need to get everything set up.  This is stupid.  I’m going home.”

I got back on my bike and started making my way back home.  Before I could exit the parking lot, a couple of bullies swarmed me.  Zach Preston and Lane Hudson, two airheads going nowhere in life, who loved spending their free time bothering me. 

Zach, the taller of the morons, shoved me off my bike.  “Ethan, what are you doing out here all alone?  Don’t you know your mom worries when you ride after dark?  She’s probably waiting to tuck your fat ass into bed.”

I looked at Zach’s shoes, avoided eye contact because I knew it would make things worse.  Lane—with his military style buzz-cut squatted down to my level and pinched my right arm.

“Did you get fatter since I last saw you?”  Lane stood up and turned to Zach.  “I think he got fatter.  Good thing his dad is dead.  The man probably wouldn’t be able to stand the sight of his own son.”

My hands burned from the fall onto the gravel.  I pressed my palms further against those tiny little rocks and imagined I had a giant rock in my hand that I could bash against their skulls.  I felt another pinch from Lane.

“Do you have anything to say or you just going to sit there like the wimp of Woodward Harbor that you are?”

I remained silent and showed no emotion.  If I even attempted to fight back, they’d probably stab me with their keys. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Zach said, hopping onto his bike.  Lane joined him and they rode off into the dark, as the first of many tears flooded my cheeks.

My first stop upon returning home was going straight to the kitchen.  I popped open the pantry and reached for the bag of chocolates Mother had stashed behind the cereal boxes.  I must have consumed fifteen chocolate balls in a matter of seconds.  I didn’t even wash my dirty, bleeding hands before I went right for the junk food.  I think I may have even swallowed a few little rocks that were wedged into my hand.

I ran to my room and turned on the TV.  Waggy Maggie was on camera, standing next to Chrissie Crumb.

“And we are back live from the studio in Woodward Harbor.  We are excited to meet our challenger for the evening.  Backstage, he told us his nickname is Paulie, and that he looked forward to winning the crown tonight.  And that’s the kind of confidence we love to see around here.  So, let’s not leave him waiting any longer.  Please welcome to the stage, Paul Paulie Sullivan!”

The crowd roared with applause and cheer, as my best friend strutted to the stage like he’d been doing this entire life, a natural showman.

“Paul, it’s great having you here tonight.  You look eager to prove yourself, and more importantly, you look hungry!  Are you hungry to win or just hungry to eat?”  Waggy Maggie smirked and pointed the microphone back at the audience.  They chuckled.

A man in a white chef outfit wheeled out a table with two trays on it.

“For our first round, a sweet treat to excite the taste buds.  Double chocolate fudge brownies!  The rules are simple.  You must eat the entire portion placed here before you in order to advance to the second round.  You have to eat it or else!”  Waggy Maggie signaled for the chef to remove the covers from the trays.

Paul’s eyes bulged.  “This is too easy.  I’ve had an entire box of brownies before.”  He nudged Chrissie Crumb, and she retreated away from his touch.

“Such confidence!  We love to see it!  That’s what it’s going to take to have a shot at winning tonight, Paul.”  Waggy Maggie looked at the camera and nodded.  “Are you ready to eat it or else?  It’s time to begin.”

A buzzer sounded, as Chrissie Crumb and Paul stepped up to their respective trays.  Chrissie took a massive glob of brownies and stuffed it into her mouth.  She quickly reached for another handful, and then another.  In a matter of thirty seconds, her tray was empty.  Meanwhile, Paul struggled to finish his in a timely matter.  My own palms started to sweat seeing him struggle.

Waggy Maggie approached Paul.  “How are you doing Paul?  Are you ready to throw in the towel?”

“Nev…never,” made it out of his brownie-filled mouth.  He scooped up the last chunk of brownie and shoved it in his mouth. 

“C’mon dude, finish it.  Don’t spit it out.  You can do it,” I mumbled.

The camera zoomed in on Paul’s face.  I sighed in relief when I saw him swallow the last pieces of brownie.  Waggy Maggie handed Chrissie and Paul bottles of water.  Paul chugged his.

“That was impressive Paul, but unfortunately, there is no break before our next round.  Roberto, will you please bring out the next dish!”

The chef wheeled out another cart.

“Yuck, what the hell is that?  Is that chewed up gum?” Paul yelled.

“Good guess, Paul!  That’s right.  Earlier this evening, we asked several audience members to chew gum and return it to us for this dish.  However, we felt like being a little generous as this is only the second round.  So, we are offering you a cheese-based dip for your gum balls.”

The camera zoomed in on the plate of chewed bubble gum balls.  My own stomach squirmed in disgust. 

“You may begin,” Waggy Maggie said.

Paul hesitated but then reached for a gum ball when he saw Chrissie downing them quickly.  He put one in the dip and then swallowed it in one bite.  He must have consumed a dozen or so pieces by the time the plate was empty.

A nervous energy took hold of me as I waited for the reveal of the third-round dish.  Vomit tickled the back of my throat when the camera focused in on the next offering.  Teeth.  A giant pile of human teeth.  Paul glanced at Waggy Maggie and Chrissie and the audience, hoping it was all a joke, just a prank before the real dish was served.

“There’s no way.  I’m not eating a bunch of teeth.  That’s not even food,” he said. 

“Are you saying you are done, that you are dropping out of the contest?” Waggy Maggie asked.

“Chrissie, are you going to eat this?” he asked.

Chrissie lifted the plate to her mouth and the teeth rolled and bounced like rocks tumbling down a steep mountain.  She chewed and chewed, each crunch like a knife twisting in my ear.  Paul looked queasy, face turning green.  I looked away for a few seconds to gather myself.

When my vision returned to the screen, Chrissie finished swallowing the teeth while Paul gagged and coughed and closed his eyes.

“I can’t do it.  No way.  I’m done.  I’m out,” he said.

The room went silent.  Waggy Maggie approached Paul and slowly lifted the microphone to her face.

“He’s out.  Our newest contestant Paul Paulie Sullivan of Woodward Harbor has given up.  While it was a commendable effort, Chrissie has proven once again that nobody can take her down.  Paul, we thank you for your participation this evening, but I’m afraid it’s time to let you go.”  Waggy Maggie looked down at the floor where Paul stood and then stepped away from him.  She motioned for someone off camera with a stern nod.

My jaw dropped when the floor below Paul opened, sending Paul vanishing like a magic trick.  His screams reminded me of the time our neighbor Mitch accidentally dropped his newborn into the sea while playing with him on the dock.  That dreadful helpless feeling when you have experienced the unimaginable. 

“That can’t be real.  I’m sure he is okay.  He’s probably chilling in a room somewhere backstage,” I mumbled to myself, trying to cope with the visual that challenged my teenage brain.

The camera lingered on Chrissie Crumb while she swayed back and forth with the slightest hint of a smile.  Waggy Maggie handed Chrissie a trophy and she raised it above her head.  No sign of Paul.  The show ended and I sat there quietly, waiting for my friend to return.  An hour passed and he still was gone.  I couldn’t handle it anymore, so I hopped back on my bike and rode back to the studio.  I knocked on the door and the same buff security guard opened it.

“I’m looking for my friend Paul.  He was just on your TV show,” quickly rolled off my tongue before he could speak.

“There’s no Paul here.  I’m afraid you are mistaken.”  The man started to push the door closed.

I lodged my arm in the opening before he could close it all the way.

“Wait, what are you talking about?  My friend came over earlier and he was just on your show.  He fell through the floor.  Is he backstage hanging out?”

“Look kid.  I don’t know what you are talking about.”

My body shook with frustration, heart pounding against my skin-tight sweater.  I said the only thing that I thought would get me in the building.  “I’m here to see Waggy Maggie.  I want to play on your show.”

“Come on in,” the man said and yanked me inside.

He led me down a musty, dimly lit hall where he eventually nudged me into a room for contestants to get briefed before they took the stage.  I sat on a couch by myself, waiting for someone to give me instructions.  The sound of squeaking shoes approached.  Each step reminded me of those noisy chew toys a dog puts in their mouth.  And then I saw her.  Waggy Maggie.

She towered over me.  Her silver bangs looked like they were sharp enough to stab someone with. 

“Name?” she said, annoyed.

I was too distracted by her intimidating presence.

“What is your name?   Do not waste my time.  We have several episodes to shoot tonight.”

“Sorry about that.  I’m Ethan.  My friend Paul was here earlier tonight.”

“Yes, of course.  Paul Paulie Sullivan of Woodward Harbor.  A real charmer, that one.  Unfortunate, that he did not make it all the way to the end.”

“Do you know where he is?” I quickly asked.  “He never came back home after the show.”

“Ethan.  I’m guessing you saw him disappear and are worried sick as they say.  Am I correct in saying that?”

“Yes, where does that hole go to?  Is he still here in the studio?”

“Ethan, we cannot give away our secrets.  If I told you where that hole went, you’d tell your friends, and they would tell their friends and our show would not live to see another day.”

“I just want to see my friend.  Where is he?”

I noticed a few red spots on the right side of her gray suit.  She could tell that I was scared.

“Look, I’m not leaving until I see Paul,” I said, digging the palms of my hands into the couch cushions.

“Ethan, you are such a loyal friend.  I’m going to give you an opportunity to see your friend.  You will compete on our show.  Win or lose, you will see Paul again after the taping.”

I nodded.  “Okay.”

I was not someone who enjoyed being in the spotlight.  Attention drawn to me typically resulted in me feeling like a complete loser.  Years of bullying for your weight takes a toll on you.  As I stood on stage in the dark, waiting for the lights and cameras to turn, sweat soaked up my clothes.  I suddenly had an urge to run off stage and get out of there, but then the lights flipped on, and the room was buzzing with energy from the crowd.  I was stuck.

A few feet to my right stood Chrissie Crumb in her ice cream attire.  She ignored me.  I gazed out at the crowd and noticed something eerie about the audience members.  They almost all looked similar in appearance with only slight variations between the men and women.  Overly large cartoonish eyebrows on the men with chiseled jaws like Mom used to go on about while watching her romance shows on TV.  All the women had long blonde hair, and their faces were caked with makeup to the point they looked like plastic dolls. 

Waggy Maggie walked out to join us on stage.  “Good evening, Woodward Harbor, and welcome to Eat It Or Else!”

The crowd stood up in unison and emitted a sound of roars that sounded fake, like an audio recording of cheers.  The audience members’ mouths were open wide, but it was hard to tell whether they were making noise or not.

“Tonight, we welcome to the show, Ethan!  Good luck to you Ethan.  Our defending champion, Chrissie Crumb, is hungry and ready to retain her spot at the top.  Roberto, bring out the first dish!”

The chef wheeled out a table and removed the lids from the plates.  Two tall cups with a white liquid inside.

“Mayonaisse shakes!” Waggy Maggie shouted.

The chef handed Chrissy and I straws.

“Ethan, this should be an easy one for you.  Your people are obsessed with condiments,” Waggy Maggie said, making my stomach rumble in disgust.  “Your world is number one at consumption!”

I had no intention of drinking that disgusting shake; I just wanted to see Paul.

“I’m not doing it.  I’m out,” I said.

Waggy Maggie looked stunned, in utter shock at how fast I had given up.  “You haven’t even tasted it yet,” she said.

“No chance, send me into the hole,” I replied.

Waggy Maggie glanced at the audience and then back at me.  “Into the hole?  Someone has seen an episode or two before.”

The crowd chuckled, as I braced myself for being dropped into darkness.  I was not prepared for my stomach to shoot up to my mouth.  I tumbled down a slide for what felt like an hour when in reality it was only seconds. 

After landing in a spongy, foam-like pit, I crawled over to the concrete floor.  The walls were pulsating with almost blinding white and blue lights, on and off.  Brightness to darkness, back and forth.  I stood up and made my way down the corridor.  Child-like screams penetrated my ears.  I ran towards the noise.  To my right, a room with a giant see-through window came into view.

A kid around my age was in a human-sized claw toy machine, surrounded by bloody limbs all around him.  Outside of the machine, a woman was moving the joystick of the machine, as what appeared to be a razor-sharp claw loomed over the kid’s head.  The woman pressed the button, and the claw lowered, clamping onto the kid’s head, squishing it in the process.  His eyeballs popped from their sockets, and I ducked down out of view, horrified from the image. 

I crawled past the window and continued down the hallway, shuddering in fear, on the verge of fainting.  But then I heard a familiar voice, Paul.

“Please, no, don’t do this,” he said from a short distance.

I came upon another visible room.  I raised my head just enough to see what was happening.  Paul was strapped down on a table, trying to break free.  A group of women were huddled around him, amused at his attempt to free himself from the metallic chains. 

The five women locked arms in a circle around the table.  Their skin stretched and connected to each other, forming one giant blob of skin.  Paul was no longer visible.  Like a drill going into drywall, the now one giant circular body closed in on Paul, chunks of table pieces shredded and flying in the air.  Paul’s screams of agony will haunt me for the rest of my days.  Pieces of his body churned like a milkshake being whisked.  Blood and guts flew in the air.  An imprint of his face pressed through the back of the women’s skin. 

I ran, sobbing uncontrollably.  Another room with big glass windows appeared to my right.  Inside of the room sat Chrissie Crumb.  She lifted her head to meet my eyes, and her expression gave me no hope.  She looked dead inside. 

“What is this place,” I murmured.

The sounds of an elevator opening rerouted my attention to the end of the hall.  Waggy Maggie stepped out and approached me.  She took her right hand and slowly peeled off her face, exposing a concoction of hundreds of little wire-like cables that rose up and down across her face like those squiggly lines on a hospital vital sign monitor.

“Ethan, your planet has been such a fascinating one to explore.  We have learned so much from you humans.  Obesity, as you call it, is such an interesting concept.  Our kind does not gain weight when consuming.  For you humans to be obsessed with eating to the point your body grows and breaks down… well, it has given us a new understanding of the human species.” 

“Why did you kill my friend?  Why are you doing this to us?” I yelled.

“It should not be a concern of yours.  Humans will simply re-produce.  It is what they do.  There will be another Ethan and Paul out there very soon, I’m sure of it.”

Waggy Maggie grabbed my left arm and started to drag me to the elevator.

“No!  Let me go!”

“I will admit, your fleshy appearances are rather likeable.  This skin suit I’ve been wearing does please me when I look at your mirrors.”

Before Waggy Maggie got me into the elevator, I heard glass shatter.  I looked behind me.  Chrissie Crumb had broken out of her room.  She came charging at us and tackled Waggie Maggie to the ground.  I watched her bite right into Waggie Maggie’s face, pulling out chunks of wire.  She continued to chew off pieces of her face until there was nothing left. 

“Follow me, we need to get out of here,” she said to me.

We took the elevator up and stepped out onto the ground level where I had first entered the building.  We heard commotion from the room where the show was filmed.  In the studio, Paul’s father and several other officers were firing guns at rabid audience members.  Dozens of these alien-like beings no longer looked human.  The human skin coverings were melting and sliding off their bodies.

Paul’s father looked back at me.  “Get outside!  We’ve got this!”

I didn’t have it in me to tell him his son was dead.  Chrisse Crumb guided me to the front of the building and back outside to the parking lot.  We watched as the building rumbled violently.

“Ethan!” I heard Mom scream from behind me.

She ran up to me and hugged me.  “Are you okay?”

I nodded.  Next to Mom was Tina.

“I was watching the show and saw you on there.  I went to the restaurant to tell your mom to check it out, so she turned it on at the diner, but after you disappeared below the floor and never showed up again, she got worried.  So, we headed over here.”

Paul’s father emerged from the door with the other officers.  “Back up, back way up, this place is going to crumble!” he shouted.

We ran back to the street behind the parking lot.  Together, we watched as the building slowly broke apart and fell into the water.

“Ethan, do you know where Paul is?” Paul’s father asked me.  “He never leaves your side.”

“I’m sorry.  He didn’t make it.  Those things got him,” came out of my mouth.

Paul’s father wiped a tear from his cheek.  He bent down to my level and hugged me.  I learned that Chrissie Crumb had competed on the first episode of the show in another city, and that the aliens promised to keep her alive as long as she continued to win. 

Woodward Harbor was never the same after that night.  Five kids, including Paul had perished.  We never fully understood how Waggy Maggie and the others functioned.  Once Chrissie Crumb had killed Waggy Maggie, it’s like the others malfunctioned and went into a frenzy.

For years, my eating habits continued to spiral for the worse.  With Paul gone, my urge to turn to food for comfort grew to an alarming level.  It was not until I was old enough to move out of that town and distance myself from the town and the events that took place, was I then able to get things under control with my weight. 

I hate to say it though, but Waggie Maggie was right.  We humans are obsessed with eating.  And I don’t know whether that is a good or bad thing.  It doesn’t really matter.  I just wish Paul was still around.
