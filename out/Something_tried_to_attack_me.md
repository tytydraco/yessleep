It's my first time posting here. After I came across other stories read in a podcast, I had to come here and tell you this.

Here are some information for context:

I really don't mean to sound "woke" or anything, but my father and I are polar opposites. He makes racists comments, homophobic ones (even kicked out my older brother of the house for being gay), says nasty stuff about poor people and so much more. I try to look at things in a logical way, and his comments never made any sense. We were always arguing, and he would constantly accuse me of being "woke" (which I believe is the best translation for the word he used - we're not native to a English speaking country). I'm also, to put the cherry on top, bisexual. So not only I disagree with his world view, I'm also part of one of the groups he despises.

With that being said, this took place March last year. I had traveled to see his new apartment, and spent the week there.  It was weirdly uncomfortable, in a way I couldn't explain. You know when in a horror movie, the main character feels something is wrong but can't but their finger on it? That was it. I had horrible nights, couldn't sleep well, and would constantly feel like I wasn't alone in the guest room. I considered leaving early, but I knew this would break of an argument, so I stayed. 

On my last day there, I told my new step mom what I was feeling, and she told me she had a similar feeling about the apartment too, but that this was also something she felt about the old house. Then, this comment clicked something in me: I've felt like this everytime I was in his houses. I brushed over a few weird and hard to explain experiences. Listening to whispers as a child, seeing shadows moving, etc. When I was younger, I tried to tell my father about it, because I was trying to understand what the hell was happening. But he always got defensive, telling me I must have a great imagination and that it was probably something I could just ignore. So that's what I tried to do for years. Since I was 18, I would avoid visiting him, spending no more than two days in his house.

Something felt different about that conversation with my step-mother, though. As if, for the first time, someone believed me. And I could see she believed me because she also knew something was wrong. I also like to believe that the others step-moms felt it too, because none of them could spend more than 6 months living with my father without breaking up with him and moving away.

Well, eventually I came back home, and told my fiancee about what I felt there and about my conversation with my step mother. He validated what I felt, and we talked to a friend about ways I could protect myself if I visited there, and recommendations for my step mother. (Cleaning the house in a spiritual way, crystals, ANYTHING that could give us peace in that place).

In my first night back home, I dreamt I was back in that apartment. I swear to God it felt like I was actually there, walking around the rooms. But, I could smell something rotting away. And in this very vivid dream, I thought that "if I can just go to sleep, I will be able to ignore it". Then I went to the guest room and set on the bed. Then I heard a whisper saying "wake up". I ignored, then it yelled in my ear: WAKE UP!

When I opened my eyes, I was in my bed, back-to-back with my fiancee, but it wasn't only the two of us in the bedroom. Right in front of me, I saw a woman. She was covered in blood, and her jaw was missing, dripping blood from it. She screamed, trying to jump into bed to get me.

I obviously started screaming, and it woke up my fiancee, who hugged me until I stopped. It took a few seconds until that woman actually disappear. My fiancee didn't see anything, but our two cats ran from the bed and started hissing at the door, both really scared. They only calmed down once we turned on the lights and hit the walls with one leaf of a snake plant (it's an old "superstition" from my country, to clean the rooms from evil spirits, and my grandmother used to do that when we had nightmares).

I don't know what that was. But I felt like that woman felt in danger somehow, and that she was trying to protect my father from me. She seemed evil, that I know.

After that, I made the decision of opening up about who I am to my father, because I knew he would shunt me off from the family just like he did with my brother. And that's what happened. It's been over a year since I heard from him, and I've been feeling way better than I ever felt before. As if I'm free. Things are finally starting to work out for me, and I don't feel like this was just a coincidence.

Last I heard from my father, because a cousin of my mentioned in a phone call (even though I told her I didn't want to hear anything about him), my step mother moved away and broke up with him a couple of months after that happened. I don't know why, but I can only imagine.

Recently I've been starting to consider possibilities for it. And that can be ridiculous, because it came to me after watching a horror movie, but: we all come from a very poor family, and somehow he became a millionaire. He never finished elementary school, though. But all his business were successful, despite him being very vague about what he actually does. Even though he has all that money, and trust me, it's a lot, he was always alone. None of his friends please him, never had actual visitor in the house (only the occasional family member who enjoys spending holidays in a fancy house for free), none of his relationships lasted... My brother and I are his only children, and although we really tried (I mean it!!!), he never actually loved us. He would say that, actually. He would see us as obligations. We never demanded any of his money, not even before he kicked us of our house. None of our family members feeds from his money too... Is it possible there's something actually supernatural that he did to get all that money? I don't want to believe it, but it would make sense.

Well, that's what happened... I would appreciate some theories as to what happened that day. Although I've never had any other weird experience, since we stopped talking, I still feel curious as to what the hell happened to me and who that woman was...

(I'm sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes. I plan on reviewing it later, and I appreciate any takes on it as well)
