Nicole and I were on our yearly winter trip in the Georgia woods when this nightmare began. On our third night camping, we discovered that our firewood was soaked from rain the day before. We swore we had covered the wood in the bed of the truck, but still somehow the logs were wet. 

The sun was setting and temperatures were dropping. With a chance of snow in the forecast and a guarantee of it being bone-chillingly cold, we decided to head off toward the nearest store for dry wood. 

As we made our way, moonlight lit up the wintery skeletonized trees surrounding both sides of the road. February’s Snow Moon was in full effect.

We were driving along the only real highway through the mountain. Some would say the road at dark was a bit eerie. While it was a route I was familiar with and found particularly beautiful, I too would agree the highway at night carried a sense of heaviness with it. 

Not long into the drive, the truck started to shake, and before we knew it, the right front tire appeared in shredded pieces in the rearview mirror. 

“Unbelievable. These tires aren’t even that old!”Nicole exclaimed. 

We carefully got out of the truck and were surprised to see that not only the front right tire was blown-out but the back right tire was also in bad shape. This was a big problem. We only had one spare tire. 

I sighed, “And this is exactly why we always have a satellite phone with us. We should be able to get a tow out here before too long.” 

We waited nearly two hours for a tow truck to arrive. The driver, Bill, had been in the middle of dinner when he got the message a truck was stranded on the mountain. With the understanding he would finish his dinner and an extra fee tacked-on, Bill agreed to tow the truck to the local shop and then drop us off at the nearest motel for the night. 

“You ladies are lucky you know. I don’t always do night calls this time of year. The wife likes me home at dark.” Bill said.

“Have you lived in the area long?” Nicole asked.

“All 60 years of my life.” Bill responded. 

“That’s awesome.” I said tiredly, hoping the conversation would end there. 

Bill yawned and continued to say, “Yep. Lived here 60 years. Been towing for about 30 of ‘em. This mountain road is like an old friend.”

I moved my face closer to the window. Despite the glare, I could see snow beginning to fall. “I wasn’t expecting snow this early.” I said. 

Bill took a closer look out the windshield, “Never can predict the weather here on the mountain too well. It always seems like it’s changing.” 

“Well, considering the snow now, I’m not mad about staying in a motel tonight. A hot shower and a room with heat sounds pretty great right about now.” Nicole said.

Bill began to slow down. 

The truck was rolling to a stop when I saw something quickly maneuver through the leafless trees beside me. It was like a flash of white was weaving itself through the forest. 

“What was that?” I said. 

No one acknowledged I said anything, which was fair enough. The truck coming to a stop was a justifiable distraction. 

“Why are we stopped?” Nicole asked with a slight sense of irritation. 

“Look straight ahead,” Bill said. “You don’t see all those eyes staring back at us?”

“Oh! I didn’t even see them!” Nicole responded.

As the snow was continuing to fall, a family of deer was making their way down the mountain, crossing the highway. 

“They’re so beautiful.” I said quietly.

“Why are they just staring at us?” Nicole muttered, as if she was judging them and not actually asking a question. 

Bill honked the horn to scare the deer out of the way. Much to his dismay, the deer didn’t budge. 

He put the truck in park and said, “Staring like deers in a headlight. I’m going to go shoo them off. I’m not trying to be up here on the mountain all night”.

Nicole and I exchanged the look we give each other when we’re on the verge of losing it. We were hungry, tired, and very over the entire evening. This was not the relaxing night we had been hoping for. 

I looked closer through the windshield and saw Bill walking toward the deer who were standing like statues, still staring at us. I saw something white now slowly moving from one side of the woods toward the deer…and Bill. 

“Do you see that?” I asked. 

“What is that? Another deer?” Nicole replied. 

Bill was getting closer to the deer and mysterious white thing. 

“Wait, is that a person?” I asked.

“I can’t see closely enough. How are the deer not running away yet?” Nicole responded. 

Bill was now within a couple of feet of the deer. The deer still weren’t moving, and the mystery being was still creeping closer. A bad feeling washed over me. 

I rolled down my window and stuck my head out, “everything okay?” I nervously asked. 

The only response we got from Bill was the sounds of him shouting, “No No No!” and screaming the most horrific scream as he fell from the cliffside. As soon as silence struck, the family of deer finally made their way across the snowy highway.  

We leapt out of the truck. With adrenaline pumping, we ran toward where Bill, the deer, and mystery creature — who we had briefly put out of our minds — had been.

Nicole and I peered over the cliffside and saw Bill splayed out below. He was probably 20 feet down. There was no even semi-safe way for us to get down to him. 

“Is he dead? He’s dead isn’t he? Nicole said with her voice shaking. 

“I think so. I don’t see how he could have survived that. Did he slip? I asked. 

“He must have slipped or tripped or something. Maybe a deer moved toward him and scared him?” Nicole responded.

“I didn’t see any of the deer move. We should get back to the truck and message for help.” I said. 

As we turned to head back to the truck, there we saw it. Well, not it. Her. A girl no older than maybe 16 stood a few feet in front of us. She was wearing a long white dress and had her long blonde hair tied back in a white ribbon. I wiped snow from my eyelash. She was smiling at us. 

As fast as we saw her, she was gone. 

Nicole and I looked at each other, terrified. We ran like hell back to the truck, jumped inside, and locked the doors. 

“Quick! Where’s the satellite phone?” I shouted. 

We messaged for emergency help and waited in the truck until they arrived. Crew worked to get down to Bill who was pronounced dead at the scene. While the team worked to retrieve Bill’s body, police questioned us. We told them about the deer and why Bill was in the road. We told them about the girl. They looked at us funnily. One of them said something to the effect of that between the shock and the snow partially obstructing our vision, it’d be easy to think we saw something we didn’t. They quickly ruled Bill’s death an accident. He slipped off the side of the mountain road when he was trying to get the deer to move. Hazard of the job.

Once crews figured out who could safely maneuver Bill’s truck (and our truck) off the mountain highway, we were finally driven to the motel for the night.

Even in a warm room, I couldn’t fall asleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the girl in white’s grin. That awful, haunting grin. Perhaps due to a mixture of restlessness and desperation to understand what we saw, I grabbed my phone. I searched for articles from this part of the Georgia woods that included information about a teenage girl or a white dress. 

Tabatha Warren

Age: 15

Missing since: February 24, 2005

Last seen in a white dress, hair tied-up, leaving evening prayer group at church 

There it was. Right before my eyes. I could never mistake that face. The girl in the white dress. Tabatha.

“Nicole, wake up! Wake up!” I shouted with an urgency I’d never felt before. 

Turning on her side, Nicole reluctantly opened her eyes. “What is it?”

I sat on her bed. “The girl we saw. Her name is Tabatha. She disappeared in 2005 after leaving church. The last person who saw her was tow-truck Bill. He had offered her a ride home from the church there on the mountain. Bill was the main suspect, but the police were never able to build a case against him. There wasn’t any evidence. Tabatha was never found.”

“So we found a missing girl?” Nicole groggily said.

“Nicole, the girl went missing decades ago. Think about it. How could she still look like a teenager? Tabatha Warren isn’t missing. She’s dead. The girl in white is a ghost.” I said. 

Nicole reached over to grab my phone and look at Tabatha’s picture. 

I walked over to the window and admired how the  illumination from the Snow Moon made even the motel’s desolate parking lot look interesting. 

“Wait, it says she went missing in February, right? Let me see my phone for a minute.” I said.

I searched February Snow Moon 2005 and learned it was on the 24th. The night Tabatha went missing. 

Countless thoughts raced through my mind. This certainly couldn’t be a coincidence. Tabatha disappeared during a February Snow Moon after tow-truck Bill offered her a ride home from the church on the mountain. Two decades later, on a February Snow Moon, Tabatha re-appeared on the same mountain she went missing from to face her killer. Bill’s death wasn’t an accident. It was retribution. She had been waiting for his return to the mountain on a Snow Moon. Her haunting grin made sense now. 

Nicole and I knew it would be futile to try to convince the police of any of this, but we did inquire about what part of the mountain was searched when Tabatha went missing. We spoke to the church staff, too. Everyone shared the same sentiment when we brought Tabatha up. They all felt that talking about her was tearing open old wounds for the community. Her case was a sad stain on the town. She could be thought about but wasn’t meant to be talked about. (It’s a southern thing, I guess.) 

We also learned that Tabatha didn’t have any living family members to speak of. She was an only child, and her Mom and Dad’s health rapidly declined after she went missing. 

While Tabatha’s remains may never be found, she’s made that mountain home. She got her vengeance. She has a new community, like the family of deer who helped her execute her plan. Seems she even made friends with the wind who ensured snowfall blew in early on the mountain that night. 

Nicole and I don’t camp on that mountain anymore. But when I’m in the area, I drive the highway and wave at every deer I see. And I think about the girl in the white dress who waited two decades for tow-truck Bill to return to the mountain on a February Snow Moon so she could finally introduce him to his hideous fate. 

Rest in Peace, Tabatha Warren.
