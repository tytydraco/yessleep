Something is wrong with the count.

I'm awake before I know why, hand already on the knife at my belt, breath held tight in my chest. Above me, my tarp ripples in a wind I don't feel. The forest is silent—not quiet, *silent*—and in that absence of sound, I understand what woke me.

The acorns stopped falling.

Let me back up.

My day job is management consulting. Boutique firm, mid-size clients, the kind of work where you spend sixty hours a week staring at spreadsheets and crafting deliverables that will sit unread in someone's inbox. I'm good at it. I've built a career on helping companies make sense of chaos, on finding patterns in data, on *counting things* that matter.

But a decade ago, I was burning out. The kind of slow-motion collapse where you don't realize how far gone you are until you're snapping at baristas and lying awake at 3 AM running mental models on client retention rates. I needed something that wasn't screens and spreadsheets. Something real.

I'd always been fascinated by 17th and 18th century colonial history—the settlement period, when European colonists were learning to survive in a landscape that didn't care whether they lived or died. I started reading primary sources. Journals from settlers in New England. Account books from frontier outposts. The practical knowledge they developed just to make it through winter.

That's what led me to bushcraft. Not some romantic notion of "getting back to nature," but a historian's curiosity about how people actually survived before the systems we take for granted existed. I wanted to understand it with my hands, not just my head.

What started as weekend experiments turned into an obsession. I devoured everything—Mors Kochanski's technical precision, Dave Canterbury's practical self-reliance, hours of practice in the mixed hardwood forests of Western Massachusetts until I could build a fire in the rain and identify edible plants by touch. The contrast was intoxicating. Monday through Friday, I lived in a world of abstractions—revenue projections, organizational charts, the politics of conference room seating. But weekends? Weekends I lived in a world where the only metrics that mattered were warmth, shelter, and water.

Eventually, I started teaching. Certification courses, then my own curriculum. I've run hundreds of overnights now. I know these woods the way I know a balance sheet—every line item, every variable, every noise the forest makes at night.

Which is why I knew something was wrong long before I admitted it to myself.

This was a fall overnight course—basic wilderness survival, eight students ranging from college kids to a retired accountant who'd watched too many YouTube videos. The assignment was simple: build a natural debris shelter, start a fire with a ferro rod, tend that fire through the night. I'd done this class maybe two hundred times. Routine.

My setup was a hammock with a tarp, positioned centrally so I could monitor all the shelters. Not because I expected trouble. Because hypothermia doesn't announce itself, and a student who lets their fire die at 3 AM doesn't always have the sense to rebuild it.

The first acorn hit my tarp around 11 PM.

I smiled. Squirrels cache aggressively this time of year, and the oaks were heavy with mast. Nothing unusual about a territorial red squirrel expressing displeasure at my presence in its territory. I'd had them throw sticks at me before, chatter at me for hours. Part of the job.

But the acorns kept coming. One every few minutes. Always on my tarp. Never on the ground beside me, never on my hammock—always that distinctive *tap* against the nylon above my head.

Around midnight, I flicked on my headlamp and aimed it up into the canopy. Nothing. The branches were empty, or at least empty of anything my light could find. I told myself the squirrel had moved. I turned off the lamp.

*Tap.*

I did a mental check of my students. Seven small fires glowing in the darkness, seven shelter silhouettes. Everyone accounted for. I let my eyes close.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I don't know exactly when I started counting. Somewhere around 2 AM, probably, when sleep deprivation begins to play tricks on pattern recognition. But once I noticed, I couldn't un-notice.

Three quick taps. Pause. Three quick taps. Pause.

I sat up, and the pattern stopped.

I lay back down.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.* Pause. *Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I checked my watch. Timed the intervals. Thirty-seven seconds between sets. I waited. Thirty-seven seconds. Exactly.

The consultant in me appreciated the precision. The part of me that had learned to trust the woods did not.

"You're tired," I whispered to myself. "This is what brains do."

Brains find patterns. It's a survival mechanism, an evolutionary advantage that kept our ancestors from being eaten by things with stripes. The human mind will find faces in clouds, meaning in static, rhythm in random noise. I was exhausted, cold, and my brain was doing what brains do.

I believed that for almost an hour.

Then one of my students' fires went out.

I watched the glow fade from orange to red to nothing, waiting for the telltale movement of someone emerging to rebuild. The debris shelters weren't much more than glorified leaf piles with structural support—I could see the outlines clearly enough. But the student didn't emerge. Didn't stir.

"Hey," I called softly. "Shelter four. Your fire's out."

No answer. Probably deep asleep. I'd give them a few minutes, then go check—

*Tap.*

But this one was different. Heavier. The sound it made against the tarp wasn't the dry rattle of an acorn. It was... wet. Muffled.

I didn't look at what fell. Not right away. I told myself I was prioritizing—student safety first, mysterious debris second. But I think, even then, some part of me already knew.

When I finally pointed my headlamp down at what had landed beside my hammock, I told myself it was owl pellet debris. A rodent femur, picked clean. That's all. Owls regurgitate bones all the time, and if one was roosting above me, hunting the same area that squirrel was working—

Another bone fell. Different this time. Longer. Too long for a rodent.

Too clean. No pellet residue. No fur. Just smooth white bone, gleaming wet in my lamplight. And at the end of it—I didn't want to see this, but I saw it—a joint. The kind of joint that bends. The kind of joint that belongs to something with *fingers*.

They were landing in the same spot. Precisely. Exactly. As if placed.

As if *presented*.

I checked the shelters. All seven students present, all breathing—I watched long enough to see the rise and fall of chests, the subtle shift of bodies seeking warmth. But something was off. One of them, shelter six, was sleeping *outside* their structure. Curled up in the leaf litter maybe ten feet away, like they'd crawled out in the night and just... stopped.

"Hey." I shook her shoulder gently. "Emily. Emily, wake up."

She came awake confused, disoriented in the way of someone pulled from deep sleep. "What? What's wrong?"

"You're outside your shelter. Do you remember coming out here?"

She looked around, genuinely bewildered. "I... no. I was inside. I remember being inside, I remember watching the fire—" She looked toward her shelter. The fire had gone cold. Dead ash.

"It's okay," I said. "Let's get you back. We'll rebuild the fire."

I helped her up, and as we walked back toward the ring of shelters, I counted them. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

Eight.

I stopped. Counted again.

Seven.

Seven shelters. Seven students. Emily made seven. I'd miscounted.

In fifteen years of consulting, I've never miscounted anything that mattered. Numbers are my language. Numbers don't lie.

"You okay?" she asked.

"Yeah. Yeah, fine. Just tired."

I got her fire rebuilt, got her settled back inside her shelter, and returned to my hammock.

The moment I lay down: *tap.*

I looked at what fell. A tooth. Human molar. Fresh enough that I could see the root, pink with tissue.

I should have woken everyone. I know that now. But I'd built my reputation on being unshakeable—the guy who *knows* these woods, who's slept in them hundreds of times, who tells nervous students that the scariest thing out here is hypothermia and their own panic. Admitting something was wrong meant admitting I'd lost control of my own territory.

Pride kept me in that hammock. Pride, and something else—a desperate need to understand the rules before I made a move. In consulting, you never act until you understand the system. You observe. You gather data. You find the pattern.

So I stayed. And I watched. And I counted.

I lay there with my eyes open, staring at the tarp above me, waiting.

Nothing fell.

I closed my eyes—just for a second, just to rest them—

*Tap.*

Eyes open. Nothing.

Eyes closed.

*Tap. Tap.*

I understood then. It knew when I was watching. It only moved, only acted, when my attention lapsed. When I wasn't looking.

Or maybe—and this thought came slower, colder—it wasn't about seeing at all. Maybe it could tell when I stopped *counting*. When my mind drifted. When I lost track.

I counted the shelters again. Seven. Counted the students, checking each sleeping form. Seven.

So why had I seen eight before?

Around 3 AM, I remembered something.

Earlier that evening, around the campfire, one of my students had asked if I'd ever experienced "anything weird" out here. It's a question I get a lot. People want ghost stories. They want to believe the woods are haunted by something more interesting than cold and poor decision-making.

I gave my standard answer: "The scariest thing in these woods is hypothermia and your own panic. Master those, and you'll be fine."

But one of the students—Marcus, the retired accountant—had leaned in and said, "I read something about these woods. Local history stuff. Something about a counting game?"

I'd shut it down. Bad practice to tell ghost stories before an overnight, especially to inexperienced students. The mind is suggestible enough in the dark without help.

But now, lying in my hammock with a human tooth in the leaves beside me, I wished I'd let him finish.

*Something about a counting game.*

Marcus was in shelter three. I could see his outline from here, motionless in sleep. I thought about waking him, asking him what he'd read.

*Tap.*

I closed my eyes without meaning to.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Three. Always three.

The next time I checked, one shelter was empty.

I didn't panic. I couldn't afford to panic—panic spreads, and seven frightened students in the dark woods would be far more dangerous than whatever was dropping bones on my tarp. I moved quietly, methodically, shelter to shelter.

Six students accounted for. Marcus was missing.

His sleeping bag was still warm. He'd been there minutes ago.

"Marcus?" I kept my voice calm, projected but not shouting. "Marcus, if you can hear me, call out."

Nothing. The forest had that silence again, that *wrong* silence, like the night itself was holding its breath.

I found him fifty yards out, sitting against an oak tree, staring at nothing. His eyes were open but unfocused, his hands folded in his lap like a child waiting to be called on in class. His lips were moving.

"Marcus." I crouched in front of him. "Marcus, can you hear me?"

He didn't respond. His lips kept moving. I leaned closer, and I heard what he was whispering.

Numbers. He was counting. But the sequence was wrong—not sequential, not patterned in any way I recognized. Random numbers, enormous numbers, negative numbers, numbers that didn't sound like numbers at all.

"Marcus." I grabbed his shoulders, shook him.

He blinked. Once, twice. Then looked at me with an expression of vague confusion. "Did I fall asleep?"

"You walked out here. Do you remember?"

"I was... counting." He frowned. "I was counting something. I don't remember what." His hand went to his mouth, touched his teeth. "My jaw hurts."

I didn't tell him about the tooth. I don't know whose it was. I don't want to know.

I helped him up, helped him back to his shelter. The walk felt longer than it should have. I counted steps without meaning to. One, two, three, four—

And then I saw the shelters, and there were eight of them.

Eight. Definitely eight. I could see them all clearly in the faint moonlight filtering through the canopy. Seven that my students had built—and one more. Set apart from the others. Made of debris, yes, branches and leaves and deadfall, but the proportions were *wrong*. The angles were wrong. Like something had seen a shelter, understood the concept of a shelter, but didn't quite understand what a shelter was *for*.

And it was breathing. The whole structure, rising and falling, slow and rhythmic.

"Do you see that?" I asked Marcus.

"See what?"

He was looking right at it. Right at it, and he didn't see it.

I didn't answer. I got him back to his own shelter, rebuilt his fire, and returned to my hammock.

The drops were faster now. Frantic, almost.

*Tap tap tap tap tap—*

I didn't close my eyes. I didn't dare. But even with my eyes open, watching, I could see movement at the edge of my vision. The eighth shelter. Something shifting inside it. Or around it. Or—

Don't look directly. The thought came from nowhere, but I knew it was true. I knew it the way you know not to touch a hot stove. Looking directly would be wrong. Would be dangerous.

But it wanted me to look. The drops slowed when my gaze stayed fixed on the tarp. Sped up when my attention drifted toward that wrong shape at the edge of the clearing.

*It wanted me to count it.*

A scream.

I was running before I knew I was moving, crashing through underbrush, pushing past branches. Shelter five—Jake, the college kid who'd been so confident at the start of the night. His fire had erupted, flames leaping three feet high, but the light was wrong. Cold. Blue-white instead of orange. And the heat—

There was no heat. I was standing close enough that my eyebrows should have been singed, and I felt nothing. Nothing but cold.

"I saw something!" Jake was scrambling backward, away from his fire. "In the flames—there was a face—"

"It's okay." I grabbed his shoulders, turned him away from the fire. "You're okay. It's a trick of the light, it's—"

The fire was normal again. Orange. Warm. Crackling softly like fires do.

"I saw it," Jake whispered. "It was counting."

"What?"

"I heard it counting. But the numbers were wrong. They were too high. And it was counting—" He stopped. Looked at me with something I hadn't seen from him all night: real fear. "It was counting *us*. But it got to a number higher than seven. Way higher. Like there were more of us than there are. Like there have *always* been more of us."

I didn't ask what he meant. I didn't want to know what he meant.

"Stay in your shelter," I told him. "Keep your fire burning. I'm going to check on everyone else."

Seven students. I counted them. All accounted for. All seven.

Seven students.

Eight shelters.

The acorns stopped at 4 AM.

The silence was worse. So much worse. I lay in my hammock with my knife in my hand and my eyes fixed on the tarp above me, waiting for the tap that didn't come.

From somewhere in the darkness, I heard whispering. Soft. Rhythmic. Counting.

But the numbers were wrong. Too high, Jake had said, and now I understood what he meant. The counting went past any number my students could have reached. Past any number that made sense. It was counting things that shouldn't be countable. Things that didn't exist.

Or things that *had* existed. Things that used to be here. Things that had been *taken*.

I realized then what I'd been doing wrong all night. I'd been counting shelters. Counting students.

*It* was counting something else. Something cumulative. A running total.

I thought about all the classes I'd taught in these woods. All the students. Hundreds of them, over the years.

What if I'd miscounted before? What if I'd miscounted and never noticed?

What if the difference had been taken, and I'd simply... forgotten there was ever anything to miss?

Dawn comes slowly in fall, gray light seeping through the canopy like water through cracks. I should have felt relief. I didn't.

I looked at the eighth shelter.

In the pre-dawn dimness, I could see it clearly now. Not a shelter. A *shape*. Built of debris, yes—sticks and leaves and things I didn't want to identify—but there was nothing inside it. No hollow space for a body to shelter. It was solid. Dense. Like something that had tried to build a shelter but didn't understand that shelters are empty.

Except it wasn't entirely solid. Near the base, I could see shapes pressed into the debris. Impressions. Like faces pushing against the inside of a mask, mouths open, frozen mid-count.

And it was closer than before.

I never saw it move. But it was closer.

I counted my students. One, two, three, four, five, six—

Six.

There should be seven. There had been seven. I could name them: Emily, Marcus, Jake, David, Sarah, the woman whose name I couldn't remember—

Six. I could only count six.

Somewhere in the woods, someone was crying.

It sounded like it might be the seventh student. The one I couldn't name. The one I couldn't remember, no matter how hard I tried.

But the rhythm was wrong. The sobs came at regular intervals. Mechanical. Like something that had heard crying but didn't understand what crying was for.

And beneath the crying, barely audible: counting. Still counting. The number climbing higher with each sob.

I gathered six students at first light. I told them we were hiking out early. I told them weather was coming—a lie, but a useful one.

"What about—" Emily started, then stopped. Frowned. "Weren't there more of us?"

"Six," I said. "There were always six."

I don't know why I said that. I don't know why they believed me.

We packed up in silence. We left the shelters standing—standard practice, let them decompose naturally—and we started the three-mile hike to the trailhead.

The path took us past the eighth shelter.

I tried not to look. I told myself not to look.

I looked.

Inside, arranged in careful spirals, were thousands of acorns. Sorted by size. Organized by some system I couldn't comprehend. Counted, I realized. They had been *counted*.

And sitting among them, placed precisely in the center, were seven objects.

A hiking boot. A wedding ring. A child's barrette—pink plastic, faded. A hearing aid. A set of car keys. A glasses case. A phone, its screen still glowing with an unread message.

Seven objects. I've never allowed children in my classes. I don't know whose child wore that barrette. I don't know how long it's been collecting.

I didn't stop. I didn't let my students stop. We walked until the trees thinned and the parking lot appeared and the world felt real again.

But the parking lot had seven cars in it. And I could only count six students.

Search and rescue found *a* student three miles from our campsite. Hypothermic but alive. 

They said he matched the description.

But when I visited him in the hospital, something was wrong.

He answered to the right name. He had the right face. But his eyes kept drifting to the corners of the room, and his lips moved silently. Counting. Always counting.

"Do you remember the class?" I asked him.

He looked at me. Through me. "I wasn't in your class," he said. "I've never been in your class. I was already in the woods when you arrived."

I felt the floor tilt beneath me. "What do you mean?"

"I've been in the woods for a very long time," he said. His voice was flat. Rhythmic. "I was counting before you got there. I'll be counting after you're gone."

He smiled. His gums were empty where two teeth should have been.

"You miscounted," he said. "You always miscount. That's why it likes you."

I left. I didn't look back. In the hallway, I passed a nurse who asked if I was family. I said no.

"Strange case," she said. "No ID. No records. It's like he didn't exist before we found him."

I didn't answer. I walked to my car and sat in the parking lot for an hour, counting my own heartbeats until they stopped shaking.

I didn't mention the eighth shelter. When I went back with the SAR team to collect our gear, it was gone. Just a pile of leaves and sticks that could have been anything. Natural debris. Nothing worth noting.

Except for the impression in the center of the pile. Body-shaped. Body-sized. Like something had been lying there, curled up, waiting.

And the acorns. Scattered everywhere. Thousands of them. Far more than could have fallen from the trees above.

One of the SAR team picked one up, turned it over in his hand. "Weird," he said. "This one has marks on it. Like tally marks."

I didn't look. I already knew what they were counting.

After that night, I did what I should have done during the campfire. I looked up what Marcus had read.

It took weeks of digging through local historical archives—the kind of primary source work I used to do for fun, back when colonial history was just an academic interest and not a survival manual. Newspaper clippings from 1892, brittle and faded, about settlers in these woods. Letters from a minister to his congregation warning them about walking the forest at night.

They called it *Wald-Zähler*. The Forest Counter.

The accounts were fragmentary. Contradictory. But certain details appeared again and again.

It was attracted to groups. It tested them by adding to their number—one more shadow at the edge of the firelight, one more voice in the darkness, one more shape that didn't belong. If you counted wrong—if you accepted the addition, if you failed to notice the extra—you confirmed something about yourself.

You confirmed you couldn't be trusted to notice what was missing.

And that's when it started subtracting.

The minister's letter was the clearest. "It counts what we cannot," he wrote. "It keeps a tally we dare not examine. And every error in our count becomes an entry in its ledger. The debt is always collected. The difference is always taken."

The letter was dated November 1892. The minister vanished two weeks later. His congregation reported that on the night he disappeared, they counted thirteen people at evening service.

There had only ever been twelve members of that church.

I thought about those 18th century settlers I used to read about. The ones who kept meticulous records of everything—births, deaths, livestock, supplies. I used to admire their precision. Now I wonder if they were counting for the same reason I count now.

Not to track what they had.

To track what they were losing.

I should have stopped teaching after that. I know that. Any reasonable person would have walked away.

But these are my woods. I've given a decade of my life to them—every weekend I could spare from client calls and deliverables, every vacation day I could justify. The woods were supposed to be my escape from the spreadsheets, from the endless counting that defined my professional life. Instead, they've become the place where counting matters most.

So I keep teaching. Keep running courses. Keep sleeping in my hammock under my tarp while students tend their fires.

But I count differently now.

I count obsessively. Every student, every shelter, every acorn that falls on my tarp. I count the trees at the edge of the clearing. I count my own heartbeats. I count because I understand now what I didn't understand before.

That night, something was counting too.

And I'm not sure I got the number right.

Here's the thing about numbers, the thing I've learned in fifteen years of consulting: a count is only as good as your methodology. If you don't know what you're counting, the number means nothing. I thought I was counting students. Counting shelters.

But it was counting something else. Something I couldn't see. And every time I miscounted—every time my attention slipped—the difference between its count and mine became *real*.

Became *taken*.

Last week, I took another overnight class to those same woods. Seven students this time. Seven shelters. I counted before sleep, and the count was right.

But this morning, I woke to an acorn on my tarp.

And when I counted the shelters in the gray pre-dawn light, I counted eight.

I counted my students. Six.

There's a seventh car in the parking lot. It's been there since we arrived. I don't know whose it is. None of my students recognize it.

I've been counting all day. Everything. Everyone. I can't stop. I don't dare stop.

Because I think if I ever lose count—if my attention lapses, if I let a number slip—

It gets to take the difference.

And lately, I've started hearing something in the walls of my apartment. Soft. Rhythmic.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I don't think the woods are the only place it lives anymore.

I don't think the woods were ever the point.

It was always about the counting. About the gap between what we think is there and what's actually there. About the space where things can be added—or subtracted—without anyone noticing.

I went through my class records last night. Rosters going back ten years. Names and numbers. I counted them against my memory.

The numbers don't match.

There are names on those rosters I don't recognize. People I have no memory of teaching. And there are gaps—classes where I remember seven students but only six names are written down. Classes where the headcount in my notes doesn't match the signatures on the waivers.

I've been miscounting for years.

The difference has been taken. Again and again and again. And I never noticed because you can't miss what you never knew was there.

I need to stop writing now. I need to count something.

But before I go, I want you to do something for me. Go back to the beginning of this story. Count how many students I said were in my class.

I said eight.

I've been saying seven this whole time.

I don't remember the eighth student. I can't picture their face. I don't know their name.

But they were there. They must have been there. I *wrote* eight.

So where did they go?

And how long before the count changes...
