It has taken me a very long time to finally write this, but after a lot of therapy, alcohol, and my wonderful husband. I think I can put this out there and finally move past all of this. Seventeen years ago, a family moved in next to my dad’s house that would forever change the course of my entire life. My name is Philip, and this is my experience with the Anderson family. 

The year was 2007, I was a senior in high school and looking forward to graduating and moving out of my dad’s house. It was a Saturday night in November, and I was up late playing some Super Mario Galaxy on my Wii. As I was picking up an extra mushroom, there was a sudden bright green flash that began illuminating my window. Setting my remote down, I got up to look outside and see what was causing the light. It was coming from the second-story window of the house next door.  

After several seconds, the light ceased, restoring darkness to the neighborhood. “What the hell?” I said to myself. My face was practically smushed against the glass as I was trying to see into the neighboring window. I could faintly make out the outlines of three people. They seemed to be talking to each other. I knew for a fact no one lived in that house, my dad is a real-estate agent who has been trying to sell it for months. I looked over at the front yard of the house and still saw the for-sale sign planted in the ground. As my eyes returned to the second-story window, I nearly fell backwards when I saw all three figures staring back at me.  

I quickly pulled the curtains to my windows shut and cursed to myself. “Brand new neighbors and they already think you’re a stalker.” I looked over at my alarm clock and saw it read 3:21 A.M. I shut off my Wii and collapsed in bed, shrugging off the experience as the effects of alcohol and sleep deprivation. It felt like only seconds when my alarm started ringing at nine o’clock in the morning. 

It took about an hour for me to drag myself out of bed and get ready for the day. I sat in my kitchen eating cereal when my dad came out of his room. “Why are you still eating? We gotta get going.” he said. “I’m almost done, we're not going to be late.” I told him. My father sends a message on his flip phone before shutting it and looking at me. “What have I told you? If you’re early, you’re on time. If you’re on time, you’re late, and if you’re late you’re dead.” My father is a veteran who never seemed to lose his military ways. 

 I looked at him with tired eyes. “I already feel dead.” His phone chimed and after sending a quick text he finally responded. “Walk it off, and next time go to bed earlier.” I sigh and dump my leftover cereal in the trash. After putting my dishes away, we walked out to my dad’s truck parked on the side of the road.  After sitting myself down in the passenger's seat, I close my eyes and try to get some sleep before church. “Philip.” My dad said. I pretended to be asleep, not in the mood to talk. “Philip!” he said again. I open my eyes and look at him. “What? I’m just trying to get a nap in!” I told him. My dad didn’t say anything, he just pointed outside my passenger window. I turn to see what he is pointing at and find there is a tall blonde man staring at me right outside the car door. 

“Jesus!” I yelled. My dad slapped me on the back of the head. “Don’t you say his name in vain.” I stare at the blonde man; he has eyes so blue they might even glow in the dark. “What the hell does the want?” I asked. “Let's ask him.” My father responded.” He presses a button on his door causing my window to slowly roll down. “Is there something we can help you with sir?” My father asked the man. The man responded, not taking his eyes off me. “Hello there! I saw you all coming out of this house here and I figured I should introduce myself. I’m your all's new neighbor, me and my family just moved into number 321 here right beside you.” My father looked very confused. “321? You couldn’t have moved in. I’m the agent for that house, I haven’t sold it.” The man continued looking at me before finally glancing at my father. There was an awkward silence as they stared at each other, it was as if the man was looking through my father. 

He finally responded after what felt like an eternity. “I’m sorry I don’t know what to tell you. We moved in last night; I have all the papers inside if you wish to come see.” My dad considered this for a moment before finally deciding that he didn’t want to miss church. “No that won’t be necessary, I’m probably just mistaken. I’d love to stay and chat with you all but I’m afraid we gotta get going to God’s house.” The man smiled widely. “I completely understand, you all have a nice day now. My names Mike by the way, I’m sure we’ll be great friends.” I look over at Mike’s front porch to see a man about my age looking over at us. I assume it must be Mike’s son since he has the same bright blond hair and startling blue eyes. I give him a light wave which he returns. 

“I’m David, and I’m sure you’re right. We’ll see you all around!” my dad says. Mike steps back away from the car. “David, Philip, you all be safe.” He gives us a big grin and my dad rolls up the window and begins to drive off. “He gives me the creeps.” I spoke. My dad responded, “You’re telling me, no way in hell that house got sold without me knowing. I’m calling the office right after service.” I wish in that moment me and my father would have connected more pieces. How he seemed to really want my dad to come inside the house, or how his moving story made absolutely no sense. Most of all, I wished one of us had realized that he knew my name, without anyone ever telling him.
