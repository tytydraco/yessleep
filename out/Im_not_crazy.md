I hope to God he doesn't come over. I've been seeing him everywhere I go. My parents don't believe me when I tell them he's there. My friends don't believe me. I've been running and moving since I was young to avoid him but no matter where I go he's always there. 

It all started when I was younger. I was sick, really really sick. But with the help of a lot of doctors I got better. The doctors said that I have to take the some medicine for the rest of my life but when I grew a little older I forgot to take them for a week. After that week I realised that I wasn't getting sick anymore and stopped. My parents didn't even notice that I stopped so I never took them again.

Around this time I was 16 and I met Roger. He smiled at me and noticed me. We walked home from school together everyday and he was always there for me. He encouraged me to go for the things I love and kept me company when I had no one. He was my best friend. I was living for him and I would've died for him. He was everything to me and I know that I was everything to him.

Things went wrong after Roger started to fall for me. I saw him as a close friend and wasn't interested in him in that way and I trusted him so when he confessed his feelings I was comfortable enough to tell him that I didn't feel the same. I expected him to understand and for us to move on because we were that close and he was a great friend. Instead he exploded on me. He accused me of leading him on and called me a lot of different names. I was so mad and hurt but I tried to calm him down and tell him that he's being hurtful. He got even angrier. He screamed at me even more so I walked away.

I went home and cried into my pillow that night. He kept blowing up my phone with texts and voicemails filled with insults and rage. I finally had enough and that night I blocked him. He changed his number and I blocked him again. He started attacking me on Instagram so I deactivated my accounts and changed my number. He stopped texting me but I started seeing him everywhere in real life. He'd follow me to school and send me flowers at my part time job. I told my parents whenever I saw him outside our house but they'd brush it off because he'd disappear before they saw him. They got more and more worried about me but did nothing to stop him. They asked me so many questions that had nothing to do with him.

I saved up all my money from work and my allowance and moved far away the moment I turned 18. I told no one where I was going and left in the middle of the night when no one could see me. Once I arrived at my new place I felt safer. Until I started seeing him everywhere again. At the shops,near my house and at the park. I couldn't leave my house without seeing him and I knew he wanted to hurt me. I called the police and opened a harrassment case but they told me that unless he actually hurt me there's nothing they can do. I was on my own.

I kept moving and moving and moving for years and he kept finding me. I finally mastered the courage to call my parents one day because I was at my wit's end. I couldn't do this on my own anymore. On my 21st birthday I told my parents where I was and what's been happening. The only thing my father had to say was: "my baby,my sweet child. Have you been taking your pills?". I told him I stopped when I was 16 and I didn't need them anymore. The next day my parents were on a flight to come and stay with me. 

What I didn't expect was for them to have me involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. I was so hurt. I wasn't a sick child anymore. My paranoid schizophrenia was cured when I was a child. How could they do this to me? I took the pills they gave me just to prove a point. It's obviously purely a coincidence that I never saw Roger again. But I know that he's still out there... watching me. I know it. I just know it. I'm not crazy,right?
