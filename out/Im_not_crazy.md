I’m not crazy. I knew that was what they thought, what they all thought, but they were wrong. I have spent weeks, maybe even months, trying to make them understand. Not that it mattered; nobody listens to me. They call it a breakdown, a psychotic episode. But I saw what happened. I saw the truth. I'm not crazy.

They call it a disorder, as if I was crazy. When I first came here, they tried to convince me that I was seeing things, they tried to tell me that I was crazy when I'm not, and they tried telling me that what happened was something that could've been prevented. Now I'm stuck here, nowhere to go but to those god-awful group meeting they force me to attend. In that ugly room, where there are people that, unlike me, are crazy.

The therapy room was cold, the walls are washed-out gray, like everything else in this place. This morning I sat in a circle with the other patients, who stared vacantly at the floor, lost in whatever corners of their minds held them prisoners. Across from me, the therapist sat, her expression calm and practiced. She had one of those faces that never gave anything away. I hated that. How could I know what she was thinking if she didn’t show it?

“It started slowly,” I began, my voice raspy, cracking from weeks of repeating the same story over and over. The therapist nodded, her pen ready to scribble down my words. It didn’t matter what I said; they were just notes to her, more material to analyze. “I’m not crazy,” I muttered, feeling the stares of the other patients pressing down on me.

I closed my eyes, forcing myself back to that time before it all went wrong. My job had consumed me. I was always buried in work, staying late at the office, bringing piles of paperwork home with me. I barely had time for Elena and the kids. They understood, or at least, they pretended to. Elena would say, "You’re doing this for us," whenever I apologized for missing another dinner. The truth was, I missed many dinners. I missed bedtime stories, movie nights, weekends at the park. I was always lost in the stress of deadlines, projects, promotions—the endless grind.

It was during one of those long nights at my desk that I first noticed something had changed. I came home to find the house eerily quiet, too quiet for a family with two young children. The air felt thick, suffocating. Elena was in the kitchen, standing motionless in the dark. When I flicked on the light, she jumped, as if caught in some forbidden act. She turned to me, and I swear, her eyes glinted with a strange light. Not the familiar warmth of my wife’s gaze but something cold, calculating.

“I’m just tired,” she had said, forcing a smile. I wanted to believe her. God, I wanted to believe her. But after that night, things only got worse.

I opened my eyes, returning to the sterile room. “They started changing,” I said, glancing around at the others, hoping for a flicker of understanding. There was none. The therapist kept writing, her eyes never leaving me.

“What kind of changes?” she asked, her voice cool and cynical.

“They weren’t themselves,” I continued, running a hand through my hair. “Elena’s voice… it was off. She pronounced words wrong, and there was this strange rhythm to her speech. At first, I thought she was just mocking me, making fun of how I wasn’t around much.” I shook my head, gripping the arms of my chair. “But it wasn’t a joke. It was something else. Like she was trying to pretend to be my wife.”

The kids, too, started acting strangely. I used to come home to their laughter, but now they barely spoke to me. They would sit on the couch, holding hands, watching me with wide, unblinking eyes. I would talk to them, ask them about their day, but they would just smile and stare. That smile... It wasn’t the innocent, joyful one I remembered. It was wrong, like a mask stretched over their faces.

“At night, I would wake up and find them standing in the doorway of our bedroom, just... staring,” I said, my voice quivering as I recounted those moments. “They whispered to each other. It was like listening to the wind howl through a forest, all hisses and clicks. No comprehensible words at all”

The therapist scribbled something in her notebook, glancing at me over the rim of her glasses. “And did you try talking to them about this?” she asked, her tone almost mocking. She didn’t believe me. None of them did.

“Of course, I did! I’m not crazy!” I snapped. “I asked them what they were doing, why they were acting so strange, but they’d just laugh it off. Elena would say I was working too much, that I was stressed.” I felt my anger rising, my hands clenching into fists. “I was working too much, but that didn’t mean I imagined it. I started noticing bruises on their skin, strange marks like tiny claws had scratched them. I’d ask, and they would just look at me, smiling, as if I’d asked the stupidest question in the world.”

I rubbed my temples, feeling the headache building again. It always came when I tried to remember those days. “I thought I was losing it. I even went to a doctor, got a check-up. But I was fine. There was nothing wrong with me.” I leaned forward, locking eyes with the therapist. “I’m not crazy. I know what I saw.”

My nights became sleepless. I would lie awake, listening to them move around the house, whispering, plotting. One night, I set up cameras. I needed proof, something to confirm I wasn’t imagining things. But every morning, the footage was gone, wiped clean. I confronted Elena, demanded to know what was happening. She just looked at me with that look, that cold, unfeeling stare. “You’re not well,” she said. “You’re working too hard.”

I gritted my teeth, feeling the sting of those words. They used my guilt against me, made me doubt myself. But then I saw it, and I knew. That final night... God, I’ll never forget it.

I slumped back into my chair, staring at the floor. “I came home early. I thought I’d catch them off guard.” I swallowed, my throat dry, recalling the sight that awaited me. “Elena was in the kitchen, pretending to be speaking to something in the dark. I couldn’t see what it was, but I felt it, like a presence pressing down on me, filling the room with that sickly sweet smell.” I glanced around the therapy room, the shadows flickering in the dim light. “Her skin... it moved. Rippling like water, peeling away. And her eyes, they glowed, bright yellow, like an animal’s caught in the night.”

The room was silent. Even the other patients seemed to be holding their breath. I took a shaky one myself, fighting the panic rising in my chest. “The kids crawled out of the shadows,” I continued, my voice barely more than a whisper now. “Their bones... bent the wrong way. Their mouths stretched open, pretending to smile; but it was too wide, too many teeth.” I clenched my eyes shut, hearing their hissing laughter echo in my skull.

“I had to stop them,” I said, my voice breaking. “I grabbed the knife... I had to. They weren’t my family anymore. They were monsters wearing their skin. They would’ve killed me. I was saving them. I was—”

“You were saving them,” the therapist interjected, her voice cold and detached. “From what?”

I looked at her, my heart pounding in my chest. “From whatever had replaced them,” I croaked. “You don’t believe me, do you? I’m not crazy” I asked, my eyes burning with fury and despair. “But you saw it too. The police found the marks on their bodies, marks that didn’t make sense. You read the reports.”

She said nothing, just stared at me, scribbling in her notebook. I glanced around the room, feeling my sanity slipping through my fingers. The lights flickered, and for a split second, I saw it: the therapist’s face blurred, her skin rippling like a disturbed pool of water. I blinked, and it was gone.

“You saw it too!” I screamed, leaping to my feet. The room erupted in chaos. Patients rocked in their chairs, some crying out, others curling into themselves. The orderlies burst through the door, rushing toward me. “I’m not crazy! They’re still out there!” I thrashed as they grabbed me, forcing my arms behind my back. “You have to believe me!”

As they dragged me out, I caught one last glimpse of the therapist. Her eyes glinted with a sickly yellow light, and she smiled, her lips stretching just a bit too far.

The door slammed shut behind me, leaving me in darkness. I knew they would never believe me.

Unlike them all, I’m not crazy.
