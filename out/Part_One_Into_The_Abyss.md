Part One: Into the Abyss

Have you ever traveled across space, time, and dimensions to battle an inter-dimensional demi god hell bound on eating the soul of the girl you love? Did you have to travel back to your dimension and live without her while staying in love with only her until you die? Well I have, let me tell you how it all happened.

….

On a cloudy afternoon in mid winter I was in a coffee shop madly clicking away at my laptop’s keyboard. The next chapter of my book was almost done, I had had a creative breakthrough recently and wanted to punch out as many chapters as I could while it lasted…. AND done! I smiled victoriously as I finished my third chapter for the week.

I put my laptop into my backpack and zip it up with a satisfied smile on my face, slung it around my back, and walked happily out of the little coffee shop in North Everett. Tonight I would smoke weed like a king, always good to reward yourself, right?

….

I walk into my little apartment, and happily sling my backpack onto the floor by my door. My cat Joe Bob Briggs, or Briggs for short, happily runs up to great me. I pick him up and cuddle him as I go about my routine. A while later when going to fetch my laptop, I opened up my backpack to find a book I had never seen before on top. The only word on the cover was the name ‘Kyra’. I open the book to find it’s a diary or journal of sorts.

“March 8th 2025The personal journal of Kyra to document the end of the world

No one is really sure where he came from, or can you call it a he? It looks male enough, it sounds male, but it wears no clothes and it’s skin is pure black like an empty abyss void of anything. It’s body void of any real human sexual anatomy, just leathery almost. His eyes are even blacker than an empty abyss, when. When you look into them you can feel the abyss entering your soul.

This is how he chooses who is next. He allows us to live in our houses, live normal enough lives (we are given small amounts of rations, barely enough to survive) we goto work in the mines, we come home, we worry and wait. He can teleport instantaneously and people say he can sense where every human is at any moment. He walks around, all day, across the entire world, pushing his abyss into others and finding what soul feels the tastiest next.

I’ve seen it happen five times, and unfortunately I fear I’ll have to see it many more before it’s my turn. He’s slowly consuming the world. Children don’t last long, he really seems to like them. And honestly his appetite only seems to grow with every soul he consumes.”

….

As I finish reading the last line I feel my feet being pulled out from under me. Time, space, and all senses lost meaning. Then as they returned I felt myself being stretched to the limit, if it didn’t end I knew I would be torn apart in all directions. And then as soon as it began it all ended, and I stood in front of a house in a broken neighborhood. There were no lights anywhere, every car looked abandoned and decrepit like they hadn’t run in years. The houses, while technically functional, seemed to fair little better than the cars. You could tell weather and time had taken there toll and there was no one doing upkeep.

After the shock wore off a bit I started to process my situation. I hadn’t even smoked weed yet, there was no way this was some drug induced psychosis. I don’t even bother to pinch myself, I straight out punch my face hard. Yep, definitely not sleeping.

What has happened here? Why did this world seem so broken. There was a feeling in the air like the heart and soul of the place was slowly dying. I could sense there was life, just some weird feeling, but it felt like the energy was literally being slowly drained out of it.

Then something new suddenly happened, something I never experienced before. It as like something opened up in me and I could sense everyone, and everything. I felt the pain of the world as I could feel it slowly dying. My heart broke as I filled with a dread, I’m not sure what’s going on but something really bad is happening here. Like, shit has hit fan in an armageddon like way.

And then I felt something new, something much worse than the pain and despair. Something so black not even Satan could compare. Whatever this thing was it hated life, not just hated, like beyond hate. I can’t even put words to it.

And then something in front of me appeared and I felt yet something else new. Like something reaching into me trying to take my soul. And I knew, I knew if it got it I would be gone, there’d be nothing left of me.

I felt it consuming me, I almost lose myself to it, but then again something else new. I felt…. A woman.  I felt loneliness, pain, despair, and worse of all no hope. And I filled with rage. I pushed back and now instead I felt myself inside of it. And it filled with my anger and compassion, and it hurt, it bleed inside, it couldn’t stand it. The righteous fury made it scream, and then it was gone. I could still feel it, it wasn’t dead. Not even close. And even worse I could tell it was mad, very mad. It’d be coming back for me.

And I filled with dread, I had been brought to… Another dimension maybe? I’m still not sure. And I’m not sure what’s going on with me, but I think I know why I was brought here. I have to fight this thing, and I don’t know if I can. And if I lose, there’ll be nothing left of me….

But then an even worse thought struck me, whoever that woman was I felt… If I lose it’ll get her eventually. I knew I couldn’t let that happen. So I open myself up to this connection, and I feel it. I calm the dread I feel filling me and block it out. Then I push out, I search through all the pain and despair searching for her.

And then something, it’s a small connection but I concentrate on it using all my power to block everyone else out. And then something connects and I turn what I’m pretty sure is south. I’m not ready for this, but time to begin.
