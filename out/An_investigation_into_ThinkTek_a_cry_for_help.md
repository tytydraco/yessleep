This may not be reality; I may be posting this to the abyss or not at all. Is this a cry for help or all part of a greater plan larger than I can comprehend. My mind is rattled...it has been undone. 

This world is built on secrets, and I was one of the few who made a living uncovering them. My name is irrelevant now, but for years I have been a private investigator, priding myself on discretion and efficiency. I have lived a secluded life, the connections I have made have been fleeting at best, it’s easy to be pessimistic and untrustworthy of people with what I have seen and uncovered in my time.  

Nothing could have prepared me for the nightmare I stumbled into at ThinkTek. As I try to piece together the fragments of my memory, I can't shake the feeling that some of what I remember might not be my own. 

ThinkTek stood as a fortress of innovation, its public face a beacon of hope for Alzheimer’s and Dementia patients. Commissioned by an anonymous employer, my mission was to delve into their brain imaging and altering technology. The deeper I dug, the more sinister the rumours became—whispers of mind control, secret experiments, and people who vanished without a trace. I knew I needed to get in, to truly uncover their secrets. 

My entry into ThinkTek was facilitated not by subterfuge, but an invitation under the guise of a journalist. An aspiring writer in the medical technology field ready to sing ThinkTek’s praises, of course this would be of interest to the shareholders.  

The facility was a shrine to ThinkTek’s triumphs, with portraits of beaming scientists and heartfelt accounts of miraculous recoveries. Yet, there was something off in the way the staff moved and interacted—an undercurrent of dread that intuition whispered to me. 

The hallways didn’t evoke a feeling of positivity or optimism from patients being treated, just a feeling that this was all a mere plastic facade ready to be torn down exposing the hidden truths. Staff continued to move in a hush hush manner, avoiding my gaze as I was shown around the sterile facility. 

In my research Dr. Emily Carter emerged as a person of interest—a neuroscientist celebrated for her breakthroughs, yet enshrouded in mystery. No backstory, no origin as if she appeared out of thin air. It took some digging, but I discovered she was deeply involved in classified projects. I knew I needed to talk to her, try and get her to reveal things not known. 

As I was being shown around the facility, I was introduced to a few of the scientists working on the many projects under ThinkTek’s umbrella. Amongst them Dr. Emily Carter. For such a decorated scientist she was very quiet and subdued. She was successfully avoiding my not-so-subtle gaze, and my attempts to grab her attention were proving futile. Pulling myself away from the obviously meticulously planned PR spiel of the numerous scientists, I walked towards Dr. Carter.  

Before I could get a word out her eyes darted to the corners of the room, pointing out the multitude of cameras following everyone's every move, it was clear that I wouldn’t be able to get any information out of her here. I extended a handshake and smiled; she reciprocated the action. With a bead of sweat appearing in her forehead she uttered the words “Hillside View” after which she turned and left. I was taken aback at first, caught off guard, confused.  

When I started to ponder on the words “Hillside View” I was reminded of a case of mine from many years ago of an insurance scam gone wrong, a hotel was burnt down with families stuck inside. The owner of the hotel couldn’t afford to keep the hotel in good condition, its floors warped and twisted, hallways in various states of disrepair. He burnt it down to get a new start, one that never came. 

All that is left of the Hillside View Hotel is a charred mass of wood and bricks, the doorway to the lobby still stands, almost in defiance of what the owner chose to do. 

What could Dr. Carter possibly of meant by this, was it linked to ThinkTek? Was it a warning? Could it possibly be an opportunity to meet? Hoping it was the latter I knew I needed to pay the Hillside View Hotel a visit. 

I pulled up to the hotel in my car, it appeared dark, a black mass imposing against the already night sky, I sat in my car wondering why I was here. How did Dr. Carter know this place was linked to me? How was she able to see through my journalist identity?  

Before I could comprehend what was happening a shrouded figure opened my cars back door, sat down and closed the door behind them. I didn’t dare look back, not wanting to catch a bullet to the head I waited, I waited for the figure to speak, to shed some light on my current situation. I waited. 

Looking in the rear view I caught a glimpse of their silhouette, appearing almost familiar but shrouded in darkness.  

"You don't know what you're getting into," she whispered, "You don't know how far this goes, you might not come back” a tremble in her voice. Extending out of the dark a hand appeared holding out a keycard and an address, it appeared glinting in the moonlight a gateway to the next chapter. I took the items and inspected them, before I could say anything the figure was gone fleeing into the night. I debated on what my next move should be, pondering my safety, however my drive to seek out the unknown forever pulls me deeper into the darkness. 

Following the address, it brought me to some woods on the outskirts of the city illuminated only by the glow of the night sky I gripped the steering wheel tightly, guiding my car deeper into the dense woods, not knowing what lied ahead. The trees loomed like sentinels, their gnarled branches intertwining above to form a claustrophobic canopy that blotted out what little light there was. The air grew heavier, and the forest seemed to swallow the gravel road, each turn leading me further from the world I knew. The address scribbled on a piece of paper sat on the passenger seat, a cryptic beacon, given to me by a shrouded figure outside a part of my career from many years ago. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was driving into a trap, the sinister atmosphere mirroring a dark chapter from my past. 

Years ago, I had navigated through a different kind of darkness I spiralled into a void where the days blurred together in a haze of grief and self-destruction. I repress the source of this pain to allow me to keep going, to allow me to uncover the treachery of the world as repentance for my previous lack of action. The suffocating forest now felt like an echo of those days, each tree a reminder of the walls I had built around myself. I feel now a familiar sense of dread, an abyss threatening to engulf me. The memories of sleepless nights and relentless self-reproach surged back with every mile, intertwining with the present danger. Yet, just as I clawed his way out of that personal hell, I knew I had to confront whatever lay ahead, hoping this journey into the shadows would bring me one step closer to salvation.  

As I emerged into the forest clearing, the sight before me was nothing short of surreal. In the midst of the dense, wild underbrush and towering trees, a solitary door stood erect, untouched by time or nature. The clearing itself was unnaturally circular, the surrounding trees bending away as if repelled by some unseen force emanating from the door. There were small walls either side, indication of a staircase being just beyond the door—its surface polished and pristine unnaturally so. 

The door's presence was profoundly eerie, a stark contrast to the raw, untamed forest. It stood as an anomaly, an element so out of place that it twisted the fabric of reality around it. A cold breeze whispered through the clearing, rustling leaves and carrying with it a faint, almost inaudible hum that set me on edge. The door's handle gleamed, seemingly inviting, yet menacing. I felt a chill creep up my spine, as if the very air around him held its breath, waiting for him to make a move, watching. Every instinct screamed at me to turn back, but an inexplicable pull drew me closer, compelling me to face whatever mystery lay beyond the uncanny threshold. 

Inside the door was a long, narrow staircase descending deep into the darkness, an unsettling invitation into ThinkTek’s inner sanctum. The contrast was jarring—one moment I was surrounded by the organic, chaotic life of the forest, and the next, I was staring into a passage that seemed to defy the natural order. 

The staircase was made of cold steel each step sharp and perfect, almost as if I was the first person to ever come across this place. Bright, shimmering lights lined the walls at precise intervals, casting ghostly shadows that danced in the periphery of my vision. The air that wafted up from below was damp and musty, carrying the scent of earth and something else—something metallic and unsettling. 

With each step I took, the walls seemed to close in tighter, the oppressive silence broken only by the echo of my footsteps. The narrowness of the staircase amplified my unease, making me feel as though I was descending into the bowels of the earth, towards an unseen presence, a malevolent force waiting at the end of my journey. Yet I continued downward, each step a reluctant but necessary advance into the unknown. 

Finally reaching the bottom of the stairwell, I was enveloped by a silence so profound it felt suffocating, each breath a struggle against the oppressive stillness. Turning back around to look up at the staircase I had just descended the world felt impossibly far away. In contrast to the staircase this room was not well lit, lit up only by the glow of the staircase. Shadows pressed in from all sides, thick and impenetrable, as if the darkness itself were alive, conspiring to swallow me whole. I moved forward cautiously, my footsteps echoing in the eerie void until I stumbled upon a gallery that sent a chill through my bones. 

Lining the walls were photographs of missing persons—faces frozen in time, eyes wide with terror and desperation. It was immediately clear that these were captives, not volunteers. The name “Project Mind’s Eye” was scrawled ominously across a large, decrepit sign hanging crookedly on the wall. My stomach churned as I realized the true horror of this place. Project Mind’s Eye was not merely for observation but for control. 

In the dim light, I could make out grotesque diagrams pinned to the walls, showing devices implanted in the subjects' skulls. These crude contraptions were designed to strip individuals of their autonomy, turning them into mere puppets for some sinister purpose. The cold, clinical nature of the setting clashed horribly with the reality of the human suffering it inflicted. My mind raced, the enormity of the revelation crashing over me like a wave. Each photograph, each diagram, each desperate face etched into my memory as I stood there, a lone witness to the depths of human depravity. 

As I documented this horror, the realization struck me: ThinkTek was expecting me. My every move had been orchestrated. They didn’t need to hunt me down; they knew where I was at every moment. The door was opened, not to pursuers, but to guide me and others potentially like me deeper into the dark. 

A symphony of mechanical hums filled the air, the source elusive yet omnipresent. I felt rooted to the spot, a silent observer to unseen horrors. A door creaked open at the end of the room, its ominous presence beckoning me to uncover what lay beyond. But as I stood there, staring into the gaping maw of further darkness, my usual controlled disposition faltered. The weight of the photographs and diagrams, the faces of the missing and tormented, pressed heavily on my psyche. Fear surged through me, raw and unrelenting, eroding my resolve. 

My instinct for self-preservation screamed louder than my curiosity. I could feel the icy tendrils of dread creeping up my spine, tightening their grip around my heart. With a shaky breath, I made the decision to retreat, each step backward a surrender to the overwhelming terror that had seized me. The suffocating silence, the oppressive shadows, and the horrific revelations of Project Mind’s Eye were too much to bear. As I turned away from the open door, I could only hope that retreating now would give me the strength to return and face this nightmare another day.  

My escape was a calculated retreat, not a desperate flight. For days, I didn’t leave my apartment trying to piece together what I had witnessed, what was their plan? How far had they spread? The feeling of being watched was an unshakeable companion. I couldn't shake the unease that had settled in my bones. The shadows outside seemed to thicken and become larger with every night that passed, taking on a life of their own. From my window, I noticed them lurking on the streets below, their indistinct forms blending seamlessly with the darkness. They stood still, their presence ominous and foreboding, as if they were waiting for the right moment to strike. 

I pulled the curtains, hoping to shut out the unnerving sight, but the sense of being watched persisted. Moving through my apartment, I could almost feel these shadowy figures within the complex itself. Lingering just beyond my door in the hallways, their vague silhouettes flickering in the dim light. Every creak and rustle seemed amplified, my senses on high alert as paranoia gnawed at me. The walls of my sanctuary felt increasingly thin, unable to keep out the creeping dread that these figures brought with them. It was clear that whatever dark forces I had encountered in the forest had followed me home, and there was no escaping their watchful eyes. These shadowy figures affirmed ThinkTek’s awareness of my investigation. 

The final confrontation was not violent, but a quiet breach of my sanctuary through the front door in the dead of night. In the pitch-black, there was a presence. Dr. Carter stood before me with a group of men quiet and with blank expressions 

"We are only trying to help," she pleaded, her voice a siren's call, beckoning for my compliance. “This is not down to us but to those that can’t be seen, just as I stretched out my hand to you to bring you in, they stretched out theirs to bring us in.” 

A laptop was presented to me the only file on it a video titled “Patient I.”  My fingers hesitated over the keyboard before double-clicking the icon. The footage, grainy and unfocused showed a woman strapped to a chair, electrodes attached to her head. The room was dimly lit but had a sense of familiarity to it, evoking a feeling I had a few nights before, had this been what lie beyond the door that I turned away from. 

The video played, revealing the womans face wide with terror, her body convulsing as she struggled against the restraints. 

Her screams echoed through the speakers, piercing and desperate. "Where am I!? Who are you!?,” Her pleas remained unanswered, a scientist stepped towards the centre of the room.  

“The time is 1900 hours on the 10th of March 2004, we are here with Patient I, Emily. Emily has struggled through the foster system due to her mental health. Emily has displayed signs of childhood dementia. She has trouble concentrating, understanding, learning and communicating. Frequent personality changes. Severely disturbed sleep and behavioural issues such as hyperactivity. She is the perfect test subject to test out our new treatment.” 

From this video it was clear ThinkTek was providing this treatment without proper permission or authority. Pursuing progress, no matter the cost. The video continues with the scientist explaining the procedure; 

“Our treatment seeks to implant a device into the patient's brain, we will be stimulating it after insertion with an electronic pulse provided by the electrodes around the patient's head. This will activate said device to act as a bridge between various sections of the brain, allowing information to be stored and transferred on demand. A second brain if you will. Dementia patients will no longer have to rely on the fragility of their own organic structures. The device will pick up every impulse sent through it.” 

“What do you want with me!?" The child screamed holding back tears, the chilling intensity of her voice sending shivers up my spine. I could see the raw fear etched into her features, her gaze darting around the room as if trying to escape the horrors of the reality she was in. 

A new figure stepped into the frame a much older man, his expression was one of cold, clinical detachment, a stark contrast to the girl's frantic terror. He glanced at the monitors, then at his team, his voice calm and commanding. "Initiate the sequence," he ordered. Not one person flinched or stalled for even a moment, beginning the sequence in synchronous harmony, like drones no sign of unease or uncertainty that they might not be right. 

The girl's screams intensified for a moment, then morphed into a monotonous drone, her eyes glazing over, she fell silent. Even from the video the silence in the room was palpable, it was as if time had stopped. Everyone waiting for the child to speak and show signs of life. 

"I’m not alone in here anymore am I... " Her voice, now void of emotion, repeated the haunting refrain like a broken record. The room around her seemed to pulse with a dark energy, the shadows on the grainy footage appearing to shift and writhe as if alive. 

The older man watched impassively, taking notes as the girl’s words grew increasingly disjointed, her mind fracturing under the relentless pressure. "They are in my head... they control me...they are telling me things...they want more," The camera zoomed in on her face, capturing every twitch and spasm, every flicker of madness that crossed her eyes. Her transformation from a terrified human to a hollow shell was recorded in excruciating detail. 

The video ended abruptly, the screen going black, leaving me in a silence that felt louder than the screams. My heart pounded in my chest, and a cold sweat clung to my skin. The shadows in my apartment seemed to stretch and lengthen, the memory of the girl’s tortured cries echoing in my mind. Who are they? What did she mean by "I’m not alone in here anymore am I... "? All these questions raced through my mind, I briefly forgot I was in my room surrounded by ThinkTek’s personnel. 

Then it clicked, the child...Emily. Dr. Carter watched as the realisation came to my face. Too stunned to speak Dr. Carter filled the air not with her quiet and frightened voice that she had presented previously but one similar to the cold and clinical nature of the older man in the video.  

“I wouldn’t be where I am today without ‘Them’, they made me who I am, you only need to let ‘Them’ in.” 

In that moment—be it clarity or madness—I grasped ThinkTek’s true horror: they had not merely unlocked minds; they had opened doors to realms unfathomable. And within those depths lurked unseen powers.  

I was left with the question of how much of Emily is truly left, is her body merely acting as a conduit for whatever ‘Them’ is or is she still in there, with no control of the wheel witnessing whatever horrors she has been made to watch in the last 20 years. 

“I was shown...I was told what to do, how to fix people, rid people of their pain, bring peoples loved ones back from the brink, can’t you see that? I know what happened to you, don’t you want rid of those memories? The pain?” Dr. Carter beckoned to me. 

The horror of ThinkTek’s true intentions began to hit me. The anonymous company that had hired me was ThinkTek itself. They sought out reclusive individuals like myself, those who had been through hardship, knowing no one would come looking when we vanished or changed beyond recognition. I was just a pawn in a game repeated many times before. ThinkTek slowly amassing an army of meat puppets. Do ThinkTek even know what they are doing or have the collectively lost control, being controlled by an invisible entity or entities.  

The shadows in my room began to get longer and darker, enveloping all that is around me. A sudden dizziness washed over me, and I stumbled backward, feeling as though the ground had shifted beneath my feet. 

When I regained my bearings, I found myself sitting alone in the very same dimly lit room from the tape, I was disoriented and afraid. The same metallic smell and hum was present from before, I knew there was no point screaming out for help, I was truly alone no one could possibly help me.  

I began to feel a tingling sensation in the back of my head. It was as if I could feel another presence in my mind—a sinister consciousness lurking just beyond the edges of my awareness. At first, it was just whispers—faint echoes that seemed to emanate from the depths of my own thoughts. But as I struggled to make sense of the situation, the whispers grew louder, more insistent, until they became a cacophony of voices, each one vying for control. I could feel them rifling through my memories, rewriting them, twisting them into something unrecognizable. 

Panic surged within me as I realized that I was no longer alone inside my own head. 

I tried to fight back, to assert my own will, but it was like trying to hold back a tidal wave with my bare hands. The presence in my mind was relentless, a puppeteer pulling at the strings of my consciousness with chilling precision. Every thought, every action was no longer my own—it was dictated by the unseen force that now held sway over me. 

I watched in horror as my body attempted to move of its own accord, like a marionette on strings, carrying out commands that I couldn't even comprehend. It was as if I were a prisoner in my own mind, forced to witness the unfolding nightmare from behind a veil of helplessness. 

And as the realization sank in that I was no longer in control, that I was nothing more than a vessel for this malevolent force, I knew that there was no escape. I was trapped, bound to this entity that now inhabited my mind, what was its goal? What was its purpose? Before I could work this out, I was thrust back into the darkness. 

Encased within the walls of my head, a space that seemed to close in with malevolent intent, an infinite darkness I was faced with the ultimate violation—not of home or privacy, but of self. In this new reality where consciousness could be commandeered, the terror lay in discerning what remained truly mine. 

Dr. Carter's voice, so cold and detached, echoed in my mind.  

“I was told what to do, how to fix people, rid people of their pain,”  

How many people are not who they seem, how many people have been changed. ThinkTek are creating conduits for something beyond our comprehension to peer through. No longer watching us but taking control.   

I awoke in my apartment, sat at my desk. I knew I had to expose them, to warn the world. But as I sat in my dimly lit study, paranoia wrapped around me like a vice. Every shadow seemed to hide a pair of watching eyes, every sound a whisper of something unseen. My own thoughts no longer felt like my own. 

In the end, it wasn’t the fear of what ThinkTek could do to my body that paralyzed me—it was the knowledge that they had already claimed my mind. The true horror of ThinkTek was not just in their experiments, but in the realization that I might never know which of my thoughts were truly mine, and which were theirs. 

Everything I see and do can be altered, changed, generated. For all I know I’m stuck inside my own mind prison, being placated by ‘Them’ by being allowed to write this out, never to be seen by a soul, only existing within the bounds of my head. As I type this, I feel myself further falling into paranoia and madness. I'm unsure if these are my words or theirs. Is this a warning, or a trap laid by ‘Them’? I share this not knowing if it’s a desperate attempt by what’s left of myself to reach out, or if it's ThinkTek using me to spread their influence further. 

To whoever reads this, beware. Some doors, once opened, can never be closed.
