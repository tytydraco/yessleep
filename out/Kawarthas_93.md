Picture it. Eastern Ontario, Summer of 1993. Eastern Ontarios Best Rock 91.5 The Owl's Canadian Summer rock playlist was in full swing.

"GIVE ME A HOOOOOOT!" 

Tragically Hips "Ahead by a Century" plays in the background as I ponder, and try to hype myself up for what should be a fun Canada day weekend at the family cottage with my best friends. More than best friends. I considered them family. 

I was a young man at the time. Not without trauma and unresolved grief though. 

My dad had passed shortly before Christmas and my Mum had not been dealing with it so well and turned to bottle to help her grieve.  Hell, I can't blame her. I did the same. 

After a long, cold, dreadful winter. The days got longer, and the nights shorter. 

But. The need to drink, and party my grief away had amped up to unhealthy levels.

So I planned a Canada Day Banger! July 1st Long Weekend. At the Cottage.... I thought of it as a way to help process my grief as I had great memories of my family and I when I was kid..(despite almost dying totalling a fellow cottagers ski-doo, and falling in the fire pit full glow) Those are stories for other days. 

*I will be changing the names the victims out of respect for the families*


I wanted to arrive a day before everyone so I could decompress a little, and clean up a bit before the real party showed up. 

After an uneventful 4hour drive out from the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) I made it. Once I was done unpacking and settling in. I got into the vodka, set up the old JVC to Eastern Ontarios Best Rock 91.5 The Owl

"GIVE ME A HOOOOOOT!"

Now another Canadian Classic was playing Gordon Lightfoots Sundown. One of my all times fav was playing and I thought it couldn't get much better than this... little did know

The... activity started around 11 when I was good and hammered. I should mentioned this earlier. The family cotty was situated in a valley on the Raven River. It's on private lane way with only 2 other cottages. The neighbors who lived up there had actually gone away to their kids for the weekend so it was extra quiet... and eerie. The lot is sort of on a peninsula. Riverfront and a little basin like gimmick and woods on the otherside of the property. This is important for later.



I had got bored and started a bonfire. It was located near the river. Technically at the back of the cottage. I heard some odd noises from behind where the basin and wooded area is at front of the cottage. At first it was just twigs snapping, dead leaves being brushed around. I just chalked it up to an Animal. We have everything from deer, yotes, porcupines, other miscellaneous rodents and even bears. Although I had never seen one before.

Then....IT appeared
