Hello, my name is Silas Williams. I am 19 years old, but at the time of the event, I wish to tell you: that I was 17. 

I live on my own and have a tight-knit group of friends who have helped me gain enough courage to share this story with you, maybe in a futile attempt to find others like me or let others know that no matter how bad it gets, things get better. This may seem all over the place so I’ll cut to the chase: I am one of seven sons. 

My brothers, from oldest to youngest are Brick (23 yrs), Thomas (18 yrs), Me (17 yrs), Archer (12 yrs), Ted & Cud (both five and identical twins), and Milo (4 yrs). Our family has a unique dynamic because of this. My Mom worked very strange jobs, I can’t quite remember what my Mom did but she traveled quite a lot and would often introduce us to business partners at the dinner table some nights. My Dad on the other hand worked as a U.S. Postal Service worker for a long time. He retired a year before our mother died so for a while she was the breadwinner.

This was the inception for the events to occur, our Mother died. Aside from introducing us to people we never knew or seen before. She was very strict, a no elbows on the table, backs straight, everyone must have a routine kind of mom. Our Dad, however, was not the same way. You can say he was more or less complicit in her behavior and never really stood up to her. He would always mockingly tell us how doing this has led him to a happy life with seven sons. Even now I think I’d rather eat nails than live subjugated to a crazy woman.

Then, she died. It came as a surprise to everyone. A complete and total shutdown of the body. She was healthy at 45, worked out consistently, and ate healthy foods. The doctor hardly gave us any worthwhile information other than that very rarely, this could happen to anyone, even a little kid like my brother Milo. My Dad was devastated, Brick was devastated, and that was about it. I can hardly say I like her, but Thomas hated her.

Dad asked us who wanted to come to the Funeral which would be about an eight-hour drive from our house to a secluded funeral home owned by a subsidiary of the company she worked for. Brick had to work, Thomas was a crash out, Archer had severe motion sickness and the younger boys were out of the question. So, I went, hoping for a fast service and an even faster ride home.

The service was a blur to me as I mostly occupied myself with my phone and steered clear of older people to avoid hearing “I knew you since you were a baby,” or “Your mother was a great woman.” My Dad oddly enough didn’t shed a tear. He wasn’t a waterhead by any means but I’ve seen him cry watching The Blind Side and Finding Nemo. I would mention the trip back home and what that was like but he hardly said anything to me. 

Getting home we received a warm welcome with Ted, Cud, and Milo rushing out to see us. They were jumping up and down happy to see Dad but their little minds just couldn’t comprehend what was happening. Our Dad had gotten out of the car and trudged through the kids to go inside. The kids were heartbroken but as soon as they saw me they had pounced on me instead. “Hey guys, just a heads up. Dad isn’t feeling too well, can you leave him alone for a while?” I said calmly. They nodded their heads and began screaming to me about this new game Archer had brought home and all the unique character names and superpowers I didn’t care to study at the time. 

Walking into our home, it is a three-bedroom two two-bathroom house where all the rooms except our parents were made into mini dormitories. I remember Brick being in the kitchen, Archer on the couch playing games, and the boys had just come in. My Dad immediately locked himself away in his bedroom. Brick shot me a quizzical look and asked “What the heck happened?” I sidled up beside him resting my weight on the freshly dirtied counter. “The funeral happened – hey guys can you play with Archer for a bit, I’m kinda tired.” The mewling boys sighed a collective ‘Aww’ then Archer belted from the couch “Dude come on, I’m tired of kicking their asses.” All Brick did was look at Archer and he sighed and let the kids have their chance. 

As I watched Brick sear more slabs of battered chicken onto the frying pan I spoke plainly, “The funeral was just as quiet as the car ride. Saw a bunch of people I didn’t know and Dad didn’t cry at all. The food wasn’t bad though.” Brick gave me a surprised look and before he could speak I interjected, “I know dude.” He just shook his head. 

When we all sat down to eat that night, Dad didn’t come to the table. We began to eat together and then Thomas came home. In all of his drunken stupor, a cigarette hanging loosely from his mouth and a thick sweat forming across his forehead. With a bottle of whiskey in his hand, he came screaming in through the back screen door, voice already hoarse from doing God knows what at the time. “DING DONG THE WICKED WITCH IS DEAD! No more of the horrible fucking woman.” He flopped down at the now silent table and Brick slid the food away from him and calmly pushed a water bottle towards him. “Wait what the hell? Why are you drinking water? Shouldn’t you be celebrating?” Thomas spoke. 

“Celebrating what? The death of the only other person making money in the house. Yeah, yippee! Now I get to take care of the house, as well as three children who get to grow up without a mother.” Brick said.

“Shit, if you ask me it sounds like you got exactly what you wanted.” 

“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”

“Where were you, Thomas?” I redirected.

“Psh, getting party favors. Fuck does it look like?” 

He slid his half-drunk whiskey bottle across the table to us. Archer outstretched a hand towards it and Brick slapped it away with a spatula. 

“Ow Brick! You’re not Mom so stop trying to be her!” Archer said.

“Fine, you know what, go ahead drink to your heart's content, see if I care. I’m eating in the room.” Brick stormed off with his plate to what was mine, Thomas', and his bedroom before slamming it closed. With the tyrant gone, Archer sipped a spoonful’s worth of whiskey before coughing and gagging. 

“So how was it man? Were other people celebrating too?” Thomas said to me.

“No. No one was celebrating, and on top of that Dad didn’t cry.”

“Whoa, what?”

“Yeah, he was quiet the whole time, and on the ride home.”

“Damn, what’s got him so upset?” Thomas asked sarcastically, looking to see if anyone would bite, but three-fifths of the table didn’t understand the joke and the rest of us didn’t find it funny.

“Tough crowd.” Thomas finishes.

The night we finished our food. Brick made Thomas wash the dishes who then paid Archer to do it for him. We had settled into our beds, doing our nightly routines before we all stirred to the sound of groaning. A barely audible rattle that turned into a muffled groan. The three of us in the room looked at each other, Thomas was too faded to understand what was going on but he was present at the very least. Once we opened our door, it turned from muffled to a full-on sobbing roar. The boys opened their doors soon after and Brick motioned for them to stay put. Looking back this was the first sign.

Our Dad was groaning, yelling, and possibly crying. It was hard to tell if his sobs were laughter or uncontrollable crying. With slurred words we could hear him bellowing with his broken voice “Nooo!! Nooo… I don’t… I can’t… I can’t do it… I don’t… I can’t… I CAN’T!” Brick and Thomas stood beside my father's bedroom door. Looking at each other we were trying to make sense of it and our lips trembled and stammered to think of something to say. “No!!! I can’t… AAGH! I don’t… I love them… But… I can’t…” At this point, we were more interested in hearing what he was saying as the concern turned into curiosity. 

“Should we say something?” Brick whispered.

“No way. Let the man get it out.” Thomas replied. 

We stood there longer, and the longer we stood there, our father’s grief became our own. I could see the tears welling in Brick’s eyes, how they transferred to Thomas and then to my own. I loved Dad, and even now I still do. After a point before we decided to lay down, his sounds grew one note. It was no longer sobs, but a guttural groan, almost like a rattle. It lasted for a long time and kept going. It only stopped when he hitched for breaths, then continued. Now was the time to intervene, my Brothers usually sent me in as the peacekeeper because I could ‘talk good,’ but outside my sobbing Dad’s door I couldn’t think of what to say, and before I could, my youngest brother Milo had his head pressed against the door and with the most sincere voice he could muster he said, “Daddy? Daddy, what’s wrong?” 

Brick tried to pull him away and as his hand tugged on him our Dad spoke through the door. 

“Milo… hey buddy…” Dad.

“Daddy… why are you crying?” 

“Your Dad is in pain Milo.”

“Are you hurted?”

“Yes, Milo… inside. It hurts all over.”

“Do you want chocolate milk? When I’m sad I get chocolate milk.”

“No buddy… I’ll be okay… I love you so much. I’m so sorry. Please, you’ve got school tomorrow.”

Milo whispered a soft ‘I love you,’ and just like that the noise was over. Sadly enough, after our morning routine the next day, that was the last time I’d see Milo alive again.
