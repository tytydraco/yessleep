It was a regular day outside, I got home from college for the semester. My family were hosting a Christmas party and our family members were coming over. I am always happy when I see my grandparents, the joy they gave us when we were kids. I live in a town where nothing really happens often. We have had 3 us presidents visit my town. But that was really it, I called my grandparents having them excited to see me again. 

This was supposed to be a big day for the family. My grandma took care of me alot when My dad was on his business trips. My mom well she was in and out of jobs. My parents had there fights, So I lives with my grandparents for a couple years. My parents went through therapy and they have gotten along alot better ever since. When I woke up this morning. I made myself some breakfast and My mom asked me to grab a few things from the grocery store, of course I said I would. 

She gave me a couple coupons and I was on my way. While I was driving to go to the grocery store. I heard on the radio there was a unusual weather storm heading to my area. The weatherman couldn’t point out what it was going to be exactly. He said it was something he has never seen through the radar…. I parked my car from the grocery store, I saw the clouds getting darker but that is usual it’s midwestern winter season so I didn’t think anything of it. While I was at the grocery store there was a loud siren sounding off. It was weird enough but it went away, I got my groceries my mom told me to get. While I was at the check out I asked the cashier what she had thought about That siren. 

She didn’t know what I was talking about…. She was weirded out what I told her. When I got outside…. I heard it again, then The earth was shaking like an earthquake and everything went pitch black. It was dark out. No lights,cars,sun or anything. My phone wasn’t turning on. But then I see something out of the sky it was like green I cant describe it, it was floating in the air then stayed there then it exploded. My phone came back on and the lights did too The  sun came back. It was unexplainable, I drove back home I told my parents what I saw then. They said there power went out for a bit. We heard a knock on the door. It was grandma and grandpa  they brought some friends I have never seen before I gave my grandma a hug along with my grandpa of course. I was taking them to the living room then I noticed.

There eyes were yellow it was hard to say what was wrong with them.  I asked why there eyes were yellow. They said “at this day and age our eyes are old as well.” My parents greeted my grandparents but I had a weird feeling I do not know what it was. So While my mom was cooking our turkey we were preparing for the family. My grandma asked me “how is ur wife doing?” I don’t have a wife. My girlfriend and I broke up a few months ago but I never took the relationship to the next level. I figured something wasn’t right but I was thinking it was dementia. 

My grandma got diagnosed with it 2 years ago. I said to my grandpa “thank you for the 50 dollars u gave me on my birthday” they said no problem. My grandpa to my knowledge doesn’t have dementia.  They never gave me money, they never have. I asked about there neighbor Ron and his wife how they were doing. They responded “he was getting ready for the holidays.” They have no neighbors, they live in a very rural part of the state. I was convinced still my grandparents dementia explains this.

But why yellow eyes? Who are there friends? My grandma texted me… “were on our way” I texted back “ur here tho” they called me and my jaw dropped. Then It went black… who the hell were these people???
   
Thats when I knew it wasn’t them… The way there eyes were. They didn’t know what they gave me for my birthday. The phone call… I showed the texts to My dad i had him convinced.I told him lets get the beer downstairs. I noticed one of them were missing. While we were walking through the kitchen and to the basement I whispered (get the gun). I stayed at the door there is no lock door for the basement. 

The door was being attempted open. I fought the door and I hit them w the door. I did a peak through the peephole to see my grandma’s friend on the ground. I was panicked at first but This confirmed my suspicions. The blood isn’t human…. My dad got the gun I took it out of his hands and ran to the living room where my mom was with the creatures who were pretending to be my grandparents. I pointed my gun at the creatures pretending to be my grandparents. I said “YOU’RE NOT MY GRANDPARENTS.” My mom screamed at me to put the gun down. They made a Big Screech and chomped on my own mother…. I blasted my rifle to the creature’s skull killing it then. 

The 3 others jumped on my dad, killing him and one jumped on me but i hit it with a vase. It let me go I grabbed the gun and shot it dead. I then tried to rescue my dad but he was already dead. My dad….. dead They make a  big screech They just ate my own dad. They Charged at me, while I was reloading my gun. I dropped the bullet on the ground and the creatures were charging me. I went to the bathroom with my ammunition to reload. They BROKE down my door, But I reloaded in time to fire 2 rounds at the remainder creatures. 

I ran to the front door, grabbed my keys and Drove off. I tried to call the Police but the phone line was down… I was in tears, my own parents are dead…. The roads are blockedIt was dark, but Yellow eyes everywhere…. Chasing my car. I booked it through the highway getting out of the state and I went to my border state. Where nothing effected them yet. I went to a diner to get a coffee to get my mind off of this. As I am writing this, they said a weird earth quake happened which shutoff all the power. Its inevitable no matter where you go. 

I might need to get out of this diner, a customer walked in with those same yellow eyes with a few other cars pulling up. If anyone who is seeing this, hide…. Arm yourselves with weapons and find a shelter before you end up being eaten by those creatures….
