Hello all,

Thank you for your comments and questions. I’ve just finished another shift, and I’m typing this on the side of the road a few kms from the house. I'll answer your questions before getting into whatever the fuck happened last night. As far as I know, Elijah is under the guardianship of the state, so for a reason I don’t know, his parents aren’t in the picture. As for why he is in such a rural place, the business I work for owns some nice natural properties for respite and care of children with disabilities; it's nice and quiet for them and there’s plenty to explore, as well as a specialized school being relatively nearby. The property Elijah stays on is the most remote and he has been a resident for years. Other kids come and go for short stays, but he remains. 

As for the high security, some kids are runners and when upset will just take off; some kids are wanderers and will not pay attention to where they are going, hence the fences and childsafe keypads. Cameras are for basic security. My bosses are aware we are pretty isolated; I swear they just use them to see if I'm late or not.

Now for last night…

I approached the house, red dirt and stone crunching under my tires as my car inched forwards. This house for the last few months had been a sanctuary; Elijah was well behaved, and I enjoyed my time here. Seeing it again last night, I didn’t know if it had become unfamiliar or if I never really knew the place. As I typed in the melodic combination on the keypad, I heard Elijah's heavy footfalls, and by the time I opened the door, he already stood there.

“Hello, Mr. Elijah,” I said.

“Hello, Mr. Elijah,” he sang.

He smiled as he dutifully hopped onto my feet and hugged me while we waddled into the kitchen. As the door electronically locked behind me, I swore I heard the bolt click close twice.

“Hello, Julie” I called loudly.

“Hello, Matt!” she said with a smile. We had waddled too far; she was in the lounge. With a dramatic spin that made Elijah giggle, we turned around and headed in. Julie gave me a handover, and we talked about her dinner the night before along with the usual small talk before she headed off. Elijah was writing the alphabet with each of the letters backwards on the blackboard while we chatted. Elijah and I made models of various vehicles he liked with Play Doh together for an hour before I caught him nodding off. I ushered him to bed, and he hopped in and gave me a hug goodnight.

As I closed the door, I swore I heard the electronic bolt whir close again on the front door. I went to check if it was jammed or couldn’t fully close, but the door was locked just like I left it. I cleaned up for a bit before checking the job list and realizing it was bin night. Reluctantly, I went outside, grabbed both bins, which had been generously decorated by some child or another at some point, and started the long walk up the driveway to the road you pull in from. It was dark by this point; some pink still hung in the western horizon, refusing to let the day die. I rumbled up the dirt road; my pace appeared relaxed, but I was walking faster than usual. I used the fob from inside to open the outer gate and put the bins on the side of the road.

After they were placed correctly, I walked a small distance back before admiring the fading sky and a flock of birds silhouetting in front of it. I was captured by the beauty of the area when I heard the electronic whir of the bolt closing. Not from the direction of the house—not that I would be able to hear that anyway—but from 10 or so meters behind me in the tree line.

I froze. Icy adrenaline shot through me. I remained perfectly still for what felt like minutes, though it was likely only seconds. The whole time, I was scanning the trees, looking for anything that could’ve made that noise. Nothing. It was a breezy night, and the layers of bushes and trees swaying made it hard to pick out. Then I saw… a bin.

Identical to the recycling bin I just took out; it had the same yellow lid, same faded unicorn stickers on it. I could just pick it out as it was the only thing not swaying. Its handles were facing me as if it was ready to be taken out. I looked at the bins on the road; both were still there. Yet here a duplicate stood, although it did look a bit small.

“Hmm yeah, fuck no,” I said to myself, and the bin, I guess. I backed towards the house, watching that spot before jogging the final distance once far away. I entered, making sure to use the extra deadbolt. I checked on Elijah; he was snuggled up in bed the way I left him, and I turned off every light, checked every lock, and eventually sat down in my room. I was uneasy but mostly confused; I doubted I’d be getting much sleep. As I lay down and attempted to rest, I thought I heard a voice. I sat up. Again, a woman's voice, a familiar voice. I stood up and headed towards the window.

“Hello, Matt!” Julie's voice called, muffled by distance and the window.

It sounded exactly like she did earlier that day, every inflection and emotion, but I knew that it wasn’t her, couldn’t be her.

“Hello, Matt!” Julie's voice rang, no closer but definitely louder. I scanned for the source, then I saw it: a tall dark shape receding into the bush. Only for a moment, I couldn’t make much out, but it was not a tree.

It's safe to say I didn’t sleep very much. I checked on Elijah often and scanned the window when I was feeling brave enough, but no more horrors visited me.

Exhausted, I got Elijah ready for school and got out of there. Now here I am.

Once again, nothing was visible on the cameras. I saw a bin and heard my friendly coworker hiding in a bush in the dark around 9 PM. How can I tell my bosses? I have a shift tomorrow night before a break on the weekend. If anyone knows what this could be or point me in the right direction, let me know. I am not a superstitious man, so either I’m going crazy or something very real and wrong is happening. I don’t want to go back, but I need to protect Elijah. I care too much to abandon him.
