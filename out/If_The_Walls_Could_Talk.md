I’m really in no place to wax dramatic. I’m huddled as close to a space heater as possible without catching my eyebrows on fire, wrapped in three blankets. I’ve got a shivering purse dog clutched to my chest and the tears on my face have long since lost their warmth. But bear with me here. It’s the easiest way to put you in my shoes.

Picture your childhood bedroom, somewhere familiar. You’re laying there in the dark, and something is in your closet. The door cracks open just far enough for you to see a pair of enormous red eyes and for a pair of claws to grip the door. Naturally, you’re gonna scream for your parents, and eventually, they’re going to sleepily make it down the hall to you. They banish the monster simply by being there, pulling the closet door open and pointing at the clothes and toys and normal things. “See?” They say. “There’s no such thing as monsters.”

Now, I want you to picture instead that you’re in the closet. You’re not on neutral ground anymore; this is the monster’s domain. The door won’t open, and you can hear the heavy breaths of the beast— feel the drip of its saliva on your face. You can bang on the door, or scream, or do any number of things to escape or call for help, to struggle in the trap, but you’re nothing here. It’s only a matter of when. 

I can’t say I didn’t deserve this. I tried to tell myself that I was a good squatter. That I tried to protect her, and the house when it came down to it. But I was still an intruder, and I guess this is my karma. 

Before anyone makes any assumptions about the kind of person I am, I don’t crawl into people’s walls for sick kicks. But this dusty, creaky space between wooden beams is the only stable shelter I’ve known in years. For the record, I didn’t choose to be this desperate. I’m not on any hard drugs. Alcohol makes me violently ill. And before the things that happened in this house, I was decently sure I was of sound mind. 

My parents would tell you a different story. They’d tell you how they caught their boy Hunter, eldest son and hardest worker on their family farm, kissing another farmhand behind the grain silo. Long story short, I packed a bag at gunpoint, and then we were both forced away, to the tune of my sobbing mother and my angry father. I don’t know where that boy is now, and it doesn't matter much, but I hope he’s doing alright. 

I was only sixteen then, and  I was fucking terrified. I made my way up from the rural wasteland over the course of a few days, ending in Atlanta. I didn’t stay there long— a few months, at most.  All I can say is, I hold no blame for the people who turn to substances to cope with life on the streets. And that I would’ve rather died than stay there, starving and sleeping in the gutter. So, I snuck on a Greyhound, resolving to go wherever it took me. 

I traced a red line from the Southeast to the Midwest, moving on by whatever way was available. I walked, for the most part. Sometimes I hitchhiked, and sometimes I could bribe my way into a bus fare or once, even a train ride. I slept where my body dropped: beside a highway, under a tree, at the edge of a truck stop parking lot, in a cave, and the occasional abandoned shack. I did my best to mind my own business, and not take advantage of anyone who hadn’t offered help in the first place. But you can only be woken up by fire ant bites or fight a coyote for a discarded sandwich so many times. 

So, slowly, I taught myself how to pick locks. I learned how to squeeze all six feet of me through tight spaces and breathe without making a sound. As a rule. I never touched houses. I’d nestle myself deep into a hay bale in some farmer’s barn, or take up two-days’ residence in the end room of a motel. I never meant for this to happen— for people to get hurt. You gotta believe me when I say that. 

Georgia could get pretty nasty in the winter, but the cold of Nebraska was brutal and unexpected. I should’ve been better prepared; I should’ve known what kind of storm I was walking into. But, after two long years on the road, that was the first winter I ever saw snow. It wasn’t so bad that first time— watching it fall in flakes from the booth of a McDonald’s in Omaha. I stared in in awe, steam from the coffee I’d spent my last five bucks on warming my face. The sight of it brought back something I thought I’d lost.

The wonder didn’t stick around long, though. As I headed further toward the panhandle, the weather turned hostile. My jacket and hat were all but frozen onto me, and I’d tied my only spare shirt around my mouth and nose. I had no gloves, or anything to wrap my hands with, and it was becoming a huge problem.

The wind was the worst, whipping over my exposed skin like shards of glass, and out here, there was no shelter from it. In fact, there wasn’t much shelter anywhere. Along the empty fields and highways, I was lucky to find anything to shield me from the wind and snow for a minute, let alone somewhere to stay the night. More and more, I was sleeping on the icy ground and waking up to my teeth chattering.

I don’t remember where exactly I was when my hands stopped working. I think I’d been trying to pick the lock of a power station shed, but I couldn’t flex my fingers. They were red and raw, turning white at the edges. As I looked them over, a black cloud rolled over me, and my soul sank to my feet. I was doomed.

Things get blurry after that. To add insult to injury, a blizzard moved in, leaving me lost in a whiteout. My body began to shut down, and the cold left me too confused to realize it. I just knew something was horribly wrong.

I called out to anyone who would listen, to my mom, to my dad, to my siblings. All that answered back was the howl of the storm. Desperately, I staggered on through the piling snow, and I began to hear a pair of footsteps behind me. They weren’t… right. Disjointed, but fast. Bipedal. I’d seen a fox walk on two legs before, its eyes crossed with madness. This was a little like that, but more intelligent. Purposeful. It was getting faster, and I was getting slower. 

Adrenaline warmed my frozen limbs and I started to run. Branches thrashed into my clothes and skin, shedding their icicles as I fled for my life. I worried I’d somehow wandered into a forest— nowhere I would find help. A shadow fell over me, the deep glow of red eyes, and a scream finally tore out of my chest, lost on the wind. I threw off my jacket and put all the strength I had left into keeping my momentum. 

Then, like the North Star, a light broke the darkness. Shining out into the swirling snow was a flickering porch lamp, half hidden by the side of the large house it belonged to. I had no time to consider my options. I just ran toward it. 

I slammed my useless hands against the front door… once… twice… no answer. In a last ditch effort, I fumbled with the handle, only to discover it was unlocked. The footsteps had devolved into a slow, almost confused rhythm, and I knew this was my only chance. 

I threw open the door and it rattled as I shut it. I cringed and waited for some angry homeowner with a gun to come rushing down the stairs, or a little girl to scream that there was a strange man in her house. Even in my terror, I knew I’d crossed a line. But nothing disturbed the quiet.

I turned and looked out the frosty window set into the now-locked door. No footprints, or sign of any monsters, just ice and snow tossing and turning in the relentless wind. The longer I stood in the warmth, the more the memory fell apart. Had I ever fully seen what was chasing me? Or was it just a trick Old Man Winter was playing?

When I faced into the house again, I was met with another beast entirely. Standing on the patterned rug in the living room and facing me down like the leader of a wolfpack was a tiny dog. She was one or other of those fluffy kinds rich people have, and the growl coming off her told me I was two seconds from having my throat ripped out by her crooked teeth. 

“Come on now, pup,” I tried, “I don’t mean any harm. I just want to warm up, and then I’ll go.”

The furry little thing actually squinted at me. I crouched down and offered out my hand. She stared at it for a good minute before toddling over and giving it a sniff. Her tail started to wag, and I guess I passed whatever test this was. This close, I noticed her collar.

“Tuesday. What a silly name for a dog.”

Recognizing her name, she did a dumb little twirl and fell back on her behind. I decided I liked Tuesday. 

Instinctively, I left my wet and worn boots by the door as I walked into the living room. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d been in an actual house. Apparently, I’d also forgotten today was Christmas. During the time I could keep my phone charged, the days meant less and less to me as they went by with no changes. In the back of my mind somewhere, I knew it was December 25th. But that had become only another day of struggle.

The glow of a dying fire and a blinking Christmas tree cast shadows on the floral wallpaper. Tuesday stood sentinel by it, just in case she had been wrong about me and I tried to rob her owner. I sat down by the fire and, after some internal debate, added a log. The flames flared, glittering off the wrapped boxes laid under the tree. The small amount told me there probably weren’t any kids in the house. Not only that, but most of them were addressed to one person: May. 

I huddled by the fire and said a silent apology to her as the cold in my body melted away. Pain replaced it; my fingers began to crack and bleed, along with my chapped lips. When I finally stopped shivering, I sifted through my bag and found my first aid stash gone. Instead of leaving blood all over this stranger’s house, I hurried into the kitchen to rinse my hands. My weight shifted the hardwood boards beneath me, and as I drank from the faucet, I wondered why my being here hadn’t drawn any more attention than the dog’s. 

The cozy, grandmotherly loneliness of the house gave me the horrible idea that I would go upstairs and find the fresh body of some sweet old lady. In search of answers and something to wrap my stinging hands in, I climbed the stairs, Tuesday following behind. 

The upper floor was small, and filled with photographs. Generations were played out on the walls, and it reminded me just how little I belonged in this picture. There were two doors in the loft, and one was left ajar. Holding my breath, I glanced in through the crack, and almost let it out in relief. I hadn’t stumbled upon a body, but a middle-aged blonde woman sleeping soundly in her bed. Tuesday squirmed between my legs and into the bedroom, laying down at the foot of it. The blankets were pulled to her chin, and she’d fallen asleep with a pair of round-rimmed glasses sitting crooked on her nose. I assumed this was May, and I moved on. Must be a heavy sleeper, I thought to myself. 

I tried the other door, which thankfully turned out to be a bathroom. After a search of the medicine cabinet, I cleaned up my hands and lips, and looked at myself in the mirror. I couldn’t stand it for very long; I didn’t recognize the thin, weathered face that stared back at me. 

Now that my shuffling footsteps had stopped, the faint noises of the house took their place. A heater hummed somewhere in the walls. Water ran idly through the pipes above and below me. The bones of the house settled against the storm outside. Drifting in from the bedroom, where a clock radio sat on May’s nightstand, was the chorus of California Dreamin’. My chest ached at the thought of being somewhere safe and warm.

I slipped out of the bathroom, and went back down the stairs. The living room was just the same as I’d left it.

I should’ve taken a coat, maybe a little bit of food, and gone. But the fear of whatever had driven me here wouldn’t fully leave, overshadowed by the despair of returning to the cold I’d crawled out of. Worse than both, was the years of exhaustion hitting me all at once. Every step was beginning to feel like pushing a boulder. 

Instead, I lingered by the last of the fire, telling myself “just a little bit longer…” My eyelids grew heavy, my mind wandered, and just as I was about to sit down on the green, plush couch, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. As I looked around, wide awake now, I realized that weak morning sunlight was spilling through the windows. In a split second decision that I will regret for the rest of my life, instead of running out the door, I snatched my boots and dove into the closet at the back of the room. 

“Merry Christmas, Tuesday!”

My unwitting roommate emerged into the living room, carrying her dog and sitting down by the Christmas tree. I knew she would probably spend most of that day here. I was trapped. 

The closet was dark and full of thick blankets and quilts. As I buried myself beneath them, I knew deep down that I didn’t stand a chance at keeping myself awake long enough to find an opportunity to leave. I’d barely strung together another mental apology before falling into a deep, dreamless sleep. 

I woke up with a start, like someone had shaken me awake— a phantom of all the nights spent on benches. The smell of Christmas dinner filled my nose, and I prayed that my stomach stayed quiet. I tried to focus on the muffled voices beyond, and it wasn’t a moment too soon.

“I’m going to make up the couch for you guys while dinner finishes, I think I’ve got some spare blankets and sheets in the coat closet.”

I tried to tell myself that she could’ve been talking about any closet. But when I looked up and saw the woolen coats just barely brushing the top of my head, I began to panic. Red and blue lights and handcuffs flashed through my mind, and suddenly I was moving. 

I wedged myself between the wall and the miscellaneous boxes stuffed into the corner. At first, I hoped to just narrowly avoid being seen, like a demon antagonist, folded unnaturally into the corner. But as I froze, the smell of cooking food overwhelmed me again. I could almost see the spread of cooked meats and vegetables, of bread and butter and Christmas cookies, like I was looking through a lit match. It reminded me of home, of the good times. 

As footsteps approached and the door swung open, my hunger betrayed me, and I squeezed my eyes shut as the sound of my stomach growling echoed out into the living room.

“What was that?” May said, with confusion and mild alarm. I held my breath and pressed myself against the ceiling, and that’s when I felt something uneven in the plaster above me. May began to sift through the blankets below. She must’ve not heard exactly where the sound came from, and it gave me just enough time to notice the panel in the top of the closet.

I slid it open, all my stealth put to the ultimate test. I wanted to scramble through, to throw myself into whatever hidden crevice would get me out of this mess, but instead, I forced myself to move slower than I ever had. Once there was a wide enough gap, I raised myself, boots and all, into the crawlspace above. She didn’t even look up.

“I must be losing it,” I heard her say finally, and she gathered up a few blankets and shut the closet door. I’d escaped, and even though I’d narrowly avoided being caught, I still didn’t feel much better. 

Letting out the breath I’d been desperately holding, I pulled out my dying phone and lit the flashlight. I had to slouch against the slope of the ceiling, and I stifled a cough from the dust. The pseudo-room had some electrical panels, and the HVAC; not really a place anyone had any reason to check that often. It was cold, but sheltered from the wind and snow outside still, and I’d made it up with a quilt still wrapped around my shoulders. Three walls met, not much bigger than a coffin, but there was a gap at the fourth, just short enough to barely reach and wide enough to squeeze through if I tried hard enough.

Digging my nails into old wood, I slid through the crack and spilled out into a much larger room. Piles of boxes and forgotten furniture, along with another hatch in the floor, told me this was an attic. Out of the way, far enough removed from the house, and with plenty of places to hide if the need arose; I already knew I was going to be here for a while.

I didn’t want to leave those first few days. I lived off half a water bottle shoved into my pocket and long-expired sewing tin cookies. Almost a week had gone by before I’d run out of alternatives. I had to leave and go back into the house. Unconsciously, I noticed the pattern of when the car outside would leave, and when it would come back. I knew when May would go, and about how much time I had. I just had to work up the nerve.

That first time I dropped down from the closet was terrifying. I half-expected the door to crash open, and for someone to point and scream “AHA!” But the house was silent, save for the sound I soon discovered to be Tuesday gnawing a bone twice her size. I slipped by her and went straight for the kitchen, raiding a small amount of food and water before hightailing it back to the attic. 

That became my routine for a few weeks. As I got used to the new environment, and a slightly more stable place to stay, I started exploring the thin spaces between the inner walls. It was an old house; that much was clear. I could move through most of the inside without leaving it. It was lonely, though, with nothing but dust, fiberglass, and the odd mouse corpse or two. 

Eventually, it all got to me— the dust and dirt, the darkness, and constantly having a wall at my front and at my back, save for the time I risked sleeping in the attic.

I left the closet much earlier one morning, just after May had gone to work. I just meant to walk around a little longer than usual and stretch my legs, but when I made it upstairs, I found myself glancing into the ajar bathroom. It smelled so nice, and steam still clung to the edges of the mirror. I was moving before I had any time to consider it. 

I’d closed my eyes for a moment, after watching the shower water turn dark beneath me for a while, and that’s when I heard it. The skin-crawling sound of nails against glass. There was a small window set into the wall just above the shower, and when I opened my eyes, faint lines ran along the length of the glass, so shallow they almost didn’t look real. 

And maybe they weren’t. But the fear creeping up my spine, turning the scalding water to ice and my legs to stone, was. Something was watching me, and the animal sense deep down in me, the one I’d had to nurture to survive this far, knew it. 

I should’ve run right then, but I couldn’t. I didn’t. Instead, as the feeling slowly passed, and I could breathe again, I finished cleaning up and retreated from the bathroom on eggshells.

In the heart of the house, I felt a little safer. When I passed the laundry room, I took the opportunity to wash my clothes. Tuesday planted herself in the doorway and waited with me, studying me with innocent curiosity. The fluffy face of my companion sapped the unease right out of me, making everything feel just a little bit better. Dogs usually do.

Once the washer and dryer had both cycled, and I’d taken a small amount of food from the kitchen, I stood in the living room for a little while, trying to will myself to make the climb back into cramped darkness. 

Tuesday stood beside me, looking up like an expectant child. I reached down and gave her a scratch behind the ears. 

**BANG**. 

The sound startled me into standing. As I was trying to figure out what it was and where it came from, it repeated. Hard, against the front door. There was a figure there, hard to make out through frosted glass. Tuesday began to growl.

It came again, a fist against the door, and I took a step back. That was all the go-ahead it needed; a flurry of forceful pounding made the door rattle in its frame. I dove for the closet and desperately pulled myself back up to safety, hoping I hadn’t left that poor little dog to die. I waited anxiously until May's car returned in the early evening. I heard her comforting her spooked dog through the vents, and breathed a sigh of relief. 

Those vents became a lifeline for me after that. The snippets of conversation and general sounds of life were my only source of information and my sole entertainment. She mostly talked to Tuesday, though she’d get the occasional phone call or visitor. I learned a lot about her in the weeks and months to come. 

“I think I’m going to bake heart-shaped brownies for the class this year. What do you think, Tues?” She was a school teacher. Elementary, to be specific.

“And when I bring Bigfoot to your doorstep someday, I’ll be the one laughing at you!” She believed in most things: aliens, monsters, demons, ghosts. She held a special place in her heart for Bigfoot. Also for her sister. 

“You really should come visit over spring. The house gets really quiet without you here.” She lived here alone, for the most part. This house went back to her great grandfolk, and even though it was states away from the rest of her family, she made a point to move in when she inherited it. 

After long enough for the anxiety to wear off, I pulled my ear away from the walls and away from the vents and began to venture back out of the crawlspace. I learned the layout of the house inside as well as I knew the spaces between. I could stay out for days at a time, wedging myself into cracks, slipping into closets, and standing silent in the shadows.

I know what words come to mind. Monster. Creeper. Parasite. Trust me, I thought them about myself plenty. But even as the weather warmed, the idea of going back to sleeping under bushes was unbearable. 

So, I did all I could to be a manageable uninvited houseguest. I took and used the bare minimum of what I needed to survive. I did my best to respect her privacy. I even did her dishes a couple times. 

But as time went on, she began to notice. I almost wish she had been openly suspicious, instead of the alternative.

“I think she’s with me,” I heard her say to her visiting sister, “I feel a presence here, especially at night. Footsteps wake me up at odd hours. Sometimes I think I hear whispers. Even Tuesday has noticed it, but she doesn’t seem scared.”

“And you really think it’s Mom?”

She paused. My stomach clenched.

“I do. I think she’s proud of me for being here. For sticking it out, even when it’s been rough. God, I’d give anything to see her again.”

With that, I retreated into the attic, wishing I could crawl out of my own skin. Wishing even more that somehow, impossibly, I could be the spirit she was looking for. A loving mother, sitting at the table with a cup of tea for the lonely woman who couldn’t sleep. Instead, I was just a stowaway. 

Motivated by guilt rather than fear this time, I stayed in the attic for weeks, burning through the small stockpile of supplies I had. Warm weather turned hotter, and the air grew stuffy and doubly harder to breathe in. Summer snuck up on the both of us.

I distinctly remember it was the Fourth of July when things took a turn for the worse. I could hear the nonstop fireworks all around, and that was the night I decided I would leave. With her few months off, May didn’t leave the house much, but she had a doctor’s appointment the next day. I’d be gone by the afternoon, and she’d never have to know the truth. 

I’d almost fallen asleep, tossing and turning in the persistent heat. Then, all of a sudden, a rush of cool air soothed my sweaty skin. I almost surrendered to it and let the new comfort pull me into sleep. I don’t think I’d be writing this if I had. But, despite the exhaustion, I fought it away. Something wasn’t right. That’s when the sniffing started. That’s when I heard the gnawing.

Moonlight spilled in as shingles crumbled and wood was pulled away. Confused at first, I walked toward the source of the noise, and narrowly avoided losing my leg to whatever was clawing into the hole. Stumbling back, I watched the small view outside fill with dark fur, and a single, glowing eye. The sniffing turned to scratching. The gnawing grew savage. In the time it took me to reach the middle of the room, the hole opened wide enough for the thing to poke its head through. Teeth the size of railroad ties clicked together in my direction as those red eyes rolled around in their sockets. Its ears laid flat back against the side of its long face, and a low growl replaced the squeak I’d grown accustomed to hearing every once in a while living here. 

I watched, paralyzed, as the rat’s head gave way to the shoulders and arms of a man as it wriggled its way into the attic. Massive as it was, it moved almost silently. Sharp nails curled on the ends of dirty human feet, half of a chewed-on tail hanging behind them. It closed the distance between us as I backed against the far wall.

Gaunt and doubled over on itself, it came eye-to-eye with me. When our gazes met, I could hear it. The growls suddenly had horrible meaning; they made words. This… creature. It lusted for blood, for fear, for pain. It hated. It wouldn’t stop until the entire world was razed, piece by insignificant piece. And somehow, by some insane coincidence, this house was the lucky starting point. 

“Go away,” I said shakily, into the face of death, “leave this house!”

I shut my eyes, unable to stand it, and swung first, for all the good it would do. Instead, I hit empty air. I risked opening my eyes, and found nothing. All it left in its wake was a rotten smell, and the ratty remains of the jacket I’d lost on the way here. The dots started to connect. 

I stood there for a while, trying desperately to make sense of everything that just happened. When the light of day started to creep in through the hole, my legs finally unlocked. I took a few loose boards from the crawlspace and waited until May left to nail them over the hole, shoving furniture against it for good measure. 

It never left. During the nights, it paced the outside, just loud enough for me to hear. The stench was overwhelming, seeping through the cracks in the attic roof. It tapped the walls as it went, and I followed it. I couldn’t understand why it hadn’t come to kill us yet, but I would play its game, if it had any hope of being a warning.  

Tap. “You won’t get away with this.” Tap tap. “I won’t let you, you rotten fuck.” Tap tap tap.

I was losing it a little, more than I already had. I followed the yellow wallpaper, crawling along the attic floor whenever the tapping began and insulting the horrible thing I could almost see on the other side. 

All this to say, I wasn’t paying attention when I nudged a box or two, but the shattering of a glass Jack o’Lantern snapped me out of it. I’d made a thousand tiny sounds up here, but this one was too loud to be ignored. Confused, unsure footsteps made their way through the house and to the attic hatch. 

“Hello?” She called, and I bit my lip, choking back the urge to just give myself away. But I couldn’t. If I got forced out now, she would be defenseless, having no idea what lurked just beyond her walls until it was too late. Instead, I moved quietly around the small space, dodging her until she found the decoration and decided out loud it had just been an animal. Or maybe her motherly spirit playing a nasty joke.

I didn’t like it, but it gave me an idea. She wasn’t safe here, and there was no chance or time for me to warn her properly. I could still get her to leave before it was too late, but it wouldn’t be pretty. 

I bided my time as the nights grew colder and longer. When I started, it was small things. Knocking on interior walls. Opening cabinets and drawers, leaving things in too much of a mess to be ignored. It was subtle at first, but May began to get nervous. I left her notes in odd places, an inarguable “GET OUT” she would always find. Every night, before the snow grew too heavy, I saw the shining red of the rat’s eye. The huff of its hungry breath. The scratching and tapping that never seemed to stop once the sun went down. 

I thanked god that May wasn’t a night owl. And then I made things worse. The ‘spirit’ in her house got serious.

I ran laps around the attic, up and down the stairs, racing through the house and ducking silently into a closet or a shadow whenever she gave chase to the split-second silhouette her sleepy eyes had seen. I stood on the hatch ladder and screamed with real despair, dashing out of sight when she rushed to investigate. I left long scratches on her doors and smeared handprints on her windows, something evil trying desperately to get out. 

She called the police the first time when the fire in the fireplace started on its own. They cared at first, sure. But when several full sweeps of the house found nothing, they began to distance themselves from the whole thing. They branded her as crazy, and it was quickly looking that way. By the week of Thanksgiving, one she’d have to spend alone in her prison of a house, she didn’t sleep in her bedroom anymore. Her eyes were sunken and her hair was a mess. But she was still clinging on.

Silently, I begged her to give up. To just pick up Tuesday, throw a bag in her car, and never come back to this place. If I was the only thing left to eat, I could be okay with that. I deserved it. Her grip on sanity was slipping, and the guilt I felt was so heavy I could barely process it. 

I watched her eat Thanksgiving dinner alone, letting the house go unhaunted for the day. It was almost peaceful. She had to think it was over. I only left long enough to grab a picture frame from her bedroom, somewhere I hadn’t dared to step foot in before. 

As midnight broke, I lowered myself down from the crawlspace I’d slipped into almost a year before. As I walked around the couch, I came eye to eye with Tuesday. She didn’t growl at me, only wagged her tail— how would her little doggy brain know it was my fault? 

Carefully, I took a handful of ash from the fireplace and spread my repeated message across the carpet. I looked at May one more time, curled in on herself next to her dog, a blanket pulled tight around her. She looked thin, and small. Her hair was tangled, with a few new gray strands. She’d fallen asleep with her glasses on again.

I wiped my eyes and sat the broken picture below the same words from before. As I climbed back into the ceiling, I thumped my boot hard against the wall. I heard her stir. This time, I wasn’t the one to scream. 

Through all my self-hatred, it finally worked. 

“I can’t do it anymore,” I heard her sob to her sister, the other end of a late night phone call. “I’ll leave now and be there in the morning. I know— I know I should’ve come sooner. But I’m coming now.” A sick sense of relief filled me as I listened to her shoving things into a bag and cursing whatever had driven her out of her family house. 

Exhaustion, both emotional and physical, was catching up with me. As I slouched beside the attic vent I was eavesdropping from, I was already almost gone. Maybe I’d get a full night’s rest, or maybe I’d be eaten in my sleep. Either way, it was finally quiet.

My head snapped up. I had just enough time to jump to my feet before the tap-less silence was broken by the cracking of wood. The abomination burst through the hole I’d covered like a battering ram, and it wasn’t here to introduce itself this time. An enormous claw came down, missing my face by inches. 

I dodged as best I could, but as I rounded the corner of one of the piles of boxed junk, I lost my footing and came down hard on the floor. As powerful as the creature seemed, no one is immune to inertia. It barreled past where I’d fallen, its course corrected just enough to send it to the floor, but not on top of me. I yelped as it crashed halfway through the attic hatch, stuck and screeching. Tuesday began to bark wildly.

It was a headstart, and however short it was, I was taking it. I launched myself through the gaps in the walls and burst out of the crawlspace, the cover board shattering beneath me as I fell. 

I threw myself out of the closet, and for the first time, May and I met terrified eyes. Time seemed to stand still. In the back of my mind, I still lived in that first night. That song was still playing. Always playing. If I didn’t tell her, I could leave today…

“RUN! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, RUN!”

With the evidence clearly heard upstairs, she didn’t have time to disbelieve the source. She broke free of whatever fear had locked her in place, scooped up Tuesday, and turned to do just that. I closed my eyes, waiting for the end. She’d made it out. That’s all I cared about.

I wish I could tell you that’s what happened. But the sounds of flesh tearing and blood spraying wasn’t from my own chest. I opened my eyes, and regretted it immediately. The front door hung open, her hand still dangling loose just above the handle. Flakes of snow blew in, dyed red by the fountain of blood bubbling from beneath the claws in her chest. She coughed once, twice, then the creature sank its jaws into her head. I stood by, frozen. 

A sharp yip brought me out of my stupor, and as a fluffy ball of red and white came sprinting toward me, I bent down and caught her like some twisted umpire. The creature looked back at me, its face dripping with gore, and it laughed. I held Tuesday close as I scrambled back into the walls. 

It never came after me. I had to listen to it chewing for hours through the walls, losing what little was in my stomach to begin with. Eventually, the millions of little noises blended together, forming a giant whiteout that surrounded my brain. 

I spent three days like that, I think. Could’ve been longer. Maybe not. The world felt distant. All I did was cry, and try my best to clean the blood from Tuesday’s fur. I kept her alive. It was the absolute least I could do. 

“You’re a good dog,” I told her, whenever I could force out words, “such a good little dog.” Her chest heaved when I held her close, grief we shared. The kind that all living, loving things will know at least once. 

When the fog lifted, I began searching for a way out. The attic was freezing now, the roof cave-in filled with snow. I dug until my fingers went numb, but it wasn’t gonna happen. At some point, I hit ice, thick and blue. It didn’t make sense, but I was fucking done looking for sense. 

I crawled through the walls for hours, looking for a weak spot. Nothing. The destroyed attic hatch was a gamble. I wasn’t stupid enough to not call a mousetrap a mousetrap. As soon as I dropped down, a looming shadow and the smell of old blood sent me scrambling back up the unsteady ladder. 

The cops came once. A week had gone by before anyone took note of May’s absence. They swept around for an hour or two, and they left. I never saw them again. 

Her sister stayed longer, the one time she dared to step foot in her sister’s haunted house. She took some of the photographs, walking around with wide eyes and a nervous pace, like a wolf was breathing down her neck. I beat my fists against the walls and screamed when she left. 

I know I could leave, if I tried hard enough. There are those minute-long spaces where it’s crawling in and out the same way I did, taunting me, or when it’s devouring the corpse of another person it’s pulled into here in the dead of night like a predator. There are moments when Tuesday and I could make a break for it. I could use what little battery is left on my phone to try and call someone. Anyone. But I don’t.

The truth is, I’m still scared. I’m sorry. I know it’s selfish. 

I play it out constantly in my mind, the things that could happen. I might end up in the bulging gut along with May, and all the other dinners that no one cared enough about to miss. There’s also a jail cell/padded room waiting for me out there, somewhere. And then, there’s the simple return. I could wander out into the growing winter and freeze. None of it would have mattered in the end, and that scares me much more than hypothermia. 

That being said, I don’t want to die. Lives are still at stake, and not just the one buried in my cocoon of blankets. I don’t deserve to escape this nightmare, but I’ll do it for May. Once the ice begins to thaw, I’ll find her sister. I’ll figure out something. I won’t let this thing have me; I won’t let it win.

When I run for it, I’ll think about that summer day that feels like lifetimes ago. Before everything went wrong. I’ll think of a boy who held my face and called me brave, and I’ll try to prove it. I’ll flee this place like a rat off a sinking ship, and I’ll come back with retribution. I just have to make it through the cold…

I just have to make it through the cold.
