“I wanna be a Boy Scout dad!” My little boy shouted at me from across the table, practically smashing his hand in the cake as he leaned crossed the table. 

“Oh yea?” I said enthusiastically. “What changed your mind little man?”

“I heard Carson talking about it at school today. It sounded really fun.” He was practically shaking with excitement. 

“What did I tell you about hanging out with Carson?” His mood went from static to timid. “Leo you know how I feel about him especially his language. You’re only in 5th grade for Christ sake.” 

“But you swear all the time daddy.” Leo said matter of factly. 

“You know it’s different when I do it. I’m a grown up and your kid. Now shut up and make a wish smart ass.” I said with a chuckle. He stuck his tongue out at me playfully, then closed his eyes and blew out the candles. He looked back up at me and I immediately knew what he wished for. So that night when the sugar rush turned to a sugar crash, I signed Leo up for Scouts.

I didn’t tell him until about a month later on the day of his first meeting. We were about 3 months into the school year so Scouts had already started. Luckily I had a friend in the school board that owed me a favor, so sign ups weren’t an issue.

“Why are we back at school dad?” My son said rubbing the sleep from his eyes. I told him we were going to see a movie and he’d fallen asleep almost as soon as the car left the neighborhood. 

“Your first Scout meeting of course” I said twisting my body so I could face the back seat. His eyes left mine and went to the uniform I was holding in my hand. 

“Holy crap dad!” He shouted snatching the uniform from me, undoing his seat belt and opening the door almost simultaneously. 

“Woah woah woah buddy aren’t you forgetting something?” I almost had to shout because he was halfway to the school entrance. He turned and shouted 

“Love ya dude!” 

“Love you too lil dude!” He turned and sprinted through the doors and into the gymnasium and disappeared from my sight.

“You’re a cool kid you know that?” Almost complimenting myself in a weird third person conversation. I pulled my baseball hat over my eyes reclined the seat and fell asleep. 

“Dad guess what!” He said slamming the car door as he got in. 

“Holy shit you scared the hell out of me kid” I said without choking on my heart while it was still lodged in my throat. “What’s up?”

“My first camping trip is next weekend! We learned all about the old Native American tribes that used to live here and we are going to visit a reservation next weekend!”

“Camping and learning at the same time? How can you say no to that. That’s some really exciting news kiddo” The camping trip was the only topic of discussion the entire next week leading up to his trip. When I went to drop him off at the school I could almost taste the sound of peace and quiet for an entire weekend. 

“You got everything you need packed in that bag right? You double checked?” I said using my sad tone. 

“Yes dad” he said with an eye roll. 

“Alright then. Get out of my sight and go have a good time.” He grabbed his bag resting in the seat next to him and rushed over to stand in line by the bus with his other Scouts. There were 6 kids and two Scout masters. I knew both fairly well so I felt a sense of comfort knowing they’d be watching my kid. I knew he was in good hands. 

After a beer and pizza filled weekend it was finally time to pick up my son. The New Mexico traffic was especially horrible. Today of all days. We literally have a desert in our back yard why the fuck was there so much traffic? On top of commute frustrations I was late to the pickup. The bus was gone and so were the other kids. All that remained was a Scout master and my son. I immediately knew something was wrong. The man had a concerned look on his face while looking at Leo, and Leo had no look on his face at all. He just stared straight ahead occasionally blinking but very off rhythm like he forgot how. 

“I’m sorry im late lil dude traffic was terrible” I said guilt seeping into my voice. He said nothing at all just silently walked to my car. As I was examining him I noticed numerous things were off. For starters when you would take a step he’d almost trip over his own foot. Secondly his fingers looked slight longer then when I sat saw him. When he got to the car door he just stood there and looked at it like he’d never seen it before. Figuring he was upset about me being late I got out and opened the door for him. He then gave a slight nod to himself like he’d just learned something. 

I closed the door behind him and walked over to the remaining Scout master. 

“Hey Kevin how was the camping?” I said trying to act like Leo wasn’t being a complete weirdo. 

“It was fine Vince. But something happened with Leo. 2 hours after he arrived he started asking if anyone heard the woman in the forrest. Thinking it was  kids imagination running wild everyone just laughed it off. Later that night one of the kids saw him walk into the sandy nothingness and immediately came to wake me and George up. We followed his tracks until we reached two rocky hills with a ravine in between. Then the tracks stopped. We searched until morning with no luck. When day broke we retreated back the reservation camp site. Leo was sitting in the sand when we got back. We all peppered him with questions but never got an answer. He didn’t make a noise the rest of the trip. Not even the bus ride home. Maybe you’ll have better luck talking to him. I’m really sorry about all this Vincent.”

I looked at him with rage, then confusion, then anxiety. 

“As long as my boys not hurt that’s all that matters to me. I’ll see if I can get him talking and let you know what he says. Thanks for getting my son home safe” I briskly turned and walked back to the car and turned the key in the ignition. The whole way home I layed into Leo about how his trip went but just like Paul said there was no response. Not even at dinner. Not even when I went to bed. So when I hear him talking to himself in his room that night of course I eavesdropped.

“Hello?” It was my son’s voice but something was off. It was a few octaves deeper and it sounded like he had something in his throat. 

“Your not Carson”

“What’s that smell?”

It continued for about 30 minutes and then it stopped just as suddenly as it began. After a good minute or of making sure it stayed silent, I quietly opened his door. He was turned over on his side facing the window covered up to the neck in blankets. His breathing was slow and deep so I figured he’d fallen asleep. I stood there and watched his breathing until I was sure he was out then I closed the door as quietly as I opened it and went to bed. 

When I woke up the next morning I realized Leo was still in bed. I went to go check on him and it’s like he was frozen in the same spot as last night. Still covered in blankets and still breathing slow and deep. 

“Rise and shine sleepy head it’s almost noo-“ I was walking over to where his head was facing when I realized his eyes were wide open and unblinking. His eyes moved from the window to mine still unblinking. 

“You okay Leo?” I said shakily trying not to show him I was slightly unnerved. Again he just stared coldly and emotionless. I went back to my room confused as all hell so I could call a doctor. After about 30 minutes of checking every nook and cranny I stood there stumped. 

“I coulda sworn I left my phone on the nightstand” I said scratching my head. I went back to Leo’s room and confronted him. 

“Did you take my phone? You know the rules about stealing”. He just looked at me with that same cold stare as before. Clearly something was wrong with my son and it was my job as his father to make sure he’s alright. I waited in the living room all day to see if Leo would come out of his room. I figured prodding bore no fruit so the next best thing was patience. I let out a long yawn and looked behind me to check the time on the microwave: 10:26. 

“Bedtime” I said through another massive yawn. I shuffled through the hall turning off the lights as I go. When I passed Leo’s door I didn’t hear a peep so I figured he was sleeping. I closed my bedroom door behind my stripped down to my boxers and flopped on the bed. 

“You’re not Carson. Hello?” My son’s voice slowly pulled me out of my slumber. When I finally realized what I was hearing I froze in my bed not moving a muscle. It wasn’t coming from his room anymore it was coming from all over the house. It would move down the hall into the living room and kitchen then back up and repeat. I almost couldn’t hear it at first but when he’d go into the kitchen and come back down the hall I could hear his footsteps. It sounded like someone was walking on all 4s through my house. But just like the other night it stopped as suddenly as it began. I waited a good while before I mustered up the balls to open my door. I flipped on the hall lights and went to Leo’s room. I opened the door swiftly. He was laying the exact same way as the night before.

“I know you’re not sleeping Leo” I said in my angry parent voice. As I walked over to face him I fully expected his eyes to be wide open like every other time. But to my suprise they were closed. Leo was asleep. This didn’t comfort me though it just made me more uncomfortable. 

“Am I losing my mind or something? Is this a mid life crisis?” I said trying to rationalize everything. After what seemed like hours of restless tossing and turning I finally drifted back to sleep. 

I woke up the the faint sound of a breeze and birds chirping. I rolled over thinking I opened the window last night when I saw it was still closed. I listened closer and realize it came from Leo’s room. I threw the sheets off me and bolted to his door. Sure enough the window was open and Leo was gone. Thinking my son was abducted and still in the absence of my phone I ran to the key ring by the front door. 

“My fucking keys too are you serious?!” I shouted in anger and desperation. Running out of time and options I decided to get dressed and check the back yard. When I say back yard I mean back sand. The desert is every kids playground around here. It stretched for hundreds of miles the occasional tree clove here and there. If someone did take my kid there would be tracks. But there was nothing. The only set of footprints I saw were that of a coyote that looked to be walking in a circle a few miles away from my house. Calling out for him did no good either. Even if he did hear me with how he’s been acting lately I’d doubt he’d answer. 

I sprinted back to the house the pit in my stomach grew even bigger. When I reached the front door the pit turned to a hole. My front door was open. I stood there for awhile frozen in fear before drawing the side arm from my hip. I searched around the house corner to corner shadow by shadow gun drawn and pointer finger ready. As I threw open my kids door I lowered my gun. Leo was standing on his bed looking out the window. His shirt and pants covered in dirt and red orange grain but that’s not what caught my attention. His shoes were missing and his arms looked longer. The proportions aren’t too noticeable but they are definitely off. The tips of his fingers touched the bottom of his thighs but he wasn’t hunched he stood perfectly straight. 

L-Leo?” I stammered. The human  part of me wanted to raise my weapon again but the dad part of me still saw my son. At the sound of my voice he methodically layed down and covered himself with blankets again. I rushed over to him to see what his face looked like since I could only see his back. His hair was filthy and so were his cheeks and forehead. His lips were cracked and pale. On the top of his forehead near his hairline I noticed a small cut, almost like a tiny tear in his skin. There was a small blood trail but something wasn’t right. It was dark and think like it had been there for awhile. But that’s impossible because I’d just seen his face the other day and it was completely fine. 

“How did you get this bud? Where the hell did you go?” I said softly lightly touching his wound. As soon as I made contact with the cut his eyes shot open. This time there was an emotion. Anger. I froze in my tracks and quickly retracted my hand. Leo sat up in his bed his gaze never shifting from mine. 

“Sorry Leo I didn’t mean to hurt you I was just checking it out.” I said timidly. He said nothing. Just a threatening unblinking stare. As I slowly made my why to his door I felt his eyes burning the back of my head. When I closed the door behind me I heard the sound of him laying back down.  

I was stuck here. I had no help or communication with the outside world. If I told the neighbors they’d think I was crazy or worse that id hurt my son. I weighed out the pros and cons all day until I stopped to check the time and realized it was almost midnight. As soon as I knew the time it’s like my body knew it was time to rest. The feelings of anxiety and fear were slowly overwhelmed by exhaustion as I made my way to my bedroom I paused to make sure Leo was sleeping. I heard no noise so I assumed he was and went to lay down in my bed. 

“Tomorrow im going next door and telling Frank. I don’t care what he’ll think I just want to help my boy”.  Tears welling up in my eyes. I had a plan though and that was enough to help ease my mind into sleep. 

I woke up shivering despite having all the blankets on me. 

“Jesus fucking Christ” I said as my teeth chattered. I checked my bedside clock and it read 2:43 am. I threw on some sweatpants and a hoodie and made my why to Leo’s room. His bed was empty but the window was still closed. As I made my way down the hall I nearly pissed myself when I reached the living room. The front door was wide open. On the porch I saw my phone. I quickly grabbed it and shut the door locking it behind me. I set it on the kitchen island and flipped on the lights. 

“What the fuck is happening” I yelled rubbing my hands in my hair manically. And then i remembered Leo wasn’t in his room. 

“Hello?” I heard Leo’s voice coming from the back yard. I rushed to the back window and frantically searched for the sound of my son’s voice. I could see him standing about 200 feet away from me staring into the empty darkness of cruel unforgiving sand. But this time the proportions were noticeable. His knuckles were scraping the ground as his little 5”1 body stood perfectly straight. A soft whimper left my voice followed by a quiet “What the fuck?”  

“You’re not Carson”

 I watched Leo unnaturally bend down until he was on all 4s. His extended arms and appendages reaching far further from his legs causing his back to be impossibly arched.  He crawled around on all 4s while I watched and listened in horror. He kept saying the same phrases over and over again. The sound of my phone ringing made me jump. 

Paul is calling…

I quickly picked it up. Paul’s frantic voice exploded over the phone. 

“Vincent what the fuck man I’ve been calling you for days.”

“Paul? I lost my phone I just found it what the hell is going on?!?”

“After we spoke I went back and told the natives that lived on the reservation. They had me show them the two hills I saw. They sent a young man down the ravine and he immediately cried for us to pull him back up. When we finally pulled him out he was a mess. He could barely form sentences until he started speaking a different language. The natives all had a look of terror smeared across their faces until one of the older ones told me to call the tribal police. 6 squad trucks arrived on scene in 30 minutes with climing gear and biohazard bags. When they climbed back up I noticed they had at least 14 bags full of something. One of them approached me and asked if I lost a kid out here. I told him yes but he was found soon after. He looked at me confused and asked if im sure. I told him I was and the confusion grew. They told me they had found hundreds of piles of organs, muscle, tissue and bones varying in all shapes in sizes. But one of them was the size of a child’s and matched the time of disappearance. Vince that’s not Leo.”

I hadn’t said a word this whole time. As I sat there in shock I realized the voices were gone. I peered out the window and there was nothing. He was gone. 

“Paul I have to go.” I said sternly and immediately hung up not waiting for a response. I dialed 911 as fast as I could press the 3 numbers. When the police arrived I told them everything. Obviously they looked at me like I was crazy but I told them I had multiple people to back my story up. But I never heard from Paul again. As a matter of fact no one has. He just disappeared. His car was found in his driveway with the key in the ignition. There was no one to help corroborate my story except the natives and they told the police jack shit. 

It’s been 5 years since I’ve seen my son. I miss him everyday and I still cling to the hope he one day comes back even though I know it’s unlikely. But lately I’ve been hearing a familiar voice, almost like Paul’s. It started off as just a likeness of him incoherently rambling from the endless dead nothingness that spread behind my house. But after awhile I started hearing it clearer. And closer.  Last night I finally understood what I was hearing. In Paul’s voice I heard- “Your not Carson”
