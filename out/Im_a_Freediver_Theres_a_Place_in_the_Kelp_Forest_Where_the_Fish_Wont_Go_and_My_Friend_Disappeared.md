I don’t dive kelp anymore.

I still freedive—pools, sandy bottoms, clear blue drop-offs where you can see the bottom from the surface—but not kelp. Not where the light turns into broken beams and you can’t see what’s behind the stalk next to your face.

If you looked at my Instagram, you’d think I was lying. There’s a video on there from last year: bright morning off the Central Coast, flat ocean, a six-pack charter boat rocking lazily on a kelp bed. You can see me and my buddy Tom doing warm-up drops off a float, sea lions looping around the hull. All very “ocean therapy” vibes.

There’s nothing from below fifteen meters in that forest. I deleted all of that.

The official story is that Tom blacked out at depth and got tangled. “Freediver error.” Our fault. The report doesn’t mention the band of dead water where the fish wouldn’t go. Or the thing that pulled on our float line like it was checking what we were.

It was Tom’s idea to book that trip.

We’d both finished a level-two freediving course a month earlier down in La Jolla. Passed our thirty-meter dives. Learned how not to die in blackout scenarios. Came home with new dive watches and an inflated sense of our own competence.

Tom went all-in. Sold his longboard to buy carbon fins. Started DMing comp divers he followed like he was networking now. He wanted depth records and sponsor tags. I just wanted to stop feeling like my lungs were going to explode at ten meters.

“Glass out there,” he texted me that morning. “Harbor webcams look like a lake. You working?”

I was off. I had my phone in one hand and a mug of coffee from the office Keurig in the other. My boss had just dropped the schedule for the next two weeks on my desk: wall-to-wall shifts.

“If I say no, will you leave me alone?” I wrote back.

He sent a selfie from the dock instead of answering. Thick black 5mm suit peeled down to his waist, hood hanging. Behind him: a faded white charter boat with KATE LYNN painted on the stern in chipped blue letters, and a captain who looked like he’d been carved out of sun damage and cigarettes.

“Spot’s paid for,” the caption read. “You can nap on the way out.”

I stared at my calendar for another second, thought about two weeks of fluorescent lights and stale break room air, and caved.

“Give me thirty,” I typed. “Don’t let the captain leave without my pretty face.”

The harbor was quiet when I got there. Gulls yelling over the fish processing plant, a couple of guys pushing carts of tanks down the dock, diesel and salt in the air. The kind of morning brochures like to pretend is every morning.

KATE LYNN bobbed at the slip. The captain checked our names off a clipboard, then did the safety spiel in the bored tone of someone who’s done it four times a week for twenty years.

“Life jackets under the bench, O₂ here, first aid kit here,” he said, tapping each box with a knuckle. “If you’re gonna pass out, try not to do it under the boat. You guys are just breath-holders, right? No tanks?”

“Just freediving,” Tom said, grinning. “We brought our own float and line. We’ll stay on it.”

The captain looked at the orange float at Tom’s feet, the coiled hundred-foot line, the small anchor clipped to the end. He grunted.

“Every guy says he’ll stay on the line,” he said. “Every season someone chases a fish and makes me call the Coast Guard. You wanna screw around, do it on someone else’s boat. We clear?”

“Yes, sir,” Tom said, still smiling. He always smiled when someone challenged him. It was like a reflex.

We motored out of the harbor, around the breakwater, and into low, gentle swell. The water outside was stupidly calm—small rolling bumps, no whitecaps. The kind of day you talk about for months afterward.

“Gonna drop you boys on the outside edge of the big bed,” the captain yelled over the engine, pointing at a darker patch ahead of us. “Sounder says twenty-eight meters. Lots of bait and bass under the canopy. You’ll have company.”

Tom practically vibrated. “Dude, if the viz is even decent, this is gonna be sick,” he said in my ear. “You brought your slate, right?”

I tapped the little white plastic board clipped to my belt. “Yeah, yeah. I brought your underwater notepad.”

He’d made fun of me when I bought it—“what, you gonna write poetry at twenty meters?”—until he got tired of having to surface every time I wanted to tell him something.

We passed over the kelp bed. From above, it looked like a thick mat of bronze coins, glossy in the morning sun. Sea lions popped their heads up and watched us go by, glistening and smug.

The captain put us on the outside edge, where the kelp thinned enough that you could swim between stalks without sawing your mask strap off. He killed the engine, the boat settled, and the hull started its slow, rhythmic roll.

We suited up. I pulled my 5mm over my shoulders, smeared spit in my mask, checked my snorkel clip. Tom fussed with his GoPro mount, making sure the little camera on his forehead was angled just right.

“Record or it didn’t happen,” he said, tapping it.

“Just don’t headbutt the boat,” I said. “Those videos are harder to monetize.”

He laughed, hopped to the transom, and did a clean flat-back entry into the water. I followed less gracefully. The cold slid down the back of my suit in that way it always does the first time, like someone poured ice along my spine. Then the neoprene sealed and it was bearable.

We swam the float a few meters into the bed and dropped the anchor weight between a cluster of kelp holdfasts, careful not to wrap the line around anything. The line hung down into the green.

I put my face in the water and forgot about the boat for a second.

Kelp is different from the top than it is from inside. On the surface it’s a mat. Underneath, it’s a vertical forest. Thick stalks rising from the bottom in tight groups, blades streaming out like flags in the swell. Sunlight slants down between them, turning the water gold and green.

Ten meters down, I could see fish already. Blacksmith, little rockfish, bright orange Garibaldi. A sea lion shot past, just a blur of smooth muscle.

It was beautiful. It was exactly the kind of setting you see in freediving videos with soothing music and inspirational captions.

That’s the problem with a lot of horror: if you freeze-frame it early, it looks like a screensaver.

We started with warm-ups.

Tom grabbed the line first, floated face-down for a couple of minutes, slowing his breathing. Then he jackknifed, did a clean duck dive, and started pulling himself down hand-over-hand, fins trailing.

I watched his long black fins disappear into the kelp’s lower levels. The forest swallowed him quickly.

My watch ticked time on my wrist. Twenty seconds. Thirty. Forty-five.

He came back up after maybe a minute, blew out, and did his recovery breathing, short exhales and big inhales like we’d been taught.

“Clear,” he said between puffs. He pulled his mask up for a second, eyes bright. “Man, it’s insane down there. Like a real forest. Big bait balls at ten, fifteen. Bass cruising through. You’re gonna lose your mind.”

I wasn’t sure if that was the phrase I wanted to hear. I tugged my mask back into place anyway.

“I’ll go to fifteen,” I said. “Stretch my ears out. Don’t move the float.”

He saluted.

I floated face-down, filling and emptying my lungs at a slow, steady rhythm. You can feel your heart rate drop if you pay attention, like someone letting off a brake pedal.

One more inhale—comfortably full, not max—and I tipped forward, hands sliding down the line.

The water closed over my head. Sounds from the boat dulled, replaced by the small noises of my own exhale and the creak of kelp.

I equalized every meter or two, pinching my nose and puffing gently until the pressure behind my sinuses eased. The light dimmed, turned greener.

Around ten meters, I passed into the busy zone. Schools of anchovy flickered between blades. A Garibaldi rushed up to my mask, turned, and flashed his orange side at me like a dare. Small rockfish hung near the stalks, their fins barely moving.

I stopped around fifteen, one hand on the rope, and just hung there.

Below me, the forest went on. Stalks thickened, closer together. The beams of light thinned. The bottom was somewhere another ten, twelve meters down from where I was, hidden in shade.

And below where I hung, past maybe twenty meters, the movement… stopped.

Up where I was, life was everywhere. Little flicks of silver, flashes of color, shadows of larger fish pushing through the schools.

Down there, there was nothing. No bass. No perch. No crabs on the holdfasts. Just kelp blades swaying in slow motion.

If there had been no fish anywhere, I’d have blamed temperature or oxygen or something else we learned about in passing. But the line was sharp. As if something had drawn a horizontal cutoff and everything with gills got the memo.

The hair on my neck prickled under my hood.

My lungs tapped me on the shoulder, reminding me I wasn’t down there on a tank. I turned, looked up, and pulled myself back to the surface.

Breaking through is usually a small relief. This time it felt like getting pulled out of a room you’d walked into by mistake.

“How’s it look?” Tom asked, hooking one arm over the float.

“Pretty,” I said. “And weird. Lots of activity up top. Nothing below twenty. Like a desert.”

He frowned behind his mask. “Like dead?”

“Not dead. Just empty.” I hesitated, then added, “Feels… wrong. Like it shouldn’t be that sharp.”

He shrugged. “Thermocline, maybe. Fish hang where the food and temp line up. You want the deep zone left to us.”

I tugged my slate up, flipped it around, and wrote:

FISH STOP AT 20

NOTHING MOVES LOWER

GIVES ME A BAD FEELING

I handed it over.

He read it, then tapped his pencil against the plastic for a second, thinking.

COULD BE TEMP / O₂

I’LL GO LOOK CLOSER

STAY ON LINE

He flashed me an okay sign, took a couple of big breaths, and dipped under again.

I watched his fins track down the line. Five meters. Ten. Fifteen. The schools parted around him.

He passed my strange “boundary” and kept going, into the emptiness.

At around twenty-five meters, he let go of the line and drifted a little to the side, turning slowly like he was panning for the camera.

I held the rope and saw him hang there, a dark shape in the green, a little cloud of bubbles escaping his hood and climbing toward me.

He stayed longer than I liked. Tom could do two-minute dives in class when he was focused, but this was cold water, a thick suit, current.

I shifted my grip on the line, not pulling, just… ready.

Something moved below him.

It was just at the edge of what I could see. A long, pale shape, thicker than any fish I’ve seen here, slid between two clusters of kelp at maybe thirty meters. I thought at first it was a trick of the light—the way shadows shift when surge moves the blades.

Then it turned.

Fish bend. Eels bend. Their whole body curves in one line.

This thing’s movement was segmented. One part of it seemed to pivot first, then the next, then the next, like someone turning a stack of boxes one at a time.

I couldn’t see a head. Just length and those strange jointed turns.

My hand went automatically to the handle of the knife on my belt, making sure it was still there.

The pale shape angled up, a little, and stopped. I had the horrible, specific sensation that it was… listening. The way a dog cocks its head when it hears a sound you don’t.

I looked down the line for Tom.

I didn’t see him at first. Just the kelp. Just the band of nothing.

Then a hand slid onto the rope from below, gloved fingers wrapping tight. His other hand followed. He started pulling himself up with powerful, calm motions. No panic.

He surfaced a couple of meters from the float, blew out, and did his recovery breathing, eyes closed.

“Big sand bass,” he said after a few breaths, laughing a little. “Just out of range. And yeah, dude, that band is freaky. It’s like someone drew a line where the world stops.”

I didn’t mention what I’d seen under him. I wasn’t ready to give it a name out loud. Not yet.

“Let’s maybe not hang in it,” I said instead. “We can stay in the busy part.”

He squinted at me. “You good?”

“I’m fine,” I lied. “I just don’t want to stack deep dives on an empty stomach. Couple of shallower ones, then I wanna go annoy the captain.”

He snorted. “You and your ‘don’t die’ kick. One more deep for me, you stay at fifteen like a safety diver. That cool?”

My slate was still in my hand. I almost wrote NO in big letters and held it in his face.

Instead I wrote:

YOU STAY ON LINE

I STAY ABOVE YOU

ONE MORE, THEN SHALLOW ONLY

He tapped the OK sign against it, then against his own chest, like he was swearing an oath.

We did the next one together.

We floated side by side for a minute, breathing slow. Inhale, exhale, long pauses, feeling our heart rates settle. The surface layer was cold enough along my cheeks that my lips were slightly numb.

“Last deep,” he said, mostly out of habit.

We both took a final inhale, duck-dived, and grabbed the line.

It feels different when two people are on the same rope. You can feel the small added tension, the tiny shifts when one of you kicks a little harder. His fins were just below me, flashing in my peripheral vision.

Five meters, ten. The kelp closed around us like pillars in a strange cathedral. Fish flared away, then drifted back in.

At eighteen meters, the water temperature dropped. I felt it slide into my hood and along my jaw, a clean, sharp chill. I equalized. So did he; I could hear the faint crackle.

At twenty-two, we crossed into the empty band. The busy world of flickers and shadows ended. Below: dim green-brown stillness.

We hung there for a second, both holding the rope, looking down.

I don’t know what he saw that I didn’t. Maybe the thing moved differently for him. Maybe something passed closer.

All I know is his eyes went from normal to wide behind his mask in a heartbeat, pupils big and flat.

He didn’t bolt. A panicked diver kicks. He just stopped, fingers going white on the line.

My own heart rate spiked. Every part of me that wasn’t brain wanted to twist around and look behind me. Training said don’t spin around in kelp like an idiot.

I didn’t turn. I slid closer and wrapped my off hand around his forearm.

He flinched, then looked at me. Little bubbles leaked from his nose as he exhaled more than he should have.

I pointed up. Exaggerated. The “we go now” sign.

He hesitated longer than I liked, then nodded and started up, slow and controlled.

We rose through the empty band, through the cooler water, back into the busy zone. Fish reappeared. The light brightened.

Something brushed my fin.

Not kelp. I know what kelp feels like—soft, slick, a little give.

This was firmer. Cooler in a different way. It slid along the blade from toe to heel and then was gone, too deliberate to be surge.

Every muscle in my body wanted to kick hard and get away from whatever that was. I forced my legs to keep their slow rhythm. Fast, sloppy kicks waste oxygen. I needed that more than I needed distance.

We broke the surface and did our recovery breaths. My hands shook a little on the float.

“You feel that?” he asked, breathy. “Something big moved down there. Like… like a log in a current.”

“Something touched my fin,” I said, throat dry. “Slid along it. Not kelp.”

“Probably just a seal,” he said automatically, then seemed to hear himself. There had been no seal silhouettes on that dive.

I pulled up my slate, wrote with my hand cramping tight:

I DON’T LIKE THIS

WE SHOULD GO BACK TO BOAT

He read it, looked at the boat—tiny and a little too far away for my taste—and made a face.

CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT

1–2 MORE SHALLOW ONLY

THEN WE BAIL

I wanted to say no. I really did. But you don’t go from “we’re fine” to “trip over” easily, especially when you’re out there on someone else’s time.

“Shallow,” I said. “Nothing below ten. Stay where we can see the hull. If anything pulls the line again, I’m out.”

“Deal,” he said. He actually stuck his hand out above water. I slapped it.

We unclipped the anchor weight and swam the float a bit closer to the edge of the bed, where the kelp thinned and the surface light punched down more cleanly. I could see the underside of the KATE LYNN now, the ladder, the hull rolling.

We did a few easy dives. Eight, ten meters, weaving in and out of the upper canopy. Anchovy schools glittered in the sunbeams. A sea lion rocketed by once, close enough that I felt the pressure wave on my suit.

For a bit, I almost managed to relax. I still checked the nothing-band every time I looked down. It was still there, a horizontal limit where all the life stopped as if cut off.

On the surface between drops, Tom was buzzing.

“Dude, this footage is going to be insane,” he said. “If I don’t look like a total kook, I’m gonna cut together a clip for that brand contest.”

“Make sure you tag ‘screamed internally,’” I said. “Accurate hashtag.”

He laughed and ducked his face back in the water.

I was floating on my back, staring at the sky, when the first big wrong thing happened.

The float jerked.

Not a little bob from swell. A hard, sudden yank from below that pulled part of the buoy under and dragged it a full foot toward the forest’s center.

The rope between my hand and the float went tight enough that the nylon creaked.

I rolled over fast, mask snapping back down, heart jumping into my throat. Tom had just broken the surface by the float, half a body length away, so I knew it wasn’t him pulling on anything.

The line dipped under my hand again, harder. The float dunked, water washing over its top. The clips on its sides rattled.

“Grab the line,” I said, out of breath even though I was on the surface.

“Dude, let go if it’s snagged—” he started.

The tension vanished.

The rope went slack, then slowly straightened again in the gentle surface swell.

I peered down along it.

The anchor weight we’d unclipped was clipped to the float now, so there was nothing heavy on the end. The line just hung, disappearing into the green.

Between two stalks about ten meters down, the light bent slightly. Something pale slid away from the rope, deeper into the kelp. I caught the jointed, segmented way it moved again before it vanished into shadow.

It had been holding our line and then decided to let go.

I didn’t think. I pulled the whole length up hand-over-hand until the end snapped out of the water. No kelp wrapped around it. No debris. Just the bare, wet rope.

“I’m done,” I said. My voice sounded flat. “That’s it. I’m going back to the boat.”

Tom opened his mouth, then shut it. For the first time since we’d left the harbor, he really looked at my face.

“Okay,” he said. He sounded like he meant it. “Okay. Let me do one last pass under the canopy and then we both go in, yeah? Just shallow. I won’t even go past the first holdfasts.”

He said it like a smoker promising to only have one more cigarette that night. Habit. Momentum.

“No deeper than ten,” I said. “You stay where I can see you the whole time. If you chase a fish, I swear to God I’ll cut your fins off.”

He gave me a weak grin. “You love me too much. I’ll be right back.”

He took two or three calm breaths, duck-dived, and slipped under.

I kept my face in the water. I wasn’t going to be the guy staring at the sky when his buddy vanished.

He leveled out around eight meters, just under the sun-speckled canopy, and swam parallel to the edge of the bed. A school of bigger fish—the kind that make people spend too much on spearguns—hung just out from him. White sea bass, probably. Thick bodies, faint stripes.

He didn’t have a gun with him, but instinct is instinct. He angled toward them a bit, curious.

They flared away, then re-formed, moving just ahead of him. He followed for a few kicks, still in that upper band.

I was about to tap on the float and signal him back when the entire school snapped upward in a tight, silver column.

Something pale shot through the space they’d been in.

For a second it looked like someone had fired a thick cable along the bottom of the kelp. It was that fast. One moment there was nothing, the next there was a length of pale body curling around Tom’s legs.

He didn’t even have time to react.

The creature—whatever it was—looped around him again, higher. A coil across his thighs. Another around his chest. The ridged sides folded and tightened in one fluid motion.

His body snapped rigid. His fins kicked once, purely reflex. A stream of bubbles blasted out from his mask and hood.

He didn’t have a regulator in his mouth to lose. That was the only difference between this and a tank diver’s nightmare.

I didn’t think about it. There wasn’t time.

I spat my snorkel, took the biggest breath I could in a single panicked inhale, and went down.

The water closed over me fast. The taste of rubber from my mouthpiece, salt, and adrenaline was all I had for a second.

I narrowed everything to three points: the float line under my hand, the dark shape of Tom wrapped in pale coils, and the pressure in my chest.

He was at maybe nine meters. Not deep, but with something around his chest and neck and no air, every second counted double.

The creature’s body was thicker than it had looked from above. Up close, it was about as big around as my torso. The skin was a dull, clam-shell white, with a faint, irregular pattern under it like veins or fibers. Along its sides, those ridges I’d felt earlier flexed and moved in small waves.

Tom’s face behind his mask was red, eyes wide and unfocused, mouth strained against the strap. One coil ran diagonally across his jaw and temple. I could see the skin under it already flushing where the ridges dug in.

I grabbed that coil with one hand.

It felt wrong. Not like fish, not like shark. There was give to it, but not the right kind. The ridges pressed into my glove like sucker-less suction cups, tasting the neoprene.

The pressure around my wrist increased. The ridges tightened. For a heartbeat, I had the very clear sensation of being measured.

I yanked my knife with the other hand and drove it down across the band.

The blade bit. There was resistance, then a sudden give. Dark fluid—almost black in the green water—puffed out into the space between us.

The coil spasmed. The whole length of the thing flexed. The water around us shook.

Kelp around us snapped upright and back. Leaves slapped against my mask and hood. A stalk somewhere near my fin cracked like a broom handle breaking.

The band across Tom’s chest loosened half an inch. He surged in it, trying to use the slack. Another coil shifted up, around his shoulders, tightening there instead.

He was out of air. You can tell, even without words. The panic in his eyes shifted from “this hurts” to something more primal. His movements got jerky and uncoordinated.

My own lungs burned. I’d taken a crap breath and then spent it fighting. CO₂ alarms went off all through my body, loud and insistent.

I went for another coil, lower this time, where it held his legs and the float line.

The knife sank maybe halfway before it hit something tougher. I leaned on it, feeling the blade grind against cartilage or bone or something else solid.

The creature’s body twisted. A section near what I think was its far end flared wider. The ridges there flattened, revealing a darker patch that opened and closed once.

I didn’t see teeth. I saw the shape—the roundness, the flex—and the way it angled toward me.

A sound rolled through me. Not something I heard in my ears. A vibration. Low, steady, like a big diesel engine idling against my ribs.

Every instinct I had screamed RUN in a language older than actual words.

My chest cramped. My throat spasmed. My body tried to force an inhale.

If I took a breath, I’d die down there with him. That fact cut through everything.

I let go of the knife.

I grabbed Tom’s shoulders instead and kicked upward, hard, using the line as much as my legs.

The coil around his legs held. The one around his chest tightened again as the creature reacted to our movement, trying to maintain its grip.

For one awful second, we didn’t go anywhere. It was like pulling against a solid post.

Then something gave. Not the creature. Tom.

His hood slipped.

The friction of the coil across his jaw ripped his mask strap free. The mask spun away, bumping my shoulder. His face, suddenly bare to the water, looked wrong—eyes bloodshot, lips pale, bits of dark fluid in the corners of his mouth from where the ridges had scraped his cheek.

He convulsed once more.

His hand, which had been clawing at the coil, dropped.

I’ve practiced rescuing unconscious divers in controlled pools, in class, with instructors watching and safety divers on hand. You learn the feel of dead weight. It’s a specific thing, limp and heavy.

I felt that snap into him like a switch.

The vibration in the water grew stronger. The ridged side of the creature brushed my thigh as it repositioned, and the line of the float slid along its body.

My lungs went from “this hurts” to “we are done.”

Instinct beat training. For me, anyway.

I let go.

I wish I could say I didn’t. I wish I could say I held on until my vision went black and we both woke up on the surface being resuscitated by heroic strangers.

I didn’t.

I pushed off his shoulder instead, aimed for the lighter water, and kicked like I’ve never kicked before.

The kelp blurred. The empty band, the busy band, all of it went past too fast to register. My ears screamed from the ascent rate. I felt something tug at my fin once, then slip.

I cleared the surface in a mess of spray and foam, half-choked on my own reflex inhale.

The sky was too bright. The boat was still there. The float bobbed a couple of meters from me, rope trailing limp.

Tom didn’t surface.

“Where is he?” someone yelled from the boat. It took me a second to realize it was the captain.

I couldn’t answer at first. I was coughing, water and snot and a little bit of bile burning my throat.

“Diver under!” I finally managed, waving one arm. “He’s—he’s under—”

The captain hit an air horn three times and started yelling for the other divers to get out of the water. Someone on deck threw a life ring without thinking. It splashed near me and drifted away.

I sucked air, pulled my mask up on my forehead, and rolled to look down.

The kelp obscured everything. Stalks, blades, shafts of light. The nothing-band. No Tom. No pale coils.

The float line hung free, end swaying.

For a second I thought I saw the long pale shape again, deeper in, moving parallel to the edge of the bed.

Then the boat shadow slid over us and my visibility dropped.

The Coast Guard was called. The captain had to. We were still on the clock.

I remember being hauled up the ladder, my suit dripping, my knees shaking hard enough that I had to sit on the deck. Someone wrapped a towel around my shoulders and kept saying “breathe” like I’d forgotten how.

They made me lie down anyway and put oxygen on me because that’s what you do when someone comes up panicked and fast. A crewman kept asking me how deep I’d been, how long I thought I’d stayed, if I’d blacked out.

“I didn’t black out,” I said, over and over. “I left him. I left him down there.”

They chalked that up to shock.

The other divers—tank guys who’d been doing an entirely different site on the same boat—stood around in various states of half-suited and stunned. The captain paced. He wouldn’t look at the water.

The Coast Guard boat arrived, then another official boat with sonar. They dropped a marker buoy near where we said we’d last seen Tom. They tried to put a team down, but by then surge had picked up and the kelp had shifted. Visibility dropped below anything they considered safe.

They searched until light went. They searched the next day with ROV cameras and more sonar. They found bits of kelp, rocky ledges, one of Tom’s fins. Not the one I’d felt tug. That one was just… gone.

They didn’t find him.

My statement that afternoon in the harbor office was a mess. I sat in a metal chair in my half-peeled wetsuit, shivering under sweats and a loaner jacket, and told them what I remembered.

The officer—a guy in a polo with a clipboard and tired eyes—wrote “entanglement” and “possible hypoxia” and “buddy attempted rescue” on his form. He circled “no tank,” underlined it twice.

He asked me three times if Tom had been chasing a fish.

“Yes,” I finally said. “Kind of. He followed a school. He was still shallow. Something grabbed him.”

“Something?” he repeated, pen hovering. “Like kelp?”

“Like… like an animal.”

He paused. “What kind of animal?”

I could have said “sea lion.” I could have said “shark.” Those would’ve slotted neatly into his paperwork.

“I don’t know,” I said. “Long. Pale. No fins I could see. Coiled around him. Ridges along the side. It… squeezed.”

He looked at me for a long second. His expression didn’t change, but I could feel the quiet click of him moving my account from “useful” to “compromised.”

“We don’t have anything like that in the local species database,” he said finally. “Sounds like you might’ve been disoriented. It happens when you’re on breath-hold and working hard.”

“I know what disorientation feels like,” I snapped. “I did your stupid class. This wasn’t that.”

He wrote “reported ‘unknown animal’” on his form without comment.

Tom’s GoPro was still on his head when the coil wrapped around his face. I saw it. I remember my fingers brushing the mount when the mask slipped.

They didn’t find that either.

The story the news ran the next day was the one you’d expect.

LOCAL FREEDIVER MISSING OFF MORRO BAY, the headline said under a photo of Tom from his own social feed, mask on his forehead, grin wide. Subhead about “danger of breath-hold diving without proper safety protocols.”

They called me his “instructor-trained buddy” and said I “attempted rescue but was forced to surface.” They quoted the Coast Guard about shallow water blackout, about how quickly a diver can lose consciousness at depth.

No one printed the part where I said something had wrapped around him.

The captain didn’t go back to that bed for the rest of the season. I know because I kept checking his charter calendar and asking around. He’d anchor at other spots, talk up other reefs. If anyone asked about the kelp forest, he’d say conditions weren’t good that week.

When people in the freediving group chats brought the incident up, they framed it like the article had. “Blackout.” “Overconfidence.” “Probably got hung up and couldn’t clear his snorkel.” The usual cautionary-story phrases.

I didn’t correct them. It would’ve turned into a fight I didn’t have the energy for.

One guy messaged me privately—another local diver I barely knew in person.

“Hey man,” he wrote. “I was out at [different kelp bed] last month. Not same site, but same coast. Not sure if it helps, but… I saw that thing you wrote about the fish line. Where everything stops. We had that too. No fish below maybe 18m. My buddy thought it was temp. Didn’t feel like that.”

I asked him if anything touched his line, if anyone didn’t come back up.

He said no. They bailed when it felt off. “Gut didn’t like it,” he wrote. “Figured we’d save the PR for a day I’m less attached to.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Every time the fridge compressor kicked in, that low hum made me sit up and stare into the dark, listening for the sound of something sliding along the outside wall.

After a week of that, I unplugged the fridge one night just to prove to myself the sound wasn’t in the house.

It wasn’t. I still heard it anyway, low in my chest, like an afterimage.

There’s not really a neat lesson here.

I could say “don’t freedive alone” or “always stay on the line” or “respect your depth limits.” All of that is true and you should do it.

But we were together. We had a line. We stayed within our training, on paper. We did everything you’re supposed to put in a brochure.

Something out there still found us.

If you dive kelp, pay attention to what the life around you is doing. Fish know more than you do. If every bait school and bass stops at the same depth for no obvious reason, ask yourself why.

If your float line gets pulled from below hard enough to dunk the buoy, and the captain swears the anchor is up, don’t tell yourself it’s just surge.

And if your buddy takes the slate and writes I DON’T LIKE THIS / WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE BOAT?

Listen to him. Even if you think the viz is too good to waste.

Sometimes the thing you’re worried about isn’t hypoxia or entanglement.

Sometimes it’s something that already learned where you have to breathe and is just waiting at the edge of that, quiet, testing how hard it has to pull to see what you’ll do.
