The cold air of the abyss slapping my face brought me back to my senses as we flew out the back of the motel. I didn’t even remember grabbing June’s hand and sprinting for the steps after I registered what was coming for us in that crypt below. My brain was in overdrive.

We had the code now. We had the key to the drill. All we needed to do was get to the door.

We didn’t speak or scream or make even a whimper as we took off down the alley and back down the tunnel to the vending machines. Just huffed like racehorses as our boots kicked the concrete.

My hip was a heartbeat of pain set to the rhythm of my steps, but despite that, I was able to press at top speed, the fear of eternal damnation in the folds of an eldritch god far more terrifying than the long-term damage I’d have should I survive.

The good news was that Il-Belliegħa was below us in the tunnel still, and I had a feeling that trying to squeeze its massive form up the tight stairs would buy a little more time. It would have to double back the way it came to go up the tower, but by then, we’d hopefully be past that place and on our way to the door.

The iron barrier would take some time to open, but hopefully we’d have enough of a head start to get in and shut it before the beast caught up.

June and I had just made it to the motel’s edge when the streetlights began to flicker rapidly like the lights below. I assumed that it had to be from the creature being directly beneath us, but as we pressed forward, the road warned us to stop.

In the flickering light of the street, we could see the dirty, debris and blood-stained asphalt become clean beneath a warping haze. The ground almost flickered along with the lights, changing states and growing slowly darker. The cracks in its surface stitched themselves back together with a will of their own, and the grime staining the weathered stone faded as the road became brand new again.

But it didn’t stop. Once restored to its original state, the asphalt began to turn translucent, starting from a point in the center of the anomaly's radius and working outward. It was like the street was melting away, its edges peeling back to reveal a giant hole. Within was no office area like the one we’d just come from, however. Inside were dunes of black sand that glittered in the streetlights above.

It all happened so fast that June and I barely had time to hit the brakes and avoid toppling into the chasm. We were already turning and running the other direction when we saw the top of a pale visage begin cresting the edge of the pit, along with a long, bony hand that cracked and snapped with each movement.

The limb looked disturbingly human aside from the fact that it was also *the size* of a human. 5 feet wide and long, its skin a dark, inky-grey with choked purple bruises all over it. Its nails were familiar too, if not grime-covered and riddled with chips and scratches. I could see obsidian sand stuck beneath the nails collected from it’s home far below us, and I wondered how it could scale the cliffs so easily with such human digits.

The hand gripped the edge of the pit and began pulling itself up, and I was barely able to catch a glimpse of one other thing.

It wasn’t bones that created the grotesque snapping that had haunted my dreams for so many nights. As Il-Belliegħa’s arm angled itself out of the hole, I could see that it was infected by a nest of wood; sharp splinters of a timber black as the abyss that speared and sprouted out of its skin like seedlings from soil.

The stiff, broken splinters fixed and hardened instantly beneath the skin with each pause in its movement, only to make the beast snap it free when it desired to continue on. If this was painful to the creature, I had no idea, but I couldn’t imagine it was convenient for it.

‘Roots,’ I recalled. ‘It’s connected to the roots.’

Suddenly the hole in the ground made sense, as well as the reversal of the road and the flicker of the lights. Hope had told me her theory that this place was like a notebook, each instance of it in time preserved on separate pages with some leaving imprints on the ones beneath it. If the drill was a tool that could cut a hole through the sheets to travel across them, then Il-Belliegħa was a creature that could simply turn through the book; a beast connected to every instance of this place, past and present.

It had flipped its page back to the beginning, back before any of the town ever existed, and it had climbed through the hole in a road that was never there.

This theory was proved when, as June and I carried on toward the neighborhood away from the horrific being, I watched its silhouette pull itself onto the street, then seal the chasm up behind it to stand on. It remained there only for a moment to stare at us before its bones snapped onward in pursuit.

I cranked my head forward to focus, unsure of what to do. With full control over the shelf, there was really nowhere for us to hide, and it was gaining fast. We needed to find a way to draw it away from the door, then double back quick enough to get inside before it caught up. I only prayed that Ann was being honest about the creature never getting inside the compound the last time it was up here, otherwise, we were in deep trouble.

For the moment, June and I just kept running, her slightly ahead and almost dragging me along as the endurance the adrenaline was offering me began to wane. We cut it around the corner of a house, then began weaving diagonally through them down alleys and backyards that we saw had no fences.

We hoped that the irregular pattern would be enough to buy us some time—to earn us enough distance so that we could pause long enough to gasp out a plan to one another. I risked a glance over my shoulder at one point to see that it was almost working; over the rooftops, the lights of the houses we’d just left in our wake were flickering to life as Il-Belliegħa followed, shifting the state of the shelf as it went. It didn’t seem to be weaving like we were, however. It didn’t need to. It was just popping the homes out of existence in order to pass straight through them. No matter where we went, and how many turns it should have needed to make, it was always tracking in a straight line.

This was still buying us some time, though. The beast having to find the right page we were on was definitely slowing it down, but that didn’t really matter if it somehow wasn’t loosing our position among the lanes of houses and abandoned roads.

“What do we do!?” June finally managed to huff out over her burning lungs, “I-It’s too fast!”

“I know,” I grunted back in fear, “I know, we just need to… We just…”

I had no real answer. For once, I didn’t really have a long-term plan other than run, and now more than ever that wasn’t going to help save us.

What’s worse is that June and I turned into a backyard that, to my dismay, had a fence we hadn’t noticed before entering. With no other options, we just ran at it and threw ourselves up, grabbing the top and vaulting over.

June beat me since she was in better shape, then grabbed my one useful arm to help hoist me over as I kicked against the wood. I found my footing, then flew over the other side, but when I hit the ground in the next yard over, a scream escaped my lips, and I gritted my teeth. My hip lit a fire through my nerves that climbed up into my torso and rattled my broken arm. The adrenaline was strong, but it was no match for the condition of my body.

I cursed under my breath for letting a cry slip out, knowing that if we had a chance of losing it a second ago, it was gone now. I rolled onto my feet and continued moving with June, however, a thought occurred to me that made my stomach drop.

It wasn’t going to lose us ever, even if I hadn’t made any noise. In my last dream, when the monster had finally found me, it hadn’t needed to hear me when I’d tried to bury myself in the sand. It only needed to sense my pain in the air. The sharp agony in my body radiating out like some divine scent to the horrible creature that desired to bring more upon me.

I was nothing but pain right now. Each step and stumble was a screaming alarm leading the beast straight to us. I was leading it straight to us wherever we went.

Just like back beneath the motel, the next few steps morphed into a numb blur that I can’t remember. All I recall is losing myself to thought. To the realization of what needed to happen.

All the rigs so far—all the horrors that had chased after us and that I’d sacrificed myself to lead away—Zane, the snake, Hensley 5. Even the angel when it grabbed me so that Ann could get out with the body. It was almost a cruel foreshadowing. The abyss preparing me for this moment right now. To make the ultimate sacrifice.

Il-Belliegħa was after *me*. I was the one connected to it, and I was the one screaming out in pain. If I wanted to spare the only version of myself closest to Hope and get her out of this place, I needed to make one last sacrifice. The most frightening one yet.

“June,” I panted out quietly, but sharp. I came to a stop, and she did too, but her expression was confusion and fear.

She tugged hard on my hand, “No. no—It’s okay, Hen, we’ll make this! I know you’re in pain, but—”

I reached into my pocket and swiftly yanked the note free, sticking it to her chest with a light pound so that she couldn’t resist. It stayed long enough for her hand to reach up and grab it, to which she frantically looked up and shook her head. She instantly knew from the rigs what my intentions were, and I hoped that, like the rigs, she trusted me enough to listen without question.

That she’d believe that I’d actually planned a way out for myself…

“Don’t let Ann stop you.” Was the last thing I barked out before shoving her away and turning back toward the creature of the depths.

With newfound despair twisting my guts, a second wind of adrenaline hit my veins, and I moved cleanly once more back toward the way we’d come from. What would it feel like if it caught me, I wondered? Were the whispers of agony from pain, or just from insanity of being attached to the thing for far too long? If I could help it, I would try to find a way to die before it could catch me. Maybe I would try to run to the edge of the shelf and cast myself to the black desert below before Il-Belliegħa was able to pull me into its mighty jaws.

I could hear the whispers still, even from so far away, permeating over the town and echoing into the black skies.

“Run, little girl… don’t let the wolf find you…”

“It’s too late for you… you are already lost…”

“Oh God, make it stop… make it end!”

They did little to help me find peace as I drew nearer to the snapping and crunching of root and bone. I could see the lights of houses once lit awakening from their long slumber as Il-Belliegħa drew closer and closer. I was ready to turn and take off down a nearby street in a different direction, but then I felt something grab my shoulder.

I was wrenched backward away from the nearest house, nearly toppling over from the shock and pain. I turned to my assailant with wild eyes, part of me thinking that the king of this land had somehow pulled a new trick with its shifting abilities. I barely had time to make out June's face, determined and terrified at the same time.

Without a word and before I could react, she gave me the same treatment that I’d given her with the note, slamming into my chest along with something hard and sharp. The key. Then, she took off past me, much faster and gracefully.

“June, no!” I screamed, but it was too late. She was too far ahead, and I would only be throwing us both into danger if I chased after. Suddenly, I knew what her and Hope felt like each time I’d run off without them. Helpless and frustrated.

I stupidly stood in place for a moment, trying to think of what to do, but I began to panic as June stopped at the house that Il-Belliegħa was currently barreling toward. If she wanted it to follow her like she planned, she’d need to be its primary target. The easier prey.

I was getting ready to call out and tell her to just go, but it was too late. The crooked slats on the dilapidated house straightened themselves out, the missing shingles reappeared on the roof, and from the now clean windows, flickering light burst to life and sliced out into the darkness. The wall only 40 feet in front of June began to fizzle away, and within a hollow sphere cut in the middle of the building, there it stood.

With all the lights from the home that weren’t sliced away now shining on the beast, there was no more confusion on what the king of the abyss might look like. It was large to go along with its hands that we’d seen, its head alone almost the size of a small car. Head wasn’t entirely the correct term, however. It had no real head. Only something akin to one.

It was a wooden mask. A shell carved carefully and ornately to form a human visage. It was abnormal in its features, however. It was ornate and almost looked like a headpiece to a theater stage or a gargoyle on a gothic building. While it still had a nose, mouth, and two dead, functioning eyes, its face was carved with decorative grooves and painted with shades of blue, white, black and red.

Its cheeks had two scarlet tears turned sideways to really make prominent its chiseled, bony features, and its face below the eyes was dressed in that ghastly, choked blue. Its eyes were two soulless orbs with pupils black as coal painted almost off center, giving its gaze an uncanny, lifeless glare. Black accents lined all the features, boldening it’s attempt at human mimicry but falling so wildly far.

The worst was its mouth, but not for appearance.

Unlike the rest of its face, the mouth was functional. Two red-painted lips turned up in the faintest of smiles, a line separating the middle. A line that parted as the wooden shell scraped against itself, the jaw unhinging like an old marionette. The square-shaped maw opened to only a black pit behind the face, the inside of the massive wooden blocks stained with muddy browns and fresh reds. The clomping sound of its feasting made morbid sense at the sight; the sound of two heavy walls clapping in on their prey. I could understand why poor Juarez’s body had its skin pinched so tightly as he was cleaved in half.

I could almost smell death in the air as its breath billowed out, along with the first sound I’d ever heard the creature make, even in my dreams.

A low, heavy, almost *mechanical* growl. Something between a pig’s snort and a drawbridge lowering. It wasn’t angry. I don’t think it was meant to be intimidating either. It was just a sound that the creature made, as if eager to see us.

  It snapped its crackling hand toward June, digging its fleshy fingers into the grass and hauling itself toward her.

My clone was shocked, but the fear of being pursued kicked in hard, and she took off running, releasing a scream as she went, half to draw its complete attention, and half to vent some of the twisted insanity from witnessing such a demonic being. The creature was chillingly fast, however, and June hadn’t realized just how long its vile arm was.

It speared the limb out at her fast, all the wood tangled beneath the skin breaking at once with a loud crack similar to lightning.

I shut my eyes, and tensed every muscle in my body, too afraid to watch what was about to happen. The second that followed felt like time had stopped as I waited and waited to hear June scream, or the hungry chomping of her bones being crushed between the massive slabs as her blood drained into its gullet, but when I only heard another rumble from the beast, followed by more snapping bones, I opened my eyes again.

I didn’t see June, but I did see Il-Belliegħa start off down the alley, its back turning to me as the house it was standing in re-formed back into its shambled state. It had missed. June had avoided it, and now it was on her tail. Her plan had worked.

The relief I felt made my knees weak and all the pain in my body go numb, but when I saw the back half of the creature, it didn’t last long.

Behind the mask, and where the beast's wood-tangled limbs attached, was a body so horrific and grotesque that it made my head spin with nausea.

It was bloated and fat like a cow, the skin along its spine thick with a shroud of gnarly black fur that sprouted out long and wispy. It blanketed down the main meat of the torso like a cloak, but beneath, it was hard to tell where the creature began and its *victims* ended.

There were all there. Everyone who Il-Belliegħa had ever crushed and drained between its slab-like jaws hung loose from the body between his arms and legs. Dangling naked from their legs that sprouted out of flesh, they were limp and pale, their arms scraping the ground as their faces gasped blankly outward in silent screams. Their eyes were hollow black sockets, and their jaws didn’t have any teeth, leaving them looking more like hanging rubber suits than corpses.

Within the tangle of bodies that swayed lifelessly as their host moved, I could make out smaller limbs and heads. At first I was horrified by the thought that maybe they were children—and it’s possible they were—but most didn’t have proper bodies or heads. It appeared more like they were new additions. Sprouts of growth watered by the blood sloshing in the beast’s guts.

None of the bodies made a sound directly, but as I stared at each one of them, their whispers grew louder, as if the connection of sight brought them fully back to life.

“P-Please, cut me free! Rip my bones from this creature and end this nightmare!” One sobbed.

“I’m so tired… I’m so tired, please, please, please, just let sleep come…” another begged.

One of them that I connected with didn’t beg or cry, however, it just spoke one word in a choked, desperate tone.

“Run…”

I listened.

My eyes sought the radio tower light, then I took off in that direction. I glanced over my shoulder several times to see the lights of the shelf still dancing along with the king of the abyss, chasing after June with hungry fervor. They were going away from me, and though I was grateful, my heart couldn’t stop pounding.

Because I was angry too.

What was she thinking? She hadn’t known if that was going to work, and on top of that, what was her plan now? It was still barely slower than her, and she was only a few feet away when it missed her.

I hadn’t heard her scream yet, which eased my concerns for the moment. I couldn’t bare the thought of June, the most scared and anxious of us, becoming a tortured tumor on the side of that *thing* for all of eternity.

Maybe she wouldn’t. Maybe if she died, her soul would return to me like it had with Hen 5. Maybe since she was a clone, she couldn’t be absorbed by Il-Belliegħa, and she would be fine.

My attempts to reassure myself didn’t stick long. If the ghost that came out of Hen 5 was anything to go off of, my other selves contained something that approximated to my soul, and if the people attached to that monster were trapped within its folds, then it had to be consuming that part of them as well. If it got June, then there was no doubt in my mind that it would add her to its collection, and I wouldn’t be able to live with that.

My feet slowed to a stop, and I clenched the key in my hand so tightly that it felt like it might break skin.

“Fuck…” I mumbled through a clenched jaw, “Fuck!”

We were so close. So damn close to finally getting out of this place all in one piece, and of course nothing could ever just go our way. We worked our asses off to find a way out, and not once could we be rewarded for our efforts? I was sick of it. I was fed up with one hit after the next, and of course, right when June and I are moments away from escaping to safety, this stupid bastard thing from below has to show up. After all the time it spent wandering around looking for me, it couldn’t have been oblivious just 5 minutes longer?

My anger surged like it always did when I reached my limit, but this time, it was different. It wasn’t impulsive, lashing anger—the kind that I’d hurt Trevor with and the kind that Ann was born from. This was righteous anger. *Justified* anger. Anger that was healthy for someone to feel after putting up with too much shit for months on end.

I wasn’t letting this place win another round against me. I was going to do what Hope would do.

I was going back for June. At least if I went down, so did the key, and Ann by proxy.

I turned back to the lights to see where it lay. The beast was nearing the far edge of the shelf—the place where the 4^(th) rig had been. As I stood and stared, I heard a loud thump ring out from something toppling over, making my heart leap. It had to be June, since Il-Belliegħa was phasing through everything up here. She was still running from it. I had to hurry before she cornered herself with nowhere to run.

Ice formed in my veins as I realized what my plan had been moments ago. To run to the Abyss’s edge and take my chances with the ground below.

Given that she was me, I had a feeling she was planning on doing the same.

I needed to hurry.

I pounded my head with my fists trying to think of what to do, but nothing was coming to me. How on earth was I going to fight a beast so mighty? I had no weapons, and the moment I even got close, I’d be snatched into its hands and clamped between its jaws before I could react.

If I called out and pulled the marionette off of June again, that’d only bring us back to square one, and even worse, I had all the supplies to get us out of here, so I couldn’t die. Besides, June was already so far away now, and I didn’t think I’d have time to reach her before she reached her “destination” anyway.

I needed to be faster and stronger, two things that I just didn’t have in my current condition. The cancer-ridden girl with the broken arm and bum hip wasn’t going to be able to slay the eldritch horror from hell. My confidence was burning down to my fingertips fast as I stood in the road like a stupid deer in headlights, but then thought manifested itself into reality.

I realized as I watched the lights over the rooftops in the distance that it wasn’t the only glow nearby. Aside from the red flare from the radio station, there was something else burning from my right, far down the main road by the motel.

I looked over to see my car that I’d parked by the motel long ago, its high beams shining down the street like a beacon.

I was sprinting toward it before I even had a plan sorted out. It wasn’t made to be a weapon by any means, but used correctly, it could be. It had power, it had speed, and it put me in a similar weight class to my opponent. It was going to have to do.

I nearly ripped the door off its hinges as I yanked the driver’s side open and threw myself into the seat. My hand instinctively reached for the ignition, and I found my key where I’d left it, still turned and idling. I cranked the thing all the way and listened to the ignition startle over and over. I pleaded with it not to die on me, and finally a prayer went answered as the engine growled to life, sounding angry that I’d let it sleep for so long.

Looking at the gas gauge, I saw it was full, and I couldn’t help but laugh at the irony. Il-Belliegħa had given me exactly what I needed.

Layers and instances.

Whether it was like the golf cart below me that had been recharged by the radius of the vending machine anomaly, or if Il-Belliegħa had accidentally breathed new life into it when it ran by, I didn’t care. What mattered was that my car was still chugging, and that was all I needed.

I shifted the thing to drive, then put the pedal to the floor, squealing off down the street toward the road that would lead me to June.

My knuckles were white on the wheel as I was pressed back against the seat, driving at speeds that I’d never traveled in my life. I skidded up onto the sidewalk as I rounded the corner, jostling myself in my seat and hitting my head on the ceiling. It did little to faze me as I cut it back down onto the road, then headed straight for the cliff side.

The town wasn’t hard to cross the span of in a car moving at the speed I was going. I traced Il-Belliegħa’s path across the neighborhood as I went, gunning it down the street so that I could meet him just in time.

Ahead was The Warehouse, its lights now off and the building a shell of what it once looked like before we pulled the plug. Even without them, my high beams cut through the abyss like butter, and I could see everything in front of me like it was daylight.

The whispers scoring the cold air still cautioned and pleaded with me, but I could no longer hear their warnings over the furious roar of my engine. Ahead of me, in the parking lot to the rig, I suddenly saw June enter view and start booking it for the ledge of the shelf. A split second later, I saw the streetlights above begin flickering and morphing as the nightmare close behind caught up.

I once again put the pedal to the floor as I headed after the two, seeing June glance over her shoulder one last time before Il-Belliegħa blocked her from my view with its grotesque form.

As the two sprinted across the lot, something interesting happened to the nearby rig. The edges caught in the creature's aura began to shift away from the sheet metal building into places entirely different. A large forest cabin, a tall office building, a pole barn with chipped red paint. Rigs from ages past—people just like me who never entered inside and found the secrets within. I wondered how many of those instances were needed for Kingfisher to drill this deep. How many innocent lives were killed just to amount to the beast ahead destroying it all.

I hit the curb of the lot and flew over it, my tires leaving the road and slamming down onto the line-painted asphalt once more. I was amazed that I didn’t lose a tire in the process, or that my suspension system was even able to take the blow, but it held, and that was all that mattered.

Seeing the creature in front of me perched right at the edge of the abyss, I had only one plan, and I was only going to get one shot at it.

I released the wheel, then pressed against the horn hard with my shoulder, moving my good hand to the door and popping it open. Kicking my foot into it so that it didn’t swing shut, I held steady as I wedged my other shoe's toe up between the pedal and the bottom of the console.

The new shoes I’d looted from this place had always been loose, so it was easy for me to slip my leg from them, leaving the boot in place, pressing on the gas at full speed.

The scene of the monster nearing the cliff became brighter and brighter the closer I got. Once Il-Belliegħa heard the horn, it turned its lifeless visage around to see what was happening, and beyond him, I could see June at the edge, staring into the pit before her, trying to convince herself of what needed to be done.

Thankfully, she heard the horn too which broke her from the trance, and though I don’t know if she fully realized what she was seeing, she still had enough sense to duck to the side while Il-Belliegħa was distracted.

The beast turned its full body toward me as my steed charged onward, opening its mouth and letting loose a growl as if I were another predator come to steal its prey. My heart thundered fast as its visage grew in my vision, every part of me now screaming that this was an awful idea.

I knew that it was, but with my brain so overloaded, I didn’t care anymore.

My tires hit the sloped curb again, sending the vehicle into the air with me inside.

As soon as the jump hit, I leaned by body toward the door, using the velocity to eject myself through it. Through the chaos of the surrounding noise, I heard the engine continue to scream as the car sailed upward behind me, colliding straight into the beast that was so close I could hear its guttural breath.

It felt like slow motion as I glided through the air, all the details coming to me one by one as I twirled over. A limb came gliding past me, barely missing my coattail, but it wasn’t aiming for me. Il-Belliegħa tried to move its arm to stop the oncoming assault, but the weighty machine was moving fast and wild, causing it to snap the arm back and allow the car to continue its trajectory. It slammed into its face with the sound of splitting wood, and as the airbags in the car deployed, the beast staggered backward.

It fell to the edge of the cliff where it tumbled onto its side, the whispers from its victims screaming and wailing in utter confusion. I had time to feel sorry for them one last time as I hit the grassy knoll just before the cliff's edge, pain making my vision blur as I landed on my bad leg, certainly snapping it for real this time.

Through the tears in my eyes, I watched the back half of my faithful car hit the ground, its tires continuing to squeal and push, until it managed to roll the stunned beast fully off into the abyss.

Trying to suck the wind back into my lungs that had been knocked out of me, I crawled with my hand and remaining leg to the edge of the void, peering over, just to be sure.

One headlight on my car had survived the impact, and in its light I caught glimpses of the beast it was falling with. Il-Belliegħa’s growls thundered back up the cliff side to chomp at my face, and yet despite the anger I now sensed in them, its mask was incapable of making an expression other than smiling indifference.

I watched the two fall and fall until the darkness swallowed them whole, and there was no more sound.

With a heavy, shuddering breath, I rolled onto my back, shutting my eyes for a moment to reboot my swirling thoughts. My body pulsed in pain with each heartbeat, and I was almost used to it until I felt hands grab me and stir it back up.

“Hensley? Hensley, are you alright?”

I sat up without a word and looked her in the June, still too stunned to speak. Giving the abyss one last look, my adrenaline kicked in again, and I struggled to get up. I may have just knocked the beast back where it belonged, but I had heavy doubts it was going to be even slightly effected by the blow, and it would be clawing its way back up for us very soon.

June and I had barely survived, somehow. It was time to get to the door.

My clone helped me up, and after asking one more time if I was alright and getting no answer, she left it be. She knew I was too stunned and in pain to say anything right now.

The walk was agonizingly long and filled with glances over my shoulder. With my leg now fully out of commission, June and I were moving at an all-time slow, even worse than when we had to drag bodies back to this place. I kept hearing phantom whispers in my head, paranoid that maybe Il-Belliegħa had managed to catch itself on the cliff wall, but as I watched the tower light, it never came back on, and when we reached the door, I finally was able to breathe a sigh of relief.

My trembling hands typed the door code wrong several times before finally steadying enough to get it right. I knew that Ann was likely going to hear them opening, so I didn’t bother with the button or trying to warn her we were coming in. It was in our favor that way anyway. It was most likely going to be a fight on the other side of the door, and I was going to be of no real use.

The steel ground open with a might that no other door in this place had so far, a final drum roll for our grand finale. My heart was so tired of pounding by now that I didn’t have it in me to indulge the excitement it was trying to inspire, and once it was clear for us to pass through, we did so, then shut the thing from the other side.

The two of us found ourselves in a colossal dark corridor of concrete and pipes, the tunnel running off to our right and left. We listened over the sound of our panting breath for any movement or signs of life within, but there was nothing returned, so after a beat, I finally broke from my stunned silence and turned to June. She looked at me with watery, fearful eyes, that any other day would have made me feel sympathy for her, but I still couldn’t hold my tongue after what had just happened.

“What… what was that?” I asked, “June, what were you thinking!?”

“W-What?” she stammered innocently.

I turned to her and tried to take a step, thinking that maybe my leg wasn’t in as poor of shape as I thought, but I was quickly proven wrong. The limb kicked out from under me, and I stumbled forward, to which June caught me by the sides of the arms. I gripped her the same way and looked her sternly in the eyes, “Why would you do that, June?”

She looked morbidly confused for a moment, then shook her head, “Y-You’ve done that so many times, and you were hurt! It was my turn to help—”

“Yes, but not with that *thing*! Not when you could have been ripped away from us and a part of that thing forever!”

June’s eyes began to well with tears as I shouted in her face, and she shook her head, “I didn’t want you to get caught either!”

“I-I wouldn’t have!” I stammered out, her sentence making me suddenly realize how hypocritical I was being. “I… I didn’t…”

My words withered and died at the edge of my lips as June began dripping full tears down her cheeks. I felt her trembling scared in my hands, and her teeth were chattering rapidly as her lip trembled. The poor girl was terrified.

I was grateful for what she’d done, and I was being a hypocrite for getting upset about it. I was just worried. I now knew how the others felt when I’d done the same; at least her and Hope. Me yelling wasn’t helping anything, and it certainly wasn’t getting across the idea that I was only worried about her.

June crushed me a little more by softly squeaking out, “I just wanted to be brave like you…”

All of my worried anger fizzled off at that. Any frustration I had toward the girl was snuffed out like a blown wick.

What a thing to say. After just risking your life knowing that potential eternal damnation was on the line, what a silly way of putting it. It was such a kind thing to say. So innocent.

That word resonated with me as I stared at June’s wet, trembling eyes. After all this time trying to figure her out, it finally clicked with me. Innocent. It was the perfect word. The perfect part of my emotions to describe her as.

It all made sense. Her childlike desire to hold hands and be comforted by touch. Her passiveness and conflict avoidance. Her heightened fear of everything that was happening around us, as if she were hoping to wake from a bad dream and call out for our mother. Hell, she even had the same fidgeting habits that I once held when I was a child.

June wasn’t my anxieties… she was my innocence.

But, innocence wasn’t an emotion, was it? It was a state of being. It was something you *are,* not *feel*.

Still holding June’s arms, I began to let the idea wash over me. The idea of this physical person not just being a fragment of who I am, but as something I *was*—at least, at some point in my life.

I didn’t have much innocence left in me. I left it behind along with my car keys at the bar night after night. How could June have come from me *now* if I didn’t have her to begin with?

No; June was like the rigs. Like the vending machines and my car and all the places that Il-Belliegħa could peer into. She was an imprint. Part of me from long ago that I’d abandoned and left alone. Part of me that the roots dredged up and spit at my feet for whatever reason.

Maybe it was because they knew something I didn’t. Maybe after all this time, I needed to see her to remember what I once was.

My eyes suddenly began to mirror June’s, welling with water as my teeth began to chatter. Her face turned to uncertainty, confused at my jump from anger to sudden tears, but she made a small “Oh!” of surprise as I pulled her tight with the only arm I could, and I held her close to me.

She was stiff at first, still scared and probably thinking I’d finally snapped. But once she felt my warmth, she relaxed into my hold. I heard her began to sniffle as her tears broke their dam, and I didn’t hold back as mine followed suit. I wept silently as she began to sob aloud, so to comfort her I squeezed harder and whispered softly.

“I’m sorry, June… I’m so sorry…”

She probably thought I was apologizing for getting riled up a moment ago, but that wasn’t the entirety of it. I was apologizing for much more. Apologizing to the poor little girl I’d neglected for so many years. The one that I’d hushed and forced so deep down I’d forgotten she was even there, much like June half the time Hope, Ann and I were still all together.

She had seemed so worthless at the time, but holding her in that moment, she was the most important thing in the world.

Maybe that’s why she slipped through my fingers. My battle wasn’t over, and I wasn’t meant to be content until I was out of this hell.

As I held her and caressed the back of her neck into my shoulder, I felt something grainy begin to trickle over my hand. In shock, I pulled back slightly, and my throat tightened when I saw black grains of sand flowing like an hourglass. Her vibrant locks were fading to obsidian, and though I shifted my hands to catch her, hoping that I could reverse them and stick them back in place, moving my hand only crumbled away more of her, so I held still.

I began to panic, not wanting to lose June. I couldn’t lose the only friend I had left. Why was this happening? What was this—June was fine, not dying like Hen 5—why was the dust coming for her too?

Still holding her, though, she didn’t struggle in my arms. She didn’t even seem to know what was happening behind her back. In fact, she almost seemed at ease. Her sobbing died down into soft sniffles, and then gentle breathing, like a baby falling asleep.

I didn’t disturb her. I didn’t break her peace. Instead, I just held her as she slowly withered away in my arms.

“It’s gonna be okay, June.” I told her, trying to hide the break in my voice, “We’re going to get out of here, okay?”

“Okay,” She softly murmured, the last word I heard before the rest of her returned to dust, and I stood there holding a glowing, wispy light.

I shut my eyes tight to squeeze the tears free, then wrapped my arms tighter, hoping to still feel something there. My arms passed clean through the light, dispelling it into a haze that surrounded me before I felt my lungs tighten.

I took a deep, labored breath, the light moved into me, then, just like that, June was gone, the only remaining things being the clothes she was wearing in a pile of black sand.
