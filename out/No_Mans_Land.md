When Craig and I needed to get away, we went to a spot we called no man’s land. A big dirt patch just outside of our small town of Birdsview. We would come here to talk and watch the stars as well as the occasional plane or two that would pass every hour or so. No man's land was a sacred place that only me, Craig and a girl or two in town knew of. A place we could visit to rant to one another about life problems, just have a few beers or to just get away and feel a little smaller. Our town of Birdsview was roughly 30 minutes out from Allentown where most of the people in our town worked including us. We were still young, two years out of high school and still couldn’t decide on what we should be doing for the rest of our lives. I still lived with my parents and Craig still lived with his mom. It had just been the two of them ever since his father passed away back when we were in the second grade. So I knew I had to drop whatever I was doing and get the truck ready for no man’s land when Craig had called me and told me his mom had just passed away.

I rushed over to Craig’s place where he was sitting on the curb at the end of his driveway. He got up slowly and climbed into the truck. 

“Are you okay?” I asked.

“I guess so.” he replied in a broken whisper.

The rest of the ride was silent. I drove us to the local liquor store to get us a case of high life, Craig's favorite beer. Craig stayed in the car leaning to face out the window. Looked back a few times to check on him but the chill of the wind that night made me turn my back to the truck. When the bell rang against the door, Bruce walked out from behind the counter to shut the door behind me. He muttered something about the damn door can’t handle the breeze. I went straight to the fridge where they always keep a twelve pack of millers. Bruce, a classmate of ours from highschool made his usual snide comments about what he thought me and Craig would be up to in the back of the truck in the middle of nowhere as he scanned the beer. I'm glad I was the one to get the beer as Craig was not one to take any shit from anyone and especially never put up with Bruce’s jokes. Some small laughs and a rebuttal about what Bruce might be up to when no one else is in the store is always enough to lighten the mood and get him off our backs. Although, I still remember something he said to me that night.

“Yeah, as long as all these damn ghosts will give me some fuckin’ privacy.”

“Them ghosts must be pretty damn bored to come screw around with you in here.” I said jokingly.

Bruce’s smile faded a bit and he leaned forward across the counter. 

“Man listen man, tonights been especially active brother, I'm talkin doors swingin open, crazy noises comin from the ceilin and get this man, my power keeps goin out. But whenever I get up to go check it… it all comes alive again.”

I leaned in close from the other side of the counter.
“You better quit testing out your product Bruce” I muttered.

He raised an almost finished fifth of Jim Beam Red Stag and said, “Don't you go tellin boss man now.” before erupting in a laugh you could hear from the back of the beer freezer. He told me to have a goodnight as I walked out and I told him “Don’t work too hard now.” which got an even louder laugh than the last one. As I walked back to the truck, Craig was in the same position I left him in until he perked his head up looking past me and into the store. Halfway between the truck and the store I turned around to see not a single light on in the entire place. Like it had never even been open to begin with. Bruce walked out from the dark to forcefully close the door against the wind. As soon as he managed to get it shut, the store had suddenly come back to life, illuminating the truck, Craig and I as well as Bruce’s trans am as the only things in the parking lot. Bruce looked at us, smiled, shrugged and gave a wave to me and Craig before turning back into the store and returning to his post. I heard one last muffled laugh as I loaded the beers into the truck and left.

Still about 20 minutes from the spot Craig decided to tell me what had happened. At 7am that morning his mom had left for her job as a nurse at the hospital in the city. When she arrived at work, she had parked in the garage next to the building when what police believe was a younger man approached her. At around 7:50 her car was seen leaving the parking garage which is the last they had seen of the vehicle. Shortly after, the police were called about a woman on the ground bleeding. Police and paramedics arrived to see the woman had died from 7 deep stabs into her back just below her neck. 

Craig had spent the entire day with police being questioned and waiting in the station. Craig being at home sleeping that morning apparently was not a good enough alibi for the police. He said he had only been home for about 15 minutes before he called me. He couldn’t handle being at his mother’s house after over 10 hours of questions about her. I did my best to console my best friend and to my relief, he acknowledged that he doesn’t expect a professional therapy session from me. He just needed to get away. To feel a little smaller.

We made it to our spot around 10 that night and got ourselves posted up in the bed of the truck. I had put in a row of seats from a smaller car to fit in the bed of my truck for nights at no man’s land. It was a fun project that me and Craig had done just a few weeks back and was well worth the effort. We sat and did our best to talk over the wind while we drank our beers. To an extent, my mind was at least taken off of the subject. Craig however, would end our riffing a little sooner than usual and begin to fall quiet. When I ran out of old memories to bring up I remembered something I had bought that I thought he would like. I jumped down from the truck and rushed to the center console. As I climbed back in, I tossed him a laser pointer. 

“What is this?”

“Bought it at the liquor store. Try it out, see how far it goes.” I said

He pointed it in front of us and hit the button. It shot out a green laser as far as we could see. We then heard a low droning noise. We assumed it might just be another car or a big rig somewhere but we couldn’t see any lights around us. We paid no mind to it and continued pointing the laser into the void darkness all around us. We watched the strong gusts of wind carry the dirt and define the laser’s beam as far out as we could make it. I was trying to hit a stop sign I had made out about a quarter mile to the left of us when Craig said, “I wish there were some stars out tonight. Or maybe even a plane.” Still focused on my task at hand, I said without looking up to him, “I think that’s illegal dude”

“Well shining it at the stars isn’t. Let me see it real quick.”

I kept my eyes locked on the spot where I thought the sign was as I surrendered the pointer to him. I figured he would realize he wouldn’t be able to hit anything in space from the back of my truck so I didn’t bother to look and waited for him to hand it back over. A bright green line not 20 feet in front of me broke my stone solid state. It made me jolt back a bit. I laughed and turned to Craig only to see him fixed on the same diagonal beam coming down from the sky that I had seen roughly 20 feet from the truck. The strange thing however, was that Craig was still shining the laser directly up into the sky.

“Are you hitting a plane or something?” I asked.

He didn’t say anything. We stared at the pastel green cloud the beam was shining through, trying to see past the cloud. Both of us jumped at the deep droning noise that had come back, breaking our deep focus. The wind had picked up at the same time. The second laser whipped in front of us but with everything happening, Craig had kept our laser pointed directly up. He decided to try turning it on and off a bunch keeping it in the same general direction and when he did, the second laser was doing the same but would hit the ground in different spots all around us. The wind was really moving now, so fast and harsh we could barely hear one another but we had both known what was happening. The laser had been reflecting off of something.

The light green cloud above us suddenly began to grow a dark red at which point we rushed to get off the truck and take off. We were pushed down into the bed of the truck by the violent wind. On the floor of the bed, we both looked up to see the clouds split, revealing an incredible metal structure. It was smooth and dark, rounded on the bottom and emitting a deep red light directly from what we thought was the center of this thing. The wind was at its strongest, we felt helpless and soon to be weightless. 

Before we could comprehend what was happening to us, we were lifted out of the truck bed, slowly moving towards the light. The wind had pushed us into two spinning tunnels of air apart from one another. I could see Craig screaming to me but the droning had only gotten louder and the wind tunnel hadn’t helped my hearing either. I froze, all I could do was watch Craig do anything he could to get out. He took a knife from his pocket and opened it. I saw him look directly up and yell something before throwing it the best he could directly up along with his keys and wallet and whatever else he could find on him. It seemed to shake up the machine because the wind that had been lifting us, shuttered a bit with each item that went up. It had soon stopped, at this point we were roughly 30 feet off the ground, frozen in the air. 

A thick cloud of vapor had released onto Craig and his screaming had fallen silent. He was still moving and fighting but whatever the substance was had begun to sedate him. In one last effort to fight back he took a lighter from his pocket. I recognized it, a gift from his dad that Craig had always kept with him to remember him. And with whatever strength he had left, he flipped it open and scratched a puny spark from the lighter. Within seconds, the gas had lit into a bright yellow, orange crimson that lit up the night sky like nothing I had ever seen. 

The flame spiralled up the tunnel of wind catching every trace of the gas and transforming it into a terrifying inferno. Through the blaze, I could just make out the silhouette of my best friend’s skin dripping to the ground like a candle’s wax. The flame eventually made its way to the machine to reveal the things, our captors, our abductors. They were not human. Too tall, too long, and just watching what was, just seconds ago, Craig. Like nothing had even happened. In so much shock I had not realized the wind had picked back up and I was on my way back up. They had released the same sour vapor into my tunnel and all I could do was comply. There was nothing I could possibly do but accept that I had no more control. I felt so vulnerable. So helpless. So small. 

What happened next, I can only describe as dreamlike. Just parts of memories but whenever i try to recount it to myself it feels like im telling it wrong. I opened my blurry eyes to find myself in what looked like a hospital room. But I knew that it wasn’t, everything was off. Two tv’s in each corner, a door that looked like it belonged in a bedroom, and I had been covered in towels not blankets. The one detail I know I can remember is moving the towels down to reveal a scar running vertically in the center of my body from my neck through my belly button. That’s all I had cared to see or feel. 

The doorknob had begun shaking so I flung myself back into the bed and shut my eyes just barely peeking out. Enormous figures walked in, I assume the same ones I saw watching Craig. There were a few of them and one had noticed my eyes. It signalled to the others. They walked over slowly and just touched my eyelids. I couldn’t get them back open. The next thing i can recall is waking again but in another room the same kind of set up as the last one. Random things that someone might recall being in an operating room. I woke to see more scars all over my body. My vision was still blurry but I could feel them all over. 

As my vision cleared I noticed one of the things in the corner of the room. I looked next to the bed to find a tray of scalpels that didn't look right, like if you had told me to draw one it might’ve looked like this. I grabbed it and tried to stand, tripping over myself, i knew I was being too loud, I knew that the thing had heard me but i didn't care. I stumbled my way to the thing and threw myself onto it. In a blind rage I uncontrollably hit the creature and used the tool I had picked up. In an instant my vision had cleared. I looked around to see where I was. I turned my head to find Craig’s mother’s car. In an empty parking garage. And underneath me, with 7 deep cuts in their back, was Craig’s mother.

 I shot up and panicked. I couldn’t comprehend anything at the speed in which it was happening. The pool of blood spread and I could hear sirens in the distance. I instinctively got into her car and drove out of the garage as fast as I could. I cried and yelled for as long as I could remember. In my screaming fit I had closed my eyes and laid my foot on the gas just to open them again and find myself back in my own truck. I drove the entire night until I physically couldn't anymore. I found another barron patch of land where I could sleep in my truck for the night.

I write this now some months later as an apology. For Craig's mother. For my own parents who I know are worried sick about where I've been. For Craig, my best friend. I could not even begin to explain how I feel. I have expressed all my guilt and sadness, I feel void of emotion. I’ve felt this way for weeks. 

Until yesterday, when I felt the breeze. Smelled the sour wind. I know what I have to do. It’s what Craig would’ve done for me. I am as prepared as I think I could be with a few knives, a firearm, a laser pointer and a lighter. Craig’s lighter that I just found in that dirt patch that we loved, that dirt patch I could never forget, that little dirt patch that we called no man’s land.
