My story – as unbelievable as it sounds – started earlier this summer. I was on a gig when, during set break, I was approached by a voluptuous woman wearing high-heeled boots and a stunning silk dress. She had luscious red hair, a radiant smile, and perfect breasts. Immediately, I was smitten.

She asked if I knew a song – I can’t remember the title. I said no, and told her I’d learn it during my set break. She smiled, flicked her flaming hair, and said don’t bother; the song isn’t available on any platforms. I didn’t want her to leave, so I offered to play her something special, which I did: Foxy Lady, by Jimi Hendrix. She seemed mildly impressed, at best. It was getting late, I remember, and the dive bar was thinning out.

Looking back, I should’ve been suspicious: what’s a gorgeous gal doing in a seedy dive bar anyhow. And why is she talking to me? I’m nothing special. But I was enamored. You see, the town I live in isn’t known for beautiful people. No, the town I live in is known for gangs, mafias, hard drugs and homelessness. Get the picture?
During set break, she asked if I smoked, and I chose that exact moment to start up again. Yeah, I’m weak, but hear me out: I’d recently gone through a brutal divorce (are there any other kinds?). I'd lost my day job, and I was lonely. The Perfect Sucker, that’s me.

I followed her outside; she reached into her purse, and produced a gold zippo lighter. A flame the size of a large balloon erupted, nearly singeing my bangs. We smoked and chatted. Mostly, I kept quiet; she had a lot to say. She told me her boss was looking for a pianist to perform regularly in his nightclub: Tuesday to Saturday, from 6 – 9 PM. A good gig. I handed her a business card and asked (more like begged) her to give it to him.

She did. And my life has been in danger ever since.

The nightclub was called Inferno. Never heard of it. And for good reason: it was in the basement of an abandoned building in the East End. Not a good location. There was no sign, and zero indication it was even there. Initially, I thought she’d played a mean and malicious prank on me. But then I noticed a small staircase leading to the basement. Reluctantly, I ventured downstairs. Greeting me at the bottom of the dingy dwelling was a large red door with a strange symbol on it. 

If I could go back in time, I would’ve turned around and drove home as quickly as possible.

The barroom was large and squared: it boasted a finely-stocked bar, crimson table clothes, and marble floors. The room was dimly lit, and a haze hovered over the tables, like cigarette smoke or incense. The dining area, which held about one hundred people, maybe more, was sparsely filled. No big screen TV’s or background music. The bartender saw me, and nodded. He was as tall as a tower, and wore a red tuxedo. 

In the middle of the barroom was a grand piano. It looked expensive. Not knowing what else to do, I shuffled nervously towards it. I was sweating. The place was boiling hot. And no wonder: the fireplace was roaring. A tuxedo-clad server approached: his skin was pale; he had shoulder-length charcoal hair, a thick goatee, and bloodshot eyes. He asked if I needed anything.

“Water,” I said, in a throaty voice. Already, I was parched, and I hadn’t started singing yet. Not a good sign. The server returned with a pitcher of murky water and a filthy glass. Then he spoke in a language I’d never heard of, chuckling to himself, as if he’d said the funniest joke ever. He doddered off and served another table. A table of monsters.

I stood transfixed. A horde of monsters were staring at me, with eyes that were too large for their sickly faces. I must’ve been gawking, because someone – a lumberjack with hands like footballs and hair as white as cotton – shouted, “Ya gonna play that thing, or what?”

Monsters murmured. Something in the kitchen clanked. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. Monsters aren’t real, I told myself. I can’t recall ever being so scared. Shakily, I tested the microphone; the volume was okay, which was good, because I couldn’t find the PA. Everything, it seemed, was perfect, so I sat on the piano bench and let my hands do their thing. 

I opened my set with a jazzy instrumental version of Smells Like Teen Spirit: a crowd favorite. Half way through the song, I saw something I’ll never forget, no matter how hard I try. 

The redhead appeared out of thin air: she wore a black velvet dress, her hair teased sexily, and lips like cherries. She started dancing with a large man. This man – and I use this term loosely – was seven-feet tall. At least. His arms were dump trucks, his head gleaming like a bowling ball. His skin was like rawhide. His pinstriped suit seemed to change colors, going from black to red, blue to orange. 

Still, I soldiered on, and finished the song. This town gets weirder and weirder, I remember thinking. Next, I played Crocodile Rock by Elton John. That seemed to settle the monsters.

The set went by like a whirlwind. By the final song, Bullet with Butterfly Wings, the room got rowdy. A schooner of beer whizzed past my head. A tomato splatted across the piano, ruining my shirt. A four-hundred-pound woman wearing a skin-tight, see-through onesie, started pounding on the table. Her friend – a pixie, as far as I could tell – started chirping, “Play something you know!” 

The room erupted.

I’d been heckled before, so this was nothing new. But never by a gang of well-groomed ghouls. After the final note, I sprang from my seat and headed for the restroom, but I couldn’t find it, so I went to the bar, grabbed a napkin and wiped my shirt. I asked the towering bartender where the restrooms were. He looked puzzled. He licked a blob of blood from his well-chiselled chin, and asked me to repeat myself.

“Restroom,” I said, hating the sound of my trembling voice. I had to crane my head to speak to him.

The bartender, who looked like Dracula, only way taller, shrugged. “I have just what you need,” he said, in an unfriendly voice two octaves deeper than my own.
I watched in horror as he fixed me a drink that looked like blood. When he dropped a straw into the glass, I nearly fainted. The straw looked like a hollowed out human finger. When he handed it to me, I repeated my question, but he ignored me. I was at a loss. I really had to go.

The redhead!

I searched the barroom, looking for her; I hadn’t even learned her name yet. By now, the nightclub was at full capacity. All monsters as far as I could tell. I should’ve dashed for the door and fled. But I stayed. It’s funny how your mind plays tricks on you. Reality is like a pretzel, bending and twisting in all directions. Clearly, I was in danger, yet all I could think about was relieving my bowels. A cold hand touched my shoulder, and I screamed. 

Everyone turned and stared.

“Hank!” the redhead said, louder than I thought necessary. “Great set!” 
She licked her ruby lips, and handed me an envelope stuffed with cash. “The boss digs what you’re doing up there,” she said. 

Her eyes were dark and mysterious; a splattering of freckles was sprinkled across her slight and slender nose. Damn, she was gorgeous. Before I could ask for her name, or where the restrooms were, she turned and walked away. A gang of motley-looking men, as large as stadiums, greeted her with open arms.

I sipped my drink and gagged. It was spicy to the point of torture, but I didn’t dare waste it, so I took a tentative sip, burning my lips in the process. I had time to kill before my second and final set. I used it to casually stroll the nightclub in search of a restroom. Taxidermied heads lined the bloodstained walls: human heads. And they weren’t smiling. I gulped. One of them I knew: his name was Mathew something-or-other. I didn’t know him well. He was a colleague of mine, a guitarist.

In the corner, next to a classic KISS pinball machine, was a spittoon. It stank. Next to it, made of rickety metal as old as the wild west, was pissing trough. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Next thing I know, a four-foot hobbit with a five-foot you-know-what pulled up next to me, and started urinating.

At least I’d found the restroom.

The hobbit farted, and I nearly died. Suddenly, I didn’t need to use the restroom. What kind of nightclub is this? I found my phone and started scrolling, but the Wi-Fi was lousy, so  I put it away. I was at a total loss. 

The patrons grew rowdy, demanding more music. A troll, wearing filthy overalls, and nothing else, waved an axe. The axe was as big as a barn. He was staring at me with an expression of curious loathing. Trembling, I trampled past the troll and seated myself in front of the piano. At least there, I was safe.

My hands worked automatically, and before I knew it, I’d launched into Monster Mash. It was a graveyard smash. In fact, they knew all the words. Under normal circumstances, this would’ve amused me. It didn’t. They sang way off key, sounding like a choir of chaos, and danced like lunatics. 

Next, I played Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden. They hated it. I don’t recall what came next, only that I sang like my life depended on it. Next thing I know, the place cleared out, and my set was over. 

By now, I’m a pool of sweat. Stupid fireplace. The redhead approached with her giant friend, whom I presumed was the boss. He reached out and shook my hand, nearly crushing it.

“Well done, Hank,” he said. 

He looked and spoke like a super villain; his accent was peculiar, but I had no intention of asking where he’s from. 

“I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said, and handed me a long list of songs to learn. None of which I’d recognized. 

Before I could ask anything, he promptly whisked me towards the exit. I couldn’t leave soon enough. As I was leaving, he tapped my shoulder, and said, “I wouldn’t tell anyone about this place, if I were you.” 

His eyes, like slitted black swirls, dug deep into mine. His face changed: suddenly, he was a dragon. He spewed fire above my head, nearly burning me to a crisp. I hit the ground, and blew out my kneecap. I couldn’t believe any of this.  

There’s zero chance in hell I was returning. No friggin’ way. The redhead grabbed me and dragged me to my feet – her strength was extraordinary. Then she pulled me close and kissed my cheek. Her cherry lips touched my ear, and I melted.

“The last guy who didn’t show up,” she said softly, her warm tongue tickling my lobes, “is right over there.”

I looked up, and gasped. Above the exit, was a severed head. I swear it wasn’t there a second ago. She winked and blew me a kiss. 

“See ya tomorrow, [Hank.”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
