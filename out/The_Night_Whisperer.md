They always told us the woods were dangerous after dark, but no one ever explained why. When I was young, the adults whispered about "the Night Whisperer," a creature that roamed the dense forest outside our town. I used to think it was just a story to keep us out of the woods. Now I know better.

Last weekend, I decided to take a solo camping trip to clear my head. Work had been stressful, and I craved the silence only the wilderness could provide. I picked a spot deep in the woods, far from the usual campsites. The air was crisp, the sky clear, and the first night passed without incident. The second night, however, was when everything went wrong.

It started with a whisper.

At first, I thought it was the wind rustling through the trees. But the sound wasn’t coming from above; it was low, almost at ground level, slithering through the ferns and bushes. I strained to hear it, but it was faint, just barely louder than the crackling of my campfire. It was saying something, though I couldn’t make out the words.

“Hello?” I called out, but only silence answered.

Then I heard it again. Closer this time. A distinct whisper, my name drawn out in a long, chilling breath.

“Jaaaack…”

My blood ran cold. I stood up, scanning the dark treeline around my camp. The firelight didn’t reach far, and beyond it, the night was impenetrable. I grabbed my flashlight and pointed it towards the direction of the voice. The beam sliced through the darkness, illuminating nothing but trees and underbrush.

I told myself it was just my imagination, or maybe some pranksters trying to scare me. But when I turned back towards the fire, the whispering started again, now from the opposite direction.

“Jaaaack…”

The sound was closer, more insistent. My heart pounded in my chest. I swung the flashlight around wildly, but all I saw were the trees and shadows. That’s when I noticed something—one of the shadows was moving.

It was subtle, just a slight shift against the trunk of a tree. But as I watched, it detached itself from the tree and started to move towards me. The shadow grew larger, taking form, and I realized with growing terror that it wasn’t a shadow at all.

It was a creature.

Tall and gaunt, its limbs were unnaturally long, with fingers that ended in sharp, claw-like tips. Its skin was dark and mottled, blending into the surrounding forest. But its eyes—those were the worst. They glowed with a faint, sickly yellow light, like embers buried deep in ash.

“Jaaaack…”

The whisper was coming from it, though its mouth never moved. Instead, the words seemed to pour out of the darkness itself, a cold, dead breath that wrapped around me.

I ran.

The forest blurred around me as I sprinted through the trees, branches tearing at my clothes, roots trying to trip me. The whispering followed, growing louder, more urgent.

“Jaaaack… don’t leave…”

It was everywhere, surrounding me, closing in. No matter how fast I ran, the creature was always just behind me, its long limbs brushing the ground as it moved, as if it was gliding. I didn’t dare look back, but I could feel it getting closer, the chill of its presence crawling up my spine.

Then, just when I thought I couldn’t run any longer, I burst into a clearing. The moonlight flooded the open space, and for a brief moment, the whispering stopped. I bent over, gasping for breath, my lungs burning. But when I looked up, I saw something that made my heart drop into my stomach.

The clearing was littered with bones. Human bones.

Some were old, bleached white by time, while others were fresher, still clothed in tatters of fabric. I recognized one of the jackets—it belonged to a guy who went missing a few months ago, a fellow hiker who never returned.

Before I could process what I was seeing, the whisper started again, louder than ever.

“Stay with us, Jack…”

It wasn’t just one voice now, but many, all blending together in a horrific chorus. And they were all coming from the woods around me. The creature stepped into the clearing, its eyes burning bright, and I knew then that there was no escape.

I turned to run again, but I felt something cold and slimy wrap around my ankle. I screamed as I was yanked to the ground, my face hitting the dirt. I clawed at the earth, trying to pull myself away, but it was no use. The thing dragged me backwards, towards the edge of the clearing.

“Join us, Jack…”

The last thing I saw before the darkness swallowed me was the creature’s face, a twisted parody of a human smile, teeth sharp and stained, eyes glowing with malevolent hunger. And then the world went black.

They’ll say I got lost in the woods, that I was just another unfortunate hiker who strayed too far. But if you hear whispering in the night, if you feel eyes watching you from the shadows, remember this: the Night Whisperer is real, and it’s always hungry.

Whatever you do, don’t listen. Don’t follow the whispers.

And above all, never go into the woods alone.
