Last night a friend of mine had said the phrase when you die pray to God that your body doesn't move I didn't understand it at first but I know why now. 

His name was Carter Carter and I go way back his father used to be a worker for the local morgue. 

His father was working for the local police department they found a victim of a recent murder I can't tell you the full story because it's redacted but I can tell you it was gruesome at the time that was the first in a long time.

Carter and I wanted to go to a camping trip well his father was trying to help solve a murder so we planned to go to a old campground the campground was originally owned by my uncle me and Carter would always love to go camping here until something bad happened. 

When we were in elementary Carter and I went on a field trip to this place back in the day it was beautiful you could go anywhere in the campground the owners didn't really mind especially my uncle that is until something did happen there was a hanging that was performed by a cult and one of the people hanging from the tree was our classmate Susie after that happened there was no more field trips in or around that campground.

We drive up to the campground it's old and decrepit the only memory this campground has ever had was the murder of Susie the years on campground has been hard no campers since the murder.

We set up our camping tent my uncle comes around the corner to help and have a good old chat.

Uncle Stewart how are you nephew. 

Samuel I'm good been a long time uncle. 

Uncle Stewart that's good this is the last time that the campground will be closing down soon this will be the last year it will ever be open it's because of the murder of Susie. 

Samuel ah that's sad I always love this place I always come to this place for peace and quiet I guess I will have to find a new campground to go to. 

The nights are dark cold and windy it's hard to keep the tent nailed down when every second the wind picks up but we manage we have fun the last day we decide to go fishing well on that fishing trip Carl gets a call from his dad he is worried as all hell. 

Stephen son the legend is coming true.

Carter what legend 

Stephen the legend that my grandpappy told me it it is coming true.

Carter oh shit you mean that legend. 

 Stephen yes son that legend.

 the phone apartmently hangs up Carter starts to worry I asked him what's up he says the legend of this city has came true I asked him what legend he says the legend of the undead coming back alive they are damned souls stuck on Earth. 

I start worrying because I thought that was only a legend an urban legend to be exact. 

We begin to rush and pack up our tent we begin to drive back to our city we pass a stop sign we're over the speed limit we see our fellow neighbors with white or non-existent eyes smiling from ear to ear. 

We Begin the drive to the morgue to see if Carter's father is still alive half an hour goes by we get to the morgue we see bodies that are dead that are not supposed to be moving reanimated. In spite Carter starts looking for weapons or tools to dispatch the undead. We start to see our fellow neighbors and classmates  start looking for us.

 We are bunkered down in the morgue.

I start up a conversation with the other survivors or what's left of them I say this is interesting summer vacation hopefully the next year of our school year doesn't start like this people start laughing because there's nothing else to do. 

We have to wait until something hits the news unless there's no one at the local news department that means we are all screwed why did this have to happen on summer break why couldn't it just happen when we were supposed to be at school. 

If anyone can get this anyone at all if there is survivors come and save us we don't know if it was experiment that made our neighbors and classmates go crazy all we know is we need help.
