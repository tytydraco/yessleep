It was 1 AM when I heard something moving in the hallway. It wasn’t just footsteps—it was fast, erratic, like something scurrying back and forth in confusion or excitement. Then came the banging. Over and over again, loud and desperate, directly on my bedroom door. And then... a voice. Her voice.

“Please—open the door… help me.”

I froze. My chest tightened. Something was wrong. My wife doesn’t live in this house anymore.

Panicking, I grabbed the axe I keep beside my bed and yanked the door open with a surge of fear and adrenaline. But there was nothing—no one there. Just the sound of laughter fading down the hallway. Her laughter. That damned laugh... mocking me, drifting away, deeper into the house.

I ran after it barefoot, the cold floor biting at my feet, my knuckles white from gripping the axe. Each step echoed like a warning. As I passed the portraits on the wall, I noticed something awful: their smiles started to stretch unnaturally, twisting into grotesque expressions like they were all laughing at me too.

When I reached the bathroom, I saw it. In that moment, it all came crashing down. I understood everything. I should have listened when Mari begged me to throw away that clown doll. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. It was a gift, something I got at the exit of a traveling circus. I had taken my niece that day—sunlight, music, laughter everywhere. A man gave me the doll as we left. Said it would bring luck, prosperity... and something else I didn’t quite catch in the noise.

The doll was carved from wood, with painted cheeks and a little pointed hat. It seemed harmless enough. For some reason, I thought Mari would appreciate it. But when I showed it to her, she froze. Her smile vanished and she wouldn’t even look at it. All she said was, “Keep it away from me.”

So I left it in the hallway, on an old armchair. That night... that damned night... a loud thud woke us up. Mari was pale, trembling. She said something had pulled her out of bed. I didn’t believe her—not really. But after that, nothing was normal again.

The next night, we heard footsteps. Slow. Uneven. Like something dragging one leg down the hallway. I got up, checked. The doll was gone. Mari screamed—from the kitchen. I ran. The biggest knife from the drawer was on the floor, and she was standing there, shaking. No one else was around. Just her… and the silence. That awful, heavy silence that made me feel like something was watching us.

She tried to explain, but I couldn’t stop staring at that knife. It felt... familiar. Too familiar. We didn’t sleep that night. I sat on the edge of the bed, staring into the dark while Mari cried quietly beside me. I didn’t know if she was crying out of fear, or because she was still there with me.

The next day, everything fell apart. She had bruises. She told me I had gotten up during the night, talked to the mirror, laughed in a voice that wasn’t mine. I told her I didn’t remember any of it. And maybe that was true. Or maybe I just didn’t want to face it.

I began to forget things—what we’d eaten, what we’d talked about, entire hours of the day. But in every blank spot… the doll was there. Sometimes sitting where I hadn’t left it. Sometimes just gone. And then one day, Mari gave me her journal. She had written things I couldn’t ignore:

**“It’s not him.”**  
**“He whispers to the doll when he thinks I’m asleep.”**  
**“He locked me in the bedroom and doesn’t remember.”**  
**“He doesn’t look at me like before.”**

I didn’t know what to say. I just stared at her. And then she said the words that broke me: “I can’t do this anymore… I want a divorce.”

Time passed. The house went quiet. But it wasn’t peace. It was a kind of silence that felt alive. Like something crawling inside me.

Then one night, the phone rang. I ran to answer it, hoping it was her. And it was—or at least it sounded like her. We spoke for hours. I cried. I apologized. I told her everything. I poured myself into that call. But then... a loud snap.

I woke up. I was standing in the hallway, phone in hand. The cord had been cut.

There had never been a call. Just me. Alone. Breathing in the dark.

That was it. I had to end this.

I marched down the hallway toward the chair, ready to destroy that cursed doll. But the door wouldn’t open. Something was holding it shut from the other side. Then I heard her again. Her voice, pleading, crying, calling my name.

No. Not again.

I kicked the door. Something kicked back. And then it laughed. That same awful laugh—too human to be a toy, too wrong to be a person. It ran down the hallway, taunting me. I chased it, into the bathroom. And then... everything went black.

When I came to, I was on the floor. I pulled myself up by the sink and looked into the mirror.

And smiled.

In that moment, I understood. There was no clown. There never had been.

**I** was the clown.

I was the one who didn’t want the divorce. I was the one who had done terrible things. Me. Or something inside me.

I started laughing. And I kept laughing until I cried.

As my smile grew wider in the mirror, I reached down, picked up the biggest knife I could find, and walked toward the door.

The night was perfect.

The show… must go on.
