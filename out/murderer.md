Recently my family was murdered i was away with a friend. When it happened it was a gloomy night and i spent a long time walking i thought "why the hell did i refuse to be driven home" as i walked up the steps to my house and i went to turn the door handle but it just pushed open.

 I went and felt for the light switch it felt wet with something i thought it was weird but shrugged it off and then found the switch and really wished i went and flicked the switch to turn on the light and went pale. There was so much blood up the walls, the floor, the couch, desk, carpet tv everywhere i was in shock i felt sick my world just came down in one moment, the tears wouldn't stop flowing i knew i had to call the police and who ever did this could still be in here i thought my mind started racing thoughts flew through my head i couldn't stop shaking or crying and as i called the police i don't even know how the operator knew what i was saying.

 they said they were on the way they said 10 minutes but it felt like years i was sitting in the cold waiting for them to arrive but i couldn't feel the cold, tears streaming down my face, soon i heard the sirens and the police pulled in, then they told me to go to a friends house while they searched so i did.

 i checked every day for any update but they found nothing my house wasn't big just a one story but they looked for 2 months for anything but gave up even thought it was a small house nothing!?! i was so angry at the police and the murderer how could he get away Scott free and why did the police give up i never forgave them for that but the only good thing was i got to spend time with my best friend jack.

 He was tall, blonde, with blue eyes, small ears and a grin that he never really took off also he was slightly built and was pretty athletic. He was 20 so was i. we went everywhere together the movies, golfing swimming, watched tv, played games went to the bar you name it we went everywhere.

 also his parents where so kind to me they let me stay after i thought they would kick me out but they didn't and also asked if i was ok every day it was very nice of them i said i was fine.

 At an earlier time i wanted to end it all because there was much pain but my family wouldn't want that so i forgot about that and everything that upset me.

Then after playing games with jack all day till dark i went to go to sleep, i was just about to go to sleep after watching youtube on my phone but i heard footsteps and stuff opening and closing, know this was the first time this happened but i just thought "ah it is just jack or his parents getting a drink" but i felt the need to lock the door so i did latter i heard the handle moving around
