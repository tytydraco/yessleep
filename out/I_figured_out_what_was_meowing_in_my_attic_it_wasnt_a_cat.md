This is an update for my earlier post, I found out what was making the noise and, fuck I don't know if I'm going crazy or...I honestly don't know what I just saw. But I'll do my best to describe it. I'm writing from my basement because there's no vents down here and I think that's how it's been getting around. So after I made my first post the meowing just kept getting louder and it started to sound like it was coming from right under my couch. I had enough and I threw my couch on its back and as soon as I did the cries finally stopped, but there was nothing there aside from the vent next to my wall. I finally sucked it up and decided to go back into my attic and find this damn thing. I grabbed my old baseball bat and climbed up there again. Just like last time I didn't see anything but boxes and all the foot prints. I moved every single box out from where they lay and couldn't find anything.

Still thoroughly freaked out I decided to get the hell out of there and just bar my attic hatch shut for the night. When I was about to climb down the ladder though I spotted a line of closely packed footprints and something just seemed odd about them. I bent down to take a closer look and realized that whatever had made these definitely was not a fucking cat. Cats have the one big pad at the bottom and five small ones surrounding it right? This was two big pads side by side with two little dots above them. 

I just stood there trying to figure out what the hell could have made these when I started to hear it again.

"Meooowwwwwwww" but this time it was coming from the main floor down the hall from what sounded like the kitchen. A chill ran up my spine and I just froze up. I didn't think I'd be one of those people that would freeze up in scary situations but I did, but then I heard a yelp from one of my dogs and I flew off that ladder so fast I ended up spraining my ankle. I didn't care though, I limped as fast as I could over to the kitchen doorway and when I got there I just stood in shock. I'm gonna do my best to recall what happened but it was kind of a blur so just bare with me. The first thing I saw was my dog, floating in the middle of the room. Then as though I was staring at a marriage, y'know like you see something in waves of heat? This long white, pole came into view and it was holding my dog, several of these bone white poles were caressing my dog. Then slowing the rest of the thing came waving into my vision. Dozens of long spindly legs planted on the ceiling connected to a round white body white little hairs covering it. It also had these big fangs that were sunk into my dogs side. It removed my dog from its fangs and started at me with six shiny black marbIe eyes and let out a low drawn out "Meoooooowwwww"

I lost it, I was so terrified I couldn't even scream I just snagged my other dog and ran towards the basement locking it behind me. I've been down here for 3 hours now and all I can hear is that God damn meowing. I tried calling the cops but my cell service isn't working down here. I don't know if this will even upload but I have to tell someone. If you get this I need help.
