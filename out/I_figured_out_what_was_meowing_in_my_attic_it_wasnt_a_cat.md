Hi, I'm a 30 year old male and I live in Boulder Colorado by myself. I just moved into my first home about 2 months ago and everything has been super great so far and I really haven't noticed anything else going on before this.
It started about an hour ago now, I heard a cat meowing when I was sitting in my living room watching TV, not a regular meowing though. The kind cats make when they're stuck somewhere you know? Anyways, I thought I was just hearing things at first because every time I paused my show to listen closer I wouldn't hear anything. At first I thought it was just coming from my show but then it started to get louder. It got so loud I thought for sure it was coming from my attic. I paused my show again and I finally heard it 

"Meoowww meoowww" 

Only twice and then it stopped again. I decided to walk over to my attic entrance and see if somehow a cat made its way up there and got stuck up in there y'know? I didn't want the poor thing to starve to death or anything. When I popped open the cover and peaked in with my phone light I didn't see anything, just dust covered boxes as usual. No footprints, nothin'. So I shut the door and went to go finish my show, but on my way back to the couch that's when I heard it again.

"Meooooooowww" longer and a bit more distressed this time. I started to walk back to the attic entrance and that's when I noticed something odd. See I have two dogs, both hound dogs so whenever there's any kind of squirrel or cat or anything like that they go crazy, ears parked up, sniffing around, you know typical dog stuff. However the two of em when just laying in their beds, totally unbothered. I thought at first maybe they didn't hear it? But I know that's not true cause if I could they definitely could. It was odd but I didn't think much of it after that, maybe they didn't care? I don't know. I went to go check again, but this time when I peaked in, and I'm not exaggerating, HUNDREDS of footprints in the dust. They were everywhere, the floor, the boxes...the windows and the ceiling. I slammed the door shut and backed off the door as an eruption of cats crying and meowing came from just behind it. This went on for what felt like forever but was probably only about two minutes.  

Once it stopped I was too afraid to open the hatch again, this overwhelming sense of dread overcame me  as I stood there staring at the hatch. I finally broke contact with the hatch and bolted back through my living room into my bedroom and grabbed the bat a kept next to my bed. At this point the cries started back up again, but this time it seemed like they were coming from my kitchen wall. my dogs still don't seem to notice anything they just keep looking at me concerned and the meowing is just getting louder. Then the cries continued to traced along my living room entrance and down to the floor, the noise finally came to a rest under  my couch. I had enough and I threw my couch on its back and as soon as I did the cries finally stopped, but there was nothing there aside from the vent next to my wall. I finally sucked it up and decided to go back into my attic and find this damn thing. I grabbed my old baseball bat and climbed up there again. Just like last time I didn't see anything but boxes and all the foot prints. I moved every single box out from where they lay and couldn't find anything.

Still thoroughly freaked out I decided to get the hell out of there and just bar my attic hatch shut for the night. When I was about to climb down the ladder though I spotted a line of closely packed footprints and something just seemed odd about them. I bent down to take a closer look and realized that whatever had made these definitely was not a fucking cat. Cats have the one big pad at the bottom and five small ones surrounding it right? This was two big pads side by side with two little dots above them. 

I just stood there trying to figure out what the hell could have made these when I started to hear it again.

"Meooowwwwwwww" but this time it was coming from the main floor down the hall from what sounded like the kitchen. A chill ran up my spine and I just froze up. I didn't think I'd be one of those people that would freeze up in scary situations but I did, but then I heard a yelp from one of my dogs and I flew off that ladder so fast I ended up spraining my ankle. I didn't care though, I limped as fast as I could over to the kitchen doorway and when I got there I just stood in shock. I'm gonna do my best to recall what happened but it was kind of a blur so just bare with me. The first thing I saw was my dog, floating in the middle of the room. Then as though I was staring at a marriage, y'know like you see something in waves of heat? This long white, pole came into view and it was holding my dog, several of these bone white poles were caressing my dog. Then slowing the rest of the thing came waving into my vision. Dozens of long spindly legs planted on the ceiling connected to a round white body white little hairs covering it. It also had these big fangs that were sunk into my dogs side. It removed my dog from its fangs and stared at me with six shiny black marbIe eyes and let out a low drawn out "Meoooooowwwww"

I lost it, I was so terrified I couldn't even scream I just snagged my other dog and ran towards the basement locking it behind me. I've been down here for 3 hours now and all I can hear is that God damn meowing. I tried calling the cops but my cell service isn't working down here. I don't know if this will even upload but I have to tell someone. If you get this I need help.
