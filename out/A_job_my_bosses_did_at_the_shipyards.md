I was late again. Fuck I'm always late to this new job. Bill and Lou will never trust me with anything at this rate. 

It was my 4th month at Lou’s Plumbing and Heating. I’ve been with Lou’s short enough to be stupider than hell and long enough not to be let go without cause. 

I sped to work as usual. As I walked in Bill was waiting for me at the punch clock. 

“Son, we need to talk.”

Fuck, I need this job, fuck fuck fuck. 

“Yeah, Bill?”

“Come into my office.”

I walked in tense, I had a feeling this conversation wasn't going to be good. 

“What’s up, boss?” 

“I wanted to talk about your job.” 

“Well, I’m grateful for the opportunity. Not many places take guys right out of high school who didn't even graduate. Look, Bill, I know I have been late a lot since I got the job. I'm trying to get better.” 

“You think I'm going to fire you, don't you?” 

“Yes.” 

Bill bursts out laughing. 

“What's so funny boss?” 

“You’re a kid, you don't think my brother Lou wasn't late all the time? For fucks sake, he's not even here right now.”

I nervously laughed.

“Kid, I wanted to talk to you about a career. You wanna push a broom and get the low-man jobs all your life? Or do you want to run these jobs and if you're lucky, maybe this place.” 

A far-fetched dream for sure. Nothing I’d thought of before. Did I want to do this for the rest of my life? 

“Whatever you need me to do, I'll do.” 

“That’s the spirit kid. I want you to work directly with me and under me.”

“But what about the other guys? I'm sorry to say this boss, but you aren't in the field much anymore.” 

“You’re right, I have a feeling I might not have to work in the office so much, soon. 

Soon

“Well, for today, Lou can handle my workload. I'll let Candy know I’ll be on the tools. It's time to get to work, apprentice.” 

And with that, I became Bill’s apprentice. We had a good day doing all manner of jobs for people. Unplug a toilet here, fix a boiler there, and repair a cracked pipe at Grandma’s house. It wasn't until about 2 months later that I worked with Bill again. 

“Jo, me and you have a job to do today.” 

“What's the job?”

“Old boiler me and Lou put in, it's acting up again.” 

“That doesn't sound like an all-day job.” 

“It’s an original Angel Fire.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“Piece of shit is what it means.” 

“So where is it?” 

“Frank and Bev’s farm is about an hour and a bit from the shop. Go tell Bob you're with me today so he doesn't schedule you with any of the other guys.” 

Without complaint, I walked to the basement of the shop to Bob’s office. Bob’s office was a very recently converted mechanical closet in the dark poorly lit basement of the bomb shelter we call our shop. It's parked just behind the boiler that was installed in 1910 when the building was built. We never got around to removing it as it was the size of a semi-truck and made of solid steel. The boiler was made by F. A. Corp. in 1908 and assembled on-site. It's a work of art compared to the half-assed heating setup Bill and Lou scabbed together since they bought the building. 

I walked into Bob's tiny, cramped office. 

“Bill says I’m with him today.” 

“Frank and Bev’s acting up again?”

“How’d you…?”

“Came in on the pager last night, fucking thing woke me up at midnight. I'm not going to get used to that working here.” 

“Scary that even you know the issues with that boiler. It must be a real piece of shit.”

Bob laughed. 

“Was one of my first jobs here to work on that fucking thing. Bill didn't even charge them for it after what happened at The Plant with their son.” 

Bob got quiet and stared off into nothing. 

“Bob?” 

Bob snapped back to reality.

“Well boy, if the damn thing goes out in 2 months, the things a piece of shit. Now get going it’s a long drive.” 

I walked back to Bill’s office upstairs.

“Hop in the truck kid, I grabbed everything last night.” 

“Okay, you were here at midnight?”

“Yeah, Bob called me in a panic, thinking we had to go out there asap. So I drove to the shop to grab some parts and to call Frank and Bev myself. Bev said it could wait till the morning. The house was warm enough for the night.” 

Bill and I walked out to the truck and started driving. 

“Hey Bill, where’s Lou been?” 

Bill chuckled.

“Didn’t I mention? Lou was here late last night. Now   Lou’s at home with my nephew because Lou’s wife, or ex-wife I should call her now, is no longer in the picture. Louis Jr is a handful.”

He was right, every time he was at the shop crazy things would happen. Shelves full of parts would be tipped over, the few lights that were on in our shop would flicker off and go out and Lou would always be in a rage.

“So he won’t be in today?” 

“Oh he will, my brother doesn't miss a day of work for small things.” 

“Getting divorced is small?”

“You have no idea kid. Lou’s only missed work twice. Been late about a million times, but he doesn't miss work.” 

“What was the first time?” 

“He missed 2 weeks to go see Metallica in Moscow.” 

I could see Bill was pulling my leg. 

“Sure Bill, you're brother went to Moscow? Are you a secret agent too?”

Bill started laughing. 

“Figures I couldn't pull the wool over your eyes. The first time is a long story. The second time is for the birth of Louis Jr.” 

“Don’t tease me, why didn't he show up to work.” 

“Because I didn't either.” 

Bill said that with a cold sharpness to it. Thinking he was trying to pull my leg again, I pressed. 

“And let me guess you've never missed a day of work either,” I said with a chuckle. 

Coldly, Bill stated,

“For 30 years, I have been at the shop at 6:00am every morning. The only time I don't show up at 6:00am is because I wake up in my office.” 

“Jesus, I feel ashamed of myself, I'll try to be just like you Bill.” 

A smile cracked his icy facade. Bill started to chuckle.

“We have some time to kill before we get to Frank and Bev’s. How's about I tell you that story.” 

I sat in the comfy truck seat and relaxed for the horrors I was about to hear.

**Bill**

Dad and the fucking shipyards. Now I have to go wake up Lou. 

“Lou, get up. Dad says there's a ship in the harbour. Says they need us to fix one of the pumps for the cargo boiler. Can't wait they need to be out by first light.”

“Fuck Dad and his fucking ships,” Lou said groggily. 

“You know how he is, it's 1:00 am and he's still at the shop.” 

“He’s going to give himself a heart attack.” 

“He’s going to have a heart attack if we don't go.” 

“Why aren't you taking Randy?” 

“Big brother and little brother bonding, also the last time I woke him up he tried to fucking stab me.”

Lou chuckled, “I forgot. Let's go make Dad some money then, but you're telling him I'm sleeping in tomorrow.”

I cuffed Lou upside the head. 

“Owe! The fuck was that for?” 

“Tell him yourself. Now let's go.” 

Lou and I hopped into my work truck. 

“Why can't we take my truck,” Lou complained.

“Because it's a mess and mine isn't.” 

“Sure looks like a mess.” 

“Paperwork and parts boxes, at least it's not lottery tickets and strippers phone numbers.” 

“Hey! I'm not dating a stripper!.” 

“Sorry, an exotic model who happens to work for Gross Greg at Bunny’s.” 

Really? Your name is Greg Gross and you own a peeler bar? 

“I think I love her.” 

“If I thought I loved you we wouldn't be having this conversation.” 

“Hey! What does that mean?!” 

And on and we bickered and insulted each other until we pulled up by my Dad at the gate. A short angry man. He was old school. You screw up, you get hit. You cost him money, you get hit. You disagree with him, you get… you get the point. Anger was what he idled at. Rage was him revving the engines and fury was when he was on a war path. He was only kind and sweet to one person. Our mom. She's what took him from 11 back to 0. Tonight was in between anger and rage. We got out of the truck to talk to Dad. 

“Where the fuck is Randy.” 

I spoke up, “I didn't wake him up.” 

“Do you know how big this pump is you fucking moron. It’s 400 pounds.”

I spoke again, “You’re here aren't you, would've helped if you'd told me that on the phone.” 

Rage.

“I said bring your brothers! Who do you bring? You're fucking sister!” 

Lou's eyes flashed the same burning red as our Dad's. I stuck my hand out to calm him. 

“Randy tried to kill me last time we did something like this. And besides Randys no help on a job like this.” 

Our Dad stepped forward, even though I was a head taller than him, he still towered over me. 

“You better listen and you better listen good. This job ain't a cakewalk. I changed this pump last year, Joe and Ricky helped. If those two can barely do it, how the fuck am I going to be able to trust you two?”

Joe and fucking Ricky, Dad’s old-timers that have been with him since he started the company. Those two couldn't even screw a lightbulb in. 

“Dad I'm done arguing, the fuck do we need to do. You didn't tell me anything on the phone other than that the pumps went down on a ship.” 

Dad went back down to just being angry. 

“The pump threw a bearing. They have a spare on board but the fucking millwright they hired went off with some broad at the last port. We need to swap the pump.” 

“We? You're staying?” 

“Of course, I'm fucking…”

** *BEEP* *BEEP* *BEEP* **

Dad’s pager rang at that moment, he put it to his ear. 

“Fuck, I have to take this one. You two get the fucking thing fixed. And you better be in tomorrow morning.” 

Dad hopped in his truck and sped off. 

I never did ask him where he went that night. 

You should've 

Lou and I got into the truck and drove to the gate. 

“Late night boys? Louis got you working on one of the ships?” Said the guard at the gate. 

“Yeah, Dad’s made us work until tomorrow night practically,” said Lou. 

The guard chuckled, “Well what ship are you here to see?” 

Puzzled I said, “Don’t you know? Usually, they tell us at the gate.” 

“Well, I ask you because nobody’s told me anything about a midnight repair crew.” 

Excited at the prospect that it was a prank call and we could go home, I went to speak but Lou interrupted me, “Fuck yea, we can go home!”

The guard laughed, “Guess someone doesn't like your old man to drag him out here in the middle of the night.” 

As he finished that sentence we heard a crackle over the radio. 

“This is the Cap..” shhhh “aboard the Ed..” shhh “..ld” “our heat..”shhhh “cargo hold” shhhh “dock..” shhhh “29”

“What the hell was that?” The guard said with a puzzled look on his face. 

I looked at the guard defeated, “That's what we’re here for.” 

The guard looked at us now, “Somebody is playing a joke on me now, there ain't a ship at dock 29.” 

“Emergency stop? The captain’s radio might be on the fritz too. Probably wasn't able to radio the port.”

The guard looked at me seriously, “Maybe you're right dude, but there are 28 docks here, not 29.” 

“Guys probably worried about his ship, thing sounds like a pile if the cargo heaters down and the radio’s fucked, he probably misread the sign of something.” 

“Dock 28 is that way.” The guard pointed. 

Lou and I drove through the docks seeing massive ship after massive ship. 

“..27, 28. The guy was right no dock 29,” said Lou.

“And there’s no ship at 28?”

Confused, we drove back down the length of the port. 

“..2,1. Nothing this way Bill.” 

“I’m really fucking confused Lou. What do you think?”

“Let’s try one more drive down and we’ll go home if we don’t find it.” 

We drove pretty fast down the length of the dock to the end. 

“What the…” said Lou. 

“Dock 29? Are we going crazy? Holy shit Lou, look at the ship!” 

“That thing looks like hell.” 

How right you were Lou

The ship was a gargantuan vessel, nearly double the size of the barges and tankers in the port. The exterior was in need of a paint job. Badly. It looked like one of the anchors was snapped off the side of the boat. 

“How is this vessel seaworthy? Fucking thing looks like it needs a year in the dry dock.” 

“Well Lou, that’s not what we’re here for. Let's get the fucking pump fixed and go home.” 

We grabbed my tools and walked up the galley. Usually, we’re greeted by maintenance at the end of the galley. 

“Where is everyone? Lights are off? No one home?” said Lou.

“Hey, boys! Come to fix that pump? Fuckers freezing in here.” 

We both jumped and turned towards the voice. There was a man standing about 100 feet away from us. 

I yelled back, “Yeah, you wanna show us where we’re going!”

He motioned for us to follow him, we grabbed my tools and did what he wanted.

“Fuck Lou, look at the inside of this thing.”

“Jesus, it looks like the outside, what the fuck are these guys doing in here to be so rough on the ship?” 

“She’s an old girl, well older than most. She was christened in 1958,” said the unnamed sailor. 

“She’s only 18 years old then. Rough for only 18 years, some of the ships I’ve been on were built before the war, they don’t look this bad” I said. 

The sailor chuckled as we followed him through mazes of corridors. 

“She’s been through what most ships haven’t.” 

Before I could say anything else the sailor swung open a door into a massive room. It was the strangest sight I think I’ve ever seen. A pile of red dust about 5 stories tall sat in the middle of the room. It glinted with frost. In the dingy cargo lighting, it looked magical. 

“What are you guys carrying?” 

“Iron for some steel mill down the river,” said the sailor. 

“Downriver? Where did you come from, we’re pretty far north?” 

“Upriver,” said the sailor as if that would answer my question.

“Why do you need the heat on? It's only iron,” Lou said. 

“Makes it hard to unload when she's cold,” said the sailor simply.

“Where’s the pump?” I said 

The sailor pointed up towards the bulkheads running on the ceiling. Before I could ask how he expected us to get up there, he pointed at a ladder fastened to the bulkhead with a platform under the pump.

“We already brought the new pump up there. Just need you to change it. I'll go grab you the hoist we used to bring the new pump up there.”

Then the sailor was gone.

“Did you even hear the door close?” asked Lou. 

“Let's go and get the job done.” 

We climbed the ladder up to where the pump was. 
It was massive. And heavy, like our Dad said. 

“Bill, there's no way me and you are lifting the old one out of place and the new one in without that hoist.”

“Well let's take a look at what's wrong first. The millwright didn't send this call in, the crew did. And if I know the crews, they don't know jack about what we do.” 

I carefully inspected the bearing housing and the motor, I noticed red staining on the housing of the pump. 

“The iron dust must've fucked up a seal, I’ve got my wrenches, I can probably pull the seal off the new pump and put it on the old one. All we have to do is take the motor off then, we can handle that eh Lou?”

“Better idea than waiting for that guy, he gave me the creeps.”

So we did as I said and pulled the motor off. Next, I went to give the impeller a spin. 

“Fucker won’t budge, Lou pass me the ratchet I'm gonna pull the impeller out.” 

I pulled the casing off the impeller.

“What the fuck? How did fabric get into the impeller?”

Lou looked at me seriously, “Why is the water red Bill?”

“Pipes are rusty Lou, but I don't think…”

I yanked the impeller out for the pump housing.

“We need to leave now!” I said to Lou seriously. 

Lou's eyes were far away. 

“H-how… How'd he get in there?” 

“Lou, we’re leaving, fuck Dad, fuck this creepy ship.”

We slid down the ladder with our tool bags and ran through the doors. We heard footsteps behind us. They were running after us. The ship was cold, really cold. There was ice creeping down the walls of the corridors as we ran to the exit. I pulled open the door to the outside and slammed it shut after Lou exited. 

** *THUD* *THUD* *THUD* **

The banging went on as we sprinted down the galley. We ran to our truck, pulled open the doors and started it. We drove as fast as we could to the gates. They were open.

“Where’s the guard? BILL! WHERE’S THE GUARD?!” 

I kept driving, I didn't stop for traffic lights, stop signs, other drivers, nothing. I kept my foot on the gas and just went. 

When we got home the lights were on in the kitchen. Dad was still up. 

“Did you get it fixed, you two fucking..”

Before he could finish I grabbed my father by the throat and hoisted him into the air and slammed him against a wall.

Coldly I said, “Where did you send us tonight?”

“A shi… *hack* *hack* I can.. breat..”

I let go of my dad's neck and he fell crumpled to the floor. 

“I got a call from the captain of a ship, *hack* *hack*, we've done work for him before. Hasn't called in a while though. They're good business.” 

“What was the ship's name?” said Lou from the doorway.

“Edward’s something, I think,” I stated and froze at what I’d just heard

*tap, tap, tap* 

A tapping noise came from the paneglass window in the kitchen. All three of us looked towards it and saw written in thick red liquid 

**Edmunds Fitzgerald**

It was written on the inside of the window. 


*The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead*

*When the skies of November turn gloomy*

*With a load of dead men and two mechanics on board*

 *The ship had bones to be chewed*

*T'was the spectres of November come stealin'*

*The dark came early and the rest had to wait*

*At 1 AM, the fellas boarded*

*"Fellas, it's good you came"*

*Does anyone know where the love of God goes*

*The church bell chimes 29 times*

*For every body found on the Edmunds Fitzgerald*

*Superior, they said, never gives up her dead*

*They said*

*They lied*
