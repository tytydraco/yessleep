It’s been weeks since that night, and I can’t shake the memory from my mind. Writing it down might help me make sense of what happened.

Noah and I found ourselves in the  same hotel bed again, a place where our tumultuous relationship always seemed to return. I felt myself slipping into a heady rush of euphoria, a dizzying high, but it was tainted by a creeping sense of guilt that gnawed at the edges of my happiness, casting a shadow over the moment of bliss. Our laughter filled the room as we reminisced about our past, knowing that by morning, I’d bury it all like I always did. We swore countless times never to meet again, but every time, we caved. I tried so hard to move on, to convince myself I was over him during our long periods of silence. But it only took one night out, one drunken call, and we were back in the same cycle of love and hate. Driven by a mix of animosity and deep, undeniable passion, we were magnets drawn to each other’s destruction.

I allowed myself to find solace in the warmth of his skin, on the verge of drifting into a deep sleep, when Noah realized his phone was missing.

“Where’s my phone?” he muttered, patting the bed and searching under the pillows.

“It’s probably lost in the sheets,” I replied, reaching for my own phone. “I’ll call it.”

Noah nodded, still searching. I dialed his number, and the familiar ringtone echoed from somewhere in our tangled bed. But then, a chill swept over me. Instead of hearing the ringtone stop with his voicemail, Noah’s voice came through the phone. I glanced at him, lying beside me, hands empty.

“Who is this?” I asked, my voice trembling.

“It’s me, Mila. But you knew that already.” His voice, unmistakably Noah’s, dripped with condescending dismissal. It cut deep.

My heart raced. I turned to Noah, but his gaze met mine with unnervingly cold, black eyes. The warmth and hazel that once comforted me had vanished, replaced by an unsettling void.

“Mila, what’s wrong?” he asked, feigning concern.

Cold sweat broke across my forehead. I moved away, eyes fixed on him. “Noah, where’s your phone?” I managed to ask, trying to steady my voice.

“Right here.” He held up empty hands, but the phone vibrated under the covers. His lips curled into a cruel smile, eyes glistening with excitement.

My mind raced. The voice on the phone was Noah’s, yet the man beside me was a chilling imitation. I had to act fast.

Without warning, I leaped from the bed, grabbing my phone and a heavy bedside lamp. He lunged after me, movements slow and unnatural.

“Mila, stop! What are you doing?” His voice, cold and devoid of warmth, sent a shiver down my spine. His words were spoken with a twisted smile.

I dashed to the door, yanked it open, and fled into the hallway. His heavy footsteps pursued me. Panic screamed in my mind, urging me to escape the hotel.

But as I reached the elevator, darkness swallowed my vision.

When I woke, I lay in the same hotel bed, alone. Silence filled the room. I sat up, disoriented and afraid. Had it all been a nightmare?

“Noah?” I called out, my voice echoing. Silence answered. I grabbed my phone, dialing his number in a desperate attempt to hear his voice. But his name wasn’t in my contacts. Confusion and dread clouded my mind. I dialed his number from memory.

The phone rang and rang before a man answered. “Hello?”

“Noah! Oh my gosh, you won’t believe the dream I had,” I blurted out, heart pounding.

“There’s no Noah here,” the man replied calmly. “You must have the wrong number.”

I hung up, fear and confusion swirling within me. Where was Noah? I waited in the hotel, hoping he’d return, but he never did. Reluctantly, I left for home.

Back at my apartment, I tried to calm myself. I called our friends, but none remembered Noah. I pleaded with them to stop this sick joke. Hours passed in frustration until I gave up, visiting our favorite restaurants, asking strangers, but no one recognized him. It was as if he had never existed.

I searched photo albums, yearbooks, vacation photos—Noah was absent from every memory. Panic gripped me. I called my parents.

“Mom, Dad, I need to talk about Noah,” I began, tears welling. “You’ve met him, you know him.”

Silence followed. “Mila, who’s Noah?” Mom’s voice held concern.

My father sounded bewildered. “Mila, are you alright? We don’t know anyone named Noah.”

Cold dread sank in. Noah was gone, erased from reality, leaving only memories that now felt unreal. Our love, our fights, all reduced to fragments in my mind.

I sat alone, the weight of it all crushing me. The voice, the warning, the cold stare—all haunted me, a nightmare I couldn’t escape. I had to move forward, but the world felt empty without Noah. The weeks passed, but the memories lingered, a ghost haunting me.

The world moved on, indifferent to my anguish. And I was left with the chilling truth of that night. As much as I tried to forget, the memory of Noah’s disappearance stayed, a ghost in the recesses of my mind.
