I used to love exploring abandoned places. The thrill of venturing into the unknown, searching for lost relics of the past, and the stories we could tell afterward made it all worth the occasional bumps and bruises. My friends and I—Josh, Tyler, and myself, Andrew—made it a habit. We were young, reckless, and thought we were untouchable. That all changed the night we met that demon, who I later learned was Fibby.

It was a crumbling carnival on the edge of town, the kind of place you’d think would only exist in urban legends. The air was thick with decay, and the distant creak of rusted rides made the silence feel alive. The place was unsettling, but that’s what we loved. We thought we’d find old prizes or maybe a creepy clown prop to take home as a trophy. We had no idea the nightmare that was waiting for us.

We first saw him in the funhouse. Fibby. At first, he didn’t move. He looked like a colorful mannequin, standing at the far end of the mirror maze, his oversized clown clothes tattered and caked with grime. His head—a polka-dotted ball—was too perfect, too smooth. No eyes, no features. Just a mouth that stretched unnaturally wide.

“That thing’s gotta be part of the carnival,” Tyler whispered, but none of us moved closer. Something about him felt wrong. His presence was suffocating, even from a distance.

Then Fibby tilted his head.

Josh, the bravest—or maybe the dumbest—of us, laughed nervously. “It’s just a prop, you guys. Watch this.” He stepped toward the clown, and that’s when it happened.

Josh froze mid-step, his expression twisted into shock. “Something’s—” he started to say, but then he screamed.

We looked down and saw it. A hand, pale and elastic, had reached out from Fibby’s body and wrapped around Josh’s ankle. The fingers were impossibly long, almost serpentine, and they began retracting, dragging Josh closer.

“Help me!” Josh yelled, clawing at the ground, but we were too terrified to move. Fibby’s hand pulled him closer until Josh was face-to-face with that grinning mouth.

What happened next… it shouldn’t be real. Fibby grabbed Josh’s face and ripped it clean off, peeling it like paper. He stuffed it into his mouth, chewing methodically as Josh’s screams turned to choking gasps. Then Fibby’s hands blurred with inhuman speed. He stabbed Josh’s eyelids with a blade that seemed to materialize from nowhere, tore off his nose, and plunged his fingers into Josh’s abdomen.

We stood frozen, watching in horror as Fibby pulled out Josh’s intestines and began eating them, his head tilting with a grotesque curiosity. Blood pooled around him, the metallic smell making me gag.

“RUN!” Tyler finally screamed, breaking the spell. We bolted, leaving Josh behind. We didn’t look back, not even when his screams stopped.


That was 25 years ago. Not a day goes by that I don’t hear Josh’s screams in my nightmares. Tyler and I tried to move on, tried to pretend that what we saw was some twisted hallucination brought on by fear. But we knew the truth. Fibby was real.

I thought I’d escaped him. I thought if I stayed away from places like that carnival, he’d leave me alone. I was wrong.

A month ago, I started feeling like I was being watched. Shadows felt darker. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, I thought I saw something just out of sight—a colorful blur, a polka-dotted ball. I told myself it was paranoia.

Then, last week, Tyler disappeared. His wife called me, frantic, saying he never came home from work. A few days later, they found his body in a park. His face was gone, his abdomen ripped open. I knew it was Fibby.

Last night, my world shattered. I woke up to find the bed empty. My wife, Emma, wasn’t beside me. I heard something in the living room and went to check.

She was there.

At first, I didn’t recognize her. Her body was twisted and mutilated, her face and abdomen torn away. Her flesh was flayed, muscles twitching as though Fibby had turned her into a grotesque puppet.

And there he was. Fibby stood in the corner, watching me. His head tilted in that same curious way, his bloodied mouth stretched into a grin.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. He spoke, his voice a guttural, mocking whisper.

“I won’t harm you, Andrew. That would be too easy. I want to see you suffer.”

Then he was gone.

I haven’t slept since. I don’t know how to escape him. I see him everywhere now, lurking in the shadows, waiting. I know he’ll come back. He won’t kill me—he promised that—but he’ll take everything I love, piece by piece.

If you ever see a clown with a polka-dotted ball for a head, run. Don’t stop, don’t look back. Because if Fibby finds you, he won’t stop until he’s torn your life apart.
