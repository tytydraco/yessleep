**Day 2 - Dawn - Gordian Falls**



It took a few moments of staring at the rippling flesh to recognize my own face. I was treading water at the center of the plunge pool, far enough from the impact zone that the surface could hold a reflection. Dawn had just broken over the canyon and it painted my undulating portrait with a backdrop of gold. I looked down at the oldest mirror in the world and was filled with profound sadness, not because I so disdained my face, but because I realized it was all I had. 



It was the pot, probably. It was the pot and the immensity of the scenery around me—the redwoods, the cascades, the sheer vastness of the wilderness. The combination had stirred in me an existential dread that I never would have found the space or time to entertain back in the city. Whatever the reason, as I stared at my distorted face, I felt like I was pulling back, looking at myself as a whole, my life in its entirety. 



What did people think of when they thought of me? I had little to show for twenty-seven years on Earth. I'd grown up in a cookie-cutter suburb. I had played soccer and received middling grades at my big, public high-school. I got a degree in business and I worked a white-collar job at a soulless corporation. I played video games to unwind and my favorite food was pizza and when I put all these pieces together they hardly took the shape of a real person. I felt like a caricature, like an avatar devoid of any customizations. When people thought of me, if anyone ever did, what had I given them to associate me with besides my face, my voice, my name?  If I couldn't conjure a single defining trait or skill or aspiration, then I doubted anyone else could either. 



I shoved my face into its reflection. When I got back home, I decided, I'd upend it all. Quit my job, sell my car, travel the world. Or quit my job and join the army. Or the priesthood. Or the circus. Or quit my job and fuck off to the woods and live out my days perfecting some craft. Woodworking, maybe. Or taxidermy. The world was my oyster, and the only certainty was that I could not spend one more day in that God-forsaken office. 



I lifted my head from the water only once I began to feel lightheaded. Wiping the water from my eyelids, I cast my gaze out towards the treeline, back in the direction of our camp, and saw Mason walking towards the water's edge. One of his hands held a camera; the other lifted towards me in a friendly wave. 



"You're up early," I said, though the words came out too quiet and were lost to the roar of the falls. I swam to the shore and rested my forearms on the rocky slope, propping my head and back out of the water. Once Mason was close enough, I amended my volume and shouted out again.



"I wanted to catch the falls at sunrise. Thought it'd make a nice picture, but I got up too late." 



He found a large, dry stone upon which to sit as he fidgeted with his camera. Mason took photos of beautiful women for a living, though according to him, it wasn't as glamorous as it sounded. A *haute couture* photographer, his models were usually stuffed into some single-use, ungainly garb in the name of high fashion. He made good money and powerful friends doing it, but it was his self-assuredness, not his career, that I was jealous of. Mason had been taking photographs on disposable cameras since the two of us were in elementary school. It had long been his dream to become a National Geographic photographer, and I could see him doing it, too. He already had the skill, the reputation, and still he had the luxury of dreams to chase. What I would've given to have something like that to set my heart on, to pour myself into.



"How'd you sleep?" 



"Like a brick." 



"Same, I think. I don't remember much honestly." 



"You were pretty out of it. Talking to the trees and shit. Here—" Mason pulled up the evidence with a few *clicks*. I squinted at the display screen, upon which there was a photo of me from the night before. I had my back to the camera, my face to the trunk of a thin oak. My hands were raised and slightly blurred as though I'd been gesturing emphatically.



"Christ, I don't remember any of that. Maybe I was trying to make a joke?" 



"Maybe." 



I must've rightfully looked a little mortified, because Mason laughed, waving his hand. "You're good, man. People have done weirder. Remember that girl who pulled her eyes out because she thought God told her to?" 



I shuddered, my eyes stinging from the mere suggestion. 



"Yeah, I read an interview with her mom. Fucking insane, I can't even imagine. That was meth though, right?"



Mason looked past me, not saying anything. I thought the falls might've drowned me out again. 



"That was meth though, right?" 



"Don't turn around." 



"Why?" 



"There's someone on the other shore, hiding behind a tree. Or trying to." 



"What? What're they doing?"



"Staring at us." 



I searched my friend's face. Mason had a plethora of talents; pulling pranks was not one of them. Generally, I took his words at face value, but the notion of a stranger in the woods, peering unseen at me as I swam, was at once so unsettling and unlikely that I didn't immediately believe it. 



"Why can't I look?" 



"They'll see you turning around, and I want to tell you where to look first. Hold on." Mason set his camera down and rested his hands on the back of his head, squinting as he feigned a stretch. 



"Okay," he said after a moment, looking back at me. "There's a giant fir behind you and a little to the left—you know what firs look like, yeah? Ok. Halfway up the hill. The guy's four or five trees to the left of the fir. Got it?" 



I nodded, prepared myself, and then quickly spun around, whipping my head towards the tree Mason had described. To my surprise, I really did see someone. My friend's directions had been spot-on, and my eyes immediately landed on a human shape beside one of the tall trees. When the man saw me turn (I thought it was a man, anyway), he pulled back behind the broad trunk, removing himself entirely from view. I had seen movement more so than I'd seen the man himself. I hadn't made out in time many details save his hair color (brown) and the pattern on his clothing (hunting camo), but I could see from his pose that he had indeed been looking in our direction. 



Startled, I turned back towards Mason, my expression no doubt betraying that I too had caught sight of the stranger. 



"Fucking weird, right? Thought I was going crazy for a second." 



"Was that camo?" 



Mason nodded. 



"Ryan said this was a strict no-hunting, no-fishing zone"



"Well, there you go—that's why he's hiding. Probably has a rifle or a fishing pole and didn't want us to rat him out to a ranger." 



"Sure …" 



We were both quiet after that. I conceived a few reasons that a person might have behaved as the stranger had, but none entirely convinced me. If the man was a hunter, then why was he loitering by the falls? If he was a fisher, then why was he wearing camo? If he was simply another hiker who wasn't sure of our intentions and wanted to keep to himself, then why linger and stare? 



Whatever his reason, the tranquil atmosphere was thoroughly sullied, and so I clambered out of the water, ready to head back to camp. Mason studied me as I headed towards the stump atop which I'd laid my towel. 



"Did you cut yourself?" He asked, motioning towards my left arm. I looked at my palm and saw an angry slit weeping red down my fingers. I had no memory of wounding myself, and was surprised to find that, while the cut was over an inch long and deep, [it didn't hurt at all](https://www.reddit.com/user/11velociraptors/comments/1hvevou/the_skin_youre_in/).
