Faster than light travel seems like a great idea on paper. Get everywhere you need to go in a snap, especially if you’re exploring the depths of space. The bad thing is that when you’re moving faster than light, all you’re left with is darkness, with nothing around to keep what’s hiding in it at bay. Man lives in the light for a reason, and we’ve been discovering that the hard way.

What follows are years worth of research notes that I’ve stolen. Not a single doubt in my mind that I’ll be shuffled off by some men in black within the next twenty four hours. Hell, they’ll probably be here in the next ten minutes once this finishes uploading. If you read this, please know that those of us who were involved just wanted to make things better. We thought if we discovered faster travel we could get a jump on exploration, colonizing new worlds for humanity to thrive on. That’s all we wanted- prosperity for everyone.

I don’t know what might happen in the future, but I leave one simple request for everyone- stay in the light. They’ll probably keep working on this, but for the love of everything, for your safety, stay. Even a flashlight, if you have it. I know I can still hear the whispers from dark corners, calls from shadows on the ground… they’re always closer than you think.

Time’s up, the upload is ready. There’s a lot of scientific jargon but I’ve gone through and tried to make a more concise edit to get the point across. For anyone more interested, I’ve put up the raw files that can be sorted through. Look, I’m not trying to make a name for myself with this. I just don’t think those that lost their lives should have done so in vain. Something awful is waiting just outside the light for us, and those it already took wouldn’t want anyone innocent to suffer too.

Stay safe. Stay in the light. Godspeed.

A LETTER FROM DR. JAMES NEELY to AVARICE CORP CEO MATTHEW PULLER

Matthew,

While I greatly appreciate the opportunity, I must say I have some issues with your orders. Science, as you’ve seen from the advances in the past few years, takes time. Breakthroughs happen in a matter of seconds, but the preparation that goes towards those takes decades. Putting men on the moon was merely a stepping stone, and the prospect of lightspeed travel is something that I have dedicated my life to. That said, our research simply cannot move at the speed of light, much less the speed you want it to.

Under your directive we have lost no less than three test flights. At no point have we been prepared for these, forced to push our research far past any safe phase. I’m sure you know we’ve lost lives in the process as well, with the first ship exploding before it could leave Earth’s general area, combusting as it passed five units of gravitational force. The second made it through the initial run, though never hit lightspeed. However, it was unable to make the journey back due to a fuel leak. The third meanwhile, resulted in the death of the test pilot, as his body was unable to withstand the immense amount of force as the ship reached near lightspeed.

Matthew, do you know what it’s like to talk to a man who knows he’s going to die? We stayed on communications with the second pilot for fifteen hours until he ran out of air, finally passing out slowly as a mercy. We brought in a priest to say last rites over radio to him. His final rasps as he struggled for oxygen will haunt me to my dying day.

I write this as the lead researcher on this project- let us proceed on our own time table, so as to minimize the loss of human life as well as research costs. I realize how important this is, and just how badly you want to be the first to reach this amazing milestone, but please, please, make sure we do it ethically.

I’m afraid that if you cannot make these demands, I and the rest of the team will be forced to leave, and you’ll have to find a whole new research division.

Dr. Neely

Lab Notes of Dr. James Neely

The first test flight was successful. SOLARIS, a speed of light capable ship, was launched precisely one week ago. It was able to traverse space between Earth to Mars in approximately 24 minutes, including acceleration. Issues with dipping out of lightspeed at two instances as the accelerator stuttered. The return trip took 26 minutes, suffering another accelerator issue that caused it to lose speed three times. Despite this setback, the results are magnificent, and the crew onboard (AIR FORCE CAPTAINS: SPENCER, MULLINS, and PETERS) all came back in pristine health with no side effects.

Physical, that is. I’m including here my debriefing notes with all three men. Though they mostly are in high spirits, Mullins has shown some aversion to sunlight since his return. The other two have not exhibited this or any other symptoms. Transcripts follow.

(Captain Mullins, are you feeling alright? You haven’t left the lab or living quarters since returning from the flight.)

I uh… no. Just had an odd migraine I can’t seem to shake. If it’s too bright I feel like I may throw up.

(Your scans came back looking completely normal, so there doesn’t seem to be any issue. Would you like to talk about what happened during the flight?)

All things considered, sir, it was uneventful. The acceleration up to speed of light had the hiccups with the accelerator, but I believe that’s just a kink that can be worked out over more successful flights.

(Very well. You’re dismissed, please send Captain Peters in next, if you don’t mind.)

Sir.

(The men switch out, Captain Peters taking the seat formerly occupied by Mullins.)

Sir, is Mullins alright? He’s… he’s looking pretty pale.

(I was hoping you could shed light on that, Captain Peters. Can you walk me through what happened up there?)

Well, jump to lightspeed was about how I expected. Everyone was in high spirits, but the accelerator hiccups were what started to throw us off. First one happened at about the halfway point of acceleration. Second happened just after we hit speed of light, and it took us about five minutes to ease back up to that rate. When we got to it though… damn. Everything outside was like a blur.

(Did Mullins start acting strange at all during the voyage or return flight?)

On the return… he started mumbling to himself after we hit lightspeed the first time. Something about the dark finding a way in through the cracks. It was maybe half a second before we lost speed again.

(Nothing after that?)

If we’re being honest, I think it was him that dropped us out of lightspeed. It was like his eyes were blank when he did it, as if he were sleepwalking or something. Didn’t happen again after that and he didn’t mention anything about what he said.

(Thank you for your time, Peters.)

END TRANSCRIPT

I’m going to keep up observation. We’re working on the accelerator still, hopefully making it easier to make the lightspeed jump in only seconds eventually as opposed to the timely process it is right now. I’ll be adding updates to this file as we go.

1/17/1977

No further issues with Mullins. He’s been out and about with the others, even joined in with the division’s celebration party last night. Hopefully he doesn’t have alcohol poisoning now…

5/7/1979

RESEARCH NOTES OF DR. NEELY

Another breakthrough. We’ve hit a massive, massive leap with our engine technology using a form of nuclear fission. Now we can accelerate to not only the speed of light in seconds, but go beyond it, finally realizing faster than light travel. We haven’t put it into a manned craft yet, of course, but used some unmanned rockets to test it. Everything’s held together so far, but I want to be sure before sending the Captains up in this one. We need to make sure the craft sent up will be able to withstand the forces acting on it, and be able to keep them alive through the process. It’s going to be a while, but we’re going to make sure it’s done right, and done well.

12/13/1981

It’s finally ready. The engine was just the first step in getting a manned flight into the air. We had to completely redesign any sort of craft we had. A couple of small scale animal flights were done, but the poor souls never survived the return trip. Turns out we needed to completely redo the temperature and radiation shielding, Doing that while maintaining a flyable craft was the hard part. We got it though, and the first flight goes up tomorrow. Captains Peters, Mullins, and Spencer are all due to make the jump first thing in the morning, They’ve already gone through the preliminary launch, and I’m happy to say I went with them.

Not that I’m making the jump, of course. No, turns out the Avarice Corporation has some major pull. Suppose shady government contracts will give you that, if you use it. Cue my surprise when they told me that myself and some other researchers would be able to set up here on Skylab. Turns out the “Skylab” that we in the public knew of, the one that crashed into the ocean a couple years back, was just some old prototype satellites. They kept it up here, though with some upgrades that made it invisible to the Soviets. I must say, it’s much nicer up here than the previous iterations, lots of fantastic upgrades. 

Anyway, we’ll be supervising the flight and return from up here where we can get a front row view. Then once it’s over, they’ll take us back down to Earth so we can make further adjustments. I can hardly sleep. Partially because of not being in Earth’s gravity anymore, but partially because of the excitement! 

12/16/1981

The past two days have been a failure that will haunt me even after my dying breaths. I’m just as responsible as the Avarice Corp. execs who wanted this. Just as responsible as the government officials who commissioned our work. I’ve damned three good men due to my negligence, and for that I am sorry.

We set up at the viewing window to watch the flight as the Captains took off. Peters was piloting this time, with the other two serving as both observation and copilots in the event of some malfunction or catastrophic issue. 

Verbal confirmation came in from the pilots. The engine on their ship began to glow bright in the exhaust ports as it stored up energy, the fission causing a nuclear glow in the void of space. Then like the blink of an eye, they were gone, zipping off across space. The idea was that they would fly out to the edge of the universe, just past Pluto, then turn it around and come on back to us. Until they made it back, we wouldn’t have any kind of communications. Try as we might, we couldn’t figure out any kind of radio or otherwise that would work while they were at lightspeed.

It seemed almost instantaneous, maybe five minutes passed at the most, and then they were back. The ship though… it looked rough. Like it had been through decades of wear and tear, lost out in the darkness of space and banged up by whatever debris floated by. It docked on Skylab, but none of the pilots came through the airlock when it was secured. Finally, I worked up the courage to open the door from our side.

The smell hit me first, and it was like nothing I’ve ever had the misfortune of smelling before. Putrid, the stench of excrement and death, overpowering. It took everything in me not to throw up in zero gravity, though it was more out of fear of having my own vomit float back into my face. I held my nose, moving forward slowly as I tried to find what happened.

Spencer was the first one visible. What was left of his body was sitting there in his chair still, though there wasn’t much to call a body anymore. Bones were visible, with flesh hanging off in tattered chunks that looked as though they had been torn off by ravenous teeth. I soon saw that was the case, as Peters was locked in one of the computer compartments, mumbling to himself, blood covering his face and mouth, staining his teeth. Mullins was sitting in the third seat up front at the console, one of his legs missing, torn off right below the knee. His eyes were wide, likely in shock. The men looked older than when I had seen them only half an hour before- hair now grey, eyes sunken, and hard lines in their faces. The two living ones were thin, almost like a prisoner of war after being freed from captivity. 

Peters screamed when he saw me, rage and terror in his eyes. He tried hiding from us, pressing himself into his seat as far as he could. Mullins kept staring forward blankly, off into the darkness of space beyond his window, looking into nothing and everything at the same time. 

We got an emergency shuttle sent out from Earth to bring us back, but in the meantime I did what I could to talk down the two men. It didn’t go well, and eventually when backup got there we had to strap them down and float them into the rescue shuttle. They were nearly unintelligible, but Peters kept screaming about a coffin beyond light. 

The shuttle got us back home to Earth, thank god, but that was just the beginning of our problems. When we tried to get them from the shuttle to the building, both started screaming bloody murder on seeing sunlight. Peters was about to be wheeled out on a stretcher by medics and managed to throw himself in a way that flipped the entire thing over, right back into the shuttle. Mullins just shrieked the entire time we were prepping him to move, finally leading to the decision to do alternate transport. They backed an ambulance up to the shuttle door, no way for sunlight to get in, and transferred them over before driving them to the medical facility parking garage and getting them out there. 

Considering Spencer’s remains couldn’t scream at us, we didn’t try moving it any different way. We didn’t have any kind of body bags up there either so he had been wrapped in one of the thermal blankets and transported that way. We put him on a gurney and wheeled it out of the shuttle, into the sunlight, and suddenly there’s this ungodly scream and smoke rising up from inside the blanket. Sunlight managed to hit the body, making it hiss and steam before bursting into flame. I swear to god, I don’t think it was necessarily… him that was screaming. No, it was something else, because within seconds the darkest plume of smoke I had ever seen erupted from the blanket and dissipated into thin air. Only his remains were left on the gurney, just charred now. 

We got him to an autopsy table and determined his death was the result of massive trauma and blood loss. Which was pretty obvious from the get go, if we’re being honest, considering much of him had been torn to pieces. 

Peters and Mullins have been under observation since we got back. Both are in deep hysteria, with Peters still going on about some coffin and how it was going to open soon. Mullins just sat there, staring ahead at the wall, only demanding that the lights be turned off wherever he was. Peters did the same, practically knocking out the bulbs in his room, saying that the light was going to hurt him. 

We had some security cameras on the ship that I’m having pulled so we can see what the hell happened. Will update when I get the footage and have a chance to thoroughly review it.

FROM THE RECORDS OF DR. JAMES NEELY

12/20/1981

I”m pulling the plug on these experiments. There’s no chance in hell we mess with faster than light travel any time in the foreseeable future. I still don’t know what the root cause of all this was, but we’re cutting it until we can find out, thoroughly and definitively, what the hell happened here.

The footage I pulled from the ship feed only left me with more questions. There wasn’t much to it, and half of it was… I don’t know, degraded? It was like something had destroyed it. Considering Mullins finally started talking though, I don’t know that we’re going to need it.

Everything looks normal as they’re making prep for the jump, but once they actually hit lightspeed, everything changed. It’s around then that the degradation started being obvious, with the three men all in their chairs at the main consoles. As soon as they hit speed though, three more people appear in the footage. Nothing… nothing defining on them, just tall, almost shadows, standing right behind each man as they hit lightspeed. It stays like that for about two minutes, these figures just standing there before the footage finally cuts out into static. It never comes back on after that.

Mullins had a while where he was clear last night, said he wanted to speak to me, but only in the dark. I clarified that I would need to record what he said, and he reiterated the “no lights” rule. I agreed, foregoing even a small flashlight for note taking for the sake of getting answers. It was dark, with only his vague silhouette visible sitting across the table from me. What follows is my conversation with him.

(How’s your leg feeling?)

I can still feel it, even with it not being there. I can still feel… them… gnawing on it too.

(Them? Was it Peters who took it?)

No. He didn’t do any of that… it was the shadows. The dark. 

(I’m afraid I don’t quite follow, Captain Mullins.)

You sent us up there with a mission, right? To go faster than the speed of light. A whole new avenue of travel that could make human lives better. Right? Take something that would normally be years of travel time and cut it down so we all have more time to build a new world, free in the light of the sun.

(Sure, yes. We wanted to find a means of travel through space to, hopefully, find new worlds that humans could build and live on.)

Doctor, do you know what happens when you move faster than light can travel?

(I’m assuming I don’t, no.)

You’re left in just the dark. They’re finally able to catch up. No light to stop them. 

(They?)

Came in right through the windows. At first we thought it was a trick of the eyes. Gravity and speed warping what we were seeing. It was like the darkness outside the windows was pushing over itself to get through, bending the glass and plastic as it pushed. Well, eventually it figured out it couldn’t get in, and started… I don’t know, feeling it’s way around. It searched out a spot where it could crawl through, the smallest little crack in the paneling, between the window and the frame, a slightly loose screw… it made its way in. 

God, it was like it moved in slow motion. Looked like smoke at first, that’s why Spencer got up. He thought there was a fire going somewhere under the floor panels, went to get the fire extinguisher and stepped through the whisps of darkness coming out of the ground. That was it. All it took was for them to touch him and he just… stopped right there.

(What did he do next?)

Just stood there for a second, then he attacked Peters. Jumped at him, tried forcing him off the console. He hit the accelerator, pushed it to the damned limit, and when that jump hit Peters was able to knock him back in his seat. We both jumped up and tied him down, had some duct tape we situated away and got him secure to his chair. By the time we got that done though we had been at the max speed for… god, it was probably only minutes but it seemed like hours. Days, even.

Peters sat back down and eased off the speed until we were steadiy drifting. Spencer was just screaming at us the entire time, telling us we still had further to go. Not really sure where the hell he was plannin’ on taking us but… well, I’m afraid to know what could have been further out after what we saw.

(How far out did you end up, Captain Mullins?)

When we finally stopped my gauge read 2.9 million light years. Not in Kansas anymore, that’s for fuckin’ sure. 

(Fascinating. You must have left the Milky Way Galaxy in that case. What did you see?)

Not a damned thing. Just darkness. Big, empty darkness far as the eye could see. The only light came from the stars behind us, light years away at this point. There was nothing to speak of, not a single star, for the foreseeable distance in front of us.

I checked our navigation. We managed to overshoot the Andromeda Galaxy completely, so I tried to get us lined back up to make the jump back. Peters was busy trying to get some kind of distress signal out for a second, but then he suddenly just stopped.

(Do you know why?)

If I had to guess, sir, it’s because of what was floatin’ by outside our window.

(What?)

It had to be miles away from us, but the damn thing was huge. Probably the size of a planet, I’m just amazed we didn’t get sucked into it, it had to have its own gravity as big as it was. 

(What was it?)

It looked like it was made out of stone. Reminded me of those old coffins you would see in horror movies. Carved stone, a giant slab on top to make sure whatever was inside stayed inside. That wasn’t enough for whatever was in this thing though, I guess. It had chains. All around the thing, just these massive links of metal covering every possible inch, wrapped right around it so tight it had made notches in some of the areas on the stone. It was just barely visible in the light shining from the Milky Way far behind us, but I swear those chains… they were shining like they were just smithed. Not a blemish on them, reflecting the little bit of light that made it this far out.

(Chains? But what could make chains that large?)

God himself, I guess. Sir, I don’t know what else to tell you. I know what I saw.

(Yes, yes, I’m not doubting you, and I appreciate your honesty. I’m just having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around the concept.)

You and me both, sir. Think it broke Peters’ brain seeing it. Poor guy kind of just… shut down. I managed to get us turned around, Spencer was screaming at me still, telling me we still. needed to go further. Something about opening the way. I tuned him out best I could and got us fixed in the right direction. Hit the thruster and got us back up to lightspeed as quick as I could. 

(Were there issues with the return trip?)

As soon as we hit faster than light, yeah. Whatever had attached itself to Spencer… sprang right out of him. It was like darkness that was made solid, looked like an octopus’ tentacle reaching out of him. Sounded like he was choking for a second before it came right out of his mouth. Stabbed through My leg and started ripping its way in. Hurt like hell.

(What happened to Peters?)

Well, I was a little preoccupied with my situation, but I saw more tendrils work their way in between the panels outside. The dark moving in just like it did to Spencer, but this time it latched onto Peters. He threw himself over me, trying to get to the thruster. At first I figured he was trying to take us out of lightspeed, turn us around or something. He hit it forward though, back to the top speed. I fuckin’ let him at that point. I had another issue to take care of. 

(Your leg?)

I could feel it inside. Like… felt like worms in my damn veins, working their way up trying to get from there to my head. I knew if they made it all the way up that it was over. There was no way I would be able to think clearly if they got to me like they did the others.

(So what did you do?)

There was a toolkit for repairs in one of the side compartments, where we kept some of the spare computer parts for navigation. Got the hacksaw out of there and started cutting while I still could. 

(Peters let you?)

Shit, I had to knock Peters over the head with a hammer to get him to leave me alone. He jumped after me, teeth going for my neck practically. Knocked him right on the forehead. Locked him up in that same compartment and kept going. Sawed through as much of the skin as I could then used the hammer to break the bone, twisted it off. I’m sure I only lived because of the adrenaline and shock of the situation, but finally made my way back to the thruster and took us out of warp speed.

(And that was when you arrived back outside of Skylab?)

I fuckin’ wish. No, the way he hit the thruster, it jammed in lightspeed. I had to figure out a way to get it out before things got even worse. 

(How did you manage to fix it?)

The old fashioned way- I hit it with a hammer. 

(That dropped you out of faster than light speed?)

Slowly but surely. Judging by the gauge I had, we were going at least a thousand times the speed of light, so it took a few minutes to drop it back down. The thing is… even going faster than light, in the opposite direction, I swear when I looked out the window it was still there.

(The coffin?)

Yeah, the coffin. It was like it was the one constant, even as stars and planets flew by in fractions of blinks, it was just there. Except since we were traveling faster than light there was nothing to reflect off of it now. I swear there were… it was doing the opposite of glowing. Like from the little crack under the slab and hairline fractures on the surface where the chains were gripping it tight, it was absorbing in whatever stray light was out there. For a second I could swear that we were being drawn in with it, whatever little bits of light coming off the shuttle drawn to it. I hobbled around the cabin as best as I could and turned off every light possible, trying to hide from it. Whatever was inside though, it knew. It knew we were there. I think it let us go on purpose.

We dropped below lightspeed not far outside the edge of our solar system. I saw the other planets pass by pretty quick before I pulled the brakes hard once Skylab was in view.

(You managed to dock the ship.)

Huh. Well, color me impressed. I don’t remember much after seeing Skylab. Think that’s around the time everything started to go blank. Adrenaline wore off, I guess. Last thing I remember was the sun pouring in through the window. Spencer… whatever was in Spencer, didn’t like that. The darkness came back, started eating at him, trying to find a way out of the light. Is he doing okay now?

(I’m afraid Captain Spencer passed away before reaching Earth.)

Damn shame. How’s Peters?

(The head wound has taken some recovery time, but he’s getting there.)

Good. Good to hear. I know this seems bleak, doctor, but I think this is only a bump in the road. I think we’re on the verge of something big here.

END TRANSCRIPT

My conversation with Captain Mullins ends there as I run out of tape and excuse myself. As I open the door, bright fluorescents from the hallway spill into the room, falling squarely on him. Only the dark silhouette is still visible though, as if the man himself has been consumed by darkness.

I received word later in the day that Peters was awake and wanted to speak to me. I visit him in a hospital room. He’s requested almost the opposite of Captain Mullins, demanding that the lights stay on at all times. Bright fluorescent bulbs underscore the hard lines on his face, now clean of blood. A line of stitches runs across his forehead, accentuating where Mullins must have struck him.

(Good evening Captain Peters. I’m glad to see you’re in better shape.)

You can see it, right?

(I’m sorry?)

You can see it, right there! (He starts waving his hand around beside his bed, pointing at something on the ground). I need a flashlight. Please. Bring me a light.

(I reach for the exam light on the wall, bringing the coiled cord over and shining it over him. He sits up, letting it shine over his hand and project a shadow on the ground.)

Oh, thank god. Thank god. It’s still outside.

(Captain Peters, do you remember what happened up there?)

Mullins attacked me. Threw me in the compartment. He’s fuckin’ dangerous, Sir. You’ve got to get him locked up.

(Captain Mullins says that you attacked him, Captain Peters. You mean to tell me something else happened?)

He tried to drive us right into that coffin, Sir! Bastard was going to run us into it at lightspeed so whatever was inside could come out. They got him! They got Spencer, then they got him!

(Slow down, Captain. What do you mean by ‘they’?)

Mine is still outside, sir! They didn’t get me! I saw it take over the other two though…

(Please, Peters, I need you to explain calmly.)

We made the jump to faster than light, right? And when we were in the jump, I looked back behind to speak to them. There was… I could see my shadow projected on the wall and ceiling behind me. The console lights, I was the only one they hit. The other two… when I looked back their shadows were taking them. They were in their seats, but there were these huge… I don’t know, beings made of pure darkness standing behind them. I saw Spencer’s grab him. It grabbed at his face, holding his mouth open, then it just kind of… stepped in. Like it was putting on a human suit. 

Mullins… his tried to grab at him but I moved at the last second. The light that hit him kept it from taking him right away, I think. I don’t know. Spencer started attacking us then and we had to tie him down to the chair. He managed to grab Mullins leg though, I think that’s how it got him. I pulled us out of lightspeed before anything else could happen.

(I’m not following, Captain Peters.)

Spencer’s shadow took him over, sir. I think that’s what it was at least. The dark… when you go faster than light all you’re left with is the dark. There’s no more boundary between us and our shadows. They took over Spencer, and started working their way through Mullins. When we stopped and saw the coffin… I tried to stop him. Whatever got into his leg started working its way up, he wanted to open the coffin up. I snuck up on him with the saw, hoping I could get it out of him…

(He told me he cut his own leg off.)

He probably wants to go back up there, too, doesn’t he? You can’t listen to him sir. Please, believe me. I took his leg off and that slowed him down enough so I could get us turned around. Then he hit me with the hammer and threw me in the compartment. God, I must be the luckiest son of a bitch alive, the lights in there were probably on when he shut me in. Only thing that kept this bastard out. (He looks down to his own shadow on the ground again, grimacing in fear.)

I swear sir, shine a light on him. He won’t have one anymore. It’s inside him now.

(I think you should rest, Captain Peters. I’ll come back by tomorrow and check in.)

END TRANSCRIPT

I must admit, his words have left me shaken. I can’t get rid of this feeling of paranoia. Despite the bright sun outside, weather surprisingly warm, I shiver upon catching sight of my own shadow on the ground. I don’t know yet that I’ll try what he’s asked with Captain Mullins. Perhaps I just need sleep. It has been a few days since I’ve had more than a couple hours of rest.

Misfortune seems to have my number today though, as I’ve received a letter from my benefactor. Mr. Puller is insisting that trials continue, whether with new pilots or with Mullins going back up. He also warns that I may get a visit from some men with the Collective in the next few days, and that I’m not to speak with them under any circumstance. It’s obvious at this point that he only has his own preservation in mind, and these gentlemen may threaten that. I’m looking forward to having a chat with them.

12/21/1981

Some strange individuals arrived today, requesting to speak to Captain Mullins and Peters. They’ve identified themselves as agents from The Collective. To tell the truth, I’m giving them everything. I don’t trust Puller or anything that Avarice may have its mind set on at this point. 

They requested to speak to Peters first, and received his story firsthand. When it came time to meet with Mullins, they requested that I go in with them. Something tells me they know more than they’re letting on.

When entering Mullins’ room, I can see that he’s gone a few steps further now to ensure no light gets in. Glass from the fluorescent tubes above litter the ground of his small room, making uncomfortable crunching noises as we stepped in. Upon flipping the switch, none of them came on, with only a loud crack heard from one of the still intact sockets that was desperately trying to route electricity.

He demanded we leave, insisting that no lights be turned on him. From what I could tell, he was in the corner of the room, only a dark, amorphous shadow on the wall to give any hint that someone was in there. One of the agents had shown me before going in that they were holding a small handheld light, over three thousand lumens in brightness. Said it was enough to light up underground caves when they had to occasionally search for lost artifacts, though what kind of artifacts he was talking about eludes me. 

When he flashed it on, Mullins shrieked. He jumped from the corner, launching himself up almost to the ceiling where he stuck himself to the wall, like a vampire evading the light. I expected to see pale, waxy skin like from an old Dracula movie, but instead every inch of skin visible on him seemed to just absorb the light. He was a being of pure darkness, light oozing around him like it was bleeding into an event horizon. The Agent continued shining the light, telling him to come down and he would lessen the brightness. Mullins refused to comply, leading him instead to crank it higher. 

Eventually the former Captain fell from his perch near the ceiling, his face finally visible in the bright handheld light. His eyes were gone, hell, his entire face at that. In its place was a singularity, drawing in all the light it could from the small handheld. The agents didn’t say too much, simply keeping the light on him as they wheeled in a small gurney with a box on top, sliding his body into it while doing their best not to touch it directly. 

Through the whole process, even outside of his being cloaked in darkness, something didn’t seem right. I didn’t realize it until going back in my mind now, but the entire time the bright light was on him, there was no shadow cast from his body. It’s like the light simply went right through him, no semblance of a human or even animal there in his stead.

They took him away and transferred Captain Peters to their custody. I’m sure Puller is going to jump down my throat when he hears about this, but at this point… he can kiss my ass. The agents that were here gave me a number to call, said they may have some work for me in their aerospace division. I don’t know that I’m going to call them though.

After all that, I think it’s time I retire. Someplace sunny sounds nice. Perhaps I’ll move between the poles. Chase the midnight sun, as it were. Anything to ensure my shadow stays behind me.
