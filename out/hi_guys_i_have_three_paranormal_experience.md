**Now I have several paranormal stories that happened to me. I have an awareness that my grammar is horrible because I have two disabilities and neurological disorders. The first disability is a spectrum of autism and the second disability is global dyspraxia.**   
   **Now I will begin with the two experiences I had in my hometown in Texas because I still live here. The first event happened to me when I was in ninth grade and was struggling with my mental health because I was bullied. Somehow my mental state causes me to see a pitch-black figure for a few seconds. No one was out of my family's backyard because my brother was in college, and I knew that my mom was at work. The second thing that I knew was that my dad was sleeping.**   
**The second paranormal experience happened most recently at my family now still living. I was watching a video on YouTube. I just heard a high-pitched little girl's voice say hi Mom to me. I rewound the spot of the video I heard that and I was kind of freaking out but surprised.**   
  **The last story was in French Quarter New Orleans Louisiana because my family was going back home from visiting my grandma. After all, we thought she was extremely sick. We went on a haunted tour of the French Quarter because they planned that for me. Plus it was the luckiest day and perfect timing because it was raining heavily that day of the tour. My mom took a picture of the restaurant that is haunted how we got a picture with a shadow figure and we know that no one made that.**
