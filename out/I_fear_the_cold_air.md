December of 2007. Its Christmas Day, excited to open presents with my mom and dad. A cold wind hits my face as I open a window to let the smell of bacon and sausages flood out. It's freezing. -4Â°F outside. I see the snow pile on our porch. People yelling as snow ball fights echo around our quiet neighbourhood and as the vision fogs from the snow squall thats incoming, it goes quiet. I sit on my chair listening to the melody of fire crackling as I wait for my mom to announce whose present belongs to who.

Thats when a hear a strange deep sounding noise come from behind our house. I walk up and my mom asks where I was going. Confused I ask if she heard that too. Its strange that only I heard that. I can't see much. Stupid snow squall gives perfect christmas day pictures but doesn't let me see what is making a noise. I shuffle back to my chair as my mom announces my present. Its an iPhone! I was so excited I could almost scream!

My excitment is cut short by that low pitched sound again. The snow squall calms as I shuffle to the glass door leading to my backyard to check for the noise. No evidence of anything causing noise. This was my last straw. I would walk out there and see what was making that noise. I walk out to the cold crispy finger tips of the air grabbing my face. I look out as the wild effortlessy blows my hair away. I squint and look around to check for anything. I see the snow. It's black? A large line is just black. What could cause snow to be black? Confusion as fear leave me at a loss for words. Thats not my problem for now I say as I walk back. I left the door unlocked. Biggest mistake of my life. I go upstairs to my room to set up my phone. Halfway there when I hear that noise again. Its coming from my kitchen. "Mom? Dad?" I yell out. No words. I walk down to the kitchen. The stairs creak following my footsteps. I turn to the kitchen. Nothing. 

I turn to the livingroom.

my mom and dad are sitting in the chairs I last saw them in, pale with blood all over them.

I scream in horror. The sound comes back.
Thuwmp
Thwump
Thwump
I look at the stairs. Nothing. I scurry out the house in a snow squall crying for someone. The snow squall gets worse as I yell for my neighbour to open the door. He saves me by opening the door and letting me in. I cry the story out while sniffling in between words.

20 minutes later, the police arrive. I open the door crying. A cold air hits my face.
They question me, the noise.
I heard the noise.
Thwump.
Thwump.
Thwump.
It echoes from the house.
I walk in the house with the police. A cold air hits my face. 
Thwump.
Thwump.
Thwump.

It drove me insane. I hate the noise I hate the cold I hate snow.
I cried.
A cold air hits my face, I look up. I see him.
Thwump.
Thwump.
Thwump.
Anger fills my eyes. I run up.
Hes gone.
A cold air hits my face. The air knocks me out. I think I woke up 30 minutes later. All I see is him.

July 2024. All I see is him.
It's dark at night. I open the backdoor and set up for a night to watch the stars. A cold air hits my face.
I look around. I see.. him.
thwump
thwump
thwump.
I can't go one day without seeing him.
I fear the cold air because it reminds me of him.
