My husband and I have the best relationship. We have been married for 24 years and counting. He still makes breakfast for me every day and I still tell him I love him every night. We have our divergences, but we work through them as a couple. As a team.

It wasn't always like that though. We met almost 30 years ago. I was 19, he was 21. We were madly in love from the start. So much that I thought it would be fitting to change our wedding vows from "till death do you part" to "for eternity".

After we had been married for around a year, we started trying for a baby. We tried and tried... Until we learned we couldn't have children. My uterus was "the wrong shape", according to the doctor.

As in many other cases, this put strain in our relationship. The stress and resentment started to build up on both ends and we started fighting. A lot.

First came some small disagreements. Then they started growing and growing. By the end, every small thing would end up in a screaming match.

One day, I was doing my stuff around the house and needed to pee. In a hurry, I sat on the toilet without looking. I gasped in horror as my body sank and my butt touched the porcelain inside. I got up and saw the seat was up.

I marched to my husband and started yelling at him. "Can't you just leave the freaking seat down? Are you that much of a baby?". He opened his mouth to answer me but he just closed it back, closed his eyes and sighed. "I need some time alone". With that, he went for the door and left in his car.

That night, the police came to my door, telling me he had been in an accident. They said he was at the hospital, in critical condition, and that I should go there as soon as possible.

I could not bear my regret. I started sobbing and asked the officers if they could take me there. I was in no condition to drive. They looked at each other and the one by my doorstep said "ma'am, this is not standard procedure but sure, we'll give you a ride".

From then on, my memory is patchy. I read that's a normal response to trauma. I remember the doctor saying they weren't sure he was gonna make it. I remember seeing him hooked to all the life support machines at the hospital. Next thing I remember is him at home already.

The accident left him on a wheelchair. Because of that, I was now mostly in charge of everything, but he still tried to help. Two or three days after he came home, I remember him saying "I want to cling to life, and you are my life". From then on, we realized our problems were tiny compared to losing each other, and our fights stopped. We still have disagreements, but we talk about them as a couple.

Because of all the trauma and being on a wheelchair, he didn't want to leave the house ever since. I respected his will for years, but at this point, I felt like he really needed to go out. So I booked a surprise vacation for us at a place that is accessible for wheelchairs. Today I was looking for the reservation papers (I'm a bit messy and I lose stuff easily) and I looked in a drawer that I rarely use. I found a paper and checked if it was it.

Right now I'm packing. I'm not sure where I'll go, but I'll go alone. My husband asked from the kitchen "baby what are you up to?" and I replied "just tidying up the wardrobes". I can't let him know.

I mean, how do you tell someone you found their death certificate?
