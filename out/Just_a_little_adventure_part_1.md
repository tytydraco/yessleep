It was one of those mornings. Cold, dark, windy, and quiet.
The kind of morning that makes you question why you even wake up at all.

I stayed in bed longer than I should have.
The apartment was cold really cold.
The unit next door was empty, the one below me too.
No heating anywhere except in my own place, and even that barely worked.

I dragged myself out of bed and shuffled into the bathroom, splashing water on my face.
5:20 AM.
Forty minutes until my shift. I grabbed some fruits to eat quickly.

“I’m wasting my energy and time at this job.”
That’s what I kept telling myself.

Retail.
Simple enough to stay alive, hard enough to slowly damage you physically, mentally, spiritually.

I finally stepped outside, got into my car, and cranked the heater to max.
While driving through the empty, dark streets, I put on Suspect K, my favourite true-crime horror podcast.
This was my passion true crime, horror, the macabre.
The only thing that made me feel something.

The city was silent, as if holding its breath.

I arrived at the uptown retail store where I worked.
Before going in, I hyped up my mood it was my final shift of the week, after all.
I had everything planned: stay up all night, watch YouTube, maybe a movie, binge the podcast, eat something unhealthy, drink soda.

“What a life,” I thought.

I clocked in and started the day.
My coworkers were already eating breakfast together.
I felt a strange kind of disgust toward them.
I couldn’t explain it.
It wasn’t rational just a feeling that sat deep inside me. Just a deep feeling.

Eight hours passed. I clocked out, finally. Then my manager called me.

“Hey, you got a minute?”
“Yeah, sure. What’s up?”
“Come to my office. We need to talk.”
“Alright.”

We sat.

“Josh… it’s not easy to say this. But the company is thankful for your work. Really. Unfortunately, we have to end our employment relationship with you.”
“Wow. Really? You waited until the exact moment I’m done with my last shift of the week?”
“Sorry, Josh. It wasn’t easy.”
“Why?”
“Budget issues.”
“Yeah sure, buddy. Anything else?”
“Just your card.”

I placed the card on the table.
Then I left without another word.

Inside my car I muttered, “Fucking asshole.”

I stopped for food and snacks on the way home.
I wasn’t sad, not really.
It wasn’t my dream job.
But it was enough to live a quiet, functional life.

Back at my apartment, I texted a few friends about what happened and began looking for new jobs.
A week passed.
I stayed inside unless I absolutely had to leave.
I found no new work.

“I still got time. Maybe it’s better this way. I needed this.”
I lied to myself.

I felt depressed, useless, lonely.
But I kept deceiving myself.
I had to maintain the illusion that I was fine.

I ate while listening to Suspect K again.
That podcast wasn’t just entertainment it was the one thing I truly cared about.
True crime, horror, the unknown… I lived for this.

I once dreamed of being a police officer or working in law enforcement.
But life had pushed me onto a different track.
A more “unsuccessful” path, at least in my own mind.

Then, during the episode, I heard something that made me sit up.

“So Leo, let’s break it down… authorities suspect there may be a serial killer in the city. Is that right?”
“Well, there’s speculation. Several murders, methodical, similar. But authorities aren’t releasing information. I think they’re trying to prevent a panic.”
“Yeah, that makes sense. Sometimes that’s what killers want… attention.”
“Sure, in many cases. But not in this case … hahahah.”

A tasteless joke.
But enough to make me giggle.

I paused the podcast.

Silence filled the room.

I sat there… thinking.
Thinking about the murders.
Thinking about the city.
Thinking about everything I just heard.

Suddenly this thing became my obsession I started to dig some information out about this murders.
I checked some websites some news about murders.
I noticed a certain pattern, until now there were only three murders and every victim killed with a crossbow.
But there was some serious evidence missing, In general, what was written was very superficial.

I took notes where the crime scenes were.
The crime scenes had probably already been cleaned up, but what did I have to lose?
I’d been home all day anyway.
I finally had a chance to do something important with my worthless life.

Just a little adventure, what more could it be?
