My maternal great-aunt Francisca had lost her battle with cancer. My mom was the most broken up about it of the three of us. She’d spent almost as much time around her as Francisca's children and grandchildren. I hadn’t been around her enough times to bring on the waterworks. However, on the few occasions, my parents brought me along, she’d be kind and hospitable.  
  
  
I was saddened upon hearing the news of her passing from my dad. We flew out to attend her funeral. It was a mournful yet memorable event where tears along with fond memories of the deceased were exchanged.  It wasn’t our only reason for coming. We’d agreed to help her immediate family move stuff from her house.  
  
  
While she was still lucid, she requested that when she went her home would as well. No one knew why exactly. The only reason she gave was something to the effect of her home having enough memories. While we didn’t understand it, we respected it. The day after the funeral, we headed to her home where cars were already parked.  
  
  
Anything sentimental would be taken and the rest of her things would be given away. I was sent in to help my cousins inside while the rest of the family helped load the moving trucks. Despite having lived alone for most of her adult life, she’d assembled quite the collections, mainly coins and vases. One of which would be going to my mom. I was instructed to package the one in my Great Aunt’s bedroom by wrapping it in newspaper and bubble wrap.  
  
  
Then I’d put it in a box and label it. Afterward, I was to repeat the process with everything that didn’t take two people to move. Then I was to carry the boxes to the truck outside. In all my visits, I hadn’t been in her bedroom once. Despite her absence, part of me felt as if I was somehow intruding when I entered.   
  
  
I pushed this aside and got to work, making sure to be thorough in my task. I had one box left and decided to check the room once more in case I missed something.  I even checked under the bed. Not finding anything, I was about to finish up when I noticed something ever so slightly sticking out from under the mattress near the headboard. It turned out to be a book.   
  
  
It wasn’t just any.  It was a diary belonging to my great aunt. I know I should have told someone and that it should’ve gone to her immediate family. I  have no idea why I got the impulse to take it. Let me say I wasn’t a handful growing up.   
  
  
I never got into trouble or hung out with any shady crowds.  Hell,  when I was little I always made sure to stay with my parents when we went shopping. In short, I was a pretty boring kid.  That’s exactly why it was strange for me to hide the diary in my inside coat pocket. Any time the idea of doing something even remotely mischievous came up, I’d get nervous and chicken out.  
  
  
This time I didn’t. There was no voice in my head telling me to think of the consequences if I got caught. Nobody suspected a thing. It was like it was natural to me. The rest of our time there went as normal. The following day we were on a flight back home.  
  
  
This would be where I tell how I opened the diary as soon as I got home. Truthfully, though, I sort of forget about it. When we got back to our house, I put it in my desk drawer.  Months went by before I saw it again. It was during Spring Break and my parents were away on business.   
  
  
A storm had knocked out the power, leaving me with nothing to do. That is except for reading. I went through a lot of books in my childhood and I skimmed my collection for any I hadn’t read. Eventually, I did find one. Some kind of biography I think.  
  
  
All that was missing was my book light since it would’ve been too dark for reading otherwise. It was in my desk drawer and that’s when I  found the diary again.  I picked it up. I’d only done a cursory examination of it until then and it seemed like the right time to inspect it further. Transcribing the entire thing would take up several posts.   
  
  
Therefore, I will be transcribing what I believe to be the most significant parts.  I had some difficulty with this as none of the entries were dated. I’m assuming they’d have to go back a century going off of  Francisca's age. She did live for a long time. Due to the lack of dating, I will instead be numbering the entries below.  
  
  
*Entry 1: What a great day! For today is my birthday!  I’m six years old now.  Mama made me the most wonderful chocolate cake and Papa gave me this diary. It’ll be good to help me practice writing.*   
  
*My most favorite gift of all came from my brother. He was kind enough to surprise me with my very own doll.  I’d been wanting one so bad ever since I saw them at the store. Edgar is very thoughtful. He made my doll himself and it looks so much better than the ones in the window.*  
  
  
*Entry 2: I made a new friend today! I’d been having trouble making friends since we moved here. I met her in the forest behind our house. I don’t know much about her yet except that her name is Bernice. She has pretty eyes.*  
  
  
*Entry 3: I’ve known Bernice for over a year now, but I’ve never met her parents. I wonder why? She says it’s because they are always busy. I do hope mine can meet hers one day. I bet they are kind people.*  
  
  
*Entry 4: My education is going very well. My teacher has even told me I am the smartest in her class. I can’t take all the credit. Edgar has been working hard to help me with my studies.  I am worried since Mama and Papa seem to be at odds, but he tells me not to worry about such things.*  
  
  
*Entry 5: I wondered about something while I was playing with Bernice today. I asked her why I never saw her at school or around other kids besides me. She said it was because her parents homeschool her and don’t want her around other kids. I asked her why she was allowed to see me then. She told me it was because having one friend couldn’t hurt.*  
  
  
*Entry 6:  We’re concerned about Papa. He insists he’s fine, but he’s been moving a lot slower lately. Mother has been begging him to see a doctor in town. She hates how stubborn he’s being.*  
  
  
*Entry 7:  Papa’s health has gotten worse. He can’t even get out of bed now. A doctor came to examine him. Mother has told us to be brave for him. I wish there was something I could do.*  
  
  
*Entry 8: I talked with Bernice about Papa today. She said she might be able to help. I asked her how and she told me it would have to be when Mama and Edgar are away. I asked her how come and she told me it was a secret and that I had to trust her. I don’t understand it, but if it helps Papa, I’ll do it.*  
  
  
*Entry 9:  Edgar and Mama went into town to get some stuff for Papa today so I brought Bernice to the house. I was nervous since Mama said not to have anyone over while she and Edgar were gone. I took Bernice up to Mama and Papa’s room. I wanted to go in with her, but she said I had to wait outside.  I wanted to know why and she told me she could help my dad, but she couldn’t do it if someone was watching her.*  
  
  
*I hate not knowing stuff. Bernice is smart, though so I trusted her.  She didn’t want me to see what was going on, but she didn’t say anything about listening. She’s way smarter than I thought. She knows two languages! I know because I heard her speaking another on the other side of the door.*  
  
  
*For some reason, it got real cold when she did.  That’s weird for May. When she came back out, I wanted to know if Papa would be alright. She said he would be and I was so happy! Then she told me something weird.*   
  
  
*She said Papa was still holding onto a sickness and that it needed to be passed on.  Bernice told me, Papa, had to shake someone’s hand.  I’ve only seen him do that with new people and not many visit our town so I hope we can find someone.  If he does will the person he meets get sick too? I hope not.*  
  
  
*I want Papa to stay better, but I don’t want someone else getting sick either. I’ll have to ask Bernice about it.*  
  
  
*Entry 10: Papa’s been a lot kinder since he got better! He even told me a bedtime story last night. Mama is normally the one who tells them so that was real fun.  I haven’t seen Bernice lately. I wonder where she goes off to?*  
  
  
*Entry 11: Bernice scared me! I was out in the woods again. I like chasing frogs because they make a funny noise. I was sneaking up on one and then she grabbed my shoulder. I almost had it too! I was glad to see her, though so I forgave her.*   
  
  
*I asked her about what she meant when she was at our house. She said that it didn’t mean Papa would make anyone sick, but that it meant something unusual would happen to them. Papa has said one of our neighbors has an unusual horse that’s a lot bigger than the others so that must mean it’s something good. Maybe Papa should shake hands with himself.  Bernice showed me a trick.*  
  
  
*We were playing hide and seek and I was the seeker. I used to play it a lot with Edgar so I’m real good at it.  Bernice is good too. I almost gave up trying to find her. Then I spotted her up in a tree! I didn’t even hear her climb!*   
  
  
*She must’ve been as quiet as a church mouse. Her back was up to me and I thought I could catch her by surprise, but when I got to the tree she was gone again! It was so frustrating! I came close a few more times, but every time she’d vanish again.*  
  
  
*She’d appear behind a tree, on the other side of the river, and even behind me. That last one nearly made me jump out of my skin. I know she’s better than me at Hide and Seek, but she doesn’t have to rub it in. Maybe I can beat her next time we play.*  
  
  
*Entry 12: We went into town today for the fair. It was lots of fun! Papa got to meet someone new. He was even taller than him. I wish I remembered his name, but I liked him because he wore a tall hat!*   
  
  
*Papa says he had a strong handshake.  The tall man talked to me and I told him how good I was doing in school. He said I was smart! He was friendly. I wish Edgar and Mama could have met him. I hope I get to see him again someday.*  
  
  
*Entry 13:  It’s been a long time since I’ve written in this.  Life has been busy lately and has presented its fair share of trials. It saddens me to note that Father has passed away recently due to an accident in his workplace. Edgar, unfortunately, witnessed the incident while visiting him.  Father was well-loved and it warms my heart that so many have given us their condolences.*   
  
  
*Entry 14: Edgar has been distant ever since Father’s passing. Most days he hardly says a word to Mother and I.  Father gifted him a pocketwatch before his passing. He spends a lot of his time studying it.  We wish there was a way to make him happy again. I miss how he was before.*  
  
  
*Entry 15: Money has been scarce as of late despite Edgar’s efforts. He works so hard. Mother and I have been trying our best to support him as not much work is available for us. Edgar has told me that he’s proud I’ve been doing well in my studies. He says Father would be too.*  
  
  
*Entry 16:  At last, I have some good news.  Years ago,  Father and I met a nice man at the fair. He’s recently become the leader of our great country. I doubt he will see this, but I wish him great fortune.*  
  
  
*Entry 17:  Things are all wrong now.  Our country has become divided through senseless violence.  Everyone’s efforts have gone to support the war.  Even Edgar has enlisted. I know we’ve been struggling, but why did he have to leave us?*   
  
  
*Doesn’t he know how much we worry for him? All we can do is pray for his safety.*  
  
  
*Entry 18: The war has been going well and there are rumors it may be coming to an end soon. If it does, I hope we will see Edgar again. I’m sure he’s missed us dearly and has been thinking of home every day he’s spent fighting.*  
  
  
*Entry 19: Oh god, it shakes to my core to write that our great leader has met an untimely end. That coward, shooting him while he was enjoying a play! I know violence is wrong, but I hope that awful man’s punishment is severe.*  
  
  
*Entry 20: Edgar has yet to return despite the war's end. We fear the worst. Mother tries to be strong. However, I can hear her sobbing during the night. My sheets are soaked with tears as well.*  
  
  
*Entry 21: Something peculiar occurred the other night. I woke up to tapping on my window and I thought I heard someone saying my name. My mind must be playing tricks on me.*  
  
*Entry 22: Now I know for certain I heard something. It happened to me again. I went to my window to see who it was and nobody was there. If this is a joke, I do not find it at all amusing. Perhaps I haven’t been getting enough rest, but I’ve been getting this feeling that I’ve been forgetting something.*  
  
  
*Entry 23: Not something, someone. My old friend has come back. I wonder why she still looks so young. She wants me to come out to meet her again. I forgot how much I’ve missed her. She’s told me at the window she wants to meet Mother.*  
  
  
*Entry 24: It’s a miracle!  I got Mother to follow me into the woods. Not only was Bernice there, but also Edgar and Father! If only Mother didn’t scream so much I could have enjoyed it.  Bernice was a lot taller than I remember.  Why do the animals run away from her?*  
  
  
*Entry 25: What have I done? That girl, no that thing, it took Mother. How could I  have let myself fall under its spell? I only broke free of it when I heard Mother’s screams.  It showed its true self.*  
  
  
*What god would allow it?  At least I remain safe here. Tomorrow, I will gather the people in town and we will put an end to this evil.*   
  
  
*Entry 26: How could I have been so blind? I played right into its hands. I’m the only one left. I must keep these entries brief as I dare not stop moving unless absolutely necessary.  My horse must sense my worry as it’s always pushing itself to move as far as it can.*  
  
  
*I may not have much experience with guns, but if it catches us, I won’t go quietly.  If we can just make it to the next town.*  
  
  
*Entry 27: Every night, I hear its laughter.  We’ve been resting during the day. Poor Cinnamon has been having such a hard time of it.*  
  
  
*Entry 28: It rained. The thunder scared Cinnamon and she left me behind. I’ve managed to make ti to this cabin, but I have no means of travel now.  I know it’s only a matter of time before it reaches me. When it does, I’ll go out and meet it.*  
  
  
*Entry 29: I look so pretty today! Although, the name will take some getting used to. Why does it have to have so many syllables?*  
  
  
*Entry 30: How many years has it been? I’ve been in its mind. It’s taken so many. I don’t know how I’ve gotten control back. All I remember is wandering in darkness and hearing shrieks.*   
  
  
*Then there was a light. I hear it at the back of my mind. It’s furious.*  
  
  
*Entry 31: I believe I understand something about it now. It passes on pain so I have done the same. I’ve gone through so many names now I can’t even recall my true one. I try to love when I have become a mother or father or a husband or wife.  My only tether to my original life is what I have written down here.*  
  
  
*I wish I had a way to end this, but its hunger is persistent.*  
  
  
*Entry 32: This will be the last thing I’ll write in here. I’m an old woman now and despite everything, I’ve had my fair share of happiness. I never thought I’d get to be part of such a big family. It reminds me of being with Father, Mother, and Edgar. I’ve finally figured out how to stop it.*  
  
  
*Pain is what it needs so I have seeped my lifeblood into these pages. It’s in it now. It screams to be let out, but it’s something I’ve grown used to. I’ve wanted to burn this cursed book and I would’ve if it wasn’t still connected to me. Once I am gone, it will be up to whoever finds this to finish what I started.*  
  
  
*To the one reading this, I offer you my sincerest apologies.*  
  
  
Naturally, I assumed this was a work of fiction after reading it. Then I began to see her from the corner of my eye, no, not her, it. Whatever that nightmare was, only I could see it, but she took the form of Francisca when she was young. I had to do what her diary instructed. The forest near our house seemed as good a spot as any.  
  
  
I thought I could get the job done quickly. Then it appeared. I managed to win, though. However, it got the last laugh. It’s been over a decade since then and I’ve been to the doctor due to sudden and acute pain.  
  
  
In short, I have some kind of cancer they don’t even have a name for yet. By the estimate of my doctors, I only have about six more years in me. I wish I’d never found that diary and experienced the horrors Francisca did. I understand her reasoning, however, and do not hold any resentment. Even though I’m afraid, I’ve come to terms with it.  
  
  
My family knows of my illness and has supported me as best as they can. I suppose all I can do now is try to make the most of the time I have left. Getting this all out has helped me through this process. I’ll be the first to admit my memory isn’t the best and yet I can recall every part of my great aunt’s diary. I don’t know what the thing she met as a child was.
