My legs moved before my brain could catch up, adrenaline flooding my system. Behind me, I heard the man's scream—sharp, agonized, then suddenly muffled, as if something heavy had clamped over him. The vibration beneath my feet intensified, following me as I stumbled across the concrete.

I didn't look back. I couldn't. I sprinted through the abandoned park, weaving between rusted slides and overturned picnic tables. Every shadow seemed to pulse, every distant groan of metal or whisper of wind could be footsteps—or worse, the wet slap of something dragging itself across pavement. The man's final, desperate word echoed in my skull: 

Run. 

Run. 

Run. 

I reached the fence, the bent section KC had found. My hands shook as I squeezed through the gap, metal scraping against my back, tearing my shirt. Only when I was out on the desolate street, gasping under the solitary streetlight, did I finally turn around.
The park loomed behind me, silent as a forgotten tomb. No screams. No echoing splash. No sign of the man who'd urged me to flee, or of Justin and KC. Just darkness and the remains of what something that used to spark joy.

I pulled out my phone with trembling fingers and dialed 911. My voice cracked, barely audible, as I tried to explain, stumbling over words like "monster" and "shark statue" and "something took my friends." 


The police station's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, an unforgiving buzz that scraped against my raw nerves. Hours bled into each other. I was led into a small, windowless room, the air stale with disinfectant and unspoken weariness. A plastic chair bit into the backs of my legs. My tattered shirt, stained with crusty grime and dried sweat, felt cold against my skin. They took my statement first, a young, tired-looking officer scribbling notes, his expression a mix of pity and polite disbelief. 

I tried to recount everything—my missing friends, the park, the terrifying presence in the pool, the strange man who'd saved me. Each detail, spoken aloud, sounded more insane than the last.

"So, you're saying a... a giant shark statue came to life?" the officer asked, pen hovering over his notepad.
I paused, realizing how ridiculous it sounded. 

"No, not exactly. It was... something in the statue. And it took Justin and KC."
He nodded slowly, too slowly. "Right. And this other man, the one who told you to run, was he with your friends?"

"No...." I admitted, my voice a ragged whisper. "He was just there. And then he was gone."

They brought me lukewarm coffee in a Styrofoam cup. I barely touched it. My mind replayed the last terrifying hours, the adrenaline now leaving me hollow and cold. They kept me waiting, asking the same questions, bringing in different officers. A female officer, Detective Rodriguez, finally entered, her expression more sharp than the others, but still guarded. She sat opposite me, not offering coffee or small talk, just setting a file down with a soft thud. Her gaze was clinical, assessing.

"Tommy," she began, her voice even, almost flat. "We've sent a patrol to the park. Found nothing out of the ordinary. No signs of forced entry, no disturbances. No... giant shark statues."

My stomach clenched. "But... it was there! The Maw! And Justin and KC are gone!"

She sighed, a quiet, professional sound. "We have missing persons reports for Justin Miller and Kyle 'KC' Dowers. We're treating this seriously, Tommy. But your account... it's difficult to corroborate." She paused, her gaze steady.

"But, we also looked into the staff records for the park, going back to when Sterling Industries first acquired the land for the 'revitalization project'," Rodriguez continued, picking up another folder. "A lot of people were hired and then let go when the project was finished. One name kept coming up, given your description of what you saw at the park." She opened the folder and pointed to a picture of a young man, barely older than me, with earnest eyes and a shock of dark hair. "This is Oliver Richard. According to his employment records, briefly worked in site maintenance after the attraction renovation was completed. He has accounts that are very similar to the ones you've given us tonight? Does that name ring a bell?"

I stared at the photo. It was him. The man who'd saved me. Oliver... My heart lurched. "Yes," I said, my voice barely a whisper. "That's... that's him. He saved me."

She quickly jotted something down on paper in blue ink, and closed the folder before taking a breath and pulling out a different folder from her side. 

"We also did some digging into the shark's origin, just for shits and giggles. And, well-I'll be damned if we didn't find some very interesting information there as well. 
That lake Sterling pulled it from? It has a history."

She opened the folder, revealing old newspaper clippings, their edges brittle and yellowed, some with faded photographs between them. The light overhead glinted off of them. 

A headline from a 1987 article chilled me: "MYSTERIOUS DROWNINGS PLAGUE LAC DES MORTS." Below it, a smaller, almost illegible piece from 1923: "LOCAL VOODOO PRIESTESS PERFORMS WATER RITUAL TO 'BIND ANCIENT EVIL'."

"Lac des Morts," Rodriguez continued, her voice devoid of inflection. "Lake of the Dead. According to local records, it was a site of voodoo ceremonies dating back to the 1800s. The priestess mentioned in that article? Lucille Thibodaux. She claimed she bound some kind of water spirit to protect her community."

Lucille Thibodaux. The name resonated deep within me, a disorienting echo from childhood. I'd heard it before, whispered in hushed family stories, dismissed as old superstition. My great-great-grandmother's name. It was like a forgotten key turning in a lock I didn't know existed, suddenly, violently.

"Detective," I said slowly, the words feeling foreign on my tongue, but laced with a dawning certainty, Am I being held here? Can I go now?" 

She looked at me with a sense of hesitation, but sighed heavily before standing up from her chair and opening the door before facing me with a concerned stare. 

"Yes. You can go. But, we need you to stay put. This isn't the last of our chit chats. Would you like officer Burton to take you home, or is there someone you want us to call?" 

"I.... Yes, ma'am. Can you call my grandmother? "

Two hours later, I sat in my grandmother's kitchen, the familiar scent of peppermint now mingled with dried herbs and generations of unspoken secrets.

"Lucille was my grandmother," she said, her weathered hands wrapped around a steaming mug, her voice low and resonant, carrying the weight of ages. "And she was more than just some local priestess, chèr. She was a guardian. The Thibodaux women, we carry the old blood. The power to bind what should not be free."

She shuffled to an old cedar chest, its dark wood smelling of dust and centuries. From its depths, she pulled out a leather-bound journal. 

"Lucille wrote everything down. The water spirit—Agwé Malé—it had been feeding on fear and death for centuries, a force of primal hunger. She managed to trap it in that lake, but the binding required a significant sacrifice."

My hands trembled as I turned the journal's pages, reading Lucille's careful, looping script. The ritual described was complex, demanding someone of her bloodline to maintain the binding, a constant stewardship that could never be truly broken. But there was a warning, underlined three times in faded, menacing ink: "If the spirit is moved from its prison without proper ceremony, it will be free to inhabit any vessel it chooses."

"Grandma," I managed, my voice hoarse, "Sterling moved the statue. Does that mean—"

"Oui, child." Her eyes, piercing despite their age, fixed on mine with an almost painful intensity. "The moment that man pulled it from the lake, Agwé Malé was free. And now it's hunting. But why do you think it chose you to spare, hm? Why let you escape when it took your friends? Why leave you alive?"

The question, which had gnawed at me for days, now felt like a living thing, squirming in my gut. Why had I survived when KC and Justin hadn't? What made me different?

"Because you're Lucille's blood," Grandma continued, her voice softening, but with an underlying current of immense, ancient power. 

"The spirit recognizes the old power, even if you don't understand it yet. It needs you, Tommy. Needs you to complete something. A purpose that has been waiting for generations."


That evening, back in the safety of my bedroom, the feeling of being watched was no longer a vague apprehension. It was a tangible presence, a cold pressure against my skin. Every shadow seemed to writhe, every creak of the floorboards made me jump. I felt like prey, cornered in my own home. Finally, around midnight, the suffocating atmosphere became unbearable, and I decided to take a walk, desperate for fresh air.

That's when I saw him.

The homeless man who'd told us about the fence. He stood under a solitary streetlight three blocks from my house, a lone, gaunt silhouette. He wore the same tattered clothes, but his posture was unnervingly straight, too alert, and down right fucking intimidating. And when he saw me, he smiled—a cold, calculated expression that had nothing to do with the rambling vagrant we'd encountered before. It was a serpent's smile.

"Hello, Tommy," he said, his voice now clear, educated. It sliced through the night's stillness. "I've been waiting for you."
