Hi. This is my first posting on reddit so a little nervous here. I have been paranoid the last 3 years since the incident and I just wanted to share. 

Three years ago, I was a 15 years old girl, studing for my 10th board exams in India.
 It was the covid pandemic era and I think the second wave was about to leave India. There was a decrease in the number of patients and the Eduaction ministry of India, to my great disappointment, had just declared the 1st term CBSE 10th boards tentative schedule and portions for the exam. Was it September or October? I am not quite sure, but the offline preboard Social Science objective paper was due in two days and it was a Friday. Like all science students, I was scared of the history questions and was reading the lessons thoroughly. My brother and my (back then busy with work from home) father went for his taekwondo class at 5 p.m. and was scheduled to return around 6:15 p.m. My lovely, extroverted mother was reading the ladies' group messages of the apartment complex. I remember her saying to me," Look, the day before yesterday's shoe thief, the one who kept our shoes in the lift. Yesterday, that naughty kid had kept the Ghosh's shoes in the lift." I asked her (like any teen of fifteen, I was not interested in my neighbors), "Who again?" She replied," The ones who live on the ground floor."  


It was around 6:30 p.m. when I heard my dad and brother's voices outside with a somewhat familiar girl's voice. I am three and a half years older than my brother and growing up in an Asian community, I am like the practical nanny of my brother and simply adore him. I, excitingly, went ahead and opened the door to find the Mukherjee's daughter, Mini, there. My dad and brother had removed their shoes but didn't keep them in the shoe rack. 

Now, just to give a picture of how the scene is, my mother is an artist and has designed the interior and the exterior by herself. As a plant lover, she had kept quite a lot of plants, a shoe rack, a few designed, handcrafted souvenirs, and a nameplate that had my touch in it too. Now, was it that Mini came to our house something rare? Not at all! Being of the same age as my brother and a typical Asian daughter, any asian can relate that for anything and everything, we are the ones who deliver things from one doorstep to another. On top of that, coming from the same Bengali community, there were frequent visits. 


Coming back to the case, seeing her at the doorstep made us curious and none of us paid attention to the shoe rack, especially my dad, while keeping the shoes back. Light talks about school and well-being, like any other friendly neighbor chat started, when I, out of pure, innocent curiosity, asked her, "So, it's 6:30, going back home after playing?" I still remember her reply that gives me chills to date. She replied," No, I am going out to play now. There is still light and I was wondering if Adi", (that's my brother), "would be interested in playing with me. So I was standing here, about to press the bell when they came from the lift." Let me remind you, it's 6:30 pm, late monsoon to early autumn in a city like Bangalore. It was pitch dark already with light drizzling rain and being the corner flat of the block, it was windy and cold to the point I had my windcheater on. But back then, I didn't mind much, you know, for it was a light conversation. 


We bid her farewell and watched her go down the lift. I closed the door and went back to reading while boiling the milk on the induction and making some evening snack. It was just, just 3 minutes later, we heard a loud bang of the fire exit door outside and quickly opened the door to catch that naughty shoe thief, cause we were alert and wanted to catch the kid red-handed. But to our surprise, there was no one and the leaves of the plants outside were torn. My mother opened the shoe rack and screamed, "Our shoes! Our shoes! They are gone!" It was the most horrible evening we had that day. The entire shoe rack was just empty! 


Our screams and loud-pitched wails had alerted two Air Force families. They immediately opened the door and asked us what happened. They stationed the more-worried-about-the-shoes-than-that-of-upcoming-Monday's-exam me at home looking out, guarding the house and the rest ran barefoot up and down 13 floors only in search of 16 pairs of various kinds of shoes. My mother, exhausted from the sudden workout, miraculously found her one pair of heels kept near the fire exit door, came back home and gave me to write a 120-word long passage in the apartment's ladies' group, asking parents to take responsibility for their children. Then, she left for the security room to check the security cameras along with Captain Aruna to look for "potential boys" who could have done it. Unfortunately, other than Mini  lurking around the entrance gate, there was no other child outside. When all hope was lost by my family, a group of security asked if the missing shoes were the ones thrown on the block entrance gate shade. My dad confirmed it was ours and we retrieved them. 


Just when we declared we found them, the Mukherjees came to our house and I noticed how quiet Mini's footsteps were. Maybe the mishap had just increased my intuitive nature to peak, making me read between lines of every conversation and made me more observant. While they were consoling my parents for the mishap, I was asked to babysit the kids, I mean my brother and her in my room. I realized how strangely happy she was seeing our pale faces and how strangely she rummaged through my things, making a mess of my room. I kept quiet and did my job diligently but things just didn't seem right for me. At the dinner, Mom was furious at how brazenly the Mukherjees asked for patronage for the upcoming Durga Puja while consoling us. My dad exclaimed how they knew where the shoes were thrown from and where they were found even though we didn't tell anyone. My mum was way too furious to even peacefully eat dinner.

 However, I quietly pondered out how peculiar Mini's footsteps and her strange behavior were. I also thought out how her alibi did not make any sense. my brother and I, took a stopwatch and we walked across the hall of the apartment floor, and turns out it took just 7 seconds to walk. My suspicions bugged me all week long.


The day after the incident, my dad woke me up to inform us how the Mukherjees had been blackmailed by someone anonymous. The blackmail was printed and underlighted with a red pen. It mentioned that the next victim was them. It said, "Dr. Das, Mrs. Ghosh, Mr. Swaminathan and now you. Beware"

The neighbors of that floor complained how their shoes went missing and others were found kept in the lift. The houses beside them exclaimed how they often found their shoes kept in random places on the floor. The mysterious shoe thief's handiwork was only seen on floors 8th, 4th (my floor), and ground floor. No other floor complained of such.

Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, Mrs Mukherjee is a German teacher in my school.
