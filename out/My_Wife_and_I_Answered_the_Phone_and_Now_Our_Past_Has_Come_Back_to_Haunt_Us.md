We as a species are creatures of lingering regrets. 

We constantly think of the things that we didn’t do, the opportunities we missed out on, the alternatives to the choices we have made, and the haunting question of “what if”. 

I am no different, and that is what brings me here to share my experience today.

I have had a “what if” question that has persisted in my head like a broken record. It has lingered in the darkest recesses of my mind like a cockroach and has continued to fester there to the present day.

What if we had just come forward with the truth? 

The answer to this question is not for the faint of heart. 

What I am about to describe is just as much a detailed recollection of events as it is a confession. What you choose to believe is entirely up to all of you but I need the truth to be out there in order to repent.

This all started a few months ago when I began communication with the dead.

Now, this grave endeavor wasn’t in vain mind you. The main reason I entertained this idea and participated was because I was desperate.

You see, I have lost a lot of people in my life. People I wished I could see again and communicate with that were no longer here.

What I desired most was closure with my loved ones and friends, and death had taken that from me.

That is until Jane and I were cleaning our basement out one day.

We were moving some miscellaneous junk strewn about the basement to the garage for donation or the trash. It was nothing more than a typical cleaning project that neither of us wanted to do, but it had to get done.

As I was cleaning out a particular corner of the basement, I stumbled upon a box containing an ouija board.

Now, I didn’t remember ever purchasing or acquiring an ouija board, and I know for certain Jane wouldn’t have either. She was not a fan of creepy things in the slightest. 

How it ended up there was a complete mystery.

My immediate thought was to just throw it away, there was no reason for us to have it. 

It’s not that I didn’t believe in the paranormal or anything, I had an experience years ago that made me a believer. I just didn’t think it was an item that should continue to be in our household.

That is when a thought crossed my mind. One that I should have never begun to entertain the idea of.

What if I could speak with those people I never got a chance to speak with again? 

This was an idea that intrigued me at the time. 

Reconnecting with people that were once in my life and knowing that there was a life beyond death provided a strange comfort to me. 

I can’t explain it but in that moment, I felt like I was compelled to use the board a ince I had found it.

After pondering things over for a moment longer, I had made my decision. 

In hindsight, I should not have made a decision of such magnitude so recklessly but regardless, my mind was made up.

I placed the ouija board back where I had found it, pretending that I hadn’t seen it and proceeded to go about my day acting as if I hadn’t seen anything. 

Tomorrow when I got home from work and while my wife was still working, I would use the ouija board.

And that is exactly what I did.

From that day forward for months I spent that two hour time period before Jane would get home from work downstairs in the basement communicating with the deceased.

My usage of the ouija board granted me the ability of being able to talk to my mother, my father, my grandmother, my grandfather and anyone else I so desired to talk to.

We discussed the afterlife, my life, and what I had never gotten to when they were here on this soil. 

It was a relief unlike any other and I was grateful to be able to break the barrier between the living and dead to talk to my loved ones.

It began so innocently with them. All I ever intended was to talk to them and to get some closure, but it became an addiction. 

I couldn’t stop using the ouija board. 

Overtime I had started inviting random spirits to conduct a conversation with me. 

It became therapeutic for me when I would ask these spirits questions and learn about them in addition to the unknown and beyond. 

Despite my morbid fixation on conversing with the dead, I never let anything get out of hand. 

My habit was always restricted to that two hour window I had and I was always going to be in control of the situation.

Yesterday though, that all changed.

I was going about things like I normally did with the ouija board. The candles that circled me illuminated the basement as I  was called out, “Are there any spirits here, that want to communicate at this time?” 

My words echoed throughout the basement as I patiently awaited a response from beyond the grave. 

Some time had passed before the planchette I had my hands placed over began to shake. Slowly, it moved over to the word “Yes”.

I nodded my head and inquired, “Who am I speaking to?”
 
Once more the planchette began to move and glided over the letters “G”, “R”, “A”, “C”, and “E”.

I felt myself grow cold as if I had stepped in foot into a meat locker. My eyes widened in horror. That name…

“Grace? Why are you communicating with me?”

My words hung in the air like a fog as I anxiously waited for the spirit to answer. I could feel my heart pulsating very fast and I did my best to take deep breathes to slow its frantic pace.

A moment later, the planchette moved to a series of letters that spelled out the word “return”.

“Return? What do you mean by this?” I inquired, my eyes darting around in the darkness surrounding the candles I had lit.

Silence overcast the basement and nothing was heard besides the thunderous thumping of my heart. 

I had never experienced anything like this in the months I had used the ouija board. I had never felt such an ominous and dark energy that contaminated the room like a plague.

I glanced back down at the planchette, wondering if there was ever going to be a response when a gust of wind snuffed out the candles. 

I blindly looked around, the darkness enveloping my vision as I felt the perspiration form on my forehead from fright. 

It felt like I was being watched but by who, I could not tell. It was a feeling that lurked as I felt an icy, cold hand grip my shoulder. 

I stood still as a statue, rooted to the spot in horror as a voice whispered a command into my ear. 

“Run.”

That’s when my adrenaline kicked in and I bolted up the stairs. I closed the basement door behind me and went up to Jane and I’s room to hide and calm down. 

I didn’t move from my place in our bedroom until Jane had come home from work. 

I didn’t dare tell her what had occurred, the last thing I wanted her to feel was unsafe and scared in the comfort of our home. 

I collected myself and went downstairs to greet her and resumed the evening like it was any other. 

When it was time to call it a night, I waited for her to go upstairs before going back down and hiding the ouija board. 

I would take care of its disposal in the morning while Jane still slept. In the meantime however,  I was going to catch some much needed rest and put this whole bizarre fixation of mine behind me.

I promised myself from that moment onward that I would never communicate with the dead ever again. 

My weird addiction to the ouija board had to end for the sake of my sanity and well-being

-

The room was painfully quiet in the early hours of the morning, almost as if time itself had stopped entirely. 

Darkness cloaked the room like a massive blanket as I lay next to Jane. A faint light creeped in through the window, allowing for little visibility of the various pieces of furniture in the bedroom.

My eyes scanned the room for a moment for any anomalies before resting my gaze upon her. She was still sound asleep, her breathing rhythmic as she continued to dream in peace. 

Her arms were wrapped around me lightly like vines on a tree trunk. I slowly wiggled free from her grasp and rolled on my side. 

I was still in a dazed state, my eyelids fighting a losing battle to stay open as I became self-aware of my heart beating against my rib cage. It thudded rapidly, like I had just been engulfed in a nightmare. 

I couldn’t remember if I had been dreaming or not but it must not have been important if I couldn’t remember, right? 

That’s what I told myself as I closed my eyes and wrapped myself back into the sheets like a cocoon. 

I lay still for a while, waiting for sleep to overtake my conscious. When it seemed as though I was about to doze off, my cell phone that was on my night side table lit up like a Christmas tree and began to ring. 

The vibration of the device buzzing on the table grated my eardrums as I let out a groan of frustration.

I sluggishly reached out and silenced the phone without even acknowledging who it was. I turned to my wife to see if she had stirred at all but thankfully to my delight, she had not been ripped from her slumber. 

I breathed a sigh of relief as I looked at the time, 3:03 am. 

“Give me a break.” I muttered irritably to myself as I turned back over hoping to get some sleep. The idea of having to go to work on just a couple hours of sleep was not a pleasant thought. 

The last thing I wanted to do was daydream about dreaming.

I closed my eyes and tried my best to silence my thoughts but not even a moment after I had nestled into the warm embrace of the sheets, the phone rang again. 

My eyes shot open and I lunged out into the void of darkness to silence the phone. 

“Good God, can I just get some rest?” I buried my head under the blanket and face planted into the pillow, not wanting to think, see, or hear anything until 6 am sharp when I absolutely had to be awake. 

The sound of my phone going off seconds after my face connected with the pillow indicated that someone was still trying to get in touch with me. 

I begrudgingly lifted my face from the pillow and squinted to look at my phone which shone like a beacon of light on the bedside table. 

I exhaled angrily as I yanked the phone from its place on the table and stared down at the screen. 

My heart immediately sunk as I read the name of the person who was vehemently blowing up my phone. 

Grace. It was the same name that was spelt out on the ouija board earlier. 

I was confused, how was a spirit contacting me outside of the board? Was this the spirit that I thought it was?

I chalked it up to it all being a strange coincidence and put that dreadful thought to rest.

I hit decline on the call and not even a second after I did, the phone began to ring again. 

This person doesn’t give up, I thought as I pressed decline call. 

The phone lit up and hummed violently as Grace continued to call again and again. 

I promptly kept declining the calls as they came through and I was able to eventually block the person, resulting in a blissful silence falling upon the room. 

I gently placed the phone back down and was about to lay back down when I noticed Jane sitting up, looking at me in pure confusion. 

In the midst of all the chaos, I neglected the fact that the constant noise of my phone and I would have woken her.

“What is going on?” She asked as a yawn escaped her lips. 

“Nothing Jane, it was just some stupid scam caller or something. I took care of it.” I reassured as I returned to my place beside her in the comfort of our bed. 

As soon as she and I began to get comfortable, the familiar humming sound filled the air indicating that my phone was going off.

“Apparently you didn’t.” She quipped as I snatched the phone from its resting place and messed with its settings. 

I was perplexed. I had blocked this person, so how was the same number calling? I decided to take matters a step further and turn my phone off. 

I held the power button on my phone and watched the brand logo light up on the screen before dimming and blacking out completely. 

“There. Now I did..” I breathed a sigh of relief as I returned to Jane’s side and gave a light smile. “That was way more complicated than it needed to be.”

We shared a laugh as we both lay on our backs and snuggled together under the sheets. 

“I noticed. Seems like you got a stalker.” She teased as she wrapped her arms around my torso and placed her head on my chest. 

“Who wants to stalk someone like me though?” 

“I don’t know, you tell me?” She raised her head to look me in the face and raised a slight brow jokingly. 

In that moment, I wanted to tell her the person’s name but decided it was better to withhold the information. 

There was no need to bother her with something as small as a name in the grand scheme of things.

Before I could give a reply to her question though, my phone rang yet again. 

This time Jane and I both sat straight up in bed, immediately alarmed at what we were hearing.

“You…you turned that off right?” She asked with a  concerned tone, her face peering over at my bedside table.

“Yeah! I…I turned the phone off. Did you not see me turn the phone off?” I felt like my arms weighed a thousand tons and my fingers shook as I took the phone and brought it to my face. 

I stood there and just stared at the brightly lit screen, the name Grace striking fear into my heart. 

“Grace? Who is this Grace and why is she calling you? It’s three in the morning.” Jane said, clearly agitated and suspicious of the fact that another woman was calling me in the early hours of the morning. 

“I don’t know, but I’m going to answer and figure out what the meaning of this is.” I pressed accept on the phone call and brought it it up to my ear.

“Listen, I don’t know who you think you are but-“ I was interrupted by a burst of static that sounded like a radio trying to find a proper frequency. 

“Hello? Is anybody there?” I asked as I glanced over my shoulder at Jane who appeared to be a nervous wreck. 

She looked how I felt internally but I needed to be strong for her. I didn’t want to look scared, but it was hard not to be. This whole thing was certainly strange..

“Put it on speaker.” Her voice trembled with a worried tone. I nodded my head and pulled the phone away from my ear. 

I pressed the speaker button and we both listened with racing hearts as the static continued to blare. This noise persisted for a while before a faint voice crept through.

“Hello?” The voice was weak but there was no mistaking it, someone was on the line.

“Yes? Hello? Who is this? How did you get my number?” The questions poured out of me at a rapid fire pace as I was trying to rationalize the scenario we found ourselves in. 

There was no response to anything I asked and instead we were left to listen to the static deafeningly sounded from the speaker. 

The moments we spent waiting for a response seemed to drag on in dog years but eventually the voice returned, this time much clearer.

“This..is…Grace.” I felt my blood turn to ice. Every word pierced my skin like a hunting knife as I looked over at Jane who shared the same horrified expression as myself. 

I felt my grip loosening on the phone as the world seemingly spun around me. This couldn’t be real, none of this is real.

“Leave us alone!” Jane’s voice broke the silence between the two of us. She seized the phone from what little grasp I still had and tried to decline the call. 

No matter how many times she attempted to hang up though, the call would not end. If anything, the static sound got louder and louder forcing Jane and I to cover our ears. 

As quickly as the static noise raised itself to ear-piercing decibels, it stopped. 

Jane and I were afraid to breathe as we listened to the phone for any signs of life besides our own.

I could feel my limbs trembling from the fear and adrenaline. I was afraid to move in any capacity.

I clenched my eyes shut and prayed for this to end. I could feel Jane’s face hovering above my shoulder and I could hear her trying to stifle cries of terror. 

The silence on the other end of the line was somehow more deafening than the static coming through just moments ago. 

It was not to last however as the voice returned and spoke clear as day from the other end of the line.

“I’m here.” The voice stated in an aggressive rasp before the phone call suddenly ended and the screen went to black. 

Jane and I sat in the darkness, paralyzed by our own fear. We weren’t sure of what to make of what had just happened. It was like a piece of fiction had come to life. There was nothing fictitious about this however. 

This was the gravity of the situation coming crashing down upon us. There was a reason why that name had sounded so familiar earlier downstairs with the ouija board.

The voice on the phone all but confirmed our suspicions. She and I locked eyes in horror and I felt myself shiver at the revelation.

The spirit from the ouija board and the voice on the phone were the same entity.

It was Grace, our daughter we had killed ten years ago.
