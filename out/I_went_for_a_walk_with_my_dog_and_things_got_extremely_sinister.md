“Do you wanna go for a walk?” I said to my dog Pibbles. She is a corgi and is about 4 years old. Everyday I take her for a walk and it is always a positive thing for both of us, it exercises her and makes me feel happy. So a win win.

Her ears perked up when I said that and she tilted her head. “Ruff!” That bark was deafening and I could tell that she really wants to go for one.

“Alright Pibbs, we will go.” I grab her leash and head out the door. The walks are usually the same old, smelling around and going potty everywhere. But this time…was different. She  didn’t go pee or poop at all which was odd to me since she had been holding it in all day because I was gone at school and my brother and mom were out working. 

“Alright, I guess you don’t have to go potty then.” I say to her. As we are walking I notice something strange happen with Pibbs. She started to whine and growl like someone or should I say something, was watching us. Obviously freaked out by this I start to pick up my pace and start to pull her a little harder to move faster and get the hell out of what was after us.

But when I pulled, Pibbles stayed. Still growling and still whining like a hurt hyena. “Never seen her do that before.” I said to myself in a shaky tone. 

A few seconds later, maybe 30 she stopped growling and whining and started smiling like her normal happy self does when she goes on walks. “What the fuck was that?!” I mutter out. 

“NOTHING” it’s a whisper of what sounds like a girl in the bushes right next to me on the sidewalk we are walking on. “Ah hell no.” I yell out in fear and start sprinting away while Pibbles does too. I guess she noticed my fear too. 

“ITS OK, IM NOT GONNA HURT YOU. I ONLY WANT TO BE YOUR BEST FRIEND FOREVER.” The same whispering voice says. “What the fuck.” I say in a panic. “Who are you and what the hell do you want from me.” “Also how the fuck did you catch up to me so fast without me noticing?”

“Hehehe.” This time the whisper turns real loud. “Hahaha.” The laughing was creepy and almost sounded like she was laughing but also crying at the same time. “What the fuck is so funny!?”

The same laughing over and over again occurred and I couldn’t take it any longer so I just sprinted again to get the hell out of there. Who the hell was that? Was that a ghost? How did they catch up to me so fast? What do they want? All these questions rushed into my head as I started to hyperventilate with fear.

I am 18 and an adult male and still was to the point of almost crying from fear. The female disembodied voice vanished and was gone now, or so I hoped. 

Me and Pibbles cut off into this neighbourhood that we always go to for the daily walks we go on and it’s basically a u-turn to get back home. We are walking and nothing else happens.

Well, until…

Until, I see a cardboard sign laying in the middle of the road. Going up to it in a slow and fearful manner, I pick it up.

“Go on and have fun on your walk. Be my guest, and go hide that lock. But don’t be mad when you are eaten, by a hawk.” The sign read.

“The fuck is this shit.” I said giggling. Probably some corny teenagers messing around and trying to scare an old lady or something.

“Click. Click. Click. Click.” 

It was low but still audible to hear. It was coming from underneath this bridge. “Pibbles it’s ok.” 

We walk over there to the noise and it stops. Another sign is seen lying on the ground. 

“I told you that you should hide the lock.” The sign reads. “What is this twisted bullshit.” I say in anger and annoyance. I was thinking about heading back home but I was to close to solving this weird mystery that I couldn’t leave, not matter how hard I wanted to and knew I had to.

I hear the same clicking noise again. “Click. Click. Click.” “Whoever is here, fucking show yourself.” 
 
This is when Pibbles started to growl and whine like crazy, like she was on the verge of death.

“LOOK UP BY THE BRIDGE.” The same whispering girls voice from early says. This time right into my ear.

I try to hold back the urge not to look, but I just had to. I look up and what I saw was, was…horrifying.

2 dogs, an old lady, a man, and a little girl. All of them, hanging and dangling down from the bridge. It wasn’t a noose though that they were being hanged by, it was a leash, a fucking dog leash.

“Come on Pibbles. Let’s get the hell out of here! NOW!!” I scream with a fearful tone but also a crying and cracking voice. 

I ran all the way back home with Pibbles without stopping the whole way. No more whispering voices were heard the way back and no more twisted signs were lying in the middle of the road. 

When I got home though, I noticed something peaking out from underneath the doormat at the entrance of my house. A pink slip that was no bigger than a post it note.

“I told you about the lock, now you will be eaten by the hawk.” Is what was written on the slip and this time, all in blood.

I went inside and slammed the door shut locking all the doors and shutting all my blinds. Pibbles stopped with the growling and whining and sat on my bed in my room. My mom rushed in my room in a panic and said, “that was way too long and you worried me to death.” “What happened.”

I told everything that happened and everything I saw and she said to immediately call the police. I did that and told the operator everything as well. 

The next morning the cops knocked at my door and said that no one was caught but the bodies hanged under the bridge have been taken and were confirmed to be that of a family. A grandma, her son, the son’s daughter, and their two pet dogs. 

The mom died a while back from hanging herself by sui**de. So the grandma moved in with her son as well as the granddaughter, and they brought their two dogs as comfort from her tragic death.

I have the theory that what happened was some sort of twisted and evil ritual. But I have no idea.

I mean who was that lady? Whose voice was whispering? What does the hawk have to do with anything? Why torment people who are going on walks and enjoying their day? All these questions that have no answers. 

So to this day, I will never take any dog, I mean any dog, for a walk again.
