I knew from the start that going to the donkey show was going to be a bad idea.  Heloise just laughed at me.  Told me it wasn’t what I thought.  It was just an inside joke that she could better explain once I’d been there.  It wasn’t that I didn’t trust her…not exactly…but I knew she could be mean with her jokes, and I wasn’t sure this one was being played on me.  Still, we’d only been dating six months and I didn’t want to fight about it or seem unwilling to try new things.

Instead of being at the back of some seedy dive bar or even in a fancier establishment like she normally took me, the donkey show was in a gated residential community with million dollar houses and European cars in every driveway.  Not as nice as where Hel lived, but way richer than anything I’d ever seen before dating her.  

The show was in a massive stucco house at the back of one of the cul-de-sacs, and aside from the location, I found myself surprised that there weren’t more cars there.  Just two in the driveway, like most of the other houses in the area.  I asked her if there was some mistake as she parked next to the cars.  She laughed and told me no, this was how they always did the shows.  They’d rent a nice house in a quiet neighborhood for a few days or weeks, and have guests come one or two at a time.  She leaned in, giving me a smile.  It was all very exclusive and expensive, she assured me.  Very private.

Fighting back the urge to ask more questions, I followed her up to the front door.  Before she could even knock, a short, sallow man in a three-piece suit opened the door and ushered us inside before closing the door and handing us each an identical printed card.  It read:

*Please do not speak or make any unnecessary noise while in this home.  It disturbs the subject, and may reduce the potency of your experience.*

The man took us upstairs to a bedroom where a woman and another man were standing over a bed where an older gentleman lay.  He was naked and breathing shallowly, but otherwise I would have mistaken him for dead.  Confused panic began to set in and I looked at Hel and then our guide.  Giving a smiling nod, Heloise led me over to the empty chair next to the bed and sat me down, gently putting my hand on that of the unconscious man.

Everything suddenly went gray for a moment, and I only fully came back to myself when the other woman removed it.  As I stood up, I thought I saw something dark move under the unconscious man.  Something that was looking out at me curiously.  Shuddering, I let myself be led from the house.  It wasn’t until we were in the car that I realized two hours had passed.

“What the fuck was that?”

Hel laughed loudly.  “How do you feel?”

I frowned.  “Feel?  I feel…well, I feel pretty great actually.  But what was any of that?”

She shrugged and gave me a grin.  “It’s the donkey show!”  When I didn’t return her smile, she grew more serious.  “Okay.  So it’s called the donkey show as a play on Don Quixote.  You ever read it?”

“I don’t know.  Some in high school I think.”

“Well, the idea is that Don Quixote is the older dude that wants to be this big hero and imagine the world as this great romantic ideal.  When in truth, he’s a crazy fuck-up and the world is shit.”

I stared at her.  “Okay.”

She rolled her eyes.  “So…that guy on the bed gets paid a lot of money to spend a few weeks living out his dreams.  And when he’s like that, people can come in and get some of his mojo.  It likes gives you this real boost of confidence and well-being and happiness.”  Her eyes widened as she smiled again.  “Don’t you feel it?  I can tell you do.”

I nodded slowly.  “I mean…I do…I just…so the guy just gets a good dream?  How do they do that?  How do they make sure they have good dreams and how would they give any of that happiness to me?”  Swallowing, I added.  “I thought I saw something in there too.  Something under him, looking at me.  Was that real?”

Heloise shifted uncomfortably as she turned to put the car in reverse.  “I don’t know all the details of that.  It doesn’t matter.  It’s safe.  Like half my family has done it before.”


“It’s safe?  It doesn’t matter?  What kind of idiot are you?”

She glared at me as she started driving away from the house.  “Look, I did it as a present or whatever and so you’d stop being such a pussy about everything.  I didn’t order the ‘alpha asshole’ package though.”

I held her gaze.  “You tricked me into doing something to that guy.  Something bad.  How are they doing it?  I don’t see how its science, because I sure as shit didn’t see any computers or wires or medicine.  So what is it, Heloise?”

Looking back at the road, she was quiet for several moments as she turned out of the neighborhood.  “I don’t know, okay?  Not really.  I went the first time when I was sixteen.  My Dad arranged it.  I was in a really bad place before that, and…well, it turned me around.”  She glanced at me, her expression anxious.  “I’ve only done it a couple of times since.  Like a booster shot, right?”

Shaking my head, I looked out at the darkening road.  She was right about the effects.  I was angry and scared, but I was also way more confident and self-assured now.  And she was going to tell me more whether she wanted to or not.  I forced my voice to stay even when I spoke next.

“Why do they call it a donkey show, Hel?  How is that guy like Don Quixote if he’s just living some dream of being a big hero?”

She let out a sigh.  “It’s not a dream for him.  It’s like he’s living a version of his life in those days or weeks, but it’s just like the best version, you know?  Everything he ever wanted, he can see it and have it.  He’s the hero in his own story.”

“And?”

“And…well, every time someone touches him for a show, it takes part of that away from him.  Shows him how he’s failed in this or that, or how what he thought he’d accomplished, it wasn’t really real.”

“That’s horrible.  But how does it make sense?  If he started failing at this big important stuff in his dream or whatever it is, wouldn’t he just give up and be sad about what he lost?”

Her hands were trembling on the steering wheel now.  “It doesn’t work like that for them.  They *can’t* stop.  It makes them still believe they can get it all back.  And it feeds on their sadness and fear the same way we feed on their positive stuff.  They keep getting pulled back and forth between getting stuff and losing it until…”  She drifted off.

“Until what, Hel?”

She shrugged again.  “I don’t know.  Until they’ve earned their money.  Or until they’re burned out and it doesn’t work anymore.”

“Tell me what the fuck that thing is that’s feeding on him.”

There were tears in her eyes as she looked back at me this time.  “I, I really don’t know.  And I know not to ask.  These aren’t things you fuck around with.  You’ve got a high right now, but in time you’ll see what I mean.”

“What happens to the people they use?  The donkeys?  Once they’re done with them?  Are they okay after that?”

Wiping at her eyes with the back of her hand, she gave a watery laugh.  “Fuck, how would I know?  Some probably are, yeah.  I know my brother Kenny stopped doing it because he heard a lot of them…well, a lot of them kill themselves after.  It breaks them or something.”  She sniffed.  “But they’re really well-paid, and at least their families get all that mo-“

“Stop the car.”

“What?  I’m not stopping the car in the middle of…”

Unbuckling my seatbelt, I leaned closer.  “I said stop the fucking car, you piece of shit.  I’ll walk.”

Letting out a startled gasp, she slammed on the brakes.  She was right, this was the middle of nowhere, but I didn’t care.  As I got out, Heloise yelled after me.  “Don’t think I’m coming back to pick you up, asshole.  We are fucking done!”

I stared at her.  “No shit.”  Turning, I started walking down the road.  I thought there was a gas station or something like five miles further up.  The cold night air blew past me as Hel sped away, but I barely noticed.  I was deep in my own thoughts all the way until I reached the lights of the gas pumps.

That was a month ago.  That night I almost went back to the house.  Barged in and tried to rescue the guy or something.  But whatever he’d given me had made me happy and confident, not stupid.  I didn’t want to risk my life for a stranger than may not even want to be rescued, and ironically, it was what he’d given me that made it easier for me to leave him behind.

I had so many plans now.  So much I could do.  And I hadn’t known what I was getting when I went to the show, had I?  What I was taking from him or putting him through.  I was just trying to impress a girl.  I’m not like her.  Not like them.  Not like…not like whatever it was that looked at me from underneath that poor man’s pale flesh.  

Looked at me with curiosity…and maybe recognition of its own kind.

But no, that’s bullshit.  I’m not like them.  I’m just trying to be happy and get ahead, and if people are sad because of my success or even get hurt as a byproduct of it, that’s not my fault is it?  It’s not like I’m feeding off it.

I’m not like it.
