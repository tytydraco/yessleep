I never wanted to share this story. It still haunts me.  
When I moved into the house, it felt like a blessing — a huge, secluded property, absurdly underpriced. At the time, I didn’t question it. I thought I was lucky. Maybe the previous owner was in a rush, needed to sell. I figured someone else's loss was my gain.

The house stood alone, surrounded by miles of whispering pine and shadow. No neighbors. No traffic. Just me and the wind.  
It was lifted off the ground — not uncommon for old country homes — with about three feet of crawlspace underneath. I barely gave it a second thought.

The quiet suited me. I’ve always been the solitary type. But over the weeks, something about the silence grew… heavier. Not peaceful — oppressive. Like the forest held its breath whenever I stepped outside. And the house, for all its openness, started to feel cramped. Claustrophobic.

In the house, I heard scratching. Breathing. Sometimes whispers. Always from beneath the floor. I'd wake drenched in sweat, the sound of something *shifting* below still ringing in my ears. I convinced myself it was animals. Maybe raccoons.

But the smell was no animal.

It started faint — a sickly sweet rot that drifted up through the floorboards. I cleaned. I aired the place out. I checked the crawlspace once — just once — during daylight. All I saw was dirt and shadows. But I heard something move, and I backed out, heart pounding.

Then things went missing. Small at first: my lighter, a sock, a spoon. I thought I was losing my mind. Then a knife vanished from the kitchen.

I locked every door that night.

The next morning, I found muddy footprints inside the hallway. Barefoot. Leading from the crawlspace hatch to my bedroom. And back.

The police came, shrugged, took a report. "Probably a drifter," they said. "Or wildlife." They didn’t check under the house. Said it was probably nothing.

I *knew* something was down there.

I set up a camera facing the crawlspace hatch inside. That night, I didn’t sleep. I waited, clutching a baseball bat. At 3:12 AM, the camera clicked — motion detected.

I watched the footage the next morning.

A pale figure emerged from the hatch. Thin, filthy. Eyes wide with hunger. It crept to my bedroom door, stood there watching me sleep for almost two full minutes. Then it crawled back down. Like it was *waiting*.

I ran. Straight to the sheriff. This time, they brought dogs and backup. They opened the hatch.

The dogs wouldn’t go down.

What they found…

There were five bodies. All men. All missing from nearby towns over the past few years. All mutilated. And all placed in neat rows under the house. Like trophies. Like *warnings*.

But they didn’t find him.

He was gone.

And now I live behind deadbolts, always with a weapon close. Because I don’t think he was hiding bodies there. I think he was *saving space*.

And I was supposed to be the sixth.

I'm sharing this story as a risk he's still after me, I don't know what to do The police can't find him, but I know he's watching me all the time. When I'm alone, I feel his eyes on me. I tried moving out of the house, but my money's tight and no one wants to buy the house. I'm in danger
