I woke up, rolled over, and hit snooze on my alarm. "7:45 AM," it read. The brightness blinded me, the digital sun flashing across my vision, until I closed my eyes, and my phone turned off. The headache was insufferable. 



"Shit," I muttered. I was late for class, again.



My roommates had all moved out, and I was looking for potential people to move in. The place was getting too expensive to pay each month, and a new roommate would have helped drastically. I painstakingly got out of bed and slipped on my indoor shoes, an old pair of worn and scarred slippers, the red they once were fading and appearing more washed pink than anything resembling the strawberry tint they once glowed. Dragging my feet across the puke-stained carpet and down the stairs to the first floor, I reached for a mug and placed it underneath the coffee-maker's nozzle. A note was stuck to the top of the silver machine. I hadn't remembered seeing it before. I picked it up and read, with no hesitation.



"Careful :)"



I stood for minutes, just staring at the note, forgetting I had pressed the pour button before reading. The purely black liquid dripped from the mug onto my hand, and I dropped the note as it burned me, also spilling onto the note. I watched it disintegrate in front of my cup, in sugarless, milkless coffee. I shrugged it off, probably drunkenly placed it there as I had gotten extremely hungover the previous night, Sunday. I went about my day, not thinking about the note I had found earlier, and I shrugged it off, completely.



Until the next day



Another note, this time on my lamp. "You Shouldn't Know." I froze, to the point of shivering. Looking like a deer blinded by headlights, the text was underlined furiously. What would you do if you found notes in your home that you didn't place? I had nobody to turn to. I jumped up and started pacing around my house, checking every place someone, or something, could be. There were no signs of any intrusion, the door was locked, the windows too, and the attic was even shut - not that anyone would be able to get through it anyway, it was high up, and if you had dropped down, there would have been visible signs, damage to the floor. Fuck, I even checked my closet like you would if you were a child, scared of monsters. Except I was an adult, and I knew there were no monsters in this world. No amount of checking would bring anything up, there genuinely was nothing. Throughout the day, during lecture and at work, that note crept up in my mind like an unwanted memory from too long ago. An uninvited guest, just showing up at the worst time, at YOUR worst time. Truthfully it  spooked me. I tossed and turned that night in my bed, like angst had taken over my entire body, waiting for something to happen, until nothing did. I fell asleep. I woke up, before my alarm even went off, it was 5:45 AM. I clicked on my lamp and as I did there was a note, on the switch. 



"You Checked" 

"Is this a game," I thought. Mentally grasping at straws trying to explain to myself why it was happening. Just like I did the previous night, I went through everything. This time, the living room carpet. It was stepped muddy. The green carpet resembled a grass patch right after rain, dirty and a stain in an otherwise perfectly clean house and room. Like a reject standing out in a busy crowd, an outlier amongst the norm. A note, against the fridge, like a mother would when you were younger.



"Y o u N e v e r L e a r n"

What the fuck, I muttered. Why was this happening? I couldn't take this anymore. I tore my house apart. My furniture was knocked over, plates shattered, the broken porcelain covering the ground like sea over sand during high tide. I went back to sleep, and the notes were gone. Everything was fine. I had no lectures, and took off work that day. Figured I deserved a break. For once in this never ending week. A repetitive cycle, it crushed me, though I would never admit it. 



The following day, my room was covered in notes. All stuck to the wall. Scribbles small but so much. I stood up, shaking, into my bathroom. The notes on the mirror all the same, "You did this. Y o u m u s t f a c e i t." I hit the mirror, my hands bled a dry, dark red substance, running all over my shaking hands as they trembled from pain. Inside another note.



"Meds 9:00!"

I stared.

They must have forgot.
