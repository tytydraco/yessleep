Something’s wrong. Everything feels real. Too real. But my family keeps saying it’s in my head. I try to believe them. I try. But I know something’s happening.

It started with my wife’s whistling. The same tune every time she cooked. Always the same. I don’t remember the name, but it was soft, easy. She said it helped her focus. A little good luck ritual or something. Then this morning, she changed it. Off-key, jarring, like nails on glass. I didn’t want to say anything. Didn’t want to make a thing of it. But I couldn’t focus on anything else. It was wrong. Just wrong. Thank God she served dinner, and it stopped.

Next day. It happens again. The tune isn’t a tune anymore. It’s random, chaotic. I finally break. Ask her why she changed it.

She stares at me. Blank.

“What are you talking about?” she says. “I’ve always whistled the same tune.”

Ice in my veins. Full stop. A nervous laugh. Go back to what I was doing. Try not to think about it. Try not to.

My son comes home. My wife’s still whistling. I grab him. Ask if he notices.

“What? It’s the same damn song she’s always whistled. If anything, I wish she’d change it up.”

Another hit. Blood freezing again. Am I losing my mind?

Three days. I try to ignore it. It’s just the melody. Just a stupid melody. Then, on the fourth day, her voice changes. Lower. Rough. Like she’s been smoking two packs a day. Over dinner, I ask if she has a sore throat.

Blank stares. My son rolls his eyes. My wife laughs. “Oh wow, you’re exhausted. You need to take a break.”

The kids laugh too. Like it’s funny. Like I’m the joke.

So I laugh with them. Ha. Ha. Ha.

The next week, it’s not just the whistling. It’s not just her voice. Now it’s my kids.

My kids. My brown-haired kids. They walk in, and their hair is blonde. Bright blonde. Golden wheat blonde.

Shock. Whiplash. Ask my wife if she let them dye it without telling me.

Hand on my forehead. Concerned eyes. “Honey, I’m really starting to worry. You should see someone.”

Push her hand away. Demand answers. She looks at me like I’m crazy. “What are you talking about? They’ve always been blonde.”

I book a session with my therapist. The one who helped me through depression two years ago. I get there, go to shake his hand.

No hand.

His right arm is gone. Just a stump.

I freeze. Stare. His face hardens. “I lost it in an accident when I was five. You know this.”

No. No, I don’t. I don’t know this. I see him. I see him shaking my hand after every session. Right hand. Firm grip.

He leans forward. “We’ve talked about this before. I’ve even compared it to your self-esteem issues.”

My mind is burning out. Melting down. He gives me meds. Says it’s stress. It’s all stress. I take them. Not because I believe him, but because I have no other choice.

Two weeks. My wife still whistles that awful song. Her voice still belongs to someone else. My kids are still blonde.

Then my daughter comes home from school. Same backpack. Same clothes. Same face.

Except for the teeth.

Short. Crooked. Tiny little gaps between them. Not her perfect, straight smile. Not her teeth.

And she laughs. Opens her mouth wide, stretching, stretching, stretching. Shows them off. Smiles like nothing’s wrong.

I lose it. Interrupt her. “What happened to your teeth?”

Silence. Stares.

My daughter bursts into tears. My wife rushes to her. Shoots me a look so sharp it could cut glass. My son stays behind. Glares at me. “What the hell is wrong with you? She’s had that since she was born. You know this.”

No. No, I don’t.

I sink onto the couch. Open-mouthed. Staring into space. Then it hits me. **The photos.**

Rush to the walls. To the frames. My hands shake as I reach for them.

Blonde kids. Her awful teeth.

I black out.

My wife says I was out for four hours.

I wake up. My son sits beside me. Arms crossed. Staring. He doesn’t blink. Minutes pass. He doesn’t blink.

“Thomas, why are you looking at me like that?”

Silence.

“If this is about your sister, I’m sorry.”

He laughs. But it’s not a laugh. It’s a shrill, choking sound. His body twitches, convulses. He slams his fists against the chair over and over and over.

My wife bursts into the room, hands out, pleading. “Thomas, calm down, baby, everything’s fine.”

He quiets. But still, he stares. Stares at me.

My daughter runs in. Hands on her head. “Oh my God, I’m sorry!”

My wife spins on her, furious. “Marie! You know you’re not supposed to leave the door open! You know what happens!”

What happens? What happens?

I snap. “What the hell is going on?”

Marie looks at me. Like I’m stupid. Like I’m not real. “Dad, you work too much. You don’t pay attention. He’s always been like this.”

Like what?

“Autistic,” she says. “You know this.”

No. No, I don’t.

And that’s where I am now. Living with a wife whose voice is wrong. A daughter whose smile isn’t hers. A son who twitches and grins at me like a stranger.

They all look at me like I’m the insane one.

But I started searching. Digging.

And I’m not alone. There are others. Others who’ve noticed the shifts. The wrong notes in the melodies. The misplaced hands. The family members that morph overnight.

Something is happening. Something is changing us. Quietly. Silently.

So pay attention. Notice the small things. The little changes.

Or one day, you’ll wake up surrounded by strangers.
