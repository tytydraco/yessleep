This entire thing has honestly been so weird. My initial thoughts were that it was nothing more than a simple malfunction, but as things progressed, it became very clear that wasn’t the case. 

Last week, I purchased one of those robotic vacuum cleaners - you know, the little round-shaped self-cleaning machines which roam around the house? My sister got one a couple of months ago and had been bugging me ever since to get one, so I thought I’d give it a try. I installed it, and for the first few days, it was working just fine, except when it would get stuck on random stuff sprawled across the floor - my slippers being the most frequent victim, which I had to put out of the way - or occasionally drapes. When it did, it would make this harsh grinding sound. For those of you who don't know what it's like, think of a typical grinder in your kitchen, but much more unpleasant. 

It all started two days ago. 

I was emptying the dirt compartment - or whatever you call it - and while I always find a few strands of hair, that day, I found *black* hair. Quite normal, right? Unless you know I am a blonde, and I live by myself. Another thing - it was pretty long, definitely longer than my own chin-length hair. I tried my best to think back, but no one, regardless of hair color or length, had visited my place in like a week or so. I did find it weird, but I shrugged it off. 

That night, I was just chilling on the couch while the robot was doing its thing, and there was that loud grinding noise again. My cue that it was stuck on something, and that I needed to free it. So I made my way to where the sound was coming from, and the robot was right there. I lifted it up to put it down elsewhere, only to realize that...It hadn’t been stuck on anything. There was literally nothing on the spot it had been in a second ago. I flipped it over in my hands, and nothing was stuck under it either. The grinding noise had been quite loud. It definitely sounded like the robot had tried to clean up something it wasn’t supposed to, but then again, it was a machine. Might have randomly made the noise. 'God, is it starting to get messed up already? In *one* day?' These were the thoughts running through my mind at the time. 

Fast forward to the next day, I came back from work and was cleaning out the dirt compartment again, and there’s just one word for what I found. Gross. This time, there weren’t just a few strands of black hair, there was a whole damn *bunch*. No wonder the machine was acting up the other day. Who even can shed that much hair? If I were to hold all of it, it would probably take both of my fists. This was the point where I was starting to get concerned. I was sure there was a way to explain it, but I just couldn’t get my head around it. How the heck was my vacuum cleaner sucking up an entire bunch of black hair, out of all things? Could someone have… no, no. That wasn’t possible. Even if there was a creepy freeloader or stalker in my house, I doubted they would be shedding hair as if they were on a Dwayne Johnson look-alike challenge or something. 

I was in a dilemma that night. Should I use the robot? Or should I let it be? I finally decided to go with it. At worst, if there was something wrong with it, I would find out. So I could hear the sound of the machine cleaning in the other room, while I was on the couch like the previous night, albeit not exactly chilling. I was kind of on edge the whole time, what with the entire hair ordeal, and I was expecting to jump up if I were to hear the grinding sound. But it never came. Little robot guy didn’t get stuck on anything that night and cleaned the whole house diligently before retiring to its charging spot against the wall. It made me feel slightly more at ease.

The next day, that is also this evening, I had to gather up some courage before I could open the dirt compartment. But I did, and there was nothing there except for the usual dust and my own stray strands of blonde hair. I let out a sigh of relief before starting the machine for its cleaning round. So I was just being overly paranoid. Everything was fine, really. 

Or so I thought. 

A few hours ago, I was in the kitchen pouring myself a glass of juice, when there came the grinding sound once again. It was so loud and ear-piercing, it was almost as if the robot was trying to communicate its agony. I ran to check out what was going on, and when I did, I saw the robot being pulled along the entire floor at remarkable speed. The best way I can describe this is as if someone had tied a length of string around it and was using the other end to drag it around the whole room, while the robot was resisting with futility, all the while making that horrible grinding noise, as if it was stuck on something. 

I stepped over the threshold to intervene, and just when I did, I kid you not - the thing flew off into the air. And it wasn’t even stationary. It wasn’t even hovering on the spot. It was still being dragged around the whole room, but this time while it was in. The. Fucking. Air. I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. 

I have no idea what possessed me to try to rescue it from whatever was happening, but I did. I know I sound like a typical dumb horror movie character right now. And I agree. I was behaving like one. I should have turned right on my heel and fled the house the moment the thing was jerked into the air. But possessed by some force - panic, adrenaline, sheer stupidity, call it what you want to - I grabbed it with both hands and pulled. And pulled. And pulled some more, while the robot itself kept getting pulled in the opposite direction. It was *definitely* stuck on something. I could feel it. The tug of war continued for about thirty seconds, until I pulled really hard, gathering up all the strength I could, and lo! The robot was free and I fell back from the amount of force I was using. 

The robot fell from my hands and landed upside down on the floor next to me, and that’s when I saw it. There were long strands of black hair dangling from it, as if they had been ripped right off of someone’s head. It was almost as if the robot had got caught on someone’s *head*, not just hair, and was trying to suck it in, while the other party was trying to preserve their precious hair from this fate and was trying to pull back with all their might, dragging the robot along the floor, and later even in the air. 

I didn’t even bother to take a look around the room before I NOPED the fuck out of my apartment. Pretty sure I left the front door wide open too. I couldn’t even stay in the building and kept walking until I reached a grocery store a few minutes away, where I used the cashier’s phone to dial my sister and asked her to pick me up. She insisted on driving me back to my apartment and checking out the thing herself. She was sure there was a logical explanation, but I wasn't going to give in at any cost. I am staying the night at her house, where I am typing this from. I don’t really know if I’ll be able to step foot in the building again even in the morning.
