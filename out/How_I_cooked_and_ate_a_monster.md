So you can experience this for what it was I'll be writing my story as it happened through the years. There's a fair bit I'm leaving out, but what's important mostly takes place at the end. For that I'll add a tad more detail. And that part, well, I quite enjoy reliving in its writing, anyway. 

I'll try to keep the language flair down to a minimum, because apparently, according to my fiance, at least, I'm otherwise fairly prone to verbosity. So this'll be a lot briefer told than usual.

It was a Winter's night in 1992, and I'm 7 years old. I go to bed at 9pm after saying goodnight to my parents. 

In my bedroom down the hall there's a cluster of lego on the carpet and the walls are high and light blue. 

The distance from the lightswitch to my bed is approximately 4 metres. I close the door and flick the switch and the room goes very dark. 

I hold still a moment, and take a deep breath.

Then I rush the first three metres, and jump. The mattress springs squeak loudly when I land.

I am quickly under the covers, and safe. Once again, I have made it: the reaching arm of the thing under my bed did not have a chance to grab at my ankle.

My breath warms my body up quick. After three minutes or less I poke my head out into the cold that should have been warm. My eyes have adjusted and the blue of the walls is now a shadowed light grey. Through the windows up high I can see a cloud with a faint halo of moonlight, but I can't see any stars.

Instead, I dream about them.

It was a Winter's night in 2004 and I'm 19 years old. It's late and my new housemates have all gone to bed. I am drunk off cheap whiskey after we had celebrated my moving in to the house.

And my housemates, slightly older than I, they liked any excuse to drink. 

I go to my bedroom and flick off the lightswitch and the room goes very dark. There are swirls in the air and I can't tell if I'm seeing or feeling them, or both.

I pause a moment after I hear a sound over the traffic outside. But I am drunk. And drunks shouldn't trust their senses.

The distance to my bed is approximately 5 metres. I stumble forward and then I feel something painful but I collapse and pass out because it's very late and I am very tired, and drunk.

In the morning when I wake I feel a sharp pain down my leg. I pull back the sheets and see a terrible mess of dry and wet blood.

The scratch on my ankle is long, and deep. I go straight to the GP to get stitches, which ended up a total of 12. But the doctor, this severe looking old man, has nothing at all for my hangover.

It was a Winter's night in 2016 and I'm 31 years old. My wife is already in bed because it was her turn last night with the baby. 

My son is cooing as I rock him in my arms, and a moment ago he was crying. We named him Joel because we didn't know any other kids named Joel and my wife prefers difference over meaning.

The bedroom light is already off and there's a vague redolance of my wife's perfume in the air, which is sweet. Joel's crib is in the corner approximately 3 metres from our bed. I tuck him in and kiss him on the temple, whisper that I love him and take off my clothes before sliding into bed against the warmth of my wife. I put my arm around her and pull her in close as she squeezes my hand in her sleep.

On the edge of a dream I think I hear a sound over the traffic, but I'm too far gone to care.

In the morning I wake to a very loud scream. My wife is standing over Joel's crib crying and screaming and is too hysterical to speak. 

I jump out of bed and go to her side and my heart and throat drop heavy in an instant. 

It's hard to process what I'm seeing.

All I know in that moment is that there are speckles of blood, and Joel is no longer there.

It was a Winter's night 2019 and I'm 34 years old. My girlfriend grabbed the last of her things a few hours ago before kissing me goodbye and I am sitting at the table drinking a second glass of expensive whiskey.

Two drinks is more than enough. I go to the study and open the tall cupboard and pull back the sheet over the gear that I've collected. The cage is next to the cupboard on the floor.

It's the size of a dog kennel and doesn't feel heavy as I carry it down the hall, and place it carefully outside my bedroom.

I haven't heard the sound that it makes in exactly one year and tonight is the night that it's due. My heartbeat is fast, but I'm not concerned. The adrenaline will serve me well.

The bedroom feels empty without Helen. I leave open the door and turn off the light and take off my pants and walk slow to the bed before I stop within half a metre. I don't hear the traffic outside. I don't see the streetlight coming through and I don't feel the coldness from the open window.

All I'm aware of is the floor below, and my bare ankles.

It's 30 or so minutes before I hear its strange guttural sigh. My heart starts to pound, but I do not move. 

I take a deep breath and lower the snare pole with the retractable ring at the end.

And then, for only the second time in 27 years, I finally see it.

Its hideous thin arm is black and sparsely haired and is ended by gnarled clawed contortions of fingers. 

It reaches to grab me but I am too fast with the ring and quickly pull it tight. I yank as I pull back bringing the ghastly thing into view and kick it in the head as hard as I can and it coughes in a putter in a very strange showing of pain. It heaves strong with its caught arm and lashes wild with the other and makes a sound like a boar that ripples aggressive and deep but I'm too far out of reach; and I keep dragging it back and pick up the crowbar left next to the door in a move well-rehearsed and then yank it down and jump forward precise and swing down as hard as I can and with a deadened thump it falls limp to the floor. Its blood spreads viscous and is either dark dark red, or black. 

I pull it out into the hall and kick it with my heel again, and again, until satisfied that its completely unconscious. I then loosen the noose and roll and kick it brutally into the cage.

It was the same night in 1999 and I'm alone in a house bought with money from the divorce and I'm standing at the stove, barely holding back the grin on my face. The kitchen smells like burnt steak and is loud with the screech of some hideous thing in a cage, a deformed bloodied creature now missing an arm now skinned and chopped and sizzling in a very hot pan almost done. 

I grab cutlery and a plate and pull up a chair in front of the cage, and I sit down. I then stare pleased and content into the terrified eyes of my catch. 

I keep staring as I raise the first piece. The fork goes in, and I chew. The flavour is like salty pork, half-rotten, and can't be good for you.

The thing cowers in the corner, and averts its eyes.

"Mmm. Delicious," I believe I said.

Even though it needed a lot more garlic and rosemary.
