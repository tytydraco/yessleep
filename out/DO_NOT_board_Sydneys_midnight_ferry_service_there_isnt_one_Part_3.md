*Knock knock knock knock knock…*  


*3am…*  


*Knock knock knock knock knock…*



*4am…*  


*Knock knock knock knock knock…*  


*5am…*



*6am…*  


*7am…*

*… silence.* Finally, silence. I had not slept a wink. All hours of the night I lay there, on the cold steel bathroom floor, listening to something knocking on the door. Occasionally, I would hear it speak. Kind of. What passed for its voice floated through the gap beneath the door, mostly just gurgles and whispers, but every so often I would make out words.

*“Too late…”* it would say, in between strange slurping sounds.

*“Don’t let me go,”* I could make out, on the tail end of a growl, similar to that of a rabid dog.

During the night, in between that infernal knocking, I heard the ferry making more stops. I would note different sounds and sensations as the ferry traversed into what felt and sounded like the strangest of places. Some sounded quite similar to the rickety wooden pier we had docked at earlier in the night, but others were different. At times I would hear what sounded like giant medieval style draw bridges come crashing down, or the distant clang of an anchor hitting the bottom of the river, followed by scratching noises as though things were clawing their way up the sides of the boat, following by wet footfalls making their way inside the cabin. At around 4am, I felt an immense impact, and I swear I heard the sounds of creaking trees and the ferry itself shaking and vibrating, as though it had sailed straight into the treeline beyond the riverbanks. Of course, I had no visual way to confirm any of this, I could only piece together what I was hearing and feeling. As I’m sure you can appreciate, even when morning broke and I could hear the knocking no longer, I was quite apprehensive to the thought of exiting my safe haven. I may have hidden out there the rest of the day, had it not been for the growls emanating from my own stomach. It dawned on me then, I had not eaten in over 30 hours. It’s not that I hadn’t noticed, it’s that I had quite literally been in a constant state of fight or flight mode pretty much since I boarded. I wouldn’t say the fear had worn off by this point, it sure as hell hadn’t, but my body was making it very clear it would be ignored no longer. I had to eat.

*Dooooonnng… Dooooonnng…*

The sound of buoys outside was music to my ears. Not only did it mean we were back in the harbour, away from that awful river, but I took solace in those subtle reminders of normality. The idea that the world outside this vessel resembled something of what I once knew it to be. I had to hold on to something. Anything that might allow the concept of hope to remain strong in my heart. I then heard another familiar sound, the crackle of that damned P.A system, and I wondered what horrors the mysterious voice was to command unto me today.

*“May I have your attention passengers! The café service is now open. Please form an orderly line, and you will be served momentarily.”*

Thank God, I thought, I could get some food into my stomach. I slowly inched open the bathroom door, the thought of that awful man who had chased me in there last night ever present in my mind. Thankfully, he was nowhere to be seen as I swung the door open all the way and stepped back out, making my way up and around the corner to the stairwell, and there I paused. I couldn’t see that guy anywhere, but there were others now. Some of them I recognised as my fellow passengers from yesterday, or folks similar to them. Others were very different. They were all just shuffling their way up the stairs to the cafeteria, maybe twenty people now all together, as though this was some sort of ritual that needed to happen, rather than something they wanted to be doing. I gave a little nod as the three men I recognised from yesterday limped by me on their way upstairs, but they didn’t even look at me. They just stared straight ahead, their jaws slack. They were followed by two… “people”… I say people, but I really was not sure. They looked human enough at first glance, but looking closer, I started to notice strange imperfections in their forms, as if they were the result of an AI generator’s attempt at a human being. Their legs looked as though they shouldn’t be sufficient to support their forms, nor did they move right. They didn’t really walk, they stuttered. That’s the best I can explain it. Their hands were strange too, long fingers that seemed to curve into pointed ends.

I turned my gaze away, and shook my head, refusing to focus on them any more. I had more pressing matters, I thought, as my stomach gurgled once again. I went to the back of the line and started making my way up the stairs. Patiently waiting my turn as my travelling companions all collected their orders, before shuffling off down the stairs, I caught sight of my buddy, café guy. He smiled that same warm smile, going about his routine preparing coffees and heating up frozen pastries and the like, and before long it was my turn. His expression once again changed when he saw me, morphing into more of a sarcastic smile, shaking his head a little.

*“So… how did the night go?”* He asked me, a suggestion in his tone that he knew full well it had not been a good night. I paused a moment, letting out a little sigh and shooting back a defeated look in his direction.

*“I’m not getting off this ferry… am I?”* I asked bluntly. Café guy laughed softly as he grabbed a cloth and started wiping down the bench.

*“It’s important to know one’s place in this world, I always say, some questions are above both our pay grades.”* He answered nonchalantly, but I wasn’t letting him off that easily.

*“Mate, you clearly work here, wherever here is… You obviously know what’s going on, what’s with the bullshit? If this is all pointless you may as well tell me what’s happening!”* I snapped back, my patience running thin. He stopped what he was doing, turning around to face me and leaning over the bench before responding.

*“You say that as though every question* ***has*** *an answer. You ask as if we are entitled to these answers, even were they to exist. Tell me, where were you headed when you boarded this vessel? Hmm? Do you know? Do any of us know where we’re going at any one time, or in the grand scheme of things? I should hope not. There would be no mystery to life if that were the case, then where would be the excitement? Why do we go to bed with hope in our hearts if not for the fact that* ***we don’t know*** *what’s going to happen tomorrow? Or the next day? I would suggest you keep this in mind young man…”*

He did not speak these words with any hint of malice, or anger. He spoke matter of factly, but not as if to suggest impatience on his part. He spoke with the same kindness which emanated from that smile of his.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Two blasts out of the ferry’s horn, and I knew it was time to set sail again. Café guy knew it too, giving a couple of taps on the counter as if to hurry me along. *“What would you like sir? I can’t hang around here too long…”*

That put me off a little, wondering what his hurry was, but with my hunger drowning out any sense of curiosity, I thought I’d best get my order in.

*“Um… give me three of those sausage rolls you gave that other guy, and maybe two of those chicken and mayo sandwiches.”*

I thought I’d best stock up a little, he seemed to only come by in the mornings, and not for very long. I then asked him how I might pay for these items, and he simply shook his head.

*“No payment sir, not necessary here,”* he replied, before continuing to hum that ridiculous tune of his.

He handed me the sandwiches and I tucked them under my arm, grabbing the cooked sausage rolls in my left hand as soon as they dinged out of the microwave. He then handed me a coffee, and I looked up at him with a questioning look on my face…

*“You look like you need one,”* he said, giving me a wink. I laughed and thanked him, before heading back downstairs. I noticed the now half full cabin of people, all sitting on the left hand side of the ferry, all neatly in rows, either staring straight ahead or munching on their food for the day. I paused a little, taking a couple of steps back as I noticed the man from last night. But he was different now, his face sombre, looking down at his feet. I backed away, heading on over to the rear Starboard side of the ship and taking a seat against the far wall. I sat my sandwiches down on the seat next to me before ripping into one of the sausage rolls. Oh my God, let me tell you, at that point they tasted like heaven.

With my stomach full and satisfied, I decided to head out on deck and get some fresh air. I shot a glance across the ferry, concerned that these people might take this opportunity to rob me of my food reserves, but there they sat, still looking dead ahead, or down at their feet. A few of them still shot those weirdly concerned looks in my direction, but looked away as soon as I made eye contact. I took a second to place my sandwiches on the floor and shoved them under a seat against the wall. There, that should do it. I got up, taking a nice swig from my coffee, as I made my way out onto the deck. We were sailing nearby Athol Bay, I noticed, as I made my way around the deck, catching sight of Whiting Beach. I allowed myself a moment to feel relatively okay, delighting in the taste of the fresh coffee, the smell of the salty air, and the beautiful sights and sounds around me. The harbour was alive today, jet skis and tourist vessels cruised the waters, and the nearby Taronga Zoo was clearly a buzz with people. That had taken a minute to sink in, but it finally clicked… people! In stark contrast to the previous day where I had only been able to catch glimpses of shadows, remnants of a city once alive and vibrant, today that life had returned, and I realised in that moment, I was less than maybe 2 kilometres from a return to this normal world.

I threw my coffee on the deck, and looked out straight ahead, focussing my attention on whiting beach. It was a straight shot, and I was a strong swimmer. I slowly stepped my way to the railings of the vessel and leaned over, looking down into the dark depths of Sydney Harbour. Goosebumps ran up my spine, prickling sharply in my neck as I envisioned how far down the bottom was. I could picture the sea floor in my mind, the coarse sand, the seaweed, the bull sharks, with their beady eyes and keen senses waiting for any sign of movement on the surface. No… no, I couldn’t think about that right now. Shark attack statistics tell me I’ll most likely be okay. If I stayed on this ferry, there was no such chance.

I put one foot up on the railing, gripping the top bar tightly as I swung my leg up and over it, the next one following close behind. My hands remained in a vice grip, as I slowly turned around to face the water. The ferry was moving quite slowly, and I could see some little critters swimming around down there as the wind blew softly against my face. It was still freezing, and I wondered if the water would be the same. I wondered if my body would shut down, hypothermia taking me before the sharks even had a chance to. Shaking my head and dispelling these thoughts once again, I accepted the dark waters before me as the lesser of two dangers and prepared to dive in, letting go of the railing and leaning forward, when suddenly…

***“DON’T!”***

I reached back just in time to grab the railing and stop myself from falling. I spun around, darting my eyes in all directions, looking for the source of that voice. And there he was. Café guy. No smile on his face this time, but a look of sadness and genuine concern for me.

***“DON’T… do that…”***

He spoke again, before turning and walking back inside, disappearing up the staircase within. I spun back around to face the waters, and was met with a crushing reality. They were gone. The vibrant city which had just a moment ago surrounded me, filling me with hope… was gone. The beaches, the waterside walkways, the harbour itself… devoid of life once again. I lowered my head in defeat, genuinely contemplating hurling myself into the water and being done with it, facing whatever eventuality Café guy so sternly warned me of. But no, I could not. While so ever there was still a chance, I had to hold on…

Defeated, I made my way back inside, taking up residence in my row of seats as the ferry began to make its way up and down the harbour again. Onwards we sailed, and as we made our way back down toward Darling Harbour, the ferry started pulling in and making stops and strange ports once more. These were all stops that I recognised, but as the ferry docked in, it became evident that these were very different places from what I knew them to be. With a clunk, we came to a halt at Circular Quay, a stop where usually hundreds of passengers eagerly awaited ferries heading to various destinations. What I saw was little more than a floating platform, more reminiscent of an oil rig than a modern ferry station. I watched as the big guy tossed out the foot ramp, and more… “people”… shuffled their way onto the ferry. I avoided their gaze as they made their way inside, but I could feel their eyes burning into me as they slowly waddled past, joining the rest of the passengers in their rows of seats.

This happened over and over. Every stop we made, what I knew to be reality was simply not there. As we pulled into Milson’s Point, the dock now blackened and covered in disgusting barnacles, I reluctantly forced myself to look over toward Luna Park. No more was the colourful, welcoming theme park. In place of the Mr Moon face, a set of huge, barbed wire gates twisting their way up skyward. Where the big top once stood, something that resembled a giant barn, rotting and decayed, more of these human resembling figures trudging their way out of its massive gates, some of them running toward the ferry and making their way on board. The ferris wheel? A monstrosity of a contraption, wiry arms sticking out from a dilapidating screeching metal centre grinding around in circles, people clinging onto the ends of these arms going round and round, screaming as they did so. I looked away, wanting to see no more. This was too much. The crushing reality that I had very much ended up in some rupture of time and space, trapped here, perhaps forever, diminishing any sense of hope that remained within me.

All day this went on, the ferry slowly continuing to fill up with more and more of these strange depictions of human beings. Usually, they would board the ferry quietly, making their way to their seats and sitting down. But there was one notable exception to this rule. I would become painfully aware that night, that not all who board this vessel are harmless. I had just finished the second of my sandwiches, when I realised what was happening. Gradually, the ferry’s motions became more violent, the boat rocking back and forth in clearly harsher seas. Yes… we had once again made our way out of the harbour. The tall waves outside began to lash at the sides of the ship as I felt the captain swinging a hard right. I looked out the window. We were sailing south, the land clearly visible out the starboard side. I cringed as we passed Bondi Beach, dark, twisted figures flailing around in the waters as fog once again thickened around us, and the frigid night air settled in. I shivered and put my work shirt back on, making a mental note to ask Café guy for a bag tomorrow morning. If I made it through the night…

The ferry drifted on down the coast, shaking from side to side in by far the worst conditions I’ve ever experienced. The waves were monstrous now, and we weren’t even that far out. Every so often I would shoot a glance out the other side of the ferry to see towering walls of water smashing up against us, water pouring through the windows and drenching the mindless drones in the seats beside them. The ferry was tipping violently from left to right, so dangerously close to capsizing I could see the surface of the ocean right outside my window before the vessel would swing back the other way. Yet somehow, we remained topside. I was almost ready to jump up and run to the safety of my bathroom again when the ferry swung another hard right, coinciding with a massive crack of thunder and a blinding flash of lightning so loud I cowered on the floor in terror, uselessly trying to protect myself from being fried to death by a stray bolt from the skies. By the time I pulled myself back up and looked out my window again… all was calm. No more violent waves, no more rough seas. Everything was still, and quiet. I stared out the window, the fog beginning to clear a little, and I noticed where we were. The ferry was sailing into Botany Bay.

As the ferry slowed its pace, the engine reducing to a low drone, I saw things out the window that were just… impossible. I stumbled up the stairwell, making my way over to the Portside and sliding open the door to the upper deck. As we sailed along Prince Charles Parade, I looked up in absolute astonishment. I was staring at the 100 foot mast of a colonial era British Naval vessel, the Union Jack waving in the cold winds. As the ferry crept its way around this thing, I could see faces, peeking curiously over the deck at me, as if I were the out of place object in this situation. The size and the awe of this thing made me feel like little more than a mouse, but this was not the strangest thing I would see here. As we sailed slowly further down the coast, I saw men clad in formal military dress of an age gone by scurrying about the sands, shouting orders and waving their weapons in the air as people dressed in little more than rags trudged their way across the sands, their arms and legs chained. It had obviously dawned on me by this point, as unbelievable as it was to accept, I was somehow witnessing the landing of The First Fleet.

Another towering navy ship up ahead dwarfed our tiny ferry, and feeling dizzy from the sheer enormity of it, I stumbled my way back inside, slumping down into my chair. I continued to watch out the window as this bizarre historical flashback unfolded before me. A little further down the bay, my stomach turned as I gazed upon the sickening sight of a group of prisoners on their knees, two soldiers standing before them, their weapons trained. I looked away, hiding my eyes and blocking my ears in anticipation of what this meant. I kept my senses as dulled as possible, as five distinct shots rang out through the night. I felt tears running through the cracks in my fingers as the reality of what had just happened echoed through my head. The frantic shouts of men snapped my attention back to the surreal happenings outside, and I saw one of them waving to the ferry, signalling it to stop, it would seem. I shuddered at the thought of this… surely there was no way we would pull in here after what had just happened. A familiar creak of straining metal proved that hope woefully wrong, as the ferry swung around and began slowing as it neared the shoreline. I sunk back into my seat, making myself as small as possible. Slowly and carefully, I peeked out the window as I felt the ferry jerk to one side, its anchor hitting the floor of the bay. There stood ramp guy. He gave the anchor a couple of firm tugs, before standing up and waving his arms in the air, as the men below wheeled a massive ramp of their own up along the shoreline, sliding its top edge over the deck of the ferry. I pulled my head away from the window again as I heard the sounds of chains making their way up the ramp, dragging across the deck, and eventually, a series of loud clangs as the chains fell free.

“Thank you Officers,” ramp guy said menacingly, the first time I had actually heard him speak. I heard boots stomping back down the ramp and off into the distance, and soon after, the sound of the anchor being reeled back in. I felt almost relieved as the ferry began to pull away from this awful scene… that is until I heard the sound of footsteps clunking up the stairwell toward me.

I turned away, focussing my attention out the window, not wanting to look at who, or what, was coming up those stairs. In the vague reflection of the window, I noticed figures, just outlines was all I could see, moving their way through the cabin. They took over two rows of seats behind me, a few rows back. There were numerous men, four or five in number, and they did not sound friendly. They spoke in Cockney accents, talking back and forth between themselves regarding their alleged crimes, which I will not repeat here, so heinous in nature they were. I tried to sink lower and lower in my seat, hoping I would go unnoticed, but alas, after a few minutes of bantering between themselves, their voices became hushed. They began to talk in harsh whispers, ominous in tone, and with clearly sinister intent. Me, the obvious target of these intentions. My mind raced, as I heard them stand up from their rows of seats. I looked around for anything I might use as a weapon to defend myself, but found nothing, settling in the end for the keys in my pocket. I carefully grabbed them out, and firmly wedged one key between my fingers in a tightly clenched fist. I heard footsteps approaching, and I heard the men’s voices erupt into a violent shout. I grabbed the back of the seat in front of me, about to get up and bury my makeshift weapon into whatever was standing before me, when all of a sudden, the door to the Captain’s quarters swung open!

I did not look, for what I saw merely out of the peripherals of my vision was enough to dissuade me. Something tall, unnaturally so, stood in the doorway. I sat back down in my seat, and stared straight ahead, refusing to look. My attackers stood frozen in place, as this figure took heavy steps, very slowly, toward them, before coming to a halt a couple of steps away. I carefully shifted my eyes to the point I could just see what was happening. They were all standing about a foot behind me, so I could make out figures, but nothing more. This… thing. He? It? Whatever… was **massive**. The head brushed against the roof of the ceiling as it stared down at these men who cowered in fear before it. Up ahead, the Captain stood firm behind the wheel, never wavering, just staring out into the dark seas before us. As I sat there, frozen in my place, I heard the sounds of footsteps, a group of them, tapping their way across the floor to the other side of the ferry, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw the five men ever so quietly take their seats, and stare down at their feet. I quickly averted my eyes, as massive footfalls began making their way back this way. I heard them stop… right beside me… and I felt something staring at me. I began to shake where I sat, praying this would just go away. And it was then a deep, awful voice spoke one word…

*“Interesting”*… 

Before walking away, the door to the Captain’s quarters slamming behind it. I broke down at this point, falling out of my chair and collapsing onto the floor. I stared at the ceiling, too exhausted to care about what was happening around me anymore. How in the hell was I here?! What in the hell was happening?! I curled up where I lay, watching out the upper rear doors as the ocean began to show its fury once again. I simply stared at the waves outside, mesmerised by their motion, wondering where on earth we were now, until I finally managed to succumb to sleep.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

I was blasted out of sleep by an unusually loud eruption from the blower. Checking my watch, I saw it was around two in the morning. What the hell was going on now, I thought, as I pulled myself together and got up off the floor. I glanced over, the five men from earlier were still in their seats, hunched over and sleeping. I rubbed my eyes…

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

What the…?! That wasn’t from the ferry… it was too loud. The sounds from the ocean chop were louder now too, water ripping its way over the surface.

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

Louder now! What the hell is doing that?! I grabbed the sliding door to the deck and slid it open, stepping outside into the frosty night air. I noticed a bright light as I stepped out, grabbing the railing to steady myself, and I made my way up to the front of the upper deck.

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!! Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

***Bwoooooooooooooommmmmm!!!***

In one panicked moment, my eyes rose up to meet the sight of the enormous cargo ship carving its way through the ocean straight towards us!

There was no time to even think, I ran, and I dived off the side of that accursed ferry, smashing head first into the blackness of the pacific ocean. I wasted no time as I crashed through the surface, I flailed my arms and kicked my legs as fast as I possibly could, trying to swim down as deep as possible and put as much distance as I could between me and the monstrosity above me. I did not open my eyes, and I tried not to think about the sheer depth of what I was slowly disappearing into. I felt my body almost snap as I was violently pulled into a current of water as this thing flew past above me. I was suddenly enveloped in darkness, as its massive form bulldozed over the ocean’s surface, and I was tossed around like a rag in a washing machine for what felt like minutes on end, before being finally released, floating helplessly there in the depths. For whatever strength I had left I pulled myself up toward the surface, the moonlit night thankfully giving me some form of direction. I kicked and swam with all my might until finally I broke through the surface. Immediately I began looking around for the wreck, I had to find something to grab onto. Some rogue piece of broken ferry that I could at least float on, or ideally a stray life jacket. I looked around as far as my eyes could see, searching for anything that might do the trick.

*No…*

I looked out toward the moonlit horizon…

*No!*

I snapped my eyes around to both sides…

***NO!***

I shot a frantic look around behind me and in all directions…

***NOOOO!!!!!!!***

There was no wreck. There was no cargo ship. And the ferry… was gone…
