I've had a lot of strange experiences in my time of living in Laramie, one place that always felt kind of spooky to me was certain old buildings on campus. It feels like there's an ominous presence lingering in the dark halls of the basements there. To truly understand this experience there's some history of University of Wyoming you need to know first. 

The University of Wyoming was founded in 1886, four years before Wyoming was even a state. The local cemetery, Greenhill Cemetery, was built in 1881 and is full of graves that were moved from all different parts of town, including where the University currently resides. Because of this, many people believe that some of the spirits are not at rest after having to be moved, causing many hauntings around town. 

One haunting on campus is the story of a little girl who haunts Knight Hall. People say that when this specific building was being built a body of a little girl was found where the foundation now is. Although the body was removed, people say they still see a little girl from the windows. They also say that sometimes a little girl can be seen running around the halls, especially in the basement. This is where my strange experience begins. 

I was wandering the halls of Knight Hall with a friend one day when we made it to the basement. I had heard the story of the little girl but assumed it was just a rumor since there wasn't much evidence to support it. In the basement we noticed that all of the lights were out, which was weird because I'd been in the basement before and usually the lights turned on when you walked by. Something felt very off as we went deeper into the hall, it got colder and even quieter, kind of like when snow falls and drowns out sound. My friend, not picking up on any of this turned the corner and ran as a prank, leaving me in the dark. 

As I sat in the dark cold hall I froze, it felt like someone was right behind me, quietly breathing on my neck. I knew it wasn't my friend, she was down the hall and the only way back to where I was coming back the way she came. I felt someone gently touch my shoulder and as I nearly screamed and whipped around, I heard my friend scream and come running back to me from  down the hall. We both ran back to the elevator and out of the building. She later confirmed that she heard running behind her and felt like someone was coming straight at her. The thing is, there was nothing past where she was but a wall. She ran the opposite direction towards me right as I was touched on the shoulder. 

This was definitely the scariest experience I had on campus, but not the only one. University of Wyoming definitely has some hauntings and I'll try to post some more of my experiences.
