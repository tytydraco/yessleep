It's a long story. It was 2021 it was summer I was a huge Gumball fan I watched all the episodes without even getting bored . But late one night I was looking and saw an ad 

*after commercial we will show you a new Gumball Episode*

Something Was Strange Gumball ended in 2019 two years before tonight I felt like something was wrong it didn't make sense 

Although it was doubtful I waited to see what it was about because I am very curious 

After the last commercial ended it started but something was wrong the opening music was very soft I could barely hear anything Another thing was the word Gumball was pastel red but usually every The letter was a different color. Then the title of the episode started but in a depressing tone the title was (the pain)I didn't understand what it meant but I kept watching 

The episode started with Gumball in some sort of metal walled hall sitting on the floor with a beam of light shining down on him . Suddenly a woman began to be heard singing slowly like a whisper, like she was singing a lullaby But the song had constant lyrics with regret, pain, torment, loneliness .I didn't understand what the episode would mean 

The next scene was Nicole in tears putting up a missing child poster with Gumball's photo in it. Then suddenly the scene cuts to Darwin sad with dark circles sitting on the computer Search for the word "Gumball" I still had that question, What the hell is going on why are they all so sad, what happened to them? 

Another scene represents a conversation between Principal Brown and Mrs. Simian was like this

Principal Brown: Lucy what are we going to do Gumball has been wanted for 2 months already the whole state is talking about it

Mrs. Simian: Don't worry Nigel we might not get arrested

Director Brown: How not! We might get a bigger punishment than we imagine just from school left we were responsible

Mrs Simian: Listen Nigel maybe we can find him so he won't sue us 

Principal Brown: Then what are we waiting for let's find him before it's too late 

Then Principal Brown and Mrs. Simian started the car and decided to look for him 

The scene returns to Gumball and a man's voice is heard from the darkness telling him that no one will ever find him. Gumball being scared to death

Back to Darwin later Rob had come and asks Darwin what's going on Darwin tells him everything and Rob offers to help so he can be Gumball's enemy again. They both had received a help message from Gumball saying he was in a hall outside of town Darwin and Rob start running to find him .the two bump into Principal Brown and Mrs. Simian who tells them where Gumball is then all 4 speed off

Meanwhile Gumball stands by the man who continues to tell him that he is useless.Then the man started raping him, I already felt it was too much but I was dying to see how it ends Meanwhile, Darwin, Rob, Principal Brown and Mrs. Simian were out of town heading to the location 

After the man throws a knife at Gumball and tells him that he would be better off dead 

Then Darwin,Rob,Principal Brown and Mrs. Simian arrived but the door was locked so Rob threw a tinmine to open the door it worked but it was too late Gumball killed himself 

The man was arrested, Gumball's body was taken out on a stretcher and everyone was preparing for the funeral . The episode ends with the message

"In memory of our beloved son, enemy, student, brother, boyfriend Gumball Watterson"

Bottom being Gumball's picture 

And now after 3 years this episode traumatizes me
