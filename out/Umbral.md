**Footnote:**

Umbral is a term shrouded in the esoteric world of Spiritism and Brazilian folklore, invoking a chilling sense of a shadowy realm where lost souls linger after death. In the English language, there exists no direct equivalent for this eerie concept. Thus, "umbral" is often retained in its original Portuguese, even within the ghastly depths of English discourse, especially in the dark alleys of Spiritism and the macabre. It serves as a threshold to a place where the ethereal and the sinister converge, and its presence looms ominously, sending shivers down one's spine.  


I awoke in that dim world, finding myself within a decrepit house, part of a city long abandoned. The structure teetered on the brink of collapse, with wild vegetation claiming every inch and the roof caving in at various spots. The feeling of despair was undeniable when a young girl with dark wavy blonde hair appeared abruptly. Her face exuded distress, and her words were urgent: "Get up quickly! They're on their way; you need to hide."

At her side, a pale-skinned boy with short, shadowing hair over part of his face demonstrated impatience and anxiety. I rose slowly, stunned by the throbbing headache and foggy mind. My voice trembled as I asked, "They who? And where am I?"

The boy was already ahead, impatient for explanations. The young girl sighed and explained that time was of the essence, urging me to follow them. Together, we ran through corridors overrun by vegetation, escaping from that dilapidated house. As we entered a new building, we encountered a third boy. Tall, dark, and notably athletic, he appeared to be about 17. He informed us that the "observers" were to the southwest. The dark-haired boy threw a backpack on the damp ground and began retrieving supplies, including a flashlight, snack packages, protein bars, water bottles, and a mold-stained map, clearly hand-drawn.

While we discussed our strategy, the tall boy looked at me with a penetrating gaze and asked, "Another one? What's your name?" In a trembling voice, I replied that my name was Carol and took the opportunity to ask where in the world we were. His expression grew graver, and he explained that no one knew exactly where we were. However, to survive, we needed to adhere to strict rules.

He compared our situation to a game of hide and seek, where we were the prey. He explained that before the sun set, it was crucial to find a hiding place because that was when the observers would come out to search for us. No one knew how long it would be until the sun rose again, so during this uncertain period, we needed to gather supplies and, above all, maintain absolute silence.

The severity of his words and the uncertainty of what awaited us in the gloomy twilight made me even more apprehensive. It was as if we were immersed in a deadly game, where every choice and every step had to be carefully calculated to survive the night.

Meanwhile, the dark-haired boy made it clear that he would not share his supplies with me. The young girl attempted to mediate, arguing that they would need more allies for the next phase. Reluctantly, the boy agreed and handed me a protein bar and a water bottle. He explained that if I survived the night, I should find them by following the moonlight, and they disappeared by leaping over a broken wall.

A shiver ran down my spine. As I observed the surroundings, I realized I was in an empty house with crumbling walls, mold, and moss spreading across the surfaces. Above, a stone bridge stretched, and the sun was setting on the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange.

I followed the path they had taken for about thirty minutes through an abandoned city. Suddenly, a young boy, around eight years old with shoulder-length brown hair, ran past me, casting a terrified glance before vanishing. I noted the direction he came from and, in the distance, spotted a colossal creature with black tattered robes, grotesquely long hands, and what seemed like a macabre form of prayer. It disappeared behind a building without noticing me.

Adrenaline coursed through me, and the feeling of imminent danger was palpable. I ran desperately and entered a partially ruined house, where I found a sort of trapdoor. With difficulty, I managed to open it and hid inside. The space was damp and cold, illuminated only by moonlight, and the wood was dusty and icy. As I explored the dark space with my hands, I felt a loose piece that led to a cramped hiding place.

Lying there, I felt the weight of the moment and was terrified by the certainty that something terrible was about to happen. Above, I heard heavy footsteps, and the sense of danger was overwhelming.
