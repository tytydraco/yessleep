I moved into my new apartment a month ago. The rent was cheap, the location was perfect, and the only catch was a small crack in the bathroom mirror. No big deal, right? A little crack never hurt anyone.

The first night I noticed something odd. While brushing my teeth, I saw a flicker of movement in the mirror, just behind me. I turned around quickly, but there was nothing there. Just my reflection staring back at me, slightly distorted by the crack.

As days passed, the flicker of movement became more frequent. Sometimes, I would catch a glimpse of a shadow darting across the reflection of the room. Other times, it felt like my reflection was lagging behind, as if it had to catch up with my movements.

One night, I decided to test it. I stood in front of the mirror and raised my right hand. My reflection raised its left. I laughed it off, convincing myself I was just tired. But the unease lingered.

A week later, the mirror cracked more. The small crack expanded into a spiderweb of fractures, distorting my reflection further. That night, I dreamed of the mirror. In the dream, I stood before it, staring at my broken reflection. But then, my reflection smiled. It was a smile I wasn’t making.

I woke up in a cold sweat, heart pounding. I avoided the bathroom that day, using the mirror in my bedroom to get ready instead. But the feeling of being watched was overwhelming. I felt eyes on me everywhere I went in my apartment.

Desperate for answers, I called my landlord. He was an old man, living in the building for decades. When I mentioned the mirror, there was a long pause.

"That mirror…" he said slowly, "it's been here since the building was constructed. Some say it's a portal, a gateway between our world and… another."

I laughed nervously. "You're joking, right?"

"I wish I were," he replied. "Previous tenants complained about strange things happening with that mirror. Reflections that moved on their own, shadows lurking just out of sight. Some even claimed to see a person standing behind them."

Chilled to the bone, I decided to cover the mirror. I draped a thick towel over it, hoping that would be the end of it. But that night, as I lay in bed, I heard a faint whisper. It was coming from the bathroom.

I got up, my heart pounding. The whisper grew louder, a soft, sinister voice calling my name. I reached the bathroom and froze. The towel had slipped off the mirror, revealing my reflection. But it wasn’t my reflection anymore.

It was me, but not me. My reflection's eyes were pitch black, and it wore a twisted smile. Slowly, it raised a hand and beckoned me closer. Against my will, I stepped forward.

"Let me out," it whispered. "It's so lonely in here."

I tried to move away, but my feet were rooted to the spot. My reflection's hand pressed against the glass, and I felt a cold, invisible force pulling me toward the mirror. I struggled, but it was no use.

With a final, desperate effort, I yanked myself free and ran out of the bathroom. I grabbed my phone and called a friend, begging them to let me stay over. That night, I slept on their couch, too afraid to return to my apartment.

The next day, I broke the lease and moved out. I left most of my belongings behind, including that cursed mirror. I don’t know what it was or what it wanted, but I’m not sticking around to find out.

To anyone reading this, if you ever move into an apartment with a cracked mirror, get rid of it. Don’t wait. Don’t hesitate. You never know what might be looking back at you from the other side.
