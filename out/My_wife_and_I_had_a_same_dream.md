"You okay?" Irina asked me, lifting the eyes from the book. "You look like you haven 't slept at all."

"I am fine. Just a bad dream."

"Yeah, me too." she sighed, sipping on coffee."We shouldn’t have watched that movie last night."

"Oh, yeah." I smiled back, pouring a cup of coffee for myself, hoping to relieve the brain fog. "In my dream, Anabelle was chasing me through the woods, until I reached…"

"The cabin with the old man." Irina interrupted me, looking at me puzzled.

"...yes. How did you know?" 

"I had the same dream. Well, similar.." She put coffee down, focusing entirely on me. "He was in a swing chair on a porch, right?" 

"Yes. It was evening and the moon was almost visible through trees. I don"t remember much after." 

"Well, it"s official. We have been together for so long that our brains synchronised." Irina smiled at me, returning to her coffee and book. Her nonchalant attitude helped me shake off the weird feeling the dream gave me a bit.

I shook myself as shivers ran through my spine, as if I tried to physically get rid of the feeling. I went over and opened the kitchen window, letting the morning sun and damp smell of the lake in. It's just stupid dream, I told myself. I shouldn’t waste my nerves on this, I am finally on vacation with my dear wife and…

"Where are Pete and Sandra by the way?" I asked Irina.

"They went for a swim already, you know your brother. Up before the sun even."

"Wanna join them?"

"It is still cold for me. But yeah, let's go, I can just read there."

We packed a bag with a couple of sandwiches and sodas, and headed for the little clearing that was considered a beach. The ground trail hugged the lake, flanked by tall pine trees – pointy leaves and cones all around, piercing my slippers. Irina walked behind me, absently following me as she could not put her book down. 

Even though it was a clear morning, the sun was still chasing away thin mist over the lake, and mist seemed to slither away towards woods, finding refuge in shades between tall trees. A familiar gut feeling that we are being watched came to me. I kept glancing over between the trees, catching glimpses of movement, a delicate dance of mist playing with my mind. I shook myself again, attributing anxious feelings to my dream. *Our dream.* At least my brain fog was disappearing, in the same way mist disappeared over the still lake.

"About time you nerds." Pete yelled from the water. Irina was a teacher, and I was a journalist. We spent most of our free time reading, which Pete, the gym trainer, could not wrap his head around. Sandra, his financial advisor wife who swam by him, slapped him playfully.

"Good morning to you too." I said, putting the bag away. "Is the water cold?"

"Yes, but it's amazing once you get used to it. Come on Irina, don’t leave me alone with the boys." Sandra yelled as Pete tried to pull her under the water, retribution for slapping him.

"You know I hate the cold, you're on your own girl." Irina laughed at Sandra, as I tried to get into the lake. The cold water's bite was strong even before it reached my knees. I turned around to confirm to Irina that the water was too cold, and something moved in the woods behind her. I blinked, and it was gone. Irina saw my look, and looked over the shoulder. She turned back to me. "Are you okay?"

"Yes, yes it's just…water is cold." I gave her a half smile."I think I am gonna sit this one out." I went over and sat across her on the beach, facing the woods. 

"Not you too." Pete yelled from the lake. "No surprise about Irina staying out, but you, you disappoint me. I shall renounce you as my brother."

"In that case, Irina and I will just eat all these sandwiches alone." I shaked the bag.

"Sandwiches you say?" Pete rushed towards the beach, forgetting about his wife at the moment. Sandra rolled her eyes and followed. 

"I am starving." Pete said, half of the sandwich disappearing in a single bite.

"Why didn’t you guys bring anything, you shouldn’t swim on an empty stomach." Irina said.

"Oh, it's Pete, we didn’t have time to do anything because he was sure somebody was sneaking around the house in the morning." Sandra said, laughing. I did not laugh.

"Wait, what?" I asked. I felt Irina’s gaze on me.

“Oh, nothing,” Pete said, embarrassingly. “I was sure I heard some commotion, turned out to be an animal, possum or something.” 

“At first I thought I heard it too, but when we got out to check it, it disappeared. Although, it’s really creepy in the morning with all the mist! Especially in the moonlight.”

“Yeah, indeed it is.” Shivers ran through me again and I shrugged. 

“There was no moonlight, it was just…Nevermind. What’s wrong with you?” Pete turned attention towards me, words barely recognizable through a mouthful of food.

“Oh, don’t mind him. We had this weird dream last night.” Irina said.

“We?” Sandra raised eyebrows.

“Yes,” Irina laughed, “It might not have been the best idea to watch a horror movie in the lakehouse. We both dreamt of Anabell and…some things, doesn’t really matter.” 

“Ha, I knew he was gonna get scared!” Pete laughed. 

“Oh shut up, you were the one checking out noises around the house.” Pete playfully punched me and went on to finish his sandwich. I thought about telling them that I saw movement in the woods. *I think I saw the movement*, I corrected myself in my head. Fuck it, Pete would just make more fun of me. We spent the rest of the afternoon at the beach, taking a walk in the woods later. I was reluctant to go, but the creeping dread from the morning has disappeared. As the sun had reached the zenith, light seeped through treetops, completely banishing the mist and woods seemed a lot less scary. *It was just a stupid dream*, I thought.

In the evening we decided we would not watch movies again. We played Monopoly, and with a few drinks, I barely even remembered the dream, and the feeling that came with it. We lit the fireplace, its warmth in combination with alcohol made me drowsy. I was not the only one.

“Whose turn in it is?” Irina asked, yawning. Sandra yawned back.

“I don’t know. Mine? Should we call it a…” 

“Wait. Hear that?” Pete interrupted her. Sandra was about to say something else when Pete shushed her. We sat for a couple of moments with silence, sharpening our ears. The only thing I could hear was my increasing heart rate.

“Pete, there is nothing.” Sandra said.

“Shush!” Pete silenced her again. I was on the edge of my chair, listening. Over my own pulse , wood flickered in the fireplace, aside from that, nothing could be heard. I still kept silent. Irina and Sandra looked at each other, Sandra just shaking her head. 

“Come with me.” Pete told me. He got out of the chair, grabbed a flashlight and headed towards the door. “You coming?”

“Pete, there is nothing…” I started speaking, Pete interrupting me. “Let’s make sure of that, huh?” He went out. I shrugged at Irina and Sandra, following him out. 

A flashlight’s beam cut through the moonless night, catching tendrils of the emerging evening mist, as if earth exhaled a breath that did not belong to it. It was easy to mistake its slightest movement for something that moved, something that was physical. Something that was alive. I tried my best not to.

“There it is! Have you heard of it?” Pete hissed. I couldn’t hear anything.

“You’re tripping Pete, I didn’t hear anything. Let’s call it a night and go to sleep.”

Pete looked at me as if he was examining if I am saying an excuse to head inside, or if I am speaking the truth. Must’ve been the latter, because he nodded silently and headed back with me. I was not even lying, alcohol got to me, my head felt heavy and I felt a need to go to sleep.

“You boys catch anything?” Sandra asked.

“No.” Pete said dryly, locking the door. I just gestured to Irina that it is time to go to bed. 

“If there was something you would have seen even without a flashlight, moonlight is so bright.” Sandra yawned again.

“There is no…I need to lie down. My head is spinning. Goodnight guys.”

Irina and I went upstairs, Pete and Sandra lying downstairs in the living room. Considering we invited them, they had the courtesy of sleeping on a sofa bed. With the corner of my eye I saw Pete taking a knife from the kitchen, putting it under his pillow. 

I am in the woods again. There is no sign of Anabelle this time. I move through darkness, the indigo sky barely visible, evening sun peering through the canopy above me, casting shadows that refuse to stay still. My head hurts. A whisper. I turn around. Mists creep around me. Towards me? I press on, refusing to stay in place. My head hurts. Another whisper. Lourder this time. I pick up the pace. My own heavy breathing makes it hard to figure if I am hearing the whispers or imagining them. My head hurts. Darkness is becoming unbearable, heavy, pine trees drawing closer at me. A light in the distance. A moon? A house. A cabin. A man is on the porch. Old man. He is saying something to me, I am unable to decipher. He rises from the chair and yells at me. That feeling that I am being watched. I feel a hand touching my shoulder. I shudder. Somebody calls out my name. Out of the old man’s house, screams are coming. It’s a woman, she is screaming, screaming loud, as if she was being…

I woke up in cold sweat, Irina by me, her hand on the shoulder calling my name. It was a dream. It was just a dream. Why could I still hear the screams then? 

I jumped out of bed. Sandra’s screams were turning into squeals as I ran downstairs towards the dark living room. 

“I got them, I got them, I got them!” Pete yelled.

I slapped the switch, turning on the light. 

Pete was on top of Sandra on the bed, holding a knife in his hand. Blood over his hands, shirt, face. Turning a light on seemed to stop him. He turned his eyes that were too open to me, then to his own arm, holding a knife. He looked at it as if it was somebody else’s. Beneath him, Sandra let out what sounded like her last breath. He dropped the knife, stepping away from his unmoving wife, crouching in the corner, face drained, as if the room had suddenly become too real. I did not move. I did not know what to say, what to do. Between frantic whispers, the only thing that I could understand Pete saying was to call the police.

I sat on the edge of bed upstairs while the police finished their investigation, face buried in hands. It took them nearly an hour to arrive from the nearest town. Pete has never left his corner. Irina cried softly behind me. I did not know what to say, how to console her. I did not know how to console myself. The detective walked in through the half opened door. 

“How are you doing?”

I couldn’t even answer. He nodded with understanding.

“Carbon monoxide leak, faulty the generator in the basement. They slept right above it, but you might have felt its influence too. Have you experienced any hallucinations, feelings of paranoia, disorientation, seen or heard things?”

Weird dreams, sounds around the woods, mists dancing, Sandra seeing the moonlight. I wondered how I could not see it coming. If I said something, If I agreed with Pete there on the lake, maybe we…

“Yes. Both then and…me.” I squeezed words through my teeth. 

“Alright, take a moment to dress, then we’re going to take you to hospital. We’ll take the statements after.” 

The detective tapped my shoulder emphatically, leaving the room and closing the door. Behind the door, a painting hung. Panting of old man in the swing chair, sitting on a porch of cabin in the woods.
