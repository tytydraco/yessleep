After my dream I went to work as normal that day, and as I looked through the mundane spreadsheets, I could hear a a soothing call.

“Dig”

The thought stuck with me like bad breath. Infesting my thoughts, running through my mind. I went home that day and stared at the spot the image pointed at. Why would I ever dig there?

“Don't be stupid,” I thought to myself,” I wouldn't want to ruin this beautiful backyard. It was just a dream. It'll pass like all the others.” If only that had been true.

Over the next week, I was visited by a figure in the night in my dreams. Every night, it moved closer to my house until eventually it would be standing over me in my bed. My house was filled with the smell that accompanied the being.

I continued to wrestle with the thought

“Dig.”

After a month of my dreams, it became all-consuming. My work suffered, and I found myself narrowly avoiding accidents on my commutes. My conversations with Creed became short and half-hearted as all I could think of was digging. The more I resisted, the more purchase it gained in my mind.

“What if something magical was down there?” I would think to myself to rationalize these thoughts. “I just can't tell Creed about this, he's the only friend I've ever had, and I don't want to scare him off.”

I fought and fought the idea until I gave in.

I found myself standing in front of the shovels in my local hardware store. I could barely remember how I ended up there, as if a force had dragged me there unwillingly.

“What the hell. I guess a little digging won't hurt anything.” As I said this, my heart skipped with a forbidden excitement.

I returned home with a new nervous pit in my stomach, careful to avoid Creed, hoping he wouldn't come over tonight. The sun had set, and it was becoming colder. The lawn was illuminated by my porch light and the various lightning bugs flying around flashing their lights. I was drawn to the spot where the figure had pointed. It was a magnetic pull, moving my feet and legs without thought.  The lightning bugs seemed to gather around the area, flashing faster with each step, either as an invitation or a warning, an invitation I hoped. With the shovel in hand, I stood over the spot, a nervous, excited heartbeat drumming in my ears. The drumming became louder as I plunged the shovel into the soft, wet earth. As I entered the earth, a rush of sublime pleasure rolled over my body. I have never been with a woman before. In fact, I've never been close to a woman, only in my dreams. The sensations I felt as I plunged into the dirt were exactly how I always imagined them. With every new strike from my shovel, a wave of pleasure would roll over me, covering me from head to toe.

“Dig. DIg DIg.” I heard, only this time it was I saying the seductive words. The lightning bugs had disappeared altogether. The dirt clung to me in a warm embrace, one that I had rarely experienced—the scent of wet earth and unfamiliar floral filled my brain, heightening my experience. The overcoming sensations left me deaf to Jasper's barks that night. Half an hour of digging had passed when I began to be very tired. My energy seemed to be sapped by an unknown source. I had stopped and looked at my work. I had only dug about a 2-foot hole. How had that been possible? It felt as if I was moving tons and tons of earth. I retired to my bed and rested upon my pillow, where I, after a week of restless nights, slept soundly.

The next morning, I woke up invigorated- confidence coursing through my veins. When I arrived at work, I felt as if a cloud had been lifted from my eyes, and I could finally talk to the people I wanted to. People seem magnified to me. I was more of a man than I was yesterday.

“How's it hanging, big guy!” Andrew called me; it was the first time he had ever talked to me without me starting the conversation. “You wanna come over on Saturday to watch the game? I know you said you don't know much about football, but I'll teach ya. How does that sound?” My newfound confidence emboldened me to accept. This was it, I felt as though I finally broke through.

My week continued this way; I felt intense momentum personally and professionally. I was recognized as the lead analyst for that week. The woman whom I had been most attracted to, Sarah, began talking to me, nothing special, just pleasantries. I felt like I stood alone on the mountain top.  I found myself staring in the mirror at myself. I had changed, perhaps not physically, but the climate around me. It seemed as though my movements were charged by some unseen electricity. The words fell from my lips in a smooth, silky way. The things that took immense effort became second nature. I no longer worried about how my hair would look and how I was worried whether my clothes were wearing me instead of the other way around. It all became perfect.

Slowly, this high drained out of me. Every day, the people around the office returned to their former indifference towards me. The “powers” I had gained had eroded until I became an empty, used shell of myself. I began to think I was worse off now than I was before I had dug that night. Creed came by and noticed my drained state.

“You ought to get some better rest. It looks as though a tick had stuck to ya’”

“Yeah, I know. I feel like I'm getting drained.”

“Hey, earlier in the week, Jasper was going crazy during the night. I couldn't get him to settle down. Did you notice anything different? He's never that rowdy,” he said with a genuine curiosity.

I asked the night in particular, and it was the night of the dig.

“No clue. Honestly, I didn't even notice,” I said, hoping to move past this conversation With a shrug and a comment about maybe they are both going senile, he headed back to his house

“Why do you want to know where I live?” Andrew asked, “I don't ever remember inviting you over for the game. I don't want to have to explain everything to you. It'll embarrass me in front of my friends.”

“Can I help you with something?” Sarah said shortly as I asked about her weekend plans.

“Dig,”

I began to hear that word again.

Slowly. It started deep in the back of my skull. As I drifted back to my mediocrity, it moved and grew louder. Pounding against the front of my head at a near constant drone. The figure returned to my dreams. Its presence was pressing against my mind. I would wake and feel it watching from the shadows of the house. Whenever I looked back at the yard it felt as if the forest was watching me with every move, as if it would pounce on me if given the chance. The fireflies came and visited every night, swarming and dancing about in the night. I had Creed over one night, and he said that they were a sign of a good omen that they protected against the spirits in the woods. Some strange Appalachian story, I thought to myself

“Dig.”

I kept fighting the strange urge once more.

“If I dug more, then Creed would notice such a large hole and would start asking questions I don't quite have the answers for,” I would think.

“Dig”

“Maybe just a little,” I would think.

“Dig,” the vice called

My life began to fall apart around me as I resisted. Every choice at work was the wrong one. Surely there was no way that digin had such a unique effect on my life, but as I refuted the urge, it became clear to me. If I didn't dig, then I would have no chance to be anything ever again.

“Dig.” I would lose my job, and my anxieties grew.

“Dig”

I would always be this sad version of myself.

“Dig”

They wanted to know that version of you, not the real you.

“Dig”

The words stroked the crevices of my brain

“Dig”

No one will ever truly love me without digging. The thought rang through my soul.

The sweet scent of grass welcomed me as I stepped out into the dark backyard, shovel in hand. As the dig commenced, the same pleasures began to wrap themselves around me. Coaxing me to continue. The creaking from the vines grew loud.  I dug and dug. I felt time slip as I dug. A pleasurable trance fell over me as I dug for hours. I could feel it watching me from the edge of the woods, the vines growing closer to me with every strike of the shovel. It had no face, yet I thought I could sense a smile wrapping around it.

Woken up by the sound af the birds and the heat from the sun, I found that I had slept in the hole.

“What time is it?” I asked myself in a panic.

It's 6:15, the perfect time for me to wake up and shower to make it to work. It was as if I had been shaken awake to make it to work by some foreign force. As I looked around me, I realized I had dug a substantial depth, one where I was worried about how I would escape. I climbed the walls, grasping at the now hard soil. Looking back into the hole, my mind was reeling at how I could have dug so much in one night. With that thought echoing through my mind, I showered the dirt from my body, noticing the new contours and strength that had seemingly grown overnight.  While drying off, I saw that the unknown electricity had returned once more. That day, I drove to work with no traffic to stop me.

Sarah talked to me again today. She never talked to me first before today. I always started the conversation.

“Here, let me get the door for you,” she said with a smile on her face, like she was excited to see me coming up the stairs.

Her hair sparkled, and her skin smelled like vanilla when I passed her in the doorway. Not that I was that close or anything. Sarah only ever really talks to me after I dig. Actually, the only time people talk to me (like actually talk to me) is after I dig. I feel like I can do anything after I dig.

The days zoomed by for about a week. The world felt so insignificant. Nothing was beyond my grasp. When I visited Creed, he was in stitches from laughing so hard at my jokes.

“My goodness, son. I never woulda taken you for a joker,” he said, regaining his breath

No one had called me son before. It felt like I had really become more than I could be.

I slept soundly for those nights. I heard the creeking from the woods, and I felt the being watching from the treeline. I took comfort in the fact that something was watching out for me for the first time.

Like a slow avalanche the days  dragged once more. I couldn't get to work on time. My boss acted like I didn't exist. Worse of all, Sarah won't speak to me. I must dig. I can't wait for the hole to call me this time. I must dig.

After waiting anxiously in traffic, I got home and began my dig. The ground was harder, rockier than before. I dug and dug, hoping to gain some sort of traction. As the sun set, the lightning bugs began to flicker around the hole. It seemed as though they were reaching to help me out, but didn't dare to fly inside its depths. Frustrated and exasperated, I climbed out and began to curse the damn hole. Why had it let me taste the sweetness of what life could be and then steal it away from me, that shadowy bastard.

The lightning bugs were swarming my area as if they were pushing me to the porch. Those dumb bugs won't even let me be angry in peace. I turned as I stepped onto my porch to see the being standing at the edge of the hole. Though I could see the fireflies, their shadows cast deep into the forest. I could hear the kudzu grow and inch closer towards my house. I felt as though I was dreaming, but no dream could feel like this. The scent filled my nostrils as if it were the smell of me coming back to my true home. My heart began to race, my head began to buzz, and I pushed through the veil of bioluminescent insects, rushing towards the being. I looked back for a moment, remembering what Creed had said about the bugs. The lightning bugs had left me in that moment. Returning towards its “feet,” I fell to my knees on the now soft ground, squishing at my descent.  It pointed back down just as it had once before.

I heard its voice ease the unknown itch in my head, “dig farther.” This time it wasn't a command but a suggestion, one that sounded sublime.

As I crawled to approach the being, it vanished as if I was chasing smoke. The kudzu remained. With new vigor, I groped my ladder and descended into the hole once more. The ground gave way to my shovel with ease, and I made great progress. Unlike the last times I had dug, I remained fully conscious. My body quivered with joy, and I expanded the whole to a new depth and width. Every strike with my shovel gave me more strength. Every inch of dirt removed gave me a new sense of purpose. I must see the secret beneath the surface. Jasper barked incessantly in the background.

“Won't that damn dog shut its mouth. I need this hole. And this hole needs me,” I told myself, unable to hear the insanity in my mind.

To me, the thought was not insane. The thought was perfectly rational. It was true in my heart, even if it would only be true for that moment.  The dog of my dear friend I had grown to adore, had become the enemy in my mind. Barking like an alarm sounding in the night.

“That nosy Creed better not come over here and see this.” The worry was loud in my mind, but the need to dig was louder. I dug that whole night. Enjoying every second of it. I had forgotten how the hole filled me. The more I dug, the more the emptiness in me was replaced. The deeper I went, the farther I drifted from my normal, boring, bland self.

The sun rose with ease that morning, and I climbed out of the hole with no signs of weariness. My day was easy, and I was once again the man that I had always wanted to be, because of the hole. I didn't want to risk falling back into my anonymity again. I couldn't risk going back to who I was before. A nobody. Now I am a somebody, and I won't give that up.

I dug every night for a month. All night. I did not need sleep. The hole supported me. As the hole grew deeper, so did my relationship with Sarah. We soon became friends, and later we went on a few dates. Nothing too serious, just a peck goodnight on the third date. Finally, I had been close to a woman. Finally, I had found what I had been lacking. Her scent and presence were intoxicating. The only thing that could tear me away from her was that beautiful hole I dug in my backyard.

That over-imposing neighbor, Creed, stopped by asking all manner of questions.

“Ive heard some noises coming from the back of your house. Is everything all right?” he would question

“Yes, everything is fine,” I said shortly. “Now, can you please get your dog to be quiet at night? It's ruining my concentration.”

“Concentration?” he said, “I thought you was a heavy sleeper. You seem different. You're not your normal self. You know, if something had happened, you can always come by and talk about it.”

“I think what I really need is old men to stop coming by and trying to diagnose me,” I said in a flat, angry tone, “now can you leave me alone and let me have my privacy?”

His face fell as I had struck a nerve. “I didn’ mean nothing by it. I'll make sure i won't be bothering you again.”

I closed the door as he left. I didn't need an old man; I had my new friends at work. Most importantly, I had the hole.

I felt as though I could no longer be stopped. I had become the version of myself I saw in my dreams. I was the best version of myself. I was no longer a goldfish in a bowl, but I was a shark hunting in the sea. Thanks to the hole. Words flowed easily from my lips. People began to think I was funny. Me. Funny. Before I was a spineless worm, they stepped over. Now I am a mountain that they look to admire. Thanks to the hole. Sarah began to sit with me during lunch. Her eyes beautiful, growing in admiration each day

“Wow, tell me more,” she would say. I haven't the faintest idea what I would say, but everyone would hang on the edge of my words. I felt like a snake charmer playing his tune. What I said, they followed.

“Hey, boss, let me take your office,” I would boldly propose.

“Of course, my guy! Anything for my favorite employee,” he would eagerly agree.

Anything I asked for, they obliged.
I had made up my mind. I would get what I really always wanted out of Sarah.

I wanted to be more than just friends.

Once more, just as quickly as it began, it all stopped.  I just needed a couple more days, and I could get what I needed from Sarah. The hole had run dry. The once soft earth had died and become hard. I had dug for months. The hole had begun to overtake my backyard.  As the soil became tougher, I felt the swagger I had gained leave my body. I felt the lost nights slowly begin to take their toll on me.

“You don't look so good,” they would say to me when I arrived at work. The bags under my eyes are growing deeper and darker every day. My arms would shake from the strain I had put on them from my nights of digging. My once easy life has now become hard.I felt like the men who moved everything just to California during the gold rush. Just to get there and see the vein had run dry

The traffic slowly returned. I was no longer funny. The people whom I thought had become my friends had begun to lose interest in my opinions, and they slowly began to withdraw. The worst of it all was that I began to lose Sarah. She was the person I had looked forward to in the morning. It was as if the past weeks had left her mind completely. How could this be?. I became the shadow I was before that damn hole infected my life. I had it all. Now I have nothing. All because of the hole.

“Dig, dig, dig.”I would mock myself, “You ruined your life over some stupid nightmare, believing that there was a power in the earth. It was only a shot of adrenaline from moving to a new place. You stupid nobody.”

I returned home from work one night to find my back gate left ajar.

“I never leave my gate open. Ever.”

I walked back cautiously, hoping to find that it had just been a mistake and nothing more.

It was something more.

As I turned the corner of my house, I found Creed standing over my hole, staring down into it. He was rubbing his hands anxiously through his thinning blonde hair.

“Why didn't you tell me you heard the kudzu grow, too?” he called out to me
