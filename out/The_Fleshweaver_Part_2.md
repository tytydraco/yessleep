The fluorescent lights above us buzzed and flickered like the erratic pulse of a failing heart, while the air conditioner hummed loudly in its battle against the remnants of the summer humidity. Finn used a magnifying glass to inspect photos strewn across the table as I arranged and pinned them to the wall, creating a visual narrative of our investigation.

"It's the precision that gets me," he said, breaking the silence. It was almost to himself as if I were a mere spectator to his thoughts. "The cuts, the implants—it's all so surgical, so meticulous. I’ve seen my fair share of hatchet jobs; nothing quite like this.”  

The sudden shrill ring of the office phone sliced through the monotony of the fluorescent buzz overhead. Finn reached over with a swift motion, lifting the receiver. "Agent Finn," he answered. “Yes, I sent those over a few days ago.” 

I watched him closely as his brow furrowed, the initial flicker of curiosity in his eyes quickly shifting into concern. With a pen poised over his notepad he began to scribble notes with increasing urgency.  

"Armanen? Modified Younger Futhark… Geheimnis der Runen… And Ariosophy? Are you certain?" Finn's voice grew sharper with each question, his gaze never leaving the papers as he made quick, precise notations.  

He started speaking before even hanging up the phone. "The symbols are linked to a belief system called Ariosophy. Originated in 20th-century Austria and Germany. It's a niche area, connected with ethnic purity and some very radical ideologies. The symbols are modified versions of traditional Scandinavian runes.”   

I paused for a moment processing the revelations before turning back to my map. “Well, that's interesting. But, I don’t see how that could lead someone to start butchering school teachers.”

Finn's fingers rhythmically tapped the table as he pondered my comment. He leaned back, closing his eyes. "Consider it a perverse form of artistry," he suggested. "This was clearly an act of creation in their eyes.”

"Artistry..." I echoed, the word tasting sour on my tongue. "What makes you think that?”

“Most ritualistic killings are just about the killing. They are violence for violence's sake, pain for pain’s sake. It’s a rebellion against life itself, so the more innocent the victim the better. That’s why they usually start off with animals.”

I stopped pinning photos to listen more intently to his words.

“But rarely, it's about more than that. It’s about metamorphosing God’s creation into something that appeases whatever twisted deity they subscribe to. It’s about breaking their mind, body, and soul and using the remnants to paint their doctrines in a way only the initiated can understand.”

Before I could respond, the static crackle of the radio broke the silence. “Detective, this is Martinez. Come in. Please respond.”

I picked up the receiver. “This is Detective Hunt. Go ahead.”

“It’s about Allison Novak. You need to come to the cemetery. Now.”

My heart skipped a beat. “What’s happened?”

“It’s better if you see for yourself.”

Under the glow of the full moon, Martinez, Finn, and my flashlights bounced around the gaping hole in the earth where Allison Novak's grave once stood.

I turned to Martinez, “When did this happen?”

He checked his watch, "We got the call from the groundskeeper around 11:30. The cemetery closes at sundown, so it must have been in the last few hours. Given the narrow paths here, no vehicle could have gotten close; they had to move on foot. With the gates locked at sundown, carrying her out to the main road would be too risky—they probably headed into the woods.”

“That makes sense,” Finn murmured, his gaze following the line of trees that bordered the cemetery.  
"I'll head back to the car and call for backup.” Martinez followed. “We need to seal off this area and start a search before they get any further."

"Good idea, keep us posted," I responded, nodding in agreement.

Under the glow of the full moon, the dense foliage of the woods enveloped us as Finn and I stepped into the tree line, our flashlights cutting through the darkness. The damp earth muffled our footsteps, and the cool night air carried the faint rustling of leaves. With guns drawn, we moved cautiously, our eyes scanning the shadowy underbrush and the thick trunks of ancient trees. As clouds drifted across the moon, the forest shifted several shades darker.  

Minutes stretched into an eternity, and soon it felt as though we were isolated from the world, our sense of direction blurred amidst the uniformity of the trees. A sudden snap of a twig spun us around, guns and lights aiming at the source of the noise. The glowing eyes of a deer stared back at us, it's form frozen in our beams for a moment before it darted away. We exhaled in unison, the tension briefly easing. "Keep it together," I said to myself, striving to calm my racing pulse.  

Near where the deer had been, something unusual caught my eye—a dark, bulky shape that seemed out of place among the natural contours of the forest. As we drew closer, the shape clarified into the form of a coffin, its lid splintered. I crouched down for a closer look, noting the bowing of the wood. It didn’t make sense, but the damage suggested that it had been broken from the inside.  

I turned to Finn, but before I could speak, a chilling clicking noise emanated from the darkness, growing louder before fading into nothingness. We instinctively froze, our breaths held in fear. After a moment, the sound began again, crescendoed, then faded away. Our lights moved slowly towards the sound before converging on the unimaginable. Allison Novak was perched on a log not fifteen feet from us. Her ribs, onced splayed outwardly now clicked together at the tips in a soft, undulating pattern.   

Finn inched toward the hideous figure with what I could only imagine was fascination and disbelief. Before I was able to comprehend what was happening, a loud thud reverberated from Finn’s direction. A shovel swung out of the shadows struck squarely on the side of his head. He fell like a stone, unconscious before he hit the ground.  

Allison, now a grotesque parody of her former self, unfolded her limbs bizarrely, her ribs expanding outward like wings. A shrill, unholy scream erupted from her distorted mouth as she advanced. I adjusted my aim to her and fired. The bullets tore into her, drawing spurts of dark blood that hung in the air as mist. Each hit seemed futile; she continued her approach, undeterred. My heart raced as the final bullet left the chamber with a resounding click, signaling empty.  

Panic overwhelmed me. Turning on my heel, I ran. I don’t know how long I ran. I didn’t even know what direction I was running in. By the grace of God, after a few minutes I burst out into an open field; the graveyard, only a few dozen yards from where we had entered. I sprinted across the field, my eyes fixed on the small beacon of hope—the car where Martinez was waiting.  

"Martinez!" I shouted, my voice cracking under the strain of terror. "We need help! Finn's down—"  

His response was the cold, metallic click of a shotgun being leveled at me, his features set in a resolute mask.  

"Martinez, no," I stuttered, stopping abruptly, my hands instinctively raising in defense. "Don’t do this."  

“You should’ve known not to come here,” he spat, cocking the gun. “You aren’t welcome. Never were.”   

I squeezed my eyes shut as a shot rang out in the night. However, after a moment, I realized two things. First, I appeared to still be alive. Second, the sound was a crack, not a boom.  

Slowly opening my eyes, I saw Martinez dead in front of me, half his brain on the side of my car. 

Turning back to the woods I saw Edgar Holt peering from above a rock, smoke from his barrel wafting into the night.

Rain traced silver lines down the windowpane, the soft drumming sound filling the small cabin with a rhythm that seemed to echo my scattered thoughts. Outside, the gray light of dawn cast a solemn glow over the wet forest, turning the leaves into glistening jewels against a somber backdrop.  

Just as the weight of my worries threatened to pull me under, the scent of tomatoes and herbs gently filled the air. I turned to find Edgar placing a steaming bowl of soup on the wooden table near me.  

"Thought you might need something warm," he said.  

I managed a small, thankful smile and took the bowl from him, the warmth from the ceramic seeping into my cold fingers. Edgar pulled out a chair and sat down opposite me.  

Edgar stirred his own bowl of soup before he spoke. “After the war, the government brought over some scientist folk from Germany to work on the space program and whatnot. You know, to beat the Russians. Friedrich Klaus was one of them. Though, most just call him Fritz.”  

He paused, taking a careful sip of his soup, letting the moment linger. I didn’t interrupt, feeling the weight of what was to come.  

“They were interested in him specifically because he knew more than anyone on how to keep humans alive in extreme circumstances. What most people don’t know is that he learned all of that by studying under Doctor Mengele. You recognize the name?”  

The mere mention of Mengele made my blood run cold. It was a name that belonged to a distant, nightmarish past, not to my reality. I simply nodded slowly in response.  

“After he was done with his contract he was a free man. Decided to pitch his tent here in the late 50s with his wife, Gretta. Now, say what you will about Fritz, I'm sure he has a spot in hell reserved with his name on it. But his wife? I believe you’ve made her acquaintance.”  

“The eulogy at the funeral.” I immediately knew who he meant.  

“Yes ma’am. But there’s more to her than just unsettling speeches at funerals. From the moment she arrived, Gretta fashioned herself as a socialite, weaving her and her family’s way into every corner of our local life—government, churches, even the police force.”  

Edgar’s voice grew grim, his eyes darkening with the weight of his thoughts. “Over the decades, they’ve been poisoning the well of our community with their deranged beliefs. All that nonsense about ancient Aryan civilizations and racial purity—started as whispers in dinner parties and church basements. But it didn’t stay quiet.”  

He leaned forward, his hands clasped tightly together. “Now, it’s like they’ve got tendrils in everything. Gretta’s charm and influence turned darker with each year. She’s no ordinary town gossip; she’s been slowly reshaping our town’s heart and mind with those twisted ideas of hers.”  

I silently absorbed his words.  

“Being a god-fearing American,” Edgar continued, a trace of bitterness in his tone, “I once told her exactly what I thought of her twisted world view. Can’t say it won me any popularity contests. Turned half the damn town against me. That’s why I live here, where I can’t be bothered.”  

“I’m so sorry.” I started. “That must’ve been tough.”  

“It was lonely at first, sure. But considering everything that’s happened since, I’ve come to appreciate the peace out here,” Edgar replied with a smile. “I kept to myself, and they mostly kept away from me. But that all changed the day I reported that body in the woods. Now I have a big ‘ol target on my back. ‘Betrayed the community’, they say.”  

My thoughts snapped back to Finn. “They've taken my partner. Any idea where they might be holding him?”  

“Afraid not,” Edgar replied with a somber expression. “But I reckon you already know who does.”

At that moment, I felt a fire course through my veins. A way to save Finn. “Edgar, I can’t thank you enough for all you’ve shared.”

“If you really want to thank me,” he said sharply, “take down that witch and her minions. That’d be thanks enough.”

I nodded, feeling the weight of the task ahead. “I’m out of ammo. Got any 9mm?”

Edgar chuckled dryly, shaking his head. “You’re not going out hunting rabbits. Here, I have something for you. You ever seen Dirty Harry?” He said, reached into an old wooden chest and pulled out a heavy, robust-looking revolver. He slid it across the table and placed down a few boxes of rounds. “44 Remmy Magnum. If I were hunting demons, this is what I’d take.”

I took the gun, feeling its weight in my palm. “Thank you, Edgar. I won’t let this go to waste.”
