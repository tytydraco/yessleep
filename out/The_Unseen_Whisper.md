Elliot Harper was a man of routine. His days flowed like clockwork: wake up at 6:30 AM, shower, eat breakfast, catch the 7:15 AM train, work from 9 to 5, return home, and repeat. He was content, perhaps even proud, of the rhythm that governed his life. But over the last few weeks, something had shifted.

It started with small things—barely noticeable, really. A misplaced pen here, an oddly folded shirt there. At first, Elliot chalked it up to simple forgetfulness. After all, who didn’t lose track of things every now and then? But as the days wore on, the anomalies grew more frequent and unnerving.

One morning, Elliot woke to find every single drawer in his kitchen pulled open. It was as if someone had rifled through them, searching for something. He stood in the middle of the room, staring at the scene, trying to remember if he had done this himself and simply forgotten. But no matter how hard he tried, the memory eluded him.

That night, the sound started.

It was a faint whispering, barely audible, like the soft rustle of leaves in a distant forest. At first, Elliot dismissed it as the wind or maybe the pipes in his old apartment building. But the whispering persisted, growing louder each night. It was unintelligible, just a low murmur that seemed to emanate from the walls, filling his bedroom with an eerie, unsettling presence.

Elliot began to lose sleep. The whispers clawed at his mind, keeping him awake at night, and during the day, he found it hard to concentrate at work. His boss noticed the bags under his eyes, the way his hands trembled slightly as he typed, but when she asked if he was okay, Elliot simply smiled and assured her it was nothing. Just a rough patch, he said.

But it wasn’t just a rough patch. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, and with them came strange visions—flickers of movement in the corner of his eye, shadows that darted out of sight the moment he turned his head. And then there were the messages.

One morning, Elliot found a note scrawled on his bathroom mirror in what looked like condensation. It read, "Don’t trust your mind." He stared at it, his heart pounding in his chest. Who could have written it? He lived alone; no one had access to his apartment. Was this a prank? Had someone broken in?

He spent hours searching his apartment for signs of an intruder, but nothing was out of place. And yet, the note was there, clear as day. As the days passed, more messages appeared—on the walls, on scraps of paper left on his desk, even on the ceiling above his bed. "They’re watching you." "You’re not alone." "It’s all in your head."

Elliot’s world began to unravel. He started skipping work, afraid to leave his apartment, afraid of what might happen if he did. He barricaded himself inside, but the whispers followed him. They grew louder, until they were no longer whispers but screams, echoing inside his skull.

He tried to reach out for help. He called his sister, his best friend, even his old college roommate, but none of them answered. Every time he dialed a number, the line went dead, the only sound on the other end a low, static hiss. It was as if the world outside had disappeared, leaving Elliot trapped in a nightmare of his own making.

One night, after days of no sleep, no food, and no contact with the outside world, Elliot snapped. He grabbed a hammer from his toolbox and began smashing the walls of his apartment, desperate to find the source of the whispers. He tore through the drywall, ripping it apart with his bare hands, until his fingers bled and his knuckles were raw.

Finally, he reached the source. Behind the walls, hidden in the darkness, was a small, black box. It was old and covered in dust, but as he picked it up, the whispers stopped. The silence was deafening, pressing in on him from all sides.

Elliot stared at the box, his mind racing. What was it? Why had it been hidden there? Trembling, he pried it open.

Inside, he found a stack of old, faded photographs. They were pictures of him—sleeping, eating, going about his daily routine. But there was something wrong with the images. In each one, a shadowy figure lurked in the background, its features indistinct, like a smudge on a camera lens.

He flipped through the photos, his hands shaking. In the last one, the figure was standing right behind him, its hand reaching out towards his shoulder. The sight of it sent a jolt of terror through him, and he dropped the photos, stumbling back in horror.

As the photos fluttered to the ground, something else fell from the box—a small, leather-bound journal. Elliot picked it up, his breath coming in short, panicked gasps. The journal was old, its pages yellowed with age. He opened it to the first page and began to read.

The journal belonged to a man named Henry Mallory, who had lived in the apartment over fifty years ago. Like Elliot, Henry had heard the whispers, had seen the shadows, had been driven to the brink of madness by the unseen presence that haunted the apartment. But unlike Elliot, Henry had discovered the truth before it was too late.

In his final entry, Henry wrote: "The voices, the shadows, the fear… it’s all in my head. They’re not real. I’m not real. I’m trapped in a nightmare of my own making. If you’re reading this, know that you are too. There is no escape, for this prison is your mind, and the only way out is to let go."

Elliot’s heart pounded as he read the words. The realization hit him like a ton of bricks. The whispers, the shadows, the fear—they weren’t real. They had never been real. He was the one who was slowly going mad, his mind unraveling piece by piece.

But as he stood there, the journal clutched in his hands, a cold, cruel laugh echoed through the apartment. It wasn’t a whisper, nor was it a scream. It was the laugh of something ancient and malevolent, something that had been watching him all along.

And then, in a voice that was not his own, Elliot spoke. "You’re wrong, Henry. We are real. And we’re not done with you yet."

The last thing Elliot heard before the darkness swallowed him whole was the sound of his own laughter, echoing through the empty apartment, mingling with the whispers that had never truly left.
