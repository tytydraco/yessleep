Post 1  
  
I want to start off by saying that english isn't my first language, and I don't even know if this is the right place for this story, but I have to tell it. There's something weitd going on. All names have been changed for obvious reasons.  
  
I'm an electronics engineer and my usual work is easy money. I spend most of my time in maintenance tunnels under an industrial facility owned by G-Company. If you've never heard of G-Company, you're like me, before a former colleague recommended the position to me. The grounds make it seem like G-Company is worth millions, but the company itself is very secretive. So much so that even to this day I don't know what industry G-Company is in exactly. I know that alone would have deterred many from working here at all, but I was in urgent need of employment at the time and the pay was exceptionally good, plus the benefits that G-Company offered were well beyond the minimum standard. Of course, all of this triggered some inner alarms in me, but the offer was too tempting, so I sent off my application.  
  
When I received the e-mail informing me that I'd gotten the job, I was both delighted and confused. I've never had an interview or anything like that and I was getting more and more uncomfortable. Finally, I decided to just give it a shot. „What’s the worst thing that could happen?“, I thought. The e-mail also invited me to a meeting where I would be informed about my exact tasks and sign the employment contract.  
  
On the agreed day, I took my car to the given address and finally reached the extensively fenced-off premises of the industrial site that G-Company ran, which I found to be deep in the forrest in the middle of nowhere. The road led to a small hut with a barrier attached. As I got closer, I saw a man in a black uniform sitting in the hut, bored, cell phone in hand. He raised an eyebrow when he heard my car and pushed a button on a control panel in front of him. "Yes, please?" came his voice, distorted over the intercom.  
  
"My name is Thomas Williams, I'm a new hire and have an appointment with G-Company?" I briefly explained in a questioning tone. The man nodded and turned his attention to a computer screen next to the panel. He scrolled the mouse wheel for a while, typed something on his keyboard and finally nodded again. "Ah, here we have it, Mister Williams. Your meeting will take place in the offices above Hall 4.” The man said curtly. I thanked him, parked my car and got out. Looking around, I found myself in a vast plaza of concrete and tar, dotted with cubic buildings, their walls clad in blue corrugated iron and smoke rising from the chimneys on their roofs. Each of the buildings was decorated with a large red number next to the front gate. I looked around for a while until I found the hall marked with a 4 and went inside.  
  
The factory, or whatever it was, was noisy and stuffy, innumerable machines performing a task unkown to me, while being operated by men and women in blue overalls and goggles. Some glanced my way as I entered the hall, but quickly went back to their work.  
  
A man in the same uniform as the gate keeper approached me. "You must be Mister Williams, right?" he inquired. I confirmed his guess. "Follow me, you are expected in the office." He said without introducing himself and walked off before I could say anything about it. The man led me to an elevator and we went to the second floor, to what appeared to be the offices, the whole time an awkward silence between us. We walked down a windowless corridor of bare concrete, lit by cold neon lights hanging from the ceiling.  
  
Finally, we stopped at one of the black doors that branched off to the left and right of it. "Here we are, Mister Williams. I'm happy to welcome you as a new employee.” He said and headed back towards the elevator before I could reply. Strange guy, I thought, and entered the room. Inside, a congregation of anonymous suits awaited me, seated at a long, black table, in a room that resembled the hallway in appearance, making it feel less like a meetingroom and more like a place for interrogations.  
  
Those present introduced themselves and gave me the usual text about how pleased they were that I had chosen their company, and so on. I asked why there hadn't been an interview, and one of the women at the table, Miss Wayne, claimed that with my previous experience I was almost overqualified for the position and that it needed to be filled as soon as possible. I wondered why the pay and benefits were so good, and Miss Wayne reiterated that they needed someone to fill the position quickly and that they hoped the high pay would attract qualified applicants faster. The whole thing was still a bit strange to me, but I didn't want to allow such a small, uneasy feeling to take away such a chance.  
  
We talked a bit more about my job, which I would be doing here from now on. Throughout the conversation, the rest of those present wrote something down, but I couldn't make out what. Their cold, uncaring gaze wandered to me whenever Miss Wayne spoke and back to the paper when I answered. The atmosphere was tense, which went well with the bare concrete room. I was told I would service and repair the electrical equipment underneath Hall 4, specifically around Gate 2, though I didn't know what that meant at the time.  
  
Eventually, Miss Wayne explained to me that I would have to sign a non-disclosure agreement before they could hand me the employment contract. She slid some papers over to me and I quickly went over them. This document, too, made me uneasy, because in addition to the usual lines there were some odd additions, for example, I was not even allowed to discuss my work with my coworkers, and even only with selected members of management. I was afraid I might have slipped into some sort of secret government project or something, but I felt silly for that thought, and I've never been a particularly talkative person either way, so keeping quiet would be easy for me.  
  
I just want to reiterate that, at the time, I really needed a job, I was behind on my rent, and I was in debt basically everywhere debt was possible, just to explain why I was so eager to jump at a job offering where something clearly wasn’t right. "What's the catch?" I asked before signing. “We understand of course that what we offer may seem 'too good to be true' and yes, the work you do here is simple, yet not without its dangers. The G-Company works with some... hazardous substances, which are stored in the tunnels, among other places. Leaks or damages can result in these substances escaping into the tunnels, but don't worry Mister Williams, we have taken all the necessary safety measures to ensure your health is not in any danger. Among other things, we have our own infirmary with experienced specialists who take care of you and all of your problems.” Miss Wayne explained with a fake, callous smile.  
  
I signed the agreement and the management present looked happy. Finally, I received the employment contract and read it through. To my relief, it contained everything the offer had promised. I signed it too and Miss Wayne assured me I had made the right decision and the rest of the congregation nodded in agreement. She said I would be trained for the first few weeks by none other than my former colleague, Eric Lewis, who first made me aware of the position. I thanked them and made my way to the elevator to go down into the tunnels.  
  
The maintenance tunnels under Hall 4 look similar to the corridor, only in a much worse condition. The steel-reinforced concrete walls are crumbling away in many places, exposing the rusting metal grid at their core. Seeming miles of cables run along the walls between devices and equipment and some disappear into the ceiling, presumably to the machines in the hall above. The air is stale and warm and filled with a strange humidity.  
  
As I stepped out of the elevator into the maze-like tunnel system, I saw Eric walking towards me. He smiled triumphantly at me, and said: "Well, Thomas, that's how we meet again." "Hello, Eric. So you're the one training me.” I stated shortly and Eric nodded. "Seems like it. It's the other way around this time.” I was in charge of training Eric back at the company where I met him. "I've been here for quite a while and I know my way around, plus my workspace is right next to yours, I work at Gate 3, I guess that's why they assigned me." He explained and I got curious. "Speaking of which, what's up with these gates, like, what are they?" I wondered. Eric laughed. “We will gget to that. Today it's time for the basics. The curcuits here are very interesting and complex, so you'll have to rethink things a bit." He said as we went deeper into the tunnels.  
  
I watched Eric at work for some time as he explained the actually quite... unique circuits and connections to me and what to do when they became damaged or worn out. Most of the work consisted of checking the same equipment over and over again in a specific area of the tunnels, and ensuring quick repairs in the event of failure. at first it was surprisingly dificult to understand some of the seemingly pointless circuitry, even with my years of experience, but I figured it out eventually.  
  
Finally, after some time, Eric led me to a long tunnel with a heavy red metal door at the end. The seemingly once bright red paint had faded and was peeling off in many places, where dark patches of rust had formed. The door was old, very old, in appearance even older than the tunnels around it, and yet it seemed solid enough to withstand a bomb. "That's Gate 2." Eric explained briefly while still looking at the door.  
  
"It is very important that you never open it, remember that. The area beyond is very strictly forbidden.” “Why, what's beyond that?” I interjected, forgetting about the NDA we both signed for a moment. "I would have had to open it to know that, right? Whatever it is, employees like us don't need to know. Even if I knew, I wouldn't be able to tell you.” He looked away from Gate 2 and met my eyes. 

"I know you and your curiosity, keep your hands off it. It was difficult for me too at first, but the instructions come from the very top, and you don't want any problems with them.” He said with a serious look on his face, and he was probably right. I didn't even know who the people at the top here were. Was it the management I met on my first day here? I doubted it. It could have been anyone, from some rich people to the CIA, and I didn't want to find out.  
  
"Sometimes… things happen around the gates." Eric continued. "The management has probably already told you about the hazardous materials that are stored down here?" I nodded in agreement. "If you hear strange noises or see things, there's probably a leak. Contact security and get the hell out of the area. Have you been given a radio yet?” “Um, no.” I replied. The sight of the door right in front of me made the whole thing seem a lot more real suddenly. Eric nodded through tight lips and said, "Fine, I'll make sure you get one then."  
  
We continued our work together for a few more days after this interaction, until Eric said I was ready to take over my section of the tunnels myself, and that he would return to his own area at Gate 3. "I still don't have a radio for you, but it can't be long before you get it. Incidents are rare here and I'm sure everything will be fine.” He claimed, but I didn't share his confidence. “Okay, Thomas, I'll let you get back to working. If you have any questions, you know where to find me.” Eric said and walked away waving.  
  
The next few days went well, and I found my way around easily without Eric's help. The red door had indeed caught my attention, but I thought of Eric's words, and the instruction not to open it seemed very serious. Still, I found myself staring down the long tunnel way too often, wondering what lay beyond. Each time, a sudden noise from the machinery overhead would snap me out of my thoughts and I continued to work.  
  
My life outside of work was also going well, I was able to pay my debts and even get my car repaired. G-Company took care of everything and I didn't have to worry, so I enjoyed my life and work. I was so engrossed in all of it, that I had almost forgotten the forbidden door. That was until the first incident today.  
  
I already knew early in the Morning, when I arrived at the site, that something was wrong, even though the day seemed like every other at first. I made my way into the tunnels to do the same work I've been doing for a few months now. The air was warm and humid, as usual, and yet there was a certain tension in it that I couldn't place. I got to work and it wasn't long before the door caught my eye again. I didn't hold myself up with it for too long though, I was too focused on my work. At some point, while traveling in another part of my section, I heard a strange noise in the distance. At first I thought I was imagining it, but then I heard it again, it was like a deep, powerful banging. I assumed it was coming from the machines in Hall 4 above me, but a third bang was clearly coming from down here. I followed the strangely regular thumping and it got louder and louder.  
  
Eventually I found myself at the opening of the long tunnel, with the door at the other end. The noise was loudest here, and I approached the forbidden gate 2. As I got closer, I noticed that the door vibrated under each blow and fine flakes of rust fell to the ground like snow. I still didn't have a radio, so I couldn't call security. I probably should have reported to Eric, or anyone, but a sudden, indescribable feeling came over me, pulling me closer to the door.

I took a few more steps in it's direction and finally stood directly in front of it. The banging was now mingled with the faint metallic echo of the door, making it sound almost like a distant bell, chiming regularly like a slow heartbeat. The feeling, which I still can't even begin to describe, had almost turned into a trance, and it took me actual effort to stop my own arm, which was slowly moving towards the handle.  
  
Suddenly Eric's voice yelled something from behind, but I couldn't make out what he was saying, then I heard quick footsteps running toward me as I continued to stare at the door, hypnotized by the unexplianed sound. The next few moments passed in a flash, an arm wrapped around me and jerked me away from the door. Eric pulled out his radio and reported the incident, saying there were "victims," whatever that meant. As I slowly regained my senses, I continued to hear the steady rhythm of the inexplicable thumping. Suddenly there was a loud, thunderous bang, which echoed repeatedly in the tunnels, and everything fell silent.  
  
A little later, men in the black uniforms of the security department with gas masks and helmets on their heads ran past us, while Eric led me out of the tunnels. If it was a chemical leak or something, as Miss Wayne had suggested, it didn't explain the assault rifles and combat gear they were carrying. Whatever lies behind the door, it must be more than simple hazardous materials, right?  
  
One of the security men approached us when we were almost at the elevator. "You two have to come with me. Management is expecting you for a debrief.” Came a muffled voice from under the mask. Eric nodded and noticing my puzzled, slightly scared look reassured me we weren't in trouble, and again I found it hard to share his optimism. At least no one but Eric had seen me, as I was about to open the door. He said this type of debriefing was common in incidents of this nature, and that, too, reassured me a little for some reason. We followed the man to the elevator, went up to Hall 4, and finally on to the offices above. Again, I stared down the hallway I had last walked on my first day here.  
  
Although it resembles the tunnels deep below in terms of the materials used, the atmosphere here is the complete opposite; While the maintenance tunnels look warm, worn and...alive, this hallway is clinically cold and looks almost as if it had been built yesterday.  
  
We walked down the hall, still accompanied by the security guard. He led us to one of the black doors that had a sign with the word "Site Management" on it. Our companion knocked, and when a voice invited us in, we entered the room. I was surprised, as the room was very different from the rest of the building. Instead of bare concrete, red patterned wallpaper line the walls, and the floor is covered with dark laminate. In the center back of the room stands a heavy, ornate oak desk, surrounded by bookshelves, finalizing the almost comical look of the "boss's office."  
  
Behind the desk, on a large office chair made of dark leather, what else, sat a man in a light gray suit whom I hadn't seen before. He was younger than me, but there was an incredible experience in his face. His gaze was cold and serious as he rose. "Ah, there you are. Please, have a seat.” He said, pointing to the two chairs across from him, and we did just that. The man's, icy blue eyes, cold like everyone else's around here, met mine. "Mister Williams, I berlieve we haven't been introduced yet." He said and reached his hand out to me across the table. “I am the site manager here in this facility. My name isn't important, so just call me Mister G.”  
  
“Pleasure to meet you.” I replied hesitantly, shaking his hand. I figured the name of the site manager I worked for actually was quite important, but I was too nervous to comment at the moment. "Well then, Mister Williams, Mister Lewis, tell me what happened." Mister G instructed us. I could barely get a word out, because I didn't want to tell the man about my trance or how close I got to the door. "There... well, there was such a weird banging noise." I stammered insecurely and Mister G raised an eyebrow. "A banging you say? Are you sure it didn't come from the machines?” I shook my head. "No, um, I'm sure it come from..." I hesitated. "It came from the door, and..."  
  
Lucky for me, Eric interrupted: "And when Thomas, excuse me, Mister Williams, figured that out, they immediately came to me to report the incident." He claimed and I tried my best not to show my relief. "And why didn't Mister Williams report the incident himself?" Mister G continued digging. "I don't know why, but Williams still hasn't received their own radio." Mister G's eyes widened and the mood of the whole room changed. "I'm speechless, forgive me, Mister Williams. I can't believe they let you work without a radio. Incidents like this can quickly… escalate, if security isn't notified in time.” He leaned back in his chair, relieved.  
  
"Well, I have to admit I was a little suspicious at first as to why Mister Lewis reported an incident in your section, but considering that fact, I have to commend you for your quick decision." He said, leaning forward again, his gaze again more serious and questioning. “It really could have ended badly if you had investigated the phenomenon further. But luckily you didn't do that, right? You contacted Mister Lewis right away?” I nodded and the nervousness returned. 

Did Mister G suspect something? Had my facial expressions betrayed us? "Y-Yes, I did." I replied. There was a brief, tense moment of silence, before Mister G finally sank back into his chair. "Well, we should still send you to the infirmary for a little check-up. Then you can take the rest of the day off, while we deal with the… aftermath, of what happened.” I wanted to breathe a sigh of relief, but I could stop myself. "The same applies to you, Mister Lewis." He said to Eric and turned back to me: "Right now I want to make sure that you have a radio in your hands at the start of your shift tomorrow."  
  
We said our goodbyes and the security guard who had been waiting behind us the whole time ushered us out and to the elevator. We went down to Hall 4 and the security man wanted to know if we could find the infirmary ourselves. When Eric confirmed this, he left us and went back to his usual duty. Eric led me out of the hall, across the premises to a building I had never noticed before. It was smaller than the halls, and its exterior walls were plastered white instead of blue corrugated metal. A glowing red cross graced its entrance, making it look more like an entire hospital than a simple ward. We entered the entrance area, in which a reception was located.  
  
The young woman serving the front desk looked up from her computer monitor when she noticed us. "Yes, please?" "We're here for a follow-up check." Eric explained curtly and the woman nodded. "I'll tell Doctor Fernsby, please have a seat in the waiting area." The woman said, pointing to an adjoining room where rows of chairs were set up. Eric thanked her and we sat down. There was no one in the room but us, the chairs empty and the magazines on a table in the corner untouched. When I was sure no one was listening, I asked Eric the one question that had been bothering me the whole time: "What the hell just happened?" Eric looked at me, pity and amusement in equal measure in his look.  
  
"I have to disappoint you Thomas, I know about as much as you do. Anyway, I can tell you that incidents like this are fairly rare, so don't worry. OI still want to know one thing though.” He said and leaned closer to me, as if there was still a possibility that we were overheard. "Why did you want to open the door, when I told you how strictly forbidden it is?" he demanded in a half-whisper. I felt caught and hung my head. "I don't know, I had this weird feeling like my actions weren't my own." I tried to explain, expecting surprise in Eric's look, maybe shock, or worry. 

What I didn't expect was that Eric, unfazed, nodded his head like he'd heard my words a hundred times. "You hear that around here sometimes. As I said, we're in the same boat, I can only guess what it is. Maybe the fumes coming through the door can induce hallucinations or something. I can only advise you to keep that part to yourself for now.” I wanted to ask why, as I felt it would be important for the examination to know if I had inhaled any fumes, but everything about this company was so strange that I had no strength to question it further. Eric was one of the few here whose name I even knew, and the only one I could trust, so that's exactly what I would do.  
  
Finally, an older man with long, gray hair and round glasses on his nose walked into the room. He was dressed in a white lab coat with his name, "Dr. Fernsby,” on a name tag on his chest. "Well, Mister Lewis, I hear you're here for a check-up after an incident in the tunnels?" His voice sounded exactly as I had imagined; full of the energy of an inquisitive scientist and a slight undertone of madness. Eric confirmed his guess. "Well, come with me then." Doctor Fernsby urged him. "Don't worry, Mister Williams, I'll be with you before long."  
  
Coupled with the old doctor's almost manic energy, these words sounded almost more like a threat than a promise. Again my eyes must havgiven me away, as Doctor Fernsby raised his eyebrows questioningly when his gaze met mine. Before he could ask any questions, Eric explained the situation: “Mister Williams is new here, today was his first incident. He's still a bit… overwhelmed.” The doctor laughed. "Oh, Mister Williams, don't worry. This examination is protocol after incidents of this kind, and completely unnecessary in most cases. It is very unlikely that your health will be compromised.” He tried to calm me down without much success.  
  
Eventually, the two disappeared, leaving me alone in the waiting room. I pulled out my phone to pass the time and waited. Finally, through the window of the room, I saw the elevator doors in the opposite wall of the reception open and Doctor Fernsby and Eric came out. Eric shook the doctor's hand with a smile that gave me a little confidence. Eric approached me while the doctor was still talking to the receptionist. "I'll make my way home then." He said. "Keep calm, everything is fine." He reassured me and disappeared.  
  
Shortly after, Doctor Fernsby opened the door to the waiting room. "Alright, Mister Williams, come along then." He said to me and we went to the elevator. "Your first incident then. Well, I can imagine that you are quite confused.” He said while we walked through the entrance hall. "Indeed." I confirmed curtly and Doctor Fernsby nodded. "Unfortunately I can't give you many answers either, as you know, the G-Company takes their secrecy very seriously. Even I don't have a lot of knowledge about the underground, although I undoubtedly know more than you do.” He claimed, and we entered the elevator. The doctor pushed the button for the third floor and we ascended. I followed the doctor to a small examination room with a door bearing his name, and he began his work.  
  
Even if the whole thing really didn't take long, it went far beyond an ordinary health check. Doctor Fernsby took a blood sample, checked my brainwaves, and put me in what looked like a modified MRI machine. After each step, the doctor smiled contentedly and assured me that I was in great shape. Finally, he said there would be a little 'psychological test', before he could send me home. I dragged myself onto the examination table and he sat down in a chair across from me, a clipboard in one hand and pen in the other.  
  
Like the whole examination, this test started out fairly normal, with the doctor asking me general questions about my emotions and mental state, my private life and feelings about the job, but the questions kept getting weirder and more off-topic. "What continent does China belong to?" he asked and I looked at him confused. "What's with that question?" I wanted to know in amazement. "You must answer it, Mister Williams. Every question has a good reason that I can't explain to you. Please, just answer.” Said the doctor, who had probably seen my amazement countless times in new employees. "Um, Asia?" I answered uncertainly and Doctor Fernsby took notes on the clipboard. A few more questions on politics, history, and geography followed, but these questions didn't even come close to matching the weirdness of those that came after.  
  
Doctor Fernsby's questions grew more and more surreal and abstract, until I could no longer see any meaning in them. "What color is the light when three moons have circled the tree?" I put my hand to my head and sank onto the table. As Eric pointed out earlier, I was still overwhelmed by what happened with the door, and Doctor Fernsby's questions threatened to finish me off. "What light? Which tree? What are you talking about, Doc?” I demanded in a weak voice. "Answer it, Mister Williams. Guess, if you have to, but it's important that you answer.” The doctor gave me the what I was expecting. I sighed. "I don't know, no idea, Blue?" Doctor Fernsby nodded again and wrote something down.  
  
I was questioned further like this, one question stranger and more cryptic than the last, and just when my head threatened to explode, the doctor said that the examination was finally over. “I am happy to tell you that their physical and mental health is in the best possible condition. Enjoy your day, Mister Williams, and if anything else happens, let me know.” Doctor Fernsby rummaged in the pocket of his labcoat and finally pulled out a lightly creased business card. There was no logo or anything on it, just writing, "Dr. Fernsby, G-Company”, in simple black letters, followed by a phone number. I thanked him and he took me down to the lobby. There, he wished me well and said goodbye, before turning once more to the receptionist.  
  
I left the building and took one last look at the business card, before slipping it into my pocket and heading home. When I arrived, I immediately sat down at the computer to write this. Something is wrong with this G-Company, but both my curiosity and my still far from ideal life situation prevent me from simply resigning.  
  
If anything else noteworthy happens or if I find out more, I'll keep posting. Until then, I will try my best to find out more without raising suspicion. If you don't hear from me again, don't try to find G-Company. I've tried looking it up wherever I could, and nothing came up. So, you'll hear from me in my next update, hopefully.
