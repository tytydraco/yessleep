Hey guys, sorry this is going to be a very short update. I found out how to defeat this..thing, and this will be the last time I update you guys on it.

Here's the link to [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/182859d/my_family_recently_moved_into_a_new_house/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) if you haven't read it already, just to catch you up to speed.

Once I woke up, i prepared myself, got a bit to eat and got ready to go outside. Its been pitch black outside for days now, and the windows are like ice to the touch. I layered the two sweatshirts I brought, and hoped that would be enough.

I took the hatchet and unlocked the doors, peering outside the glass window for any of those.. Things.

The coast was clear, so I made a break for it. I ran through the winding halls, trying my best to make as little sound as possible. I reached the porch, and slowly stepped outside, into the darkness. I looked out, my breath rising from my mouth like smoke.

I checked my watch, and it was 10am…. It should still be light outside. Yet, here I was, standing on the porch, my cold breath rising in small clouds as I looked out at the pitch black landscape before me.

After a minute or so, I realized that I was just standing there, out in the open. I quickly switched on my flashlight and began making my way to the well. Once I got to the well, I tossed my flashlight inside, watching as the beam of light bounds off the walls.

*One of them was in there, staring at me.*

I held the hatchet up like a baseball bat, prepared to strike.I ran forward, plunging the hatchet into its shoulder. it screamed in agony, stretching its arms out in an attempt to claw at me. I pulled the hatchet out, and swung again, this time hitting it in the side. It collapsed to the floor, writhing in pain as it still tried to cling onto me in a desperate attempt.

It was sickening, I felt like vomiting, but I knew I had to go on.

I went down the well, which now seemed to be more of a tunnel.After about 10 minutes of walking, I reached a door..just like the one in my attic.But this time..i had a key.

I inserted the key, praying that it fit. I heard a click, and slowly pushed the door open. Inside was a book. A really.. Really old book. I walked forward, picking up the book and brushing off the dust. I opened the cover, and began reading. the book reads as follows:

*“If you’re reading this, I'm sorry.. It shouldn't have come to this.*

*I'm writing this in the event that they end up releasing it..*

*I'm one of the locals, and one of the few left who know the history of this land. I'm afraid that those ignorant construction workers are going to set it free, and then…well…may the lord have mercy on us all.*

*Years and years ago, during the war, a curse was placed on this land. It was meant to protect us, in the case that Russian soldiers came. We tried to make our soldiers stronger, and enhance their senses but..it backfired. They…they're not human anymore..I don't know what they are.*

*We locked them underneath the well, putting concrete above it. We thought that would be the last of it, that they would be left to rot in there. But no, those stupid construction workers had to mess things up.*

***They broke the concrete.***

*We haven't heard anything yet, but we locked it up just in case with some chains and a grate. Tonight, I'll be taking the necessary precautions. I'm writing this before I do, so if I fail.. Humanity still has a chance.*

*These things cannot be killed. They don't require food or water.. They just simply exist. There's only one way to get rid of them, to send them back…and it's difficult.*

*To put it simply, you have to allow one of them to..possess you. They’re able to fuse into people, which gives them their shape. Without a human target to fuse to, they’re just a shadow, a whisper in your ear. Their human host is what gives them their power.*

*In order to kill them, you have to become one of them, and then sacrifice yourself. All of these creatures are connected, like a hive mind. Any harm done to the host's body, will be done to them.*

*I'm hoping it doesn't come down to this but.. The concrete has already been broken.*

*I'm going to try and do the ritual tonight but I don't know if I'll be able to fight it off.*

*By allowing it to possess you, you're also allowing it to have control over your body. In order to complete the ritual, you have to fight that.*

*If you're reading this, it means I didn't succeed. It means they are out, lurking for their next target*."

I closed the book, staring at it in shock.

They couldn't be killed? Then…what happened to the one at the entrance of the well… is it.. Still alive?

And that's when I heard it.

I heard the breathing behind me.

The laughing.

I'm writing this as it stares at me, giggling, watching me with that ominous smile plastered on its thin face.

I know what I'm going to do. its the last resort I have and, really, I don't have much of an option.

I just hope my family will be able to live in peace after this.

&#x200B;

I have the hatchet ready. 

I'm going to let it possess me, and then I'm going to kill these things, no matter what it takes.

…Until then,

Jack.
