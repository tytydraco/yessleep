I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. I don’t want to call the police — I feel ridiculous even typing that — and I don’t want to tell my family because I don’t want them worrying or, worse, thinking I’m losing it. So I’ll say it here, plainly: since I moved into my new apartment something has been changing the past, and I can’t stop it.

I’m an engineer. I took a contract in a city I didn’t know and rented an older one-bedroom in a building that was cheap because it had “character.” Character, I learned, translates to original fixtures, a crooked floor that creaks when you walk, and a shallow hallway cabinet with glass panes that faces the stairs. The place was fine — normal little problems — and I didn’t expect anything strange.

When I first hung a tear-off calendar on the kitchen wall, I did it for the obvious reason: to keep track of deadlines and appointments. It was the kind of calendar with thick pages you tear off at the end of the month. It stayed by the sink so I could glance up while I rinsed a mug between meetings. For a few weeks everything was normal. Then I started noticing odd things I couldn’t explain.

At one point I found a page from that calendar in the recycling and assumed I’d thrown it there. Later, a coworker pointed out a photo of the office party where he swore the same calendar page was taped to the break room refrigerator. I remembered tossing that page in the recycling. He swore the photo showed otherwise. I dug through the recycling until my hands were faintly damp and gray; there was nothing.

A short while after that, months seemed to slip sideways. I would hang the new month’s page on the wall, and for a day or two it would be correct. Then I would notice the nail in the wall was holding up the previous month instead. The paper didn’t look new — it had the slight yellowing of something that had been stored in shade — and someone had written in the squares in pencil, but the handwriting was mine: the same slant, the same habit of curling the tails of my letters. When I looked at the handwriting closely it was wrong in a subtle way, like a reflection of my hand writing while I watched, not me actually doing it.

I started finding pieces of paper in places I knew I hadn’t left anything: a scrap tucked into the mattress, another folded and shoved under a stack of bills. Once, a page was taped inside the back of the hallway cabinet, pressed flat against the wood behind the glass. I could see the nail hole where a calendar would normally hang, and directly behind it, taped to the inner panel, was a single calendar page. It shouldn’t have been there. The tape was brittle, the edges browned. Whoever had put it there had to have worked from inside the wall.

On the back of one of the pages, in my handwriting but with letters just slightly off, was a note: “Don’t go.” I didn’t know what it referred to. I kept that page. Later I found the same note on the bathroom mirror propped against the toothpaste cup. I record little things on my phone — shopping lists, quick voice memos — and once I made a short video asking, “Who put this here?” When I played it back there was a second voice under mine, whispering a single word I didn’t recognize.

I set up a cheap motion camera aimed at the cabinet because I wanted a record of whatever was happening. Most nights it recorded nothing but static noise and the habitual creaks of the building. In the early hours of one night there was a single blurred frame where the cabinet door looked slightly ajar and a gray shape passed across the glass. The camera file saved with the same strange naming pattern as some of my photos: an image clearly taken that night but somehow labelled with the sequence number that matched earlier pictures. Every time I tried to make sense of the files I ended up with mismatched timestamps and filenames that didn’t add up.

Once I found a small stack of calendar backs tightly rolled and hidden inside the wall cavity where the plaster had a hollow sound. I pulled the plaster away — I know what the risks of tearing into old walls are, but I couldn’t live with not knowing — and there they were: a neat bundle of pages, yellowed and fragile. Each page’s back bore short notes in pencil, phrases that read like reminders: “left keys on table,” “missed call at 9,” “red mark on sleeve.” Some were things I remembered doing. Some were memories I had no recollection of at all. One line made my skin go cold: “He can move things between months. Don’t let him have that day.”

I should have stopped then. I should have walked out and never looked back. Instead I read every scrap until my vision blurred. The handwriting looked like mine because it was mine — the pressure, the loops — but when I tried to copy the same words my hand wrote them differently, as if the letters here had been shaped by seeing my hand from the other side of a mirror.

There was a day — a single square on the calendar I could never bring myself to fully name — that kept being circled. Sometimes the note next to it said “Don’t go” or “Stay out of the kitchen.” On that day I woke to the sound of something clattering and the faint smell of frying oil. I had a foggy memory of being in the kitchen earlier, but my phone made no record of me cooking. A cold pan sat on the stove with a dried smear in it. The calendar on the wall, predictably, had the previous month tacked over the current one; the square for that day was filled in with a dense pencil black and the words “Stay out” underlined three times. I left the apartment that night and sat in my car under the streetlamp until dawn, with the rolled pages in a zipper pouch on the passenger seat.

After that I stopped sleeping in the bedroom. I started sleeping in the living room with the lights on and every mirror covered. I unplugged clocks and devices and tried to keep anything that recorded time out of reach. It helped for a few nights; then one morning the towels I’d used to cover every reflective surface were on the bedroom floor. The cabinet behind the glass had the calendar pages back where they’d always been, and the pane was fogged from the inside. When I cleared the condensation with my sleeve I found the faint outline of a palm pressed against the glass, from the inside of the cabinet, like someone on the other side had been reaching out.

I began carrying copies of the pages with me everywhere I went. I photographed them, uploaded them to multiple cloud backups, and mailed copies to a friend. The act of making duplicates felt, for a while, like armor. If the person or thing moving these dates had to choose between multiple copies, maybe it could be stopped or at least delayed. Sometimes that reasoning stabilizes me; sometimes it feels like a superstition.

I tried to rationalize everything. Maybe it was a sophisticated prank — someone with access to the building and a taste for psychological cruelty. But the wall cavity where I found the pages was sealed. The only way a prankster could have put pages inside would have been to remove the plaster or to rig something from the inside of the wall. I tried to imagine a neighbor or a friend orchestrating it, but there was no motive I could attach to such weird, obsessive behavior. And if it was just a prank, who would go to the effort of copying my handwriting so precisely that the loops and the pressure matched? And why would the messages sometimes warn me as if they wanted to prevent me from getting hurt?

One night I tore more of the hallway wall away, not because I had a plan but because panic has a way of making you do things you wouldn’t normally. Behind the plaster I found, in addition to paper, a small gap that looked into a dark, narrow void. It didn’t look like the inside of a conventional wall. It looked like a corridor of shadow that was not part of the building, a place that should not be there. When I pressed my fingers into the gap I felt the slight give of something that was not wood or plaster — it felt like space itself had a seam.

After that the occurrences became more direct. Notes in my handwriting appeared inside books I had not opened in weeks. My watch would record an alarm I definitely had not set. Photographs of the cabinet would show the interior as if someone had photographed it from inside the wall looking out. Once, I received a plain envelope left on my kitchen table containing a single printed photograph — not a digital file, an actual chemical print — of the cabinet door swung open and whatever lay behind it. On the back, in familiar handwriting but written on a different slant, were only two words: “Bring March.”

It’s the ambiguity that eats me. These pages are clearly ordinary, fragile things, but they are being rearranged in a way that suggests intention. Sometimes they urge me to do things that seem like safety measures. Other times they are directives I don’t understand. I found one page that said, simply: “Stop reflecting.” Another said, “Find the pages in the wall.” The handwriting would flip subtly — sometimes mirror-imaged, sometimes not — as though two hands, identical but reversed, were writing from different sides of the same glass.

I have tried to trap it. I left multiple copies of a page pinned in different places and monitored them with cameras. In the morning, some were untouched while others had been moved. Only the copies that had been photographed and backed up remained untouched. The originals, wherever they were, tended to be the ones altered. That gave me the small, bitter consolation that making duplicates helped, but it did not stop the pattern. It only meant I had more things to worry about.

I should emphasize: I am not experiencing grand visions. There are no roaring voices or dramatic apparitions. It is small, granular things that change: a folded corner where there was none before, a coffee stain that looks like it should be drying but isn’t, a filename on my phone that doesn’t match the date the photo claims to show. The effect is cumulative. It’s the way your life becomes a collage of half-remembered and newly-inserted moments you can’t line up on a timeline.

People will assume I’m telling a ghost story with metaphorical language. That would be the comfortable read. It would make for a cleaner ending. But I know what I know: my own handwriting shows up in places I did not put it; paper appears in sealed cavities; photographs show me things from perspectives I cannot physically reach. And whatever this thing is, it has learned the edges of my life — the thin things that record days: paper, glass, camera files — and it moves around them like a child shuffling cards.

I don’t know what I want from posting this. Maybe I want someone to tell me I’m being paranoid. Maybe I want instructions on how to board up a wall properly or how to destroy fragile paper without accidentally sending whatever reads them to something else. Maybe I want someone who has experienced something similar to say, “Me too,” so I’m not the only person whose history rearranges itself.

I will say one practical thing: if you find a calendar page taped somewhere it shouldn’t be — inside a cupboard, between two boards, under a mattress — don’t throw it away without documenting it. Photograph it, back it up to more than one place, and, if you can, make a copy. Keep the copy separate. For a while, having more than one copy seemed to slow whatever it is down, or at least forced it to pick a single version. That little, irrational step kept me going longer than anything else.

I moved out of the apartment. I left the keys with the landlord and told a half-truth about a family emergency. I took the copies I had and I mailed some to friends. I changed my route to work and started sleeping with a light on. It reduced the number of small occurrences, but didn’t stop them entirely. The last thing I will tell you is this: one morning, long after I thought I had put the worst of it behind me, I found an ordinary piece of mail on my doormat — a plain envelope with no return address. Inside was a single print of a calendar page. The square that had always been circled now had, in the margin, the words: “You left it.”

If this is a person, if this is a pattern, and if you ever see a date that feels like it was written for you, treat it as real. Don’t assume someone else will see it. Don’t assume your memory will correct itself. Back things up. Make copies. Don’t reflect. Don’t be alone with mirrors. And if you ever find a calendar page taped to the inside of a cabinet or trapped behind plaster, don’t throw it out. Hold on to it until you are sure you want to let it go.

I don’t know what keeps me writing this other than the conviction that someone else should know. If this ends up being nonsense to you, tell me so. If it sounds like something you’ve seen, tell me how you stopped it. If I disappear from this account, assume I didn’t get away. If I keep posting, maybe that will help — maybe telling the story makes the thing reluctant to change the past when it’s already been told aloud.
