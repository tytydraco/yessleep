So, my wife and I had a miscarriage in the beginning of 2025. It impacted us both, but I took it worse. In the beginning it was just typical grief, depression, and lots of tears.

A few months later, my dreams would be haunted by her. A grown version, with my height and my wife’s traits, nose and bearing. I enjoyed them at first, seeing her and being a proud father.  I never really understood how this could happen. Lucid dreams it seems.

What would generally happen was we would be at the edge of a forest. I would be an old man, and she’d appear over the edge of a hill. Beautiful as ever. We’d walk through the trees and sit on a bench near a lake. She’d hold my hand, and those were blissful memories. The weight I’ve carried slipped away.

This night was different. Same thing as usual, but instead of the bright sky and autumn leaves, the sky was grey and thunder cracked. It began to rain shortly afterward. I stood, dumbly, looking for her. Shivering and drenched but determined. Maybe this was just a fluke? Maybe a nightmare. My beloved girl was there somewhere. I had to find her.

Trudging through mud up to my ankles, slipping and falling, I heard rustling. I had made it about a mile, and there was no sign of her. I fell again, slipping in and out of consciousness. The rustling grew louder, and she peers over me. Those piercing eyes, as ever. Now tinged with malice and bloodshot. I flail, and she grabs my ankles and drags. You have to understand, I am a large man. Even diminished and older. It should not have been possible. She picks up the pace, twigs and debris cutting into me. We reach the lake again but this time it not cool blue, but tinged with black. I get thrown in, and plead for her to stop. She pushes my head under the water - “your fault. You killed me” and I try to rise, to get one breath. Titanic strength prevents me. “Die now dad” I take one gulp of air, and gulps of filthy water. My visions to black, and I hear mumbling. I wake up and it is myself, tears in my eyes.

Don’t ever trust your dreams, even if they seem nice, at first. Since that time I shake and sweat, afraid to sleep. I stopped going to work. Stopped eating. I would drink constantly, gallons of vodka. Experimenting with other drugs. Nothing could wash away that face, as I drowned. My wife grew cold, and I couldn’t blame her. I aged more quickly, growing gaunt.

I am cursed now. Some entity posed as my daughter all along. She was nothing but a fetus when she died, couldn’t take her first breath. I could have saved her, maybe. But it wasn’t either my wife or I’s fault. Or maybe, it was. I no longer try to sleep. I sit here with another bottle, a coffee, and regrets.

What awaits me when I sleep is not my daughter.
