Please, for the sake of you and everyone you care for, do as the title says. I wish I could say I understood why. I wish I could give you more advice, tell you that this can be fixed, that this will be over soon. All I know is that one rule has kept me and others alive: avoid the light.

I’m hoping this message reaches someone out there, but I fear that this has gone beyond my little hometown. Beyond Dover. The thought of being among the last ones left is too much to bear, too much of a weight. Far too depressing.

But in case this is somehow only a phenomenon my hometown is facing, firstly, a big middle finger to whatever god or devil chose us in particular. Seriously, fuck you. Second, I wanted to tell everyone out there what happened here. I don’t want to be forgotten. I don’t want all of these people to be forgotten and left behind. Someone has to remember what happened to Dover.

Where do I even start?

Dover is… well, it’s always been a place that has just enough. A Mexican restaurant, a donut shop, and at least four churches along the main road. With fewer than two-thousand people, it’s the textbook small town tucked between the mountains and the nearby river. I’ve never liked Dover, per say. My parents moved us here from St. Pierre when housing costs went up in the “big city.” I was about eleven then, and my whole world was rocked. Even being a mere two-hour drive away meant my social circle slowly vanished. My parents couldn’t afford to ferry me back and forth to St. Pierre for playdates, and they were too proud to allow my friends’ parents to drive me either. And nobody wanted to come to Dover just to see me. I didn’t grow up with a phone either, so I fell out of touch with all the kids I had come to know. I had to settle with the mountain hick kids of Dover.

I’ve had a few friends over the years, don’t get me wrong, but I really got comfortable being on my own after living in Dover. This only became more chronic after I saved up enough couch change, Christmas money, and whatever I could make mowing lawns and shoveling driveways to pay for half of a PlayStation II. I was hooked, losing weeks of sleep playing Spider-Man, Midnight Club: Street Racing, and of course, SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom. A true classic. This continued well into my teens, my late-night gaming obsession eventually being funded by my part-time job at the Stoplite gas station.

Now, I know this is about what happened in Dover and not an autobiography, but what I’m trying to highlight here is my habits inadvertently made me lucky enough to make it this long with my mind intact. It also bears mentioning that having a west-facing window blacked out with blankets was the difference between life and… something else.

So, that night. It was the Summer of 2005 during a record heat wave. Sometimes, I would meet up with other neighborhood kids to play basketball in the cul-de-sac, but the days had been so unbearably hot that I opted to stay inside as much as possible where it was relatively cool. With my air conditioner on full blast behind me (my parents were gone at the time, otherwise they would have freaked out about the power bills), I was booting up my latest purchase: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It had come out the year before and I was eagerly saving up to finally play it. After sitting through a lengthy intro cutscene, I spent hours skulking around the jungle as Snake (and watching a lot more cutscenes).

I only realized how long I had been playing when I blinked, feeling my dried-out eyes, stood up only to realize I had a diabolical case of “swamp ass,” and felt my stomach making desperate pleas for sustenance. I relented and warmed up some Mexican leftovers and took a long shower. I checked the time on the microwave clock and realized it was 5:42am, almost sunrise. Realizing my parents must have been back home and asleep, I quietly opened the microwave door just before it beeped and slow walked back to my room. I shut off my air conditioner and prayed my parents didn’t find out I had stayed up all night again. Even though school was out and the Stoplite was closed for the week, my mom hated when I got off my sleep schedule.

After eating the remnants of my enchiladas, fatigue finally caught up with me and I lied down in my bed. I set my alarm clock for noon, hoping to keep a somewhat human sleep rhythm, and closed my eyes. It couldn’t have been more than five minutes before my rest was interrupted by the sound of someone vocalizing outside. It was a low, guttural sound, like what you hear kids in the school choir do for vocal exercises. Only, this kid was stuck on the first “Doh” note. I closed my eyes again and tried to sleep through it, but it never stopped. One long, sustained note that impossibly went on for almost ten minutes. There was no way anyone could hold that much air in their lungs.

I got up and peeked out of my window to find the culprit. I could just make out one of the younger neighborhood kids kneeling down in the cul-de-sac. His half-lidded eyes were fixed straight ahead of him, a blank stare into the distance. His jaw was dropped, his mouth open in an ‘O,’ that low note constantly emanating from it. He had his arms down at his sides, his palms open and facing forward. He just sat there, lazily slouched, a dumb look and a steady low note. It was definitely the most bizarre thing I had seen a Dover kid do, but the bar wasn’t very high. I backed away from the window, replacing the bedsheet blinds, and returned to bed, confused and somewhat unsettled. I did eventually manage to sleep, but my dreaming was uneasy. I probably dreamed about that kid. I know I dreamed about the sunrise. It wasn’t until quite a bit later that I realized he was facing east.

I woke up with a start at around noon. I say around because my alarm clock hadn’t gone off. When my bleary eyes were clear again, my clock only read 11:56am. When my groggy mind caught up to my senses, I realized what had woken me up. Just like the previous night (or earlier that morning, if you want to be a stickler), I heard the sound of a single, sustained note, only it was several octaves higher. That and it actually sounded like a choir. There were more voices.

I got up and went straight to my window, taking a careful peek outside. I saw that kid again, but he wasn’t alone. Scattered around the cul-de-sac, I saw several of my neighbors kneeling down on the pavement, on the sidewalk, in the grass. All of them staring straight up into the sky, into the sun. Their arms outstretched, their palms open, fingers spread. Their eyes were wide open and their mouths too, only now they smiled. And they all sang a single, piercing note.

Then, all at once, they fell silent. Their postures didn’t change, they didn’t move, they just fell silent. I held my breath by instinct, and I was frozen in place. My alarm clock blared, the harsh klaxon causing me to jump, banging my head against the wall, my body twisting awkwardly as I turned to look at it. Then the laughter started. Loud, shrill laughter from everyone outside. Turning back, in my haze of fear and adrenaline, I could see their arms reaching out to the sky as they laughed and laughed. It wasn’t polite laughter either. These were deep, belly laughs, as if the clouds had told the quintessential joke to end all comedy. Even when I covered my ears, the bass of their laughter rumbled lowly through my bones. I don’t remember if I had screamed then, or cried, or both. If I had, not even I could hear it. Only the laughter at noon.
