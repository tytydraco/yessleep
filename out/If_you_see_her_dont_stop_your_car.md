We hadn’t been on the backroad that long before she appeared in the road.

Her skin was alabaster, with bumps covering her breasts and shoulders.

The mere sight of her in the rain caused me to slam on the brakes and fishtail the trailer hitched to my truck slightly.

My daughter let out a piercing scream that I tried to subdue by shouting every curse at the top of my lungs, hoping one of them would stop the panic in her voice.

The woman’s eyes never left mine and she never flinched — almost yearning to become the next roadkill on this long stretch of backroad.

Florida. Fucking Florida.

This godforsaken real-life version of Jurassic Park meets Wrong Turn. I hated the whole goddamn state exactly for this very reason.

Every road, every mile had some other lunatic trying to panhandle or hitch a ride.

But this was different.

This made me find the key on my ring to unlock the small handgun safe underneath my seat.

Not quick enough.

The passenger window shattered, with hands fumbling for the lock to open the door.

Despite getting a few good hits in with my right fist, I was still buckled in during all the commotion.

The darkness pulled her faster than I could think, and before I knew it, she was gone — my 13-year-old swallowed by a terrestrial black hole infested with malaria and pythons.

The woman with scales must have followed as well.

My dad was a sailor in the Vietnam War.

If there is one lesson he instilled in me, it’s that a .45 ACP will put a big enough hole in any creature’s ass that it won’t mess with you again.

The very reason a 1911 was under my seat.

I unlocked it, grabbed the car keys, and a flashlight I kept in the glovebox.

Left the high beams on so I could hopefully find my way out and went into the trees.

The police are not going to fix this by showing up 2 hours too late.

Fuck it.

I either save her, or I die trying.

 

Ten steps in and water was at my knees — more swamp than forest — but no going back.

It didn’t take long to find the trail they must have used.

Despite being muddy as all hell, it was surprisingly neat.

Logs lined the edge, with an occasional large flat stone offering support through the mud.

What felt like hours of running ended up being mere minutes, and that’s when the screams started.

They started off distant but quickly grew closer as I trudged along the winding path.

Eventually a steady glow of oil lanterns hanging from trees gave me a faint glow — enough to see in front of me.

I turned the flashlight off and briskly kept going.

What I saw next was not incomprehensible, as Lovecraft would say, but more unsettling and obscure.

A pyramid rose from a large body of stagnant water, complete with hieroglyphics.

But instead of looking ancient, these looked more like a child drew them in kindergarten.

The structure was rough — with a base made up of what I could only assume was four rotted shipping containers.

The rest was built up with cinder block and railroad ties.

Whoever made this was inspired by ancient Egypt but ultimately made a shitty version of Aztec design.

It was a childlike creation, yet it yielded an aura of desecration.

As I stood there in amazement and horror, an acrid smell pulled me away towards the path once more. The rain began to lighten but did not change my already soaked clothes clinging to my body.

As I walked around the bend of the serpentine path, a small shed could be seen in the distance.

The light of a roaring bonfire lit up the entire area, with numerous beings dancing around it like ethereal creatures.

The glow revealed they were all women — and all clearly naked.

Normally, I would have been excited to see something of this nature, but my mind was pulsating with rage and it was no time to focus on carnal fantasies.

Who the fuck were these people, and why did they take my daughter?

I broke from the path and walked around the perimeter, slowly.

What was the old saying? Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

My shoes melted into the mud, creating moments of feeling like being glued to terra herself.

I pressed on, watching every step, avoiding the numerous branches laying on this spoiled ground.

The light of the fire glinted off a dull green surface gently facing me.

Upon closer inspection it said:

“FRONT TOWARD ENEMY.”

The wire traveled along my left side.

What in the fucking hell is a claymore mine doing here?! I harshly said under my breath.

Was I going to trip it? Was I on some pressure switch? Was there more?!

I never enlisted with any military branch, but had a rough idea what these could do to human anatomy.

I gently lifted my feet and took a deep breath.

Nothing.

It must just be the wires. Keep looking for them, I thought.

By the time I reached the shed, I found no more claymores, but two more sets of wires leading to something I could not identify.

Regardless, the goal was don’t touch them.

As I crept up behind the shed, I noticed it was just rusty sheet metal.

The bottom left corner revealed some light bleeding through where the two sheets seemed to have rusted away over time.

I slowly hunched down, soaking my pants and shirt in the thick mud.

Inside I could see my daughter — she was tied up on the floor.

Her eyes were red from crying, but she looked up for just a moment and could see the small hole I was peering into.

She gasped, and I just put my finger over my mouth in a quiet motion.

She slowly nodded her head.

Moving my eyes from her to the inside of the shed, candles sat on the table above my daughter, where it illuminated the strangeness of this place.

I could see pictures of crocodiles, alligators, and caiman plastered onto the walls.

The heads of numerous gators hung from the ceiling, along with what I could only imagine was herbs and other vegetation.

I looked back at my daughter and motioned to her that I was getting up.

Her eyes pleaded with me to hurry, but I knew this was not going to be the easiest thing in the world to do.

I moved towards the right side, which housed an old oil drum filled with what smelled like kerosene.

I cocked the hammer of the .45 and was about to stand up and shoot when one of the women spoke.

It was the one from the road.

Closer and steadier now, I could see her entire body was essentially scarified like that of some uncontacted tribe.

She spoke about the old ones and the gods of ancient times.

Not Cthulhu necessarily — but Horus, Bastet, and Anubis.

Then, in a different tone, she spoke of Sobek — the crocodile god that was revered for strength, fertility, and chaos.

When she spoke of Sobek, the women fell to their knees and convulsed in ritualistic movements.

Their speech fused into one mass incoherent roar of prayers and cries, with the only definable words being Father & Sobek.

The scarred woman spoke again, this time asking each woman to approach her.

One by one, they all stepped in front of her and received a small cut into their flesh.

She said the same thing to each one:

“Tonight, we give our father another bride and we carry the memory of each bride on our bodies.”

Each woman followed with:

“Amen.”

This was getting old fast.

I get being intrigued — but this was fucking nuts.

The more I thought, the more I needed them to turn away so I could make my move.

I had enough bullets for who I could see, but I had no idea if there were more of them hidden away.

I needed to play this as smart as I could.

The scarred woman screamed suddenly, and the others moved to the left and right of her.

As they flanked her, she walked with them towards the bank of the swamp, which was roughly twenty feet away from the shed.

I slowly crept around the drum and into the shed, pulling out my pocketknife.

Putting the pistol in the back of my jeans, I kept my eyes on them and opened the blade.

Carefully I cut the nylon rope from my daughter’s legs and hands.

She made no noise, and we kept our eyes on them.

Just for added security I snuffed the candle flames, so we could move in the darkness.

Once she was freed, I helped her up and moved her towards the front of the shed.

She followed me in the same pattern I just had coming here, all the while keeping our eyes on the congregation at the edge of the water.

As we got behind the drum, we heard splashing in the water — like a large boat was approaching.

I didn’t think much of it as we slowly moved our way back to the trail, avoiding the tripwires.

Then my daughter tugged on my shirt.

As I looked at her face, it showed revulsion and horror.

Her eyes were wide and staring at the bank of the water.

I looked over and saw it — about thirteen feet long, with a mouth open full of conical teeth.

The numerous women were holding onto it and speaking in prayers of some language that eluded me.

The crocodile lashed out, snapping at one of the women.

She attempted to coo it back into submission like an infant having a tantrum.

Then, the scarred woman began to walk towards the shed in an almost graceful manner.

Fuck!

I pulled my daughter’s hand and led her away as fast as possible.

As we attempted to run through the mud of the long trail, I could hear screams of fury come from behind me.

We ran past the last of the oil lanterns and back into the darkness.

I turned back for only a moment and flashed the light of my torch back on.

Two came charging at me with what looked like machetes.

In a frenzy, I pointed the 1911 and fired — hitting one in the shoulder and the other in the right side of her face.

The sound deafened my hearing briefly.

The surviving one wildly flailed the blade in every direction, while charging at me again.

This time I aimed better and hit her center mass.

She slumped to the ground in an anticlimactic way.

Again, we ran — branches scratching our faces, mosquitoes now biting every inch of bare flesh, and epinephrine dumping into our bloodstream.

I could see the high beams of the truck through the brush.

Almost there!

Thirty more feet and we broke through the brush line and rushed into the truck.

Glass covered the passenger seat, but neither of us gave a shit.

I floored the gas pedal as hard as possible and gained some momentum.

Out of the darkness came one of the women, and she attempted to stand in front of the truck thinking I would stop.

I did not.

The brush guard hit her hard — the wet slap of her body against the metal was audible, leaving us both grimacing.

The truck didn’t notice.

It just kept pushing forward.

Thirty minutes had passed since our escape and we reached a rather large gas station, with an attached diner.

We pulled over and sat there in what I can only assume was shock.

I looked over and asked:

“Are you alright? What did they do and say to you?”

Endless thoughts ran through my head, but finally she said:

“They didn’t do anything. Just tied me up and left me.”

I sat there in silent contemplation for a moment, trying to understand what had just happened.

Then she spoke again:

“The one with all the scars did whisper to me……welcome to the family.”
