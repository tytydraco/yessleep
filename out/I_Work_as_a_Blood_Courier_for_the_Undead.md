That’s what they like to call it. I think it’s meant to sound better than ‘Delivery Boy for bloodthirsty vampires’. 26 years after the fall of the human race and yet even the undead use the same corporate lingo. I work for a company specializing in “at-home sustenance packs”. This allows nearly every vamp to feed in the absence of their main food source. Following nearly 90% of all human lives being extinguished, the vamps moved extremely fast in creating a stable and reliable food source. 

Pair that, with the pretty genius move of turning the more needed humans (biologists, engineers, doctors) and voila. Six months later you get the “Bottomless Blood Oasis™”. Feeding each of the world’s big cities, more oases began to be produced. This was in an effort to move away from live feeding entirely. Eventually the outlawing of live feeding became a reality 2 years later.

Protected humans like myself are far and few between but necessary for the undead. See, they could produce the blood but distribution was trickier. Fighting, stealing, black market selling, vamps quickly realized that it wasn’t sustainable to employ their peers for this job. Eventually, the new government was left with no choice but to offer an ultimatum. Any remaining humans not already protected, would receive protection in exchange for becoming drivers, couriers, and other distribution related jobs. 

I was just 10 when my dad took the offer as a courier, allowing my mom and I the same protective privileges. We received housing, akin to a shoddy New York apartment but housing nonetheless. We received rations of food but were still able to cook with ingredients found in other places. We were always given looks or had our fair share of run-ins with vamps unwilling to obey the protective order. They were handled by the militia pretty quickly, but not always fast enough. The years passed and the protective order became part of everyday life. Sure there are still casualties, it’s unavoidable but nowadays humans are more seen like cats or dogs. Pets who provide some purpose, at least I think we do.

Being a courier still isn’t 100% safe obviously. Every other week you hear about some poor soul who was stupid enough to enter a vamp’s place, only to find their mutilated remains in the local dumpster. My father taught me his rules for delivering and made sure I never forgot them. 

“First and foremost son, **ONE:** NEVER under any circumstances go into a house, apartment, anywhere they live. You may hear cries for help, see some unfortunate person lying there, or the recipient may ask for your hand bringing it in for them. Don’t do it. If you want to end up being used for god knows what, then be my guest. **TWO**: NEVER hand a package to them directly. Place it on the floor and wait for them to pick it up. The real desperate ones will be okay with just getting your hand off, don’t give them that chance. **THREE**: ALWAYS wear your issued sunglasses, if you forget them DO NOT look them directly in the eye. The feral ones will have your jugular in their mouth on their couch before you even realize you made direct eye contact.”

That was then. Now I’m the head of my courier team and ‘workplace safety’. Mom and Dad passed a few years ago within a few months of each other. The burial service was humans only which was nice, to feel some normalcy again. It only resulted in about 10 people showing up though. 8 of them were coworkers with my dad. 

Most days now, I spend doing deliveries and saving up to maybe get out of this one day. Lately we’ve been having to be more aware as attacks by those who can afford their monthly supply, get desperate. Today when I got my daily route, I already recognized the face on my supervisor before I entered his office.

“Bad Route today?”

“Just be careful around stop 3. ‘Member that poor fellow from last week? He had that same spot. Got out to deliver.”

My supervisor took a breath.

“Before he even made it to the door, he has his chest turned to mush and throat cut to the bone.”

“Jesus. It’s still getting worse then.”

“Yeah. It is. Those pale fucks are running the world to shit quicker than we did.”

We both looked down, a solemn moment took place while we remembered the world we had.

“Anyways, I know I don’t need to tell you how to be safe but thought I’d give you a heads up.”

“I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks.”

I walked out of his office, it was obvious by the looks I got that everyone knew I pulled the short stick. They cared enough to give me a slight smile here and there. Joey, a longtime friend of mine, was the first to actually approach me. 

We began walking to the fulfillment area.

“Bad run of luck man, I’m sure you’ll be fine though. They don’t seem to linger around the same spots long. Especially after killing one of us.”

“Yeah, I’m more worried about the rookies. We’re losing more.”

“Poor bastards. New World Order is more of the same.”

We reached the rows of bags, each with an assigned last name, some filled with the packages waiting to be delivered. I found mine in the same spot it’s been for years.

I began to unload it, checking out what addresses I had, planning the fastest routes and avoiding the most dangerous ones. I sighed as I saw stop 3’s address but kept planning.

I remembered something looking at the addresses.

“Hey did you ever hear back from that one courier out west?”

Joey furrowed his brow but then quickly his eyes lit up as he remembered too.

“Oh yeah!”

Joey quickly sat down next to me and lowered his voice.

“So this guy works in one of the branches out west and goes for his normal route right? He’s delivering and starts to notice the area he’s in is like really high class. 3 to 4 story mansions type stuff. Not like normal rich but the elder ones rich.”

I raised my eyebrows and listened even more intently.

“So he arrives at the house and is waiting for the homeowner to answer. Finally after like 5 minutes of waiting, who answers the door except for the goddamn governor of the state.”

“Bullshit!”

“No no! Listen so apparently the distribution branch thought the courier they assigned was one cleared for high profile deliveries. And the governor also thinks this, so he lets the courier in on something only meant for the higher-ups. He tells him “Soon enough you’ll be in a house all to yourself too.” They’re planning on giving all couriers in that distribution district real houses! No more cheap, shitty apartments!”

“That actually sounds like they kinda respect our kind over there somewhat.”

“Might have to move my family out there if what he said is true! The kids getting their own backyard is a dream.”

It was nice to have a shred of hope for a better life if even, just temporarily. What would be the point for me though? I don’t have any kids or a partner to share it with. Still can’t say I wouldn’t prefer a queen-sized bed over a cot.

“Well-”

Joey stood up.

“I got a delivery over on Woodworth, so, if you don’t see me again”

Joey gave a sarcastic salute with an overly serious face.

“I’d be so lucky!”

I said to him while Joey continued walking, leaving only with his middle finger raised.

I proceeded with packing my order bag and made sure to pack extra protection. Vamps weaknesses aren’t too dissimilar to what we’ve been taught in pop culture. Crucifixes, holy water, silver, all help against the undead. But their effectiveness has been greatly exaggerated. At most, silver and holy water will buy you a few minutes to run. Crucifixes can get you out of a bad spot as long as your eyes don’t leave your target. It requires 100% concentration and intention to even begin to work.

These are our only means of protection. Which means awareness is the biggest job requirement. Today I had 4 deliveries.



**STOP 1**

My first delivery was in the upper suburbs. 4 bedroom house, family of 5. 3 boxes of sustenance packs. The hedges were trimmed to with clinical precision. They were too perfect. 

Everything about the house was.

The length of the grass, the walkway to the door, the kid’s toys that scattered the lawn. Even the stepping stones were all the same color and shape. The only thing disrupting the artificial perfection were the crickets, which still didn’t sound right. I grabbed the 3 boxes and brought them to the front door. I placed the boxes on the doorstep and rang the doorbell. The doormat read “Family.” The door opened, illuminating the shipment and myself. 

“Why hello…”

A tall one stood around 7’ in the doorway. He had to crouch slightly to see me. He had a smile but the same feeling of perfection oozed through his teeth. His voice sounded like someone trying to squeeze the last of their words out without any breath left. The clothes he wore didn’t make sense either. He wore a black, round hat like a farmer’s. His shirt was a dark green long sleeve. He wore tattered, white slacks and finished it off with combat boots. The look of confusion I had must’ve been noticeable as his voice broke the silence.

“Don’t I need to scan?”

I quickly snapped out of my confusion.

“Right. Yes. Just need you to check the order to make sure it’s correct.”

“Ah yes. We wouldn’t want any mistakes now.”

His inflection sounded rehearsed but not perfected. He opened the box with a gentleness, making sure to pull the tape neatly off and replace it exactly the same. Once checked, he stood back up, once again towering over me, still smiling.

“Looks beautiful.”

I cracked a half-grin.

“Okay. I just need to scan your ABI card and I’ll be off.”

“No problem.”

He reached into his back pocket, still not breaking eye contact. He opened his wallet and without looking down.

“Oh, it seems I misplaced my card.”

Despite the obvious I simply replied,

“I’d need an ABI card before I can officially deliver these sir.”

His smile wavered slightly.

“Let me go grab it, one moment.”

He glided back into his house, leaving the door open. I stood in the doorway making notes of the interior decor.

A mirror, not needed but another attempt at blending in. A rather modern kitchen, but extremely white like a dentist’s office. No furniture, but a TV.

A few minutes passed and I grew impatient by the clear attempt to lure me in.

“Find it yet?”

I raised my voice slightly to be heard through the house. 

No response.

The stillness of the atmosphere, especially for a family of 5, didn’t match.

“You can come in and take a seat. My apologies as I still can’t seem to find it!”

He called out from somewhere in the house. I rolled my eyes and just as I was about to respond, I noticed something. A slight discoloration on the ceiling, just behind the top of the doorway. I squinted and realized it was a toe. I quickly took a far step from the doorway.

I yelled back.

“I have other deliveries I need to get to. If you find your ABI card you can give us a call and we’ll come back tomorrow!”

Just as I squatted down to grab the boxes, his tattered slacks appeared in the doorway. He towered over me again. His smile was still plastered on.

“Found it.”

I stared at him as I scanned his card, finishing the delivery. 

“Thank you, have a good night sir.”

I said.

“You too as well, sir?”

He continued to smile, almost looking for approval that he used the right word. I walked back to my car keeping my eyes on the doorway. He stood there waving even as I sat in my car and pulled up the next address. I began to drive off and noticed 4 other figures now waving as I drove off.



**STOP 2**

Nothing out of the ordinary. Apartment unit. Customer received package and thanked me. I got back in my car and saw my next stop.

“Fuck”



**STOP 3**

Single bedroom apartment, single resident, 1 box of sustenance packs. Richards Square has always been rough. I remember my dad telling me stories about the residents there. It’s gotten significantly worse over the years as more vamps choose to pretend it’s not there. Starving, impoverished vamps are among the most dangerous. Yet, I still feel bad when I see one dying, starved on the side of the street. Too weak to attack, abandoned. Pulling up to delivery 3, the building looked like a failed demolition. The distant moans of the dying, littered the trash-ridden streets. I approached the front door and buzzed the customer’s apartment. A voice cutover the ancient speakerbox.

“What.”

“Sustenance Pack delivery for Mr Callahan?”

The voice over the intercom grunted.

“Ok. Close the front door behind you.”

The front door unlocked with a thudding steel bolt. I entered.

The inside of the building wasn’t much better. Mold covered the walls, and cracks in the foundation made it feel like an abandoned mine shaft. Surprisingly the elevator worked, complete with the dank, mildew smell. I clicked the partially broken button for floor 6. The elevator strained to even close its doors. Arriving on floor 6, I was hit by a stench that immediately caused my eyes to water and my lunch to come up. It smelled of dumpster water, feces, ammonia, and decay. The added BO smell festered underneath the carpets, blending with the other stenches for an ungodly combination. I had to use my jacket to cover my nose but even then it was difficult to move forward. Stepping onto the tattered, carpeted hallway immediately resulted in a horrid squishing sound. I didn’t care or want to know what liquid soaked the carpet that I just stepped in. Through my watery vision, I looked for the apartment. I began to sweat and realized that the A/C was off as well. I had been so disoriented by the stench that I hadn’t even noticed. I knocked on Mr Callahan’s door and waited for the door to open. I set the box down and stepped back. The door cracked open with only a sliver of an eye visible.

“Hi sir, just need you to check the order and scan your ABI card and be on my way.”

The man grunted and stuck out his ABI card. His hand was thin and covered in sores. The skin was stretched like a canvas painting over the sullen bones that were also visible.

“Oh you didn’t want to check it first?”

“Do I need to? I just want to get this over with.

I wasn’t used to vamps accepting things at face value. Especially their food orders.

But I obliged his request and made a note that the resident waived checking their order. I scanned his card, completing the delivery.

“Alright, have a good one sir!”

“Just get out quick, this place isn’t good for your kind.”

Compassion from vamps has always been a rarity. It was odd but somewhat comforting that at least some vamps see us as more than mules. I nodded and made my way back to the elevator. Right before calling the elevator, I looked back at the apartment. The box still sat in front of the door, before that same painfully skinny hand slowly dragged it into darkness. I gave a slight smile to myself as I internally wished the tenant good luck. I was happy I was almost done with the day.. The elevator groaned as it once again opened. I stepped in and the elevator closed, it began its descent. Floor 5, floor 4, floor 3. I was only 2 floors away from getting to my last delivery and then home I entered and waited to finally get out of there.  After being in this place, I was in desperate need of a shower. But then, the elevator stopped. The doors opened on floor 3. I waited hoping it was just the elevator struggling to remember where it’s supposed to actually stop. A man came rushing into the elevator, half-naked and erratic. He was missing parts of skin from his stomach and legs. The blood had already dried with infection beginning to take hold on the wounds. His eyes were bloodshot, with deep circles under his eyes. He was profusely sweating leading to his skin glistening even under the barely lit elevator.. He was human. He looked at me and frantically said -

“Hey! Hey! You’re not one of them! You have to help me please! Human to human! Please!” 

I could only muster out a soft- 

“I can’t”

He didn’t take it well. He frowned and immediately pushed the 1st floor button repeatedly, hoping it would speed up the process. I knew what was coming. In an instant, a decaying, gaunt figure stood before the stubborn elevator doors. The man screamed as he was pulled from the cart with frightening quickness. The vamp held the man’s neck and faced me. Most of his teeth were rotted or missing. Even his most important canines looked hollow and brittle. Sores on the vamp’s body had begun to rot, leading to maggots making their homes inside them. Dried blood from previous victims, including the man before me, caked his mouth and chest. The caked blood had been there for god knows how long and began to crack on his skin. He pulled the man’s head to the side and bit down. Blood immediately gushed as his teeth punctured the jugular. His teeth were strong enough to fully puncture though, leading him to bite again whilst tearing out a large chunk of the man’s neck. I couldn’t look away even while the elevator doors finally closed. 

Was I a bad person? Could I have helped him even if I wanted to?  All I could do was buy him a few seconds which would lead to my firing or death. He wouldn’t have even made it to the front door either way. There’s gotta be more than this. Or maybe there isn’t, maybe I’m just lucky enough to somehow be alive in a place worse than before.

I left the building and got back in my car. I entered my last address and drove off.

**STOP 4**

Customer was not home. Knocked and rang doorbell 3 times with no response. Taking package back to dispatch.

**End of Shift**

We all know the risks going into this. Some of us have no choice while others would rather do this than be on their own. The end of a shift is always somber. It’s when we see who’s come back and who didn't. On the days everyone comes back, the mood is vibrant throughout the building. But those days haven’t been happening much lately. I don’t know how often I’ll update this but if I don’t maybe it’s just better to think I made it out west. Until then, it's best to follow my dad’s rules passed down to me, and that I’ve passed down to you. Good luck. And stay safe out there.
