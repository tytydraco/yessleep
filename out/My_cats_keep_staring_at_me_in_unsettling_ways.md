Hey everyone. Names George. Ever since I was a little boy, I have wanted a pet cat. My parents however are allergic so I was never able to get one. Now that I’m going off to college. I have been given the opportunity to finally have one!

I have already gotten myself a place to myself that allows pets. And after setting up the small apartment with my things. I get ready to head off and get myself a cat!

I get to the place that I have forgotten the name of. I think it was a local shelter. But anyway I enter the building and give them the information about who I am and everything and that I want a cat.

After getting information settled. We head back and I start looking for a cat. In the corner of the small room full of cats. Most of the cats are separated. And thats when I found them. In the corner of the room, behind a glass wall. There’s two cats. The woman showing me the cats says.

“Here we have Callie and Sadie. They are inseparable and it appears they have an interest in you.”

“This is good, yes?”

“Oh yes! It’s good to have them interested. Now if you want one of them you will need to get them both. We tried separating them and well, I’m not allowed to tell you what happened.”

“Um ok, thanks for the information. I guess, I will take them both.”

“You’re in luck because you get one for free! Here’s your paper and your crate to take them home.”

“Wait only one?”

“Never separate them keep them in the same crate.”

“Alright don’t separate them, thanks.”

I head back over to the case with my cats and the woman helps me open the case and the cats jump out and just sit there. Just staring up at me.

“They do that. They are very well behaved.”

Says the woman helping me.

I put the crate onto the ground and they look to the crate, back at me, then the woman.

“Go on you two. Get in the crate.”

Then they both got into the crate and sat there.

I got the rest of things taken care of for cat adoptions. Then left to go home.

After getting to the apartment building and going into my room. I open the crates door and they both walk out. Sit in front of me and look up at me. I feel almost compelled to talk to them. And so I do.

“Alright you two. This is your new home. I hope you two like the place. It’s nice I guess.”

Callie and Sadie both look around in unison. Then lay their eyes on the couch in front of my tv. They then shift their eyes back to me like they are asking permission to sit on the couch.

“You want to sit on the couch with me?”

Both cats chirp in unison with my answer and start walking over. I sit down and they both jump up. Go to each side of me as close as they can get and start loafing. Just watching tv. And that’s all we did for the rest of the day.

Until we went to bed of corse. 

By midnight I had gotten tired. And so like any normal person I got up. Turned off the tv and went to my room. As I was walking to bed. I had a massive wave of depression spread through me like I had been shot. I’m happy one moment then all I can think about is the cats. 

I was half way to my room by that point. 

“I’ll just sleep it off. A night of this won’t be a problem.”

I get into my room. Close the door. Then lay down to sleep. 

“He shouldn’t have done that.”

Said a feminine voice. 

“I know. It’s not like we can really talk to him.”

Said another voice

The voices go back and forth for a bit. Who are they talking about? And why does it sound so close?

Whatever it’s probably just some people from the other rooms around me. I’ll ask around in the morning.

When I awoke I noticed the depression was gone. I also noticed my door was open. I figured I probably just misremembered closing it. But then that’s when I sat up in bed and saw my cats staring at me. 

“You two hungry?”

No response.

“You two must be hungry? I’ll get you both some food.”

They just kept staring.

I get out of bed and their eyes followed me. Their heads followed me. And by the time I was to the door. They were still staring. 

“This is a little unsettling um. Forget it, im just gonna get you food.”

To say I was disturbed by the cats is an understatement. Anything that just looks and stares at you is weird on its own. But consistent staring is another thing entirely.

I got the cats food and turn around to put it into their bowls. And they were there at the bowls staring at me. 

“Ok fair enough.”

I put the food into the bowls then go refill the water bowls. At the sink I say.

“You two can eat.”

But they just keep staring. I put the water bowls on the other side of the room away from the food. And still staring. As a sign of retaliation I said.

“Can you two please stop staring at me?”

Then they started eating.

So yeah that’s my story of how I got my cats. And the first night with them. 

Here’s what I’m thinking. I’ve always wanted cats and when I finally get them. They are acting strange. Maybe it’s just me. I don’t really know. I don’t think animals normally stare consistently at you unless they are skittish. These cats arent skittish. So why stare?

Are they guardians? Why did I hear voices last night? Well I’ll figure out who made the voices soon I hope. But that still doesn’t help me with what I am currently dealing with. Please help me. It’s why I’m posting this after all. But I really just want to know why. 

My cats keep staring at me in strange ways.
