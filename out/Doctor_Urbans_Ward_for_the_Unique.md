Thud, thud, thud…

Our footsteps were the only sound disturbing the hall’s silence, which was made even more disturbing by the nature of this place. However, Dr. Urban was utterly calm. She looked back to meet my gaze with a smile.

How could I have known that the kind smile of an elder would lead to such a horrid tale?

“You wouldn’t believe how glad we are to have you, young man. It’s ironic, really. We have oh so many patients, so many guards, yet so few psychiatrists!”

I smiled back, trying not to fidget with the cuff of my sleeve.

“Indeed… Just as you’ve mentioned before.”

Dr. Urban blinked twice. I was afraid I offended the person who gave me my first job in years, before she simply chuckled.

“Sorry. It seems I’m growing old and senile myself. Which is why I will have our most experienced worker show you the ropes instead.”

I let out a mental sigh and the anxiety along with it. As I was about to ask who this experienced worker was-

“Ah, Mr. Gray, we were looking for you.”

Dr. Urban stopped in her tracks upon seeing the man in front of us and turned to me.

“Dr. Smith; this is Mr. Gray, our reliable head of security. In a sense, he is the warden here.”

She laughed at her own joke, but I wasn’t in the mood for humor beyond a forced chukle, neither was Mr. Gray, it seemed.

I realized it was my cue to introduce myself.

Remember what you learned… be confident…

And so I did, straightening my back before saying:

“Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gray. My name is Matthew Smith. I was just assigned here.”

Mr. Gray eyed me up and down, I took the opportunity to return the favor. He had average height, with the same belly all middle-aged people seemed to carry and a jungle of a beard. If he was indeed the most experienced guard here, in this haven of madness, that meant he saw things no man, woman or elder could dare claim to have seen.

“Pleasure’s all mine, kiddo.”

… Even so, I would’ve thought he was just another minimum-wage worker if I met him under different circumstances. It was funny, in a way.

Appearances are deceiving, I suppose.

“Please, explain the details of his job to Dr. Smith and introduce him to the patients.”

The guard took the documents his boss handed to him, turned his back and walked away.

“Uh… Ah !—“

I hastily followed him.

“Mr. Gray, m…”

The barrage of questions I was building quickly got destroyed by a grunt.

“Ugh… Just call me Carl.”

He muttered dismissively… I continued.

“Very well… Carl, mind if I ask what exactly will you show me?”

He opened his mouth, but no words came out; as if he needed some time to process my question. It was during this pause that I noticed Dr. Urban wasn’t accompanying us.

“You’ll meet the patients assigned to you, I will tell you how to deal with all of them, and that’s it.”

I blinked twice, hoping it would convey my confusion.

“That’s it ?”

No answer.

Silence…

I attempted to fill the silence with small talk.

“It’s… truly horrible that **they** are still around.”

That was when the rugged warden acknowledged my presence for the first time and raised an eyebrow.

“It almost sounds like you don’t count **‘em** as humans.”

Shit…

“F— forgive me. That wasn’t what I meant. Of course they’re people. But you would agree they took many lives.”

Of course, what I really wanted to say was “Those **things** took my sister and brother!”

Carl, who saw right through me, punished me with yet another period of silence before saying:

“They’re your patients, so be a better liar when talking to them.”

I felt a warmth on my face.

“I am… sorry.”

What else was there to say?

*“You could speak the truth.”*

Whisper of a familiar voice came from behind me. So familiar, in fact, that I knew exactly what kind of expression that *pale, blue-eyed* demon would be wearing if I could look at him. He would look down at me as if I was the pathetic pest he thought I was.

The irritation caught me off guard, causing a sigh to escape me unnoticed.

Even that small moment of weakness earned me another glare from the warden.

“Watch it, kiddo.”

I jolted straight.

“Yes sir—Carl. Won’t happen again.”

Carl slowed down to a halt as we approached a door with a sign that read ‘Patient Room 015’. I followed his example. He looked down at the papers that wrinkled in his hands.

“Now, you got patients fifteen, seventy-three and a hundred yeah? Damn…”

His frown and the pity in his eyes as he said the numbers were a warning any fool would notice. Of course, I did too; but ignored it. I needed this job, no, I wanted it desperately.

We entered. The only object in the marble-floored room was a chair and a control panel, which was facing a window.

Behind the window was a padded cell. In the middle of it was a young man, sitting with his legs crossed. Most of his face was obscured by the dark veil of his hair, but it wasn’t hard to imagine his smile, thanks to the cackling the speakers delivered from the inside. There was a sort of collar around his neck, like a reminder of his imprisonment. Pieces of paper with drawings on them were scattered carelessly around Patient 015. He was feverishly scribbling on a fresh piece of paper in his hand. His pen was moving as a blur across the white surface, despite seeming so wild and aimless at first, there was a certain… precision to the mad artist’s hand.

“Name: Jackson Black. Patient has extremely violent tendencies. Fifty-three confirmed murders, main suspect for dozens more.”

I looked at Carl with wide eyes.

Fifty-three murders… That many lives, gone forever. That was a lot, especially for one person to do. Of course, considering the culprit’s nature, it was a whole other story. Then, I noticed Carl left something out in his explanation.

“What about his… uniqueness, for lack of a better term?”

He scoffed at me.

“Guess. It’s the tradition for newbies around here.”

As much as I hated the word “newbie”, I had to admit that was an interesting tradition.

I looked back through the window. The mad artist, Jackson, was already done with his sketch, and had taken another piece of paper as his victim. I imagined a drawing taking form in the paper as if he was drawing with multiple hands.

“Is it… speed?”

He raised his eyebrow but didn’t answer. I took it as a yes.

“He gets violent when we try to take his drawings… more violent than usual… but we copy them while he is asleep.”

Carl picked up some papers from the panel and handed them to me.

The mad artist had range. Some drawings were surreal and dreamy, or rather, nightmarish, completely black pages with white spots that vaguely resembled humanoid figures, smiling faces with no bodies… Some drawings were quite realistic and graphic. Most were displaying streets, with puddles of blood and body parts lying in them; a hand, leg, head... in one of them, there was a torso with all limbs and the head severed clean off.

Carl frowned as I was looking at the last one.

“Sicko drew the crime scenes of his murders. He says he will do all of his kills before…”

He lingered for a moment, then met my curious gaze and let out a sigh.

“Before he gets out of here… which will never happen.”

I absorbed the information while inspecting the last of the pictures. When I lifted my gaze—

“Jesus!”

Jackson, who was sitting in the middle of his cell a moment ago, was now standing right in front of the window, trembling, blinking in and out of existence. I had never seen anything like it… but that wasn’t why I feared. The window was supposed to be one-sided, yet I could still feel his gaze on us.

“What the—“

Carl noticed a moment later. This made the warden angry, he walked up to the one-sided window and slammed his fist on it. Jackson must’ve noticed the window vibrating, because he visibly flinched. The display of anger continued when Carl pushed on a button that I assume was the microphone.

“Don’t you get cocky, bastard!”

Jackson slowly tilted his head, his smile returning.

“I was only curious about the new doctor and you are yelling at me. Why is it, Carl? **Did I scare you?**”

Wait a second, I thought to myself.

“How did he…”

But I was cut off.

“…know there’s a newbie?”

Carl looked at me with a mix of exhaustion… and worry.

“These guys have more tricks up their sleeves than just their abilities.”

This time, his voice was a whisper. Then a voice broke out of the speaker.

“Greetings, good doctor! Have we met before?..”

Jackson smiled a crooked smile as he seemingly looked me up and down. I instinctively pursed my lips in disgust. As Carl stepped away, I leaned on the speaker.

“No, I don’t believe so.”

There was a moment of awkward silence… then I gathered my courage.

“Hi, Jackson. My name is Matthew, you can call me whatever you’d like. Nice to meet you.”

That was a little too… informal for me, yet it’s a preferred approach for younger patients.

“Matthew… Matthew…”

Jackson tasted my name, trying to recognize it, and sighed in disappointment.

“Nope. Doesn’t ring a bell.”

I blinked. In that fraction of a second, the mad artist was back to the middle of his cell, the space in between just vanished.

Patient 015 made my mind race. While all my thoughts, questions and ideas swarmed like flies in my head, I heard my reliable guard’s footsteps towards the door.

“Come on, to the next patient.”

“Wait!”

I said, a bit abruptly, prompting him to glare at me. I composed myself before continuing.

“I would like to talk to Patient 015 alone if possible.”

His eyes widened a little at my request. I wasn’t sure why, it seemed reasonable that a psychiatrist would like to speak to their new patient.

“What? Why?”

“First impressions matter. I have questions for Patient 015, and he’ll open up more without feeling threatened.”

“Threatened?”

Carl repeated, as if that was the most ridiculous thing he ever heard. He stepped towards me.

“You think that maniac feels threatened by us?!”

I raised my hands in a calming manner.

“I—I know but…”

“If that collar didn’t hold him back, we would turn into red haze before you can blink!”

“I know!.. But he can’t break out of that room while the collar is on. I need him to thi—know he can talk to me.”

I decided to be careful what I said, since Jackson seemed to have… unnatural senses. While Carl kept his steady glare at me, his silence indicated that he was trying to think of a rebuttal, which he failed at.

“I will be right outside the door.”

He lingered for a moment, as if hesitating.

“Don’t show fear to the bastard.”

He shut the door, leaving me alone with a serial killer. The speaker crackled to life.

“Why did you send your friend away, good doctor?”

I leaned over to the microphone.

“So that you and I can have a conversation.”

I meant what I said. As much as I despised these… beings, I take my job very seriously. My task was understanding, and if possible, treating their mental state. And that’s exactly what I intended to do… for the time being.

He tilted his head, a hint of curiosity dropping into his amusement, then moved back in front of the window, without wasting a nanosecond.

“Oh?”

I had his attention. The next step was keeping it. While I was trying to think of a question that would pique his interest, he started talking.

“This is the first time a psychiatrist wanted to stay alone with me, fifty-three kills and all that. Of course, we are never alone. It is everywhere.”

Of course, I knew what he was referring to. It invaded every minute of my existence as well, but this wasn’t the time for that.

“Speaking of killing, what was your motivation? Was it simply the thrill or something more?”

He scoffed, curiosity fleeting from his expression.

Dammit!

“If you must know, experimentation; I wanted to know the limits of my influence. Society is built on the fact that one man can’t defeat an army, this is why no one can just do whatever they want. But my kind is an exception to that fact. I wanted to see what the world would do if I did more than one human can achieve. I could easily kill more than sixty in a day, but then I wouldn’t be able to see the slow descent of humanity. That’s why I proceeded one murder a day.”

It sent a chill down my spine, how matter-of-factly he was talking about his killing spree being nothing but a social experiment.

No, focus.

His tone was mechanical, as if his words were scripted. He must’ve heard this question hundreds of times and he must’ve grown used to giving this answer. More importantly, I wouldn’t be able to get genuine answers out of him if he didn’t find me worth talking to. How could I get his interest?..

*“Why don’t you try empathizing with him?”*

I turned to my left at the sudden noise. There was another pale figure. This wasn’t the blue-eyed demon, this was the angel wannabe with emerald eyes. I was about to sigh, when an idea hit me. I rubbed my chin in thought before saying:

“You… might be onto something.”

Jackson followed my gaze before turning back to me.

“What was that?”

I met his gaze.

“Nothing. I was thinking out loud.”

I straightened my stance, trying to appear confident.

“Let me share a theory with you, Jackson.”

He gestured for me to go on.

“Your kind can perceive and do things mundane humans can’t even comprehend. For you, trying to live like a human is like spending your life with a blindfold. That is why you seem mad to us. But you don’t agree, do you?”

His eyes gleamed, his form rippled. He suddenly pressed his face and palms against the window. For a moment, I was afraid he would break the window and rip me apart, but he didn't.

“Finally! One of you gets it!”

He kept vibrating, as if about to explode. His grin widened, revealing a set of rotting teeth. His words were overlapping each other, multiple voices repeating the same line, as if one voice wasn’t enough to carry his manic glee.

“You recognize what I am. If so—“

Suddenly, a light on his collar lit up, followed by a beeping noise. He returned to his regular form, falling to the floor with a yelp as it electrocuted him.

The door behind me unlocked and Carl rushed in.

“Did the asshole try to break through!?”

I was speechless for a moment or two. Carl spent those moments glaring at Jackson, whose pained yelps turned to laughter.

“Uh… No, no he did not.”

Carl slowly turned his attention to me. The anger and wariness of his expression didn’t fade. He muttered “Good…” among his grunts.

“To the next patient.”

As I followed him, slightly afraid of his anger, a voice plagued the air.

“**Doctor**!”

Jackson beamed, grinning ear to ear as he sat up from the floor. We locked eyes before Jackson exclaimed.

“I can’t wait.”

I stood there with an open mouth, letting the fear sink in, before Carl pushed me out of the room.

We walked in silence until we stopped in front of Patient 073’s room.

“Are you gonna try talking to him too?”

“Of course.”

Carl gave me his apparently trademark displeased look before grunting.

“Don’t blame me for what happens.”

Before I could process what he said, let alone ask what he meant, he pushed the door open. The observation area was pretty much same as Jackson’s room. However, inside the padded cell…

Or it was supposed to be padded, but it seemed there were fist marks, tears and cracks all over the cell. I saw a human-sized mound of grotesque flesh, sitting in a corner. It looked like someone just piled a bunch of limbs on top of each other, and that mound… was sobbing.

“Oi, Robert.”

Carl said to the microphone. The mound unfolded like a centipede’s legs, revealing a bald man, tears running down his cheeks.

“**Where is…**”

His sobbing turned into heavy breathing. Fiery rage shone in his eyes as if he wanted to burn through the window separating us.

**“…my…**”

He lifted his six arms and slammed them on the floor.

“**…daughter!?**”

Carl gave Robert time to calm down.

“We still don’t know.”

Robert’s anger seemed to build up. He stood up straight and walked up to the window, towering over us. But he just slumped his shoulders, went back to his corner and kept weeping, as if deciding his wrath was useless.

Carl pulled me away from the window to talk.

“This one can’t hear or see us. But whatever you did to Jackson, don’t do it to Robert, if you wanna live, that is.”

I was confused. That could’ve been a normal warning, but something told me otherwise.

“Why? He can’t hurt us with the collar on, right?”

“Screw the collar, screw the walls and screw the weapons. He could tear through all of them like paper if he wanted to. He doesn’t, because he doesn’t want to.”

I tilted my head, urging him to continue.

“As long as he thinks we will find his daughter, we are safe. If not…”

He ran a finger across his throat. Its meaning was clear. But there was something that wasn’t clear, because of the way he phrased that.

“Can we find his daughter?”

His expression was unreadable. That was, somehow, worse than any clear answer he could give me. He handed me Robert’s files.

“Good luck. You’ll need it.”

He stormed out of the room. I stood there, in the empty observation room, and began reading the documents in my hand.

Robert Adams, 42

According to patient’s own testimony, they have been showing symptoms since the age of 15 and hid them successfully. However, patient experienced a breakdown after the death of their daughter, Elena Adams, and caused a total of 9 million dollars worth of damage to public and private property. While the anomaly defective collar prevents Patient 073 from utilizing their full capabilities, they still sustain their strength and current state.

Among the cold, soulless lines on the paper, one specific word caught my eye.

Death.

Robert’s daughter was no more. Yet he was still asking for her, convinced they would be reunited. This creature—this person was in denial of his daughter’s fate, and the ward exploited that weakness.

No metal could withstand the beast, so they imprisoned it in a cage of lies.

Most would argue that this was cruelty, but it was the only way to save the lives of every innocent person who could become collateral damage to Patient 073’s relentless wrath… right?

*“Let’s release it!”*

I flinched at the sudden noise, my train of thought interrupted. Sitting on the chair, facing me, was a man whose eyes were two pools of darkness, sharply contrasting his pale skin. This was the third… thing, that whispered in my ear.

*“All we have to do is speak the truth, and then*—*and then we will have a chance!”*

It was no angel or demon. I don’t even think it had a sense of morality. It was just a monster who didn’t care about anything else as long as it got what it wanted.

It kind of reminded me of Jackson. The thought sickened me.

No, focus.

I shooed the black-eyed man out of the chair and turned on the microphone.

“Greetings, Mr. Adams. My name is Matthew Smith, I’m your new psychiatrist.”

The broken shell of a man waved his hand dismissively.

“Just do whatever you came to do and leave me alone.”

I chuckled.

“You see, that’s the one thing I can’t do.”

He lifted his head to glare at the window.

“**I won’t ask again.**”

My blood froze in my veins. Something primal from the depths of my mind screamed at me, telling me to run. I resisted the urge.

“Good. Then you can answer. Mr. Adams, can you tell me about the day you were brought to the ward?”

A hint of confusion dropped into his gaze.

“Why are you asking me that? Just assign me whatever medicine they always do and leave.”

I smiled weakly.

“Unfortunately, I can’t give you a medication that clearly doesn’t work. So, I need to have a couple of sessions with you until I can assign you any medicine.”

The beast’s frown deepened. He uncurled his limbs once again, using all his arms and legs to crawl up to the window. Only then did he stand up on his legs, however many there were. Robert opened his mouth and told his horrible, horrible story.

“It was when I took Elena to the park. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She was playing, laughing, sometimes falling over and crying, but then getting up to keep running around.”

His lips twisted into a sad smile for a brief moment before his frown returned.

“On our way home, she was upset because I didn’t get her ice cream. Argh… I lost because of something so—I would give her the world if I could go back to that moment.”

He raised two of his many hands to look at them, his voice was shaky.

“At one point, she got mad and started running… Before I could catch up to her, a man came out of a car nearby, caught her, dragged her into the car and yelled at the driver to punch it.”

Robert started hyperventilating.

“I froze. I couldn’t tell if that was reality or nightmare I— I just watched as my little girl was taken from me.”

The strong, monstrous man in front of me slowly descended into misery.

“That was when I lost my control… I unleashed It. I let the voice win and used Its blessing. I destroyed streets and buildings until I caught up to those bastards!”

The memories of loss forged that misery into fury.

“I tore the car apart and crushed those two into pulps. But my little girl was nowhere to be seen…”

His fury had no target, nothing to burn. So it slowly died down, leaving nothing but ashes. He continued with no particular emotion in his voice.

“It must’ve been half an hour before the soldiers showed up, a few hours before all the bullets and anesthetic darts brought me down. But the harm was done.”

As soon as he ended his tale, silence descended upon the world. It was so heavy, it took all my will power not to collapse on the floor.

I learned a lot from what Patient 073 had told me… including things I shouldn’t have.

A trail of destruction that spanned multiple streets, following a car, and then hours of aimless terrorism caused by one person. What Robert told me was very similar to what happened to Asheville, North Carolina. The news of that massacre was the hot topic of news for weeks, it was used as an argument against everyone who defended the freedom of supernatural.

The goverment never revealed the name or face of the culprit, no one cared much because everyone believed they were killed by the soldiers anyway.

Did I discover a piece of forbidden knowledge?

Was I standing before someone who destroyed an entire city in a tantrum?

Did that same person accidently kill his own daughter while tearing up the car she was kidnapped in?

Thoughts of dread flooded my brain, threatening to drown me, before a voice pulled me out.

“So? If that’s all you want, leave me alone.”

I stared at him blankly, the pressure from the voices in my head was too much for me to care about putting on an expression. Among those voices, words of that black-eyed creature echoed: Release it, all we have to do is speak the truth.

I had a decision to make. So I did.

“Sorry… Your story really impacted me, Mr. Adams. I promise we will find your daughter.”

He slowly nodded, as if grateful for the bit of hope I tried to provide for him.

I turned around and walked out of the room, covered in sweat. Once out of the room, I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding. I leaned against a wall, closed my eyes to block out the light and tried to steady my breathing. The scent of hand sanitizer and medicine assaulted my senses, before it was replaced by smoke.

“How much did you figure out?”

I reluctantly opened my eyes and looked at my side, where Carl was looking at me with a stoic gaze. I turned to the dirty white wall in front of me, revelations flooding back. I slid down until I was sitting on the floor.

“Oh my god… Oh God…”

Carl coughed and threw his cigar at a nearby trash can.

“So, enough.”

Realization hit me like a truck, it was so sudden that I couldn’t help but say it out loud.

“Are you gonna get rid of me now ?”

Carl sat down beside me.

“If we ‘silenced’ everyone who learned a thing or two, we would have no personnel left here.”

I tried to read his expression, to no avail. Unsure of how honest my alleged friend was, I returned my gaze to the wall in front of me.

“Do you need a minute ?”

I had no time to waste, so I stood back up.

“No, no thank you. Let’s proceed.”

We proceeded. Most of the way was spent in the elevator.

Until we reached the underground floor. There were fewer doors there. We walked to the furthest end of the hallway, and there it was: Patient 100.

“Any ominous advice ?”

Carl froze with his hand on the handle.

“Surprisingly, I got nothing to tell you.”

Behind the doors, behind the observation window; I saw a woman who had short brown hair and matching eyes. If I could describe her in one word, it would be “normal”. She wasn’t drawing pictures of bloodshed and death, she wasn’t drowning in regret and sadness; she was just sitting on her bed and looking at the ceiling with a thoughtful expression.

“Charlotte Ford, 27. She turned herself in a few years ago.”

“What ?”

I was so confused, the word just escaped my mouth. A meta-human just turned herself in ? Everyone had an idea how captured ones were treated, so why ? Carl chuckled.

“That was the exact same reaction I had when I learned. Ah, if we were to trust her word, she did it because she didn’t want to hurt anyone.”

Of course, no one in their right mind would believe that. Well, no one who had trauma caused by the supernatural, which was all of humanity.

“Did she do anything suspicious since she came here ?”

Carl let out a series of grunts as he shook his head.

“No, that’s the problem. She didn’t do anything. At least not on first sight.”

That implied there were subtle things that raised suspicion, little signs he picked up while the others missed thanks to years of experience.

“Ever since she came here, most of the personnel started sleep walking. We have no proof it had anything to do with her but I know it. She’s plotting something.”

He pointed his finger at me almost accusingly, making sure I was all ears.

“So, before you ask, I ain’t letting you talk to her alone.”

I opened my mouth to protest but no words came out. Carl’s gaze scared me into silence.

“Okay then.”

I leaned down to the microphone.

“Hello, Charlotte. My-”

A slight smile appeared on her face, still looking at the ceiling.

“Hi Matthew.”

A stranger knowing my name should have scared me. But it wasn’t the strangest thing that happened to me today. Actually, I was kind of proud that I saw that coming. However, what happened next; nothing prepared me for it.

“Carl, I know you are there, so hear me out.”

She finally faced the window, switching to a cross-legged position.

“I was planning to do a jail break tomorrow, but for the sake of our friend over here, I will do it today. In fact, right now.”

Her words hung in the air, making it hard to breathe. For a moment, we didn't do anything. Her tone made it sound like she was being sarcastic. By the time we both realized she wasn’t, the alarms were already assaulting our ears.

“What did you do!?”

Carl yelled. Charlotte shrugged.

“Right now? Nothing. But you could say the preparations I’ve been doing for years released some of the patients. Most of them, actually.”

He didn’t need to hear more. Carl was the warden of this place, so without wasting anymore time, he dashed out of the cell. I didn’t know what he was planning to do, all I know is that, it didn’t work.

I looked at Charlotte, who stretched lazily and got up. She somehow met my gaze with a knowing smile. I was finally piecing things together. Personnel who started sleepwalking, she knew my name and goal, she did ‘preparations’ for today from within her cell… She was in my head, she was in everyone’s head. Which is how she answered my question before I even asked it.

“I think you know who, or rather, what I am.”

Then I felt something shift, something forced its way into my consciousness, showing me something. It wasn’t quite like a vision or telepathy. It felt as though I was receiving knowledge in its purest form. Yes, I knew what she was.

I knew what **It** was.

“Go, do what you came here to do. Remember, **you owe me now**.”

Words got stuck in my throat, so I just nodded before rushing out of the cell and into hell.

In that short amount of time, carnage was already upon the ward. Even through the alarms that gleamed red, I could see the splashes of blood on the walls. I also saw corpses while running through the halls. There were mutilated, dismembered, crushed corpses. But the ones that caught my eye were corpses that I don’t even know what happened to.

Some of them were suspended mid-air, like puppets on strings. Some of them were simply frozen, like a picture or a paused video. I tried to ignore them. Scenes of bloodshed and destruction always remind me of a certain time… But I couldn’t get distracted, not now. The combination of screams from the upper floors and wailing alarms made it hard to think.

*“Get in the elevator and go to the first floor. Go, go, go!”*

Luckily my apparitions kept me grounded. I bitterly followed the blue-eyed bastard’s instructions and when I reached the first floor, I saw the first living thing I’ve seen since the rampage began.

It was one of the patients, I think. It was a lanky, gaunt abomination with skin as dark as coal and no mouth. Blood was dripping from its needle-like claws. I thought I was looking at the personification of horror. When it turned its head with a loud crack to look at me, I was almost blinded by the bright white glow of its eyes. It got on all fours and started crawling towards me like a cockroach, only much faster than it should’ve been possible. I still remember the click-clack of it’s claws against the metal floor.

I was inside the elevator, with no way to run away from the creature, so I ran towards it instead. Just before death was upon me, I rolled to the side; the abomination got carried forward by its momenum and into the elevator. I must’ve been blessed by some deity—It perhaps, because the elevator doors closed in the right time to imprison the patient. I didn’t stop to ponder how long the metal doors would delay the inevitable. I ran as fast as possible.

I somehow avoided slipping on blood or tripping on organs. On my way, I ran past other horrifying scenes. Patients were killing guards. Even when guards landed lucky shots, they didn’t last long after that. With each gruesome battle I witnessed, I started worrying more and more about my own survival.

At some point, the floor beneath my feet shook. It kept happening, each time followed by escalating screams. Then, at the end of the hall I was walking on, a mound of grotesque flesh revealed itself. Its pulsing tentacles were snatching and crushing people, its dozens of mouths devouring everything in its path. It made no distinction between patients and guards. And then it spoke, its voice the furthest thing from human I ever heard.

“It spoke to me… It told me the doctors and soldiers lied… It told me you were never looking for Elena…”

The thing shifted, it sproted new limbs and reached out to me, like a flood of hatred and hunger. My voice shaking, I answered.

“I will tell you about your daughter!”

The claws, fangs and tentacles stopped mid-assault. They shrunk, some of them disappeared. Finally, something that looked human was standing in front of me. It was Robert. He was looking at me, expectantly.

When I saw him there, nothing separating us, it didn’t cause me fear. No— this was exactly what I wanted. The next words that came out of my mouth were exactly what I wanted him to hear.

“I used to live with my older siblings, Jake and Carol, the most precious people in my life. Jake loved messing with us, but he got furious when someone else did it. Carol had severe anxiety, she would triple check everything, but I knew it came from a place of love.”

The emerald-eyed one was sitting on the ground with a sad look in its eyes.

“Both of them worked day and night so I could study psychology in another city. I visited them every semester, promising them that their efforts would pay off. When I finally graduated, we made plans to throw a party with all our friends before I moved in with them.”

The blue-eyed one was piercing Robert with his ice cold glare.

“Imagine my surprise when, on my drive to Asheville, I glanced out the window and saw buildings falling down one by one… The news claimed the meta-human that did it was killed by the army. But I knew that wasn’t true… Because It whispered to me. I searched high and low, until I finally found you.”

Robert didn’t break eye contact even for a moment. When I was done speaking and silence filled the air, his body started pulsing like something was crawling under his skin.

“You said you would tell me about my daughter…”

I guessed Robert wouldn’t care about my story. His mind was too far gone. But I wanted him to hear, I wanted him to know.

I wanted him to think about it in his last moments.

“**Where is…**”

“**…my…**”

“**…daughter!?**”

Robert violently coughed blood after saying that, because my black-eyed phantom thrust its arm through him.

*“Finally !”*

He looked down but only saw the large hole in his chest.

The blue-eyed demon stepped up and threw an aggressive kick, breaking Robert’s leg.

*“You deserved it.”*

The green-eyed angel grabbed Robert’s arm. Softly at first, but it then thightened its grip.

*“Sorry…”*

I don’t know if Robert heard its whisper, but he sure felt it when his arm got ripped off.

My invisible helpers’ assault brought the beast down, or so I thought. A moment later, the broken leg fixed itself with a loud crack, the hole on his chest closed and his arm regrew. It didn’t stop there. His flesh started spreading on the floor like a tumor, preparing to kill me as he did with all the poor souls before me. The difference this time, I was the target of his wrath; my siblings and Asheville were merely collateral damage.

I took a few steps back. Once my fear overcame my anger, I realised something.

I could die here. I was gonna die here.

I had to act quick, think of a way out of this. I went through everything I knew about Robert, about anomalies… anything, I just needed to find a way. But what ? How could I survive something that can’t be killed ? When Robert’s dozens of murderous eyes looked at me, I said the first thing that came to my mind.

“You killed Elena !”

The hulking mound of flesh froze for a moment, before it started writhing even more intensely. Its dozen mouths screamed.

“**LIES! YOU ARE LYING!**”

For some reason, he didn’t attack me yet. So I kept pressing.

“When you attacked those kidnappers and tore their car apart, you accidentally killed her too !”

Robert began circling me, like a vortex of fangs and eyes.

“**STOP LYING! STOP!**”

Robert had no reason to believe me after finding out the ward has been lying about Elena. Except, he knew I was right. Someone’s affirmation was all he needed for his denial to be broken.

And just as I thought, the vortex died down, until all that remained of it was the empty husk of a mad man.

“Elena… She was my baby… Oh my sweet, precious baby…”

Robert clenched his head thightly, weeping just like he did the first time I met him. I didn’t stay there for what was to come. I turned my back and started walking away. His cries kept intensifying, followed a wet squelch… and silence.
