I’m not sure what just happened, and neither is my boyfriend. We’re both spooked and looking for answers we’ll likely never find. For context, Tim and I have lived together for two years and honestly have never had any serious fights. 



Some important details:

 

He’s bald. He shaved his head last year when he decided it would look better than having thinning hair. This has never caused any issues with my attraction to him and he knows that.

 

He works a job that sometimes has him leaving town for short stretches of time. Normally, he’s gone for just a few nights and will tell me if plans change and he’s staying later or coming home earlier than expected.

 

And finally, he’s incredibly kind. Our arguments don’t end in raised voices and definitely don’t end in name-calling or abuse. I’ve been belittled and verbally abused by past partners, so I know a bad man when I see one. He isn’t one.

 

At the end of last week, Tim left for one of his work trips and said he would be gone until Tuesday morning. I dropped him off at the airport on Friday evening and began my weekend alone with our two cats.

 

He didn’t call me at all while he was gone. This was unusual, but I figured he must be busy so I brushed it off. He had sent me a “just landed” text later on Friday, which was good enough for me.

 

I woke up on Monday morning to a freezing house. It’s currently about 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit every day where I live and I never keep the AC too cold for my comfort. When I checked the temperature, it showed the same number it always does despite the air around me feeling frigid. The cats were cuddled together on the couch under our throw blanket.

 

As I was deciding whether or not to simply turn up the room temperature, the front door opened and my boyfriend shuffled in. “Hi!” I greeted him, confused but excited to see him. I was sure I hadn’t gotten a “coming home today” text from him, but I could have missed it.

 

As surprised as I was by his early return, I was more puzzled by the beanie on his head. Who wears a beanie in July? And why had I never seen him wear this dark-blue one before?

 

Tim said nothing, aggressively threw his duffle bag down at my feet, and shuffled down the hall to our bedroom. I followed him and asked him how his trip went. He grunted in response and slammed the bedroom door.

 

Immediately the worst assumptions ran through my mind. Maybe he’d lost his job. Maybe he, for some out-of-the-blue reason, assumed I had done something to break his trust while he was gone. I knocked on the bedroom door. “Can we talk?” I asked sheepishly. Tim opened the door and stood there staring at me menacingly. “You were supposed to call me and you didn’t,” he said with a coldness in his voice I had never heard before.

 

He hadn’t asked me to call him. And as I’ve stated, normally he’s the one who calls me throughout these trips. “I mean…I’m sorry, but—” I started to reply. Tim pushed past me, stomped over to the living room couch, threw his beanie across the room, and sat down, crossing his arms over his chest.

 

That’s when I noticed he had hair again. Not just a tiny bit of fuzz like he was due for a shave but didn’t get around to it. He had the exact amount of hair he’d had right before he made the decision to go bald, with the same thinning pattern. The entire house was still very cold, but the air immediately around Tim felt especially frigid. “Why didn’t you call me, you fucking bitch?!” he demanded when he finally spoke again. His voice was so loud that it scared the cats out of the room.

 

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t form an answer. Tears welling in my eyes, I turned away from him and started toward the kitchen. As I was hastily cooking some scrambled eggs and trying to calm myself, I glanced back and saw Tim staring at me from the doorway. His arms were slack at his sides and his eyes were empty and dead. The air in the kitchen began to feel colder. He stood there just like that the entire time I cooked.



It wasn’t just that Tim was being harsh toward me for seemingly no reason. The entire aura around him felt off. This *was* Tim, but it was all wrong.

 

I offered him a plate of eggs but he didn’t respond or even sit at the table with me. As I ate, he retreated to the bedroom and stood watching me behind the partially-closed door. He stayed in our bedroom in complete silence for the rest of the morning. I left for work after an hour, hoping things would maybe get a little less weird after we had some time apart.

 

I returned home late that night to an extraordinarily cold house. Every room felt like a walk-in freezer. The light was on in our bedroom but Tim was still shut inside. I decided to sleep on the couch, though Tim’s presence still creeped me out even from behind that closed door.

 

But when I woke up the next morning, the light was off in our bedroom and Tim was gone. Normally he would take a day off of work after traveling, so I hadn’t expected him to be at work that morning. The temperature in the house felt normal again. I reached for my phone and saw a text from Tim. “Just landed,” it said. It was sent an hour ago.

 

Then I noticed I had several missed calls from Tim from over the last several days. Calls that hadn’t come through at all. He left a voicemail early this morning. As I was listening to it, the front door opened and Tim walked in.

 

“Helloooo!” he shouted in his usual cheerful way. He set his duffle bag down gently along the wall and pulled me into a hug. His hair was gone. “Sorry to surprise you,” he said. “I decided to take a Lyft home instead of calling you so early to pick me up.”

 

I told Tim what I’d experienced yesterday. I told him all about how creepy and mean he’d been acting and how I hadn’t been getting any phone calls.

 

And now we’re both trying to figure who—or what—was in our house with me.
