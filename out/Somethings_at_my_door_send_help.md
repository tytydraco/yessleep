This started about a month ago. someone would knock at my door but when I’d open my door, there was nothing. At first I thought it was the local trouble makers but then I thought “why would they target me?” then it was “I'm on the 13th floor, that's a lot of effort to mess with someone”. Then again I've heard stories of kids who’ve tormented someone for months just because he looked at him funny. After the first three days I used the majority of my money to buy a camera to put outside my door. When they came knocking again I looked at my camera to see absolutely nothing.

My thought then was to point it down the hallway to see if I could watch them run away because I’m at the opposite end of the stairs and elevator. So the next day when they knocked I looked immediately and once more saw nothing, so still looking at my phone I opened my door and saw no one, and I didn’t hear any doors close so it’s not like they hide in a room. Might I add that the walls are very thin so I can hear someone at the end of the hall open and close their door. I looked at the time and took note; 1:03 PM. I was stumped, how could I win? The next few weeks I tried sitting at my door and when I heard the knock I threw the door open but once more I got nothing. Then after that I tried sitting with my door open right before 1:00 PM but then I just heard the knock from the stairs at the end of the hallway.

I tried talking to the police but they said that with no real evidence or threat then they couldn’t do anything. I tried telling them that it was harassment but they just laughed and said then that every Mormon should be put on trial then. Thankfully I know a guy there that I just so happen to be friends with since elementary school; I’ll call him John. John agreed to stay up with me till 1:00 PM but after that he was gone for the night. Again at 1:00 PM I heard the knock. I jumped up from where I was sitting and shouted “there it is, right on time.” I ran to the door and opened it to again see nothing but this time when I looked down the hall I saw a leg go into the stairwell.

I ran down the hall with John in tow saying something I couldn’t hear. I ran to the stairwell and opened the door just to see the leg going down the stairs. I followed skipping steps along the way, shouting for them to stop. I made it to the bottom of the stairs to see the door close. I ran through the door and ran face first into a chest, before I continue let it be said that I consider myself to be pretty tall, standing at 6’6 and when I say I ran into his chest, I hit like just below his pecks. I step back getting ready to really lay into this person but standing in front of me is no man, but a thing, a monster, a creature.

 Though it stood on two legs and had a head, shoulders, and two arms it was not human. Its skin was black and almost gelatinous. It wore a tattered trench coat and chimney sweep hat, and on its face was a cracked yellow, cartoon smiley face mask. Only being held on by what I could only assume to be its head. It spoke in a deep gravelly voice that sounded as if it had many voices. “You are seeking things that should not be sought. You are making a very big mistake, seek us again and you shall learn the consequences.” and with that it was off, making large strides to cover a large amount of ground fast.

Just then John came up behind me, out of breath, and through gasps of air he spat out “I don't… know… what you heard… but… I heard nothing… no person… no footsteps… and definitely… no… knocking.” I just sat there in stunted silence. I tried to tell him what I just saw but I physically couldn’t. I just told him to go home and get some rest. I went up to my room passing people looking outside their rooms to check what all the commotion was but I paid them no mind. I went to bed that night, and believe me or not but I swear I heard knocking from my bedroom window just before bed. This was two days ago and the knocking has gotten worse.

 Now its at 1:00 PM, 1:13 PM, and 1:26 PM. I need sleep but I just can’t. It's currently 1:37 PM and I just heard a very distinctive knocking at my bedroom door at the times listed before. The clock has just hit 1:39 and I just heard it from my walls, my door, and my window. I see his face at my window and I think I see a crack. My door is splintering too, I've called the cops but they just called me the crazy knocking guy. This is my last ditch effort to get help or at the very least, get my story out there so when they find me dead, they know why.
