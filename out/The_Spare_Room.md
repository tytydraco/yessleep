This might be nothing, but I have had this gnawing feeling in my stomach ever since I got back from my cousin’s place. And after what happened last night…I just need to get this out.

So I stayed at my cousin Tyler’s house for a few days while I was in town for work. He’s kind of a weird guy, lives alone in this older two-story house near the edge of the woods. Not run-down or anything—just…creaky.

Like it remembered being someone else’s house longer than it has been his.

As if it was waiting for someone who never came back.

Or maybe never got the chance.

The upstairs felt heavier. Like the house was quieter there, but not empty. Like it was waiting for someone small to come back.

He offered me the spare bedroom upstairs, which was nice.

Said no one ever uses it after his mom passed, so it was “all mine.” Though that somehow made me feel even worse. Like I was borrowing something that hadn’t been unwrapped yet.

 

I had not thought about his mom in years. She died when we were teens. I barely remembered her, just that she always kept one door in the house closed. Never went upstairs. Always smelled faintly like baby powder

But the first weird thing happened right when I got there: when he showed me the room, he didn’t step inside. Just opened the door and stood in the hallway.

“Don’t leave the closet door open,” he said.

He didn’t say why. Just tapped the doorframe twice, like he was confirming it heard him.

His fingers tapped the frame like a knock—rhythmic, almost rehearsed. Like a lullaby played backwards.

I laughed, thinking he was joking, but he didn’t smile. Tyler tapped the doorframe twice and said, “Just keep it shut. I have had issues.”

When I asked what kind of issues, he shrugged. “It creaks. Makes noise at night. Doesn’t matter if you hear it or not, just keep it closed.”

I thought that was a weird way to phrase it—“doesn’t matter if you hear it or not.” It sat with me longer than it should have. But whatever. Every house has its quirks.

The room was clean, barely used.

But there was a chipped baseboard with faded pink paint beneath the white. Like it had once been a different room for a different someone.

My eyes drifted to a spot near the closet where the wallpaper peeled in the shape of something square—like a toy shelf had once been there. But the square was too low. Lower than eye-level.

Like it had waited for someone smaller.

Someone who never got tall.

First night, nothing happened. The bed was stiff, the room a little too cold.

I kept the closet shut. Just like he said. I even made sure the latch clicked.

At some point during the night, I woke up. No reason. Just suddenly wide awake. The room felt different. Still quiet, but wrong.

The closet door was open.

Not wide—just a few inches. But enough.

I got up, muttering to myself, annoyed more than anything. Probably didn’t close it right. I shut it again, harder this time, and went back to bed.

I didn’t hear it creak. Didn’t feel the air shift.

No hinges.

Just…open.

Like it had always been that way and I had simply remembered it wrong.

I thought of a kid’s game—peekaboo, maybe. The kind that teaches you something disappears when you’re not looking. And returns…different.

And yet I had this weird thought as I was falling back asleep: If I didn’t hear it open, maybe it didn’t use the hinges.

Second night. I was more careful.

Tyler had gone to bed early—he sleeps on the couch downstairs, doesn’t even use the second floor. I asked him again about the closet thing, and he got vague.

“It used to be a nursery,” he said. “My mom never let me sleep in there either. Said it held on to things.”

There was a hesitation in his voice when he said “nursery.” Like he hadn’t said that word aloud in a long time.

Tyler did not look at the room.

He just sipped his coffee like it wasn’t the first time he’d tried to forget that sentence.

That did not help.

I shut the closet tight again. Wedged a chair under the knob just for good measure. I even took a photo to prove to myself I did it.

I woke up at 3:12 AM. Not from a sound—but from movement.

The chair was across the room.

And the closet door was open again.

This time wider. At least a foot.

The air felt thick. Like it was waiting for me to notice.

I didn’t go near it. Just turned on every light I could and stayed up until dawn.

I swear I heard whispering under the bed. Not words. Just…a mouth trying to remember how to speak. Like a kid trying to remember how to form words. Not like it forgot—but like no one had listened for a very long time.

Like someone reenacting a bedtime story no one read to them.

[Update: 3]

I asked Tyler one more time if he has ever actually seen anything in there.

He didn’t answer at first. Just sipped his coffee. Then he said: “If it likes you, it doesn’t hide.”

I laughed. “So what happens if it doesn’t like you?”

He didn’t laugh back.

“Don’t sleep facing the wall,” he said.

He didn’t say it like a warning. He said it like a rule he had already broken once.

I think he wanted to say more. But he just looked upstairs like someone who knows which stairs not to wake.

That night, he left a note on the kitchen table in his handwriting. Just three words: DON’T TURN OVER.

The paper he used had faint ink impressions beneath the message—loops and scratchy curves, like someone childish had drawn over it before.

[Update: 4]

Last night was my final night there. I broke every rule.

I was exhausted. I just wanted sleep. I didn’t check the closet. I didn’t check the chair. And I fell asleep facing the wall.

I woke up because something shifted on the mattress.

Not weight, exactly. More like a pulling. A tension.

I rolled over slowly. The room was dark.

But I heard breathing. Under the bed.

Not loud. Not gasping. Just slow, deep inhales. Like something sleeping downward. Like lungs stretched in the wrong direction.

It sounded like something was trying to match mine. Not mimic. Sync. Like it wanted to sleep the way I did.

I wanted to get up. I wanted to run. But something cold brushed my ankle.

I whispered: “I know you are there. Knock it off.”

It waited. As if that was the signal.

And the breathing stopped.

Nothing moved. But I felt the wrongness settle around me like static.

Then came the scratching.

It was not random. It was searching for the seam. The one that let things through.

It started slow—like one finger tracing the underside of the mattress. Then more joined in. Light at first. Curious. Then harder. Urgent.

The mattress groaned. I could feel the springs warping beneath me as if something was pushing up, slowly trying to get through.

I stayed frozen. Every muscle in my body screamed to move, but I couldn’t. The scratching became rhythmic. It sounded almost like…like it was digging. Inside the mattress.

When it finally stopped, there was a pause. Silence. Then, a whisper—not under the bed, but in my pillow, next to my ear:

“Still facing me.”

I didn’t scream. I couldn’t. My throat felt locked. I waited until sunrise before moving. When I finally got up, I saw the closet was closed. And the chair was back under the knob.

Except it was not the chair I remembered seeing. This one was old.

Too small.

The kind you would find in a classroom—or a nursery. The varnish was cracked like it had dried out waiting to be used.

There were faded stickers on the underside.

One looked like it used to be a cartoon face.

A smile, worn away.

One of the stickers looked like it had been peeled off and stuck back on again. Like someone couldn’t bear to throw it away.

I touched the chair once. The wood felt soft, like it had been held by smaller hands for years.

I don’t know why, but I checked underneath it.

Scratched into the grain—five tallies. The last one fresh. Like something was still counting. Still keeping score in a game no one had finished.

I am home now.

I wanted to text Tyler. Just to ask if he ever turned over.

But I did not.

I think he already told me.

Not with words.

With the way he never goes upstairs.

The way he taps the doorframe like a promise he broke once. The way he never, ever says goodnight.

And just ten minutes ago, I heard a noise in my room.

A tiny creak.

And when I turned, my closet door was open.

I always leave it shut.

There are letters etched into the wood:

“Thank you for turning over. I knew you would.”

Beneath it, drawn faintly in blue crayon: a stick figure. Arms open wide.
Five lines above the head—like candles.

Or birthday wishes.

A smile too wide.

Like someone who practiced, but never got it quite right.
