Four years ago, I was diagnosed with end-stage liver failure. When I was younger, I drank more alcohol than water. I learned that selfishness hurt me more than anyone else ever could. Over time, I slowed down, not because I wanted to, but because partying in your thirties with college kids, as Freddy put it, “just isn't a good look” The yacht parties my dad kept throwing didn’t help either. Honestly, I wish I had a gambling addiction instead. At least then there was a chance of winning something. All I got was loss of time, health, and any humanity I thought I had left.

My liver was so damaged that there was no chance it could heal on its own. Apparently, my eyes were so yellow it looked like I “used pee as eye drops,” as Freddy joked. I was losing weight rapidly too. I was immensely relieved when I found out my dad had signed me up for Hemacare’s *Life Vault* package when I was a toddler. All they needed was a blood sample. It’s supposedly far superior to other organ-printing hospitals, but also significantly more expensive. I guess second chances are only for those who can afford them.

My doctor explained that while traditional transplants always carry a risk of rejection, Hemacare’s printed organs supposedly have a 100% success rate. They also promise the healthiest possible version of each organ. I called in for a transplant and was scheduled immediately.

When I arrived, a few weeks later, the facility felt more like a luxury hotel than a hospital, aside from the ever-present sterile smell in the stagnate air. The waiting room was quiet and cozy. I waited only a few minutes before a young asian girl entered. She had short black hair and wore high-end designer clothing. She dropped into the chair like she was visiting a friend’s house. She kept rubbing her left eye, which was covered by a surgical eyepatch. I kept some distance between us in case whatever she had was contagious. Eventually a nurse approached me.

“Hello, welcome to Hemacare. May I have your name?”

“Adam Jones.” Of course, this is an alias. Given the nature of this event, sharing my real name would be… unwise.

“All right, Mr. Jones. You’re on the *Life Vault* plan. Please follow me so we can get you changed into your hospital gown.”

The click of her heels echoed through the empty hall with each step, with the awkward silence I couldn't help but admire the polished dark wood floor and the walls painted a warm tan. The sterile scent only grew stronger as we walked. The nurse led me to a small changing room. I swapped my expensive, rumpled suit I'd slept in for a few days, for a surprisingly soft gown. The gown didn't come with slippers, leaving my bare feet to press against the cold floor, each step felt like walking on ice.

When I looked into the mirror it was hard to recognize myself. My eyes were piss yellow, my face and stomach thin. My hair that I’d kept clean and short was greasy and disheveled. I hardly had the energy to get out of bed most days, forget showering and shaving. I was hopeful that this surgery would give me the motivation I needed to get my life back.

“Would you like us to have this cleaned for you?”, she held it out with both hands as if the suit was radioactive.

“Sure,” I said. I couldn't blame her. It was filthy, and I’d been too exhausted to change.

“Of course. Please follow me to your room.” She sealed the suit in a clear garment bag and led the way.

Halfway down the hall, we were stopped at an intersection by two male nurses pulling a cart carrying a large red container about the size of a coffin. The shorter of the two men paused for a moment to look at his clipboard. As he scanned the page, a soft thud came from the container. He looked fearfully at the other nurse, who swiftly grabbed the handle of the cart and pulled it down the hallway, walking as fast as he could without running. The shorter nurse scrambled to follow him, throwing a nervous glance at me. 

I gazed down the hall they had come from and noticed a door labeled *Spare Room*. It was the only one with a badge scanner. I could see a red light glowing from under the door. Curiosity tugged at me.

“What’s in there?” I asked. 

The nurse looked briefly toward the door, clearly shaken by what just transpired. “Oh,” she laughed nervously, “that’s just the spare room. We store emergency equipment and replacement supplies there. Now, please follow me, we've almost reached your room.” 

As we walked, I couldn't stop thinking about that room. I glanced back, the red light was gone, but my interest wasn't.

When we reached my room, I noticed it had the same ID scanner as the spare room door from earlier. The nurse swiped the card hanging from her neck, and the door clicked open. When I entered the room, I was genuinely surprised. I’ve stayed in hotel rooms far less luxurious than this. The bed was all white, the room dimly lit and stylishly modern. Gray leather couches, a dark marble coffee table, a door to my own restroom, a huge flat-screen TV, and even a sleek mini-fridge humming quietly in the corner.

“This is where you’ll stay while you’re being treated. The duration depends on how your body responds. You’re free to leave the building, but we *strongly* recommend you don’t, especially before and after the surgery. Please make yourself at home. I’ll go call your surgeon.”

Naturally, I checked the fridge first. It was stocked with soft foods; applesauce, pudding, protein shakes, and an assortment of jelly. I took a cherry jelly cup and a plastic spoon, sat on the couch, and took my first bite of real food in days. You know you're at rock bottom when jelly is the most nutritious thing you've eaten in a week.

The translucent jelly glowed an unnatural red under the warmth of the overhead light . It brought back the memory of the light seeping from beneath the spare room door. I decided to go take a look around the hospital but when I made my way over to the door and turned the handle, it didn't budge, it was locked.

A short while later, a man in a white coat knocked and entered, leaving the door open.

“Good evening, Mr. Jones. I'm Dr. Mathew Ross, and I’ll be performing your surgery. But first I need to explain your situation. Your body shows clear signs of Decompensated cirrhosis, but luckily there’s still plenty of time to prepare. Your new liver will be ready soon. Until then, please do not eat anything for the next eight hours to avoid complications. Your surgery is scheduled for 10:00 PM. Also, please don’t leave the room. We’ll need to be able to reach you in case of an emergency. Do you have any questions?”

“Yes. Why is my door locked?”

Dr. Ross pulled a keycard from his coat pocket. “This is my access card, it gives staff access to any door within their clearance level. We keep certain doors locked to prevent patients from wandering while undergoing treatment. Surgery can be stressful, and sometimes patients get disoriented and start walking around. Our building is huge, full of winding halls and identical rooms. If someone has a medical emergency and they're not in the right room, we might not be able to reach them in time. Of course, you’re free to use the restroom that is attached to your room, and you can leave the facility at any time. Just let us know so someone can escort you safely. Any other questions?”

“Yeah, that makes sense. Actually, I do have another one… Where exactly does the liver come from? And why is it supposed to be better than the organs from other hospitals?” I didn't actually care for the answers, I just needed a distraction.

“The liver is actually grown from your own blood. When you were a child, your parents enrolled you in our plan. Unlike most hospitals that freeze blood and grow organs only when needed in a womb-like environment, we grow all vital organs immediately after receiving the sample. Maintaining them is extremely expensive, but there are benefits: your body accepts the organ as if it’s always been there.”

“What do you mean by accepting? Does the body try to refuse organs?’ I asked while slowly walking over to the empty jelly cup.

The doctor paused, “Yes, traditional organ transplant rejections are fairly common. The immune system doesn't recognize the organ and attacks it. Ours don’t have that risk, which is what sets us apart from other organ printing companies.

“But if they can freeze blood why don't you guys just freeze organs too? That way you can thaw them when needed”, I took the jelly cup’s aluminum seal off the table.

The surgeon smiled and said, “That is a great idea, blood cells frozen for many years could lead to DNA damage, so other companies run that risk. To reduce this risk, they split the blood into multiple vials since it doesn't take much blood to start the organ growing process. However, organs are much larger, and a lot more complex. Freezing and thawing will almost always result in the organ being damaged severely. Preserving it in a false body apparatus keeps the organ growing and healthy without the need of freezing.”

I was still a bit confused but I think I got the gist “Yeah, Yeah I guess that makes sense, one last thing if you don't mind, while i was in the bathroom the faucet wasn't working, could you please take a look at it”

The doctor hesitated. “Uh, sure… but I’m not exactly handy. If there’s a problem, I’ll call for assistance.” He set his clipboard on the table and walked into the restroom. The moment he left my view, I moved quickly and quietly to the door, stuffing the aluminum cover into the slot where the door lock would go into. “It seems to be working fine” I quickly went back to where I was standing, Dr Ross's voice becoming louder as he left the bathroom “if you have any more issues with the faucet, just press on the remote near your bedside and a nurse will be with you right away”

“Thank you so much, I really appreciate your help Dr Ross” I tried for a polite smile but it came off as condescending. His own smile faltered a bit “You're very welcome, I’m glad I could help. I’ll get everything ready for the procedure. Please, enjoy your stay.”

He left, and I was alone again.

Bored of endless scrolling through streaming services, I sat in silence, waiting for the coast to clear. Eventually, I decided it was safe to leave. I had to know what the source of that red light was, and what made that noise from inside the container. 

I got up and turned the door handle slowly, careful to not make noise. The hallways were just as empty as before, but without the nurse's rhythmic steps. I wandered through the repeating hallways, the only indication that I wasn't going in circles were the room number signs. While I was walking around trying to find the red room, a nurse walking backwards with an empty cart bumped into me. They were the nurses from before, I instantly noticed his ID card clipped onto his pants pocket, I could barely make out the name ‘Reginald’.

 “Oh! I’m so sorry...” He paused, his eyes fixed on my face, like he couldn’t quite understand what he was seeing.

It felt like he was scanning every inch of me. The taller nurse gave him a sharp nudge with the cart and let out a cough. The short nurse blinked in succession, then forced a smile.

“I’m so sorry, sir. Please return to your room and wait for your treatment.”

I know I’m not much to look at. I'm stricken with jaundice, skinny and sick, but you’d think a nurse would be used to it. The short nurse whispered something to the tall one, who nodded and took the cart while the other walked off in the direction they’d come from.

Curious, I followed him, keeping my distance. He kept glancing over his shoulder, failing at being inconspicuous. He picked up his pace. After a final turn, he reached the *Spare Room*, pulled out a keycard, scanned it, then entered a code into the keypad. He slipped inside.

Going in with him would be risky, so I thought if I hid and waited I could try to steal his badge discreetly. So I hid behind a corner watching the door and waiting. Only a few moments later the red light returned and immediately after the nurse walked out, sighing a breath of relief, but quickly looked up. A jolt of panic hit me—had he seen me? I desperately looked for a hiding place so I crouched behind a large plant in an alcove. I was surprised that I was small enough to fit. 

His footsteps were quick, they drew closer, growing louder until they suddenly slowed. I held my breath, praying he didn't notice me. His footsteps stopped entirely, but after a  few moments he muttered ‘get it together, man’. Then his footsteps continued, completely unaware that I was there. I knew that if I was  found, they'd tighten up security. Then I'd have no chance of knowing what was in that room. And I'd be mortified that I'd been found crouching half naked behind a plant like a lunatic. 

After a minute of silence, I sprinted to the door. Miraculously, the nurse left his card in the scanner, I looked over my shoulder to make sure no one was around, and reached for the door handle, but the closer my hand got to the metal handle, the colder the air around my fingers became, I hesitated for a moment, doubts crawling down my body like spiders, but curiosity pushed through, and I gently open the door. 

The room was very dark and freezing, each breath let out visible fog. It was mostly empty except for a blue-lit screen glowing softly on a podium in the center. Above me, rows upon rows of large glass chambers hung like meat hooks in a butcher shop.

I approached the screen. It asked for a patient's name or ID. I entered my name.

**Result found.**

I selected my profile. **Name:** Adam Jones **Age:** 35 **Sex:** Male

more data such as blood type, medical history, etc were listed. On the right side of the screen was a large green button: **SPARE**. I immediately pressed it.

A second profile appeared: **Spare – 7370617265** **Age:** 33 **Organs Available:** All green-listed, except one: **Liver – Unavailable**.

I felt something churn deep inside

Then I saw another button: **Retrieve**\-in bright yellow.

And I, of course, pressed it.

The glass chambers overhead started moving on tracks, clanking and shifting until one hovered above the center platform. Beneath it, a circular platform lit up white the chamber slowly descended, like a claw-machine lowering a fragile prize.

When the glass chambers stopped, I looked closely into it. A pair of white eyes stared back at me.

I froze. Terror became a dark oozing liquid, clinging to me. The figure had long brown hair, and wore a breathing mask with a tube covering most of his face. Wires coiled around his muscular frame suspended in fluid, curled in a fetal position.

Its gaze followed me no matter where I moved. Not alert, just instinctive. Infantile.

Whoever this was, I had to help him.

I pounded on the glass. Nothing. It was stronger than I expected. There had to be a way to open it.

“Hey, can you understand me?” I asked the man desperately, but he stayed silent. I stared at him hoping that he would show some sort of awareness, but the longer I looked the more familiar he became.

The hair color, the eyes, the face shape. I noticed two small moles on the man's curled hands. I quickly turned my wrist to look for my own two moles. For a moment I could not even fathom it. It was me.

I jerked my head back to the terminal. The yellow button was now red: **Drain and Extract**.

Before I could press it, I heard voices approaching. I ducked into a shadowed corner.

The two nurses stormed in, wheeling in the cart along with them, with the large red container from before.

“You idiot! How do you forget to pull your ID from the scanner?” the tall one hissed.

“I know, I know! But it was that guy’s fault… he got into my head, when I left the room I swear I thought I saw him again at the end of the hallway so quickly I ran to catch him but no one was there-”

The two froze when their eyes locked onto the tank.

“You forgot to PUT BACK THE SPARE?”

“I *did*! I swear! Th-there must’ve been ah-a glitch or something!” I couldn't tell if he was stuttering from the cold or from anxiety.

The tall nurse crossed his arms and took a deep breath, “You forgot your keycard and blamed it on a hallucination, then you didn't return the spare, and you expect me to believe there was a glitch?”, he finished, nearly shouting.

“Yes…  I know how this looks, but please don’t tell K-Karla. She’ll kill me. I swear this won’t happen again!”, he said pleadingly.

The tall one's anger dissipated, melting into sympathy. “Fine. The system automatically tells her when spares are retrieved but not by whom, I’ll say I retrieved the spare three times, I'll make up a dumb reason. But *you* tell her about bumping into the patient and the keycard.”

The short nurse nodded rapidly, eyes full of tears. The tall man pressed a button, returning the man in the chamber to its place.

The tall man sighed “alright, which one is next”, he said, his breath turning to fog in the freezing room.

The shorter nurse wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and pulled out a clipboard from the cart

The short nurse cleared his throat “uhh, Tammy Warren, ID number is 6579650d0a, female, 24, severe eye damage”

“Another one? There have been so many eye replacements recently, is there disease or something to worry about?” the tall man spoke as he typed on the screen, “It looks like one eye is already unavailable, is the patient sick?”

The capsules moved again, “No, I looked into it, almost 90% of the eyes we remove from patients have the same strange residue on them. It's caused by this new hallucinogenic on the market, ‘eye candy’. Apparently, because new organs are more accessible than ever, people have started experimenting with it. It causes extremely vivid hallucinations but almost always destroys the eyes. The worst part is, the people who get a transplant after wrecking their vision almost always relapse. But unlike necessary organs, eyes don't need to be put into the spares to acclimate." 

He finished speaking when a new capsule lowered. It contained a young asian girl, her hair black and shiny, swirling around her like a cocoon. The taller man shook his head, “Those damn junkies, you'd think having a second chance would stop them from self destruction, what if something happened to the meat fridges, has the thought never crossed their minds? They're taking their organs for granted.” he spat.

After a few moments of silent scribbling on the clipboard the taller nurse spoke again, “Alright get the cart ready, I'll drain and extract.” He tapped on the screen again, this time the whole room lit up deep red, like a photographer's dark room.

My stomach dropped. *They'll see me.*

The chamber drained of liquid, the girl descended slowly until her frail naked body met the floor. She laid there, motionless, as the chamber glass slid to the side, granting access to their ‘meat fridge’. The short nurse gave a button at the side of the cart a long press, lowering it until the top reached his ankle.

 “Aright,” he said, “like usual, I'll get the hands and you get the legs,” the taller man ordered. The shorter man stretched his back and bent down to pick up the girl’s legs and dropped them, “Damn.. sorry, She's slippery.” The taller man took a deep, steadying breath and patiently held onto her arms, used to his partner's incompetence. The shorter nurse grabbed a towel from the cart and wiped her legs dry. “Sorry”, he muttered again. The two men slowly picked her up and placed her gently into the red container.

There wasn’t even the faintest trace of resistance in the girl, she was more corpse than human. Just looking at her turned my stomach. I had to get out of there, and fast. 

The tall man walked back over to the computer and pressed the screen again. "Alright, which room?”

“Room 411”, the short nurse said, as the empty chamber ascended back into the rafters. The two nurses left, pulling the cart behind them.

The silence in the room was palpable. I rushed over to the screen and pulled up my clone’s profile one last time. My index finger quickly moved to the right side, but I hovered there, shaking, above the **Retrieve** button.

 They’d know it was retrieved a 4th time. Why risk it? What if I needed another organ like Tammy?

Yeah, I know how bad that sounds. I mean, I could get another organ grown, but what if it's my heart and they couldn't grow it fast enough, or what if my body rejects it?

I slowly looked up at the capsules, listening for even the slightest murmur for help, but the room was a silent graveyard. I could see faint eyes watching me from all around. A few had one eye. Even fewer had both.

These weren’t real people, I told myself. They were *storage*. If I opened the capsules, they’d probably just collapse helplessly too.

I held my hand reluctantly over the ‘x’ icon and closed my eyes… and pressed down.

Maybe someone else will help them. Walking out of that room, I’d convinced myself I couldn’t, that I wouldn't even know how. Now, 4 years later, I know that that was bullshit. I even knew it then, but I still walked away. I’m hoping that by writing this, and telling the world, that someone will see this and do what I couldn't. I couldn't help then, and I can’t help now. I can’t go back. I can’t face those lifeless eyes that I left behind. I still remember those eyes as I reach for another bottle.
