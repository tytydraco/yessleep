I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days? Weeks? Time doesn’t feel real anymore. I just keep walking. There’s nothing else I can do.

It started as a normal night. I had a fight with my girlfriend—not even a serious one, just one of those dumb arguments where both of you are too stubborn to back down. I needed air, so I grabbed my jacket and walked out. I didn’t know where I was going. I just wanted to **walk**.

At first, it felt good. The night was cool, the streets were empty, and the fresh air helped clear my head. I kept my hands in my pockets, my head down, just focusing on my steps. Left. Right. Left. Right.

Then, I started to notice something was… off.

Have you ever had that weird feeling when you’re walking and suddenly realize you don’t remember the last few minutes? Like your brain was on autopilot? That’s what happened to me. I looked up and realized I had **no idea where I was**.

The buildings looked… familiar, but wrong. The signs on the stores were **blurry**, like I couldn’t focus on them no matter how hard I tried. The streetlights cast the same dull orange glow, stretching my shadow long and thin across the pavement. No cars. No people. Just me.

I pulled out my phone. **No signal.** No Wi-Fi. Just **“Emergency Calls Only.”**

That was the first time I felt truly afraid.

I turned around, planning to walk back the way I came. But the road… **looked the same in both directions.** I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe my brain was messing with me.

Then I saw the **gas station**.

I swear it wasn’t there before.

The neon sign flickered weakly, casting a sickly glow onto the pavement. Through the grimy glass, I could see rows of snacks, drinks in refrigerators, even a few tables near the window. But no people.

Still, the **radio was playing**.

A soft, old tune mixed with static, like a song from a past you barely remember. It felt wrong, but at the same time, **familiar**.

I stepped inside. The door creaked shut behind me. No bell. No greeting. Just the low hum of the fluorescent lights and the crackle of the radio.

I walked past the shelves, scanning the aisles. Chips, candy, bottled water. All normal. Except… **the labels were smudged**, unreadable. My eyes kept trying to focus, but the words refused to make sense.

And then…

**The radio stopped.**

No static. No music. Just **absolute silence**.

That’s when I noticed them.

Outside, on the road—**figures were walking past the gas station**.

They all faced away from me. Their heads bowed slightly, their steps **perfectly synchronized**. I counted five at first. Then eight. Then twelve. Their numbers kept shifting, as if my eyes couldn’t quite track them.

Then, **one of them stopped**.

It tilted its head, as if listening.

I don’t know why, but I felt it in my bones: **I couldn’t make a sound.**

Another figure stopped. Then another. One by one, **they began to turn.**

I ran.

I didn’t think—I just bolted. Past the shelves, through the door, back onto the empty road. My legs burned. My breath came in ragged gasps. But the road stretched endlessly ahead of me. **No turns. No signs. Just more road.**

Then I saw it.

Another gas station.

**The same gas station.**

I don’t know how long I’ve been running. I don’t know how far I’ve gone. But every time I think I’ve escaped, I end up back here. The figures are still walking. They don’t chase me. But I know—**if I stop, if I stay too long… they will reach me.**

If you’re reading this, please—**don’t walk too far.**

Because you might never find your way back.
