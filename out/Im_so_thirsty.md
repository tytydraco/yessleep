I'm so thirsty. I just woke up. I don't know why im writing this, it just feels like I should. Im so thirsty. I checked the kitchen just now. The sinks not working. Funny. It was working a couple hours ago before I went to sleep. I want to go back to sleep, im so tired...but I cant... im so thirsty. I need water. Heres where it gets weird though. You see I checked the fridge, looking for some soda or anything to drink. God my throat feels like sandpaper typing this out. But the sodas I could see them there in my fridge, or at least what was left of them. They were still sealed, but there was nothing left only some weird looking powder in the bottom of each bottle. This is getting crazy my ice machine isn't working either. Why me, why does this all have to happen right now. Im so thirsty. I need water.  

Im going downstairs, I hear some noise outside but it'll be fine. there's a gas station right next door. I know the clerk, a friendly older man named Patel. I'll just hop in grab some water and be right back inside after. I just need something to drink. 

There was no water. There is no water here. Patel is dead. There is no water. They were drinking him. I recognized the boy. He lives across the street, I see him as he goes off to school sometimes. He was eating Patels throat. The other I didn't recognize, an older woman, I'd say she was in her late 80s if not for the way she moved. She had Patel pinned against the counter. Patel was bent over the counter at a right degree angle, the two fiends crouching over his top half on the counter... drinking... oh god I'm so thirsty. I cant think straight, I can't remember. There was nothing on the shelves, right I checked the shelves while they were fiesting. All the bottles empty. Even the water bottles. All completely gone. Only plastic trash remained. I ran. I need water, something anything. The ocean its not too far away from where I live. It's just down the hill. Why do I feel so bad. Im running. Just any water anything to drink. I don't care if its saltwater. I just need something please anything. I'm running. I'm almost there. I can see other people running with me. They look so... thirsty. We're running. We can see the sand. Im so thirsty just a few more steps. 

Before me lay only sand. Not even a single fish or sea plant remained. All that remained were desolate broken ships. Not a single drop of water anywhere. Not even a cloud in the sky. Im so thirsty. I'm looking at some of the others here now. I don't recognize anyone anymore. I can't concentrate on their faces. The thirst is spreading. It's becoming more, somehow far worse. It is an unrelenting craving. I look at the person closest to me. A girl, probably about my age.... I could take them...There is one last place where I know I can get something to drink. She will understand. I'm so thirsty.
