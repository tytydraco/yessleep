My parents wouldn’t take their eyes off me for days, and the closer it got to Christmas the more freaked out I got. I didn’t even have Rosie’s notebook! Greg had been reading it when I went to burn down the tree. I had no phone. My dad blocked all social media on our router. All I could do was hang out with my sister and be ‘festive’. At least, that’s what they thought. I did have my computer. I was supposed to do some school project during winter break, but I spent the time doing more research. I used a VPN to email anything I found to my friends. 

I started to dig into the newspaper again. Rosie had said that the town hated her for closing up their fireplace, and that an ordinance had been put in place against it. She was right. The newspaper published minutes from the town meetings. Several families had closed up their fireplaces after the Walsh’s had. It was a big fucking deal at the time. Even worse, in 1992, the town had an economic collapse. The mill shut down, and several families lost their jobs. In 1993 the mayor decreed that a working fireplace was required for all new houses, and that any changes to existing fireplaces and their chimneys was a violation of the town’s ‘heritage status’. The town even offered free renovations for anyone willing to open their chimneys again. 

More insidious than that, was when the town started a campaign to have new families move to the area. The mayor had hired some big city design firm to handle it. 

If we were right, someone had made a deal ages ago for the success of the town. The rules were pretty simple, and the consequences severe. When I looked up obituaries from Christmas 1991, there weren’t any. So the ‘fae’, or whatever they are, never got their sacrifice that year. That mill never reopened. Ever. To this day the building is abandoned. Kids don’t even go out there to drink. It was no wonder the mayor went all out to try and fix it.

When I finally got my phone back we were just a couple days away from Christmas Eve. Ella convinced my parents to let me go over to her house, using her father’s status as a police officer as part of her ‘good influence’ strategy. It worked. My dad dropped me off at her house and after an awkward hello with her parents, Ella dragged me down to the basement. 

“So what’s the plan?” I asked once the door shut behind us. I was itching to finalize our attack strategy. 

“Last supper!”

I looked around. Greg and Max were already there, waving from the couch. In front of them were a stack of pizzas, and a PS4 hooked up to the TV. Ella saw the look on my face and elbowed me, nudging me down the stairs. I sat down, looking around and wondering why it felt so casual.

“Drink up!” she announced, plunking down a case of pop on the table. 

“Uhh… Ella? Can’t we just, pour it out?” Greg asked, staring at bottle after bottle of coke. It was all glass bottles, and there were a lot. 

“I said drink!” she ordered, grabbing one and opening it. We all quickly followed her lead. After I got a slice of pizza in hand, Greg opened up the notebook and spread out a map of the city. He pointed at the town square. A tiny drawing of a tree had been added in green marker. 

“That tree? That’s their totem. Or something. We think it’s connected to the other tree in the circle. It’s like a gateway that lets the spiders come through.” 

Ella sat there chugging an entire bottle of coke before wiping her mouth and grabbing a bucket of rags and tossing it in the middle of the table. “The tree didn’t burn right? It’s probably protected by some kind of magic. So we take out the spiders instead. They’re like the worker bees. They have to be weak once they’re outside of the nest. We lure them in here,” she tapped the map with some scissors before starting to cut the rags into strips. 

“The Smiths house?” I asked, realizing where they’d marked the next spot.

“It’s empty. No one’s rented it yet. I can get the keys off the realtor lockbox! Max is gonna set up his sound system inside. Those things go after anyone awake, right? In nature, spiders use vibration to hunt. That’s gotta be how those things know who’s awake! So we lure them in. We gas the house. We light it on fire. Boom. Dead spiders!”

I sat back and ate, thinking about the possibility of it all working. I was thinking about what would happen to our little town. The last time no one was taken, the mill shut down. It destroyed lives. I’m not stupid. I listen when my dad watches the news. The world economy kind of sucks right now. A lot of people would kill to be in our situation. We were basically dooming everyone in our town if we did this. 

“If we do this, our lives are never going to be the same. Our parents will all probably lose their jobs.” 

“I know,” Ella said after a moment of silence. She sat back and looked around at the trophies that dotted the walls. “I’m probably going to lose my scholarship.” She’d already been pre-accepted to a university on a sports scholarship that frankly, she had never even applied to. My dad’s radio repair shop wouldn’t survive. Max was already planning to blow up thousands of dollars in speakers.

Max shrugged, opening another bottle of pop. “But like, it’s not like it’s ours, right? It’s fake. It’s always been fake.” Greg nodded his agreement, looking equally solemn. We all felt the weight of what we were about to do. 

“We tried to go talk to the Millers. It didn’t work. They called the cops on us. Something about ‘hazing’. But when we were there, we saw their kids. They’re all like, under six. What if one of the kids is taken? Or the parents, and then whoever’s left has to look after three kids? Is my scholarship worth someone’s life?” Ella shook her head. “I thought about it. It’s all just… bribes. Everything we have is bribes so we look away. I don’t wanna look away anymore. Whoever we’re feeding needs to go hungry.” 

I grabbed another bottle of pop, and picked up a rag and some scissors. Ella was right. Rosie was right. I had been right. We had to do this. “By the way what’s all this for?” I asked, wondering why we were cutting up scraps and guzzling coke. 

“Molotovs!” Greg answered with a grin.

Christmas Eve came, and that’s when I posted the first part of our story. I hit submit and then packed my backpack full of everything I’d need for the night. Then I sat down to wait. It was probably the worst I’ve ever felt on a Christmas Eve. Every step in the same weird ritual my family does every year put me closer to the big event, and I had to pretend to enjoy it. My parents were already edgy. So were my friends’ parents after the harassment episode with the Millers. We all had to play it cool. So I choked down dinner. Put on this year’s pajamas (candy cane reindeer, if you’re wondering), and sat down to everyone’s *favourite* movie. Then at quarter past eight, we all took our ‘magic pills’, and just like last year, I saved mine to spit in the toilet. I went to bed, my jeans riding up under the pajamas. When I finally heard snoring, I checked my parents’ and sister’s rooms before taking off my pj’s and grabbing my bag. Then I booked it, only pausing just for a moment to stick a couple of those fire pokers straight up the chimney. 

The first thing I did was steal the key from the realtor box on the Smiths’ house. We’d already dropped off all of Max’s equipment and set it up. We set up the speakers, lugged in jugs of gasoline, and set up whatever traps we could. Half the house was a death trap by Christmas Eve. One wrong step and you were liable to have a bucket of knives drop down on you. There were even ball-bearings set to explode from corners. We really didn’t want to take any chances when it came to killing the spiders. 

Max got there first, getting to work on finishing any wiring and starting the process of stringing the extensions across the street to my house. Greg and Ella followed after. They brought the fire, lugging in a cooler filled with Molotov’s just ready to light. Ella had her baseball bat, and Greg, well Greg… 

“What’s that?” I asked, staring at the thing he had strapped to his back. 

“My dad’s nail gun!” Greg beamed, whipping it around so I could take a better look at it. “Fairies don’t like iron, right? I got the cheapest nails I could find. I made sure they got all rusty too.” It sounded like a good idea, at least.

Next we tested the sound system, Max operating things from across the street in my living room. Somehow I picked the short straw and had to stand in the house, walkie in hand. 

“Okay, get ready!” 

Guys. I fucking hit the deck. It sounded like a gunshot right next to me. I swear the whole house rattled off its frame when the music hit.

“Nope, sounds crackly!” the walkie gargled out.

Crackly?! I crawled to my feet and watched as Max scampered across the snow to tweak a little something in the speakers. “What the hell was that?!”

“My super mix! I worked on this for days!” After Max was happy, we drenched the house in gasoline, scarves over our mouths as the stench filled the air and made us all lightheaded. 

Then we waited. Went back to my house, checked the time, and sat around waiting. Ella laughed at the people calling me out for hating It’s a Wonderful Life. We all agreed we wished the military would get involved. Then we just sort of settled down in the grim silence, listening. It took another hour before the first signs of life appeared. Ella noticed it first, pointing out the window and peering down the street. The first of the creatures were making their way to the rooftops on our street. I live just a few blocks away from the town square, so we figured they would hit my block early. The Millers lived way farther out. If we could lure them all in before they even got out there, then no one would have to die at the Millers.

We held out for a few painful minutes, watching the spiders file across the roofs. They went in groups of three, just like Rosie said. It was terrifying, and although I’d seen them before, it was the expressions reflected on the faces of my friends that just added to my fear. I think they were all still hoping that I was crazy. I was too. Deep inside me I hoped that we’d all just sort of made this up.

“Max,” Greg whispered while we all sat there in slack jawed awe. “Max, now!” he hissed, and Max suddenly came to life, stuttering a little as he moved to his controls. A couple dials turned and a finger on the start button, and the Smiths house came to life. It was crazy. The whole town was dead silent except for us. I was amazed the windows didn’t break it was so loud. 

I sat there holding my breath as the bass vibrated the whole block. For a moment the spiders didn’t seem to notice anything. They dropped into chimneys like usual. Then suddenly, it was like the reverberations hit. Like one mass migration they all started to move. Have you ever seen those horrible videos of someone poking a daddy long-legs nest? It was like that, only red. 

“It’s working!” 

They were all hopping down the chimney, almost fighting each other to be first. Creature after creature poured into the house. “Ella you’re up,” Max said, passing her a bottle and a lighter. “Greatest pitcher in the province, right?” She nodded, lighting up the homemade Molotov and then sneaking out the front door. By now the house had to be bursting, we couldn’t see any spiders outside of it. She threw the bottle with all she had and it smashed through the front room window. We’d soaked the place with so much gasoline and kindling that the place went up like a match. We stood outside my house, listening to Max’s music mix at concert volume and watching spiders trying to escape the trap. We could hear explosions going off from inside the house. 

For a moment, we stood there and cheered. It felt like we’d beaten whatever fucked up enemy we were battling. The spiders that crawled out of the place collapsed and fizzled beneath the flames. The tree might not have been flammable, but they sure were. Just as we started to debate on how we were going to explain the mess, Ella smacked me hard in the chest again. 

“Look!” she yelped. There were more spiders coming. Fresh spiders. New spiders. Pouring out of the town square and coming straight for us. “RUN!” 

We dove into Max’s truck, and he peeled away on the frosty road, driving blindly in the opposite direction. “Where do we go?!” he shouted. 

“Rosie’s house!” I yelled back, staring out the back window at the red wave crawling after us. “FASTER!” They were way faster than you’d expect a four legged spider to be. 

“Oh God, Oh God, ohgodohgodohgod,” Greg chanted, head in his hands. We drove as fast as we could, grateful that the rest of the town seemed to be asleep. 

“What if she’s not up?!” Ella cried. 

“She’s awake!” She had to be. There was no doubt in my mind that Rosie was awake. 

We just about took her fence off when we pulled up in front of her house. Max running up to the door and banging on it frantically while Ella, Greg and I tried to drag our things out of his truck. “GET THE COOLER!” she shrieked, and we all started screaming and hollering for Rosie to let us in. 

It was like time stood still for a second. An ocean of furious creatures were closing in on us from one side, and the only safe place we knew was closed just inches from our faces.

“ROSIE! Jesus someone look for a fake rock!” 

Max was whipping apart her garden when the door finally opened and one Rosalee Walsh looked at us like we were dancing heads. “What in God’s name are you kids doing here?” she cried, then stopped, peeked past us, and started hauling us inside. She slammed the door behind us, locking every lock and chain she had on it, then bracing it. We got inside just in time. It was like a storm hit her house. The sound of dozens of spiders landing on it at once sounding like an avalanche of hail. 

“Idiots! You idiots! What did you do?!” she cried. 

“Uhh.” We stood there, listening to what sounded like hundreds of angry reindeer on the roof. “We thought we’d kill the spiders.” 

Rosie wrapped her robe tighter around her body, staring at the ceiling. Then she looked slowly at each of us. Max let out an awkward laugh and Greg just ran for the bathroom. The woman closed her eyes, shaking her head as the sounds of scratching started in the chimney. “Damn stupid fucking kids,” she muttered. 

“Are we going to die?” asked Max. 

“Only if you talk too much,” she spat, going to a cabinet in the living room. “I don’t know if this house can withstand all of them.” She opened the cabinet, revealing an armory of guns. “You kids know how to shoot? Take a weapon. And you better start praying. I’ve never seen this before. Should’ve known though when you came botherin’ me. Welp. Nows as good a time as any to take a stand.” She passed out guns, then went to her bedroom for her shotgun. “Just sit tight and-“ 

The sound of smashing glass silenced all of us. Greg’s screams followed and we all ran out from the living room. We found Rosie standing in the hallway, staring at the remains of a small boarded up window in the bathroom. Glass shards and splatters of blood laid on the floor. “The bars fell off a few years ago,” she whispered, sounding haunted. “Couldn’t get someone out to fix it.” 

We were all in shock, and so was she. But the sounds of Greg’s screaming snapped us out of it. “Not again!” she shouted suddenly, and moved faster than I honestly expected a woman in her eighties could. Before we could even help her she’d pried down the steps to the attic and was making her way up. “GET THE BUCKET!” she ordered, and Ella looked around, spotting a heavy Home Depot bucket in the hall and grabbing it. She carried it after Rosie while Max and I carried the cooler of Molotov’s. 

We reached the roof just as Rosie had fired off her first shot, clipping a spider in the leg. Greg was already a house away, being dragged by a group of them across the snow and Christmas lights.

“That’s right you nasty little pieces of shit!” Rosie cried, ripping the top off the bucket. It was filled with bullets. “You’re not taking any more on my watch! Come and get it!” 

Ella shoved the gun she’d taken into my hands and opened the cooler. “Max, start lighting!” she shouted, then took the first Molotov and tossed it as hard as she could. It hit one of the spiders carrying Greg square in the body. The screech it let out burned my ears. But it dropped him. The others struggled to balance his weight and Greg rolled off the roof into the bushes below. Suddenly, it was all out war.

I can’t really say how long we were up on that roof. It felt like hours, maybe days, but with how late it was, I think it wasn’t that long at all. Usually I wasn’t so much as a bug squasher, but that night it was all I could do to keep firing off shots. It felt like they were never ending. Luckily they were incredibly fragile. Ella rained down literal fire behind Greg as he made his way to safety, and the rest of us kept the spiders at bay on the roof. There were close calls. We all have weird scars that I don’t think will ever go away. But we made it. 

The battle ended just as fast as it seemed to start. One minute we were watching those strange four legged nightmares curling up into balls and falling to the ground, and the next, they all seemed to just crumble away. We were all stunned. The onslaught had just kept coming, wave after wave, and now they were dust in the wind.

“What time is it?” Rosie asked, and I fumbled for my phone. 

“Twelve o’ one,” I answered, then really thought about that. It was after midnight. Technically, it was Christmas morning now. “Are they gone?” We all hesitated, looking around at our quiet town, before putting down our weapons. Rosie just shook her head, suddenly looking drained, and stepped back into the attic. For a moment I felt a burst of exhausted excitement bubble up inside me. I could tell my friends felt it too. Max let out a small, soft ‘woo’ and pumped his fist while Ella punched me in the arm. 

We grabbed the last of our supplies and made our way down through Rosie’s house, talking the whole way. It was that nervous, excited chatter you did when something big had just happened. We were all tired. It was late. We still had so much to clean up. But we had defeated the spiders, and from the way they came at us, I doubted they had managed to divert any resources to stealing someone. It felt like we had actually managed to protect the town.

Downstairs Ella was putting the bucket back where she found it and helping Max to put the guns away, all while telling Rosie about how badass she was. We were gibbering at the woman all at once. At least until Ella made a noise that I didn’t like. I looked over at her, crouched beside Rosie’s recliner. “I think she’s dead,” she whispered, fingers to her neck. We all rushed over to check. We felt for a pulse, put Ella’s compact beneath her nose, and tried CPR. But she was gone. 

“Maybe she had a heart attack,” Max suggested as we all wiped away tears. “What do we do?” I grabbed the afghan off the back of her chair and wrapped it around her. Then I set her favourite gun in that magazine pouch, just as she always had it. We cleaned up the glass and made sure the attic was locked, then we picked up her phone and dialed 911. No one would be coming anytime soon, but we had to hope that the call would be logged somewhere and it would happen.

I made sure we grabbed Rosie’s box of stuff before we left. Rosie had spent most of her life battling the nightmare that plagued our town. I didn’t want all her efforts to disappear. We’d inherited it now, after all.

It might have been Christmas morning, but it was so early that everyone but us was still asleep. After the battle we’d just had, it was amazingly peaceful to just walk down the street knowing we had the whole place to ourselves. Of course, the first place we went was to see the tree in town square. I couldn’t help but feel nervous walking up. We hadn’t directly seen it but were pretty sure the spiders had come from the tree. So when we walked up and saw the formerly green tree had turned brown, we were elated. The tree looked like the crappy trees people threw out at the end of the season. Ornaments had started to fall off. Even as we stood there a few baubles hit the ground and broke. 

We also noticed we couldn’t hear Max’s music mix playing anymore and made our way back to my house. The one thing I’m thankful for is that it snowed incredibly heavily. We always have snow on Christmas, but the weather this year was crazy. With how overboard we went on the gasoline, we were lucky that the weather was so bad that the massive fire at the Smiths house didn’t spread. Instead it was one big black smoky smouldering mass when we returned. We cleaned up the cables still connected to my house, shoved Max’s leftover equipment into his truck, and then said goodbye. Max took Greg and Ella home, and I went upstairs to sleep.

This year I woke up on Christmas feeling happy. When I looked outside at the Smiths house I felt relieved. I played the ‘what did Santa bring us’ game with my sister and watched her dive into her presents while our parents stood at the window, frozen, staring outside at the mess across the street. It didn’t take long for the gossip train to run and as we were eating this year’s slightly burned feast of cinnamon buns and eggs benedict, my mother sat there in shock listening to one of her friends talk about the tree going brown. I heard my parents talking about it in hushed whispers, and for once, the local police actually came to visit the house across the street.

It’s been a few days since Christmas Eve. I’ve slept a lot, trying to use up what winter vacation I have left to catch up on a year of bad sleep. I’ve made notes of my own in Rosie’s notebook, organized the box, and wrote out everything you saw here. Ella checked on Rosie’s place and said a neighbour told her that the paramedics came and broke down the door. We expect to see her kids coming into town any day now. As for the town itself… things are strange. People panicked when they saw the tree went brown. I mean full-scale, weeping in public, panic. The mayor’s office tried to declare a state of emergency but when pushed for why had to roll it back. Yesterday my mother received a call canceling this year’s New Year’s Eve party flower order. Budget cuts. 

Honestly, I wish I could say that I feel like this is the end, but Greg made a really good point when we talked after Christmas. There’s still one tree standing back at Raully’s Tree Farm. I think we’re going to have to find a way to destroy it. I just don’t know when, or how. Plus, I’m certain we’ve pissed something off. Something, or someone, on the other side of that circle, is going hungry this year. For now though, I’m just going to stay home and sleep. I don’t think I can deal with anymore crazy spiders this year.
