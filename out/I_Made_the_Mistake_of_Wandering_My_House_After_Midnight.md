You don’t notice how quiet things are until it’s too late.

When we first moved into this neighborhood, I didn’t think twice about the perfect lawns, the identical houses, or the stillness that hung in the air. Everyone was so polite—almost unnervingly so—but that was normal, right? At least, that’s what I told myself.

But now? I can’t stop hearing the hum of the engines. They come at 3 AM, like clockwork. And if you’re still awake, still *alive*, you’ll know they’re coming for you.

I made the mistake of wandering my house after midnight. I thought I was safe. After all, I’d just moved in. I didn’t know the rules. I didn’t know what happened if you broke them.

And that’s how I found out. That’s how they found me.

The house was perfect. Too perfect. I moved into a seemingly idyllic neighborhood, just like in the brochures. The kind of place where every house looked identical, with neat lawns and white picket fences. It felt like something out of a dream—or maybe a nightmare.

My first afternoon, I decided to take a walk around the block to stretch my legs. It was a quiet street, the kind of silence that felt too thick, too *intentional*. As I passed a few houses, I noticed something odd: every window was either shut tight or covered with heavy curtains, as if no one wanted to be seen.

Then I met **Tom**.

He waved from his porch, a welcoming gesture that almost felt rehearsed. He was an older man, with a scruffy beard and a knowing smile. He didn’t have the kind of smile that made you feel *comfortable*, though. It was more like a smile you give someone when you’ve seen too much, when you know something they don’t.

“Hey there!” he called out. “You’re new around here, huh? Don’t worry, you’ll get used to the place. It’s quiet, peaceful... if you follow the rules.”

I smiled back, unsure of how to respond. “Thanks, yeah. Everything seems nice so far.”

“Nice is one way to put it.” Tom’s grin lingered a little too long, and he leaned in, lowering his voice. “But... after 3 AM? You won’t see anyone out. People here stay inside. The patrol doesn’t like it when you break the curfew.”

“Patrol?” I raised an eyebrow. “What, like the police?”

Tom’s eyes flickered, just for a second, like he’d said too much. “No. Not like that. Just... the patrol. They keep things... in order. It’s better not to test them.” He chuckled, but the laugh felt strained, almost like he was trying to cover something up.

I nodded, uncomfortable. “Right. I’ll keep that in mind.”

Tom gave me one last look, his expression unreadable. “Good. You’ll learn. Just... stay inside when the clock strikes 3.”

I turned away quickly, the hairs on the back of my neck prickling. The conversation had felt too pointed, like he was trying to warn me without saying too much.

**Day 3:**

I couldn't stop thinking about what Tom had said. The patrol. The idea that some kind of enforcement existed that made people stay inside was unsettling in itself, but the more I thought about it, the more the whole town felt like it was *suffocating* under its own skin.

The silence here wasn’t just a lack of noise—it was an absence. It felt like the town was holding its breath, like everything was waiting for something, *someone* to make a wrong move. And that thought gnawed at me, the anxiety slowly building as I settled into this quiet, rigid routine.

The first strange thing happened on the third night. I woke up at 2:45 AM, my body alert for no reason at all. There was nothing in particular that had woken me up, but I could feel the weight of the house’s silence pressing in on me.

I went to the window, thinking maybe it was just the sound of wind or an animal. But outside, everything was still. The streetlights were too bright, casting long shadows on the empty sidewalks.

Then, I heard the engines.

At first, it was just a distant hum, but it grew louder—closer. My heart skipped a beat. I pressed my face to the glass, straining to see what was happening.

A convoy—three black SUVs, all identical, gliding past my house. The engines were eerily quiet for vehicles of that size, the only sound coming from the tires rolling across the asphalt. The headlights didn’t illuminate anything in their path, but the SUVs cast an unsettling, almost *unnatural* glow. The convoy moved in perfect synchronization, like they were searching for something... or someone.

I didn’t know what to make of it. The cars didn’t stop. They just kept going, disappearing into the night.

But the hairs on my arms didn’t lie. I knew they weren’t just passing by.

**Day 5:**

I started to notice the patterns. The town was quiet *during the day*—too quiet. But at night? It became unbearable. People didn’t walk the streets, didn’t linger outside. They simply... disappeared indoors, as though the town itself was closing in on them, forcing them to retreat.

One afternoon, I ran into Tom again. He was standing on his porch, staring out at the street like he was waiting for something. When he saw me, his eyes flickered with that familiar look, the one I couldn’t quite place.

“You seen the patrol yet?” he asked, almost too casually.

“Yeah,” I said, still unsure about what was happening here. “I saw them last night.”

Tom’s smile was tight. “Good. You’re starting to understand. You’ll see more of them if you’re... out of line.” His eyes darted toward the street, then back at me. “Better to stay inside, trust me. That’s how it goes here. Everyone’s got their place.”

I blinked, uneasy. “What do you mean, ‘their place’?”

He sighed, a soft, almost wistful sound. “The patrol... they don’t take kindly to those who stray. It’s a *necessary* thing. Keeps us all safe.”

But his eyes—his eyes told a different story. They weren’t just warning me. They were *pleading* with me to stay in line, to keep my distance from whatever lay just beneath the surface.

I felt the weight of his words hanging in the air, suffocating the space between us. “Right. Thanks for the heads-up.”

**Day 7:**

The unease only grew. I couldn’t shake the feeling that *something* was wrong, that the town was *too perfect*, its routine too rigid. The windows were always shut tight, the doors locked, and the people—when I did see them—acted like they were in a trance. Their eyes were always too hollow, too guarded, as if they’d seen things they couldn’t speak of. Things that weren’t meant to be understood.

And then, I found the records.

Old newspaper clippings, buried in the library’s dusty archives. The town’s history was *blank*—no real stories before the 1940s, just a few vague mentions of a prosperous settlement that suddenly appeared in the late 1800s. But in the margins, scrawled in faded ink, was a single line that made my stomach drop:

**“The Patrol is an offering to the ones who walk in shadows. The price is paid, year after year.”**

The words felt like a slap in the face. Offering? What did that mean? I couldn’t understand it. The more I searched, the more I realized how carefully the town had hidden its past, like a wound buried under layers of lies.

But what *really* disturbed me was the pattern in the clippings: every few years, someone went missing after curfew. A pattern that no one spoke of aloud but everyone seemed to *know*.

**The Day I Broke the Rule:**

I should have left. I *knew* I should have left.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the strange history of the town, the clippings I’d found, the things Tom had hinted at. I needed to understand. I needed to see if the patrol was real—if they were *really* just protecting the town, or something more sinister.

At 2:45 AM, I slipped out of bed, heart racing in anticipation and dread. I crept down the hallway, each step feeling like a violation, like I was walking further away from safety.

I reached the window, heart in my throat. There they were—three black SUVs, parked just outside my house. The engines hummed softly, like a heartbeat. A synchronized, mechanical rhythm. I pressed my forehead to the glass, watching the lights flicker across the street.

Then, a knock.

At first, I thought it was a mistake, a stray sound. But then it came again—*louder*, more insistent.

I turned to the door, my breath catching in my throat. It was happening.

Before I could react, the door opened by itself. There, standing in the doorway, was Tom.

But he wasn’t the man I’d met a week ago. His face was hollow, his smile stretched too wide. And behind him, the convoy soldiers had appeared—silent, methodical, and terrifying.

“You didn’t listen,” Tom said, his voice barely above a whisper. His eyes were too cold now, as if he’d known the end had come. “None of us ever do.”

I tried to move, but my legs were frozen. The world outside had gone dark, and all I could hear was the buzz of the convoy engines.

And then the door slammed shut behind me, locking me inside.

**Day 10:**

I don't know how long I've been here.

The days blur together. I try to remember the faces, the names, the things I once knew. But everything is fading—like a memory lost in time.

I don’t know if I’m still alive. Or if I’m part of them now.

But the patrol... they’re always watching. Always waiting. I can feel it in the air. And when the clock strikes 3 AM, I know what happens next. I can't get caught again.
