“Come on, Moose,” I called to my dog who wandered a bit too far off the path. He loves this cemetery. There are all kinds of smells for him to investigate. I love it because it’s paved and an easy walk. 

Moose trotted over to me and looked up expectantly, wanting a quick scratch behind the ears before continuing down the path. I knelt down and rubbed ears before planting a kiss on his nose. Just then, a deep roll of thunder sounded overhead. I glanced up and noticed a storm was coming in fast. I snapped Moose’s leash onto his collar and picked up the pace a little. It was just after 6:00, but the dark storm clouds made it seem almost night. Hmm, I wish I had checked the radar before we left the house.

We finished up our walk quickly, heading down to the large iron entrance gate. As we rounded the corner, the gates looked to be closed. Weird, I thought, they don’t usually lock up until after nightfall. The groundskeeper must have wanted to beat the storm home. 

We walked up to the gates and my heart sank as I realized there was a large padlock across the front. Great, I thought, we just got locked inside a cemetery. I glanced around and didn’t see any other gates. This was the only entrance into the property that I knew of. I dropped Moose’s leash and dug my phone out of my backpack.

“You think this is considered a 911 type of emergency?” I asked Moose aloud. Just then, a large bolt of lightning streaked across the sky. “I guess it is when you’re about to get hit by lightning,” I said again aloud, and punched 911 into my phone. 

A dispatcher picked up almost immediately. “911, what is your emergency?” a voice said.

“Hi,” I started, suddenly feeling nervous. “I’m so sorry, this probably isn’t exactly a 911 emergency. I was walking my dog in the cemetery but apparently they locked up early tonight. We are locked inside.”

“Okay ma’am, we will get someone out there to unlock it for you. Which cemetery are you in?” he asked me. 

“I’m at the one that Avenue J dead-ends into,” I told the dispatcher.

“Um, hold on one moment ma’am,” the dispatcher replied. I could hear him clicking away at a keyboard. “You said Avenue J? There is no open cemetery on that end of town, ma’am.”

“No, I walk here almost every night. It’s the–” I looked up to read the large metal letters protruding from the top of the gate, “Oak Hill Cemetery. The sign is on the gate.”

“Oak Hill Cemetery…” I could hear him murmur. “Oak Hill Cemetery is not open to the public, ma’am. I don’t know how you would have gotten inside there. What is your name, please?”

I didn’t have time to process what the dispatcher was telling me. The lightning was sprawling across the sky and Moose was starting to get nervous. “It’s Alison Land, and I’m positive I am in Oak Hill Cemetery. I am looking at the sign right now.” Another crack of lightning burst across the sky. My heart raced. “The storm is about to hit. It’s lighting really badly. I am in the Oak Hill Cemetery,” I repeated. 

“Okay Alison. You’re positive you’re in Oak Ridge right now? The Oak Hill Cemetery is not open to the public. Also… it’s not storming outside,” he said. 

“What is going on right now? Did I dial the wrong number, is this a prank?” I asked, pulling the phone away from my ear to check that I actually dialed 911. Moose was cowering from the thunder in between my legs. I led us underneath a tree right as the rain started. “It just started pouring down rain. Can you please get me out of here?” I asked, starting to get worried.

“Okay Alison, we are going to figure out what’s going on. You said it’s storming right now? What time did you leave to go on your walk?”

“I left at 5:15. It’s only a 2 minute walk from my house. I live right down the street on Avenue J.” 

“Alison, I need you to listen to me. There is no publicly open cemetery on Avenue J in Oak Ridge. I need to figure out where you actually are so I can get you some help. Can you see out the gate? Do you see any identifying landmarks around?” the dispatcher asked me. 

“I don’t understand-” I started to argue back, but the line clicked. My phone went completely dead. Did I forget to charge it? Did I lose service? This couldn’t be happening to me. I ran back to the gate in the pouring rain, reached through the bars, and tugged on the lock. It was fastened in, not budging. I looked up and down the fence line but there were no other gates or openings. Moose was still cowering under the tree, whimpering. He hated storms. 

“Don’t worry Moosie,” I called over to him. “We’ll get out of here!” I remembered that an old cemetery office building was located right around the corner of the path. It was used as a storage shed these days, but maybe a door or window would be unlocked. “Come on, Moose!” I called, turning to jog down the path. He followed, hunkering down low, almost crawling after me. The building came into sight just where I remembered it being, nestled against the fence behind several rows of graves. I tried to avoid stepping on any directly as I wound my way through. Moose followed right behind, not bothering to be careful where his paws tread.

The building had a large awning over the front door. I stood underneath it and began trying to wring out my clothing a bit. Moose shook his whole body, splattering water and mud all over myself and the front door. “Ugh, thanks,” I muttered.

I turned and tried the door. I didn’t really think it would be unlocked; it was just a last-ditch effort to get out of the storm. But, to my surprise, the handle twisted and the door budged slightly. I pushed into it. There was something blocking it on the other side, but I eventually managed to push it open wide enough for us both to slip inside. 

It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the dingy light. This room must have been the front office at one point, but was now piled with clutter and old furniture. I spotted a light switch next to the door I had just pushed through, and one of the four bulbs were still working in the lamp overhead. It flickered slightly and didn’t provide much light, but enough for me to scan the room. There was a desk shoved up in the corner with a really old desktop and a landline sitting amongst other clutter. I made my way across the room to test the phone. I plugged it into the wall and picked up the receiver, sighing with relief when the familiar buzzing sound rang through the headset. I dialed my mom’s number. It rang once, then went silent. I tried my dad next with the same results. I hesitated then, but decided to give 911 a try again. A dispatcher picked up on the second ring. 

“911, what is your emergency?” a familiar voice answered. 

“Oh! Hi, my name is Alison Land. I believe I spoke with you a few minutes ago about being stuck at Oak Hill Cemetery?” I responded.

The dispatcher replied, “Oh, yes, Alison I’m glad you called back! It looks like the connection was lost on your end a few moments ago and I wasn’t able to reach you on that number again. Hang on one moment, I am going to call my chief back into the room. He helped me look into the cemetery when I lost you earlier.”

I heard a muffled, “Hey, Chief? She’s back on the line” from the dispatcher. Moments later, a man’s gruff voice was on the line. “Hello Alison. My name is Chief Brooks. I hear you’re stuck inside Oak Hill Cemetery?” he asked. He did not sound pleased. Maybe I shouldn’t have called 911 for this after all. 

“Uh, yes sir, I am. I walk my dog here every night because of the paved pathways. I guess it was locked up early because of the storm.”

“The thing is, there is no longer an Oak Hill Cemetery in Oak Ridge. That cemetery was closed permanently almost 50 years ago, in 1977.”

I didn’t respond. What he said was not sinking in. That was impossible. I came here every single night and walked Moose. I have come in and out of the gates hundreds of times. I looked around again and started to have a sinking feeling. The furniture was dated. I knew the office had been closed for a while, but this furniture looked like it was made in the 70s. The phone I had in my hand was boxy and yellowed. The computer next to it was also large and boxy. I picked up a piece of paper from a large stack on the desk that was dated September 8th, 1977. I could hear Chief Brooks speaking, asking if I could still hear him.

“Sir,” I interrupted. “This is impossible,” I whispered. “I know you don’t believe me, but I’m standing in the office building of Oak Hill Cemetery right this second. The door was open. Trace the call, it’ll confirm it.” More muffled speaking and a gasp from the dispatcher. “She’s right, it’s coming from the old cemetery,” I faintly heard the dispatcher say.

“Okay, kid, I don’t know how you got inside there. The gates are barred and the fences are too high to jump. Enough playing around. I’m sending an officer out there right now, so I suggest you get out of there before he finds you or you’re coming down to the station. *click*

I held the phone up to my ear, not moving. The buzzing of the ended call rang through my whole head, making me dizzy. I dropped the receiver and slowly slid down the wall. Moose, who had been having the time of his life exploring and sniffing around the room, trotted up to me and licked my hand. I grabbed his face and said, “What is going on, Moosie?” He wriggled free and continued to sniff around. He found a doorway behind a stack of chairs and disappeared through.

I stood up and followed him out of the room into a small hallway. There were two other doors, both closed. I opened the first that led into a small bathroom. The walls were covered in a dark green tile from floor to ceiling, with a faded orange toilet and sink. There was one of those old styled fuzzy toilet seat covers on top. I looked out the window and noticed, for the first time, that the neighborhood that should have butted up to the fence was not there. It was just open, empty land. I rubbed my eyes hard, and looked back out the window. Nothing. I was starting to panic.

I left the bathroom and opened the second door. It was a small kitchen with a very vintage-looking refrigerator and a few appliances. There was a table and two chairs in the center of the room. I plopped down on one and opened my bag I always carry on our walks. I pulled a couple of treats out for Moose, who had been following me around, and tried my phone again. The screen wouldn’t even light up. I dropped it back into the bag and laid my forehead down on the table. This couldn’t be happening. Is this some elaborate prank? Did my brother somehow convince a police dispatcher and Chief to be in on it? Was I losing my mind and actually not even in Oak Ridge? Or, did I somehow transport myself back in time to the 70s?

No. I will not accept that I am losing it. I stood back up and looked out the small window over the sink. It was no longer raining, but the sky looked like it could open back up at any moment. I went back to the front room toward the door. I realized that the thing blocking it was an overturned filing cabinet. I pushed it out of the way, opened the door all the way, and slid the cabinet back in front of it so I wouldn’t get locked out. Moose also saw it was no longer raining, so he followed me out the door and resumed his usual exploring around the area. 

I walked back around the corner to the gate. Still locked. The metal bars were almost big enough to slip through, but I was nervous I would get stuck. They were also rusted, and I didn’t want to accidentally cut myself. I looked out the gate and all around the surrounding area. The houses looked… different. Still the same houses that I walk past every day to get here, but they looked newer. The paint was fresher, and the driveways weren't cracked. I remember this neighborhood was built in 1975 and felt my heart sink again. 

I suddenly remembered that my grandmother, who died in 2002, was buried up the hill in this very cemetery. I started running up the hill, calling for Moose to follow. I weaved through headstones to the spot she was buried, but I almost choked when I got there. It was empty. The little plot that my mom’s entire family would be buried in, was completely empty. Even my great grandmother, who passed before I was born in 1989, was not there. It was an empty plot of land with one small marker at the top center printed “Burgess,” my mother’s maiden name. I sat down in the wet grass and started crying. This made no sense. How is this even happening?

After what felt like ages of sitting in the wet grass, mulling over what I could possibly have done to get in this situation, I heard the loud squeaking sound of the gate being opened. Moose was already taking off down the hill. I followed closely behind and saw an older model truck parked right outside the gate. The style was old, but it was shiny and new. A younger man, probably in his early 30s, was pushing open the gates.I started waving my arms, barrelling down the hill. “HEY!” I called out, “help me!” 

I startled him and he dropped the heavy padlock that was on the gates. I flew past him out the gates, skidding to a stop right past his truck. I bent over, hands on my knees, trying to catch my breath. When I stood up and turned back around to ask if he knew what was going on, he and his truck were both gone. The gates were closed again, secured with a large, rusted lock. Moose trotted up next to me, looking at where the man should have been standing. He started whimpering, and I felt like I couldn’t catch my breath. 

I looked up and saw that there were no clouds overhead, but the sun was beginning to set. I pulled my phone out of my bag and the screen lit up instantly. 5 missed calls from mom, 3 from dad, and about a dozen angry WHERE ARE YOU texts from them both. It was 8:30 in the evening. I was trapped inside that cemetery for over two hours. I dropped my phone back into my bag and stared, bewildered, at the gate. Right as I was about to start my walk home, a police car with its lights on came around the corner. I froze in place, remembering what the Chief had threatened over the phone. 

“Alison Land?” the officer asked, rolling down his window. 

“Yes?” I croaked out.

The officer stepped out of the car and opened his back door. “Chief Brooks is waiting for you down at the station,” he said, beckoning for me to get in the car. I looked at his open door and back to the gate again. “How’d you even get in there?” he asked me as I climbed into the backseat, Moose following right behind. “And why are you so muddy?” he asked again, fishing a towel out of his trunk.

I didn’t answer. I was absolutely speechless. No one was going to believe this.
