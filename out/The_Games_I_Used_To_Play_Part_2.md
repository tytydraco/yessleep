Hey guys, this is a follow-up to my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jtwmwo/the_games_i_used_to_play/). If you want the full story, check it out, but to quickly catch you up to speed - I used to play these “games” when I was a child in which I would try to scare myself, and recently I’ve been beginning to think there is more to the story.



Shit, uhh, where do I even begin?



Sorry, I’m a bit on edge right now, but I think I should just take it back to a week ago when I played the first game in my basement.



After Adrienne told me that she had heard two pairs of footsteps coming up the stairs, I’m not going to lie, I freaked a little. Obviously, I did my best to keep my composure in front of her. Panicking is the last thing you would want to do in front of Adrienne. I love the girl to death, but she really knew how to make a mountain out of a molehill. 



We ended up calling the police to have them check out the basement. The house was new to us so someone squatting down there was, in my mind, a very real possibility. When the officers gave us the all clear and the flashing blue and red lights pulled out of our long driveway I was overcome with embarrassment. 



It was a simple case of me accidentally spooking Adrienne and in doing so I rattled myself a little too. That was all.



But as I’m sure you’re aware, if that was all that had come of it I wouldn’t be making an update.



That night, I agreed to let Adrienne fall asleep with the TV on, on the condition it was set to a thirty minute sleep timer. I wouldn’t be able to rest until it automatically shut off, but she needed the sound and light to comfort her and what position was I in to protest? I closed my eyes and attempted to tune out several different British accents arguing back and forth on the matter of courting a woman. When thirty minutes had passed, I was no closer to sleep, but I did know that Duke Worthington was an absolute prick.



The light rise and fall of Adrienne’s body beside me indicated that she had been asleep for some time now. The night had dragged far longer than either of us had expected, and she is much less of a night owl than I am. 



Finally, surrounded by total darkness and lullabied by eerie silence I should have been able to sleep. But I couldn’t.



There was something that was still bothering me. Sure, the police didn’t find anyone living in our basement, but I couldn’t shake the feeling I had when I played the game.



The game felt real. The fear, the adrenaline, the knowledge that I was being watched from something lurking deep in the shadows. I knew that I wasn’t the only player.



You can say what you want about me, but I had to know for my own sanity if what I experienced was a fluke, or if there was something else that I was missing.



So, in the complete darkness of our bedroom, I stuck my hand outside of the warm protection of my covers. My hand ventured far, dangling off the side of the bed, like a worm on a hook, bobbing in the vast expanse of an uncharted ocean. 



And just like that, I was playing another game.



This game was even more simple than the last. The only rule was this: give the monster something worth taking.



My eyes remained closed as my arm swayed on the side of my bed, not quite at carpet level, but low enough that anything lurking beneath the bed frame would be tempted to snatch it. 



I let it dangle for agonizing seconds that turned to minutes. The air around my hand grew cold, completely exposed to the abyss below.



When I deemed my arm insufficient bait I raised the comforter, letting my naked feet poke out from their protective shield. If the monster went for my arm, there was a chance I could defend myself, but my toes? They were completely unguarded. 



And after several minutes, my toes grew cold as well.



The game was so childish, I could hardly believe that I was playing it. If there was a monster, or god forbid, an actual person, in my room what good would a three inch fabric comforter do? But still I played. I needed to know. I needed closure.



By the time I tucked all my limbs back under the blanket, I’d already accepted the lame victory. I may have won, but could it even be called that if my opponent wasn’t playing the game?



After a few days had passed, I was beginning to think that it had all blown over. Work on the house was going well, it was still an absolute fixer-upper, but I enjoyed doing a bit of manual labor every now and again. Adrienne was incredible when it came to visualizing a room and picking color palettes, but man that girl avoided the manual labor like it was a plague. I guess if you wanted to look at it in a more positive light, you could say the two of us made a good team.



Just when I thought that my childhood games were fully behind me I woke up from a dreamless sleep. It wasn’t uncommon for me, I had a bladder roughly equivalent to that of a seventy year old woman. But I didn’t need to pee, so I rolled on my side away from Adrienne. 



I don’t know what made me do it, but I picked up my phone from the nightstand and checked the time.



When I saw the aggressively bright white numbers illuminated against my dark wallpaper my heart skipped a beat.



3:27 AM.



The monster wanted to play.



I knew this game well, probably because it was the monster's favorite. I’m not saying that he had explicitly told me this of course, but based on the amount of times that I woke up in my childhood bedroom at this exact time, one would have to infer. 



Quickly and silently I got up from the bed and made my way over to the door. It was a creaky, shitty, thing, but thankfully the sound of cracking it slightly ajar did not wake Adrienne.



To play this game, the door needed to be open. Usually, I kept the door open while I slept, but for whatever reason, Adrienne had jokingly described that as one of my “red flags”. Rich talk coming from someone who pours milk in before the cereal.



I crawled back into bed and fixed my eyes on the door. Then I shut them. This was another simple game. The monster wanted me to watch. I needed to open my eyes exactly when the clock struck 3:28. When I was a child, I always instinctively knew when that would be. Maybe it's genetic, but I’ve been gifted a really intuitive feel for time. I don’t know how to describe it other than that. For example, I could sit in a lightless room for an indeterminate amount of time, and when I stepped out I could pinpoint exactly how much time had passed down to the minute.



As I faced the open door with my eyes closed I thought about this fact. Maybe all this time I had been unconsciously counting heartbeats. The steady, rhythmic, thump, thump, of blood flowing from my veins, through my heart, and out of my arteries. 



It’s just a theory, but that night, with my heart racing with a fear that I never possessed as I child, it would explain why I calculated wrong. 



When I opened my eyes, it was not yet 3:28.



I knew that for a fact, because lit by the slivers of moonlight that pierced through our curtains I saw a massive black arm reaching into my room. The arm wasn’t human. No man or woman would have nails that sharp or such feral hair growing in patchy spots. 



Shit, there really is no other way to describe other than saying it was the monster's arm. It had to be. It was the only explanation.



I saw the arm for less than a second before it vanished. Even now as I am recalling the details, I can’t say for certain what was real and what was just my mind playing tricks on me. My calculation must have been off by a mere second. Because I know that when the clock struck 3:28, the monster disappeared.



Who knows what could have happened if I peeked any earlier or later. The dozens of times that I had played this game before, it was all just one fucked up version of peek-a-boo. But I cannot recall even once, experiencing anything remotely like this. 



The moment I saw the monster I bolted upright and the motion was enough to wake Adrienne. 



“What’s wrong?” She asked as she looked up at me.



I refused to let my gaze shift from the door. 



Adrienne followed my eyes and stared at the door confused.



Even if what I saw was a figment of my imagination, I know that I opened the door enough to play the monster’s game. But staring at it then, at 3:28 AM, the door was closed.



Sunrise came several hours later, and despite my best efforts, I was unable to sleep another wink. The events of the previous night wore on me late into the morning, and by noon, I caved. I didn’t need to search long - I knew exactly which box I had put them in. My old lighter and an unopened pack of Marlboros. By the time I made it to the box, the decision was already made.



I took the pack and lighter to our screened in porch and sat on the rocking swing. Starting the moment I lit the cigarette I counted the seconds until Adrienne stormed onto the porch, wearing a furious expression that didn’t belong anywhere near her adorable face.



Have you ever seen a puppy frown before? Or have you said the word “Bubbles” as angrily as you could? That was Adrienne when she got upset with me. Damn near the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.



But I knew she would find me here, the girl has the nose of a bloodhound.



She crossed her arms and tapped her fuzzy pink sock against the wood of the deck.



“Is there something you want to tell me about?”



“I had a long night. Maybe it's just the stress of the move getting to me, but I barely slept. I just needed a cigarette or two, I promise I won’t start up again.”



Adrienne shook her head as she stepped closer and snatched the pack and lighter away. Out of respect, I refrained from taking another puff. At least until she inevitably left.



“You don’t get it. It’s not about these.”



She waved the pack of Marlboros in front of me mockingly. 



“It’s about trust. When something goes wrong, or you have a bad day, I want you to feel like you can turn to me. Not cigarettes or pills. Babe, I’m here. And I will always be for you.”



At that moment, I felt worse than a stack of shit on a sunny day.



Adrienne sat next to me, placing a comforting hand on my thigh. “So, do you want to take that cancer stick out of your mouth and tell me what's bothering you?”



I shook my head. “You wouldn’t understand. I don’t think that I even understand yet.”



“Try me. We don’t give up on each other.”



She really was too damn good for me.



“I can’t. Not yet, at least.” 



Yeah rip me apart, why don’t you? I know, I should have let her in and explained it all. I get that I fucked up, but at the moment I want you to realize that I thought that my imaginary childhood monster was haunting me and I was beyond exhausted from the move. I didn’t need Adrienne freaking out because before you know it we’d be house hunting again.



Adrienne stood, clearly hurt. I could stand to see her angry, but betrayed was not an expression that my heart was adapted for.



“Okay. I understand. Whenever you’re ready, I’ll be here.”  Adrienne walked back inside in her fuzzy pink socks to return to whatever room she was decorating today.



Slowly, I dropped the cigarette and crushed it with my boot.



I pulled out my phone and scanned through my contacts. I paused with my index finger hovering over those three dreadful letters.



I knew I didn’t call as much as I should. You’d be hard pressed to find a single son or daughter that did. But after everything my mom did to raise me on her own, she deserved more from me.

Reluctantly, I pressed dial and raised the phone to my ear.



A full ring didn’t even complete before I heard her voice.



“Mark?” The hint of worry in her words only made me feel more guilty for not reaching out sooner.



“Hey Mom. I uhh… How are you doing?”



She was silent for a moment.



“I’m good. Yeah, things around here have been pretty quiet lately. It’s nice to hear your voice. Honestly, I was waiting for you to call, but I know how busy you must be with the new house.”



“Yeah, yeah. I’ve certainly had my hands full.”



“I just want to say how proud I am of you for finally getting out there on your own.”



“Right.” 



I rocked forward and back on the swing with my phone pressed to my ear.



“So, what are you calling about? Is everything alright? You know you can always come and live with me if things get too overwhelming.”



“We- I’m great. Thanks, but I don’t need to live with you. The house is perfect. I’m actually calling with a bit of a weird question though. Do you remember the games I used to play when I was a kid? I mostly played them while you were at the hospital overnight, but I… I don’t know. Does any of this ring a bell?”



My mom fell silent for what felt like minutes.



“You really don’t remember do you?”



“Remember what?”



“Oh Mark, I really don’t know if I should be doing this. I thought we closed that chapter of our lives a long time ago. I don’t want to reopen any old wounds. Are you still seeing Adrienne?”



I furrowed my brows. I loved my mom, but she had a habit of asking the most bizarre questions. 



“Of course I’m still seeing Adrienne! What do you mean by old wounds?”



I tried to think back to any specific event she could possibly be referring to, but my memory was too foggy. The only clear pictures of my childhood I had were the games that I used to play.



“Maybe you should talk to her first.”



My jaw tightened as I wondered what my mom and Adrienne could both possibly know that I didn’t. As far as I was aware the two weren’t even on speaking terms.



“I tried, but she won’t have the answers I need. But you will. Tell me what I’m not remembering about the games.”



I heard a lighter click on the other side of the line. I hate it when she smokes. It reminds me of the same dreadful addiction that I inherited from her.



“Alright look Mark, I’m going to tell you, but you need to promise me that you’ll take care of yourself, you hear me? I worry about you. You’re my baby boy and I know I wasn’t always the best mother, but I tried. So please, don’t blame me. I’ve already blamed myself enough for the both of us.”



“Of course I won't blame you Mom. I love you, and I know how much you love me. I can take care of myself.”



Somehow, even when I was young I understood the weight that came with being a single parent. I knew that she was struggling financially and emotionally with my dad’s absence, but I never blamed her. Hell I never even blamed my dad either. He didn’t want to think about me, and I didn’t want to think about him either. I had no other family to watch me while she was gone, yet I was never alone. I had my games, and I had the monster that I played them with.



Thinking about it as an adult, it sends a shiver down my spine.



“Alright, here goes. I came home late one night, and as per my usual routine I peeked into your room to check on you before I crashed into bed. That night, your bed was empty. I called out and you didn’t answer. Panicked as all hell, I checked my room, the living room, and the bathrooms. It was then when I heard a faint voice coming from downstairs. I raced down there and I flipped on the light and there you were, sitting with your legs crossed, facing a corner of the room. Your eyes were closed and even when the light turned on, you didn’t open them. I called your name, and you didn’t so much as flinch. As I stepped closer, I heard what you were whispering. It was numbers. Thirteen. Twelve. Eleven. I shouted your name again. Eight. Seven. Six. Mark, I was petrified. I didn’t know what to do so I shook you hard. That must have broken you out of whatever trance you were in because you looked up at me and you smiled. That’s when you asked me a simple question: ‘Do you want to play too?’”



My skin had grown completely covered in goosebumps as I listened to the story. I remembered it now. The countdown game. That night was the only time that I had ever played it, and I can’t say for sure, but I think it may have been the last game I ever played. We moved out of my childhood home a few weeks later. Our new house was a two bedroom apartment, much smaller than my childhood home. The neighbors were noisy, and I remember for the first time in my life having a dedicated babysitter.



With all the noise and distraction, the monster never came back. I no longer woke up routinely at 3:27 AM, and there was no basement to loiter in after the lights had been shut. I didn’t think much of the games for a while. It wasn’t exactly something that would get you invited to very many high school parties. 



Not that I ever found out what would get you invited.



I finished the call with my mom, thanking her for the information and promising that I would call more often. As I sat on the swing I thought about the game that I had only dared to play once, a nagging question burning at my insides.



What would have happened if I made it to zero?
