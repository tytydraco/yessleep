Chapter 1 - Starting out with a Bang!

Dang girl you are covered in sweat!   Speak for yourself papi, i'm not the only one covered in it but I'm surely not washing your sheets, that's definitely your job not mine.  Denova said to me leaning on her side facing me with a smirk expression across her face, a mix of mischief and satisfaction can be seen ….. And smelt in all honesty.  I flipped up on my butt looking around for my cell phone which somehow made its way across the bedroom floor from the bed.  You're too used to having Chorizo and now experiencing the full impact of a Polish Kielbasa, you know what they say, once you go white….
She laughed and simply replied, “don't be so full of yourself, it was only 15 minutes and I did most of the work”.  I lowered my head as I stood up. Well… you can't say it wasn't the best 15 minutes you ever had now can you? I replied sarcastically, raising my head with a playful smile plastered across my face.   Ima have a smoke, now where the hell did i leave my briefs?

I actually gotta get going Ben, Denova said as she hopped off the side of the bed getting dressed.   I wanna try to pick up a Latte, wanna come?   As much as I did crave that delicious iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts, which happens to taste just as good as Starbucks and at half the cost, those bloodsucking tweens i thought to myself before replying ‘nah i'm actually going live with Gary and a few friends on that game i just picked up.   ‘Is that the open world horror one you were talking about? she replied. ‘Hell yeah it's hella fun, and scary AF if you play it alone in the dark too but don't tell nobody haha….. Now you see your average woman more than likely wouldn't know what the hell a Cryptid is, let alone a lot of guys too I'm assuming in all honesty, but she wasn't any ordinary chick… Denova was a horror movie junkie, Hellraiser 1 & 2 “the originals are her fav’s, not any of these remake reboot crap.  Rest in Peace Patrick Swayze, the Hollywood Gods have failed once again with no new ideas or originality and keep wanting to remake classics once again and failing miserably. 

Once Denova bounced, I got my phone, put in my screen lock code and I hit up Gary on Facebook messenger, making sure he was still down to team up for pound town on these beasts and maybe get past the dang Dark Forest.  I keep getting my butt killed there every time, I feel ill need to bring some KY with me just for comfort.   About 10 minutes later I was in front of my TV screen with the system turned on and the VR headset atop my head and ready for some all night monster kicking action.  
This game was not only addictive but hard as hell. I've had it for about a week, played it daily and barely got through half the game map..  You start off in this open patch of land at the forest entrance which is called The Knoxdale Forest.  Then there's this bridge with a Bigass Troll, then the Dark forest full of fricken Dogman creatures that always tear my ass up harder than a fresh fishs be’hind at San Quentin.  I haven't gotten past that yet, but I know there's more on that map once the gray areas open up.  Here goes nothin…..

(Video Game Console Startup sound)

“Welcome to the Land of Horrors, Do you think you have what it takes to survive?”

Was written on my face screen as the game started to load.

Once the font disappeared from my vision a small white circle appeared in the center of the pitch black space i was now in and the hole was slowly getting larger….and larger… The it got extremely bright, then my head started to burn and this loud electricity noise exploded in my ears and I grabbed my VR headset trying to pry them off with my hands but the damn shit wouldn't come off.  If i wasn't in so much agonizing pain I would have compared it to Carly Beth in Goosebumps where her dang Halloween mask wouldn't come off… But this was real… this was really happening, i'm getting fried like an egg in my own damn living room and there's no one even here to help me or call for help.   The noise kept buzzing, a mixture of an electrified fence with a bug zapper multiplied by 100 and that's what was ringing through my ears, and the pain I can't even explain how much that crap was hurting… again i felt like i was being fried!   ……  Then suddenly, my knees gave out and everything went completely black………


Chapter 2 - This is some Bullshit!

I woke up to a partly cloudy blue sky, the smell was of pine trees and earth. A rich musty aroma from decomposing leaves, twigs and many other matter on the ground…. I was laying on my back…..but where, where the hell was I?  I blinked a few times, shaking my head, feeling my ears and to my surprise, I felt no pain, no blood, nothing…  It was as if nothing had happened just moments ago in my living room. But I was no longer inside my living room, I was somewhere else…..but how?   I carefully stood up and scanned my new surroundings….  No… this can't be happening, this isn't real there's no freakin way, I must be dreaming…..what in the holy jingle bells is happening…. I must be trippin, but I hate mushrooms, so I scratched that out of the equation.

(Notification sound)

You are now in the land of Horror, do you have what it takes to survive, do you have what it takes to escape?

Read across my vision in computer text before disappearing after a few seconds.

I was not only in a game of some kind, but judging from the font read aloud to me, I also recognised this clear patch of land I was now in..   This was the beginning of that Escape Horrorland game I was playing….. No ficken way I said out loud to myself.  

HAHAHA Another Earthling I see…..  

A voice came somewhere nearby to my right just out of view.  I quickly turned and saw some old ass man in tattered clothing walking up to me with a smirk on his wrinkly frail face.   The man looked to be in his 70s at least!..... 

What the hell is going on here? How am I here and not in my apartment? This is some sick shit is this some kind of prank and who the hell are you old man?  I yelled out of fright and confusion.  ‘Settle down young man this is no prank, you are one of many who have been chosen to complete the quest of Horrors’  he said.  "This is real, you are not imagining this, the same thing that you saw playing this video game is what you will now face head on in person, the only difference is now that if you die here you die for real”.   I was still trying to grasp my brain around all of this….. So what you're saying is that electrical malfunction somehow zapped me inside the fricken video game?  Are you off your rocker buddy? I screamed at him angrily.  “I'm afraid so, listen, there is no way to beat around the bush to explain this to you kid but you're in this video game, but inside here is their world, it's real for them.  They know nothing about our universe aside from us who have somehow been sent here to what I assume is to complete the game”.   
“Hmm well lad a 25 year old such as yourself might just have a chance at wrapping this place up.  As for me, I'm too old, I had no business even trying to play video games at my age anyhow but with luck I have it here I am.’     
How did you know my age, I never told you, you some kind of mind reader too grandpa?
‘No I used ‘analize’ to see your basic profile information’  
How the hell do you do that?  How long have you been here?
“You simply concentrate on someone or something in this realm and it will show you, and as far as how long i've been here and why im still here… .well lets just say at my age kid I have not the strength or ability to protect myself against most of the creatures here.  I don't know how long I've been here, times are different and I didn't keep count”.  “Go ahead give it a try, analyze me son”
Shoot, I guess I really don't have anything to lose, I thought to myself.  If i'm really in this bitch i need to start thinking about what I do in this game and ‘man the hell up’ before some beast swallows my ass and craps me out.

I closed the analyze tab and then asked him.  ‘George, what else can you tell me or teach me about this place and how things work?  I have played this game before, but never like this obviously’.

‘Well son…. What is your name first of all?  Here in this realm I'd suggest using your gamertag name considering that your formal self doesn't exist here.  You can concentrate on your profile by simply ‘willing it’ and like that aside from other things that are done here in person compared to using a game controller.’

I willed my profile Display next:

(Notification Sound)

Profile:

Name…….   Which showed a cursor blinking in an empty space next to it….. Well crap, my gamertag was “StarFishPumper” because I’m a Sexual Tyrannosaurus like Blain from the 1987 Predator movie, or at least I thought myself to be.   There's no way I'm having anyone call me that in person.. I laughed to myself at the thought….
I thought for a moment and then it hit me…

“My name is Kenjo”

The name entered itself and then displayed the rest of my information:

I'm no Noob, I said out loud and closed my profile display.  I noticed on the top right side of my vision to have a thin red bar which I could only assume to be my health bar just like in the game.  Ok, so far it's starting to make more sense to me.  So George, I asked.  Are there Health Herbs here to find and eat for healing like in the game, what about finding loot or other various items?
“Yes Kenjo, everything is just as it was in the game, you just have to concentrate or simply ‘will it’ and it will be”  he replied.  
“Here, I have stashed a few things i've found over my time here alone, I doubt ill be around for too much longer the way things have been going for me here so better I give it to someone who could actually put some use to it” George said.

I minimized the notifications and thanked George for not only his goods but also the little help of information of just everything in this beeyatch.   I put on the ring of health and automatically noticed my red health bar lengthen some across my screen. Then adding on the funky looking grayish brown chest plate armor and sheathing the sword from my belt I noticed that it's more like a short sword in my hands, which made sense as I'm human and goblins are little ugly ass green boogers with legs.  But it will have to do, I said to myself, better this than nothing but these brown peasant clothing I'm wearing and ugly as hell looking knock off Moccasins. 

I willed my profile once again now with the new attire and weapon equipped.

(Relationship Status Change Sound Effect)

Your relationship with George went from Stranger to now Friendly.

(Level Up Sound Effect)

Congratulations, you have advanced to Level 2.  Making allies and learning about new items and skills can help you not only level up faster by experience but also help you to stay alive.  Now stop being a lil bitch!

Noticing my Strength & Health went up by 30 points to a total of 230 and strength went up 10 points to 30, I closed the dialog and smiled…  

Come with me I said to George, there is power in numbers, you shouldn't be here all by yourself and now unarmed my conscience wouldn't feel right just leaving you here.
“Kenjo my boy, I am tired… I've been here for so long, and even back home on Earth I knew I was done not only mentally but physically.  Whatever happens, I've lived a good life, but I'm ready for my next journey when that path shows itself to me.
I understand, but that still doesn't mean I agree with you, but the choice is yours. Thanks again for everything, do you mind if I stay here with you through the night to gather my bearings before I hit the road tomorrow?

“Not at all I'm cooking up some Bunny Stew and you're more than welcome to accompany me around the fire. I can't say it is anything special but I find this area quite safe and quiet compared to the other areas I have traveled, you’ll be safe here for the night.  I do need some Mint Leaves if you don't mind finding some, they're randomly around and actually good for health so make sure you keep some with you for your journey.”

That's right Healing Herbs are found in this game, I guess he calls them Mint leaves, i just hope to god they at least taste half as good.  I've only had mint leaves in cucumber water than my old lady would make as some stupid detox crap she’ll do from time to time.  Never was too fond of it myself,  I just squeeze some lemon in the water and that's good enough for flavor for me.  It becomes French. I called it “Lem’Wa”.  I smiled remembering the good times back home, I also missed her Baoding Balls skills (bow’ding balls) ‘and i'm not talkin bout no Meditation!’  I giggled, as I searched the nearby brush for what George had called Mint Leaves. 

(Notification Sound Effect)

Congratulations!  You have uncovered “Health Herbs”, a minty smell & taste to which consumed gains you 10 extra points to your health.  

I grabbed some and put it up to my nose….yup definitely mint leaves, i took a nibble and to my utter surprise it tasted just like mint leaves back on Earth.  After spending some time scavenging the nearby brush areas around the clearing where George had set up camp for the night, I had a good supply for not only the supper for tonight but so for my own stash for tomorrow's journey to find a way out of this hell hole.  Once back at the campsite I gave him what was needed and sat beside the already roaring fire near a makeshift tent.  Bushcraft skills was something I had always loved watching on YouTube but I never tried doing it in real life before, or whatever my life was now called being here in Horrorland that is.  
“That tent space is for you” George said to me before I could ask him, "I like to just stargaze myself but once you’re on your way you’ll have to decide how you prefer sleeping at night”.

…… Supper wasn't all that bad, my girl used to have two lop eared bunnies as pets back when we first moved in with each other but had to lock them up in their cages in the outside storage space on our patio due to their smell.  That definitely was no life for a bunny, or any animal pet in all honesty.  But they both died of old age; one went into the dumpster and the other we buried at her mothers house and by some magic of the Gods it started growing a tomato plant in the same spot we buried the 2nd bunny.  I don't know if her family ate those tomatoes or not, I don't even like tomatoes unless they're in salsa or cooked so it didn't matter to me one way or the other, but definitely brought back some memories eating the stew.  George and I had some casual small talk before hitting the hay, come to find out he is from California and he said the monsters here and the crime back home as different as they were weren't anything new to him.  
“I'm from a beach town called Oceanside in an area known by locals as The Deep Valley.  A lot of crime, murder and theft happens in that little area of mine.  I have been wanting to move away for years but I was only a year away from retirement at that time and thought it best to stick it out and wait until then and hit the road to a Red state”.
After that, we both said our goodnights and laid down for the night.  The next morning to my surprise George was gone, I mean completely vanished, no trace of anything that he had on him aside the the items he had given to me the day prior.  The early morning was cool with a light chill breeze that tickled my skin giving my arms goosebumps upon its touch.  The sky was cloudy but the sun was doing its best to fight off  the mist as best as it could and I gathered up my things into my pack, putting on the chest plate and sword on my belt.  Now, if I'm not mistaken, the game had a built in map showing everywhere you’d traveled will be lit up and the gray section areas of the map that you have yet to uncover.  I didn't know how in the hell I was supposed to find my map, I didn't have a fricken controller with me on this hellhole, but I took a wild guess that anything I wanted to check out whether it was my profile, stats, inventory, maps… All I needed to do was to ‘will’ it.   
I shrugged and concentrated, willing the map to be visible to me.
The map instantly popped up on my view, completely covering my vision.  I definitely didn't want to look at my map during a time of danger. That's for damn sure, I'd be slaughtered in a second if I ever made that mistake.  

(Notification sound effect)

Congratulations!  You have activated your map interface.  This is the map of Horrorland: The areas visible on your map are locations you have been to and the areas that are gray you have yet to discover. 

Seeing the small red icon circle at the bottom portion I can tell was myself still in the open clearing starting area near the edge of Knoxdale Forest.   There is a small dirt path leading around the forest North which connects to a bridge from memory playing the game days beforehand… which leads to The Dark Forest where I kept getting my ass kicked.  So I knew where I needed to go up until that point.   Willing the map interface to kick rocks, it minimized on my screen to a tiny icon at the far left corner of my vision.  Once that was settled, I started my trek along the dirt path in the hopes I don't run into anything life threatening, or at least something that I can at least handle.  I was definitely having my doubts as to how in the world am I going to finish this in one piece.  Even though that fear stuck to the back of my mind like grease on your fingers and trying to wash it off without any soap, I continued on down the path.
What I could only assume was mid day judging by the position of the sun in the sky, I knew I had a good 5-6 hours before dusk and would definitely want to find somewhere safe to sleep for the night.  While I walked along the trail of Knoxdale Forest I swear I could hear movement inside the foliage, the sounds of multiple things moving about, twigs snapping, cracking on the forest floor and through the thick brush inside those dark woods beyond my sight.  

The walk for the past couple of hours was semi pleasant, yes I was extremely paranoid about the woods around me but yet not actually seeing anything, I just kept my guard up and tried to make the best out of my walk.  I heard the scream of someone and the roar of something very not human somewhere further up ahead of me.  I stopped stunned and quickly hopped over behind the bush to my right hoping to have not been seen by whoever was making those noises up ahead.   I focused and tried to explain ‘’what  in the holy jungle bells of old Saint Nick's sack of goodies’ I was witnessing with my own two eyes?

At about 40 yards up ahead just right on this very same trail not only did I see the bridge entrance but also a battle to the death between what I very well knew to be a troll from the game.  Seeing this disgusting humanoid abomination in person was something else entirely though.  It was about 5 feet tall and as wide as that Blueberry girl from Willy Wonka movie.  It has grayish skin with a hint of green, so I slowly walked close through the brush to try to examine the situation better and see who this Troll was fighting with.     Once I had stealthily reached a safe hidden distance of about 20 feet away, assuming it was fighting another human that must have made the mistake of not being aware of their surroundings, I came to the realization that this creature was fighting against a Forest Elf.  This Elf was about half half its height, skinny yellowish pale skin, brown hair braided back like someone on the Vikings TV show on HBO with pointed ears and wore green armor. That Elf must be from Knoxdale I thought to myself. They're small yet mighty, and if you piss them off or try stealing from them or jacking up their woods they will definitely kick your ass. Aside from that,  they're actually quite cool in the game.  You can trade with them for all kinds of various items if you win them over or have something good to offer in trade or have enough coin.  

I focused my attention on the Troll and analyzed his Stats: 


Name: Bile’ron
Race: Troll
Level: 15
Age: Unknown
Health: 20 of 320
Strength: 75 
Damage: 30
Skills: None
Magic: None
Reputation: Hated

‘Trolls are nasty disgusting creatures that typically hide beneath bridges and out of sight from other creatures and races.  They are not intelligent creatures whose sole purpose is to feed and sleep.  Do not approach or try to conversate with this creature as it will surely try to kill and eat you right where you stand.’

Noticing his red health bar so low I could see that he was practically moments away from being beaten by the Forest Elf.  That's when I quickly analyzed The Elf:

Name: Wadell Bearclaw:  Protector of the Wilds
Race: Wood Elf
Level: 20
Age: 30
Health: 25 of 385
Strength: 40 
Damage: 60
Skills: Archery, short sword
Magic: Explosive Arrows
Reputation: Feared

A wood Elf is one who Dwells in the forests whose home is built high into the trees.  They aren't necessarily evil but mostly associate with nature rather than other creatures. They may be friends with humans but it is rare.  The Wood Elves are often mistaken by Fairies due to their small size and pointy ears and are known to be extremely stealthy and deadly with a bow and arrow.  What they lack in size they gain in distant combat. 

After reading his stats I had a decision to make, and I needed to make it quick….
