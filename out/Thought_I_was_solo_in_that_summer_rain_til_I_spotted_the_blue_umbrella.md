What I’m about to tell you isn’t easy for me.
I laughed at this story so many times… until the eyes of that thing caught me in the rain.



"The Wanderer in the Summer Rain"... I never really believed that story.
I didn’t believe any of those urban legends the students whispered about.
But after what happened… I don’t know. I can’t just call it a story anymore.

It was a crazy hot day in the middle of summer.
The four of us — me and three classmates — were hanging out in the classroom after school, waiting for the bus. The air was thick, the sun was burning the asphalt, no shade anywhere.

To kill time, I decided to tell them this story I’d heard so many times:
"The Wanderer in the Summer Rain."

I told them how they say he only shows up with the first drops of rain, holding a dark blue umbrella...
How from far away, he looks like a shadow or a mirage dancing on the hot asphalt, until you realize those eyes — yes, those strange eyes — are watching you.
I told them about how tall he is, his weird limbs, and how he gets closer day by day... until one day he "swallows you," leaving only your clothes soaked in rain.

They laughed.
Said it was nonsense.
I laughed with them, though I always found the story... unsettling.
Maybe because the disappearances linked to it — the school janitor, the butcher’s son, the old teacher — were never explained.

The day ended.
Everyone left on the bus.
Me? I walked home. About a 30-minute walk.

The weather had changed. Dark clouds were creeping in.
As I walked down the wide road, a light summer rain began to fall — the kind that cools your skin and sparks your imagination... unfortunately.

Even though I tried to ignore the story, I couldn’t shake it from my mind.
And as I kept walking, I saw it... an umbrella.
Blue.
All alone, swaying over the wheat fields.

I told myself it was just a coincidence, maybe someone dropped it.
I didn’t look again, and I picked up my pace.

But something inside me kept screaming: don’t look back. Don’t.

I kept walking. Minutes passed. My heartbeat was louder than my footsteps.
Finally, when I reached the old bus stop shelter... I turned around.

No one was there.
Or so I thought... until I saw him.

Standing across the road.
Tall. His limbs all wrong.
Holding a blue umbrella, water dripping from it.
His eyes... locked on me.

We just stood there.
Him over there. Me here. Only the road between us.

I don’t know how long I stood frozen. I felt like if I moved, if I showed fear — that’d be the end of me.

Then — luckily — the bus finally arrived.
I climbed on, barely able to breathe.
Sat down, staring straight ahead, trying to stop my hands from shaking.

But as the bus pulled away, I looked out the window.
He was still there.
Standing... watching me.

Maybe I got away that day.
Or maybe... just maybe...
