When your job is to tuck other people’s last sentences into the paper, you learn to watch the clock.

Nights at the Millford Gazette are quiet in that heavy way old buildings get, like a theater waiting for the curtain that never rises. The press downstairs thrums through the bones of the place. All the day reporters go home and the newsroom becomes mine. Me, the blue glow of the CMS, and the stack of things that tell you everything that went wrong in town after sunset: police blotter, fire runs, obituaries.

We have a new system for the obits—“ObitLink,” which is exactly the sort of cheerful name you give something that eats death certificates for breakfast. Families and funeral homes can submit, but the software also scrapes public feeds, pre-fills the basics, and pings me to polish. It’s supposed to save time.

At 1:11 a.m., it pinged me with my name.

I thought it was a joke. I was alone, so I actually laughed out loud, that little empty sound that makes you immediately listen for someone else laughing back. On my screen:

```
AVERY NOLAN, 32

Millford — Avery Thomas Nolan, 32, of Millford, passed away early Tuesday, June 18, 2024.

Born to Clara Nolan and the late James Nolan on April 9, 1992, Avery graduated from Millford High School and worked as a copy editor at the Millford Gazette. Known for his attention to detail and quiet humor, he—

Cause of death: pending.

Services by Pine Hollow Funeral Home. Burial at Millford Cemetery. Survived by his mother, Clara; his cat, Juniper.
```

That’s… not a generic prank. It spelled my middle name right. It knew my cat. It even had the funeral home we usually deal with. There was a blank after “quiet humor” like it was waiting for me to fill in what I was known for. I guess “staying late to print his own death” wasn’t a template phrase.

I checked the submission logs. There was no funeral home tag, no user account, just the little gray “auto-generated” dot we get when ObitLink fills something from state feeds.

I tried to delete it. It came back. I tried to reject. It reappeared as a new entry sixty seconds later, identical except for one added line:

```
Time of death: approximately 2:17 a.m.
```

Time is a weird shape in a quiet room. I looked up at the wall clock because I didn’t want to look at the lower right corner of my screen. 1:19. I told myself it was definitely a prank. I slacked Ethan (features), because Ethan is the guy who swapped the spectrum on my monitor and made me think the building was haunted last Christmas. No answer. I texted him. I called. Straight to voicemail.

I opened the template to edit it anyway, partly because I’m me and partly because if this was a prank it was mean. I took out the “quiet humor” line because no one is obligated to summarize me. I deleted the “Time of death” line. I hovered over “delete” again like maybe it just needed confidence.

The entry blinked.

The “Time of death” line came back, bolded now. And something else, in the body:

```
He left the newsroom at 1:23 a.m. to smoke on the steps, though he does not smoke. He stood under the “Gazette” sign and watched his breath fog anyway.
```

I don’t smoke. I got up anyway. My jacket was on the back of my chair and my scarf was in the sleeve and I don’t remember putting it there. The stairwell was colder than it had any right to be in June. I opened the door to the street and the night slid in. Millford at one-something is a handful of sodium pools and a river smell. The press thudded below me like a slow heartbeat.

I stood under the sign and made the mistake of trying: I breathed out and watched the white stream anyway, like the line had read, and I made myself breathe again next to a newspaper that had just told me what I was doing.

I went back up. The obit had updated.

```
He returned at 1:26 a.m., scared now. He checked the server logs. He called Pine Hollow. He did not leave a message.
```

There’s a thing I’ve noticed when you read enough obits. People die in the neatest, most euphemistic ways. “At home, surrounded by family.” “Peacefully.” “After a brief illness.” Sometimes you get a sentence like a trapdoor: “He left behind a life complicated by choices.” You learn to put the floor back on for people.

I dialed Pine Hollow. It barely rang before a woman answered like she’d been holding the receiver. “Pine Hollow.”

“I—this is the Gazette. I think your system sent an advance by mistake. For me.” I said my name. The line clicked softly in my ear. “I just want to make sure this isn’t a real—”

“We didn’t send anything,” she said. Her voice had the practiced quiet of grief rooms. “If you have one, it didn’t come from us.”

“Then how—”

“Mr. Nolan,” she said, and the hair on my arms rose because that was the voice you use with someone’s son. “Do you have a gas stove?”

I looked up. I pictured my apartment, the enamel chipped on the front right burner where it never clicks right. Juniper sleeping on the back of the couch like a comma. I’d left at five. I cooked pasta and I think I turned it off. (I turned it off.)

“I—yeah,” I said.

“Go home,” she said. “Open your windows. Take the cat outside. Bring her here if you need to. We’re open.”

I hung up without saying okay. My screen flickered. A new line bloomed:

```
He considered going home for the cat at 1:31 a.m.
```

The “Time of death” stayed at 2:17. My thumb hovered over my mom’s name. If I called her, the news would be in her mouth forever. If I didn’t and something happened, there would be a blank.

I typed instead, just to see what would happen. I put in a stupid sentence: “He did cartwheels in the aisle to see if the words would keep up.” I hit save. When I looked back, my sentence was gone, replaced neatly:

```
He tried to make it stutter. He will learn the words are not a machine. They are a mirror.
```

“I get it,” I said to the empty room. “You’re the creepy algorithm.” I deleted the entry again because I am stubborn and because if I printed my own obituary without fighting the text would be true in a way I couldn’t stand.

It returned with this:

```
We regret to inform you this obituary has been locked.
```

My reflection in the monitor looked like I was already in the newsprint: flat, already a little gray.

I grabbed my keys. If the worst thing in the world printed in the paper, at least Juniper would not die alone in a one-bedroom with a barely-detectable smell.

Down the stairwell, the press vibrated the banister under my palm. The front door clicked open with that soft whoosh old hinges make. The air outside felt colder than the inside even though that wasn’t possible. The river was a darker stripe at the end of Main. The clock in the jewelry store window read 1:53.

My phone buzzed. New email from ObitLink: “Auto-Approval Notice.” I felt sick. I opened it and there it was, like a knife slid under the ribs:

```
AVERY NOLAN, 32

…He left the newsroom at 1:53 a.m., forgetting his gray scarf on the back of his chair. He took the long way home to avoid the river, turning onto Maple at 1:56.

Time of death: approximately 2:17 a.m.
Cause of death: pending.
```

I went back inside. I picked up the scarf because it was the one thing the words had been wrong about. I typed a Facebook message to Mom: “Don’t worry. Might come by late.” I didn’t send it. If she woke up and saw it without a reply it would look like a goodbye note.

The newsroom felt like a stage set somebody had left in a hurry. The plant at the metro desk had a folded Post-It under the pot that said WATER in dense ballpoint. The coffeemaker gurgled even though no one had touched it since nine. Every monitor threw weak light into a maze of empty chairs.

I sat at my desk and tried to reason with code.

ObitLink has a support chat, the kind that starts with a bot and ends with a person if you keep saying “person.” The bot bubbles popped up like they were apologizing.

> Hi! I’m Ollie with ObitLink. How can I help?

my name is in the system

> I’m so sorry for the confusion! Are you attempting to submit an obituary?

it’s submitting itself. mine. where is it pulling from?

> Our platform integrates with EDRS and select public record sources to prepopulate obituary data for faster reporting. Can you confirm the full name?

i already did. it knows my mom’s name. it knows my cat. it knows i’m writing to you.

There was a pause long enough for me to hear the press change pitch, like a machine taking a breath before it does something new.

> We do not have access to social media or personal devices. If an unintended obituary has been generated, please contact your EDRS administrator to withdraw the record.

there is no record. i’m alive.

> If you feel you are in immediate danger, please contact emergency services.

I almost typed a thank you to the bot because that’s an instinct we have, to be polite to machines right up until we realize they’re sharper than us.

It hit me then that the press was running. It shouldn’t be. We don’t roll until after three, after I send pages down. But I could hear paper moving in long white loops. The newsroom floor vibrated.

There’s a lever downstairs you can throw to stop the feed. Ethan showed me the first week I worked here, like a little superstition. “If the paper eats someone, you pull that,” he said, half-joking. He meant a hand. An old pressman lost three fingers the year I was born when his sleeve got caught. We keep the glove he was wearing nailed to the corkboard like a warning. White cotton. Missing everything that made it a hand.

I stood up because I couldn’t sit anymore with the sound of my own paper printing me. I got as far as the top of the basement stairs before my phone chimed again. New obit draft. I made myself look.

```
He thought about going to the press room. He did not. It would have been his hand. The cause of death is not the press.
```

My legs went weird under me like my body wanted to say something for once. I sat on the top step and braced my hands on the railings and breathed in the smell of oil and ink and paper. I remembered the woman at Pine Hollow. Gas stove. Open windows.

If the words were a mirror, maybe I could hold it up to something else.

I went back to my desk and opened a new document. Not in the CMS. Not in the Gazette’s system at all. Here, in this window. I typed like I was trying to outrun the part of me that pauses for adjectives.

I wrote down the time the system first pinged, what it said, the way my breath looked in June. I wrote the exact wording of the lines because the exactness was the part that scared me. I wrote down the Pine Hollow woman’s question. I wrote down the feeling of the press in my ribs.

I checked the obit. It had added:

```
He is typing.
```

I did something then that I realize now was a kind of superstition. I made a stopwatch on my phone and set it to 2:31. Not 2:17. A little past. Enough time to get home, at least to the bottom of the steps, enough time to open the windows, scoop up Juniper, stand shivering in the hallway waiting for something to decide whether I was alive.

I set this post to publish at 2:31 a.m. if I don’t come back and cancel it.

It’s 2:12 now. The press is running. The obit is locked. I can hear the building’s breath. I’m going to go home. I’m going to open the windows. If this goes up, Pine Hollow, I’m bringing her to you. If this goes up, Mom, I’m sorry for making you see my name in that font. If this goes up—

—it’s 2:31.
