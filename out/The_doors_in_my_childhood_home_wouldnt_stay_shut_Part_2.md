I find it interesting how memory works. Those memories I recalled a month ago were buried for so long, until one night, I came home from work to find I’d left my blinds up. I’ve always been meticulous about keeping my blinds closed at night, so I immediately went to close them. As I did, those memories came rushing back, as if they had just happened yesterday.

I don’t know if I can trust my memories, but I really can’t help but feel certain that I did see my mother that night. I remember that image of her, out in the dark, staring at me, clear as day. It really doesn’t make any sense though, because by that point in time my mother was dead.

The other day, after coming back to my apartment from a short grocery trip, I discovered in horror that I left my door open. As these memories have come back to me, they’ve left me distracted and confused. I do have to slam my apartment door pretty hard to close it. As I rushed back into my apartment to ensure it was exactly as I’d left it, I received another influx of memories from my childhood.

As I said, memories work in strange ways.

My father was concerned about the security of our house to the point of paranoia. Every night, he would meticulously check each door in our house, ensuring it was locked and double locked. We had a gate guarding our driveway. We had a garage door that would only open through a remote, and he had the only copy. 

Then, of course, there were those damn lights. To my recollection, after that night I saw my mother, I do not remember ever seeing the lights come on at night, nor do I recall the knocking at my window returning.

She died when I was twelve, and I struggle to remember the circumstances of her death. However, I do know it was around that time that I stopped sleeping with my bedroom door open and the bathroom light on. By that time, light scared me more than the dark. I kept my door shut, the blinds closed, and started sleeping with a face mask so I could never see if the motion sensor lights were on or off at night.

That being said, every time I woke up, I found that my bedroom door was open. 

I chalked it up to my dad’s nervousness. My mom was gone, and he had certainly changed. He’d become more protective of me. He hated leaving me alone, even though at times his job demanded it. I thought he was coming into my room to check on me at night, leaving the door open when he left.

That’s what I chose to believe, until the doors opened during the day.

My dad was away at work. He ran his own business, which often required him to work weekends. So one sunny Saturday, I was alone at home, when I walked into the kitchen to find the front door wide open.

In a panic I ran towards it and slammed it shut, firmly double locking it. My dad had instilled the fear of god into me at keeping the house locked down—his fears had become mine. I stared at the door for a long moment before making my way back to our living room, only to see that the back door was open too.

Once again, I slammed it shut. My panic became more founded in reality. My dad would never have forgotten to close and lock *one* door before leaving the house, nevermind *two.*

I grabbed a poker from our fireplace. There had to be someone in the house, and it was the best weapon I could think of. I made my way meticulously through our large, empty home. The sunlight streaming through the windows felt cold and unwelcoming now, like the harsh fluorescent lighting of a hospital floor. 

Every single door was open. The door to my parent’s room. Their bathroom door. My bathroom door. My bedroom door. The closet doors. I closed them all, but every time I moved rooms, I’d find the doors in the room I’d just been in remained stubbornly open.

I heard nobody. I didn’t hear them creak open; I didn’t hear footsteps other than mine. I began to cry in panic, frantically closing doors in room after room.

I returned to our kitchen to find the front door and every single cabinet and drawer flung open. A low rumbling noise filled the house. I peeked out the window to discover our garage door slowly opening with a thunderous roar. I broke down and ran for our home phone, grabbing it like a lifeline and running back to my bedroom, past all the flung open doors that I had just locked. I huddled in my closet, shaking, and called my dad.

“Is this important, honey? I’m with a client,” he sounded annoyed. 

“Dad, the garage door is open.”

There was a silence, and I could hear him breathing raggedly on the other end of the line.

“I’ll be home in ten minutes.”

I curled into a ball on my closet floor. I tried in vain to close the door a few times, but every time I did, it would slowly creep open again as if caught by a gust of wind. It felt like decades that I lay there in agony, awaiting the cold grip of an invisible monster to take me away.

When my dad finally arrived home and found me in the closet, I nearly stabbed him through the gut with that fire poker that I clung to with white-knuckled terror. I was inconsolable at this point, hysterical, panicked like a cornered wild animal.

We moved soon after that. 

My counselor wants to try hypno-therapy. She thinks it might help me remember more, that it could provide some answers as to why these memories are here. It might help me understand the trauma that could lead to why I have such fantastical memories. She doesn’t think they’re real, and I’m not sure they are either. On the one hand, the logical side of me knows these things shouldn’t be possible. On another level, I feel deeply that these events happened exactly as I recall them. My fear is certainly real.

I’m not sleeping well anymore. I’m having recurring nightmares of my mother, standing in the entryway of my bedroom, looking at me as I lay paralyzed in bed, unable to move as she slowly walks towards me. I always wake up before she gets to me.

My next therapy appointment is in a week. If anything relevant happens, I’ll try and write about it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Business-Hotel-1787/comments/1hz4tkv/hello_there/)
