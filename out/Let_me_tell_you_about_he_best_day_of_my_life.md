Okay guys I just have to tell someone it’s eating me up inside!

It all started when I was 19. I moved to a big city and lived in a bad part of town. I was all alone, bored, sad. I decided to get ice cream, my favourite! That’s when I met yucky old Brent. He came up to my booth and seemed sooo sweet. He even paid for my ice cream! He invited me back to his place. I know, I know, but I really needed a friend. And luckily Brent would introduce me to the best friend I would ever have. 

We got to his place and there were a couple girls there. So annoying! Giggly, wearing pink, you know the type. Brent started to get a little weird… he was pacing and muttering something I couldn’t hear. But I had nothing else to do so whatever, it was an adventure! Eventually the other girls left which was a big relief and Brent calmed down a bit.  He lit some candles and started chanting.. weird right! But nothing happened. I stood up to go cause to be honest I was little bored. Brent got up so fast and slapped me really hard! I saw stars which are my favourite and I was a little dizzy so I sat back down. Now if you are upset by SA please don’t read any further but it does get better! 

Brent came over and pulled my pants down. In the middle of the room I saw a little black bubble, tar,swirling with what I stupidly thought was glitter. Vesna says that’s dumb and that he brought the stars for me! How cool is that! The bubble got bigger and bigger and when Brent finished vasna finally came! 

Guys I can’t even describe him, he’s amazing. I try to draw him but I can never get it right. So far I have 3,243 pictures and they’re all garbage! I can’t get his eyes right, the mixture of sun and rain… full of those same swirling stars. his perfectly full lips, just the right side of pouty. His amazing hair! It’s hard because he doesn’t really have a body, just that swirling starry tar. He says it’s ok I’ll get it one day.  

Vasna never said anything that day. He put his hand on my shoulder and the next thing I knew I woke up in my bed! Amazing! I had a headache but Vasna says that’s normal and I better shut up about it, so I don’t complain anymore. 

I went back to sleep and this time I woke up in a clearing in the woods. That was a little weird cause I don’t know where any woods are in my city. There was 12 rabbits around me and 1 deer. Sadly they had all died somehow, there was a lot of blood! Something warm dripped from my hair and I had a weird taste in my mouth. Vasna says that’s fine and to get used to it. 

It didn’t take long until I wasn’t happy with rabbit and deer. Soon I wasnt happy with rats or household pets either. Then the news started taking about a murderer! How silly is that, Vasna isn’t a murderer! It did make my job a lot harder when people started locking their doors and buying cameras. But Vasna says he’ll take care of that and so far he has. I need to be more trusting! 

Anyway about 9 months after the little rabbit incident I had my daughter! If I’m being honest I don’t really like her. She’s 6 now and she cries all the time. So annoying! But Vasna says I have to shut the fuck up and do what he says. He’s so funny! 

Anyway I usually try to leave her with neighbours or the teens down the street but they’re getting so grumpy! Always saying I’m gone too long or they can’t reach me.. like shut up, it takes a village! Sure she cries all the time and never shuts up but that’s not my fault! I had to start leaving her at home. Don’t worry! She’s totally fine, the door is always locked and we all know there’s no murderer around. Vasna says they’re just trying to scare us and it won’t work! 

So best day of my life right after when I met Vasna happened today! I came home about 4 in the morning. She’s usually asleep so I can wash all the blood off but today she was awake. Ugh! Not what I wanted to deal with! 

But she looked at me and I saw the same stars in her eyes as Vesna has! I just about cried. That kind of black swirling tar. Omg omg omg! And she says to me 

“ Vasna says I can go with you now”
