Grocery shopping is supposed to be a safe, relatively non-difficult task. 

Where I work though? Not quite the case. 

Now, I wouldn’t say that my job is exactly dangerous, only that it has dangerous aspects to it. 

Are you looking for groceries for the week, some simple ingredients for dinner? 

Actually, scratch that. How would you like to shop with a monster capable of ending the world?

Those were two of the questions I was asked during my initial interview for this job. I laughed it off and said yes to both. 

At the time, I thought it was a simple light-hearted joke poking fun at how terrible some customers can be. How wrong I was.

Like I said before, the work I do isn’t inherently dangerous. It’s only the customers I encounter that end up being as such. 

I’m not huge on this job, but it has to work considering the fact that there isn’t a whole lot else you can do to make a decent living in this town.

Fallscean Market is a prolific (very loose use of the word) store located in the town of the same name. Imagine Walmart, but on quite a bit of a smaller scale. 

That’s sort of what we’re like. Similar to Walmart, actually, I do believe this store was built on a burial ground or something, because weird shit happens here.

What started as a simple part-time job for money has culminated in a never-ending cycle of near-cataclysmic events. 

Of course, that isn’t how it started, but you know how these things go. I’ll say one thing; $15.50/hr is not, has not been, and never will be worth what me and my coworkers went through.

 

**May 2025**

“Ack, dammit. It’s definitely going to rain.” I grumbled to myself as I looked overhead at the quickly forming storm clouds.

While Fallscean isn’t known for a whole lot, there is one thing; it rains here in April more often than it doesn’t. 

By the time I arrived at work, I was a good bit heavier than when I got out of school. Thank you, rain.

The clock read 3 PM and I already dreaded the rest of my shift. 

Rainy days are bad for business because our customers don’t like being attacked by the dumpster fish. 

It really kills the “I want to go shopping without a sea creature slapping me” vibe.

“Yo.” The word broke my dread-induced trance, and I looked to the right where I heard it from.

There, standing in all of his 6’1 glory, was my coworker Stephen. I call him Spike because it sounds cooler.

“Hey.” I said, uselessly rubbing my wet work-shirt. “Any activity at all today?”

He looked around the store and then back at me.

“Don’t look like it. You just get done swimming?”

“Very funny.” I replied and went to the grocery aisle to see if I could front anything.

I work the floor. Basically, I just go to the back, see what we need out front and bring however much of what we need out there. It gets boring very fast.

“It’s dark out today.” Spike said. I hadn’t realized he positioned himself… right next to me.

“Yeah, it is. Hey man, do you have some other work to do?” I said with an intentional hint of annoyance in my voice.

“Dude, the store has been like this all day. I’d bet my college savings that we won’t have a single customer for the rest of the time the store is open tod—”

Spike was cut off by an all too familiar sound; it was the ding of the automatic doors near the front of the store opening.

I looked at him with a grin.

“So, about those savings…”

“Yeah, yeah.” He said, getting up to move to the front. “Might be a group. You oughta come with me.”

I followed in his footsteps and began to approach the front of the store with him.

I thought up the greeting we always grace our customers with and introduced them to the store.

“Welcome to Fallscean Market, how may I help you gu—”

I stopped dead in my tracks.

“S—Spike, are you seeing this?”

“Yup.”  

I haven’t used hallucinogens or any form of psychedelics in my 17 years on this earth, so when I say that this was legit, I mean it.

What stood before my surprisingly reserved coworker and a very befuddled me, was a gaggle of what looked like gargoyles.

I leaned over and did my best to ask Spike a question.

“Dude—are they real?”

“They walked in here, Ollie. I don’t think something fake could do that.”

“Fair enough.”

I composed myself and finished our old greeting.

“—guys?”

There were 4 of them, and they were similar to us in every way, say for the fact that they were walking European waterspouts.

“Hmmmm.” The lead one croaked out. He was wearing a beanie with a hoodie and sweatpants. Real thug guy.

“A—are you looking for something in particular?” I asked.

“Hmmm—oh, yes, sorry. What do you have for snacks here? My companions are rather hungry, as am I.” He said, rubbing his stony chin with a finger of the same material.

“That depends, sir.” I replied. “What kind of profile are you looking for? Sweet? Savory? Umam—"  

“Sweets sound good, I think.” He replied.

“Okay. What type of sweets? We have candy, fruit if you’re into that, and baked goods.”

He looked around like he was lost. Hell, maybe he was. I gave him a few seconds to readjust himself. He did, and he replied to me.

“Baked goods.”

Okay, this was good. I led them over to the baked goods section of our store (just our bakery, I suppose). I showed them all of the different options.

They settled on cookies.

“Okay.” I said, rubbing my hands together. “What flavor of cookies are you in the mood for? We have classic chocolate chip; can’t go wrong with that, we have oatmeal raisin; they’re good, trust me, we have white chip and macada—”

“The oatmeal’s sound good. They seem comforting. You said oatmeal raisin, correct?”

“I did. Is something wrong?”

“Nope, nothing is wrong.”

“Okay. Oh, one more thing; what is that?”

“What’s…what?”

“Oatmeal.”

“You want to know what oatmeal is?”  

“Yes.”

“Uh—okay. It’s a—uh—a breakfast thing. Like—what you eat in the morning. A breakfast food.”

“Breakfast?”

“Yes. Usually have it in the morning? *Breaking* your fast?”

“Okay—what are raisins?”

“You being for real right now?” I replied with a hint of annoyance in my voice.

“Would I be asking if I wasn’t?” He replied with the same energy.

“Okay, fine. You ARE aware of what grapes are, yeah?”

“I am not.”

This was going to be a *long* shift.

“Okay. Grapes are fruit. Fruit is the edible part of a plant. A grape is a berry, which is a type of fruit. And raisins are dried grapes. Do you understand?”

“I think so, yeah.”

Finally, we actually looked over at the confections, particularly the cookies in question. The beanie gargoyle looked at me and spoke.

“Those look good.”

“They sure do. How many do you want?”

“How many do you have?”

“Like six, I think.”

“Okay; all of them.”

He grabbed all six containers which each contained six cookies.

“Party tonight?” I asked, looking incredulously at him.

“Sort of. Gonna try and make peace with the neighboring community.”

“And your neighbors. They’re uh—lemme guess… vampires?”

“Eh, I only know like one vampire, so no. They’re werewolves.”

Okay.

Spike finished ringing them up and they went on their merry way with a wave and a “thank-you”.

I walked up to him after all that with only one question.

“Hey man, what the hell was all that?”

“They were customers, Ollie. It’d be a bit weird if I didn’t ring them up.”

“Not that. Walking gargoyles come into the store and buy cookies, and you just act like it’s any other customer?”

“Yeah. They aren’t the strangest customers I’ve checked out, if it makes you feel any better.”

“Not really, man. Also, who could be the weirdest customer you’ve checked out? Bit of a high bar to meet.”

“I’ll tell you, just be sure to write it down or something, it’s pretty cool if you ask me.”

 

And that’s how I learned that we have a local cultist.

I’m not keen on keeping logs with anyone else, so I guess any stories from people other than me will be written by me… just not told from my perspective.

Anyways, this is Spike’s experience with a cultist.

 

It was, what—10 AM? I had just punched in for my weekend shift thinking that all would be well in the world that day.

For the most part, things did go well.

I’d say it was around 1:30 when this really strange dude came into the store. 

He was spouting some nonsense in a language I didn’t understand, but that wasn’t even the weirdest part.

He was wearing robes, and the word that came up the most in his ranting was “Mortis”, whatever that means.

Being the upstanding store assistant I was, I went to go and help him.

“Hello, sir. Welcome to Fallscean Market, how may I help you?”

He looked around frantically before locking eyes with me and talking.

“Ubi servas sacrificia tua?”

“Sorry, I don’t understand that. Can you speak English, possibly?”

I didn’t want to come off as rude or anything like that; I just couldn’t understand him is all.

“Non intelligis?”

“Again, sir, I cannot understand you.”

“Simiae stultus. Scilicet non intelligis.”

“I can pull up a translator on my phone. I think we’re having a bit of trouble here.”

I pulled up the translator on my phone and had him speak again.

It translated to Latin. Okay, this was progress.

I did the reverse and spoke into my phone from English to Latin.

“So, what WAS your question?”

“Domine bone. Ubi sunt sacrificia?”

Looking down at my phone, I saw the words translate roughly to “good lord, where are the sacrifices?”

I looked up at him. We didn’t sell those at the store, so I told him as much.

“Scilicet, simiae omnes idem es. Nihili.”  

That translated to “of course, you monkeys are all the same. Worthless.”

At this point, the man looked at me and pulled out what looked like a stick with a piece of quartz on it. I now know it was a catalyst.

Not sure of the physical logistics, but the dude managed to take his catalyst and burn a sigil into the air.

If anyone asks, that’s the weirdest customer I’ve ever had.

At this point, I stopped writing and had to look Spike in the eyes.

“Dude. How on Earth have we not died yet?”

“I dunno, just lucky, I guess.”

 

Spike and I aren’t the only ones unlucky enough to have applied here. There’s a girl, Lily. She’s like the 3/3^(rd) of me and Spike’s 2/3^(rd).

Anyways, one of the most major events to occur at the store was that of the cat and the power outage. I’ll write about it another time, because my shift is about to start.

 

My shift is about to start, and God knows what’ll come through those automated corporate doors.

-EDIT-

Changed some dates. Years and months tend to get mixed up when you work a job like mine.
