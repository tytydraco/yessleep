Once, 3 years ago,my 3 friends and I went to the mountains. 
We have a good time all day: had fun, drank, played cards, cooked food and many other things. Closer to the evening we were getting ready to go to bad, my friend Vika and I stayed in one room while our another two friends stayed in the room opposite ours. Everything was fine, nothing bad was foreseen.

After falling asleep, I woke at about 1 am and felt that somebody was in the room near me. At first I got scared a little bit but in a second I thought that it was one of boys who wanted to play tricks on us. The first thing I thought in that second was that one of the boys came to smear us with toothpaste, because I heard that children( they are not children) do this so often. After I opened my eyes I clearly saw a dark figure that was leaning on me from a half of meter distance. As our bed was near the window this dark black silhouette was clearly visible in a moon light. Again I was scared to death but managed to come down thinking that it was our friend. So I closed my eyes waiting to see what would happen next. At that time I thought that the next night I would throw a bucket of cold water on him or do some other harm. Because you can't scare like that, it's very scary. As nothing was happening even the slightest noise was heard I started to worry again as I felt someone’s presence. I decided to kick that place, to hurt this asshole who sits so quietly and scares me. To my astonishment, there was nobody… and I thought that I would die of fear. 

Terrified I turned on the light on my phone and lay for 2 minutes because she could not move from fear.  Than I started to woke up my friend whom i managed to woke up in five minutes. This five minutes was terrible, because I could not understand why she did not wake up. She turned on the light in the room said that there was nobody there and told me to go to sleep. I couldn’t fall asleep for one hour and rest of the night i spent cuddled to my friend because I felt terrified and vulnerable. 
In the morning nobody believed nmy story and said that I was imagining things. But I know for sure I felt somebody’s presence. 

P.S : Having returned home I couldn’t normally sleep for a 2 weeks in my room, as this figure was still in my head. Even now, almost 3 years later, I cringe when I think about it. 
P.S : Only my mother and my english teacher believed me, and I is sad that people think it's just a fiction in my head. And this applies not only to me, but also to everyone else who felt a similar feeling
