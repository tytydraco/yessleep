Transcript of the Audio Recording of the interview of Operative James Linman after the onset of incident 217. Further context can be found in Linman’s[ Field Report of Incident 212.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1f4hxuk/incident_report_212_the_spider/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Incident 217 officially began when four days after returning to work a week early, Operative Linman arrived to the facility seeming disoriented and in possession of twelve jarred eyeballs, mostly human, that he insisted he woke up surrounded by. Further context pending in reports from Lab Technician Clay Harding, who Linman sought out concerning the eyeballs and the entity that will be referred to as the Imposter going forward. 

Note from Transcriber: at the time of transcription, we are fairly certain this interview was conducted with the actual Operative Linman. However, Agent Nevarez in the field reporting office insists that it be noted that we cannot be certain until the nature of the Imposter is deduced.

**Morton** : Alright. It’s on. Are you ready?

**Linman**: \[Sigh\] I don’t know Lara, what do you think?

**Morton**: Look James, I \[overlapping\] just think this will be helpful to have on record.

**Linman**: This isn’t going to do what you \[overlapping\] what you want it to.

\[Static and silence, then a deep sigh. Rustling\]

**Linman**: Whatever. Just start.

**Morton**: You shouldn’t smoke in her-\[clears throat\] Nevermind.

**Morton**: Right. Operative Lara Morton, interviewing Operative James Linman regarding the events during his recovery after Incident 212. If you could state your name for the record?

**Linman**: Jesus. Really? 

**Morton**: Could you just \[overlapping\] do it?

**Linman:** Operative James \[overlapping\] Linman. Badge Number 173. Happy?

**Morton**: Yes. So. \[Sounds of shuffling paper\] You know the drill here, right?

**Linman**: I don’t love being on this side of the table. 

**Morton**: So tell me what happened so we can both leave. 

**Linman:** Oh, I’m sorry! Do you have somewhere to be?

**Morton**: Could you \[overlapping\] just please

**Linman**: yeah yeah \[overlapping\] I’m going, I’m going. Jesus. 

\[Sound of rustling fabric. Linman (?) exhales. Static. Extended silence.\]

**Linman**: Yeah, alright. So I’ve been having bad dreams that I can't quite remember. I know what you’d be thinking if this wasn’t its own incident report, right? Go on, say it.

**Morton**: PTSD?

**Linman**: Sure. Hell, I thought so too. I mean it happens. You go out into the field and most of the time its nothing. False alarms, baby haunts. So the times that it- that it is actually something, it’s terrifying. It’s traumatic. I was looking the other day- guess how many Field Operatives quit after their first encounter with an actual anomaly?

**Morton**: Oh, I don’t know..half?

**Linman**: \[sharp laugh\] Ninety Eight percent. Like 1.5 out of ten. Really a little less even than that, it’s probably closer to like 1.2 or something. I’m not exactly a numbers guy. The point is, it’s most. Just shy of all. And that same percentage is about how many stay on after their first year. 

**Linman**: That’s to say, most people either quit or die within three hundred and sixty five days of being hired. Because this job fucking sucks. How long have you been on, again?

**Morton**: Is this going somewhere…?

**Linman**: Just humor me. 

**Morton:** Probably about eight years. I got brought on when I was twenty..eight or so.

**Linman**: Wait- jesus.. \[laugher\] you’re thirty? I thought you were- okay, fine. I just- you’re older than I thought, sorry.

**Morton**: You’re just young, James. 

**Linman**: \[laughs\] Shit, I guess. Anyways, my point is that you and I are really the anomalies, if you think about it. Same goes for everyone we work with- even a lot of the desk jockeys bow out fairly early. Can’t take it. Can’t blame them. The actual Incidents are never fun. They’re almost always fucking horrifying. I’ve got something like twenty under my belt, I think. Which is high. Anomalies seem to like me. 

**Linman**: That’s the problem, I think. With..I mean with Not James. I think he took a liking to me. \[sharp inhale\] I’ve been dreaming about him. I mean, I think it’s dreams. Like I said, most of them I can't remember. So it’s uh..it’s hard to tell, harder to explain. I like to think I have a good grip on reality, ugly and twisted and inexplicable as it is. But these days?

**Morton**: Something Changed?

**Linman**: Ugh. Not- not in the way you’re thinking. I don’t think I’ve lost it. I think he- I think he’s messing with me. Stealing my time. Possibly my body. Maybe both. You read my report on 212? 

\[sound of paper shuffling\]

**Morton**: I have it. 

**Linman**: Great. So I’ll tell you what it says in there anyways- I’m absolutely certain that’s not a doppelganger. There’s just- it’s different. It’s totally different. The scale is..the scale is different. Anyways, anyways. Whatever, I- the point is that it’s different, okay? It’s not like he’s- I’ve never seen him again while I was awake, other people- other people see him and not me. I think maybe we swap But I only- it’s only when I’m sleeping that I see him. And except for the one, it’s so hazy.

**Morton**: The one?

**Linman**: Yeah. \[inhales\] Let me, jesus. Let me get to the actual-

\[Silence. Static. A loud exhale.\] 

**Linman**: So after they medically cleared me, they put me on paid leave of about two weeks for recovery. Sent me back home to my \[laughs\] my shitty apartment I spend almost no time at. You can tell as soon as you walk in there that it’s not lived in. Every time I get home I have to clean at least a month and a half’s worth of dust. It’s not quite a mattress on the floor situation, but it- \[laughs\] it’s pretty bare bones. 

**Linman**: So in the field you- you get good at rocking up somewhere and knowing something’s wrong. At least- I mean if you want to live you do, anyways. So when- \[laughs\] it sounds really dumb, but when I got home and the apartment was clean, it made me nervous. I cleared it and everything, like something out of a bad cop show. I mean- nothing was exactly out of place, but it wasn’t..It was like I had already been home. There were clothes in the dryer. Not warm or anything, but when I head out it’s pretty standard for me to make sure the washer, dryer, dishwasher and sink are empty. It's a matter of cleanliness, basically. But I always do it.

**Linman**: Really, I should have just trusted my gut and called it in, yeah? Let someone know, I guess. But I hate- oh god do I fucking hate sympathy. I didn’t - not that anyone would give me those awful concerned looks but I really didn’t want them to. I didn’t want to- I mean really, who would I even have called? 

**Morton**: James you can \[overlapping\] always call-

**Linman**: Jesus don’t \[overlapping\] just *don’t*, alright? That- that’s exactly what I was trying to avoid. Anyways- ANYWAYS- I pretty much. I mean I wasn’t hurt that badly by the spider besides a mild concussion, and I was absolutely exhausted, so I figured that maybe I was also a little paranoid after encountering Not James. Maybe I just forgot to empty the dryer, you know?

**Linman**: Well anyways when I slept that night I had a weird dream. I only dimly recalled it when waking up, but it was enough to unsettle me- it was cold. I remember that pretty distinctly, because when I sat up in bed I had to check if my fingertips were blue. My lips got so cold. Looking back I- eugh. I think it may have kissed me.  I don’t want to- Anyways. This went on for like three nights. I would wake up with a hazy recollection of my dreams and an impulse certainty that I had frostbite wherever he touched me. 

**Morton**: He?

**Linman**: I’m getting there. On the third day, I realized that it wasn’t- that it wasn’t just cold. It was also static. When- when I get scared my whole body goes numb, and sometimes even after it lingers in places like my legs and my fingertips. So there was- something in my dreams was scaring me so fucking badly that it stuck on my skin .And I only had this- this hazy outline of what it could have been. By then I was starting to get an idea that it had something to do with 212…but I didn’t want it to. Because there’s only one surviving entity from 212, and it’s not the one I would rather see again.

**Morton**: Ah. I see. The- the one you call Not James? 

**Linman**: Yeah.  I really should have called it in *then,* when I started suspecting that for real. But I figured it was just- well like I said earlier. PTSD. Nothing that wouldn’t pass. I've never had something follow me home, so I didn't think- I mean I know it's possible but I didn't really consider it possible, y'know? Stupid mistake.

**Linman**: I should say here that I'm not- as a necessity and a product of being gone all the time, I’m not close with my neighbors. I don’t even know what almost any of them look like, honestly. They’re just bodies to me. Maybe that’s harsh, but that’s the fact. So when I got stopped in the lobby by this- this spry kindof older man who called out to me in a reaaal familiar tone, I was- I mean I didn’t love that. 

**Linman**: He was nice enough, don’t get me wrong. But at some point I checked out of the conversation. Probably around when he asked me if I would reconsider going out with his granddaughter, since she needs a nice boyfriend like me.

**Morton**: \[laughs\] he said \[overlapping\] a NICE boyfriend? You? \[overlapping\] he used the word nice?

**Linman**: Would you \[overlapping\] that is not the actual problem there- would you \[overlapping\] oh my god I hate-

**Morton**: Sorry- sorry \[laughs\] I- ah \[sniffs\] oh man-

**Linman**: Hey Lara, I hate you.

**Morton**: Oh, oh \[sniffs\] I’m sorry. \[rustling\] Oh I need a tissue- so..so the issue…the issue besides him calling you nice-

**Linman**: \[testy\] The issue is I had never spoken to this man before and he asked me to \*reconsider\*.  You get the implication there. 

**Morton**: I do, yes. \[Rustling\]. Excuse me. Do you want a water?

**Linman**: No. Anyways I- I mostly just..I mean I auto piloted through the encounter til I could leave- I think he could tell that I was- I mean I think I might’ve looked uncomfortable.

**Morton**: I could imagine.

**Linman**: Yeah. Yeah. I’m not really. It’s funny, when I’m not at work- I’m not really suave. You’re seeing- I mean you're seeing it now I guess. I lose my charm when I’m not hunting something. When I’m the one- ah, fuck it. That’s not relevant. This is going too long already. 

**Morton**:  You have a habit of doing that. The preamble on the 212 report is around 300 words about your breakup.

**Linman**: That- \[laughs\] that's to spite Nevarez. He hates that shit. It’s funny. 

**Linman:** But alright, let me try and condense a little. I guess I had helped this old man with some repairs in his apartment…the week before.

**Morton**: You were unconscious then. 

**Linman**: Sure was. Well- I’m no handyman either, so I couldn’t help anyone repair anything. But supposedly I had helped this guy. So anyways I get back upstairs and I take a good look around the apartment. Now I- I mean I’m *really* looking for things that are off now. Obviously- obviously I have a chill creeping up my spine. I’m pretty sure I know what it is at this point- I mean- I met him. Me. Not James, whatever you want to call him.

**Linman**: So before I go to bed that night- I don’t know how much you..I mean we haven't ever worked together on an actual investigation. But if you were to contextualize what I do in terms of modern witchcraft I would be an eclectic or chaos witch, I guess it depends who you ask. 

**Morton**: I'm not that familiar with witchcraft.

**Linman**: \[laughs\] neither am I. I just don’t know what else to call it. It’s like this. I just do whatever the fuck I think might work. I’ll throw things at the metaphorical wall until something sticks. There’s no- I don’t do rituals, I don’t have a grimoire or anything like that, what I do is rob a bunch of different practices, ideas and concepts and break them and use the pieces to suit my needs. I-I’m the equivalent of the English language of witchcraft. I’ve never learned anything official in my life- every time I do something it’s a hail mary at best. It’s not a- it doesn’t make a lot of sense, and it’s not a rational thing. It’s..it’s like in the same way anomalies like me, the universe, magic, whatever..it likes me too, as long as I do shit that makes me look like I should be institutionalized when I call on it. 

**Linman**: So before I go to bed that night I go down to the corner store and I buy a hand mirror, and I tape it on the wall facing my bed. The idea I got in my head is that it- mirrors are considered portals and used for scrying, which lets you view things from a distance. So I- I pretty much thought that my dream would be reflected back more clearly into my memory, or something like that. And then I looked at my reflection and I told it, “You are going to be awake for us when I fall asleep. You’re gonna remember for me.” I mostly go off of feeling, but the thought process was more or less there. I felt..I mean given the situation it felt insane to make demands of my reflection. What if- what if it was him? But I mean, if it helped me remember my dream..

**Morton:** Did it work?

**Linman**: little too well, or we wouldn’t be having this chat. I might not have even realized it was him if it hadn't. So I fall asleep, and at first I think I’m waking up after an uneventful night. My spine is freezing, so that's how I’ve been waking up lately. But there’s- My eyes are closed, because there’s a very cold hand resting on my cheek. It feels like the grave. And I really- I didn’t want to open my eyes and see what was touching me in my own goddamn home. 

**Linman**: But I mean. You know pushing past fear is the first thing you learn on the job. So I very slowly opened my eyes, and sure enough, there he was. Sitting over me, caressing my face. “James,” he said, in a real sweet way that I don’t like hearing from myself, “How are you feeling?”

**Linman**: \[scoffs\]. Can you believe- I mean this- whatever it is, he’s stolen my face and- and he’s asking me how I feel?? So I told him…I don’t remember my exact words but-

**Morton**: Wait, you? In- hold on. In all the time I’ve known you, you have never failed to smugly recount your exact words.

**Linman**: \[agitated\] God- well I can't this time, okay? 

**Linman**: Look, suffice to say, I told him how I felt. And it- it..I don’t know. It was unsettling, because the vibe I got from him, it..god it’s an *it*, okay? I- the vibe I got was..was very affectionate. Very tender. He’s wearing my own fucking face and treating me like I’m-, do you know how- it’s unsettling, Lara. He was comforting *me*. Said that he had- that it had told me before that it could be helpful. That since I had- since I had seemed like I wanted help, it was going to help. That I needed-

\[silence, static. A long inhale.\]

**Linman**: In my report, I said that if it replaced me, I wasn’t sure anyone would be able to tell the difference. And Now I know I’m right, because he- *it*, goddamnit, caught me up on what it’s been doing. Just fucking told me, like- like it would be comforting if I knew. So-

\[the recording is cut off by loud, overwhelming static that lasts for approximately a minute and twelve seconds\]

**Linman**: -all around me. Just…twenty or so. In jars. Where did I- where did it get them? I think it- I don’t know. I think he told me, I kindof remember- but then when I try and actually remember it's like \[static\] or something. It’s like he distorts the world around him. I’ve never heard of a \[loud static\] or anything like it before. I was only able to grab- I mean I didn’t grab them all, you know. There was twenty or so, but some of them- when I was gathering them they just vanished, right as I was touching them so I-

 \[loud, crackling static, approximately forty nine seconds\] 

**Linman**: And I swear I asked Clay about it almost five times, but every time he has no idea what I’m talking about. I’m not even- I’m not even sure you’re going to remember this interview, Lara. And that makes me- \[hushed\] it scares me.

**Morton**: That's why we’re recording it, James. Someone in Interior is gonna transcribe it, too. I- I Imagine it’s been very stressful, but we’re going to find a solution.

**Linman**: \[laughs\] stressful? I spent three days asleep and yet everyone says I was back at work early. Everyone remembers conversations with me that **I** never had. I- Nevarez told me I’ve been especially pleasant lately. Me! You get- It’s a little beyond stressful. I swear I was \[static lasting approximately thirty seconds\] -don’t even remember having before. I’m telling you, it's not me. Look, I'm going to show you something. See this? It- \[loud static for approximately twenty seven seconds\]. If you- if you don’t see that, It. It's. Not. Me. 

**Morton**: Alright, James. Well, we’ll have you sleep- I mean we’ll have you sleep on site until we figure this out, I think. 

**Linman:** I don't..\[sighs\]. You know the absolute best case scenario here is that it’s…it’s a separate creature. Worst case and it’s inside me. I- I don’t know that if it’s the latter that you’ll be able to get it out. Or even tell. Since the \[static\] will still be on \[static\].

**Morton**: Let’s…let's not worry about that, James.

**Linman**: Well I’m fucking worried, so. 

**Linman**: I can’t wake up like that again. I- you know, I can handle a lot of things. But that many eyes?! All looking at me.. I- just…

\[Exhale. Static. Crackling, a distorted voice in the static. It seems to be saying ‘there there’ or ‘I’m here’. Unclear.\] 

**Linman**: god, I’m fucking exhausted. Do you need anything else? 

**Morton**: No…I think that’s all. 

\[Rustling, then the recording ends. End transcription\]

Post Note: Incident 217 is still open. Operative Linman fell asleep under the observation of Operative Morton and Supervisor Theodore Whitman. From 01:37 to 01:45 MST the facility experienced a brief power outage. Linman slept soundly through that period. Shortly after, Operative Morton requested a re-review of the transcript, as she could not recall the exact marking Linman had informed her of. Unfortunately, the transcript audio is semi-corrupted. Upon review, Morton could not recall any of the contents of the corrupted audio. Linman is currently under observation, but presumed to be the Impostor due to an abundance of caution.

The Investigation Status is Ongoing.
