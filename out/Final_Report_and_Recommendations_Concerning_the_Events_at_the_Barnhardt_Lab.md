This firm has been retained to investigate the circumstances concerning the closure and suspension of research at Barnhardt Laboratory (the “Lab”) following a series of tragic and mysterious events. Based on my investigation, I conclude that the Lab not only **should remain closed indefinitely**, but also that **all research and research notes should be permanently erased and all devices completely destroyed**. The explanations for these conclusions are set forth below.

I should also note that for reasons that will be explained later most of this report is being prepared using dictation (speech-to-text) software that I acquired only a few days ago and have had limited opportunity to learn let alone master, and that I also have limited ability to proofread the results, and as such I apologize in advance for any inadvertent errors.

Separately, this report is simultaneously being published publicly on the social media site Reddit. While this is likely in violation of my professional confidentiality obligations, I nonetheless feel that my findings necessitate public exposure so as to ensure that they are not ultimately disregarded. Stop recording Jesus Christ I hope those greedy bastards listen resume recording

**Background**

The Lab itself is a workspace located within the Pupin Physics Laboratories (“Pupin”) on the campus of Columbia University. Prior to the events earlier this year, it was the primary location where Dr. Benjamin Barnhardt (“Barnhardt”), formerly the Douglas E. Cooper Chair of Columbia’s Department of Physics, conducted experiments in furtherance of his research into subatomic dimensional space. In this research, Barnhardt frequently collaborated with Associate Professors of Physics Dr. Yevgeny Bulgakov (“Bulgakov”) and Dr. Helena Cho (“Cho”), as well as Ph.D. candidates Lamar Smith (“Smith”) and Akiko Tanaka (“Tanaka”). It is believed that Smith and Tanaka were engaged to be married prior to their untimely deaths.

A publicly available abstract of one of Barnhardt’s papers is included in the appendix to this report as an exhibit. His research – to the extent I am able to understand it with a layman’s understanding of advanced theoretical physics – involved exploration of theoretical subatomic (Barnhardt apparently bristled at the term “quantum”) dimensions beyond the four dimensions of spacetime with which we are familiar. Current models believe that these dimensions are compressed or “wound” upon themselves so that they cannot be readily perceived at our scale. Barnhardt’s most well-known works were proposed mathematical models for “unwinding” these dimensions so that they could be perceived and even potentially accessed by humans. 

Although highly theoretical, Barnhardt believed that this research might ultimately lead to accessing inter-dimensional resources at a stellar or galactic scale, and as such had several potential applications in fields like energy and resource mining. Others speculated that such power would have obvious military applications. In any event, this research was potentially extremely valuable and extremely dangerous, and as such has been kept under very tight security prior to this report. Stop recording fuck them and their secrets okay resume recording

**The First Event**

On Thursday, April 10, 2025, at 9:23 AM, the system recorded Cho swiping her security card to enter the Lab. For various unremarkable reasons, no one else was working in the Lab that day. Security cameras did not record her leaving the Lab. She was never seen again.

After several attempts to contact Cho with no response, the matter was reported to the police, and subsequently to the federal agents who were responsible for the security of the project. Barnhardt – who was the first person in the Lab the day after Cho went missing – was interviewed on Wednesday, April 16, 2025. The agents’ notes of his interview and final report are included as an exhibit. Bulgakov, Smith, and Tanaka were also interviewed, but were not at the Lab on April 10 or 11 and were not able to provide much information.

According to Barnhardt, when he arrived at the Lab that morning everything appeared to be in order, and there was no sign of Cho, although he said he had no reason to know she hadn’t left the night before, or expectation that she would still be there. On further questioning he said that some of the equipment was “acting odd,” but he said he could not explain to the agents why that was in a way they would be able to understand. When asked if there were signs of a struggle, he said no, then backtracked and said that some items near Cho’s workstation looked like they might have been physically disturbed as if “knocked about,” but that nothing appeared to be missing. The agents described Barnhardt’s demeanor as “shifty,” but did not deem him to be a suspect in the disappearance at the time.

The agents’ attempts to investigate the Lab itself were blocked by Barnhardt, who informed their superiors that the Lab equipment was too delicate for any untrained personnel to access. The agents ultimately concluded that Cho’s disappearance was likely a kidnapping – possibly by hostile foreign agents – and referred the matter back to the police. The NYPD detectives I spoke with in connection with this investigation stated that the case is still open but that there have been no further leads.

**The Second Event**

On Friday, June 4, 2025, at approximately 5:30 PM, Bulgakov departed the Columbia campus, turned south on Broadway, and proceeded south on Broadway, likely towards the 116th Street subway station, from whence he routinely commuted to his home in Washington Heights. However, security cameras did not record him entering the station, and he never arrived home. As with Cho, he was never seen again.

Bulgakov’s disappearance was noted much more swiftly than Cho’s stop recording because she was a woman of color resume recording and on Monday, June 7, police and federal investigators arrived on campus to investigate. In the days that followed, Barnhardt, Tanaka, and Smith were all interviewed on the record, along with various other campus personnel. The transcripts of the interviews are included as exhibits.

Both Smith and Tanaka stated that Bulgakov had been acting out of character for several days prior to his disappearance. Tanaka stated that Bulgakov – who before had been known for his warm and jovial personality – had become “agitated,” and that he had taken to frequently “muttering” to himself in Russian. Smith described Bulgakov as acting strangely, that his eyes would constantly dart around, and sometimes he would react or flinch as if he saw or felt something that wasn’t there.

Both Tanaka and Smith also stated that they had witnessed Bulgakov and Barnhardt arguing. Smith said that he had heard them arguing “once” and that it was not about “anything important,” while Tanaka said that they had argued “several times” about the direction of the research, the experiments, and the use of a device Tanaka identified as the “Reel.” Stop recording why didn’t they ask more questions about the reel Jesus this all could have been avoided resume recording

The agents’ notes state that Barnhardt initially refused to be interviewed without counsel present, and only relented in exchange for a representation that he was not a suspect. Barnhardt is described as “highly agitated” and “anxious,” and both interviewing agents noted that his eyes constantly moved throughout the interview. They also noted that he appeared highly unkempt, as if he hadn’t showered for days, and that his eyes were sunken and bloodshot as if from lack of sleep and/or alcohol consumption. Once again, Barnhardt vehemently refused to allow the agents to access the Lab, and apparently his appeal to their superiors was once again effective.

As with Cho, Bulgakov’s disappearance was ultimately determined to be a likely kidnapping, and additional security measures at Pupin were implemented, including armed guards and additional alarms within the complex. However, Barnhardt continued to refuse access to the Lab to anyone but himself, Smith, and Tanaka, and as such no further security measures were implemented within the Lab itself stop recording as if they would do any fucking good resume recording

**The Shooting**

On July 7, 2025, at approximately 10:47 AM, security personnel at Pupin reported hearing gunshots. After initiating shooter protocol, security personnel and armed guards investigated the shots, which were determined to have come from the Lab. Due to protocols implemented by Barnhardt, security personnel were initially unable to enter the Lab, and had to wait over an hour before IT personnel were able to overcome the security system and gain entry.

Upon entering the Lab, personnel found the bodies of Barnhardt, Smith, and Tanaka, all with gunshot wounds, Barnhardt’s apparently self-inflicted. Emergency medical personnel declared all three dead at the scene, with Barnhardt near the worktable and Smith and Tanaka crouched together against the wall. It appears likely from the medical reports – included as exhibits – that Smith and Tanaka died from loss of blood, and that the delay in accessing the Lab likely contributed stop recording uhhhhhh Jesus resume recording

The medical reports conclude that Smith and Tanaka likely could have survived their wounds if emergency personnel had been able to reach them sooner.

Authorities were notified immediately, and state and federal forensics teams examined the crime scene. All relevant reports are attached as exhibits. Based on available evidence, the detectives concluded that Barnhardt had most likely been firing wildly, with bullet holes at all angles in the walls, floor, and ceiling. The reports conclude that Smith and Tanaka were likely not intended targets It does not appear that Smith and Tanaka were intended targets, but simply caught fire during Barnhardt’s shooting spree.

Following the shooting and forensic examination, the Lab was sealed to all parties, and remained so until this investigation began in August.

**The Initial Investigation**

My firm was contacted in late July 2025 by Continental Underwriting Inc. (“Continental”), Columbia’s liability carrier, to investigate the events of the Lab and determine whether it would be safe to reopen and resume the research therein. Although my practice is not primarily insurance litigation the matter was referred to me by Walter Concepcion stop recording fuck you Walter you son of a bitch resume recording

The head of our casualty practice. In the context of my investigation I interviewed the federal agents and numerous campus staff, and collected and reviewed data and documents from Barnhardt, Bulgakov, Cho, Smith, and Tanaka (collectively, the “Barnhardt Group”)’s office computers, email accounts, and personal phones. After confirming that no toxic environmental hazards were present within the Lab, I obtained access to the Lab and took possession of hard drives, lab journals, notes, and other materials. I also examined hardware found within the Lab, as will be discussed later in this Report. Relevant documents and transcripts are included as exhibits.

The research and notes are quite frankly too complex for a layperson to understand. I was in the process of retaining an independent expert to opine on this matter when the Lab was deemed nontoxic and safe ha oh no stop recording wait resume recording

Safe for entry. Ultimately no such expert was retained. To the best I can determine, the Barnhardt Group had developed a prototype device for “unwinding” subatomic dimensions, which Bulgakov likened to unspooling line on a fishing reel, hence the "Reel." Besides this loose description, no diagram or description of the Reel exists anywhere in the emails or office documents, and indeed it appears that Barnhardt instructed the other members of the Group to delete any such materials from any sources that were not physically within the Lab.

Emails and text messages recovered from the Barnhardt Group indicate that all parties began experiencing some degree of emotional agitation beginning in roughly January 2025, when a prototype version of the device known as the Reel appears to have first been created. Smith notes that he and Tanaka were never allowed to operate the Reel, ostensibly because Barnhardt thought it might emit harmful radiation, but Smith believed Barnhardt was paranoid and suspicious that someone might try to steal it.

In an email dated March 13, 2025, Cho states that she’s been “seeing things,” and asks Barnhardt and Bulgakov if they’ve experienced anything similar. Barnhardt responds “Nothing like that, you should get some rest.” Bulgakov does not respond, but in a text message dated later that same day he says “I’ve been telling Ben \[Barnhardt\] about seeing things but he doesn’t want to talk about it and gets mad when I bring it up. Last time he threatened to remove me from the project. It’s probably best to keep quiet for now.”

On March 25, Cho texted Bulgakov again. “It keeps happening and it’s not going away. Right at the edge of my vision where I can’t really see them. Then when I turn to look they’re gone.” Bulgakov replies, “I am trying to figure out what they are and how to stop it. Ben won’t say so but I think he’s trying too. Just do your best to ignore.”

On April 7, Cho texted Bulgakov at 11 PM. “Something just touched me. I felt it. I’m alone in bed and I felt something touch me. I think it’s them.” Bulgakov replies, “There's no way they could touch you. It’s your imagination. Have a drink and go back to bed.” Cho replies “I don’t think I can go back to sleep. They’re bigger now.”

On April 10 – the day of her disappearance – beginning at 4 PM, Cho texted Bulgakov “Come to the lab please.” Then there are 3 unanswered calls at 4:06, 4:08, and 4:09, followed by another text: “Pickup please”. Then there are 2 more unanswered calls at 4:10. At 4:20 Bulgakov calls back, but the call is not answered. He texts “everything ok?” at 4:21, then tries to call 2 more times. No response. He tries to call 4 more times over the next several days, none of which are answered. 

On Monday, April 14, Bulgakov texts Barnhardt “I haven’t heard from Helena in days. Please check on her.” Barnhardt does not respond.

On Wednesday April 16, immediately after his interview with the federal agents, Barnhardt calls Bulgakov, and they talk for 48 minutes. Immediately afterwards, Bulgakov calls his mother in Vladivostok, and they talk for 2 hours and 23 minutes.

Following that April 16 call, the tone of Barnhardt and Bulgakov’s communications change. Whereas prior they had often chatted about non-work events – sports, movies, and so forth – from April 16 until Bulgakov’s disappearance they only communicate about work, and then only as to administrative or logistical matters. Meanwhile, Bulgakov’s calls to his mother become more frequent, as many as 3 per day despite the significant time difference.

There is no way to know what was discussed in these phone calls, but on June 1, Bulgakov messages his mother via WhatsApp. The conversation (as translated from Russian) is as follows:

Bulgakov: “It keeps getting worse no matter what I do. It is so bad now. I’m going crazy.”

Mother: “Come home Zhenya.”

Bulgakov: “I can’t. I have to stop them. He does nothing. The students are in danger.”

Mother: “I love you Zhenya.”

Bulgakov: “I love you mamasha.”

On June 2, Bulgakov emails Barnhardt. The subject line says “If I go like Helena, it is your fault”. The body of the email is empty. Barnhardt does not respond.

Smith and Tanaka’s messages do not indicate any awareness of the phenomenon Cho and Bulgakov were experiencing, but they are replete with concerns about the mood in the Lab, the nature of the work they were doing, and (later) Cho and Bulgakov’s disappearances. Both Smith and Tanaka suggest leaving the program at various points, with various suggestions as to who they could continue their studies with. Smith in particular seems concerned that Barnhardt is “fucking nuts.”

As for Barnhardt himself, his computer, phone, and email accounts show a suspicious lack of relevant documents, suggesting that he deleted all relevant material prior to the shooting incident.

**Physical Inspection of the Lab**

On September 4, 2025, our environmental contractor confirmed that the Lab was safe to enter, and on Monday, September 8, the Lab was unsealed and I physically entered the premises. Power to the Lab was turned off as a safety precaution, which inadvertently created a separate safety issue due to the darkness inside. I proceeded with a flashlight.

The Lab itself is a relatively unremarkable space, or at least would likely appear so in normal lighting, with a large worktable covered with assorted devices and materials, smaller tables set up as desks, two small closed-off spaces that appeared to be unused offices, and various pieces of equipment scattered about. The bloodstains from the shooting had been cleaned up by the forensics teams, but the bullet holes were still clearly visible. 

I could not convince campus personnel to join me in the Lab, and security clearance could not be arranged on short notice for any more attorneys or paralegals from my firm, so the compromise we reached was that I would remove any materials I wanted for the investigation to outside the Lab, from whence they would be tagged for identification and transported to my office. Thus my time in the Lab was mostly spent in physical labor, carrying equipment, hard drives, lab journals, and other materials to the hallway.

Once I finished with the main room, I inspected the unused offices. The first contained little beyond a well-used easy chair and a Nerf basketball hoop, although I did find an old iPod amongst the chair cushions. I took the iPod to the door and placed it with the other materials for delivery to my office. The second was somehow even darker inside, such that the light from my flashlight seemed to fade in the darkness. Out of habit I reached for a light switch, and upon finding one I flicked it on.

I remember hearing a whirr of machinery and feeling the sensation of being near electricity, and I saw a – the only word I can use for it is a “color,” even though that seems impossibly insufficient for something I would describe as a greenish-purplish-orange, with highlights of bright black. The Color permeated everything, and my body felt stretched and distorted, bent at impossible angles.

And above all else, I remember feeling that I was being watched.

The next thing I remember is bright lights, and waking up in somebody’s office. I am told that I was found much later by campus security after they had worked up the courage to go looking for me. A nurse examined me and pronounced me unharmed, and said that I probably collapsed from the physical exertion of moving the computers and equipment. Suitably chagrined from this assessment of my physical fitness, I headed home.

**Further Investigation and Conclusions**

The materials from the Lab were both much more detailed and much more complicated and technical than what I had been able to obtain prior, and trying to make sense of anything was incredibly difficult. The situation was exacerbated by a feeling of general unease I was starting to develop from working on this case. A constant feeling that someone was right behind me.

And then there was the eye problem. Since my experience in the Lab, I had started seeing things in the extreme periphery of my vision; but like a floater in my sclera, when I turned to look it would be gone, and a different speck would appear on the other side. Always just out of sight, unable to see clearly.

As the days went by and I spent more and more time on the documents and schematics I’d recovered from the Lab, I realized that the “unused office” I had entered WAS the Reel, and the “light switch” had activated it even though the power was cut off to the Lab. In Bulgakov’s notes he states that AC current would likely interfere with the operation of the Reel, and drew a mock-up of a battery array to power the device, featuring 27 car batteries and indicating more might be needed. Some battery!

Meanwhile my eye problem was getting worse. The little floaters were growing larger, becoming shapes, shapes the color of the Color, although there was still no way to see them clearly. They were still always at the periphery, always just out of sight. But also always present.

I found the iPod I had recovered from the chair at the bottom of a box, and after locating an appropriate charger and pair of headphones gave it a listen. To my surprise it contained a series of voice memos from Barnhardt – over 100 hours all told. I gave it to our IT department to process, date stamp, and transcribe. Some of the relevant transcripts are included as exhibits.

To my surprise, I found that I enjoyed listening to Barnhardt’s voice memos, at least at first. He had the pleasant elocution of an experienced lecturer, and was clearly intending these recordings for posterity. The initial recordings in particular were full of optimism in the project and joy at the progress his team had made in the construction of the Reel. I began listening to his mini-lectures in bed at night to relax, as between the eye problem and general anxiety I was having problems sleeping.

But the tenor of the recordings changed, even as my eye problem got worse. Starting in April 2025, Barnhardt began describing seeing things in the corner of his vision, “when I turn to look it’s gone, but just as fast another appears at the other extreme. I can’t ever see them well enough to make out what they are, but they make me feel … uneasy.”

That uneasy feeling … By this time the shapes were larger, about the size of a basketball held at arm’s length, at the very periphery of my vision. Not that I could see them well enough to identify them as basketballs or anything else.

Barnhardt sounded increasingly concerned in his voice memos. “The things at the corners of my eye, the phantoms, whatever they are, they are getting bigger. Or possibly closer. I can’t see them move, I’ve never seen them move, but they are definitely larger now. I can sense there are details there to make out, if I could only somehow see them directly. And that sense of uneasiness, that sense of malice, gets stronger every day.”

To Barnhardt’s credit, he was still a scientist first and foremost. He speculated on the nature of his “phantoms” at length. “It must be something to do with how light wends its way through the dimensions, we can only perceive it at odd angles, that’s the only way our brains can make sense of what they are processing. That’s my hypothesis. Still, it’s unnerving as hell. It feels like they are watching me.”

It did feel like being watched, or even being followed. And it was becoming hard to focus on much of anything else. I had a motion hearing for another matter and the judge yelled at me for not answering one of his questions, but I could barely hear what he was saying.

“Helena is gone. They are calling it a kidnapping, but I think they got her somehow. Got her and pulled her through. I don’t know how it could be possible, but it seems to be the most likely explanation. That would mean my hypothesis is correct, and these are some kind of – beings – but what do they want with us? Why are they trying to make contact? And how do we stop it?”

Beings. They were definitely bigger now, leering just beyond my shoulders. From the corner of my eye I imagine I can even see faces, even expressions on those splashes of Color, but of course there is nothing there when I turn. My dreams are filled with those malevolent unseen faces, figures moving closer, claws outstretched.

“We thought we could access these dimensions, these sub-universes, and harness them, pull from them what we wanted – but what if it’s the other way around? Once the door is open, how do we stop them from taking what they want? And what do they want? We called it the Reel, but we should have called it the Beacon, for as much as we lit it up to show them the way.”

I had to stop going into the office. It was too terrifying to be outside, too many things moving at the corners of my vision, some of which even existed. I explained to the managing partner that I was working on the Columbia investigation and it was taking all of my time. She said I could work from home, but she seemed hesitant. I suppose I’ve looked better.

“They got Yevgeny. I thought that the electromagnetic radiation we were generating would be enough to keep them away from the lab, and I might even have been right, but they just grabbed him on the way home. No reason to think they could only pull people from the lab. Shortsighted. Too late to cancel the project, not without explanations they won’t believe. I have to find a way to stop them, and soon. I think I felt something touch me.”

It's hard to know what’s in my head and what’s real at this point. Last night I could have sworn I felt something brush my face, there and not there. It makes it hard to focus, to remember to sleep, to eat. It’s hard to pay attention to anything, those damnable faces I can see and not see, the Color looming ever closer, but still always just out of sight.

“I have a plan. It’s a desperate plan, but I’ve reached the point of desperation. If they can touch us, that suggests that we can touch them in return. All I can do is fight back and try to get them, get them before they get me, or get Lamar or Akiko or someone else. If anyone is listening to this, it means I failed. Not in my research – in my research I succeeded beyond my dreams – but I failed in the end.”

I used to know a mob lawyer who told me that every lawyer in New York was a mob lawyer, whether they knew it or not. Maybe the truth isn’t that bad, but I admittedly did not have to venture far through my contacts to find a guy who knew a guy, a doctor who for the right amount would ignore his oaths and not ask too many questions. I remember looking up from his makeshift operating table knowing full well that his masked face was the last I would ever see, and feeling nothing but relief that I'd never see the phantoms again.

So now I sit here blind – blessedly so, blessedly free – speaking to a machine in the hopes that those who read this will know that there is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, only the grasping claws of madness reaching to consume whatever they can touch. Close the Lab, destroy the research, and above all destroy the Reel, and close this door once and for all.

Stop recording god they feel like hands they are so cold so cold
