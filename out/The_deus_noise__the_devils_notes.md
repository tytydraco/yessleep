It started a few years ago, YouTube recommended me a weird video- A video about unboxing a “dibbuk box”, I had no idea what the video was about at first, since it had no title or description.

I watched the video, the person in the video was unboxing a “dibbuk box” … you know, it was obviously fake.

The box was covered with red wax, like many others, and when he finally opened it, I had a chilling sensation.

Well, I don’t believe in these things, and it’s just a video on my phone, so it’s his problem anyway.  
He opened the box, and inside was a mirror, so the one and only thing that he saw inside the box, was his own face, then- he flipped the mirror, and behind it there was one word “deus”.

The video ended shortly after, it had no title, and I forgot about it and went to work.  
I couldn’t get this video out of my head, I kept thinking about it, obsessively.

Eventually, I decided to look at the video again, I couldn’t find it, not in history, not with keywords like “dibbuk” and “unbox”, nothing, and it wasn’t in anonymous mode, so it should have appeared in history tab.

Weird, I had to go again and I kinda forgot about it.  
We later had dinner together, then I heard a faint noise, like if someone has pressed a few notes on a piano altogether. I asked everyone at the table about it, nobody heard anything.

I left the table, rushed outside the front door, nothing, no sound, all looks normal now.  
I went back to the table, they asked me if I am feeling alright, I told them I do.

A few days later, it happened again.  
I was sitting with a friend at a restaurant, and then I heard it again… the same noise, it wasn’t a nice or normal noise, it was a low-tone noise, again the same musical notes, this time somewhat louder.

I have a friend who has a lot of knowledge in music, and he plays a piano. I pressed on the piano keys to try and mimic what I hear… he was in shock, he rushed away and brought a book with him, and he told me that it resembles “Hell Waltz”, which was made in the 1600s about a creature named “Asmodeus”.

>*”Asmodeus”? What is that?*

He explained to me that it’s a demon, the worst one, but that’s just a myth, a legend. He kept asking me about the noise that I heard, and if I kept hearing it.  
I lied, I told him no, that it only happened once and never again, but it did… and the noise became more audible.

Fast forward, 2 weeks, I am alone at my house.  
I get a flashback from the video, it said “deus” on the back of the mirror… but it made no sense. That’s a legend, and either way, I was just watching it on my video.

I tried to focus on other things, tried to ignore it, but the noises kept coming. I went to a hearing doctor, no issues, no tinnitus.  

I am not sure what is happening, but I am the only one to hear that noise, and I don’t understand what’s happening!

After 2 days it happened again, I went back from the mall, put my stuff on the floor and went to take a shower, and before I could even realize- the noise happened again, stronger than ever, crippling, I then decided that I have to learn more about the meaning behind “Asmodeus”.

It wasn’t like in the movies, there are no wikipedia guides on how to tell a demon to leave you alone. That wasn’t a Hollywood movie. I couldn’t find the video, I couldn’t find anything about the “deus” noise, all I knew was that I need help. I then went to the bathroom to wash my face, and I saw that I was bleeding… from the ears…. 

Whatever that noise was, it started to take effect on my body, I washed it off but then the noise came again, and the bleeding was even more intense.

Panicking, I went to the ER, they had no idea what happened, I never told them about this, they ran every test and couldn’t find any medical explanation for it.

I went back home, tired and scared. Googling for hours, eventually I found someone in a forum, in the deeps of the internet, having the same story as mine, he kept saying:

>*”If you hear it, don’t answer, don’t make a sound- don’t let him know you are listening, you have to survive 50 days.”

“50 days?” I thought to myself, it’s already been around a couple of weeks, I must gather my strength and keep going, at least there’s hope.

The noises kept coming, back and forth, sometimes for longer times, sometimes louder, it really distracted me, I was having ear bleed often, but my only goal was to end those 50 days.

It’s the last day of this nightmare, it will be over soon.  
I kept silent, waiting for it to end, not telling anyone about this, it’s almost 50 days, just a few more minutes.

Then it happened, the loudest noise I have ever heard, I could swear that it could have shattered windows, I couldn’t even hear afterwards, the noise lasted for a minute or two, it stopped, it ended, the 50 days are over, or at least I hoped so.

A month went by, no noises since, no devil’s notes… nothing.  
I have completely forgotten about it, I opened youtube to watch a video, and then it happened… youtube recommended me a new video from the same creator, no title, it was just another dibbuk box in the thumbnail.

I pressed “Do not recommend me of this channel”.  
I put my phone on the table and left the house for a walk outside.
