Honey. If you're listening to this, I just want to say I love you.. I know I may likely not survive so.. I'm going to record this for you. I'm going to tell this exactly how it happened.. That's the least I can do. 

&#x200B;

I'm not going to lie to you. I've always hated Halloween. All of the screaming, the dumb costumes, the fake scares. call me paranoid but if something bad really does happen whos going to know? irresponsible is what it is.

The night of Halloween this year was even worse. I was sitting in my chair by my door ready to scare off any solicitors. Then I heard it, the knocking. I got up and looked through the peephole and saw 6 teens dressed up. half of them were "ghostface" I think and the rest were a mix of vampires and zombies.

"Trick or Treat!" I heard them say through the door.

These fucking trespassers.

"Get off my fucking prop-"

I slammed the door. shaking. I locked it and began running towards my room almost tripping on the carpet. I can barely begin to describe what I saw. opening the door I saw 6 horrid creatures, ones face was stretching and I mean stretching. that things head was contorting in ways the skull shouldn't allow. and god that's not even the worst part. their eyes.. it felt like they were burning into my soul. even without pupils I could feel how absolute their hate was. 

Fumbling into my drawer I grab my magnum revolver and some lose bullets. shoving them into my pockets I run to the kitchen counter and prop my gun up.

&#x200B;

"GET.. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE ILL SHOOT." I said unable to hide the terror in my voice.

&#x200B;

"Open the door Jeremiah." they all say in almost perfect unison"

&#x200B;

How the fuck did those things know my name?? god. I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

&#x200B;

After a couple of minutes the slamming and screaming finally stops.

..

Putting my revolver down onto the table, I rub my eyes. 

&#x200B;

\*\***THUMP**\*\* 

&#x200B;

I hear the door splinter under the pressure. I pick my gun up before I hear it. All of them at once gasp in a almost rhythmic howl. for a second.. it was beautiful.

&#x200B;

\*\***CRASH**\*\* 

&#x200B;

Now the entire door collapses and the horrid creatures fumble over themselves. I hear a mixture of cries, laughing and screams. I take the first shot nailing the thing right in the neck. it falls over causing the rest of the monsters to fall to the ground as well

\*mamma..\*

Did it just speak.. did it just.. that doesn't matter right now I need to focus or I'm a dead man. I take three more shots 2 of them hitting its chest. it falls over onto itself wheezing. at this point the rest of the four were almost on top of me. I fall onto my back kicking one of them in the chest. I could hear the ribs crack under the pressure of my boot.

My grimace moves way to a slight smile. Getting up I continue to slam my boot into its skull. each hit felt like heaven as its skull fractured into pieces. I reached for the knife block and one of them bite me. the absolute disgust I felt when its disgusting teeth sunk into my arm was immeasurable. I grabbed the knife from the block and sunk it into its neck. All the fear and adrenaline I once had was completely gone. I was calm.

The Two that were left looked at me in what seemed like horror. "good." I thought. I lunged for the closer one stabbing it in the back several times. the other thing ran towards the door only to realize it was locked. I heard it cry and beg and beg and beg and BEG. you broke into MY home. you destroyed MY door. 

I shoved the knife deep into its chin coming out the other end with a satisfying crunch. it slouched back against the door.. the.. door. 

I don't.

I don't understand.

I grip my head. it was pounding... I could barely breath. 

...

Looking back down towards the creature, I started to heave. I don't know what twisted trick this was but they changed. They looked like regular trick or treaters.. the same ghost face and zombie costumes. 

I'm not going to fall for these obvious tricks. IM NOT. for gods sake there are kids in this neighborhood.

getting up I started walking towards my safe. inputting the code I heard a click and the metal shift open. I grabbed my Remington and some shells, again stuffing them into my pocket. I'm going to make sure these "things" don't hurt anyone else.

Honey. I love you.
