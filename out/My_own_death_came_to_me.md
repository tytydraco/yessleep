I must be imagining things… I have to be.

My name is Ashraf. I’m just like any young man in Egypt, a year or two past twenty-five, living alone in an old rent-controlled apartment in a sort of working-class neighborhood here in Cairo. I have a modest job, I go, I come back, one day like the one before it, nothing new. Loneliness can be suffocating sometimes, but you get used to it. Or maybe you just think you’ve gotten used to it.

It started about a month ago… or maybe a little longer, I don’t remember exactly. Very simple things at first, like what… like feeling someone rushed past you, the corner of your eye catches a shadow that vanishes. Of course, the first thing that comes to mind: exhaustion, lack of sleep, the stress of work and this crappy life. I’d shake my head and tell myself, "Man, get over it, you just need some good sleep."

But it stopped being just fleeting shadows. I started to feel it more. Like what? Like you’re sitting watching TV, the volume low because of the neighbors, and suddenly you feel breath behind your neck. You whip around… nothing. You turn off the TV and just listen… complete silence, except for the hum of the old fridge in the kitchen and the sound of cars passing in the street. The next day, you find the wardrobe door slightly ajar, and you’re a million percent sure you closed it properly before sleeping. Little things that make you doubt yourself, make you wonder, maybe I'm the one forgetting? Maybe I'm just not focused?

I stayed like this for two or three weeks. Denying it, lying to myself, saying it’s just my imagination. Until the night I’ll never forget.

I came back from work late, dead tired. I’d barely entered the apartment, tossed my keys on the table near the door, and was heading to the bathroom to take a shower to wake myself up. The bathroom in this apartment is a bit dark, its lightbulb is weak and flickers sometimes. I stood in front of the mirror to wash my face, the cold water hit my face and jolted me awake a bit. I lifted my head while drying my face with the towel… and I saw him.

Standing behind me, near the bathroom door.

My heart dropped to my feet. The towel fell from my hand into the sink. I kept staring into the mirror, unable to turn around. He… he looked like me. Roughly the same height, same short black hair, same facial features… but it wasn’t me. His face was… bloated. Swollen. Like someone who had drowned and been pulled from the water after two or three days. The skin was pale, stretched in a weird way, and his eyes… his eyes were empty, staring at me in the mirror without any expression. He was wearing the same grey t-shirt I had worn that morning before leaving for work.

Seconds passed like hours. I was frozen in place, hearing my heartbeat pounding in my ears like a drum. The breath I’d felt behind my neck these past days… it was him. The shadow I kept glimpsing… it was him.

I gathered all my courage and spun around quickly.

No one.

The bathroom door was closed just as it was. The air in the bathroom felt suddenly cold; I felt a shiver run down my entire body. I looked back in the mirror again… I was alone. My face in the mirror was yellow and drawn, my eyes wide with terror.

I left the bathroom, my legs stumbling over each other. I sat on the sofa in the living room, trying to process what I’d seen. Drowned? Looked like me? What nonsense is this? It must have been a dream; I was tired and exhausted and must have fallen asleep standing in front of the mirror. Yes, that’s the only logical explanation.

But the grey t-shirt? I took it off this morning and threw it in the laundry basket. I ran to the bedroom, opened the laundry basket… the t-shirt was there. Grey, wrinkled from a long day’s work.

Then how? How did I see him wearing it?

I didn’t sleep that night. I stayed sitting on the sofa, glancing towards the bathroom door every few minutes, expecting to see him standing there again. All the lights in the apartment were on, but the darkness was inside me.

The next morning, I woke up on the same sofa, my neck stiff and my body aching. The sun was rising, the street noise starting to pick up. I tried to convince myself again that what happened was a nightmare, a hallucination from fatigue. I went to work, tried to focus, kept myself busy with anything. But his image wouldn’t leave my mind. His bloated face, his empty eyes.

The following days became hell. I didn’t see him clearly anymore like that time in the bathroom, but I felt his presence more strongly. Things happened that had no explanation. I’d wake up in the morning to find wet footprints on the living room floor, even though it was summer and the apartment was completely dry. I’d smell a strange stench of decay, like stagnant water, that would appear and disappear suddenly. I’d hear a sound like someone choking or blowing air bubbles from water, coming from the direction of the bathroom at night.

I started being afraid to stay alone in the apartment. I began coming home from work as late as possible, sitting at the coffee shop with any colleague, anything to keep me out of the apartment for the longest time. And when I returned, I’d enter trembling, keep all the lights on, and turn on the TV or anything to make noise so I wouldn’t feel this terrifying silence.

Sleep became almost impossible. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face. His pale, swollen face. I started living on coffee and stimulants, I looked like a zombie, my face yellow and dark circles under my eyes. People at work started noticing, asking me what was wrong, why I looked so tired. I’d dodge their questions with vague answers. What could I tell them? That I see a drowned version of myself in my apartment? They’d say I’d officially lost my mind.

One night, I was sitting in the living room, trying to read anything to help me sleep. I heard a scratching sound coming from the kitchen. I got up, my heart pounding fast, and grabbed the nearest thing to me – it was a heavy ashtray. I entered the kitchen slowly… the light was off, but the light from the living room illuminated the space a bit.

I found him.

He was standing at the sink, his back to me. Doing something with his hands in the sink, I couldn’t see exactly what. But I heard the sound of water, and another sound… a sound like someone swallowing with difficulty.

I froze in place, the ashtray trembling in my hand. I didn’t know what to do. Scream? Run? Hit him?

He slowly turned his face towards me. The same bloated face, the same vacant eyes. But this time… there was like white foam around his mouth, like what appears on a drowned person. And his lips were slightly blue.

He opened his mouth… no sound came out, but I felt an icy cold radiating from him, along with that disgusting smell of decay.

I don’t know what happened, but I found myself dropping the ashtray and running towards the apartment door, opening it, and flying down the stairs screaming like a madman. I ended up in the street barefoot, in my house clothes, people in the street staring at me with bewilderment and fear. I kept running until I reached a nearby coffee shop, collapsed onto a chair, panting and unable to breathe. The owner came asking what was wrong, people gathered around me. I couldn’t speak, tears just streamed down my face. Not tears of sadness, but tears of terror and despair.

After a while, I calmed down, drank a glass of water. I couldn’t go back to the apartment that night. I stayed at a friend’s place, after feeding him some lie about a burglar breaking in and me getting scared. Of course, he didn’t quite believe me, but he let me stay anyway.

The next day, I returned to the apartment in the morning, terrified. I opened the door slowly… everything was as it was. No trace of him. I went into the kitchen… the sink was dry, nothing strange. As if what happened last night was just another nightmare.

But I knew it wasn’t a nightmare. I saw him. I saw him clearly.

I started thinking. Why is he appearing to me? And why does he look like that? Why does he look like me? And why does he look drowned? I don’t even like water, I’m afraid of the sea, I’ve never even thought of going to a beach resort alone. What does drowning have to do with me?

I started searching for any explanation. I read about ghosts, jinn, the 'Qareen' (spirit double). I tried reading Quran in the apartment, sprinkling salt in the corners like people say. Useless. The feeling of his presence was still there, and fear controlled me.

Another time, I was sleeping – or trying to sleep – in bed. I felt a weight on the edge of the bed, as if someone sat down next to me. I slowly opened my eyes… I found him sitting there, looking at me. The same bloated face, the wet clothes dripping water onto the floor. I couldn’t move, felt my whole body was paralyzed. He just stared at me like that for a minute, then got up, walked towards the bathroom, and disappeared.

A few days later, something even stranger happened. I was brushing my teeth in the morning in front of the mirror. I looked at my reflection… me, Ashraf, looking normal, tired and worn out like every day. I closed my eyes and opened them again… I saw the face in the mirror changing. Swelling slowly, the skin becoming pale and stretched, the eyes emptying… it became him. My reflection in the mirror became his reflection. I kept staring, disbelieving, I put my hand on my face… my skin felt normal. But the image in the mirror… the image of a drowned, dead man.

I screamed and backed away from the mirror quickly, bumping into the washing machine, stumbling backward, trembling. I looked again cautiously… my reflection was back to normal.

It was here that I started connecting the dots. Why does he look like me? Why does he appear specifically to me? Why in my apartment? Why does he look drowned?

The idea started forming in my mind like a malignant tumor. An idea so terrifying that I tried to push it away every time it surfaced.

He isn't just an ordinary ghost. He isn't a jinn. He isn't my Qareen.

He… is me.

But not me now. Me… later.

Me… dead.

The man I keep seeing… that’s me after I die. Dead by drowning.

This realization hit me like a lightning bolt. Everything suddenly made sense. His constant appearances, his appearance, his presence in my private spaces (the bathroom, the bed, the kitchen), the t-shirt he was wearing… it was all a message. A horrifying message about my future. About my end.

I am going to die by drowning.

But how? And where? And why? These questions had no answers. All I knew was the terrifying truth I had seen with my own eyes. I had seen my death. I had seen my corpse.

After this realization, the world turned darker in my eyes. It wasn't just fear of the ghost haunting me anymore. It became fear of inevitable fate. Fear of the destiny awaiting me. Every day I woke up, I felt I was getting closer to that moment. Every time I entered the bathroom, I felt the water coming from the shower would swallow me. Every time I looked in the mirror, I expected to see his bloated face staring back.

Life lost its taste. I stopped going to work, making excuses about being sick. I wasn’t eating well, I lost weight and became like a scarecrow. The people around me, even my friend whose place I stayed at, started distancing themselves; maybe they really thought I had gone crazy. And I couldn’t blame them. I myself felt like I was on the edge of madness.

I started wandering the apartment like a ghost. Going from room to room, looking out the window at the street and the people walking by, living their lives normally, unaware that someone up here had already seen his end.

Last night, he appeared again. I was sitting on the floor in the living room, hugging my knees to my chest, staring at a blank wall. I felt him behind me. I didn't turn around. I don't know why, but I didn't. Maybe I had finally given up. Maybe it didn't matter anymore.

I felt his cold, wet hand touch my shoulder. A shiver ran through my entire body, but I didn't panic like all the other times. There was a strange feeling of surrender.

I heard a sound, not understandable words, but a sound like water moving with difficulty, the sound of a drowning person trying to breathe. The sound was coming from right behind me, very close.

I remained sitting there, eyes closed. I wanted all of this to end. I couldn't bear this terror for another day. I couldn't live knowing I would become like that. Looking so grotesque.

When the sound stopped, and the feeling of his presence vanished, I opened my eyes. I stood up. I felt utterly exhausted, as if my soul had been drained from me. But at the same time, I felt a strange clarity. As if everything was now understood.

I saw my future. I saw my end. Drowned.

Well… if this is the inevitable end… why wait for it? Why keep living in this terror every day, waiting for the moment the catastrophe happens? Waiting to find myself underwater, trying to breathe and failing, until my face bloats and my eyes become empty?

If this is my destiny… then I will fulfill it myself. At least, I get to choose when and how. End this torment with my own hands.

I walked with steady steps towards the bathroom. As if a force was pulling me. I opened the door. I looked at the old, small bathtub, barely big enough for one person to sit in.

I turned on the hot and cold water taps together. The sound of the water filling the tub was loud in the silence of the apartment. I stood watching the water level rise, the steam rising to fog the mirror above the sink. The mirror where I saw his face… my face… clearly for the first time.

When the tub was almost full, I turned off the taps. Silence returned, nothing but the sound of my own breathing, and my heart beating with a strange slowness, as if it too had surrendered.

I slowly took off my clothes, throwing them on the floor. I stood before the bathtub. The water was still releasing a light steam.

I looked at my reflection on the water’s surface. My face was pale, my eyes held a strange look, a mixture of fear, despair, and… relief?

Maybe this is the only possible relief now.

I stepped into the tub. The water was warmer than necessary, but I didn't feel anything. I sat down slowly, the water engulfing my body up to my chest.

I lifted my head and looked at the moldy bathroom ceiling. I took a deep breath… the last one.

And I lowered my head under the water.

At first, I instinctively tried to resist. My body tried to surface, tried to breathe. But my mind was made up. I held onto the edges of the tub with both hands, forcing myself down underwater. Water entered my nose, my mouth, my ears. A sharp burning in my chest. My eyes were open underwater, watching the air bubbles escape from me.

His face… my bloated face… formed before my eyes underwater. Was it smiling? No, no expression. Vacant. Just like I saw it the first time.

I started to feel dizzy, the world spinning. The sounds faded. The burning in my chest began to subside, replaced by a strange feeling of lethargy and coldness.

The last thing I felt… was the water filling me from the inside.

And then… darkness.

And silence.

Finally… silence.
