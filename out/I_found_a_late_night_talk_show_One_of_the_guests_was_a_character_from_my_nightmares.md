Dreams have affected me so severely throughout my life that my parents took me to a therapist when I was 8 years old. Her name was Dr. Magar, she specialized in dream therapy. I had many sessions with her during my youth and continued to see her up to my late teens. I stopped seeing her altogether when I moved away for college, but by that point I could somewhat rationalize my dreams.  
  
I’m Ethan by the way, 28 years old from Maine. I grew up in Bar Harbor and now reside not a million miles away in Portland, ME with my girlfriend Kat. I experienced something terrifying recently and have not been able to relax since. It started on a Friday, the day Kat was leaving to visit family in Pennsylvania for the weekend.  
  
“Fuck!” she yelled from the hallway of our apartment.  
  
I came running to investigate. “Are you alright?”  
  
She was standing on one foot wincing. “Yeah, I just dropped the suitcase on my foot. Son of a Binx!”  
  
I froze on the spot for a moment. “Why would you say that?”  
  
One of my recurring childhood dreams featured a character called Mr. Binx. I’d told Kat about him in the past but it was a name I hadn’t heard or spoke of for years.  
  
“Say what?” she asked, confused.  
  
“You know how much he traumatized me!”  
  
“He? Ethan, who are you talking about?”  
  
After arguing about it briefly she assured me that she’d said *‘son of a bitch’*. I’d misheard her.  
  
“I’d never make light of your dreams, Ethan.” Kat had witnessed how my dreams affected me at times. I’d scared her myself once or twice!  
  
I gave her a hug. “I’m sorry, Kat.”  
  
“Are you okay?” she asked. “Now you got me feeling like I should stay.”  
  
“No, no,” I said. “Don’t be silly. You go. Plus it’s too late to cancel the orgy.”  
  
She slapped my arm playfully. “We both know you’ll be playing video games in your underwear the whole weekend.”  
  
I shrugged. “Well, when the Kat’s away…”  
  
After we said our goodbyes I grabbed a load of snacks and powered on the Playstation for a few hours. Dinner consisted of take out chow mein, Cherry Garcia and a few Coronas. I can look after myself, but a weekend without judgement is sometimes required.  
  
I woke up late. My neck ached from the position I dozed off in so I stretched a little. Some badly acted drama was on the TV. I picked up the remote and yawned, starting to flick through the channels with the intention of switching it off and heading to bed. That’s when I found it.  
  
*Night Terrors Live!*  
  
There was a studio audience applauding as the words filled the screen. It wasn’t the usual upbeat music you associate with talk shows. It was eerie and sinister, like a horror movie score. There were thunderstorm sound effects and the studio lights flickered. Then the camera focussed on a stage as someone appeared to loud cheers and whistles.  
  
It was Dr. Magar.  
  
My jaw dropped along with the remote. It had been around 10 years since I’d seen her but she looked exactly the same. She was wearing a tailored navy pantsuit and her jet black hair was cut into a blunt bob.  
  
“What the hell,” I whispered as she spoke.  
  
“Good evening, and welcome to Night Terrors Live! I’m Dr. Magar. I’ve been studying and analyzing dreams for more than 30 years, and have been a dream therapist for the last 20. My patients have ranged from small children to the elderly, from stay-at-home parents to Fortune 500 CEOs. They all have at least one thing in common; nightmares. Nightmares have no preference or prejudice. They don’t care if you’re good or bad, rich or poor. We’ve all had them, but some have *exceptionally* horrifying nightmares that leave mental scars. That’s where I offer my expertise. Tonight, we’re going to talk to some of the most interesting and terrifying beings to inhabit the dreams of my patients.”  
  
The audience erupted into applause as I sat in disbelief.  
  
“This can’t be real,” I said to myself, using a few dream tests I’d learned over the years. One of the methods is to try and read or look at something familiar. If it looks nonsensical or warped you’re likely dreaming. I picked up my phone and was instantly greeted by the time, date, and name of my service provider. I scrolled through Whatsapp and read clear messages from friends and family.  
  
As Dr. Magar continued to talk, I called Kat. It went to voicemail after a few rings, but I couldn’t hold that against her. It was past midnight. I tried again anyway. When it went to voicemail I left a *“please call me back”* message in the most rational tone I could muster. Then I sank further into the couch as I couldn’t help but watch.  
  
Dr. Magar went behind a desk, the kind you’d see on other talk shows. The backdrop was a deep red, like a Western sunset, with *Night Terrors Live!* in bold black lettering.  
  
“Later in the show we’ll be talking to a terror straight from your dark basement, and the ghoulish projection of a murdered wife who drove her husband to suicide. But first, please give a warm welcome to the always charming and deceptive Mr. Binx!”  
  
My heart felt like it stopped beating for a moment, then it threatened to break my ribcage. I screamed out loud as a man walked on set waving to the cheering audience. He wore his signature white shirt and green argyle sweater vest, beige pants, and brown shoes. His face was clean-shaven and his dark hair was short and neat. He had a friendly and approachable appearance, like your childhood best friend’s dad or a cheerful school teacher.  
  
“Thank you,” he said as he sat with one leg crossed over, flashing his pearly whites.  
  
“You inhabited the dreams of little Ethan,” said Dr. Magar. “He was a patient of mine for several years.”  
  
“That’s right. I believe it was over a period of just over three years.”  
  
I tried to call Kat again. “Please pick up, please pick up!” It kept going to voicemail. The room was spinning as Mr. Binx chatted away and smiled with his phoney nice guy act.  
  
“No offense but you look like the friendly guy next door,” said Dr. Magar. “Not the monster in the closet.”  
  
“That’s the beauty of it,” he said. “The element of surprise. I appeared as someone Ethan could trust. It made his inevitable realization more rewarding, for me at least.”  
  
“We have a clip of you in action,” she said. “Let’s take a look.”  
  
Before long a clip had started to play on the backdrop, one I was all too familiar with. Despite wanting to run I couldn’t look away from the screen. It was like looking through my eyes as a child, with a hazy dreamlike quality. I was on a playground swing, moving back and forth as a figure in the distance waved. I could make out Mr. Binx’s vest.  
  
“Ethan!” he called. “I’ve lost Grover. Can you help me look for him?”  
  
Like with most dreams all the background information was already known. He was a friend, and I knew that Grover was his dog.  
  
“Sure thing Mr. Binx!” I said, jumping from the swing.  
  
“Thanks Ethan,” he said. “I think he went into those trees over there.” When he pointed I could see Grover’s leash in his hand. I could hear barking coming from the direction of a woodland area.  
  
“I heard Grover!” I said excitedly, running to the trees.  
  
“Wait for me,” said Mr. Binx from behind. “It might not be safe!”  
  
I entered the woods. It was relatively bright, the sun beaming through treetops. Barking echoed from somewhere nearby.  
  
“This way Mr. Binx!” I said, heading in that direction.  
  
“Stay close Ethan,” he said.  
  
As we walked further into the woods it became darker, and I began to feel a little scared. More barking could be heard.  
  
“Grover!” I called out. “Mr. Binx, he’s over…”  
  
When I turned around I was alone. I started to panic and spun on the spot, looking in all directions.  
  
“Mr. Binx!” I yelled. As the woods became darker still I remember the chill I felt through my body, like the temperature had dropped significantly. I kept calling for Mr. Binx, feeling like I was lost until I spotted his vest nearby. He was waving.  
  
“Ethan, I found him!”  
  
I sighed with relief and approached him. He stood motionless, a smile fixed to his lips as he stared at me.  
  
“Where’s Grover?” I asked.  
  
“You silly boy,” he said, shaking his head. “I don’t have a dog.”  
  
Before I could run he wrapped the leash around my neck and pulled tight from both sides. He gritted his teeth as his fists started to shake from force.  
  
I sat up and grabbed my neck as I took exaggerated breaths, years of childhood trauma flashing before me. It would always be a scenario where he tricked me into helping him or promised some kind of adventure. They would always end the same though; with him violently murdering me.  
  
“Those were a good few years,” said Mr. Binx as it focused back on the studio.  
  
“Ethan made some progress,” said Dr. Magar. “And was finally able to evict you from his dreams, as it were.”  
  
“I blame you for that,” said Mr. Binx to laughter from the audience.  
  
Dr. Magar grinned awkwardly and shrugged. “Sorry, it’s what I do!”  
  
“Ah, it’s fine. I do still think about Ethan though. I often wonder if he still thinks about me.”  
  
My whole body shivered.  
  
“Why not ask him yourself?” said Dr. Magar.  
  
Mr. Binx turned to look directly at the camera. I froze.  
  
“Do you miss me, Ethan?”  
  
I fumbled with the remote as I attempted to power off the TV. He flashed a smile.  
  
“I sure do miss you.”  
  
The power cut off and I ran to the bedroom, throwing on some sweatpants and a hoodie. I couldn’t be in the apartment alone. I drove for around three hours to Bar Harbor, my nerves on edge the whole journey. It was still dark in the early hours when I arrived at the house I grew up in. My parents always kept a key under a garden ornament so I let myself in, trying to be as quiet as possible. When I was inside I collapsed against the door and put my face in my hands.  
  
After a few minutes I could hear movement and muffled voices from upstairs. Then dad shouted down.  
  
“I’ve called the police!”  
  
“Dad, it’s me,” I yelled out.  
  
“Ethan?”  
  
He started walking down the stairs with a baseball bat in his hand, then I heard mom call out.  
  
“Is it Ethan?”  
  
“Yes honey,” said dad. “False alarm.”  
  
She came bounding down the stairs. “What’s wrong, Ethan?”  
  
I stood up and hugged her as I cried. “I think I’m losing my mind.”  
  
We sat around the dinner table drinking peppermint tea as I told them about the show.  
  
“You were dreaming, son,” said dad. “It was just a horrible dream, like the ones you had when you were a kid.”  
  
“I swear it wasn’t a dream!” I said. Mom held my hand.  
  
“Let’s get you to bed, some rest will do you good. We can talk in the morning. Your room is still made up.”  
  
“I’m not sleeping in there!” I yelled. My old bedroom was not a safe space for me. It held terrible memories.  
  
“Okay sweetheart, I’ll make up the couch.”  
  
I was reluctant to fall asleep that night but my body wouldn’t let me stay awake. I was exhausted. As feared I began to dream…  
  
I was on the backseat in Kat’s car as she drove on a rainy night. She was singing along with the radio. I tried to talk to her but no words came out. It was like I wasn’t really there, only observing. A figure was illuminated in the headlights standing on the side of the road. Even before I saw the flash of green argyle I knew who it was.  
  
“Don’t stop Kat!” I tried to scream. It was useless. She pulled over and he climbed into the passenger seat.  
  
“Thank you kind stranger,” he said.  
  
“My goodness, you’re soaked!” she said.  
  
“I’ll dry off soon enough,” he said.  
  
She carried on driving as I watched helplessly.  
  
“Where are you heading?” she asked.  
  
“Not far at all really, just a little further down this road. You’ll see the lights.”  
  
“Got it!”  
  
“You’re very kind, Miss,” he said. “Picking up strangers isn’t recommended.” With that he turned and winked directly at me.  
  
“Thanks for reminding me,” she laughed. “But I couldn’t leave you out in this. I’m Kat by the way.”  
  
“Nice to meet you, Kat. I’m Mr. Binx.”  
  
She let out a little laugh. “I feel like I’m back at school. Do you have a first name Mr. Binx?”  
  
He shook his head. “No. Ethan never gave me a first name.”  
  
She briefly turned to him with a confused expression. “What did you say?”  
  
“Ethan. He only ever referred to me as Mr. Binx.”  
  
She didn’t say anything but I could feel how uncomfortable she was. I was screaming inside.  
  
“Is everything okay Kat?” he asked.  
  
“Yes, I’m fine,” she said. “I just remembered I’ll be turning off at the next junction. Perhaps I should let you out now?”  
  
“Oh, that won’t be necessary. In fact I can see the lights, we’re almost there.” He pointed. There were some lights in the distance getting closer.  
  
“Those lights?” she asked. “I don’t understand.”  
  
He laughed. “Yes, dreams don’t always make sense do they?”  
  
As the lights grew brighter it became clear that they belonged to a large vehicle heading in our direction. Mr. Binx turned to me and smiled.  
  
“Here will do fine,” he said, then he leant over and forced the steering wheel into the opposite lane. A horn sounded out as Kat screamed. The lights were blinding…  
  
“Kat!” I screamed as I sat up.  
  
Mom came running into the living room. “You’re fine Ethan, you were just dreaming.”  
  
The room was filled with natural light. I picked up my phone to see it had gone 11. There were missed calls and voice messages.  
  
“Why didn't you wake me?” I asked.  
  
“You needed the rest sweetheart,” she said. “I’ll fix you a late breakfast.”  
  
Mom left and I tried calling Kat. It went straight to voicemail. There were also missed calls from her parents and an unknown number. I felt sick.  
  
The first voice message was from Kat:  
  
*“I just got your message and I’m worried. I’m coming home, okay baby? I’ll try you again when I stop for gas.”*  
  
My hands shook as I listened to the next message. It was Kat’s dad:  
  
*“Ethan… Oh God, err… Kat has been in an accident. We’re at…”*  
  
I drove for almost eight hours non-stop to a hospital in Connecticut. Kat’s mom gave me a hug and cried. Her dad squeezed my arm.  
  
“She’s fine,” he said. “She’s just sleeping right now.”  
  
I spent the night by her side. If it wasn't for a small cut on her forehead you wouldn't have known she was in a crash at all. She just looked like she was sleeping peacefully. Her car was totaled. It’s a miracle she survived with minimal injuries.  
  
We were back home within a few days. When I asked her about the crash she said it was mostly a blur, and she couldn’t remember much after leaving her parent’s house. I couldn't stop thinking about the dream but forced myself to stay rational. Kat asked me about the late night message I’d left her and I glossed over it, saying I just had a bad dream and wanted to talk. I didn’t want her to know about the show I’d seen just yet. I’d made a mental note to contact Dr. Magar when I felt brave enough.  
  
“I’m sorry,” I said. “If it wasn’t for me you wouldn’t have…”  
  
“Stop!” she said. “It’s no one's fault, Ethan. It’s just one of those things, okay?”  
  
Another few days passed and some personal effects that were salvaged from the wreckage were delivered to our apartment. Kat’s suitcase was included and looked pretty intact considering.  
  
“Thank God,” she said. “I took some of grandma's jewellery. Everything else was replaceable.”  
  
She went to the bedroom to unpack and I went to the kitchen to make us sandwiches. Within a few minutes I heard her laughing from down the hall.  
  
“What’s so funny?” I called out.  
  
“One of my dad’s ugly sweaters somehow got into my suitcase,” she said.  
  
“No way!” I chuckled as I sliced tomatoes. “That’s hilarious.”  
  
“Unless it’s yours,” she asked from the kitchen doorway. “But It’s not really your style.”  
  
I dropped the knife as she held up a green argyle sweater vest.
