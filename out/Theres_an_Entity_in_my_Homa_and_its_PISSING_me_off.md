Today is May 25th and whatever is living in my home with me has decided to open my fridge and freezer all night and all my food has gone bad. I've taken the past hour to throw out all the food that smelled like death and while my fridge was pretty empty now I decided to clean it up a little. All the spills made a sticky mess that constantly bugged me and I had an opportunity to get rid of them. The inside of the food box is good as new but I need to buy food now. *But* I'm already exhausted so I will do that later.

It’s been about a month since I’ve experienced these weird occurrences around my home. Now, this is the scary side of Reddit but uh, these occurrences haven't been much of a scary movie. It’s almost like the *source* of the activity was just doing all this to get under my skin and piss me off. I don’t appreciate it. For example, the TV would shut off at the climax of the show or change the channel to a kid's show, or the sink would flicker on and off rhythmically. Little things that make me mad.

The *source*. I don't know what they want or why they’re here. I've lived in this house for years and they just appeared out of nowhere one morning. I haven't tried to talk with them or see them and I kinda don't want to but at the same time, I do. I don't really care who or what they are, I just want a peaceful house to come back to at the end of the day and to be able to watch my shows uninterrupted and not worry about my water bills.

I've told my little sister about the occurrences and she found the information interesting. Said she wanted to come over and see for herself but there isn't much to see really. The source doesn't do much more than what I've already mentioned, not on a higher-risk scale at least. Whatever she sees while she's over I can already assume she will chalk it up to electrical problems or mice.

She and her friend are gonna come over after school and I have the day off to rest. I'm a cop and I'm relatively new at my job. Most of my colleagues still treat me like a newbie but luckily I've made a good friend there pretty quickly and he suggested I take a day off after the previous day's events. Long story short, I nearly got shot in the neck. Yeah, I'm still shaken up. I know events like that will be more frequent with this position and I'm gonna have to get used to it but I dunno, it was the situation, the pressure. I was already on edge from the source and I barely get any sleep on top of all that. Kenny saw I needed rest and told me to stay home so that's what I'm gonna do, and while I'm home I thought about recording these events because well, I need a hobby outside my mom's hobbies and work and I thought this would be entertaining. So while I wait for Nan and her friend to arrive, I will write this. I'm currently bundled up on my couch in the front room waiting for the TV to do something.

So the first day these events actually began was the day I got my job and that is just a crazy coincidence, right? I didn't think that much about it at first but honestly, the more days that went by the more I realized that it probably wasn't a coincidence? I dunno but take this into account.

Day 1 was the day of a ceremony that was early in the morning and I was rudely awakened by the sound of my TV's static. It was early so I lay there for a minute or two before getting up and turning it off. I didn't check the time but I assume it might have been 4 am? Annoying but I was awake and I didn't want to go back to sleep and risk sleeping past the time of the ceremony so I stayed up and tried to wake myself up more. I made my coffee and waited for it to cool down while watching TV. But sitting there staring at the screen made my eyes heavy. It almost hurt my eyes to stare at the screen and my attention diminished to the point where I could barely hear the sound of exasperated shouting on the TV through my drowsiness. I shook my head and smacked myself a little before getting up and attempting to get something to eat. From the top of the fridge, I reached for a box of cereal and somehow, I didn't lay a finger on it yet, but it fell off from the edge and scattered bits of cereal everywhere.

"What the hell..." I cursed to myself in a groggy irritation and dragged my feet across the floor to go get the broom. "I didn't even touch it but okay... Do I have mice?" I let out an annoyed sigh and cleaned the mess. Despite the waste of my favorite food on a day I probably… definitely need the energy, I figured I should probably eat something better than cereal anyway so after throwing away all mess I opened the fridge and reached for the eggs, and yet, it seems the universe didn't want me to eat that either because 

\*sigh\*

I picked up the egg carton and it fell right out of my hands. It's not like I had a loose grip on it; it was weird how it just fell. No way the lid would have opened like that mid-air and it didn't even slip out of my hand, it was yanked… "Okay, I-... ugh." I began to think that I was just going crazy or I was seeing things. I mean it's unusual for me to wake up this early but would that really mess with my head this much? But really what is my priority right now? I just want food so if my kitchen isn't gonna let me eat I'll go get a breakfast burrito or something. I put my coffee in a to-go cup and made sure to hold onto it really tight so it wouldn't also flee from my grasp and walked out to my car while twirling my keychain around my finger. I owned a rusty old Ranger that my dad (who I don't even know the face of) owned. My mom refused to get rid of it and I wanted a car so found a friend to help me fix this one up and now it's my favorite thing I own. It shows off its age with the faded coloring and the paint layers peeking through but I think it's a beauty. It's pretty boxy too, it's like a Jeep but the sides are an exact 90° angle with the ground and the windows are squared. 

I got in, put the coffee in the cup holder, and started the car. I planned on coming back to eat and take a quick shower but with how this morning was going I was on edge. Anything else can go wrong; my car can get a flat, or I get food poisoning or get in a wreck. 

"Well, I'm going way over my head. I'm just having bad luck this morning. Calm down Toni, whatever comes your way you can deal with." I mumble to myself and try to keep my sanity. With a sip of my coffee at a red light, I feel my nerves diminish and I smile. "Big day, gotta keep a smile on your face. Come on! Get hyped!" I bounce in my seat to hype myself up and drive off the second the light turns green, while also turning the radio on to a reasonable volume level. Bouncing in my seat probably isn't the best idea, to be honest, the slightest tension could pop my bumper off. This car is so beat up it’s ridiculous.

I got my burrito and went back home to eat it on the sofa and watch some pre-recorded western episodes while trying my best not to make a mess because this thing was *loaded*. While picking up the spilled crumbs from the cushion between my legs the TV exits from the episode and switches to the news. "Booo! The dude was just about to shoot the bad guy too. Come on.." I just turned the TV off because it seems like a hassle to go all the way back to the episode. I'll just finish it later on. Also since that food item was *loaded* I have not finished it. I ate about two-thirds of it before feeling nauseous so I put it in the fridge for later. Now it was time for the shower. I checked the time before gathering my clothes and estimated that I could be at least an hour early and I figured that would make me look good anyway. 

My shower takes abnormally long to get to the right temperature so usually I sit on the toilet while flicking the handle. The problem was it was so sensitive if I barely tap it to the left and it turns me into the boiling pasta my mom makes when I’m over, a little to the right and I freeze. It was really just me slowly adjusting to the temperature of the water and also trying not to waste too much money on the water bill. 

After I turn the water off I shake my head like a dog trying to dry off. Because that's what I was doing. The more water I can get out of my hair the better, I need the towel dry to dry the rest of myself. And yes, it looks like I'll still be like 50 minutes early so I just stayed naked while brushing my teeth and got dressed later, It gives me time to air dry myself but on the downside, I had to look at my body in the mirror; as if I didn’t have anything else to boost my anxiety today. Don’t take it that way, I have always been confident about my body but for this profession… Let's put it this way, have you ever seen a twig of a man carry in all the groceries in one trip? No, you haven’t. *Shuttup!* I’m slim and I didn’t encounter situations where that was a problem. If I’m being honest my little sister was always stronger than men, and not because she was forced to due to me not taking on that role, she’s just active and finds goals like that fun. Props to her for putting in the effort, I’m thinking about asking her to take me to the gym with her, aha.

But anyways, I dried my hair the best I could without making it look like a wonky dried mop head, and gulped down the rest of my coffee. They would give me the uniform when I get there but I needed black shoes for the professional look and I knew where they were. They weren't professional and shiny but from a distance, they blended in and that's all I needed. They're usually kept by the front door since they're my main shoes to wear. Kind of my only shoes. I wore them earlier when I went to get breakfast and hey, wouldn't you know it. They've suddenly disappeared. At this point, I had to think that I really was going crazy. My food is wasting itself, my TV has a mind of its own, my shoes are going missing. Maybe I have raccoons or something more logical but right now I cannot let myself worry about that. I need to find my shoes so I can be on my way.

Sorry for the sudden cut off but the sheriff just yelled at me and said to meet him in his office so… I’ll continue this when I get home.
