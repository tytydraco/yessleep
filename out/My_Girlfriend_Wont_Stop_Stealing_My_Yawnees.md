My girlfriend Jamie and I have been living together for three months now. By all accounts we’re a perfectly normal couple. We met on Tinder about half a year ago, and we bonded over the fact that we’re both accountants. I noticed QuickBooks in the background of one of her pictures and made some cheesy joke about wanting to know the *ledger* of her personality.



We went on a date, one thing led to another, and we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend within a month. When the lease on her studio apartment came to an end a few weeks later, she said that she wanted to come live with me. I was hesitant. I thought about my parents’ disdain for my cousin who moved in with her boyfriend before marriage. It took them over a year to start talking to her again.



When I confided in Jamie, she went on this long passionate rant. We were meant to be together; we couldn’t let what other people thought stop us. “I love you,” she said for the very first time.



Seeing how passionate she was made me *sure* that she was the one for me. I was excited about the idea of being star-crossed lovers, though my family still doesn’t know that we’re living together.



The move in was easy. She threw away or donated most of her belongings, and she didn’t bring any pictures or decorations. Just the clothes on her back and some more in a duffle bag.



The first month was amazing. We ate breakfast every morning and slept cuddled up every night. I was so happy. It’s always been hard for me to find someone I enjoy sharing my space with, and the fact that I could be with her for hours and hours and never get bored was amazing.



We were watching a movie one night. Jamie was cuddled up against my shoulder, and I was getting pretty tired. As I began to yawn, she leaned her head around so that our noses were touching, and opened her mouth wide.



She made a sucking sound like someone slurping a straw. It continued until my mouth was closed. 



“I stole your yawnee!” she said, then scooted back to my side.



I just stared. It was so shocking coming from her. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times she’s ever made a joke. I mean, this was the type of girl who emailed me calendar invites for date nights; sometimes she started her text messages with “Hello, Robert.”



It was so out of the blue, but I was happy to see that she was getting comfortable enough to show me her silly side. I laughed and we continued watching the movie. 



Over the next few weeks she “stole my yawnee” every so often. Maybe a few times a week, and never more than once or twice in a day.But over time it started to lose its cuteness. Even if it’s your girlfriend, it’s kinda gross to have someone suck up your yawn. When the novelty wears off, it’s not much different than sucking up a burp. But maybe I was just in a bad mood around that time. For whatever reason I was starting to have trouble sleeping, and I was making too many stupid mistakes at work. One day my boss stepped into my office and closed the door behind him. 



“Your performance is going to need to improve,” he said. “You used to be one of my top guys. Recently…” he paused, looking around the room as if searching for the right words. “It’s hard to say if you’re worth keeping around.”



That night she did it twice. The second was after I’d heard her snoring. I screamed so loud I’m surprised our neighbors didn’t wake up. 



Every time she did it I got a little more uncomfortable, but it was the one joke she had, and I’m sure she believed I thought it was hilarious. I didn’t want to dissuade her from being silly with me, but I was still in the process of working up the confidence to tell her that I wanted her to stop when we got into a bit of a disagreement one Friday night.



I had made reservations weeks in advance for a dinner to celebrate our monthly anniversary. She waited until an hour before we were supposed to leave to tell me that she was too tired to go.



I told her that was fine, but I’m sure she could tell from the annoyance in my voice that I was pissed. I mean, if you have an event planned weeks in advance, especially something like a dinner with your significant other, you think you’d be ready, right? Go to bed a little earlier the night before, grab a coffee or an energy drink. At the very least, she could tough it out for a couple hours to make me happy, right? 



“I just haven’t been getting enough yawnees recently,” she said.



I about lost my mind. “Can you cut it out with the crap?” I said. “It’s weird and disgusting. I just wanted to celebrate with you. Can’t we just try to have a good night?” 



She didn’t respond; she just stared at me with her eyes narrowed and her head tilted to the side. It was the look of someone who was about to lose it. I had opened my mouth to continue but faltered. Had I really made her that mad?



I went to our room and got in bed. I was too angry to sleep, but too tired to do anything else. I was laying there, thinking about all the things I might say to her, when I heard the door creak.



But no one was there. It must have been the wind or something. I hadn’t closed the door anyway, and I couldn’t tell whether or not it was more open than it was a few moments prior. I turned to face the wall and tried my best to fall asleep before she came to bed. As petty as it sounds, I was determined not to speak to her again for the rest of the night. 



After a few moments, I felt pressure in the back of my throat, then air filling up in my ears as my jaw began to tingle. I opened my mouth, right at the faint beginning of an inhale, Jamie slid out from under the bed, swiftly shifted to a sitting position, and put her mouth up against mine, sucking the remnants of a yawn halted by a scream out of my throat.



“What the fuck?!” I pushed myself to the middle of the bed.



“I got your yawnee!” She said, smiling.



“This is fucking insane!” I screamed. “What is wrong with you?”



I was seething with rage. I gripped the comforter with both hands so hard that my nails dug into my palms through the fabric. Jamie ignored me; she got into her side of the bed and was sleeping shortly after. I barely closed my eyes for the rest of the night.



We ignored each other over the weekend, and I made sure to hide my yawns as much as I was able. On Sunday, after walking into the bathroom and locking the door just to keep my yawn to myself, I looked at myself in the mirror. I hadn’t showered since Friday morning, and I’d only slept a couple hours since then. My hair was a greasy mess. There were thick, purple bags under my eyes.



I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was going to steal another yawn right when I least expected it. I didn’t want to let that happen, but at the same time, how could I be so ridiculous? Did it really matter?



My mistakes at work continued, and on Wednesday my boss put me on probation. Two days later, Jamie came home and told me that she’d won employee of the month. It came with a $2,000 bonus.



I was happy for her, and I took her out to dinner and a movie to celebrate. She laughed at all my cheesy jokes, and it felt like we were in the first month of our relationship again. It felt good to be on decent terms with her again. Was it really worth sacrificing my sleep, our relationship, and my job because I was scared she was going to steal my yawn?



When we got home we sat down on the couch to watch a movie. She snuggled up against me. “Robert,” she said, then paused for a moment. “I… I love you.”



“I love you too.”



It felt like she was building up to an apology but never quite got there. She’s always been an awkward person. It made sense that she was too embarrassed to admit that she took the joke too far. I could tell by the way she smiled at me that she felt horrible. But… I still wasn’t sure. The only way to be sure, to bring things back to normal, was to yawn in front of her. Once I was certain that she wasn’t going to steal my yawn, I could relax; I could sleep; I could trust her again. I know it seems silly, but I felt like this was what I needed to get my life back.



I opened my mouth and let out a loud yawn.



She slipped out from under my arm, enveloped my mouth with hers, and sucked it out of me like a hungry snake.



“I got your yawnee!” she squealed. She smiled at me, looking directly into my eyes from only a few inches away, then sat back against the couch and leaned her head against my shoulder.



For a moment the world seemed frozen. The movie was muffled; I could no longer feel Jamie on my side. Was this a dream? 



I closed my eyes and began counting to 10. Halfway through I realized that I’d been holding my breath. When I opened my eyes I jerked away from her and went to bed.



I laid there thinking about our relationship and how to get out of it. We had just renewed a 13-month lease together. And how could I explain to anyone that I was leaving her because she wouldn’t stop stealing my yawns? 



When she got into bed I locked myself in the guest bathroom and cried. I spent the night in the tub with a bath towel. I’m not sure if I ever fell asleep, but it couldn’t have been for more than two or three hours. 



I waited until I heard Jamie leave to unlock the door. I was twenty minutes late to work. That was strike one for the day.



Strike two was when my boss surprised me in my office and I spilled my cup of coffee all over his new suit.



“Jesus Christ!” He screamed and jumped backwards, slamming against my desk and sending my lamp to the floor. He reached toward his suit to wipe the scalding hot coffee off his hands, then thought better and started wiping them off on my desk. “This is a $4,000 suit,” he continued. “What the fuck is your problem?” He stuck the side of his thumb in his mouth as he left the room.



I tried to stay on my A-game for the rest of the day. I didn’t leave my office again except to go to the bathroom. Even then, I first peeked my head around my office door like a sly criminal to make sure the coast was clear.



Things were going better until about 3:00 PM, but I’m still not sure exactly what happened. I was doing some mundane task, inputting invoice numbers or something, when suddenly someone was nudging me from behind.



I woke up with my head pressed against the keyboard and about a thousand w’s entered where a number was supposed to be.



“Strike three,” my boss said. “Get your stuff and get out of here.”



When I got home I paced the living room, waiting for Jamie. 6:00 PM came, 30 minutes late. 6:05… I was just about to call her when she walked through the door carrying a bottle of wine. She was smiling wide and practically jumping up and down. I swear I’d never seen her so happy.



“I got promoted to team lead!” she said.



“How much is the raise?” I asked. I couldn’t look at her.



“It’s an extra $20,000 a year!



“Then we’re only down about 30.”



“What do you mean?” She asked.



I told her everything, and by the end of it I was crying in her arms. I was so comforted by the way she held me. She made me feel that everything was going to be okay. I cried until I had nothing left to give. 



“I’m just so tired,” I said, pleading as if she could fix me.



“I know,” she said. “I know. Just relax and let it happen.”



My eyes closed; a warm sensation ran through my body. Jamie patted my back as my mouth opened reflexively.



And then the disgusting, slurping sound. Droplets of spit flying from her mouth into mine. I didn’t fight it. Just cried and let myself fall further against her.



“It’s okay baby,” she said. “I’ll take care of you.” She kissed me on my forehead. “As long as you keep letting me have your yawnees.”



We fell asleep on the couch together. In the morning she went to work and I stayed home feeling sorry for myself. As the hours went by and I did nothing except scroll Instagram on my phone, I felt more and more of the realization that Jamie now owned me. I might as well have been a puppy in a kennel.



She would come home from work every day ready to take my yawns. Although I thought I’d have more energy now that I didn’t have to work, I found myself to be more tired than ever. When she was gone, all I could do was lay in bed, on the couch, or in the bath. When she got home she’d take a yawn, cook dinner, then take one more before bed. It became a Pavlovian response for me. When she walked toward me I would tingle, and when she opened her mouth in front of mine I’d give in instantaneously.



As the days went on I became worse, and time started to warp in odd ways. One moment we’d be eating dinner, the next she’d be coming home from work. One night, we went to bed watching our favorite show,  and when I woke up I was at the kitchen table with a half-eaten waffle in front of me. I dropped the fork I’d been holding and screamed.



“What’s wrong?” Jamie asked. She looked at me with her head tilted to the side. It would have been genuine concern if it wasn’t for the slight smile.



The more I thought about it the more I could faintly remember Jamie nudging me awake and leading me to the kitchen table. “I… I must have zoned out.”



I looked up and was surprised to see her wearing a robe. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work?”



“It’s Saturday, honey. Now give me a yawnee.”



She sucked it out of my mouth, but I barely noticed; I was thinking about something else. 



How could it be Saturday when we’d fallen asleep watching our show? The one that played on Monday nights.



As if my noticing flipped an invisible switch, it only got worse. One day it was nearly 100 degrees outside, the next it was snowing. I checked my phone one evening to see a text from my mom.



*I can’t believe you missed the funeral.*



There was beating in my throat. My body tingled in a strange, unpleasant way; I scrolled through the rest of our messages. Most recent were several texts all asking where I was. One telling me she hated me, one telling me she loved me.



I found a long paragraph that I’d written. It was about my dad and a memory of us fishing; one message from my mom said that she didn’t know how to move on without him. 



I couldn’t breathe. I got up out of bed, watched my feet as I walked toward the kitchen. The carpet turned to wood, then there was a dirty rug I didn’t recognize. I tried to kick it; instead I tripped and fell.



“What are you doing on the floor, honey?” Jamie asked, as if she hadn’t seen me.



“My dad… why, why wasn’t I at the funeral?”



“Don’t you remember, honey? You had to stay home and give me your yawnees. Like you promised.” 



She looked back down at her notebook and continued to write by hand, humming something I didn’t recognize.



I stood up and turned in a circle. Looking, looking, looking. My eyes found something sharp. A beautiful knife with a pink blade. I don’t remember what I did, but I remember that it felt good.



I haven’t slept since then, but I have more energy than ever. I don’t know what will happen next, but I do know one thing.



[I will never yawn again.](https://www.reddit.com/user/CDBlotts/comments/1lwuu5u/thanks_for_reading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
