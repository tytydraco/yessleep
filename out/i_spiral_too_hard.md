there are days when the weight of the world feels too heavy to carry. on these days, i find myself sinking into a dark place, my thoughts spiraling into an abyss i wish i could escape from. the pain of my past lingers, and my mind becomes clouded with regrets, “what ifs,” and “could haves.” i dwell on mistakes i think i could have avoided, paths i should have taken, and opportunities that slipped through my fingers. it's like a never ending loop of self reproach, and i can’t help but wonder if i will ever be free from it.

the hot shower becomes my sanctuary, the only place where i allow myself to break down completely. as the water streams over me, it feels like a shield from the outside world, a moment of solitude where my tears can mix with the flowing warmth. i cry until my body feels lighter, but my heart remains heavy. it's cathartic, yet it doesn’t provide the release i long for. sometimes, i even wish to disappear for a while not permanently, just enough to catch my breath and reset. the thought is fleeting, but its intensity scares me.

being 22 feels like standing at the edge of adulthood while still carrying the burdens of youth. everyone talks about how this is supposed to be the prime of my life, but here i am, jobless and feeling lost. i see my peers thriving, seemingly having it all together, while i struggle to find my footing. comparison only deepens my sense of inadequacy, but it’s hard to stop the cycle. the anxiety of falling behind keeps me up at night, leaving me exhausted and overwhelmed. yet, amidst this, i tell myself that life is not a race. i am trying to internalize that my journey will look different, and that’s okay.

i am working on myself, albeit slowly. there are days when progress feels nonexistent, but i remind myself that even small steps count. healing is not linear, and growth isn’t instantaneous. i try to focus on the little wins waking up on time, journaling my thoughts, or going for a walk. these might seem trivial, but they are my reminders that i’m still moving forward, however slowly. sometimes, i talk to myself in the mirror, offering affirmations i don’t fully believe in yet, but i hope one day i will.

while my current state feels suffocating, i hold onto the hope that better days are coming. i know this phase will not define my entire life; it’s just a chapter, not the whole book. i remind myself that i have the resilience to climb out of this hole, one step at a time. at 22, i still have time to figure things out. it’s okay to take things slow. i owe it to myself to be patient, to nurture the parts of me that feel broken, and to trust that one day, i will look back and be proud of how far i’ve come.
