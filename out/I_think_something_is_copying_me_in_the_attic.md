I live alone. That’s important to remember. No pets, no roommates, just me in this old, creaky house at the end of a dead-end street.

The first time I noticed it, I was brushing my teeth. I leaned forward over the sink, spitting out toothpaste, and overhead, in the attic, something shifted. A soft scrape, like someone leaning forward at the same time as me. I froze, toothbrush still in my mouth, and listened.

Nothing.

I told myself it was the house settling, even though it didn’t quite sound like that.

The next night, I was in bed, scrolling on my phone. I shifted my weight onto my left side, and above me—creak. The exact same sound. The exact same timing.

I sat up. Creak.

Now I was awake.

I turned my head slowly, and from the attic, creak.

I lifted my arm. Another creak.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Day 3

I decided to test it. Standing in my living room, I raised my right foot and stomped down hard. Thump—an echoing response from the attic.

I took a step forward. Thump.

My chest tightened.

I lifted both arms. Silence. I let them fall. Creak.

Whatever was up there, it wasn’t just moving—it was copying me.

Day 4

I put a chair under the attic hatch and pulled the cord. The ladder unfolded with a groan. I stared into the dark hole above me, heart hammering.

I climbed the first step. Creak.

Another. Creak.

The air up there smelled stale. The attic was just an unfinished space—exposed beams, insulation, dust. Nothing that should be able to move.

I reached the top and turned on my phone flashlight. The dim light cut through the darkness, sweeping over the rafters.

Something moved.

Not scurrying like a rat. Not fluttering like a bat. No. This was deliberate.

Then I saw it.

A hand.

Not a normal hand—my hand.

It stuck out from behind a wooden beam, fingers curling in the exact position as mine.

I yanked my hand back in shock, and the thing in the attic did the same.

My stomach twisted into knots. My skin went cold.

I didn’t breathe. I didn’t move. And for a long, awful second, nothing happened.

Then—creak.

Not from me.

I bolted.

I scrambled off the chair, nearly twisting my ankle as I hit the floor. I reached up and slammed the attic hatch shut, yanking the cord back into place. The ceiling swallowed the opening, leaving nothing but a square outline.

Silence.

I staggered backward, staring up. My own pulse throbbed in my ears. The only sound was the hum of my refrigerator from the kitchen.

Then—creak.

A slow, deliberate sound, coming from directly above me.

It was still copying me.

I stepped back. Creak.

I moved to the side. Creak.

A feeling of pure, ice-cold dread sank into my bones.

I wasn’t testing it anymore.

It was testing me.

Day 5

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat in the corner of my bedroom, watching the ceiling. Every time I shifted, I heard it shift too.

I tried calling someone, but what would I even say? “Hey, something in my attic is mimicking me”?

I left the house that morning, sat in my car for an hour, and debated just never coming back. But all my things were inside. My wallet. My laptop. My life.

So I went back.

The house was still.

I moved carefully, listening. Nothing. Maybe—maybe it was gone? Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks?

Then, in the hallway, I stopped dead.

The attic hatch was open.

The ladder was down.

And at the bottom step, sitting perfectly still, was me.

My heart stopped.

It wasn’t just my reflection—it was me, sitting in my hallway, legs bent at the exact same angle as mine.

It lifted a hand.

I lifted mine, unwillingly.

I tried to step back, but my legs wouldn’t move.

The thing tilted its head, mouth twitching, like it was trying to learn how to smile.

Then, it spoke.

In my voice.

But wrong.

Like it had never used words before.

“Let me be you.”

The floor shifted beneath me. My vision tunneled. My own face stared at me, still grinning, still tilting its head too far, like a puppet with snapped strings.

Then it stood up.

I didn’t wait. I ran.

I don’t remember getting in my car. I don’t remember starting the engine. But I remember looking up at my house as I sped away.

And I remember seeing something in my bedroom window.

Waving.

Day ???

I don’t know where to go.

I’m sitting in a motel room, writing this.

But the worst part?

I keep hearing creaks.

And every time I move, I hear a second one—just a little too late.

I barely slept last night. Every time I shifted under the motel’s thin blanket, I heard a faint creak from the ceiling. I told myself it was the old building settling. I told myself it was paranoia.

But deep down, I knew.

It had followed me.

I don’t know how. I don’t know what it is. But it didn’t stay in the attic.

It wants me.

I tried to ignore it. I went out, got food, sat in a park for hours. I convinced myself I was just sleep-deprived, just imagining things.

But when I got back to the motel, my door was unlocked.

I know I locked it.

I know.

I stood there for what felt like forever, hand hovering over the knob, stomach twisted in knots. Finally, I forced myself inside.

The room looked… normal. Nothing was missing. Nothing was out of place. But I felt it.

That wrongness.

Then I saw it.

The motel mirror.

It wasn’t me in it.

Oh, it looked like me. Same tired eyes, same messy hair. But it wasn’t a reflection.

It was delayed.

I lifted my hand. It didn’t move immediately—it hesitated, just a fraction of a second.

Like it was watching me.

Like it was learning.

And then—

It smiled.

Not my smile. That same awful, stretched grin.

I stumbled back, heart hammering. My reflection stepped forward.

I ran.

I grabbed my keys, sprinted out of the room, and peeled out of the parking lot without looking back.

I don’t know where to go. I’ve been driving for hours.

Every time I stop at a gas station, a rest stop, anywhere—I hear it.

The faintest creak when I move.

The slightest shuffle when I shift my weight.

And sometimes, in the corner of my vision, I see someone who looks just like me.

Standing still.

Watching.

Waiting.

I don’t think I can outrun it.

I don’t think I can escape.

Because every time I look in a mirror now—

It gets faster.

I haven’t looked in a mirror for hours. Maybe days.

But I feel it.

It’s in the glassy sheen of a car window, the darkened screen of my dead phone, the way the world flickers just a fraction behind me when I turn too fast.

It’s catching up.

I know now—I was never alone in that house. I was never alone anywhere.

It was always there.

Waiting.

Learning.

And soon, when the last echo of my movements finally fades—

When the final creak of my step isn’t mine anymore—

It won’t have to copy me at all.

Because it will be me.
