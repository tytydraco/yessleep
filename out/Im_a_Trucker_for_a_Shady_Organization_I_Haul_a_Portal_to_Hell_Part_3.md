Rooming with a marionette contortionist shapeshifting asshole is worse than you'd imagine.

"Ci…ci… heeelp…" an almost familiar voice tore me from my dreams.

Drawing one of my stolen pistols, I tentatively approached the door.

A slithering hiss came from down the hall, then **click** something flicked the hall light on.

Dropping to a crouch, a glimmer caught my eye. Something was wedged beneath the door.

A scream burst out involuntarily as the object registered. An eye. A single human eye stared up at me.

"Heeelp… Cici? Is that you-?" The voice whimpered. Heavy hits as though from a jackhammer began crashing rapid-fire from the opposite side of the door. How the wood was withstanding the force, I didn't know, and in that instant, I didn't care.

**BANG! BANG!** Two rounds loosed from my gun, piercing the door and sending splinters out like clouds.

Silence fell as I curled up, quivering on my bedroom floor. Before I worked up the courage to inspect the intruder, something mind-numbingly infuriatingly worse broke out.

"Kahahaha! Really had ya going there for a minute, didn't I?" D fell through the door, pounding the floor from laughter.

**BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! click!** I emptied the remaining four rounds into that asshat.

"Ahaha haha!" D continued laughing, ignoring the hollow holes ridding their clay body. Wiping an imaginary ear from an empty eye socket, D became serious. "Dispatch called."

"Mother fucking fuck!" I screamed, hurling the six shot but missing the driver. I'll chalk that up to the shitty lighting.

"By the way, you might not want to show your face…" D chuckled dryly, guilt tugging at their lips.

*Great, two terrible options. Might as well rip the bandaid off quickly.* "Dispatch called?" I sighed, breathing slowly to reduce my heart rate. 

"I wrote the address in my journal, here." D produced a velvet, leather-bound diary from seemingly nowhere, already open.

"Shit really? That's… going to take for fucking ever…" I grumbled, cursing my existence.

"The other thing-?" D began, but I interrupt. 

"Nope. Not a good time. Just… give me a moment?" I shooed them out the door, walked to my bed, and screamed my throat raw into my pillow.

Assignment 24, Day 1, 5:39am

Climbing into the cabin, I lugged my 'appropriated' supplies on my back. D watched, unblinking, as I secured the goods beside the mattress.

"You really don't want to know?" D asked smugly, self satisfied for reasons I did not have the capacity to learn.

Flipping them off, I ignited the engine. I put us in drive, and we were on our way.

8:11am

"Why are you here?" I finally broke the silence we'd driven in.

"Eh?" D shrugged their shoulders after a moment of thought.

"Seriously? Why?" I pressed, not throwing in the towel easily.

With an impossibly long groan, D said "fiiiiine. I'm looking for something. I figure that," D pointed to the cargo, "might lead me there."

"Dare I ask what that 'something' is?" I made air quotes with one hand, keeping the other on the steering wheel. 

"Answers. Just leave it there." D stated, then shot their head against the windshield. "Pull over. NOW!"

Pulling over and flooring the break, the truck skid to a stop. Not waiting for it to stop fully, D had already vanished.

Wasting no time, I unzipped my bag. Loading up, I carefully surveyed my surroundings.

**WHOPAH!** something crashed in the middle of the road so violently, the street lamps were toppled. Crunching across the pulverized pavement, I saw a true demon.

Fiery crimson skin pulsed with bright, ancient symbols. Each step it took, I found it harder and harder to breathe.

"Aeshma! Not another step!" D demanded, arms spread to block the demon's approach.

"You! What business have you, ancient one?" Aeshma snarled, baring swordlike fangs. Peeling skin tore as the demon revealed more and more teeth.

"That I'd none of your concern, child. Why have you come?" D demanded with an equally intimidating presence.

Just as I thought I would pass out from oxygen deprivation, air rushed back to my lungs in a painful wave. Gasping for breath, I fought to hold my rifle.

"That portal… I need it" Aeshma sighed, cheeks knitting back together. The runes retreated into their crimson skin then they knelt before D.

"Rise, child. I offer you a compromise. Leave us be until I have satisfied my own curiosity, then you may take what you seek." D's voice reverberated, as though echoing hundreds of times, all at once.

"That is… agreeable-" Aeshma said, disappearing upwards. Aeshma left one nasty pothole, in case you were wondering.

Nonchalantly, D paced back to the passenger side, then hopped back to their seat. After some time of my gawking at them, D shrugged. "What? I didn't know Aeshma was coming until they were nearby."

Mouthing out the word 'what' silently, D shrugged again.

"I don't ask about your private life."

Sighing, I crawled back to the mattress and shut my eyes. I planned on sleeping this off like a bad hangover.

5:32pm

"Hungry?" D prodded, landing another wet willy.

"Stop that, asshole!" I spat, slapping the disgustingly long finger.

"Seriously though, how are you?"

*What a loaded question.*

"Yeah, I'm hungry." I said, dodging the second question.

Frowning, D shut the off engine. "I'll refuel the truck. Go get yourself something."

Navigating the gas station aisles, I plucked an iced coffee, cinnamon bun, and some other snacks from the shelves. Walking to checkout, I found a line.

While waiting in line, an amber alert caught my attention. Turning to the wall mounted tv, my heart skipped a beat.

"-is highly dangerous and armed. Be on the lookout for-" the robotic voice of the broadcast droned, but I took off before any more. I knew the name of the suspect. That picture was unmistakable.

5:39pm

"What the fuck did you do!" I shouted, flooring the gas pedal.

"I tried telling you earlier" D defended, putting their hands up in surrender.

"Why am I wanted?!" I yelled, regretting my morning scream as my throat was beyond sore.

"As I was trying to tell you. Some officers came knocking. They were suspicious so I took your appearance and went with them. As I suspected, they weren't really police, so I…" D striked a beard that wasn't there, humming quietly.

"You what? Murdered them all?" I asked sarcastically.

After D drooped their head for a minute, saying nothing, I slapped my forehead. "How many?" I whimpered, feeling tears begin to well up.

"About two…" D trailed off, counting on fingers then slowly sprouting more and more to count on. "Ah, there we are. Two thousand ish."

I nearly swerved into the guardrail. Falling into insanity, I asked **"WHY?"**

"As I said, they were suspicious. When their chloroform didn't knock me out, and their bullets didn't stop me, I figured they were out for you. So I killed them."

"Dear God!" I gagged, breaking down in tears.

"Which one, there a few gods of deer?" D asked, unhelpful as expected.

"You fucked me." I stated, through the haze of outright dread.

"It was going to happen either way. How'd you get those?" D said pointedly, gesturing at my small arsenal.

"D has a point." My reflection added, speaking the truth I had already accepted.

"Shut up!" I begged both the mirror and D. I didn't want this. Fuck!
