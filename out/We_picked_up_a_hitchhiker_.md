These events start with me and two of my friends Bernard and Hector coming back from a long weekend at The Cape (Cape cod for any non new englanders here). Me and my buddies grew up with each other in Worcester, Massachusetts and once college came around we all kinda split up. Hector moved to Providence, Rhode Island and Bernard was just always busy with school while I was busy working in the trades. We decided to find a time where all of us weren’t busy and ended up renting a house out in Yarmouth for the Memorial Day weekend to just chill and hit the beach. After a great weekend of getting drunk and partying like we used to. It was time to head home. 

We took my car there which was perfect for the beach. My Volvo C70 convertible. After packing all our bags in the car we start driving back around 9 or 930 pm on Monday back to Providence to drop off Hector. To beat the traffic I hopped off I-495 onto route 44 going through Taunton and was just going to follow that all the way to Providence. It was getting late must have been around 10:30ish at this point and was pitch black outside no moon or stars insight tonight. 

As we were driving just passing Taunton about 3 or 4 miles passing the city limits we see him. A dirty looking fiery long red haired and red bearded looking hobo wearing a red flannel, filthy blue jeans and a giant backpack on his back holding his thumb out. As we pass him I look over to my buddies and say 

“Nobody else is gonna be on this road for miles and he’s out in the middle of nowhere we might as well help him out.” I say 

“Fuck that he looks sketchy dude.” said Bernard 

“Yeah I’m not trying to sit back here with him. Let’s just go home I’m tired as fuck.” Said Hector 

“Alright whatever I’m stopping for gas at the next gas station though. I’m almost on E”

We drive for about another 2 mile until we see the next gas station and I fill up my tank and go inside and grab some snacks with my friends. Getting back in the car I put my key in the ignition and just our luck my fucking battery is dead. I knew I should’ve changed the battery before this trip I was just being lazy and not even considering it being a problem. As we all stand outside my car trying to figure out what to do and who to call to get a jump we see the hitchhiker walking up to us. There’s no way this guy caught up with us this fast it’s impossible even if he full sprinted for the 2 miles when we first passed him there’s no fucking way this guy could’ve caught up with us. 

“Y-you boys need a jump?”
This is the first thing he said to us in a gravely smokers voice. How would he know we needed a jump in the first place we were just 3 kids standing outside at the gas pump and there’s no way he would know that if there was a problem that it was a dead battery. 

Bernard spoke up “The battery’s dead. Don’t suppose you can help us.” 

“Actually I can!” Said the hitchhiker as he reached in his giant backpack and pulled out a jump pack. 

“Shit thanks man you’re a life saver.” I said 

I popped the hood and he hooked up the cables turned on the jump pack and I started my car right up. 

“Thanks man really appreciate it we gotta get home now.” Said Hector with a kind of thanks dude now get the fuck out of here tone. 

“Hey C-can you boys do me a favor I just need a ride to Rehoboth. Y-you can just drop me off once we get a little bit passed the town line and I’ll walk the rest of the way. I-i see that you’re driving that way anyway and I-i I R-really need the H-help right now boys.” said the hitchhiker 

I look to my friends knowing that we pretty much don’t have a choice. I mean as weird as this guy seems he did just help us and he doesn’t seem dangerous. Sure he smells like week old piss but a 10 minute ride into a town we were already passing through seems like the least we can do for helping us out. 

“Yeah sure man hop in” I say 

“Oh T-thank you man I really really needed this” the hitchhiker said with a large toothy grin revealing his dark yellow teeth and puffy bright red gums.

He hopped in the backseat with Hector (who was looking very visibly uncomfortable), Bernard rode shotgun and I hopped back in the drivers seat and took off from the gas station back into the pitch black night. 

Pulling off from the gas station we start driving with the hitchhiker just staring out the window not saying a word. It was deathly silent in the car because for some reason my radio wasn’t picking up any channels which was weird cause it’s not like we were out in the boonies. Sure it was quiet and not a lot of houses around but not even a local station? Also broke my aux cord so we couldn’t even plug in a phone to listen to music that way. After about 5 minutes of silent driving Hector try’s to make conversation with the hitchhiker.

“So man where you from?”

No response from the hitchhiker 

“You from around here?”

Still no response 

“Yo can you hear me man?”

The hitchhiker breaks out in an ear piercing laughter. It took us all by shock and I lost control of the wheel momentarily from the sudden outburst. The laugh was so loud and  encompassing you could barely hear anyone or anything else. Bernard was holding his hands over his ears screaming “WHAT THE FUCK!” Which was barely audible over the laughter. I was cringing and covering my right ear with my hand as my left was holding onto the wheel and Hector was screaming something that wasn’t audible to me at the hitchhiker and reached out to grab him when he put a hand on his shoulder the hitchhiker grabbed Hectors hand, turned his head to look at Hector with wide eyes, pulled out a knife from his pocket and stabbed Hector three times in the chest. Me and Bernard are staring in awe at what we just saw from the front seat and as I try to pull over and slamming on the brakes the hitchhiker lunges at me and grabs the wheel still screeching his crazy laugh. He yanks the wheel to the right going directly into the woods and even though I was slamming on the brakes and tugging back at the wheel it still wasn’t good enough to avoid the tree. 

I slammed my head on the steering wheel in the crash and was knocked unconscious for a few seconds when I look around the front end of the car was smashed in and smoking, the airbags were deployed, Bernard was bleeding from his head just like I was, and Hector was on the floor in the back clutching his chest struggling to breath with blood coming from his mouth. All this with no sign of the hitchhiker. I shake Bernard trying to get him out of his daze and as I’m shaking him I look through the passenger window next to him and for a split second I saw the hitchhikers face in the window smiling from the outside. I jumped back in fear and quickly wiped the sweat and blood from my forehead wound out of my eyes and once I did the hitchhiker was gone from the window. I frantically looked around seeing where he could have gone and jump out of the car with a sudden burst of adrenaline. I run around all over the car and the immediate area and the hitchhiker is nowhere in sight. Bernard now coming out of his daze opens his door and falls out. Running to his side I help him to his feet. 

“Hector!” I screamed in the backseat 

“HECTOR ARE YOU OK BRO!” I screamed 

“Help me.” He said gurgling up more blood onto his chin. 

“Help me grab him out!” Bernard screamed still obviously out of it.

Me and Bernard pull Hector from out of the wreckage and lay him up against a tree. Bernard calls the cops screaming to get an ambulance to us and that some homeless guy stabbed our friend and crashed our car. The police and ambulance showed up after 5 minutes. I guess we were lucky that we were so close to Rehoboth or else Hector might not have made it. As two EMTs rushed Hector on the stretcher into the ambulance two other EMTs showed up in another ambulance and tended to mine and Bernard’s injuries. The police started asking me and Bernard questions about what happened and how our friend got stabbed. When we explained the whole situation and that a red headed homeless guy stabbed Hector and crashed my car the cops got wide eyed and looked at each other awkwardly. They put away their note pads and told us they would look into it. 

“What? What do you mean you’ll look into it? The fucking guy is still out there in the woods or around here somewhere he didn’t just fucking disappear.” Bernard said

“We have other units looking right now son trust me. Now go with the EMTs they want to take a closer look at both of you.” Said one of the younger cops 

“What do you mean you didn’t even call anything in!” I chimed in. 

“Go now kid we’ll take care of it.” The younger cops partner said 

Me and Bernard were quickly shuffled into the ambulance and brought to the hospital. Me and Bernard both knew that something was up. The cops knew something we didn’t and were doing nothing to try and find this guy. For what reason I’m still not sure. It’s a year later now and all of us are still shaken up about this. Hector healed up fine, Bernard moved across the country to the west coast and I’m still living in Worcester. The police never followed up with us or tried to ask us more questions about the stabbing or the hitchhiker. I’m surprised they never even tried to pin it on me or Bernard. They just never got back to us and swept it under the rug basically but that’s neither here nor there. Oh and another thing to this day sometimes when I’m driving I’ll get a feeling I’m being watched and look over to my passenger window and see the hitchhikers face staring back at me. Smiling his impossibly wide smile.
