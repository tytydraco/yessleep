I don’t remember when the shadows first appeared. Maybe they were always there, lurking in the corners of my vision, waiting for the right moment to make themselves known. But now, they’re all I can see.

It started subtly. Little things at first—a misplaced book, a flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye, whispers I couldn’t quite make out. I chalked it up to stress. Being a single mom isn’t easy, especially with a three-year-old who’s just discovered the joys of running and shouting. I thought I was just tired.

Then one night, as I was tucking Ellie into bed, I saw them. The shadows. They danced along the walls of her room, forming the shapes of children—playing, laughing, living. I blinked, and they were gone. Ellie looked at me with those big, innocent eyes of hers and asked, “Mommy, who are the kids in my room?”

I forced a smile, kissed her forehead, and told her it was just her imagination. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.

Days turned into weeks, and the shadows became more persistent. They followed me everywhere—at home, at work, even in my dreams. They whispered secrets, promises of things to come, glimpses of a future I didn’t want to see. Ellie growing up, becoming a rebellious teenager, falling in love, leaving home. And something else, something darker. An accident. Blood. Pain. 

I tried to talk to someone about it—my mother, my friends—but they all gave me the same concerned look and suggested I get some rest. “You’re just stressed, dear. You’re doing a great job with Ellie, but you need to take care of yourself too.”

But it wasn’t just stress. I knew that now. The shadows were real, and they were trying to tell me something. I became obsessed, spending hours staring at the walls, waiting for them to appear. Ellie started to withdraw, confused by my sudden distance. I could see the fear in her eyes, and it broke my heart. But I couldn’t stop.

One night, as I was lying in bed, I saw it clearly for the first time. Ellie, grown up, standing in the middle of the road. A car speeding towards her. I screamed, but no sound came out. I tried to reach out, to pull her back, but my body wouldn’t move. The car hit her, and everything went dark.

When I woke up, I was in the hospital. My mother was there, holding my hand, tears streaming down her face. “You had a breakdown,” she said. “They found you in Ellie’s room, screaming about shadows.”

They kept me in the hospital for a while, pumped me full of medications, and eventually sent me home. But the shadows are still here. They never left. They’re quieter now, lurking just out of sight, but I know they’re there, waiting.

I don’t know what’s real anymore. Maybe I am crazy. Maybe it’s all in my head. But every time I look at Ellie, I can’t help but see her future, and it terrifies me. I’ve tried to warn her, but she just looks at me with those same innocent eyes and tells me she loves me.

I love you too, Ellie. And I’ll do everything I can to protect you, even if it means fighting the shadows alone.
