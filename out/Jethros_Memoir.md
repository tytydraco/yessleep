I recieved a bachelor's degree in medical technology and was recently hired at a local blood bank as an assistant under the wing of Croix, a phlebotomist.

The first few weeks went great. I watched how blood was drawn, how they analyzed panels & how they organized the entire facility. Croix was a gregarious guy, always had a smile on his face. 

But I began to notice towards the end of my shifts that sometimes his energy at the start of the day waned. He looked pale, his social battery low, his smile weak. After a few days of this, I asked him if he was okay.

He told me that he had an unspecified medical condition in which his iron levels would drop and leave him exhausted. He said that his blood sugar would tank as well. I asked if there was anything more I could do to help him while at work such as taking on extra responsibilities to make things easier for him but he declined. 

One day in particular I stayed extra late cleaning and putting things back in their proper place as we were short staffed. The receptionist at one point explained to me that people suddenly quitting without notice was normal here. Convinced that it came with our line of work.

Instead of waiting to get home like I usually do, I decided to light a cigarette to get a good smoke in before I hit the road.

Suddenly, out comes Croix. "Hey Jethro!" he said with a wide smile. "Croix! Stayed a bit late today, yeah?" "Yeah, I had some paperwork to finish up" he said. "It's a Friday, want to go grab a drink?" I offered.

Croix stopped for a second thinking over the proposal in his head. "Yeah.. yeah, we can do that!" 

Me and Croix went to the local bar. One of a few as we lived in a relatively small town. We sat at the stools and accidentally bumped elbows. "Oops my bad" I said to him. But something peculiar was brought to my attention.

His skin was ice cold. This wouldn't normally mean much but it's the middle of summer and this is an open air bar. There's nothing cold about this place at all. He also didn't look sickly the way he usually does towards the end of the day due to his condition.

"How have you been feeling lately Croix? You look healthy man!" I said. 

"Oh yeah, never better. I started a new medication and it's doing wonders for my health. Enough about me though, how are you?" 

"Could be better, honestly. Me and my partner broke up a few days ago so I've been feeling a bit more stressed than usual" I said.

"Ah, I totally understand. Well if it makes you feel any better, I've always thought of you as someone anyone would be lucky to have" he said with a charming smile.

Me and Croix conversed and laughed well into the night. I had more than a few drinks & Croix had none. He opted to be the designated driver for me and I were to leave my car overnight to pick up in the morning.

The bar closes and we hit the road. He sounded concerned for my safety claiming that I was way past inebriated for my own good & that I could crash on his couch for the night considering I had told him that I had to go up three flights of stairs to get to my apartment. It was a much easier option compared to lugging me up that stairway, he reasoned.

He slinged my arm around the back of his neck and gets me to the couch where I lay down. He didn't turn on any lights and disappeared into the darkness of the hallway presumably to go to his room to sleep for the night.

The alcohol dehydrated me intensely and I thought it a good idea to meander into the kitchen and innocently get some tap water to quench my thirst. 

I open the cupboards and there were no glasses or plates. Everything is empty. I looked around and saw nothing. No laid out fruits or cereals. It's as if he didn't know a kitchen was here at all. Out of sheer curiosity at this point, I decided to open the fridge.

I found a large collection and arrangement of blood packs from our facility indiscriminate in type. "I knew it" I said with a smile flashed across my face. I shut the door and turn to exit the kitchen and suddenly saw Croix summon into sight in a series of after-images before lunging at me with his mouth open wide revealing large, carnivorous teeth.

I slammed my forearm across his sternum stopping him in his tracks before expertly drawing a stake from a discreet pocket I had and jamming it into his throat. 

Croix attempted to speak only able to muster up a sound akin to a gargle before evaporating into a confetti of ashes. "To that sound the beast is begone" I said before collecting myself & burping due to the lingering intoxication from the alcohol.

I heard faint muffled noises deep into the distance of his house on the second story. I walked up the stairs following the sound leading me to a door. I opened it and found coworkers from our facility who were under the assumption to have quit their jobs without notice completely restrained with taped over mouths. Clearly having been used as cattle for the vampire Croix.

I revealed a bottle of VX nerve agent and sprayed over their faces one by one, ensuring fatality.

There is a 43% probability of vampirism infecting a fed upon target. All vampire hunters a part of our organization undergo training in which it is imperative to follow protocol to not take any chance of the virus spreading.

It's been four years since I've joined. We have rotating social security numbers and faux means of identification to hunt these vampires nationwide. We forge college degrees attached to these identities to get into professions and facilities that are likely to contain them. 

There are strays that I've suspected and kept tabs on for months such as Croix before infiltrating his place of employment, and leaders banded under a covenant in high positions within society. They have plagued the planet for centuries, and must be eradicated.
