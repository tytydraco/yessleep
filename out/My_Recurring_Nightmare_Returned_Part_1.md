I have this recurring nightmare. I first had it when I was 7 but still have it from time to time. I wake up in my bed and look up to see a monster peering in from the hallway, through a cracked door. It would smile at me; a big, wide-eyed, toothy grin. Next thing I know, I’m under my dining room table. I don’t know exactly how I passed the monster, but my throat would burn as I was panting, somehow out of breath. It’s not clear in my mind, but I remember knowing I could watch the monster move as it looked for me, and that it made my stomach curl. How that’s possible, only knowing something but never seeing it, is only something a dreamscape makes true. I can, however, still hear the bones pop out and back in with each movement. It made my joints ache.  

Eventually, I would notice my front door was wide open. I’d wait for the monster to be distracted in the kitchen, then make a run for it. It would roar, or scream, or something. It was more of a shrill scream mixed with a burbling gargle that pierced my ears, rattling the bones around them including my jaw. It never mattered because I focused more on running.   

I could feel the wet, muddy grass beneath my feet as I ran into the small, wooded area near my house. No matter how fast I felt that I was running, it would always catch up. I’d trip on something: a rock, my own feet, or even, strangely, a small plastic doll like ones I’d play with in my waking life. I could never stand back up, my foot in so much pain, it felt broken.  

Then, I would turn and watch the monster stalk closer, breaking its jaw to open a wide, circular mouth with rows and rows and rows of sharp, curved teeth. Its breathing was always sick and loud, filled with wetness and rales. Then, It would make one shrill, gargled scream then I would wake up.   

It’s been years since I had this nightmare, often when I was under tons of stress or anxiety. More likely affected by insomnia I had as a child. In fact, I stopped having it after I dropped out of college, went through therapy, and fixed my entire sleep situation.   

It’s been two or three years now. I feel happier, I guess. I don’t think I’ll ever be the same. I try to completely close every door around me when I sleep or relax, or even when I’m busy or doing something. Though, the only door I can’t keep closed is my bedroom door. I have a cat, my whole world into one tiny furry creature. I don’t like locking her in or out, so I leave the door cracked. It wasn’t a problem until about a week ago.  

I had a nightmare again. By all accounts, I feel ridiculous, because I’m 21 now and shouldn’t be afraid. Yet, I’m petrified because this was new. I woke up, in my nightmare, on my couch instead of my bed. I sat up and looked forward through the living room and straight through the dining room to the large sliding glass door twenty-five feet away. There sat a monster, the monster, my monster, outside. He stared at me, smiled as usual, then raised one of his horrifically long fingers and gave a small tug to the handle.   

For some context, I never open this door. The deck is withered with rotten wood, and no one has really used it since I was 8. It’s decrepit and held up by a car jack. It’s one of the original parts of the twenty-year-old house that was never taken care of. All this to say, the door has been locked for at least 13 years, give or take a handful of times the door was open when my dad set off the smoke alarm making dinner.   

Yet, this small tug, something that seemed barely able to open an unlocked car door, opened this door with ease. The sound hit my ears like nails on a chalkboard, the rusted and old mechanisms grinding against one another for the first time in what felt like a lifetime. However, it was all the more pleasant than the creaking floorboards under the monster as it crawled into the house. It was maybe twenty feet away, and I was petrified, frozen to the couch. I could feel the frigid winter air wafting into the house as if this were real. The scariest thing was that he didn’t move; he just sat and watched me. Smiling, like my fear was entertainment. Then, he gave a short glance around our space, turned, and left. Then, I woke up.   

I keep reminding myself that it’s just a nightmare. It means nothing other than, I’m stressed and should probably relax. Yet, when I come home from work, I hear footsteps behind me. When I’m getting into bed, I hear the creaking of the floorboards. Every night since has been the same nightmare. I keep seeing things. Ads for what to do if someone were to break in, movies with monsters, YouTube videos with amalgamated creatures and wide eyes.  

I think something is wrong. I can feel it. The universe is telling me something that I don’t know or something! Nothing about this is normal or coincidental. Last night, during the nightmare, I could speak.  

“What are you?” I asked. He smiled at me.   

“Why are you here?” I asked. He took a breath, wet and popping, but he didn’t respond.  

“What do you want?” I asked with more vigor in my tone. He looked down at his emaciated form then back at me. “Hungry...” I said simply, responding for him. He smiled impossibly wider.   

“Why won’t you leave me alone?” I yelled. It echoed off the walls. The monster took a sharp breath in and screamed at me, shooting a wet and bloody mucus at me. The sharp sound cut off by an agonal cough. The mucus burned my skin and I screamed. I wiped it with my hand, which turned as white as paper. I looked back up at the monster as I shook with pain. His face wide, pale, eyes wide, and mouth large, with barely contained teeth, and always leaked mucus. He smiled at me, then lifted one long finger. He pointed at me, then himself, then to the floorboards. He tapped once, twice, then breathed in.  

“...You...Henry...” He muttered through a strange cough. "You..." 

I woke up immediately after that. I have never been more petrified, I’ve been awake since 4 am, since I woke up. I've never been able to speak with it before. It's never waited for me to say anything. I don't understand. These dreams won't stop, and I'm scared that this is more real than I thought it was. 

I didn't go to work today; everyone is calling me. I haven't eaten. I'm chain smoking. I'm too scared to leave my room.
