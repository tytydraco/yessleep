I moved into the apartment at the beginning of the fall. The property wasn’t anything to brag about, but I was excited to move into a space without being burdened by roommates. Introverted as I am, having my own space was significantly worth the increased rent. A few weeks in, I was finally finished unpacking (it had taken longer than I wanted as I only had time to unpack between ten-hour shifts), sighing a breath of relief at completing such a strenuous task. One evening I finished cleaning up after making myself dinner and headed to the bathroom to do my business. As I flushed, I noticed the water didn’t refill in the bowl, so I cursed under my breath - another thing to add to my list of chores. I searched for a plunger and did my best to unclog the bowl, but despite my efforts, it refused to fix itself. With each flush water kept filling the bowl higher and higher until I decided to give up on it entirely, opting to buy product at the store.

  
Thanks to my unforgiving schedule, I wasn’t able to return to the problem until three days later, as a light, sour smell emitted from the toilet. It wasn’t that of human waste but something sulfuric and metallic that burned my nose hairs upon re-entering. I turned the fan on and removed the packaging around the drain snake I purchased from the local department store, reading the instructions carefully. Placing the end of the auger into the bowl, I cranked the side and slid the cable down into the toilet’s pipes, extending it slowly foot by foot until it reached the source of the clogging. Two minutes in, I brought myself back from my wandering thoughts to the cable in my hands, noticing I’d already used more than half and I still hadn’t found the source. By the five-minute mark, I had used the entire 25 feet worth of cable, unable to go much further. I’m hardly a plumber by any means and garner most of my skills from practice, youtube videos and advice parted from my father, so I shrugged it off, assuming this was standard procedure. I pushed it back and forth, and by the third push, it froze in place, refusing to budge. I re-adjusted my grip and pulled with all my might, spending fifteen minutes straining to get it unstuck to no avail. I tried to crank it back up, but the entire auger was fastened into place as it caught on something strong and adhesive. Feeling like I fucked it up, I left the bathroom exasperated and called over a friend for assistance.

  
“The hell did you do?” He said with a smug grin, ogling the auger.

  
“Don’t even start,” I warned with a pointed finger, brows knitted into a look of annoyance. He threw up his hands as a sign of apology. “I’m not picking on you, Hannah, these things are obnoxious sometimes.”

  
“Can you help?” I sighed, trying to calm myself down.

  
“I’ll see what I can do,” He replied, and I gave him space to work his magic. 

  
He tried what I had done, grabbing the drill and attempting to wiggle it loose. No luck. He attempted the crank and met with the same results. He tried a combination of both, and I stood behind him to help. With some combined effort, we finally loosened it enough to pull it free and retract the cable back into the snake. 

  
“You’re a lifesaver, Ty.” I patted his back with appreciation. “I can finish it up if you’d like.”

  
“No worries, I’m almost done.” He nodded, wiping sweat from his forehead. As he was down to the last five feet, a crimson-red bubble of blood sprout forth from the hole. We froze.

  
He struggled to find the right words, but I laughed nervously, speaking for him.

  
“Gross. My bad,” I said. I’d only used the toilet a handful of times, and as a woman, the blood could easily be written off.

  
Seeing me connect the own dots in my head, Ty relaxed. “Yeah, this toilet sucks. You should see if the apartment complex has its own plumbing services.”

  
He continued, slower this time, and our relief was very short-lived. More blood surfaced to the water in the bowl, far more than I could write off as menstrual-related, and we grew incredibly worried. A cold sweat trickled down my spine as Ty’s arm began to tremble. Despite my increasing anxieties, I took the drain snake from him to spare him further grief and withdrew the last two and a half feet on my own. The tip of the auger, which was nothing more than a tightly wound metal coil, like the springs you’d find in a bed frame, was struggling to finish the journey and make its way out. As I pulled against the snake, small chunks of reddish-pink bits floated to the surface of the blood-filled bowl, and Ty recoiled with a gag. The sulfuric smell returned tenfold, morphing into what I’d have to guess was the odor of rotting flesh. The chunks of flesh floated atop like pieces of animal fat, glossy and soft from increased water exposure. With a heart beating fast enough to break my sternum, I yanked the auger with a surge of force, not caring about damaging the toilet, and almost fell backward as a large mound of red fleshy mass freed itself from the confines of the hole. If you’ve ever had chunks of batter compacted into a whisk while stirring, this was a similar sight. 

  
Now Ty had properly thrown up into the sink to our left while I stood mouth agape, entirely dumbfounded. I could only guess someone had attempted to flush parts of a cadaver or unidentifiable mammal, for reasons I couldn't comprehend. What I was looking at was not anything that belonged in the toilet’s pipes, and my gut told me it had been in there long before I moved in. I dropped the snake back into the bowl with disgust and shock, pushing Ty into the hallway for my phone. I promptly called the police and found it hard to explain what I found without sounding crazy, but they took me seriously and sent a patrol car my way. I found Ty in the kitchen attempting to rinse out his mouth, and I told him he was more than welcome to return home and skip out on this living nightmare, but he insisted on staying to comfort me. We poured ourselves glasses of scotch as the familiar wail of police sirens sounded down the street, red and blue lights flashing outside my window like a rave. The siren stopped and I opened the door for police officers to make their way inside, showing them to the restroom and filling them in on what transpired. They entered the bathroom with faces of mild disgust, pausing in the doorframe for a moment before turning back to me.

  
“I can already tell from a first glance that isn’t human,” One of the officers informed me.

  
“You can?” I asked incredulously. “Then what is it?”

  
“Likely some part of an animal. Why it’s in your pipes…” Her voice trailed off. 

  
They had someone come over to bag the remains for assessment, to rule out all possibilities of it belonging to a body. By the time they left, it was ridiculously late, and I thanked God I had a later shift.   
The ordeal lasted a few days, and when I tried to ask what they found out, I was met with radio silence. The toilet was removed and replaced free of charge, being asked by the owner of the complex directly I wouldn’t have to pay any installation fees so long as ‘I spoke of this to no one.’ The response I received raised a lot of red flags, but due to how much effort it took to get this apartment in the first place (thanks to the housing crisis), I was willing to put it behind me. Months had passed without issue, and I’d almost forgotten about the event entirely.

  
One evening while drawing myself a bath, something I did after really stressful shifts, I filled the tub with water and added a few bath salts for more of a relaxing effect. I slipped into the water and shivered as the water pricked at my bare skin, allowing myself to wash away the annoying customer interactions and snarky remarks from my supervisor out of my mind. My eyes had been closed for a few minutes before I reached over to grab my shampoo bottle. Accidentally knocking it into the water, I opened my eyelids to retrieve it and gasped. The tub had turned a reddish pink, so I sprang from the tub and checked my legs. It wasn’t my week, but an early cycle wasn’t underheard of. I wiped with a folded piece of toilet paper, which came back clean, albeit wet from the water clinging to my skin in thick droplets. Confused, I turned back to the tub disappointed, and pulled up the drain. As soon as I did, blood billowed forth and bubbled to the surface, and I screamed. With the blood came more chunks of flesh and teeth - human fucking teeth. 

  
I wrapped a towel around my body and called 911.

  
“911, what’s your emergency?” The respondent answered.

  
“Hi, I called a few months before in October. There was blood in the pipes for my toilet and now that same blood is in the pipes for my bathtub.”

  
A second long pause, then. “Is this Hannah Gonzalez?”

  
“Yes, this is she. I live on 2359 West-”

  
With that, the call ended. I froze in utter disbelief. Have you ever been hung up on by the police? Is that even fucking legal?

  
I called Ty, but it went straight to voicemail. I remembered then he had a night shift, and likely wouldn’t pick up.

  
Beginning to panic, as I watched the tub gurgle like a person choking on water, spouting items I’d never suspect would ever even fit down the drain in the first place. Chunks of hair, only some of which were mine (I was a platinum blonde so it was easy to tell). More teeth, some fingernails. By the time the water and blood re-entered the drain, leaving behind a collection of miscellaneous parts on the floor of the tub, I felt as though I would faint.

  
An entire toe was among the items, severed at the knuckle and wrinkled like an elastic raisin or prune. Globs of translucent discharge sat in clumps like large boogers. A few earrings I don’t recall owning.  
As if in some kind of panic-induced frenzy, I ran across the house with only a towel, soaking wet, turning on every tap and faucet. I figured out it had to be one at a time before the clear water would turn murky, as every drain it reached became discolored with red fluid. The water itself was not the source of the issue, but the contents within the pipes below filled quickly, showing signs of improper drainage. Issues I'd overlooked as flaws of the space itself.

  
By the time I’d done my experiment, my hair was damp and my skin was dry. I had cried from hysterics but now was surprisingly calm in a numb sort of way. In a bowl once used for baking I had myself a collection of bodily remains that looked like it belonged on a psycho killer’s shrine. Like I’d walked a newly massacred battleground and collected scraps of bloodshed the way you’d wander a field picking flowers as a child. Instead of chunks of fallen soldiers, I found remnants of countless unknown people, possibly victims, sprinkled across my apartment in a desperate attempt to dispose of evidence.   
Scraps of clothing, wedding rings, eyelashes. A chunk of someone’s eyeball, another toe. Some of the pieces of torn-off skin had parts of a tattoo inked onto the surface. Some of the nails were painted.   
Some of the teeth were baby teeth.

  
I spammed 911 with an onslaught of calls, but each time I was met with a busy signal. I didn’t care. I kept calling, over and over, for the better part of an hour.

  
Finally, my phone rang. I accepted before reading the caller ID.

  
“Sorry, I had my hands full with patients,” Ty answered, sounding sincere. “What’s up?”

  
I didn’t reply, because I didn’t trust myself to speak. 

  
Ty: “Hannah? I can hear you breathing. Is everything ok?”

  
I struggled to keep my hand steady, to keep myself conscious. How could I possibly explain, in words, what I had found?

  
That amongst the toes, the skin, the teeth, the jewelry, I had fished deeper into the pipes. Stuck my arm inside, and dug deep into its contents.

  
That underneath the handfuls upon handfuls of remains, we’re larger, better-hidden finds.

  
Ty: “Fuck. Ok, I’m coming over, please don’t hang up.” 

  
I collapsed to the floor. He was there quicker than I expected and found me in a state of shock. He tried to snap me out of it, brush the hair from my face, and get me off the ground and into some clothes.

  
Away from the pile of thigh fat, of a placenta, and parts of a kidney. Large chunks of human meat ripped open with what were undeniably teeth marks.
