I’ve been addicted to cleanliness for as long as I can remember, stained clothes? I’ll handle it. Dirty floors? I’m on the case. There’s no mess I won’t clean.

Many people see what I do as charity work. “She’s such a polite young lady, last week she cleaned the diner for no cost!”

“I’ve never seen her not cleaning, I spilled some drink in the pub and she cleaned it up before I could say anything.”

“Sometimes I wonder why she’s so…weird? Polite? I don’t know.”


Well, I guess the context is important to my tale, so I’ll explain everything.

My family was, needless to say, unhygienic. Rotten food scattered across the piles of garbage and old newspapers. The  excrement of various rodents covered the kitchen counters and table. A foul stench of death and decay surrounded our house, like a suffocating blanket.

Now, don’t get me wrong. My parents weren’t in the smallest bit abusive, they really tried to do everything in their power to help us. But after the cold embrace of death took my brother, they had all but given up on trying to clean. I think some parts of him were still in the garbage, acting as a source of life for the rats and maggots.

Even after all that had happened to my family I never lost hope. My sister, Grace, always seemed positive. I never once saw her with a look of anger or sadness on her face. Part of me thinks she was content with her life, the other part knows she was wearing a false face.

My world fell around me when I saw her lying on the carpet in a puddle of her own blood, a look of content on her face. The next few hours are fuzzy, but I recall my parents coming in and freezing. Collapsing on the floor in a heap of sadness and destruction, crying into each-overs arms.

I stood there staring. Feeling not sadness, nor anger’s but disgust. I stared at her body and felt filth radiating off her like body heat. Over the next few days I did nothing but clean while my parents cried in their room. I scrubbed at the impossibly stained walls, bagged many tonnes of rubbish to be purged from this world, what felt like hundreds of pests stared at me with fear as I twisted their little necks and chucked them in the bag, feeling nothing.

I felt the filth of the room slowly placate as I slaved away until only the carpet remained. A distinct filth surrounded the carpet and no matter how much I scrubbed the carpet didn’t want to let go of Grace. I boarded the room up and vowed to never enter there again.

As days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months. The house slowly recovered from its depravity, shining countertops reflecting the gleaming faces of shocked family members. Floors and walls looked as if they were part of a freshly made home, for the first time in forever, the stench was gone.

My parents, similar to the house, slowly recovered. They showered me with praise and love. They began letting old friends visit for the first time in forever, they were finally happy.

But I couldn’t be happy, I felt the filth everywhere. As the years past, I grew up, met a clean young man and got married. Having kids in the same year, they felt clean.

This was until that fateful day. I felt the wave of filth overtook me on my walk home from work. Wrapping around me like a wicked force and spreading its filth throughout me like a pestilence.

I lay on the cracked path, bloodied and bruised as the group of drunk men walk away laughing and chatting like nothing happened. I looked down at my torn clothes and felt filth radiating through me like a flowing stream, I couldn’t move or speak. I could only lay there like a pile of trash until my husband found me and called the police. They asked me many questions but I couldn’t answer any of them, only noticing the filth infesting everything around me like an invasive weed.

I did everything to try to remove the filth from my life. Hours on hours of cleaning everything around me. My hands peeled and scabbed while and my body swelled from the excessive amount of cleaning spray but I couldn’t stop. Even as hunger and dehydration caused me to drift in and out of consciousness I couldn’t stop. I felt the filth inside of me grow and breathe, like a tumour.

I lay here on the motel bed, the filth banging against my stomach as if I’m a drum. The knife feels cold in my damaged hand but I feel happy. Tonight the filth will be leaving my body.

If you’re reading this don’t try to help me. This is what I want, this is what I need, I can finally be happy.

I wonder if they will clean me up for my funeral?
