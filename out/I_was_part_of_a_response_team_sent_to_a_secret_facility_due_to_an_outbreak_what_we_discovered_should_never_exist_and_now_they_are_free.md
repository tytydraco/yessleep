I don’t know how much time I have, my hands won’t stop shaking and my lungs burn like I breathed in fire, but I need to get this out because I don’t know if I’ll make it out of the woods alive before whatever’s moving in the treeline finds me. If you’re reading this, you need to understand: Everything about Helixion Labs wasn’t a rumor. It wasn’t a conspiracy theory, It was real, and we released something that should’ve stayed buried forever.

I was part of a five-man response team—Commander Coleman, Matthews, Fields, Torres, and me. We were sent out in response to a containment breach at a classified facility, comms dead, casualties unknown. The kind of call we train for but pray never comes.

The classified facility called Helixion Labs wasn’t some civilian facility. It was government-funded, buried under fifty feet of reinforced concrete in the middle of nowhere. Genetic research, experimental evolution — stuff that should only exist in movies and fantasy. I’d heard the rumors: gene-spliced animals, human-animal hybrids, soldiers built to survive anything. I thought it was sci-fi nonsense, but I had no clue how wrong I was.

We touched down just after dawn, the fog sat low and heavy, swallowing sound before it reached the trees. The steel gate hung open, bent outward, like something had forced its way out.

Coleman informed us about the mission before we entered.

"We are to rescue any survivors, figure out what happened, find the generator room place charges down and escape the facility through the tunnel within the generator room that leads out to the woods," Coleman explained, "The door is locked with a code which I was given, once out the charges should detonate destroying the facility and everything it."

when Coleman finished we headed Inside, the power was down. Emergency lights washed the hallways in a suffocating red haze. There was no sound except for the soft hum of our gear and the occasional hiss of steam from broken pipes. The deeper we went, the worse the smell got — burnt flesh, blood, rot, and something chemical that clawed its way into the back of my throat.

We found the first body by reception, or what was left of it. A scientist, half his torso missing. His ribs were snapped outward like a blooming flower, his insides scattered across the floor. Someone had smeared a word across the wall beside him with trembling fingertips. 

RUN.

“Animal attack?” Torres whispered.

Coleman didn’t even glance at him. “No animal can do this.”

We pushed deeper into the facility, sweeping through the east hall — bullet casings, scorch marks, and shredded lab coats were everywhere. In one corner, a body was half-fused into the wall. Flesh and concrete blended seamlessly, like they’d been made of the same substance.

The elevators were twisted wrecks, so we took the maintenance stairs down to Sublevel 3 — Genetics Division. Every step we took echoed and my heart felt like it was trying to claw its way out of my chest.

Then we heard it — a scraping sound, metal on concrete.

Fields swung his light down the corridor, and for a second, I saw movement. Something pale, too fast to focus on.

“Stay alert,” Coleman ordered, “We aren’t alone. Watch your six.”

We found another body. The bones were soft, bent at impossible angles. The skin was melting off like candle wax.

Torres gagged, “jesus christ, what the fuck could do this?”

Then we heard breathing. It was slow, heavy, and wrong.

It stepped into view under a doorway it should’ve had to crouch beneath. Skin pale and almost luminous, like it wasn’t meant for light. Its jaw hung unhinged, teeth black and needle-thin, but its eyes — Christ, those eyes — were locked onto us with a human understanding that froze me in place.

Coleman fired first, but It moved faster than anything I’ve ever seen. It was on Fields before we could even blink.

It began tearing into him with claws like bone shards. The sound it made wasn’t a roar — it was like laughter, distorted, and mechanical.

We all opened fire. Bullets tore through it, but it didn’t fall. It screamed a high-pitched shriek that made my vision blur. 

When it slipped back into the vents, Fields wasn’t standing with us anymore. All that was left was a pool of shredded flesh, clothes, his gear, and blood.

We pushed on because we had to. Because stopping meant thinking about what we’d just seen.

Once we reached the control room, Coleman found one working video file. Most were corrupted but one still worked — a video feed from a containment cell. A man was strapped to a table, screaming. His back arcing as something in his skin seemed to shift, then his skin split open like a cocoon, and something crawled out. Something like the thing that killed Fields.

The file name burned itself into my mind:
SUBJECT 47B – REGENERATION TRIAL

Torres wanted to abort, but Coleman refused.

Sublevel 4 was worse. The air felt humid and alive. The walls pulsed softly, as if breathing with us. Something dropped from the ceiling—thin, pale, faster than the eye could track. Matthews fired instinctively.

The muzzle flash lit up others hanging along the walls, clinging like spiders, but shaped like people halfway through becoming something else. They crawled on all fours, bones cracking with each movement.

We ran but they chased after us, screeching. One leaped towards Torres and latched onto his leg. I turned and fired point-blank, blowing half of it off him — but its tendrils were already burrowing into his skin. He screamed in pain until his voice became a gurgle.

They began to swarm him, their tendrils writhing under his flesh, hollowing him out, and when they finished, they dragged what was left of him up the wall — using him like an egg sac.

We sealed off Sublevel 4 and caught our breath, but Coleman kept us moving. Not for the mission but for our sanity, for the illusion that we still had control.

Matthews’s tracker picked up faint readings — multiple signals moving slowly, and erratically.

“Could be survivors,” I said, my voice cracking.

“Doubt it,” Matthew replied, “No one could’ve survived this.”

Coleman sighed, “He’s right, but we check anyway.”

Then came the sound — faint at first, then rising.

Singing.

A soft, lilting melody, out of tune but hauntingly familiar.

A lullaby. One every child knows, but half a beat off, like someone remembering it wrong.

The sound led us to a chamber where the air was hot and wet, reeking of decay, with cables dangled from the ceiling—only they weren’t cables. They swayed and twisted with the rhythm of the song. Something wet splattered on Matthews’s shoulder, and when he looked up, he froze mid-breath. 

The ceiling wasn’t metal. It was flesh with living tissue. The cables weren’t cables. They were intestines and tongues dangling down with nerves wrapped around them.

There were also dozens — maybe hundreds — of human mouths embedded in the surface. Lips cracked and twitching, teeth clicking in perfect harmony. Some mouthed silent words while others sang in fractured tones. Their tongues stretched downward, questing through the air.

“Jesus Christ…” I whispered.

Then they began to scream, All of them. The sound inverted, like suction turned inside out.

Matthews opened fire and blood or something like it rained down in sheets, sizzling as it hit the floor, but the mouths didn’t stop. They formed words that didn’t belong to any language.

Suddenly a tongue lashed down, wrapping around Matthews’s throat. He clawed at it, eyes bulging. I grabbed his legs and pulled, the tongue tore loose, but so did half his throat. He died immediately in my arms.

The mouths began to laugh.

Coleman hurled an incendiary grenade and fire consumed the ceiling, flesh popping like oil. The singing stopped and was replaced by shrieks fading into silence.

When the flames died, only two of us remained.

We made it to the security wing. The backup power flickered to life. In those brief seconds of light, we saw into the reinforced cells—shapes that might once have been human, or animals, or both. Bodies caught mid-transformation, frozen in poses that felt painfully wrong.

That’s when I realized — all those rumors about Helixion weren't wrong. The abominations in the cells were soldiers, failed prototypes. They were trying to build evolution itself — and they succeeded.

We found the generator room and set charges. He ordered me to cover the door.

When Coleman placed the last charge, I heard breathing from above. It began to speak with voices that didn’t belong together like switching between radio stations.

It dropped down suddenly on Coleman, pinning him down with a loud thud. This one was different this time — bigger, more complete. Like the others we encountered had been prototypes or between evolving, and this was the final product. 

Its body was a patchwork of people, stitched together perfectly. I saw pieces—familiar ones—in its shape. Faces I knew, eyes I recognized. Not dead, not alive, they were just… present. 

Its mouth opened vertically, splitting its head in half, revealing rows and rows of needle sharp teeth.

Coleman screamed for me to run, but I hesitated, God help me, I hesitated.

“That’s an order, Martinez! RUN! Use the tunnel — code 8593! NOW GO!”

Then it began to tore him apart, ripping through flesh and bones like butter. Coleman didn’t scream, he didn’t go out without a fight, stabbing it with his knife until his whole body went limp.

I fired at the abomination until my rifle clicked empty. After it was finished with Coleman who was just a pile of torn flesh and blood. It looked towards me and just stared — and then it spoke.

It wasn’t in words, but the last thing I heard before the blast was the creature mimicking Coleman's voice perfectly, begging me not to leave him.

I don’t remember entering the code on the keypad, the tunnel, or how I reached the woods. I just knew I wasn’t alone when I got there.

When the charges blew, the facility collapsed—but the forest moved in ways that didn’t match the wind. As I watched from the ridge I found myself on, I saw shapes crawling out of the rubble, there were dozens, maybe even hundreds making their way into the woods. 

I’ve been hiding for three hours. My radio is dead and the woods have gone silent, like everything here is holding its breath.

I’m using my phone to get this out, I’ve already tried calling and texting but the services went out. The creatures probably took out the towers cutting off anyone in the area from the rest of the world.

Thankfully the internet is still working so posting this is my only way to warn everybody. I know releasing this information will cause me to lose my job but I don’t care. I’ll do my best to keep everyone updated.

If anyone is reading this, don’t send help, don't even investigate, just spread this post around to warn everyone of what's coming and prepare your homes.

Because they're above ground now and they’ve evolved into the perfect killing machines.
