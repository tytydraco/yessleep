AP:  Hot take!

CM:  Got no filter, babe, raw dogging the microphone brother.  And speaking of raw dogging, guys do you ever have trouble when it comes to-

CM:  So, this fuckin’ mark slides into Page’s DMs, and he’s all going “you gotta go to this house in Buffalo, dude,” and Page is like, “fuck Buffalo, dude, they stiffed us from three shows ago,” and he’s like “no dude, there’s a haunted house, like my grandpa lives up there, and-”

AP:  His grandpa was a carny, and ran a museum.

CM:  That was smooth, babe.

AP:  Thanks babe, so we meet this guy, let’s call him Bob.

CM:  “Bob,” dude?  How’d you come up with Bob?  His name’s Steven.

AP:  He asked not to be identified on air.

CM:  Shit, sorry brother, we’ll fix it in post.  Bleep that dude.

AP:  Bob’s a stand up guy right?  He meets us at Applebee’s, and goes through the whole thing.

CM:  Bought us lunch.

AP:  We threw a bean.

CM:  Dude, remind me, brother, I got a bean story I wanna tell, remember Handsome Harry?  Holy shit, this guy.

AP:  Babe, save it for the Patreon.

CM:  Oh yeah, good idea, if you wanna hear about the time Handsome Harry wrestled in a kiddie pool full of beans, check out the links, they’re in the show notes dude.  But babe, darlin’ lay it on me, let’s get this thing back on track, what the fuck is up with this house?

AP:  Bob takes us to this old house, and it was fucking incredible.  Like, I stepped out the van and fell to my knees.

CM:  That was the Somas?

AP:  No, that was later.

CM:  Oh yeah.  Let me tell ya.  So this house was all done up in yellow and red stripe, like old timey circus tent style, but it was hella run down.

AP:  Haunted as fuck looking.

CM:  Yeah, he had totem poles and bears and shit carved out front.  One of those fucking fortune teller machines on the porch, and I was like “Holy shit, is this a Mills Novelty Verbal Fortune Teller, there’s only one of these left in the world.”

AP:  There’s two now.

CM:  We should have stolen it.

AP:  No filter, babe, don’t ‘gram your crimes.

CM:  I’m not saying I would brother, I mean I am, I’m not saying I did, I wished we had.

AP:  Kayfabe, babe, come on, we’re on the air.

CM:  We’ll fix it in post.

AP:  Anyway, he opens the door and it’s a mess inside.

CM:  Like holy shit, yeah, room was full stacked from floor to ceiling, brother, like newspapers.  Holy shit, bricks of newspapers from the door all through the fuckin’ hallway.  

AP:  Nerd.

CM:  Seriously dude.  It smelled like assballs.

AP:  I didn’t notice.

CM:  Yeah, you didn't, I heard you sniffin’...

AP:  What?  Later babe…hey did you see that thing on the wall?

CM:  Of hell yeah man, I forgot about that, it was like this frog or something that was painted onto the newspapers, like, how do you describe it?  They painted it onto the stacked newspapers.

AP:  It was so vivid, like the layered stacks or whatever gave it depth, and did you see its yes?

CM:  How do like painting eyes follow you?  Like how the hell do they do that, hold on…

\*typing sounds\*

CM:  Why…do…paintings…follow…eyes…enter…it's an optical illusion.  Lame.  

\*INAUDIBLE\*

AP:  So Bob leads us to this room, and he says, “This is the parlor, this is where Grandpa spends all his time,” and it’s this wooden door in the middle of the first floor.

CM:  He opens the door and holy shit.

AP:  Holy shit, man.

CM:  So like, let me paint a picture to you guys with my words bro, like Bob opens this door and the room is covered in dirt.  Not like a little bit of tracked in shit in from outside, like DIRT, the floor is one foot taller in this room than the other room.  Well, maybe 12 inches, babe, it ain’t one of my feet, you know what I’m saying?

AP:  Size 15.

CM:  That’s the real fuckin’ deal, brother, and that size 15 is gonna up Denim Bill Haggen’s ass sideways in three weeks when we return to Boise, Idaho at the Maple Grove Grange Hall.  Link in show notes, this one’s gonna be for the Deathmatch championship.  I’m gonna put that fat old man back on the couch where he belongs.

AP:  He owes us money.

CM:  That’s a shoot, brother.  But like the whole thing was dirt, and in the middle there was this mound that was like, four feet high and just all over the room, and there were like holes and shit in it, and this old naked guy was like laying on top of it, just hella sprawled out like a fuckin starfish, dude.

AP:  It was a bad angle, did you see his ass?

CM:  The worst, dude.  Old man taint, brother.

AP:  They get more wrinkly as they shrivel.

CM:  Bob lets us inside and closes the door with him on the other side, and I’m like, “Whoa dude, let us out brother,” and he’s like “No, feed the earth with your sins, bro,” and I’m like “Cast the first stone you stupid bitch,” you know?

AP:  You know that Simpsons joke when you hear the door slam and the footsteps off screen and the car squealing out? That’s what happened here.  Bob fuckin left, man.

CM:  Rude move, dude.  So like, this old guy hears us hangin’ and bangin’ and sits up like ‘Taker, and points at us.  And you’re recording all this, right?

AP:  Fuck yeah I am, this is creepy as fuck, like, holy shit, we’re gonna get a Netflix deal with this footage.

CM:  Fuck yeah babe, fuckin’ on it, fuckin’ brilliant, you’re like Edward R. Murrow with that shit, and you’re like narrating, like “holy shit, we just got locked in a room with a naked old guy!”  And-

AM:  And he like levitates!  

CM:  Seriously!  This floating ass mother fucker is all like- 

\*INAUDIBLE\*

AM:  It’s the grossest thing I ever saw, he’s like sitting straight up with his legs spread wide open, pointing at us with like four yellow teeth and his face is all gross and rotting and shit, and he’s floating toward us.

CM:  You see ‘em dangling?

AP:  How could I not?!  They were like six inches below him!  Are balls supposed to hang that low?

CM:  Brother, it was like a knee sock full of oranges, like he’s dipping those things in the toilet every time he sit down right?

AP:  So gross.  Like he had to get more altitude so they wouldn’t drag on the ground.

\*INAUDIBLE\*

CM:  …anyway, so he all hella levitates to us, and we back into this this corner.  I should have described the rest of the room right?

AP:  You didn’t?

CM:  Oh yeah, I fuckin’ did, you’re right, so like we move to the side and there’s this alter looking thing, and there’s this old porcelain doll and pictures and plants and shit around it, and the old man says something in Latin.

AP:  It was Esperanto.

CM:  You said that earlier, and it wasn’t fucking Esperanto, babe.

AP:  Fuck you Deal, it fucking was, I can speak it.  “Vi mensogis ne nur al homoj, sed vi mensogis al Dio.”

CM:  Brother?

AP:  It means, something about liars.  

CM:  That’s latin dude.  

AP:  Agree to disagree, babe.

CM:  I’ll agree you’re a babe, brother.

AP:  Aww!  Tell them what you said to the guy.

CM:  Oh yeah, I start cutting a promo on this guy, like “You’re an unclean spirit and shit, and we got you on camera, goatman, and your powers don’t work on us, cause we’re all like on the right hand path!” 

AP:  And he like lunges in the air at you.

CM:  Dude.  Like he got all up on me, and he was like, you ever felt a cocktail shrimp that’s been left out for too long, all hella rubbery and cold?  That was this guy.  And he like knocks me down, and he drags his balls on my Zubaz, and I’m like, “Whoa dude, kayfabe, this is work right?”  

AP:  I don’t think it was a work.

CM:  I know that now!  And you all hella stumble over and try to lift him off me, but he smacks you and you take a bump and tumble into that stupid doll, and it breaks open.

AP:  I was off balance.

CM:  You took a couple bumps before we went in didn’t ya?

AP:  Ixnay on the umpsbay.

CM:  We’ll fix it in post.  Speaking of bump, you wanna try some new shit?

AP:  Babe…

\*INAUDIBLE\*

CM:  Holy shit, that’s good!  So you took the doll and bashed his old ass, didn’t you?

AP:  Fucked him up, the dolls broke and that old ass letter fell out, and we grabbed it, and he started flopping and shit and holy shit, where’d you get this stuff from?

CM:  Danny the Split, he knows a guy, we gotta get that guy’s number.  

AP:   Yeah, let's wrap this up.  Well, the old guy burrowed into the dirt, we took the letter, kicked the door down and drove off.  

CM:  And your phone took a shit too didn’t it?

AP:  Yeah, whatever.  Holy shit, babe, you wanna play Madden on stream?  I’m bored.  Babe, I’m bored!

CM:  Yeah, that’s the show.  We’ll do a part two, if you want to see the letter, I’ll put it on the ‘gram, or if you want to buy it, slide into our DM’s.  If you know that Zach guy, let him know, we’ll cut him a real fuckin’ deal.  Like and subscribe, check out our links in the show notes, visit our sponsors, whatever, fuck it.
