I always thought grief would fade, that with time, the pain would dull, the silence would become less deafening. But it hasn’t. Every night, I lie awake, staring at the ceiling, still haunted by the same thought: *You were here, and now you’re not.*

It’s been five years since you died. Five years, and yet, I still hear your voice.

It started as a whisper. At first, I thought I was just imagining things. I would catch myself murmuring your name, just a soft echo in the back of my mind, but the response came too clearly. A gentle laugh. A “Hello, love.” I froze, heart pounding, but I told myself it was grief, playing tricks on me. 

Then came the dreams. Vivid and real, so much so that when I woke, I felt you beside me. Your hand on my shoulder. The warmth of your breath against my skin. We would talk, like we always did. Laugh, argue, plan our future. But the strangest thing? You never seemed to remember that you were dead.

“You’ve been gone a long time,” I whispered once, eyes wide, unable to understand the strangeness of the moment. “How are you here?”

And you, with that same reassuring smile, just chuckled. “I’m here because you’re still waiting for me.”

At first, I thought it was just my heart playing tricks, a desperate attempt to cling to something, anything, that felt like you. But it didn’t stop. The conversations continued, growing more frequent, more real. You would call me at random times, a voice coming from nowhere, like a shadow you could almost touch. Sometimes I would wake up, and your voice would be the first thing I heard. Sometimes, in the middle of the day, when I was alone in the kitchen, the sound of your laughter would fill the room. But I couldn’t see you. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t find you.

The logical part of me knows something’s wrong. You’re not supposed to be here. You’re not supposed to still be with me. But the other part—the part that has never let go, the part that still clings to you like a lifeline—welcomes it. How could I not? You’re still here. You’re still with me. Even if it’s not real, even if it’s only in my mind, it doesn’t matter. 

Or does it?

There’s a constant nagging voice in my head now, a sense that something’s off. You say things sometimes—little things, offhand remarks—that make me pause. You mention things I’ve never told you, memories we never shared. It’s almost as though you know things about me, things no one else could. I try to dismiss it, tell myself it’s just grief, a manifestation of my deepest desires to keep you close.

But then, last night, something changed.

I asked you, “Are you really here, or am I just losing my mind?” 

There was a long silence. I could feel the air grow heavy, thick with something unspoken. When you spoke again, your voice was different—distant, colder, and something else…unnerving.

“Are you sure you want to know?” you asked.

I don’t know what I expected. But not that.

For the first time, I felt it—something wasn’t right. And now, I can’t stop wondering: *Who, or what, have I been talking to all this time?*
