I can’t escape it. The orders have started coming in more frequently. It was at first one a day, but now, I’m doing two, three, sometimes even four orders a day, each time later in the night. 

It started getting so bad that I tried to decline the pickup, but my app froze. I closed the app and reopened it only to see that the order had been accepted and showed me the route to the store.

I still haven’t looked inside one of the bags yet. I tried, but the closer and closer I got to opening the bag, the more my head started to pound, a feeling of anxiety started to course through my body, and I could hear voices hissing at me angrily in languages I don’t know. I pulled my hand back, and it all stopped suddenly. Leaving me alone with the empty silence inside my car.

When I finished that delivery, the person who was there to receive the order looked different; they had a scowl on their face, and as I handed them the bag, they let out a low-pitched growl that seemed almost inhuman. When I turned back to my car, I saw that the person hadn’t left a tip. Was it because I tried to look in the bag? After that, I swore to never try and open an order again. 

I had had enough. Last night I needed answers. Maybe it was the liquid courage I had in my system, but I needed to know more. I wanted to investigate the shop. I had no orders, so I took the chance to make the drive.

I had made this drive countless times, following the same stretch of road, passing the same knocked-over trees, dodging the same holes in the road. But as I got to what I thought was the shop, it was just more road. 

A long, dark gravel road canopied with tree branches that reach over the road. I pressed on; surely I would have remembered this part of the drive. The road stretched on for what felt like miles. 

Then, I heard it. The all too familiar chime. I had an order. At this point, I didn’t even bother trying to accept the orders, as my app already was showing me the route to the shop.

I followed the route, continuing down this new road, only for the trees to open up into a clearing. The shop was sitting all alone, just as I had last seen it, with the order sitting tucked neatly in the locked freezer. 

As I approached the freezer, I could sense a pair of eyes glaring at me. I looked up to the second-story window and saw a figure standing there watching me. Has this person watched every delivery? 

I pounded on the front door, screaming for someone to come out. I needed answers. I slammed my fist into the wooden door over and over again, only stopping when I could feel blood oozing down my hand. 

I looked back up, and the figure was still standing there. I tried the handle. Locked. Defeated, I grabbed the order and headed back for my car. I

I made the delivery like normal, handed it to someone whose face I couldn’t even remember, and watched them go back inside. The moment their door closed, the tip came through.

But that feeling hasn’t gone away. I still feel like I’m being watched.
