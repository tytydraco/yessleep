Have you ever wondered if the person you love… is truly who you think they are?
I have.
Some nights I wish I never found out.

Years ago, my wife was diagnosed with cancer. I stayed by her side through every second of her breakdown. She had always been strong, the kind of person who held everyone else together. But after the diagnosis, she shut down. Locked herself in the bedroom for days at a time. Barely spoke. Barely ate unless I brought food to the door.

I tried everything to pull her out—walks in the park, silly movies, long drives. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes she’d even smile. But coming back home always made her fall apart again, as if the walls themselves drained her.

Eventually, she agreed to see a therapist. Slowly, very slowly, I watched sparks of her old self return. The smiles lasted longer. She talked more. She took her chemotherapy with a kind of calm determination.

And then she met him.
One of those street preachers who hand out pamphlets. I never knew exactly what he told her, only that his “divinity” would heal her. He never said a name, but you can guess which god he meant.

At first, I thought it was harmless. Hope is hope, right? If faith helped her cope, who was I to object?

But it didn’t stop at coping. It became obsession.

She started saying that god—not the doctors—was curing her. She clung to that idea like a lifeline. When she spoke about it, her eyes lit up with this feverish glow, like she was seeing something I couldn’t.

I wanted to believe her. I really did.

But then the strange days began.

If she missed a sermon, she’d get sick—sick in ways the doctors couldn’t explain. She shut herself in the bedroom again, but this time to pray. Hours and hours of whispered chants. She stopped seeing her therapist. Stopped taking her medication “because god will provide.”

When I questioned it, she lashed out violently.
That wasn’t like her.
None of it was like her.

One morning, I opened the bedroom door to ask if she wanted breakfast.
Just breakfast. That’s all.

She was kneeling by the bed, praying so fast and so quietly it sounded like hissing. A stream of words with no breath between them, no human rhythm—just pure, frantic devotion.

When she turned to look at me, I swear on my life the eyes staring back weren’t hers. They were empty. Wrong. Like something was wearing my wife’s face and trying to learn how humans blink.

I froze in the doorway.
She didn’t speak.
I quietly backed out and closed the door.

Through the wood, I heard her whisper again:

“Hail Mary, full of grace…”

Months later, our marriage crumbled under the weight of it all. We separated.
I tried to move on.

Then a few days ago, one of her friends called me.
She was worried.
My ex-wife had stopped bathing, stopped eating, started vomiting everything she touched. She wasn’t answering calls or opening the door anymore. She hadn’t been seen in days.

I still had a spare key.

We went together.

The moment we opened the door, a wave of rot—thick, wet, putrid—hit us. Her friend ran outside to vomit on the sidewalk. I covered my face with my shirt.

Inside, every wall was plastered with religious images, dozens of them overlapping—saints, angels, crosses, prayers scribbled on torn notebook paper. A suffocating collage of devotion.

And then we heard it.

Praying.
Soft, constant, frantic.

We approached her bedroom. The door felt heavy, like something was pushing from the inside. When we forced it open, the reason hit us:

Dead animals.
Piled behind the door.
Dozens of them.

She was kneeling at the edge of the bed. Skin stretched tight over her bones. Knees split open and bleeding, the floor beneath her stained dark from how long she’d been there.

Her voice was a trembling whisper:

“God will provide… God will provide…”

We called an ambulance.

When the paramedics arrived and tried to lift her, she began screaming—this guttural, feral sound that made every hair on my body stand up.

One paramedic gasped and stepped back.
My ex-wife turned her head toward us…

…and she had a live rat in her mouth.

I saw her jaw clench.
I saw blood.
I saw the rat’s skin tear as she bit down and ripped off a chunk.
The animal shrieked—a pitch I didn’t know existed—as she chewed, whispering through the gore:

“Thank you, god, for the food we are about to receive…”

They sedated her.
She’s in a psychiatric facility now.

But at night, when the house is quiet and I’m alone with my thoughts, I swear I still hear it—the crunch of tiny bones shattering between her teeth…
and the stifled screams of that dying creature.

Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I had opened that door sooner.
Sometimes I wonder if something else opened it first.

And worst of all…

I wonder if my wife was still in that room at all.
Or if something else had taken her place long before I noticed.
