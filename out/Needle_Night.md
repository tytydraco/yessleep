I’ve never been the type to write things down. Most nights on patrol just blend into one another, a blur of sirens, red and blue reflections on glass, the hum of the cruiser under me. But that night was different. I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel like if I don’t write it out, I might start forgetting, or maybe worse, start mixing it up with whatever else my head’s trying to show me.

The shift started out quiet. My longtime partner Mike and I were parked outside a rundown gas station near Vermont Ave, eating four-dollar sandwiches that tasted just like the plastic they came in. It was the kind of slow where every call we heard on the radio was someone else’s problem. I was halfway through complaining about the stale bread when we saw it: a beat-up silver Civic limping past, one brake light busted so bad it looked like an empty eye socket. I remember the way the tail light flickered weakly, like it was trying to stay alive.

I hit the lights. The car slowed right away, almost like the driver had been expecting it. That should have been my first clue. We pulled up behind him. The engine ticked in the heat as we got out. Mike flanked right, I went left, flashlight in hand. I was already planning the polite but firm spiel I’d give. "Evening, sir, you know why I pulled you over," all that. When I got to the driver’s side window, the smell hit me. Sharp and chemical, like nail polish remover mixed with moldy meat. It clung to the inside of my nose.

The guy in the driver’s seat, man, I can still see him. Hollow cheeks, skin sallow like candle wax, eyes darting everywhere refusing to meet mine. His lips were cracked, his teeth too small for his mouth. He anxiously rubbed his left knee with one hand while the other fished clumsily in his hoodie pocket. "License and registration," I said. Instead of handing them over like everyone else had that night, he leaned toward the center console. Fast as light, my flashlight caught the pale skin of his wrist, and then something metallic in his hand. At first, I thought it was a pen. Then, before I could even process it, let alone react as I had been trained to, I felt the jab.

It was quick, but not painless. A sting deep in the flesh of the back of my left hand, between my pointer finger and thumb. My brain froze for a second before the adrenaline hit, almost pausing completely. As I snapped out of it, I yanked my hand back so hard I felt the tendons in my wrist pop. I don’t remember shouting, but Mike told me later that I had yelled something. He was already dragging the guy out of the car while I clamped my other hand over the puncture. The needle, the actual syringe, clattered onto the pavement, blood soaking its tip.

The rest of the stop is a blur. Backup. Cuffed suspect. Evidence bags. EMTs.

As is protocol in these situations, they insisted I go to the hospital. After a long ambulance ride riddled with fear, I sat in a hard plastic chair for hours while they drew my blood, checked my vitals, and asked the same questions over and over. I remember staring at the monitor, watching my pulse on the little green line. It looked too slow, too steady, but maybe that was just me freaking out. The doctor, a guy in his late thirties, wedding ring, hair combed so flat it looked painted on, came back eventually and told me the news I had been praying to hear. No trace of benzos, heroin, LSD, crack, or opiates. The doctor told me through an uncomfortable stare that although I had been declared free of exposure to most major drugs, matters of exposure to potential STIs would have to wait a couple of days for the needle to be tested. "You’re clear to go home," he said, as if it was just a mere bee sting.

It was 4:00 a.m. by the time I got back to my apartment. The streets were empty, just the occasional hiss of a passing car. I didn’t even bother with lights, just tossed my keys on the kitchen island and went to the bathroom. After vomiting up my terrible sandwich from earlier, mostly out of nerves, I scrubbed the puncture with soap until the skin turned raw. Still, despite the good news, it felt wrong.

I collapsed onto the couch. My eyes burned from the hospital lights, and I told myself I’d just rest them for a minute. That’s when it began. It started as warmth. Not the cozy kind, more like the heat you get right after a deep breath during a panic attack. My heartbeat slowed in my chest, heavy and deliberate, like it was echoing inside me. My hands tingled. The shadows in my apartment stretched. That’s not a figure of speech. They literally stretched, bending toward me in slow, unnatural curves. My couch seemed to sink beneath me, like the cushions had turned to water. The room was melting at the edges, the lines of the walls warping and waving. In a state of total panic, I blinked, and suddenly the walls weren’t even there anymore. Nothing was. I was in an alley. Narrow. Wet. From what I recall there was no rain, but the ground gleamed with a dark sheen. The asphalt around me was damp, slick, and smelled of the same chemical rot from the beater we had pulled over.

Moving freely, I ran my fingers through my sweat-drenched hair, considering to myself the possibility that I had never gone home and instead was stuck on the street, tripping on some intensely psychoactive drug for hours by myself. That wasn’t the case, but with it being my most reasonable guess at the time, I went with that theory. After all, there was no evidence to suggest that wasn’t what happened. I was still in uniform. Hell, I still had my gun on me. Panicked, I stood up, shaking the dirt off my pants and shoes. I scanned the ends of the alley. "Where the fuck is Mike?" I coughed out, as if waiting for a response. I stumbled awkwardly on the slick ground to the end of the street. When I reached the main sidewalk, there was nothing to be seen. It was endlessly quiet, no sirens in the distance, no humming of loud engines, just nothing. Having worked in the department for as long as I have, I had always assumed I knew every inch of the city, but here in the deep quiet and empty streets I couldn’t seem to grasp my location. With remorse and embarrassment, I determined the best course of action would be to radio for backup.

"Officer Nichols, Badge Number 781, requesting immediate assistance at..."

I looked around for a street sign and was able to make out two street names hanging from traffic lights about half a block away.

"At Cold and Slither."

I hadn’t heard of these streets, odd considering how urban this area was. I waited eagerly for a response. Almost to my surprise, one came only a moment later.

"10-4, Nichols. Backup is headed your way. Do not run."

I froze, the last line of the response sending a screaming cold down my back. I knew all the dispatchers at my precinct. There was Kaitlynn, Brennan, Sasha, and Moe. That was it, just those four. It couldn’t be Brennan or Moe, as it was a woman's voice, but it also distinctly lacked the southerness of Kaitlynn's voice.

"Sasha, that you?"

"No."

As tears formed in the wells of my eyes, I glanced up from my radio to the intersection I had scanned not even a minute ago. Someone was there, standing blankly, purposely. I shifted my weight to my back leg, readying myself to flee, and then, as if spotting me, they began to sprint in my direction. As they tore down the street with Olympian speed, I allowed my training to take over. I instantly drew my service weapon and aimed the reticle to the center of this person's mass. I shouted useless commands as the thing approached. My brain screamed at me to pull the trigger, but I patiently waited for the creature to get closer, accepting at this point that this was in fact no human. At 15 feet I began firing, missing the first couple of shots. A wicked grimace swept across my face out of a cringing sensation. At 10 feet I recalibrated my aim, this time landing accurate shots to the chest of this thing. By 5 feet I realized the unstoppability of this beast. Despite this, I let two more bullets leave my chamber and watched as they tore through the half-man's face.

It was pointless. I had let it get too close. My arms felt like lead as I tried to push it away, but it slammed me to the ground hard enough to drive the air out of my lungs. Its weight crushed my chest, and then the claws came, raking across my face in wild, tearing arcs. A hot, wet gush spilled down my cheek and into my mouth, copper flooding my tongue. Through the blur of my blood-filled eyes, I could just make out its shape above me, hunched, twitching, and then I saw them. From the fresh, smoking holes my Beretta had punched into its torso, something began to emerge. Thick, black, rope-like appendages uncoiled themselves into the open air, writhing and tasting the space between us like blind snakes. They weren’t arms, and they weren’t alive in any way I understood. They searched. As the creature's fists rained down onto my unprotected face, I could feel my skull crack under the pressure. I only awoke when the thing hit my head with one final mushy blow.

Daylight was pouring through the blinds. My shirt was soaked with sweat. I told myself it had to be a dream, that I was still rattled from the stop, still wound up from the hospital visit. 

Then I looked at my hand. The puncture was surrounded by a deep, ugly bruise, and when I pressed it, I felt something move under the skin. Not a twitch. A slither.
