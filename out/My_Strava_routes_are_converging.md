After everything that happened last year, I decided to challenge myself to run. I've been running for three months, and I've finally been able to experience a genuine sense of freedom. When I run, I feel like I don't need to think about anything—or anyone—but myself. I feel like I'm capable of something, a feeling that seemed impossible a few months ago.

I started tracking my workouts on Strava in the last two weeks, because when I started running I didn't have a very clear goal. But now that I've gotten a taste for it, I'm obsessed with tracking how many miles I run and how much progress I'm making.

But over the last month, I've been waking up more tired than usual. Sometimes I wake up without remembering having gone to sleep, physically exhausted, and this has really interfered with my training. One day, looking at my history on Strava, I noticed that the app had recorded runs at 2:30 am and 3:00 am, on routes familiar to me… but very far from where I usually run, close to my ex-boyfriend's neighborhood.

Of course, my first reaction was to imagine that the app was buggy — until one day I woke up with my calf killing me and, when I looked at my feet, there were blisters and mud on my shins that certainly weren't there before I went to sleep.

I'm convinced that I get out of bed every morning to run. And the worst: I run towards him. The man who did me so wrong that I had to literally run away in the middle of the night—running for my own freedom for the first time.

Not knowing what to do, I decided to stay awake for at least one night. I locked the room to see if anything strange would happen. And yes, my app marked a new route… but I was awake following everything. The route started in the middle of nowhere, in a field far from everything, coming towards me at an inhuman speed. It didn't look like a bug. It seemed like a warning that I needed to get away from there. But suddenly I fell asleep.

The next day, nothing. No strange recordings on the app, no pain in my legs, finally no sleep — rested. But with the feeling that what came my way yesterday really got here. And it was watching me. I felt his eyes on me, judging me, satisfied. A familiar feeling: this was how he looked at me when he decided that I had done something “wrong”, something that needed to be “corrected” by him. The look that gave me black eyes many times, and days without eating.

How is this possible? Even after he's dead. Even after I stabbed him countless times. How can he still be stalking me? I made sure to hide his body in a place no one would ever find. So why am I running towards him?

I refuse to be manipulated by this monster again.

But that son of a bitch wouldn't let me go free — not even after death.

I just woke up in the middle of a strange street, barefoot, with my feet bleeding. And on Strava two routes appear. Two people running in the same direction. One against the other.

He's coming.
