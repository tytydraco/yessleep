I do asset recovery. Most weeks, my job is just logging serial numbers on used Herman Miller chairs and hauling server racks out of dead startups. It’s repetitive, physical work. But today the work order came through on a priority-coded sheet with no client name: Site 04. Clear the backlog.

Site 04 is an old office complex on the outskirts of the city, the kind of place that looks like it was built in the late 90s and forgotten by the mid-2000s. When I pulled into the back-lot, the first thing I saw was a white sedan. It was exactly where the file an old logistics log from some clerk said it would be.

The car was slumped on its rear passenger tire, the rubber bonded to the asphalt after melting into the tar over years of summer heat. I checked the VIN against my digital work order and found a match. The keys were still in the ignition, which is a red flag in my line of work, but when I reached in to grab them, the metal was unnaturally cold.

Not just morning air cold, but deep-freezer cold. When I exhaled, my breath fogged in the air above the steering wheel. I left them where they were.

The building itself was wide open no guard, no alarm, not even a locked bolt. The glass doors just vibrated when I pushed them open, a sound so deep it hurt my teeth. Inside, the air was thick and smelled like stale breakroom coffee and caramel, like a photocopier had been left running for a decade.

I walked past a row of cubicles until I found a desk with a nameplate that read Gary. The desk was covered in a layer of fine, grey dust that didn't move when I breathed on it; it sat there like a hardened skin over the keyboard and a half eaten granola bar.

Sitting right in the center of that dust was a phone.

I picked it up. The screen was shattered into a spiderweb of cracks, but it wasn't dead. It was burning hot. so hot I had to wrap it in my work glove to hold it. It was stuck in a boot-loop, and every time the logo tried to load, a faint camera-shutter sound clicked from the internal speakers: click, click, click.

It was perfectly synced with the throbbing in my head. Suddenly, the loop stopped. It didn't ask for a passcode; it just dumped me straight into the last open tab.

It was a Reddit thread. I’m looking at it right now as I type this. It’s a post from a "Surveyor" out in the Mojave desert.

The last entry was timestamped three minutes ago. He was talking about a "loud" lamp and a man named Marcus.

I looked up at the window. It’s high noon outside, bright and clear, but in the reflection of the phone’s dark screen, the office lights are on and the sun is already down. In that reflection, I can see the silhouette of a man with a towel over his head sitting in the corner of the office behind me.

When I turned around, the corner was empty nothing but the grey dust but then I looked down. A white towel was lying on the carpet. I reached out and touched it. It was still damp. Cold and damp.

I walked toward the breakroom, following the smell of the coffee. On the wall, right next to a rusted microwave, were several brass plates. They didn't list room numbers or employee names; they listed GPS coordinates for the Mojave. One was for the exact spot where the Surveyor’s thread ended.

I looked back down at the phone. A new line of text had appeared on the thread, typed in real-time: He’s standing in the breakroom now. He’s looking at the plates.

I dropped the phone.

It didn't hit the floor. It just kept falling, sinking through the grey dust on the carpet like it was water, until the sound of the shutter click was no longer coming from the device. It was coming from inside my own chest. Every time I blink, I hear it. Click.

I’m not leaving. I can’t. Every time I blink, the shutter clicks, and the office around me gets a little more blurry, a little more grey.

The 14 Republics don't delete files, they just compress them until they don't take up space anymore.

I can feel it. My lungs aren't expanding because there’s no room left for air. The whole office is becoming two dimensional, warped . just a layer of grey dust waiting to be filed away.

The clicking in my chest is so loud now it’s the only thing I can hear.

It’s not a heartbeat.

It’s the sound of the system saving over me
