I’ve gone back and forth for years about posting this. I know how it sounds, and I know what people are going to say. I’m not claiming to know exactly what it was—we didn’t either—but I’m posting this now because I still live in South Carolina, and every once in a while, something happens that reminds me of that night.

This happened when I was 17, right outside Rock Hill, not far from Winthrop. If you know the area, you know how fast the city drops off into woods, river land, and places people don’t really go unless they grew up there.

There were five of us.

Me, Tyler, Jess, Mark, and Evan.

It was late spring—warm enough to be sticky, but not full summer yet. That humid South Carolina air where everything smells like wet dirt and pine needles. Tyler had just gotten his license a few months earlier, and his parents were out of town. Classic setup. None of us were bad kids, but we were bored, restless, and convinced nothing bad ever really happens to people our age.

Someone—probably Mark—suggested we go smoke in the woods near the old access trail by the Catawba River. Not on the reservation itself, just land near it. Locals used it for fishing sometimes, and there were trails that went way deeper than most people realized.

We weren’t planning to camp. Just go in far enough that no one could smell it, hang out, laugh, and head back before midnight.

That was the plan.

Tyler parked his car on the side of a gravel pull‑off that didn’t have a sign anymore. We grabbed backpacks, flashlights, and a speaker we never ended up using. The woods swallowed sound fast anyway.

About ten minutes in, Jess joked that it felt like we were trespassing somewhere we shouldn’t be. Tyler laughed and said, “Relax. Worst thing out here is raccoons.”

I wish it had been raccoons.

The trail narrowed after about half a mile. It wasn’t maintained—just flattened earth from people walking it over years. The deeper we went, the quieter it got. No road noise. No bugs chirping like usual. That should’ve been the first red flag, but none of us really clocked it at the time.

We finally stopped in a little clearing. Trees all around, moonlight barely cutting through. Tyler rolled while Mark and Evan messed with the flashlight, shining it into the woods like idiots.

That’s when Jess froze.

She whispered, “Do y’all hear that?”

We all stopped talking.

At first, I thought it was just wind. Then I realized it wasn’t steady. It came in short bursts, like breathing—but too slow, too deliberate. From somewhere past the trees.

Mark shined the flashlight in that direction.

Nothing.

Then we heard footsteps.

Not heavy ones. Not running. Just… slow. Crunching leaves. One step. Pause. Another step.

Tyler called out, “Hello?” which, in hindsight, was the dumbest possible thing to do.

Something answered.

It sounded like a person trying to sound human.

“Hey,” it said.

I can still hear it. The voice wasn’t distorted or deep or monster‑like. That’s what made it worse. It was flat. Empty. Like someone repeating a word they’d heard without understanding it.

Jess grabbed my arm hard enough to hurt.

Evan whispered, “That’s not funny.”

“Hey,” it said again. Closer this time.

Mark laughed nervously and said, “Probably some dude messing with us.”

Then the flashlight beam caught movement.

Something tall stepped between two trees, just far enough that the light didn’t fully hit it. I remember thinking it was wearing a hoodie—until it moved its head.

It tilted. Wrong.

Like it was learning how necks worked.

The smell hit us next. Wet fur. Rot. That coppery smell you get when you cut your hand.

Tyler said, “We’re leaving.”

None of us argued.

We started walking back fast—not running yet. The footsteps followed. Always just far enough behind that we couldn’t see it clearly, but close enough that we could hear it stop when we stopped.

At one point, it laughed.

Not a real laugh. Just a broken sound, like someone had heard laughter once and tried to recreate it.

Then it said my name.

I had never told anyone outside that group my full name. Not online. Not loud. Not ever out there.

I stopped dead.

Jess screamed at me to keep moving, and that snapped me out of it. We ran.

Branches whipped at our faces. Someone fell—Mark, I think—and something crashed through the woods behind us like it suddenly didn’t care about being quiet anymore.

That’s when it started changing.

I know how that sounds. I don’t have a better word.

Its footsteps got heavier. Faster. Then lighter again. At one point, it sounded like it was running on two legs. Then four.

Evan tripped and I turned back without thinking. My flashlight caught it fully for maybe half a second.

It looked like a deer that had been stretched wrong. Too tall. Too thin. Its eyes reflected white—not yellow like animals usually do. And its mouth… its mouth was smiling, but not at the right angle.

It spoke again, in Jess’s voice.

“Wait.”

That broke something in all of us.

We didn’t stop running until we saw the gravel pull‑off. Tyler fumbled his keys so bad he dropped them twice. The woods went dead silent the second we crossed that invisible line between trees and open space.

The thing didn’t follow us out.

It stood just inside the tree line.

Watching.

We peeled out of there and didn’t talk until we were halfway back into town, streetlights everywhere.

None of us smoked that night.

We never went back.

Here’s the part that still messes with me.

The next morning, Tyler found muddy footprints around his car. Bare feet. Too long. Like someone had dragged their toes.

And for weeks after that, we’d get texts from unknown numbers that just said things like:

“Hey”

or

“Come back”

or

“Why did you run”

We changed numbers eventually.

I’ve heard people call things like that skinwalkers. I know that term gets thrown around and it’s tied to cultures I don’t want to disrespect. I’m not saying that’s what it was.

I’m saying something was out there.

And I think it learned us.

If people want more, I’m not the only one from that night with stories. Some of us still won’t talk about what happened after.

Just don’t go looking for it.

It already knows where you are.
