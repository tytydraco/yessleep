What does it mean to be human? I'm sure many of us have asked this question at one point or another throughout our lives. It may have great philosophical meaning, but at the end of the day one can look at themselves in the mirror and say that they are human. Now after what I've just witnessed I'm not so sure that I can anymore I'm not sure any of us can. Before I get into that though I suppose it's fair I begin with how I've come to this conclusion.  
  
My first question that I should ask is if anyone is familiar with the Silurian hypothesis. For those of you who aren't quite familiar with it, the basic idea is the ability for us to accurately find or detect evidence of an advanced civilization prior to our own. With Earth's volatile environment and ever changing nature even if a said civilization was to exist hundreds of millions of years ago it would be almost impossible to find any evidence. It's theorized that enough fossil fuel existed for an industrial civilization to exist roughly 350 million years ago. Regardless of the ability or possibility of such a civilization to appear it's been more of a thought experiment than a legitimate theory.  
  
Thought experiment for others, but a life's work for me. I can't say I had any form of evidence or experience that led me into seriously studying this theory. If anything it was my own whimsical belief and desire that humanity simply couldn't have sprouted out of nowhere potentially a few million years ago and a mere six thousand years ago human civilization first began. It was my fervent desire to prove that there was more than what we currently could comprehend.  
  
As you can imagine with a man in my field I was met with ridicule and criticism from every single one of my peers. Although I was never particularly bothered I knew from the beginning that my work was in direct contrast to the known accepted facts. Now before you ask, none of my research or papers were published even before this incident occurred so you wouldn't be able to find any evidence of my work. Everything began after coming back from a month long expedition from the arctic.  
  
Ring... Ring... Ring..  
  
"Hello, this is Alex Reiner." I started before grabbing my glasses from the nightstand. "Who is calling?"  
  
"Professor Reiner, are you currently alone right now?" A rough and commanding voice rings out on the other end.  
  
"I am and why is that important?" I ask now sitting up from my bed still confused by the situation.  
  
"Professor Reiner, your presence has been requested by General Felix by 0800 Tomorrow. Your travel details and instructions will be sent to you shortly after this message." The voice pauses for a brief moment before asking. "Do you have any questions?"  
  
"Questions? I have a million of them. I'm a civilian, I'm not too sure what your General would want with me. Furthermore, I have a lecture I need to give tomorrow and I don't have time to see your General." I say in a frustrated tone. "I'm quite busy for the week and I just got back from the arctic, I could make the time next week, but anything before that won't work. Also what is this about anyways?"  
  
I've had dealings with the military before as I've gone to some questionable and hostile territories while doing research. I'm not too familiar with their ranks but I have a general idea, but I've never heard of a General Felix before though. Not to mention that strange nature of the call.  
  
Before I can get an answer though the phone hangs up presumably from the other end. "Well the matter couldn't have been that important anyways considering they hung up on me." I say to myself while attempting to go back to sleep.  
  
Shortly after laying back down there was a knock at my door. Already frustrated from the earlier call I rush out of bed and swiftly make my way towards the door. I swing it open to yell at whoever is disturbing me only to be met with some sort of mist to my face and my consciousness slowly fading to black.  
  
Suddenly I jolt awake in the back of some type of secured vehicle. Initially I begin to panic, and try to scream but I've been bound and gagged. While I can't say I've ever had the pleasure of being kidnapped I've been in my fair share of dicey situations. After a few minutes of useless struggling I begin to think of any possible motive for the kidnapping.  
  
After thinking for a moment the only possible explanation is the call from earlier this morning. While my initial worry has died down a little bit I'm not quite sure what measures the military will be willing to employ, but I don't think I'm in any danger currently.  
  
The hum and vibration comes to a stop, and my vision is suddenly flooded with light as the back door is thrown open. Happy for progress to be made in my situation I'm immediately disappointed as right before I can figure out what's going on I'm yet again sprayed with the same mist.  
  
Waking up for the second time I find myself within an office. Currently bonded to the chair I look to my immediate left, and I see a man of immense stature dressed in standard military wear standing next to me. I'm assuming him to be my kidnapper and we're currently waiting for General Felix.  
  
The room itself was not particularly noteworthy, in fact it seemed exceedingly simple. The walls were left blank beside a singular poster which hung behind me. I couldn't make it out as I could only see the reflection from the window in front of me. The desk itself was neatly organized with a computer and other office items one would need I assumed for work purposes. If anything, the chair I was currently sitting in seemed to be the only form of modern design.  
  
Finally I hear the door open as a man walks into view. A man standing at 6'3 of average stature with a standard military cut. Although his hair has turned gray over the years it still seemed quite vibrant. The wear and tear I would assume after years of command doesn't seem present within his face. In anything it seems youthful perhaps is the best way to describe it, clearly you can see an experienced man but no wrinkles or blemishes are visible. It was hard to make out his age, but I assumed at least somewhere in his 50's.  
  
Regardless of his physical appearance though that is not what caught my attention. If anything, his presence is what worries me the most. The moment the man looked in my eyes, every hair stood on the back of my neck, an instinctual reaction to something higher on the food chain. His aura seemed to radiate off every fiber of his being and any command that he gave was meant to be followed. From this alone I knew for a fact that regardless of my position or rights that this was a man I couldn't say no to.  
  
"Now is that any way to treat a guest of ours!" General Felix's voiced boom throughout the room. "remove those restraints and gags off of him immediately!"  
  
The man beside me immediately accomplished his task. In fact for a brief moment I could have sworn I saw his body shiver ever so slightly before doing so. He then swiftly left the room with only General Felix and I left.  
  
"Now then I would like to apologize for the lack of hospitality that you've shown up to this point. I never intended for this to happen, but unfortunately the times call for rash actions, and Professor you are of utmost importance to us." He takes a seat while talking. His voice returned to a calm and apologetic attitude.  
  
Within the current situation even if I want to rattle off a thousand insults I know that now is not the time or place for that. "That's quite alright sir next time though I would at least prefer to know where I'm going. I don't like waking up in strange new areas" My voice stressed on the last part.  
  
"Of course Professor, and please refer to me as Felix, no need for sir. I would hate for our guest to feel uncomfortable and I apologize again for the inconvenience, but like I said this matter is of utmost importance. You might not know but the department that I oversee is quite interested in the work that you do." The General says while finally taking a seat across from me. "Who do you think was funding all of your research and expeditions?"  
  
I did find it quite odd that I received anonymous donations, but I simply choked it up to eccentric personalities who simply shared the same interest as me. Where the money came from was of a little concern as long as I could continue my work. Now though maybe it was time to ask my new patron for their reasons. "Well I never bothered to ask before, but I suppose I should be thanking you. May I ask why you have been funding me?"  
  
"We here believe that there is merit to your work. Even if you haven't provided any conclusive evidence we've always hoped that you would eventually show promising results." Felix rattles off.  
  
It felt as if he's reading off some poster boy checklist for anyone in my position to be acknowledged, "Even if I did discover an ancient civilization what exactly would be in it for you? I assume with how much money you've provided its for purely academic reasons."  
  
"Now professor I'm afraid I can't exactly disclose to you what our purpose is, but I can assure you that we had yours and the peoples best intentions at heart." Felix says while smiling towards me.  
  
My sudden unease from earlier returns with that look of his. His words and gestures feel fake. I mean given the size of this organization I did assume there's other motives at work, but I can't shake the feeling of something worse going on.  
  
"Regardless, now onto the crux of the matter for why we brought you here in such a rushed manner. We've finally found proof of your theories. Or should we say it found us." Felix states in an ominous way.  
  
"Found us? what does that mean, found us?" I ask confused, but excited at the prospect of my work being true. "What sort of evidence is it?" My mind racing at the possibility of perhaps a lost artifact or piece of technology that predates any other civilization. My earlier discomfort was replaced with curiosity.  
  
"What wouldn't be an accurate description, but who, Professor. We believe that the man currently within our possession is thought to have originated from one of these lost civilizations." Felix says while handing me a vanilla folder with records of the man.  
  
My mind is barely able to comprehend what is happening at this point. Up until a few hours ago all of my research was mere conjecture, without a shred of evidence to its name. Now an unknown man is telling me that not only did they find proof, but furthermore, they found a living specimen from this civilization. My excitement turns into caution as possible ulterior motives run around in my head, but I can't figure out why anyone would do this to me as I'm simply not that important.  
  
Unable to contain my curiosity though I take the folder from General Felix and flip through its contents. Not much detail is provided beside the fact that this creature apparently found itself to the base that I'm currently residing in and any other form of communication has been ineffective beside the fact that it has expressly asked for my presence.  
  
"Why would it ask for me?" An unknown species requesting my presence brings more questions than answers. "Also how do you know It's a creature from Earth?" I ask hesitantly. Even if Aliens may seem far fetched it seems entirely more possible than a creature from millions of years ago is still alive.  
  
"We can't be sure of his reasoning for your presence, but we can assume he knows of our work considering he voluntarily searched for us." Felix states, before briefly pausing. "As for being an Alien I'm sure once you meet him in person that question will answer itself." He laughs.  
  
Even more confused by his answer I decided to hold more questions as I'm sure they'll be answered soon enough. "When can I meet this thing then, you can't bring me here and expect me to wait now can you?" I ask, knowing that any form of delay will only further stress me out.  
  
"Well immediately professor as curious as you are we're even more so. While we have not been as forthcoming with our support beforehand we are completely at your disposal here." Felix stands and motions me towards the door. "Of course there's a few procedures we will have to go over before we get there, but nothing to worry about."  
  
Following next to him we made our way down a brightly lit corridor that was bustling with men and women running to and from the hallway. It seems with the arrival of the creature all hands are on deck.  
  
"First off I would like to explain that anything that has been or will be said here is under strict confidentiality and any leakage of these events will have you charged with treason." Felix sternly reminds me as we walk. "We will of course generously compensate you, and when or if we decide to go public you will be allowed to publicize these findings first. Other than a few questions we will like for you to ask this creature you are free to converse with it as you please."  
  
I was slightly upset at the confidentiality agreement, but I already knew with how they acted that this would be the case and there was no getting around it. Other than that I found his other terms and conditions quite reasonable all things considered. "What questions would you like me to ask?"  
  
"Only a few simple ones. In fact I'm sure you would have asked them yourself anyways. Firstly, what happened to his civilization, secondly how is he still alive, thirdly why did he decide to return now, and lastly what are his plans after returning?" Felix lowering his tone with the last question.  
  
The questions themselves seemed innocent enough and of course I would have asked them too like he stated, but something about his intent seemed different from mine. Before I could give it anymore thought though we arrived before a large steel door resembling that of a bank vault. Felix put his eye under a scanner to the right of us before the door opened on its own.  
  
"We come with good intentions, but until we can accurately grasp his intentions we use this to protect ourselves." Felix says while looking forward. "Also I should share that this creature does not communicate as you and I do. He's able to speak directly with his mind or form of telepathy more modernly known so don't be surprised if he attempts to communicate with you that way, but please attempt to communicate out loud for our records.. Other than that professor, once you go down this hallway you'll find yourself in front of a large glass wall with our guest on the other side."  
  
While I'm surprised at the fact he can communicate telepathically at this point I should expect anything to be possible. "You're not going to be joining me?" I ask.  
  
"Unfortunately no, as he has requested to speak to you alone. Don't worry though as we will be watching everything from the cameras and if anything happens we will immediately rush in. If nothing else I will leave it to you professor" Felix states amusingly while walking out. "We wouldn't be able to stop him in time anyways though." Felix mumbles under his breath.  
  
With the door creaking behind me I begin to internalize the reality of the situation. With the mix of adrenalin, fear, and excitement flowing through me I had not had time to process my situation. Here I am in an unidentified government building which I'm sure I could very well disappear in with a supposed creature from a lost civilization millions of years ago. One wrong move and I feel my existence will be wiped away for no one to remember.  
  
I'd love to say I bravely walked forward, but it took me all of 10 minutes to simply gather my courage and walk towards the end of the hallway. Every step I took felt like the weight of the world was upon my shoulders as sweat poured down the side of my head. As I got closer the defining silence and suspense nearly drove me insane. Finally seeing the wall in question I briefly rushed my steps standing right in front of the glass. I can't quite see inside as it seems the lights have been turned off. Before I can search for a switch though a voice echoes in my head.  
  
'Hello Alex, it's nice to finally make your acquaintance. I've been waiting quite some time to meet you.' The voice boomed inside of my head.  
  
Assaulted by the sudden voice I lost my balance plopping onto the ground. "Ahh could you please control your volume? I'm not quite used to this sensation." I politely ask. The sensation of being directly spoken to is quite unlike anything else. Even with your own thoughts it's impossible to think louder or have depth, but this was different.  
  
'I apologize for that, it's been some time since I've conversed with others, especially those who don't share my biology.' The creature's voice rings in my head again except at a more acceptable volume.  
  
"Thank you sir, while it may seem you already know my name, can I ask for yours?" I pick myself up from the ground and find a chair to my right and take a seat. "Also I wasn't able to find a light switch, are you able to turn on the lights from your side?"  
  
'Yes, and my name is Xeyar. I forgot our species doesn't see things the way you do give me a second.' The creature sighs before the room is flooded with light.  
  
"I-I... you're human!" I immediately blurt out.  
  
Letting my eyes adjust for a moment I'm met face to face with a man. I mean that in the literal sense. This lifeform can pass off as any normal human beside the green glow from its eyes it was almost identical to us. From my observation he was a man of thin stature roughly standing at 5'7 and long brown hair.  
  
'That was the exact reaction the people from earlier said, but not quite.' Xeyar laughs. 'Our species is more derived from the conscious and our physical form has little meaning for us. Not to say we can switch bodies as we like, but it's not how we identify ourselves though.'  
  
"Regardless of how you see your species you have to admit that there are stark similarities between ours and yours."  
  
'I can't deny that our physical bodies do share many similarities, a coincidence indeed.' Xeyar smiles to himself.  
  
Watching his expression and movement was a new experience. Without the need of vocal cords or his mouth it was a strange sight to see. The only thing I can compare it to is when you watch a video not in sync with the volume and someone's voice plays before their mouth actually moves.  
  
"Now that introductions have been officially made I would like to get straight to the point and ask why you specifically requested me?" My voice is burning with desire.  
  
'Well it's quite obvious isn't it? You're the leading human in this field of study and considering I'm a citizen from your so-called lost civilizations then it seems to me that no one else is qualified.' Xeyar stated as a matter of fact.  
  
What he said makes perfect sense, but it also feels too simple. He didn't exactly state why he chose me even with my background. Anyone at this facility also would have worked, if I press the matter I don't think I'll receive a better answer though.  
  
"You speak as if your civilization isn't lost, does that mean your people still exist and if so where did you and your people go?" I press on with my questions.  
  
'Well I'm certainly not the last of my kind, but in a way we're dwindling though. As for where we currently reside, that's more of a complicated answer and forgive me if I don't feel like with my current situation that's an appropriate answer to give.' Xeyar motions to his cell while answering.  
  
I can't argue with him considering the first response to one of the greatest historical discoveries in history was to lock him up. As I'm about to continue with my questions were suddenly interrupted by a loudspeaker. "Professor would you mind reminding our guest that his answers should be transmitted orally and not telepathically?" the static cuts off after the curt reminder.  
"You'll have to excuse me, its been some time since I've last used my voice and I'm not used to the sensation yet." Xeyar lets out in a hoarse voice.  
  
"It's quite alright, there's no need for you to repeat your answers as I'll record them in my report."  
  
I knew we were being watched, but the situation seems different from what I imagined. The precautionary measures and refusal to address Xeyar himself makes me question what's really going on here. Only thing to do though is to keep asking questions.  
  
"Well this next question personally piques my interest, how are you still alive? Although I haven't received exact dates for your civilization I'm assuming it to be millions of years old or were you recently born or whatever method your species uses to procreate?"  
  
"Well I'm certainly not a newborn, and yes I am quite old. Far older than anything humans have built up to date. As I've mentioned earlier our self being is far from physical, what you see isn't who I am, and the body is merely a conduit that we use to perform physical action. While we're able to live far longer than any other species it's also a curse to live for so long. That's why many of us choose to either hibernate or cut our selves off as a form of suicide. In fact I'm the last of my generation with the burden of being the keeper." His tone became melancholic and sad.  
  
I couldn't possibly imagine what it meant to live millions of years, the burden of an entire species resting upon you. A wave of sorrow washed over me as he told his story. Gathering myself I ask my next question. "What exactly is a keeper? Is it some form of record holding?"  
  
"Exactly, Except there are no physical records to speak of. Everything that there is to know about our history and culture is stored right here. There's not many of us, but I am the oldest though." Xeyar states while staring at the camera. Turning his attention back to me he continues, "That's part of the reason why I came here as a representative not to mention my own personal interest."  
  
I was curious about his other reasons, but I'm sure that even if I asked I would either be met with superficial answers or silence. "Why the sudden return now? I mean it's been millions of years by this point and there were plenty of opportunities to make contact with us before. What exactly are your intentions after remaining hidden for so long." I ask inquisitively.  
  
"We've had contact with your species before, but nothing of substantial interest, mostly accidental encounters or the helping hand here and there. As for why we've decided to meet you now is that your species is at an appropriate level of civilization for communication. "We're dying Alex and it's only a matter of time before you're next.' " " The last part was directly communicated to me while Xeyar was speaking.  
  
I didn't have a moment to process what was going on before his voice rang in my head again. 'It's hard to communicate two different streams of information at the same time so I'll be brief before they notice, refrain from speaking and show no emotions.' Xeyar was simultaneously speaking to me telepathically and orally, but my brain could only focus on one as his words became background noise. Neither of us are safe Alex, as you might have noticed I'm not exactly treated as a guest here. In fact they want to kill me for that matter, but the only thing stopping them is finding out my motives and where the rest of us are. Although sadly I have to say I'm the last of my kind. My people died long ago, and I've been waiting for a chance.\`\`  
  
My thoughts immediately became a jumbled mess. I wasn't sure who to believe at this point. I knew that his situation was less than ideal, but to say they wanted to kill him seemed over the top. What would they possibly gain from doing so?  
  
'As you mentioned earlier there are stark similarities between our species and there's a reason for that. We don't have the time to go over them, but we're closer than you think. The only advice I can give to you right now is play ignorant, and I'll find a way to communicate with you again. This conversation never happens if you want to live.' Xeyar's voice cuts out as I think about what to do next.  
  
"Professor that should be enough for today, you can continue your conversation with our Guest tomorrow. I'm sure you're tired from all the commotion earlier." The loudspeaker rings out again.  
  
I was tempted to deny the request, but it was best to air on the side of caution in this situation.  
  
"If you will excuse me then Xeyar I think it's time we stopped for today. I am quite tired after all." I stand up out of my seat as Xeyar simply stares at me before I turn around heading back to the door.  
  
Making my way towards the exit I think about my current predicament. Completely trusting either side at this point could lead to detrimental consequences. On one hand General Felix has been hiding his intentions, and purpose behind his involvement in this project. While he might kill this foreign species out of protection for humanity or self interest is possible it also seems unlikely within the short run as there's more benefits to be had keeping him alive. I at least know I'm safe from that fact for the next few days at least.  
  
If I choose to believe Xeyar then I could potentially be putting myself not only against whatever powerful individuals back General Felix, but humanity as a whole. There's no evidence to back his claim that he's the last of his species and even if he is, if we were the direct or indirect cause of that extinction this could be a form of revenge or plan to instigate our downfall. I highly doubt a man of his years was so willing to surrender himself without a plan in mind. Not to mention his comment on the similarities of our species, what exactly did he mean by that.  
  
This is almost too much for my brain to handle, my best bet is to remain neutral in this situation and probe the reaction from the other side. I'm hanging by a thread and the wrong mistake could not only end my life but potentially the lives of many more.  
  
My heartbeat quickens as I reach the door while my vision becomes slightly blurry as I try to control my breathing before meeting with the General. I have to remain as calm as possible. Before long the door is unlocked and I'm greeted by General Felix.  
  
"Professor, that was an excellent interview I have to say. Those were the most words our guest has spoken to anyone since being here." Felix states while leading me down the hallway. "We're not quite sure of the effects of telepathic communication on human's so to play it on the safe side we decide to cut it short for your safety."  
  
I assumed he meant my first contact with Xeyar, but I couldn't wonder if he knew of our last conversation, and if I should come clean. Gripping my hands tighter I say, "It was certainly a novel experience, and hard to describe. Thank you for your concern, but I would love to continue this conversation with Xeyar as soon as possible."  
  
"So would we Professor, all we have to do is run a few diagnostics and make sure you get a good night's rest. It's not as if he will be going anywhere. We have all the time in the world, and don't worry your absence has already been accounted for so take your time and enjoy yourself while you're here. I'll leave you to the doctor as I have other work that requires my attention." Felix motions to the med bay while he returns to the direction of his office.  
  
It was hard to judge anything From the General's reaction, and if anything I feel more loss than I did before. Nothing else to do, but do what he says for now. Walking into the med bay I finish up my diagnosis before returning to my assigned room. All of the stress and excitement of the day finally hits me as the moment I lay down I fall into a deep slumber.  
  
Over the next couple of days it was the same routine from earlier. I would be fed my meals exclusively inside of my room until the designated period for when I would hold my interview with Xeyar, immediately after I would be taken for a diagnostic check and then be returned to my room. It was a monotonous schedule and besides the first day Xeyar had yet to say anything new on the subject we discussed. Our conversations devolved to more common subjects and if anything had less to do with his people and more to do with me. Outside of Xeyar the only people I had contact with at this time was General Felix and the Doctor whose only words to me were asking about my condition.  
  
It wasn't until the evening of the sixth day that I was called into General Felix's office. Upon my arrival I take notice of the poster that I couldn't make out before is now in clear view. All it was a string of words that read "The illusion of choice is orchestrated by the knowledgeable and followed by the ignorant."  
A concerting passage of a man of his position. I don't feel it's by chance I'm reading this either. Exactly what category would I fall under. With the hoops I've been jumping through, my condition has taken a toll for the worse which I'm sure he's fully aware of by this point.  
  
"Please take a seat Professor, I think it's about time we discuss your involvement in this matter and where we will be going." Felix states with his ever present smile.  
  
I try not to react to his statement, but I'm already on guard for anything he might say as one wrong word could spell the end for me.  
  
"Over the course of these past days I'd say we've made significant progress with our guests. In fact we've learned a lot more than we could have hoped for at this point. I dare say you've been an integral part of this operation." Felix pulls out a folder then continues speaking. "Unfortunately I think we've about gotten as much out of him as we can. At least willingly anyways. Here we have the transcript of your previous conversations and I would like for you to read it for me. Tell me if you notice anything particular in there."  
  
Cautiously grabbing the folder from his hand I scan through the contents. Everything inside is an exact recording of every word that was said during our conversations. In fact it has footnotes of either of our reactions or perceived mental and emotional state during our conversation. In fact the file contained my medical records for the past few days and while I wasn't worried of any adverse effects it was relieving to know my condition was relatively stable beside a little weight loss and fatigue. Once I got to the last few pages my blood instantly froze. My hands were shaking as I turned the final page that read only two words Telepathic Communications.  
  
I Couldn't look up or keep reading. I knew that this entire time the General was well aware of my conversation with Xeyar and my refusal to share those details. Seemingly aware of my situation the General chimes in, "I see you've finally reached that part. Quite interesting isn't it, the ability to telepathically communicate with one another. In fact my division has been charged with researching such abilities before, and have had quite the success with it."  
  
"I... I'm sorry for not shar..." I meekly mumble before being cut off.  
  
"It's quite alright professor, I can imagine with the predicament you found yourself in that it was quite tortuous to figure out who to trust, and who to believe. If anything I have to say you did quite well for yourself given the circumstances. Remaining neutral until you can figure out the objectives of both parties. Of course it would have been smart if we didn't know right from the beginning." Felix states with his grin and joyous attitude slowly returning to that of a commanding officer.  
  
"As much joy as we've had having you here Professor I think our time here together is over. I'll have one of my men bring you back to your quarters and what we'll do from here is no longer part of your concern. Furthermore, any deal we may have had earlier is now voided." Felix stoutly commands as a man guides me back to my room.  
  
Barely conscious at this point I mutely follow the man as everything comes crashing down around me. Even if the General didn't state what he would do to me I highly doubt it'll be anything pleasant even if I'm able to keep my life. Not to mention my entire life's work has been completely cut off from me. My only hope and shred of evidence I had to my name was ripped from my hands due to my own actions.  
  
Reaching my room I lay down on my bed and stare up at the ceiling. I hate to admit it, but I gave up. There was nothing for me to do as the despair and hopelessness of the situation crept into my mind. It was nigh impossible for me to make any kind of escape, even if I do leave here safely my work will be shamed and I'm sure they will see to it. My previous funding will be cut and I'll be left with nothing to my name. Unable to control my downward spiral I let exhaustion take over as my consciousness fades away to sleep.  
  
'Alexxx... Alexx. Alex!' A voice snaps inside my head.  
  
"Hello?" I called out.  
  
'Alex it's me Xeyar. I roughly understand the situation that you're in and I'm not in a much better situation as once they're done with you they're sure to deal with me.' His voice rings out again.  
  
"How do you even know and furthermore, not like it matters as they can hear as anyways."  
  
"They can't hear us right now, you're still dreaming Alex and I'm speaking directly into your subconscious. It's harder for them to pick up these signals. Did you think speaking telepathically was my only ability? Reading minds and other such abilities are all quite feasible." Xeyar chuckles at my question.  
  
It was obvious, but I didn't give it as much thought before. Deciding to hear him out I respond, "What do you have in mind then? I don't see how either of us can get out of this situation."  
  
'I was already able to interfere with the electronic mechanisms that keep me locked up. The only other problem we have is the guards and staff. I should be able to incapacitate everyone on base. The only problem is I'm unable to move myself as it takes all of my focus to perform. That's when I'll need you to come and retrieve me and leave before I lose focus.' Xeyar transmits.  
  
The idea seems ridiculous and incredibly dangerous. Putting myself at risk for a man, and separate species that I only met six days ago. I don't think I have any other option though. If I do nothing my life is already in ruin and this may be my only chance.  
  
"Alright I'll do it." I responded back.  
  
'I thought that you might get ready once I start. I won't be able to communicate with you anymore. Starting now!' Xeyar yells as I'm thrust awake.  
  
Collecting my bearings I cautiously open my door, and immediately notice the guards stationed at my door have collapsed onto the floor. Seeing that the plan seemed successful I hurriedly made my way to Xeyar's room. My footsteps echoing the hallways I keep praying that this will keep working.  
  
Seeing that the large door is wide open I make my way down until reaching Xeyar's cell where I see him collapsed on the floor. I Immediately rushed inside where I fixed him on my back. Thankfully he's quite small in stature and makes it easier to carry him.  
  
Although I wasn't sure of the exit I assumed running down one way long enough would lead me out of this building. After the longest five minutes of my life I finally reach the exit where my blood boils as I rush outside to be immediately met with large foliage and trees.  
  
Finding myself inside the middle of the jungle was certainly confusing, but this might play towards my advantage as it'll make it harder to find us. Without the slightest idea where we are though nor do I have any experience with traversing a Jungle I'll have to figure that out later.  
  
After about an hour of travel my legs are already killing me. Even if Xeyar was light, the added burden of weight along with my complete lack of experience and gear has made traveling quite exhausting. Unsure when he will wake again I take a quick break to gather myself, and attempt to wake him to figure out our next option.  
  
10 minutes later Xeyar starts regaining consciousness as I wiggle him awake. "Xeyar, Xeyar, we're outside. I have no idea where we are exactly, but we've made it your plan worked!" I yell in between breaths.  
  
Sitting up Xeyar briefly observes his surroundings and speaks to me, 'It appears it did, I have to say that without your help I could have never made it out of there Alex. Without you my race wouldn't have another chance, we can start again.' Xeyar hovers himself above me. 'Thank you Alex and I'm sorry for what I must do.'  
  
"What do you mea..." Before I can respond I fall to the ground.  
  
Waking up I yet again find myself strapped down to what appears to be a crude stone table. Looking around I'm in what appears to be a cave with a fire roaring right in front of me. Recently I've become quite tired of being forcefully relocated.  
  
While I attempt to free myself a voice rings out in my head, 'I wouldn't do that if I was you Alex, even if you did manage to escape you couldn't run away from me anyways.'  
  
Already knowing who was speaking to me I called out, "Well I can't say I'm entirely surprised Xeyar. My options were quite limited at the time, but it still kind of stings to be betrayed like this. May I ask what your plans are?"  
  
'All in due time my friend, but before we get to that I suppose I should explain how my people and I landed ourselves in this little predicament of ours.' Xeyar walks into view but his hair is now withered and white, and his skin clingy to his bones. He looked more like a ghoul than a man now.  
  
Yelping at his appearance, my imagination runs wild that perhaps he needs to feed on other humans to keep up his appearance.  
  
'Nothing like that Alex, in fact as I mentioned earlier we were much closer than you realize.' Xeyar chuckles before resuming his conversation. 'Our species is a long lived one, in fact some would have labeled us immortals for the matter. If you take a look at your peoples mythology and stories you'd be able to find traces of us across your history. In fact some use to address me as Odin once upon a time.'  
  
Shocked at this revelation I assumed when he mentioned brief encounters before that they were simple passing's not the creation of an entire religion.  
  
'Although to me it was almost yesterday while to your people it was hundreds if not thousands of years ago. At that time my people's numbers were larger than before but not much. Slowly but surely our numbers dwindled until only I was left.' Xeyar's expressions are worsening. 'The reason for that is we lived too long. My people simply couldn't handle it anymore and in droves they killed themselves one after the other. The pressure of a long life or trauma was too much even for us to bear.'  
  
It was terrible to listen to what happened to his people. A long sought dream by any human to extend their life or find the key to immortality is as old as time. To his people though it was a fate worse than death.  
  
'For a long time we simply lived as wanders until we decided to invest our time in the wonders of human society. It relieved our boredom and provided a distraction from our own existence. In fact due to our striking similarities and behavior it was quite intriguing, not to mention your limited life spans. It wasn't until roughly 200 years ago we learned the truth.' Xeyar ads.  
  
"The truth? What truth do you mean?" I cut in.  
  
'The reason why we're so similar. That's because humans came from us. You're a direct creation from our people.' Xeyar stops to give me time to process.  
  
"How is that possible, although we share physical features we're simply different organisms though!" I yell back.  
  
'I thought you might have that reaction, but I never explained exactly how one of my kind commits suicide though. You see we induce ourselves into a type of coma completely cutting off our consciousness from the world, entering a form of sleep. When one does this their body's are usually buried or left to their own devices. Eventually the elements will degrade the body until nothing is left of their existence.'  
  
"What does that have to do with us then?" I interrupt.  
  
'Let me finish, and you'll know!' Xeyar snaps back. 'As it turns out though that through this process the first human was born. While the details are unknown we can assume one of our people cut their consciousness off and somehow their body survived long enough for it to develop its own consciousness and become its own being. Furthermore, this occurred enough until there were enough of these puppets for your species to reproduce and as I'm sure you could figure out the rest.' Xeyar states sarcastically.  
  
'In fact a hypothesis of my own is that's where your development of the so-called symptom Uncanny Valley originates from. It was the body's instinctual reaction to avoid us as it knew what we were and what it was. Although that is neither here nor there as this wasn't the only thing we were able to figure out.'  
  
With his use of the word puppets I began to have an uneasy feeling of where this was heading. Anything I can do or think is already known to him and all I can do is lay here.  
  
'As it turns out we didn't truly die, or should I say not in the true sense of the word. 200 Years ago one of my fellow members became infatuated with a human. While this wasn't entirely uncommon what they did was different though. He attempted to unlock her ability or should I say make her one of us as he couldn't bear to part with her. While he succeeded much to our surprise it was an entirely different result than any of us could have imagined.'  
  
'In actually what he did was awaken an old conscience from a fellow member that previously cut themselves off. With more conjecture and theory we were able to summarize that after our bodies completely deteriorated our subconscious would seek a new host for refugees. While this has no bearings or consequence on the original host, sometimes it does grant them heightened senses or abilities.'  
  
The revelation changed my perspective of the evolution of our two species. Unfortunately it didn't take a genius to figure out what happened to the original human.  
  
'Exactly as you thought Alex, that previous human did in fact die. Even after they were revived they immediately cut themselves off again, but not before stating never to wake them up again. It was an unfortunate, but important point in my people's history.'  
  
'This is where our people split though, some of us such as myself believed that it was our duty to revive those who've fallen. That for those we regret their decision it was a second chance at life and for those who didn't want it could simply return to their sleep. While the other group believed it was inhumane to potentially kill off so many humans for our own selfish desires.' Xeyar sighed while talking.  
  
'As any civilization does, we started a war between each other, those who were unwilling to compromise were forcefully put to sleep until eventually it was just me.' Xeyar dejectedly states. 'Now it's my duty to my people to bring them back. Bring back those who deserve a second chance and take our place back!'  
  
"Why didn't your people reproduce? I'm sure that was a much better decision than what you're currently attempting." I interjected.  
  
'Of course we thought of that stupid human!' Xeyar yells back. 'The problem being we can't reproduce. In fact our own creation is a mystery to us. We simply were at one point and that's all anyone can remember.'  
  
"Doesn't that mean you might be a creation of some other species because of your sterilization?" I ask  
  
"Quiet you mere byproduct!" Xeyar snaps. 'Humans are nothing but an unintentional mistake that we let fester. You're nothing but our play things to relieve our boredom and that's all you'll be good for.' Xeyar forcefully applies pressure to my body as he rants. My bones creaked against the stone table.  
  
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you." I manage to get out between gasps. My situation worsened by the second with no escape in sight. "Why did you come here then, it makes no sense to surrender yourself?" I ask hoping to buy time.  
  
'It's simple really, as you heard from the General you humans have already begun researching telepathic abilities and it was only a matter of time before you discovered my existence and potentially my people. I had to make sure that all traces of your experiments were erased before it was too late.' Xeyar responds curtly  
  
'It doesn't matter though as you and a billion others of your kind will eventually become our vessels.' Xeyar calms down and reaches his hand over my head. 'I will admit this will be a painful process, but rejoice as you'll be welcoming something greater into this world.'  
  
Without a moment's notice a wave of pressure floods my head as I'm subjected to the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life. My consciousness is ripped apart piece by piece as Xeyar seemingly burrows through my mind to search for something. I attempt to fight it off, but it's futile as he keeps digging.  
  
'Give in Alex, resisting only prolongs the pain. Let go and accept what is about to happen." Xeyar's voice rings out through the pain.  
  
Knowing that he's right I begin to let go, the pain fading away as my consciousness becomes blurry. The mountain of regrets of my life plays through my mind. My own stubbornness towards a lost career, blindly following my work, potentially being the reason for over a billion deaths. Tears well up in my eyes as my vision becomes white.  
  
"Xeyar, You're still clinging to this after all this time." A familiar voice says in the background.  
  
I can't figure out whose it was before I lost all feeling and lost consciousness. After an unknown amount of time I wake up to find myself in what appears to be a hospital room. A guard stationed near my side notifies someone on his radio, and walks out of the room before I can ask any questions.  
  
Shortly after General Felix walks in, and takes a seat by my bedside. "I'm sorry you had to experience that Professor, I would like to say that Xeyar isn't an accurate representation of our people."  
  
"Your people?" I ask.  
  
General Felix then removes what appears to be contact lenses from his eyes and I'm yet again met with those glowing green eyes. I instinctively jump back and bump into the wall behind me.  
  
"Calm down Professor, I didn't mean to scare you like that, please let me explain." Felix laughs while attempting to calm me down.  
  
Regaining my composure I hesitantly nod and allow him to continue. "Contrary to what Xeyar believed, there's actually more of us left. In fact thirty percent of the staff working here are. Although I can't say for certain though we are most likely the last of us though." Felix sighs.  
  
"We alluded Xeyar's group into believing they finished off the rest of us while simultaneously trying to track their movements. In fact the only reason why we involved you was because we weren't entirely sure he was alone. We needed him to believe he was the last of our kind and you were his last hope of getting out."  
  
While I can't say I was particularly happy about being used as bait I can understand why they did what they did. "What does that mean for me then, what do you plan to do with me?" I ask.  
  
"Well nothing, we plan to return you to your home as it is completely intact and enough money to last a lifetime." Felix joyously states. "You've been through enough as it is and any evidence of our people existing has completely been erased. We already know that any sort of research that you do is pointless anyways."  
  
"Well I won't argue with those facts, Will I be allowed to publish what happened here and what exactly are your plans for humanity?"  
  
"We would prefer you not to publish anything, but no one would believe you anyways. In fact you'd probably be laughed out for even proposing such an insane idea." He states as a matter of fact while standing up. "As for our plans for humanity we don't have any. We simply want to observe and participate where we can. Our people's mistakes shouldn't be paid for by your people. That's all I have to say on the matter though. You'll shortly return home here soon enough." Felix says before leaving the room.  
  
I attempt to ask further questions, but I yet again find myself losing consciousness before waking back up in my own bed. Sitting up I find a note left on my nightstand. 'Sorry we part on the terms we met, but this is for our own safety too. I wish you the best of luck Alex because we might meet again. General Felix.'  
  
"Alex, He never called me Alex befor..." I stop myself mid sentence. "There was only one person who addressed me as Alex, Xeyar." Mortified at the potential revelation, but angry at my inability to do anything I slump myself on the couch accepting what might come.  
  
With the General's resources who knows what he could do or the people he can reach. Taking a bottle of vodka from my cabinet I pour myself a glass. All I can do is warn as many people as I can. If you're reading this all I can say is bunker down and pray, pray that I'm wrong, and pray that you're not one of them.
