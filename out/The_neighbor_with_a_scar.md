Life can be good. We finally managed to save enough to swap our rented downtown for a house in the suburbs. A nice house, a nice yard, the occasional struggle with something breaking down – the typical pleasures of owning your own house. When we were renting the room, an old woman lived below us who would ring the kennel bell at the smallest, cultural event, so we tried to get to know our neighbors relatively quickly, trying to pick out potential lunatics.

 

They seemed okay overall, except for one weirdo. He would peek at us from his yard like a shitting squirrel, then hide in the house. And that face of his, from eye to mouth, was “decorated” with an ugly scar .

 

After unpacking we slowly tried to catch the rhythm, the famous work -life balance . It was necessary to find time for entertainment unknown in the rented apartment, already in the first week I had to deal with a warped hinge of the room door, I won this battle, but as to the question of why the next day there was no hot water in the whole house I had not only no answer, but also no idea where to look. At that moment Aneta said – I know, look! She grabbed a board for chopping vegetables, went down to the basement and knocked harder on some device on the pipe. It was the pump – she said – sometimes it jams. Another time she knew that the unyielding attic door was opened by pulling it towards you and to the left, while turning the key. She was a talented girl ,

 

We were feeling more and more at home, life was going on sweetly and sleepily (apart from the slob staring from behind the fence), until about a week after moving in, I saw a leaflet sticking out of the mailbox. It took me a moment to locate the key, I had never opened it before. It turned out that the leaflet didn't fit, because there were letters in the mailbox, the envelopes looked old, exposed to the elements for a long time. It took me a moment to consider whether to open the correspondence, which of course belonged to the previous owners, but I decided - what the heck. A few bills, holiday greetings and suddenly I couldn't breathe, a card from the seaside based on the photo of the couple on it, the slob from behind the fence - younger and without a scar , and Aneta, my Aneta.

 

I didn't know what was going on, what kind of circus was this with these two... why didn't she tell me that she knew him... ha, it was more than friendship. I was all worked up, but I had to wait until she got back from work to confront her. Suddenly I looked, and the neighbor who had been avoiding me until then beckoned me over with a wave of his hand. And so we started smalltalk, that it was nice to know that the weather was good, but the soccer representation was consistently bad. I asked about the previous owners of my house. Suddenly he dropped his neutral tone, his eyes glazed over, and his voice began to tremble. They died - he said - the doctors said it was heart attacks, circulation, etc. But really from despair after losing a child. After a significant pause, now he had a question - your girlfriend, her name is Aneta, right? Right - I replied - after which, giving up the game, I showed him an old postcard. Yes – he confirmed – I forgot about that, we sent it from the Baltic Sea to her parents, on the way back there was a car accident, I have this scar from it, she didn't survive...
