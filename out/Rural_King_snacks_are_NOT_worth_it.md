I'm half sure I almost got fucking murdered or something because I wanted a pack of goddamn jalapeno and cheddar meat sticks. How the fuck has my life ended up here, holy shit.

I was driving through West Virginia, had to go to out to Wiliamson but was heading back to where I lived. I have no actual idea where exactly I was because I'm not from WV and was passing through. I was already creeped out by the fact that I was driving through an area that looked like if I stopped anywhere it was gonna turn into some horror movie shit and some axe welding murder was gonna try and kill me. Then in a break in the trees I saw it, a fucking Rural King.

Now I happen to like their meat sticks, think slim Jim's but way better, and made the horrible decision to try and pick up a pack. Now if you don't know anything about Rural King, I'm not sure if it's just an America Southern thing or what, it's basically the Walmart of anything you would need for like minor livestock farming and other related things. Oh and you can get some pretty good snacks and guns and something called a legion sword, which is just a really big knife machete crossbreed.

I didn't think about how weird it was that it was out here, I didn't think about how empty the parking lot was, and I for sure didn't think about the fact it was pretty weird that a Rural King was in the middle of nowhere West Virginia and happened to also look like it was freshly built, or popped out of the ground like a dollar store.

I parked my car and started for the doors. The second I walked in something told me it was a bad idea to stay. But like a dumbass I didn't listen. I wandered through the store and went to where I knew they kept the meat sticks and other snacks. I found the pack I wanted and started to head towards a check out. 

Then I felt my entire body freeze up and my blood run cold. I held my breath and didn't dare make a sound. I felt something behind me. I didn't dare turn around to look, I didn't dare move a muscle. I was hoping it would be like the T-Rex from Jurassic Park and if I stayed perfectly still it wouldn't see me. Then I felt something on my shoulder. I moved to look, god I wish I hadn't. It wasn't a hand but what looked like a pawish thing, long claws that could definitely rip me to shreds, and looked almost like some bear paw mixed with a dog.

"You want to stay with me?" I heard it say.

That was when I dropped the damn meat sticks and just started running. I didn't care what else could happen, I just started moving. I ran for the doors, I could hear the thing on my heels. It sounded almost like a dog moving on concrete as it followed, but I knew it wasn't a damn dog. I got out of the building and ran for my car, I smashed the unlock button on my key fob and ran for the damn truck. 

Never in my life was I so glad to get into that shitty ass truck. I slammed to lock the damn doors and smashed my foot down onto the gas. I just drove as fast as I could on the curvy, narrow road. I finally looked into my rearview mirror and I didn't see anything following me.

I have no idea what the hell just happened, frankly I don't wanna know. I'm just happy to be in my fucking house and able to hang out with my cat.
