I don't know where else to turn, and I can't keep this to myself any longer. My family, my wife Lisa who’s 32, and our two children, Alex 5 and Emily 11, have disappeared without a trace of how or why. Something that been bothering me about all this is the chilling similarities between our story and the Jamison family deaths.

It all started innocently enough - a weekend for the family. We planned to go to this remote cabin in the woods that we and other family members all used from time to time. We loved the serenity it offered, the chance to disconnect and a time for me and my wife to reconnect again. It was a small cabin taken care of because it was owned by the whole family. It sat by a small pond big enough to swim in. There was a outside porch area with a built in fire place and lawn chairs. That’s really as best as I could describe it nothing special nothing well eerie. But this time, as we packed up to leave, something felt off. Lisa and I both experienced some uneasy feelings, but we brushed it aside as paranoia. Especially since we where both true crime fans so we can be a bit paranoid. 

Now that I look back on it the following days were surreal. It felt like we were being watched, like there was something just beyond our sight. We didn’t see anything or hear anything that wasn’t normal, our kids watched YouTube on their tablets, my wife controlled the music switching from swift to country even to some annoying children songs. But every now and then when we stopped for a bathroom break or food something just seemed different. Once we made it we noticed it was slightly quite like the birds and animals have all left that didn’t last long as a few hours it seemed the regular forest noises resumed.

But over the next few days tension grew. Our kids woke up from some nightmares. They slowly started eating less. Our children became more withdrawn, their laughter and arguing replaced by quite whispers and withdrawn stares. Lisa and me where both concerned even considered going back but decided to give it another two nights if nothing changed we would go home. Well that very night my wife got up to use the bathroom when she came back she was oddly quite I assumed she thought I was asleep and was trying to be careful. The next day though she seemed similar to the kids she stayed in bed saying she was really tired and just wanted to rest. She wouldn’t get up to eat and when she looked at me she seemed aged and tired like she wasn’t present in her own body. The kids stayed the same as the previous days. Silent whispering and withdrawn. 

And then, on the last night, it happened. I woke up to a silence the same dead silence of the first day. If you’ve ever woken up as a teen to find the house quite and empty with your parents leaving a note saying “we will be back went to the store” that’s the type of quite. Except this time there was no note. This feeling of dread that was now forming intensified as I called out to Lisa and the kids, only to receive empty cold silence in return. Panic set in, and I began to search the cabin frantically, my heart pounding expecting to see them in one of the rooms making a midnight snack or maybe secretly setting up a prank on me. But there was no Lisa no kids no whispers nothing. Their belongings were still there, but they were gone.

I contacted the authorities, and a search was launched. 5 Days turned into 3 weeks, and still, there was no sign of them. The investigation yielded nothing concrete, just like the case of the Jamison family who I only know about because it was a case that fascinated me and my wife. It was as if they had vanished into thin air, leaving behind only questions and heartbreak. There shoes and all their belongings still there the only thing missing was the pjs they where wearing. My wife Lisa was wearing a tank top and undies. no phones gone no money no tablets only them. Their beds where normal as if they where slept in but not rushed out of. The widows and doors that morning where locked.  Even the car was still there the keys on the key rack.

I can't shake the feeling that something is still off, something just isn’t right. The parallels between our story and the Jamison family deaths are eerie, I write this post as a desperate plea - if anyone out there has experienced anything similar or has any insight, please, I beg you, share it with me.

My days are consumed by frantic internet searches. And nights are sleepless with unanswered questions. I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. If my family is still out there somewhere, I'm determined to find them but I feel like if I ever do I will be another part of the case. That or what I find..will be utterly terrifying.
