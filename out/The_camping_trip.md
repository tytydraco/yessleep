The rain pattered hard on the window. It was late on a Tuesday night in 2007. My parents had just left for a long work trip. I was 17 at the time. Dad suggested I go on a camping trip so I’d have something to do while they were away. It wasn’t that they wanted me out of the house—that wasn’t like them. After presenting the idea to my friends, they suggested we book a cabin so we’d have a place to stay. That sounded great to everyone in the group, so we decided to start looking.

After searching online, we found a cabin that was both affordable and nice: 2 beds, 2 baths, 1,400 square feet. It was ideal for a weeklong stay for four people. The group included me, Alex, Josh, and Juan.

Alex was a bright young man, known for being the smartest in our group. At 24, he was the oldest of us. Josh, At just 15 years old, he was the youngest. Juan was not exceptionally smart, but not clueless either. At 22, he was the second oldest. Then there was me—Michael. At 17, I was the second youngest in the group.

The rain was getting worse, and we could see a storm cloud rolling in. Luckily, my father had given me plenty of lessons on driving in the rain. Little did I know just how much I’d need that knowledge for this trip. At first, the car ride was smooth. We took the highway, but after traveling a certain distance, we were off the city roads and driving through the middle of nowhere.

The road had lots of bends and curves at first, but eventually, it straightened out. Then it started raining heavily. The rain didn’t ease up at all—it just kept coming down harder. As we got closer to the cabin, Josh looked at the instructions we’d printed. It said we needed to look under the planter pot by the porch to find the key. Simple enough. Josh and I joked for a while about how bold it was to leave the key in such an obvious spot.

When we arrived, we grabbed our bags from the car and ran to the porch through the rain. We lifted the pot, found the key, and opened the door.

Inside, I immediately felt cold. Maybe it was just the rain, or maybe the thermostat was set low, but something felt... off. I dismissed the feeling, thinking it was just paranoia. We turned on the lights and started looking around.

The bathroom was tidy, as though someone had cleaned it recently. The larger bedroom had a big bed, a closet with a robe, and a fresh batch of clean towels. The smaller bedroom had a smaller bed, and the other bathroom wasn’t as tidy but wasn’t dirty either. There was a TV in the front room, but it only had a few channels. The fridge held some fruit and five servings of some kind of meal.

That first night went great. Everyone ate dinner and chose their beds. Once everyone was settled, it was my job to turn off all the lights. I started in the kitchen, then the main room, and lastly in my and Josh’s room. I turned off the light, and we all went to bed.

The next morning, we ate breakfast, hung out outside for a bit, and then decided to go on a hike. While exploring, I came across an old, broken-down shed. Something about it felt off. It looked like it had been a utility shed for the cabin’s owner. I showed the rest of the group, and they were just as creeped out as I was.

After more exploring, we headed back to the cabin. But when we walked in, something was wrong. The lights weren’t how we’d left them, and some doors were open—doors Alex swore he had closed. Our first thought was that we weren’t alone.

We stood in silence until Juan yelled, “Hello?” No one answered, as expected. The rest of the night, everyone was unusually quiet. We made plans to lock all the doors in the house, including the bedroom doors. I turned off the lights again, and we all went to bed.

At 4:40 a.m., I woke up to a noise from the kitchen. Josh woke up too and asked, “What was that?” I grabbed my flashlight and headed downstairs to investigate. Juan and Alex came out of their rooms, probably for the same reason.

We found a cabinet open, with some of its contents spilled onto the floor. This made us all question whether we were truly safe in the cabin. We tried to go back to bed, but I couldn’t sleep.

---

The next day, we decided to stay at the cabin to make sure nothing else happened. It was uneventful—we watched a movie and later decided to go to the store. Someone had to stay behind, so we wrote our names on slips of paper and drew one from a cup. The name drawn? Michael. “That’s me,” I said.

Everyone left while I stayed on the couch. At first, everything was fine. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. It looked like someone was trying to come down the stairs but retreated when they saw me. A chill ran down my spine. I slowly crept upstairs.

When I opened the door to my room, I saw something I’ll never forget. Seven people were gathered in a circle, chanting. In the middle of the circle was a pedestal holding a crying baby. The people were wearing red, long capes with big hoods. At first I wasn't noticed by anyone. Then someone saw me standing in the doorway. They all slowly looked over at me in unison. I took off running.

I bolted downstairs and out the door, calling Alex in a panic. “Don’t come back to the cabin! I repeat, don’t come back! Stay at the store—I’ll meet you there.” He sounded confused, but I told him, “There’s no time to explain. Just stay put.”

When I got to the store, I told them what I’d seen. We decided to hitchhike home. We never looked back. To this day, we’ve never told anyone about what happened at that cabin, nor do we ever plan to.

Once we arrived home, we sat down and unpacked. I explained in much more detail about the events of that day and exactly what I saw. 

Next thing we know there was a knock at the door. I look over and answer it expecting my parents. Oh man was I wrong. I am greeted with a strange looking man. He had a long grey beard a large nose. He then asked if Michael (me) was here.At first I hesitated but I told him that I am who he was looking for. He walked inside without permission which was off-putting. He told me I was a witness of something I shouldn't have seen. This sent chills down my spine. I give my friends a look. We all jump up and run. The man quickly grabs my arm. His grip is stronger than anything over ever felt before. I can't get out. He drags me to his car and puts me in the back. He starts heading back towards the cabin. I start doing anything I can to try to escape. Nothing is working. Once we arrive he drags me out of the car. I am now in the cabin writing this from my phone in the living room and the rest of the cultists are upstairs "preparing". I don't know what they are going to do to me, but I know it won't be good
