I had a job now, but that’s not the important part. I just moved out of my parents’ house—not too far though, just a couple of blocks away. It doesn’t even feel like I’ve really left. I’ve been living here for about a week now, and everything seems...fine. Work’s been the same since the pandemic hit—remote, endless, and numb. I’ve grown used to the sleepless nights, staring at the blinding glow of my computer screen. It’s routine.

But something feels off here. Maybe it's the house. Or maybe it’s that damn manhole right outside my window. Every time I glance at it, especially at night, I get this weird feeling.

18 years ago, three kids were found dead inside that manhole. It was all over the news. I didn’t live here back then, but my parents mentioned it a few times when I was younger. The bodies were discovered under strange circumstances, and the cops never found out who did it. That’s where the rumors started. People in the neighborhood had all kinds of theories, but none of them stuck. The case went cold, and the manhole became just another part of the street—forgotten by most. Except me.

Now, I can’t shake the thought of it. Every night when I take a break from work and peek out the window, there’s this eerie silence. The street is dead still, no cars, no people. Just that damn manhole.

I did the only logical thing: I put curtains over my window and made sure they were shut tight at night. Out of sight, out of mind, right? But no matter how much I tried to block out that feeling, it wouldn’t leave. After all, it is a bit unsettling to look out and see a manhole where three kids were found dead, isn’t it? I also made sure to keep the outside lights on, every night without fail. Now it’s become this weird compulsive ritual. Curtains closed, lights on. Every. Single. Night.

I know, I’m a grown man. I shouldn’t be this scared. But honestly? I’ve always been a bit of a coward. The only thing that makes me feel somewhat safe is that I know some karate. Not much, but enough to give anyone a taste of it. I also keep a baseball bat nearby—you know, just in case. The neighborhood has a reputation for night robbers too, so I tell myself these precautions are just sensible.

I never go out after dark, not since moving here. I prepare my meals beforehand; just stuff I can toss in the microwave during work. It’s better that way, less reason to go outside...

Then one night, the power went out.

I grabbed my phone and carefully maneuvered through my room to the backup generator. I managed to message my boss, letting them know I had a power outage. But as I turned around, something made me stop. My heart was racing, and I didn’t know why until I glanced at the window. The curtains were down, but through the faint light outside, I saw something—a silhouette outside my window.

It was a man. Standing perfectly still.

I panicked, my breath catching in my throat. I told myself it was nothing. Maybe it was just my neighbor, or worse, a robber. I didn’t dare move. I just stood there, frozen, watching as the shadow shifted slightly, like it was inching closer. And then, just as suddenly, the power came back on. The lights flickered to life, and when I looked again, the figure was gone.

I tried to brush it off, convince myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But I couldn’t shake that image. The way he stood there, unmoving, like he was watching me.

A few months passed, and everything seemed to return to normal. But then, one day, I noticed this smell. It was faint at first, but it got stronger, sour, like rotting meat. It seemed to come from inside the house. I searched everywhere—the kitchen, the fridge, even under the furniture—but found nothing.

The stench grew worse with each passing day, like something was decaying nearby.

I reached out to the last people who lived in this house, hoping they’d tell me something—anything—about what was happening. But they seemed fine. They never smelled anything strange, never saw anything unusual. In fact, they seemed almost confused by my questions. That didn’t help. The feeling that something was deeply wrong gnawed at me even more.

So, I contacted the landlord. He told me that the drainage system was connected to the manhole outside. Great. Just what I needed. I don’t know anything about sewage systems, so I asked if he knew a plumber who could check things out. Meanwhile, the stench was getting worse. It wasn’t just inside my house anymore—my neighbors started to complain too. The air felt heavy, like it was pressing down on us, saturated with that foul, rotting smell.

We eventually called the local sewage department to come investigate. When they showed up, I stood back with a couple of neighbors, watching as they pried open the manhole. At first, everything seemed normal, just the usual grime and muck you’d expect. They were about to brush it off when I noticed something—the other manhole, the one across the street, was completely clear. Nothing was flowing through the pipe leading to it.

Something was blocking it.

They decided to pump water through to try and clear the clog. I watched as they set up the equipment, the sound of the machinery dulling the eerie silence that always seemed to hang around that manhole. The water shot through the pipe, and for a moment, nothing happened. Then, all at once, the workers froze.

I’ll never forget the look on their faces.

They pulled something out. It was... someone. An old man, bloated and lifeless, his skin discolored from what must’ve been months of decay. The workers scrambled back, swearing under their breath, but what really made my blood run cold was what he was holding.

In his dead, stiff hands were a book.

The police were called, of course. When they arrived and finally managed to pry the book loose, they discovered what was inside.

It was a journal. The old man had written down everything. His confessions. His crimes. He had been the one responsible for the deaths of those children, 18 years ago.

The police took the journal and the body away, but they couldn’t take the fear that now gripped me. The man had died trying to confess, trying to rid himself of the guilt that had clearly driven him mad.

That night, I kept my curtains shut tight, the lights burning bright outside. But even then, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. The street was too quiet. The manhole, now sealed, but seemed to be...still restless.
