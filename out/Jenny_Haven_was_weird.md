This is admittedly a long story,but I feel I have nowhere else to tell it.Jenny Haven was weird.I don't say that to bully Jenny Haven,I say it because it's true.She was weird,not only because she chewed her fingernails until blood stuck to her fingertips,but because she would chew other people's nails until blood stuck to their fingertips,if she was never managed to be wrestled off.She always had weird,violent behaviors.

Jenny Haven was my classmate.Our school was in small-town NEPA,or northeastern Pennsylvania.Our population was a measly 876,now its 870,two people died and a family moved since then.The school was so small that the highschool,middle school and elementary were individual halls,and our cafeteria was ridiculously small,it looked like a waiting room in a hospital.Jenny and I were somewhat friends,as in she had sat with me at lunch and had come to my house before,but my family told me not to invite her anymore after the third visit because she bit my pillow and ripped it with her sharp canine-like teeth.
Jenny left in 9th grade.As in her and her family disappeared suddenly and nobody heard from her until recently.Two girls had gone missing earlier that summer,the two aforementioned dead people,so everybody in the school made their own rumors about her also rumored death.

But now she was sitting infront of me,alive and well.

"You look..different."

I looked up at Jenny.Her jet black hair,which used to be jagged cut and curly was now long and straight.It flowed down her back,but it showed split ends when it stopped at the small of her back.Her stomach poked out much more than her thin arms and nimble legs,which were covered in tattoos devoid of much meaning,I already asked.She didn't wear any makeup besides a thin coat of lipgloss on her lips,which she smacked together constantly.The coffeehouse was quiet,everyone around us talked quietly among themselves,while we sat in an agonizing silence.

"I mean-"She laughed softly,"Definitely not in a bad way.You got so pretty."

"Thanks."I smiled softly.I took a sip from my iced coffee."Uhm..it was nice of you to invite me out here,Jenny.I mean,I never felt like we were best friends,but you were always..I liked you,and you are the last person I expected to hear from."

"Awh."She smiled bashfully,pushing a strand of hair behind her ear and bringing the plastic cup to her lips."Yeah,I was just thinking about all my friends from school.I've already gone to dinner with my two highschool friends,and you were always the friend from PA that stood out."

I barely questioned what she said.

"Yeah.I don't say this in a bad way,but is this some sort of..I don't know,therapeutic thing?"

"No."She shook her head,"I'm just..looking at memories."

"Yeah?"I took another sip.

"Well,I have been going to therapy,if you mean that.I know I always had anger issues as a kid."She smacked her lips together.

"I mean..you did."This was getting awkward.

"If you knew my family,I think you would know why."Jenny hummed and smacked her lips again.

"I'm not specialized in that stuff."I let out an awkward exhale."But,I understand how the family issues can make you do certain.."I hesitated,not wanting to offend her."..things?"

"I get that.Believe me,all those years of therapy really pushed that.Speaking of family,I brought my highschool friends to meet my parents,and my parents knew you and liked you,I think you should just come to my place after this.Well,my parents' place,I live with them cause they got all these weight issues and medical whatever...I take care of them,basically."

I have no idea why I accepted,but suddenly I was sitting in the passenger's seat of her small,cheap car listening to some recent pop song on the radio,which started cutting out as we drove further and further into obscure wilderness.At some point,I realized this wasn't too smart of me.
Her parent's house was a well-kept two story house standing abit away from a much more rundown barn.An older woman was smoking a cigarette on the front porch.The first thing I noticed,and something I kept to my own thoughts,was that this woman was extremely obese.Jenny wasn't lying about weight issues.If I had to accurately guess this woman's weight just by looking at her,I'd say about 500 pounds.That wasn't a jab or exaggeration.A cow in the barn gave a loud sniffle and moo.

"Who's this?"The woman called from the porch.

"My friend,Kimber.I told you I was gonna see a friend."Jenny smiled,leaning down and planting a kiss to her mother's cheek.

Her mother nodded slowly and flashed me a smile,showing off her rotted teeth,also unnaturally sharp.

"Hi."I smiled and nodded quickly.I didn't reach my hand out to shake.Jenny helped her mother out the seat and into her wheelchair,which must've been custome-made since it was fairly wider than the average wheelchair.

Her dad was at the dinner table,wearing nothing but a small pair of boxers.He was showcasing his rolls,which I honestly wouldn't mind,but these people truly seemed physically incapable of showering without Jenny's help,and the house smelled awful,of rot and sweat.I wanted to leave.

"Mommy,Daddy,you wouldn't mind if Kimber joined for dinner?She's gonna be going home after,or maybe I can show her around the farm after dinner,if that's okay."

Her father nodded."I don't care.She's a thin young thing,ain't she?Why don't your mommy watch some tv with her or something?"

"Alright.Any dinner requests?"Jenny smiled sweetly at me and guided my practically helpless self to the couch."Well,I got two."Her mother grabbed the remote and turned on the tv,switching it to an infomercial for some kitchen gadget.I was trying to think of an excuse to leave early.

"Well?"

"I'll tell you one.Those sausages you got from the market?Fry 'em,but also make some of that real good meat you got yesterday."

"Oh,you like that,huh?Kimber,this stuff is different,but it tastes like chicken.My friend sold it to me."

"Okay."I mumbled.I really wanted to be out of this house,I already was getting an awful feeling brewing in my stomach.

Jenny finished cooking and frying and whatever else pretty quickly,and she had the table set up and her mom seated next to her father pretty quickly aswell.I sat next to Jenny across from her parents.The meat next to the sausage was ripped in small shreds,almost liked pulled pork,but when I raised it to my lips I got a whiff of a putrid smell.My nose scrunched,but to be polite,I took a bite.

The taste only somewhat resembled chicken,there was a taste of something I had never tasted before.It was weird to my tastebuds,since it was a completely new taste that my tongue had to try to identify.It was okay,but there was an aftertaste that soaked my throat.I took a bite of the sausage to get rid of the aftertaste.
Her parents ate like savages.They teared into their sausage and the juices of the other meat soaked their chins.I really wanted to go home.I felt like I was in a horror movie.

We ate in silence.The only sound filling the empty house was her parents obnoxious chewing and swallowing.Their plates were all cleared,yet mine still had the pile of unidentified meat laying on it.I managed to finish the sausage.My stomach stirred uncomfortably.

"It's okay.Daddy will eat it,won't you daddy?"Jenny smiled."I want to show you the barn before it gets dark anyway."

The father ripped my plate from my grasp and immediately dug into the meat.Jenny helped me out my seat and the two of us walked out the house.I felt helpless.I should've ran off at that point,but I was still too scared of being rude,plus what if it was just a bad feeling?

Jenny and I walked out to the barn.The entire time she explained to me how they had bought the barn from a friend's family cause the friend passed,and other things.I was too focused on the uncomfortable feeling brewing in my stomach.

The tall,un-mowed grass tickled at the back of my legs.The stink of the barn hit my nostrils as we got closer.My nose scrunched as the smell of feces,and that familiar putrid smell of the unidentified meat hit my nostrils.Jenny smacked her lips and let out a small laugh,"Yeah.It can smell bad in here."

She showed me each of the animals,and had me pet each and every animal.We got to the back of the barn.

Jenny stared at me.I expected her to say something more,but she didn't.I tried to make conversation."The animals were all...friendly.I loved your sheep."

Jenny nodded slowly,but still didn't say anything.I hummed and awkwardly looked around the barn,looking for something to comment on.

There was a belt laying in the straws of hay.It was a women's belt.I found myself slowly walking to it,and picking it up.It felt weird,and dried blood stained my fingers.I stared at it closely,and suddenly,I realized.

That wasn't no meat from a cow,pig,or even a turkey.That was human.

My stomach arched inward and my throat tightened as I hurled puke onto the hay.Jenny grabbed me as I hurled once more.Her fingernails dug into the skin of my waist.I struggled in her grasp,wiggling and desperately trying to throw my head back against her somehow.Puke stained my shirt,and my nose scrunched as multiple bad scents entered my nostrils.I finally managed to scream,and I hurled my foot at her kneecap.She tripped and fell onto her knees.I struggled out her grasp and ran towards the entrance of the barn.Jenny quickly managed to her feet and followed.

I grabbed the pitchfork leaning against the wall and,without much planning or thinking,stabbed it straight through her chest.I let out a blood-curdling screech as I watched dark crimson blood spray from her chest.She held tightly to the handle of the pitchfork and used the last of her strength to try to push it out her chest,then she fell back.I pushed her down to the floor,and I at first covered hay over her using the blood-soaked pitchfork.I realized that didn't work well,so I grabbed her body and threw her into the pig trough.I resisted the urge to puke on myself again.The pigs quickly gnawed their teeth into her body,ripping the flesh easily.

We were miles away from anyone else,or any town,so I realized running wasn't an option.I needed the keys,but she left them inside the house.

I ran to the house and walked inside."Jenny needs the keys to take me home.She forgot them."I explained quickly,hoping they couldn't see past my lie.I was covered in blood and puke.I smelled putrid.The father narrowly stared at me."What's with the puke?"

I stuttered,"Uhm..animal shit..it smells bad."I managed out."Where are the keys?"I swallowed.The father steadily managed to stand up.He slowly walked towards me.The floorboards creaked and bent inwards with every step of his.I took a step back."Where's Jenny?",He asked slowly.He sounded like he didn't believe me.My eyes shifted around the room,and I finally found the keys.They were on the small table next to the couch."In the car."I whispered.I ran past him,accidentally tripping him.He fell to the floor with a loud thud.The cheap wooden floor crippled and cracked beneath him.He gasped out loudly.The mother gasped,"He's having a heart attack!Shit!Get Jenny!"

"I dont give a shit."I whispered.I grabbed the keys and ran out the house.I ran to the car and started it.Once it rumbled,letting me know it started,I sped off the property.I left the car in a park seven miles east of my house,walked a mile,and called a friend to pick me up.I told her that one of Jenny's animals attacked me,explaining the blood,and I puked because the feces smelt bad.

That was nearly two weeks ago now.The mother called the police for her husband.They came and questioned me.

As far as I'm concerned,Jenny Haven drove me home that day,and she must've gone missing on the drive home.
