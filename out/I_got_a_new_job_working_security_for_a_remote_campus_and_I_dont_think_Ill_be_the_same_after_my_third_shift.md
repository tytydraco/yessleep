I showed up for Night 3 with a baseball bat in my trunk.

Jane saw me pull it out and shook her head. "That won't help you, Max. The rules will. Trust them."

"The rules didn't save Fergus," I said.

"No," she agreed quietly. "But they saved you. And that's what matters."

She didn't give me any new protocols, no additional rules or warnings. Just looked at me with something that might have been sympathy and said, "Be ready tonight. They're learning, but so are you."

As she drove away, I stood in the parking lot wondering what that meant. Ready for what?

The evening check went smoothly. Titus, Belle, and Daisy were calm enough to accept their alfalfa treats, which was a relief after the previous night. Six pigs in the pen - well, five now, plus the space where Fergus should have been. Three cows chewing cud peacefully.

Everything seemed normal until I started my 11:30 PM rounds.

The weather station gate was locked, just as it should be. No scarecrow in the field. I was turning to head back when I saw movement in the tall grass along the dirt road.

I froze, flashlight trained on the spot. The grass swayed unnaturally, something large moving through it about thirty yards away. Then, for just a moment, I saw it.

One of those creatures, crouched low in the vegetation. Its eyes reflected my flashlight beam, two points of greenish light in the darkness.



We stared at each other across the distance. I expected it to charge, to attack like they had before. Instead, it just watched me. Waiting.

Rule 6 flashed through my mind: *Do not take the dirt road from the weather station to the stables anytime after 11pm. Stick to the path with the lamps.*

I backed away slowly, keeping to the lighted path. The creature didn't follow. It just stayed there in the grass, watching me retreat. The whole thing felt wrong - why wasn't it pursuing? These things had been aggressive, coordinated. This one was just... observing.

Unless it was waiting for something else.

I hurried back toward the main buildings, suddenly hyperaware of every shadow, every sound. The creature in the grass was a distraction, I realized. It wanted me focused on that spot while something else happened elsewhere.

The stables. I had to check the stables.

I broke into a run, rules momentarily forgotten in my panic. When I burst through the stable entrance, everything seemed fine at first. The horses were alert but calm, all three of them visible in their stalls.

Titus in stall one. Belle in stall two. Daisy in stall three.

And another horse in stall four.

I stopped dead, my flashlight beam settling on the fourth animal. It was slightly larger than the others, dark coat similar to Titus's but not quite right. The proportions were off somehow - legs too long, head cocked at an odd angle.

As I stared, the horse turned to look at me. Its eyes reflected light wrong, that same greenish glow I'd seen in the grass. And its teeth, when it pulled back its lips, were sharp. Sharper than any horse's teeth should be.

"Oh God," I whispered.

The thing that looked like a horse took a step toward me. Behind it, I could hear Titus, Belle, and Daisy going wild in their stalls, kicking and whinnying in terror. They knew what it was, even if it had fooled me for a moment.

The creature's form began to shift. Its legs bent, bones cracking and reforming. The horse-face elongated further, becoming that wolf-like snout I'd seen before. Dark fur rippled across its body as it dropped from four legs to two, rising to its full seven-foot height.

I backed away, but there was nowhere to go. It blocked the main entrance, and the other exit led to the bathroom - the bathroom with the window, the one that wasn't safe.

The creature took another step forward, claws scraping against the concrete floor. Its mouth opened, and it made a sound that was almost like speech. 

My name, distorted and wrong: "Maaahhahhaaxx."

My hand fumbled for the radio at my belt. Channel 4. The emergency channel.

I had no idea what would happen. The rule just said to use it in life or death situations. This definitely qualified.

I switched the channel and pressed the transmit button.

The sound that erupted from the radio was unlike anything I'd ever heard. A high-pitched screeching that seemed to exist at the very edge of human hearing, painful even to me. But to the creature, it was agonizing.

The thing that had been pretending to be a horse stumbled backward, claws going to its ears. Dark liquid, blood, maybe, started seeping between its fingers. It opened its mouth in a silent scream, the sound of the radio drowning out everything else.

I held down the transmit button, keeping the screeching sound going. The creature fell to its knees, then onto its side, thrashing. Through the stable entrance, I could see movement outside - the other creatures, the ones that had been waiting in the darkness, fleeing from the sound.

They moved as a pack, three or four shapes racing away from the buildings toward the tree line. The one in the grass, the ones that must have been positioned around the perimeter, all of them retreating at once.

I kept the button pressed for what felt like an eternity but was probably only thirty seconds. When I finally released it, my ears were ringing and my hand was shaking.

The creature in the stable wasn't moving anymore. Its form had shifted back partially. No longer horse-like, but not quite its natural shape either. Something in between, broken and wrong.

I stepped around it carefully, giving it a wide berth even though it seemed unconscious or dead. The real horses were still agitated but unharmed. I did a quick count of the other animals: five pigs, three cows, all accounted for.

When I finally made it back to the security office, I radioed Jane on Channel 2.

"It's Max. I... I had to use Channel 4."

There was a long pause. Then: "Are you hurt?"

"No. But there's one of them in the stables. I don't know if it's dead or just unconscious."

"We'll handle it. Stay in the office until dawn. Don't go back out there."

"Jane, what the hell is Channel 4? What was that sound?"

Another pause. "Protection, kiddo. That's all you need to know. You did well."

The rest of the shift was quiet. I watched through the office window as a van pulled up around 3 AM, not a university vehicle, something unmarked. Two people in hazmat-style suits went into the stables and came out twenty minutes later carrying something large in a black bag.

They didn't acknowledge me. Just loaded their cargo and drove away.

When Jane arrived at 6 AM, she looked relieved to see me in one piece.

"They'll be more cautious now," she said. "You hurt one of them badly. They'll remember that."

"How long has this been going on?" I asked. "How many guards before me?"

"Long enough. And you're not the first, no." She handed me an envelope. "Hazard pay bonus. You've earned it."

Inside was a check for five thousand dollars.

"This is a month's salary," I said, staring at it.

"Consider it combat pay. You went above and beyond the protocols and survived. That's worth rewarding." She paused. "Will you be back tomorrow night?"

I looked out at the campus as the sun started to rise. The weather station sat peacefully in its field. The stables looked completely normal, no sign of the violence that had occurred there hours ago. Everything appeared exactly as it should be - a quiet veterinary campus, nothing more.

But I knew better now. I knew what hunted in the darkness, what the rules were really protecting me from. And I knew that Channel 4 radio frequency was the only thing standing between me and those creatures.

"Yeah," I said finally. "I'll be back."

Jane smiled slightly. "Good. Because they're not going anywhere. And someone needs to keep watch."

As I drove home, I couldn't stop thinking about what she'd said. They're not going anywhere. How long had these things been here? Were they the reason Spring Hill Campus was built so far from everything else? Was the veterinary program just a cover for something else entirely?

I had so many questions. But I also had five thousand dollars in hazard pay and a growing understanding that some answers weren't worth the price of finding them.

I quit the next day.

Jane didn't seem surprised when I called. "You lasted longer than most," she said. "Three nights is respectable."

"What happens now? Who takes over?"

"Someone always does. There's always another person who needs the money, who doesn't ask too many questions." A pause. "Take care of yourself, Max."

I used the hazard pay to cover my expenses while I found a new job - day shift retail, boring as hell, but safe. Sometimes I drive past the Spring Hill Campus turnoff on my way to class and wonder who's working nights there now. Whether they're following the rules. Whether they've had to use Channel 4 yet.

I still have nightmares about that fourth horse, about the way its bones cracked and shifted as it transformed. About Fergus being carried away into the darkness. About those intelligent eyes watching me from the tall grass.

But I'm alive. I survived three nights at Spring Hill Campus, and that's more than some people can say.
