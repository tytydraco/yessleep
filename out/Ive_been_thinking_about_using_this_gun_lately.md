"You know that the pistons are on the up and up right"? 

I scoffed, thinking that was the silliest thing I've heard today, even more than the claim that the spurs had a chance to make the playoffs. 

"Stop with all the prediction bullshit, your never right in them anyways."
"Ha, I admit my predictions have been a little shaky lately but this time I know for sure." 

Brandon poured another shot, it was cheap low shelf vodka. The way he drank it like water concerned me, no care in sight, and he always got too drunk. 

"Better slow down before it gets dark."
"I'm fine Ken, don't worry. I'm gonna cap it after a few more."

"A few more"

He's been drinking like a fish since we've been here. But with no issues. I'm sure tonight won't be any different, God I hope so.

"The Lakers though man, they got a good squad, I can see them in the western conference finals for sure". 

I looked at him and broke a small smile. His eyes were glowing with the moon reflecting off of them. He stared at it for a good 20 seconds before taking another shot.

Outside it was windy, the store rattled from time to time when a huge gust came through. The bottles even clanked near the windows it was so strong. But I knew that in the next two hours, everything would be silent. Even them. 


Brandon was true to his word. He put the bottle down after a few shots. We had no problem with food, the chips and candy bars was what was for dinner. Washed down by water.

After dinner, we checked the building. It all seemed to be secure. We took our bags and decided to call it a night. As soon as we layed down, the wind slowed down. That's unusual I thought. Its calming down alot sooner than usual. Looking outside I seen the sun quickly retreating behind the earth. Great, in about an hour, they will come. Or maybe sooner? We've been okay so far here, why would tonight be any different?

"Hey kenny?"
"Yes?"
"Have you gotten used to this yet? I mean sleeping?

"You get used to it."
  
"I'm afraid to sleep tonight, I don't know why but it feels hard to relax, like I should be awake and I'm fighting that, like, I wanna keep up and watch the windows."

My heart skipped a beat

"Why do you feel that way?"

"I'm just not tired, also im curious about out there. Not to mention my stomach hurts and my back, more spinal feeling, but I'm also hungry too, we just ate, but I'm thirsty." 

"Just, drink a little water and close your eyes, you'll eventually fall asleep bud."

"Okay, maybe the vodka ain't sitting right with me....hey leo?"
"What??"
"Do you got any water?"

I didn't respond, he just refilled his bottle a few minutes ago, from the store sink.

"Hey court? Do you have any vodka?, I need it for the water."
I closed my eyes shut tight. And clenched my jaw while balling my fist until it hurt.
"Hey Josh...
I kept ignoring
"Hey da... da..... daario, someone's here..."




I got up immediately and looked outside, the sun was just leaving us, over the set horizon. Quickly I checked the windows and doors. They were solid as ever with no sign of attempted force entry. Looking around through the open slots I seen nothing. As I went back to the main room, Brandon was alert on his feet, Standing still with the vodka bottle in his hand.


"Brandon what are you doing with that? It's okay boy, nothing is here."

"My stomach hurts so much, I need this right now, I need to heal my gut."
"Then drink water, alcohol will only make it worse, cmon now and put the bottle down."

"I cant."

"Why??"

"I'm waiting for the wind."

With my sights on Brandon I shuffle to my bag and pull out my fully loaded pistol. I  Cocked it and aimed it directly at Brandon. Bent expression consumed my face and I found myself and eyes quivering along with epiphora. At that very moment, I heard the worst shrills and agonizing moans outside the building, they were even coming through the air vents from the ceiling. 

Brandon took his bottle of vodka and took a huge drink, all the while staring me down.

"Give me the bottle and sit down, I don't wanna have to shoot you, please, don't make me shoot you...please."
"Mark you need to relax and put that gun down, your gonna hurt somebody."

"Stop it! your a liar, your not who you are! just think! Remember who you are! Remember what's happened. Your stronger than this, I know it, just snap out of it!"

The window to our left broke open, and a  strong normal human hand broke through, I turned and shot a few rounds at him. The bullets flew through the barricade as I heard him react. I must have shot him in the neck as I heard blood gurgling and the sound of someone trying to breath. The blood running down his arm dripped on the dark floor. Then he pulled his arm from the wood leaving a bigger hole, with blood all around it. The man stayed there, gurgling and fighting for his life. Just standing there and trying to breath. Breathing blood in and out of that little hole I caused. After a minute or two he never moved or stopped so I screwed a new board over the blood stained one. And took a deep breath as I watched Brandon. 


 After a few moments, it all went silent. My heart, and hand shaking like it has never have before. Sweat dripping off my forehead and swinging around my cheek bones into my eyes, eventually dripping off the tip of my nose. I looked over to Brandon, who had the bottle of vodka still on him, he acted confused. 

"Brandon, I'm sorry I wasn't there when I should have been, I know how bad stuff was for you, I know how sad and lost you must have felt, I know how much you needed me and wanted nothing more than to spend time with me. I'm genuinely truly so sorry."

The doors broke open, the windows shattered and the barricades collapsed, and the vent caved in from the ceiling. 

"I love you son, more than you will ever know."

2 gunshots rang from the liquor store to the outside world. It wasn't so silent in that moment, the wind consumed most of it. 






The end.
