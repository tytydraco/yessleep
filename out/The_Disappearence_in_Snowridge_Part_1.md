I regretted volunteering for this job long before I arrived in Snowridge.I’d come to regret it even more later on, but arriving in Colorado in the middle of winter was enough to have me regretting it from the get go.

Anyway, let's not get too far ahead. I’ll tell you a little about myself. My name is Evan Smith, well not really, but that’s what you can call me. I can’t reveal my real name for privacy reasons, the case is still ongoing so putting too much out there would bring me under a lot of fire. Snowridge isn’t even the real name of the town. 

With that out of the way, I’ll continue.

About one week ago “travel vlogger” Scott Terence went missing, no that’s not his real name either. Snowridge was the last place he checked in, made some video about “trolling” the townsfolk and then radio silence. It’s not FBI work to look for missing small time influencer wannabes, but the kid’s Dad has connections, probably how he was able to travel vlog with barely 2000 subscribers. 

Anyway, one thing to another and there I was. Driving a rented car through snowy Colorado. Nothing of note happened on the journey. I picked up a McDonalds about halfway through and decided that I needed to shower when I next got the opportunity. Being stuck on a plane for four hours and running through an airport for two really builds a stench. .

I wasn’t sure whether to book into a hotel or meet the Sheriff first when I got to town. The option was made for me though, I just so happened to run into him when I parked outside of the only hotel in the entire town.

He introduced himself as Hilary Fletcher. I half expected him to be called Butch or Big Jim or something since he looked exactly how you’d expect a small town Sheriff to look. Cowboy hat, moustache, aviators and a shiny badge on top of a longmire coat. The only thing that stood out was that Sheriff Fletcher was an absolute giant of a man. Easily a head taller than me and wide as a doorway. He knew it too, pulled me right in and stood over me when he shook my hand.

The conversation was the usual and expected spiel. He gave the typical “We don’t see Feds around these parts” line and asked why the case was so important. I was straight and told him that Terence’s Dad is important. After the all too common “Well if you need any help!” Fletcher patted me just a little too hard on the shoulder and left.

My room was surprisingly nice. Comfy bed, serviceable TV, good internet connection and a shower with good water pressure. So many places I’ve stayed at have been let down by having showers that are no stronger than a tap.

I got unpacked and changed my clothes before heading out again. It was nearing 6PM so I decided to get something to eat and begin the investigation tomorrow. 

There was a diner just across the road and a few yards down from the hotel, so it was an easy decision. It was a nice place, 50s style as these places usually are, but it was warm and clean. The old lady behind the counter smiled as I approached, but before I could make my order, the only familiar face in town emerged. 

“Betty!” Sheriff Fletcher boomed. “I see you’re meeting our little visitor!” He clapped his hand onto my shoulder and shook me slightly. The man clearly has a need to be dominant and I’m already getting sick of it. “Now you treat him nice, ya here?” Is what he finished with before slapping my back and walking back to his seat. He sat in a corner booth next to a young, skinny guy in a similar uniform. Clearly a deputy, I wonder what he thinks of the Sheriff?

I sat in the booth next to the door, the opposite side to the Sheriff, facing away from him. I’d have sat in the other far corner but that would look like I’m trying to keep away from him.

My food arrived fast, a chicken salad sandwich that was so stuffed with chicken I could barely get my mouth around it. I like this place. While I ate, I decided to take the place in. Near the bathroom, on the opposite end of the diner to Sheriff Fletcher, was a notice board filled with children’s drawings. 

I smiled at the crudely drawn cast of Paw Patrol and got a pang of nostalgia from seeing what looked like Pikachu. But a picture of a pale bald man in a tuxedo with a nose longer than Toucan Sam’s stumped me. 

The waitress noticed my staring when she filled up my coffee and helpfully intervened.”He;s caught your attention huh?”

“I don’t watch kids’ TV, but I’ve seen a lot of stuff around. Never seen him.” I answered.

“He’s not a TV character.” She confirmed. “That’s the Long Nosed Man. He’s sort of a local legend/ghost story around here. Most of the kids here are terrified of him, but a few love him.”

I thanked her and finished my food before leaving, and before an extended amount of eye contact with the Sheriff when I reached the door.

I’d rate my sleep a 7/10. I woke up feeling rested enough, but not exceptionally energetic. 

To begin the investigation, I already knew exactly where to go. Terence’s final post said that he was headed up into the mountain. So, freezing cold as it might be, that’s where I had to go.

I grit my teeth and made my first stop at the Sheriff’s station. Their trucks will be better for heading up there and Fletcher did offer any help I needed. I braced myself and headed inside, only to be relieved when I was welcomed in by a woman’s voice.

I looked up to see a woman who was clearly another deputy. I relaxed slightly knowing I wouldn’t have to deal with the Sheriff.

“Agent Evans, right? Hilary filled me in on the whole situation. He’s off getting breakfast so you can deal with me for now.”

What a relief.

“I’m headed into the mountains.” I informed her. “I’m going to need to borrow a truck to head up there.”

Only a few seconds passed before she flung a set of keys at me. “There’s two trucks out back, we only ever use one at a time. Just bring it back when you’re done.”“Thanks.” I said, pocketing the keys. “What’s your name by the way?”

“Jane, Jane Hunter.”

Driving through the snow wasn’t easy. I skidded a few times and lost the path a lot, sometimes by a pretty wide gap. I’d been driving for nearly two hours when I saw a building in the distance. 

Pulling up it was pretty easy to tell that the place used to be a ski lodge. Looked pretty nice too. Stepping inside further confirmed this. The couches were old and decayed but clearly would have been nice back in the day, the windows were dirty but they practically took up the entire wall, letting you see out into the mountain. 

But the thing that really caught my attention was the sound. 

I drew my glock from beneath my jacket and slowly made my way to the stairs. Once I reached the top of the stairs I could tell it was a voice. 

“Hello!?” I called out.

No response. 

Slowly, I walked to the end of the hall. The sound was coming from the right hand door. I reached out and gently pushed the door, letting it swing open and unveiling the source of the noise.

It was a phone, Scott Terence’s phone. I don’t know how the hell it was able to stay on for this long, especially if it’s been playing this whole time. But that doesn’t matter. It was playing a video that hadn’t been uploaded yet, which was a potential treasure trove. I turned the phone off before shoving it into my pocket. 

Then there was a crash, it sounded like it came from across the hall and it was heavy. I ran to the door and grabbed the knob. Locked. Why was it locked? All of the other doors are open. I took a step back and kicked, the decaying wood provided barely any resistance. The door swung in revealing… Nothing. The room was as put together and aged as all of the others. But one thing stood out, lying perfectly in the centre of the bed was a road flare.

Carefully, I walked into the room and plucked the flare from the bed before heading to the stairs. My goal now was to head back to Snowridge, there was no use continuing the investigation until I found out what was on this phone.

But when I got to the bottom of the stairs, something hit me.

And I don’t mean an idea, I mean *something* hit me. I flew across the lodge and landed at the foot of the old couch, the wind knocked out of me. I turned to look at it, and that’s when I froze.

It was some kind of monster. Fat and grey with baggy skin, its head sat in the middle of what would be its chest if it were human. The thing had two eye sockets, one held a bulging yellow eye and the other was covered by a thin layer of skin and it’s jaw hung open like it was dislocated on one side, revealing a mismatch of long, razor sharp and short blunted teeth.

Overcome with fear and shock I didn’t move, the thing grabbed me again, lifting me over its head and throwing me at the lodge’s bar.

Pain shot through my back as it collided with the wooden edge. The monstrosity shambled towards me again and I willed myself to move. I pulled my gun back out from its holster and took aim at the thing’s mess of a head.

*POP POP POP*

I fired three shots into it and the thing stumbled back. I dragged myself to my feet and put three more into it. It wasn’t going down, but if I could slow it until I got back to the truck-

I couldn’t. The shots had made the thing angry and it charged on me like a bull, taking me off my feet and pinning me to the wall.

Again, the air was knocked out of my lungs and I’m certain that I cracked a rib. My gun clattered to the floor and the monster continued to press into me, like it wanted to crush me against the wall. I saw the flare dangling out of my pocket and I had to give it a shot. It was that or nothing. Gripping the flair with my thumb and index finger, I managed to fish it out of my pocket and bring it above my head. There my other hand gripped it properly, my index finger found the cord and I ripped it with all the strength I had left.

The flare burst to life and, with adrenaline pumping, I plunged it down into the thing’s good eye socket. It screamed this awful scream, like a howl mixed with a bird’s screech, and dropped me as it stumbled back, its head catching fire and that fire soon spreading throughout the rest of its body.

I grabbed my gun from the floor and put three final shots into it before running out of the door and back to the truck.

Since I arrived back in town I’ve told no one any of this. And that’s why I’m here, none of them would believe me, but I’ve got to share it somewhere.

Thanks for reading. I’ll keep you all updated.
