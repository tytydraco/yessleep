“Are we there yet?” my wife asked jokingly.

I let out a light chuckle but ignored her question. Despite my silence, she'd already noticed the faintest smile crack on my face, and immediately went on to tease me about it.

“You see, things aren't that bad.”

We'd already been driving for seven hours.... a long journey to get away from the dread of daily life. Hotel Skjærsilden was our destination, an idyllic place miles away from civilization, hidden in the mountains, surrounded by nothing but nature.

“How do you even pronounce the name?” Alice asked.

“No idea. I think it's Scandinavian or something. Don't know what it means, though.”

“Really? Then how did you even find it?”

It was a good question. One I hadn't thought about since picking the brochure off my desk at home. It was just there. Whether it had arrived with the mail, or if it had been handed to me by a stranger on the street, I didn't know.

“Eh, just got the brochure. It was a good deal,” was all I could respond.

I stayed quiet for most of the drive, only uttering a few words of frustration as I attempted to navigate the desolate roads. Alice, being the wonderful person she was, kept the mood light. Throughout our entire relationship, I'd never seen her smile fade.

“So, you ready to talk about what happened?” she asked.

I shook my head. It had already been a year since it happened, and I'd found my place in uncomfortable denial. The holiday would be way to ignore the facts of real life, but I just couldn't bring myself to talk about it.

“Can't we just enjoy this week out of town?”

She nodded, and went back to pointing out the amazing environment around us.

\*\*\*

Five hours later, we found ourselves traveling up a treacherous, mountain road. Though decayed, it provided us a beautiful view of the valley beneath. Before long, the peak of Hotel Skjærsilden greeted us, and I let out a sigh of relief.

Its architecture was magnificent, starkly contrasting the lush trees around it. The design was old, but it remained amazingly well kept; a staple from times long since passed.

“Does the place at least match the pictures from your mysterious brochure?” she asked.

I took a quick look over the beautiful structure, and nodded.

“It actually does.”

“Well, that's a good start!”

There were a few elderly people sitting out on the porch,

enjoying cups of tea and smoking cigarettes. They were dressed elegantly in ballroom dresses andfancy suits... a bit odd for such a casual place.

As I unloaded our car, I noticed that we'd only brought one, massive bag.

“Where are your things?” I asked.

“Come on, I don't need anything,” Alice chuckled. “Besides, it's an all-inclusive hotel.”

I scoffed as I struggled to get the luggage out. “You just put your stuff in my bags, didn't you?”

By the entrance stood a large, wooden sign that read: “Hotel Skjærsilden. Helping people rest since 1886.”

We entered through the front door, which led us to a large hall divided between reception and a restaurant. I glanced over at the well- stocked bar, and saw a couple of women enjoying exotic drinks clearly not native to the area.

“Hello, I have a booking for Alex Henson,” I told the man behind the reception desk.

He was a well-dressed man in his early fifties. He wore a red uniform and a bow tie, and smiled wide. In a way, he didn't really fit in with the rustic design of the hotel, but he seemed friendly enough.

“Mr. Henson, yes of course. My name is Alazar Winchester, welcome to Hotel Skjærsilden,” he said as he pointed to a set of stairs. “Let me show you to your room. We've situated you with a beautiful view of the mountain range.”

As we walked, we passed a few tired-looking guests, just hanging aimlessly around in the hallways. They looked out of place, wearing clothes better fit for the last century. Most of them were elderly, but there were a few, peculiar looking young characters as well. One looked like he'd been taken straight out of Woodstock, and another could have been on the set of a fifties gangster movie.

“Mind if I ask you a question?”

“Of course, Mr. Henson. I'm here to help.”“What's up with the costumed people?”

“Oh, don't worry about that. Some of our guests have been here for a while. At this point, we consider them more family than visitors.”

“Excuse me?”

“They're quite harmless, I assure you.”

Without really answering my questions, he guided us into our room. It was larger than expected, and beautifully decorated, full on with a piece of chocolate laid out on our pillows. All things considered, it looked like the beginning of a perfect getaway.

I quickly freshened myself up, using the hotel provided accessories, and got ready for dinner.

“Aren't you going to unpack?” Alice asked as I headed for the door.

“Nah, I'll do it later.”

We headed down to the bar, and noticed Mr. Winchester standing by the entrance, waiting for guests.

“Would you like a table by the window?” he asked with a smile.

We nodded, and he led us to a table with a clear view of the magnificent forest.

“How about a drink?” he asked.

Alice looked over at me, and I knew exactly what she wanted to order.

“Maybe this is too presumptuous, but if you could get us a couple of Caipirinhas?” Alice asked.

“Absolutely, they'll be right up!”

My wife looked at me in amazement. “Wow, wouldn't have expected them to actually know what it is.”

It was our private, favorite drink, a tradition we'd formed during our honeymoon in Brazil. Within a couple of minutes, they had been served, looking remarkably similar to the ones we'd been introduced to near Fernando de Noronha. Even the glasses themselves matched our memory to a tee.

We clinked glasses and reminisced about simpler times. Just the taste was enough to put us back in time.

“It's perfect. I haven't had one of those since...” I trailed off. Something within me stopped me from completing the sentence, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

“Hey, look at that guy,” Alice said as she bobbed her head in the direction of a middle aged man, dressed in a cheap suit.

He looked stressed, frantically sucking on a cigarette as he went through a pile of papers. The fumes from his smoking filled the restaurant, and quickly got on my nerves.

“Hey, could you not smoke inside?” I asked as politely as possible, trying to mask my annoyance behind a friendly smile.

“Why, is it bothering you?”

“Well, it's not exactly polite to smoke inside.”

“It isn't? Since when?” he asked as he quickly put it out. “I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.”

He went back to reading his files, and we continued our dinner. After a three-course meal, we proceeded to get a couple of drinks at the bar. The man still sat at his table, mumbling something to himself, as he sipped on a glass of whiskey. He fumbled with an unlit cigarette, looking at it with longing eyes.

I felt slightly guilty, having imposed my own rules on the man. If the hotel didn't have a policy against smoking inside, who was I to stop him? Slightly tipsy, I decided to engage with the stranger, while Alice went to freshen up.

“You can light it up,” I told him. “I don't mind, I just didn't realize the hotel was alright with it.”

He hesitated for a moment, before igniting it with a vintage lighter. “Thanks. So what brings you folks around these parts?” he asked.

“Just needed a break from real life,” I responded. “What about you?”

“Well, the precinct decided I needed to take some time off to – well, recuperate.”

I glanced at the pile of papers that were pouring out of his folder.

“Looks like you're not exactly following orders,” I joked.

“Well, murderers don't take time off, as far as I know. If I'm honest, I'm not exactly fond of the captain. If he wants me to keep away from the station, I will, but I'll be damned if I give this case up.”

“Oh, you're a detective?”

He nodded. “Yeah, for the past twenty-five years, what about you?”

“I'm a journalist,” I responded instinctively, before having to correct myself. “Well, at least I used to be.”

He chuckled. “As a detective, I guess I should thank you for quitting.”

I glanced at his file. It was stained with coffee and crumbled from being read one too many times.

“The case isn't related to this hotel?” I asked, half joking, half serious.

“No, don't worry. I guess it's more personal at this point, not entirely professional, but...”

He sighed, and closed his folder, sloppily shoving all the papers inside. “But I can't get a grip on this tonight. Justice will have to wait. Enjoy your night.”

With that, he got up to leave. It wasn't until he'd left the lobby, before I noticed a piece of paper left behind. In his drunken state, he must have dropped one as he closed the folder.

I picked it up, not intending to look at it, but at a glance, I noticed a date: 7th of January 1978. It appeared the detective was working on a forty year old case. Confused, but keeping my nose out of trouble, I handed it in to the reception. Hopefully it would find its rightful owner.

Slightly unsettled, we decided to call it a night. On our short journey to our room, we heard the faint sounds of a girl sobbing. With the dimly lit hallways, and the echoing walls, it was hard to pinpoint the exact origin.

“Do you hear that?” Alice asked.

“Is someone crying?”

“Yeah, we should check it out.”

Alice had a big heart, sometimes too kind for her own well-being. But her willingness to help anyone in times of need was part of why I loved her.

We traversed the long hallways, and eventually found a young women sitting in a chair by the windows. Her face was buried in her hands, and her clothes looked roughed up and soaking wet.

“Hey, are you okay?” Alice asked comfortingly.

She just kept sobbing.

“What happened to you, are you hurt?”

“It's so cold,” she sobbed in response. Her voice sounded off, as if her lungs were filled with fluid.

I took my jacket off, and tried handing it to her. In response, she finally lifted her head from her hands, and looked at us. I almost fell to the ground in shock, as I saw her horrifically disfigured face. At a first glance, it looked like someone had smashed it in with a hammer. Her eye socket had caved in, and her nose was broken beyond recognition.

“Please, it's so cold.”

Despite her wounds, she didn't bleed. She just sat there and cried, barely able to breathe through her crushed chest.

“Oh, my God!” I shouted loudly in shock, an immediate sense of fear shooting through my body. 

Before we could properly react, Mr. Winchester came rushing down the hall with a couple of bellboys.

“Mr. Winchester, we have to call an ambulance,” I said. “Oh, that won't be necessary,” he said matter-of-factly.

He ordered the bellboys to carry the injured girl away, and turned his attention towards us. “Why don't you come with me?”

With that, he escorted us to his office. As we sat down, he poured us a drink. His smile had vanished, and he looked almost embarrassed at the whole situation.

“I'm so terribly sorry you had to see that. We weren't expecting such a gruesome arrival tonight.”

“What do you mean, expecting? What happened to her?”

“Well, we don't know yet, Mr. Henson. But I can assure you, we're going to get her the help she needs, and figure out how she came to be in such a state.”

He seemed genuinely apologetic and concerned about the girl. Though unsettled, we couldn't exactly drive down the mountainous road in the middle of the night. Our best bet would be to wait it out, and maybe ask the detective for help when morning came.

Despite the horrors we'd witnessed that evening, sleep came surprisingly easy…a silent, dreamless slumber, only interrupted by singing birds in the early morning. By then, my wife had already woken up, and locked herself in the bathroom. She sang songs in the shower, trying her best to mimic lyrics she didn't know. It wasn't particularly beautiful, but I loved it nonetheless.

While she got ready, I decided to take a stroll down to the lobby. I wanted to figure out what happened to the girl. Mr. Winchester stood behind the desk, smiling politely as always.

“Good morning, Mr. Henson.”

“Morning. About last night, did you find out anything about the girl?”

He nodded, still smiling. “Oh yes, she's fine. A bit shook up, naturally, but she's being dealt with.”

Before I got the chance to ask any more questions, I noticed the detective sitting down for breakfast. Thinking he could help, I decided to tell him about the situation. At the very least, he might be able to give me some insight.

He waved as he noticed me, and gestured for me to sit down.

“Thanks for handing in the paper yesterday. Whiskey and work ain't a good mix. The name's Harold Finch,” he said as he reached out to shake my hand. “Really, the guys in the precinct would have had my balls in a twist if they'd found out.”

He was still holding onto the same folder from last night. On a piece of paper that stuck out, I noticed another date from 1978. Curiosity got the better of me, and I had to ask.

“Sorry, but I noticed the date on the paper.”“The date?” he asked, seemingly confused.

“Yeah, the case is quite old. Mind me asking why it's so personal?”

“Old? I mean, it's been in the works for a year by now, but it's by no means over.”

“But... it's from 1978.”

“And, that's only a few months ago. What's the big deal?”

Speechless, I just stared at the clearly deluded man. I wanted to keep asking more, but my train of thought was quickly interrupted by Alice entering the restaurant. “There you are! Ready for breakfast?” she asked.

I left the detective alone, and told Alice what I'd found out. The weird guests, accompanied by the girl we'd found last night, had put us in an uncomfortable atmosphere. After a long discussion, we decided our best bet would be to cut the vacation short.

While Alice wasn't exactly thrilled about the decision, she reluctantly agreed after I put all the cards on the table. Whatever was going on at Hotel Skjærsilden, it had to be dangerous.

Without notifying the reception, we packed our bags and prepared to leave. On our way out the door, I glanced over at the same elderly ladies from when we arrived, still sipping tea. One of them was bleeding profusely from her eyes, nose and ears, while another had turned pale as a sheet. Yet, they kept laughing and drinking, as if nothing had happened. I blinked, and they returned back to normal.

“Did you – did you see that?” I asked Alice.

“See what?”

Fearing I was about to lose my sanity, it didn't push it any further. Instead, I just I threw my luggage into the car and tried to start it up.

Nothing... the engine simply refused to run.

Confused, I popped open the hood of the car, only to realize that the insides had been completely ravaged beyond repair. It wasn't a simple cut cable, but absolute annihilation, as if someone without the faintest knowledge about cars had smashed it with a hammer.

Nevertheless, they'd done the job, and we were stuck. Thinking someone at the hotel was the culprit, I decided to call the police. Of course, being miles away in the mountains, we didn't have a single bar of signal.

“Fuck, what the hell is going on here?” I asked, frustrated and afraid.

“Hey, let's just ask the reception to call us a mechanic or something. I'm sure they have a landline we can borrow,” Alice said calmly.

I didn't trust them, but had been left with few other options. As always, Mr. Winchester manned the desk, and he seemed overly sympathetic at our conundrum. Surprisingly shocked at what had happened, he didn't hesitate to offer a helping hand.

He let me borrow the phone, and I called for a ride out of there. Alas, due to the distance, they couldn't send anyone out for another day.

I sighed as I hung up, but my disappointment was quickly replaced by shock. There, in the lobby, sat the injured girl from the night before. She wore the same clothes, but they were cleaned up, and her face didn't have a single scratch on it.

“Is that…?”

“Ah, yes, the poor girl from yesterday. She's fine now,” Mr. Winchester said.

“But – but – she was smashed up – she was wounded – how could it -” I stuttered incomprehensibly.

I looked over at Alice, who seemed oddly nonchalant about it all.

“Should we talk to her?” Alice asked.

We walked over and sat down next to her. With her face buried in a book, she didn't even notice our presence.

“Hey,” I said softly.

“Oh, it's you!” she said with a half-smile. “I'm sorry about yesterday, I wasn't really myself.”

“I don't understand; what happened to you? How did you recover so fast?”

She pondered for a moment, as if to remember what had happened. The frightened girl we'd met last night had vanished, replaced by someone at peace with the world.

“Well, I don't remember exactly what happened. I think I was driving by the ocean, making my way back home after traveling the state. Then...I saw an animal, just standing in the road, a dog or something. I tried to swerve around it, but I somehow lost control. The car went off the road, and - and I landed in the water. It was so cold, and the car was sinking so fast. I couldn't even think.”

“How did you get out?” I asked.

She thought about the question, trying her best to figure out an appropriate answer.

“Huh, I guess I didn't...”

“But, if you didn't make it out, how are you here?”

“Because I - “

Before she could finish her sentence, we were interrupted by Mr. Winchester.

“Mr. Henson, may I have a word?” he asked, as polite as ever. He pulled me to the side, and gave me a stern look.

“Don't you think she's been through enough in the past twenty-four hours? Let's give the poor girl some space, so she can come to terms with her fate.”

“What do you mean? Come to terms with what?”

“You mean you haven't figured it out yet? Look around you, Mr. Henson. Tell me what you see.”

With these words, it felt as if a thin veil had been lifted from my eyes. I looked over at the girl, and her injuries were back. Despite her smashed in face, her broken ribs and arm, she sat calmly and read a book. I looked at another guest, dressed in a fancy, striped suit. He had a bullet hole in his head.

Then, I glanced into the restaurant, where the detective sat, still reading his ancient file. His jacket was soaking wet, dripping with blood. Yet, he didn't seem to notice.

I shook my head in despair, closing my eyes tightly. Once I opened them once more, everyone looked fine. They looked perfectly healthy, all of them, but I'd seen the truth.

“They're – they're dead.”

“They are indeed, but you don't have to say it so loud,” Mr. Winchester whispered.

“And you?”

“No, no, no. I'm not dead. I'm something different entirely, but that's not important right now. What matters is the fact that you're the first living person we've had here since... well, ever.”

I just stood there, speechless. I half-awaited a terrible punchline, but deep inside, I knew he was telling me the truth. Everyone at the hotel, had died at various points in time, but why they were trapped there, I didn't know.

“The only question is: Will you help us?” Winchester asked. “Help you how?”

“The people here, they're all stuck because they are yet to accept their own demise. For some, it's instant, but for others, it's a rough process. All we can do, is keep them comfortable here at the hotel. I'd help them all myself, but I'm bound by certain rules. What I mean to say is, that I can't contact the outside, living world. You, however, you're an anomaly.”

A thousand thoughts ran through my head. Of course, I wanted to help, but a part of me still struggled to believe, or comprehend the situation that was unfolding around me. After an uncomfortably long silence, all I could ask was: “How?”

“Just talk to them, you'll figure it out.”

So, that's what I did. I started off with the detective. I knew that whatever answers I needed would be locked away inside that folder. I couldn't straight out ask for them, so I had to resort to a more crude method.

I offered him a glass of whiskey, and engaged in small talk. Once he'd finished his drink, I offered him another, and another, and another. Before long, he started talking of his own volition, and as he excused himself to the bathroom, I took a peek at the files.

He was chasing down leads to capture a serial killer by the name of Lawrence Harrison. He was wanted for a string of murders occurring between 1975 and 1978, one of whom appeared to be the detective's partner.

Using the landline, I called back home to request any news article about the case, to be sent my way. It was an easy enough task with the connections I still had, left over from my old job.

“Mr. Winchester, how come I can't use my mobile phone?”

“Rules, Mr. Henson. You're in a different world now. The landline is the only exception. That's how we managed to procure you for this mission.”

“Procure me?”

“Not just anyone can stumble upon this place. We have a few operatives out there in the real world, always working in subtle ways. Using as little as a simple brochure, they were able to nudge you in our direction.”

“Why me?” I asked.

His smile vanished for a moment. “That's for you to discover.”

Following the quick call, it was a simple task. All I had to do was to show the detective that his never-ending case had been solved.

“So, he's dead?” the detective asked.

I nodded. “Locked up in December 1978, dead in prison by 1980. According to the news, it was a detective by name of Harold Finch that broke the case. Unfortunately, he didn't live to see the bastard face his day in court.”

“1980, but that's...” he trailed off.

I could see the realization hit him. His once stressed posture finally relaxed, and he just smiled. “I think I'll check out now.”

Next was the girl. I let Alice speak to her, using a more gentle touch. As it turned out, she'd fled home at the age of fifteen, and had since regretted her decision. She was on her way home to see her parents for the first time in five years, when her car went off the road. Though the head injury didn't kill her, she was too disoriented and hurt to get out. She drowned in the car, with no one there to save her.

All she wanted us to do, was to send a message. “I never should have left home,” she said.

“We all have to make our decisions, but your parents don't blame you for what happened. They love you, and they always will,” Alice said.

They talked for a while. Once done, the girl agreed to check out of the hotel, and move on.

There were still plenty of guests to go around. Alice and I made a great team, but to best aid their passing, we needed to ask Mr. Winchester for help.

“Do you have any advice on how to proceed? I guess you know the guests better than us,” I asked.

He nodded. “My advice is simply that you accept the truth, Mr. Henson.”

“What?”

He just looked at me, a hint of pity in his eyes. “It's time, Alex,” he said.

“No, I – I can't...” I trailed off.

I knew he was right. It was an undeniable truth I'd been denying for the past year. I looked over at Alice, her figure emaciated beyond belief, broken from the cancer that had killed her only a year ago.

“Please,” I begged.

“I think you two should talk,” Mr. Winchester said.

We returned to our room, neither of us speaking a single word on the way.

“You've held on long enough, it's time to let me go,” Alice said.

“I just, I don't know what to do without you.”

“We had a great few years together, but I don't want you to stop living just because I'm gone.”

“But, you're not gone. It has been a year since...” I trailed off. “I just don't understand why you're still here? We didn't exactly have any unfinished business.”

She shrugged. “Just because I'm dead, it doesn't make me an expert on the matter. But, there's something anchoring me to you, just like this place keeps its occupants happy while they search for answers.”

“So you could just stay with me?”

She shook her head.

“Why not?”

She smiled. “Because I already had a great life, with you.”

It was the simple truth I'd failed to accept. Despite our time together being unfairly short, it had been one filled with happiness.

“In a way, I guess this place needed me to help you accept what you truly are,” she said.

“And what's that?”

“You're special, Alex. I know you don't understand what that means yet. But in time, you will. This is where you belong, helping these people move on to the next chapter of their journey.”

“We'll see each other again?” I asked.

“Once your time comes, yes,” she responded with a smile.

Hours passed, and we went over each and every experience we'd shared. I held her, and she kissed me.

“I'm sorry about the car. I just needed you to stay,” she said. “That was you?”

She nodded.

Before long, we fell asleep in each other's arms, and that was it. I hadn't yet come to terms with her death, but I'd accepted it as a fact.

When I awoke, she was gone. There was nothing unsaid, nor any love held back between us. She'd only lingered on to help me move on.

All she'd left behind, was a note: “Help them see the light.”

The decision had already been made. With the loss of my soulmate, I'd been given a new purpose in life. That following morning, I got dressed, and entered the lobby. Mr. Winchester smiled as he saw me approach the reception desk alone.

He didn't have to say anything, I already knew what he would ask. He gave me one last chance to contact friends and family on the outside world, who will be uploading this story on my behalf. Once it was done, he asked me one, final question: 

[“Are you ready to get to work?”](https://www.richard-saxon.com/books/)
