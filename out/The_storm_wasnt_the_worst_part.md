One day, I came home after a long, exhausting day at work. All I wanted was to turn off the lights and close my eyes.  
Milo, my little white-furred dog, greeted me and licked me happily. I gave him a few treats, then collapsed onto the couch.  
I grabbed the remote, turned on the TV, and flipped to the news channel.

The forecast started off normal, until they mentioned my city.  
The anchor announced a chemical storm, the result of an explosion involving a container labeled “L-7 Black Halo" Level 5 Psychoactive Hazard.

I had no idea what that meant. But I understood one thing: no one in **Grimwood** was supposed to leave their homes. Hell, maybe we weren’t supposed to go outside at all.

They didn't talk about the material except for it's name, which was a bit suspicious. But I didn't worry. I turned off the TV. I petted Milo and went to my bedroom. Soon later, I fell asleep.

Sometime later, I woke up. No reason, no sound. Just a strange... feeling.  
A noise came from outside... distant, but growing louder. I couldn’t tell what it was... until it got closer.

It was crows. Hundreds. Screaming. I moved to the window.

The sky was filled with them, spinning in massive, coordinated circles. It made my skin crawl.  
Milo started barking louder than he ever had. I tried to calm him, but he wouldn’t stop.

Then I understood why.

One crow broke formation and flew straight toward my window, fast-too fast.

It darted toward my window like a bullet. For a split second, I saw its face... not a normal crow’s, but something twisted, almost human.

And then... CRASH. The crow landed near Milo. thick, black liquid oozed out of it... slick, foul-smelling, like burnt oil and bile rose in my throat.

My heart hammered against my ribs as I stumbled back, the rough wood floor cold beneath my feet. Milo vanished beneath the bed, trembling.

I turned on the lights. The crow was gone. But the window... was still shattered. So I wasn’t imagining things. I wasn’t crazy.

I turned the light back off and returned to bed, terrified.

The next morning, Milo licked me awake. His tail wagged like nothing had happened. I told myself it was all a weird dream, or maybe the storm was messing with my head... I decided to spend the day watching some emergency-downloaded movies with Milo. And we did.

Until something happened... that still gives me chills to this day. I heard knocking on the door.

The storm hadn’t stopped. No one should’ve been outside. I ignored it.  
But then—Another knock.

This time, I got up. The knocking had come from the front door. Then came a voice.

''**Hey!! please help me"**

I was silent. Someone out there needed my help...

**"Please... I'm begging you... my five-year-old daughter is here... and she's cold"**

That voice... it was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite place it.

**"I know you're there... Elias"**

She knew who I am... she knew where I lived... I said nothing. I didn’t have enough food for three people and a dog... but I needed to know...

“*What are you doing here? It’s too dangerou*s"

**"My house isn't built for things like this... I don't have a basement. you do, right?"**

Milo barked again just like the night before. I tried to quiet him, but then... the lights went out. everything stopped. Milo. The barking. Even the wind. Dead silence.

Then I heard a whisper.

**"Turn around"**

I froze. But I had no choice. Slowly, I turned—And I saw her.

A little girl. White hair. Fur coat. Thick black pants.  
Her face was down, hidden by her hair.

My voice trembled. “Wh-who are you?"

She looked up and smiled. A huge, *inhuman* smile. Her teeth were all black. Not stained. Black.

Then all of a sudden, Milo ran to her and bit her on the leg.

The lights flickered on. She was gone.  
And Milo gone too.. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t breathe. Everything was still. Silence swallowed the room. Then, a single bark.  
From my bedroom.

I ran. I didn’t care what waited for me. Milo needed me and I needed him. I passed the couch, ran through the hallway, reached the bedroom door. It was slightly open. I took a deep breath... and went inside. Milo was there, under the bed, shaking. I hugged him. I stroked his fur. Then...

**DRIP**

Black liquid dropped from the ceiling. My smile disappeared.

**SLAM.**

The bedroom door slammed shut behind me. And then, a gloomy voice echoed through the room, piercing my heart even now-

**"You could've open the door... Dad"**
