For my successor…

I’ll just start where it all began. When I was born, my future was already sealed. I was doomed to be hunted by Hell and everything bound to it. My brother… I remember it so clearly. He died during his first mission.
When you turn eighteen, Hell starts hunting you. Your task is to stop the demons and spirits. My brother didn’t survive. He died in a gruesome way.
And now—now it’s my duty to take revenge. I’ve only just turned seventeen. I still have 365 days to train.
So here I stand, in front of my grandfather’s door. He is the only one in our family who lived to ninety, and I have the honor of being trained by him.

I walked inside. My grandfather, named Jay, sat in his chair with a gaze of steel.
He said, “Listen, boy. Sit down. I’m going to tell you a story about my first mission.”

I sat down, realizing it was better to listen. He was old, but still incredibly strong, so I didn’t have much choice.

“When I turned eighteen,” he continued, “blood was written on my window along with coordinates. I remember it so well. But I wasn’t afraid. I was prepared for this.”

He picked up his lantern—a blue lantern covered with skulls—and showed me a book. It was an old book with Latin text:

**deorsum est sursum
mortuus est vivus
et nihil est fides**

Which translated to: *Below is above, dead is alive, and nothing is faith.*

He continued his story.

“I took the book, the lantern, and a cross. I know many in our family would’ve handled it differently—but that’s also why half of them are dead. I wish I were lying, but it’s true. Many in our family don’t survive very long.”

Jay took a deep breath and went on.

“When I had gathered my soul gear, I went to the location. It was an old, abandoned villa—massive. I went inside, and that’s where I saw it. It wore medieval knight’s armor but without a helmet. Its armor was decorated with dragons. Two wings, soaked in blood, stretched from its back.
Its face was human, but with a smile full of teeth and two completely white eyes that stared straight into my soul.

It snapped its fingers, and the room began to spin. Doors appeared everywhere—hallways stretching into infinity.
It laughed. Not a human laugh—more like a thousand people screaming at once.
It looked at me and said:

**‘This is the last house you will ever enter, young lamp-bearer. Your family is cursed. And after I tear you apart, the rest of your bloodline will follow.’**

I held my ground. I wasn’t even afraid. I knew I had to give everything.

Listen, boy—what happened next was a battle that lasted four hours. And this is how it went:

I stood face to face with a demon. A strong one. But I knew I was stronger.
The lamp I carried held more power than one boy could imagine. If you have enough faith, it can move mountains.
It took me almost the entire fight to figure that out. I tried using crosses and my book, but nothing worked.
The demon was stronger, and I was already wounded from his attacks.

I started praying to God, and I received an answer:
**‘He who believes shall cast out all evil.’**

The lamp began to glow. Without thinking, I used it to summon the sword of Michael.
You should’ve seen the demon’s face—pure rage.
I knew this wouldn’t be easy.

The demon sprinted at me with incredible speed. I was thrown through walls, landing in a room with a hole in the floor that looked like it went on forever.
If I fell, I’d die.
I looked into it—it seemed endless. It was also a gate to Hell.

The demon charged again. I dodged—barely—by a centimeter.
He turned around, and I grabbed my sword. He flew at me at high speed, and I blocked him. I managed to push him back.

He used his powers to summon a flaming sword. He attacked, but I blocked it. The impact caused a shockwave that shattered every window within 50 kilometers.
But I held on.

The demon screamed, but I didn’t stop.
He might’ve been stronger, but I was far smarter.

I jumped to the left, causing the demon to shoot past me.
I landed behind him, and in that split second, I felt something I had never felt before—a divine presence guiding me.
I went straight for the attack. In that moment, my entire life flashed before my eyes.

But just before I struck him, he turned around and grabbed me by the throat.

‘Did you really think you were faster than me?’ the demon said.

His grip tightened. Air left my lungs.
And just when everything was turning blurry, I saw someone standing there.

I focused harder.
It was a woman, holding a sword so bright it nearly blinded me.
And she did something I never expected....
