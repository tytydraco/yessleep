Hey all, my friend told me about this last night and gave me permission to post here to get some input. Here is what he has written and I will add my own thoughts at the end.

  
\~\~\~\~\~  
Me and my brother live in an older house in middle Georgia. When we moved in we had little to no issues. About 2 years in we had stuff come up. In our rooms he’d hear my voice when sometimes I wasn’t at home or in said room. And he swears on his life he heard Me. I chalked it up to him joking or being crazy. Other times We will hear what (granted, could be animal screams) or loud noises in the backyard all night, that would only stop if we opened the back door to peak out and see what was up. They sound like screams, wails, or howls. This definitely gives me chills as the sounds are piercing. I assumed it to be foxes and coyotes and other wild dogs as it’s not uncommon in Georgia. But it happening this often, this loud, and seeing no animal is definitely weird to me.  
One day, it was around 7 going to 8pm, we were in the woods looking for beetles; insects, frogs, and birds were making noises (normal forest sounds.) Then all of a sudden everything went quiet. And stayed that way, we walked around a few minutes and no sound could be heard. We kept going until we heard a stick snap around us, that freaked us out enough to send us home and not go back in there much.  
At one point we had two dead animals, a bird and a rabbit, a day apart show up at our doors. We assumed it was foxes or maybe coyotes who left them there. What was weird was the bird had no blood, there was no blood anywhere around the scene. Or in the bird. Which seemed weird to me, but may he normal. Lastly, I believe this is bugs hitting my window, but if I’m up late at night I’ll notice tapping on my window on the left side near the back door, just tapping at random occasions and intervals. But the taps are pretty hard, something that doesn’t seem like a bug would be able to produce if hitting the window.

  
Lastly, my closet. No light enters the closet. Even if I have my bedroom lights on or my LED lights the closet stays dark past the doorway. My lightbulbs in there always seem to busy or go out within a week of installation. Does anyone have any explanations? Or am I just crazy and experiencing very random and coincidental things. My best friend told me to write this so they’d post it for me after I told them about the situation. I just wanna know if I’m crazy or if something’s actually going on. Thanks for reading.

My friend also mentioned they do a lot of urbexing, and during one trip to an old hotel, his brother wandered off, only to be completely terrified by what he described as a little girl with a twisted neck who screamed at him. My friend did not hear any scream except that of his brother. A few days later, my friend was showering while home alone, the door was completely closed, and he heard it open and close a few times. Later that evening while washing up, he saw a fat man-like figure with greyish skin and ratty hair standing in the shower behind him reflected clearly in the mirror, only to turn around and see nothing. Shortly after this, the events described in the post followed. It's also worth noting that my friend and his brother were sober for all these encounters and no other mind-altering substances were being used.  
I do believe it's possible the screams could be coyotes, foxes, or even a mountain lion. Wildlife sounds will sometimes suddenly stop when a large predator is nearby, which could explain the incident in the woods where everything went silent. There are some Native American reservations in the area, and the fact that his brother has heard what appears to be something mimicking my friend's voice kinda puts me over the edge into thinking maybe it's not just a coincidence. If anyone has had a similar experience or any advice/thoughts, we'd love to hear them! TIA.
