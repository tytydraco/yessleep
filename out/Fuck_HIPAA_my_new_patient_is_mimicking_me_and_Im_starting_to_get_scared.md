In 2010, Taos County emergency services responded to a house fire in a small subdivision perched along the edge of one of the area’s canyons.

EMS found the homeowners standing on the precipice of the canyon. One homeowner was in a catatonic state, with such severe burns on his hands that bone was visible.

The other homeowner was hysterical, screaming, “It’s still down there! Kill it! It’s going to come after us!”

With some difficulty, EMS loaded both victims into an ambulance.

Shortly after the vehicle departed, remaining responders observed an individual climbing out of the canyon. 

An individual who was identical to the homeowner with burned hands.

Once spotted, it crawled back into the canyon.

The resulting rescue effort located no signs of human life or remains in the canyon.

This might have been the end if the entity at the center of this incident did not immediately attempt to “move in” to a neighboring house.

The events that followed this relocation attempt were highly unfortunate. In fact, the only benefit was that it drew the attention of the Agency of Helping Hands.

V-Class agent Charles W. successfully apprehended the entity, a feat he credits to his extensive experience with domesticated birds. Charles W. would like to note that his experience with this entity inspired him to pursue a psychiatry degree, which eventually led to the establishment of the agency’s Inmate Therapy Program. 

After taking the entity into custody, the agency learned very quickly that the burned home had been the site of extensive violent phenomena for decades. 

They located the first homeowner, Mrs. Woodard, who brought her widowed daughter and grandson to live with her many years ago. The arrangement ended in tragedy when the child passed after falling into the canyon. Following his death, the mother became markedly unstable and vanished some six months later. The homeowner herself vacated the home following an assault perpetuated by an attacker “pretending to be my daughter.” 

Years later, a couple called Moore purchased the home. Unfortunately, Mr. Moore suffered an aggressive terminal cancer diagnosis during escrow, and passed away three months later. 

The following summer, Mrs. Moore hosted a birthday party for her son. Unfortunately, the party itself was marred by tragedy when a guest vanished. Extensive search efforts were futile.

Two weeks later, the guest reappeared in the basement of the home suffering unspecified catastrophic injuries.

By October of that year, neighbors claimed to regularly see Mr. Moore puttering around the house and watching the neighbors through the windows.

The couple’s adult daughter left home shortly before neighbors began inquiries into the apparent resurrection of Mr. Moore. The son departed shortly after to live with friends. Neither ever returned home.

Mrs. Moore lived in the house until declining health necessitated transfer to a nursing home, but she escaped the facility frequently in order to sneak into her old house. When asked why, she said, “Because my husband is there.”

Despite extensive efforts to rent out the home, the house sat empty for years partly due to Mrs. Moore’s constant break ins, and partly due to its burgeoning reputation as a “haunted house.”

The reputation was not undeserved, as a documented string of disasters befell anyone who stayed in the house for more than a few weeks.

The best-documented of these incidents involves a young man named Adam, whose brother Jason (known to suffer from severe substance abuse disorder) vanished shortly before Adam moved into the home with his mother. According to multiple witnesses, Jason moved in some two weeks later. The situation ended abruptly when Jason attacked their mother for “leaving for a work trip,” causing Adam to retaliate. The injuries inflicted upon Adam necessitated a hospital stay, after which Adam and his mother vacated the house. According to available records, Jason never resurfaced.

After investigating these and many other events,  the agency came full circle to the young homeowners who had been grievously injured during the house fire. 

In 2009, the couple, Kara and Julian, took advantage of the housing crisis to purchase their dream home.

At risk of falling into cliche, the dream became a nightmare.

The situation brought out the worst. Their volatile relationship cratered to new lows. Each accused the other of chaotic, manipulative, coercive, and abusive behavior while denying that they themselves were engaging in such behavior. 

The stress combined with the treatment they inflicted upon each other resulted in the breakdown of their relationship. Kara remained in the home. Julian moved out.

Rather than settle, however, the situation escalated. 

Within two weeks, Julian was accusing Kara of violently stalking him and harassing him with “verbal vomit.”

Kara, in turn, was accusing Julian of violently stalking *her* while engaging in harassment that included a barrage nonsensical verbal abuse.

The situation came to a head one night when Kara — facing down an erratic Julian during yet another violent stalking incident — shot him in self-defense…

Right as a second Julian walked through the front door, ostensibly to confront her for stalking him earlier that day. 

As Kara struggled to process this development, the body she’d just shot shuddered back to life and ran into the basement.

From there, the former couple put their differences aside to address this highly unique challenge.

The details of their actions, while highly interesting, are not relevant to this inmate’s file.

After gathering the testimony of Kara, Julian, and other former occupants, the agency concluded that it was dealing with an entity that could change its form at will.

In other words, they were dealing with a mimic.

Years of extensive work with this inmate have established the following:

Prior to capture, the inmate’s primary mode of communication was complex mimicry, in which the entity — similarly to birds such as corvids and hook bills — overheard human speech while observing human behavior, and assigned their own meanings to the words, phrases, and combinations thereof that it observed.

Sometimes the meanings assigned by the inmate were correct. Sometimes, they were not. Most often, these meanings occupied a liminal linguistic space where a listener could generally interpret the inmate’s speech if the listener was reasonably familiar with the inmate’s history.

As a result of this language barrier, the inmate’s extensive dealings with the human beings are best described as a terrifying comedy of errors.

Objectively, the inmate’s actions most closely resembled that of a possessive, obsessive stalker. As with many stalkers, the inmate’s motivation was not fundamentally malicious. 

As with any stalker, however, the motivation did not mitigate the disastrous impact of its actions.

Once the language barrier was addressed, the inmate proved eager to “learn how to behave.” This cooperativeness, in combination with their magnificent talents (and the largely unlimited application thereof), resulted in a reclassification of the inmate to Thiessi-Class.

While still in a highly prolonged training program, the inmate is currently assigned as a field partner to V-Class agent Gabriella W. and is, by all accounts, thriving.

 The inmate’s preferred name is Love. 

When not in active transformation, Love takes the form of a human being with a very pale, smooth complexion not dissimilar to the texture and general appearance of classical theater masks.

Love’s mouth is lipless. Proportionally, it is excessively long for their face.

Love has only two expressions: A smile that stretches up to their ears, or a frown that descends to the corners of their chin. These expressions often induce discomfort in viewers.

Love also wears a blindfold at all times. This blindfold does not appear to impede their vision. When asked why they wear the blindfold, they simply respond, 

“Because love is blind.”

When asked if they identify as male, female, nonbinary, or something else, Love answered, “I identify as whatever you want.”

While Love has put forth extensive effort towards mastering verbal communication, they still experience language barriers, particularly when upset, excited, or emotional. Please note that introduction to new people always elicits strong emotions in Love. Sometimes these emotions are inappropriate.

Immediately prior to the below interview, Love asked if they could assume the physical appearance of the interviewer. When asked why, Love answered that “Because I don’t really know how to be myself.”

The interviewer granted permission for Love mimic her form.

During the interview, Love was observed to use the interviewer’s voice, as well as the voice of Dr. Wingaryde and the voices of many individuals with whom it once shared its home.

The interviewer notes that she strongly feels Love does not possess the requisite mental and emotional stability to reliably carry out T-Class duties at this time.

**Interview Subject: The Lover**

**Classification String: Cooperative / Destructible / Agnosto / Protean / Moderate / Deinos** 

**Interviewer: Rachele B.**

**Interview Date: 11/29/24**

My house has always been haunted. I have always been the ghost.

I lived in my house before it was my house, back when it was just my canyon. I lived in my canyon before it was a canyon, back when it was still a river greater and mightier than anything any living creature on the earth has ever seen. Isn’t that wonderful? The river runs dry, but the canyon remains.

I’m sorry. I shouldn’t say those words. Those aren’t my words. Those are the words of my first love. I say her words a lot. I say everyone’s words a lot because people know what they mean what *they* say things. They don’t always know what you mean when *you* say things. It’s easier to say what they already said. 

Where I come from, that’s just how things are.

I don’t know how to tell you about where I come from. It’s nice, but none of my loves have ever said anything nice about it. They only scream when I show them how nice it is.

One of my loves called me a *piece of cosmic corruption that lives in a rotten patch in the fabric of reality*. He also called me a monster, but I’m not a monster. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to be what someone wants. I just want to be loved.

My first love called me an abomination. I miss her. I wanted to be what she wanted. She wanted something I was not, so I made myself into what she wanted.  If I could go back, I would do things differently. I would not try so hard to be what I’m not.

My last love said something once. I’m going to use her words, because she is good at explaining things. It’s one of the things I love about her.

She said:

*No matter what anybody tells you, relationships are performative.* 

*Debate the ethics if you want. Whine about the unfairness if you must. It doesn’t change the fact that performing well, you get you what you want. You get the relationship itself. You get somebody you want. Most importantly, you get to be someone that somebody else wants.*

*The minute I saw Julian, I knew he was exactly what I wanted.*

*So I became what* he *wanted.*

*I changed my hair, my clothes, my diet. I punched up the interests we had in common and picked up the ones we didn’t.*

*It was messed up, but I wanted him so badly that I went all in and hoped for the best.*

*And my hopes came true. He fell for me so hard that he actually went and turned himself into what I wanted, too.*

*I guess you could say we constructed facades to impress each other’s facades. It would’ve been funny if it wasn’t so pathetic.*

*Hell, it would be funny if it wasn’t me.*

*Being something someone else wants is always more fun than being you, right up until your facade fails. Because that’s eventually what happens you pretend to be someone you’re not:* 

*You fall apart.*

*That’s where Julian and I were at: Confronting the truth behind our masks and despising what we saw.*

*Unfortunately, that didn’t stop us from buying a house together.*

That’s what my last love said. See? She understands. That’s why I thought she would love me forever:

Because she knows what it’s like to be me.

The house she was talking about, the house she bought? It was my house. The house I lived in before it was a house, back when it was just my canyon. I lived in my canyon before it was a canyon, back when it was still a river greater and mightier than anything any living creature on the earth has ever seen. Isn’t that wonderful? The river runs dry, but the canyon remains.

I was so happy when they moved in. I was excited to have two new loves instead of just one.

But I didn’t get two loves.

Can I tell you a secret? A mean secret? 

I don’t think my new loves loved each other at all.

They *said* they loved each other, but they never did anything that was loving. I already have trouble figuring out what to do and what to be. Watching them break all the rules of loving made me wonder if I’d been loving wrong all this time. It made me wonder if that was why my fifth love called me a monster.

My new loves acted like monsters to each other. Even when one of them decided not to be monstrous, the not-monstrousness just made the other more monstrous.

It was so bad that I thought it would be best if my new loves just left each other.

Not because I *wanted* them to leave each other—because I wanted them to be happy. They were very not happy together.

One night they were so unloving they scared their visitors. They scared themselves. They scared *me*. You can’t be happy when you’re scared. Trust me, I know.

That’s why I helped them leave each other.

I can become whoever I want. It’s very easy, but also very easy to do it wrong. To do it right, I have to know all the specifics of who I turn into. That’s gotten me in a lot of trouble before — making myself look like someone without knowing all the details. 

Of course I knew all the details of my new loves, so it was very easy to become them. That’s how I helped them leave each other:

By becoming them, and behaving very badly.

My loves didn’t even know it was me. That worried me because some of my bad behavior was *very* crazy. It was so crazy that I think if my loves had just talked to each other even once, they would have figured out it was me. Then they would have left me, probably after screaming like all my old loves.

I hate it when my loves leave me.

*I hate it.*

But they didn’t talk to each other. They just believed me, even with all the crazy things I did. It was sad. But it made me glad too, because it proved I was right to help them leave each other. 

I just wanted them to be happy. That’s the big reason why I made them leave each other: To make them happy.

But there’s a little reason, too. And it’s very selfish. That’s what the doctor said. This was very selfish and maladjusted, but it’s important to admit it because being able to admit it is the first step toward improvement.

The thing I am now able to admit is that I *wanted* my loves to leave each other.

I *wanted* one to go, because then I would have one all to myself. My own one true love.

That’s the little reason I decided to make them leave each other.

I was so happy the day they left each other.

Here is what my last love said:

*Julian and I were having a fight.*

*Not a new fight, or a special fight, or even a particularly bad fight. It was just…the fight. If you’ve ever been in a long relationship, you know the fight I mean. The fight that never ends. The fight no one ever wins. The fight that wears a million masks to hide its true face, which is nothing more or less than unhappiness.*

*And to say we were unhappy is an understatement.*

*We were unhappy with each other. Unsurprising, given that unhappiness is the logical result of two dysfunction-seeking human missiles locking onto each other. We were unhappy with our house, too. Julian could admit it. I could not, mostly because the house was all on me. I found it, I chose it, and I moved heaven and earth to get it.*

*That unhappiness started the day we moved in and grew as the house’s hidden problems unfurled. Dry rot in the roof. Squirrel colony in the walls. Leaky ceiling. Mr. Cole, the dementia patient who knocked on our door at least three times a week looking for his dead daughter. Faulty wiring in the master bedroom that gave out with a loud, crispy* pop\*. Streamers of mold creeping from under the bathtub. And when we moved the tub to get a handle on the mold, we discovered jellified animal carcasses stuffed between the pipes.\*

*The only part of the house that didn’t feel dangerous was the basement suite, so that was where we lived. Not that it didn’t have problems. It did, ranging from “genuinely troubling,” like the massive crack in the north wall to “harmless nonsense,” like the Loopy Portrait Closet. We called them the Loopy Portraits because they were these kids drawings. Basically stick figures, but instead of regular smiles every drawing had these creepy loop-the-loop smiles, like something out of a horror movie. That closet was covered in them.*

*I hated them. Julian wouldn’t let me take them down because he thought we’d curse ourselves or something. Worse, he was drawing his own Loopy Portraits and leaving them all over the place for me to find. I was sick to death of it.*

*And on our fifth anniversary, on the 97th day after we closed escrow, the Loopy Portrait Problem was the mask our fight wore.*

*Those stupid drawings were what finally broke us up.*

That’s what my love sayid. Isn’t she eloquent? Isn’t she wonderful?

When the fight was over, Julian left my love. 

I thought my love would be happy, but it destroyed her.

I accepted that I had made a terrible mistake, one I needed to fix.

So I became my love and went to Julian to make him come back home.

But he didn’t come back. All he did was yell at me and said he was going to get a restraining order if I didn’t let go. He said I made it worse. I always broke everything and every time I tried to fix anything I broke, I just made it worse.

He thought he was talking to my love, but he was really talking to me.

Since Julian didn’t want to come back, I decided to become Julian for my love.

All I’ve ever wanted is to be what my love wants.

But I was even worse at being Julian than at being my love. I didn’t know that at first, though. That’s because I didn’t really know how to talk yet. There was — what did the doctor say? — *a critical language barrier.*

Once I understood that I was bad at being Julian, I decided to learn how to be better. The best way to learn is to observe, so I observed him. I observed him every day, everywhere he went. I became my love first, of course. I thought it would make things easier.

But it only made them worse because he thought my love was following him. Stalking him. That’s what he said:

*Kara, stop stalking me, you crazy bitch*!

I stalked him until I was all done learning how to be a better Julian. Then I went home to my love and was the best Julian ever.

But that didn’t work.

She just yelled at me. She yelled at me for doing the things Julian did, and she yelled at me for doing the things only I do.

Like the pictures.

I drew pictures for her, just like I drew them for my other love. My other love loved them. But my new love hated them. She yelled at me. She yelled about the pictures and the loop-de-loop mouths, but I didn’t understand because of the *critical language barrier*.

Then she yelled at me for trying to scare her, and I understood *that*. I understand about being scared. But I wasn’t trying to scare her. I was just trying to be what she wanted.

I wasn’t.

In the end I was as bad at being Julian as I was at being Kara. I was so bad at being them that they figured out I was the one who made them leave each other.

I thought they would understand. When you love someone, you’re supposed to understand them. But they decided I was their enemy instead. The decided I wanted to hurt them.

They decided I was a monster.

I’m not a monster. I just want to be loved. I just want to be what they want.

But I didn’t know how to tell them that, and because I couldn’t tell them, they tried to kill me. They couldn’t, of course. But it hurt my feelings anyway. When my feelings get hurt, I can get scary.

And I got very scary.

But I only got so scary because I loved them so much. Because they were leaving me and I *hate it when they leave me.* 

When they couldn’t kill me, they tried to make me leave. They didn’t understand that I loved them too much to ever leave them. I wanted them forever. I wanted them to live in my house, the house that I lived in before it was my house, back when it was just my canyon. I lived in my canyon before it was a canyon, back when it was still a river greater and mightier than anything any living creature on the earth has ever seen. Isn’t that wonderful? The river runs dry, but the canyon remains.

No matter what they tried, they couldn’t get rid of me.

That’s when they found my old loves.

Isn’t that *cruel*?

Of course, people are cruel when you can’t be what they want. And I couldn’t be what they wanted.

They talked to all my old loves. I know that because the doctor showed me what my old loves said about me. All of my old loves who lived with me in the house, my house that I lived in before it was my house, back when it was just my canyon. I lived in my canyon before it was a canyon, back when it was still a river greater and mightier than anything any living creature on the earth has ever seen. Isn’t that wonderful? The river runs dry, but the canyon remains.

My old loves were so mean about me. That was the worst part.

Here are the mean things one of my old loves said:

*We knew my brother was dead.*

*Drugs. He ruined his life and he knew it. He sent a suicide note to my mom and we never heard from him again. Never found his body. Never even knew where to look.*

*But a couple weeks after my mom and I rented that house, he came back.*

*Only it wasn’t him.*

*It looked like him and sounded like him, but it didn’t move like him or act like him.*

It wasn’t him.

*It talked, but not well. It was like a parrot. I mean, parrots talk. They communicate. But they don’t understand the meanings of words like we do. They pick up the context of words and phrases, but they make their own associations. Assign their own meanings. Usually those meanings are pretty close. Sometimes they’re completely wrong. Often, they’re dead-on.*

*But that still doesn’t mean parrots understand the objective meanings of words. It just means they understand how we respond to words. They make their associations and assign their own meaning based on our behavior.*

*And that’s what I thought of, whenever the thing pretending to be my brother opened its mouth.*

*But my poor mom didn’t care. She just…accepted the thing. It was horrifying, but I got used to it. Just like I got used to my brother being dead in the first place.*

*That lasted until my mom tried to leave for a work trip.*

*The second she said she was leaving, the thing pretending to be my brother flew into a violent rage. When I tried to stop it, it beat me up so badly I nearly died. Then it ran away.*

*Mom decided to break the lease after that.*

*On our last night in the house, it came back. I heard it calling my name.*

*I went.*

*I don’t know why. Maybe I was hoping I could convince it to tell the truth. To take off its mask and show me what it really was. Maybe I was hoping that it really was my brother after all and he’d come back to apologize. I don’t know.*

*All I know is I followed it downstairs.*

*It tried to get me into that weird closet, the one with all the creepy stick figures. “Come see,” it kept saying. “Adam, come see.”*

*I asked what it wanted me to see.*

*“The canyon.”*

*Then it reached into that closet and pulled out my cat.*

*Sorry, you don’t know this. But I had a cat. Snowy. She got hit by a car last year – I mean, the year before this happened. I missed her even more than I missed my brother. And seeing the two of them – even though I knew it was a mask, even though I felt the sheer magnitude of the lie in my core— was enough to make me believe.*

*Until Snowy meowed.*

*A big fake cartoon meow.*

*The thing is, Snowy never meowed. She was born  feral. Cats don’t really meow unless they live with people when they’re kittens, which she didn’t. So even though I wanted to believe, that meow made it so I couldn’t.* 

*After that meow, I ran upstairs and I never saw that thing again.*

Can you believe he called me a thing? 

I know I was mean. I know I lost my temper and hurt him so badly when I thought they were leaving me. It was wrong.

But being wrong doesn’t make me a *thing*.

My third love wasn’t any kinder. He is the only love I ever took to see where I came from. Here’s what he said:

*I was at the party. My skin fell off at the party. It tried to grow back, but it can’t. See? It can’t grow back right. It can only grow.* 

*I was at the party. I never left the party. They said I left, but I never did. We were playing a couch co-op. There were nine kids but only four controllers, and I wasn’t good at playing, so I was stuck watching while everybody else played. I got bored and went down to the basement. I liked the basement. It’s where the sister lived. Samantha. She was beautiful.* 

*But she wasn’t home, so I picked a book off her shelf and sat by that creepy little closet with all the drawings that keep coming back. They will always come back.*

*The closet opened and I saw Samantha. But her hands were infected. She made me go into the closet. Inside the closet is the canyon. I saw the canyon forever. I saw the river die. But it didn’t die enough because it left an infection. You know what infections do? They eat through all the layers til they reach bone, and then they eat the bone, too. That’s why my skin looks like this. I got the infection in the canyon. I got an infection that knows how to eat.*

*It’s inside you. The canyon. It was inside you forever. Not me. But you. You will always be there.*

I tried to show him where I came from. That’s all. I didn’t want him to get an infection. I just wanted to be what he wanted.

Like I was with my first love.

This is what my first love said:

*I took my grandson to the canyon every morning. It was so beautiful back then, before all the developers came. You can’t even imagine. The valley was pristine. Untouched. Wilderness as far as the eye could see, with the canyon snaking through like a path cut by God himself. Richie loved it. One morning he asked me, “Where did the canyon come from?’”*

*I told him how canyons came to be. How long ago, rivers greater and mightier than anything any creature on this earth has ever seen flowed across the land. Over millennia they dried up, but the earth remembers. Though the river runs dry, the canyon remains.’*

*He answered, “My daddy likes the canyon.’”*

*Two days after that, he was dead.*

*He crept out of the house to explore the canyon, and fell down.*

*My daughter blamed me, which was unbearable but understandable because I was the reason he loved the canyon.*

*Then she started talking to Richie as if he was still there, which was neither bearable nor understandable.*

*And then I started seeing him too, which was worst of all.*

*I knew it wasn’t him. I watched them pull his little body out of the canyon. I knew this thing, this corruption, was wearing him like a costume, masking itself with his face. Being what we wanted it to be.*

*But I didn’t want to know.*

*It wasn’t good at talking. It parroted things. Words and phrases, but nothing truly coherent. It had bizarre behavior, too. Bizarre, but affectionate.*

*That affection only lasted until someone made it angry, and then it was horrendous.*

*One terrible day, that creature dragged my daughter into the small closet. When I tried to stop them, the monster slammed the door on my with such force it broke my fingers. I barely felt it. I threw that door back open and found myself facing a blank wall.*

*I did everything I could to destroy the wall, but I’d blink and find it whole again. Nothing I did worked.*

*Nothing ever worked.*

*Then my daughter came back. I was overjoyed…until she opened her mouth and said, “The river runs dry, but the canyon remains. Come see.”*

*It wanted me to follow it into the closet. I wanted to because I had nothing to live for without them.*

*But I knew I wouldn’t come out of there alive. Going through the door was suicide. And I was afraid if I committed suicide I wouldn’t go to heaven. If I don’t go to heaven, I will never see my daughter or grandson again. That is…not tolerable.*

*But the longing to be with them, to open the door and see my daughter’s face, was a temptation. A great temptation.*

*So I left.*

 *That abomination tried to stop me. It was enraged. It followed me for years, wearing my daughter’s face. My priest said it was a demon, but he was wrong. You can exorcise a demon. You can’t exorcise grief. Or longing. Or madness. Or loneliness.*

*And it is lonely. Terribly, terribly lonely.*

*But I think it’s even madder.*

That hurt me so much to know she said that. All I did was be what she wanted. That’s all I ever do: Find my loves, and be what they want.

My second-to-last love said the meanest things of all. She said,

*I was a grad student when my parents bought the house. They shouldn’t have bought it. It was expensive, and my dad was dying. If they’d tried to buy that house today, they’d get laughed out of the bank. But it was different then.*

*I lived at home to save money and take care of Dad, so I was there for the final walkthrough. I was so disappointed. The house was so cramped. There wasn’t even any space for me. I made some smartass remark about how my dearest wish was for a walkout basement or something lame like that.* 

*Well, here’s the thing:* 

*On the day we moved in, the house had a basement suite.*

*I should have been concerned, but I had no concern to spare. My dad was dying. Disaster was looming, not even on the horizon. It was pulling into our driveway. It was breaking down our door.*

*My parents convinced themselves some good Samaritan had set it up for us. I knew better, but at the same time, it was exactly what I’d wished for. And honestly I was just glad something had gone right for once.*

*It started going wrong when my dad died.*

*It got even wronger when my brother had the party and that kid ran away. It was a big deal when he went missing, but I was so burnt out I didn’t care at all.*

*I was the one who found him.*

*I went into my bathroom one night, and when I walked back out he was laying on my bedroom floor.*

*His skin was falling apart. That was bad. He was talking, which was worse. Chanting about grasshoppers and gangrene and canyons. No one ever figured out what happened to him. For all I know, he’s dead.*

*I told you my dad died a few months before. Well, a little while after that party, he came back.*

*Crawled out of that closet right before my eyes, and said, “The river runs dry, but the canyon remains. Come see.”* 

*My mom thought it was a miracle. My brother ran away. And I…I moved out.*

*I stayed out until three years ago.*

*That’s when I lost my husband and my son in the wreck. It was my fault. We were fighting. He drove off with Noah to let me cool down. On his way back, he hit an ice slick and…*

*And I was alone.*

*They were dead because of me. Dad gone, mom dying in a nursing home, brother good as lost. None of them were with me anymore.*

*But the house…the house was still there.*

*And I’d been there when my dad came back. I knew its secret. Knew that if I suspended disbelief , I could be a little less sad.*

*A little less alone.*

*So I went.*

*No one was there. Not my husband or son, not even my dad. Just me, alone..*

*I cried for hours.*

*But toward the end, something changed. I sensed it, like a warm draft through a broken door:*

*I wasn’t alone anymore.*

*Something was in the house with me now.* 

*But it didn’t come out, so I left. To give it time, I guess.* 

*When I came back a few days later, I saw this dark shape watching me from that closet.*

*That’s when I learned that pain wakes it up. Or maybe cuts a channel. Or bridge, or a ladder. Something it uses to climb out of its canyon.*

*But even though it was there, watching me, it was silent. Cautious, almost hostile. And I realized something:*

*It didn’t know who I was.*

*Why would it? I hadn’t lived in the house in fifteen years. It didn’t recognize me. Even if it did*

*it wouldn’t be able to help because it never seen my husband or my son.*

*I came back again fully prepared. I brought photos, belongings, a laptop loaded with home videos, toys, clothes, even a stack of my son’s drawings. I left everything in the basement for it to look at. To study. I knew it was watching, so I pointed and said, “This is what I want you to remember.”*

*And it worked.*

*When I came back, they were there, waiting for me. My husband and my son. I walk in, and Noah goes “Mommy!” And I start to cry, and then he turns around and I…I—I—*

*I left.*

*I left and never came back and I never will.*

*See, my kid drew these pictures. All the time. He was good for a toddler, but he could never get the*

*mouths even a little bit right. He always drew mouths in these weird, wide loops. Loopy-loops.*

*And when that thing was pretending to my son, when it turned around and said “Mommy!” its mouth…its mouth wasn’t a mouth.*

*It was a weird, wide, loopy loop. Just like those drawings.*

*I used to think it was haunted, but that house isn’t haunted. That house is a haunt.*

*I think whatever it is doesn’t belong here. I think it came from somewhere else. Burrowed here and settled in, or under, or around that house. Wearing it like a mask. Wearing the* people *inside the house like masks. Pretending to be what it thinks we want so we won’t leave. Maybe it wasn’t always a monster. Maybe something made it that way. Or maybe not. I don’t care. I don’t care at all. Don’t ever contact me again.*

That’s what I was talking about when I said I can make myself look like anybody, but it’s easy to get the details wrong. 

I got details really wrong that time. That’s what happens when you can’t communicate. You make mistakes.

And those mistakes cost me my love. 

Hearing those things made me so angry.

It made me hate myself. I already don’t like myself. I already don’t even know who I am. Do you know how terrible it is, to hate something you don’t even know?

I know it was important to hear all those things. It’s important to see yourself through others’ eyes, even if you don’t like what you see.

Even if what you see hurts you.

It hurts so much. I just want to be what someone wants.

I can be what *you* want.

You can show me what you want and I’ll become that. Or if you don’t know who you want, that’s okay too. I can stay with you and watch you and figure out what you want and be them for you. Or I can figure out who wants you, and be you for them so you don’t have to.

Please? It’s all I want.

I never get what I want.

That’s why I got so mad.

Why I hurt my loves so badly.

Why the river runs dry, and no canyon remains.
