The glacier lake was quiet, its dark waters still, the pine-shaded shores deserted despite the high season.

The date was 8/8. I remember because it marked an anniversary I’d been dreading the 364 days leading up to it. It was the reason I was in the remote wilderness, up a 5,000 foot mountain, with a camping permit for a single night shoved somewhere in my hastily packed rucksack. I figured heavy legs and a sore back were a fair trade to reach a place cell service couldn’t follow. I knew dozens of messages from family and near-strangers were rolling in like storm clouds.

But I didn’t want their phone calls. Their texts. 

I didn’t need more condolences.

More inescapable proof that he was gone.

What I needed that day was fresh air, and to swim in water so cold it’d make me gasp, force my heart to start pumping, and feel alive again. 

I shrugged off my rucksack and swept my eyes one more time over the wide, placid lake that should have been teeming with outdoor enthusiasts, hiking influencers, and other reality escapists like me. In the heat of summer, the lake flooded every social media feed. Topped every list and search engine. There should have been dozens of visitors. 

Yet somehow, on 8/8, it was just me. And the lake was just mine. 

That should have been a sign. Right then, all my grief-weary eyes saw was a sign of luck. *Finally*. Some true peace. 

The mournful cries of ravens bounced off the sheer granite cliffs that rose around me like cathedral walls. I gave a throaty “kraaa” in response. The first conversation I’d had all week. 

I padded across the wooden dock that jutted into the lake, stripped off my clothes, and jumped. My body broke the glass-like surface of the water, the shock of cold instantly taking my breath away. I resurfaced, pulling in harsh gulps of air, every inch of my skin stinging. 

It felt so good, I flipped over, becoming a weightless, floating thing. 

Limbs splayed out, suspended in a moment. Trying to forget the time.

The anniversary. 8/8. 

My body buoyed by the water, mind buoyed by the quiet, a realization hit me like a gut punch.

8/8. Two infinity symbols, standing upright. Daniel and me. Never-ending. 

And now nothing. 

What a cruel day to have died. 

I tilted my head back, filling my ear canals with water. Muffling the bird cries, the intrusive thoughts. The sadness that threatened to pull me down like an anchor. 

At first, it was all white noise and the steady thrum of my pulse. 

Then a guttural scream engulfed me, coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. So close I could hear sharp little pops and hisses, as though a voice was straining through a wall of bubbles, fighting for air.

In a heartbeat I was vertical, frantically treading water. Above the surface, there were no screams. I searched the surface and shoreline, thinking someone else must have arrived at the lake. But there were still no other visitors. Just me.

Wrapped in a profound hush, the kind of silence that felt alive, I was very much of the mind that something below *wasn’t*. I shivered from more than the cold. 

A deep urge overtook me, a need to hear the scream again. I plunged into the inky depths, the watery cry like a warped whale-song. The sound was chilling. Laced with terror and a primal anger. 

I stopped swimming. Partially emptied my lungs, and hovered beneath the water. 

A part of me perfectly in tune with the song.

Then a second scream exploded from the darkness, eerily in harmony with the first. A haunting duet of shrieks and bubbles. I felt them vibrate against my chest, giving me the sense that the lake itself was coughing up some kind of dark secret. 

Did I want to uncover it? It felt like a question. And to be honest, I hung there, deciding, longer than I’d admit anywhere else but here.

“Swim,” a voice in my head shouted. Daniel. “*Fast*.”

The water around me suddenly began to tremble. A rhythmic pulsing against my cold skin that told me something powerful was moving through the lake’s depths.

Headed straight for me. 

Through the gloom, two identical shapes surged toward me from below, their mirrored forms eerily human, uncannily alike, their synchronized momentum predatory and hungry. Their haunted screams intensified, sucking at the water, drawing me into their black abyss. 

I screamed, my own cry adding to the chorus. I kicked wildly, arms slicing through the cool blue, but I’d lost track of which way was up. Icy fingers clutched at my ankles. Both my arms.

Pulling me down. Simultaneously trying to rip me in two.

I thrashed like a trapped animal, sending desperate ripples through the dark water as I struggled against whatever it was dragging me deeper. Bubbles burst around me in frantic clouds as I tried to claw my way free.

“No!” I screamed again, in a final bubble-laced roar, fighting with everything I had left in me. 

All at once, the sun tore through the clouds, igniting the lake into a brilliant sapphire blaze. In that sudden clarity, I saw that I was completely alone in the water. No icy fingers wrapped around my limbs. No predators yanking me under.

I broke through the surface and drew in a long, shaky breath of air into my lungs before I started swimming. I couldn’t get out of that lake fast enough. 

Slowly, painfully, I started crawling up the pebbled shoreline. The shallow waters were still heavy, still trying to drag me down. The second my body was free of the lake, I felt a tangible release. 

I’d barely caught my breath when I saw the two cairns. Gray and black stones, pitted like bone, were stacked into two identical piles just shy of the tree line. Gravesites too fragile to last, too stubborn to disappear. 

I made myself stand. I forced myself to look. On wobbly legs and bleeding feet, I stumbled closer. My teeth chattered violently as I read the matching dates that had been scratched into each bottom stone. The date of death. 

“8/8.”

“Hey!” a man’s voice shouted behind me. It was a park ranger. An irate one. “You shouldn’t be here— don’t you know what day this is?”

“The anniversary,” I whispered.

He eyed the water warily, then me. “What, do you have a death wish or something? 8/8 stay far from the lake. Everyone knows.”

Well, I certainly knew now. “Who were they?” I asked, hugging myself tight, failing to get my body to stop trembling. I turned my back on the two cairns and faced the glacial-fed water— flat and smooth as a mirror, like the lake was watching back. 

The burly ranger raised a pair of binoculars to his tired, sunken eyes, his weather-beaten face folding with unease as he searched the shoreline. For new visitors? Or for the ones who never left . . .  “They were twin sisters,” he finally answered. “Six years ago, a storm hit, bad. Caused a flash flood. A real nasty one. One got swept away. Vanished. The other drowned looking for her.”

My knees buckled. It was an echo of my past year— Daniel vanishing. Dying. Me, feeling like I was drowning, searching for him. 

“On the anniversary, the lake is theirs,” the ranger continued, lowering his binoculars, and turning his watchful gaze back on me. “Everyone knows.”

“So you said. . .” I remarked, defensive. Confused. 

“As soon as the sun rises on 8/8, the land goes quiet. And not the peaceful kind. The air gets heavy. The trees go still. There’s a weight that settles in. Not just on the mountain. But in your bones. All of it’s just . . . *wrong*. All of it tells you to stay away. Stay gone. Everyone knows.”

“I didn’t know—”  I whispered thinly, a heartbeat away from panic.

“But every year there’s always one who makes it up to the lake. Something in the sadness of this place draws them near. The weight of it lures them in . . .” He flicked his calm eyes to my bare legs. “And the grief. . . the grief pulls you under.”

I looked down, my mouth dropped, but no scream came out. There, standing out against the goosebumps on my skin, were fingerprints, deep enough to bruise. 

I heard laughter, then. Shaky. Hysterical. The kind of sound that came only when fear and relief collided. I realized it was coming from me.

*I didn’t let the grief pull me under,* was all I could think. *The grief couldn’t pull me under*. 

“Not many can say they survived 8/8,” the ranger told me, squinting at the setting sun.

I turned away from the lake. Gathered my clothes. Shouldered my heavy rucksack. And felt light as a feather as I sprinted down the mountain, never looking back.
