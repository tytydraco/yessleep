I didn’t sleep that night. I sat in my bunk, staring at my arm, clenching and unclenching my fist, waiting for that wrongness to resurface. It never did. But I felt it.

Like someone standing just outside your vision, watching. Waiting.

By morning, I convinced myself it was exhaustion, trauma. Maybe I had hallucinated the whole thing—oxygen deprivation, nitrogen narcosis. The others were already treating me like I’d barely scraped through a ghost story.

Except for Kristen.

She was quiet at breakfast, picking at her food. When I sat down, she glanced at my arm.

“You remember anything?” she asked, voice low.

I hesitated. “Not much.”

She nodded, but I saw the tension in her shoulders. “They pulled you up with the bell. But we lost your umbilical.”

That stopped me. “What?”

“It was severed.”

I looked down at my plate, but I wasn’t seeing it. My umbilical cord—my lifeline—had been cut? That meant…

I hadn’t been connected when they brought me back.

That wasn’t possible. I should have drowned. I should have died down there.

But I didn’t.

Because something else sent me back.


That night, I dreamt of the deep.

I was sinking, the cold wrapping around me, pulling me down. My arm throbbed, the wrongness seeping deeper into my bones.

And then—

A shape in the dark.

Not a fish. Not a person. Something older.

A presence that didn’t swim—it shifted, as if the water obeyed it.

It didn’t speak with words. It didn’t need to.

The deal wasn’t a bargain. It was an exchange.

I saved you.

Its voice coiled through my skull, a whisper in my own thoughts.

Now you carry me.

I tried to scream, but my mouth filled with saltwater.

I woke up gasping, clutching my arm. My skin was cold. Wet. Like I’d just crawled out of the ocean.

I looked down.

A single droplet of black water slid from my wrist to my palm—

Then vanished.

My heart pounded.

I didn’t come back alone.

I became something else.

And whatever I brought with me—

It’s still waiting for what it’s owed.
Over the next few days, things got worse.

At first, it was just sensations—a pull in my gut when I walked past the ship’s water tanks, a shiver down my spine when I heard waves lapping against the hull. Then came the visions.

When I looked at the ocean, I didn’t just see the surface anymore. I saw depths. Shapes moving in the black. A city of impossible structures, shifting in ways that hurt to comprehend. And at its center—

A door.

Something behind it, waiting.

And I was the key.

I started hearing voices when I slept. Not just the one from before—others. Whispers carried through currents, pleading, sobbing, laughing in tones that didn’t belong to human throats.

I wasn’t just carrying something.

I was delivering something.

And it was hungry.


Then, the first accident happened.

A new diver, Lewis, went overboard during a routine equipment check. One second he was there—harness clipped, radio check clear. The next—gone. No splash. No struggle. Just... missing.

They searched for hours. No sign. No body.

That night, I dreamed of him.

He was floating in that impossible city, staring at me. His eyes were black.

You brought me here.

I woke up gasping, my arm ice-cold.

And on my wrist—a new scar. A single, curved line.

Like a tally mark.


That’s when I understood.

The deal wasn’t just about saving me.

I was its ferryman now.

And Lewis was just the first
