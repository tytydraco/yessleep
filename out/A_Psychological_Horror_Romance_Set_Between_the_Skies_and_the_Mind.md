He Misses Me: A Pilot, A Doctor, and a Forgotten Friend

A Psychological Horror Romance Set Between the Skies and the Mind

⸻

Introduction

When a retired pilot and a brilliant academic fall in love, they expect the skies to clear.
But a simple question… a strange memory… and a forgotten childhood friend begin to unravel a terrifying thread that binds them.

Some stories don’t start with fear.
Some begin with silence.
And some… never really ended.

Chapter One: Hamad and Noor

Hamad and Noor — two ambitious individuals.
Dr. Noor, quiet and studious, had spent years chasing academic excellence.
And Hamad, once a celebrated pilot, had been forced into early retirement due to a mysterious illness.
He could no longer fly. He was grounded — administratively and emotionally.

The decision devastated him.
At 45, Hamad withdrew from the world. He barely left his house.
His parents, heartbroken, made a choice: “He needs something to live for again.”

Then came Noor.

She was thirty, beautiful, with pale skin and calm, kind eyes.
When Hamad’s mother first saw her, she whispered to herself:
“Why hasn’t anyone knocked on her door yet?”

When she asked around, she discovered that Noor was focused on her PhD.
She hadn’t even thought about marriage.

But now… she was on summer break. And a meeting was arranged.

⸻

The conversation between Noor and Hamad flowed more naturally than either expected.
She was calm, simple, ambitious — and he found himself drawn to her more with each word.
And when she asked her first question, it wasn’t the usual kind.

“What’s the strangest flight you’ve ever had?”

Hamad smiled.
“I’ll never forget this one.
It wasn’t even a commercial flight.”

He leaned forward.
“I was still a trainee, flying from Andros Island in the Bahamas to Miami, Florida — through the Bermuda Triangle.”

Noor raised her brows.
“That triangle… the one with all the strange stories?”

He nodded.
“Yes. And I saw something no one recorded. No one believed me.
Only my instructor was there, but… he passed away years ago.”

Chapter Two: The Tunnel in the Sky

“The flight was supposed to take 90 minutes.
Roughly 250 miles.
But it took only 45.”

Noor leaned closer.

“As soon as I entered a strange cloud, it was like a dark vortex.
I chose to fly through it instead of around it because we were short on time.”

“The sunlight disappeared. Everything turned pitch black.
Navigation systems went haywire.
The compass spun wildly.
And then… I felt something pulling the aircraft.
Not turbulence — it was like being swallowed.”

“When I came out… we were already over Miami.
No time distortion on the instruments.
No acceleration felt.
Fuel tank nearly full.”

He paused.
“I think I passed through… something.
Electronic fog.
Or maybe time itself.”

Noor whispered:
“That’s… incredible.”

Hamad saw it in her eyes.
She didn’t just believe him.

She understood.

Chapter Three: The Breakdown

After their wedding, the couple chose a honeymoon unlike any other.
No beaches. No spas.
Instead — South Africa.

They hiked, they explored, they lived fully.

Until day four.

While crossing a suspended rope bridge, Noor suddenly stopped halfway.
Her hand gripped Hamad’s arm, eyes frozen wide.

“Take me back… I want to go back!” she screamed.

“I miss him! I MISS HIM!”

Hamad stood shocked.

Who is him?

Before he could speak, Noor collapsed in his arms, trembling, sobbing.

“Don’t let him come… he’s in the shadows…” she whispered.

And fainted.

Chapter Four: The Friend

The next morning, Noor was quiet, calm… too calm.

Hamad was not.

“We need to talk.” he said.

Noor nodded.

“I’m sorry. I should’ve told you.”

She looked down.

“When I was a child, I had no friends. I used to play alone…
Or at least, that’s what everyone thought.”

She took a breath.

“I had a friend. Imaginary, they said.
His name was Iyāl.”

Hamad froze.

“That’s… the name you tried to say on the bridge.”

She nodded.

“He was kind at first.
We’d talk, play, laugh.
But he changed.
He started whispering things… frightening things.
I saw him in my dreams… in reflections… in corners of my room.”

“Eventually, with medication and therapy, he faded.
But I never forgot his face.”

She looked at Hamad.

“Yesterday… on the bridge… I think I felt him again.
Like he never really left.”

⸻

That night, Hamad couldn’t sleep.

His wife had just told him she had a friend — one that haunted her childhood.
One that returned.

And worst of all… she didn’t seem afraid anymore.

She seemed… nostalgic.
