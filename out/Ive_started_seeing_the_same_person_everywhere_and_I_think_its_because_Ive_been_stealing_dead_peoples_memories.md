My name is Besser. I’ve always been a man of many faces, a master of disguise, and a thief with a complicated past. An ex once said my life teeters on the edge of legality. An intricate dance of survival and deceit, all wrapped around a heart of gold. Sounds about right.

I have a knack for finding trouble—or maybe trouble has a knack for finding me sometimes. It’s hard to say which came first. But on this particular night, as the rain hammered against the pavement, trouble came in the form of a cryptic text message.

The words were simple: "We have one."

I continued my journey into a dingy bodega, the kind of place that attracts both lost souls and shady late-night characters. The owner, a wiry man, cast a suspicious glance in my direction as I entered. I was used to it. We exchanged a few vague words, and I left with a pack of cigarettes, my mind elsewhere.

The rain intensified as I made my way to, of all places, the morgue. Inside the bright yellow front door, I found nobody. I sat, waited, almost finding solace in the silence of the deceased until a man beckoned me through another door. In the backroom, two strangers awaited me, their faces tinged with anticipation. The men said their names were, Dr. Ramirez and Dr. Martin. Were those their real names? Probably not.

In the middle of the room, a barber’s chair caught my attention, its many attached wires and devices a chaotic mess—or maybe a puzzle. The wires, leading behind a curtain, were arranged in a way that didn’t exactly scream FDA approval. Ramirez noticed my curiosity about what was behind the curtain and offered, “Do you want to take a look?” I grimaced instantly. “Nope, no emotional attachments. I don’t need to know anything about it.”

My attention drifted just long enough for me to mutter, “500, right?” “Yeah,” Martin replied. I pulled a dog-eared wad of cash from my coat pocket, counted it, and tossed it toward the two white coats.

In the dimly lit room, I settled into the cold, metal chair. The air had the sharp scent of formaldehyde—a chilling reminder of exactly where we were. Ramirez and Martin positioned themselves at my side, their expressions barely hiding their cautious excitement.

“This is painless, right?” I confirmed.

“The transference should be instant and mild. Maybe a light static shock,” Ramirez assured me. The machine loomed before us, a marvel of backyard scientific ingenuity. Dr. Ramirez adjusted his spectacles with trembling hands as he prepared the apparatus.

"Are you ready, Mr. Besser?" His voice quivered with a mixture of trepidation. I nodded, trying to keep my heart from thumping so loudly it would give me away.

The machine hummed to life, its mechanical screech blending with the pattering rain and the rumble of thunder outside. Electrodes were attached to my temples, sending tiny jolts of electricity through my veins. My vision blurred, and reality faded into a whirlpool of darkness.

And then, with a surge of energy, I was transported into another world. Colors exploded around me—vibrant, clear. I found myself standing in a bustling city square, neon signs casting an otherworldly glow. The memories of another person flooded my senses, a wave of emotions and experiences.

I was no longer Steve Besser, the petty thief with a troubled past. In this strange fusion of two minds, I became someone else entirely. Unfamiliar faces flickered in and out of focus, their voices fragmented whispers. But I could taste their bitterness, feel the warmth of an embrace, and smell the stench of their fear.

Through the eyes of this other person, I saw a life teeming with affluence. A large penthouse apartment on Park Avenue, packed with extravagance—extravagance now unguarded.

Then, like a bolt of lightning, I jolted back into consciousness, my body drenched in sweat. Ramirez and Martin stood over me, watching intently, their eyes somehow filled with both awe and concern. The memory transference had given me a glimpse into another person’s world.

"Everything OK?" Ramirez confirmed. I was speechless, still absorbing what had just happened, but I sat up and nodded as Martin removed the electrodes. “All that was from him?” I asked, pointing behind the curtain. Ramirez sheepishly nodded.

 “How many times have you done this… actually, don’t tell me,” I muttered as I got to my feet.

“You’ll be able to access the memories like your own, but stimuli help speed up the process. Here’s the deceased’s information. Once you’re a few blocks away, the ‘instincts’ should kick in,” Martinez instructed.

“And him?” I motioned to the body behind the curtain.

“He won’t go anywhere,” Martinez grinned.

In the heart of the affluent Park Avenue district, I approached the luxury apartment building from my visions. The fancy façade and opulent surroundings contrasted sharply with the shadows hanging over my own life. But I didn’t let that distract me. I needed to focus.

As I neared the entrance, the visions started to overlap with my own sight, swirling like a roadmap in my mind. I saw myself, dressed in a tailored suit, walking toward the doorman with an air of confidence. Mirroring the vision, I confidently said, “Grant,” as I passed the towering figure. He gave me a respectful nod, just as I expected.

With the visions guiding me, I approached the porter, my movements smooth and calculated. “Good evening, Barry,” I greeted him, echoing the memory. His eyes warmed ever so slightly, something about me triggering a vague sense of familiarity. With a curt nod, he gestured for me to continue.

I stepped into the grand lobby, my adrenaline rising with the thrill of the heist. In the elevator, I pulled out a set of lockpicks from my pocket, feeling the weight of each tool. Level 15. The vision guided me like a compass, and I marched down the hall, my instinct leading the way. When I reached the door, I manipulated the tumblers. The lock yielded with a soft click.

Once inside, my gaze swept across the lavish interior. I pulled out a handheld metal detector, a trusted companion on jobs like this. With a flick of a switch, it hummed to life, beeping faintly whenever it detected gold. Methodically, I moved through the rooms, my gloved hand plucking golden trinkets from display cases and tabletops. Each piece was swiftly stowed away in my trusty backpack.

Then, a golden family photo frame caught my eye. Handling it with care, I gently removed the photo and placed it on the desk. The frame, a valuable branded piece, found its way into my bag.

My attention was suddenly drawn to a key lying in the middle of the coffee table. It was just an ordinary old door key, but something about it demanded my attention. I picked it up, examining it closely. Aside from a red dot of nail polish, it held no real unique mystery. I placed it back on the table, as I decided I’d spent enough time in harm’s way.

But just as I prepared to make my exit, the sound of the front door knob turning sent a jolt through me. My heart skipped a beat as the door creaked open. A young woman, her expression was of total confusion, stepped into the apartment. The beam from my headlamp cast a harsh light on her as I froze, caught red-handed.

The woman froze. I, however, tried to remain composed, my mind racing to find the perfect cover. Without missing a beat, I slipped into the persona of a maintenance worker.

"Apologies for the intrusion, ma'am," I said, keeping my tone calm and authoritative. "I'm here investigating a reported power outage. Seems I've found the problem. It should be resolved shortly."

Her initial shock started to fade, my words reassuring her. She hesitated for a moment before offering a tentative smile.

"Well, thank you for taking care of it," she replied, still a bit uncertain but clearly comforted by my confidence.

"All in a day's work, ma’am," I said, making my exit before her suspicion could resurface.

Rain poured relentlessly over the streets of New York, turning the pavement into a slick, treacherous obstacle course. I stepped out of a pawn shop, navigating the narrow alleys with ease as the city’s towering skyscrapers loomed above like watchful giants.

In the heart of this soaked urban jungle, a dilapidated bar provided a much-needed refuge. The neon sign flickered weakly, casting faint light onto the wet sidewalk. I pushed open the door, entering a haze of dim lighting and the low hum of whiskey-soaked conversations. The pungent scent of stale smoke lingered in the air, exactly the kind of place I could lose myself in for a while.

Maggie, the barmaid with a knowing smile and eyes framed by smoky eyeliner, greeted me with a nod. Without a word, she poured me a whiskey, sliding the glass across the worn bar.

As the rain continued its assault outside, I found solace in Maggie's company and the Mets game playing on the TV. We talked, sharing fragments of our lives, our hopes, and the burdens we carried. My words flowed like the rain hitting the window, slowly and steadily. I confided in her about my foster father—the man who had raised me and now sat trapped in the fog of Alzheimer's. The mounting medical bills, the weight of his care, and the strain it placed on my meager earnings had driven me deeper into the perilous world of thievery.

Maggie moved gracefully down the bar, serving drinks while I let my gaze wander aimlessly until it landed on an oil painting hanging on the wall. It was an idyllic scene: a house with a bright yellow door nestled in suburbia, surrounded by perfectly manicured lawns and white picket fences. The simplicity of the image stirred something in me, a momentary break from the weight of everything on my shoulders.

I stared at the painting for a moment, letting it calm my mind, before finishing my drink and gathering my things to leave.

On my way home, I always found myself drawn to the edge of a particular pier, standing in the cold night air and gazing out across the dark water. My eyes fixated on a towering bridge in the distance, its long, arching span connecting two distant worlds on either side of the bay. For reasons I couldn’t explain, the bridge commanded my attention, its silhouette etched against the horizon like a beacon. I had no idea why I felt such a strange pull toward it, but something about it wouldn’t let me look away.

A cool breeze swept in from the water, ruffling my hair as I stood there, lost in thought. I knew I should be heading home, but I couldn’t tear my gaze from the bridge, as if it held some kind of meaning just beyond my grasp. Finally, I forced myself to turn away, that strange sense of purpose pushing me toward home.

When I arrived at my apartment, I found my foster father sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the TV. I sat down beside him, watching as his labored breaths filled the room, a painful reminder of the disease’s relentless grip. Each breath was a testament to the slow, inevitable march toward the end, and I felt the weight of it pressing down on me.

I sat there, silently, as the rain continued to pour outside, knowing there was nothing I could do to stop it.

I approached the fridge and grabbed a beer, feeling the cold bottle in my hand as I noticed the near-empty bottle of my father’s medication. I couldn't help but let out a sigh. Does it ever end?

The next few days passed with the same somber routine: tending to my foster father, watching over him as his condition worsened. The weight of responsibility pressed down on me, but I couldn’t shake it. It was my duty.

In the back of my mind, I was desperate for a way out of this life. I searched for honest work, something that would pull me out of the cycle of crime. But every door I knocked on seemed to slam in my face, my criminal record shadowing me like an unshakable curse.

I found myself in a pristine white office one afternoon, staring at the final hurdle—an interview for a decent job. A chance for a fresh start. The tension in the air was evident to all, and as the interviewer read over my résumé, I knew the question was coming. The one that always came.

"Mr. Besser, could you please explain the incident on your record?" The interviewer’s tone was polite, but I could hear the judgment in their voice. "It's a red flag for us."

I took a breath, steadying myself.

"That was a mistake," I said, my voice low and steady. "It was born out of loyalty. A friend was in trouble, and I thought I was doing the right thing. It was a bad call. But I believed in protecting the people I cared about, no matter the cost."

Silence filled the room, thick with unspoken doubts. The interviewer’s gaze wavered as if searching for a reason to believe me, but in the end, they couldn’t.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Besser," they said, their voice flat. "While we appreciate your honesty, we can't overlook the incident. We’re going to have to withdraw our offer."

The words hit me like a punch to the gut. I stood, shoulders slumped under the weight of yet another rejection, and made my way out of the office. Outside, the rain poured relentlessly, matching the sinking feeling inside me.

But I wasn’t done. Defeat wasn’t an option. Not today.

I found myself in a back alley later, the graffiti-covered walls closing in on me as I met with a dealer. The transaction was quick—a few words exchanged, a small wad of cash passed from my hand to his. In return, he gave me what I needed.

Just as I turned to leave, a group appeared at the mouth of the alley. My pulse quickened, but I didn’t break stride. I walked toward them, pretending not to care, but as I got closer, my instincts kicked in. I could sense trouble.

"Look what we got here," one of the punks sneered, stepping into my path, blocking any chance of escape. "Think you can come to our turf and score some gear?"

Panic surged through me. I tried to explain, to reason with them, but my words drowned beneath the sound of their threats. Before I knew it, fists and kicks rained down on me. I hit the ground hard, my world spinning, the drugs scattered across the slick pavement, forgotten in the chaos.

One of the goons bent down, picked up the bottle, and scoffed, “Old man shit.”

They finally strutted away, satisfied with their display, leaving me beaten and bruised on the wet asphalt. Slowly, I forced myself to my knees, then to my feet, ignoring the sharp pain coursing through my body. I scrambled to collect the scattered pills, my hands trembling. That’s when I saw it—something strange.

A key.

Sitting right there amongst the pill packets was the key from the apartment, with its unmistakable red dot of nail polish. The same key I had left behind. How the hell did it end up here? Too sore to care at that moment, I grabbed the last of the pills and left the key where it lay.

The walk home felt like it lasted forever. Limping through the dark streets, soaked and aching, I somehow made it back. I paused outside my apartment, wiped the rain from my face, and entered. Inside, my foster father sat in his usual spot, his cloudy eyes lighting up as he recognized me.

"I'm sorry, I got caught in the rain," I lied, trying to muster a smile. "But I’ve got something for you—something that'll help."

His face softened as I handed him the package. I couldn’t bear to tell him the truth, not after everything. “Your doctor said this should make things better,” I promised.

He nodded, his gratitude simple and quiet, unaware of the lengths I had gone to for him.

Later, I found myself back at Maggie's bar, staring into the depths of my whiskey glass. The choices, the failures, the endless spiral I seemed trapped in. How many more drinks would it take to numb the pain?

Just then, my phone buzzed with a message: “We have another one.”

I left the warmth of the bar, stepping back into the cold, streets. The neon lights of the city flickered on, casting a pale glow on the wet pavement. Somewhere deep inside me, a flicker of hope sparked. I wasn’t sure how or when, but I was determined to find a way to rise above this mess. To carve out something better. But for now, I had to work with what I had.

I returned to the morgue, where Ramirez and Martin awaited me. The room was still dim, cold, but familiar. I slid into the metal chair, my body tense but ready. The hum of the machine filled the silence.

"You sure you're ready for this?" Ramirez asked, adjusting his glasses.

I nodded. There wasn’t really a choice anymore.

The machine came to life, its hum growing louder. Electrodes pressed against my temples, sending that familiar jolt through my body. My vision blurred again as reality dissolved into a swirling haze.

Then, with a surge of energy, I was somewhere else. Colors burst around me, vibrant and intense, until I found myself standing in a bustling cityscape. Neon lights bathed everything in a strange, surreal glow. I wondered where I’d land this time, but soon, the vision sharpened.

I stepped out into the street, my surroundings eerily similar to what I had just seen in the transference. Plush furniture, tasteful artwork, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the skyline. Every detail lined up with the vision.

Following a trail only my subconscious seemed to know, I walked through the dark streets, guided by some unseen force. Step by step, the apartment’s layout came back to me. The streetlights cast shadows that mirrored the high-rise windows from my vision. I could feel it—this was where I needed to be.

I had no idea what awaited me inside, but I knew one thing for sure: this was far from over.

An inexplicable sense of déjà vu washed over me as I turned the corner and found myself standing before a large bridge. I stopped, the sight of it filling me with a familiar knot of anxiety. The sound of the rushing water below echoed in my ears, triggering memories I couldn’t fully grasp but felt deep in my bones. My feet felt like they were glued to the pavement, leaving me paralyzed with fear.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. My palms were slick with sweat as I gripped the cold railings for support. I knew, deep down, that I needed to cross this bridge to get to whatever lay beyond it, but something inside me hesitated. It was as if the water itself was calling out to my fear, taunting me.

I forced one foot forward, trying to block out the churning river below. The bridge creaked under the weight of my steps, and every sound sent a shiver down my spine. My throat tightened, making it hard to breathe. I glanced down at the water again—bad move. My heart raced even faster. The vast expanse of the river felt like an insurmountable obstacle, reflecting the helplessness I felt in confronting my fears.

Images flashed through my mind, quick and sharp: me, leaping into the bay. The cold, dark waters swallowing me whole. I shook my head, trying to push the thoughts aside, but they clung to me. I couldn’t afford to freeze like this. I had to cross the bridge, but every step made my legs feel heavier. Doubt gnawed at me, whispering that I wasn’t strong enough to overcome this.

In the end, the fear won out. I took a step back, retreating from the bridge. Not today. I wouldn’t reach whatever was on the other side. As I walked away, frustration and disappointment washed over me. I knew I’d have to confront this fear eventually, but today wasn’t the day.

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, its warmth coaxing me awake. I rubbed my eyes, the remnants of last night’s memories—someone else’s life—still clinging to me like a fog. As I stretched and tried to make sense of it all, something on the bedside table caught my eye.

There it was—the mysterious key. The same one I’d seen in the apartment and later in the alley, now sitting right next to my things as if it had always been there. Its surface gleamed in the soft morning light, and the small red dot of nail polish at the top confirmed my suspicion: it was the same key. I reached for it, my mind buzzing with questions. How had the key found its way here? Who had marked it with that distinctive red dot?

The memories from the last transference were still fresh, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that this key was somehow tied to everything. As I held it in my hands, I felt an odd connection to it, like it held the answer to more than just a door. But for now, I had more pressing concerns. My father’s medication—it was running out again.

I checked the countless pillboxes scattered across the kitchen counter, but almost all were empty. The anxiety I’d felt earlier on the bridge returned, this time tied to the endless struggle to afford the medication that kept my father going. I got dressed quickly, my mind a mess.

"Morning, son, sleep well?" my father greeted me with his usual smile as I stepped into the small kitchen.

"Morning," I replied, forcing a smile of my own. I didn’t want to worry him with my own problems. "I slept alright. I’ve gotta head out, but I’ll be back later, okay?"

With the prescription in hand, I left the apartment, my thoughts clouded by the need to find a solution. There was only one place I could think of—the morgue.

I knocked on the metal door, hard, and waited. Eventually, Dr. Ramirez answered.

"Is there any chance I could get another transfer today?" I asked, trying to keep the pleading edge out of my voice.

The doctor hesitated, glancing away. "We don’t have any new transferences available right now. We’re still vetting candidates."

I didn’t have time to wait. "I’ll take anything you’ve got," I said, almost begging. "I’ll make it work."

Dr. Ramirez looked at me for a long moment. Finally, he nodded. "Alright. I do have one available, but… I have to warn you, we don’t know much about this one’s memories."

I nodded. "I’ll take it."

Whatever it was, I had to believe it would help. I didn’t have the luxury of being picky.

The doctor led me to the transfer chair, and I took a seat, the cold metal beneath me already familiar. Dr. Ramirez began preparing the equipment, his hands moving methodically, but I could sense an underlying hesitation. As the transfer started, I felt myself slipping away, sinking into the depths of another consciousness.

Faces flickered in front of me—disjointed, blurry, being pulled from the recesses of a distant, half-forgotten life. A house appeared in the middle of it all. White picket fence. Clean-cut grass. It looked like something from an idyllic family sitcom. But something about it felt… wrong.

Unlike my previous transfers, this one was tainted. The memories were twisted, vibrant on the surface but threaded with an unsettling darkness beneath. A nagging unease settled deep within me, like a toxin spreading through my veins. I knew this place. I knew the people in it, but the familiarity only deepened the confusion.

I struggled to piece together the fragmented images bombarding my senses, but nothing made sense. The sensations were too real. They weren’t just echoes of another life; they were sharp, discomforting, and disturbingly wrong.

When the transfer ended, I jolted back to reality, drenched in cold sweat. My hands were trembling, my heart racing. Dr. Ramirez was watching me, confused.

“Everything alright?” he asked, his voice shaky.

I nodded, even though nothing was alright. I couldn’t find the words to explain what I had just experienced. That creeping unease clung to me.

I left the morgue, stepping back into a gray, stormy day. The sky rumbled with thunder, a perfect reflection of the turmoil brewing inside me. As I went through the motions of my daily routine, I started noticing things, small cracks in my perception.

My vision distorted at random moments, as though the world itself was warping. Once, I caught my reflection in a bodega mirror, but what stared back wasn’t fully me. It was like my face had merged with someone else’s—someone I couldn’t recognize but felt terrifyingly familiar.

The city itself began to shift around me. The shadows of people passing by seemed to dance and swirl unnaturally, their forms twisting into grotesque shapes that made my skin crawl. Sounds, too, became warped and dissonant. The constant hum of traffic, the murmur of voices—all of it assaulted my senses, sending my anxiety spiraling.

Something from that transfer was trying to reach me, to communicate in a language I didn’t understand. The memories I’d inherited—they weren’t just pieces of another life; they were secrets. Dark ones. And I couldn’t decipher them. I wasn’t sure if I was losing my mind or if these sensations were real. Every day felt like I was falling further into some kind of waking nightmare.

Then, there was the figure...
