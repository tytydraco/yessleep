In the weeks that followed, we’d found other people online in chatrooms and forums who’d made the same mistake as us. And we discovered we all had the same specific thing in common - We were all childless couples trying to get pregnant.

The events of the night played out the same for all of us, at roughly the same time, but in different neighbourhoods. 

And they all involved the same boy. The same… but different. 

It was a beautiful night on Halloween this year. The streets were packed with kids and their parents. My wife Alice and I had been trying to get pregnant for two years, joked about the different costumes we’d have our kids wear as they grew. 

We had big groups of kids and small groups. Even a few that looked like they were late teens. Lots of repeat costumes and themes. But the steady flow through our neighbourhood died by 9 o’clock. 

It started raining around 10. Alice and I were in the kitchen finishing the last of the candy when our doorbell quickly tapped three times. 

It felt strange to hear the ring so far removed from the last one. I thought it was probably a ding, dong, ditch. But then it rang again. Three quick taps. 

There were a few pieces of candy left in the bowl, none of which we wanted, so we decided to answer the door one more time and give them away. 

I answered the door with Alice to my right. Standing in front of us was a small boy in a red sweatshirt, clutching an empty Trick R Treat bag. His hood was abnormally large and pointed up to its peak. Inside of the hood… was pure darkness. 

No mask. No face. No head. Just a black abyss. 

Alice gasped and turned on the light. 

The inside of the hood lit up. The kid was wearing a thick, black stocking over his face, which blended in with the shadows from the extra large hood. 

The kid pulled the stocking off and revealed a boy about ten years old. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes were bloodshot. He looked like he’d been crying. 

But he also looked familiar. A neighbourhood kid maybe. Someone we’d seen at a grocery store with his parents or at a park. 

Alice asked if he was okay. With that, the boy burst into tears. He rushed towards Alice and hugged her waist tightly, crying into her stomach. 

We led him into the living room and I heard a strange clicking coming from the Trick R Treat bag. 

Alice got him on the couch and it took us ten minutes to calm him down before he was able to talk. He said his name was Brendan. 

Brendan claimed he’d been separated from his parents, which was his own doing. He wanted to go off and trick or trick by himself, like the big kids do. 

So at one house, Brendan went up to the door with a group of other kids while their parents waited at the sidewalk, and he snuck off around the back of the house. 

Brendan ran several blocks before slowing. He was in a new neighbourhood and collected from an entire block, when things went sour. 

A group of older boys came along, pushed him down and emptied his bag of candy. After that, Brendan was lost. He searched for his parents but couldn’t find them among the crowds. Then the crowds disappeared, and he was the only one left on the street. 

We were the first door he’d come to and he was so grateful we answered. 

Alice offered to make him hot chocolate and give him the last of our candy, but Brendan said he didn’t care much for sweets. He didn’t like candy because it would *“rot your teeth out.”* He just liked dressing up and going door to door. He’d usually give away his loot to friends at school the next day. 

The more Alice and Brendan talked, the more familiar the kid looked. But I couldn’t place him. And my eyes kept finding his Trick R Treat bag, clutched in a death grip in the boy’s right hand. 

Unfortunately, Brendan didn’t know his parents’ phone number and didn’t have it written down. When we asked him his address, he could only remember the house number.  

All we could think to do was call the police and let them know the situation. We figured his parents would have already called in anyway.

But they hadn’t. 

The Officer we spoke to said there were all kinds of calls about mischief and minor theft, but none for missing kids. We gave the Officer our contact information, and he said a patrol car would be over in the next hour. 

Brendan and Alice got really close in the following half hour. He’d completely leaned into her on the couch and she had her arm around him, stroking his head.

I remember thinking how ready Alice was to be a mom. We’d been trying for a while and I was starting to get nervous. I know Alice was too. I think that was partially why we were so overly-welcoming to Brendan.

As I stared at Brendan with his face so close to Alice’s, I realized why he looked familiar. 

Brendan looked like a perfect mix of Alice and I. 

He had my eyes and nose and her thick, dark hair and mouth. Alice and I didn’t even know each other ten years ago, but if we had and had gotten pregnant with a boy… Brendan would have looked identical. 

The phone rang. It was the police. They were pissed and acting like I’d prank called them earlier so I took it into the kitchen.

The Officer I’d spoken to said that after he’d hung up with me, he’d received multiple, identical calls from various other homes. They’d all welcomed a child in a red sweatshirt who told the same story as I did. 

I didn’t know what to say, but I was angry. I figured Brendan had gotten together with a group of buddies to prank some houses with the same outfits and stories. His name probably wasn’t even Brendan. 

But… *he did* look exactly like Alice and I… 

I’d walked to the far end of the kitchen at this point and couldn’t see into the living room. I told the cop I’d call him back and went to confront Brendan. 

But he was gone. As was Alice. 

I called out to Alice, but there was no response. The house was quiet. 

I walked into the main entrance and checked the door, which was closed and locked. There was a loud thud overhead. From where I was standing, the sound came from our bedroom. 

I rushed upstairs and turned down the hall, but stopped in my tracks. Brendan’s Trick R Treat bag was laying on the floor in the doorway to our bedroom. I picked up the bag and looked in.

The inside was smeared with red liquid and filled with what looked like those white Chicklet chewing gums. A groan came from the bedroom and I turned my attention back to it. 

I thought it was empty at first, but as I moved in, I saw someone laying on the ground behind the far side of the bed. 

It was Alice. 

She was on her stomach, face down. But there was something over her head. It was Brendan’s thick black stocking. I pulled it off of Alice and found her unconscious and with a mouth full of blood. 

I heard a floorboard creak behind me and I spun. The Trick R Treat bag, still in my hands, came loose and spilled out on the ground. 

There were dozens of bloody teeth and root endings scattered across the floor from the bag. 

And standing above me… was Brendan. Only his hood was up again. And completely black inside. 

Before I knew it, he was overtop of me and pushed his hood forward, engulfing my head.

I blacked out. When I woke up, it was because the police we’d called earlier had found Alice and I unconscious upstairs. 

Both of our mouths were filled with blood… because our teeth had been yanked out while we were unconscious. Roots, nerves and all. And they were missing. 

As was Brendan. With no sign of him ever having been there. 

The next several hours were horribly painful as we had to have emergency reconstructive surgery done. We’ve had implants put in since, which cost even more than they sound. 

All the single couples we’ve spoken to, we know they’re telling the truth about being visited by the same kid in the red sweatshirt on Halloween. 

We know, because they all have the same smiles as us.
