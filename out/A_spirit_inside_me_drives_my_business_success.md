 

I had always dreamed of starting my own business, and after years of working for someone else, I finally took the plunge and started a freelance consulting firm. I was excited to be my own boss and to have the freedom to choose my own projects and clients.

However, as the weeks went by, I found myself struggling to find enough work to keep my business afloat. I scoured the internet for networking opportunities and ways to get my name out there, but nothing seemed to be working.

One day, while browsing online, I stumbled upon a group of entrepreneurs who were hosting a networking event in my city. They met every fortnight to discuss their businesses, share tips and tricks, and make connections with other like-minded individuals.

I was hesitant at first - I had always been a bit of an introvert and the thought of walking into a room full of strangers made me nervous. But I knew that if I wanted to succeed in this business, I needed to put myself out there and take some risks.

So, I gathered my courage and attended the event. And to my surprise, it was actually really enjoyable! The other entrepreneurs were friendly and welcoming, and I even made a few connections that led to potential clients for my business.

From then on, I made a point to attend the networking events every fortnight. It was a great way to meet new people, learn from others in my industry, and most importantly, find new clients. 

As I attended more and more of these networking events, I began to notice something interesting. There were certain members of the group who were wildly successful - they had built massive businesses and seemed to be constantly in demand. Even so, they never looked down on me or made me feel inferior. They were always willing to share their knowledge and experience, and they welcomed me into the group with open arms.

As time went by, I also noticed that these successful members seemed to have a discrete inner group. They would often meet for coffee or lunch on their own, and although they never excluded me outright, I couldn't help feeling a little left out. I wondered what they were talking about and if there was something I could be doing to join their ranks.

One day, I mustered up the courage to ask Joachim, one of the successful members about it. "Hey Jo, I noticed that you and some of the other successful members often meet up outside of these events," I said. "Is there something I can do to join that inner circle?"

To my surprise, Jo chuckled and patted me on the back. "There is no inner circle," they said. "We just enjoy each other's company and have found that meeting up regularly helps us to stay motivated and on track. You're more than welcome to join us anytime."

One day, Jo, a grandfatherly man in his late sixties, invited me to a gathering on his farm. 

"It's just a casual get-together with some of the inner group," he said. "I could use a hand with something if you don't mind. Bring an extra set of clothes, just in case."

I was excited to be invited to such a special event, and I eagerly packed a bag with a change of clothes. When I arrived at the farm, Jo greeted me with a stun gun in his hand. "

As we walked, Jo explained that he was actually going to cull some meat for the gathering, and that's what he needed my help with. My stomach sank at the thought, but I knew that this was a way of life on a farm and I didn't want to be rude.

We arrived at a pen with a single pig and a few farmhands waiting for us. When we got there, the farmhands opened an enclosure in the pen and the pig walked towards what looked like a big bowl of broth, which it eagerly slurped up. Jo walked up to the pig and, with a swift motion, stunned it with the stun gun.

I watched in horror as the pig collapsed to the ground, twitching. 

The farm hands quickly cut the neck of the pig, and Jo called me over. "Come stand closer," he said. "I want to show you something."

I hesitantly approached, trying not to look at the pig's bleeding neck. Jo reached out and grabbed my arm, pulling me closer. Then, he drove his thumb into the gaping wound, motioning for me to bend down.

I closed my eyes and tried to steady my breathing as Jo marked my forehead with the dripping blood on his thumb. "This is a tradition among our inner group," he said. "It's a way of showing solidarity and loyalty. You are now an official member of our group."

I opened my eyes and looked up at Jo, unsure of what to say. I was both touched and disturbed by the ritual. On one hand, I was honored to be considered a part of this group. But on the other hand, I wasn't sure if I was ready for such a commitment.

I was in a haze for the next hour as the other guests arrived, chugging away at a few beers while the farmhands finished the slaughtering of the pig. It was then grilled on a spit over an open fire, the smell making my stomach growl despite my earlier unease.

I was barely paying attention as the other guests arrived, chugging away at a few beers as we waited for the pig to cook. Amongst the guests, I noticed an old man in ragged, downright filthy clothes. It was clear that the other guests around the open air barbecue revered and respected him, but I couldn't understand why.

As I watched the old man, he caught my eye and gave me a knowing nod. I couldn't help but feel a sense of shame wash over me - I was an outsider here, and I didn't belong.

During the following week, two members of the group called me to offer opportunities to work with the marketing departments of their companies. I was so excited and overwhelmed. Things were finally looking up.

I couldn't believe it. Just a few months ago, I had been struggling to find any work at all, and now I had two incredible opportunities right in front of me. I knew that working with these companies would be a huge step forward for my business, and I was determined to make the most of it.

Three months went by as I adjusted to my new, more successful reality, regularly meeting up with Jo and the others. Things were finally looking up for my business, and I was grateful for the opportunities that the networking group had provided me.

But one day, Jo called me up and told me that it was time for me to take the next step. My stomach churned at the thought of what could be waiting for me, as I remembered how Jo had marked me with the pig's blood. Still, I didn't want to go back to being as broke as I was before, so I gathered my courage and agreed to meet with him.

When I arrived at the designated meeting spot, which was at Brian, a group members house on the outskirts of town, Jo was already there waiting for me. As we entered the house, Jo turned to me and said "You've done well for yourself, thanks in part to the connections and opportunities we've provided you," he said. "But now it's time for you to show your commitment to the group. Are you willing to do whatever it takes to succeed?"

I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what he was asking of me. But then I remembered how far I had come, and I knew that I couldn't let my fear hold me back.

"Yes," I said firmly. "I'm willing to do whatever it takes."

Jo nodded, satisfied with my answer. "Good," he said. "Then follow me."

The basement of Brian’s house had a separate entrance along the side of the house, and we walked down a stairs and entered a door into a room that was dimly lit with candles 

The rest of the inner group was seated in a semi-circle facing an unknown old man who was dressed in the same filthy ragged clothes that I had seen him in at the pig barbeque.

"Who is that?" I asked Jo quietly.

"That's Jacob," Jo replied. "He's a very powerful man. You'll see."

I watched as Jacob began to speak, his voice low and gravelly. "You are all here because you want to be successful," he said. "And I can help you achieve that success. But it won't be easy. It will require sacrifices."

As he spoke, I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. The whole scene felt eerie and unsettling. But I was also curious, and I couldn't help wondering what kind of sacrifices Jacob was talking about.

I gasped in shock, unsure of what was happening.

Jacob looked at me directly. "Don't be frightened," he said. "This is a small sacrifice we must make to the guardian spirit of our group. By consuming the blood of those who are part of this noble group, the spirit becomes one with us and helps guide us to success."

I stared at him, wide-eyed and speechless. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This was a far cry from the casual get-together I had expected.

"Don't worry," Jacob said, sensing my discomfort. "It's just a small cut and a few drops of blood. It's a small price to pay for the blessings of the guardian spirit."

I was torn. On one hand, I wanted to succeed in my business and was willing to do whatever it took. On the other hand, the thought of making a blood sacrifice was terrifying to me.

But before I could make a decision , another member of the group I hadn't met before, stepped forward. "I'll go first," he said, offering his arm to Jacob.

I watched in horror

In the next few months, that turned to years, I began to feel a strange sense emanating from within me. It was like a voice or a presence, guiding my thoughts and actions. It told me what steps to take and what decisions to make. And as I followed its guidance, something miraculous happened - my business started to take off.

I was getting more and more clients, and my income was steadily increasing. I was making more money than I had ever made before, and it seemed like everything I touched was turning to gold.

I knew that this sense was something distinct from me, but I couldn't explain where it was coming from. All I knew was that ever since that day in Brian’s basement, I had been making better business decisions and my success had skyrocketed.
