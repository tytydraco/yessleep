This post is about a second job I took from Mr. Butler. If you want the story about my first job with Mr. Butler, you can find it here [Mr. Butler's Job: Basement to hell. : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gnvwfj/mr_butlers_job_basement_to_hell/) .

Two years ago, I took a job for a wealthy man named Mr. Butler for $100000. Turns out the job was to live in a mansion for a month with a basement that was a gateway to hell. I managed to finish the job and get the $100000. However, it left me traumatized.

I decided I would not take another job from Mr. Butler. However, a week ago he texted me with a new job offer that would pay $1 million. And he guaranteed there would be nothing supernatural about this job. I still decided not to take it.

A week later, after leaving one of my college classes, I saw Mr. Butler waiting outside.

“No”, I immediately said and walked away from him.

“$5 million”, he said.

I stopped and turned back towards him.

“What’s the job?”, I asked.

“I would like you to travel to an island off the northeast coast”, he smiled, “This specific island has a small community living there. A little girl from that island community has disappeared. I want you to find out where she is. That’s all. Nothing supernatural”.

“What’s the catch this time?”, I asked.

“No catch. Just find out where the girl is, dead or alive”.

And so I agreed to take the job. Two days later I took a flight to the island. The island had its charm. It had a small, tightknit community. Everyone knew each other. Had a local school, church etc… What stood out the most to me though was this lighthouse on its own small island. Seemed like the only way to get there was using a boat.  

I went to Clarissa’s (the missing girls) house. I lied that I was a private detective investigating her disappearance. I talked to her parents in their kitchen.

“Thank you”, Clarissa’s Mom cried, “It’s been two weeks since her disappearance. I thought the cops had given up. But I’m glad a detective is now investigating. I know she’s alive, I can feel it.”

“Just doing my job”, I replied, “Any clues to where she might have gone?”.

“I guarantee one of her classmates knows”, Clarissa’s Dad said, “Clarissa is popular and adventurous. She hung out with her classmates all the time. Something must have happened while hanging out with one of them.”

“Thank you”, I exclaimed, “Don’t want to take any more of your time. I will interview her classmates next”.

I got up from my seat and took a glance at the lighthouse from Clarissa’s parent’s kitchen window. Clarissa’s Dad saw I took a glance at it.

“It stands out doesn’t it”, he said, “You know, it’s abandoned. Some people think it’s haunted. It has a tragic past.”

“Oh, really. What’s it’s story”, I asked curiously.

“A family of three used to work and live in the lighthouse”, he explained, “A father, mother and daughter”.

“The daughter, Mikaela, had a rare condition. She couldn’t be exposed to the sun. She was super pale.”, Clarissa’s Dad continued, “The whole island was creeped out by her. Rumor is her parents abused her. She ended up killing her parents then hung herself”.

After hearing that story, I said goodbye to Clarissa’s parents and went to her school. Still impersonating a detective. I talked to all her classmates one on one but didn’t get any leads. One of her classmates, Amanada, was particularly unhelpful. She would just give one-word answers to all my questions.

“You’re wasting your time”, Clarissa’s teacher said after the interviews, “It’s unfortunate, but the girls dead. Her best friend, Amanda, seems to realize this too. She’s been quiet ever since she’s disappeared. Poor girl is obviously grieving”.

Best friend? I didn’t know Amanda was Clarissa’s best friend. Having no other leads, I decided to talk to Amanda again. As I walked out of the school, I saw Amanda sitting by herself on a swing.

“Hi Amanda”, I smiled. No reply.

“Listen, I heard that you were best friends with Clarissa”. I continued. Still no reply.

“I can help. Is there anything you can tell me?”.

Amanda started crying, “I didn’t think this would happen! We just wanted to have fun!”. I tried calming her down, “Amanda. Take a deep breath. Now tell me what happened”.

She took a few minutes to compose herself before speaking, “We snuck out at midnight and went to the abandoned lighthouse. We heard it was haunted”.

Oh God, I thought to myself, I know where this is heading.

“We took Clarissa’s father’s boat to get there. When we opened the door to the lighthouse, we were disappointed. It seemed like just any ordinary abandoned place. But then we noticed a trap door on the floor. We opened it and it led to a spiral staircase that went down to pitch darkness.”

 At that point I didn’t want to hear more. “Ok, ok. I get it. So she had an accident in the lighthouse or something. That’s all I want to know.” I now knew where Clarissa was. I therefore won Mr. Butler’s game. All he wanted to know was where Clarissa is. Her corpse is in the lighthouse. I get my $5 million as soon as I call him. I didn’t want to hear the rest of the story. I didn’t want to hear about some ghost or demon taking Clarissa or some shit.

“No!”, she cried, “You must listen to the rest of this. Although you probably won’t believe me.”

“Yeah, you’re probably right. I won’t believe you”, I said, “Best to not hear the rest of what you’re sa-“.

“Listen!”, she interrupted, “I wanted to go home at that point. I was scared. But she insisted on going down the staircase even without me. I didn’t want her to go by herself. So I came along.” I gave up at this point as I continued to listen. “When we reached the bottom of the staircase, it was pitch black. I begged Clarissa to go home at this point. But her eyes were staring, fixated on something. I followed her eyes and I saw …”, she started weeping again, “I couldn’t make it out that well. But it was a tall, skinny girl. But her face… It didn’t look human. It had this mannequin like appearance. It didn’t have any eyebrows. It scared me and Clarissa.”

“It was completely calm and expressionless. We were so scared we just stared at it for a few minutes”, she continues, “And then it started smiling. It had rows of sharp teeth and there was blood on them. We were so horrified. At that point I knew we had to go. I grabbed Clarissa, who was still startled, and ran up the stairs not daring to look back. But I could hear that woman’s footsteps coming after us. We reached the trap door. But then the girl grabbed Clarissa’s leg. Clarissa was begging me to save her. I struggled with the girl, but she was too strong. The girl managed to eventually pull Clarissa away from me and took her down the staircase. I could hear Clarissa’s screams as she was descending downstairs with the woman. I opened the trap door left the lighthouse.”

That was more information than I wanted. I just wanted the $5 million and get the hell out of this place. I believed every word she said. But I said, “Look Amanda. Your mind was probably playing tricks on you. Clarissa had an accident in the lighthouse, and she unfortunately died. It’s not your fault.”

She studied my face for a few minutes before speaking, “No, you’re lying. You 100 percent believe me. Please! You have to save her! I know I’m a coward. And…”, her lips were trembling, “And I believe she’s still alive. I’ve been having nightmares of the lighthouse. Clarissa is there begging me to save her in my dream.”

I started getting annoyed, “Then call the cops or something”.

“They wouldn’t believe me. But you … you 100 percent believe me. You know exactly what I’m talking about. I can tell. I want to save her. But I’m terrified and I’m a little girl. Please, I will go with you to save her. I just don’t want to go by myself.”

I shook my head and sternly said, “No!”.

I started walking away as she continued to cry and beg for me to help. I called Mr. Butler.

“Yes”, said Mr. Butler.

I promptly replied, “Clarissa is in the lighthouse. A tall, skinny girl with sharp teeth kidnapped her. Probably the ghost of Mikaela. Can I get my $5 million now?”.

“Just as I thought”, Mr. Butler muttered, “You will get the money sometime tomorrow”.

“You told me there would be nothing supernatural”, I said.

“And it’s true. You just needed to find out where Clarissa is. Which you did. No supernatural encounters for you at all”, he replied.

My curiosity got the better of me and I asked, “Who are you anyway? And why me? Why are you coming to me with these strange jobs”.

Mr. Butler replied, “I’m just a normal guy born into wealth and who’s incredibly bored. I’m interested in mysterious events that I suspect are related to the supernatural. Why am I hiring you? Our first job just happened by random chance. This second job is because I wondered if you would do it again. I would have picked someone else to do this job if you said no.”

“Will I see you again?”, I asked.

“Yes. Well…”, he paused for a few minutes, “Well… It depends”. And then he hung up the phone. I wondered what he meant by that. But I brushed it off and immediately bought airplane tickets to get out of this island and go back to college and my dorm. I started packing and went to bed. Next morning I went to the airport. On the flight back to Massachusetts, my mind started lingering on Amanda begging me to save Clarissa. But I tried to ignore it.

By noon I was back in my dorm. Troy, my roommate, was playing video games. His eyes fixated on the TV. Without even looking at me he said, “You’re back”. I let out a small grunt and went to my bedroom. I closed my door, dropped my suitcase and jumped on my bed. I checked my bank account on phone. The $5 million dollars was in my account. I decided to take a nap. But started tossing and turning. I still couldn’t get Amanda’s crying out of my mind. “God dammit”, I said to myself. I jumped out of bed and left my room.

“Where’re you going”, Troy asked disinterestedly. Still not looking up and glued to his game. “Airport”, I replied as I left and slammed the door. I can’t believe I’m doing this. I was cussing to myself the whole time on the flight. And a few hours later I was back at the island.

I took a boat to the lighthouse. It looked ominous as the sun was starting to set. “Fuck me”, I said to myself which felt like the one thousandth time that day I said that. I sighed and opened the lighthouse door. As Amanada said, the initial room in the lighthouse wasn’t anything special. Just an abandoned lighthouse. Co-webs, dust on furniture etc… I found the trap door on the floor. I opened it and there was the spiral staircase leading to pitch darkness. I begun my descent and eventually made it to the bottom. I couldn’t really see anything. I had no idea how big this room was. I used the flashlight on my cell phone to see what was in front of me. After a few minutes of searching I jumped as a saw a pale, expressionless, mannequin-looking face staring at me. Yeah, Amanda was right, this bitch was freaky looking as hell.

“Are you the ghost of Mikaela?”, I asked. The ghost of Mikaela just stared at me. “Where’s Clarissa? You know the girl you kidnapped”. Mikaela then started smiling with her spooky sharp teeth with blood on them.

“Fuck this.”, I said and started backing away to go back upstairs. Fuck Clarissa. She’s probably dead anyway. But then I tripped over something. It was Clarissa who was weeping. She was malnourished and terrified.

“Please”, she cried. “You have to save me”. I grabbed her and started running upstairs.

Mikaela screamed, “Noooo!!!”. And I could hear her running after us. I regretted looking back as I was running up the stairs. Mikaela was running after us on all fours. Which looked really creepy. I continued running up the stairs until I found the trap door.

I was about to open it but then Mikaela grabbed Clarissa’s legs. Clarissa was crying, begging me to help her. But Mikaela was too strong. But then I thought of something. It should be daytime now. Sunlight. The bitch doesn’t like sunlight. I opened the trap door as sunlight poured through. Mikaela screamed and immediately loosened her grasp. I grabbed Clarissa and started exiting through the trapdoor.

“Wait”, Mikaela cried, “I’m so lonely. A friend. All I ever wanted was a friend. I didn’t want to harm her. My family hated me. The town people, classmates. Everyone hated me”.

“No”, I said, “You’re a freak. You don’t deserve any friends.” And slammed the trapdoor on her face.

“Thank you”, Clarissa cried. “Thank you.” She said that hundreds of times as I took her back home by boat. I watched in the distance as Clarissa reunited with her parents. I felt so cool. Like a hero to be honest.

So there you have it. That was my second job with Mr. Butler. I did a bit more than I needed to do. I invested most of the $5 million in the stock market. I wonder if Mr. Butler will contact me again?
