*“Tom! Wake up! Wake up!”*

I jolted upright, gasping, the door still half-open in my mind—only to see my wife’s terrified face as she shook me awake.

I blinked, disoriented, realizing I was still in bed. But Cathy’s voice was sharp, panicked.

*“Tom, get up! The kids—I can’t find them! They’re gone!*” she cried, clutching my shoulders.

*“What?”* I mumbled, still trying to snap out of the fog.

*“George and Justine—they’re not in their beds!”* she said, practically dragging me out of bed.

*“Check the rooms again—then search the garden outside as well!”* I shouted, already out of bed and moving fast, not bothering to look back.

I knew exactly where I needed to search first—but I didn’t want Cathy following me.

I quickly climbed the stairs, not knowing what I would find. Everything was still a blur, and I was beginning to question my own sanity.

When I reached the top of the stairs, everything was just as I had seen it the first time—the doors were locked tight, and the little ivory chest sat there, closed, with no key inside.

I almost threw myself at the door, ready to break it down—but then Cathy’s voice called from the outside, stopping me in my tracks.

*“Tom!”* Cathy’s voice rang out, louder this time, cutting through everything. *“Out here! I found them!”*

I spun and bolted down the stairs, heart pounding.

Outside, Cathy was running ahead, breathless, pointing toward the meadow behind the mansion.

*“There!”* she cried.

I followed her gaze—and there, across the grass, sat a small figure.

Without thinking, I sprinted toward the meadow, dread pressing down with every step.

It was George—seated on the ground, holding Justine close, her head resting on his shoulder, fast asleep.

It was clear as day to me that he had been watching over his sister all along.

But Cathy, still shaken, was livid.

*“George! Do you have any idea how scared we were?”* she scolded him, her voice trembling as she gently lifted Justine from his arms.

*“She’s safe mom,”* George muttered quietly, eyes still downcast.

Cathy cradled Justine close and shot me a look. *“Let’s get back inside. Now!”*

She turned back toward the house, but I stayed, unable to tear my eyes from George.

Several questions swarmed in my mind. Did he feel it too—the whispers, the strange dreams, the noises in the dark? And why this meadow, of all places? Why not come to us?

Before I could speak, George slowly stood, brushing the grass from his hands.

*“She told me to come here, Dad,”* he said softly. *“She said we’d be safe here.”*

*“Who told you?”* I asked.

*“Charlotte,”* he replied.

My stomach dropped.

*“Charlotte… you mean your friend?”* I asked, my voice low, barely hiding my disbelief. *“She lives here?”*

George nodded his head in a matter of fact manner, *“She says she lives there… with her friends,”* he said, pointing toward the cluster of trees at the edge of the mansion.

I told George to hurry back inside while I headed for the trees alone.

When I stepped beneath the thick canopy, my heart started to race again as I found myself standing in the middle of a graveyard—  with rows of crooked, weathered tombstones stretching in every direction. There were atleast 50 of them.

I stepped closer to one of the tombstones, dread coiling tighter with every step. I brushed the dirt from it and froze.

It belonged to a child.

Then another. And another.

Pretty soon I realized every headstone bore a child’s name—each with the same date of death.

I felt the weight of it sink in, cold and suffocating.

The longer I lingered, the heavier it felt—like the weight of unseen eyes pressing in from every direction.

I could almost feel them staring, like I had trespassed on their personal space. My skin crawled; the back of my neck prickled and the hair on my arms stood on end.

I turned at once and hurried back to the mansion, my mind blank, my thoughts spinning.

The moment I stepped inside, the world suddenly seemed untouched by what I had just seen.

Justine was fast asleep in her crib, Cathy was in the kitchen, humming faintly as she stirred a pot, while George sat in his room calmly sketching his coloring book, acting as if nothing had happened.

He had always been a strange kid—quiet; content to be by himself, not easily rattled. It wasn’t that he was pretending to be brave. He was simply made that way. And that made him more accepting of the world around him, even if it didn’t always make sense.

*“Tell me more about your friend Charlotte, George,”* I said, sitting next to him on his bed.

George quietly closed his coloring book, walked to his cupboard, and pulled something from beneath the loose floorboard—an old, worn photo frame holding a yellowed photograph.

It was a group photo—rows of children, some as young as six, others in their teens, all dressed in old-fashioned clothes, posing stiffly for the camera.

*“Macey’s Orphanage,”* the faded letters at the bottom read, along with the year—**1946.**

In the center sat a middle-aged man with a thick handlebar mustache, staring solemnly ahead, hands resting on a cane.

George held the photo out toward me, his small finger hovering over a girl in the front row—around six or seven—her hair neatly parted, wearing a plain dress.

Her eyes locked straight onto the camera—unblinking, cold, almost… piercing.

Even in the faded photo, her stare seemed to reach right through the paper.

*“That’s her, Dad,”* George said softly. *“Charlotte.”*

I swallowed hard, not sure how to react.

For starters, my kid had apparently made friends with a ghost—and he was being oddly calm about it. All this while, here I was thinking she was probably his crush from school.

A ghost— and if I was hearing this right—who had been giving him *survival tips* in this even more strange and terrifying mansion.

Somewhere in the back of my mind, a thought popped up:  
*Well… I guess having useful connections around here isn’t the worst thing… yet.*

But before I could process it all, George casually pointed to the empty chair just a few feet away.

*“She’s right there,”* he said, flashing an innocent smile—almost happy as if Charlotte was about to make another friend.

But my panic only spiked.

Here I was, trying to have a serious heart-to-heart moment between father and son… while a ghost sat right there listening in, mere inches away and then I noticed something that made my skin crawl.

George’s tooth.

The one that had fallen out last night… was back. Perfectly in place. As if it had never fallen out at all.

“George… that tooth of yours—the one we buried last night… you remember, don’t you?” I muttered, trying to keep my voice steady, even as my mind reeled.

George’s tongue instinctively poked at the spot, searching for the gap. Then he touched the tooth with his own finger—realization slowly dawning on him for the first time.

I watched, almost in slow motion, as his innocent smile faded—replaced instead by confusion… and, for the first time, registering a flicker of fear.

Then, suddenly, a sharp cry rang out from the kitchen.

I bolted toward it,  and found Cathy stood frozen near the counter, her face drained of color, eyes locked on the blender.

Inside, swirling among crushed tomatoes… were teeth. Dozens of them. Old, new—tiny and large— all floating together in the thick red pulp.

She let out a strangled gasp as she hugged me, I couldn’t even find my voice.

George quietly held my hand and when I looked down at him, his attention was elsewhere, his hand pointing at a wall close to the kitchen window.

My blood ran cold as I saw Charlotte for the first time—not in flesh or spirit, but as a dark shadow cast against the wall by the morning sun filtering through the curtains, revealing a small girl cupping both hands to her mouth, silently giggling away with unrestrained glee.

I stood there, staring in open-mouthed horror—too slow to react—as Cathy turned to see what had caught my gaze.

One glance was all it took.

Her knees buckled as she collapsed unconscious into my arms.

I quickly carried her back to the hall and eased her into a chair, while George hurried over with a glass of water.

I sprinkled some on her face, and slowly, she began to stir.

I stole a quick glance back toward the kitchen—just to be sure—but the shadow was gone.

Justine thankfully remained fast asleep in her crib, blissfully unaware of the chaos.

George quietly sat beside us, giving me a small, knowing nod—his silent way of confirming Charlotte was no longer in our midst.

Cathy, then suddenly jolted awake looking around frantically

*“Tom… what—what’s happening? What did I see? What is going on here?*

I gently held her shoulders, steadying her as she tried to sit up.

*“Listen, honey… I don’t know exactly,”* I admitted, keeping my voice low but firm. *“But you’re right—this place isn’t right. I’ve felt it too. Something’s going on here… and whatever it is, it’s not safe.”*

Her face went pale. Before she could spiral again, I cupped her face with my palms.

*“Look at me,”* I said, calm but firm. *“We’re not staying here. We’re leaving. Today. I don’t care what it takes—I’m not letting anything happen to you or the kids. Okay?”*

Cathy gave a shaky nod, clinging to my every word.

Without wasting another second, I grabbed my phone, scrolled to the emergency number the agency had provided—strictly for dire situations—and hit call.

The line picked up on the first ring, but there was only silence on the other end.

*“This is Tom,”* I said, my voice steady. *“We’re done here. We’re leaving today.”*

The line paused for a second before going dead. Then a few seconds later, I received a text on my phone.

*“Your replacement arrives at 7 PM. Be packed and ready. You’ll leave with the car on its return trip.”*

I won’t lie—I let out a huge sigh of relief. I had expected resistance, maybe some vague threats or pushback from the agency. But none came. Part of me wondered if they had been expecting this call all along.

I turned to Cathy and gave her a small nod. A flicker of relief crossed her face and we immediately got to work—packing our things in hurried silence, stuffing bags with whatever we could grab. Neither of us said it aloud, but we both knew:

We just needed to make it to seven o’clock.

Just to be safe, we moved Justine’s crib into our room, and even George quietly climbed into our bed without protest.

Cathy and I sat together in silence, watching, waiting.

Eventually, her eyes fluttered shut. She eased down beside the kids and drifted off to sleep.

I remained in the chair, determined to keep watch. But time dragged—each minute stretching endlessly. The more I stared at the clock, the slower it seemed to move. My eyes grew heavier, my head starting to droop.

Before I knew it, I had fallen asleep.
