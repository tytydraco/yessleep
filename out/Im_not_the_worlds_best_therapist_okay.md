But I’ve found my niche. The average person is uncomfortable with death, but not me. I can talk about it all day, keeping my head at the right tilt, the proper amount of frown on my face. There’s an art to finding the right amount of nodding to signal that you understand, but not so much so that you appear to agree with their grief laden thoughts. I hit up support groups, hospitals, hell, I’d go to the morgue if they let me. It’s a grim business, but they’re just my kind of clientele. 

Tom was like any other parent experiencing their worst nightmare; outliving his children after a terrible accident. He was referred by a friend of a friend who thought he might need a safe space to land, aka my cheap ass sofa and box of bargain tissues. I listened to him drone on about the usual surface level shit for a few sessions - his heart hurts, he’s so sad - before I finally got him to get to the good stuff. 

“I know this is hard, but hard is the way through.” - I said, dutifully reciting therapist babble. 

“If you’re sure… I trust you.” - Tom sniffled. 

*Jackpot.*

I smiled empathetically, keeping the glimmer out of my eye, and slid the tissues and bottled water closer to him. 

“I’m sure. Sharing your pain makes it easier to carry. Let me hold some of these feelings with you.” I said, another cliche I’ve said countless times. 

Tom takes a swig of water before he describes the accident; a horrible, unexpected fire that took away everything - his wife, kids, house, his whole life. How he almost didn’t make it out when the roof collapsed. 

“…and I just lay there, thinking ‘I could let go and be with them. I don’t have to crawl out of here.’” Tom says, tears brimming his eye lashes, gulping water after talking for 10 minutes straight. 

I resist the urge to roll my eyes. 

“That is heavy… let me ask you, why?” 

“Why what?” He grabs a tissue and dutifully dots at his eyes. 

“Why did you get up?” I ask, putting on my trademark frown. 

“I don’t… what?” He falters.

I stifle a sigh.

“Why get up? Why not just lay there and die like you should have?” I ask, more poignantly. 

“Oh… I don’t know… I guess it was just survival kicking in maybe…” The words come out but he’s not convinced, eyes half glazed.

“Do you think it was a mistake?”

“What was a mistake?” 

“You surviving.” I say, my eyes staring into his big brown ones, so wide and confused. 

“I - why?” He asks, glancing around the room as if he can’t decide if this is real.

“I mean… it’s not like you got a lot going for you Tim.” 

“I - it’s Tom.” He corrects me.

“Sure. Look, you don’t have your house. You’ve already blown through your life insurance. Genies cheating on you, what’s the point?” 

“Genies what?! Ho-ow doo” he slurs

“Ladies talk at book club. Listen, your life is meaningless. You know it, I know it, your girlfriend out there banging other dudes knows it.” I lean forward, ready to cut the shit. The hour is almost up, after all. 

Tom’s eyes fill with tears, his lip trembles.

“You’re right.” 

I smile, carefully laying the gun on the chipping coffee table. “You know what to do. You always have.” 

Thank god this office is in a bad part of town, or that gunshot may have interested the neighbors. 

It’s not honest work, but it’s mine, I sigh, looking at Tom’s sad body on the carpet. I grab the phony diplomas from the wall along with the drugged up water bottle and shove them in my bag, throwing the suicide note on the table and making my way out. 

It took longer than normal to find one this time and I am ready for a new place to sink my teeth into. I never worry about someone coming after me, after all, Tom doesn’t have anyone but his mistress left, and she’ll be too happy about the surprise large life insurance payout to worry about it too much. By the time they figure out she had nothing to do with it, I’ll be a few names away. 

Don’t feel too bad for Tom. He knew the risk when he lit that fire that night. Sure, he just wanted to be rids of his kids and wife, the idiot just happened to miscalculate the amount of gas and barely got out in time. His mistress Genie told me everything in that stupid excuse-to-get-wine-wasted-book-club, bragging about finally having him all to herself. Barf. She wasn’t cheating though, and I do feel a bit bad about that lie. I’ll make sure to anonymously send her a few bottles of wine as condolences, a secret apology.

It feels good to finally tell the truth, in this business of lies, even if it is just into the internet void. It can take me weeks to get to these shit heaps, and months before I can get them in the right headspace to pull the trigger, or take the pills, or yada yada. It feels good to share my accomplishment, even if no one ever reads this. 

But if you do happen upon it, don’t forget about people like me. Those who are watching, waiting for you to think you’ve gotten away with it.
