&#x200B;

I sat there, transfixed by the smell and sound of the atlantic as i prepared to hit the on switch, the generator cugged outside and the hurricane lantern burned on the windowsill as the winds outside tried to give my handiwork a run for it's money, i checked the charge on my satphone one last time and flipped the switch on the radio, hoping it wouldn't choose tonight to blow up.

&#x200B;

In this little house high above the sea, i almost felt like a lighthouse keeper, i ought to do some explaining though as to how i got here.

&#x200B;

7 years prior i'd fufilled a childhood dream, i got my ham radio licence, now i could talk to people from far away lands, riding out the airwaves and creeping myself out with number stations, visions of late nights of stretching my voice the world over filled my mind.

&#x200B;

Except, it never happened, life got in the way, the equipment packed into a box in the back of a cupboard, adulthood loomed on the horizon and soon i moved out, never being able to afford a place where you could put an aerial up, like many young people i joined a sail training club, but with a mission, i soon was indentured for adventure and with a perfect route, an overnight stop at the blasket isles, west of ireland.

&#x200B;

Before leaving i dug my old equipment out, finding that it made static, i packed up and left.

&#x200B;

5 days later i was feeling much like jim hawkins as the isles came into view, i told my mates of my plan as we moored, and i prepared to disembark, that night i left one of the most beautiful ships i'd ever sailed on, working with one of my shipmates to get everything in order for the DXpedition, borrowing a generator, a satalite phone and an old fashioned kerosene lantern all from the ships stores.

&#x200B;

I chose the small house to setup in, and the rest was history, as the radio buzzed to life before me, i took the frequency dial and started tuning up and down, to and fro, across the shortwave band, the next 5 hours was a blast, a cold blast at that, as i logged my contacts with people all over the world who were glad to have made contact with the only ham on these islands, i decided to devote the last few hours to some listening around.

&#x200B;

The number stations just differently in this enviroment, the wind screamed through the aerial wires and stars sat above as a robotic voice read off numbers, i heard the voices of sailors, of pilots, and famous creepy sounds like the buzzer, meanwhile, american shortwave broadcasts faded in and out as they rode the ionosphere, an american preaching 'repent i tell you, repent!' before it faded into a cascade of noise.

&#x200B;

I continued tuning, and that's when a word hit my ears, a word i never thought i would hear, a word i never wanted to hear, it was 1 AM in the morning, i know because i had to look at the time.

&#x200B;

Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! the voice screeched, i stopped dead, recalling the training i'd received as to this situation, i noted the time, the frequency, and took up the microphone to speak with the other station.

&#x200B;

'This is amateur radio station \[unintelligable\] operating from the blasket isles, what is the nature of your emergency'

&#x200B;

'Oh thank goodness thank goodness! it killed our radioman' the voice called 'I've been trying to reach the coastguard for half an hour!'

&#x200B;

'Please state the matter and your position immediately' i called, not wanting to waste any time

&#x200B;

'This is the sailing ship \[REDACTED\] and we're under attack from something, like, like a big octopus! our position is' and then a position just off the west coast of ireland.

&#x200B;

No wonder the signal was clear, i stared out with my binoculars, able to sight a pins prick of light just northerly from due west.

&#x200B;

That's when the radio lit up

&#x200B;

'Wait wait! i see a little light to the east! what is that?'

&#x200B;

'That's me' i said, confidently 'Sail here and i'll call the coastguard'

&#x200B;

'Thank you thank you!' the mystery voice said

&#x200B;

'Stay on this frequency, i'm leaving the radio to call the CG and watch your boat' i called out

&#x200B;

I watched the lights changed as the small boat turned around, making full headway towards me, i stepped outside, satalite phone in hand, ready to see the arrival of the boat and also the call the coastguard.

&#x200B;

I watched through binoculars as i talked to the coastguard through a satalite, i gave them the coordinates, the gridsquare, and all i had to do was wait, but that's when it hit me, like a ton of bricks, like a ton of salt spray, not as if i was covered.

&#x200B;

The bonnie tallship was gone, the hawser cut and frayed was all i could see as i looked down the tall cliff, there was no sign of the ship.

&#x200B;

As the boat drew closer, i watched through binoculars, tattered fore and aft sails and hanging shrouds came into view, and i realized, this was our ship, and she wasn't healthy, as she moored once again, the crew jumped off, thankful to be alive, we gathered around the glowing radio as we talked over what happened.

&#x200B;

According to the man on night watch, around 9 PM something violently yanked at the ship, a huge octopus like tentacle wrapped around the ship and dragged it out to sea, the ships radio officer was never able to get to his cabin soon enough, and he fell into the sea as the creature listed the ship and it almost capsized, the crew sat in terror for 3 whole hours as the creature tried again and again to drag the ship down, large octopus tentacles smashed against the deck, and then nothing, the man who assisted me in getting my equipment on the island was the man who made a run for the radio room.

&#x200B;

I thought i recognized the voice, over radio, things seem different, everyone sounds almost the same, we'd been discussing, as he helped me rig my aerial, what the correct procedure for an emergency is, in the end, that saved our ship.

&#x200B;

The coastguard soon came, and we gave an account, they weren't happy the emergency was over, but i was heralded for my brevity.

&#x200B;

We did the rest of our voyage without a hitch, our ship jury rigged, the coastguard put the incident down as a piracy attempt, a load of rubbish, pirates don't sail these waters, the guy who called the mayday soon got his licence and we kept in contact for a while, remembering the time i saved us all from a cryptid, something far beyond the realm of science, something that tells me why the blasket islands were abandoned in 1954.
