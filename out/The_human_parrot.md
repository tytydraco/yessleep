I remember back in high school we had a school janitor named Justin who was known not just for keeping the hallways spotless, but for his uncanny ability to imitate any sound he hears. Whether it's the screech of a marker on a whiteboard, the creak of the old gym door, or the exact tone of the principalâ€™s morning announcements, Justin can mimic it perfectly. They call him the human parrot.

One afternoon Justin found himself in a standoff with a stray cat. The cat all puffed up and hissing let out a sharp angry meow. Justin crouched down and responded with a perfect imitation and was just as feisty. The cat growled louder, Justin growled back. The cat stormed off leaving Justin victorious and grinning and dancing with a broom.

Everybody laughed. He looked at everybody and smiled back. But then he stopped looking around and focused on me. He smiled sweetly at me, I smiled back.

There was a graded performance where we have to recite lines from any famous literature. I chose Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe.

"I was a child and she was a child, In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love, I and my Annabel Lee. With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven coveted her and me."

After the class I saw Justin standing just next to my locker. His body was facing my locker but his head turned to me, like he's caught trying to steal something inside. He smiled, and I don't know why I watched him just smiling at me.

He opened his mouth "I was a child ..." My stomach turned. He was imitating my voice. The way I recited the poem, even the shyness of my voice, he did it with perfection. He added a mocking giggly laugh. I turned away and tried not to look at him forever. This guy, he's nuts.

There was one time I went to the toilet to pee. When I got out Justin was sitting on the floor. The mop was just lying carelessly on the floor and he was looking down blankly. I walked pass him and tried to avoid him. What the hell is he doing near the bathroom lying on the floor and not doing his job? Does he have a personal problem? Or is he just that weird?

And then I heard something, a peeing sound. But no one was there except me, no one was peeing now. It was coming from Justin. He even imitated my peeing sound. This sick mf I'm gonna tell everyone about this!!

I finally made it home, my mind still uneasy from the strange encounter. I already told one of our teachers about his strange behavior and they talked to him about it. I wish they fired him.

I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just a weird habit of Justin and nothing more. After dinner I went to my room, climbed into bed, and pulled the covers up to my chin. Just as I start to relax, a soft bark echoed from under my bed. I looked slowly and closely.

I don't have a dog. It was Justin, hiding under my bed.
