I figured it’s finally time to share something that’s been bothering me for years. I don’t know what to call it exactly. It’s not a haunting, not really a cryptid thing. I guess it falls under weird rural stuff. You can decide for yourself.

 

Back in March 2022, my dad lost his job. He worked for a manufacturing company outside of Cincinnati, and after the layoffs hit, we couldn’t afford to stay in our place in the suburbs. My mom passed a few years ago, so it’s just been me and him. Money got tight fast, and before I knew it, he was talking about “starting over somewhere quieter.”

 

He found a job doing accounting for some local co-op way out in eastern Kentucky. I won’t say the exact town, but it’s small. Real small. We moved into this old white farmhouse with peeling paint and a wraparound porch. The backyard goes way, way back into the woods. Like acres of trees with no fences, no trail markers—nothing. Just dense, knotty forest.

 

I was 17, and I did’t exactly blend in there. The high school has less than 200 students. Everyone knows everyone, and they can sniff out a “city girl” like me in two seconds. No Starbucks, no Uber, and the internet cuts out whenever it rains. I started spending a lot of time in my room, trying to make the best of it.

 

Anyway, the weird stuff started happening maybe six weeks after we moved in.

 

It was late June. I woke up around 2am, not for any particular reason. No bad dream or noise. I just kind of opened my eyes and lay there, staring out my window. My room faces the back yard, and there’s no streetlights or anything, so it’s pitch black most nights unless there’s a good moon.

 

That night was one of those weirdly still nights. No bugs, no wind, just dead quiet. And then I heard it: bells.

 

Not like church bells or wind chimes. Not a single cat bell, either. It was… layered? Like a group of small handbells being rung at once. Tinkling and discordant, almost musical but not quite. I thought I imagined it at first, but it came again about thirty seconds later. Soft, distant, and echoey, like it was coming from deep in the woods.

 

It was subtle, but eerie. Just a few seconds of delicate jingling, then silence. It kept happening randomly until the sky started to lighten up with dawn. I barely slept.

 

The next morning I told my dad. He laughed and said it was probably a stray cat or some birds. I told him it wasn’t a bell on a collar—it was a group of bells. He shrugged it off and went to work. I let it go for the moment, but I started keeping track after that.

 

I heard the bells again a few nights later. Same time—around 2am. Same pattern: short bursts every now and then, always from the woods. I tried recording it, but they were too faint for my phone mic to pick up. One night I left the window cracked to try to hear better. That made it worse. I couldn’t sleep with that weird sound drifting in and out of the darkness.

 

About a week later, I woke up and came downstairs to find my dad looking really tired. He said he’d stayed up working on tax stuff for the co-op and hadn’t gone to bed until 4. I asked if he’d heard anything.

 

He didn’t say anything right away, just gave me this strange look, then said quietly, “I heard the bells last night.”

 

I waited, hoping he’d laugh it off again. But he just sipped his coffee and said, “That’s not a cat.”

 

I asked him what he thought it was.

 

He said, “I don’t want to know.”

 

That really unsettled me. My dad’s not the superstitious type. But that day, I started walking the woods behind our house. I figured I’d find a wind chime stuck in a tree or some weird hunting gear. I didn’t.

 

About half a mile in, I found something that felt… wrong.

 

It was a mound. Not a natural hill, but a clear raised shape in the middle of a clearing. Maybe seven feet tall and fifteen feet across. Oval. Covered in oddly green grass and little wildflowers, even though the rest of the woods around it looked dead and brittle. The air felt heavier there, like before a storm.

 

I climbed on top and stood there, not sure what I was looking at. I didn’t have much time to figure it out, because a voice behind me nearly gave me a heart attack.

 

“Found Jumbo,” it said. I spun around so fast I nearly fell off the mound.

 

There was an old man standing at the edge of the clearing. White beard, denim overalls, and a mangy old dog next to him. He looked eighty if he was a day.

 

“No one believes it’s a jumbo,” he said, then started laughing—this raspy smoker’s laugh that turned into a coughing fit.

 

I didn’t ask what he meant. I just took off back toward the house and didn’t stop until I was inside, door locked, curtains closed.

 

That night the bells came back. I sat in bed with headphones on full blast just to block them out. I didn’t sleep.

 

A few weeks later, I missed the school bus home. Dad was working late, so I decided to just walk. It’s a two-mile walk down the winding country road, past fields and old houses. No sidewalks. I was about ten minutes from home when I passed a house with a sagging porch and a bunch of metal yard art. That’s when I heard it.

 

“Girl!”

 

I froze. It was the same old man from the woods.

 

“Wait right there,” he said, and disappeared into the house. I honestly should’ve kept walking, but I was curious—nervous curious, if that makes sense.

 

He came back out a minute later with a yellowed newspaper folded under one arm.

 

“Told you it was a jumbo,” he said, handing it to me.

 

He’d already folded it to a specific page. It was dated August 1935.

 

The headline read: “Carnival Elephant Dies on Route to Exhibition Grounds – Buried Near Ridge Grove.”

 

There was a grainy black-and-white photo. A few men stood around what looked like a massive lump in the ground. One of them was clearly the handler. Next to him stood a performer in a checkered costume, wearing a jester’s hat with three bells dangling from it. I stared at the photo for a long time.

 

The man clapped me on the shoulder and said, “That’s where you live now.”

 

I ran all the way home, newspaper still in my hand.

 

I didn’t sleep that night either. The bells came back, more frequent this time. Almost like they were circling. All I could picture was that jester in the woods. I tried to tell him, but Dad didn’t want to talk about it anymore, and honestly, I didn’t want to push it. Had he seen something that night he was up late?

 

But the bells never really stopped. Some nights they’re quiet, just the occasional jingle far off. Other nights they’re closer. Once, I could swear I saw something move in the tree line. Not an animal. Just a shape. Watching.

 

I don’t walk in the woods anymore. I keep my curtains closed. And I haven’t heard from the old man again.

 

But I think about that photo a lot. The jester standing beside the elephant. The bells on his hat.

 

I wonder if he comes back sometimes. If he’s visiting the grave of his old friend. Maybe performing one last act.

 

I just wish he’d do it somewhere else.
