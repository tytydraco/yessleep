When I was a child, my grandmother used to sit with me in the late afternoon, in the coolness of the porch at her house. I often asked her to tell me stories about her life in the countryside—tales she repeated with endless patience and that, even though I knew them by heart, always managed to send a shiver down my spine. One of those stories was unlike the others; it didn’t speak of daily chores or childhood mischief in the small rural village where she lived. It was a strange, dark tale that she told in a hushed voice, as if fearing someone else might overhear. The protagonist was her father, a farmer devoted to growing cassava. He was a hardworking man who spent his days planting, harvesting, and taking the fruits of his labor to town to sell. In those times, everything revolved around what the land could provide. His faithful companion on those long days was Pecas, a white mare with brown spots—a noble creature that seemed to perfectly understand her master’s needs.

It was an ordinary afternoon, one of those where the sun had already slipped behind the mountains, but the sky was still bathed in golden and orange hues. My great-grandfather had had a good day at the market, selling most of his harvest, though there were still some cassavas left in the baskets tied to Pecas’ sides. The journey back home was long and lonely, flanked by tall grasslands and trees whose shadows grew longer with each passing minute. As he walked, he heard something that made him stop abruptly: a child’s babble. It was an unmistakable sound, like that of a baby trying to get someone’s attention. He looked to both sides but saw nothing—until his gaze fell on the edge of the path. Among the tall grass, he caught sight of a small figure.

It was a child, no older than two or three years old. His face and hands were covered in dirt, and his tattered clothing barely covered his body. My great-grandfather’s heart raced. What was such a small child doing there alone? He looked around, expecting to see the child’s mother or someone searching for him, but there was no one. Without a second thought, he decided he couldn’t leave him there. He bent down to pick him up and carried him in his arms, feeling how light he was, as if he hadn’t eaten in days. Without a proper way to carry him, he improvised a sling with a cloth he had in the baskets and tied the child to his back. The boy didn’t say a word, not a single sound, but his large, dark eyes seemed to watch him intently.

With the little one on his back, he resumed his journey. At first, everything seemed normal, but soon he began to notice something strange. The child, who had been as light as a feather, started to feel heavier and heavier. My great-grandfather thought it was the accumulated fatigue of the day, but there was something about that sensation he couldn’t quite explain. Pecas, who always walked calmly by his side, began behaving unusually. She neighed, gave small jumps, and twitched her ears as if she were hearing something he couldn’t. Then, the child started to cry—a sharp, piercing wail that seemed to cut through the silence of the evening. My great-grandfather tried to soothe him, gently patting his back, but this only seemed to unsettle Pecas even more. The mare began moving nervously, rearing up on her hind legs as though something had frightened her.

That’s when he felt something cold and heavy on his shoulders. The child, who had been tied to his back facing the landscape, had somehow completely turned around. Now, he was chest to back, his small hands gripping my great-grandfather’s shoulders tightly. My great-grandfather, puzzled and a bit frightened, turned his head to look at him. What he saw left him frozen in place. The child’s eyes, which had seemed normal before, were now enormous, with pupils so tiny they were mere black dots in a sea of white. And then, in a childlike voice, the boy said something that chilled him to the bone:

— "Daddy, I got teeth now."

Immediately, he opened his mouth. And what he revealed were not normal teeth. It was an endless row of tiny sharp fangs, like those of a carnivorous fish, glistening under the faint light of twilight. My great-grandfather screamed, a cry that echoed down the empty path. In a desperate move, he untied the makeshift carrier and dropped the child to the ground. He ran towards Pecas, who was now whinnying frantically. He barely had time to mount the mare when he felt a sharp pain in his leg. He looked down and saw, to his horror, that the creature, that 'child,' had clung to Pecas' thigh, biting with its sharp fangs.

Desperate, he took out his peinilla (a type of long axe used for fieldwork such as cutting grass, weeds, or ropes) and struck the creature with all his might. Pecas was jumping, trying to shake off the weight. Finally, the creature released its grip and fell to the ground, letting out a high-pitched cry that blended with the echo of the night. He didn’t stop to look back. He galloped at full speed back to his house, the sound of the crying following him until it finally faded away. When he reached home, he checked Pecas. The mare was injured; her left thigh had a bite mark, a perfect oval made up of dozens of small holes, each bleeding as if they were independent wounds.

That night, my great-grandfather couldn’t sleep. My grandmother used to say that, after that day, he never took that path at dusk again, and every time he told the story, his voice would tremble, as if he could still feel the weight of that creature on his back.

Has anyone else heard of a creature like that?
