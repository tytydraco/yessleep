So a bit of a back story, when I was 15 my parents were on vacation and just me and my brother were home. We lived (I say lived cuz I moved out last year) in a relatively big house, 2 story’s tall. My mom is a spiritual practitioner and has been doing that her whole life. I’m Kind of spiritual my self and I have tried to learn a few things from her. My grandma, grandpa and my uncle + aunt are living right beside us btw.

So when my parents were away my brother (then 19-20 years) threw a house party. Not many people just the closest of his friends. I also invited my, back then, best friend. Let’s call her Lilly. Lilly was that kind of girl who was tall, skinny and also very spiritual. Just not the right spiritual path, she made a deal with the devil but tried to get away from it cuz she was scared idk.

So we drank a bit, vodka bull to be exact. We have a jacuzzi so we sat in there. The alcohol was kinda hitting harder in the 40C whirlpool.

We had a sleepover that evening and I was so drunk that I was about to throw up when I started praying to god (I have/had emetophobia).

The next day I was hungover, headache, nausea etc. but after a few days the symptoms didn’t get any better. Until one night, I had a uneasy feeling and remembered the words my mom always has taught me „if you feel something not being right, ask if there’s someone“ so I did.

I layed there on my back, staring at the ceiling. The nausea came over me again, just like the other days before. I said „if there’s something in here, that does not belong there. Show yourself“ hoping nothing would happen.

Suddenly I feel a shift, something HEAVY was on my chest, pushing me in the mattress. I could not breathe, I kid you not, I wasn’t able to breathe. The nausea got worse and my vision got black spots. But as suddenly as it came, it vanished. No nausea, no heavy thing on my chest. Nothing.

Next day, I called my mom asking what I should do and I explained her the whole situation. She said I should clean my room with sage. I did so. Praying while cleansing. I did it 3 times in total. My room back then was on the weather side so I wouldn’t have to open my door for it to get out trough the window.

I was at a friends place while it aired out (I hope that’s right, English isn’t my first language) but when I came home, my room was still full of the sage smoke. Which was unusual. So I left my room a bit and hoped it would go out the window. At about 10 pm I went to my room and to my surprise the smoke was gone. After nearly 10 hours.

I layed in my bed, first time after 5 days with no nausea or uneasy feeling. I knew something from Lilly was in there, something dark and evil. After that I cut contact when she told me that the devil she had a deal with was following her non stop.

I believe in that kind of stuff and I am convinced she left me unpurposely something bad in my room when we both were drunk.

I just wanted to share this since it was my first real interaction with something dark and evil back then. I have tons more story’s if anyone’s interested.

Thank you for reading.
