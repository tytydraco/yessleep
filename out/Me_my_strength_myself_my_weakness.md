I was 19 at the time, I live in greece. (drinking age is 18) It's christmas 3-4 in the morning and im returning home from a nice night out, it was pretty chill many friends showed up but nothing crazy happened, just laughing sharing stories, noone got shitfaced, no drama, no break ups/hook ups. It was really pleasant.

I live on what it is called ''grape rows'', its usually a huge extremely busy road connecting to the city and behind it, rows upon rows of houses all next to each other, those streets are pretty quiet which was cool growing up because we could play sports on the street. Every 500meters or so there would be a connecting road connecting you to all the other roads. As you go up the grape rows, street lights become scarce. At first you see the two street light lights meeting each other. As you go up, there is a street light then 300meters of darkness then another light. I live at the tipy top of the grape rows.

This night happened to be extremely windy, so windy you could barely hear anything, as i'm coming close to a connecting road i make sure to look left and right in case i don't hear a car coming up. On my right about 500-300 meters away from me, i see a white square perfectly hovering 1,3 meters from the street. At first i thought it might be an albatross sitting on a garbage bin, and the bin beneath it, its not visible, but why would a garbage bin be in middle of the street ? Then i thought it might be a white suitcase on top of a black car but still with all the windows of a car there is still some reflection even from from a black car. I kept staring at this thing. I started noticing it was very slowly coming towards me. There was literally nothing beneath it, this white square was not making any living moves, it was perfectly hovering.

Then 2 sticks came from the side of it, making it shaped like a cross, it started coming towards me very fast. I started sprinting with everything i got. I never looked back. It was really windy, it was so noisy, i could only hear my breathing and my heart beat, which made me focus on my run, the wind gave a nice breeze towards my face and the adrenalin was making my sprint effortless. After 5 kilometers of running my legs shut down, like a switch i fell on the street. I look back the white cross it's almost at me.

The white cross stops, i hear laughing. A neighbour was sitting on the steering wheel of a black bicycle, Completely covering the driver of the bicycle, and the bicycle itself, He was wearing a glow in the dark long sleeve shirt and the rest of his outfit was black. He was holding his arms out while the other guy was bicycling behind him. The bicycle is surpisingly thin if you look at it facing you.

The neighbour said while laughing, ''*you must have looked at your face, you were so scared, did you think we were gypsies?*''. First of all thats racist. But i didnt want to admit what i trully thought, I believed in alien/ghost hybrids for 30 minutes while running for my life. The driver of the bicycle was visually sweating and out off breath said ''*solid run fatty*''. 

The neighbour, I thought he was cool guy. Never part of the group a little hermit. After this experience even on his best efforts I don't want to hang out with this guy again. The willingness to take the joke this far fucked me up. If I did this once I saw the person being really scared I would yell its a joke and calm them down.
