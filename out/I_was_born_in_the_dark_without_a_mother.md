No one I'd ever known had seen sunlight, nor the sky. We'd never felt anything underfoot but rusted metal flooring covered in feces and every viscera you can imagine.

I was born here and I spent my childhood here. We had storms and tornados, but they weren't the sort that you would be familiar with. 

We had stomach-clenching thunder followed by flashes of light, but our lightning was purposeful and violent, extinguishing many of us at once. Whenever you heard the thunder, you'd try to hide, but it never changed - enormous beasts gripped our friends by the ankles and hauled them away.

 Our friends and neighbors screamed when they were grabbed and we never saw those people again. 

I had never smelt anything but the feces and the blood. I have no mother. Everyone I'd ever known had been my age. None of us even knew what a mother was, but we were still babies, with the primal urges to suckle and cry for warmth and comfort. But that desire was never met. Eventually, we gave up and gnawed on our own bodies. We suckled blood and pus off each other.

(Here, writing about it, I lose myself from my present situation.)

There is agony everywhere you look. If you entered my body, you'd see it. People with eyes dripping blood and pus, faces so contorted in misery you wish you could kill them just to end it. 7 years old, and stepping on the fallen body of a peer who is still unfortunately, breathing. They have one eye but it's pressed to the ground in a mound of feces. The other eye a mess of crispy gore and oozing pus. I drank it, in starvation. I only stopped once the screams shattered my starvation fugue state. I vomited and ate the vomit straight afterwards. 

 I remember blinking from a stupor to see this body…it dawned on me that it was my own mouth open, tongue weakly extending and trying to curl my own feces into my bloody mouth. I had nothing to vomit - no food nor water - and I was used to this by now. Nothing but pain.

Can you picture it? What my childhood had been? I was saved from that place - no one I've ever met since has, though some have been rescued from similar hells. It seems these nightmares are common amongst people who look like me.

 I was chosen by chance, by sick luck that I cherish, despite my gut-wrenching agony at leaving them behind. I try to tell myself that it was all a horrible nightmare, just so I can heal and survive and hopefully, one day, live.

But I wasn't saved directly from that hell. I was rescued once I was taken by the tornado-and-lightening. After I had learned what happened to the people who were grabbed by those metal claws. 

This is what I remember.

I felt the tightness around my ankles as I was hoisted upside-down and hung from an assembly line. To my left and right were other people, howling and crying and thrashing. I hadn't even noticed that I was screaming until I felt my throat painfully give out and my voice dry up. 

I was terrified. It's really hard to write about, and it's taken me a decade to even attempt to put to paper what I experienced in that place.

I can't write about the trip between that initial seizure and the following experience. Not right now. I can't relive it. But I remember the swaying and the screaming, the feces we had to eat to survive. 

I have to move on.

There was so much fear. Many people don't realize, but you can smell fear. It has a distinct, unmistakable wretchedness. It smells sour and strange. It was everywhere, for days on end. My feet got a fungal infection in the waste that was everywhere. My throat got so dry I couldn't even whimper. I just wanted to sleep, but the slits in the walls screamed and flashed unnatural colors every few seconds. I passed out eventually and woke up with my left eye blinking in feces and piss. Someone was standing on my pelvis, but I was too weak to express more than a gasp.

When I woke up…

The world was brighter than I had ever seen in my life. I was upside-down, all the blood draining to my head. Huge creatures moved around me. I hadn't eaten or had water in countless days.

It took effort but I strained my head to the left. Someone hung there. To the right, someone else. But on that side…god. I saw a slick whir, soaked in gore. It crept closer. 

The sound it made as it met the neck of someone three bodies away from mine will never leave my mind as long as I live.

Her scream turned into a gurgle.

The blood escaped her neck in ribbons. Her mouth chattered silently and froze. Her body was suddenly thrust away. I closed my eyes, my throat too dry to scream - 

The belt suddenly came to a halt. There were guttural screams in every direction. I was scrambling desperately to leave my body. I sucked in and tried to relieve my brain from its delirium. 

I ‘woke up’, so to speak, in a small cage. It just barely held the full length of my crumpled body. I thought, I'm dead.

I was in such a state of agony that I lost my sanity. I stripped my shoulder of its feathers, pecked my feet until they soaked the towel beneath me. I didn't recall this at the time but I learned later that I'd bashed my head against the wire cage until my comb broke open. I eventually passed out.

I've been free for a few years now. I've never tried to share what I went through before. I've never tried writing it out. I think it will be met with scorn at best, and further violence at worst. But I have to try, because my peers and my family and friends are still out there, and they won't ever be free until something changes.
