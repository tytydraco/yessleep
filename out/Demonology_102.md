It's okay, really. Stop deleting my drafts and files, you're not going to “save me” or whatever. If anything you're just setting me back. I need to write. They need to know.

Lesson 2: Application of Safety and Protection

When you step into a chemistry lab, you don't just start pouring and titrating without gloves and goggles. The same applies to esoteric practices.

I get it, it feels so cool to “raw dog” a goetic encounter, but the risks you're taking are far greater than any reward you may glean. When you perform a ritual without any protection, you subject yourself to the will of the demon. Like a felon representing themselves in court. 

A little bit of preparation can change this angle entirely. When you practice from inside a circle of protection, or while channeling through a safe artifact, you effectively ensure yourself Habeas Corpus. (Think of the ring of Solomon or Mary's veil) It is much harder for a demon to violate your  boundaries when you can name the laws it's breaking. Besides, nothing feels more brazen and badass than lawyering a demon into submission.

Mediums, while an expensive commodity, can serve as an extra layer of protection. Having someone represent you in court, who knows the rules better than you, is a massive resource. Unfortunately, it's only a job, and a medium won't be willing to commit to anything too risky or unsound. If you want to rule the world, you have to do that shit yourself. 

I learned this the hard way. I wasn't trying to rule the world, never did, I just wanted someone to help me. Help my friends. 

He refused outright. Wouldn't even let us, paying customers, through his door. Traffic passed on the four lane highway behind us as dusk fell over our shoulders. The squatty, Grecian man simply told us we had “the evil eye” and told us to leave his property. We sunk a few eggs into his crystal ball sign later that night.  

Lesson learned. When it comes to demons and curses, a medium won't put themselves into harm's way for you. Granted, life guards have to be careful not to get drowned themselves when they rescue a panicking victim. I guess it makes sense. 

Well, next we tried saints and angels. A huge leap, I know, but it seemed logical at the time. Dear reader, know now that if you do not have a relationship with a saint or angel, then you should develop that now. You can't put the cart before the horse. Once that connection is severed by a demonic presence it can not be established. However, if you are familiar with Metatron *before* you are cursed, he may just help you out of a bind. 

What I have learned of demons so far is that they are computational. This we covered in the last lesson. They function similarly to coding and software. All of this goes out the window when discussing angelic or otherwise “holy” beings. It is much more akin to chemistry. It's organic and living. Far too malleable to understand. 

I still don't grasp how thrones hold themselves together, spinning and winking, flapping and warping. Demons are obvious and self created, they are an avatar of their own intention. Angels however: identical. Every single one. They have ranks, which you can research on your own if you'd like, but those are really the only distinctions in appearance. Most of the time they just look… impossible. I've only seen cherubs and thrones, but I know that's barely the surface of what exists. What's really out there in the bottomless pit of space? I don't want to know. 

Their magic functions much more similarly to sorcery than law. Cooking versus baking. When you commune with a demon, you have to use many steps and barriers, follow every rule. When you want to commune with an angel, well, you just hope. They won't pull your teeth out or twist your nails like a malicious demon. Maybe scare you by accident, but they should never be harmful.

Jaxsyn nearly killed himself running down the stairs, careening his ankles at strange angles and slamming himself into walls. Grace and Brie were on their way inside, still wrapped in the ecstacy of senior year dead mall romp time. It took a while to calm things down. I ended up investigating alone. 

He said he heard grinding stone, shifting against itself. That's when an armless, legless being rolled into his vision. Its faces turned and popped loudly on an axis, presenting an eagle, lion, man, and an unknown fourth animal (probably a bison) that Jaxsyn didn't get a good look at. It was gone by the time I got up there, but Jaxsyn described in perfect detail a biblical cherub. 

I think we all tried to convince Jaxsyn he was crazy to put ourselves at ease. I'm not really sure. I, for one, didn't want to believe in all this so suddenly. Fuck him for pushing this on us.

 We should have paid much closer attention to the dates the board had read to us. If we had known he would only be alive for a few more days we would never have treated him like that. Even Brie. I mean, there was no more doubt *after* the fact, but hindsight is always 20/20. 

I should have told them I saw it too. 

His father and I found him one Saturday morning after he flaked on me. All of the guns were still in their safes when the police investigated. No prints, no bullet holes, no gun. But somehow, Jaxsyn had been strewn around the room as if by buckshot. A deep, rectangular grove was still impressed in the carpet, like a single train track.  About 3 inches wide, it ran through the length of his body, shearing him in half.

I'll never know what happened to Jaxsyn. I mean I have some idea but really I'll never know *what* killed him. That's kind of what I'm trying to do here. Maybe if I write enough I'll figure out if what we saw was an angel or a demon, or maybe it's both. Maybe there is no difference at all. 

Sometimes demons will imitate angels to confuse humans or lull them into a false sense of security. 

Protect yourself. Use circles, light candles, meditate. The stronger your volition the easier it will be. Most importantly, never trust anything fully if your safety isn't guaranteed.
