As you're currently reading this, I've been probably teleported to a universe from the billions, if not trillions of universes in the multiverse, I'll probably never get back to Earth no matter how hard I would try.

It all started on December 13th 2021, my family set a trip for all of us, going to various cities. As me and my siblings started packing bags and changing clothes. I had to use the bathroom immediately, so, in a rush, I went to the bathroom as quickly as i could, instant regret, I saw a black substance being animate and fully follow me in the bathroom, I got out, locked the door and told my parents that the toilet was flushed and we should leave it for when we come back from the trip.

All of us were done, we locked the front door of the house, and got in the car. My dad drives to the nearest airport, the one where he booked tickets for us. He gives us the tickets, and end up in the airplane. Nothing unusual happening yet. The flight lasted 4 to 6 hours, I've been asleep the whole time, so I don't fully know how much it did take. 

After we arrive in the city, we got to a pizzeria, order some food since we were all hungry, and then headed to a hotel.
The hotel was amazing, everything was clean and modern,  so I felt like home. Midnight sets, me and my siblings go to sleep since we were really tired and fatigued. I fall asleep.

I wake up next day to find out I'm in a whole different hotel, an alien-looking one. I thought it was a nightmare, since crazy stuff happened, my family wasn't there, there weren't any humans, just tall, uncanny looking creatures that weren't harmful. I wish it was only a nightmare, but it only gets worse. The air. The air was different from what I remember, I'm not breathing oxygen, I'm breathing an alien alternative of Oxygen. Luckily, or not, my lungs managed to get used to the weird air. I feel depressed, my family is gone, and it's only me with those aliens. Thankfully, the aliens use a similar technology for WiFi, as us, humans, use, so this won't stop me sharing this story. 

The second day, I wake up to another different world, with the same type of air as the first universe, this time, no WiFi, no connection, I was the only being with a smart device in the universe, the aliens appeared much more uncanny, I couldn't make eye contact with them, they were tall, they had 3 arms and 3 legs. I was anxious, starting to question reality. In a couple of hours since then, I found some wool like material, making it a perfect place to sleep. And that's what I do.

The next day, amazing, it was looking like I got to a more modern looking Earth, this time, it had extremely good WiFi! The aliens were much closer to looking like humans and this weird feeling of uncanniness suddenly disappeared. I got myself a power bank, charge my phone, and then wait for it to charge. After it was done charging, I opened Google Maps out of curiosity, my jaw dropped, the map wasn't looking like Earth at all! It looked like a child's depiction of Earth drawn on paper. However, I remembered I downloaded a picture of Earth a long time ago, a sudden sad feeling hits me, seeing all the countries and capitals of the Earth, knowing my family is there. I ignore the sadness that struck me and go further exploring. I found a library, not the same as on Earth. I was shocked to find out they knew writing and talking, they had unknown symbols as their alphabet, so I pulled out Google Translate with camera on, and it says "PLEASE POINT TO TEXT", so it means there's no symbols like those on the Blue Marble. Near the books on the right there was an alien looking confused at me, so I immediately got to it and showed a picture of my planet. She was EXTREMELY confused, pointing to a map of it's planet. It sets midnight here too, so out of instinct, I found a "hotel" and sneaked in an empty room. I get comfy and get to sleep.

After I wake up, I regretted the choice to sleep, but I can't turn back time so I just live with it, the aliens were even more uncanny, worse than the second day. But this time, their organs were exposed, with no skin or flesh to protect them from attacks, the sky was blood red, I was terrified, I really miss my family, the urge of suicidal was extreme, but instead I just got to sleep and pray for the next day

Today I woke up in a universe similar to the third one, I can't explain much since it's around morning so I'll keep updates when I spot something new.
