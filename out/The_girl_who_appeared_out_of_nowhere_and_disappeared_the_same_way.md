 So this happened about 10 years ago when I was working as a cab driver in New York City. I’d lived there most of my life, and this was when I had just started driving. I think it was my first or second week not really sure.

Anyway, one night I got a call to pick someone up. I remember it was late, around 2 or 3 a.m., and the streets were pretty quiet. I waited outside for about five minutes, but nobody came out. That happens sometimes,   People order a ride and then either forget about it or decide not to go. After waiting a bit longer, I decided to cancel the ride and just move on.

This was in the Bronx, btw, and as I was making a turn to head back to the main road, something really strange happened. Out of nowhere, this girl knocks on my window. And when I say “out of nowhere,” I mean it i didn’t see her walking up or anything. She just appeared, like she came out of thin air.

She looked pretty normal, though—young, maybe mid 20s, wearing simple clothes. She asks me if I’m working, and I said yeah. Then she tells me where she’s going and asks how much I’d charge. Now, since I was new to the job, I didn’t really know what to charge, so I just asked her how much she usually paid. She said $10, and I was like, aight, cool.

She gets in the backseat, and as soon as she sits down, she asks me to turn off the AC and the music. That was weird because it was summer, and it was really hot that night. I wasn’t blasting the AC or anything, just keeping the car cool, but she seemed uncomfortable. Still, I did what she asked it’s not uncommon for passengers to make little requests like that.

The weird thing, though, is that she didn’t say another word after that. Nothing. Usually, passengers either chat or sit there quietly scrolling on their phones, but she just sat there, staring out the window. I thought maybe she was tired or something, so I didn’t think much of it at first.

When we got close to the destination, I asked her for the building number. No response. I asked again, a little louder this time. Still nothing. That’s when I glanced in the rearview mirror… and there was no one there. She was gone.

I freaked out. My first thought was that maybe she got out of the car while we were stopped at a light or something, but that didn’t make sense. The doors were locked, and I would’ve heard or felt the door open.

I pulled over, got out, and checked the backseat, but there was nobody there. I know for a fact that she got in the car. I talked to her. She was there. But she just vanished.

To this day, I have no explanation for what happened. I wasn’t tired, I wasn’t imagining things, and I don’t drink or do drugs. This was real. It’s probably the creepiest thing that’s ever happened to me or at least one of them. I still think about it sometimes
