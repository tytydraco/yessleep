CREATURES OF THE NIGHT BY OSCAR FLORENCE

I never thought I would find myself living in a log cabin deep in the woods. To some, I might
be referred to as a city slicker. I work at a medium-sized tech firm that focuses on
cybersecurity, and we are an independent contractor for the United States military,
focused on cyber warfare. That’s about all I can tell you. In fact, I may have already
transgressed the regulations outlined in Title 18.

I have a wife, Juliana, who was a registered nurse in the ICU, and we have a daughter,
Teirza, pronounced “Tear-za.” Her middle name is Joy. My wife was told that she would
never be able to have children; however, when our miracle was born, she wanted to name
her Teirza Joy. Why did we both quit our jobs, pack our bags, and move out to the middle of
nowhere when neither one of us knew a damn thing about living off-grid? 

Let me take you
back. One day, after my wife’s grueling 16-hour shift, she couldn’t hold in her emotions any
longer. She cried as she told me about the brutal injuries she witnessed in the intensive
care unit, all victims of city violence, some of them our daughter’s age. And in my own
years working in cybersecurity, I have faced off against cybercriminals who want to wreak
havoc on a society already teetering. I think that was the tipping point for both of us, and in
order to keep ourselves, and our little miracle safe, we made this spontaneous move. Little
did we know, we were trading the dangers of city life for the dangers of the wilderness.

When we arrived, the cabin had been well maintained. It had a wood-burning stove, a loft,
and a porch that overlooked a small creek. We had no neighboring houses for at least a
mile. We spent the second day unpacking boxes, arranging furniture, and getting
acquainted with our new home. Juliana and I took turns showing Teirza around the
property, careful not to let her stray too far. We’re helicopter parents, I know. But I noticed
these tracks in the mud near the riverbed. Now, I’m a tech guy, I don’t know a thing about
paw prints, but what I do know is that whatever this thing was, it must have been big, and it
didn’t look like a bear claw. It looked more like a reptile’s claw.

Later that evening, we had our solar panels delivered and installed on the roof of the cabin.
I stood outside in the driveway, directing the man on the roof to which angle I thought the
solar panels would get the most sunlight, when I noticed three rugged mountain men type
of people came walking out of the tree line. They wore flannel shirts, had unkempt beards,
reeked of wood smoke and body odor, and they carried hunting rifles slung over their
shoulders. They were chuckling about something. I deal with confrontation much better in
the virtual world than in person, that’s for sure. I would have just hoped those men would
have walked away and never come back, having seen that the property was now under new
ownership. 

My wife had other plans, and she was motioning at me through the window to
stop those men and talk to them. I figured they were just out hunting and didn’t know that
this property had been bought, so I certainly did not feel threatened. “Excuse me. Excuse
me!” I hollered out to them. One
of them stopped, and the other two kept walking. I ran up to them. The other two then
turned around. “Hey, I wasn’t sure if you guys were aware, but this is our property you’re
trespassing on.” First, one of them starts to laugh, then all three of them are laughing at
me. One of them squints his eyes to get a good look at me from head to toe. “Ye ain’t from
'round here, are ya?” The tallest man in the group spits on the ground. “We just moved in a
couple of days ago.”

“What brings you to these parts? That your fancy car over there?” Two of the men asked me
questions at the same time, one of them pointing at my car. “The Model 3 Tesla? Yeah,
that’s mine.” They start to laugh again. Now I am starting to get pissed. “That perty little car
there ain’t gon’ nowhere when winter hits. And dem, uh, electrical things you puttin’ on the
roof there ain’t gon’ do shit in winter.” 

I shook my head and started to walk away. I was
contemplating whether to raise my voice and sound a little more threatening, but these
men would laugh at that and only exacerbate my anger. “This conversation’s over,” I said,
walking away. “It ain’t safe out here at night.” What the hell does he mean by that? Was it
some kind of threat to me? Yeah, I am only 5 foot 9, I got skinny frail arms, I use solar
panels, and I drive an electric car. Maybe that makes me a pussy. But if you put my family
in any kind of danger, I will make sure you understand who the fuck you are dealing with.

I remembered that I had installed security cameras around the cabin and driveway the day
we moved in. After viewing the footage, I screenshotted their faces, then used a facial
recognition website to delve into their backgrounds. But my cybersecurity skills offered a
deeper dive—I could hack into their digital accounts, read their emails and messages, and
even sell their identities or credit card information on the black market if I wanted to.

Despite the feeling of power I have over them now, I decided not to, for it’s not worth the
punishment of getting caught. I chose a different approach. My message was clear: their
intrusion was recorded, and any further trespassing would have consequences. It was a
clear warning: I know more about them than they want people to realize, so they should
tread lightly.

That same night, I decided to look over every hour of my camera footage from the moment
we arrived here. I was hunting down these rednecks like I would hunt down a cybercriminal
plotting a terrorist attack online. Yet, what I found on that footage chilled me to the bone,
far surpassing any unease those rednecks had caused. One of the cameras, positioned to
oversee the forest behind us, 84.3 acres, had captured something that to this day still
scares me.

At first glance, I just assumed it was an anomaly—moonlight reflecting off a shiny object,
perhaps? But as I zoomed in and really analyzed the footage, frame by frame, the reality
dawned on me. It was no ordinary object; its movements were too deliberate. With
controlled precision that defied conventional aircraft capabilities, it hovered eerily around
our cabin before vanishing into the night at impossible speeds. The structural design bore
no resemblance to human engineering standards, a conclusion drawn from my
comprehensive understanding of military cyber protocols. 

Prior to my contract with the
United States military, I underwent some pretty rigorous training in the digital connectivity
of fighter jets and combat helicopters to prevent cyber threats against them. I may not be
an engineer or have clearances on how these fighter jets are designed, but I do understand
the command and control systems of some of them, and this was unlike anything I have
ever seen before. It was, for all intents and purposes, an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon
(UAP)—a UFO in layman’s terms.

It was raining hard that night, and I remember my wife walking over to me with a cup of tea.
I didn’t know if I should tell her or not. The sighting alone was enough to make a skeptic
question their disbelief, maybe even her, a devout skeptic. But I can say this much: what
I’ve been briefed on has tilted the scales for me, pushing me more towards the side of a
believer. 

There are things out there, phenomena that defy our current understanding of
physics and aerospace technology. And what I saw that night? Well, it makes me consider
that while we thought we were alone in the universe this whole time, we were actually
being observed right under our noses.

I spent hours in front of my computer, something I am used to, as you can imagine. I had to
get up and stretch my legs. I grabbed the dog leash and put it on Lizzie, our white German
Shepherd. I wish that I could just let her out by herself, but she has a habit of running away.
I grabbed my tea and headed out the door. She pulled me through the muddy yard, with the
rain still pouring down heavily. 

As she was doing her business in the yard, something must
have startled her because she perked up and faced the forest, on high alert. The sound of
the rain was dominant, so she must have heard something that I did not. Then suddenly, I
heard something large running in the forest. From what I could see, some of the trees were
swaying, and I could hear branches breaking.

Lizzie pulled me so hard, unexpectedly, that I spilled my hot tea on myself before falling in
the mud. She was barking and growling at whatever was in the woods. The leash slipped
from my hands as I was getting back to my feet. She bolted towards the woods. “Lizzie!
Lizzie!” I yelled for her, but she disappeared into the forest. 

I love that dog. She is very loyal
and a great addition to our family, but she pisses me off sometimes, and I had no intention
of going looking for her that night. But… my wife and daughter weren’t having any of it. As I
stood in the doorway, dripping wet and covered in mud, Teirza was looking out the window
and sobbing. “She’s all alone out there. What if she’s killed by a bear?” Teirza cried out.
Juliana didn’t even have to say a word. All she had to do was give me that look, and I was
off again.

Here I was, flashlight in hand, treading through the damn forest on a cold, rainy night.
“Lizzie!” Nothing. I figured I would walk about 180 degrees through the forest and then
head back if I didn’t see her. In the meantime, I was thinking of some way I could let my
girls down gently in explaining that I couldn’t find her. 

But then, I heard the faint sound of
barking in the distance. “Lizzie!” I kept calling out. I moved closer and closer to the sound
of her bark, but it stopped. Her bark turned into fearful growling. I sensed that something
else was out there in the forest with us, and honestly, I was too scared to holler once more
for her. As I quietly moved closer to the sound, I could see her, maybe a hundred yards
away. 

I began a steady jog toward her, as I noticed she was frozen in her tracks. I got within
twenty yards of her, but I could see her tail between her legs, and she was shaking,
showing her teeth. I stopped. I moved my flashlight in the direction she was facing. At first,
all I saw was a bunch of trees, their branches swaying in the wind. 

But as I moved the beam
upward to illuminate the tops of the trees, my blood ran cold. What I thought were two
grotesque, oddly shaped trees, were… legs! I didn’t realize it was a creature until I saw its
torso. It was massive and muscular, encased in what looked like metallic armor. I knew it
had to be wearing some type of clothing, by the way the light reflected back toward me.

As I watched in stunned silence, the creature lowered itself onto its hind legs, its massive
arms slamming down on each side of Lizzie with a force that sent tremors rippling through
the forest floor. With a slow, deliberate movement, it lowered its head to stare at my
terrified dog, but it never attacked. It just watched, with curiosity.

Bang. I heard a loud gunshot in the distance, followed by three more shots. Way in the
distance, I saw lights turn on some sort of object that had landed in the woods, and the
creature ran on all fours toward it. I got back to my feet and ran over to her. I got to pet her,
and she bit my hand.

But once she recognized it was me, she calmed down a little, and I grabbed her leash. At
this point, I was so disoriented and consumed by fear that I couldn’t remember which
direction the cabin was. But I could hear the sound of people talking far off in the distance,
so I decided to move in that direction. The closer I got to the sound of chatter, I realized it
sounded like some men arguing. “No, uh-uh. I ain’t doin’ it. You go out there yourself then.
I’m goin’ home!” I heard, as they came into my sight. “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me,” I
said to myself. 

As I was about to emerge from the woods, they must have heard me
because the three mountain men I saw trespassing on my yard now had a trespasser on
theirs. Or at least someone’s property. Funny how fate often accompanies irony. They
pointed their guns in my direction. 

Bang! A bullet ricocheted off a tree near me. I crouched
down immediately, covering Lizzie. “Jesus Christ! Don’t shoot!” I cried out. “What in the
sam hell?” said one of the mountain men. “I think there be a god damn person out there!” I
walked out of the forest with the dog, my hands up for some reason, and I was shaking.
“Are you a stupid sum’a bitch or what? Don’t you city people know you ain’t never wanna
walk alone in the forest at night? The hell’s wrong with you?” 

They lowered their guns. I was
too tired, scared, and just lacked the energy to even speak. “They got some big beasts out
there. One of these days we gon’ catch one of them things from space.” I fell to my knees. I
suspected they had also encountered these beings. Two of the men began to laugh. “These
forests have yet to turn you into a man.” “Can someone please just give me a ride back to
my place?” I interjected.

There I was, sitting in the passenger seat of one of the men’s old pickup trucks, with my
dog in my lap. The inside smelled like wet dog and stale cigarettes. As we were pulling into
the narrow driveway of my cabin, we felt a thud on the ground, and we knew that creature
had to be near. As soon as we pulled up to the cabin, Juliana came running outside after
she saw me exit the truck. “I was worried sick about you. I thought I was going to have to
report you missing,” she said. I think she could tell that I was shook up. “What happened
out there?” she asked. 

We heard another loud thud, and the ground shook. “Dad, what
was that?” Teirza asked, as she latched onto Lizzie. I hurried to get everyone inside and
offered the mountain man—yes, I still call him that, even though I found his full name and
even social security number online—to stay inside until daylight before leaving. He paused,
looking at the ground for a moment, before saying, “Yeah, maybe that’s a good idea.”

We dimmed the lights so as not to draw too much attention to the cabin. Juliana, the
mountain man, and I all sat in the living room, while Teirza dried Lizzie off with a towel, her
gaze fixed intensely out the window. I sat across from him, with nothing but a coffee table
between us.

He tugged at his beard, glancing nervously toward the window before locking eyes with me.
“My uh, cellular phone’s been all screwy lately,” he said. “Started right after those… things
showed up. I’m telling ya, it’s gotta be them aliens messing with it.” I tried to hold back a
chuckle, for it seemed irony had struck again. He looked at me as if I might confirm his
suspicions. “Sounds like your phone may have been hacked,” I suggested. “Really?
Hacked?” Juliana chimed in, her tone edging toward accusation.

From the corner of my eye, I caught Juliana glaring at me, her arms folded tightly across her
chest. I knew that look well—it was her “I know exactly what you did” stare. I had indeed
tinkered with his phone earlier that day. I simply wanted to scare him a bit, after all, I
thought he had threatened me on my own property. “Aliens, huh?” I managed to say, trying
to keep the conversation light despite Juliana’s scowling face. “That’s one theory,” he
nodded. “Yeah, and it ain’t just me. There are things out here, man, things people aren’t
supposed to see.” 

Juliana continued to glare at me. I knew I’d be hearing about this later.
Yes, what I did was illegal, but still, you don’t mess with my family. Besides, for now, we
had bigger things to worry about than a hacked phone and a ruffled mountain man.

Teirza, her face pressed against the cold glass of the window, gasped. “Dad, look!” Her
finger trembled as she pointed outside. The dog again began to growl and show its teeth.
As I stood to my feet and walked to the window, I could see the creature staring back at
her. 

It was crouched down, watching her with the same sense of curiosity it had shown the
dog earlier. “Don’t move,” I told her, as I had a strong feeling that the creature had no
intention of harming us. But just as I was about to grab her arm and pull her away from the
window, the mountain man raised his gun, pointing it at the creature. “No!” my wife and I
both yelled. I pulled Teirza away from the window just in time before a shot rang out. The
creature was shot directly in its eye and shrieked in pain.

All of us huddled together, getting further from the windows, as we heard it moving around
outside. It started clawing furiously at the walls of the cabin, ripping them apart as if they
were paper. The windows rattled and the door creaked under the strain of its rage. I could
see its eyes, one of them bleeding, as it scanned for any weak points within the cabin. “Get
back!” the mountain man shouted as he loaded another round into his shotgun. 

His hands
were steady, despite the fear I witnessed in his eyes. As the creature lunged at a window,
breaking the glass with its claws, he pushed Teirza and me behind him, shouting for us to
find cover. Juliana and I grabbed Teirza, pulling her into the hallway, away from the
windows.

“Get your family safe!” he yelled over the creature’s screeches. The creature broke through
the window frame, and the mountain man charged, firing directly into its chest. But its
armor ricocheted the bullets, and they had no effect. The cabin was shaking, and all we
could hear were gunshots and the sound of splintering wood. Then, as suddenly as it had
started, the chaos paused. We peeked out to see the mountain man, standing by the
broken window, breathing heavily. The creature then reached its arm in and ripped him
outside through the window. Juliana covered Teirza’s ears as we listened to him scream in
agony, his flesh being torn apart, until everything went silent.

As the first signs of daylight began to light the sky, the creature, sensing the change, let out
a final howl and retreated. We watched it, in nothing but a state of pure shock, as it
disappeared into the trees, where its spacecraft lit up again. A few moments later, the glowing lights from the spacecraft intensified, and with a silent flash, it was gone. I turned
to my family; I knew what we had to do. We couldn’t stay here, not after this. 

Not without
understanding more about what lay hidden in these woods. This is where my story ends, so
my advice to anyone thinking of living off the grid is simple: Know the land you’re settling on
and talk to the locals. Learn from our story. Because out here, the unknown isn’t just a
risk—it can be a matter of life and death.
