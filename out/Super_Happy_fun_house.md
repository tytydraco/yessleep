I don’t know if anyone will ever read this, but I need to tell it somewhere.
I know the internet is full of fake stories, but I swear what I’m about to write is real.
Or at least… real enough that I haven’t been able to sleep for a week.

I’m a teen who’s been into urbex for a couple of years. Nothing extreme—old factories, abandoned schools, places like that. But a month ago, I found a strange reference on an old 2009 forum: a discussion about a kids’ park that never opened to the public, called Super Happy Fun House, supposedly built near the original Teletubbies set the real one, abandoned.
According to the comments, part of the fake grassy set was now underwater.

At first it just seemed like another weird rumor.
Then I found some blurry photos: trees, mud, a broken sign.
And a clue: “Somewhere in the Midwest.”

I shouldn’t have looked for it.

After two days of hiking through the area, I saw it.
A wooden sign, tilted, with a hand-drawn smiley face and the words:

→ HAPPY FUN TRAIL

I don’t know why I followed it. Maybe curiosity, maybe stupidity.
Twenty minutes of walking through leaves and fallen branches, and then I saw it: a small wooden building, decayed, with a nearly faded sign.

SUPER HAPPY FUN HOUSE

The door was open. Not fully just enough to feel like… an invitation.

The moment I stepped inside, I realized I wasn’t alone.

Four figures stood in the middle of the room, like they’d been waiting for me.
They were wearing Teletubbies costumes, but not real ones just random suits, black boots, work gloves. The only “authentic” parts were the masks, which looked like they’d been ripped off giant plush dolls. They were worn-out, dirty, the plastic dull and cracked.

One of them the purple one motioned with its hand.
And from the speakers, a distorted lullaby started playing.

They brought me into a room full of old toys.
They didn’t speak, but they kept pointing at things I had to do, like stacking blocks or finding hidden objects. Every time I finished a task, the lights flickered like I was in some kind of kids’ show except I couldn’t shake the feeling that… something inside the walls was watching me.

I kept telling myself it had to be some kind of weird art performance.
Until they took me to the basement.

Down there was a tiny stage with a row of chairs.
All four climbed onto the stage and started “playing” improvised instruments, making this slow, warped music like a sick version of a children’s theme song.

I wanted to leave.
The door was gone. Not locked gone, like it was part of the wall.

When I turned back, the four figures weren’t on the stage anymore.

The basement wasn’t a normal basement.
It was a maze. Hallways, corners, rooms full of old toys, toppled chairs, boxes of half-finished costumes.

And every now and then, a light. Theirs.

They moved slowly, their flashlights lighting up only half of the old plastic faces. They never ran, but it felt like they knew every step I was taking.

I don’t remember how I found the exit.
All I remember is suddenly being outside, in the woods, my clothes covered in dust and dirt.
I ran without looking back.

I know what you’re thinking: dream, hallucination, made-up story.
I would’ve thought the same.

Until I checked my phone.

I had taken one photo of the sign when I first got there.
Just one.
I found it in the gallery.

The sign was there.

But on the right side, between the trees, you can see a red figure, perfectly still, wearing one of those ruined masks.

It wasn’t there when I took the picture.
I’m sure of it.

Since then, every night, I hear a sound at my window.
A soft sound, like… a balloon brushing against the glass.
