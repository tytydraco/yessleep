Christmas was around the corner and I hadn't gotten a damn thing for my younger cousin, Georgina. She was only about six years old at the time and she liked stuff similar to Mickey Mouse and Doc McStuffins. I had already gotten presents for the rest of my family, but my cousin wasn’t really difficult to shop for.

She really liked a recent show that was on television called ‘Bluey’, so when I got the chance to look for a present, I thought perhaps a Bluey DVD or a plushie from the show would have been perfect for her, since my aunt had told me that she liked to watch it after she would come back from school. 

I was very unfortunate because a lot of DVDS and other physical copies of movies were mostly sold out from a lot of stores, since it was the holidays, and I wasn’t going to take the chance on buying a DVD off the internet because I could not trust what condition it could be in.  I was beginning to give up until one day I heard a knock at my front door.

I was at home, still scrolling on the internet for a gift. I got up and opened the door and saw a black car driving away as quickly as it could. I looked down and saw a small package on my doorstep. It was wrapped in red-wrapping paper with numerous amounts of tape all around it. 

I picked it up and immediately opened it. There was something odd about what was in my hands. It was a Bluey DVD. But this wasn’t a copy I have ever seen before. It was just a plain DVD case with plain white paper within it. The cover it had was of two stick figurine sketches of dogs standing on two legs, and above them were letters that spelled out BLUEY in what looked like was made by permanent marker. On the back of the cover, there was a list of five episodes with titles:

Sticky gecko
-
Stumpfest
-
Daddy robot
-
Butterflies
-
Regret
-

I tried out the DVD on my DVD player and the first episode played and to my surprise, It looked like there was nothing wrong with what was in front of me. I thought I was given a miracle. The only thing that I found a bit off was the last episode’s title.
“Regret”.

On the DVD menu, the titles for choosing an episode were just
Episode 1. Episode 2. And so on.

The menu screen was in a gray color with white colored titles. After taking the time to make a final decision, I came to the realization that there was nothing really wrong with the DVD, I was going to give this to Georgina as a gift on Christmas. I changed the cover and found the proper art cover for the show and wrapped it up in waiting for christmas. There was really nothing I could have done to change the titles properly on their original names. 

But then again, there was really nothing wrong with what was in front of me. 

The day after Christmas took place, and everyone had a good time at the Christmas party. The next day I gave my cousin her DVD and she was so happy with what she had received. It then later came to me that she had not used the DVD yet. 

After new years, my parents and other relatives that were older than me went out for the evening, and had left me to babysit Georgina. I was paid with some takeout from my favorite fast food joint and watched my cousin until they would come back. Georgina then asked me to put the new DVD she had gotten.

I setted up the DVD player and inserted the disc. As I was in my room playing a computer game, from the living room I heard Georgina scream in terror. Immediately I got up and ran out of my room and Georgina came to me, she had tears in her eyes and hugged me. I looked up and to my surprise, on the screen, a creature of which I do not have a name for, was eating Bluey’s mother. The hideous deformed being was devouring her intestines. The next scene showed Bluey in tears, as she was hiding behind a wall of some kind. Immediately I grabbed the remote from the couch and turned off the TV.

I was able to calm Georgina down, trying to convince her that what she saw wasn’t real. Not long after she fell asleep on my bed. 

My conscience told me that what I saw on the screen was true, that it was no dream or from the imagination.  My parents send me a text message that read :

WE WILL BE OUT ALL NIGHT
TAKE CARE OF YOUR COUSIN

 So I took the opportunity to take a look at the DVD. I grabbed the disc and watched it on my computer but sat down in the living room.  The first four episodes seemed fine, but then I reached the final episode. The episode started with a word in white letters on a black screen. It read, REGRET.

In the next scene, Chili (Bluey’s mother) and her two daughters, Bluey and Bingo were in the hallway, running. The animation looked very different from its original. The only thing that made this animation uncanny was that none of the characters had mouths. Chili's left ear was cut in half and blood was bleeding out.  They ran to a room and Chili locked it behind her. Bluey ran and hid behind a dresser, and Bingo stayed with her mother. A loud roar was noticed by the three characters.

Bluey stayed behind the dresser and her sister and mom hid behind a closet door. A pale skinny looking-monster with white eyes and razor sharp teeth entered the room. It turned its head to look around the room, and immediately crawled out. Bluey took a peek from the dresser and saw her sister and her mother. Bluey had tears in her eyes. She then tried to slowly and quietly walk towards what was left of her family. The two female dogs tried waving their hands, giving her the signal for Bluey to stay where she was. 

All of the sudden, the creature rushed back into the room and went into the closet. The sound of screeching came from the darkness beyond the small room. The creature then dragged Chili’s deceased body out, as it began to devour the insides of her stomach.

Bluey remained hidden behind the drawer. The camera remained on the terrified blue dog. It then got quiet. Bluey remained still when suddenly the drawer was pushed away and the creature then grabbed her and ran out the room. The sound of the beast screeching came from the darkness of the hallway.

The screen went black and the word “Regret” popped out in white letters and Immediately I turned off my computer. I sat there and tried to understand what I just saw, I searched up the episode I saw and nothing came up. Someone had made the episode. I placed the DVD in an envelope and put it near the TV. The next morning, I woke up and went into the living room. My cousin was still asleep. I looked to where I left the DVD and noticed that It was gone. I then noticed that the front door was opened. I looked outside and found a black car outside, and this time, it slowly drove away.  I then looked down and found a once-folded piece of paper. I opened it and it read:

Merry Christmas,  
And I hope your cousin loved my video :)
