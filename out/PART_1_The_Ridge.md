About three years ago, I met a girl online through a dating app who fundamentally ruined my life. Her name was Jude.

She looked attractive enough in her photos, and her music tastes were a bit niche, but I knew some of the artists.

We shared similar hobbies. The only issue was she seemed to live quite far away from where I lived.

Not in the traditional "different state" sense. Her location on the app said she was in the middle of a forest that was a few hours away, and the forest itself was massive, spanning hundreds of miles.

We chatted back and forth casually at first, a little flirting, and some video calls.

After about two weeks of talking, she said she wanted to meet up.

We tried to organize a date, but she told me she didn't have her license, so she wasn't able to go anywhere unless she was picked up.

I thought this wouldn't be an issue. I was happy to make the drive and pick her up, but she took a video of where she lived, and it didn't really have a driveway, or really anywhere to drive a car.

I asked how they got groceries if they didn't have a car, or any place to even drive one.

She just changed the subject.

Eventually, after some brainstorming, she asked if I'd like to spend the weekend in her town.

I was a little skeptical that there could be an entire town in the middle of that forest, but she assured me that there was quite a large town, and they were all very friendly.

For some reason, this made me a little nervous. The thought of venturing to a place without roads, in an isolated town, in the middle of one of the biggest forests in the state.

I looked at the map on my phone. It was a four-hour drive as far as three quarters into the forest, where the roads stop at another small town.

I relayed this to Jude, who confirmed that once I had gotten to the town, I would need to make the trek into the forest. She told me it was only a four-hour hike, and if I really did want to meet her, I should make the effort.

I was kind of taken aback by this comment, but figured she might have just been upset that I wasn't considering it.

I asked if I was able to bring my brother Ethan, as I wasn't entirely comfortable making the trip alone, and I had been meaning to come up with an excuse to hang out with him anyway.

She agreed, and was actually rather enthusiastic about the idea.

I called my brother, and after some convincing, he agreed.

We scheduled a date for that weekend.



The morning of the date, I called my brother and let him know I'd be setting off soon.

I picked him up, nice and early from his apartment, and we set off on the long drive to the town at the edge of the forest.

I called Jude on the way and let her know that we were on the way. She told me that she and her brothers would meet us halfway and lead us to the town.

On the way, Ethan was voicing his reservations about the idea.

"Isn't it a little, like, you know, weird that she lives in the middle of the fucking forest and has reception?"

I shuffled in my seat, uncomfortable from the long drive.

"Well, if it's a town, it has power, right? And like, would need to be connected to the internet, so it's not really that much of a stretch that they would have reception."

Ethan sighed and leaned his head against the window.

When we finally arrived at the town, I parked my car in the small car park at the local store, and we grabbed our bags from the back seat.

"How long is the hike again? Like three hours?"

I checked the map and confirmed with a nod.

Before we entered the forest, we went into the local grocery store and bought some water and snacks.

At the counter, the old man eyed us carefully.

"Are you boys staying in town?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.

"Oh, no we're just..." I glanced at Ethan. "Uh, just visiting."

The old man shifted his gaze to Ethan, then back to me.

He lowered his voice.

"You're not going to the Ridge, are ya?"

"I'm sorry, sir, the ridge?" I asked, suddenly feeling the tension building.

He cleared his throat and looked behind us at the old couple who were also shopping.

He grunted and scanned our items.

As we were walking away, he said something that sent a shiver running down my spine.

"Watch out for the locals. They're not as friendly as they sound."

Ethan shot me a look and I shrugged it off.

We headed out into the edge of the forest.

The morning fog was rolling through, and I zipped my hoodie up. I could tell Ethan was more nervous. He kept screenshotting different parts of the forest on the map on his phone.

I messaged Jude that we were about to enter the forest, and then, reluctantly, we set off.

The tall trees and uneven ground made the first hour a rough walk. The further in we went, the tighter the spaces between the trees got, and occasionally we were forced to try and squeeze through the gaps.

At one point, we stopped, noticing something flapping nearby.

We walked over to it, discovering it was a torn white sheet, splattered in what looked like blood.

"That's fucking creepy, dude," Ethan said, crouching down, inspecting it.

I swallowed hard and suggested we should keep moving. The cold air was starting to give way as the warm afternoon sun crept in.

We crossed several small streams, and about an hour and a half in, we found a strange-looking building sitting abandoned in the middle of a small clearing.

Ethan stopped, looking at the building, then at me.

"I'm not going anywhere near that thing."

The building was actually rather intriguing. It looked like a house, but poorly built, wood overlapping and broken in places.

It looked like there were small additions sticking out of the top, like small makeshift rooms with spires. Half of the roof was covered in a faded blue tarp, and the windows were all shattered.

The front of the house was littered with random bits of wood. An old, painted fence, a pallet, several stacks of what looked like floorboards.

We could see through the doorway, since the door was lying about a foot away, buried under a pile of leaves.

Inside we made out a single wooden chair in the middle of the room.

"I agree with you," I said, making my way around the odd building. "Looks like a crazy person built it."

Ethan lingered for a second, staring at it, before taking a breath and following behind me.

We spent another hour and a half climbing over rocks, pushing through trees, and venturing over more streams.

As we climbed up a hill, Ethan gasped loudly behind me.

I turned and saw that he was pointing at something.

My breath caught in my throat as I saw three figures.

Two older men, wearing dirty, white button-up shirts and overalls, and a young woman.

Jude.

I let out a breath of relief.

"Jude!" I called out, climbing further up the hill.

"It's me, Thomas!"

Jude smiled and tilted her head.

"You made it!"

I was a bit confused by her appearance. She looked slightly younger than her photo on the app, and her eyes looked slightly more sunken in.

"These are my brothers, Cain and Isaac," she gestured to them.

The two brothers waved in unison.

I noticed Ethan wasn't moving forward.

I turned around and gave him a head nod to say, "You coming?"

He took a big breath and gave a forced smile, pressing forward.

We both made it to the top of the hill, and Jude wrapped me in a hug.

She smelt sweet, like lavender and something else I couldn't place.

"How far is it to the town?" I asked, taking a second to catch my breath.

She hummed a tune and then looked up at the sky. "About twenty minutes."

I looked at the brothers. Up close they were a lot more intimidating.

Both of them looked like they were at least six foot five, and they were both very large.

I looked at Ethan and tried to give him a reassuring smile. He just looked at me, and then the group, and lowered his head, pressing forward.

We made our way through a thicket of trees and down a larger stream that eventually connected to a lake.

Surrounding the lake were small cabins and houses dotted along the edges, and on the other side of the lake was a large, wooden church.

"Is this your town?" I asked, trying to catch up to Jude, who was walking quicker than I was expecting.

"Yeah, isn't it beautiful?" She beamed, jumping from one rock to another.

"Oh yeah, super quaint," I lied.

She led us into the town. A couple of the people in town stopped and looked at us as we walked through. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

We came up to a two-story house made of brick. It looked like it had been dragged and dropped from a suburban street.

"Wow, your house is so nice," I heard Ethan mutter behind me.

"Thanks!" she squeaked, unlocking the door and letting us in.

She gave an odd look to her brothers, who nodded and walked away.

I shot Ethan a quick look and he caught my gaze.

The inside of her house was very modern. The couches looked straight out of a catalogue, a massive flat-screen TV mounted to the wall.

Ethan lightly tapped my arm and nodded his head towards the photos on the wall.

There were a few unassuming photos of Jude, smiling.

And then there was a photo of Jude and an older-looking man, possibly in his mid-thirties, wearing a black button-up shirt, suit pants, and dress shoes.

Surrounding them were what looked like the entire population of the town, about twenty or thirty men, women, and children.

Jude moved past us as we lingered in the hallway and stopped at the staircase.

"Are you two hungry?" she asked, her eyes darting between us.

"I, well..." I stuttered.

"No, thank you, we've already eaten," Ethan answered.

"Oh, that's fine," she replied, her tone sounding slightly disappointed.

"So, do you live here alone or...?" I asked.

She laughed and lifted her arms in the air, her hair getting gently tangled in her fingers before falling back around her shoulders.

"I live here with my dad. He's like the mayor of the town."

"Oh wow, okay," I said, surprised.

"Yeah, he also runs our church," she continued, dancing her fingers around in the air.

"Where is he now?" Ethan asked, looking around the space.

"Probably... out." She let her arms fall to her sides before she started climbing the stairs.

"Come on!" she ushered us to follow her.

Ethan shot me a disapproving look and pushed me forward.

We both ascended the stairs after her, and she led us into a small corridor with a few rooms on either side.

She opened a door at the end of the hallway and held it open for us to walk in.

The room was a bedroom. Barely.

There was a small double bed in the corner and a small wooden desk.

I recognized it from the video calls we had, but had never paid too much attention to it.

There was a single painting on the wall, and it was actually kind of unnerving.

It was a painting of what looked to be a woman peeking over something. Only the top portion of her face was visible, from her nose upwards.

The eyes, in my opinion, made it worse. The woman didn't seem to have eyelids.

"Is this your room?" Ethan asked, looking out the window.

"Yep. Thomas, you will stay here with me." She winked playfully at me, only making me feel more uncomfortable. I dropped my bag next to the bed, stretching my shoulders.

"I'll show you where you will be staying," she said, pointing at Ethan and closing one eye.

He looked at me, nervously.

She opened the door and led us back down the hallway.

Jude opened another door a few doors down into an almost identical room.

This room, however, had another unsettling painting on the wall.

The painting portrayed a nurse standing at the end of a corridor facing away, in front of two people in the doorway. They were too far from the view to see their faces, but the entire painting was painted in a sickly yellow hue.

Ethan let the bag slide off his shoulders, and he put it next to the door.

"If you need extra blankets, let me know and I will find you some," Jude said, swaying in the doorway.

"Thanks," Ethan replied, sitting on the bed.

"Would you like to come on a walk with me, Thomas?" Jude asked, tracing her finger along my arm.

"I, well..." I looked at Ethan.

"It's okay, you go. I'll set up in here," Ethan said, giving me a reassuring look.

Jude took my hand. Her fingers were soft and smooth, and she pulled me back down the stairs.

"Where are we going on a walk to?" I asked nervously.

"I want to show you something!" She giggled softly as she opened the front door, letting go of my hand and ushering me outside.

The afternoon sun was beating down, and the air outside had gotten significantly warmer.

Insects buzzed loudly, and I could see a lot of the people in the town had dispersed.

"Where did everyone go?" I asked, making my way down the wooden steps.

"Probably... inside," she said, shutting the door and shuffling down behind me.

I looked up at the bedroom window where Ethan was, but I couldn't see up into the room.

Jude led me down the side of the house and over a stone bridge.

I had to take my hoodie off and wrap it around my waist. I was starting to feel sweat run down my back.

"Ooh! Can I wear it?" Jude asked, her hand tracing the hoodie.

"It's a bit hot. Are you sure?"

She tilted her head and pouted her lips.

I smiled nervously and handed her the hoodie.

She eagerly threw it on and zipped it up.

We walked further into the forest, climbing over rocks.

"Have you lived here long?" I asked, wiping sweat off my forehead.

"Since I was about six," she said, running her hands along the trees.

"Oh. Why did you guys move here?" I slowed, taking a moment to breathe.

She stopped and bit her lip softly. "My dad said it was important to his work."

"As a priest?" I asked, looking around the forest.

"Yeah, I guess," she replied, her voice trailing off, before she started moving again.

After a few minutes, we came into a massive clearing in the forest.

In the center was a huge wooden statue of something, but I couldn't make out what it was.

"What is this place?" I asked, catching my breath.

"This is our sacred grounds!" she said, looking at me, still smiling.

I hesitated before answering.

"Uh, it's very... beautiful."

I looked over at her and noticed she hadn't stopped staring at it. She was unmoving, unblinking.

I lightly tapped her on the shoulder.

"Earth to Jude," I said, laughing nervously.

She didn't even react. I leaned in closer to her face, noticing her eyes were twitching softly, like they were... buzzing?

I looked around nervously before she shook her head and turned around.

"We should go home now."

I didn't argue, just gave a weak smile, and we headed back into town.



The sun started to dip in the sky, softly muting the color of the entire town, bathing it in soft purple and red.

In the middle of the town was a crowd of people, and they were all standing around one person.

I recognized him from the photo in the house.

Jude's dad.

I released a breath I didn't realize I had been holding.

"What's going on over there?" I asked, pointing to the group.

Jude scrunched up her face. "Probably begging him for..."

She cut her own sentence short, pulling me toward the house.

I looked back at the crowd, watching the priest trying to move through the people.

Something I noticed sent a shiver down my spine. He was looking directly at us.



We headed inside and I saw Ethan waiting at the bottom of the staircase.

"How was your walk?" Ethan asked, shifting his weight nervously.

"It was good," I responded, watching Jude walk into the kitchen.

Ethan looked to make sure Jude couldn't see him and he ushered me over.

I shot him a confused look but followed him upstairs to his room.

He shut the door behind us and locked it.

"What's going on?" I frowned.

"There is something fucking freaky happening here." He ran a hand through his hair and looked out the window.

"Dude, what?" I asked, trying to look out the window.

He spun around and put his hands on my shoulders.

"Where the fuck is the power coming from? There aren't any power lines or generators!"

I took a second to think.

"Wait, what?"

He sighed, annoyed.

"The power in the house. We're in the middle of nowhere. Where is the power coming from?"

I hesitated, trying to picture it in my head.

"Maybe solar? Underground batteries?" I responded, shrugging.

"I stood at the top of the hill and looked at the house, dude. No solar."

I rubbed my eyes. "I don't... I don't understand."

Then we heard a loud knock at the door, and Jude's voice sang through.

"Hey guys! Dinner will be ready soon, and somebody wants to meet you!"
