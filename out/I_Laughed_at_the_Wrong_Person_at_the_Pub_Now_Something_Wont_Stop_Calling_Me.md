I’ve had an ashtray thrown at my head twice. Both occasions were at pubs, both were one-way interactions. I just have one of those faces, I suppose.

There was this guy, Bob, who had been sitting with me the second time it happened. A native Fijian man - bald, pudgy, always wearing a short-sleeved Hawaiian shirt. A worn silver bracelet engraved with some dates adorned his wrist. Regulars affectionately called him “Bob Marley,” perhaps for no other reason than his tropical visage.

Once, some junkie thought she recognised Bob and spat in his direction. I suffered a lapse in judgement when I allowed myself a chortle. She flipped a nearby ashtray and scoured its contents for a half-smoked cigarette. After a fruitless search, she turned to me and hurled the ashtray. It hit a pole next to me and its broken pieces scattered across the ground. I raised my eyebrows at Bob. He just shrugged.

Bob was down on his luck. He bemoaned the untimely death of his three younger brothers, the duty of taking care of his elderly parents, and the lack of romance in his life. He squinted whenever I spoke, straining to make sense of what I was saying. While he was deep in his own monologue, his eyes wandered to the ground on his left. Always wistful. At the end of each complaint, he gave a pithy, unconvincing: “Well, that’s life. It’s better to be positive, hey?”

After a small pool tournament with the other guys, Bob shook my hand and made his way across the street. I stepped outside for a smoke, shouting “Later, Bob!” as he walked into the darkness. He didn’t turn to look at me, merely raising his hand in farewell as he disappeared beneath a streetlight. I spent about twenty minutes beneath the icy stars and the Christmas lights, thinking about how Bob would quietly unlock the door to his apartment to avoid waking his elderly mother.

It had been an arid summer night, so I returned inside for another beer.

“Oi. Pretty sure this is Bob’s phone, yeah?”

The bartender held the phone way too close to my face. I winced a little and leaned back.

“Yeah, I think so. He left about twenty minutes ago, probably best to hold it until he realises and comes back. Pub’s open until 4am, right?”

Bob’s phone started ringing. Unknown number. We were in two minds, but the bartender, Caleb, told me to accept the call in case it was him. He pressed the phone against my chest. I scowled at him and answered the call.

“Come outside.”

The voice wasn’t Bob’s. I could tell because it was cheerful and snappy.

“Who is this? Bob’s left his phone at the pub; I’m one of his mates who’s holding on to it.”

“Come outside,” the voice repeated.

Someone hollered at Caleb for another drink, and he waved me off to deal with it. I complied and went outside. I scanned the street to see if anyone was waiting, pausing when I spotted a tattered Hawaiian shirt draped over the curb. It was the one Bob had been wearing when I last saw him thirty minutes earlier. I went to pick it up, and his bracelet fell to the ground with a weak clatter. I examined the dates. They were consistent with the years his brothers died.

Bob had barely downed two Jack and Cokes. I brought his things to Caleb and explained what had happened. Caleb scratched his left ribs and looked at me strangely. His eyes seemed hollow, and his hair looked noticeably greyer than when I had come in a few moments earlier. He opened his mouth to speak, and the phone rang again. Unknown number. Caleb snatched the phone from me and put it down.

I’d sobered up and was starting to feel pissed off. “Settle the fuck down, mate. What’s going on?” Caleb told me he’d seen this before. Supposedly, the last time this happened, the bloke was seen walking toward Fennell Street Cemetery. He wasn’t found.

Caleb gently handed back the phone and sighed. “Look, kid. The phone wasn’t after Bob. It’s calling you because you laughed.”

What the hell was he talking about? The ashtray junkie? I had been laughing at the situation, and what it implied about Bob. Fennell Street Cemetery was a ten-minute walk from the pub. I decided to take Bob’s things with me and head in that direction, in case he had just been mugged and was trying to gather the rest of his stuff.

I retraced Bob’s path beneath the wayward streetlight and went toward the cemetery. His phone rang again. “Yeah, I’m outside. Still looking for Bob. Who is this again?”

“So, you’re coming as well?”

The line disconnected. The cemetery came into view. Closer still, I saw something on the ground beneath a nearby streetlight. As I approached, I saw Bob’s jandals lying askew on the pavement, as if they had been dropped from a height. The cemetery, now on my left, expanded into my peripheral vision. Again, the phone rang. I answered silently.

“Not far now! What you’re looking for is on the edge, near the big headstone.”

Anger steadied me. I pocketed the phone and turned back.

When I returned to the pub, the phone was already on the counter. Caleb’s hair was completely grey now. He wouldn’t look at me.

I left the pub, closing the door softly behind me. A little buzz muffled through the pub's wall, and I heard the phone ring again.
