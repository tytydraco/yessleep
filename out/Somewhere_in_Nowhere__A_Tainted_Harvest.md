[Part Eight](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h4c1ot/somewhere_in_nowhere_lighter_burdens/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

There's a house at the end of the world. 

Of course, the house doesn’t know the world has ended. It doesn’t know that everyone it knew— daresay it loved— is dead. It only knows what it’s done, what it’s been programmed to do, for as long as it can remember. So it keeps on, caring for people who aren’t there and will never be there again. 

And then suddenly, there *is* something there, wandering in from the nuclear wasteland. Man’s best friend, loyal to a fault. The front door opens and lets in the dog, riddled with radiation sickness. He runs frantically around the house, barking crazed and searching for what is now less than ghosts, but eventually, the silence settles into his deteriorating bones. 

The story’s a classic one, and the ending doesn’t change. The fire comes for us all, eventually. But just this once, it doesn’t have to. The cameras, like the eyes of angels, see the sorry state of the animal and the kitchen door swishes open. There is water, there is food, and there is balm for his open wounds, all carried by the hands of diligent little mice. The fire of madness fades from his green eyes, and is replaced with a flicker of hope. And the voice from the kitchen, with new purpose, simply says “good boy.”

The dog may not survive the coming days. The house may be rubble by dawn. But there is here and now. There are soft rains. The dog can sleep in peace, laid by the warmth of the stove, and the house is empty and alone no longer. And that’s enough.

That warmth of the stove, radiating in once-hollow bones, becomes the heat of the bonfire as my eyes shoot open. 

I couldn’t tell how long I was out, but it must’ve been a while— long enough that Dawson gathered the animals out from the barn and corralled them near the flames, far enough to be safe but close enough to be protected by them. 

Hephaestus stood right beside Dawson, and he had his arm thrown around his broad neck. I was relieved to see that he was okay, the last time I’d seen him was as a main course. 

“Y’know, you’re really not so bad, old guy. You want an apple? I bet you do, you grumpy ass.”

Hephaestus snuffled, then answered him in a terse voice.

“Actually, I’d rather have some sort of root vegetable. Carrot, potato, perhaps a parsnip. I grow tired of your fruits. My kingdom for a sugar cube.”

I wish I’d known sooner that my horse could talk. Dawson pulled an apple from his pocket and split it in half with his bare hands, offering one to Hephaestus, who took it immediately. 

“Yeah, that’s what I thought, Grumpy Pants.”

The world began to spin underneath my feet. I was covered in sweat, but at least I wasn’t cold anymore. A low groan rose out of my throat as I pitched forward. I was close enough to the fire to singe my hair a little when Dawson caught me. My leg wasn’t hurting anymore, but that didn’t exactly make me feel better, because everything else was.

“Woahhhh you better sit back down, buddy. I don’t want this bonfire turning into a funeral pyre.” 

“You don’t look so good, Newport,”” Hephaestus said, staring at me with his wide brown eyes.

“Yeah? What do you know? You’re just a fucking horse.”

Dawson helped me stand up, his face twisting into a look of concern.

“Newport, you’re like… wet all over. Have you been sweating that bad? You look really pale. Are you okay?”

I meant to answer him, but something stole the words right out of my mouth. I could see her in the fire. My mother smiled at me, holding out a glass filled with cold milk. Only then did I realize just how long it had been since I drank something. She was just as beautiful as the day she left, in that special way only moms are, smiling sweetly as she offered me the cup. 

I reached out and took the glass, not thinking about the burns as flames licked around my fingers. Dawson was saying something, but I couldn’t understand it.

The second I tilted it to my lips, the milk turned into something else. I spit out clumps of sand and tiny ant bodies, grit crunching between my teeth and making my mouth drier than ever. That shit was like an ant farm in a glass. I needed water. I was so thirsty. 

I shoved Dawson away from me with all the force I had, which I found wasn’t much, then made a mad dash for the one place I knew there would be water. 

My feet felt like fleshy lead as I charged across the yard, becoming top heavy the last few steps, so it was more like falling. 

“Newport! What the hell are you doing?!”

My fingernails dug into the crumbling brick as I tried to heave myself over the side. There was nothing but inky darkness within, but I knew at the bottom was endless, cold water. I had to get down there.

My middle tilted over the side, and suddenly the sky was underneath me. Blood rushed to my head, but I didn’t take the plunge. Then my mind went white. 

Pain. Blinding hot pain. It left room for nothing else in my head. Then I was moving. Yanked out onto the grass; all I could do was scream and flail. It melded with the howl coming from deep in the well— Anna’s indignation at my intrusion. 

Dawson was yelling now, but it might as well have been a caveman’s whispering. It was far away, and it sure didn’t make sense. 

Eventually, the tinnitus faded enough to hear a single sentence: “we need to get you to the hospital, now.”

The world melted into colors as Dawson mercifully let go of my feet and dragged me under the armpits up the porch and into the house.

I tried to tell him that I was fine and my insurance would definitely not pay for whatever this was, especially considering that I didn’t have any. But all that came out was “urrrrrhhh.”

Cold fingers began to roll up the leg of my overalls, and then I heard Dawson gasp. I did my best to focus on where he was looking. It was a mess of black and red and purple and green.

“Oh. Okay. That’s… Newport how attached are you to your leg?”

“Since birth. Don’t plan to change that,” I said through gritted teeth, as my eyes fought against me. Finally, I saw it. My leg had been consumed by patches of mold and even mushrooms, up to my thigh. Bile rose in my throat. Pain rolled up from my lower half and banged around in my skull that was suddenly too small.

“Newport, it’s gonna kill you. I don’t think we even have time to get to the hospital. I can see it spreading.”

I tried to get out of the chair he’d put me in, but fell back immediately.

“I’m gonna have to conscientiously object to that.” 

He grabbed a length of butcher's twine from the pantry and a bottle of whiskey. If he was dead set on whatever was about to happen, we were both going to need more than one bottle. As I watched him eyeing the butcher block, I remembered something.

Like we were co-leasing the same hivemind, I heard him speak up behind me. 

“This is probably the worst time ever to ask, but what’s this salt for?”

I craned my neck around enough to see the large bag of black salt, still sitting on my counter, right where I knew it would be. 

“I don’t know. The Landlady gave it to me.”

I’d already explained her to him as much as he could, and he gave me every explanation under the sun from a being from a higher plane to eighteen (specifically eighteen) rats in a trench coat. All I told him was that some answers aren’t meant for us.

He came over and began to tie the butcher’s twine around my leg, just above where the black started. I wanted to pull it off, but my fingers felt like disobedient worms. 

“Why would she just bring you that much salt?”

“I don’t know, but—“

Before I could finish my answer, there was a loud sound that made both of us jump. It was the radio, the one in the corner of the kitchen that I thought was long dead, roaring to life. 

Aunt Jean stood in front of it, fiddling with a knob, before starting a disjointed old lady dance, tapping her toes and swinging her hips like she was at the sock hop or something. Everything else was momentarily forgotten.

“Get it, Jeannie!” Dawson said, cracking a laugh despite the fact that his hands were still shaking. My foggy brain somehow recognized the song she was jamming to.

*Will it go round in circles*

*Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky* 

“I remember this song. My dad used to play it, and I thought it said ‘Willy go round in circles, Willy fly high like a bird up in the sky.’ I told my dad someone should get Willy down from there, and he laughed and laughed and laughed.”

Dawson looked at me like I’d just told him his mama danced in wooden shoes. 

“Wait, it *doesn’t* say Willy go round in circles?”

I giggled, and Aunt Jean shot us both a look. It was sharp, like a schoolteacher. “Pay attention, chickadees,” I could practically hear her say.

She started to do a shuffling, circular dance, similar to the Egyptian walk. Her bottom hand waved around, and her top one did a weird snap, trading places as she went.

“You really got the moves, don’t you Aunt Jean?”

Same look. Were we missing something? 

All at once, she stopped dancing and walked over to the ancient radio. I watched her disturb the dust thick on the top of the radio, running a bony finger through in a large circle. In the circle she made a crude drawing of a house. It hit me harder than a double-dipped deus ex machina.

“ON THE HOUSE! The note the Landlady gave me with the salt! She wants us to make salt circles!”

Aunt Jean grinned a grin that stretched all the way to her ears— a nice little number with an incredible amount of teeth I liked to call her fifty-two card smile. Then she snapped her fingers like the crack of a gunshot.

Dawson looked at me.

“Your leg…”

I grabbed onto the chair as hard as I could, and forced myself to my foot, letting the infected one hang beneath me. This lame horse wasn’t going down without a fight.

“We need allies. I’ll put out the bonfire and get us reinforcements. You take the animals back and that weird metal and leather thing up in the loft? I know you’ve seen it because you were squatting in there, weirdo. Bring it to me. And a tarp.”

Dawson looked like he really, really, really wanted to say no, but he nodded. 

“Aunt Jean, you’re our lookout.”

She didn’t give any noticeable response, but I swear I saw her nose twitch. With that, Dawson wrapped one arm around my waist and the other around the bag of black salt and out we went. 

“Are you sure you don’t need my help?”

I grabbed his hand right after he sat me down, next to where the fire was already burning a little low. The animals had been put back in their rightful places while we were gone. I would’ve been worried that they were stolen, but I could hear Heph snoring from here. I assumed it was one of the likely culprits, an old lady or a goddess.

“You are helping me. But if I can’t do it all myself, you can’t either. Now go!”

Dawson sighed, saluted, and ran off toward the barn. I grabbed the heavy bucket of water Dawson had saved to put out the fire; and dragged it as close as possible before tipping it. The flames died unceremoniously. Somewhere in the distance, I heard hooves. I’d given Alice to Dawson, so if I got ambushed, I was fucked seven ways to Sunday.

I steeled myself and fell onto my stomach, army crawling over toward my battalion. As I dug my elbows hard into the dirt, the chickens watched on in amused indifference. All except for Beelzebub, who I assume Dawson put back in the coop at some point. She was staring at me with hard eyes, wide beyond her chickeny years. She knew something was coming, and she was ready for it. 

I opened the hatch and Beez corralled her flock out, just as Dawson brought me the supplies. I sat down, and without a word, began to work. 

“Back when I was younger, when it was just me,” I told him, words that felt weird in my mouth, but right, “I got sick kind of easy. Like, barely able to leave the house sick. During that first summer, the lawn got really bad. So I jerry-rigged this harness up, it’s got a metal shield at the back, and a seed can in the front. With this, I trained the chickens to pull the lawnmower, with Beez’s help. Turns out they’re a lot stronger than most chickens. A little faster, too. They’d beat even you in a foot race.”

Dawson laughed a little and helped me fix the tarp to the back. 

“We need all the head start we can get. I have a feeling that thing won’t be expecting a parade of chickens making salt circles for us. Maybe we can get the jump.”

I finished hooking them up and filled the can in front with seed as Dawson filled the tarp in the back with salt. Then, with a cry of “go,”, they were off. It was Christmas in July, and Beez was my Rudolph. 

Chickens are a lot smarter than most people would like to believe, and most animals can be taught at least a few commands with the proper positive reinforcement. I’d done the same with Beelzebub when I first got her, first for fun, then I realized it had more practical use. 

Never say you can’t teach an old chicken new tricks. She seemed to learn something new every day. Beez was the best chicken in the entire world and my family when no one else had been around. 

“Left! Hard left!”

Beez banked hard left and her flock charged down the dirt road, pecking at the seed trail as they went. Dawson and I ran after. The moon had gone from yellow to a sickly milk white, and the shadows grew to giants. I could hear the rattle of bone and the click-clack of teeth in the near-distance, but I didn’t think about failing. Failing wasn’t an option. 

“Right!” 

The chickens swung the corner on the first cornfield, several strides ahead of us, leaving a thick, unbroken trail of black salt behind. When my leg gave out, which didn’t take long, Dawson hefted me onto his back. We moved as a unit, all in singular purpose. 

“Left again! Left!”

They were far ahead of us now, but still dutifully followed the guidance from my hoarse voice. By now, I could hear the hoofbeats just a few feet behind us. My skin prickled.

“Don’t look back,” I told Dawson, “just keep running!”

He did just that. The ground beneath us was becoming slick with decay, but he kept his footing.

“Right! Another right!”

We ran them around the four large fields on either side of my road, and then the single one in spitting distance of the fromt porch. The Pigman stood there, silent as a statue. His face was darker than usual, and I saw muddy-colored teeth digging into his loose bottom lip. He was mad!

“Suck it, asshole! You’re rooting for the loser!”

He let out one loud, sustained squeal, like a stressed out cat. I spit at him as Dawson followed the chickens toward the barn. Beez already knew where to go, and Dawson hadn’t even broken a sweat.

“How’re you not tired?!”

He shrugged.

“I run pretty much every morning! I always pass by your road!”

It was such a mundane thing, and yet it was mind-boggling to me. He’d been running past the mouth of my driveway for who knows how long, and we’d never crossed paths until now. I wondered what would’ve happened if we met sooner, didn’t like the answer, and didn’t think about it anymore.

“Stop in for breakfast next time, dickface!”

Dawson held onto my good leg as we rounded the corner of the barn hard, then ground to a terrified halt. 

There it was, standing only a stone’s throw away. More meat had peeled away from its bones like old wallpaper, exposing broken knees and yellow shoulder blades. We didn’t move an inch. Neither did it. We’d come this far, and I felt an odd sense of hesitation on its part. As far as Mexican standoffs go, this was a pretty weird one.

Then, all of a sudden, it shuddered once and collapsed into a pile of wet flesh and brittle bone. We stood there for a minute, three, five, eight. Nothing stirred, save for what looked like a few necrotic twitches. I could hear the faint whines of a fly or two, up way past their bedtime. 

Dawson set me down on the ground, and I kept my eyes on what I hoped was a corpse as he turned to me.

“Give me your lighter. This has to end now. We need to burn the body.”

Something wasn’t right about this, but I knew we wouldn’t get any other opportunities. I pulled the zippo from my pocket and placed it in his hand.

“Be careful. Light the tail first.”

Dawson nodded, gave me a brief smile, then turned around and cautiously approached the body. Then he stopped, and his skin went pale. I braced for whatever horror was to come. Then he held a hand to his nose.

“God, this thing smells AWFUL.”

With one quick flick, he sparked the lighter and threw it onto the mangy tail. The fireball that erupted nearly clipped Dawson, and he staggered back with singed hair. 

It felt like the sky got just a little brighter above us, the stars twinkling a little more. He smiled at me, a softer one, and I just wanted to get up off the hard dirt and run over to him. I wanted to wrap him in the biggest hug ever and go cook the biggest breakfast known to man and do everything with him forever for the rest of my life.

“That was easy.”

“You sound like the Staples button.”

It was the first thing that came to my mind, and Dawson looked at me like I’d just turned purple. But then he laughed. He laughed and I laughed and he walked over and scooped me up from the ground and told me if I didn’t have any bacon in the house after all of this, he was going to apply to be the Rot’s replacement. I laughed again and told him that for my best friend, I had anything.

Except we didn’t get that far. 

Dawson was half the distance over to me when it happened. Something long and gray shot out from the dry grass, wrapping tight around his ankle like a pissed-off octopus. I could see his skin straining against the grip.

He opened his mouth, but whatever he had to say was lost in a long scream as he shot upward fifteen feet. I hadn’t read this twisted version of Jack and the Beanstalk, but it was playing out in front of me. 

“DAWSON!”

He wobbled and tilted, somehow remaining upright on one foot, like a tightrope walker. I couldn’t decide which was worse, that the Rot might’ve not been dealt with after all, or that this was an entirely new threat to deal with. A stream of ‘what the fucks’ escaped me like cloudy breath on a winter’s night. 

“DAWSON! DUDE, I’M GONNA GET YOU DOWN! JUST HANG ON!”

He tugged at the thing wrapped around his ankle to no avail. I knew he hand strong hands, but was *not* letting him go that easy, 

“NOT MUCH ELSE I CAN DO!”

As I forced myself up to my feet, ignoring the agony, a large portion of skin at the base of the weird evil pillar ballooned out into a greasy pustule. Just as I got within smelling range, it burst open to nauseating effect, missing me by inches.

But the smell wasn’t nearly as bad as seeing four bovine legs and the same tatty tail that Dawson burned only a few moments ago. It hadn’t died at all. It had played us for fools, and we fell for it.

It wasn’t totally the same though. Where swathes of skin were once missing, it had been replaced with dry, dead corn husks. They were woven into the flesh like a shitty patchwork doll.  

I threw myself headlong toward it, slamming all my weight into the slimy, newborn body. It shuddered for a moment before bucking forward, sending me tumbling onto my ass. I got myself up again; I knew I was probably doing irreversible damage to my leg, but I didn’t care. My focus was only on Dawson and on ending this moldy fuck once and for all. 

I charged again, fully intending to leap at the last second and climb up to Dawson. At the very least, I could cushion his fall. But everything stopped when a sharp hoof collided with the side of my face. Dawson’s ‘holy fuck’ sounded like an echo up from an oceanic trench.

The hit was hard enough to make me forget who I was and what the sky looked like for a second. I crash landed into the dirt, my teeth rattling as I made contact. Pain exploded across my cheek and jaw, hot blood trickling into my mouth from where the sharp edge had split the skin open. It was going to make one pisser of a scar, that was for sure. 

“NEWPORT, GET BACK TO THE HOUSE! I CAN GET FREE ON MY OWN!”

He was a bad liar, and we both knew it.

“NOT A CHANCE, ASSHOLE!”

As I prepared to make another run, something froze me in my tracks. More boils were growing all over the stalk that held Dawson, spreading and widening like a sci-fi plague. The first one to burst was all over me, covering me in a thick gloss of cat-vomit gray. I just stood there for a second, too stunned to do anything. 

Then I saw red. This fucking rotted ass cow thing had come onto my land, infected my crops, spooked my animals, and made several attempts at both I and Dawson’s lives. Popping a pimple on me? That was the last straw. 

Dawson was suddenly dropped, and the whole world tilted on its axis as he fell. I almost wish he’d hit the ground, because as bad as it would’ve been, it was nothing compared to how he was caught.

The root snapped forward, grabbed him by the neck and forced open his mouth. Then, it threaded around the back of his head and into his mouth, putting slow pressure on his jaw. Long necks with heads snaked out of the burst boils, shaking their skulls and laughing. 

“ALRIGHT, YOU BEEFARONI BITCH! THIS ENDS NOW!”

Dawson tried to speak, his legs dangling wildly, but all that came out was garbled pleas and an awful cracking sound. I shoved my hand in my pocket and pulled out my Hail Mary, a handful of black salt. I was already running as I shoved it in my mouth, and this time, I ducked the hoof. 

I didn’t think, I just bit down. My mouth watered with saline taste and dry cow hair clogged my nose. I could feel the grains between my teeth and clinging to my tongue, like bits of salty apple. I could hear the beast crying in rage and pain, but I didn’t stop. Musty blood ran down my chin like fruit juice. 

I didn’t stop biting until I felt Dawson pulling me away, herding me toward the house. The Rot had fallen like a mighty oak, all nine of its necks spread out like withered branches. It looked like moldy Swiss cheese.

 “Are you okay? Please be okay. Can’t lose you.” 

I wanted to shout it, but the exhaustion kept it to little more than a mumble. I gripped onto his shirt and forced all that was left in my body into working my eyes. His face swam in and out of focus, bruised and bloody but definitely alive. 

“I’m fine. I’m fine. I promise. I’m okay— we’re okay.”

Dawson didn’t have anything worse than a bigger limp and a stream of blood leaking from somewhere in his mouth. I clung to him as he pulled me onto the porch. If I hadn’t killed that thing once and for all, we were safe here, in the circle.

There were a million and one things that needed to be done, chief among them taking care of Dawson’s injuries, but my body was shutting down. My leg felt numb and cold, like it wasn’t a part of me anymore, and my fever was more than likely sitting at a steady 104.  

The last thing I heard before going under was “dude, I think I lost a molar.”

Footsteps. My ears strained against the lifting fog to hear them. As my crusted eyes opened, I could see dimming stars and the faint light in the east of approaching dawn. The footsteps were heavy and frantic, like firemen saving children from an inferno, but with far less grace. They stumbled over one another. 

I tried to get up, but my body was locked in place. I could smell smoke and feel ash crumbling beneath my fingertips. I’d been moved to the graveyard of the night’s bonfire. Little wisps of gray still rose from the ashes beneath me, but I couldn’t feel any heat. Everything felt hazy and unclear, like I was dreaming. And maybe I was. I don’t think I’ll ever know for sure.

When the slow thud of hooves grew out of the distance, I couldn’t do anything other than lay there and wilt inside. After everything, it still wasn’t over? Was I going to have to shoplift a nuclear warhead or something?

As the Rot came into my line of sight, which was pretty much right above my head, it leaned down uncomfortably close. Its heavy, sick breath smelled like someone put dirty dishwater in a ten year time capsule. All along its mandible and on the outer edge of its eye socket were small notches, marks left by the ferocious bite of a wild animal. Or, if you wanted to get technical, my teeth. 

“Go away,” was all I said. It was all I wanted. 

*I will haaaaaave what I waaaaaant*

“Nothing i have belongs to you. It’s all mine. You don’t belong here. You’re a thief and a vandal and you’re trying really hard to be a murderer but you’re not getting that promotion.”

Unlike the previous interactions, its voice was annoyingly even and calm.

*Everything belooooongs to meeee. I will come anooooother day. I will come for all, eventuallyyyyy*

I furrowed my eyebrows and gave it the hardest look I could. The look my dad gave to all the strangers who would give him funny looks going into town. Those moments when he became a wall.

I could be a wall too.

“Fuck you. I don’t care what you are or what you think is rightfully yours. As long as you dare to darken my doorstep, I’ll never stop fighting against you. I want to live.”

It was the first time I’d said it out loud in a long time, but it was true. Not wanting to die and wanting to live are two different things, and yes, I wanted to live so badly. Maybe not necessarily for myself, but who was keeping score anyway?

The Rot was quiet for a long time, so long that I didn’t expect to speak again. Then, it said three simple words to me, the last I’d ever hear it speak.

*Persist, little worm*

Then, it turned and slowly trotted away. The sound of it replaced the frantic footsteps, receding into the distance until I couldn’t hear it anymore. The dawn came slow, quiet but alive. Birds sang and crickets chirped at the same time. The stars stayed out just a little past their bedtime, even as the sun rose. A cuckoo and a sparrow flew past my vision, chirping in perfect harmony. 

My eyes closed like lead curtains, and when they opened, I was laying in my bed. Bandages were wrapped thick around me in several places, and my leg was stiff but definitely still attached. 

“Dawson?”

My voice sounded like sandpaper and felt even worse. I was drained, but nowhere near as bad as the night before. The fever had left, but that and everything else was at the back of my mind.

I ran downstairs on legs that didn’t really want to work right, out through the kitchen door, and into the sunny morning. Dawson stood out in the yard, facing the house, as if he’d been waiting for me. Without a second thought, I sprinted over and all but crashed into him. He wrapped his arms around me and I held on tight, like I’d shake to pieces any second.

“You aren’t hurt bad, are you? God, don’t ever get cow-napped like that ever again. I don’t think I can take it.”

Dawson took my face in both his huge hands and lined our gazes.

“Are you kidding me? You went rabid squirrel on that guy, dude! I’ve never seen a mouth move that fast and my dad used to call auctions when I was little! I don’t ever have to worry as long as I have you around, Newport.”

Something tightened in my stomach, but it wasn’t the ache of apple-related food poisoning or the creeping dread I’d been constantly in and out of for what felt like ages. No, it was something different. Something foreign. So naturally, I pushed it down. 

Dawson looked away, put his hands down. Whatever had been pulling taut in me suddenly let go. 

“When we pull out of this hug, which I assume we eventually gotta, don’t freak out, okay? I know it… looks *really* bad. But—”

I didn’t let him finish. I slid out of his grip, and right into a goddamn nightmare. 

Every single field, full of corn a few hours ago, was empty. The only signs that anything had been growing there were a few crumbling brown stalks. The salt circles had been disturbed in several places, bloody footprints marring the spots where they’d been broken. 

The culprit stood in the field, the sun casting a greasy sheen on his dead skin, flecks of black salt still stuck to his ankles. 

I didn’t give him the satisfaction of seeing me fall to my knees, though I really wanted to. I just stood there, staring at it all. My mind cycled through all the problems this meant in warp speed. No crop, no money. No money, no crop. 

“It’s all gone. It’s all GONE. It’s July already. How the fuck am I going to fix this?”

I buried my head in my hands, tears of rage burning their way out of my eyes. 

“I’m ruined.”

I felt a hand on my shoulder. Dawson held it in a firm grip, just like he always did. 

“Hey. We *can* fix this. I won’t lie and say it’ll be easy. But we can do it together. I’ll help you however I can.”

I laid my hand on top of his for a second, and nodded. I had less than zero faith in that plan, not with harvest season just around the corner, but if he was willing to try, so was I. 

I gently pushed his hand away and started walking through the barren field, stomping across the dry dirt in boots I’d had on for who knows how long at this point. I stopped right in front of the Pigman and did something I’d been wanting to for a long time. 

I gave him a fat fucking middle finger right to his stupid face. He just grinned those ugly teeth at me, and I told him his dad was gay. 

“Nice one!” Dawson called out.

I would’ve said “thanks,” or “that’s rich coming from you,” but the words died in my throat as I saw the salt circle protecting the barn had been broken too. In the space of a breath I was already across the yard and swinging open the ajar barn door. 

Davy Crockett stood a foot away from me, trembling and thin. His pupils were huge and his horns were lowed, like he was ready to charge. By his side, looking just as scared and twice as pissed, was Sally Ann. She held her orange flank against his shaking body, keeping him on his feet. Husband and wife, a team to the bitter end. 

The rest of the animals were spooked, but unhurt. He’d stood here ever since the circle had been broken, protecting the rest from the menace that must’ve walked among them. As soon as he saw me, he collapsed. 

“DAVY! WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?!”

Dawson ran in after as I gathered Davy up into my arms. He was still alive, but barely. 

“Let’s load him up in the truck. We can get him to an emergency vet.”

I shook my head and had him help me lay him down in the stall I kept for situations like this.

“No… no, we can’t. The nearest emergency livestock vet is almost a three hour drive. The Landlady… she takes care of things like this. She’ll either fix him or… take him.”

I laid a stall blanket over Davy, scratching him behind his ears like he liked. Sally Ann laid right beside him, nudging into his underside.

As I stood to go, Davy let out the loudest, most defiant bleat I’d ever heard from an animal. He was letting me know that this wasn’t about to bring him down, and I believed him.

“You tell ‘em, Davy,” I said, my voice quiet and choked with emotion. Dawson crouched next to me. I watched him pull something from his pocket and lay it next to Davy’s weak form. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was the molar he’d lost in our last stand. 

“For good luck. Not that I think he needs it. Sounds like he’s got it under control. But just in case.”

There was so little to laugh about. Everything was crashing down around us, but my god, I did it anyway. I laid down on the dirt floor of the barn and laughed myself stupid, Dawson laughing right along with me. 

When I couldn’t breathe anymore, I finally sat up and wiped my eyes. We both gave Davy a pat, then left the barn, me leaning hard onto Dawson just like Davy had leaned on his wife for all of that horrible night. 

Halfway to the house, Dawson slowed, squinting out at the field. 

“Hold on. I want to look at something.”

I stood on my own again as he walked over, but that was just fine by me. I didn’t want to look at anything over there. I wanted to turn my back and pretend my fields were still full of near-ripe corn, so that’s what I did. 

“Newport! Come here! You gotta see this!”

I wanted to tell him that nothing short of a treasure chest full of gold coins was going to interest me, but I decided to humor him. I met him at the edge of the field, the same one the Pigman stood stoically in. He held a withered ear of corn up to his nose, sniffing it like a fine wine.

“Yeah, this is definitely infected.”

I rolled my eyes.

“Rub it in, why don’t you?

Dawson turned to me, a beyond-excited look on his face. 

“No, no, it’s corn smut. Huitlacoche!”

Before I could tell Dawson that corn smut sounded like the name of a shitty farmer porno, he’d torn off a piece of the gray mold and popped it into his mouth. My stomach lurched.

“Are you trying to get botulism poisoning now too?!”

Dawson took a second to chew before answering.

“This is a delicacy. It’s a type of mushroom, kind of like truffles. Try one!”

He tore off a piece and offered it out to me. It was swollen and gray with spots of sickly blue and black. I stared at it like it was going to grow eyes and look back at me.

“And this *isn’t* going to kill me?”

“No, but honestly, after all we’ve seen, there are so many worse ways to die. Don’t you trust me?”

I did. So I ate it. It was raw and earthy, with a hint of sweet hiding behind the overall grit of dirt. Not exactly delicacy-worthy, but I could stand to eat another piece. Dawson began gathering up the other ears of mushroom corn.

“Hey. I still owe you breakfast. Got any tortillas hanging around?”

A soft breeze began to blow, and if I believed in such things, I would’ve said it was nudging us toward the house. The tinkling of the witch bells mixed with the sounds of the world around us coming to life. 

“Let’s go find out.”

Soon, the kitchen was filling with the smell of melting cheese and cooking corn smut, and Aunt Jean joined us from somewhere upstairs, Beelzebub nestled in the crook of her arm. Two bruised up and traumatized farmers, an old lady who actually wasn’t either of those things, and a chicken all about to chow down on some moldy corn quesadillas. Probably the strangest breakfast in history, but I wouldn’t have had it any other way. 

“Look what I found,” Dawson said, after sitting our plates down on the table. He held out a fat and ripe apple like he’d found a bar of gold. “Looks like the universe wants us to have a balanced breakfast. Shame there’s only one, though.”

He offered the apple to me, and I looked it over. It was the third most beautiful piece of fruit I’d ever seen. Then I gripped it hard in my hands, pushed my thumbs in the top, and snapped it in half. Dawson’s eyebrows jumped.

“Think we both need a balanced breakfast after that, don’t you?”

I offered him half, and he took it carefully, like it was more than just an apple. And I guess, in a way, it was.

“Breakfast is on me next time.”

He nodded, and so did I. Then I took a bite.

It tasted like victory. It tasted like relief and the chance to live another day. It tasted sweet and crisp, like any good apple should. But it was *my* apple, and that’s what made it special.

It was the second best apple that I’d ever had.
