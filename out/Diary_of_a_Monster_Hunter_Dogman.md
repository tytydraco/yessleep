Hi there, I'm White Wolf; that's my codename, and I'm a monster hunter.

 I work for a certain organization in the European branch, and I will tell you about one of my experiences with dogman hunting.

 Last week, I was assigned to investigate the suspicious deaths of cattle.Corpses were torn to pieces. 
This incident was in the Balkans, but I will not say in which country due to confidentiality reasons.

For this task, I received help from two local hunters.
 When we arrived in the village, the villagers told us that the police were there and that they told them that it was a wolf attack.

 When we got to the house where it happened, we contacted the owner. 

The owner let us into the yard; luckily for him, he wasn't there that night, so nothing happened to him. 

 We found the corpses in the barn. The slaughter was too messy for the wolf attack; there were giant wolf-like tracks everywhere, which can only mean two things: a werewolf or a dogman. 

They couldn't be werewolves because, in most cases, they are pacifists, and they have the same intelligence whether they are in human or werewolf form. 

Then only the dogmen remain as suspects.
Dogmen have a human body and the head of a dog, and their body is covered with black fur that looks like rottweiler fur. 

They are so dangerous that according to the protocol of the organization, dogmen should be killed on sight. We spent the night in the village. 

The next morning, we started combing the forest, where we spent a few hours. 

By pure luck, we came across the dogman's den relatively quickly. So we went back to my truck to get the bait.

A freshly killed deer works best. We placed it about four meters from the den, and we set ourselves up in relatively good positions and waited for the night.

 Luckily, the place where the den is located is quite illuminated by the moonlight, so we waited until they came out of the den and started to eat.
 
About ten dogmen came out: six adults and four cubs. Two separated quickly because they smelled us and tried to surround us so that we had to open fire on the others. 

We killed most of them, but a few cubs ran into the den. A few seconds later I heard a scream from my right, then a shot, another shot, an inhuman scream, another shot, a scream, and then total silence. 

And then I heard someone running from my left side, so I took out my trusty KSG-12. I was lucky to see something black pass by, so I fired a slug shell. I heard a hit and that horrible scream. 

then it jumped at me, and I was quick enough to fire, and I hit it in the head, killing it instantly. I got up and went to the place where the hunters were, and I saw that the first one was killed when his throat was slit.

 The other was bitten between the shoulder and the neck; he bled relatively quickly, and a dead dogman was lying next to him. 

Then I entered the den, and I found cubs in the part where they give birth. I raised the rifle, switched it to the buckshot, and shot all the cubs. After that, I went out to the clearing and waited for the cleaning team to come.
