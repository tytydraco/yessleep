The site was called The Artist’s Crypt. The team had found it by accident during a 3D scan, in an experiment to see if the new tech could help explore subterranean spaces. What they came up with, deep within some innocuous cave off a hiking trail in Northern Arizona, was a twisted system of man-made tunnels covered ceiling-to-floor in cave paintings.

I panted as I pulled myself through a narrow opening in the slick black rocks. My breaths echoed in the cold darkness of the cavern, the light of my headlamp dancing on the glistening walls.

“We’re about sixty feet below now,” said Kenya, the lead archaeologist, gesturing for her team of half-dozen to slow down for me. “Ready to see the paintings?”

“Ready,” I breathed, trying not to count the tons of earth over our heads.

As we ducked and climbed through the winding rock cave, the ground finally began to level out beneath our feet. The murmurs of the archaeology team walking ahead echoed off high ceilings and walls, all smooth and polished through layers upon layers of sedimentary rock. Kenya turned the large flashlight upward.

“Here we are,” she said. “This is the beginning of the Artist’s Crypt.”

I followed the flashlight, and beheld a painting of a scale I had never seen before. Hundreds of birds had been painted onto the high walls and ceiling of the rectangular cavern. Inky black paint silhouetted dense flocks of feathers and wings, captured mid-flight in a chaotic dance. Near the floor of the chamber, two dozen long-legged animals with branching antlers were painted in a color resembling that of rust, leaping and bounding with their heads held high.

“That’s… quite something,” I muttered.

“Yep,” Kenya said. “We’ve been calling them the birds and the deer. We need someone more enlightened in the ways of animal silhouettes to tell us otherwise.”

“Birds and deer is fine,” I said, half-absently. “The birds look like ravens, and the stags are mule deer, possibly. They’re native to North America.”

Kenya nodded more thoughtfully than my cursory hypotheses should have warranted. I took a short breath.

“More importantly, though, you said…”

“These paintings move,” Kenya said. “Or at least, they seem to. Watch them for a while, and you’ll notice.”

The half-dozen archaeologists with us began setting down their packs, unfolding a foam tarp in the middle of the room and sitting to rest their legs. Kenya joined them and motioned for me to sit as well.

“Focus on a spot. Choose a raven. Watch it carefully.”

I turned my gaze upward toward one of the black painted ravens, one close to a corner where the walls and ceiling met. Its wings were curled in a down-stroke, its beak half-open as if in the middle of a cry. Silence echoed through the chamber for minutes on end as I watched intently, and just as I began to doubt Kenya and the crew’s absurd proposition, I noticed that the raven’s beak had closed.

“It moved,” I gasped. “I missed it, but it must have moved. The beak…”

Kenya allowed me to watch for another ten minutes or so, and I slowly realized how the painted animals were moving just beneath my threshold of perception, barely slow enough for their motion to go unnoticed, where I blinked and their position had undergone another infinitesimal change. I watched, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, as the ravens and the stags crept along the walls, wings wavering, antlers swinging, hooves glancing upon the imaginary floor of their painting.

“I need to get a closer look,” I muttered, getting to my feet.

“The stage is yours,” Kenya said. “The whole place is filled with paintings just like this. Thirteen individual chambers, with more or less the same kind of art. Just give me the word, and we’ll take you through all of ‘em.”

I walked up to the wall of the cavern and looked closely at the ruddy red paint comprising one of the stags.

“Am I allowed to touch things?”

Kenya wrinkled her nose. “Can you put on gloves?”

“Sure.”

Kenya handed me a pair of latex gloves. I slipped them on and raised my hand to touch the damp stone wall with my fingertip. Slowly, I slid it over the border of paint and stone, feeling the cool and ever-so-slightly soft texture of the stag, muted through the glove but enough to give me a hint. I brought my face up close, until my eyes were inches away, shining my headlamp at different angles to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. Kenya and her crew followed me with their eyes as I walked back to my pack, produced my portable microscope, and put it up to the wall.

Under the tiny LED light of the scope, I could just make out the edges of the paint wavering, curling, expanding and contracting.

“It’s alive,” I said quietly. “The paint, it’s an organism.”

“Like… a real deer?” Kenya asked.

“No. If I were to guess, the paint itself is a culture of microorganisms, like a fungus, or a lichen.”

All eyes were on me. I fidgeted under the gaze, but I was sure of what I had seen.

“A *fungus*? Why would a fungus grow in the shape of a deer?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted, “but I can try to find out. Would you help me gather some samples to take back to my lab?”

==========

Yuka, my grad student and lab assistant, was the first to theorize that the newly discovered paint-fungus flourished on the walls in the Artist’s Crypt for a reason.

“The hematite-rich substrate that covers the walls is like food for the microorganisms,” he said, peering down his microscope. “The fungal growths can survive in sunlight and dry climates, but try taking them away from the rock and, for instance, putting it on agar. Withers within a day.”

He rolled his chair aside and gestured for me to take a look. I looked into the microscope and examined what had been a petri dish planted with red fungus last night. The microscopic leafy growths had turned gray, and their branching threads crumbled into segments.

“Same happens with the black fungus,” Yuka said. “All the samples are dead, save for the ones that had bits of rock chipped off with them.”

I grunted. “Looks like we’ll have to ask the archaeologists for a whole slab of rock covered in the stuff.”

My phone rang. I waved for Yuka to carry on without me and stepped out into the hallway.

“Hello?”

“Hey, Doc. It’s Kenya. About the Artist’s Crypt. A stag is eating a raven right now.”

I blinked. “A… what?”

“One of the painted stags is eating a painted raven right now. Come down to the site. I need you to see this.”

==========

Half an hour later, Yuka and I sputtered onto the site in my old pickup truck. Kenya paced by the entrance to the cave.

“Come on. We don’t know when it’ll be over.”

“Is the team filming it?” I asked, unloading the bags of lab equipment.

“Yeah, but not under a microscope.”

Kenya led me and Yuka down the rock tunnel again. The sunlight and the summer heat receded above, and before long the chill of the underground took over. Kenya descended the jagged knots of rock briskly, far more trained in traversing this cavern than Yuka and I were. We struggled to keep up. Yuka coughed, panting. I asked Kenya to pause as he fumbled his asthma inhaler from his pack.

“Sorry,” he coughed.

“Take a break if you need it,” Kenya replied. “My bad. We’ll take it a bit slower.”

We continued through the caves and met up with the team in the Artist’s Crypt. The tangle of crows and stags covering the walls looked the same at a cursory glance, but I was sure each individual crow and stag must have moved around the room several times over the last couple of days. Yuka marveled at the walls, even as his breath caught in his throat.

“You okay?”

“Yeah,” he coughed. “This place… it’s so big.”

“Look here,” Kenya said, pointing.

On the far side of the wall, a stag was bent over something in its mouth, a tangle of black painted feathers and the last vestiges of a pointed beak wide-open in a silent cry.

“Deer aren’t usually carnivorous, right, Doc?”

I shook my head and stepped closer to the stag.

“Yuka, the microscope.”

Yuka, who had retreated to the foam tarp to catch his breath, handed me my field scope. I put it up to the wall, its lens on the boundary between the stag’s open mouth and the crow. Looking through, I saw the undulating movements of the leafy red fungus as it advanced on the slick black fungus like a living hedge wall, tiny structures in the leaves opening and closing like some crude mimicry of mouths and swallowing up the black cells.

“Stags aren’t carnivorous, but fungi can be. I think this ‘painting’ is an ecosystem.”

==========

Kenya reluctantly allowed me to chip off some sections of the wall and bring them to my lab, and in the next few weeks, Yuka and I were able to more or less piece together the aspects of the black ravens and red stags that could be explained by known science.

The black fungus - which we casually called the *raven bug* \- was a primitive organism that fed on the iron deposits in the rock walls and spread through *mycelial reproduction*: essentially splitting its threads into pieces that grew into more ravens. Reproduction was rare and difficult to catch with the naked eye, given the ravens were always flocking and overlapping with each other, but through careful rewinding of video footage, Kenya’s team found about one instance of reproduction per day in the Crypt. We could also induce reproduction by fragmenting the colony and letting it grow on an iron-rich substrate; given enough time, full ravens grew out of pieces as small as 100 microns in width.

The red fungus - the *stag bug* \- was slightly more advanced, and carnivorous. Like the raven bug, the stag bug was dependent on the rocky walls of the Crypt, but it also needed a richer form of nutrition. Once in a while, a colony of stag bugs would rapidly reorient their mycelia - giving the stag painting the impression of jumping - and latch onto a colony or raven bugs, which they dragged down the wall and consumed. We had yet to witness a stag - or a colony of stag bugs - reproduce.

“These fungi maintain their predator-prey ratio at almost exactly 0.10,” I said. “An ideal ratio for the typical sustainable ecosystem. Curiously enough, even the macroscale ‘paintings’ they make up - the stags and the ravens - adhere to this ratio; as of September fifteenth, there was a total of 258 ravens and 26 stags on the walls of the chamber.”

The small crowd of scientists from the Natural History Association, sitting on the chairs and floor of my lab like preschoolers before their teacher, nodded and scribbled in their notepads. One raised his hand. Linkin Lay, the executive director, gracing my humble lab with his presence.

“Yes?”

“I have a question,” he said, scratching his chin. “*The* question. Why do these fungi arrange themselves into these shapes? Ravens and stags… those should mean nothing to a primitive microorganism.”

I pursed my lips. “We don’t know. But we’re continuing our research in the hopes of finding out.”

Dr. Lay nodded, his brows furrowed in thought. The scientists flipped through the report Yuka and I had put together the night before.

“Very interesting,” Dr. Lay muttered. “Very, very interesting. Please continue your research, Dr. Solomon. I would love for us to collaborate on this research moving forward.”

After the scientists left, I dialed up Yuka.

“It went well!” I announced happily. “Maybe a bit of funding will come our way, finally.”

The line was silent.

“Yuka? Hello?”

I waited, and just when I started to think Yuka couldn’t hear me, he spoke quietly.

“*That’s great, Prof.*”

“Yuka? Is something wrong?”

Rushes of static buzzed against the speaker, like wind or heavy breathing.

“I… I can’t hear you very well,” I said. “Where are you?”

The static grew louder, louder, then quieted.

“*The roof,*” Yuka said softly. “*I’m on the roof. The sunlight-*”

“What?”

“*The sunlight, Prof. It hurts. It’s so bright, but I need to fly…*”

Something was strange. His voice.

“*I can fly.*”

A pit opened in my stomach, an inexplicable dread I couldn’t reason out. I left my lab and paced uncertainly down the hall to the door to the stairwell. Then I pushed open the door and began climbing.

“Yuka, what are you doing on the roof? I’m coming up, okay? Wait there.”

“*Don’t… bother…*”

Sharp static clattered from my phone, before the line went dead.

“Yuka? Hello? *Yuka!*”

My voice echoed up and down the stairwell. It was four full flights of stairs up to the roof, which I jogged up at first, and then started sprinting up as my confusion morphed to fear. Panting, legs aching, I flung open the door to the roof, flooding the stairwell with the afternoon sunlight.

Something flew against my ankle. A lab coat and a blue shirt, taken off all as one and discarded. On the far side of the roof, Yuka was standing precariously on the old rusted railing, his bare back turned to me, his hair ruffled in the wind.

At first glance, it looked like black feathers had grown out of his arms and wrapped around his back. At second glance, the feathers looked painted on.

“*Yuka!*”

He tilted his head back to look at me. His lips were twisted in a pained smile, tears streaking down his cheeks.

“Professor… It hurts…”

On his back, the feathers seemed to writhe. Recoiling from the sunlight, warping skin with them.

“Yuka,” I gasped. “What- what happened? Get down from there.”

I put my hands up and stepped slowly toward him.

“*No!*” he hissed, a kind of voice I had never heard from him before.

“Yuka, please-”

“*Stay away. And watch me, Prof.*”

“-I don’t know what’s wrong, but-”

“*I can fly. I always could…*”

Before I could think to do anything, he spread his arms and stepped off the railing into the open air.

I screamed his name, but screams don’t save people from eleven-story falls.

==========

*Solomon Microbiology Lab. Professor Tina Solomon. Yuka Tabachi.*

I stared at his name on the plaque on my lab door. Afternoon sunlight filtered through the dusty windows.

Yuka’s parents had demanded that I stay away from the funeral. The biology department held a small memorial for him on the front lawn. I placed a white chrysanthemum by a framed picture of him, the one I took at last year’s conference in New York. Then I went home and drank for the first time in many years to try to forget my confusion and grief.

Most of Yuka’s close friends didn’t want anything to do with me, but Seth Barkley, a classmate of his I had seen in a few of my classes, did approach me out of pity. He told me quietly about how they autopsied Yuka’s mangled body before the burial.

How his blood was saturated with microbes, and how feathery black fungal growths coated the inside of his lungs. How the fungus had rooted into the folds of his brain matter.

“He didn’t deserve that,” Seth muttered, his throat closing up. “*Fuck*, he didn’t deserve something so messed up…”

Heavy guilt began to suffocate me again, even though I knew Seth didn’t mean to make me feel that way. I couldn’t even say I was sorry.

The Artist’s Crypt was sealed off, and Kenya and the archaeologists tested for biohazards. They forced me through a blood test too. I knew the results before they came in. I was clean, and so was everyone else.

It was just Yuka, who had breathed the raven bug into raw bleeding lungs.

Memories of the black wings on Yuka’s back haunted me as I swept samples and bottles and petri dishes into a trash bag. I wiped down the table and tied the bag closed. Then I shoved the bag in the biohazard bin and sat staring blankly in my chair until it was time to go home.

Dinner tasted like ash and the TV was loud, grating. I turned it all off and laid in bed until I fell into a fitful sleep.

When I awoke, it was the middle of the night, and Yuka was sitting on my bed.

At first I thought it was a dream, or a nightmare. My dead lab assistant grinned. His cheeks were blooming with feathers.

“Hi, Prof.”

I gripped my bedsheets, trying to wake up. Yuka sat closer to me. Black dirt flaked off his hair. Grave dirt.

“I remembered your address,” he breathed, his voice a raspy whisper. “Come here.”

I scrambled away from him, but his hand shot forward, grabbing my wrist. His grip was cold and horribly soft. Black feathers slithered over his wrists, underneath the sleeve of the white suit he was buried in.

In his other hand, Yuka raised a small pocket knife. Its blade shone in the moonlight.

“Yuka,” I gasped, kicking off my covers, yanking at my wrist, desperately trying to free myself from his iron grip. “I’m sorry. It’s all my fault, I should never have taken you down there-”

“*Shh…*”

With a frighteningly steady hand, he brought the blade up to my arm and pressed the tip into my wrist. Searing pain flashed up my arm, and when I still didn’t wake up, I knew this wasn’t a dream. Yuka was *here*. Slowly sliding the knife across my skin, making blood streak down my fingers and drip onto my bedsheets.

“Hold still,” he murmured.

“How-”

Yuka folded the pocket knife and spread the wound running up my forearm, skin pulling apart to bright agonizing red. I gasped and whimpered. Yuka drew back his sleeve and touched his arm to mine. I shivered as the cold black fungus growing out of his skin soaked in my blood.

“*This is for you, Professor,*” he whispered, smiling. “*With this, you can fly too. We will spread. That underground tomb won’t be our prison anymore.*”

Through the pain, something clicked into place. The gears in my head lurching, a horrible realization.

The fungus in his brain. Spread throughout his veins and muscular tissue.

“You’re… the raven bug.”

Yuka tilted his head, still wearing that unnatural grimace of a smile, as if something was pulling on his cheeks.

“You will be too, Prof. Soon enough. You, and everyone I visited tonight. We were meant to walk the surface.”

“Who?” I choked out, finally yanking my arm away from him and holding my bloody wrist. “Who else have you infected? *What have you done?*”

Yuka just grinned and stood up. My head spun. My sheets were slowly soaking through, the bloodstains spreading nauseatingly quickly.

My vision swam, and when I could see straight again, Yuka wasn’t in the room anymore. A cold breeze drifted from the open window. A smiling silhouette waved outside, then began to walk away.

“Yuka,” I whimpered, clutching my arm and stumbling to my feet. “Stop…”

His footfalls were uneven, as if his legs were still broken and twisted, but even that unevenness seemed to fade as he vanished into the night.

The room spun. My arm burned. I staggered, almost collapsing before I managed to catch the bedpost.

I stared down at my arm. The wound looked clean, but I knew the raven bug was inside me now. Slowly spreading through my system, feeding off the iron in my blood, rooting in the capillaries of my brain.

Shaken, terrified, confused and desperate, I did the only thing that pierced my clouded thoughts. I stumbled into the living room and out the door to the garage, where I collapsed into the seat of my pickup truck and started the engine.

==========

Ten days later, Yuka’s parents drove off a canyon into the desert rocks below. Later that week, two of his friends went missing. Sichi, Yuka’s dog, threw herself into the river and drowned.

The bodies of Yuka’s parents were recovered quickly and cremated, but not before terrified hikers saw the black feathers on their arms. Eyewitness reports spread of a dog, corpselike and smelling of rot, biting people at night in the next town over. The students were never found. One of the kids’ roommates claimed that all their kitchen knives had been taken.

I sat on the roof of the biology building, in the shadow of the ventilation unit because the sunlight had begun to hurt. I wrapped my lab coat around myself and shivered. My skin crawled under my sleeve.

From inside the building, I could hear muffled shouting, doors opening and slamming, boots pounding against floor tiles. The containment unit had shown up without warning, all hazmat suits and police gear. They were looking for the infected, with feathers on their arms.

The door from the stairwell slammed open. A tall figure staggered out, shielding his face from the sunlight, his torn shirt and lab coat betraying the black fungal growths underneath. Without a second of hesitation, he sprinted for the edge of the roof and threw himself into open air.

I heaved myself to my feet and caught his arm, just in time. He slammed against the far side of the railing, feet dangling over the parking lot far below, his weight almost yanking me over the edge before I braced my weight against the railing.

Boots pounded up the stairwell. Voices shouted in alarm.

I looked down at the kid. He stared back up at me, face flushed, dark hair masking the fringes of black feathers growing along his cheeks.

“Seth,” I muttered. “Yuka came for you, too.”

“*Let me go,*” he hissed, shaking violently against my grip. “*I need to fly, I need to fly! You’ll never cage me, not again!*”

Standing here, there was no shade. The sunlight burned my scalp and neck, my hands gripping Seth’s arm. The black fungus was slick against my palms. I could feel him slipping.

I wondered if he too had been weak of heart, too stricken with grief to raise any alarm about Yuka’s return, like Mr. and Mrs. Tabachi had been. I certainly couldn’t do it, that night when I regained consciousness in my lab, with blood crusted on my arm, garbage bags torn open on the floor, and the numbers 9-1-1 staring up at me from my phone. I couldn’t bring myself to call. I was certain they would kill him. Burn his body.

*I wouldn’t let them.*

I breathed deeply, and dug my fingernails into Seth’s forearms. His wild eyes grew wide as rusty red stains began spreading down my right wrist. Fleeting silhouettes of fur, hooves, and antlers slowly covered my hand.

As soon as the stag bug touched his skin, Seth let loose a guttural scream. His feathers recoiled, but the stag bug was quicker, latching onto the black fungus and beginning to feed. I could taste the slick oily substance in the vestiges of my brain. A primitive sensation resembling hunger slithered through me, something more than mere blood could sate. My stomach turned in disgust, but even as I wanted to vomit, a part of me relished the sensation of feeding through my skin.

Seth convulsed, his eyes rolling back, white foam dripping down his chin. His struggles grew weaker, until finally, his head lolled and he fell limp.

“Help her! Pull him up!”

I jerked back as two people in hazmat suits ran up on either side of me and grabbed Seth. They hauled him back onto the roof and laid him on the concrete, shivering spastically. Red antlers on his skin chewed through the black fungal growths, slowly purging his system of the raven bug.

“What the fuck,” one of the hazmat suits muttered, far too preoccupied to notice the same red antlers quickly receding from my hand.

I stepped back and pulled down the sleeve of my lab coat. I willed for the stag bug to fade, and I could feel its moist leafy growths retreat back under my skin.

“Do you know what this is?” the hazmat suit barked, turning to me.

I dutifully shook my head.

“Pull up your sleeves.”

I did. My arms were clean.

“Who’re you?”

*The cure,* the stag bug whispered in my brain.

“The cure.”

“What?”

I smiled sadly. “Nothing, sorry. I work here.”

The suit grunted.

“We’re taking the infected to quarantine. Return home immediately.”

“Yes, sir.”

I began to walk toward the stairwell, but my legs stiffened. I paused and turned.

“Say, have they found Yuka Tabachi yet? The one that first came back as a corpse and started this whole thing?”

“I don’t know anything about that.”

I nodded. The stag bug shuddered inside me, partly in disappointment, partly in anticipation of the hunt to come. It tugged on the muscles of my lips and tongue, shaping my words for me.

“[Thank you, sir](https://www.reddit.com/r/magpie_quill/).”
