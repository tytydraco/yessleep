"All I am to you is an Ex?" My Ex said in a voice that was laden with incredulousness. The Flames licking out from behind her Ray-Bans briefly grew in intensity. Matching her apparent annoyed disposition. The temperature in the room cranked up a couple of degrees in tune with her ocular light show.  
I idly wondered if I could get her angry enough to melt the black framed sunglasses.  
  
  
"Well..... Yeah" I said, not quite sure how to answer that.  "What else would you be, Amina? We've been over this, we are D-U-N done."  
  
  
"I thought that we shared something...." She said trailing off. "We were close....  
  
  
"Yeah." I said getting slightly heated. I did my best to keep the emotion out of my voice, but hey nobody can get under your skin like an Ex. "We DID share something. Now? No. We do not...  
Thats why I blocked you on Facebook."  
  
  
Amina stared at me for a moment. Her mouth scrunching up slightly, like my words were a punch in the gut. But the Facebook comment was stupid, so it might have just thrown her for a spin.  
  
  
And too be honest, I understood. It had sounded better in my head.... I can't control the dumb shit that falls out of my mouth sometimes.  
  
  
Amina's head tilted to the side, and she automatically slid into doing her thing and defaulted to manipulation. She projected an air of hurt sadness. The fact that she managed to do it with the barest of effort annoyed me.  
  
  
If I could see her eyes behind the black shades, and the fire of course, I knew they would be on the verge of tears. Or at least doing their best to look like they were.  
  
  
"I don't even have Facebook Colm..... You know that...." Her voice was a quivering faux pained squeak.  
Amina was a veteran manipulator, with many hundreds of years’ worth of experience under her belt.  
  
  
Give her any sort of an avenue to get into your head? She would drive a bus down it.  
I wasn't in the mood to fall for her bullshit and pretend she was here, beyond some morbid curiosity, for my sake. She wanted to know what was going on. She had made a profession of knowing things after all.  
  
  
So I just stared at her.  
  
  
She watched me for a moment. I think she was looking for something she could pounce on. Some thread she could yank until the desired result would fall into her lap.  
  
  
I ignored it as I tried to sit up. Letting an old man grunt go as I did. My everything was sore. Which is actually a good sign. Meant I still had my everything. Not sure if I had modern medical science, Magic, or the abilities of whatever manner of healer was on duty when they rolled me into the E.R.  
I hedged my bets and thanked all three.  
  
  
There were all kinds of wires and patches and shit affixed to my body. In the movies the gruff protagonist just rips all that shit off and gets out of bed, instantly ready to go kick the shit out of communists or terrorists, or whoever the government was currently angry at.  
  
In reality accidently ripping out a catheter hurts like all manner of damn nation. So I didn't touch nothing. Puking from dick pain, in front of my damned ex no less, would have been down right embarrassing. Especially since, truth be told, somewhere in the depths of my soul.... I may or may not be completely over her. But we'll keep that can of worms between us for now.  
  
  
Amina got up from her chair. She picked up a metal pitcher sitting on one of those hospital roll table-stand things. She poured a glass and walked it over to me. She held the cup out to me in a wordless offer, her face doing a passable impersonation of concerned.  
  
  
I eyed it warily. My eyes flicking from the cup up to her sunglasses and back down at the cup again. The condensation fogging up the glass let me know that that was going to be the best damn sip of water I'd ever had. But with Amina's kind, this COULD be a friendly gesture or it could be a future debt looking to get fulfilled. You never really could tell.  
  
  
"Yeah.... I am not that fuckin' stupid" I said. Which is lie, because as I’ve demonstrated before, I'm plenty fuckin' stupid.  
If I could see the orbs of fire behind those cheap sunglasses, I knew they would be free of their earlier manipulative stance and rolling their little circular hearts out.  
  
  
"Colm" She said, a hint of annoyance in her voice. "I give this to you freely, with nothing attached but my desire to see your dry throat soothed. Believe it or not, everything I do isn’t about hurting you"  
  
  
I eyed the cup again.  
  
  
"Yeah, that sounds real nice" I said, before dropping something else that sounded much better in my head "But that's something you aren’t."  
  
  
She made an annoyed noise in my direction.  
  
  
"Fine." She said slamming the cup down on the night stand next to my bed. I noticed a hint of something dangerous creeping into her voice. Something that spoke of old power. "My mother was right about you."  
  
  
"Oh!" I made a satisfied noise at that. Which was purely just to push her buttons.  
  
  
Me and Amina's mother hadn't got along too well. Me being a Small-Town hick Sheriff's Deputy, not to mention a human, and Amina being.... well, Amina.  
  
  
I would expand on that statement, but trust me, the less about her you know? The safer it is for you. Hell, Amina isn't even her real name. I'm changing it for your safety.  
  
  
Now the going popular notion is that knowledge is power. Which in most respects it is. However, there is such a thing as dangerous knowledge. Sometimes if you know too much about something? That something might resent that and decide to do something about it. That something is usually pretty down right grisly and obscene.  
  
  
Me? I am a full-blown avatar of law and fuckin' order.  
  
My bosses answer to the DOJ, the DOD, and The DHS. I can get away with a bit of dangerous knowledge, because if something happens to me, Especially if it’s due to something I picked up in the line of duty? All those three letter organizations are going to find an ass and dig in. There won’t be much in the way of lube involved either. The Government don't like when you take a swing at it. Even a swing from the great beyond.  
  
Not that I think Amina would come after you, dear reader. If you knew more about her that is... but we're going to play it safe on this one. But fair warning, if you see a set of burning eyes stalking you in the dark? Just…. Uh…. Well I would say move faster, but it would be more accurate to say ‘nice knowing you, I guess.’  
  
  
"How is your Mamma anyway?" I asked, my voice all country boy shitkicker innocence. "Still trying her sparkly best to prove she is relevant in the Age of Man? I noticed that summer time just ain't as windy as it used to be...."  
  
  
Amina's eyes would have widened in rage were they not eternally burning of course. Her body language tense up though, her arms crossed in front of her, as she glared down at me from my bedside.  
  
  
"I come here to make sure that you were still with both feet in this..... world...." She said lacing the last word with more than a little scorn. "And you mock me.... my family.... I just think it’s funny that---"  
  
She was interrupted by the door creaking open. A Nurse poked her head in.  
Her eyes widened with genuine joy as she saw me sitting up in bed with both eyes open.  
  
  
  
"Oh! Deputy!" She brouged Scottishly at me "Yer Awake! And here aye was, just come t'check on ye----"  
  
  
All of a sudden she stiffened as if she caught a whiff of fresh dog shit. She shoved the door the rest of the way open and barged into the room like she owned the place. Which her being a nurse and this being her floor She did indeed own the place.  
  
  
She fixed Amina with an angry glare, right before her third eye ripped wide open. Pure white light blazed out of it. Lighting up the room like she just shot off a flare gun. Her left eye went dark red and her right eye went emerald green. Not really sure what her metaphysical deal was, but goddamn if that wasn't one hell of a threat display.  
  
  
The stocky nurse placed herself between my bed and Amina. She was within striking distance of the woman with eyes of fire. The white light blazing out of her forehead seemed to cause Amina to shrink back away from her. The fire coming out from behind her cheap sunglasses seemed to wilt a little. I noticed that the temp in the room seemed to drop a couple of degrees.  
  
  
Course.... If you've ever seen a Nurse protect their patient, you know that being on the receiving end of a pissed off ICU Nurse's fury? Well hell, that's like staring down the barrels of a firing squad. So it was a pretty fucking rational response on Amina's part.  
  
  
"Yer not signed in at the front desk." The Nurse's voice was cold. Cold like an iron coffin buried in the Artic.  
  
  
My self-appointed body guard spared a glance back at me. I had to squint my eyes at the glare, but it wasn't too bad. I saw the Nurse give me a warm smile.... and I felt safe. Not that I hadn't before she walked into the room, but it was just.... well it was nice. Felt like I was a kid again. Before.... Y'know... Everything.  
  
  
She turned back to Amina.  
  
  
"Yer not welcome here."  Was all the Nurse said.  
  
  
"Um... Yeah... Okay" Amina said awkwardly. All air of otherworldly royalty blown out of her voice.  
I had never seen her so cowed. It was out of character for her. It was great.  
Loaded me with a shit ton of questions, that may or may not have been polite to ask the nurse until I was better acquainted with her.  
  
  
In Bull's Heart a lot of residents move here, so as to live their lives in anonymity. So questions like 'So... Where in the Great beyond does your family come from?' 'What was the first society to worship you as a god?' Or 'what the hell are you!?' are generally frowned upon. At least until you have a bit more of a bond with the individual in question.  
  
  
It can lead to a few surprises.  
  
  
There's this guy who owns the Auto shop over on Perkins Street. For six years I thought he was a Human. Hell I had beers with the guy on more than one occasion.  
But over time I started getting little inklings that he might be something more. Mentions of an ancient family line. Mention of serving in a Legion, but not the French Foreign one. Stuff like that. Hey man, no sweat off my back. People got secrets and they are allowed to keep them.  
  
  
But one day; I had to bring my cruiser in for an oil change.  
He didn't realize I was there. He was under the hood of a 2009 Kia Sorento. He was so wrapped up in getting angry at Korean Automotive engineers that he never even twigged my presence.  Which, if you've ever owned a Korean car, you'll understand.  
  
  
He was heated, I mean real heated. I heard curses in languages that probably hadn't been uttered outside of an educational setting in generations. I just sat back and watched him, wondering how angry he would get. I had to suppress a few chuckles while doing so. Funniest part was that He was normally such a calm guy. Seeing him get this pissed was hilarious.  
  
  
Finally he just picked the whole damn thing up like it was made out of Styrofoam and chicken feathers.  
He walked it out of the garage and hurled it into the sky.  
It landed all the way over in Harris County. The far side of it.  
  
  
Don't worry, nobody got hurt. Except for the cow it landed on. That fucked up her day pretty good.  
All of the Airports in Houston picked up an unknown Korean aircraft on their radars. F-16s were scrambled out of Ellington Field.  
Somebody put pictures of the soaring Sorento on 4chan. It was a whole big thing.  
DHS was pretty pissed about that one.  
  
  
The mechanic hurled curses in its wake. Screaming and beating on his chest like a furious coked up chimpanzee.  
  
  
"Awwww shit, Andy" I said around a feeling of shocked befucklement, making my presence known.  
  
  
He froze when he realized he had an audience. He slowly turned around and gave me a goofy embarrassed smile from behind his beard.  
  
  
"You know you're gonna have to pay for that" which was the only phrase that sprung to mind, in the state of shock I had been in.  
  
  
He turned and watched the sky in the direction he had launched the Kia, Hands on his hips.  
  
  
"Awww Biscuits...." Was the only thing he said. A bizarre oath after the master class in Proto Scythian swear words he had just given.  
  
  
But like the man said 'So it goes.'  
  
  
Back to the nurse. She just glared at Amina as she scurried for the door. I noticed that Amina still had an ass to die for when she did. Which made me briefly wonder if I could still get in her britches, but I quickly dismissed that as a bad idea. But I mean..... shit you should have seen that ass. The kind of ass that would make you ignore a pile of red flags.  
  
  
My Ex was half out of the door when she got her courage back.  
She paused and leaned her head back in the door. Her Ray-bans drilled into my eyes and her face took on a smug bent.  
  
  
"Somethings coming, Colm..." She started but was just as quickly cut off by my Nurse protector.  
  
  
"Out" was all she said.  
  
  
Amina moved about two inches further through the door without taking her flaming eyes off of me. She hazarded another few words before she was completely gone.  
  
"Something attacked Sheriff's deputies out in the open, Colm! You know it will happen again!"  
  
  
"NOW!" The Nurse bellowed. The voice she bellowed in sounded hard, like a war horn blasting along in front of an earth-shaking heavy cavalry charge. Felt like I should have gotten tinnitus from it.  
  
  
"You heard the lady there, La Toxica..." I said "....get to stepping. My good health and well being depends upon on it."  
  
  
She shot me a bitchy look. The one women give when they are tired of your bullshit, but can't really say anything at the moment.  With that Amina was gone. I doubted she would be out of my life for good. At this point I don't think she ever truly will be.  
  
  
The Nurse glared at the door Amina had gone though for a good couple of moments after it shut. The light show coming out of the ICU Nurse's face slowly powered down. She closed all three of her eyes. Her lips broke into a small tight smile and she hummed a note or two of a song I would never recognize. I got the feeling I might have been witness to a display of power way beyond my comprehension.   
  
  
The air in the room started to smell fresh. Like what I have to assume a misty morning on a Scottish moor would smell like. I got a lung full of it and it felt amazing.  
  
  
"Dearie, ah'm sorry ya had tae see th' at"  
  
  
"I'm not." I said. "That was pretty fuckin' cool."  
  
  
The smile she gave me in return, lit up the room as the nurse came over to my bed. She leaned down and checked the machine monitoring my vitals.  
  
  
"How am I doing, Doc?" I asked her.  
  
  
"Oh you'll live, Dearie" The nurse said. "Maybe nae for long if'n'ye keep tangling up with that one--" She inclined her head towards the door Amina had just gone through"—But you'll be walking out of here at least soon."  
  
  
"Probably not wrong there" I said with a slight smile.  
  
  
"Ah know Ah'm not, Dearie."  
  
  
Nurse had me pegged. Somehow, She knew I was one 3AM 'wyd' text on a lonely night away from going full Ron Swanson when Tammy drops in to see him.  
The rest of my life's fucked up, no reason my love life should be any different.  
  
However, as cool as watching my Ex being terrified for her life had been.... She did have a point.  
Three Sheriff's Deputies had been ambushed by a small army of vaguely demonic bird people.  
Which not only sounded stupid, but any sort of attack on government officials didn't tend to be a pre-cursor of good things to come.  
  
  
If somebody was willing to risk annihilation at the hands U.S. Government, or one of it's allies in the great beyond or in NATO (yeah that stuck around after the U.S.S.R. collapsed for a reason.)  
that meant they thought they had the sand to fight off every three letter agency, who had a foot in the metaphysical realm.  
  
  
Which meant they thought that they were in possession of the horse power to withstand the might of the American War Machine, both Physical and Metaphysical.  
To rip the strength of this nation from it's chest and bite into it like a still beating heart.  
To unleash all manner of fiery hell and damnation on us, whiling herding the human race along to it's brutal and eternal slaughter.  
Real 'Let Chaos and darkness blot out the sun' type a shit.  
  
  
But don't you worry about that. We estimate there are only about six thousand things out there that think they can do that sort of thing. Occasionally the Government has to remind them that their shit does in fact stink. You might be an otherworldly being capable of great feats of terrifying raw power…. But for every superpowered over fiend who thinks he’s hot shit? Theres a U.S. Air Force A/C-130J that’s just not impressed with his nonsense.  
I would say only about twenty of those six thousand have a shot of pulling off a dub.  
Six of that twenty are capable of doing it without killing themselves in the process, and of those six only, like two of them, have shown any interest in doing so, but it's not like a serious interest.  
More like a bored idle thought. Because at the end of the day, its not worth the effort or energy expended to destroy a people. Especially when the last act of those people might be a Minuteman Three or a Trident Two dropped in your lap.  
  
  
And that's only two unlikely things you in particular have to be worried about...  
  
  
And this? I could tell you was not either one of them. Just some weird small town shit, that Amina was dragging way out of proportion, because like all Batshit ex's, she was nothing if not a total fucking drama queen.  
  
  
Oh and by the way, don't be worried about those two things either, Because honestly, like most things, it's just not worth the anxiety.  
  
  
Now the things that can't do the whole crushing a super power thing and are secure in the knowledge that they can't do that sort a thing, who are comfortable with their lot in life disemboweling hikers along the Appalachian Trail? That might be more worth You worrying about.  
  
  
But, I wouldn't worry about that either. No point. Just stay clear of Abandoned Churches and out of the woods at night. You'll be okay.  
  
Probably.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
My recovery was a relatively short affair.  
As these things tend to be in Bull's Heart. With all the ability and power available to the hospital staff. People tend to heal quick. Which is good.  
  
  
I wouldn't know though, I spent most of that time doped up and unconscious. Which was nice.  
I'm told that humans tend to recover quicker, than most. One of the big reasons that we are the dominant species on Earth, instead of say.... Centaurs or Vampires or somebody else.  
  
  
Somebody learns something? it helps that we can survive longer and heal up enough to spread that something we learned.  
  
  
The Great beyond, as I understand, is a sort of 'If you're wounded, you're dead' kind of place.  
  
  
Makes spreading information a real summabitch. I am given to understand that some parts of behind the vale, and I'm talkin' way the fuck out there, there are entire empires that have been stuck in the bronze age for eons. Interesting thing is that out there? Life times away into the dark, they are considered technological hot shit.  
  
But they are very difficult places in regards to staying alive. Self-aid is about your only option, with buddy aid is a thoroughly unexplored option.  
  
Thats all we know about those places though. There are rumors that NASA launched Voyagers three and four out there. To try and see some of the veil.  
  
Side note. There are also rumors that the department of NASA which controls the probes, has the highest rate of suicide of any research department on earth. You stare into raw chaos long enough? It'll wriggle into your brain and just make life not worth living anymore.  
  
  
It may take a lot to injure the denizens of the spooky side of the veil, but they stay injured when you do.  
Which is one of the reasons a lot of them come here.  
  
  
For the Healthcare.  
  
  
It seemed like as soon as I was deemed hale and hearty enough to receive visitors,  
The door swung open and there Mama Gruk loomed.  
  
  
"Oh, Colm...." She said, tears hovering around the edge of her voice.  Moisture making her big Orc peepers look glassy. Which may surprise you. Her being an Orc and all, But you might be interested to know that Orcs are some of the most emotionally vulnerable creatures on the face of the planet. Sure they are capable of extreme violence and such, but also capable of great and powerful love. If an Orc likes you in a familial way, they will drop everything to help you.  
  
  
It was a stark contrast to when I had last seen her. Roughly two or three weeks prior, from what I was told later. She had been a war engine, smashing skulls and tearing shitbirds limb from literal limb. Now? She looked vulnerable.... Shaken...  it looked like she was mostly healed from her tussle, as not only was she an Orc but a Vampiric one as well. So crippling wounds and being maimed for life weren't really her thing. Give her enough blood and she would bounce back from a chainsaw lobotomy.  
  
  
I could tell that she was pretty distraught over the state I was in though. She had seen more than a few deputies get torn apart over the years, I could tell she might have been afraid that I might have joined that list.  
  
  
Knowing Senior Deputy LaVonda Gruk Like I do, I knew that she probably blamed herself to some extent, for the state I was in. As she would with any Deputy under her charge wounded in the line of Duty. Her body may have healed quickly, but I could tell that her soul wasn't quite there yet.  
  
  
I decided to fuck with her. Because I am a terrible friend.  
  
  
"LaVonda...." I said in a harsh whisper "is that you? I can't.... I can't.... see very well anymore"  
  
  
The strangled grunting sob that came out of her was heart breaking.  
I held up my hand, motioning for her to come closer. Which she did. She took my hand in her massive mitts, as gently as she could. She leaned over me and took in my battered and beaten visage. I could honestly say that I looked a hell of a lot worse than I felt, but she didn’t know that.   
  
  
I noticed her wife, Maddie, come into the room behind her. She was tall and looked vaguely like an Italian Helena Bonham Carter, which made sense since the actress was one of her descendants.  
  
I could tell that she immediately smelled bullshit in the air, cause she gave me a look that was made of ice. Suspicious ice. She crossed her arms and quirked up her lips as she glared at me. I made eye contract with her and her eyes went narrow. I like Maddie, I do. But sometimes, she is just no damn fun. Her day job….. Night job?.... Whatever,  was accountant, and she sure had the sense of humor for it.  
  
  
"I'm here, Colm" Gruk said to me rubbing the back of my hand. "Do you need anything?"  
  
  
I let out a groan of pain as I pulled myself up in the hospital bed.  
  
  
"I need more...." I said letting the words trail off into the void.  
  
  
"More what, Colm?" She asked, leaning closer. Concern painted across her face.  
  
  
"Da..." I Said, feigning a bit of a struggle ".....Dakka..."  
  
  
"More.... Dakka...?" She asked perplexed. She looked over her shoulder at Maddie, who didn't seem to get the reference, illustrating this with a confused shrug of the shoulders. Gruk looked back down at me "Colm... What's Dakka?" Her brow furrowed in confusion... Right before her eyes almost rolled right out of her skull as realization hit her "Colm! You... Frickker!"  
  
  
"Language!" I said with a laugh.  
  
  
She laughed with me. A bit of relief in her voice. Seemed like she had been holding that in for awhile. Like she needed the laugh. She leaned in and scooped me up in a tight bear hug. Which damn near finished what the Shitbirds had started.  
  
  
"You're..... hurting me, LaVonda" I managed to rasp out.  
  
  
"Ohhh...." She said in a tone of voice that held all of the love in the world. "....I know"
