I didn't think I'd be posting again after a day but yesterday was a lot. If you didn't read about the last part, [here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15w6odd/i_was_attacked_by_something_a_few_weeks_ago_part_3/). If you haven't seen the beginning [this is it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15rcc8e/i_was_attacked_by_something_a_few_weeks_ago/)

Last time I introduced you to my new group of.. friends? Well, yesterday my door was open again. I don't know if it's going to be an every other day occurrence or if it's just going to be random but it's nice to get out. I was excited to see if I'd run into any of them today. Almost three weeks of not actually speaking has been kind of driving me insane.

I started walking down the hallway the direction what I'm going to call the break room is in. I have no clue which door it is but I have a feeling I'll be able to hear them talking when I find it. Instead I saw a door fly open at the end of the hall and Yeren darting out of it dragging the blonde girl from the last part behind her. Following after them was at least six men in lab suits. They all looked almost identical but each had different tools in their hands.

I didn't know what was happening and my feet reacted before my brain could process it as I started running towards the mayhem. I reached the men and jumped over them before superhero landing in front of them. I've never been very good at jumping. Don't ask me how I did this. It felt like all of the muscles in my legs contracted then released in one fluid motion. The men immediately stopped and looked at me. All six of them stared at me as smiles slowly started to form on their faces.

Yeren looked back at me and nodded then picked up the blonde girl, who I now noticed was unconscious, and ran like a bat out of hell. I turned back to the men but for some reason they were facing the other direction, one of them visibly shaking. I couldn't see what they were looking at until I squeezed up against the wall to take a peek. 

At the other end of the hallway, slowly taking a turn towards us, was the kid with all of the voices.

I couldn't even react before the men in lab coats shoved past me, knocking me to the floor. I back-pedaled watching the kid walk towards me. I could hear the voices coming from him getting louder and louder with each step he took. The most terrifying part was that one of the voices sounded familiar. It sounded like my own. 

As he got closer to me I could hear my own voice screaming at me to run. My voice also telling me to come here. My voice telling me that it will be okay. My eyes widened and I tried to get back onto my feet but my legs were like jelly. The adrenaline from intercepting the men from the girls must be wearing off. I don't think I can get away.

Out of no where a flash of orange hair dashed past my shoulder and started singing. Don turned towards me and signaled for me to cover my ears. I did so and watched as the kid with the voices steadily came to a stop. The problem was Don was also starting to look weird. I could tell that he was still singing but something was happening to him.

I did something stupid then and slowly uncovered my ears. I could hear Don singing from two angles. One directly in front of me and one from the kid. I have no clue what was going on but I ran forward and grabbed Don then pulled him away and started running down the hall. When I turned around to look the kid was no where to be seen. I swear I saw someone else standing at the other end of the hall. Their arms were crossed and a disorienting feeling crept over me.

I ran into the big man from yesterday. Like I literally ran into him. We turned a corner and he was there. He looked at me then at Don, who seemed to not be able to move or talk on his own, and a worried look came across his face. 

"Yeren told me the lab dicks were trying to hurt them and you got in the way. I thought I'd find a pile of bones." He looked towards Don and muttered, "What happened to him?"

I ignored the pile of bones comment and said, "He sang some song and the kid with the voices sang it back to him." That was the best description I could give.

The mans frown deepened. "I never introduced myself did I? I'm Bake (pronounced Bok-a) I've been here the longest out of this group. Almost sixty years now, I guess." He took Don and picked him up fireman style. "I won't go into detail about what happened here. It would be too confusing and you'll learn about it in the future."

He said that and started walking away. I turned around and from around the corner I could see the blonde girl and Yeren poking their heads out. This place is really confusing. How did they get behind me if they got Bake for help and he came from the other direction?

Yeren walked out and pulled the blonde girl with her before handing me a note. "Thank you." Is all that it said then she nodded back down the hallway. The blonde girl looked at me with tired eyes and said, "We'll show you back to your room."

We walked in silence back to my room and Yeren stopped in front of my door again, indicating which one it was. The blonde girl and her walked a few doors down and opened a door before entering it together. The blonde girl poked her head out and said quietly, "My name is Lilly."

I didn't know so much time had passed since I left my room but it's been hours. I don't understand what's going on. What were they doing to Lilly? Why did Don save me? What would have happened if he hadn't? Why were those men in lab coats so scared of the voices? How did I jump like that? I hope tomorrow answers some of these questions.
