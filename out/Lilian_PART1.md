Well, I had just moved to a big city for the first time after being kicked out by my grandfather from the farm where I lived. It all happened so suddenly and strangely. I was having a terrible week mentally, feeling something strange and being consumed by my apathy and fear of living. When I woke up today, I found myself in a bizarre situation. My grandfather was sitting alone at the table where he and my grandmother usually waited for me to join them for breakfast. His face was somewhat swollen, and his dark circles and messy hair told me he had had a long night.

I approached and pulled out my chair, but as I did, he startled me by saying, "You need to leave here as soon as possible. I can't keep you safe anymore."

I asked what he meant, but this only made him angrier.

"SAMUEL, JUST LEAVE IMMEDIATELY!" he shouted, slamming his cup on the table and spilling hot coffee over his hands.

This was not normal. He had never acted like this before; the situation was truly urgent. So, I grabbed my things, my cats, and left immediately for the city center. Upon arriving, I found a rustic place that still felt like home, the only one I could find. I rented a room in the building and spent a few minutes there, getting to know the place that came with old, worn-out furniture reflecting the exterior of the building.

After a while, I headed to the bus stop. I needed to go to the market since there was no food in my new residence. The day was gray, mirroring what was to come later. I took the bus to the market, bought enough for a few weeks, and returned to the stop. In the meantime, a huge storm overtook the city, and I had to run to protect my backpack and shopping bags. I entered a random building, a bookstore in the city.

On my way in, I bumped into a beautiful girl, Lilian. She was wearing a white top and loose pants, smiling at me.

"Sorry... I was running from the rain and..." I began to explain when she cut me off, saying, "It's okay, I wasn't that dry either."

We spent a good amount of time there, talking and getting to know each other. After a while, when the storm turned to drizzle, she asked if I lived nearby and offered me a ride. Well, I couldn't refuse, as I had no interest in taking another crowded bus.

During the ride, we had some deep conversations. She really charmed me with her dark, mysterious eyes. As we arrived at my street, I noticed she seemed uncomfortable, like she had remembered something bad. Her trembling hands on the steering wheel told me she was anxious about something. I tried to make a joke to lighten the mood, and although it didn't work very well, I managed to get a small smile from her. We arrived at the front of my building, and as I turned to leave, she called me to get my contact info. She said that since I was new in town, she could show me around and take me to a café she liked.

When I got home, I found Breu, my cat, lying on an old, battered armchair in the house. He stayed there all day, which was strange since he usually slept with me at night. On the other hand, Skye was very attached to me, which was unusual for her. She didn't leave my side, except when passing near the armchair. She wouldn't go near Breu or that old armchair.

As I was getting ready for bed, I noticed some bloodstains on my comforter, and after searching for a while, I discovered it was coming from Skye's neck. It was probably caused by the collar I used on her during the trip. I cleaned the wound and now I'm writing this before going to sleep.

When there’s something worth telling, I'll come back here. I hope everything goes well in the new house.
