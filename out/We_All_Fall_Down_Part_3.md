After the terrifying encounter on the road, I knew I had to act quickly. The cryptic words of the radio static echoed in my mind: "I will see you tonight and every night." I couldn't shake off the feeling that something much darker was unfolding, something far beyond my understanding. The image of that shadowy figure lingered in my thoughts; its presence was as chilling as the first encounter.

Determined to uncover more, I decided to visit the schools involved. I arrived at St. Stephens Academy, once a symbol of elite education; it now seemed ominous under the gray sky.

Walking through the empty hallways, I felt an eerie silence interrupted only by the occasional creak of the old wooden floors. I reached the library and saw the room cluttered with tech equipment and stacks of laptops, each one potentially harbouring a sinister secret.

When I entered, I saw a person on edge, his eyes darting around as if expecting something to leap out of the shadows.

"Sir, I'm Jack Lacast. I need to know about these laptops," I said, showing him my badge, hoping the remnants of my NYPD authority might still hold some sway.

He glanced at my badge and nodded, wiping sweat from his forehead. "It's the laptops... There's something wrong with them," he stammered.

"What do you mean?" I asked, leaning closer.

"I don't know exactly. We ran all the diagnostics and wiped them clean before handing them out. But students started acting strange...violent. It's like something was controlling them," he explained, his voice trembling.

I needed more. "Can you show me the records? Anything odd in the system?"

He hesitated, then nodded, leading me to his computer. He pulled up the logs, showing me a series of unusual data spikes corresponding with the incidents. My eyes narrowed at the sight of a recurring timestamp: 3:33 AM.

"What happens at 3:33 AM?" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

"That's when the laptops run their automatic updates. But this...this isn't normal. It's almost like they're accessing something...or being accessed," he replied.

Suddenly, the lights flickered, and the computer screen distorted. The timestamp flashed repeatedly: 3:33 AM. The screen then displayed a face, the same ghastly figure I had seen before. It spoke in a voice that sent shivers down my spine.

"Jack Lacast, you cannot stop this. We all... fall... down..."

The room plunged into darkness, and I quickly grabbed my flashlight. Then I heard a guttural growl behind me. I spun around, flashlight in hand, illuminating the horrific figure standing in the doorway, its eyes burning with malevolence.

The man screamed, but his voice was cut short as the figure lunged at him, its hands morphing into claws. Blood splattered across the room, and I stumbled back, crashing into the desk. I had to act fast. I grabbed the crucifix Lady Lanter had given me, held it to the lighter's flame, and pointed it at the figure.

The creature hissed, recoiling from the light, its form flickering. I took the chance to grab one of the laptops and bolted from the room, hearing the creature's enraged shrieks behind me.

As I sped away from the school, I glanced at the laptop on the passenger seat, its screen displaying the same haunting message: "We all fall down." My heart pounded, knowing that this was far from over. The true horror was just beginning, and whatever this darkness was, it had no intention of letting me escape its grasp.
