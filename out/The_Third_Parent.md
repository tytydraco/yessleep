When I was ten, my parents sat me down in the living room and explained the house rules again — but this time, there was a new one.

“Remember,” my dad said gently, “if you ever see someone in the house who looks like me or your mom, but we’re both outside or gone… don’t talk to them. Just go to your room, shut the door, and wait.”

He was dead serious. My mom looked pale, like she didn’t even want to have the conversation. I laughed a little, thinking it was one of those strange adult jokes, but neither of them smiled.

“Can I ask questions?”

My mom shook her head. “Never. Don’t ask it questions. Don’t answer any. Just go. Promise us.”

I didn’t understand, but I nodded.
Looking back now, I wish I’d never broken that promise.

For almost a year, nothing strange happened. I lived like any other kid. Video games, homework, occasional fights over bedtime. I forgot all about the “rule.”

Then one night, around 9:30 PM, I was sitting on the couch watching cartoons. Dad was working late, and Mom had gone to pick him up from the train station.

The house was quiet. Lights were off in the kitchen and hallway. Just me, the flickering TV, and the sound of the old grandfather clock ticking away behind me.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

Then I heard footsteps.

Not outside. Upstairs.

They were slow, deliberate. Heavy like Dad’s, but uneven — like one leg dragged slightly. I muted the TV and listened, heart thudding.

I called out: “Mom?”

No answer.

The footsteps reached the top of the stairs.

I slowly turned and looked toward the hallway.

And then… he stepped into view.

He looked like my dad. The same beard, same glasses, same weekend hoodie — except wrong. Slightly too tall. Face too tight. Eyes… blank.

“Hey, bud,” he said cheerfully. “Where’s your mom?”

I stared in horror. I’d just talked to her ten minutes ago. She was out. She wasn’t home. And Dad couldn’t be either.

I remembered the rule. My fingers went numb.

Without a word, I bolted toward the stairs. As I passed him, his head twitched like a glitch, his smile widened too far, and he whispered:

“Don’t run. I’m your real dad.”

I slammed the bedroom door and locked it. My heart was a drum inside my chest. I crawled into the closet and stayed there for what felt like an hour.

At some point, I heard the front door open. Then familiar voices — Mom and Dad.

I ran out crying. They were horrified when I told them.

They didn’t act surprised. Just scared. Quiet. Dad called someone — an old man named “Uncle Roy,” who wasn’t really our uncle but came over that night anyway with a black bag full of what looked like tools and salt.

They walked through the house together. Every room. Every closet. Every mirror.

Then Uncle Roy sealed the attic with three long nails and something written in chalk. When I asked what was going on, all they’d say was: “It found us again.”

After that, things got worse.

Some nights I’d wake up to the smell of sulfur. Other times I’d hear laughter under the bed, deep and muffled, like someone laughing into a jar.

Once, I found a photo on my pillow — one we’d never taken. It was me, my mom, my dad… and a fourth figure. Vague. Blurred. Standing in the background, smiling with black eyes.

Mom burned it in the sink without saying a word.

One night, I woke up to the sound of my closet creaking open. I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

From inside the dark, a voice that sounded exactly like my mom’s said, “Sweetheart… it’s me. Let me tuck you in.”

I shut my eyes. When I opened them again, it was morning. Closet wide open. No one inside.

Years later, when I was seventeen, I finally asked my parents: What was it?

They exchanged a look, and my dad said this:

“When you’re born… you get a mother, a father… and sometimes… something else. A third parent. One that isn’t meant to stay. But if you see it, if you acknowledge it… it tries to come back. Over and over. Wearing different faces. Copying love.”

He paused, voice shaking. “We saw ours when we were kids. That’s how it found you.”

Now I’m twenty-eight. Married. My own child on the way.

Last night, my wife left to visit her sister. I was alone, sitting on the couch, when I heard something upstairs.

Slow. Dragging. Heavy.

I stood, heart racing. And then, from the top of the stairs, I heard a voice — my own voice.

“Hey… where’s your wife?”

It smiled with my face.

I didn’t move. I didn’t speak.

I just went to my room, shut the door… and waited.

Like I was taught.

Like I will teach my child.

Because the third parent never leaves for long. It just waits for a new family to love.
