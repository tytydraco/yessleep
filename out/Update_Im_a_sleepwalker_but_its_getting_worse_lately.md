So, I just want to touch on some stuff that was asked in my [previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mvpvsg/im_a_sleepwalker_but_its_getting_worse_lately)  

Firstly, I have been eating throughout the day, thanks for your concern though. I still have quite a bit of leftover cash, and food is just about the only thing I use it on. Thankfully, I haven’t had any issues with late-night shopping sprees. My subconscious prefers moonlit theft as it would seem. 

Secondly, while I can’t say with one-hundred percent certainty, I at least don’t think I’m a vampire. I spend most of my days in direct sunlight and I love it. The same goes for garlic bread. If I was, unbeknownst to myself, some kind of monster, it would probably be a were-cat. I frequently wake up with my clothes covered in cat fur. 

Anyways, I would love to update you guys on the story of returning the wallet.  

Now believe me when I say I had every intention of following the advice in one of the comments. I gave it some thought, and agreed, that the best option was to just drop it off at the police station. I was beyond curious about the note, but it felt like none of my business. 

By the time I got to that part of the city, however, it was getting dark, my eyes instantly started to feel as if they were made of lead. This is typical for me, as my lack of proper sleep always leaves me drowsy. I decided that it wouldn’t hurt to rest for the night and finish the task in the morning.  

This served as yet another reminder of my poor decision-making skills as I yielded my fate to my late-night alter ego. 

When I awoke, I was under the bleachers of some high school football field. Rays of light beamed through the gaps in the seats, and directly into my eyes as they took their first glances at their surroundings. I rubbed my face, took my time getting to my feet, and cursed as I did so. 

As I made my way back to the road, planning still on heading right to the police station, I caught a glimpse of a street sign. It was the same road name as the one listed on the license. I fought internally with myself on what to do, but given that I was so close, I decided that I would just drop it off on the doorstep and leave. 

I walked down the row of townhouses lining the street until I got to the right building number. I stared at it for only a moment, wishing that I could ease my curiosities about the odd shapes on that piece of paper. I decided against knocking, and instead simply tossed the pink wallet onto the front steps. 

However, turning to make my departure was cut short before the first step had been made. 

“Hello?” a woman said from behind me. I hadn’t heard her open her door, but it was too late to run now. 

 Anxiously, I turned to face her. She was standing in her doorway, just peaking her head out, but I could see the blond hair and blue eyes that matched the picture in the license.  

This was, however, where the similarities met their end. She was older, maybe early forties, and had crow's feet forming at the corner of her eyes. The black blazer she wore gave her a professional appearance that contrasted her messy hair. 

“Uh, hey” nervousness cowering behind each word, “I- I just found that wallet yesterday and thought I would return it.” 

She looked down and found the wallet sitting on the steps. 

“Oh my!” she exclaimed, reaching down and grabbing the wallet. “Why, what a nice surprise. I didn’t think it’d be returned so soon.” 

I sheepishly rubbed my neck, ready to take my leave. 

“It was nothing, really. I’ll get out of your hair.” I turned once again, feeling as awkward as I ever have felt, but the lady stopped me, her hand wrapped firmly around my wrist. 

“Oh, but please, you must at least join me for breakfast. I just finished cooking, and there’s far too much food for just myself.” her voice had a strange mixture of excitement and desperation behind each word. 

I thought about it for a moment, caught off guard by the woman’s enthusiasm. Yet, between my burning questions and rumbling stomach, I felt as though there would be no harm in it. 

After I agreed to join her, she led me inside. Her house was as Home and Gardens magazine as one could ever be. I felt like a scruffy and dirty guy, such as myself, shouldn’t be allowed in a place this nice. Pictures hung all over the walls and lively, potted plants took a spot on every shelf and windowsill. It was picturesque and completely normal, but still, I felt uneasy. 

I took a closer look at some of the photos. Most of them contained three smiling faces belonging to a happy family. I managed to pick out what looked like Chelsey’s face in them; however, she appeared much younger. 

The feeling of anxiety haunted me as I walked through her home. I couldn’t quite place a reason as to why, but it felt as though I was doing something I shouldn’t be. I couldn’t detect any signs of danger, yet still I wasn’t able to drop my guard. That was until I saw her dining room. 

Her table, while devoid of any other occupants, was covered in freshly baked breakfast foods. Pancakes piled high, sausages overfilling their bowl, and half a loaf of bread perfectly toasted; it was so beautiful I could’ve cried. And while no tears were shed, I instantly felt far less on edge. 

I took a seat at one end of the table while she took one at the other. Seeing the feast laid out before me washed away whatever better judgement I had left as I swiftly made my plate.  

Was this stupid of me? Sure, but I couldn’t find any justification for my unrest. She seemed completely normal; from the way she was dressed to the state of her home.  

As I devoured my first plate, and subsequently the second, I noticed she had hardly touched her own. There was a deafening silence at the table, one that seemed to hang in the air as she focused her eyes on me. 

I put my gluttony aside upon noticing her stare. She watched my every move, rarely breaking her gaze to blink. I risked appearing rude to observe my surroundings, the feeling of unrest returning to me. The woman, appearing to notice how uncomfortable I was, quickly adverted her gaze. 

After being sure that no one was sneaking up behind me I finally broke the looming silence. 

“So uh, there was, actually, something else I found with the wallet” I spoke softly as not to startle her. The woman’s eyebrows raised as she returned her attention upon me. 

She didn’t respond to the comment verbally, but she rubbed her hands together nervously, clearly anticipating the reveal. 

I rummaged through my pocket as to find and produce the note. Upon seeing it, she eagerly took it from me, unfolded it, and began taking in each and every one of the bizarre symbols as she inspected it. With each passing moment she seemed to be a little more at peace. However, when I asked about the contents, she chose to play coy. 

“I’m sorry, I don’t know what any of this means” she said flatly as she walked over to the window, “but I think it would be best if you left now. Thank you again for returning my daughter’s wallet.” 

She gave me a weak smile and gestured towards the door. 

I rose from my seat, thanked her for the meal, and grabbed my bag. While my stomach was beyond satisfied, my curiosity was not. In fact, I now wanted to know more than ever what it meant.  

Even in my hazy state of mind I knew she was lying about being unable to read it, but I had no reason to get involved. It was none of my business, after all. 

Yet still, my mind danced with the possibilities of its meaning as I made my way back towards the city. My eyes frequently glanced back towards the home of that strange woman and her family. For a moment, I thought she may have been watching me through the gap of one of the curtains. 

The rest of that day went by as it normally does; simply walking around and taking in the sights. I have already seen most of what the city has to offer, but there always seemed to be something new to explore. I just had to find it. 

However, the endeavor of new and exciting sights proved itself fruitless. As the sun began to set, and the yawns clawed their way from my mouth, I found a nice tree in the park to lean against. I thought of writing this post then and there, but I couldn’t find any Wi-Fi network to connect to. 

As I faded into sweet slumber, I was not met with the usual moment of darkness before I wake again. Rather, I had a dream. I knew what that meant as I lived through the scene; my body would not travel tonight, only my mind. 

Every time I dream, I not only wake in the same spot I slept in but also rise feeling far more refreshed. These were always the best nights; fresh eyes and a renewed energy in the morning. Top it all off with the fact that I always had the same amazing dream, and you can bet your ass I’m in a far better mood for the day. 

This refreshed state of mind, however, did nothing but add fuel to the fire regarding the burning questions running rampant in my mind. Thankfully, I know better than to return to that house. Instead, I’ve made my way to a library, settling on the hopes of at least figuring out what language the note was in.  

Bright eyed and bushy tailed or not, this will still be a hefty task. I’m not the best when it comes to researching things, especially something like this, but I’ll fill you guys in with anything I can find.
