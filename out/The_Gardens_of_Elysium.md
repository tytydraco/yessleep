The Garden of Elysium

My first trip to Elysium felt like slipping into a forgotten dream. I sat in my living room, eyes closed, waiting for the drug to take effect. At first, it was just a warmth at the edges of my mind, like sunlight breaking through on a gray day. And then, all at once, I was there.

The landscape was lush and impossibly green, sprawling fields of giant, luminous flowers under a soft golden sky. Gentle creatures with round, kind eyes drifted toward me, their fur soft and warm as they brushed against my hand. They were mesmerizing, like something out of a fairytale. I felt an overwhelming sense of belonging, a warmth deeper than anything I’d ever known.

When I returned to reality, the colors faded, but that feeling lingered—a strange ache in my chest, a longing I hadn’t felt before. This wasn’t just a high. It felt like home.

The next day, I couldn’t stop thinking about it, wondering if I could return. I resisted for a week, telling myself I’d wait, but the memory of that warmth haunted me. By day seven, the draw was too strong. I took the dose again, and the golden light enveloped me once more.

The creatures were waiting. Their eyes seemed brighter, their smiles wider, and I felt a rush of relief I couldn’t quite explain. They nestled close, humming in soft, wordless tones that resonated through me, soothing every restless thought.

“Stay a little longer,” they seemed to say. And I did, just a few minutes more each time.

Over the next few months, my trips became routine. My life began to shape around them—a dose after work, sometimes even in the morning before I faced the day. Elysium was my sanctuary, a place where everything felt perfect, safe, and unconditionally loving. The creatures greeted me like old friends, wrapping me in a warmth that felt irreplaceable.

But then, one day, something changed.

I was lying in a field of flowers, watching the creatures drift around me, when I noticed one of them staring at me a little too long. Its eyes, usually soft and round, seemed darker, sharper. There was an intensity in its gaze that made me shift uncomfortably.

But then it blinked, and the warmth returned. The creature’s face softened, and I brushed it off as my imagination.

The glitches came more frequently after that. Sometimes, in the middle of a trip, I’d catch a flash of something unnatural—a creature with hollow eyes, limbs too long and thin, shadows lurking just behind them. But before I could react, the comforting warmth would flood back, soothing my nerves, whispering, It’s nothing, just relax.

At first, I ignored it. I couldn’t imagine Elysium as anything but the paradise I’d come to rely on. But the moments grew harder to brush off. Once, while sitting in a grove surrounded by the creatures, I saw one of them peel away, its skin folding back, revealing an empty, shadowy space beneath. A chill ran through me, but before I could process it, the familiar warmth smoothed over my fear, and the vision vanished.

I told myself it was just a side effect. Maybe I was overdoing it. But I couldn’t stop going back.

Outside of Elysium, life began to feel dimmer, as though a fog had settled over my world. Work became a blur. Conversations felt hollow. Even the colors around me seemed muted. The only time I felt alive was when I was with the creatures, basking in their love.

But every trip grew darker. The creatures’ eyes, once soft and affectionate, held a predatory glint. Their smiles lingered too long, stretched too wide. I found myself lost in moments of confusion, unsure if I was in Elysium or somewhere darker, somewhere cold.

One night, I felt a clawed hand brush against my face, gentle yet chilling. I jerked back, but the creature’s expression melted into softness, its voice pouring into my mind like honey, calming me, wrapping me in warmth. The words didn’t make sense, but I didn’t care. All I wanted was that comfort, that feeling of being loved.

The next day, I noticed my reflection looked different. There were hollows under my eyes, a pallor to my skin. I was losing weight; my clothes hung loose, but I didn’t care. Nothing mattered outside of Elysium.

I didn’t mention the changes to anyone. My friends had started asking questions, but their voices seemed so distant now. How could they understand what I’d found? Elysium wasn’t something I could explain. It was love itself.

Then came the night it all fell apart.

I took a higher dose than usual, desperate to drown myself in that warmth. As I entered Elysium, the creatures were waiting, their eyes brighter than ever, their fur almost glowing. They surrounded me, humming their soft, familiar song.

But as I lay back, letting the warmth wash over me, I felt something sharp press against my skin. I opened my eyes, and the creatures’ faces were twisted, their smiles wide and hungry. One of them loomed over me, its mouth splitting open to reveal rows of needle-like teeth.

I tried to scream, but the sound was smothered by a flood of warmth—a chemical love that dulled my terror, numbing me, lulling me into acceptance. As the creatures moved closer, I felt something cold sink into my chest, a sucking sensation as though they were drawing something out of me.

My vision blurred, but I could still see them, their eyes fixed on me, dark and hungry. They were feeding, I realized with a shuddering horror, draining something vital from me, piece by piece. But even as I felt myself slipping away, the warmth held me, soothing me, whispering promises of comfort and peace.

This is love, it told me, this is what you need.

The creatures leaned in, and I could feel my mind fading, my thoughts growing thin and distant. Somewhere deep inside, I knew I was dying, that Elysium was consuming me—but I couldn’t bring myself to care. All I wanted was that feeling, that beautiful, deadly warmth.

As my vision darkened, the last thing I saw was the creatures, their eyes glistening with a cruel satisfaction, their mouths curled in perfect, loving smiles.
