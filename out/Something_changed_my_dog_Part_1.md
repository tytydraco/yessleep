My dog got loose last night and he's been completely different since. It all happened so quick. I took him out to use the bathroom before bed. My house has an open backyard, so I always kept him on a leash when he went out. He somehow got away and ran out into the woods, from which he returned just a few minutes later. He didn't seem too different at first, besides being a bit tired.

I woke up later that night to my dog growling. I checked my phone: 3:22 am. I peeked over the side of my bed to see my dog sat bolt upright staring at the door, growling at something in the hallway. The growling soon evolved to barking, then to full-on pounces and scratches at the door, seemingly trying to get out. I reached to grab the revolver under my pillow and clicked the safety off. I cautiously opened the door, gun drawn.

Nothing. The hallway was completely empty. My dog, Max, had also stopped barking and was now curled up at my bedside, quiet as a mouse. I closed the door and locked it, before turning the safety of my gun back on and laying back down. I somehow stayed asleep throughout the whole night, waking up to my alarm the next morning.

Nothing seemed off when I woke up. Max was acting normal, nothing seemed disturbed throughout the house. I went off to work as usual and got back around 3:15. I had entirely written off the previous night as random paranoia from Max. Maybe he had just seen something when he ran into the woods that really shook him up. At least, that's what I wanted to believe when I opened the front door to see Max sitting straight up in my dark closet staring at me.

I stumbled backwards at the sight, feeling my heart pounding in my chest.

"Jesus, Max! What the hell!?" I shouted, causing Max to slowly walk out of the closet and sit down obediently in front of me.

He seemed relatively normal once he was out of the closet, but nothing could get that image out of my mind. His brown eyes glowing a hellish shade of amber, his wide mouth twisted into a sick grin. I felt a bit overdramatic doing it, but I felt the need to take Max to the vet. He clearly was acting different than his regular energetic, cheery self. I tried to keep my eyes on the road the whole drive there, but I couldn't help glancing into the mirror above my dash. He always glared back at me, a burning rage in his eyes. I had never seen him this angry. Something about the glow in his eyes just sent a shiver down my spine.

Well, I'm sitting outside of the vet as I'm writing this. Max is still staring at me, I'm trying to wrap this up quick so I can get inside and feel at least somewhat safe. I'll keep this post updated as well as I can.
