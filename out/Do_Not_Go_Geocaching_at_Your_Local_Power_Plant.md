When I was growing up, my friends Jose, Luke, and I always searched for new things. We invented challenges and explored every inch of our hometown. One day we discovered geocaching. The three of us downloaded this app on our phones and set out. Filling our backpack with miscellaneous junk to replace any “treasures” we found, we rode out on our bikes. We didn’t find too much. A panda pencil hugger and a 2 dollar bill were among our top finds.

Soon, the app leads us off the beaten path. In between our neighborhood and the next, there’s a dead end road that leads to a power plant surrounded by the woods. Through said woods, a dirt path lined by massive power lines.

“Should we be worried about, you know, electrocution?” I say as we pull up to the spot.

“Nah, we’re fine,” says Jose.
We search and search. This geocache is nowhere to be found. I mean, we’ve scoured everywhere except for the more dangerous spots.

“Bro, it’s not here. Somebody already got it,” said Luke.

“Yeah, they must have forgotten to replace it.” Jose says.

We’re ready to call it quits, walking back up towards the road. But something catches Jose’s eye.

“Woah, what’s that on that tree?”
We turn our attention to the tree. It was the weirdest thing. A beaver stuffed animal, duct taped to a tree.

“Is that... the geocache?” I ask. We have a good laugh. It’s such an odd sight. It looks new too. Though we laughed, it remained eerie.
“Let’s search for it longer. We didn’t check the woods.” I say.

“Yeah, you’re right.” Jose says.
On second thought, not a great idea. Our attire most certainly does not suit a venture into the woods. Thorns, bugs, more thorns, it’s awful. Wanting to give up, but something stops us.

On the wooden floor lies a load of trash. It looks as if someone just dumped their garbage here. A lot of glass bottles. We stare, and with no words exchanged, have the same idea. The sound of glass shattering echoes throughout the forest as we chunk them as if it’s an Olympic sport. As I’m picking up a bottle, I notice something interesting.

“Woah dude, look it’s Gatorade. I didn’t even know they had glass Gatorade bottles. Must be old.” I say.
I notice something to our left that I hadn’t seen earlier. “Wait. Do y’all see that? It’s a house or something.” A white shed lies a few hundred feet from us.

“Woah, what the heck? Why’s that out here?” Jose says.

“Hmm. Maybe it’s for hunting deer or something?” I say.

“Here? By the power plant? We’re not even that deep into the woods.” Luke points out.

“Good point. That is odd.” I say.

“Wanna go see it?” Jose says, motioning in its direction.

“No way dude.” Luke says “Are you crazy?”

“Yeah, let’s go home.” I say. 

The following day, our trio is hanging out as usual. Luke’s little brother Gary comes to join us. This is unusual, because he’s, well, a hermit. I don't believe he’d seen the sun since last summer. This kid plays computer games from dusk till dawn. We tell him of yesterday’s encounters, and he wants to view it himself. We agree, we’re still curious and excited, if not scared.

Gary rides on Luke’s handlebars because he’s small enough. We make it to the dead end and show him the stuffed beaver. Following yesterday’s path, we then lead him to the trash pile and let him throw a few bottles. He has a blast.

“There.” I say pointed towards the out-of-place building. This time, I notice something different. There’s a black four wheeler parked in front of the mystery building.

On cue, the side door opens. A man emerges from its opening. We freeze. In his hand, a filthy white bucket, he dumps its contents of the mystery liquid outside into the woods.

“Go, go!” I say in a scream whisper. We haul ass without looking back, disregarding the many thorns grabbing us. 

Just as we're exiting the woods into the power plant. A loud mechanical noise cuts through the trees. Its roar shakes us to our core. Luke even throws Gary onto his shoulders. Grabbing our bikes as fast as possible, slamming those kick stands, we pedal back to civilization.

Now back in our old neighborhood, we were extra tired. We’re three streets from home. And what do we see? A man riding a four wheeler, the same one we saw in the woods. We go the other way at mach speed.

“Do you think he saw us?” I ask, panting hard.
“I don’t know,” says Luke, his face white as a wedding dress. Our houses are on the same street, so we part ways.

The next day, my friends and I returned outdoors, minus Gary, who I’m sure will now never come back outdoors. We’re sitting on the green box discussing the events of yesterday.

“Dude, what if he comes and finds us?” Jose says.

“But why? Was he doing something illegal?” I say.

“Dude, I’m pretty sure he chased us with a chainsaw!” Luke said.

“I don’t know man, it sounded like a four wheeler to me.” I say.

“What was in that bucket? Do you think he killed somebody? Maybe that was part of a body.” Jose says.

“Dude, come on, stop scaring us. It was his waste bucket or something. If you’re chilling in the woods, you’ll have to take a crap eventually.” I say.

“Ok, but that still doesn’t answer the question. What’s he doing out there?” Jose says.

“Yeah, that’s true.” I say.

As we’re talking, the faint sound of helicopter blades catches our attention.

“Woah come look!” I say. “Is that a news chopper?” We find it intriguing briefly, but then refocus. We decide to play basketball in my driveway after a long conversation. Besides, we figure it’s not a big deal, just a crazy story we’ll look back on in a few years.

After a while, we get called inside for dinner by our parents. I sit at the table, enjoying my meat loaf and green beans. My parents discuss boring stuff such as fundraisers while my baby brother plays with his food.

“Oh, did you see that accident that happened over nearby Hollow Cove? The guy had to be airlifted out of the woods, some kind of ATV accident.” Says my mom.

“Jesus.” My dad says with a mouthful of mashed potatoes.

I sit in silence. Setting my fork on the table, I stare off into space as I ponder. My heart races. But maybe that’s good? If he was after us, he can’t get us now. What is happening?

“Honey? What’s wrong?” my mom says.

“Uh, I saw a helicopter  flying around earlier," I say.

“Oh, you saw it?” my mom asks.

“Yeah, when we were playing outside, I thought it was the news chopper.” I say.

“Oh, sorry, we shouldn’t talk about stuff like that at the table.” My mom says with a concerned look in her eyes.

After this, we didn’t venture off the beaten path. Everyone forgot that day. A lot of it was speculation. After a while, the details get fuzzy.
Until last year, Jose and I bored out of our minds after Luke and his family moved. We decided to go see the infamous shed.

That beaver was no longer stuck to the tree. It now lay in the dirt. An uneasy feeling washed over me as I gazed upon the unrecognizable object.
After rediscovering the beaver remnants, we stumbled back into those same woods. There it was, that old shed. Now even older. Busted windows and black graffiti. Expecting the usual vulgar phrases and dick drawings, it’s safe to say we were caught by surprise.

Sure, it was graffiti alright, but it was... different. One phrase.

“What is this?” Jose blurted out.

“Follow the power,” it read. The words were not too legible. A can of rusted black spray paint lay on the ground.

“Maybe... it leads to the geocache?” Jose said.

“You can’t be serious.” I replied. He shrugged.

We looked at each other. This went on for minutes. We pondered what to do. 

Curiosity got the better of us.

Outside of the gravel of the power plant, in between the woods, lay a vast trail lined by massive power lines. Hesitantly, we followed the trail. 

It stretched on forever. An endless plain running through the vast woods. I’m not sure how long we walked. Maybe hours.

The sun was now beginning to set and our parents were worried. Both of us received non-stop calls and texts from them, we eventually silenced our phones.

The trail stopped, and the woods began again. Dead-end. 

“Should we keep going?” I asked.

“Well, we followed the power lines, but I see nothing.” Jose said.

“I can’t believe we’re doing this. What are we gonna tell our parents?” I said.

“I don’t know, man. We made it this far. We might as well keep going.” Jose said.

I nodded, and we stepped into the woods. It was dead quiet. Only broken up by the crunching of leaves and snapping of twigs beneath our feet. We trudged onward, trying our best to be quiet. We didn’t know what we’d find. Much less what we were looking for. Curiosity is a powerful thing.

We had both grown uneasy, beginning to smell an indescribable stench. Something felt wrong. My stomach churned. 

Then we reached a clearing. We froze, for before us stood an inexplicable sight. A group standing in the clearing. Adorned in coats made of dark brown fur. 

Their attire was the least of my concerns. Those faces. I can still picture them clearly. They were missing their eyes and mouths, yet they still had noses. It was as if God forgot to add those features when creating them.

“What the fuck?” Jose whispered to me. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end and my heart rate increased. We were not supposed to be here. Everything in me wanted to run, but I was petrified. I just stared ahead. Could they see me? I shuddered. And what were they doing here?

Something else came out of the woods. A wolf or a coyote. Only... it was standing on its hind legs. In its grasp, a crude knife. It was something straight out of an archaeological dig. I’d seen nothing similar. Again, my fight-or-flight response was leaning towards flight, but my body just did not respond. Jose too. We didn’t say a word to one another. Out of fear.

A lump formed in my throat. I anxiously expected what was going to happen. I could not look away. One by one, the wolf walked up to the faceless people and... began carving. It took its knife and carved into their faces. Soon, what felt like an eternity later, each of the beings, now had a face. Beady eyes and crooked mouths, they were even more terrifying than before. The wolf then strolled back into the woods, while those things just stood there...

By now, I had seen enough. Jose must have had the same thought. My curiosity left and was replaced by survival. Slowly, we tiptoed backwards through the woods, clenching our teeth, hoping they couldn’t hear us.

“I think they’re looking at us.” Jose whispered through chattering teeth. A shiver went over my whole body. He was right, I could feel those black eyes staring right at us. We took off running and never looked back.

Jose and I never told anyone about that night, who the hell would believe us anyways? I still don’t know what those things were, and I hope I never find out. I don’t know who wrote the graffiti on that shed. Was it them? I’ll never know.
