My friends Jose, Luke, and I always search for new things. We invented challenges and explored every inch of our hometown. Not long ago we discovered geocaching. The three of us downloaded this app on our phones and set out. Filling our backpack with miscellaneous junk to replace any “treasures” we found, we rode out on our bikes. We didn’t find too much. A panda pencil hugger and a 2 dollar bill were among our top finds.

Soon, the app leads us off the beaten path. In between our neighborhood and the next, there’s a dead end road that leads to a power plant surrounded by the woods. Through said woods, a dirt path lined by massive power lines.

“Should we be worried about, you know, electrocution?” I say as we pull up to the spot.

“Nah, we’re fine,” says Jose.
We search and search. This geocache is nowhere to be found. I mean, we’ve scoured everywhere except for the more dangerous spots.

“Bro, it’s not here. Somebody already got it,” said Luke.

“Yeah, they must have forgotten to replace it.” Jose says.

We call it quits, walking back up towards the road.

The following day, our trio is hanging out as usual. Luke’s little brother Gary comes to join us. This is unusual, because he’s, well, a hermit. I don't believe he’d seen the sun since last summer. This kid plays computer games from dusk till dawn. We tell him of yesterday’s Geocaching experience, and he wants to try it himself. We agree, we’re still curious and excited.

Gary rides on Luke’s handlebars because he’s small enough. We make it to the dead end, he's having a blast.

“Hey, we didn't try searching the woods yet.” Jose says.
On second thought, not a great idea. Our attire most certainly does not suit a venture into the woods. Thorns, bugs, more thorns, it’s awful. Wanting to give up, but something stops us. A lone white shed.

“Woah, what the heck? Why’s that out here?” Jose says.

“Hmm. Maybe it’s for hunting deer or something?” I say.

“Here? By the power plant? We’re not even that deep into the woods.” Luke points out.

“Good point. That is odd.” I say.

“Wanna go see it?” Jose says, motioning in its direction.

“No way dude.” Luke says “Are you crazy?”

“Let's go.” I say pointing towards the out-of-place building. 

Busted windows and black graffiti. Expecting the usual vulgar phrases and dick drawings, it’s safe to say we were caught by surprise.

Sure, it was graffiti alright, but it was... different. One phrase.

“What is this?” Jose blurted out.

“Follow the power,” it read. The words were not too legible. A can of rusted black spray paint lay on the ground.

“Maybe... it leads to the geocache?” Jose said.

“You can’t be serious.” I replied. He shrugged.

We looked at each other. This went on for minutes. We pondered what to do. 

Curiosity got the better of us.

Outside of the gravel of the power plant, in between the woods, lay a vast trail lined by massive power lines. Hesitantly, we followed the trail. 

It stretched on forever. An endless plain running through the vast woods. I’m not sure how long we walked. Maybe hours.

The sun was now beginning to set and our parents were worried. All of us received non-stop calls and texts from them, we eventually silenced our phones.

The trail stopped, and the woods began again. Seemingly another dead-end. 

“Should we keep going?” I asked.

“Well, we followed the power lines, but I see nothing.” Jose said.

“I can’t believe we’re doing this. What are we gonna tell our parents?” I said.

“I don’t know, man. We made it this far. We might as well keep going.” Luke said.

I nodded, and we stepped into the woods. It was dead quiet. Only broken up by the crunching of leaves and snapping of twigs beneath our feet. We trudged onward, trying our best to be quiet. We didn’t know what we’d find. Much less what we were looking for. Curiosity is a powerful thing.

We had grown uneasy, beginning to smell an indescribable stench. Something felt wrong. My stomach churned. 

Then we reached a clearing. We froze, for before us stood an inexplicable sight. A group standing in the clearing. Adorned in coats made of dark brown fur. 

Their attire was the least of my concerns. Those faces. I can still picture them clearly. They were missing their eyes and mouths, yet they still had noses. It was as if God forgot to add those features when creating them.

“What the fuck?” Jose whispered to me. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end and my heart rate increased. We were not supposed to be here. Everything in me wanted to run, but I was petrified. I just stared ahead. Could they see me? I shuddered. And what were they doing here?

Something else came out of the woods. A wolf or a coyote. Only... it was standing on its hind legs. In its grasp, a crude knife. It was something straight out of an archaeological dig. I’d seen nothing similar. Again, my fight-or-flight response was leaning towards flight, but my body just did not respond. None of us said a word to one another.

A lump formed in my throat. I anxiously expected what was going to happen. I could not look away. One by one, the wolf walked up to the faceless people and... began carving. It took its knife and carved into their faces. Soon, what felt like an eternity later, each of the beings, now had a face. Beady eyes and crooked mouths, they were even more terrifying than before. The wolf then strolled back into the woods, while those things just stood there...

By now, I had seen enough. The others must have had the same thought. My curiosity left and was replaced by survival. Slowly, we tiptoed backwards through the woods, clenching our teeth, hoping they couldn’t hear us.

“I think they’re looking at us.” Jose whispered through chattering teeth. A shiver went over my whole body. He was right, I could feel those black eyes staring right at us. 

“Go, go!” I say in a scream whisper. We haul ass without looking back, disregarding the many thorns grabbing us. 

Just as we're exiting the woods into the power plant. A loud mechanical noise cuts through the trees. Its roar shakes us to our core. Luke even throws Gary onto his shoulders. Grabbing our bikes as fast as possible, slamming those kick stands, we pedal back to civilization. Those things chased us the entire way, stopping only as we exited the power plant.

We walk with our bikes along the road, relieved that we escaped and no longer have anyone following us. The dim street lights illuminate our way. We take our phones off silent, bombarded with missed calls and texts from our families.

“Oh god, they must be so worried.” I say.

We then hear a siren coming from a police car. The red and blue lights come zooming around the corner. 

“Our parents must have called the police. Guess we’d better go talk to them.” Jose says.

As we approach the vehicle, I felt everything will be alright. That is until I see the officer. Similar to those forest creatures, he lacks eyes and a mouth.

We run again, but the cop remains still. My friends and I make it home to our parents’ relief. We’re, of course, grounded for at least the next month.

Later that night, I lay in bed, my eyes wide open. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t shake that feeling. I kept trying to reassure myself. They couldn’t leave the woods, right? I mean, they stopped following us, so as long as we didn’t go back to the power plant, we’ll be safe. Why did they stop chasing us? But what about the cop? 

I text Luke and Jose, checking if they’re okay, and relaying my thoughts to them, hoping they have more answers than I. No response from either.

I hear chiming dings of text tones. It’s coming from outside my window.

I peel back the blinds, peeking through them, my hands shaking. My friends on the other side stare, their eyes beady and animalistic, smiles jagged. I fear I soon will meet a similar fate.
