My neighbors missing kid was right there in my wife’s hands, my wife looked gigantic compared to the infants small body. My wife, she’d chewed through the lower half of its body, there was no way it could still be alive.

I didn’t sleep after I dragged her back home. Didn’t even pretend. I just sat on the couch in the dark, staring at her bedroom door, waiting for something to tear through it. The way she’d looked at me in the woods wasn’t hunger or madness. It was instinct. Like something else was piloting her body.

When the sun finally crawled up, I went to make coffee. The smell hit before I even touched the machine — that sweet, rotten tang of fermented fruit and dead meat. The sink overflowed with knives I didn’t recognize. Heavy ones. Serrated ones. Ones with bone dust caked in the grooves.

Footsteps behind me. Slow. Dragging.
“I cleaned,” she said.

I turned. She hadn’t cleaned a damn thing. She’d gutted the kitchen. Every cupboard emptied. Every dish gone. The table shoved aside so she could lay down a sheet of thick black tarp, the kind used in places where blood is basically a guarantee. The floor around it crackled with dried brown smears.

“What is this?” I asked.
She smiled like a puppet. “A workspace. It’s easier this way.”

My brain refused to process the rest.

The house didn’t change overnight. It decayed. First she dragged our chest freezer from the garage into the dining room and packed it with towel-wrapped shapes that dripped. Then she ripped the doors off the cabinets because “the smell gets trapped.” She hammered hooks into the walls and started hanging things. Limbs. Skins. Tiny ribcages like snapped umbrellas. Some were animals.

Some weren’t.

I forced myself to leave early, come home late, pretend everything was fine. But the house kept transforming into a butcher’s den, and she drifted through it like she’d been born to do it.

On the fourth night, she made dinner. Candles only. The air was thick with that metallic tang you taste when you hold a penny on your tongue. She slid a plate toward me — a dark, soft-edged slab of meat that looked…wrong.

I didn’t touch it.
“You don’t trust me,” she whispered.

Her jaw twitched under her skin like something tightening from the inside.
“I’m worried about you,” I said.

She repeated the word like she was testing it. Then she leaned in and pressed her forehead to mine. Her breath was warm and sour, like it came from somewhere deeper than lungs.

“They’re all worried about me,” she breathed. “They watch me. They whisper behind the walls. They tell me what to eat. What to *want*.”

Her voice trembled.
“I’m trying to be good, Jack. I’m trying so hard.”

Her eyes weren’t bloodshot anymore — they were glossy, sharp, polished like stones. I refused the meat. She didn’t argue. She just smiled and ate it herself, slow, savoring every tendon that snapped between her teeth.

That night I stopped researching help and started researching monsters. Folklore. Possession. Curses. Because no mental illness teaches someone to crave carrion. No breakdown gives you instincts. No psychosis changes your body.

So I searched one word: **Wendigo.**

The deeper I read, the worse it lined up — not perfectly, but close enough to make my skin crawl. A hunger that wasn’t human. A spirit that seeped into a person through grief or desperation. Not possession. Corruption. A soul-rotting disease.

And the pattern matched.
Roadkill wasn’t enough anymore.
Animals weren’t enough.
She needed freshness.

The thought hooked into me like a barb: she’s cursed. She’s sick. I’m the only one who can fix it.

The house kept mutating. The living room became a drying room — strips of meat dangling from the ceiling fan like prayer flags from hell. She kept the fireplace burning nonstop because “it helps with the smell.” The bathroom turned into a washing station. Towels in the hamper dried stiff and crunchy. The hall closet filled with jars containing things I won’t put into words.

The only untouched space was our bedroom. I knew why. She was saving it.

Last night, everything tipped. I came home at 2 a.m., after hours of driving just to avoid the place. The house was dark but alive — faint thumps, dragging sounds, soft humming like someone crooning in their sleep.

I followed it to the kitchen.
She was bent over the tarp table, cutting something, humming a lullaby my mother used to sing. Something small lay wrapped in a blanket. A blue one. Covered in cartoon planets.

The neighbor’s kid had that blanket.

The one who’d gone missing.

My chest caved in. She didn’t even notice me. She was too focused, too gentle with her blade, whispering, “I’m learning. I’m getting better. I’m almost perfect.”

I backed away, silent, my heartbeat shaking my ribs. And the entire time one thought pulsed through my skull:

If she’s cursed, she’s not responsible.
If she’s not responsible, she can be cured.
If she can be cured, I can save her.

By the time I reached the bedroom, I believed it completely.

So today, I bought chains. Real ones — the kind used to pin down engines. I bought heavy locks, industrial ones. A space heater for the crawl space. I sat in my truck afterward, staring at myself like a stranger.

I’m not doing this because she’s dangerous.
I’m doing it because she’s sick.
I’m her husband. I swore to take care of her.

Tonight, I’ll bring her into the crawl space. I’ll talk soft, hug her so she doesn’t suspect anything, then chain her down. Keep her warm. Feed her whatever she needs. Work on a cure.

I can fix this. I have to. I’m the only one who knows what she’s turning into. And the only one stupid enough to still believe she can come back.

The scratching above the ceiling just stopped.
She knows I’m awake.
She’s standing outside the door. Breathing. Slow. Hungry.

I’m opening the door now.

Wish me luck.
