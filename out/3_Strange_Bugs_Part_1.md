I’ve been an exterminator for twenty odd years now. And all twenty years have been in Blinkville, so emphasis on the “odd.” I don’t know how many stories the average Blinkville resident has, but I’ve had three different jobs that left me scratching my head. The third of which happened just a couple days ago and encouraged me to sit down and do this whole thing. It was the freakiest one yet.

However, what I’ll be letting all of you in on today is my first story, which took place just two years into my bug-killing career. This one was weird from the jump.

The first assignment I had listed that day was titled, “Toenail Beetle.” Typical titles include, “Hornet Nest - Porch, Roach Infestation, Termites - Basement.” So I go to Cindy at the front desk and she starts laughing when she sees me before I can even get a word out.

“Yep,” she says.

And I go, “The fuck is a Toenail Beetle?”

And she explains that the guy on the phone said a beetle was chewing off his toenail. In case some of you have been misinformed: beetles don’t do this.

*Great*, I thought. *My first looney*.

On the drive over to this guy’s house, I’m thinking he’s some degenerate who doesn’t leave the house, who let a foot infection go unchecked and now has a rotting toe that’s got bugs crawling all around it. I’m preparing for my grossest job yet. But I get there and the house looks well-kept, and when the guy comes to the door, he looks completely regular. He must’ve only been a couple years younger than I was at the time. Probably graduated from college not too long before, and recently bought this one-story house for himself. So now I’m even more confused.

He says his name is Jeremiah and that his problem started a couple days prior. Started out with him noticing a small hole in the nail of his big toe. He assumed he’d stubbed his toe or something. Didn’t pay it any mind. Something he noticed after showering before getting on with his work for the night. The next day, the hole’s bigger. Like a crater in his nail. The edges are ridged, like a flaky, white ring in the middle of all that pink. This left him more befuddled, and he tried to search online for what could’ve caused it. All he could find were funguses and infections that didn’t make any sense for him to have. The toe looked fine besides the hole in the nail. The skin beneath it was sensitive, of course, but there wasn’t a constant pain. So, he ignored it.

That night, he wakes up to a shooting pain in that toe. A sharp stinging. He kicks off his blanket and feels something crawl from that very toe, down his foot, and onto the bed. He sits up and sees a beetle crawling away. Gets up from the bed and can’t seem to find it anywhere. Then he notices his toe is bleeding, from a noticeably bigger hole in his nail. All that was left was the upper part of his nail, some pink and white at the top. Now he’s freaked, so he puts a bandaid over his big toe and slips on some socks.

When he goes back to sleep he feels it again. He sits up and tries to stand up right away. He feels something crawling up his leg, out of the sock. He slaps his leg, only to feel it gone. He looks over and sees a beetle crawling off to a wall. Says that it’s got a pink back. He ran after it, but saw it crawl into a crack in the lower paneling of the wall before he could reach it.

He took off his sock to find the band aid peeled open a bit, bent up like a bridge. More blood seeping through the gaping hole in his nail.

“Fucking thing was biting into my toe! The hole’s deeper now. Like…it’s fucking eating the skin beneath my toenail, man!”

Needless to say, I wasn’t trained for this shit. I asked him if I could see his toe. Not that I could do anything, but I wasn’t sure where the hell else to start.

Jeremiah sits in a kitchen chair and takes off his sock and the band aid wrapped tight around his big toe. I kneel down. Sure enough, there’s barely any nail left. Just the slight edges by the skin, and a bit more left at the top. It looked like a leaf a ladybug had just made a picnic of. The skin within the crater of the open nail was raw and moist with blood. The middle of this wound was deeper than the bits of skin on the edges. Jeremiah’s big toe was making a good case for him. It certainly looked like something was chewing through there. I got queasy wondering how much skin was left before his bone.

I stood up. “Can you show me the crack it ran off through?”

I’m no doctor. I had no idea what to do about his toe. And I’m no hunter. Exterminators eliminate infestations. Hives. Not singular bugs. On top of this, I had never heard of a beetle with a pink exoskeleton. I figured he must’ve been mistaken, only seeing the bug in the dark and from a distance. But then again, nothing about this assignment made any sense.

I put insecticide around the crack and tried to reassure him. “If this is where it’s coming and going from, then this’ll take care of it. I’m gonna look around for any other possible routes it could be taking, if that’s okay with you.”

“By all means,” he said. “Have you-?”

I knew what he was going to ask. “No.” I can be very frank when I don’t know how else to be. “I’ve never heard of anything like this before.”

His expression looked more worrisome after I said this and I felt bad. I pointed to his toe. “You should get that thing wrapped up as tight as you can. Put some ointment on it or somethin’.”

I told him I’d be back the same time tomorrow, so he wouldn’t have to worry about calling. Wasn’t a busy week, so I could just stop by and see if the bug had come out or not. I laced some more insecticide around other cracks and went on my way. That night, I called my uncle. He’d been an exterminator since I was little. He was the reason I got into it. Not that I’d been entirely passionate about killing bugs. To be totally honest, I just wasn’t sure what else to do once I turned eighteen. Exterminating didn’t require a college education, it paid pretty well, and I’d have the help of my uncle, so that’s the road I went down.

I told him about this toenail beetle and waited for any advice he could offer. All he said was, “You crush that thing under your foot and act like it was any other bug. That’s how you get on in this town.” It wasn’t exactly what I was looking for. I was hoping for some relatability maybe. He’d been working in Blinkville about as long as I’d been alive, so I wanted to hear if he’d dealt with an unheard of bug before. “Got that?” he asked. I got the feeling that he had dealt with things of this nature before, but that this was all I was gonna get out of him. “Yes sir,” I answered.

Jeremiah was crying and sipping from a liter of whiskey when I saw him the next day. I’d knocked on the door and heard a, “Come in,” before spotting him at the kitchen table, barefoot.

“It got me, man.” He cried, rubbing his forehead. “It fucking *got* me.”

*Jesus Christ*. I don’t do well with hysterical people. I'm not *supposed* to deal with hysterical people. I kill bugs for chrissake.

I walk over to the table, and of course I’m lookin’ at his foot, and I see that his toe is fine. The same big toe that was chewed through and bleeding looked good as new, with a shiny, pink toe nail.

I sat down beside him and he explained without me havin’ to ask.

“It’s in there, man. It’s in my fucking toe and I swear to God it’s close to the bone.”

He slid his laptop over to me. He’d looked up diagrams of toes, showing the layers from nail to skin to bone. The bone isn’t too deep past your nail, in fact, it’s fairly close to the surface.

I frowned and looked down. He lifted up his foot and sat it on his chair. Swear to God, from beneath that new toe nail he had two antennas sticking out. I held a finger close to the nail and he scooted back.

“*Don’t!*” He held up a hand. “Do *not* touch the antennas. *Please*.”

I had yet to say a single fucking word. Seeing is believing and I was seeing a bug burrowed in his toe. It was like some sick joke. The beetle’s exoskeleton wasn’t just pink, it resembled a toenail. Same shape and everything. You could only tell it was an exoskeleton by looking closely, eyeing the line that ran down the middle, where it would fold when the beetle wasn’t camouflaged. But at that moment, the exoskeleton laid flat, the line just barely visible.

Plenty of bugs have camouflage. I’m sure you’re all familiar with leaf and stick insects. But they adapt to blend in with nature, not humans. And beetles specifically only ever camouflage with color, blending in with tree bark or leaves.

“If you touch it, it moves or bites or *something*! I don’t fucking know, but it hurts like nothing else!”

I ran my fingers through my hair and stared at his toe. “You just woke up with that thing in your foot?”

He shot his head back with another sip of bourbon. “The fucking ointment, man! I got this rapid-seal wound gel. Supposed to heal it and numb the pain, but I should’ve fucking known! It must’ve numbed it too much. I didn’t feel this thing last night. I didn’t wake up at all. It finished the job. It’s in my fucking toe!”

I didn’t tell him to calm down because he had every right to freak out. “I can feel it,” he muttered. “I can feel it sitting there.”

Shit made me twitch. Just imagining an insect burrowing in my body. It’s making me jitter right now, as a matter of fact, recalling that image.

“I’ve just been sitting here waiting for you, man. I can’t do anything. If I so much as touch that fucking nail, it fights back.”

My mind was racing. My uncle’s words circled through my head. *You crush that thing under your foot.* Well I couldn’t exactly do that when it was in someone *else's* foot.

“We…,” I started, “we need to call an ambulance or-.”

“No,” Jeremiah stated, with a strange calmness that was absent from his previous words. “No, man. I need this out right now. This fucking bug is *in* my foot!”

The alcohol was clearly wearing on him. I realized he’d probably been sipping whiskey since he woke up with antennas sticking out of his toe.

“You’re a fucking exterminator! Can’t you do something? Isn’t this-?”

“Look,” I shut him up, “I’ve got an idea, alright? But I just want to make sure. You don’t want to call any medics?”

“No! No, I want this fucker out of my foot right n-!”

I thought it’d be better if I did it without a heads up. I grabbed the whiskey from the table, and before he could react, I was pouring it on his big toe.

I started to feel unsure of my decision once Jeremiah started wailing. The beetle must’ve been retaliating, biting nerves. The beetle’s exoskeleton, the false nail, was shifting around, out of place. I poured some more and thought Jeremiah would pass out. The nail shifted up. The line down the middle folded either side of the nail down. I could see it. The beetle was squirming, its legs sunken into red skin. I gave it another shot. Third time was the charm. The beetle squirmed out and fell to the ground. Its poisoned body moved like it was as intoxicated as Jeremiah, but it was still as quick as ever. It crawled up my shoe.

My chair fell over when I stood up and kicked the beetle against the bottom of the table. I looked at my foot and it was gone. I knelt down and looked under the table and saw it squirming across the hardwood floor. 

Beetles can have surprisingly strong exoskeletons. Ironclad beetles, for example, can even survive getting run over by a car. This toenail beetle appeared to be unscathed. I moved the table and went after it. I stomped and stomped and managed to land a hit. I lifted up my foot and it was gone. It crawled up from the bottom of my shoe and went to my ankle. It started to squirm into my sock when I pinched it between my fingers and got a hold of it. I held it to the ground and crushed it nice and slow with my foot, sounding a satisfying crunch. I dragged it against the ground with the sole of my shoe, leaving a trail of goo like a snail.

I put my chair back up and took a seat. Jeremiah was taking long-winded breaths, arms hanging down beside him. Poor bastard’s toe was bleeding like hell, red strings of skin hanging from the open nail like wet party streamers.

“Now…,” he said, almost in a whisper, “now maybe we should call an ambulance.”

That was just another drunk rambling. I assured him he wouldn’t want a medical bill for something he could disinfect and patch up on his own.

I looked at the beetle’s remains. It looked like a crushed, pink skittle. All cracks and lines with beige-green blood seeping through, little limbs sticking out all around.

I laid down some more insecticide before I left, just to comfort him. I told him I’d be back tomorrow just in case. But I knew there wouldn’t be anymore toenail beetles. I wasn’t sure why, but I just knew. I guess that’s just how things go in Blinkville. Something I’d come to learn all too well.
