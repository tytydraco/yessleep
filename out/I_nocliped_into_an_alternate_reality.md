By the title, this might not seem believable, but I'm trapped in a weird place that looks like my room but isn't. I woke up this morning and took a shower like I usually do. I got out and got dressed and after, I went to my room to pack as I'm leaving in a week to move to London as my fiancé and daughter live there. After I walked into the room I already felt a bit off, the feeling is hard to describe but I just felt off, like something was out of place or, someone was out of place. I walked in and started packing. All I did was get up to get water, I tripped and fell, but nothing too bad, just a small scratch. I brushed myself off and got back up. I didn't think much of it as all I did was trip. I walked out of my room and suddenly I was back where I was turned around. I faced the door again and it was closed.

 “What?” I thought. I tried again and the same outcome faced the opposite way with the door closed. I called my sister as she is only 5 minutes away from my house, “Hello?” She asked, “Hi! I went through my bedroom door and got moved back and the door closed behind me without me closing it please help me! I'm stuck!” I answered, “What? You teleported and your door closed by itself?! That's honestly cool but I won't fall for that.” she said laughing, “I'm serious Ashley! Please just come and help me!” I said pleading, “Alright, but if this is a joke I'm gonna be so mad!” she said hanging up the phone. I looked at my battery, 12 percent. I had a charger and tried plugging in my phone but it wouldn't work no matter what I did it wouldn't charge even though I know it wasn't broken before this morning. 

I heard my front door open and shut and her calling out for me. “Leah! Leah! Where are you!” “I'm in here! Please the door won't work!” I said. I saw my bedroom door creak open a bit but she wasn't in the room. “Leah? I'm seriously gonna kill her.” She said and the door creaked shut. I didn't see her and she didn't see me either. I called her, “Your ‘joke’ isn't funny.” she said sighing, “ I'm here! Please just come back!” I said crying, “ Your not funny Leah I'm not putting up with your bullsh*t today I just woke up.” She hung up. That was 5 minutes ago and I'm trying my best to make up a plan I'll update you when I think of something or something that happens.

Update, I called the police and they didn't believe me. I couldn't explain how I no-clipped out and back into my room. I called my mom who lived farther but made it here just 30 minutes later. She walked in still on the phone will me, “I can't see you.” she said. I said I know and she call a paranormal investigator to see what would have happened. I couldn't see him but I could hear him. “So she no-clipped?” he asked, “yes so she's in the room but she's not audible or visible to us. Same with her, we're not visible to her either, although she claims to hear us.” She wanted to test it out and muted herself, “If you can hear us, say pink duck-billed zebra!” She said. She unmuted herself and I said what she wanted me to say. She was convinced. She hung up and said she would be right back. She just left, I'll update y'all in a bit.

Update 2, I can't hear her anymore. She also hasn't called back. I'm writing the rest of this fast as I'm on 2 percent and once my phone is dead I will be silenced and never be able to make contact will y'all again. I'm alone. I'm spending the rest of my time texting goodbye to friends and family. They didn't believe me but they will find out soon I wasn't lying. I have snacks in my draws as I eat food in my room. Call me a slob but it saved me. I'm on 1 percent, I'll update again if I ever make it out. Goodbye world.
