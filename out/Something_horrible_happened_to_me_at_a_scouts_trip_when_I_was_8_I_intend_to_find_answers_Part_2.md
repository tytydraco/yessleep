The image of the shoe I had lost those many years ago chilled my blood. It was left there on the step of the cabin, as if it were a mere gift, an invitation.  

  
  
“You forgot this.” it seemed to say, mocking me, goading me into going back.   
  
    
  
It was remarkably well-kept despite the passage of time, as if it had been pulled free from the muck and lovingly kept aside for me all these years.   
  
    
  
The thought sent me right back to that horrible place in the woods, to that cold, muddy clearing where the thing that wasn’t Counsellor Murphy chased me to the edge of my sanity. I could feel the ice-cold muck around my foot again, pulling me down as I frantically attempted to escape like an animal in a trap.   
  
    
  
A part of my innocence was left behind in that clearing along with that shoe.  

  
  
Places of wonder in the world did not call to me since that day. Forests and mountains, rivers and seas; none held the promise of adventure and escape from mundane reality. All were dark houses to me, where vile twisted things lay waiting, far from the light and warmth of civilisation. Though the thing with too many joints never got me, part of me was killed within those black trees. It was sucked down into the muck and never pulled free, left to mummify until it remained as an infantile bog body, locked away from all light and wonder in the world.   
  
    
  
Instinct screamed at me to distance myself from it all, unless I wanted to be wounded in that way again.   
  
    
  
I took some time to compose myself as these memories hit me like a truck. It took no small measure of willpower to lift my phone again, and read Jake Kerrigan’s message that accompanied the pictures.   
  
    
  
He had sent another message in the time I needed to calm down. He must have known I would want to block him forever.   
  
    
  
“Look, I know I was an absolute prick to you. To be honest, I’ve been eaten by guilt these past few years when I think back on it all. I completely understand if you don’t even want to give me the time of day, but I need someone to talk to myself. I’ve talked to the others, but they don’t get it. They just remember it as some dramatic thing that happened at scouts. They weren’t affected by it enough, but we were. Breda just shuts down when I bring it up. Please just give me a chance. I need answers, and respectfully, I think you need them too.”   
  
    
  
He was of course completely right. Despite not wishing to ever speak about the incident again, it had been hanging over me for all these years, always there in the back of my mind, in my dreams, and leering at me from the woods; of which there are too damn many, everywhere I look.    
  
    
  
I had to see him.   
  
    
  
\*\*\*   
  
    
  
We met the next day for a quiet pint at the pub where Jake worked. It was an “old man’s pub”, fit for a handful select locals who practically lived there, with the occasional sports event. It was well before opening time, but Jake was the manager, and exercised his position to let me in. He poured some complementary pints and asked me how I was.   
  
    
  
Despite our past animosity, we chatted as if we were old friends. Time and trauma make excellent mortar for mutual respect it seemed.   
  
    
  
Awkward pauses became frequent as the pints of stout settled. He fidgeted, filling the silence with mutterings of “Sure look.”, the timeless silence-filler of Irish conversation. He drank the stout before it settled - a barman would never. He was clearly occupying his mouth with drink rather than with the words needed to address the elephant in the room, so I decided to break the ice.   
  
    
  
‘Why does Breda shut down when you bring “it” up to her?’   
  
    
  
He took a moment to respond.   
  
    
  
‘… Well, she has her own kids now… I suppose she doesn’t like anything related to what happened to us being near them. She’s very eh… picturesque, real social media mammy type now. She carried what she saw with her all these years, so my guess is that she is scared to death of her own kids carrying anything horrible like that.’   
  
    
  
‘What did she see Jake?’   
  
    
  
‘Ah fuck…’ he breathed, as he reached beneath the bar and pulled out an old camcorder. ‘Let’s sit down for this one.’   
  
    
  
We did, and he prepared the camera.   
  
    
  
‘I was going through my old scouts stuff in the attic, and I came across Breda’s camera. I decided to swap the batteries and look at the footage, see if there was anything Breda wanted to keep before the camera got damaged or whatever. I’m about to show you what Breda saw.’   
  
    
  
A chill ran down my spine at the prospect of seeing something that I had only seen in my nightmares for so many years. Did she see what I saw? Did she see something like it?   
  
    
  
‘I knew in my gut that she saw something. I asked her to see it, but like I said she always shut down. The camera went missing and I thought she threw it out. I didn’t have the heart to pursue it any further - I wanted to forget it and move on. We all did, dad included.’   
  
    
  
Jake powered the camera on, and selected the video clip. Wordlessly I watched him, too frozen with fear and curiosity to ask him to wait.   
  
    
  
Grainy footage played on the tiny LCD screen, a noisy black screen broken up by occasional flashlight beams and childish faces. Breda and her friends were chatting away, excited but spooked to be in such an unsettling place in each other's company.   
  
    
  
Breda stopped to tie her laces.   
  
    
  
‘Will ye wait for me! Stooooop!’ she squealed as her friends playfully left her behind the group in the darkness alone.   
  
    
  
She leaned down, setting the camera and light to face her shoe while she tied her laces. Heavy seconds passed as the woods were visible behind her. I expected to see something, and my heart almost leapt as the visual grain instilled a sense of pareidolia in me, frightened of faces that weren’t there.   
  
    
  
Her laces tied, she picked up the camera and light and made to catch up with the group. Then the microphone picked up a sound nearby.   
  
    
  
*Kitch.*   
  
    
  
Tree branches snapping underfoot.   
  
    
  
Breda whirled around, commanding her friends to come out and stop scaring her.   
  
    
  
*Kitch.*   
  
    
  
‘Lads will ye stoooop! I don’t like it anymore! Shannon I can see your head!’   
  
    
  
My stomach lurched. Behind a tree trunk, a pale forehead could be seen. As if in slow motion, a face slithered forth. Breda screamed so hard that the camera mic registered it as a shrill buzz. There wasn’t much time to make out the thing’s features. It didn’t help that Jake had to set the camera down as his hand was shaking too much. He watched it as I did, a hand clasped over his mouth while his knee bounced nervously.   
  
    
  
What we did see was a serpentine neck, far too long. Eyes, too many and too small, embedded in pallid flesh caked with dirt. Matted black hair, much like the thing that chased me. And a wicked smile, as if Breda’s scream was music to its ears.   
  
    
  
The rest of the clip consisted of Breda running to the group, frantically telling them about the “face she saw”, her friends consoling her, and promptly turning the camera off once the group began to make their way back to camp.   
  
    
  
Jake and I sat in silence for a long minute. Jake was the one to break this one.   
  
    
  
‘I thought it was a mask just from the way Breda described it… I should have looked at the video years ago, but like I said, Breda would always shut down when I brought it up. I thought about looking for the camera myself, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I only managed to work up the courage after all these years, when I found it by accident.’ he laughed, as if ashamed of something he thought should be silly. We both knew it wasn’t.   
  
    
  
‘Jake, I need to know… what was it that you saw out the cabin window?’   
  
    
  
Jake’s smile dropped slightly, and he slapped his hands on his lap, took a deep breath, and downed his pint. With a smack of satisfaction, he breathed the words “ahh fuck.”, and proceeded to fish some whiskey from the bar.   
  
    
  
He downed a shot, and indicated the bottle. *Work away.*   
  
    
  
I poured one too, and awaited his response. 

  
  
‘So, the Gardaí got there, and were looking around the woods. No one told us anything. I was mad curious, and I suppose the mixed emotions got me all restless. I wasn’t able to just stay still - when dad told me not to bother them, it made me want to bother them more. Look, I’ll hold my hands up and say I was a little shithead, but you’ll be happy to know that what I saw put some manners on me.’   
  
    
  
He poured some more whiskey, his hands unsteady.   
  
    
  
‘Around the back, there was a wooden bunker for storing firewood. The Gardaí were combing through the woods, but I saw a few of them standing around the bunker. They were moving stuff - I thought it was lumps of firewood. One of the flashlight beams moved across the scene in the second that one of them held a lump of firewood… only it wasn’t a lump of firewood…. Fuck.’   
  
    
  
He downed his whiskey that he had intended on sipping, and with a fiery exhale, he looked down into his emptied glass, swilling around the last drops. His voice burnt down to a whisper.   
  
    
  
‘I saw Counsellor Murphy looking right at me from the Gardaí’s hands.’   
  
    
  
My stomach lurched as one of the age-old mysteries from that horrible night had finally been answered. Whatever it was that had taken the form of Counsellor Murphy had clearly murdered her, stuffing her dismembered remains into the bunker. 

  
  
‘I don’t know if you know this, but the scouts disbanded soon after all this happened. My dad couldn’t hack it. Scouts kept him busy, kept him off the drink. So when the parents understandably didn’t want to send their kids anymore, he really took it hard.’   
  
    
  
‘I’m sorry Jake.’   
  
    
  
‘Ah no… it was going to happen, and through no fault of any of us.’   
  
    
  
He moved seat across the table and looked at me levelly.   
  
    
  
‘I’ve shown you what Breda saw. Now I need to know what you saw.’   
  
    
  
There was a sternness in his eyes, a burning need to know what I saw. But it was not an unkind look; they were the eyes of someone who knew how much they didn’t know.   
  
    
  
He continued. ‘I remember we left for the hike with dad. You stayed behind with Counsellor Murphy. By the time we got back, she was…  you were running from the woods and the Gardaí were called. My side of it is that she was murdered - dad showed me the newspaper clipping from when it happened.    
The Gardaí told him that they reckon you made up a story to deal with surviving whoever attacked you and Counsellor Murphy. Had to catch him during a particularly rough binge, and even then it took a lot of convincing to talk about it. To this day, he still thinks the killer is out there. Well, he isn’t really wrong is he?’   
  
    
  
‘No, he isn’t.’ I confirmed. ‘So that’s what the Gardaí thought of my answers so? That I was making shit up just to cope?’ I scoffed and shook my head. ‘I suppose I can’t blame them - I wouldn’t believe me either. But the story I told them was true. Something wore the skin of Counsellor Murphy and lured me to those woods while I was alone. I have no video to prove it, but I can tell you it wasn’t much different from the thing that Breda saw.’   
  
    
  
‘I believe you.’ Jake stated with solemn certainty. ‘I kept thinking about that day over and over again, I’ve lost sleep over it. But it occurred to me - the firewood bunker… did you notice that we never had to go to it even once?’   
  
    
  
‘What do you mean?’   
  
    
  
‘All the firewood we needed for the bonfire was already stacked when we arrived. More than enough - so that we’d have no need to go to the bunker.’   
  
    
  
Another chill ran down my spine as I realised the calculated malice at play.   
  
    
  
‘The thing planned it in advance...’   
  
    
  
‘Yeah, and it had an accomplice too I reckon, going by Breda’s video.’   
  
    
  
I told him of my time in the clearing with the thing with too many joints, and the story it told me of the “Mound People” in the brief time it wore the form of Counsellor Murphy.   
  
    
  
‘Mound People… so there could be even more. And we have an idea of how they think. Still don’t know why they’re doing what they do though. I’d call them animals, but animals could never understand us well enough to form a plan like that.’   
  
    
  
‘They’ve probably been doing it all this time. Who knows how many missing people were actually killed by them?’   
  
    
  
A sullen silence hung over us as we dwelled on how many people might have suffered at the many-jointed hands of the Mound People. How many children like us…   
  
    
  
‘I want to kill them.’ Jake said flatly.   
  
    
  
I looked up in surprise.   
  
    
  
‘If you’re wondering what my endgame here is, it’s exactly that. I want to hunt them down and kill them. For the years of trauma they inflicted on us, for taking away my father’s happiness, and to avenge the life of Counsellor Murphy. I understand if you don’t want to join me - this is my choice, and I’d never expect you to up and leave your life to take care of this on my behalf-’   
  
    
  
I muttered some half-hearted apologies, my heart racing as I hummed and hawed at the possible reality of entering those dark trees once more. But as I spoke, my heart raced with a fire it had not felt in many years. I wanted to hurt them. I wanted to dislocate every joint they had in revenge for a childhood ruined.   
  
    
  
I could not stop myself blurting the words ‘Let’s go.’   
  
    
  
I’ve already called in sick to work.   
  
    
  
We leave first thing tomorrow morning.
