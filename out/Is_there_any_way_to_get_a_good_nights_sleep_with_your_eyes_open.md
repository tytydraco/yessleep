My room is always dark so it’s perfect. I can’t see anything until sunrise. Even then I can get blackout curtains. I just can’t sleep with my eyes closed. It’s not an option. I can’t stand seeing the other side. 



I should explain my situation from the top. Maybe someone out there can  relate if it also happens to them. I doubt it, but it’s a chance I’m willing to take. 



It started after a particularly stressful time in my life. I’d been running low on funds and couldn’t find a place to live. My mother was generous enough to let me continue living at home while I worked two jobs to save money. I’m a high school teacher, but I also work at a local restaurant as a bartender on the weekends. I took every shift I could so I could start my life. I didn’t want to be that teacher that still lived with his mother. Didn’t need to give the kids THAT much fuel to throw on my dumpster fire. 



That was until my mother passed away. It was unexpected. She ended up having a heart attack at work. The funeral was nice. I had my aunts and uncles help me with it. A lot of people showed up. My mother was a figurehead in our local community. People loved her. She couldn’t walk 10 feet outside without someone calling her name to ask her how she’s been or what she’s been up to. She welcomed every single one of them with a smile. 



I’m sorry to ramble. It’s just another straw on the camel's back. As awful as it sounds, it was kind of a relief. I was able to sell the house for what it was worth and got a good chunk of change to buy my own house close to the school and the bar. 



I thought that my stress would subside. Unfortunately, the previous stress was replaced with depression; and even more stress. I had just lost my mother, who was my best friend in the whole world, and now I lived alone with no one by my side. 



Dating became hard for me. Especially around this time. I’m not the most physically attractive man in the whole world but I can work my way around a charming one liner, joke, or funny story. I can usually pick up a guy or a gal when I’m working the bar, but those either lead to an uncomfortable one night stand, or one of us ghosting the other within a week. I will say it is mostly my fault. My continuous anxiety and depression rears its ugly head when I end up in situations like this. I don’t have a reason why, it just seems to flare up when someone comes around that I’m fond of. It’s truly a curse.



Again though, not entirely important to what I want to say. Sorry, I really should just go to therapy instead of writing online but here we are. I’m already too far into telling my life story to total strangers to stop now. Even if I did tell a therapist this, they’d lock my ass in a straight jacket…and I’m claustrophobic.



Anyways, I lived at this new place for about 3 years. I’m still stressed and melancholic, but I am surviving and living comfortably. I still get frequent check-ins with my aunts and uncles over the phone. They all live down the coast so I very rarely see them. 

About 4 months ago, I had my first incident with what’s behind my eyelids.



The first night it happened it wasn’t particularly noticeable. I ended up chaperoning homecoming that night and actually had a fun time with some of my coworkers. Encouraging kids to have fun tonight while also telling them to be responsible if they decided to make the poor decision of drinking under age. Although I knew they wouldn’t listen. 



“Yeah Mr. Bryant I’ll be seeing you to grab one at the bar!” one of my awkward underclassmen yelled as he was leaving. 



“Please don’t say that,” I said, sounding overall defeated. 



My coworkers knew that I was a bartender so I didn’t have to vehemently defend myself. Thank goodness. We all laughed and when the night finished, we said our goodbyes and drove off for the weekend. That week had been pretty tough for me. Just a lot of work that needed to be done, not a ton of sleep through the week. I was actually so tired that I ended up driving on the wrong highway for about 20 minutes without realizing my mistake. I was just glad the weekend was here. 



I got home and immediately collapsed onto my bed. Didn’t even get a bottle of water out of the fridge. I climbed into bed, shut off my light, and closed my eyes.



As soon as my eyes shut, it wasn’t the black void I was expecting. It looked like a hallway was just behind my eyelids. At first I thought it was just the residue from the lamplight that was still burned into my retinas, but it lingered for far too long. The hallway was there and it was lit up. I opened my eyes just to double check that my bedside light wasn’t actually on. Maybe I was SO tired that I had just imagined that I had turned it off. The room was dark. Pitch black. I decided that it was probably just a side effect of dealing with annoying ass children all day and all night. I closed my eyes again. The gently illuminated hallway returned. I wanted to try and ignore it but I couldn’t help but look harder. I don’t know how I “looked harder” per se, but it certainly felt like I did. When I did, I saw something at the very end of the hallway. It was faded, almost like it was being censored or blurred. Due to its amorphous shape I couldn’t make it out. My eyes opened and closed all night. The censored object started to become clearer. It just looked like the outline of a person. It was creepy, but it wasn’t malicious. It was just someone in a hallway. I couldn't make out anything about them. It looked like someone giving an anonymous interview. You know when they’re in that specific lighting? They didn’t move, they didn’t speak. It was a staring contest where the timer was the sunrise. 



 I really did try to sleep and prayed that my mind would just shut off and ignore it, but I just laid in bed retaining the feeling of my eyes being closed but not falling asleep. It felt like a 6 hour blink. I got no sleep that night. At least it was the weekend. I did have work late in the afternoon though. I was hoping I could rest a little bit. 



I didn’t take a nap all day. I very rarely take naps. It’s just not how my body works. That’s been true my whole life. So, I went about my day physically exhausted. I didn’t think about the hallway at all. I really had to get myself together though because I had to go to work. 



I arrived at work and was immediately met with sympathy from my boss, Justin. Justin was the owner of the restaurant. He was easily the hardest working man I’ve ever met. He didn’t take shit from anyone, and always had his employees' backs. When I applied for the job, he interviewed me and after I made him a couple of drinks to try, he hired me on the spot. He knew going into the interview that I was a teacher too and he still hired me for weekend shifts. It’s truly a blessing to work for him. Even if it’s only part time. 



Justin could tell that something was wrong immediately. 



“Hey Dex, you doing okay man?”



“Long night last night sir, I chaperoned homecoming and then I didn’t get a second of sleep. I’m just… very tired.” I said with a smile. I started checking the bottles behind the counter to see if we needed any refills from the back.



Justin put his hand on the top of one of the bottles I was checking, pushing it back down onto the shelf. 



“Dexter, you should go home. You don’t look well.”



“Sir, I’m okay. I can work.” I said, trying to continue my work routine.



“Dexter, I just watched you check the same bottle three times now. You’re smoked. I can tell. I can work behind the counter this weekend. Take tonight off. Get some damn sleep. I’ll call ya in the morning to see how you are.” 



I could tell that he wouldn’t budge on this. I wanted to work because I needed the money, but how could I work either job if I got sick from exhaustion? I guess this was the right call.



“Thank you sir. I’m sorry if this is inconvenient.” I said. 



“You’re never an inconvenience Dexter. You’re one of my hardest workers. I need you at this bar bud, I want you rested and healthy. And knock off that ‘sir’ shit.” Justin said with a laugh. 



I laughed and packed up my stuff. I thanked Justin again and drove back home. It was a rough drive, but my windows rolled down, A/C blasted and the cool autumn air was a combination that kept me awake and alert. When I got home, I made dinner-and by dinner I mean I had a bowl of cereal-and then went to bed.



I laid on my side and closed my eyes. Everything seemed fine and back to normal. I saw a welcoming abyss and realized that I actually could get some sleep tonight. As I started to officially drift off, I shifted my body so I was laying on my back. I was met with a faint light and the figure from the previous night standing right in front of me. My eyes opened fast and I sat up in bed. My heart was racing and my breath was short. I didn’t see the figure in full but I saw that there were features on its face. I decided that it was once again exhausted paranoia, and hesitantly closed my eyes again. It was still there. If it didn’t look malicious the night before, it certainly did now. 



The figure itself was encased in a shroud of black. It looked like a shadow came to life; except somehow it was darker than that. The only thing that was different about the figure was its eyes. The eyes on the face of the black figure were piercing. They were the whitest white you’ve ever seen, with pupils that matched its shadowy exterior. I shot awake and got out of bed. It was only 11:42. I walked around my house for a minute to calm down. I got some water and went back to bed. I reluctantly went back to bed and built up courage to close my eyes again. The hallway light was dimmer; almost completely out. The only thing that could be seen at the far end of the hallway were the figures' eyes. Steadily blinking and watching. I watched as it seemingly slowly nodded its head and turned away. Words suddenly appeared on the walls of the corridor. “It has to be you. See you soon”. The hallway light went out with a very quiet flick of an unseen switch. I opened my eyes again. It was midnight. I wrote down what the walls said on a notepad I had on my bedside table and stared at the ceiling for a while. I contemplated going back to sleep. What would be waiting for me on the other side of my eyelids? I decided to just see what would happen and fearfully shut my eyes. I saw nothing. I mean it was an outline of a hallway in the dark, but there wasn’t anything in there. I breathed a sigh of relief and was able to officially fall asleep. 

For the last 4 months, it’s been just that. A dark hallway in my vision while I sleep. It’s eerie but I’ve been able to ignore it all together. I’m writing to you now, people of Reddit looking for advice because the last couple days have been… challenging. The light in the hallway has been flickering occasionally. As of last night they’ve turned on fully. They are bright and foreboding. I don’t want to risk what comes next. If someone can figure out a good way to sleep with your eyes open please let me know. I can’t keep living in fear of closing my eyes.
