My grandfather had built a small fishing cabin in the woods 60 years ago. Although one day he vowed he’d never return to it. That was something along the lines of what I told my son as I tucked him into bed. I went into my bedroom but I couldn’t sleep. I was stressed about my recent divorce, then it struck me. I and my 3 friends Tom, John and Andy could go away to my grandfathers cabin. 

The next morning I called them and we were all excited for a weekend away from the hustle and bustle of the city and were looking forward to relaxing and having a good time.

As soon as we arrived, we all unpacked our bags and settled into the cozy cabin. The sun had set by the time we finished our first meal, so we decided to start a bonfire outside. We sat around the fire, telling ghost stories and laughing, when we suddenly heard a strange noise coming from the woods. We all looked at each other, feeling a bit uneasy, but we dismissed it as an animal and continued our storytelling.

Later that night, I woke up to use the bathroom. As I walked down the hallway, I noticed that Tom’s bedroom doors was slightly ajar. I figured he must have forgotten to close it all the way, so I went to push it shut. However, as I reached for the door handle, I felt a cold breeze and heard what sounded like whispers coming from inside the room. I hesitated for a moment, but then convinced myself it was just my imagination and closed the door.

The next day, we decided to take a hike in the woods. As we were walking, Andy came across an abandoned house that looked like it had been there for years. Curiosity got the best of us, and we decided to check it out. As we walked through the creaky old house, we felt as though we were being watched. 

Suddenly, we heard a loud noise coming from upstairs, and we all froze in fear. We cautiously made our way upstairs and Tom found a room with a strange symbol painted on the wall. We had no idea what it meant, but it made us all feel uneasy.

We carefully backed away from the building, Although we had the sense that whatever was in there had followed us out. That night, we sat around the fire once again, but this time we were all on edge. We couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about the cabin and the surrounding woods. As we sat in silence, we suddenly heard footsteps coming from the woods. We all jumped up, shining our flashlights in the direction of the noise. We saw nothing, but we could feel a cold breeze and hear whispers again.

That's when we decided to call it a night . We put out the fire and got into the cabin as quickly as we could. But then awe heard a blood-curdling scream coming from the woods. We all froze, looking at each other in terror.
It wasn't until late that night. I was lying awake in bed that I realised we were missing one of our friends. I woke Andy and John up and we bought flashlights out into the forrest, searching for our lost friend. We looked everywhere but couldn't find him. Just as we were about to give up, we heard his voice calling for help. We followed the sound and found him in the abandoned house we had explored earlier. He was sitting in front of the symbol we had seen, his eyes completely black and his body cold to the touch. We were all in shock, unsure of what had happened to our friend. As we tried to process what we had just seen, we heard more footsteps coming from upstairs. Without hesitation, we all bolted out of the house, running as fast as we could back to the safety of the cabin.

Once we were back at the cabin, we locked all the doors and windows, trying to come up with a plan. We were all terrified and had no idea what to do next. It wasn't until we found a diary hidden in one of the drawers that we started to piece together what was happening.

According to the diary, my grandfather had built the cabin on sacred ground that was once used for ritual sacrifices. The symbol we saw in the abandoned house was a mark of the cult that used to use the area for their rituals. The cult believed that sacrificing innocent lives would grant them immortality and unlimited power.

As we read further, we discovered that my grandfather had witnessed one of the rituals and was haunted by the cult until the day he died. He had vowed never to return to the cabin, but we had unknowingly stumbled into their territory.

We knew that we had to get out of there before it was too late, but we were surrounded by the cult and had no way out. As we sat in the cabin, we could hear their whispers and footsteps outside, getting closer and closer.
We decided to make a run for it, hoping that we could outrun them and make it to the car. 

We gathered all the supplies we could and made a break for it. As we ran through the woods, we could hear the cult chasing us, their screams and chants echoing through the trees.
We finally made it to the car and drove as fast as we could, leaving the cursed cabin and the cult behind. We never spoke of that weekend again, but we all knew that we had come too close to something evil and that we were lucky to have made it out alive. I don’t know what happened to poor Tom but he hasn’t been heard of since…
