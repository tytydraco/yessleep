My nightmare diary, August 21,2019

I guess you could say I possess a curse. My family on my moms side were all wiccan. I believe it be because of this I am overly sensitive to spiritual energy, particularly in the form of dreams. For as long as I can remember spirit’s, demons…. To be honest im not sure what they are so I will call them entities. Have always been drawn to me like moths to light.

The first entity i will tell you all about is one I call the tar man.

In 2019 I was living in Korea and while I lived there The tar man visited me in a dreams frequently. This was my first encounter with him.

August 21st, 2019

Last night I dreamt I was in a house I did not recognize. I was in a closet with a shutter door, looking out into the bedroom devoid of furniture. A man and a woman were arguing in a language I did not understand. The man looked to be Asian and wearing a business suit without the jacket. The woman who also appeared Asian was wearing a simple white dress almost like a nightgown.

Thats when I felt a hand wrap around my arm.

I looked down and saw a hand that was black as ebony and the flesh appeared tacky. Like road tar.

I looked up to find the source of the hand.

I dont know what I saw because my brain will not let me remember. I remember feeling utter terror and than I woke up.

So I thought.

I lay in my bed, in my room with the peculiar feeling something was sitting in my recliner right across from me. 

I knew by now that they cant hurt me, inly scare me.

So I opened my eyes.

He was sitting with a stiff back and his neck turned to look at me

Again I looked at his face but I can’t remember what it looked like.

Just full blown terror. I jumped out of bed with a panic I hadnt felt since I was 7 years old staring at the hanging man in my closet

I rushed to the door and opened it.

I was back in bed.

This time I recalled what had occurred and I knew he was still there. I look lower…only at his legs.

He was rocking the chair lightly without a care in the world.

I rushed up again this time going for the light switch in front of the door.

I flipped it only to find the lights did not work.

I heard him stand.

I opened the door to find my kitchen area just as dark and I ran for the front door with a full blown panic setting in.

I was back in bed.

This time he stood over me. I look at his face, I again feel the terror of hell as I push past the tar man.

I open the first door, run into the kitchen and try my only way out a second time.

It Opens!

To a void of pitch black darkness.

Darkness so thick no light could ever hop to survive in it.

I hear the tar man walk behind me and stop.

In that moment I had two options. Into the void or into the tar mans grasp.

I turn around to face the tar man.

Untold terror of a thousand tragedies once again fill me eyes.

And I wake up. This time in my real room in my real bed.

I dont know what that thing in korea was, But Ive been training my lucid dreaming capabilities just incase he ever reaches out to me again.

Next time I dont know if I will be ready but I just hope next time never comes. Of all the entities ive met, That one is different. A pure evil that words can not express

If you meet the tar man in your dreams. Dont run. Thats what he wants. To push you into the Void.
