Waking up

I was woken up because the women were coming to where we were sleeping, we had no other choice. It was like we were being attacked and we had to hide or we’d die. It’s equivalent either way. It’s the first day I slept here, it wasn’t a bad experience as me and my friends had set up a room while the adults were sleeping in the big room. There weren’t many of us kids so we were easily able to fit in one room. 2 friends were on the couch, one of them was on a one person couch so it wasn’t comfortable sleeping there and another friend was lucky, he got the 3 person couch and since he was a fat piece of crap there was no way another person would be able to fit there. 

The couches didn’t open either. Me and a friend slept on the floor, we put a blanket on the floor, it was still hard but I’ve slept in worse conditions so this was nothing compared to those conditions. The blanket was big so we were able to fold it and put the blanket on us, although I was burning so I didn’t bother doing that. Lucky him for having the entire blanket. Lucky me for not being burnt alive. At this point, it was 3-4 am. We were doing a lot of stuff when we first came because there was a BBQ the next day and we had to prepare for that. Child labor! Yay. 

Before I went to sleep, I watched some one piece as I had nothing else to do, that was the only thing my service could load. The service wasn’t good there either, I had to touch grass and interact with humans. I put my phone down, although before I put it down I got my charger, plugged the charger into the outlet, plugged my phone into the charger, put on my pajamas, then I actually put my phone down. Foreshadowing moment here, the 22 year old friend who had brought us here barged into our room like we were being sent back to where we came from, we were. 

We were getting raided, there was nothing we could do, this was it. It was just the women who came to help prepare for the bbq while we were also doing that, in a separate area. Anyways, the 22 year old friend who had driven me and my friends here said that he’s going to Walmart and I decided to tag along with him with some other friends. Once we were there, we found Prime. The drink was made by Logan Paul’s and KSI’s hand, not literally but they collabed to create this drink. 

I bought all the flavors that were there, one of each of which the price didn’t come up to over 10 dollars. Wasn’t bad. My friend saw pewdiepie gfuel and suggested that I try it. As a pewdiepie fan I decided to buy it. I couldn’t just let it stay there when I participated in the pewdiepie vs t series war. We head back and the barbeque is ready, we got what we needed and they quickly cut the onions and tomatoes. I decided to drink the gfuel, it was the worst mistake I had made. It was at this moment that I knew I messed up. 

The Curse had been released upon me. It’s paralyzed me, it won’t leave anymore. What have I gotten myself into? I can’t tell others either or they won’t believe me, they’ll just laugh at me for the rest of eternity. Oh my, I can’t deal with this. I’d go insane the second that they start laughing at me for eternity. Darkness had started to engulf me from the inside. Starting from the bottom and ending from the top. Yes, it was too late. This curse would stay with me for the rest of my life. I. Can. Not. Move. I repeated it worse than hell. The curse won’t leave me, I’m stuck. 

 Me moving would be a death wish, something that I would not want. If I stand up, the curse would destroy my organs and I would simply die. I found a method, I slowly stood up and slowly walked to somewhere where I can’t be seen. With each step, I could feel the curse taking over my brain and darkening my vision. It was getting worse each second. I was getting dizzy with each step, I couldn’t see ahead of me properly. Have mercy on me, not here, not before saying goodbye to my family. My end has come. I need to reach my destination, it is the only way I can save myself from this curse. 

Just 5 more steps. First step, I can barely see, I’m using the walls to balance myself. 2, I can only see an atom's worth from my eyes, I’m starting to fall. 3, I’m getting lower and lower with each step, I reached the door of my final destination. 4, I’m sweating profusely, I can’t move fast. 5, I REACHED MY DESTINATION. I sat down, and when I let it all out, it hit the toilet harder than the Japanese hit pearl harbor. I could see light coming from my ass, amazing graphics. It all came in one piece, this is what it feels like to be a man. I could see the poop thank me for finally letting me out, as I’m about to flush, I give it a final slap on its cheeks and kiss it on the forehead. There it goes, I pull it down. Tears roll down our eyes, knowing that it will be the last we see each other. The curse had been lifted upon me, only for me to miss it. Farewell, Friend, Farewell.
