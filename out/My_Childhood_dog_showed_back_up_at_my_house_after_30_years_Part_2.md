My mother thinks it's a miracle. 

She came over this morning and confirmed the dog is either the same Shadow after thirty years, or she's going crazy too. 

She remembered that one of the toes on his left front paw was missing, and we never knew what happened. Sure enough, the same toe is missing on the returned Shadow. 

On that note, mom has never been the least bit spiritual, but I think Shadow turning up is triggering some sort of conversation. 

"It must be a sign. God wants us to have another shot with him," she said. 

"You're religious now?" I asked.

"This is proof of something, isn't it? Your childhood dog, your best friend has returned after thirty years to protect your son. That's incredible!"

For now we're keeping "Shadow" around, although I'm leery as all hell about this. The thing is, my wife loves him too. She was watching TV last night eating popcorn, and had him curled up at her feet, and our son was sleeping quietly. She looked more at peace than I've seen her for a year. 

It's like nobody is listening to reason. 

Those hairs on the back of your neck that stand up from some signal deep in the mammalian brain, that tell you something is very wrong — get out of this situation now — alarm bells are going off, it feels like I'm the only one who has them in this family.

Apparently he showed up at our door while I was at work yesterday and my wife brought him in to get him a snack and some water. She's a dog person, so seeing the majestic animal panting at our doorstep she naturally trusted him and let him in. 

"You brought in a wild animal with our infant son in the house?" I asked, honestly flabbergasted. 

"He's not some wild wolf or something. He's a dog and very obviously a good one at that. I could just tell."

I remembered back to childhood, that gruff voice that came from Shadow detailing each gory moment of the scene that would happen if he chose to rip out my sister's throat, the flesh torn open, the blood drenching the cartoon pillowcase, the splatter on her curtains as he shook her windpipe like a dead rat. I looked at him, and the way he looked at me was as if he knew. 

"Every moment he's in this house I'm going to be afraid of what he'll do." I told her.

"He's a good dog. Your mom says you were inseparable from him when you were a kid. What's changed?" 

"Why is nobody listening to me? He was possessive of me but I was always terrified of him. I don't want him in our house." I said.

"You're being so irrational about this," she said. 

Irrational? I'm sorry, I'm not convinced a dog can be thirty-seven years old. 

My brain's not some cabinet of horrors. I get that I have the reputation in my family as still being some sort of imaginative child even though all that stopped thirty years ago, but it feels to me that these red flags I'm seeing everywhere are pretty obvious. 

Last night while my wife was watching television I saw in the flickering blue light human shadows walking around the living room. How do you explain that? 

And the worst thing is, I pointed them out to her and she just shrugged and went back to absentmindedly petting Shadow and watching her show.

No, honestly the worst thing is that after never being civil to each other for six and a half years my wife and mother are abruptly best friends. My wife even invited my mother to come stay with us for a while. 

My wife and I were in the kitchen after dinner when she brought the idea up. I had been drying a plate and it slip out of my hands and broke on the floor.

"An extra pair of hands around the house won't hurt."

"An extra pair of hands and a drooling maw," I said. The dog looked up at me and I felt like it grabbed my voice. 

I cleaned up the broken plate, downcast. Honestly, the moment she brought it up I knew I'd already lost that argument. I've been burning through overtime at work to pay for childcare, but that's left so much extra housework for my wife that it's really not fair to her for me to argue on this. We need the help. 

So in addition to worrying about this demon dog or whatever Shadow is, I'm having to move everything out of my office to make my mother a guest room, and the emotional dynamic of my marriage has completely shifted overnight. 

Most of the things in my office I don't really use. I carried the files downstairs and had started the laborious project of trying to disassemble my wire shelves when I heard my son babbling in the other room. He was never this talkative.

I came into my son's room as the sun was dipping below the window and bathing the room in golden light. Shadow was there, but this time he was standing on his hind legs, almost as if he was human. His hair puffed up and he looked powerful, regal, wise. He stood there gazing at my son. When he turned to look at me his eyes burned into mine with an intense stare, the reached into me and grabbed hold of something they found inside me. I couldn't move. An unbelievable feeling of calm washed over me and I left the room. 

As soon as I closed the door my rational mind took back over and I was immediately terrified that something was happening to my son. I yanked the door back open dreading the worst — what if the beast had carried him off, had taken him to some dark hole we would never find to eat his tender body — what if he'd come back again from some rotten hell to take everything from me and there was nothing I could do to stop him. But when the door flew open Shadow was sitting there as a regular dog, wagging his tail while my son said nonsense syllables to him.

I picked up my son and slowly walked downstairs, dazed.

What the hell is happening?
