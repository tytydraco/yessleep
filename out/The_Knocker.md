I was 17 when this story took place. I live in the far northeastern part of the Denver area, around where Frederick and Brighton is. My town was a small little farming community, only with about a thousand people living there. We all knew each other, and looked after one another. One night, my parents had left the house because of work out of town. They told me to watch the weather, as strong thunderstorms could move into the area. I was left a $20 bill, before they left, their truck's engine growling and the tires grinding and churning the gravel road outside my house. At least with me, I was used to my parents leaving for work, so I was always kind of prepared and ready for it whenever. Since they told me to watch the weather, I decided to lay on the living room couch, with some of my comfy, soft pillows, blankets and a stuffed bear. I shut the lights off in my house, and turned the night lights on.  
 I turned the TV on and tuned it to the news, just to check if anything had popped up for the storm. The news people were talking about something else, and after a few minutes the subject changed to the thunderstorm. They showed the radar of the area, and a very large, nasty storm was coming right in the direction of my house. There were reports of large hail, high winds, and the slim chance for tornadoes. I quickly changed the channel to Nickelodeon, and watched some late night cartoons. I hugged my stuffed bear, warm and cozy under my blankets, against my soft pillow, and slowly drifted off to sleep. I was soon awakened to the ear piercing shrill of the emergency alert system on the TV. I shot up, and looked at the screen. The voice, the unsettling, monotone voice came on.   
“ The National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for south west Weld county. Radar and spotters have recorded heavy rain, wind gusts of up to 60 miles per hour, low visibility, golf ball sized hail, and a chance for tornadoes. Take shelter inside immediately.”. Now obviously, I was very alarmed by that warning. I've always hated those warnings, the sound of them is so awful and scary. The rain began to pick up outside, I switched the channel back to the news again. The storm looked even worse, and my area was highlighted in an orange box. I was right on the edge of the storm, I was going to be hit in one of the worst spots. A few seconds after the highlighted box appeared, the TV,  and all the lights flickered off. I was in the dark, only illuminated by the flicker of lightning from the storm.   
I huddled myself deep into my blankets and pillow, wishing and begging for the lights to turn back on. Then, from the shuttered kitchen window, I heard a single, loud and sharp Knock. A few seconds later, another knock was heard from the ceiling, that one did not sound as sharp, and sounded more like hail. Then another knock was heard, then another, the hail had arrived. The roof of my house, and the walls were being pounded with the monstrous hail. I could hear the hail balls shatter upon impact. I figured it would be a good idea to snap a picture of the storm and send it to my parents. I went to the windows in the living room, with my phone's camera on. The hail was still coming down hard, I was a little scared of the windows breaking. I peel back the curtains, and to my horror, I see an uncanny face looking back at me. Its skin was grayish, and had bloodied blunt force marks on its head and shoulders, like it was being hit with hail. It was very boney, and looked very malnourished. Its face was very long, its mouth a gape, taking up at least half of the length of its face.  Its limbs were very unproportionate, its arms went down past its knees, almost like a monkey. Its arms were spread out on the window, with two blood splats on the glass. I realize that the hail isn't actually hail, it's this thing banging on the window.   
The banging stopped, and the thing let out a growly moan, a very disturbing, almost human-like moan. A few seconds later, a bunch of other moans were heard around my house, on the roof, at other windows, on the front door. My whole house was surrounded by these things. During this moment, i had just one thing in mind; “get the fuck out”. I ran to the other side of the house, with my phone's flashlight on. I could hear knocking everywhere, except for my parents room. I run inside, and check the windows to make sure there’s really nothing there. I could see in the distance, maybe about 50 or 60 feet away, there were a couple of them slowly limping over. I quickly opened the window, kicked the screen off, and started bolting to the gravel side road by my house.   
The sky was very strange looking, with dark, black storm clouds over me, and the sunset faintly glowing the edge of the storm. It looked like I was in totality during a solar eclipse. Hail was smashing and shattering on the road, some stones being inches away from me. I looked back at my house, to see all of the things slowly walking towards me, groaning and growling. There was a gas station by my house, just a block or so away, I could see the bright, tall sign for the gas station. At that moment, I could hear in the distance, a tornado siren sounding. I frantically looked around to try and find a funnel cloud, and to my surprise, behind a couple trees to my left, was a prominent, eerie rope tornado. The twister was bending and changing shape. at the point where it touched the ground, was a small ball of dust, and debris the tiny tornado spun up. I sped even faster to the gas station, panting and hyperventilating.  
 A minute or two later I get to the station, run inside, and tell the clerk to call the police. The clerk has me stay in the backroom until the police showed up. A couple squad cars pulled up a few minutes later, they asked me what happened inside the store. A few days later, they stated that my case was thrown out, because I was probably lying about it, but I know what I saw, I know I wasn't hallucinating or anything like that. A few other people in rural Colorado have said that they’ve encountered the same thing, they've nicknamed them "Knockers". Ever since that night, I've never stayed home alone again, and have been struggling with PTSD and anxiety. I wish that I just had gone with my parents that night.
