I’m just slightly suspicious now.

Growing up we were best friends, and we played a game where I was the Queen and she was… well just my sister. That’s when it started. She adored me as her majesty, but I seriously think she hated me.

In the game all my friends died because of my arch nemesis, he killed them all off. Then my sister chose, with her own agency, to be possessed by him. She told me she was now evil and she subsequently died, because of course as the sovereign I could not allow her to survive. Then the game ended. We grew up and moved on.

Throughout junior high and high school I became political and she turned into a science nerd. I became popular and she did not, so I went to parties with the cool kids while she stayed home. We had different lives, but mine took a tragic turn. Alcoholism found me and soon I was being arrested and slutting myself out.

Eventually we reunited in university but she was above me because I entered late. She was sort of a guide to me, showing me around and meeting up with me for coffee and such. It was a very cordial couple of years, but still I fucked dudes like on the regular. I wasted those days, just sucking cock and failing basic courses. I eventually was kicked out of university.

I went to Toronto to study “acting” and came back to become a film and television actor. I was a child actor, by the way, another reason I think sis was jealous. Mom loved me so much for the money I made us. But anyway, I got bored of just acting and became a producer.

Sis had already graduated university and became a scientist. She wanted to be a doctor, she said, but didn’t achieve the grades to enter into her doctorate program. Instead she took a job collecting soil samples and looking at them through a microscope.

I ended up working for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I was recently fired because I was charged with a serious crime. She ended up buying a house in the suburbs, just like we planned when we were kids. Mom moved into the basement. That’s when the drama began.

I went to visit mom last summer for her birthday and spent a week at my sister’s new house. We went camping, and golfing, then one night we sang karaoke and got drunk and due to a petty argument over whose turn it was my sister got mad at me. Once everyone left she proceeded to get violently loud, and threw wine glasses at me and my mom and accused me of being the favourite.

She kicked me out and I had to go and stay at my cousin’s house for the night before she sobered up and welcomed me back. I spent the next few days on edge there before my scheduled flight back. Then I went home to beautiful British Columbia.

Ever since then I’ve been suspicious that my little sister has been abusing my mother. Mom always says she gets these phantom black eyes or bruises. Last night she apparently fell down the stairs to her basement suite and broke her collar bone, a few ribs, and her wrist.

My beloved sister texted me just now and informed me of all of this, and said our mom was in the hospital but she had to go home to her mansion and look after some stupid dog. I called mom, and thankfully she answered, but she was unequivocal about her response. She’d been drinking and went downstairs and “missed a step” and fell all the fuck the way down the winding staircase and broke her collar bone, several ribs, and her right wrist.

She told me she blacked out the whole fucking night and came to in the morning. She dragged herself to her phone because nobody could hear her cries for help. She’s 66 years old. She called 9-1-1 and she presents to the hospital room, where after an entire day my sister decides to tell me what’s up.

She needs surgery. My aunt recently had a stroke and is in a different hospital in the same city. All of this started when my sister got her house. When I was in charge and present, life was rough but at least people were alive! 

I think my sister harbours the Devil. I think she’s abusing my mom as an act of revenge for mom loving me more. Mom provided for me, she drove me to acting lessons and auditions. I became a celebrity and my sister lived in my shadow. Now she’s become Satan and has imprisoned my precious mother to commit violence against her.

What the fuck am I supposed to do, Reddit?
