I always wanted to photograph the Scottish Highlands. The way the mist curls over the mountains, the way the heather turns the hills into a sea of purple—it’s like something from another world. I never expected to find out just how true that was.  

It was late September when I made the trip. I’d planned for a full week of hiking and photography, working my way north. I had a tent, plenty of food, and my camera gear. I wanted solitude. Instead, I found something ancient. Something terrible.  

The first few days were uneventful. I set up camp near a loch one night, and the wind howled through the valley, but nothing unusual happened. On the fourth day, I decided to explore a particularly remote glen I’d spotted on the map. It had no roads leading to it, just a winding deer trail. Exactly what I was looking for.  

I don’t know when I first felt it—like I was being watched. I brushed it off as paranoia. You’re alone in the wilderness, of course you feel watched. But as I climbed higher into the hills, the feeling didn’t go away.  

And then I saw them.  

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. Just movement in the heather. But then I saw figures—half-naked, covered in blue woad, their bodies wiry and hardened by a life spent fighting the land. They stood on the ridge above me, watching.  

I called out—stupidly, I realize now. No answer. Just silence, except for the wind. My stomach clenched. Every instinct told me to turn back, but I didn’t. I had my camera, after all. I raised it, focused the lens—  

Pain.  

Something struck my head. The world spun. I hit the ground, my vision filled with sky, then dark shapes closing in. I tried to scream, but rough hands clamped over my mouth. The last thing I saw before blacking out was a face above me, streaked with blue, eyes like ice.  

I woke up in a stone hut, bound at the wrists and ankles with rope made of twisted sinew. My head throbbed, and my camera was gone. The air was thick with the smell of woodsmoke and something… raw. Meat, maybe.  

I wasn’t alone.  

A man crouched by the fire, watching me. His face was streaked with blue spirals, his long hair matted with dirt. He wore a cloak of animal hides, but his chest was bare, crisscrossed with scars.  

"You are in our land," he said, his voice thick with an accent I couldn't place.  

I tried to speak, to tell him I was just a traveler, that I meant no harm. But my mouth was dry, my throat raw. He didn’t care.  

Over the next few days, I learned what real fear was.  

They weren’t ghosts. They weren’t some reenactment group gone too far. These people were **real**. Flesh and blood. They spoke a guttural form of Pictish, a language long thought extinct. And they were ruthless.  

They **hunted**.  

I saw them drag in deer, their throats slit with flint knives. But I also saw human remains among the bones scattered near the fire pits. The gnawed femurs. The skulls, cracked open.  

I understood, then. I wasn’t a prisoner.  

I was food.  

I don’t know how long I was there. Maybe a week. Maybe longer. Time blurred together between beatings, interrogations in a language I couldn’t understand, and the constant, gnawing hunger. They barely fed me, keeping me weak. But I watched. I waited.  

One night, they drank themselves into a stupor around the fire. It must have been some kind of ritual—I could hear their chants, see the way they smeared blood onto their faces.  

I didn’t wait.  

I worked the rope against the sharp edge of a stone for **hours**. My wrists bled, but I didn’t stop. When the rope finally snapped, I nearly sobbed.  

I crept out of the hut, heart hammering. The fire was low, casting flickering shadows. The Picts lay sprawled around it, drunk or asleep.  

I ran.  

I don’t know how long I ran. I just know that when I finally saw the first hints of modern civilization—a road, a car, **a sign written in English**—I collapsed.  

A local found me. Called the police. They didn’t believe me, of course. Who would? A lost traveler, delusional from exposure? That’s the story they settled on.  

But I know what I saw.  

I know what’s still out there.  


I made it home. Tried to go back to normal. But there’s something wrong.  

At night, I hear whispering outside my window. Low, guttural words in a language I don’t understand.  

I see figures standing at the edge of the woods behind my house.  

And this morning, I found something on my doorstep.  

A stone knife, its edge still stained red.  

They let me go.  

But I don’t think they meant to.


I didn’t think. I just grabbed my keys and ran.  

The moment I saw that knife, I knew—I knew they weren’t done with me. My hands shook as I turned the ignition, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The car’s headlights carved through the darkness, illuminating the quiet suburban street. Nothing moved. No figures. No blue-painted faces.  

But I could feel them.  

The engine roared as I sped down the empty roads, my mind racing. Where could I go? Home wasn’t safe. Nowhere was safe. But then I remembered my hotel. The one I’d stayed in before the trip. **Walls. Locks. People.**  

The roads twisted beneath my tires as I tore through the Highlands, my headlights barely piercing the inky blackness of the wilderness. Every shadow on the roadside looked like **them**. Every flicker in my peripheral vision made my heart slam against my ribs.  

And then I saw them.  

In the rearview mirror.  

Silhouettes standing at the edge of the road. A dozen, maybe more. Just standing. Watching. I slammed the gas, my pulse hammering. The further I drove, the more I saw them—standing motionless on the hills, half-hidden in the heather, their eyes glowing in the moonlight like animals.  

They were **everywhere**.  
  

By the time I reached the hotel, my hands were numb from gripping the wheel. I practically fell out of the car, stumbling to the entrance. The night receptionist—some poor guy in his twenties—looked up from his phone, startled.  

"Sir? Are you okay?"  

I could barely get the words out. "I need a room. Now."  

He hesitated, probably taking in my wild-eyed, sweat-drenched state. But when I slammed my credit card on the desk, he nodded and handed me a key.  

"Third floor, end of the hall."  

I didn’t even bother thanking him. I sprinted to the elevator, jabbing the button over and over like a madman. The ride up was agonizingly slow, the fluorescent lights flickering overhead. When the doors finally slid open, I practically **threw** myself down the hall and into my room.  

Locked the door. Bolted it. Pulled the curtains shut.  

Only then did I collapse against the bed, my chest heaving.  

Safe.  

For now.  


I don’t know how long I sat there, staring at the walls, waiting for my pulse to slow.  

Then, just as my breathing steadied—  

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**  

Soft. Deliberate.  

Right outside my door.  

I froze. Every hair on my body stood on end.  

Another knock. **Harder.**  

I reached for my phone, my fingers fumbling. I pulled up the hotel’s front desk number and dialed. The receptionist picked up on the first ring.  

"This is the front desk. How can I help you?"  

"There’s—" I swallowed, my voice barely a whisper. "There’s someone outside my room."  

A pause. Then: "Sir, are you sure? We don’t have any guests on your floor."  

The blood drained from my face.  

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**  

My heart pounded so hard it hurt.  

And then—silence.  

I stayed frozen for what felt like hours, the phone still clutched in my hand. Eventually, when I couldn’t take it anymore, I crept toward the peephole.  

And I looked.  

Nothing.  

Just the empty hallway.  

But as I pulled away, something caught my eye.  

A **smudge** on the door.  

Blue.  

Woad.  

I didn’t sleep that night. I kept the lights on, a chair wedged against the door. Morning came, but it brought no comfort. The Picts—**they’re real**. They survived. Hidden in the wild places, in the cracks of the world where no one looks.  

And they don’t like being seen.  

I don’t know why they let me go. Maybe they wanted me to tell this story. Maybe they just like to **hunt.**  

Either way, I know one thing.  

This isn’t over.  

And if you ever find yourself alone in the Highlands, with the mist curling around the hills and the wind whispering through the heather—  

Run!
