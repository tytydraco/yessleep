I was motivated to write about my own experience with the 11 miles game after seeing "[lilyrebeccacash](https://www.reddit.com/user/lilyrebeccacash/)" story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ekkw88/i_think_my_friend_played_the_11_miles_game_and_i/) to spread awareness about this game, the horrors and the consequences of it.  
\--------------------------------------------------------------

"Emma, please leave me alone once and for all"

My phone read. I stared in shock. In fear.  
I thought everything was going well. Our friendship was going thru a really bad phase for the past two months. Both of us not talking to each other. But we went out to talk last time and I thought everything was going well, we were gonna plan our next hangout to talk more, and i was just trying to find out when we would do so.

"Mia, I'm sorry. i was just trying to find out our next meetup"  
Was the only thing i could write. Emma was my bsf. my bff. I trusted her with all my heart. We had convos we didn't have with anyone else. We shared clothes. We had what i never had with any other friend. All my friends had treated me horribly before, she seemed like the best one i ever had. In fear of losing her, my hands started to tremble.

"No, shut up, just shut up. Even if you force me to be your friend, even if you don't, you're not the type of person i wanna be friends with, now for the last time goodbye, after our meetup i realized we can't work out Emma."

I started crying, horribly crying for the next 5 mins, and then i just stopped. Probably from shock.  
I tried messaging Char, my friend. i told them Mia dropped me. all she said to me was "Oh, im sorry". I realized charlotte didnt care. I just left her on seen.

A couple of days pass, still destroyed from the inside when all of a sudden i get followed on instagram by the user "@11.miles". Upon clicking the notification, it took me to a page that wouldn't load, insta just said "Couldn't load this profile". all i could do was follow them back from the notification. Thankfully that worked.

"We can grant you what you wish for" Popped up on my phone, almost as soon as i followed the page back.

"Who is this?" Was the only thing i could ask. I was very confused.

Then, my whole screen went black, all there was now was an incoming audio call from the user, and as much as i regret it now, I answered.

"Play by my rules, and you shall be granted a wish, a wish that you desire, a wish you would risk your life for! a wish you would do anything for! you can replay my game after if you have more than one wish, but i won't be making it easy!" Said a man, he sounded like he was in his mid 30s.

"is this a joke?" I said. He spoke so weirdly. I couldn't believe he was serious.

"Oh, I'm as real as one could be. I'm giving you this opportunity because, well, I know you. I know everyone. I know what happened with your bsf." He said.

"How do you..." Was all i could mutter before he interrupted me.

"Let's not waste any time by asking stupid questions. You can play my game and in return you can wish for anything. you can wish for your bsf, or you can wish for anything else, material or not." He said.

I was so blinded by trying to get my bsf back, I was so blinded by not wanting to be left all alone. I inevitably said yes.

"Perfect. I'll send you a link shortly. Read it, I will know when you've finished." He said as i could hear him grinning. He then hung up. My screen blinked back to our chats. The link was already there.

I still wasn't sure if this was real or not, and if it was, I wasn't sure if this is what i wanted to do. But reading it wouldn't hurt, right?  
As i clicked on the link, my screen flashed me as it turned white, the website loaded super slowly, as if it was build in the 90s. It looked like it too, it was poorly designed. But its contents were clear, i began to read.

\-------------------------11-Miles-------------------------  
Must be done with a vehicle. A car is recommended, you can technically use a motorcycle, but beware, **YOU WILL DIE.**  
Drive to a forest where nobody frequently uses the road. **This is required.** Go alone. Make sure you have a full gas tank. 
You are not allowed to use your phone (Not that you will have service coverage anyway), you are not allowed to turn your radio on, you must not exceed 30 mph (48km/h), you are not allowed to tell anyone about this game. once you enter, there's no going back. Turn back and you will be met with an endless road till your fuel runs out, where you will be left stranded, and inevitably die. if so, pray it's the cold that kills you.

**Mile One:** The temperature drops. Turn your heater on, you will want the warmth later, the sky above clears no matter how cloudy it was. you may take a moment to admire the stars, It's the last beauty you'll see for a while. It's as if the road starts watching you.

**Mile Two:** The cold deepens. We warned you about the motorcycle, didn't we? If by now, your windows aren't up, you're foolishly inviting death, not just from the cold. The road shifts. Bumps. Potholes. Cracks than weren't there before. Stay focused and dodge what you can. You wouldn't wanna total your car so early on, would you?

**Mile Three:** They'll start to appear. **Don't look.** Your curiosity will pull at you, but dont worry, they'll make themselves known later.

**Mile Four:** They begin to make themselves known. They will talk to you. **YOU MUST RESIST!** Listening to them will only draws them closer. Think of your wish. Focus. Remember how badly you want it. What you'd do for it. What you're doing for it.

**Mile Five:** The trees fade into darkness, soon a beautiful lake emerges, moonlight lighting it up. It will be beautiful. **Do not look.** The lake wants to take you down. Resist it. the game will take it easy on you, they will let you get a break, but don't worry, they haven't stopped watching you.

**Mile Six:** The lake fades, the trees return. The stars vanish. Most lose hope here, but be encouraged by the fact that you're more than halfway there. Your headlights will flicker, Ignore it, Your radio has turned on by itself. **They know who you are.** they know your deepest fears. **They will use them against you.** Resist. they know when you're paying attention. You will only make them more interested in you. Speed up if you wish. You won't be able to switch your radio off anyway

**Mile Seven:** Their voices have now returned. They aren't just whispering at you anymore, they will scream at you. By now they will have figured out a way into your car, don't be surprised if you hear them in your ears. ignore it, don't turn around, your curiosity will kill you, you wont comprehend their form, and you don't want to. They know what you love. What you hate.

**Mile Eight**: Slow down. the road will have sharp turns, **DO NOT STOP**. they will surround your car, they will trap you. you can slow down, but under no circumstances ever come to a full stop. **do not test them.**

**Mile Nine:** Keep your guard up. your vehicle will stall. as soon as this happens, close your eyes immediately. reach your keys, and keep trying to start your car. **KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED.** they will surround you. You wont comprehend their form. Ss soon as your car starts, they will be frightened. they will disappear. you have 3-5s to move, so **HIT YOUR GAS PEDAL!!!**

**Mile Ten:** the voices will leave you alone, the road becomes clear of obstacles. but don't look to your sides, they're there. watching. you'd think they would be happy for you. but they're just excitedly watching you get closer and closer to **Mile Eleven.**

**Mile Eleven**: Keep your guard up again! your vehicle will lose power but will continue to move, as if an unnatural force is keeping your vehicle in move. you will start to approach a blindingly bright red light, keep your eyes closed, cover them, and cover your ears too, because you're about to go thru what's said to be **hell itself,** the coldness turns into heat, you will feel your skin *melting away*, you will hear deafening screams. you will be tormented, but **pull thru!**

Power will return to your vehicle. you may now open your eyes and start moving, as you hear the deafening sounds fade away. drive for another mile, where you'll be met with a dead end. you may now close your eyes, and imagine your wish coming true. even if it changed during your journey, imagine it. if your wish was material, check your car's trunk or pockets. if not, be patient.

You will be back to where you came from, at your will, drive away or begin driving again.

**Good luck.**

I stared at my phone in utter disbelief. How could any of this be real?  
My thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a message from @11.miles

"So, will you play?"I stared at his message some time, until i finally responded.

"I will play" I said. Still in utter disbelief.

"Perfect! :) " He said, immediately sending another message.

"My name is max. I figured u should get to know me by my name now" He said as the nickname "Max" appeared above his profile tag.

"I will let you break one rule, and one rule only. Choose wisely" He said. I was stunned. I couldn't believe he was letting me choose, I thought about it for a good second, them sent:

"I want to be able to use my phone" I said. Maybe to keep track of time, maybe to use it for maps, to text someone

"Very well" he said "But call or text for help, and i'll make sure you won't make it out alive."

I sighed but what choice did i have? There was no backing out now. 

"Good :) in 2 days at 3:00 AM, drive to a forested area as the rules say. I'll know when you've done so. Bye bye for now :)"

I closed my phone. My hands trembling slightly. It all felt like a terrible dream. I couldn't even process what had just happened. I decided to take a nap. My mind was racing, but sleep seemed like the only escape.

I woke up, it was the next day, my nap turned into a full on sleep. I was in disbelief. I really slept for that long? I got up, and debated whether or not i should keep this quiet. I decided to tell char, i mean, i'm sure Max was lying about keeping close track of me and knowing me, right?

So i decided to tell char about the whole Max thing, and about the game, I never told her what i'd wish for though. and surprisingly, she decided she would come with me. I was ecstatic. I atleast wouldn't be alone right?... Till i felt my phone buzz in my hand again. It was Max

**Max:** do you think i'm stupid?  
**Me:** what?  
**Max:** did you really think you could get away with that?  
**Me:** What are you talking about...?  
**Max:** you broke a rule Emma, You told Charlotte  
My blood ran cold, I was staring at my phone. "How?" I muttered under my breath.  
**Max:** So now, I get to add one :)

  
There was a pause, like he was letting that sink in...

**Max:** New rule! Char comes with you, but **only one of you makes it back.**  
  
My eyes widened. I was in shock. Did i just drag charlotte down with me? Who would be the one making it out? i had so many questions running thru my mind, but they were interrupted by another message from Max.

**Max:** And if you tell her? If she finds out what's coming?  
**Max:** I'll make sure you both suffer.  
**Max:** Her death will be the least painful part. Yours? Won't be so quick.  
  
My fingers went numb. I stared at the screen. refusing to believe what i was reading  
  
**Max:** Pretend this convo never happened. Pretend everything is fine  
**Max:** You Don't want to find out the consequences of breaking a third rule, Emma.  
**Max:** :)
