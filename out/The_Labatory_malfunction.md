"Hey, you double checked the door to make sure it's locked right?" My friend, J.J said. "Of course, one slip up might get me f-f-ired!" We laughed so much that our supervisor had to come in to check on us.

 "The hell are you laughing for?" Our supervisor said, really annoyed with all the noise from inside the room, "Ugh, whatever, follow me." He said, really loudly, we both got our cool and followed him, he unlocked the door to a section we have never been in, it went deeper then 6 Feet, it was like 11, 12? "I hate this room; it requires the most amount of requirements than any other room in the facility." He said, handing us over truly the most amount of radioactive-resistant material then I have ever seen.

We put it on, and went into the room, "Now, we head towards the portal to make sure it's unplugged and shut down, Carlee, you go shut it down, I'll unplug it, and Jae, just go ahead and make sure the map is shut down." He said, we went to our spots, "Now, seniors, we must remember **that we all** have to do our part all at the same time, got it?" He said, "Now, 3-2---" 

The power completely cut out, meaning we had to shut it down much more manually, according to the supervisor, "Stay here, our power doesn't cut off for no reason, someone cut it off, go into the armory, and lock the doors, remember, I have a keycard, so if anyone bangs on the door, **DO NOT**, and I mean **DO NOT**, answer it." He said, very seriously.

It was really scary to just sit in there, we waited a good 30 minutes till the system said, "LOCKDOWN IMENT, BLAST DOORS CLOSING IN 10." Sure, it could have been the stupidest prank on earth, but, 40 minutes later, he DEFINETALLY would have said something. 

"Guys, open up, please! **I lost my keycard and I can't get in, PLEASE, open the keycard blast door, and open this door, HELP, GUYS!"** The supposed supervisor said, I knew that wasn't our supervisor's voice; I knew it, he was serious, he wouldn't have lost his keycard that easily.

"OPEN, THE DOOR." He said, screaming. "I SWEAR..." He breathed in really tightly, "I WILL KILL YOU, OPEN THIS DOOR." He said, he sounded serious, whatever it was, anyway, "..." He didn't say anything about us not opening the door, that's when we heard scratching and banging on the door, "YOU IDIOTS, OPEN, THE, DOOR!" He screamed, it honestly was so loud I thought it would travel across the globe. "YOU IDIOTS! I ALREADY KILLED YOUR SUPERVISOR!" He said.

We stayed quiet, seeing if it would all blow over, maybe he would leave? "OPEN THE DOOR, I ALREADY KILLED SOMEONE." He said, REALLY loudly this time, "UGH, FINE, I'LL GO GET THE SUPERVISORS KEYCARD!" Thats it! The perfect chance to run away! Thats when we realized; we only had a class one keycard, it could only open the entrance, and the lab. So that's it, we thought, what's he going to do? Kill us? "Psst, you know this is the armory, right?"

That's it! We need a gun to kill him!

He slid the keycard to open the door, guns ready in hand, we shot at him. 

"YES!" We said, as we hugged each other, "Man, it was tough, wasn't it?"

... "J.J?" I turned around, and saw him in disbelief, almost everything important was gone, the portal, and the body, "H-how did t-this happen?" We both said.
