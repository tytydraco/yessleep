I woke up in cold sweat, the first thing I saw was my ceiling,I gasped for air, And I looked around the room, my room was lighted up by the fool moon,I sat up on my bed and I stared at my room for a minute, the only thing I could hear was silence. 

I tossed my blanket on the corner of my bed and I planted my feet on my cold floor, I went towards the window and I grasped the handle and pulled, a cold wind hit my body, alleviating me from the roasting feeling that had developed because of the blanket. 

I stood there for a minute, enjoying the cold freezing air, when suddenly I felt a stabbing feeling across my gut,I felt unease and anxiety,I stared at the dark forest outside, for 15 seconds I stared at thick forest, then I closed the window. 

I felt worry wash over me like waterfall, I locked the window and I turned on the lights,then I grabbed my bedroom door and pushed the door open,I was hit again with a sharp feeling in my gut,I felt like I was supposed to do something,then I went into the hallway,I turned on the lights there too and i went forward until I was on the start of the staircase,i watched the dark staircase for about 5 seconds,i could clearly see the end of the staircase and the hallway and the front door,but just in case i spoke a bit loudly "who goes there?".

I recieved no reply,no-one was in my home.

I went down the staircase and I quickly flicked the switch for lights, then I turned to my right and I went to my dark kitchen,I flicked the switch for light and went towards the fridge,as my hand gripped the handle I looked towards the clock which read 2:57 am.

I got alarmed a little but I remembered that today was Saturday, a wave of relief washed over me because I didn't have to do any work. 

I opened the fridge and quickly made a sandwich so I could eat, as I was making the sandwich I looked through the kitchen window and stared at the forest, then I resumed making the sandwich. 

After I had made the sandwich,I decided I would quickly eat my food in the kitchen, while I was eating my sandwich I felt as if I needed to do something,and I stopped eating to check if i could hear anything,like footsteps.

I heard nothing so I kept on eating my sandwich,I thought about work and what I needed to do, I work at a gas station and thankfully I did not have to work on weekends,my friend Joe worked the weekends, I met him on my first day at the gas station,he is a nice guy. 

I ate my sandwich and wiped my hands, then I leaned on the counter with my hands behind my back on the counter,I still had a feeling like I needed to do something so I went around the house, looking around.

I didn't see anything suspicious but I remember I had a backdoor, so I went and checked the backdoor and the door was locked, a smile cracked across my face and I was feeling safe,then I quickly went to my front door and checked my front door,the front door was locked too.

But something was causing me an itch, a feeling of danger was present, then I remembered something. 

Was my key for the backdoor in the backdoor? 

I quietly sprinted towards the backdoor and checked, there was no backdoor key in the backdoor.

This is unusual, so I went around the house searching for the key,I passed by one door and In the corner of my eyes I thought I saw something unusual, so I faced one door and saw that the door was slightly open, I looked at the ground and saw a small pool of blood and one hand sticking out of the door. 

My heartbeat became rapid, and I started to shake,my jaw was clenched and my eyes were wide, I thought on what to do, then I crouched and quietly walked towards a window, I unlocked the window and jumped out,I got up and shut the window as quietly as I could, I then started quickly to run across the streets.

I passed by many houses, then I was infront of the police station,I was breathing heavily and sweat poured down my head, I quickly galloped across the staircase and burst through the police station, I yelled out "please! Somebody helped me! Someone was murdered in my home!" 

A police officer with blonde hair and a handlebar moustache approached me and asked me "what is wrong?" He had a worried look on his face, I told him "I was in my home when I saw a door was slightly open, then I looked down and saw a hand sticking out the door and a pool of blood" 

Another officer with brown hair appeared and the policeman that listened to my story spoke to him "go with 2 police officers to-" his head turned towards me and I told him my address. 

The other officer then called over two policemen and they ran out of the police station while I was taken to a room for questioning.

"Did you kill him?" The policeman spoke with an accusative tone of voice 

"I didn't kill him!" I told him,I had to be careful with my answers just so that they do not throw me in prison 

then I remembered something, on Thursday I couldn't sleep the entire day, and on Friday I went to my job tired, when I came back to my house I remembered my hand gripping the handle and opening the door, then after I went inside the house I locked the door. 

I told the policeman the information and he just looked at me analytically. 

For 30  minutes he didn't speak, then suddenly he said. 

"Did you open the door-"

A policeman barged through the door, I recognised him as the brown haired guy that was sent to check out my house. 

"Sir,I bring a report from the field" 

The handlebar moustache cop turned around and said "what happened?" 

The brown haired cop replied to him "me and two cops were driving to the house with a dead man, then as we were pulling in the drive way,we heard screaming from the neighboring house and a cry for help, we jumped out of our car and burst through the door, as we were going deeper inside of the house we saw a man with a knife jump through the backdoor and into the fields, I told my colleagues to chase him then I quickly ran upstairs to check to see who was calling for help, I heard a cry for help again to my right, then I opened the door and saw a woman stabbed in the gut, she had a first aid kit in her bedroom and I managed to bandage her,she told me her name was colette, then I called the ambulance, after the ambulance arrived my colleagues came back and told me they couldn't find the man" 

 the blonde policeman got up from his chair and kept on looking at the brown haired man, the brown haired policeman kept on speaking "after the woman was taken to the hospital we checked the house where the dead body was reported, we broke the door and searched the house, we found the room with a arm hanging out, as I opened the door the body was struck by the door,I flicked the light switch on and looked through the door I saw 4 more dead bodies,I called the ambulance to pick up the dead bodies, after that we went on a patrol around the houses, we went past collette's house and saw that 4 houses had their back windows broken, we checked those houses too and found blood on the walls and floors, you should go to the police station to interview collete and to speak with the coroner in regards to the dead bodies" 

The blonde haired man then ordered "send out 5 police officer for a manhunt, go and check out the houses again to see if the killer is still around, I will go to the hospital to visit collete" 

He then turned towards me and handed me 800 dollars,I turned towards him and said "why are you giving me 800 dollars?" 

He replied to me "I gave you 800 dollars so that you could repair your door" 

I silently took the 800 dollars and got up from the chair, he then said to Me "go ride in officer mckenny's car and buy yourself door when you can" 

I silently followed officer mckenny and after the drive we went to my house, mckenny and his colleagues searched the entire house and found no-one, officer mckenny then told me "we will search the other houses, you be safe"

Then they went towards the other houses while I watched them from my front porch,I noticed that they checked the houses that are oriented on my left side,my house is 7th in the row.

After they checked all the houses they sat on my front porch, i searched the house for my backdoor key but i couldn't find the key for my backdoor, so i went to buy two doors and two keys, as I was walking on the front street I could see flashlights coming from the forest. 

the morning sun was rising while I was going home with 2 doors,when I was infront of my house I saw 3 men in cleaning suits come out of my house, one of them said to me "you don't have to worry about paying the cleaning, officer McCartney paid for the cleaning" 

As the cleaners entered their van officer mckenny with his colleagues also went towards his car and went towards the police station,I then replaced my front door and backdoor,and I made sure that both doors were locked. 

After an hour i looked out through my window and i saw the blonde haired officer that spoke to me in the police station get out of his car, he rang my doorbell and I opened the door, he spoke to Me "I didn't introduce myself earlier, I am officer McCartney, I just wanted to tell you that we still haven't found the killer but we are searching for him,your neighbor colette is okay,if you see anything suspicious tell me" 

I then replied to him "please tell me when you find him" 

A smile dawned on his face and he said "I will tell you" he then turned around and walked to his car and then he started driving to the police station. 

I closed the door and I then put the key in the door and locked the door, I checked again to see if the door was locked, then I went to the backdoor to check if the backdoor was locked, I pulled on the handle and the door was locked,I looked at the keyhole and saw my key is in the door,I felt a wave of safety wash over me. 

I then sat on my couch and turned on the TV so that I could watch some movies
