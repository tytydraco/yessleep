Okay, I know how weird this sounds, but I swear I’m not making this up... 

Back when I was 9, my parents got me a 3DS for Christmas, it came with Pokémon X and Animal Crossing: New Leaf. I played the hell out of both, but mostly Pokémon at first, because everyone at school was obsessed with it. I didn’t even touch Animal Crossing until like a month later.

Anyway, when I finally booted it up, I remember everything about that intro: the train, Rover asking questions, the cozy music. Then suddenly I’m the mayor, which I thought was hilarious at the time. Like, yeah sure, just got off a train, guess I’m in charge now.

But here’s where things get weird.

As far as I know, when you start the game, there are supposed to be five villagers in your town. (Not counting Isabelle.) But I had six.

There was Jacob (same name as me, which I thought was funny), Axel, Chrissy, Olaf, Bunnie, and then… Mary. A white dove villager with soft blue eyes and an olive branch where here ears would be if she had any. I got this drawing for you guys to get the idea. Literally looked like some peace symbol mascot. But even with all that, she looked like she fits right in.

She was always hanging out near the river or the bridge. But the first time I talked to her is what stuck with me.

She wasn’t like the other villagers. Her text box didn’t just pop up with “Hello there!” or whatever. She was already talking, as if I walked in on a conversation she was having with herself. Her head turned from my player character to the screen, like to me. She looked right at me. Not in a creepy way, though. It felt… warm. Familiar.

And then she said:
“Hey… Jace.”

Now, here’s the thing. My name in the game was “Jacob.” That’s what I told Rover. But Jace? That was a nickname only my biological mom used to call me when I was little. No one else did. Not my dad. Not my stepmom. Not my friends.

It hit me weird at the time, but I was a kid. I didn’t question it. I just remember smiling. It felt nice. Like she really knew me.

Mary and I would talk and played games every time I played. Not just the usual villager stuff, either. She asked me about school, my drawings, how I was feeling. We’d play tag in the game, or she’d have me set my 3DS on top of a shelf, hide somewhere, and then wait for her to spot me through the screen… like Where’s Waldo lol. Sometimes I’d open the game just to find her. She never repeated herself. I remember once, when I was home sick with the flu, she told me to “Remember the mint tea with honey.”

My mom, my bio mom, used to make that exact thing when I was sick. Not my stepmom. She gave me cherry cough drops I hated.

I told my friend at school about Mary, and he looked at me like I was messing with him. Said there’s no bird villager named Mary in New Leaf. I even googled it years later. Nothing. Not even in the cut content or dev leaks.

The last time I saw her, it was raining in-game and outside. She was sitting on the bench near the town tree. When I walked up to her, she looked up at me again, and said:
“It’s okay if you don’t remember everything. I’ll remember for you.”

I never saw her again after that. A couple weeks later, I left my 3DS at my dad’s house. I moved shortly after, and I never got it back.

It’s been over a decade. I’m in my 20s now. Sometimes I wonder if I imagined it all, or if maybe I had some weird dream-like memory glitch. But it felt so real. She felt real.

And the name. The tea. The nickname.

Nowhere on the internet is there a “Mary Animal Crossing villager”. Not on Nookipedia, Twitter (I’m not calling it X), Reddit, Facebook, even YouTube. But I know I saw her, I know I talked to her, and I know that I NEED to get back to her.

I know what I need to do.
