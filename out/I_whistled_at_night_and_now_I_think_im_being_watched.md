This happened four days ago, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget it. I’m never coming back to the village again. I was staying with my grandma in a small Japanese village while taking a break from the city. It’s a quiet place surrounded by mountains and dense forests, and though I’ve visited before, it always feels a bit… eerie at night. My grandma is a firm believer in old traditions and superstitions such as *Yokai*. One of her biggest warnings was to never whistle after dark.

She used to say it invites *Yonaki-sama*, the Night Caller. I always thought it was just one of those creepy stories meant to keep kids from staying out late, but now I know it’s not.

That night, I had gone into town for an important Japanese festival. I stayed later than I’d planned, and by the time I started walking back to my grandma’s house, it was pitch black. The village doesn’t have streetlights, and my phone’s flashlight was barely enough to light the road. To calm myself, I started whistling, just a cheerful tune to break the silence.

Almost immediately, I heard it—a whistle coming from the trees. It mimicked my tune exactly. I froze. I knew there shouldn’t have been anyone else out there. The road was empty, and the forest was too dense for someone to move quietly.

Trying to brush it off, I whistled again, this time out of nervousness. The reply came faster, closer, and somehow… sharper, like the sound was cutting through the air. I felt my chest tighten as I realised this wasn’t an echo.

I picked up my pace, but the whistling followed me. It stayed the same distance behind me, no matter how fast I walked. Then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped.

That’s when I heard it above me.

I looked up, and my stomach dropped. Against the faint light of the stars, I saw something. It was tall, impossibly thin, and its limbs stretched out like a broken puppet suspended in the air. Its head was playfully tilted to one side, almost curiously, and it swayed gently, like it was waiting for me to do something.

I don’t know how I managed to move, but I ran as fast as I could, my heart pounding. When I finally reached my grandma’s house, I slammed the door shut and locked every window and door. For a moment, I thought I was safe.

Then I heard it.

The whistling started again, this time right outside the house.

“Keiko-chan,” a soft voice called, mimicking my grandma’s tone. “Come outside. Let me in.”

I didn’t respond. I didn’t even breathe. The voice grew more insistent, the whistling shriller.

And then I heard a creak from the corner of the room. I turned slowly, and there it was. That thing had followed me inside. It unfolded itself from the shadows, its long limbs stretching and its head tilting toward me.

I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t move. Then, out of sheer desperation, I remembered something my grandma had said earlier: *Light always chases away the dark.*

My hands shook as I grabbed a small lantern on the table and lit it. The flame flickered, casting a warm glow around the room. As soon as the light touched the creature, it let out this horrible, piercing whistle—like a train screeching to a halt. It writhed and shrank back, dissolving into the shadows until it was gone.

The next morning, I told my grandma everything. She nodded solemnly and handed me a small wooden talisman she had carved. She told me it was meant to keep *Yonaki-sama* away but warned me to never whistle at night again.

I’ve kept the talisman on me ever since. I haven’t heard the whistling again, but at night, when the wind blows just right, I swear I can feel something watching me from the shadows. If you’re ever in a small village in Japan, heed the warnings. And whatever you do, don’t whistle after dark. You never know who’s listening…
