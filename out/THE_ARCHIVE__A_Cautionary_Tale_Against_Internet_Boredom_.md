It regularly happens that when browsing the internet you fall into a loop where you no longer remember the reason why you decided to enter the web in the first place and why you are spending your time searching it to begin with, either for a change of reason, interest or because you simply run out of ideas of what to see and you get lost in a hole of things without any meaning . 

To the extent that what you are seeing may not be entirely to your liking .

This type of thing happens to all people , but i highlight it with respect to my experience in particular and that is that I am not exempt from anything that I mention , since it could be said that I am the one who has fallen deeper into this hole to the point where I have made a big mistake that I would rather have avoided .

Because there is something specific that I have come to see that caught my attention and not in a good way , in fact it is too criticizable due to its extreme crudeness , and I mention again that I have made an error not only because I perceive it that way, but because when I delve into the deepest part of the internet, I must warn you that it can be very common to find this type of content .

my experience begins with a video of dubious origin and without a title belonging to a deep web site called " THE ARCHIVARY " , a site in which you can find all sorts of stuff you wouldn't be able to see in the surface part of the internet .

 This video showed 2 men in a kitchen preparing meatloaf , with one of them pointing out that this is not very good and that it can not be served , which greatly discourages the other man and makes him  leave the kitchen momentarily with what he was preparing , to return with a tray with pieces of what appears to be already prepared squid , having replaced the meatloaf with that , covered in a black substance that at first sight could be said to be the ink that these animals expel naturally as a method of self-defense .

 This for some reason makes the first man bewildered and forces the other to take out the tray of squid from the kitchen and continue making the first dish, which already made me see that something strange may be found in this initially normal-looking video .

It continued with the second man mentioning how complex the squid preparation process is and how he has to work harder than he is able to , to make a dish with this animal, while he said this ,  he looked strangely scared which gives me another indication that something is not right with this video .

The first thing I thought , as silly as it is ,  is that both men had stolen a squid from an aquarium and had killed and cooked it without anyone knowing it, in order to succeed in their kitchen with a more exotic dish and potentially be able to sell it .

I did not understand if there was something unintentionally comical in this video but I did not see anything funny in thinking that an innocent animal was stripped of its home and livehood and cruelly mutilated to become food .

But do not be confused, It 's not because of my compassion for animals that is so famous among the people who know me , but because this video made no sense at all , bordered on the pathetic and semi - absurd and did not seem to be something enjoyable to watch .

 It was bizarre by all accounts . Especially since it ended so abruptly just showing this scared man. 

So what would you think if I told you there is an alternate idea of ​​this footage totally different from the one I'm offering you and I'm not sure if I should let you know?

And it is that in the hidden files of this site there is another version of this video that should not be known because what it would show to the public is not only completely aberrant, but if it were found and made known, it would literally make this site receive very negative comments and even be involved in legal problems for hosting this material in secret.

The alternate version of the video is stored in the most recondite of this site and has not been eliminated up to this point , having a reputation of urban legend in the superficial part of " THE ARCHIVARY , with several users assuring in the forums of the page that this hidden footage exists and that you must have certain technical knowledge to be able to access it on the portal .

Very specific knowledge used by people who are dedicated to searching for lost or inaccessible material on the deep web .

Which is obviously handled with total anonymity and that they prefer not to reveal how they find what no one else can, since otherwise, seeing themselves linked in some way to these materials could generate unforeseen problems for themselves in a short time .

Finding out about this, I began to study how to manage the deep web in a more expert way and how to help myself with a bit of computing, and I can tell you that after several months I have been able to find Finally the rumored banned version of this mysterious video .

It was complete, albeit without the option to download and next to it came a separate text almost indecipherable at first glance that I later discovered was a link to another site on the deep web with another type of material, apparently related , showing a recipe of a kind i've never seen before , but let's not lose sight of what was mentioned at the beginning.

The video was available to watch with no apparent problem and was 10 minutes long, showing the following:

Supposedly the 2 men whose names remained unmentioned , could not find a way to prepare an attractive and tasty dish that would allow them to share their interest in cooking with others , they tried all the options available to them and not even their passion for cooking and the determination to do something that could exceed their expectations helped to create the perfect dish .

For this reason , a third man also unidentified makes a sudden appearance on the scene without a clear reason and begins to mock both cooks for their obvious failure with their objective .

This made the man who in the other video was dissatisfied with the meatloaf get annoyed with the third for his mockery and in an impulsive action , hit him in the nose with such a degree of force that he immediately achieved that he expelled blood and for it to spill on his hand .

Due to the nature and force of the blow, the blood covered a large part of his fingers. The man , having an apparent repudiation for something so unhygienic being a cook , only became more furious , giving a brutal beating to the third man for this same reason .

With the help of his friend who also seemed annoyed by the unwanted presence of this , the brutality of both caused much of the man 's blood to be spread on the ground , the badly wounded man tried to get away from both but they dragged him and continued hitting and kicking him until he was unconscious .

After this unpleasant event to witness , both began to complain about how their kitchen had become a bigger mess than it already was in a non-literal sense and how now they had to clean the blood-soaked floor and find a way to remove the body without anyone knowing that they had attacked this man until he was unconscious .

One of them takes a wet cloth and detergent and is about to start cleaning, however he stops to observe the blood for no apparent reason and in an impulsive and bizarre action , he picks it up with his finger and begins to lick it . 


 Which generates displeasure in the other man who tells him that doing this is disgusting and even pathetic , making us see his obsession with being hygienic once again . 

The man who licked the blood stops for a second and then tells him that strangely it doesn't taste so bad and after several seconds of incessant demand, he convinces him to try it too, after doing so with much doubt and indisposition, Clearly compelled .

 He is surprised to discover that his friend was right and that the taste of blood was not bad at all, having drawn out their strange curiosity, they both look at each other with intrigue and delight .

Noticing how the taste of they had liked the blood more than expected and how trying new things can add a new perspective to their monotonous lives .

 Seeing that there was still blood scattered on the floor, they decided to carefully pick it up and place it in a glass jar .

One of them comments that their new disposition would be a total success if joined with the kitchen , realizing that all they needed was to be more daring so that their passion and potential business would flow as they always wanted .

And that now nothing would stop them regarding what they were going to do, which already gave me the certainty at that moment that I was not expecting to see something good .

After finishing collecting the blood , they dragged the body of the third man out of the chamber into another room , saying that now they would end all their problem , after a tense pause of eternal sensation , both return without the man saying that everything is finished and that there is no doubt or bad feeling inside both of them , without him on camera , what was already worrying me .

They begin to say that they should " look for more " without giving an indication of what they were referring to , only denoting that now success was waiting for them , not only because of the money but now they had something big in their lives .

 Bigger than their insecurities or the possible greed of benefiting from a business , and that what they had now was something that had never happened to them but should have always been like that , the last thing they said that they should do that everything would work to ensure personal success, that their kitchen would now be big and free from failure.

At the end you see them both take the camera and leave the house yelling " squid , squid ! Squid people ! " , a bizarre and incoherent exclamation that after much thought made me realize something absolutely macabre and horribly unexpected .

After being beaten until he became unconscious, the man's body was not hidden, but rather mutilated and mixed with pieces of squid and ink to create the dish that was so disconcerting in the other video, apparently, I came across something that should not be seen by nobody, something that should not have been made known indirectly in the first video

It really makes you think , how the most inoffensive thing can take you to the darkest part of humanity , and how even the monsters themselves do not want to see what they have become , or more exactly , not to be seen that way by the most human

Whether it's a joke or an act of intimidation on the part of that man, I won't be able to get the appearance of that saucer out of my mind and what it ended up triggering.

I should have kept my first option regarding the preparation of the squid, as cruel as it is too.....
