He was dying. I knew it and from the look of panic in his sunken eyes, he did too. And I was angry; no, that’s an understatement. I was livid. Fucking furious. He’s 37 for Christ sake! This kind of shit doesn’t happen to a 37 year old. My mind began to spiral as it had been doing for the last 6 hellish days, jumping from one fevered thought to the next: existential dread at living out the rest of my life without him, wishing I could take his place, all the practical things that surround death like wills, assets, obituaries, funerals.  

I can’t do this! I cannot fucking do this! The fear that had been shrieking and flapping around my head, scratching at my mind, settled on my chest, suffocating me with its dead weight.  

My mind travelled to the hospital before his surgery. He’d looked too large for the room, sitting on the bed in the blue hospital gown, making weak jokes about how you could see his arse. He was trying to be brave for me but I could see the tense set of his jaw, the way he started any time footsteps approached the room only to quietly exhale in relief when they continued on by. His big hands worried at the hem of his gown and I took them in mine to still them. I raised them to my lips, remembering all the times they’d soothed my aching shoulders, cooked for me, been laced through my hair as he’d kissed me, pulled me to him. I knew them better than I knew my own.  

It pained me that now, looking down, I hardly recognised those beautiful strong hands, swollen and puffy with all the fluids from so many IVs, waxen and yellow. Death robs you of all identity: as your senses go one by one, as your body fails, as every organ shuts down and the meat melts from your bones, you look like any other dying person. It’s cruel in it’s slow but inevitable gradualness. A piece of you is sloughed away, then another and another, like the carving of meat until only the gristle remains.  

The consultant’s words echoed around me as though he were in the room speaking them once more. 

As you know, it’s already spread all through his body…there’d been more, but I hadn’t heard it. I hadn’t known. Had no idea. Spread…spread…spread…body…body…body… The words bounced off our bedroom walls. I thought I saw them take the shape of shadowy birds, careering around the room, rising to the ceiling and swooping low to the ground. Their sharp beaks and glinting talons would tear me to pieces soon enough.  

“Shut the fuck up” I said through furiously gritted teeth.  

The hallucinations had started on the morning of day 3. Movement caught from the corner of my eye, shadows ominously filling the corners, faces in the cracks and crevices of the room. I was so on edge by then that every sound, real or imagined, made my stomach flip over and my pulse quicken. I’d had to push our dog out into the hallway on day 4 because her snoring sounded to me like the breathing of some sinister beast lying in wait to carve my love from me. She’d taken to sticking her nose and her paws under the door whining to be allowed back in but I ignored the noise as one of many, tuning all of them out and focusing solely on breath: mine and his.  

On day 5, I began to smell things. Rotten things, dead things, laced with the odd, salty smell of the ocean and the damp, dark smell of a forest, as ancient as the world, or time itself. The shadows pressed down on me, dark and weighty. That’s also when I started to see it, hunched like a gargoyle, more like a negative space, sucking away light and life, than a presence. Sometimes I thought I saw it squatting in the corner, rocking on its heels, sometimes it grasped at us with greedy hands. In the evening it had begun to circle the bed like a tiger, stalking its prey or maybe more like a shark. The dog, no doubt sensing my fear, began to whimper and bark, scratching so violently that the door strained on its hinges. Sometimes the thing would crawl under the bed out of sight but I still always felt it. When this happened, I was scared to step down to the floor in case I felt its blank hands grasping at my ankles.  

By day 6, I had relented and let the dog back in. The noises she made were nothing now compared to the ones my mind was conjuring. Her warm little body on my lap was reassuring and I clutched her to me as a child holds a beloved teddy to stave off the monsters in his closet or under his bed. I knew it was a kind of madness that had taken me then and I knew the cause.  The problem is, you have nothing to do but think when you’re waiting for someone to die. Think and plead.  

“Please” I muttered for the millionth time “please anyone, anything! Please don’t take him from me.” I placed the sponge once more in the cool bowl of water by our bedside and ran it over his parched lips, gums and tongue. His unseeing eyes, darting from side to side in fear, cleaved my heart in two.  

“Hush love” I soothed softly, “it’s ok. I’m here”. I smoothed his sweat-dampened hair and ran my hands over his cheeks, his nose, his mouth, until he closed his eyes and his soft breathing filled the room. His face relaxed infinitesimally as sleep took him but I could feel no relief. Every muscle in my body tensed as I listened for the next breath and the next. The gap between them was a lifetime. I knew the time would come when there would be no next and I knew I would shatter and smash, scattered in ragged shards and everything would be lost.  

If only to stop my tense nerves from snapping like a rubber band stretched too thin, I decided to use the time while he was sleeping to do the mundane tasks that needed to be done. I set his phone beside him, as close to his mouth as possible, called it from mine, put in my earbuds to free up my hands so I could go as quickly as possible and, stepping into the hallway to make sure his shallow breathing reverberated in my ears, I set myself to the tasks ahead, freezing in place whenever there was a particularly long pause between breaths, ready to fly back to his side on wings of panic should it not come.  

Life should stop at times like these but of course the dog still needed to be fed and let out to the bathroom, I had to force down coffee, the food people kept leaving on my front step had to be retrieved, even if only to sit on the worktop and rot. The nurse would be coming in a couple of hours to check on him, change his IV bags, update his notes etc. I begrudgingly tidied up, throwing the spoiled food, which had begun to attract fat flies, into the bin outside. I sprayed air freshener in every room, hurriedly wiped down surfaces, I even washed myself quickly, cleaned by teeth and dragged a brush through my lank hair.  

I returned to the room thinking of the nurse with her sympathetic smiles, her crisp efficiency, the way she’d talk to him in a singsong voice as though he were a child. She’d started to develop a worrying habit of holding me by the shoulders and looking searchingly into my eyes asking, 

“And how are you coping?”  

Concern would wrinkle her pretty brow. How the fuck did she think I was coping? I always wanted to grab her by the wrist and drag her out of our house but instead I would shrug, give a weak smile and say I was fine and thank her. I had to reassure her, I had to make sure the house looked decent, I had to make her believe that I was coping because I was terrified that they’d take him away from me. I couldn’t let him die in that miserable hospital that reeked of illness and death and bleach and cheap flowers as one of many. I couldn’t. I couldn’t let him die at all! Again I pleaded with I don’t know who not to take him from me. I thought the shadows in the room darkened. I heard a low snarl rise from below. I inched my body closer to him and lay my head on his bony shoulder. The nearness of him still comforting. The dog wriggled forward and rested her head on my hip, sighing a little, the warmth of her thawing the chill of my body only slightly.  

I woke with a jolt, fear robbed the breath from my body as I pressed my ear to his cracked lips, holding my breath so as better to hear his. Relief washed over me like a cleansing balm when I heard his whisper of an exhale.  

Thank you! I whispered and with a jolt I realised I was talking to it. The creature. I reached for my phone on the bedside table. The nurse would surely be here soon. I cursed as my shaking fingers fumbled, knocking the phone to the floor where it bounced out of sight. Leaning off the bed, I reached down, patting the floor to find it. Unable to, I slid to the floor in one fluid motion. It was nowhere in sight. It must have bounced on the carpet and fallen further under the bed. I began to crawl underneath, feeling in the darkness with outstretched arms.  

I’m not really sure how to explain what happened next. If you can imagine the sensation of being pulled and falling at the same time, falling both down and up, squeezing your body through a space that’s too small, darkness pressing down on you like it has weight, I suppose that would approach what I felt.  

I landed with a bone-jarring thud that sent shockwaves from my tailbone where it had hit the ground, right up my spine. Groaning, I pulled myself first to me knees then to my feet. The sounds of my movement and the involuntary noises of pain that I made, echoed back to me telling me that wherever I was, it was large. As I walked forward, torches on the walls of the cavern began to illuminate, casting a ghostly glow over an enormous spiral staircase. It was eerily silent, making every step I took sound even louder as it split the air, filling me with an overwhelming sense that I shouldn’t have been there. I imagined eyes watching me, some malevolent presence that wanted me gone from that place, resented my being where I clearly didn’t belong. I began to run, tripping and falling again and again. As I rounded the last corner, I saw him: a figure cloaked and veiled. It was too late to halt my progress, the polished white marble floor was unforgiving and I slid, landing at the hem of his cloak in a way that would have been funny in any other circumstance. His clothes were so fine they could have been woven by spiders; layers and layers shrouded his massive frame and all I could see through that impenetrable veil was two glittering eyes. I couldn’t hold his gaze. I scrambled to my feet one final time and looked down at the floor.  

When he spoke, his voice sounded ancient. All the knowledge of millennia was contained in that voice. This was a being who’d seen the birth and death of every human and animal since time began. Every empire as it rose and fell. Every age of the planet, every dawn of a new day.  

“Why have you come here, child?” I allowed my gaze to flick back to those eyes, trying to read something there but I could see nothing. He sounded neither angry nor encouraging. His voice was somehow devoid of tone. As blank as his eyes were to me.  

“I... I don’t know,” I stammered, “I was under my bed and now... well...” I gestured around as if to show the ludicrousness of my situation. His eyes burned brighter and I looked away again, sensing that I’d said the wrong thing.  

“You must be truthful here Alice. There’s no place for lies in this realm. There’s nothing more honest than death.” I shuddered. The truth was I knew why I was there. I knew what that shadow in my room had been. I could have tried to turn around at any point during my descent, go back but I hadn’t. And whilst I'd been pulled into this room involuntarily, hadn’t it been the result of my actions since the day I’d arrived home from the hospital? All my pleading and bargaining? Keeping my lover alive with sheer force of will? So yes, I’d chosen to be here from the second I’d landed and I knew why too. I cleared my throat and though my voice trembled a little, it surprised me with its strength and intensity.  

“I’ve come to save a life.” He nodded, the only sign that I had said the right thing.  

“If you wish to go on, you must answer a question, a riddle of sorts. Answer correctly and you may continue though I would caution against it. Answer incorrectly and you must go back for I will not let you pass.” Fucking hell so I’m in some kind of underworld quiz show? Luckily I’m good at riddles and I suppose the worst that could happen if I didn’t know the answer was that I’d have to leave. He wasn’t going to eat me or anything. I nodded to show I understood. A great sigh came from him then, causing the veils to flutter. “The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?” 

The more you take, the more you leave behind... what’s something that could be taken but left. It couldn’t be a physical object could it? No I didn’t think so. Money? No that didn’t make sense. I wracked my brain and suddenly it came to me. The echoes of them had followed me throughout my journey down the staircase.  

“Footsteps!” I replied triumphantly. “The more footsteps you take, the more footsteps are left behind but if you’re walking away from something, you’re also leaving things behind. The more you walk away, the more things are left so it’s footsteps!” He nodded again.  

“You may continue on then Alice but hear me well, should you continue on this path, what you’re leaving behind is a piece of yourself. Think about that. No one who enters the underworld can return to the world of the living whole. Is this a sacrifice you’re willing to make? You need not take another step. You can go back and accept the natural order of things. All that lives must die. It’s what gives life value. If you continue, you are disrupting that cycle. Think carefully before you choose to go on, before you choose another footstep.”   

I didn’t need to think carefully. I knew what I was going to do. I’d known it since the second I’d found out that he was dying. I would do whatever it took to keep him with me. It wasn’t even a choice.  

“I’ll go on” I said simply. He stood aside without another word, opening an enormous door. Through the door I saw a lake. It was the deepest blue, surrounded by shores of white sand and so vast that I couldn’t yet see the other side. Lying slightly on its side on the shore was a little boat carved of wood. I could hear strange echoing cries and moans. As I neared the water, I could see figures in its depths. Some were moving and some were lying eerily still. It made me think of the River Stix from Greek Mythology. I could easily believe that these were the souls of the damned swimming the water, trapped for all eternity. I pushed the little boat to the water’s edge, careful not to touch the water itself, and clambered in. Using the oars to push off from the shore, I began to row across the lake. As I rowed further from the shore, I could see a door on the other side and I knew that was my destination. On I continued, the door my only goal, not noticing as a mist began to settle over the lake. The further I rowed, the more the mist thickened, enveloping the boat in an eerie shroud. Suddenly, a haunting melody filled the air, a melancholic tune that tugged at my very soul. 

From the depths of the lake emerged a young woman, her ghostly form gliding gracefully across the water's glass-like surface. Her ethereal beauty was mesmerising, her hair and clothing floating around her seemed part of both the mist and the water alike, floating as though she were suspended still in the lake. 

With a voice as soft as the sigh of the wind, the maiden beckoned to me, her words a seductive whisper in the stillness of the mist. "Come closer, dear traveller," she murmured. "Let me ease your burdens, let me soothe your troubled heart." 

As I drew nearer, I couldn’t help but be drawn by her beauty and sorrow. She spoke of lost loves and broken dreams, the pain of longing and the sweet release of surrender. She could have been speaking my own thoughts aloud. The pain of watching the person I loved most in the world fading away right before my eyes. I’m not sure when I stood up: I only became aware of it when the boat wobbled dangerously, threatening to tip me overboard. I could just go to her; jump overboard and stay with her. Why was I even fighting it? Wouldn’t it be easier? With each stroke of the oars, I felt myself pulled ever closer to the woman’s embrace, my resolve weakening in the face of such overwhelming despair. 

As I rowed further into the thickening mist, an oppressive chill settled over me, seeping into my bones like icy tendrils of fear. The once serene waters of the lake now seemed to boil with a malevolent energy, their depths concealing unseen horrors, lurking just beneath the surface. 

The haunting melody that emanated from the maiden's lips grew louder, filling the air with a cacophony of pain. My heart pounded in my chest as I struggled to resist the pull of her song, my mind clouded by a suffocating sense of dread. With each stroke of the oars, the mist seemed to close in around me, obscuring my vision and distorting my sense of direction. Shadows danced along the surface of the water, twisting and writhing like spirits greedy to claim my soul. 

Suddenly, the maiden's ghostly form loomed before me, her eyes burned with an otherworldly light that sent shivers down my spine. "Come closer, dear traveller," she whispered, her voice dripping with honeyed malice. "Let me show you the true depths of despair." 

My breath caught in my throat as I felt myself drawn towards her against my will, my hands trembling as they gripped the oars. I could feel the darkness closing in around me, suffocating me with its oppressive weight. But somewhere deep within me, a flicker of defiance ignited—a primal instinct urging me to fight against that which threatened to consume me. With a guttural cry, I summoned every ounce of strength I possessed, driving the oars through the water with desperate determination. 

The boat lurched forward, its wooden frame groaning in protest as I propelled myself away from her monstrous grasp. For a fleeting moment, I caught a glimpse of the terror that lay hidden beneath the surface of the lake—the twisted faces of the damned, their anguished cries echoing through the air. The souls who had been unable to resist her siren’s call, I now knew with certainty and that gave me the strength I needed to break free of the spell that threatened to consume me, to drag me down to the depths with all the other souls before me.  

With a final surge of adrenaline, my boat careened towards the distant shore with reckless abandon. As I stumbled onto the sand, gasping for air, I knew that I’d had a narrow escape. Even as I caught my breath, I couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was still watching me from the depths below—a lurking presence that hungered for my soul and would stop at nothing to claim it. As I turned my gaze towards the open door that lay before me, I knew that I had been foolish. I’d need to have my wits about me if I wanted to make it out of this place at all.  

I stepped through the door onto a carpet of twigs and leaves, slimy and putrid. Sap oozed from the gaping maws of gnarled old trees like pus from a festering wound. I pushed myself to my feet, the sounds I made, in the quiet of the wood, too loud, disturbed the birds in the canopy above me. They took to the black sky, screaming as they flew. Spread…spread…spread…body…body…body. The hairs rose on my arms and I knew something was watching me. I was sure it was the creature from the room. I knew its presence now, knew how it felt to be watched and stalked by it.  

I spun around, searching the shadows of that wood. The whiplash, echoing snap in the stillness of breaking twigs, whipped me around again and I saw it, squatting once more beside a blackened stump. As I watched, it arched its back and began to rise. Bent deformed limbs straightened in jerky movements with a sound like breaking bones. Here a twisted neck straightened. CRACK! There a bent arm made straight. SNAP! A bowed, hunched back, broke and reformed. Legs once squat and crooked became lithe and fine. Until before me, the same pitch black as before, was the shape of a tall, impossibly slim man. His shoulders proud and square, his arms and legs, long and graceful, his jaw set high and proud. He looked strangely two dimensional as though a gentle gust of wind would blow him away to dance on its breeze with the leaves. As he set off deeper into the forest, it didn’t even occur to me not to follow him. My feet began to move in his direction without my even thinking if I should. Nothing could scare me now. Nothing was more horrifying to me than what was inevitably to come when I would lose my reason for being.  

As we walked, the trees thinned and I could see the sky. It was the rich indigo of ink and filled with glittering stars. With the sounds no longer deadened by the forest, I realised that we must be near a beach, for I heard the rush of waves roaring close by, the rhythmic cycle as they lapped the shore, soothing and familiar. Different from the eerie silence and stillness of the lake. I tasted salt in the air. I quickened my steps for he was moving swiftly and my clumsy feet, tripping over tree roots, and stumbling on stones, couldn’t carry me at the same speed.  

After some time, I saw him ahead, entering a little house in a clearing, made of wood, with a thatched roof, half looking like the forest was trying to reclaim it. Ivy climbed its walls and a tree was growing inside and bursting through the roof. The birds filled its branches but they were silent now, eyeing me pensively as I stepped out of the trees. I followed him into that weird little house in the middle of the wood, under my bed, where my love lay dying, ducking beneath the low door frame. A woman sat in a rocking chair before a fire which crackled and danced.   

I made to leave, thinking I’d somehow made a mistake, but the woman beckoned me forward with a long, withered finger, gesturing to the empty chair beside her. I obeyed, sitting with my knees together, hands clasped, waiting. Her skin, stretched too tight over her skeleton, was stained and papery thin like old parchment. Spidery veins webbed her hands and cheeks and when the light from the fire danced upon her face, it lent a look of such transparency that I fancied I could see the bones of her skull beneath. Her hair was long, thick and white, her eyes black. She smiled a toothless grin that was somehow too big for her face and sent a thousand tiny insects’ feet marching down my spine.  

I looked about the small room for the man but he was nowhere in sight. I opened my mouth to ask for him but she silenced me with a look. Her voice when she spoke was dry as the ashes of the fire, old as the forest she dwelled in.  

“Why have you come?” She tilted her head at an unnatural angle, resting her ear on her shoulder, the fire spluttered and shrank a little, the room became darker, the shadows more dense.  “And before you answer remember: this is no place for lies, selfish one. Lies have consequences in places like this, in the dark places of the world.” She spoke mildly but the warning was plain.  

“What is this place?” I asked, deliberately evading her question as I didn’t know what she was or what she wanted. The fire dimmed more, the shadows began to take the shape of human arms and hands, clawing their way from the ceiling down the walls, a wind whistled through the little house, whipping up my hair around me but leaving hers curiously undisturbed.  

She tutted. “Even a question can be a lie. Now answer mine, why have you come?” I tried to think of how to respond. A lie and I was sure the shadows would engulf me. But did I want to tell her the truth? A deep, hidden part of me knew the creature I’d been seeing since bargaining and pleading with the darker forces of the world, since keeping him alive by sheer force of my will and nothing more when even he seemed to want to die. I knew why I was here just as I knew the panic and fear in my lover’s eyes hadn’t been for his dying but for my keeping him much longer than I should have. He was scared of me. I decided to be completely honest.  

“I’ve come because I won’t let you take him. I’ve come to keep him.” She smiled and nodded slowly as the fire grew and the shadows receded a little.  

“Do you know who I am?” 

“I think so.” She nodded, encouraging me to answer. “You’re death” I said simply.  

“Yes and no. I’m all that was and is and shall be. I’m birth and life and yes death, for you can’t have any one without the other. I’m there when a man lies with a woman, spreads her open and meets her body with his and life begins.”  

Spread…spread…spread…body…body…body. Those awful, black birds screamed from the branches of the tree that grew through the roof above us.  

“When a woman labours in blood and pain and brings that life into the world. As that child grows and learns and discovers all that life has to offer him. When he becomes a man, when he loves, when he feels loss or joy or incredible sadness. And when his time is done, I claim him back to me, for he was mine all along. I am the harbinger of fate, my love, and your battle is futile. Look at the fire, see what is already writ. There is nothing you can do to change things now. Death is beautiful. Death gives life meaning. Your lover should already be dead.” 

She smiled her twisted smile, the squeak of the chair as she rocked back and forward sounded in time with the lapping of the ocean. I turned from her, staring into the fire. As I watched, the dancing flames began to shape themselves into ghostly orange figures: a baby at his mother’s breast, a child taking his first steps, a toddler beating his fists on the floor in frustration, on it continued until I saw the face of my love. The fire marked the milestones of his life. I saw him grow to a gawky teenager, an awkward 20 something yet to properly fill out, skinny and uncoordinated, a man fully grown, broad and strong and good. I saw his face reflected as it had been across the table from me on our first date. Saw the look of love grow in his eyes as time continued to jump forward in little reels, little snapshots. His face as I’d walked down the aisle towards him. All the times we’d made love and laughed and fought and cried, everything we’d shared together. I reached towards his fiery likeness, not caring that it hurt, unconcerned when I smelled the down hairs on my arms beginning to singe. I wanted to crawl into that fire to meet him. When an image of him in the doctor’s surgery flickered before me, I turned away. I’d experienced everything that came after once already, I’d no need to go through it again.  

A sob began in the pit of my stomach, clawing its way up my throat, tearing its way free of my mouth to echo in the still air. I covered my face with my hands, not wanting her to see the tears that flowed freely for the first time since the day my world had ended. I’d grown used to hiding my tears. I’d hidden in the bathroom, running the taps so he couldn’t hear me. I’d taken the dog out and broken down as I wandered the streets.  

I froze when I felt a weight on my knees. Peering between my hands, I saw that the old woman was resting her hands there, her movements curiously serpentine, she slithered her way up my body, stretching her tongue out towards my face, moaning, a high keening moan. Frozen in fear, I watched the flames flicker across her face, each change of light and shadow showing something new: first her face flashed young, plump and smooth, then hollowed and bare, an incarnation of the skull-like visage of Santa Muerte, then the creature reappeared, twisted and ghastly. A tear landed on her outstretched tongue, hissed and evaporated like water meeting a hot pan. She began to dig her nails into my knees, the moaning growing louder and more guttural as she licked the tears first from my chest then my neck. As she reached my cheeks, I recoiled, pushing her violently away from me, sending the chair crashing to the ground as I scuttled back from her. She lay in a heap on the floor, obsidian eyes reflecting the flames. She raised her head, like a wolf to the moon, opened her mouth and screamed. It was a scream that shook the little house around us. Wider and wider her mouth opened, wider than any human’s, the shadows from the wall were sucked into her gaping mouth, then the birds from the trees, debris from the packed earth floor. I made my escape as the walls of the house began to shudder more violently. Like Orpheus fleeing the underworld, I somehow knew I shouldn’t look back.  

I ran blindly through the wood with no thought as to where I was going. The branches grabbed at my clothes and tore at my skin as I stumbled on. I fell hard to the ground over and over, rendering my knees a bloodied mess. Such was my desperation to escape the house in the woods, to escape my fate, that I dragged myself up and when I couldn’t do this quickly enough, I crawled. Anything to continue to propel myself forward. I began to feel a change in the forest floor. I began to feel sand beneath my feet as a ran, the trees thinning, until I found myself looking up at the most beautiful sight I’d ever seen: a permanent solar eclipse. Disoriented and exhausted, my legs gave out under me and I dropped like a stone.  

I looked across the sand to the ocean and began to take deep steadying breaths in time to the waves. In…whoosh…out…whoosh…in…whoosh…out…whoosh… My breath became the very water itself. I blew, pushing the water away from me and it retreated from the shore; I sucked in air, drawing the water back to me. Inhale, exhale, ebb and flow. I felt my heart rate begin to slow. 

I lay on my back on the sand, gazing up at the celestial phenomenon that occurred within the depths of the underworld, where the sun and moon were locked in a perpetual state of alignment, casting the realm into eternal twilight. In this timeless twilight, shadows reigned supreme, and the boundaries between light and darkness blurred into obscurity; everything felt terrifyingly real and completely imagined all at once somehow. The eternal eclipse, a stark representation of the perpetual struggle between opposing forces, the balance between life and death, and the cyclical nature of existence, was the most awful and awesome thing I had ever seen. I knew it was a realm where the laws of nature were suspended, and reality itself was subject to the whims of cosmic forces beyond mortal comprehension.   

As I lay there, the weight of the eclipse bore down upon me like a heavy blanket, suffocating me with its oppressive presence as much as it swaddled me in a protective layer. The air seemed to thicken around me, charged with an otherworldly energy that made my skin prickle with unease. 

In the distance, I could hear faint whispers, a voice echoing through the twilight like a distant memory. Its words were incomprehensible, a jumble of murmurs that danced on the edge of my consciousness. 

I closed my eyes, trying to shut out the overwhelming sensation of being watched, but even in the darkness behind my eyelids, I could feel somethings gaze upon me, probing and probing until it felt like it was peeling away the layers of my soul. With a shudder, I forced myself to sit up, the sand shifting beneath me as I struggled to find my footing in this strange and unsettling place. The shadows seemed to swirl around me, twisting and contorting into grotesque shapes that leered and taunted me. I had to keep moving, to press on despite the overwhelming sense of dread that threatened to consume me. Something was out there, lurking in the shadows, and from my experiences so far I knew that it could mean me only harm. I wasn’t supposed to be here; I was messing with the natural order of things, I couldn’t stay. I had to finish what I came here to do and then leave.  

I pushed myself to my feet, pressing forward through the eerie twilight, the presence near me grew stronger, its influence seeping into every corner of my consciousness. I could feel its tendrils wrapping around my mind, coaxing me with promises of solace and comfort. 

And then, suddenly, it happened. In the midst of the swirling shadows, a shimmering veil of light appeared before me, coalescing into the form of a breathtakingly beautiful scene. Before my eyes I saw the most beautiful meadow, filled with flowers of every colour. Fat bumblebees flew lazily, weaving drunkenly from flower to flower. I saw my lover standing there, whole and healthy, bathed in the warm glow of an unseen sun. My heart leaped with joy at the sight, tears of relief streaming down my cheeks as I reached out to touch him, to feel the warmth of his embrace once more.  I ran to him and he caught me in his strong arms. I kissed every inch of his beautiful face and laughed as he spun me around and around, the meadow blurring into streaks of green. We fell to the grass laughing, giddy with the joy of being together. I pressed my face into his neck and inhaled deeply, then I froze. He didn’t smell like him... he smelled... wrong. I knew his scent better than anyone’s, that scent was home to me.  

“You’re not him” I whispered and as I did, he began to fade a little, his outline becoming blurred, his body less firm under my touch.  

"No!" I cried, my voice choked with emotion. "Please, don't go!" But the vision of my lover remained silent, his expression frozen in a hauntingly serene smile. And then, with a heart-wrenching cry, he vanished into the ether, leaving me alone in the darkness once more. 

In that moment, I knew the truth. This place had woven a spell of false hope, luring me into its trap with the promise of a happiness that could never be. And as beautiful as the dream was, I couldn’t stay in it because it wasn’t real, no matter how much I wished it were. I wouldn’t settle for some imitation of him. I wanted the real him, his smile, his smell, his bad and his good. Nothing more or less would do.  

I walked down the beach, tears blurring my vision and I came upon a twilit cove. Under the cloak of night, the cove glimmered with a spectral light, the water casting eerie shadows that danced along the shoreline. The ethereal glow of the moon softly illuminated the beach in a silvery hue that seemed to emanate from the very sand itself. The black sky above was now a canvas of sparkling stars, while the surface of the ocean was a vast expanse of liquid darkness that seemed to swallow that glittering sky whole. The sound of the ocean in the stillness of the night was a whisper, a haunting melody, beckoning me to the water's edge. As I gazed out at the horizon, the line between sky and sea blurred into obscurity, leaving me feeling adrift in a dreamscape of shimmering light and shadow.  

At the water's edge, Death finally appeared to me, a towering, spectral figure cloaked in darkness, wielding a scythe made of pure shadow. Guardian of the threshold between the realms of the living and the dead, its job to ensure that none would pass without facing its judgment. His eyes gleamed like polished obsidian, reflecting the light of the stars with an eerie intensity. As I approached, I felt the weight of my own soul being scrutinised by Death's penetrating gaze. The Reaper stood at the water's edge, scythe poised against the sand, waiting patiently for me to reach him.  

I stood beside him, my bare feet soothed by the warmth of the ocean. I didn’t need to speak. He knew why I’d come. In this silver, glittering land, there was a peace to be found, but I didn’t care. I had come to take what I saw as mine.  

“You owe me a life,” he said without judgement or malice.  

“No, I don’t.” 

“Then you owe me a death.” 

“I owe you nothing.”   

“People die every day,” he shrugged a little at this and I felt my anger rise.  

“He’s worth fifty of those people” 

“Hmmm.”  

“Take me instead.” It was a desperate plea but not one I made lightly. I would happily give my life if it meant he could live. I knew that the second I’d found out he was ill. I’d known through my whole journey what I was prepared to offer.  

“That’s not a fair trade if he’s worth fifty of anyone else.” He smiled faintly. I was angry at myself for walking into a trap that I’d set but then I analysed his words again and realised there was hope yet. 

“But… you would trade though? If the trade were fair I mean.”   

“I would?” he turned to me for the first time. He was handsome. His jaw chiselled and strong, a kind look in his soft brown eyes.  

“Well that’s what I’m asking you, would you?” 

“Would I what?” I tutted in frustration.  

“You know what I’m asking.” I was losing patience with this stupid game.  

“I do, but if you’re really proposing this awful thing, you must ask for it. I know what you’re asking, yes, but do you?” 

“Would you accept a trade of fifty souls for his?” 

“It’s not really a trade as all souls fall to me eventually, it’s just a matter of when really. It doesn’t much matter to me.”   

“It matters to me!” I was infuriated again, if he didn’t care when people died, why couldn’t he just leave this one person! If it mattered so little to him, what was the harm!? 

“I know,” he sighed then, his handsome brow creasing a little.  

“But if it matters to you so little and to me so much, why take him now? Why not let him stay longer?” 

“There are ways of things. Ways that even I cannot change. You’ve already upset things with your refusal to let him go. The balance is off. It must be righted.” 

“If it’s just about balance then why not just take a different life? Mine for his? Anyone’s for his? Like for like.” 

“Because it’s not like for like. Your soul is tarnished now. And even then, it can’t be like for like. You are asking for something terrible. There must be a cost. You already assigned the cost so if you really wish for this, you must pay it.”  

“What must I do? Must I…I take the lives myself?” 

“No,” he chuckled, “nothing so tawdry as that. There’s power in words, desperate ones like this, in the tales we tell, the stories we share.”  

“I…I don’t understand what you mean.” 

“Tell the story of what happened here. Of your love. Of the forest and the ocean. Of what you have done. Spread the word to everybody you can. From those that hear, I’ll choose who will pay your debt.” Spread...spread...spread....body...body...body 

“How will you choose? Will you take good people? Or bad people?” 

“Why are you asking this, Alice? Would my answer stop you? Would it change your mind?” 

“No, I suppose it wouldn’t.” 

“Then why burden yourself with the details?” 

I nodded agreement then hesitated a little. “You won’t... you won’t take children, will you?”  

He smiled but said nothing.   

“You won’t,” I reassured myself.   

“It’s time to go now, little one, for you can’t stay here. Shake my hand to say the bargain is struck.” He stretched out his hand towards mine and I hesitated once again. “You can change your mind, you know.” 

I reached out and clasped his hand in mine. I felt the same sensations of coming here but oddly reversed. I was being pushed this time, I was taking flight. 

And so I was back in my room, back on my bed and back with him. I couldn’t tell anyone I loved what had happened because Death said he would take souls from those who heard my tale. I told a man at the bus stop and he dropped dead before my eyes. I told a woman in the shops and the same thing happened. Now I’m posting here to spread the story to more people and get the souls I need. I don’t feel good about it. I’m sorry to anyone who reads this, I really am. But you might not be chosen. And even if you are, trust me when I say that you’re doing something very worthwhile. He’s a good man. He doesn’t deserve what has happened to him. But I’m sure you don’t give a fuck about any of that so all I can really say is... I’m sorry, I guess, as inadequate as that is. I am. I really am.
