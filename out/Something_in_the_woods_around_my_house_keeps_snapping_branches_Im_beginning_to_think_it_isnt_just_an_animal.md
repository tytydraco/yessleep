**8:00 AM:**

Alright. Well, this is it. I figured that for this post I would update as frequently as possible throughout the day. That way if I die horribly there will be at least -some- information here to tell you guys how it might have happened.

Jay just finished showing off some fancy black armor he plans to wear for his "hunt". It's special somehow, so special that he only has one set. Fuck me I guess. I helped Jay bury a bunch of weird shit in my back yard. The stuff that's apparently supposed to trap that thing.

After reading a few comments on my previous post, I figured I'd head into town to -try- to get some more information on all this. Amazingly, Jay agreed with me in this line of thought, but it seems that if I don't make it back home in time he's going to carry out his plan without me. If there really is something we're missing, I have to know for sure.

**10:36 AM:**

I've been going around town, asking people as casually as possible about anything unusual they might've seen or heard in the woods. I'm trying to word this as carefully as possible so people don't start thinking I'm a bigger lunatic than I already am.

Frustratingly, nobody seems to know much of anything, that or they're pretending they don't. I did get roped into an old mans painfully long story about how he saw a bear hit itself in the nuts with a tree branch though.

A commenter of my previous post mentioned that woman I met, the grocery store employee who gave me that weird look. I went to see her again but she apparently isn't working today. So... I guess that's out of the question for now unless I happen upon her somewhere else. Might as well look.

**11:53 AM:**

I found her, I actually found her! She was out in the town park, feeding some birds. Practically fell on my face sprinting up to her. She seemed very surprised to see me at first, but her attitude brightened up considerably after the initial shock of my speedy arrival.

She's agreed to speak with me about my problem. It seems that she -does- know something after all. Unfortunately she asked me to come somewhere more private before she tells me anything... which is probably a bad idea... but I'm an idiot I guess because I'm about to follow her. Will update if unmurdered.

&#x200B;

**2:33 PM:**

Well she certainly had a lot to tell me. I'm sitting in my car attempting to process it all now... but I'll write down how our conversation went below. Still have plenty of time to make it back home before the spirit shows up anyway.

Upon following the old woman, who I'd learned to call Ms. Pembroke, we arrived at a cozy little house about five or six minutes away from the park I'd found her in. Walking inside, she lead me to the living room. Had that classic old person smell. She gestured for me to sit down on her overly-cushioned couch, then left the room to get me a glass of lemonade. I took a glance out the window to see that her back yard bordered those woods just like mine.

The place looked average enough. A lot of d√©cor featuring nature and the woods, winding root patterns on the wallpaper. Ms. Pembroke owned this little chihuahua that had invited itself into my lap, which I'd been petting when she returned.

***"Well it seems like you and Barnabas are getting along just fine."*** She said cheerfully, handing me the lemonade. Barnabas? What kind of name was that for a dog, I thought.

***"...He kind of just invited himself up here."*** I said, looking over to her. Truth be told, I did like animals a lot more than people. ***"So.. you have something to tell me, right?"*** I asked, attempting to steer the conversation to the reason I was there in the first place.

***"Oh, yes, I do."*** she nodded several times. Her voice had grown a bit more serious. ***"..Before all that, though, I'm sorry about how our first encounter went... I wanted to ask if you'd seen or heard anything, but I figured if I said all that you would have just thought I was crazy..."*** she trails off briefly. ***"By the time I'd worked up the courage you already left."***

I opened my mouth to say something, then shut it again. I mean.. the sounds I'd been hearing at the time were unusual but I guess if she'd told me it was the work of some sort of nature... spirit forest guardian thingy I probably -would- have thought she was nuts. Finally I managed to speak.

***"...Maybe... but I don't think you're crazy now. I just want to know what it is. You know, don't you?"*** I asked, still petting her dog. She gave me stern look, but nodded.

***"Long time ago, back when I was a little girl, I lived in a little house close to where you live now, and I heard those noises just like you."*** She pointed my way, then took a sip from her own glass, clearing her throat a bit afterwards.

***"You probably asked others about her, right? None of them know. I think she usually only ever shows herself to special people, like us."*** She grinned, though the grin faded. ***"People who need her. I know I certainly did."***

I remained quiet, unsure of what to say. She? I'd guessed Ms. Pembroke was referring to the spirit. Had it been true? This thing was showing itself to me because I needed it?... I mean. I guess in a way it did save me.. She began to say more, breaking me from my thoughts.

***"My old man was... well, he wasn't a very good father. When my mother died I think whatever was holding him together died with her.."*** She said, her gaze growing foggy and distant as she reminisced.

***"He'd often come home after drinking one too many beers and take out that pent up anger on me, the only one he had... I won't go into detail about that but I'm sure you don't mind."*** She said. All I could do was nod my head in agreement.

***"The neighbors, I think they knew. But they didn't do a damn thing about it. Was too much of an inconvenience on their lives to acknowledge."*** she said a venom that I had never thought I'd hear from someone who looked as kindly as she did. She paused, looking to me after the anger cleared from her face. ***"..Sorry, don't mean to get worked up."***

I shook my head, holding a hand up in dismissal. ***"No, no, it's fine.. I get what you mean.. uh.. I kinda have my own issues with people.."*** I trailed off. Didn't want to derail the point of this conversation with personal shit. ***"...But that thing, it saved you?"***

She nodded, the twinkle once again appearing in her eyes. ***"Yes. -She- did.. Was during a particularly bad night when I realized that if I didn't do something, this time he was gonna kill me. I waited for an opening, and that was when I ran. Out through the front door and into the woods."*** She gestured toward the ever present wall of trees that surrounded this town on all sides.

Well, it certainly seemed like Ms. Pembroke didn't care for me having called the spirit 'that thing' all that much.

***"...I guess in a way I'm glad he drank so much, wouldn't have been able to get away otherwise. Of course he chased me, stumbling his way right behind me through the dark. I'd known there was something out in these woods when I'd run. But what other choice did I have? My father had heard those strange sounds many times before, as well, but I think he was too drunk to care."*** She let out a sigh.

I found myself listening all too intently as she told me her story.

***"That was when I saw her, standing out in a small clearing, alone. She was bathed in moonlight. Looked like the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I was so transfixed by the sight that my dad caught up to me, making us both topple over after he'd crashed right into me."*** She said with a nod, her eyes getting noticeably wet.

After waiting for me to interject if I wanted, she continued when I said nothing.

***"Dad didn't even see her. Hell, I don't think he could even see me that well. He began to choke the life right out of me. I fought with all my might but it was about as pointless as attacking a lion with a spoon."*** She took a shaky breath.

***"But right when I was fading, he let go.. She made him let go. She saved me from that vile man and made it so I'd never have to fear him again."*** She said with growing strength in her tone.

***"The town chalked it up to some sort of freak bear attack, but I know the truth, and so do you.. She isn't some sort of monster. She's a guardian! This land needs her as much as I did that very night."***

Ms. Pembroke finally finished, folding her hands in her lap. I'd long since stopped petting her dog, now only sitting there in silence. Well, shit... I guess I had to tell Jay the plan's off. Of course, I didn't share with Ms. Pembroke that I hired someone to dispatch the guardian of the fucking forest. She'd have a heart attack or something.

***"..Well, it's been giving me these horrible headaches. Did you have those too?"*** I asked.

She nodded! ***"Oh, yes, quite a bit at first. But after that night they went away.. I think the headaches are how she communicates with us. They point us to what we need to do, so that she can help us."***

After our more serious talk had wrapped itself up, I stuck around for a little while longer. Made some small talk as best I could... but living as a loner for so long really did make me shit at keeping conversation going. I'd been about to see myself out when she offered I come by to chat again some time. I guess she -was- the only one who could relate to me about all this. Maybe I will.

But now, I guess I'll head home. Gotta tell Jay the plan's off.

&#x200B;

**7:00 AM, the following day:**

It's all gone to shit. God damn it, everything is fucked. There's nothing I can do anymore, not one thing. I'm sitting in my living room and the only thing I can do is type out all this shit.

I got home at around 3:50 PM yesterday, after my talk with Ms. Pembroke.

Jay was chilling on my couch. He'd apparently helped himself to my movies and was watching the one about the giant ants. He looked up, flashing me a grin. ***"You got some good stuff here man. Most of the movies are kinda garbage, but they're funny."***

***"..Yeah, I know."*** I sighed. Did he not know what a B movie was? ***"Can we talk? I learned a few things in town."*** I had asked after walking over to stand beside the TV.

Jay looked from me, to the TV, then back to me. ***"Yeeeah, I guess so."*** He tapped the pause button on the remote and got up from the couch, following me into the kitchen.

After we both sat down, I told Jay about all the things I'd learned from Ms. Pembroke. About how the thing in the forest saved her life, and about how killing it was probably a bad idea. The entire time Jay listened without word, not even to throw in one of those stupid remarks of his.

***"...Well shit. I guess I came all this way for nothing, huh."*** he said in a bummed out tone.

***"Uh.. yeah, sorry.... I'll still pay you though, don't worry."***

He brightened up, flashing me a grin! ***"You're the man, mind if you help me out with packing up my stuff?"***

I nodded. Guess it was the least I could do for what amounted as two days of his time being wasted. I turned to walk out of the room.

That was when he hit me. One moment I was headed through the doorway, and the next he'd fucking hit me in the back of the head. To make matters worse I slammed into the fridge afterward. Specifically my face. Everything faded to black.

For the next several hours I sort of slipped in and out of consciousness. I felt weak, unable to move. I had the vague feeling that I was sitting somewhere, and my arms were numb. Finally after what felt like forever I came to.

I was in my entranceway, with my hands over my head. I had been tied to doorknob of the front door. Groggily, I looked around. From what I could see of the windows, it was dark outside. How much time had passed? Jay got my attention from the living room to the right. He'd just been sitting in the armchair, watching TV.

***"Oh, you're awake. Cool, was worried I might've killed you for a bit there."*** he so casually said. Was this guy for real? Even in my dazed state I was beginning to feel the telltale signs of burning rage.

***"...Why.. why the fuck did you do that?.."*** I asked him, my voice was hoarse.

***"Because I still have a job to do. Can't do that if you're trying to stop me can I?"*** He said to me, as if he were lecturing a child.

***"...I said I'd pay you anyway..."*** I groaned. ***"..Fucking untie me!"***

***"Right, I know what you said. But look. Some things aren't about money. I'm in this business for my own personal reasons. Getting paid to do it is just a plus. This is -mankinds- world, don't you get it? Letting all this unnatural shit walk around... It just leads to problems."***  He stood up from the chair and walked over, looking down at me.

How many head injuries would I have to sustain in one week? I struggled with my back against the heavy wooden door, but it was useless. I turned my eyes up toward Jay.

***"Jeez, man. I even bandaged your wound."*** he taps his own forehead, mirroring the place I'd felt gauze wrapping around my own head. ***"So drop the death glare."***

***"The wound YOU fucking gave me!"*** I spat.

***"Yeah yeah. Look, I'm not gonna leave you like this forever. Just until my job is done, alright? You don't even have to pay me anymore."*** He said, turning toward the kitchen. ***"I'm gonna coax that thing out here soon, so I've got to gear up. Don't try anything alright? I don't wanna be forced to kill you."***

Then he left me, tied to my own front door, in my own goddamn house. This was pathetic, I thought. After sitting in silence for a few minutes I strained my neck hard to find the clock in the living room, seeing it read 9:00 PM. I'd been out of it for five hours or so.

In the kitchen, I heard Jay rummaging around for about thirty minutes before finally exiting. He'd put on that armor he showed me that morning. Across his chest he had a pistol holstered, and in his right hand he held a large, silver axe. He turned toward the hall that lead to the back door.

***"Stop! You don't know what killing it will even do! What if it just makes everything worse?"*** I yelled at him, but he paid me practically no mind at all.

***"Wish me luck."*** was all he offered me from down the hall, before I heard the door open, and shut.

As soon as he left, I rose to my feet and began to struggle frantically against my bindings. I couldn't just let this happen. As far as I knew, the forest would die with this spirit if Jay's plan succeeded. I pulled and pulled, but the doorknob was anchored heavily into the wood. Funny, considering I'd once taken great comfort in how sturdy these doors were made. I'd only managed to turn myself into a sweating mess when I finally gave up for the time being, slumping to the floor again.

**SNAP**

Off in the woods came that all too familiar sound. Jay must have hit the tree with the axe, I thought. My head was beginning to hurt... and not from the injury. The headaches were coming. They really did mean something.

**CRACK**

Much closer now, the spirit was closing in much faster than it ever had. My struggling had renewed. I pulled. I pulled until it felt like my arms were going to break off.

**SNAP**

This couldn't happen, I wouldn't allow it! The headaches were beginning to blur my vision they were so intense. I shut my eyes tight and pulled. I pulled and pulled and pulled until- **SNAP**

But this noise didn't come from outside. It was the sound of the heavy duty rope breaking at the point it had been tied around the doorknob. I almost faceplanted it was so unexpected. Quickly, I stepped over the rope that bound my hands, one foot at a time, until my arms were in front of me.

**SNAP**

I heard it again. It was just outside of my back yard! I stumbled into the living room, moving to the brick fireplace against the far wall. There I started rubbing the rope against the corner of the bricks to cut through them. It took about a minute to saw through, but it felt like an eternity.

I had finally freed myself! Turning toward the hall, I sprinted for my room! My rifle was hanging up on the wall once again. As fast as I had ever felt I moved before, I took it down, pulled my box of ammo from my shelf, and began loading the magazine.

**SNAP**

It was in my back yard! Behind me, light blasted through my bedroom window, illuminating the walls in front of me. Jay's trap had been sprung. I barreled out of the room, gun in hand. After barging through the back door I was met with the sight of my lawn, bathed in light cast by powerful mounted spotlights. Since I'd not been able to perform my part of Jay's plan, it had seemed he'd acquired the gear to do it himself.

Jay stood next to the large tree that now had his silver axe buried in its side. About fifteen feet to his right sat a strange, glowing cage that seemed to sprout up from the ground. Inside the cage stood the spirit. He'd actually caught it! It looked as majestic as ever and I felt myself admiring its beauty even then. It stood still in its makeshift prison as it eyed its captor.

I raised my rifle, aiming it square at Jay. ***"STOP!"*** I yelled at him, causing him to whirl around in surprise.

He blinked against the harsh light, shielding his eyes with a hand. ***"God damn it, I told you not to try anything!"*** He yelled back.

***"Please, just don't move, or I'll-.... I'll shoot you!"*** I replied.

Jay only laughed at my threat. ***"Look, the armor I'm wearing isn't standard fucking tactical gear. You aren't gonna hurt me with that thing, so your little rescue attempt here means jack shit!"***

I didn't know whether he was going to try to shoot me or the spirit first. But I couldn't just stand there and let it happen, regardless of how pointless it was. When I saw his hand go for his gun, I fired mine.

To my shock, I was practically thrown off my feet by the shot. I heard a loud explosion. Jay cried out in surprise as I witnessed him being violently thrown against the tree he stood next to. Glowing, glasslike material shattered in all directions around his body, and then the armor he'd been wearing fell apart as well. It was the bullet, the cursed magical bullshit one he gave me initially. It had still been in my gun this whole time, I realized! We'd both obviously forgotten about it, and now for better or  worse it had been used.

Jay groaned in pain. One of his arms looked broken, and he was bleeding from a dozen small cuts on his body. ***"...You fucking dick.."*** He sputtered at me in a half-dazed state.

I turned, looking to the cage that held the spirit. It stood there, completely still. Its glimmering eyes were now fixed on me. I'd done it! My head felt like it was going to explode into bits but I had done it! I just had to get it out of there. Didn't know what I was going to do about Jay, but that didn't matter at the moment. I moved toward it, intent on digging the stuff out of the ground that had been supplying the strange cage with whatever magic nonsense it used for fuel.

**SNAP**

I paused, my eyes were drawn back up to the spirit. It was... twitching, a bit. Its antlers began to bend, producing that slow, creaking noise before violently jerking to form different, sharp angles.

**CRACK**

My headache grew. My vision began to swim, like the world around me was some sort of abstract painting. The form of the spirit had begun to blur as well, shifting and swirling around.

Simultaneously, the cage of light exploded. This spirit... No, this THING had never been trapped at all, I realized all too late. All of this happened because it had -wanted- it to happen. I had brought my hand up to shield my eyes against the shattering cage of light, and when I lowered it again... I saw it.

For the worst two or three seconds of my life I saw it, what it REALLY was.

This thing wasn't some guardian. I knew that now. There's absolutely no way. The story Ms. Pembroke told me. How much of that had she just LIED about?

It still held the vague shape of an elk, but it wasn't made of fucking moss and branches. This thing was made of bloody, broken bodies. They were all so... tangled together, twisted into this blatant mockery of an elk. You couldn't tell where one ended and another began.

It had taken the remains of that burglar I buried out in the woods. It had taken them and just... added them to itself. Stretched across its misshapen head had been his torn and rotten face. What appeared as branches sticking out of its body before had actually been numerous fractured bones. Bones of all sorts just melded together.

Hanging from its sides and neck like fleshy tendrils were a multitude of intestines, intertwined with frayed and mangled flesh. Its antlers were made almost entirely of bone, guts tangled throughout their branchlike patterns. Many of these branches ended in skeletal hands with more fingers than any human hand should have.

But despite all of that, the worst thing about it were those eyes. From behind that mask of agonized flesh it wore I could see numerous tiny black orbs. They were each a tiny void, reflecting none of the bright light that it was bathed in... and they were all fixed on me, full of a sickening, ancient intelligence I can't even begin to describe.

All of that was burned into my brain in the span of those two seconds, and then the lights turned off. The back yard was plunged into absolute darkness as all of Jay's lights failed simultaneously. My headache made it so I could barely even function. My thoughts were a panicked mess.

**SNAP**

Blindly, I stumbled back away from the sound, but found myself colliding with a tree. A tree that hadn't been there before. I was losing my mind. Frantically, I moved to the left only to find another tree, and another, and another! My eyes began to adjust to the low level of light cast by the moon. I was standing in what looked like a corridor, made entirely of those gnarled forest trees.

**SNAP**

At the end, that thing was standing there, now just a barely visible dark mass in the night. I had no way out. Behind me... just more trees. It began to run... no.. No living thing ran like that. The joints in those four long legs all bent at wrong angles as it staggered right toward with more speed than I'd thought possible. With all my remaining willpower, I forced myself to raise my rifle and fired another shot.

The rifle blast echoed through the forest. I couldn't think anymore with my head pounding like this. My vision was a tornado of vague shapes and colors. But all of a sudden, the lights were on again. Now that I'm writing this in retrospect, had they ever even turned off in the first place?

I hadn't shot it. I don't even think I'd aimed at it. It was Jay, I'd fucking killed Jay.

Slumped against the tree was his now lifeless body. A chunk of his head was missing, from where my shot had landed. I collapsed to my knees. It was all too much. It wasn't my fault, I had just been trying to help! This wasn't real, none of this was real. I desperately lied to myself.

That thing was still standing right where it had been when the cage broke, looking down at me. Then it walked over to the tree, moving in a jerking, yet also sickeningly fluid way. Like a mannequin that had come to life and decided to dance.

**SNAP**

It stood still before Jay's corpse for just a moment, but then began bending its disgusting fleshy neck down toward him. Its jagged, broken spine tore through its body a bit as it did so, cracking and popping loudly. With its many branching 'hands' it plucked up Jay's corpse, holding him aloft by the wrists. Another hand was used to rip the axe from the tree, and it was hurled off into the forest with impossible strength.

It began to... disembowel him. Its many other hands just started tearing into his torso, scooping out handfuls of flesh and organs rapidly. At this point I was just throwing up on the grass, watching it. I couldn't move, my legs had long since failed me.

**SNAP**

The thing proceeded to smear some of Jay's insides across the part of the tree that the axe had left a mark in... and the tree soaked it in. It was healing the tree, I realized. Healing it with blood and guts and death.

It dropped Jay's remains with all the care of someone dropping a rock into a pond, then began to walk to me. This was it, I thought. I would be the next thing it tore to pieces.

But that didn't happen. It did something else.

Swiftly reaching down, it grasped me firmly with its many skeletal hands. It's grip was like iron. Escape was impossible.

I felt myself being lifted from the ground, held in front of its disgusting face. It held my eyes open as it looked into them. I could feel its putrid, rotten presence flowing over me, down into every fiber of my being. I couldn't even feel the headache anymore, it had become this... indescribable pressure in my skull.

It began to smear Jay's blood all over me with a few of its other hands. My body attempted to throw up but nothing came from it. I'd long since emptied the contents of my stomach.

It just held me there like that, staring into my eyes for... I don't know for how long.  Rational thought had vacated my mind at some point. I slipped out of consciousness.

When I woke up, it was early morning. I was covered in dried blood. I sat up to see half of Jay's remains decorating the tree. And just like after it had killed the robber, the tree had grown even larger... His other half is.. I don't fucking know where it is. I don't want to know. In a daze, I walked to my house, entering through the back door.

I'm sitting in my living room, just like I said at the start of all this. Looking through the front window I can see that there are trees growing where my driveway once was. It's like it had never even been there. Just dense forest. I don't know if they're real or just another illusion that thing put into my head. But I don't think that matters. It has me all the same. I can feel it inside my skull now, like my thoughts aren't just my own. Running is pointless.

Fuck this. There -is- something I can do. I'm not letting it have me. I refuse. I have my rifle with me.

The next shot it fires is going to be the one that blows my brains out.

Mom, Dad, I just wish I could've seen you again.

&#x200B;

**8:36 AM:**

I can't die.

I am bound to her now, for all time. Bound by Jay's spilt blood. But this isn't a bad thing.

During my brief sleep of death, I dreamt of the world she wants. A beautiful world where those towering trees cover everything in their protecting shade. She chose me to help her. -ME-. Don't you see? I'm part of something much bigger now. All other troubles and desires I've experienced in my life seem so pathetic, so -pointless- by comparison.

There are others like me. Like Ms. Pembroke. The chosen few, with who she shares her power. I feel strong. My headaches are gone and my mind is more focused than it has ever been before.

For once in my life, I actually know what I'm doing with it. My goals are clear.

I am her friend.

To all of you who read this. You could be her friend too, if you're lucky. If you just let me show you.

I don't think I mind being around other people all that much, anymore.

I'm going to give my parents a call. They can come visit us here.

It's been so long since we last saw each other.
