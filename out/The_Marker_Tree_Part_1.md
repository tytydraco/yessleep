Have you ever told someone a story and while you were explaining it you realized it was completely unbelievable? That halfway through telling it your voice softens and trails off as you consider what you're saying? Have you ever had to preface your stories? Like, "Guys, I swear this happened."

I don't think I expect you to believe this, but regardless it's something I feel I should write down. But make no mistake, it's true. I thought for a while that I could convince you by making mention of names and places but I realize now that would only make someone go investigate. I don't think investigation is beneficial to anyone here. This story isn't the kind you test. If someone tells you, "Hey! That pan is hot," you're not going to test it? You believe them. It's a warning. That's what this is. A warning.

It was 1991, September. Northern U.S. The air was thin, hinting at a cold front, though it was still a couple weeks off. I was going to pick up my friends, driving my dad’s old work truck, an ’80 F-150 extended cab. It was cramped, but the bench seats made it feel a little roomier. The plan was to head out to Eagle’s Rest, a wildlife management area not far from home. It was part of the reservation, and camping or fishing wasn’t allowed past a certain “exclusion zone.” As kids, we’d grown up hearing stories about that place, the kind told around bonfires or whispered on bus rides. The locals said the woods were sick, that the land was bad. Even the Natives avoided it like it carried a disease. Before we all split up for college, we wanted to see it for ourselves, to see what was really down in Eagle’s Rest. That was it.

I pulled into the dirt driveway of a cluttered yard. A garden of trash dotted the front of the trailer home. Before I could even reach for the horn, the door swung open. Out walked Eli, button-down shirt tucked into his jeans, boots scuffed, a bag in one hand, and a single feather tied in his hair. He had a little twine pouch in his other hand, rolling it between his fingers like he didn’t know what else to do with it. I knew before he even reached the truck he’d have something to say.

“Don’t say shit,” Eli snapped, slamming the door and taking the front seat.

“I didn’t know we were going to church too,” I said smiling.

“You know my parents. God, let’s just pick up Matt and get this over with.”

I could see him turning red. Matt was absolutely going to say something, and Eli knew it. Hopefully he brought something other than a button-down for the long weekend ahead. I put the truck in reverse and backed out of the driveway, gravel popping under the tires. The road north toward Eagle’s Rest was long and empty, the kind that lets silence stretch until somebody has to fill it. Which Matt certainly would do.

The truck rattled like an empty can as we hit the county road. The sky was brightening as the sun rose, but that late-September color made everything look thinner, sharper. Eli rolled down his window halfway, enough for the wind to whip his hair around and tug at the feather. He didn’t take it out, though. Just kept one hand on the pouch in his lap and the other draped out the window.

“Your folks know where you’re going?” I asked.

He turned to me deadpan like he was going to call me stupid. “They think I'm going to California." he said, then snorted. "Of course they don’t know where I’m going!"

“Probably smarter.”

“Probably?” He looked out the window for a long second. “They don’t like that place. My mom used to say bad things happened there. Said the forest remembers.”

I smirked. “What does that even mean?”

“Exactly,” he said. “It’s just old talk. She used to hang that kind of stuff over my head when I was a kid, like a bedtime story. ‘Don’t wander too far, the forest will hear you.’ That kind of thing.”

We drove in silence a bit. The drive was rough and the tires popped against the loose rocks in the road. I remember the way the trees leaned in, their leaves already tinged with yellow, and how the shadows seemed to spread just a little faster than they should have that time of year. The smell of cigarettes started to permeate the cabin and I could tell from where.

“Hey,” I said, “what’s in the pouch?”

Eli hesitated, then stuffed it into his jacket pocket. “Nothing.”

“Didn’t look like nothing. Are you gonna be smoking? Is this a 'what makes the Redman red' moment?”

"Says the guy whose idea of culture is Budweiser and a Metallica tape," Eli said flatly.

"Hey, that's American culture."

He turned his head toward me, the wind flattening his voice. “My mom makes these. She calls them protection charms. I told her I didn’t want it, but she put it in my bag anyway. Smells like cedar and tobacco. Keeps away spirits or something.”

I grinned. “Well, maybe it’ll protect us from Matt’s talking.” That got a small laugh out of him, the first one since I’d pulled up to his house. The rest of the drive we didn’t say much. Just the low hum of the old engine, the hiss of wind through the cracked window, and that faint smell of cold. When we turned down Matt's road, the morning sun was climbing higher, washing the clouds pale. The sky looked thin, almost bleached. Then I saw Matt’s house up ahead, a half-collapsed barn, a rusted swing set, and smoke curling from a burn barrel.

Eli sighed. “Here we go,” he said. “Brace for impact.”

Matt was a stout kid, strong, and already had facial hair like a gorilla. His dad worked as a game warden up here, so he came loaded, camping gear, coolers, tarps, and some long, slender bag that seemed to be giving him trouble.

“Well, at least someone’s prepared,” I said, looking between Eli’s small pack and the pile of gear Matt was muscling into the truck bed. We’d already planned for him to bring most of the stuff, but that didn’t stop me from shooting another jab at Eli’s cowboy-casual. The suspension groaned as Matt threw the last pack in and climbed into the front seat.

“The whole back seat’s empty,” Eli said, turning toward him.

“Yeah, but you’re not back there,” Matt shot back, grinning.

I started laughing. The sound filled the cab and spilled into the quiet outside, echoing just a little before the woods swallowed it again. The truck felt heavier with Matt in it. His gear rattled in the bed, and every bump made something metallic clink.

“So what’s in the mystery tube?” I asked, nodding toward the long bag.

“.30-06,” Matt said. “Dad’s old hunting rifle. You never know what’s out there.”

“Thought we were camping, not hunting,” Eli said.

“Same thing, basically.” Matt leaned back in his seat, grinning like he’d just won an argument. “You ever tracked a deer, Eli?”

“Can’t say I’ve had the pleasure.”

“You can tell a lot from tracks. The way the dirt’s kicked up, how deep it is. Even the smell. My old man says the woods tell on themselves if you listen.”

“Yeah?” I said, “The woods talk to you a lot? That might be like, a medical condition.”

“You joke,” Matt said, “but that’s how you know when something’s off. Animals’ll move wrong before people notice anything.”

The road curved and the forest rose around us, tall pines blotting out most of the morning light. Eli leaned against the window, quiet. The feather in his hair brushed the glass every time we hit a bump.

“Your mom ever tell you what’s wrong with that place?” Matt asked him after a while.

Eli didn’t turn. “Just that it’s better to stay away. Said the forest remembers what it’s owed.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

Eli shrugged. “I don’t know."

He said it like it was nothing, like it didn’t matter, but I could tell it did. The truck fell quiet again, and for the first time that morning, I noticed how thick the trees had gotten on either side of the road. Pines pressing close, crowding the light. It was like we were in a crowd of people.

The road unrolled in front of us, mile after mile of pine and nothing else. We passed a single mailbox half-swallowed by weeds, then nothing for a long while. The air outside grew heavier, the sky fading from bright blue to that pale gray. Every so often, the tires hit ruts that would spit up against the undercarriage, the sound sharp in the quiet.

“We’re close,” Matt said, through the silence.

The road had turned to gravel a few miles back, narrow enough that branches scraped the mirrors. The light coming through the pines was patchy, bright where it broke through but leaving deep shadows between the trunks.

Matt leaned forward, twisting the radio knob until static turned into something recognizable; Alabama, *Dixieland Delight*. The tape hissed, warped a little, but it was better than silence.

“Finally,” Matt said. “Something that isn’t Eli’s depressing crap.”

Eli rolled his eyes. I laughed. The song came through thin and uneven, lyrics fading in and out: "*Rollin' down a backwoods, Tennessee byway, one arm on the wheel...*"

I kept one hand on the wheel, the other adjusting the tuner. The signal wavered, crackling with bursts of static. For a second I thought I heard someone else under the music but it was probably just interference.

Eli was quiet, staring out the window. The trees were so close now you could’ve reached out and touched them.

I leaned down, trying to steady the dial.

That’s when Matt yelled.

“Deer!”

I jerked the wheel right. Tires skidded. The truck fishtailed, then slammed to a stop pointing sideways on the shoulder, throwing dust over the hood. The dirt hung in the air, bitter in the back of my throat.

Nobody spoke for a moment. The radio was still hissing with static, but the music had fallen away. The singer sounded muffled, distant like he was singing through a wall.

Matt cursed under his breath. “Jesus Christ. Where the hell did it go?”

I didn’t answer. I was staring at the radio. The song was still running, but there was no rhythm anymore just fragments of words tangled in the static.

*“A sweet, soft, southern thrill,”*

That wasn’t the same singer was it? 

Then something banged the dashboard - Eli’s fist - and the radio snapped back to life, the song bursting loud and clear.

*“WITH MY DIXIELAND DELIGHT-”*

I turned the knob off.

Silence dropped like a blanket with a click of the volume knob.

No wind. No birds. Not even the engine ticking. Just us breathing, hard.

“Do you see it?” I asked.

Matt shook his head. “It ran back that way.”

Eli said nothing. He was looking out his window, his hand on that little pouch again, eyes fixed on the tree line.

I followed his gaze. The brush was still moving. Slow. Deliberate. Like something was pushing through, the trees and brush separated. Then it stopped.

We waited, listening.

"Big ass deer." Matt said.

Eli and I turned to look at him.

"What?" Matt said nervously.

I put the truck in drive and started forward, slow this time. My hands were still tight on the wheel.

“You sure it’s gone?” Matt said.

“Yeah,” I said. “Let’s just-”

“Stop! Jesus, stop!”

I hit the brakes again. Dust rolled forward over the hood like smoke.

“What now?”

Matt was pointing through the windshield.

When the dust thinned, a shape stood on the shoulder, thin frame, oversized ranger jacket, big round glasses catching the light. The air around her looked gray and heavy with dust, like even the forest was holding still.

“Holy shit,” Matt said under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“You remember, the ranger’s kid? Her dad went missing up here looking for that boy from Cherokee Falls. It's her.”

I looked back at her. She was younger than I remembered, probably our age, but the glasses made her eyes look wide and strange. She lifted a hand halfway, not a wave exactly, more like a test to see if we were real.

I rolled down the window. "You okay?"

"Yeah. I was over here and heard you brake hard, thought maybe you hit something." She said.

"We're fine. What are you doing out here?"

She glanced toward the tree line. "Looking for something." A pause. Her boots were covered in mud, darker than the road dust. She’d been walking a while. "You're headed to Eagle's Rest?"

None of us answered right away. The radio sat dead on the dash, the last words of that song still hanging in my head.

She took a step closer to the truck, peering through the passenger window. Her glasses caught the light again, big and round, eyes behind them huge.

"Eli Whitebird?" she said.

Eli blinked. "Yeah?"

"Thought so. You used to ride my bus, right?"

He hesitated, trying to place her. "Katy…?"

She smiled a little. "Kellenhall. Good memory."

Eli didn't answer. I could tell he remembered the story. Everyone did.

She looked past him, at me. "You are heading to Eagle's Rest, aren't you?"

I nodded before I could think better of it. "Yeah."

"You know it's restricted?"

"We know."

She was quiet for a second, then: "My dad went in there two years ago. Looking for a kid from Cherokee Falls who got lost. He never came out."

The air in the cab got heavier. Matt shifted in his seat.

"I'm sorry," Eli said quietly.

She shook her head, like she'd heard it before and it didn't help. "I'm leaving for college at the end of the summer. This is my last chance to look for him. Or at least... see where he went."

"On foot?" I asked.

"If I have to."

Matt leaned forward. "That's insane. You can't just walk into Eagle's Rest alone."

"Why not?" She looked at him straight on. "You three are."

Nobody had an answer for that.

"Look," she said, "you need to get past the gate. I have a key." She pulled something from her pocket and held it up, an old brass key on a faded green tag. The ranger station logo was almost rubbed off. "And I know where it is. You'll spend an hour looking for it otherwise."

"How'd you get that?" Eli asked.

"My dad's things. He used to patrol the boundary."

Matt looked at me, eyebrows raised, uncertain.

I hesitated. Taking her felt wrong. But leaving her out here alone felt worse.

"It's not really-" I started.

The door handle clicked. She'd already opened the back door and climbed in, setting her pack beside her like it was decided.

"I'll show you where the gate is," she said.

Eli turned back toward me, deadpan. "Guess we're taking her."

Matt looked at me again, lowering his voice. "Dude. She's a *girl*. We're going camping."

"She's also right here," Katy said from the back seat.

I started the truck again. The radio flickered, hissed, then couldn't find a station. Just static. I guess it really hadn't started working until we got on this road anyway. We drove off. The road straightened out after another couple miles, climbing slightly, the trees thinning until the daylight spilled out into open space. For the first time in hours, we could see sky again.

“Slow down,” Katy said. “We’re close.”

I eased off the gas. The gravel rolled under the tires, then went smooth, hard-packed dirt.

The forest ended as if cut with a blade. What lay beyond wasn’t just a clearing, it was a valley. Wide, empty, and dead quiet. In the center of it, like something preserved in amber, stood Eagle’s Rest: a wall of green so dense it looked solid. The trees inside it were taller, darker, and older than the ones we’d driven through, their crowns folding together like a single shape.

Between us and that inner forest was a fence. Not barbed wire or chain link, but a full perimeter wall steel mesh, fifteen, maybe twenty feet high, topped with razor coil that gleamed dull silver in the midday light. It ran in both directions as far as we could see, cutting across the valley like a scar.

“Holy hell,” Matt said. “This looks like a zoo.”

“Or a prison,” Eli muttered.

The wind carried the smell of rain and something older, wet iron, old leaves, the kind of scent that feels like it’s coming from inside the ground.

Katy pointed. “Gate’s over there.”

We followed her hand. A section of the fence bowed inward around a rusted service gate, a single floodlight glowing weakly above it. The beam flickered every few seconds, like it was remembering it was supposed to work.

Posted across the fence, a sign repeated in faded stencil:

EXCLUSION ZONE

EAGLE'S REST WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA

NO ENTRY

I parked a few yards away and killed the engine. The silence that followed was enormous.

Katy got out first, pulling the key from her pocket. In the light, it looked too small to belong to a door that size.

"This is where the boundary starts," she said quietly. "Past the fence, it's all federal land. They said it was contaminated, bad soil, something in the groundwater." She looked at the trees. "But that's not why they fenced it like this."

She slipped the key into the padlock. It turned once, stiffly.

“Then why?” Eli asked.

The latch clicked open. The sound echoed against the fence and came back thinner, delayed.

“Because things started coming out,” she said.

She pushed the gate open, just wide enough for us to walk through. The smell of cold earth and pine poured out like breath from a mouth that hadn’t spoken in years.

“Well,” I said, breaking the quiet, “the truck’s not getting through that gate.” I’d only said what everyone was already thinking. “We’ll have to carry everything from here.”

“Then let’s walk,” Katy said. She’d already slung her pack out of the bed and was adjusting the straps. The decision was made before anyone could argue.

“Let’s walk,” Matt echoed, dragging the cooler down with one hand and the rifle case with the other. His voice had that drawn-out sarcasm that made even agreement sound like complaint.

Eli stayed where he was, eyes on the tree line. The sunlight caught the feather in his hair, barely moving.

“Let’s walk,” he said finally, quieter than the rest, like he wasn’t sure if it was a suggestion or a prayer.

The gate hung half-open, the padlock still dangling from the chain like it hadn’t decided if we belonged inside or out. The sound of our boots seemed to fade as we neared the fence.

Katy went first. She didn’t hesitate, just ducked under the metal frame and slipped through, her hand brushing the cold steel as she passed. For a moment, the light hit her hair and glasses and I could see her eyes, wide, but steady.

Matt followed, rifle slung over one shoulder, cooler strap biting into his other. He grumbled something I didn’t catch, but his pace stayed close behind hers, like he didn’t want her too far ahead.

I came next, hauling what I could. The ground inside the fence looked no different from the grass outside, but it *felt* different. The soil was softer, the air colder. I glanced back once. The truck looked smaller now, like it was already forgetting us.

Eli stood at the threshold a little longer, one hand gripping the post. The feather in his hair barely moved. He looked up at the trees, then down at the dirt, then at us.

“Let’s not stay long,” he said quietly.

Then he stepped through. The gate swung behind him, just enough to creak, then hung there half-open. The chain shifted against the frame, a faint clink, and then nothing.

That was the last sound before the silence closed over us.

We walked in line toward the forest, the valley sloping down like Eagle’s Rest sat at the bottom of a bowl - or a crater. The sun hung high overhead, erasing most of the shadows except for the hard black line where the trees began. No one spoke.

The air grew cooler as we descended, heavy with the smell of wet soil and pine sap. Each step made the grass shorter, rougher, until the ground turned to packed dirt streaked with roots.

As we stepped beneath the trees, shadow settled over me like a blanket. The air turned cooler, sharper, like crossing through something solid.

The forest should have been beautiful. Towering pines reached into the sky, their canopies locking together so high above they looked painted on. Shafts of sunlight pierced through the gaps, turning dust and pollen into glittering specks, like reflections from eyes.

The trees stood in eerie precision, spaced too evenly to be wild. If you stood still and lined yourself just right, the gaps between them formed perfect corridors that stretched into forever.

Every step we took sank into the soft undergrowth. The sound didn’t carry; it just died at our feet, swallowed whole. Maybe it was the thickness of the brush, or the way the trunks trapped the sound, but it felt deeper than that. Like the forest didn’t want us to make noise.

Of course, Matt's voice broke through, “Hey, uh… when you said that stuff earlier. About things coming out. What did you mean, exactly?”

Katy didn’t turn around. She was a few steps ahead, walking between the shafts of light, her boots crunching softly in the underbrush.

“I meant what I said,” she answered.

“Like… animals?”

“Not animals.”

Eli slowed a little. “Then what?”

As if trying to change subjects Katy interjected, "My dad was near the southern edge, so maybe we should try that way?" Katy said, pulling out her compass and facing south.

Matt squinted through the trees. "We can just head toward that dead tree. Use it as a landmark."

I followed his gaze. Between the trunks, maybe a mile out, a tree stood taller than the rest. Not by a little, it towered over the canopy, skeletal and black like it had burned from the inside out. The branches spread at wrong angles, too many joints, reaching in directions that didn't look natural.

It stood just off-center in one of those corridor gaps between the pines. You could see most of it, but not all. Like the forest was framing it. Or hiding it.

"Yeah," Katy said slowly. "That works."

Nobody moved for a second. We just stood there, looking at it.

"Anyone else think that thing looks weird?" I asked.

"It's a dead tree," Matt said. "They all look weird."

"Not like that."

Eli tilted his head, studying it. The feather in his hair caught a shaft of light. "My mom used to say when a tree dies standing up like that, it's because something won't let it fall."

"That's comforting," Matt muttered.

"Just a saying." But Eli's hand went to his jacket pocket, where the pouch was.

We started walking. The undergrowth was thick enough that we had to move single-file; Katy first, then Matt, then me, Eli bringing up the rear. The tree stayed visible through the gaps, always there in the corner of your vision if you looked for it.

For a while nobody spoke. Just boots on soft earth, the occasional snap of a branch, our breathing. The silence felt heavier the deeper we went, like the forest was waiting for us to say something worth listening to.

Matt, again, broke first. "So what's the deal with your people and this place?" he asked over his shoulder. "Your mom really thinks the woods remember things or whatever?"

"She doesn't think it remembers exactly," Eli said. "It's figurative, she talks about it like it's claimed."

"What do you mean?"

Eli was quiet for a few steps. "There's an old story. My grandfather told it to me once, before he passed. Said his grandfather told it to him. It's about this place, or something like it. It's happened to other places too."

"Like a legend?" Katy asked.

"More like a warning." He paused, like he was deciding how much to say. "A long time ago, before the reservation, before any of this was fenced off, there was a winter that lasted too long. Game disappeared. People got hungry. A hunting party went into the forest looking for food, seven men, I think. Only three came back."

"What happened to the others?" I asked.

"That's the thing. Nobody knows. The three who came back wouldn't talk about it. They just said the forest had changed, that something in it was hungry now. They told everyone to stay away from the trees, the old growth, the places where the light didn't reach right. Said to always check above, that the canopy wasn't safe anymore."

Matt snorted. "Sounds like they got lost and made up a story."

"Maybe." Eli's voice was flat, not defensive. "But after that, people who went into those woods started disappearing. Not all at once. One or two every few years. Search parties would find their camps, their gear, everything left behind like they just walked away. And the tracks they'd leave..."

"What about them?" Katy asked.

"They'd start normal. Then they'd get longer. Spread out. Like whatever was walking was getting taller with every step."

A stick crunched underneath my foot and I caught my breath. Katy looked at me like she wanted to smack me.

"My grandfather said the old people had a name for it. *Wihtiko*. The hungry thing. Said it was tall as the trees, thin as winter, and it wore the forest like skin. You wouldn't see it until it wanted you to. And by then it was too late."

"Cheerful," Matt muttered.

"It's just a story," Eli said. But his hand stayed in his pocket.

I glanced back over my shoulder, checking the trees behind us. Eli's words had gotten under my skin, *check above*. But there was nothing. Just pine trunks disappearing into shadow.

When I looked forward again, I found the tree through the gaps. Still there. Still visible. We'd been walking toward it for... how long? An hour? It looked exactly the same distance away. Maybe a mile, maybe less. Hard to tell through the forest. But we should've gotten closer by now.

I didn't say anything.

We kept walking. The rhythm of it - boots, breathing, branches shifting overhead - made everything feel automatic. Like we could walk forever.

"Hey, Katy, did your dad ever mention anything weird about this place?" Matt asked. "I mean, besides the obvious."

Katy was thoughtful for a moment, navigating around a fallen log. "He kept logs. Field reports. Most of it was standard stuff, trail maintenance, wildlife counts. But there were entries he marked different. Red ink. Incidents he couldn't explain."

"Like what?" I asked.

"People getting lost. But not normal lost." She adjusted her pack straps. "There was this couple, maybe five years back. Experienced hikers. They radioed the ranger station saying they'd been walking for three hours but hadn't covered any distance. Said the landmarks kept repeating. The same boulder, the same clearing. My dad went in to find them."

"Did he?"

"Yeah. They were half a mile from where they started. Swore they'd walked for six hours. Their watches confirmed it, six hours had passed. But they'd only gone half a mile." She paused. "My dad wrote that the compass had been spinning. Just slowly rotating, never settling on north."

Eli glanced at her. "Did he believe them?"

"He marked it in red ink." She pulled out her own compass, checked it. The needle pointed steady south. "He had other reports too. Search and rescue teams that would split up, agree to meet at a landmark, and then couldn't find each other for hours even though they were within calling distance. A surveying crew that swore their grid was right but kept measuring the same plot as different sizes."

"That's impossible," Matt said.

"That's what they said too." Katy kept her eyes forward. "The last entry he made was two days before he disappeared. He wrote: 'Space doesn't work right past the marker tree. Time moves wrong. Don't trust your watch or your map. Trust what you can see.'"

The forest pressed closer. Or maybe we'd stopped noticing how close it had gotten.

"What's the marker tree?" I asked, though I thought I already knew.

"He never said exactly. Just that it was the boundary. That once you passed it, the rules changed."

We walked for maybe a several minutes more.

Matt stopped walking. "What time is it?"

I checked my watch. The face was hard to read in the dim light. I had to angle it to catch what little sun was left.

"Can't be right," I said.

"What?"

"It says almost seven."

"Let me see." Matt grabbed my wrist, squinted at the watch. His face changed. "Jesus."

Katy pulled out her phone. The screen glow looked too bright in the growing dark. "Seven-fifteen."

"That's six hours," Eli said quietly. "We left the truck at noon."

It felt like we'd been walking for maybe two. The sun had been high overhead, then it was just... gone. The forest had turned gray-blue, that twilight color where shadows stop having edges.

"How did we-" Matt started.

"The tree," I said.

Everyone turned. I was already looking for it, scanning through the darkening corridors between the pines.

Then I saw it.

My throat went tight.

It was right there. Maybe thirty yards away, rising out of the forest floor like a monument. The trunk was massive -fifteen feet across, maybe more- split down the center in a blackened seam that looked like a wound that never healed. The bark was charred, peeling in long strips that curled away from the wood like dry skin.

But it was the branches that made my stomach drop. They didn't reach up. They reached *out*, extending at shoulder height, at head height, too many of them, spreading in every direction like arms. Like it was trying to grab the whole forest at once.

And the way it stood between the other trees, half-visible through the gaps, too much of it hidden, it looked like it was leaning around cover. Watching us.

"That's not where it was," Katy whispered.

"Let's stop here," Katy said finally. Her voice was steady, but quiet. "We're not going past that thing in the dark."

Nobody argued. We backtracked about fifty yards and found a small rise between the roots where the undergrowth had thinned enough for a tent. Matt dropped the cooler and rifle with a grunt, the sound dying fast in the still air.

The light faded while we worked. By the time we had the tent up, the forest had gone blue-black, the gaps between trees filling with dark. We got a small fire going, more for the light than warmth. The flames barely pushed back the shadows, just made a pale circle that stopped at the edge of the clearing.

Every few minutes the wood popped, too loud, like something cracking in an empty room.

"We should take shifts," Matt said, poking the fire with a stick. "Keep watch."

"For what?" I asked.

He didn't answer right away. "Just in case."

Katy nodded. "Two hours each. I'll go first."

"I'll take second," Matt said.

Eli and I would split the rest. Nobody said it, but we all knew. None of us wanted to be the last one awake before dawn.

We sat around the fire for a while after that. Matt chewed jerky. Eli sat a little apart, the feather in his hair hanging limp and dark in the firelight. His hand in his pocket.

I looked past him once, toward where the light died against the trees. I couldn't see the tree anymore, but I knew exactly where it stood. Like I could feel it watching.

"Tomorrow we check the southern edge," Katy said quietly. "If there's nothing there, we head back."

"Deal," Matt said. "I'm done for the day."

Eventually the fire burned low and we crawled into the tent. It was tight, four sleeping bags overlapping, elbows and knees bumping in the dark. The nylon walls felt thin, like paper. Katy unzipped the flap and slipped out for first watch, her silhouette disappearing into the firelight.

I zipped it closed behind her. The sound was too loud.

For a while I could hear her moving outside, the soft crunch of her boots, the occasional shift of a log on the fire. Then even that faded. Just breathing in the tent. Matt on my left, Eli on my right, both already still.

The quiet pressed close. No wind. No insects. Nothing.

I stared at the dark fabric above me and tried not to think about the tree. About how close it had gotten without us noticing. About Eli's story; *tall as the trees, wore the forest like skin*.

Eventually, exhaustion won. My eyes closed. The darkness outside became the darkness inside.

I don't know how long I slept, but I woke to crying.

Soft at first, muffled, like someone trying not to be heard. A woman's voice, broken and hitching.

I lay still, listening. Matt was supposed to be on watch. Had something happened? Or was it Katy, had she gone outside and gotten hurt?

The crying continued, just beyond the tent wall. Close.

I sat up carefully, trying not to wake the others. The tent was dark, the air cold enough to see my breath. I could make out shapes. The sleeping bags on either side of me.

The crying hitched again, closer now. Whoever it was, they were right outside.

I reached for the zipper, started to pull it down. The sound cut through the quiet.

"Don't."

I froze. The voice came from inside the tent.

Katy. She was sitting up, barely visible in the dark. Her hand shot out and grabbed my wrist.

"That's not me," she whispered.

My stomach dropped. "What?"

"I'm right here." Her voice was shaking. "I've been right here the whole time."

The crying outside continued. The same rhythm, the same broken hitching. A woman's voice.

Katy's voice.

"Matt," I whispered, louder. "Matt, wake up."

He stirred, groggy. "What-"

"Shut up and listen."

We all went still. The crying was clearer now, like whoever it was had moved closer to the tent. I could hear the intake of breath between sobs, the wet sound of someone wiping their face.

It sounded exactly like Katy.

"Holy shit," Matt breathed. "What is that?"

"Eli," Katy whispered. "Eli, wake up."

Eli was already awake. I could see his eyes open in the dark, fixed on the tent wall.

The crying stopped.

The silence that followed was worse. Like the forest had been holding its breath and now it was listening.

"Nobody move," Eli whispered. His hand was in his jacket, clutching the pouch.

We waited. Seconds stretched. The tent fabric shifted slightly in a breeze that didn't exist.

Then, from right outside the tent, maybe a foot from where I sat:

Footsteps. Slow. Deliberate. Circling.

Not the soft crunch of boots on undergrowth. Something else. Heavier. The sound of weight shifting, branches snapping, but too spread out.

It circled the tent once. Twice. Then stopped at the entrance.

We could hear breathing now. Deep and wet, like lungs full of water.

Nobody spoke. We just sat there in the dark, listening to something breathe on the other side of a sheet of nylon.

Then it moved away. The footsteps receded, slow and measured, back into the forest.

We waited until the sound was gone. Until the only thing we could hear was our own breathing.

"What the fuck was that?" Matt whispered finally.

"I don't know." Katy's voice was barely audible.

"Yes you do," I said. "Your dad's reports. Things that looked like people but weren't. That's what you said."

She didn't answer.

"We're not going back to sleep," Matt said. "We're staying awake until it's light."

Nobody argued.

We sat there in the dark, backs against each other, listening to the forest. Waiting for dawn.

The fire outside had died completely. I could smell the cold ash through the tent fabric.

Hours passed. Or maybe minutes. Time felt wrong again, stretched and compressed at once. I kept checking my watch but couldn't read it in the dark, and I was too afraid to turn on a flashlight. Too afraid of what might see the light.

Eventually, the darkness outside turned gray. Not sunrise, just the sky getting lighter, that pre-dawn glow that meant morning was close.

"We're leaving," Matt said. His voice was hoarse, like he'd been screaming. "Soon as there's enough light to see, we're going back to the truck."

"What about my dad?" Katy asked quietly.

Nobody answered.

"We have to look," she said. "We're so close. The tree - that has to be the marker tree. He was past it somewhere. We just have to-"

"Katy." Eli's voice was gentle but firm. "Whatever that was last night, it knew your voice. It was wearing it. Your dad's been gone two years. If he was still alive, he wouldn't be anymore."

The tent went quiet.

"I know," she whispered finally. "I know."

When we unzipped the tent at first light, the tree was gone.

Not fallen. Not hidden by mist. Just... gone. The space where it had stood was empty, just forest like everywhere else. But the ground there was darker, the undergrowth dead in a perfect circle.

"Where did it-" Matt started.

"Doesn't matter," I said. "We're leaving. Now."
