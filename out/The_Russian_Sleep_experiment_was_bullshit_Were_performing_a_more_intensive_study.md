You know how we say that we don’t really know why humans need to sleep? I mean, we do to an extent, but it’s still a massive scientific work in progress. The body uses time sleeping to do a ton of wild stuff, from healing the body to compartmentalizing memories. The only thing is, that’s all we’ve found so far.

Of course, the best way to study what something does, is by studying what happens in the absence of it. The longest on record is eighteen days, and by that time the cognitive function of most people isn’t too great. Granted, this was all done without using any kind of performance enhancers, so to speak.

I got the job offer weeks ago- a sleep deprivation study sponsored by the US government. Ethical? Absolutely not. But, they gave me a proposition I couldn’t refuse, to use the old cliche. 

You see, I’m genetically predisposed to a prion disease called Fatal Familial Insomnia. Right now I haven’t shown any signs of it, and on average it doesn’t start to onset until around fifty, so I have a few good years left before things go to hell for me. So, while I can, I’ve dedicated myself to research into finding a cure for prion diseases, in some desperate hope that I can fix my own genetic fuck up. No luck so far, but they recruited me with the promise of access to CRISPR technology to further work on genetic modifications, and I wasn’t passing that up. Even if I can’t do it for myself in time, if it can save people down the line from the hell I saw my mother go through. The hell that awaited me whenever the fucking prion decided it was my time.

So, the basic thesis of the experiment was that we have five subjects, all people that were made to ‘disappear’ by good old Uncle Sam. We weren’t given any previous information or even names, just these five people, literally assigned numbers as their names so we couldn’t figure out who they were. These people wou8ld be studied as they were deprived of sleep, using any methods possible to make sure they stayed conscious. These methods would range from drugs, rewards, torture, or anything that would prevent sleep. Again, it wasn’t ethical, but I’m doing this to hopefully save some innocent people down the line.

Myself, two other researchers, one guard to each of the subjects were given a modestly sized lab environment to work with, and amenities for non-subjects were pretty nice. We had beds, a full kitchen complete with a cook who came in for lunch/dinner, and entertainment for those of us not currently working. Good thing, because this place was our home for the foreseeable future, until this experiment was over.

The subjects had things a lot less comfortable than we did. They were kept in a common room, with individual rooms that split off from it consisting of bathrooms/showers and various entertainment options. I know, giving people so awful they were erased by the government doesn’t seem like a great thing, but we want to keep their minds stimulated to keep them awake. There would be meals brought in at regular intervals, all with the sufficient nutrition needed to thrive. Every single room was monitored by no less than three cameras, even the bathrooms, so we could constantly keep watch on every subject. In addition, there was a viewing room in front of the main common area, one way glass allowing us to directly observe.

From here on, everything is presented from my daily research notes for a full picture of how things develop. This is the personal record of Doctor Michael A Ripley, kept for my own future research and records. 

DAY ONE

Everything is going smoothly so far. I met my fellow researchers, Philip and Taryn early on and we determined how we would split work and observation. Eight hour shifts each. Taryn would take the midnight to 8 AM, I would take over until 4 PM, then Philip would finish out the night before Taryn came back to cover for him. It was easy enough, and we would have at least two guards keeping watch with us at all times in case a situation arose. 

Taryn’s shift came and went without incident. The subjects were gathered around one of the tables, folding chairs set up for seats. That was the most comfort they had, though. There were no beds, only a hard metal cot on the walls with no padding or pillow. I’m assuming that’s about what they were accustomed to though, because nobodyw as really complaining about it.

Subject One is a male in his mid-20s. Dark hair, scrawny, pale as hell. Looked like a school shooter stereotype. 

Two is an older man, early 50s, balding and covered in some questionable tattoos. We weren’t given any info on what he did, but you don’t get that many swastikas permanently inked on by making good life decisions.

Three is in his forties. He had a kind face, wry smile that looked like he would crack a dad joke at any time. Honestly a pretty jovial guy. Probably the only one who I have no idea how he could have ended up here.

Four looked like Jeffrey Dahmer reborn in the digital age. I assume he’s in for similar acts as Dahmer, too. Hearing him talk over the monitor gave me the creeps, just monotone and uncaring. There was nothing behind his eyes.

Five looked like the American Psycho type. Wealthy, no human empathy or consideration for life, and that Tom Cruise look where every little move was rehearsed to best manipulate anyone he interacted with. I swear I saw him staring into the cameras a few times, right at me, and he would just smile.

None of them knew what the experiment was. As of now, the sleep deprivation methods weren’t in play, being so early. It wouldn’t be until near the middle of my shift that things needed a little push.

Two was yawning, and said he was going to his bunk for a nap. So, I hit the dial in his room to make sure that didn’t happen. There was no control for the lighting on their end, so I dialed up the intensity of the fluorescents. Then, I activated a small speaker hidden behind his bed, playing a frequency that would disrupt any attempt at sleep for a while. The others stayed in the commons area, bullshitting about why they were here. 

Nothing of note happened otherwise.

——-

DAY TWO

They’re getting irritable. To be expected, considering that they’re now hitting over twenty four hours without sleep. So far the light and sound methods of deprivation have worked fine, with nobody wise to what’s happening yet. I do believe the irritability will lead to tensions by tomorrow.

Four is beginning to exhibit paranoia, frequently looking around, speaking to himself under his breath, and generally acting on edge. More than once I’ve seen him staring directly into the camera, though I’m not sure if he realized it was there. Creeped me out, nonetheless.

Around noon on my shift, One began to speak to Three. I’ve transcribed their conversation below.

ONE: Do you see them?

THREE: Sorry? Who? I can see all of us in here, but nothing else.

ONE: The kids.

THREE: Excuse me?

ONE: They told me what you did. 

THREE: I don’t know what you’re talking about.

ONE: (laughs) Sure you do. How many were there?

THREE: Please leave me alone.

ONE: You’re the reason I’m here. Why should I leave you alone?

At this point I called in one of the guards, Murray, just in case something started to go down in there. Three, despite his kinder, laid back attitude, was definitely starting to get on edge. One did leave him alone though, walking over to his own room and sitting on the metal cot, staring at the wall for the next two hours with this smile on his face like he was totally zoned out.

I’m still not sure what any of them did, so I don’t know if One was actually onto something or not. Three was certainly shaken by it though, sitting alone and not saying anything for the rest of the day. Eventually he went to his room, laying on the cot while tossing and turning. From the notes Philip left, he’s been complaining of the others being too loud, saying they’re shouting when everyone is talking in whispers at best. Likely an early sign of prolonged sleep deprivation.

Two and Four have been oddly friendly, though I’m not entirely sure why. I’ve heard them briefly talk about their jobs in their early life. Two was some sort of construction contractor, while Four specialized in industrial chemicals. Of course, that’s before or during whatever got them in here. I’ll keep an eye on how their relationship develops. I expect many of them to break down after a certain point.

DAY THREE

Today was relatively calm, with barely anything of note happening. The subjects have begun to isolate after over forty eight hours without sleep, each staying to their own room or corner of the main area.

I have noticed Four increasingly talking to himself, more hurried and louder than previously. Most of it was nonsense, sounding like the paranoid ramblings of some budget Alex Jones.

Subject Five is the one that’s been most interesting to watch. He’s going along with this just fine, not even a sign of irritability or paranoia. All he’s done is sit in his own corner, just watching the others. Occasionally he would give a smirk, but for the most part he just remained quiet there.

—

DAY FOUR

They’ve begun to realize what’s happening. Three approached Five, asking him when the last time he slept was. Upon realizing it was before they were sent in here, they started to ask the others. One said he was awake for seventy two hours prior to arriving, suffering from insomnia as is, so I guess we had a little headstart there. Everyone else agreed they were going on day four though, referencing the clock and calender on the wall to be sure.

Two began to get irritable, screaming to be let out and told what was going on. Three tried to calm him, telling him it was likely we were being monitored. Four started to search the entire place for cameras, though he didn’t succeed. One was in his room, already deep in the throes of paranoia and whispering that “they were coming for him”.

From what I can gather, he’s seeing hallucinations. At one point, he was pointing at the door, screaming at something on the other side, telling it that it wasn’t welcome in his room. It sounded like he was rebuking a vampire, telling it that it didn’t have permission. At some point Two started screaming at him to shut up, the screams only getting louder as the rebuke from One turned into pleas with whatever was there to leave him alone. His cries were haunting, legitimately terrified of whatever the sleep deprivation was making him see.

During all this, Five remained in his corner, watching silently. He had by far done the least in his whole time here, but he had been awake the entire time. From my best guess, he was dissociating into a possible type of meditation, perhaps relieving some of his sleep deficiency.

DAY FIVE

Our methods to date for sleep deprivation are starting to become null. Two has nodded off while Four was going into a state of microsleeps to compensate. We upped it to the next phase, introducing amphetimines through their meals. There was a very noticeable burst in altertness from everyone, though some started to display signs of what’s commonly called cabin fever.

Four began to scratch at his skin, determined that something was trying to get out of his body. Guards were on standby to assess. Before long, he had gouged long lines in his arms, blood beginning to ooze from the wounds. Murray was sent in as medical, another guard named Greg accompanying to ensure the other subjects complied.

MURRAY: Why are you injuring yourself?

FOUR: Because I need to let it out.

MURRAY: Let what out?

FOUR: My soul.

MURRAY: Your soul? Why do you need to let your soul out?

FOUR: Because it’s been trapped. It wants out before it’s stuck inside forever.

MURRAY: Alright, buddy. Let’s get you wrapped up to stop the bleeding.

TWO: Mind telling me why the hell we’re in here? I haven’t slept since stepping through that door.

MURRAY: You don’t deserve an answer.

TWO: Tell me what’s going on! (He became violent here, smashing a hand into the concrete wall).

GREG: (Draws gun) Calm the fuck down, man.

TWO: No! No! You don’t tell me what to do. I god given rights to my life!

MURRAY: You don’t have rights anymore.

After he left the room, Murray gave me the rundown of the current mood in there. The smell is terrible, according to him, and up close everyone looks ragged. Apparently the look in Four’s eyes was that of a dead man, and Murray was former special forces so I’ll take his word on that. 

Philip told me that Four was still trying to claw at his skin during the night, and the guards eventually had to go in and forcibly restrain him to keep him from doing any lasting damage. Since then he’s just begged for someone to kill him so his ‘soul can leave’. I don’t know what he means by that, but the feeling of dread it’s sunk into my gut is something that scares me. There’s a foreboding here that I really don’t like.

DAY SIX

I’m shaken, to put it lightly. Subject One at this point has been awake the longest of them all, at least nine days, give or take some hours. His onset of symptoms has been somewhat of a litmus test for the others, getting an idea of what could change. I fear though, that we’re only just getting into the worst of the symptoms.

We got around two in the afternoon today when One went into his room, sitting on the metal cot. Everyone else was isolating, with Two walking around and screaming every so often in anger. Three was in his room, rocking back and forth under the bed while apologizing under his breath. Four was near catatonic in his room, staring at the wall. Meanwhile, Five was just going about business. He was the only one to keep up some semblance of hygiene at this point, as the others hadn’t showered since arriving. Pretty sure I saw some of them not even cleaning up after using the toilet, so I can’t imagine the smell in the room. From what Murray told me yesterday, it made him want to gag.

I was recording amphetimine dosages, making sure we weren’t going to overdose anyone, when I heard my name. At first I assumed it was Murray, checking in to see if I wanted anything from the kitchen. When I looked around and didn’t find him though, my name was spoken again. This time from over the sound feed.

One was staring at the camera, addressing me directly as he gazed right into me through the monitor.

ONE: Why are you doing this, Michael?

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. There’s no way he could know who I am, no way that he could know my name. They didn’t even know we were here in the first place. As far as they knew, this was just a guard surveillance room behind the one way glass.

ONE: This won’t help you. You can’t be cured.

At this point I’m in the midst of an anxiety attack, full blown panic and pressing the little call button I had for the guards. Murray came shuffling in, asking if he had to go back into the ‘shit pit’ again as he called it now. He saw me in the midst of a meltdown, One still speaking to me directly.

ONE: You’ll die screaming. You’re lucky though.

At that point Murray took me out of the room, shouting for Philip to come in and take over for a time. He sat me down in the small medical bay we had, stocked with typical EMS supplies, and gave me an anti-anxiety drug to try and get me to relax. Philip took over for the remainder of my shift and into his, so I could go on to bed and try to clear my mind. They believe me that he was talking, but were trying to give me rational reasons for what he was saying. He had been talking to himself, so maybe his name was Michael as well? Maybe it was just a hallucination of someone he knew previously? I was willing to accept any kind of rationalization at this point, but the dread was still sunk deep into my chest telling me that wasn’t the case.

I’m going to lay down now, but wanted to type out these notes while they were fresh in my mind. The medicine is making me feel [drowsy](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/0C6Arbjtny).
