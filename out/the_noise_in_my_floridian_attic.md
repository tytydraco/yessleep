the noise in my floridian attic

Back in early 2017 I was young (and i was 5) I was playing roblox on my xbox 1(like every kid) and my mom was out in the living room with the family on her phone with her sister or my aunt, and then suddenly BANG!! there was this huge noise in my attic, everybody was scared BTW there is NOTHING in my attic, and of course my dad did not hear it

1 and a half hear ago it happened again late 2018, BTW 2 month prior we checked it and still, NOTHING, but this time my grandma was here, I was playing the SAME GAME on the Xbox 1, I was obsessed with this game on roblox, In the living room my brother that was 9, my dad and my grandma, again BANG!! it happened again my dad and my grandma and I heard it, we looked up there in my attic later in the afternoon, NOTHING, NOTHING

Another year and a half later, late 2020 it happened again this time I was the only one in the living room this time everyone heard it, me, my brother, my mom and my dad heard it, now I was starting to get scared, my grandfather died in 2015, I'm not sure if he is doing it or not, 2 months later we checked, still NOTHING that means that the noise will happen somewhat soon.

Mu house was made 58 years ago, atleast every 2 days, something strange happens, like before I started to write this, a cup fell in my family's kitchdf another fork fell, the kitchen suplies have been falling since late 2021 I will edit this post on new year or sooner to tell you if it happened or not.

I think my grandfather is haunting my house to show that he is still with us, my parents think that the attic has moce in it, the only thing in the attic is a few crates, nobody knows what's in them not even the landlord, I think there are termites but idk, my parents tell me that in late 2016 it happened while I was sleeping but like I said idk,

So my parents just texted me (I'm home alone rn) and they said that the mutated bug came from the attic for context, late 2019 me and my brother were playing and I look in the corner of my eye snd I see on the wall is a mutated bug, it made no noise, It WAS alive it was a stink bug, cricket and dragon fly mix, the colors of a dragon fly, the body of a cricket and the bottom piece for the stinking, it was NOT a dragon fly, NOT a cricket and NOT a stink bug, looked like a combination of all three of them

Every time we opened the attic after the noise that happens, it smells like something died, EVERY TIME. I just checked and it still does! It smells before by a month and after by three months
