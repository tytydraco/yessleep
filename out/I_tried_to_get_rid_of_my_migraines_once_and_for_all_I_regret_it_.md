Okay, I just badly need some advice here. I have no idea what the hell to do, and I found this place, seems like you all know what you’re talking about. This is really REALLY time sensitive.

It’s…yeah, no idea how to explain this.

Fuck, honestly it’s better if I just tell you what’s been happening.

I’ve always had migraines. When I was younger they weren’t that bad, mostly just a bad headache that lasted for a few hours, no visual disturbances. A nap, and I’d be good.

Then I started working with screens a lot, and as I got older, the migraines got worse. I started getting auras. Cleared it with my doctor, nothing else weird going on there.

If you’ve never had an aura, it’s basically like little shivery areas of TV static that move in a wave over your vision. It sucked. Not as bad as it does now, but still, sucked.

Honestly I’d give my left arm to have those migraines back, now.

One day, I found this post about this cure-all. Promised to totally wipe the migraines out, no more experiencing them, ever. For anyone who knows how much these suck, that was a dream.

The instructions were weird. Not bad, just... weird. The post had an image, like an anatomical one, almost like a medical textbook drawing, but it seemed old. It was black and white, fairly chill, but the eyes of the thing were a little unnerving. Eyelid-less, and staring. The post just said I had to stare into its eyes for 1 minute, unblinking, and the migraines would disappear. 

Thinking back on it now, even the post looked a little weird. There were no comments, and I can't remember a subreddit name associated with it. Just, a post from nowhere.

It's Reddit. I thought it was a shitpost, had a spare minute, and thought, 'Hey, what if?'. I stared at this picture's eyes for a minute straight, eyes watering, drying up, and I felt a weird sense of calm settle over me. The kind you feel when you walk through a graveyard, or onto the grounds of a church. An old, sepulchral kind of calm. The kind with some healthy fear hiding just beneath the surface.

The minute passed, but nothing else big seemed to happen. I swear, literally nothing. My eyes felt dry, so I had to shut them to give them a chance to come back to normal, and for a little while I couldn't really scrub the afterimage of that drawing from my retinas. But that was it. I shrugged and kept right on scrolling.

Safe to say, migraines didn't stop. Instead, well.

I started…

Okay, yeah, this sounds crazy even as I’m typing it.

I started seeing something, in the auras. And like, it’s tough to know if I’m seeing anything, right? Because my vision goes all weird anyway. But now, I’m sure of it.

First time it happened, it was about 6 months ago, in the middle of my work day. I started noticing the small little shivery spot in the right half of my vision, thought *‘fuck’,* and got up to follow my usual routine. Meds, eat, shower, nap. That usually took care of it, though I’d be a zombie the rest of the day.

I popped my meds, ate some toast, and drank a shit ton of water. This whole time, the blind spot started growing bigger and bigger, like it usually does. Before all this started happening, the spot would stop at like… maybe half of my vision.

But this one kept going, and going, and *going*.

It freaked me out a bit at first, but then I just thought it must be a worse migraine than usual, and geared up to nap. I was lying down, looking out my window and about to close my eyes, and I saw something out there.

If you’ve ever spent time in a biology classroom, you’ve probably seen one of those mannequins. The kinds with no skin, so you can see all the muscle and flesh and bone.

This looked like the worst version of that that. Like a biologist tripped acid and pieced together cadaver pieces to make a person, skinless. It was just standing out in the middle of my backyard, pretty far away but still visible. Worst part, it’s head was cocked. Like it was checking me out, too.

It was only visible where the aura was in my vision, pieces of its legs and the top of its head cut off where my vision went normal again.

I can’t even tell you how seeing that felt. My stomach dropped like a stone, and I swear to god every single thing in me froze. I think my nails stopped growing for a second, I was that freaked.

Jesus, I thought I was going crazy. Still kind of do.

I remember thinking, ‘*nope, hell no, no capacity for this*’ and just going to sleep, praying it would be gone. I know, I know. Stupid. But what would you have done?

I woke up that first time a few hours later, nauseous, with a residual headache, but no more blind spot. The thing wasn’t there anymore.

Thought that was it. Just a weird trick of the mind.

It was not.

I kept getting migraines, and I kept seeing the thing. I get them a couple of times every month, not that often thank god, but every time. There it would be. That red, awful, skinless thing standing with its head cocked.

Worse, it started coming closer.

With every new migraine, it crept up on me. Through the shivery edges of my auras, I could start to see more details. It has no eyelids, so it never blinks. No lips. Its face is always stretched in this horrific, permanent smile. I name shit, I can’t help it. In my head, I started calling it, ‘No-Skin Thing’. Creative, I know.

When I tell you that I have seen every doctor, every specialist, every psychologist, I mean it. This shit is happening, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what’s going on.

I’ve looked it up in a million different ways, hunting through forums and comment sections and medical boards and police files. That original post is completely gone, but I found one guy who was asking the same questions as me. I thought, for a second, that maybe I wasn’t alone in this. Maybe he had a No-Skin Thing too.

Found his gravestone about a 20 minute drive away.

His family told me he was a pretty chill guy, but he just freaked out one day. Wouldn’t stop screaming, “IT’S IN ME, IT’S IN ME, IT’S IN ME, IT’S IN ME” before he collapsed, twitching, and died.

Of hypoxia. Like something strangled him from the inside.

And yeah, he got migraines.

 

It’s been 6 months since this started, and the last migraine I got – about 3 weeks ago – the No-Skin Thing was standing at the end of my bed, head fucking cocked like always. Eyes wide. Unblinking. It *glistened,* like the flesh beneath a fresh burn, organic. Like a raw nerve, staring you down as if it wants *in.* I just sat there, staring at it, for 3 hours, head pounding and nausea barely at bay, goosebumps raised all over my skin. Never in my life have I felt fear like that.

Since then, I’ve done everything I could to keep the migraines at bay. Obsessive tracking, eating religiously, sleeping 8 hours a day minimum. I’m so hydrated it’s not even funny, I run, I don’t even *look* at my laptop anymore.

But, yeah, fuck. Can’t run forever.

I thought about, you know, taking care of things another way. Blinding myself. Jumping from a high place. But hope wins out, right? Maybe I could go years without a migraine, if I was just careful.

Hah. 

About twenty minutes ago, I started seeing that god-awful little shivery dot in my vision.

And it’s there. I can feel it. Even right now, the spot is expanding, and I can see the edges of it.

It’s close. It’s really close. It’s right next to my face, I can fucking feel it, and it’s *breathing.*

I’m trying not to look at it, but soon it will be all I can see. I'm shaking as I type this, my partner is in the other room. I don't want her to...

I don't want to die screaming like that. 

Please, please…

What the hell do I do?
