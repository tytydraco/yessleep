I hate cowbirds. I was taught to as a kid by my father. If you don’t know, they're more parasite than bird: awful little winged leeches that sneak into other bird’s nests, kill their chicks, & replace them with their own. He used to take me out to the ranch at the crack of dawn to check the trap, a rusted ten foot tall cage, & we’d often spend mornings inside it wringing their fragile necks. I’ll never forget the satisfaction I felt when the tension in my hands would ease with a loud, snapping crack. It’s actually kind of funny now that I think about it, whenever those abominable birds come to mind, they produce a pleasant feeling inside of me: memories of my dad. Adults often like to complain about turning into their parents, but I never got that. I’d love to be like my old man. I’ve been thinking about him a lot recently, I even saw him the other night in a dream. We were duck hunting with the family dog, an old half blind bloodhound named Daisy. We opened fire on a spooked flock as its members took to the sky. Initially we didn't think we’d hit anything, but soon after we spotted a downed duck floating in a nearby pond. Daisy went in after it, but strangely did not retrieve the waterfowl. After she paddled out into the water, & to the bird, she made a full stop, & just… stared at it, confused. Moments later she was gone, vanished beneath the surface of the water. The duck was gone too. 



I don’t know what would’ve happened next because my wife (Sam) woke me up. She thought she’d heard something outside moving around the house. This had been a recent & common occurrence, basically routine. I’m not sure what spurred on this bout of paranoia, but she’d even claimed to have seen something peering through the window at us while we slept, something with big & wet, bloodshot eyes. It wasn’t that I didn’t believe her, because I did. My wife was nothing if not reliable. I just didn’t know what to do about it other than make my usual lap around the house. I poked my head out the front door, didn't see anything. I stood in silence for a few minutes, heard nothing. So I went back to bed. 



Dad was a funny guy. His will opened with the line ‘My dearest apologies to those who found my corpse. I won’t go down without a fight so I’m sure that it was messy.’ He was sharp as a tack, walked with a bit of a gimp (no one knows why), & actually now that I think about it, also had suffered from frequent nightmares. Are bad dreams hereditary? Or maybe contagious? When Mom had me, he had to drop out of college to work to support us. He got a job as a ranch hand running cattle. When he told his history professor, a quirky old hippie named Dr. Bob, the academic laughed at him & said ‘ride em cowboy!’ When dad passed he left me the ranch, his pickup truck, everything but the kitchen sink really (the kitchen sink in this instance was the good silverware- my sister got that). Moving out to the countryside was good for both Sam & I, not just on account of the fresh air, a luxury we weren’t afforded living in the city, but because we had money now. Like money, money. Sure, having to pay the property tax was a pain, but compared to what our rent used to be? It was peanuts. Sam & I both shared a general disinterest in children. We had agreed long ago that we didn't want any kids, so it’s not like we had to worry about any type of college fund other than our own if either of us decided to return to school. 



*Hey! Are you awake?*



I woke up groggily, moodily.



*Are you awake?*



*Uhm… Yeah.* 



*Are you sure?*



*Yes.*



*I heard something outside.* 



*Are you sure?*



*Yes.*



*Are you super sure?*



*Yes, I’m sure!*



*… Alright then.*



I dragged myself out of bed, & conducted a quick survey of the house. Front door looked fine, kitchen also fine, windows- all still there. I peeked out the front door & cast my gaze quickly across the porch. My peripheral caught the tail end of something scuttling away into the darkness. Kinda looked like a racoon, maybe a possum. No need for alarm. I considered throwing on my boots & checking the trap but ultimately decided against it. No real need. All was peaceful on the ranch. I returned to the bedroom. 



*Did you see anything?*



*What do you think?*



*Don’t be grumpy with me.*



*I’m not.*



*Did you check the back door?*



*Yeah.*



*Did you actually though?*



*Yeah.* (I did not)



*Did you check upstairs?*



*Why would I need to do that?*



*Because sometimes the wind blows that one window open!*



*Do I really need to?*



*Yes!*



*Yeah, but do I like, have to- have to?*



*I could always get my other husband to do it.*



*Oh really. Is that so?*



*Yeah, he’s a really cool guy. He’s imaginary & helpful. He cooks for me, rides a motorcycle, & sells drugs.*



I chuckled. *Fine.* 



Not that it really mattered, but that one window had blown open. After closing it, I proceeded back down the stairs & into the kitchen. I considered breaking out the leftovers for a midnight snack but decided instead to just have a glass of water. I was running the tap when I was startled by the most horrible noise outside. It was so loud that it pierced the walls of our home, & caused my ears to ring. It was a shrill, sharp shriek, followed by the loud flapping of feathered wings. I jumped maybe a full three feet into the air, & dropped my cup which exploded into a cascading tidal wave of glass that scattered across the kitchen floor. Sam, quick as a bolt of lightning, came rushing in as I hollered at her to stop.



*Wait! Wait! There’s glass! There’s glass!*



It was too late. She cursed as the soles of her feet swept across the minefield of jagged shards. I winced for her. Blood quickly pooled around where she now stood frozen. Trying my best to be helpful, I tossed a pair of kitchen towels her way. 



*What was that noise!? Did you hear that!?*



*I think it was a bird in the trap. Maybe a buzzard got in there. I shouldn't have let it scare me so bad. Fuck! I’m so sorry, are you okay?*



*Yeah… I mean no, there’s glass in my foot!*



Suddenly her face turned a pale & deathly white. Terror filled her eyes. I immediately became worried that she was going to panic, or that she was losing a considerable amount of blood very quickly. My worry turned to confusion as she aimed an index finger at me, & then I too felt dread. She was pointing past me. I turned around & locked eyes with a pair of large unblinking, glowing red orbs watching us through the kitchen window. They shifted slightly as my gaze fell upon them, & then approached. I could see now that they belonged to a bird. A towering, feathered monster standing at nearly ten feet tall. A massive scarred beak protruded from its grotesque face, & the end of it now poked the window. It wanted inside. 



I should have been afraid. I should have panicked. Hell, I nearly did, but then I remembered… We had prepared for this. My hands launched to the top of the window, where a metal roll up cover was primed & ready. I pulled it down quickly, & just in the nick of time too, as I felt the window shatter behind it shortly after, as the monstrous bird of prey broke through the glass. I turned to Sam, who nodded at me approvingly. 



*I’ll pull the rest of the covers, can you flip the trigger?*



*On it!*



I leapt across the glass covered kitchen floor & dashed into the living room. The thing outside struck, & clawed at the metal sheet protecting us, beforing matching my pace to the back door. I pulled the door’s metal cover down, with no time to spare. The bird screeched in frustration, a cry which reverberated throughout our home, & then it was on to the next access point. We raced one another to each remaining door & window across the house. At every turn I was just barely a step ahead of it. Our alarm system roared to life! Sam had successfully activated it. Sirens blared outside, & red flashing lights descended from their respective positions in each room. In the basement the water heater whistled as it quickly fueled our exterior sprinkler system. Boiling hot water sprayed across the side of the house before striking the creature. It howled a blood curdling, wounded cry, & then made the quick decision to flee. It pounded its wings with such ferocity, & strength that it was airborne in seconds, & then gone from the ranch entirely, in mere minutes. A trail of soaked, steaming feathers gently fell to the ground in its wake. 



Sam & I regrouped in the living room. We both took a moment to catch our breath, before I posed the question: 



*Did it work? Is it gone?* 



*Shush!* 



*I think it’s-*



*Shush!!!* 



We then stood in silence for what felt like hours. Slowly, a measured & comfortable calm returned to the property. The sprinklers eventually ran out of water, & powered down. Our alarms quieted, their lights dimmed. It began to rain lightly, the soft drizzling sound that accompanied the precipitation was also joined by the returning hum & chatter of the local wildlife. I could hear a moth tapping on the wall nearby. 



*I think it’s gone-*



*Shush!* 



*Sam. It’s gone! I think we did it!* 



She craned her head back & forth for a moment before nodding in agreement. She opened her mouth to speak. It was then that our roof exploded. Splintered wood scattered outside across the lawn. Shrapnel cascaded down the stairs & landed at our feet. The feathered beast, returned now with a vengeance, had dove like a missile into our home. Paralyzed by horror, we listened to it thrash, scratch & claw upstairs, before finally coming to our senses & taking action. 



*Plan B?*



*Plan B!* 



Sam scampered on bleeding feet to the basement stairs. She had fully descended before I had even made it to the crest of the drop into the basement, but when I did finally arrive at that top step, I found myself frozen in my tracks. My mind had claimed dominion over my motor function, & all sense of urgency & rationality was now gone. My thoughts raced. We had spent so much time preparing for this day. We had worked tirelessly, developing a defense to keep that thing out but now that it was in- how would we get it out? We had effectively turned our home into a giant birdcage. 



Then I heard the stairs creak, & I saw a large shadow dance quickly across the hall. Shortly after I could smell its breath. I could hear its feathers rustle. I could sense it trying to deduce where we were hiding. I quickly ducked around the corner & tried to control my breathing as best as I could. The rain had picked up considerably, & was now flooding through the large gaping wound in the ceiling. Our monstrous intruder stalked past the fireplace, & then into the kitchen. I scooted my way down the hall, attempting to out lap it. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight up as I heard the bird draw a loud, wet breath nearby. It had changed directions & was now unknowingly moving straight towards me. I had to make my move now, there was zero time to waste. I snuck back around the corner & into the living room, before making a desperate break for the basement stairs. But I was too slow. It was waiting for me. The beast’s large red eyes met mine & now almost seemed to sneer. Its disgusting tongue slithered out of its mouth, its large talons scraped across the floor towards me. I could feel a scream beginning to build in my chest. My eyes almost began to bulge in terror. Then I heard the voice of my favorite person in the world. 



*Duck!*



I hit the deck as Sam raised a shotgun behind me & fired a scorching round of hot buckshot directly into the monster’s chest. Two more booming shots followed, & then the defeated, feathered abomination tumbled across the room & down the basement stairs. It groaned there briefly before falling dead silent, & completely motionless. Still, Sam wasn’t taking any risks. She slammed the door at the top of the stairs shut & pulled its metal cover down with a satisfying, magnetic clank & click. 



*Did you kill it?* 



*I don’t know… But yeah. Yeah. I think it’s dead.* 



*Let’s not count our eggs before they hatch.* 



*That’s not funny.*



*I wasn’t trying to be. Let’s barricade that door & reload Plan B. There’s more shells upstairs right?* 



*I think so.*



I got up off the floor, & as I tried to pull myself together, I was completely overwhelmed by a powerful feeling of hope. But you know what they say about hope, right? It’s the things with feathers. 



The living room floor burst open. Concrete was ripped from the ground, the entire foundation of our home shook as that awful, awful thing with feathers clawed its way through the floor & into our vicinity. Its glowing red eyes now oozed, blood & viscera dripped from its wings, & its talons, rubbed entirely raw, dragged & gripped unnaturally at the ground below. It reared up, & then let out the most horrible cry. The sound was so terrible that it knocked Sam & I to the ground where we clutched at our now bleeding ears. The creature stomped towards us. Rain poured through the hole in the roof behind it, lightning crackled, thunder pounded! In one ferocious motion it raised its wings high in the air above us. Razor sharp claws gleamed in the wet moonlight. We could do nothing but try to shield ourselves from its hungry wrath with our bare hands. The thing lurched towards us… & then stopped. It suddenly hunched over, & then shrunk backwards, before letting out a deep, whooping cough. Shortly after it coughed again. Then once more, before breaking out into a hysterical fit. It doubled over, & began to gag violently before puking onto the space just before our feet. 



But there was no vomit. No blood, feathers, or detritus. Just a baby. Well, now it was our baby. Despite our best efforts, the Stork had bested us, & delivered a very upset & crying, but perfectly healthy, human baby. The Stork now glared, annoyed, at Sam, who could do nothing else but pick up the infant sitting before her. Then the Stork rose back up, spat onto the wall next to us, & in several swift flaps of its wings, disappeared back through the roof. It would soon be on to its next delivery. 



*Yep. I mean… That's what Will & Alyssa said would happen. There’s nothing you can do. You can’t beat it.* 



*We should’ve reinforced the roof! This is exactly what I was worried about. Did you not see my friendly reminder on the calendar to talk to Eddie about that!* 



*Friendly reminders are never friendly, they are always passive aggressive!*



Our baby began to cry, which ended the argument. The storm outside had also ceased but the damage to our home was catastrophic. We had attempted, in a sense- unsuccessfully, to babyproof the house, but now we would have to actually baby proof it. I would also need to go buy diapers asap. Sam read my mind. 



*I saw the keys get kicked into the kitchen.*



*Thanks.* 



*Can you get, like, other baby stuff too?*



*Like what?*



*The stuff that people normally get.* 



*I don’t know what you mean.* (I did know)



*Yes you do.* 



*Yeah.* I sighed. *Alright. How’s the foot?* 



*I’ll probably need to clean it first, & then get stitches, but otherwise it should be fine.* 



I watched as Sam diverted her attention away from her wounds, & back to the baby. She gathered it deeply into her arms, & rocked it back & forth. The infant calmed quickly, its cries waned, & then it fell into a deep sleep. As I watched I couldn’t help but think of my Dad once again. He always used to say that you gotta roll with the punches. Personally, I always thought it’d make more sense to just stop hitting yourself. I guess I wouldn't be going back to school anytime soon. As I watched Sam become more comfortable with our baby by the second, I couldn’t help but laugh. I thought of Dr. Bob’s words to my father. 



‘Ride em cowboy!’
