At first, what appeared like the shadow of a huge hand stretched across the lifeless, hard-packed dirt of the strange planet. But this place may have more life than I realized. With a cry, I realized that what looked like a black hand was just the shadow of the skittering, massive spider-like being that approached us in a blur. I turned back to Arkovitch’s son, whose name now came to me: Alaric. Alaric Arkovitch.


“Oh God, get me out of here!” Alaric screamed, his voice booming and echoing through the canyon. The massive mandibles of the spider creature flicked open and closed, faster and faster, as if it could already taste the delicious, soft flesh of the injured man lying prone on the ground.


Without thinking, I grabbed his outstretched hand and tried to drag him away from the beast, but I had no real hope of outrunning this black monstrosity. It towered at least twenty feet in the air, and looked to have a dozen sharp, branching legs, each stabbing into the hard dust with every forward step it took.


I grabbed the black mirror out of my pocket, screaming into it. Even though I was young at the time, I was not stupid, and my instincts were still sharp.


“Please, I ask you, God, the Over, the One who Sees, take me out of here!” I said, trying to look into the center of the hypnotizing electrical current that ran across the surface of the smooth, glassy mirror. At first nothing happened, and my heart began to race. The same thought ran across my mind over and over: “I’m going to die out here. I’m going to die here on some strange world. The mirror has undoubtedly failed me. It sees my desperation and mocks me.” But no, that was the red mirror- the one who had led Arkovitch’s son to his mutilation and, perhaps, abandoned him. Was it only a fluke that I had come to this place, to what looked like an alternate Earth? A strange desert plane with massive insectoid monstrosities was not my idea of a vacation.


And then the mirror began to change. Runes that had been invisible only moments before now began to light up. I ran as fast as I could while dragging the still-living man. I could only pray the mirror would be quick.


I felt a strange vibration from Alaric’s hand that I grasped. It felt like shaking or trembling, quick desperate pulls in different directions. But my attention never wavered. Within moments, the mirror had sent me traveling.


My vision went white and my ears rang, as always happens when we pass between worlds. A sense of exhilaration and pride filled my heart. I had done it. I had saved Arkovitch’s son.


I fazed back into being in the Hollowhead Cave, where my father awaited. His face looked stoic and blank, his eyes totally flat as he stared around at the stone. For a moment, it seemed he didn’t see me at all.


“Father!” I cried. “I’m back! And you won’t believe it… Arkovitch’s son, Alaric, I saw him! I got him back!” I had a sudden surge of energy, but then the whining of the light-filled doorway in the cave seemed to pierce deep into my brain. I almost felt like I would faint. I took a few deep, slow breaths and sat down on the floor, still holding tight to Alaric’s hand. My father looked down at me, his face pale, his mouth open in a silent expression of horror.


I looked behind me, expecting to see Alaric’s unconscious body, but instead I realized I only held a dismembered arm, a sharp point of a bone sticking out of the bloody limb. And then I did faint, and everything went black.


\***


I woke up to a feeling of cold, clean water on my tongue. Someone held a tin cup to my mouth, elevating my head and trying to pour water from what seemed like a local stream into my mouth. It instantly refreshed me, and my eyes flew open. Thank God, I was no longer holding the mutilated limb of the dead man.


“Well, I guess we know what happened to Alaric,” my father said. “He must have used the red mirror. I would guess the mirror returned without him, abandoning him in some Hell-world, maybe at night, when the demons of that place are most active. 


“It would not be the first time the red mirror has acted with such treachery. It cannot leave you if you keep it directly on your person at all times, but if you fall, while running, and it goes flying….” He shrugged. “It can decide to return home to Earth Prime.” That was the Reepiner name for the regular Earth, the one where people built cities and the year was 2023 AD- the starting point for all Reepiner travel, as far as I knew, unless Reepiners existed on other worlds or had started to convert some of the strange, otherworldly creatures they encountered to our secret path.


“I don’t know about any Hell-worlds,” I said, “but this looked like an endless desert with huge, rabid insects. The… the… *monster*... must have been the size of a small elephant, and faster than any animal I’ve ever seen in my life.”


“Earl Arkovitch isn’t going to respond well to this news,” he said. “I know he has, in his heart, still some hope that his son will return, perhaps with wild stories of other universes. But we must go straight to him and let him know. What he does from there is up to him.” So we did hike back to the car, mostly in silence. I was deep in thought, reflecting on my first horrific experience traveling.


I had heard stories from the older Reepiners about worlds they had seen. There were endless universes, endless worlds, and many alternate Earths, some covered in water, others covered in endless deserts, others circling dead stars or black holes in the cold blackness of space. 


A few also talked about Heaven-worlds they had seen, where beings fed on pure bliss and light, where rockets took the strange inhabitants to other galaxies in the matter of moments and death and disease had been nearly vanquished by the forward march of technology. They talked about beautiful cities floating in the clouds with silver spires miles high, and elevators that took one outside the atmosphere of the planet to look at the beauty of space without any interference or air to distort the infinite stars.


These thoughts passed through my head as we walked in the forest, the smell of pines and flowers clearing my anxiety and bringing me back to the present. Yes, my first trip had been horrific, but I had survived. And now, perhaps, my news would bring closure to the High Priest, who would know what happened to his son and be able to bury at least a small part of his body. An image flashed in my head: a tiny coffin, a few inches wide by nine inches long, with a decomposing arm inside it, a sharp splinter of bone poking out through the gory, torn flesh at the end. I shuddered.


\***


I had never liked Arkovitch much. He made an imposing figure. Standing well over six feet tall, his hypnotizing blue eyes stared out at the world, intelligent and determined, but the way he spoke to people gave me, and many others, the impression that he thought less of us. No one would ever say it to his face, but he seemed, in many ways, arrogant and inflexible.


However, he had also led the Reepiners to a period of prosperity. We had received converts from Blackwater and other militias, as well as various converts who had immense wealth in the stock market or were involved in the running of certain large tech companies. He used this to acquire weaponry, to form his own small army and to increase the power of our little island of spirituality in the world.


When my father and I pulled up to his house and told him, at the door to his mansion, what had transpired, his face grew stonier and angrier. He said not a word. As soon as we had finished, he turned away, saying brusquely, “Stay right here,” and then slammed the door.


Neither my father nor I looked at each other or said a word. The tension in the air felt thick. After about ten minutes, Earl Arkovitch came back to the door, looked at my father and me, and addressed us.


“James,” he said to my father, then looked at me, “and Tristan. Tristan, your very first travel ends up like this…” He shook his head. “I am disappointed in you. In both of you, to be honest.” The hairs rose on the back of my neck. What was he talking about?


“Reverend…” my father said, but Earl raised a hand.


“Since when do we leave the bodies of our dead in our worlds, to be eaten by abominations or fed on by demons?” he said, his voice never rising above conversational level, but instead allowing a deep, underlying venom to imbue each word.


“I barely made it back alive!” I said frantically, unbelieving. Was this priest a madman?


“We *never* leave the bodies of our dead,” Earl hissed. “You two will return with me. Tristan knows the world, he can take us back there. I have called up a team to Hollowhead Cave. You will return with me right now.” And so we did. And that's how I found myself back in Hollowhead Cave with a team of seven other men, including my father and Earl Arkovitch, planning to go back into another world that very night.


\***


We waited for an old man, the most powerful one known for opening doors and traveling. He lived far out in the forest in a small shack, acting like a hermit much of the time and spending most of his time in nature. Yet when the Reepiners went to find him, he would always come and help. He would teach the younger ones about doorways and portals and try to pass on his wisdom as well. I was excited to see this figure, even though I didn’t know so much as his name. But I had heard many stories about his power.


While we waited, a large black Reepiner named Samuel who Earl had recruited from Blackwater began to sort through our weaponry. My eyes bulged as I saw them pull out AR-15s with detachable flashlights and telescopic laser sights, as well as many extra loaded magazines and what I immediately recognized as grenades. They were the kind with the pineapple exterior to allow extra grip when throwing them. I counted seven AR-15s and maybe a few dozen grenades. It looked to be quite an arsenal.


They started handing weaponry around and handed one to me. I took the gun in my hands, looking at its beautiful craftsmanship, feeling the butt of its extendable stock against my shoulder. I felt immediately more comforted by the presence of weapons, even though deep in my mind, I wondered how effective any such weapons would be against creatures from another world. As my mind ran through the encounter with the huge, spider-like being and hairs began to rise on my arms, the gun began to feel a lot smaller.


At that moment, the old man walked in, reminding me of depictions of Merlin or Moses I had seen. His huge, white beard extended down nearly to his waist, and he held a solid ironwood staff, the strange wood shining black in the torch light of the cave.


He looked at the mass of us assembled there, seven Repineers in all, all armed with semi-automatic rifles and strapped with multiple clips and grenades all around their chests.


"This is a tall order, Reverend," The old man said to Earl Arkovitch, whose face turned into a scowl.


"You are the strongest traveler and most accomplished with doorways, Old Father," he said, his face still twisted into something ugly and unhappy. "Do you say you cannot get us all through the door?"


"Aye, getting one or two through the door before it slams closed is no issue. Seven or eight, however... this will push the talents of even the most accomplished Reepiner. And you have all your baggage, your gunnos and exploding granados, I see.” With this, he gave a casual flick of his face towards the heavy semi-automatic rifles and grenades strapped across our bodies. “Every extra pound we must force through the door will make the chance of success less and less likely."


"Nevertheless," Arkovitch said, "it must be done. Are you not Meriope Windston, the greatest and most powerful living traveler? Open the door. I know you can do it." The old man had a petulant and almost child-like look of unhappiness on his bearded face, his huge hook nose trembling slightly beneath his deep, brown eyes. But he sighed and nodded.


"It shall be done," the old man, whose name was apparently Meriope, responded. "If God wills. If the Overmind is with us and gives us the power..."


"He will," Arkovitch said simply, taking the red mirror out of his cloak. We all stared in fascination and horror for a minute. The mirror seemed to have a consciousness of its own, one that could be felt in every part of the cave. It was as if a demon had just opened its eyes in the darkness. And yet it radiated a power that was unmistakable and pure. I felt the hairs rising on my arms and head accompanied by a humming sound, like strong electrical power lines filling my ears.


"Put it away!" Meriope cried, his eyes widening, his straight, very white teeth flashing as he opened his mouth in a silent scream. "For the love of all gods, put it away until we are ready! Would you use an atomic bomb simply to give some light in the darkness? Or slice off your face so you don't have to shave your beard? Don't treat the trinkets of the other worlds so lightly." The cave went silent.


“I only wish to bring peace to my son, to recover his body and bring it back to us,” Earl said quietly, lethally, like the hissing of a snake.


“Peace does not come out of the end of a gun, my priest,” Meriope said, not in the least bit perturbed. “It comes from the Overmind. Only death comes out of the end of a gun.” We all stopped, the cave going quiet except for faint breathing, and then the old man started up again.


“Who is the young man whose mind will reveal which world to us?” Meriope asked. I stepped forward. He apprised me, looking me up and down slowly, as if searching for something that wasn’t there. Then he sighed.


“Young man,” he said, “you will be central to this opening. Your mind must mix with mine, and we must use our combined power to focus on the doorway. You will be the last one through, so your job is ever more dangerous. When the door slams shut, it slams shut instantly. Travelers have been cut in half, I tell you truly. Why, one of my mates when I was a lad lost his right hand. Do you understand the gravity of what I have told you?” I nodded. “Then come by my side, and let us begin. The night is drawing on, and strange things may be seen in the night over there as well- if it is night. I hope your sake it isn’t.” 


With our guns and grenades now strapped onto our bodies with equipment Samuel had passed around and helped us fasten when necessary, we looked like a ragtag group of rebels. Many of the Reepiners wore the coarse brown robes common to our religion, giving them a medieval, monkish appearance. Samuel did not, however. He wore brown desert fatigues and combat boots. Standing nearly six and a half feet tall, his black skin shining and his huge muscles bulging, he was an imposing presence, and I felt the desire to stand near him when any battles erupted. He radiated confidence and deadliness.


 “Are we ready?” Earl asked, low, a slight tremor in his voice. The rest nodded. Meriope grabbed my hand.


“What is your name, lad?” he asked in a quiet voice.


“Tristan,” I said. “My father is James.” I pointed to him.


“I care not for your father, lad,” the old man said, not unkindly. “It is you who will carry the task to the end. You are the strongest and purest, the youngest as well. I will wait here until you return, until I am sure you will not.” He grabbed my hand. “Now begin to meditate on the world you saw. You will be returning there.” Earl saw we were assembled. He pulled out the red mirror, going in front of the doorway in the cave- the one that looked like solid stone, impassable.


The humming began immediately, and the poisonous presence filled the cave. But I closed my eyes and focused on the world. I felt someone else in my mind, and I realized with horror, that it was the old man. Meriope had telepathic powers somehow, and he saw my memories with me. I felt his hand twitch, and what felt like a surge of electricity passed through our bodies. But it didn’t hurt.


“Focus harder,” Meriope said through gritted teeth. “Focus on the door. Focus on the world. Open the portal.” I did. With thousands of images flashing through my mind, the way the sun had shone on the desert, the dead rocks, the many legs of the spider, I focused and sent this thought out front, towards the door.


“It begins to open!” Earl cried in a loud, ecstatic voice. But I didn’t open my eyes.


“Focus harder!” Meriope said. “We have almost got it.” Sweating, straining, my eyes flicking back and forth under their lids, I concentrated. I put all of my energy into those thoughts and that door, and then, I felt something give.


“Behold!” Meriope cried as he and I opened our eyes at the same time. “The portal has opened!” The men began to run through, scrambling into a dark, desert world on the other side of the stone threshold. When the last one was through, Meriope pushed me towards the door. I was sprinting, seeing the door closing. With one last bit of energy, I jumped through as I felt it slam shut behind it. A whoosh of air ran over my skin as the stone slammed back into the wall.


In those last moments, I was still connected to Meriope telepathically, and I heard his one thought over and over as I went through the door. Once it closed, it stopped, but I kept hearing it repeating in my head nonetheless.


“You think you go to a desert-world. Nay, lad, it is a Hell-world, and it is night there. I will wait for you here, but it is a Hell-world, and very few will return from such as that.”


And as I looked back, I saw Meriope's eyes. In the depth of his power, his eyes had widened. I saw his pupils contracting and expanding rapidly. His eyelids fluttered up and down, as if he were seizing. Strength flowed out of him towards the door, a current that seemed to twist the air, like a rising heat wave from a desert. That was the last thing I saw from this world before the nightmare began.


\***


When we came through, it was chaos. The red mirror dumped us in the middle of night in the worst possible place, as it is known to do. And as I came through, my ears had begun to ring and my vision went white. When traveling between worlds, these things nearly always happened, knocking one off balance for at least a few seconds, as if a flashbang had just been thrown in the area.


But as my vision cleared and my hearing returned, I was relieved to see that this planet was Earth. I could tell that much from the constellations and moon in the sky. Some other Earth, yes, perhaps in a universe where life had grown strange and terrifying, but still some form of Earth.


In front of us stood a desolate camp. It reminded me of death camps I had seen footage of, Communist and National Socialist death camps where people were starved or frozen. Row after row of razor-wire surrounded the camp, and a gate stood at the center. It had a sign above it, but it had seen so much sun and aging that the letters had faded to almost nothing.


I saw no guards in the watchtower, and no one shot at us. The place radiated silence and death. But there was a smell that came from it, a smell like rot and shit and corpses. Around the camp, I saw strands of webbing, sticking to various fences and posts, covering the dilapidated barracks inside the camp that looked ready to collapse under the slightest breeze.


“Is this it?” Earl asked from my side in a low voice. I looked around. The rocks looked similar, but I had only been in this world for a short time, and if the entire area looked like a rocky desert, what chance did I have of finding the exact same spot?


“I believe we may be close,” I said softly. “The webbing, for one. That must be the creature who took… who took your son.” Behind us, I heard people clicking off the safeties on their rifles. We began to walk towards the gate. I stayed by the side of my father and Samuel, letting Earl lead the way.


As soon as we had entered, I heard a sound that sent shivers of horror through my body. It sounded like the breathing of a dying man with pneumonia, a raspy, gurgling breath that came from all around us. And that smell intensified immediately. The smell of death blew on the breeze towards us.


When we had entered the camp, the gate swung shut behind us, as if on its own accord. I turned, jumping, but saw no one there.


And then they began to come out of the barracks. They were horrifying beyond words- children in torn rags with emaciated bodies whose bodies were rotting.


Long, stringy black hair hung over their faces, and on their striped uniforms, blooms of dark red showed long-dried blood. Brown streaks mixed with the blood, and their eyes shone with hatred and malice as they approached from all sides. Hundreds of them gasped and shook.


They reminded me of pictures I had seen of children at Auschwitz. Their trembling, emaciated legs barely held up their weight. Their knees knocked together, the bones making a clicking sound.


Some had their noses and cheeks eaten away by insects. Black swarms of flies surrounded them, eating their flesh and laying eggs as they walked forwards, all staring and rasping at us, the treat in the center of all.


“Shoot them!” Samuel cried, the one man who kept his head in the terror of the moment. “Shoot them, for God’s sake! Would you have us all die?” That broke the stillness, and with a deafening roar, the rifles began to open fire.
