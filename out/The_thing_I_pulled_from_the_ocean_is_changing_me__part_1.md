It was a little past 7:00pm on a particularly humid Monday morning when I first discovered the Creature. 

I had been taking one of my famed early morning beach walks, hoping to beat the sunrise, as I did most of my days back then. I spotted it less than a kilometre from Lucille: what I call the single-story beach house my late Aunt Katherine had bequeathed to me after her long-standing battle with leukaemia had finally reached its conclusion. 

At first I had thought it was just a tangle of seaweed; a rope, perhaps. Then I had gotten closer, seen all the blood (not that I knew that was what it was then, of course). It had gotten caught in a net, you see. One of those large fishing types, like what trawlermen are always using to hoist huge numbers of the Gulf’s finest onto their boats. Of course, I knew right then that what I was looking at wasn’t of this world. Looking back now, I can’t help but wonder how different things might have turned out, had I just continued walking, left the thing to whichever grizzly fate awaited it. But then, I guess that’s why hindsight’s fifty-fifty, isn’t it?

In the end, it had taken Nel and I both working together in order to get it into the wheelbarrow. That’s my neighbor, Nelson. He’s gone now. They’re all gone—but I’ll get to that.

Like myself, Nel had come to this particular stretch of Florida’s coast under somewhat of a cloud. He’d been a big-shot in his past life, supposedly. Antiques. That sort of thing. He’d hit and killed a kid one night after getting behind the wheel while plastered, and the resulting fiasco had seen him run out of L.A. with his tail tucked firmly between his legs. 

If I’m making it sound like we were friends, we weren’t—friendly, sure. As all good neighbors should be. But off-season in this part of the world? You take all the companionship you can get.

By the time we finally got the little guy back to Lucille, the sun was up, and both of us were panting and heaving from exhaustion. A thick film of sweat had formed all over our bodies, making our shirts (Hawaiian short-sleeve for me, navy polo for Nel) cling uncomfortably to our backs and shoulders. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried pushing a wheelbarrow through sand, but it’s no easy chore, let me tell you (sure, our ages most likely played a part; while neither of us could be said to have been in our twilight years, we were still far from the spring chickens we had once been).

“Jesus jumped-up Christ on a pogo stick, Hal,” Nel had cried, staring down at the Creature in my wheelbarrow. “What do you suppose this thing is?”

We were standing in my kitchen now. Outside, the encroaching tide swept steadily along the shore, the sound of its rhythmic crashing broken only by the faint, laboured sound of the creature’s breathing.

I shook my head. “I have no idea.”

“Do you think we should call somebody?”

It was the question I’d been mulling over during the entirety of our journey back. A half-dead… *whatever* this thing was, washed up on the shoreline was certainly none of our business. Better to be safe, let the proper authorities take care of it. It was the only reasonable thing to do.

Only we didn’t do that. 

To this day, I’m not sure why. Looking back, it’s possible “it” was working its magic on us, even then. Hard to say for sure. And God knows, my memory’s not like it used to be. All I know is that in that moment, nothing could have irked me more than the thought of some suit-clad government folk swanning in and taking over things. And besides, we’d found it. It was ours—whatever it was.

“Maybe it’s worth something,” I said. “I mean, there’s got to be a reward for something like this, right?”

“*A reward?*”

“Sure. Think about it; this could be the first time anyone’s ever encountered something like this. At the very least, we’d be famous.”

I didn’t mean it, of course. Not that the thing wasn’t valuable. Of course it was. It was just the only thing I could think to say. 

If Nel was still thinking about doing the right thing, he gave no sign.

“We’d go down in history,” he said. I noted the sudden far-away look in his eye.

I’m not proud of how I manipulated him. Or the things I did later—which, again, I’ll get to. Sure, there’s a chance it was just the Creature working its magic on us again. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that fighting fate is like trying to fight the tide; you can either go with it, or fight until your body gives out. And I had no intention of getting sucked under the waves. Not then, at least.

So we didn’t make any calls.

And of course, it was a mistake.

\*\*\*

I don’t remember much of what happened after—a consequence of shock, old age, and a three-quarter bottle of Captain Morgan’s Original Spiced Gold. I remember the feeling though; a kind of vacant feeling, like my body was there, but my mind was off somewhere else. Like sleepwalking with your eyes open. 

I didn’t know it then, but it’s a feeling I would come to know well.

Turns out the thing liked water. Maybe that seems obvious to you now, but it wasn’t then. Again, we were in shock. And neither of us were exactly what you might call “experts” when it came to matters of this nature.  

In an effort to better accommodate our new friend, we’d gone and brought over one of the industrial-sized drums Nel used to collect rainwater for his yard. 

All things considered, it worked pretty well. Although no room at the Hilton, it was better than the wheelbarrow we had used to get the little guy over here. What was more, it was no longer making those awful gasping noises. I took it as a win (even if only a small one).

We worked in almost total silence, barely speaking except for the odd muttered grunt or curse.

It was Nel who finally broke the silence.

“We should name it,” he said. “You know, give it a name.”

The temperature had cranked up by that point, turning an already uncomfortable day into an even more unbearable one. Outside, the waves continued to crash and roll—albeit now at a quieter volume. Low tide wouldn’t be long. 

“You want to give it a name?” The plan had been to hold off on making any big decisions until we could figure out what we were going to do with the thing. Naming it felt counterintuitive; to the best of my knowledge, people did not normally name a thing they knew they would eventually have to give away. The last thing we wanted was to get attached. “Seriously?”

“Sure. People name all kinds of things. Hurricanes. Cars. Their peckers. Why can’t we name this?”

I cast a quick glance at the thing in question. It didn’t look much like a Carl. Or a Steve. It didn’t look much like anything, really. Just wet, knotted… *stuff*, through which a pair of beady black eyes watched us in silence. Like a Pokémon from Hell.

“That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” I said. I though it over a moment. “And besides, what would we even call it?”

“We should call it Gizmo,’ he said. “You know, like from that movie?” 

“We’re not calling it that.”

“Well then what do you propose, El Capitan? Seeing as you’re such an expert on naming things all of a sudden…”

“*K’thesu.*” 

The word was out of my mouth before I even realised I’d spoken. 

It came out of nowhere; one moment nothing, then—*bam*—there it was, bright and clear in my mind’s eye, like a billboard on Times Square. It meant nothing to me, of course. Little more than a jumble of syllables.

But then, it wasn’t my word, was it? 

Meanwhile, Nel was looking at me like I’d just sprouted another head.

“K’thesu? What is that, Welsh, or something?” He scoffed. “Well, I’m still going to call him Gizmo—providing that’s okay with *you*, that is.”

He bent towards the little guy in question, but of course “Gizmo” gave no response—not that I could blame it. From my own personal experience, indifference is the best posture to adopt when it comes to dealing with Nel and his never-ending list of eccentricities.

“*Bah*. Suit yourself.”  He turned back to me. “So what do we do now?”

“Just sit here and wait, I guess.”

“Wait for what?”

I shrugged. I had no fucking idea.

\*\*\*

Night came, and Nel left—under the implicit understanding he would be back first thing in the morning to check on things. I could have told him not to bother, that I’d be fine, but I knew it would have been pointless (most times you tell Nel not to do a thing, he’ll do it anyway just for the hell of it).

I sat on the edge of my couch for a long time after, staring at the barrel, and the unassuming little creature inside. I wondered if we had made the right decision by electing not to inform the authorities of our discovery, and if our doing so would come back to bite us in the ass. Mostly, though, what I wondered about was the Creature itself. 

Why was it here? Where had it come from? And, perhaps more importantly, was it dangerous? And if so, did I really want it in my house? Sure, it was only a little thing. But then, so was a snake, or a scorpion, or a spider—all things that have been known to readily kill humans. And this thing—whatever it was—was decidedly larger. Did I really want something like that in my home while I slept soundly only feet away?

I continued to sit like that, contemplating the universe and its infiniteness, until tiredness overcame me, and I shuffled myself off in the direction of my bed.

That was the first night I heard the Creature talk.

\*\*\*

The majority of those early days are vague to me now, but I still remember some things.

True to his word, Nel returned the next morning, bearing gifts of a nature that initially surprised me. Among these were a digital camera (the type whose name ends with a number, and weighs about as much as a newborn); a glossary of aquatic life native to the area; that morning’s newspaper; beer.

And fish.

They were fresh from the store, still wrapped in white paper, and the smell had been damn-near palpable. It hadn’t even occurred to me what kinds of things the Creature might like to eat. I think that’s part of the reason he took to Nel so well in the beginning; the guy was always thinking ahead, always planning the next step. I’m pretty sure it’s also what sealed his fate—but again, we’ll get to that.

For the next few days he would arrive periodically, always with some new item in tow. 

I don’t mean it to sound like I wasn’t grateful for his assistance. But his efficiency and resourcefulness only served to remind me how much better suited he was to caring for the Creature than I was. Except for a goldfish when I was seven, I had never looked after anything. And that goldfish had died.

Nel, on the other hand, was once married with children. Owned his own business. Say what you want about the guy, but he understood responsibility. 

But what Nel failed to remember was that Gizmo was *my* discovery. I was the one who had found him, who had taken him in. And while I didn’t know for a fact Nel was trying to muscle in on what might have been the greatest find in the history of all humankind, I didn’t know he wasn’t, either. And I wasn’t about to give the little guy up. Not for anything.

Then, the following day, came the knock at the door.

I’d been in the living room at the time, attempting to swap a fuse in one of Aunt Katherine’s large standing lamps, when I’d heard the familiar *rap-rap-rap* of knuckles on wood. Just FYI—we don’t get many visits round these parts. The odd tourist or two, sure; mainly couples, seeking somewhere secluded for some of that much needed alone-time. But even they’re few and far between, and never during off-season.

Curious, I’d peeked my head out of the window. 

There, on my porch, stood a girl of around thirteen years of age. She wore a khaki skirt and a mint-green sleeveless jacket, the type with badges pinned to it, and I knew even before my eyes settled on the large box of cookies in her hands that what I was looking at was a girlscout.

I opened the door like a man approaching an infamously temperamental lion. “*May I help you?*”

As expected, she was just as cute as could be. “Hi, my name’s Bryonny, and I’m trying to earn my cadette’s badge,’ she said. “Will you buy some cookies? I baked them myself.”

She held them up for me to see.

“I don’t have any money,” I said.

“Oh. Okay.” She peered over my shoulder towards the living room. *Towards Gizmo*. “What’s that?”

“How much for the whole box?” I said.

“Seventy-five.”

“*Dollars?*”

“I baked them myself,” she repeated.

I threw the money at her and slammed the door.

\*\*\*

It was in the summer that things really took a turn.

Tourist-season had arrived by this point, the beaches and towns all but overrun by flocks of holiday-goers and people looking to let their hair down for a little while, away from the mundanity of their day-to-day lives. Being preoccupied with Gizmo, this didn’t concern me much, though the music from town would oftentimes carry over to Lucille, and I’d find myself singing along to whichever generic pop song happened to be playing. In hindsight, these were probably the happiest days of my life—something I’m not unaware is either impossibly sad, or outright pathetic. Still. Even with the way things turned out, I wouldn’t have traded those days for anything.

I resumed my early-morning beach walks; though they were far from the great epics I had taken during my pre-Gizmo days. Part of it was age, sure, but if I’m honest a lot of it was down to the fact I didn’t want to leave Gizmo alone. Not that I had any fear of anyone breaking in and stealing him (we got only a few visitors per year, after all). It was more a disconnection-thing: the longer I was away, the more sick I would begin to feel. At first I thought it was just my age (when you get to be as old as I am, discovering a new ailment every other day or so is just par for the course). It wouldn’t be until much later that I equated these episodes of nausea with the Creature’s hold on me—by which time it would of course be much too late.

Nel had stopped coming around by this point, too. I wasn’t sure why. A part of me wondered if he’d simply gotten bored, and had decided to spend his time someplace else; yet even then I suspected that wasn’t really the case—and not just because of how un-Nel like it would have been.

It wasn’t until after we were already a few weeks into summer that I got the call.

“Hey. Hal.” 

I sat up at once, tossing down the paperback I’d been absentmindedly thumbing through—*something about a clown in a sewer*? “What’s wrong? Are you sick?”

“Not on the phone. Meet me on the beach.”

I met him outside fifteen minutes later, just as the tide was beginning its slow crawl back out to sea. He was standing before the water's edge, staring fixedly out at it as though trying to see something far off on the horizon. There was a look on his face I’d never seen before, one that gave me cause for pause; it was just so un-Nel like. What was more, he’d lost weight. While hardly huge to begin with, his face had begun to lose a little of its shape, his cheeks gaunt and unkempt, his skin unusually pale—especially given where we lived. I wondered if maybe he was sick, after all.

“Hey,” I said, stepping up beside him. “What’s up?”

He didn’t turn to face me—or acknowledge my presence there at all, in fact. His eyes remained fixed on the horizon.

“You have to get rid of it, Hal,” he said. His voice when it came out was little more than a whisper; like wind blowing through an empty cemetery. “Take it into town. Throw it in the garbage, I don’t care. Just get rid of it. Before it’s too late.”

I stared at him, my mouth open.

Of all the things I’d been expecting when I got here, this wasn’t one of them. Nel had been besotted with the Creature. Now he wanted me to get rid of him? What?

“But why—”

“*I’m serious*, Hal,” he overrode me. “That thing in there—*it’s bad news*. You have to get rid of it.”

I continued to stare at him.

I didn’t think I’d ever been more confused. Here was Nel—the same Nel who had gotten behind the wheel of his car while drunk and killed someone, who had cheated on his wife, who had laundered money for years before finally getting caught, telling me he didn’t want to cash in on what was most likely the greatest find of the century? 

“What are you talking about?” I almost screamed. “Have you forgotten what this thing is? You can’t just… just…” I blinked as a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious. How had I not realised it before? “You’re jealous. Jealous that It chose me and not you. That’s why you want me to throw it away, isn’t it? Well, I won’t. Gizmo’s mine. I found him. He belongs to *me*.” 

I was expecting Nel to get mad. Maybe tell me what a dumbass I was being. Instead he just shook his head. “I’ve said what I came here to say. What you do with it is up to you.”

He turned and began shuffling along the beach then, but not before turning back to me one last time.

And what he said next still sends a chill through me.

“It talks to you, doesn’t it? Inside your head? Tells you things. Impossible things.”

I didn’t say anything. 

Nel nodded like that was just the response he’d been expecting, then turned and continued shuffling along the beach, slow and uncertain, looking—for the first time I could remember—very much like the old man he was.

I watched his progress for I don’t know how long, until the natural curve in the beach took him.

Little did I know, the next time I’d see him, he’d be dead.

\*\*\*

Things moved pretty steadily after that. 

Tourist season ended, the holiday-goers returning to whichever lives they’d led previous, nothing to show for their summer, save for a halfway-decent tan, and a couple stories to tide them over until next year. For the most part, I was glad. While I didn’t begrudge them their vacations, the truth was I’d begun to despise all human contact. Despite the fact visitors to this part of Florida’s coast were scarce at best, the possibility—probable or not—that someone might stumble upon my discovery and tattle to the authorities was a constant fear. Nights I would lie awake, contemplating what I would do if I ever lost him, digging my fingernails into my palms so hard I’d draw blood.

Then, of course, there was Nel.

I’d stopped answering his calls by this point, but even still he never gave up. Looking back now, it’s obvious he was trying to help me, to save me. To make me understand what the Creature—whom he’d so lovingly named Gizmo, once upon a time—was doing to my mind. What it had done to his.

I had ignored him, of course; rebuffed all his attempts to reach out to me, content in the knowledge that my shunning of him was just what he deserved for daring to try to separate us. I had convinced myself that he was simply jealous; jealous that He had chosen me instead of him. And in my own twisted way, I had believed it. 

*Had I known I was being manipulated?* I’m sure deep down some part of me must have known. And yet still, I had gone along with it, believed the lies, even as the part of me that was still Hal slowly eroded like a cliff in the face of a merciless tide. During the few instances when the Creature’s grip on me loosened, I would emerge from fugue states to discover entire afternoons had passed, leaving me shaken and confused. *What had I done during those blank moments?* I still don’t know. I fear I don’t ever want to, either.

And through it all, that voice in my head had continued to whisper.

*Must feed...*
