I didn’t expect my first post to get as much attention as it did. I posted it mostly to get it out of my head and maybe hear that I wasn’t overreacting. I read every comment, even the ones that sounded a little conspiracy theory-ish. I wish I’d listened more closely to the people telling me to leave.

To answer the most common question: yes, I installed the lock the same day.

I didn’t tell Jenna ahead of time. I waited until she left for work, drove to the hardware store, and bought the simplest deadbolt I could find. I’m not particularly handy, but adrenaline does wonders for motivation. By the time she got home, it was done.

She noticed immediately.

She stopped in the hallway, stared at my door, and asked, “Why did you change it?”

I told her I just wanted privacy and to feel safer sleeping. I tried to keep my tone light. Reasonable. She stared at the lock for a long moment longer than felt normal, then laughed a little too sharply and said I was being paranoid.

That night, I took commenters’ advice and put a chair under the doorknob, wedged tight against the floor. I also moved a heavy storage bin full of old Halloween costumes in front of the door. I planned an escape route in my head, out the window, onto the fire escape, down to the street. This felt like over-kill, but I wanted to say I honestly tried everything you all suggested. A lot of you mentioned trying to record these encounters, but that still felt like too much, so I settled for charging my phone to 100% and sleeping with it in my hand just in case.

I still woke up around 3 a.m.

I didn’t hear footsteps this time. I just knew.

Something was different. The air felt… pressed, like before a storm. I stared at the door, waiting. Then I heard it: a soft sound, almost like fingertips brushing the wood.

There wasn't any knocking. No scratching. Just contact.

I held my breath.

Then, very quietly, from the other side of the door, Jenna said my name.

She didn’t sound confused. She didn’t sound asleep.

She sounded annoyed.

I didn’t answer. The chair didn’t move. The lock didn’t rattle. After a few minutes, she walked away.

The next morning, Jenna was furious.

She accused me of “changing things without talking to her” and said the lock made her feel unsafe in her own home. She asked me why I was acting like she was dangerous. When I reminded her of what happened the night before, she went pale and said I was doing it again, that I was "putting things in her head," and "making her question herself." 

Maybe some of you are right and she is the one gaslighting me. 

She asked me if I was sleeping at all.

That question stuck with me. I don't know anymore. 

Since then, things have escalated in smaller, stranger ways. Jenna has started waking up exhausted, with bruises she can’t explain. Doors are sometimes open in the morning that I know I closed. This morning I woke up to find my bedroom light on even though I always turn it off.

I haven’t seen her outside my door again. But sometimes, when I lie awake, I swear I hear her pacing the hallway, back and forth, like she’s measuring distance.

I’m looking for a new place. I really am. But every time I try to imagine leaving, my chest tightens in a way I can’t explain. Like something is wrong with the idea itself.

Tonight, I’m keeping the lock. And the chair. And the bin.

I don’t think she likes that.
