Hello, I am Jacob Nayman, 17, and I am a senior in high school.  I love dancing, video games, and making videos.  Last year my teacher died of lung cancer which truly horrified me and my fellow classmates. My dad, who is a therapist, is very spiritual. He had just divorced my mom the year broke because of the drugs she did.  It got so bad for my mom that she overdosed and died.  My dad is the only one I have left.  All the kids at school bully me and I have only one friend friend. My friend is named Zachary Gerald Roberts.  He is also 17 years old and usually stars in my videos.  We have known each since we were 5 years old where we both went to theater camp. I think all the teachers also hate me.   He had a meeting with my teachers wife the day after because she had no where else to go and knew me and my dad through my teacher.  During the meeting she asked to go to the bathroom where she was screaming really loud but she stop about 10 minutes later.  When she didn’t come out or answer an hour later my dad went in to make sure everything was ok.  What my dad ended up seeing wasn’t a lady on a toilet but was a mangled up body .  It was so disfigured and almost recognizable, the only thing letting us know it was her was her decapitated head.  My dad had to go to court and was found guilty for the crime he didn’t commit.  He told me before he left to try and contact the spirits of the wife and teacher.  I took out the old Ouija board from my basement.  It was super old and dusty. I started asking questions but no one seemed to reply.  That was the first time I saw “the ghost”.  She said she was my teacher's wife stuck in my house but there was something off about her.  She looked  like my teacher’s wife but also slightly uncanny and different.  


Although scared I confronted her about it and she said “Spirits look different, younger, when they die.” She started to fade away and even though I was scared I tried to head upstairs and go to sleep.  Right when I almost feel asleep she came back telling me “Jacob, turn on the news.” Right then the tv turned on saying “Breaking News: Robert Nayman has been found dead.  He was found decapitated in his cell just 15 minutes ago. The police are trying to figure out what happened.” The tv turned off as I heard banging down stairs.  I ran to see what it was to see my very own dad, with his head in his hands, in my kitchen.  He seemed to be bringing it to the bathroom.  I started balling my eyes out and screaming.  Once my dad made it into the bathroom I realized, the spirit wasn’t my teacher's wife.  I walk over and see the thing eating the head and body of my dad growing fatter as a fatty oil oozes out of her pores.  Its fat body attempted to crawl after me but was so huge that its flabs of moldy juicy fat slowed it down.  I am currently writing this in my closet.  Update, I hear it’s fat banging upstairs and hear it’s big nose sniffing for me.  Please someone help me.  Every passing second it gets closer,  I hear its oils and juices and cries.  It sounds like 100’s of voices, maybe it’s all the spirits it ate. The door knob it’s turning. Please help, oh lord! 

Hello this is Zachary, Jasob’s friend.  I came over to check on him after he didn’t reply to my texts.  I knew his password because it was his birthday.  He is nowhere to be found. There is blood everywhere including his phone.  From this text I’m guessing something terrible happened to him.  He would never lie.  I have contacted the police about everything and they should arrive soon.  I hope he is alive and he did actually lie for once.  I am posting this on Reddit to see if anyone knows what happened or how to help me.
