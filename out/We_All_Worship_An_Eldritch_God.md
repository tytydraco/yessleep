“God is dead and we have killed him” is something you wish you can say if you find out the real truth.

The truth, however, is far worse. God never lived. The real truth is something that no man could ever whisper with even a shred of sanity left intact. What we call God, what we imagine to be divine and omnipotent, is nothing but a veil over a darker force—a malevolent shadow that predates even the stars. We did not create God, nor did we destroy Him. Instead, the thing we worship now, across all nations, has always been here. Always watching. Waiting.

Before we move along; just know that I am going to show you the journal entries I kept during my years of service as a spy. I don’t know why I’m bothering, though. Perhaps it’s because I no longer have anything else left to lose. You need to see this—no, you need to *understand* it. You won’t believe me, but maybe, once you’ve read it all, you’ll have some idea of what I’ve seen. What I’ve *suffered* through.

I don’t expect you to make sense of it. I doubt you’ll even be able to. I can barely make sense of it myself anymore. The words on these pages—they’re not enough to explain the things that tore my mind apart, bit by bit, until I became… whatever I am now. But I’ll let you read them anyway. They’ll haunt you, of course, as they’ve haunted me. Maybe that’s what I want. Maybe I don’t want to be alone in this.

But remember this before you begin: I am already dead. These pages may still carry the remnants of my thoughts, but the man who wrote them, the man who clung to hope, to reason, is long gone. He vanished the moment I learned the truth. The moment I saw the world for what it really is.

Read them if you dare. But when you finish, don’t ask me if there’s anything left. There isn’t. There never was.

 

**Day 1**

  
I never imagined my mission would bring me to the edge of madness, but here I sit, scribbling these words as I fight against the overwhelming dread creeping into my bones. The moment I set foot in Moscow, something felt... wrong. The cold wasn’t just outside; it gnawed at my very soul.

I was tasked with posing as Dimitri Ivanov, a devoted Soviet agent. My orders were simple: infiltrate the highest levels and uncover the truth behind Project Zorya. It was rumored to be a scientific experiment with the potential to alter the balance of power between East and West. But from the moment I began digging, I realized I wasn’t prepared for what I would find.

 

**Day 7**

  
I can’t stop thinking about the whispers. The way the men speak in hushed tones when they think no one is listening. *Zorya, Zorya,* always with that name. I’d thought it was some new technology, some military secret. I was a fool.

The documents I’ve found, the ones they tried to keep hidden even from their own, speak of something darker. Symbols, ancient texts, rituals—this is not the work of scientists. It’s the work of people who have given up on reality. Or maybe they’ve seen too much of it. Maybe they know something I don’t. Yet.

One night, while reviewing classified documents in a dimly lit archive, I came across something peculiar: a page detailing *"summoning rites"* rather than experiments. My blood ran cold. These weren’t the ramblings of a desperate scientist; they were meticulous notes. The Soviets weren’t just toying with science—they were summoning something.

 

**Day 14**

  
They’re worshipping *something.* I saw it today. A gathering of men in the dead of night, chanting in a language no human should ever speak. It wasn’t Russian. It wasn’t any language I could recognize. It was something else—something old, something that *felt* wrong.

And they weren’t praying to any god I know. No, they were praying to an altar covered in symbols, and the air was thick with this oppressive *thing.* I could feel it on my skin, in my lungs, crawling under my flesh. They bowed to this nameless horror like it was their savior.

I don’t know what they think it is, but it’s not God. It can’t be. Nothing so wretched could be a god.

 

  
**Day 20**

  
I’m losing myself. I can feel it, creeping in like a sickness. I want to sleep, but I can’t. Every time I close my eyes, I see its shape—*its eyes.*

I wish I could say it wasn’t real. I wish I could dismiss it as some sick hallucination, some trick of the mind brought on by isolation and fear. But I can’t. I’ve seen it. It’s as real as the blood pumping through my veins, though I wish it weren’t.

This thing… Uzhromoth, they call it. The documents I’ve found—they tell a story of madness, of a being older than time itself, something that devours everything: our wars, our suffering, our despair. The governments of the world—they know. They’ve known all along. And they’ve served it, feeding it with our misery.

It’s not just the Soviets. It’s *everyone.* Every nation, every leader—every system built on the backs of human lives—all of them serve this thing. We fight wars to keep it fed. We bleed to sate its hunger. We die, and it grows stronger.

God is dead. And the thing we call God never was. What we have is a parasite, one that thrives on our pain, and we—*we are the ones who keep it alive.*

**Day 24**

  
I no longer sleep. The nightmares are too vivid, too real. I see its twisted form in my dreams, though I cannot describe it without my mind recoiling in terror. It is everything and nothing at once. Its hunger is endless. It whispers to me, taunts me with the knowledge that I am too insignificant to stop what is coming.

I have heard rumors that the experiment—the summoning—is nearing completion. Soon, they will bring it forth completely, and the world as we know it will end, not in a flash of war, but in the cold grip of something far worse.

**Day 28**

  
I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. I don’t know how much longer I can fight the weight pressing down on me. I see it now, in every face I pass, in every shadow that stretches long in the fading light. They’ve all been taken by it. Every man I speak to is just a husk, empty but walking, talking, laughing like nothing is wrong. But I know. I see what’s become of them.

Even my reflection has changed. I look in the mirror, and it’s not me staring back anymore. There’s something hollow in my eyes, something dark. I try to smile, but it’s more of a grimace. A corpse’s grin.

I wish I were dead.

But death won’t save me.

Nothing will.



**Day 30**

  
The experiment is almost over. They’ll finish it soon, and when they do, there will be nothing left of this world. I’ve seen glimpses of what it will be like—shattered fragments of a future where everything burns, where there is no life, no death, only endless *devouring.*

I used to think death was the worst fate. But now I know better. I know that death is just another tool in Eldritch God’s hands. Even in death, we won’t escape. There will be no peace. No quiet. No final rest. Just the gnawing hunger of the void.

I can feel it pulling at me, even now. It wants me to give in, to let go of the last remnants of myself. To stop resisting.

But I can’t. I won’t. Not yet. Not until I’ve written everything down. Someone needs to know. Someone needs to see what’s happening. Maybe it will destroy them, just like it’s destroyed me, but at least they won’t be blind to the truth.

The truth that there is no escape.

 

**Day 40**

  
I attended the final ritual tonight. My body was there, standing among them, but my mind—my soul—was somewhere else. I felt like a ghost, hovering above the scene, watching in horror as they opened the door between our world and *its* world.

The thing they summoned—it wasn’t a god. It wasn’t even a demon. It was worse than both. I can’t describe it. My mind won’t let me. But I saw it. I saw the way it twisted reality around itself, the way the air shimmered, the walls bent, and the ground buckled under the weight of its presence. Time itself seemed to unravel as it came into being.

And the men—*they were smiling.* They were *smiling* as the thing devoured them. One by one, they disappeared into the blackness, their bodies vanishing into nothingness. And they were grateful. They were happy.

I wish I could say I wasn’t. I wish I could say I fought against it, that I screamed, that I ran. But I didn’t.

*I stood there, waiting for it to take me, too…the god looked at me with its dark gaze and disappeared.*

 

**Day 586**

 

I can no longer distinguish the living from the dead. Every face I see is hollow, drained, as if the creature has already begun to consume their souls. Maybe it has. Maybe we are all already lost. But I must keep writing. Someone, someday, must know the truth of what happened here, even if it drives them to madness, as it has me.

 

**Day 805**

Time no longer exists for me. I don’t know how many days it’s been since I last felt the pull of reality. I don’t know what hour or year it is. Time isn’t measured in minutes or days anymore. It’s measured in decay, in how much of me has been hollowed out since I first stumbled upon the truth. I’m not even sure I’m still human. What does it mean to be human, anyway, when you’ve been stripped of everything that once made you *alive*?

I wander through the motions of existence, but I’m not here. Not really. I’m just… fading. I think of myself as a ghost, but ghosts are something that once *were* and now are something *else.* They’re beings trapped between life and death. Me? I’m not even that. I’m not in between. I’m nowhere.

I’m *nothing.*

I remember when I used to think there were limits to what a person could endure, that madness was something you could understand, even fear. But madness is nothing compared to this. Madness is a comfort. At least madness is *something.* What I’ve found, what I’ve become—it’s worse than madness. It’s emptiness. It’s the absence of everything, of identity, of meaning, of time, of hope. There’s nothing to hold onto, nothing to anchor me to anything.

I’ve been consumed. I know that now. The “*Eldritch god”*  took me, too, the same way it took the others. It didn’t swallow me whole like it did them, though. No, it’s devouring me piece by piece, slowly, deliberately, savoring each bite. Every memory, every thought, every fragment of my soul—it’s all being chewed away, and I can feel it. I can feel myself slipping, vanishing.

Maybe that’s why I’m writing this down. Maybe this is all that’s left of me. Maybe once the last word is written, I’ll disappear completely. Maybe that’s what I want. Writing is the only reality I feel real in; it gives me a sense of *purpose and hope*…..

But no matter how much I write, it won’t change what’s happening. The world is still crumbling, and we are still feeding it. We feed it with our wars, our suffering, our endless cycle of destruction. We are nothing but sustenance for the thing that lurks behind the veil, waiting to consume everything.

There is no escape from this. No revolution, no salvation. Not for me. Not for you. Not for any of us. The governments knew. The Soviets, the Americans, the British—all of them. They worship it. They’ve always worshipped it. They let it grow, let it twist and gnaw at the edges of our existence. Every leader, every power that ever rose or fell—they did so in service of the “*Eldritch God*”.

And we thought we were free. We thought we had choices. We thought we had meaning.

How pathetic.

I’m tired. So tired. But even exhaustion is just another lie, another illusion. There’s no rest. There’s no end. There’s only the constant pull of nothingness, the weight of being *devoured.*

I look at my hands, and they don’t feel like mine anymore. My skin is cold, but it’s not from the Moscow winter. It’s deeper than that, like something is draining the warmth from my bones. Like something is pulling me apart from the inside. I can barely feel them now—my fingers, my palms. Soon, I won’t be able to hold this pen, to finish writing.

But maybe that’s a mercy. Maybe when I can no longer write, I’ll no longer exist at all. Maybe the nothingness will finally claim me. Maybe the cards dealt me with a cursed timeline*….Don’t we all wish we lived in a timeline that favored us?*

 

**Day… I don’t know. It doesn’t matter anymore.**

There’s something worse than dying. There’s something worse than being erased. It’s knowing that you were never anything at all. That everything you ever believed in, everything you ever thought you were fighting for—it was all for nothing. You were always just a cog in a machine that was never meant to stop. And that machine—it's powered by us, by our despair, our fear, our endless, pointless existence.

I wish I could say I have hope. I wish I could tell you there’s a way out. But there isn’t. The experiment worked. It worked because it was never about science. It was never about knowledge or progress. It was about submission. Submission to something that doesn’t care about us, something that has always been there, lurking in the dark corners of our minds, waiting for us to see the truth.

The truth is, we were born into a lie. The world is not what we think it is. We are not what we think we are. We are just flesh, just vessels for something older, something hungrier. And no matter how hard we fight, no matter how much we struggle, it will always be there. It will always be waiting.

I can feel it watching me now. I can feel its eyes on the back of my neck, like a cold breath down my spine. I want to scream, but there’s no point. It won’t change anything. It won’t stop anything.

It’s already won.

I don’t know why I’m still writing. Maybe it’s the last shred of myself clinging to the illusion that words can save me. But they can’t. They never could.

The only thing that can save me now is *oblivion.*



*\*\*\**



 A century has slipped through my fingers, and I am but a whisper in the wind, a ghost haunting the remnants of a world devoured by its own shadows. I was born into a time of tyranny, when the iron grip of the Soviet regime choked the very spirit from the land. Those were the days when the echoes of war reverberated in every street, every home, and every heart. The echoes never ceased; they only evolved, morphing into something far more sinister.

Now, as I pen these final words, the wars rage on, but they are not for territory or power. They are offerings—rituals crafted in blood, serving the insatiable hunger of the *“Eldritch God”.* Every battle fought, every life extinguished, is a sacrifice to this ancient, eldritch god. Nations rise and fall, not out of ambition, but as puppets dancing to a tune only *“Eldritch God”* can hear.

Corruption seeps through the very fabric of society, a poison that twists politics into grotesque parodies of democracy. Leaders, once champions of the people, have become vessels of despair, driven by greed and malice, as if their souls are bound by invisible strings to a being far older than their aspirations. The genocide we see today is not merely a consequence of human hatred—it is a banquet laid out for a monster, and we, the foolish, hapless creatures, are its feast.

I stand at the edge of this abyss, witnessing the world’s slow decay, and I realize the truth I have fought against for so long: I am not just a witness. I am its messenger. I have deliberately shifted timelines, altering the course of your reality. I could have warned you, but the truth is you wouldn’t listen. You cannot fathom the darkness that creeps through your lives, insidious and relentless.

As I look around me, I see the faces of those who remain—hollow shells, oblivious to the inevitable. Their eyes are glazed over, fixated on screens that tell them nothing but lies, while the *“Eldritch God”* lurks in the shadows, its influence entwined in every broadcast, every whisper of power. You are all but cattle, destined to be consumed, unaware of the maw that opens wide to swallow your essence.

The darkness is coming, and soon, it will envelop you all. You have fed it for generations, and now, it is time to collect.

I must go now. The tide has turned, and my purpose here is fulfilled. You will hear its call soon, that seductive whisper promising power, knowledge, everything you have ever desired. But remember this: that voice is a trap, a siren song leading you to your doom. It will take you to places you cannot return from, to madness where sanity withers and dies.

As I drift into the void, I am consumed by a laughter that resonates deep within me—a laughter not of joy, but of despair. For I know the truth. I know what is to come.

Soon, you will understand, but it will be too late.

*Soon, you will all be consumed.*
