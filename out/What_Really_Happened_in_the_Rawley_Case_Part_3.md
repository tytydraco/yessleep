Hello again. Or rather… hello after far too long.

I know I vanished. I also know that disappearing in the middle of a story like this is almost an invitation for everyone to assume I’m just another storyteller who lost the thread or got tired of his own lie. But that wasn’t it. The truth is that, ever since I posted the previous part, something changed. I began to hear the sound of the train… not a real one, of course, but something like a recording, tormenting me. Always at night. Always when I’m alone. And it’s not just the sound.

Last week, someone knocked on the back room door of my house, three times, slow and steady. When I opened it, there was no one, but on the grass, there were small, wet footprints. As if they had come from the woods nearby.

I almost stopped writing here. Almost. But it’s like I said before: if this story is going to be told, let it be told by someone who was really there. And, by the looks of it, I have no way out of this anymore.

**Diana Rawley.** I had never heard that name until I saw the yellowed newspaper clipping Wes brought. But for Ben… she was a wound he didn’t even know he had. Diana was born in 1985, the eldest daughter of the Rawleys. As far as neighbors recall, she was a quiet girl, with a shy smile and a passionate fascination. Some children love dinosaurs, others firefighters or astronauts, but Diana loved trains. She spent her days drawing, and whenever she could, she went out with her family.

In 1993, when she was eight years old, there was the accident on the District A Line. The train derailed near the south crossing. Two cars toppled. Two children died. Diana and another girl named Sophie Lind. The Rawley family never spoke of it. Never.

Ben was born later and grew up not knowing he had once had a sister...until a month before he disappeared, when he found an album hidden in his parents’ garage. Old photographs, clippings, and a train ticket carefully folded, bearing her name. That’s how he found out. Wes thinks that’s when his obsession began. It wasn’t just about the train, or about the decommissioned line. It was about understanding what had happened to her and maybe, somehow, finding her.

After seeing the clipping, our investigation shifted course. We were no longer chasing an urban ghost; we were trying to follow the trail of a man who wanted to reach someone he loved, even without knowing her.

It was Wes who found the next lead. It didn’t come from a forum, video, or rumor, but from a piece of information forgotten in the corner of an old news article: the name of a man, **Harold Mills.** Conductor. He had been the sole survivor of a very similar accident, years earlier. According to records, he retired early, moved to a house at the edge of town, and never gave interviews again.

— *How the hell did you find this guy?* — Jake asked as we left the city.  
— *I have my own secrets,* — Wes said, trying to sound mysterious.

The silence lasted a few seconds as we stared at him.  
— *My parents have him added on Facebook and told me the story, is that what you wanted to hear?*

Finding him wasn’t hard. Convincing him to receive us was. The house was at the end of a narrow road, surrounded by twisted trees. The paint peeling, windows covered by thick curtains. When he opened the door, I felt as if we had just awakened a piece of history that preferred to remain asleep.

Harold was thin, his skin pale and blotched, but the eyes… the eyes still seemed in command. He didn’t invite us in immediately. He measured us, until Wes said the name no one else dared to speak:

— *Diana Rawley.*

It was as if the air grew heavy. He stepped back, made space, and led us into a room filled with boxes, maps, and black-and-white photographs. On the table lay a cracked leather folder, which he opened carefully. From it, he drew typewritten pages, edges burned, smelling of old paper and smoke.

— *This is what’s left of my testimony,* — he said, voice low, almost to himself. — *Nobody wanted to hear it. Nobody… except the boy.*  
— *Boy?* — I asked.  
— *Yes, the other guy asking about this story. Tall, dark hair, square jaw.*  
— *Ben,* — Jake said.  
— *That’s right, Ben, the brother of poor Diana. Are you investigating together with him? Haven’t seen him in a while.*  
— *Yeah… we are. He wanted us to take a picture of the files.*  
— *The ones he took weren’t enough?*  
— *You know how he is, always deleting files to free up space.*  
— *Yes, I know exactly how that is. Technology always trips me up.*

I skimmed the papers quickly, but every line felt dense with information. In one section, something was underlined:

*“At the last station, there is a room with only one door. It opens on its own when the train stops. Inside, someone unlike anyone you’ve ever seen asks: ‘What is your question?’. You can only ask one, and that… person? Answers you. After that… either you return, or you stay.”*

I glanced over my shoulder and saw Wes and Jake reading that same page. Nobody spoke. The only thing that broke the silence was the wind against the windows. Jake, who until then had remained skeptical, murmured:

— *So that’s it… he wanted to get there to ask about her.*

I wanted to say no, that maybe it was coincidence. But before I could, a rumble vibrated through the wooden floor. It wasn’t wind. It was a metallic echo, distant but recognizable, like iron wheels rolling over invisible tracks.

Harold turned pale.  
— *You need to go. Now.*

The wind carried a sharp, acidic smell of burned iron. And then we saw it: standing in the street, among the fog, a man. Tall, in an old uniform, the fabric torn and stained. The face… blurred, like a wet photograph. He didn’t move, but with every blink, he seemed a little closer.

Wes opened the door without thinking. We ran to the car, slipping on the dirt driveway. When I started the engine, I looked into the rear-view mirror: he was standing in the middle of the road, sideways, as if guarding the way.

It was only when Harold’s house disappeared from the mirror that I realized I was holding the typewritten pages. I don’t remember picking them up. On the last legible line, written by hand in faded ink, there was another phrase, not underlined, but perhaps it should have been:

*“Just be careful not to ask the wrong question.”*

I didn’t sleep that night. Neither did the others. The pages were on the table in the chapel room, and every time I tried to close my eyes, the phrase returned, as if it had been written directly inside my head: *“Just be careful not to ask the wrong question.”*

I didn’t know if it had been exhaustion, Harold’s suggestion, or if we really had seen someone in the street that night. What was certain was that the silence of the town felt larger, as if all sounds were being swallowed by something underground.

The next morning, we met at the same diner where we had already arranged previous meetings. The television behind the counter played commercials without sound. Jake stirred his cold coffee without drinking, Wes seemed unable to stop staring out the window.

— *So that’s it,* he said, breaking the silence. — *There’s a final station. A door. A question.*  
— *A question that must be well thought out,* I said, more to myself than to them.

Jake snorted.  
— *And what are you going to do? Get on that damned train, cross who knows how many haunted stations, and get to the end just to ask a question? That’s not investigation, it’s suicide.*

Wes looked at him, serious.  
— *Do you think Ben thought any differently?*

The name hung among us like a weight. And no one had the courage to answer.

That same afternoon, we went back to the files, this time not to look into Diana’s accident, but into Harold Mills. We wanted to confirm if his testimony had any real basis, or if it was only the delirium of a traumatized man.

It was Amy who brought the missing piece. Without saying much, she appeared with an old envelope, torn at the edges. She said she had found it among some things in the attic. Inside, there were newspaper copies and a single typewritten document, different from the others: a letter signed by another survivor. The name was almost illegible, blurred by some kind of stain, but the text… the text was clear.

*“I reached the last car. I don’t remember how, nor how long it took. But I saw the door. A white door, without a handle. It opened on its own, and on the other side there was someone sitting. It was not a man, not a woman, not a child. It asked only once: What is your question? I didn’t know how to answer. I hesitated. And the door closed. When I woke, I was lying on the roadside, and the train no longer existed.”*

Amy laid the paper on the table and, for the first time, she looked more pale than frightened.  
— *Ben wouldn’t have hesitated,* she said. — *He knew exactly what to ask…*

The terror came that night.

I went back to the chapel alone. Wes and Jake had promised to come by early in the morning. I had stored Mills’s pages and the letter at the bottom of my backpack, but it was useless: something was already awake.

At two in the morning, the noise returned. The same metallic dragging, only closer. More… intimate. The chapel’s wooden floor trembled under my feet as if tracks ran beneath it.

I rushed to the window. The street was empty. But the glass fogged with a warm breath, as if someone had just exhaled against it. And then, slowly, a clean circle appeared in the middle of the misted glass. Someone was drawing…

Two lines. Parallel. Like tracks.

I fell backward, stumbling over the table. The sound grew louder, not just the train, but something coming with it: children’s voices, whispering in chorus, rising higher and higher. I covered my ears, but the words were clear:

— *What is your question?*

When morning came, Jake and Wes found me sitting on the chapel steps, pale, eyes open too wide. I told them everything. They didn’t laugh, they didn’t doubt. On the contrary: Wes only said, with the calm of someone who had already accepted the inevitable:

— *Then we already know. He doesn’t just want us to find the station. He wants us to ask.*

And Jake, even grumbling, couldn’t hide the fear.  
— *What happens if we ‘ask the wrong question’?*

No one answered. Because, deep down, we already knew that the only way to find out… was to get on the train.

We went back to the station as soon as we could. After what had happened to us, there was no room left for escape. The train already knew us. Amy showed up at the last minute. She wore a heavy coat, and her eyes were sunken, opaque, as if insomnia still clung to her. She didn’t say a word until we reached the station yard, where weeds grew through cracks in the concrete.

— *He wanted me to come,* she finally said, and there was no doubt who “he” was.

The air was still. No wind, no insects, no distant sound of the city. Only that oppressive waiting, like a theater ready to raise the curtain.

At midnight, the ground shook. The headlight lit up. And the train was there.

Wes was the first to move, recorder in hand, as if his courage were being borrowed from the dying batteries inside the device. Jake followed, grumbling. Amy and I went last.

The doors opened with the muffled crack of old metal. We stepped in.

The interior was the same: rows of seats, a yellowish glow without source, absolute silence. We sat two by two. Jake with Wes. Me with Amy. The train pulled away slowly, without vibration, without much noise. It was as if we were moving inside a liquid tunnel, without friction, without resistance.

In the third car, behind us, it happened.

The door at the end opened on its own, revealing a corridor darker than the rest of the train, a dense shadow, unnatural, but gradually giving shape to movement. Something was walking toward us. It wasn’t the child-conductor, nor the blurred man. It was… something small in size, but deformed in shape. The skin looked like wet paper, the hands too short for the body.

— *Do you see it?* — Amy whispered, but her voice broke.

The thing stopped in the middle of the corridor. And then it spoke, with a double voice, deep and shrill at the same time:

— *What is your question?*

It was too soon. We weren’t at the “last station.” I knew that. But the voice didn’t stop. It repeated. Louder. Closer.

— *What is your question?*

The entire train shook. The lights flickered. The smell of burnt iron filled our nostrils.

Jake shouted, standing up, but the floor gave way under his feet for an instant, not a hole, not a gap, but as if the metal of the car had turned to liquid. He almost sank. Wes pulled him back, and in that same moment the creature took a step forward, approaching Amy and me.

Its face twisted, as if each blink revealed a different version. Child. Old man. Woman. Man. Empty.

Fear seized me, my vocal cords trembling, and I could only say:  
— *We’re not ready!*

And everything stopped.

The train, the smell, the lights. Even the air seemed frozen.

The creature tilted its head, its eyes two black holes in the misshapen face. And then it smiled.

— *Then learn quickly.*

The next instant, the entire car jolted as if it had derailed. The lights went out. The sound of tearing metal filled the air. I felt my body thrown between the ceiling and the floor of the cabin, hearing my companions suffer the same fate, colliding against the seats and other objects in the car.

We woke with the first rays of sunlight warming our faces, outside the car, thrown into the grass. Amy was curled against me, her eyes still half-closed. For a moment I heard her murmur to me, confusing me with Ben, but I chose to ignore it. I noticed how unsettled she looked when she realized where she was.

Jake woke soon after I did, coughing, spitting grass and dirt, trying to get up without success. Wes still clutched the recorder, his fingers didn’t release it for a long time.

I looked around. There was no train, no trace that it had ever passed through there. Only an open field, tall weeds swaying gently in the morning breeze. The sun was rising with an almost ironic calm, warming our faces as if nothing had happened.

— *This isn’t possible…* Jake muttered, voice hoarse. *It can’t have been real.*

But when he stood up, we saw the marks. On his arm, just above the elbow, was the irregular imprint of fingers. Small, too short, pressure marks—as if something had tried to pull him. And in truth, it had. No one said anything. We walked back to the city on foot in total silence. All the while I felt we were still inside something, that we hadn’t fully left, that perhaps we were only in another of the cars.

When we finally reached the chapel, the heavy air felt suffocating. Amy went home. Jake vanished without saying goodbye. Only Wes stayed with me, and even he seemed distant, his eyes fixed on nothing, as if listening to voices I couldn’t hear.

I entered the main nave alone. The mural I had been restoring awaited me, brushes still wet with paint on the easel. The central figure was Saint Michael the Archangel, sword raised against an enemy who had originally been painted as a dragon. I was in the middle of restoring the face when I noticed.

It was no longer a dragon.

The layers of paint, even those I had never touched, had changed. The painted face looked smudged, as if dampness had warped the original strokes. Black eyes, empty. A faint smile, far too recognizable.

The same smile as the creature in the car.  
I dropped the brush. It hit the floor, splattering red. For an instant, I couldn’t breathe.

On the stone wall, between the cracks, the sound came again. A muffled whisper, repeating, repeating, until it blended with my own breath:

— *What is your question?*

That was only the beginning, and my ordeal had just begun. For the rest of that week, and until all of this reached its end, that voice would persist, tormenting me, demanding a question.
