I accept the love I think I deserve; and I think I don’t deserve my love.
To love myself, I have to be willing. 

Willingly patient, kind, gentle and caring.
I have to willingly be there for myself, to encourage that little 5’0 warrior that she can take another battle.
Forgiving my past self. 
Protecting the peace and joy of my current self.
Supporting the opinions and aspirations of my future self.
 
And yet, I reject my willing love. 
I force my eyes to view the disappointments I constantly make.
My imperfections and mistakes are nothing but  typical and expected. Cause can I really be anything better??

I avoided my image in the mirror, as though meeting my eyes would unravel the truths I’m not ready to face.
My reflection is a shadow, 
an endless reminder of everything I want to hide from the world.

Every black and grey corner is familiar. 
And in there, I have no compassion for my heart. 
No sympathy for the days I aimlessly exist in.  Stagnant. 
Underneath the weight of my persistent fear. 
I’m a withering tree crippled by my shame.

“Why am I still moving in the murky mess, Ive made as my life??”
“You ambitious less fool, there others far a head of you. Do better”

Ive thrown away the responsibility, of my actions and thoughts.
How much longer?? 
I don’t have the strength to bear this spiral of hopelessness and desperation anymore.

“What’s so bad about me?? That I disgust at my own care? “

 I’m rejecting my willing love, because I can’t accept myself. 
My body is poisoned by my its own mind, and my mind is madden because of me.

“OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!” 
“Ladies and gentlemen, the epitome of  worthlessness and undeserving.”
“What’s wrong with you!? 

Alas!
I’ve lost control.
I let of go of my grip once, 
I dropped my shoulders, 
and the warrior stopped screaming.
Alas!
I’ve reached the inevitable void.

“WHY!!!   Why!!?    why?   why, you grating thing?”

I’m forced to become another listless soul.
As I grieve the death of myself, 
I’ve disperse every bit of affection I had.
And see no value in my hatred.
I am BEWILDERED!!!

“Just be like everyone else!” 

I saw myself on the ground, and kicked harder. 
I quenched my thirst with salt.
And crushed my only shelter.
I was like a dog, running back to its vomit.
I’ve ridiculed and starved myself from happiness.

“All you do is provoke!”
“Frustrate and.”
“Disrupt!” 

I’ve shunned myself from society.
I slowly recognise my lies, understanding the intense betrayal and heartbreak. 
I truly am a fool.
I convinced myself to believe I has nothing worth. 
I didn’t trust myself, and I was the only voice I could understand. 
I was never protecting myself. 
That lie was just about as true  as the leading light that would take me to an exist. 

“Nothing more but a nuisance.” 
 
Because of me, I’m stripped to ruins. 
A broken vase, cracking wider every minute. 
Pouring out whatever enters me.
I’ve dammed. 
Left with only an insatiable need,
A bottomless desire to be validated. 
To be something! 
Anything! 
Anything that revokes me of this ridiculed form.
 
Forever cursed as a human, 
My scared heart has been shattered and broken, bruised and frayed.
And the yearn for love still lingers.

“How dare it, how dare you heart!
“HOW DARE YOU!” “Pulse the warmth, of glistening hope.”
“Why?”

In my refusal of self-love, I turned to others. 


“Is someone supposed to change me?” “Can someone change me?”

And Then I left. 
I clang to that fantasy and forgot myself
Leaving my pieces to dry out and disappear.

“turn me from the bad person I am.”
 
I needed validation from someone else. Whatever proof I could get, that I was worth something.

That I was worth the fight, 
worth the joy. 
Then maybe the vexing creature, hungered for attention would disappear. 

But such a satisfaction is limited.

“Come back, you’re supposed to fix me.”

No matter how much i put in, or much I received.
At the end of the day, 
They would leave and would I take myself back. 

No matter the ending, I always find myself alone. 

“Get a life you heedless being!”

I never expect their love back. 
It’s not what i was ever looking for.
What I truly wanted was the my love, the love that I “willingly” gave them. 
I need someone to reciprocate 
the energy I gave up; the thought, and diligence I put in everything.
I wanted what I gave them. 
I needed it back.

My eyes fill up, my hysterical laugh turns into a screech of pain.

I borrow the last hours of the night, gazing over the stars doubtfully hoping to see more than this cycle, maybe there I will find rest.

“No one is coming.”
I cared less anyway.

Perched in the cold, shards of grass my muscles begin to stiff, I can finally hear the little warrior, somethings different she’s not begging for death, she wants out.
She wants me to notice her, 
admire her, 
listen to her.

She wants me.

The cold city breeze brushes against my blatant features, an unbroken obvious force sways in its strokes. 
It pushes me in its lowliness night and for a moment, I desire to be alive. 
Surrendering in the night’s stillness. 
The internal chaos calms.
In the moment, just maybe the World is big enough for me.

But moments don’t last.
