There’s a funny story I was always told as a child—some bullshit about how you can’t go in the attic at night. I was always told that the *Boogeyman* would get ya. Felt ridiculous. It couldn’t possibly be true. Of course, when I was a child, I believed it. As you do when you're a child, just like you believe in Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and all those other fictional characters. That's what the boogeyman was to me. Another member is to be added to the menagerie of creatures within the fictional variety.

But unlike those other fictional creatures, I should have believed my parents. God, I wish I had. If I had, this all could have been avoided. Perhaps I wouldn’t be stuck here typing this as my life ticks down, watching the blood pool around me, filled with regret for my actions over the past 24 hours. But I didn’t.

God damn, this case is a weird one—especially the crime scene itself. The body was torn apart. It took the CSI guys at least an hour or two to piece him together enough to complete the basic report. Hell, they still haven’t decided what killed him; while it’s certain he was torn to utter shreds by something, we’re not sure if that's what killed him or if he was brutalized prior, though we are sure that he was beaten severely within a short period, possibly an hour? And while that’s indeed bizarre, it’s not the weirdest part of the whole thing. The strangest has to be the writing! I mean, what in the hell does it mean? It certainly seems to be a deliberate case, given the mention of a damn ‘boogeyman’ character. (Possibly a home invader? Or maybe some connection to a criminal, given how the parents warded against the ‘boogeyman’?) All we know for sure is that this is a tragedy. This kid went to \[REDACTED\], a fancy \[REDACTED\] sort of place. The thing that scares me about this whole damn thing is that it doesn’t seem to be a unique case. I mean, as I’m writing this, I’ve been called to another scene, and from what I’ve been told so far, it’s a pretty similar murder case. A body torn asunder, with an open and turned-on laptop, opened up to this site that I’m uploading to right now. Hopefully, if this is just a regular (and how in the fuck do you even call something like this normal!) killer, then they’ll look at this post, and they’ll stop what their doing or go into hiding. Either way, if they stop what they're doing, that's better for me because there’ll be no more new bodies, at least that way. But with that, I have to go, John yelling at me to get going. I’ll make sure to update y’all if I find out more.
