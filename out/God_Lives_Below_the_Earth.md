When I was a little boy, my mother taught me that God lived in heaven far away. She taught me that, although distant, God was knocking on the door of my heart, and I just had to open the door to let him in. But when I was a kid, I never felt him knocking. Instead, I would look through my window at the constellations that danced their circuit through the night sky and imagine that my distant God lived among them. Then I imagined that God lived beyond them. And the older and older I got, the further and further away God became.

When I stepped onto the boat for the first time, I wasn’t particularly impressed: keel caked with barnacles and once cheery paints rendered pale imitations of their former selves by decades of exposure to the Atlantic brine. Ugly though it was, the fishing vessel Tarshish bobbed gently in the harbor thirty minutes from my hotel room in Tampa. I knew why the company had opted for a fishing vessel instead of something fast or flashy. It was cheap, sure, but more importantly, it was low profile. The last thing we needed was unwanted attention.

It certainly wasn’t the fanciest (or cleanest) transportation I had ever employed, but it wasn’t all that bad. The crew qualified among the cheerier examples of sailors that I had encountered in my career; most mariners aren’t all too pleased when a corpo diver intrudes upon their solace. Evidently, I had caught them just before payday, and the company’s fee for transporting me would be stacked on top of it. When we returned from this voyage, we would all be considerably richer. Some more than others.

The captain was an old salt dog hardened by a lifetime negotiating the brine, Russ by name. Russ was a stern and stony man until a bottle unscrewed decades of hard living on the open sea. That night, miles out from sea, he cornered me below deck in the mess galley where I was running calculations for the big dive. The sailors were getting hammered in preparation for payday but generally left me alone. Only the cook, Hunter, disturbed my focus by keeping my glass full and my plate loaded. Russ, however, did not share their respect for privacy. I endured his apparently genuine attempts at connecting with me after he occupied the seat next to mine, sipping at an old flask. I answered his probes with grunts or monosyllabic answers until he asked a question that caught me off guard.

“Come again?”

“What do you think about God?” Russ was serious. Here was a grizzled captain of fifty years’ experience inquiring on the religious disposition of his contracted passenger.

“I haven’t thought about God for a while.” I admitted. “I focus a lot on my work.” Russ laughed.

“I guess that makes me lazy to think about him so much!” Russ chortled. “In the open water, sometimes you have nothing but time to think.”

“What do you think about God?” I set down my pen and turned the question back on him.

“Oh, I’m quite sure about it. I’ve met him!” Russ remarked, a broad grin lighting up his flushed face. “Happened when I was just a greenhorn; fell into the water just off Anchorage, almost froze to death then and there.” He paused.

“What happened?” I asked, but Russ held his pause, grasping for words to describe his experience.

“I don’t remember much. I was cold, too cold to swim. Muscles spasming, sinking, sinking deeper. Then warmth, a light in the dark—and a voice. He told me everything would be alright, that he was here for me. I knew I was talking to God.”

“Did he introduce himself?” I asked, somewhat dismissively.

“Didn’t need to—I knew.” He nodded thoughtfully, as if reassuring himself. “I knew it was him.”

I wasn’t lying when I said I hadn’t thought about God for a long time. Russ’ anecdote brought me back to when I was eight. I was sitting in an early morning Sunday school, learning about the fish-god of the Philistines: Dagon. Dagon was a false god; he was an empty idol that people worshiped even though he wasn’t really there. That was the day I asked my Sunday school teacher what made Dagon false and our God real. I still remember the warmth of her smile.

“Because God is knocking on your heart right now, he really wants you to be saved so you can spend forever with him in heaven.”

“How can I know if I’m saved?” I remember asking. Even as a child, my question was not so much motivated by a fear of hellfire as it was a desire for… something.

“Because God really, really loves you. Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart, you just have to let him in. Do you want to say a prayer with me?”

I never felt him knocking. I prayed that prayer half a dozen times; first when I was eight, then nine, then ten, and then at twenty–two, with a useless degree behind me, I decided to take matters into my own hands. If contact with God, with the reality beyond reality, was really on the table, then I would do what I must to have it. I set sail for seminary.

But now I was on a ship headed west. I leaned on the lacquered railing of the fishing vessel’s deck and observed rolling waves of brown and green, the sun high in the sky above me. I realized, rather suddenly, that I was not alone. I glanced up at the avian copilots of our mission, the seagulls which had followed us from shore. The persistent little devils were drawn to leftover fragments of fish whose odor perforated the air. They screamed constantly and scrapped over detritus, but the presence I felt was not seated in the gulls. Glancing around revealed an empty deck, the crew busying themselves below deck, or fore, or aft. The smell of fish, the cries of gulls, and vision of endless sea brought to mind the Lovecraft story Dagon.

My Sunday-school teachers had taught me that Dagon was the fish-god of the Philistines, and the Lovecraft story 2 assured me of the same. My later studies would prove otherwise. Sure, Dagon was worshiped by the Philistines of the bible, but he wasn’t a god of fish, that was a mistranslation because the Hebrew word for fish is “dag.” When they discovered the cult of Dagon, we found that he was a grain god who had nothing to do with the ocean, worshiped first in inland Syria. No, I couldn’t expect to find Dagon in this place, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that somebody was out here with us.

By dusk we had reached our destination: just about the center of the Gulf of Mexico. The sun was beginning its habitual descent toward the horizon; the last, gentle rays painted my face orange and violet, the heat gently stung my skin. Soon, on this summer’s new-moon night, the only lights for miles around would be our humble vessel and the distant stars above who watched over all of humankind with silent disregard.

I was joined at the rail by several sailors as the sun’s light faded and a new sun became visible to us. Not in the sky, not along the horizon, but below the water. We stared down into the abyss and a yellow light in the void stared back. It diffused softly through the otherwise inky depths, transforming, by some lost alchemy, black water into crystal jade. The sailors regarded it with suspicion, murmuring among themselves about the presence which intruded on their silent night. I suppose corporate hadn’t seen fit to key them in on what exactly we’re doing out here. While the others were unsure of how to regard the unexpected phenomenon, I found the source of that feeling—that feeling that we were not alone—finally localized in the light itself. I was overcome with the strongest sensation that it wanted to meet me, and it beckoned me closer.

I complied. Thirty minutes later, I was in the water. The atmospheric diving suit occluded much of my peripheral vision, but I was able to orient myself by following the soft rays to the golden light. It was gentle and inviting, a long-lost friend waiting for me at the bottom of the ocean. Distracted though I was, I made certain that the umbilical which would feed me a steady diet of atmosphere was secure and that my reserve oxygen tanks were ready. After signaling a thumbs-up to the sailors above and patting the tools on my belt to ensure their security, I answered the light’s invitation and began the dive.

The waters shifted and shimmered from crystal green to aquamarine around me. The sea parted for my passage closer and closer to my luminous friend as I strove down, down, down. Blue lights seemed to blip in and out of the periphery of my vision, stars emerging to dance with their underwater sun on its circuit under the earth. The kelp, mansions of those bioluminescent krill, extended their hands to pull me deeper into their home, children eager to show off their room and toys to a new friend. Shadows of fish and sharks drifted lazily in the green, but never did they dare trespass into the cone of yellow light that illumined me as I went deeper. I saw a manta ray, ten feet wide, drift past me, unaware of or apathetic to my presence there. I saw horsefish pull their young along in a line around the stalks of lambent seaweed and fish full of eggs searching for a place to nest among them. A massive thing was floating to my left; I took my eyes off the light to see a sperm whale floating vertically, one eye watching solemnly as I entered its home. The monolithic cyclops hung inert in the water and sang a hymn to some or another diluvian idol, a blessing upon its strange new guest.

I was struck with wonder at the life in this alien place that I had trespassed upon: a garden of trees of life and two of every animal. Eclipsing them all was the light: all of the goodwill that I felt from the denizens of the deep were reflections, I knew, of the lull that pulled me deeper still. The deeper I went, the stronger that lull became. I felt my face flush and my stomach flutter—whether from pressure or desire I do not know—I was infatuated with the light, that new sun that I had discovered waiting for me far below the earth.

Long before Babylon was built, the Mesopotamians worshiped Enki, god of the deep. Enki lived far below the earth in a freshwater aquifer cut from the corpse of a cosmic monster. Enki was the giver of life; he sent forth the fresh water that fertilized the fertile crescent and allowed human civilization to flourish. When the mythic hero Gilgamesh sought immortality, it was in the subterranean realm of Enki that he found it. Sinking through the garden below the waves, I believed it. If the source and sustenance of life was to be found anywhere, it would surely be here.

“Jonah!” Russ’ sharp voice startled me from my trance.

“Go ahead.” I answered the captain through my radio but continued my descent.

“We’ve got a problem topside, you need to start making your way back up.”

“Problem?” I paused annoyedly, watching life teem through the garden. “What problem?”

“There’s a grease fire in the kitchen, we gotta get you back up in case we lose power.”

“Well,” I paused. The lull diminished slightly. “Alright. How bad is it?”

“Hunter’s trying to control the fire, but I’m not taking any chances. You’d better get up here.”

“Copy that, on my way.” I took one last look at the light: its warmth continued to beckon but the lull that invited me deeper was noticeably less intense now. I felt cold as I began my ascent apologetically. I wondered if it would miss me as much as I missed it.

By the time I reached the ship, the fire was out. I was beyond frustrated: the inconvenience felt as though I had been kept from the arms of a lover. My frustration was probably palpable as I hung over the rail of the ship and looked down at the distant, glowing object of my affections. It looked back, and the sailors gathered around me like the flies that attended fragments of fish and flesh in the corners of the deck.

“What is it?” A feminine voice asked as we all looked down at our new sun. Jenny was the only woman on board, and she sounded genuinely curious as she took a break from slurping down a milkshake to ask her question, her lips puffed out from contact with the sweet treat.

“Policy dictates that I cannot disclose the identity of the asset.” I answered robotically. In truth, corporate had told me very little about the target of my recovery mission, no doubt they had kept the sailors completely in the dark.

“I heard it singin’ to me,” someone in the group said a little too loud. “Singin’ like ma used to, it sang my favorite songs. Made me feel like I was back home again, said I was… safe.”

“I dreamed a dream about it,” emboldened by the witness, another sailor spoke up. “It was like a big, bright father to me. Said it was proud of me, told me to quit drinkin’ so hard.”

“I felt it too,” Jenny said, adding her paper cup to the litter of the ocean. “It was… I never felt anything like it. It was… well, it was an experience.”

Experience. The desire to experience God had led me to that seminary which had occupied three years of my life. Once I arrived, I realized that I was the odd man out. Most of my peers were there because they had already experienced something in their life that they described as contact with God. Despite how common it was in our cohort, I had never enjoyed such an experience, and it wasn’t for lack of trying. I had tried meditation, I had tried prayer—so much prayer. As my studies advanced, I tried to replicate the practices of the Desert Fathers, the first monks, and their precursors in the Syrian wilderness; I studied the deep contemplation of Catholics in the West and the hesychast meditation of Orthodoxy in the east, all to no avail. No matter how much I knocked on God’s door, he never once answered. So, after three years of study and prayer, I laid down my books, and I think I laid God down with them.

When I laid myself down in my bunk, the creak of the rocking ship my only lullaby, I thought I would have dreamed of my rendezvous in the deep, of the lover’s lull that called to me even as my eyelids drifted shut. My rest, however, was dark and deep and dreamless. When the rising sun disturbed my rest, it was time for dive two.

This time I went deeper. Beyond that Eden, the aquamarine sea bled black. Inky darkness cut the verdant wake to ribbons that spiraled deeper, deeper, deeper. Deeper is where life ceased. The bioluminant stars did not follow me, no denizens of saltwater paradise danced around me. Detritus alone offered me company, flesh from a million dead fish mingled together in a nondescript chum. Although the webbed appendages of some unknown creature would occasionally spill over the edge of the cone of light, nothing ever emerged from the dark to claim their bloodless eucharist and commune with the gristle of the sea.

The darkness pressed against the cone of light that protected me, undulating like tentacles of an antediluvian kraken, wordlessly striving to overpower my shield and add my flesh to the chum. But then the detritus dissipated, the alien limbs no longer trespassed on the edges of the light’s gaze. Without the living or the dead to keep me company, I was alone. The darkness continued to press inward on the cone of light; the dominance of my lambent friend seemed threatened by the pressure of a trillion gallons of darkness pressing down on it. I became terribly afraid that the deep darkness would choke out the light entirely and I would be left alone in the great and terrible deep. Yet the lull of that lover far below beckoned me still into the dark, stronger than it had ever been, and the lull overcame all fear.

When Moses ascended the holy mountain, he followed a great light. The mountain was on fire, the people were afraid and refused to go any closer. But following the fire, Moses met the Lord in a cloud of glory. He passed into the cloud, and he was consumed by divine darkness. If God is light, then he needs a cloak of inscrutable darkness to shield him from our prying eyes. Otherwise, I suppose, we would all cease to be. It isn’t for man to set eyes upon the infinite, my pastors and my professors had assured me as much. So as I entered the dark cloud of glory, I interrogated the light: “Who are you?”

I’m not sure I expected an answer, like Moses at the burning bush, but I got one. The light blinked. Then it sputtered. Then all my fears came true: it died.

I cannot describe the darkness in words, only that it seemed as if I was suspended in frozen blackness. My heart skipped, my insides roiled, nausea and fear and trembling seized command of inert limbs. The deep had opened its mouth wide to swallow me whole: and its jaws had just snapped shut. In the belly of that whale, I sank.

Time stopped even though I didn’t: while I was sure I was passing deeper and deeper still, I couldn’t tell how long I had been falling. A minute? An hour? Forever? Impact startled me from the spiral as my feet hit bottom. My momentum carried me down and my back thudded against the shale of whatever diluvian soil I had struck. I laid there, staring upwards, immobile. I supposed that beyond my gaze, far above the black coffin that entombed me, the sun was again setting again on the land of the living while I lay in the realm of the dead, the miscarried infant of a god I did not know. Surely this is how the Psalmist felt when he looked up from the valley of death and begged for mercy from his distant God.

But as I lay in the darkness, cruciform across a rocky shoal, I realized that even in the dark the lover was beckoning me still. The absence of the light had done nothing to deter the lull, and it beckoned me forward into darkness with greater intensity than I had felt before. My tastebuds shivered with the taste of sweetness and copper, my heart fluttered with anticipation instead of fear, my face flushed. With great effort, I sat, then I stood, then I put one foot in front of the other. The lights on my dive suit were barely enough to illuminate my immediate surroundings: white sand beneath my feet offered the palest reflection as I took step after labored step. No direction seemed better than the other, but the lover’s lull pulled me that way, and I followed.

I trespassed into the darkness and a form loomed into view at the edge of my vision, the fruit of my labored steps. A riveted metal hull, blanketed in part by extremophile algae, rose far upwards and outwards and forwards, a fellow alien in this foreign land. I placed my left hand on the hull and guided myself along its length. Painted letters drifted into sight one by one: “U.S.S. Cetus.” I had found my quarry. Tracing the hull on my left, I trudged forward in search of access to the wreck. My progress was interrupted when something else came into view on my right: this too was huge and metal and monolithic. Another wreck? What are the odds? But as I stepped closer to the cyclopian object I saw that it could not have been man-made.

Angular, colossal, unnatural: the leviathan object embedded in the silt and shale was cocked to one side at an 80-degree angle. Its surface was sheer, a perfect corner dividing one side from the other, but each face was pock-marked; holes burrowed into the burnished metal in hives as far as I could see. No deepsea algae dared attend the object: its surface was completely clean. By the light of my suit alone I could not tell how far it extended in any direction, but the USS Cetus had sunk directly adjacent to it.

The lover’s lull tore my attention away from the colossal thing. The object of my desire was still in the ship, this new discovery would have to wait. Walking forward, a gash in the hull of the Cetus limped into view through the silty gloom. The horizontal rip in the vessel was bent inward at the edges; vertical ribs of reinforcing metal that had once held the hull rigid protruded from the lips like hooked teeth as I set foot inside the mouth of the great dead thing.

Every inch of the ship was waterlogged, but even in its sunken state, something in the back of my mind expected to meet others roaming the halls. That same something told me that behind the closed doors I passed by, the proud crew was still occupied with their duties about the stalwart vessel. I moved as quietly and quickly as I could to avoid disturbing them; here I was, a stowaway. Hallway stretched into hallway until the lull led me to the ship’s secure holding facility.

The vault was impressive; riveted metal bars reinforced the steel panels which surrounded the circular vault door, adorned with an equally impressive vault wheel. I patted the tools on my belt as I approached: pressure-proofed powerdrill, waterproofed data key, various accouterments to get into places designed to keep you out, all useless now because the vault door hung open. Fingers of yellow light slipped weakly under the rim of the vault door: the pressure of the sea had cracked the safe for me. I pushed the door open further and the light intensified, but only slightly. I noted that the mechanized hydraulics which once locked the door into place had been shorn clean. My humble divesuit had yet to buckle under the pressure of the sea, had this mighty mechanism suffered such a catastrophic failure under these same conditions? I pushed the door further and it complied with little resistance. The room grew brighter still as its sole occupant came into view: a gold sphere the size of a cantaloupe suspended in a glass canister that terminated into a carrying handle on either side.

The light flickered tiredly; it had expended so much effort to guide me down here that, I felt, it was exhausted. The texture of its surface was imperfect: its lambent skin was hammered gold, scored by fingerprint-like ripples traced by incandescent silver. Smooth symbols in an unknown script flowed like water with the pattern of the fingerprints; instructions or blessings or warnings or curses. The glass tube had survived the pressure which had rocked even the great door, though it had been cracked. I approached the asset and grasped the carrying handles. The light faded further, panting with exhaustion, but I had the striking sense in my lizard-brain that it was relieved by my touch.

And yet the force continued to pull, the same lover’s lull, back the way I had come, back out the maw of the sunken Cetus; back toward, I already knew, the pockmarked metal thing. Whatever and whoever it might be, the lover’s lull was not seated inside the precious thing that I now held in both hands. Shivering weakly, I surrendered entirely to the lull; my limbs felt moved by an unseen current as I retraced my steps past the halls of busy drowned sailors until the inert wreck spat me out again, and I was face to face with the cockeyed object sitting in the silt.

A wound in the object: ten feet wide and thirty tall, directly across from the opening in the hull of the Cetus. How did I miss it the first time? The human vessel was forgotten, the asset in my hands faded from memory: the lover’s lull pulled me into the opening. Even though I knew my orders were to resurface with the asset intact to prepare for extraction, I disregarded those orders. This was more important.

A room stretched infinitely into darkness in every direction. The floor was made of the same pockmarked meteorite as the rest of the structure, but no walls could be seen. It was an abyss of its own in here; no bubbles in the water, no life except my own. I walked toward nothing but the lull while the asset in my hands glowed as my only sputtering light. The golden sphere fluttered in its new environment like an exhausted dog carried home from a long walk. With its own wordless voice, distinct from the lover’s lull, it whispered sweet, wordless things in my head. My mind’s eye saw visions and dreamed dreams: hurtling through a dark void, diving below deep water, impact. Death, so much death—and then life. Mammals growing up much too quickly, hominids dividing themselves from apes, dancing, dancing: dancing around fires, dancing under golden stars: love.

Then I saw the stars with my own eyes: golden stars, true gold each one, dancing in a circuit on what seemed to be a wall some hundred yards ahead of me that stretched from an unseen ceiling down to the nickel-burnished floor. The golden stars arced downward on the left side of the wall and disappeared into the floor, only to emerge on the right side in an upward swing before repeating their orbit all over again. The asset danced too in its glass shell, rolling from one side of the tube to the other, longing to join its friends in their eternal circuit. I was caught up with a feeling of sympathy for the inanimate object in my possession, and so I retrieved the crowbar from my belt with one hand and liberated the gilded sphere from its cage. Freed from its prison, the asset was pulled by some force—perhaps the lover’s lull itself—towards the constellation.

A tear fell from my eye as it rejoined its friends; I knew, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the other spheres were overjoyed to see their sibling returned to them safely. I felt in the deepest part of my soul that the blinking lights of the spheres closest to the returned expatriate were worried mothers and concerned sisters that cooed and doted on the prodigal son as they abandoned their ordinary course to orbit a new constellation around the lost lamb. They spoke in a language I could not hear, but I longed to listen in on the excited chatter that doubtless occupied them.

A door: black and rock and just my height, just wide enough to pass through comfortably. It sat in the center of the circuit of gold stars. My attention was drawn from the sibling spheres to whatever lay behind its threshold. It had never been the missing gold star or the rest of its constellation which had beckoned me here: the lover was on the other side of this door, and not just a lover: father, mother, brother, sister,

Friend.

What had begun as a low-resolution lull, a thing that stimulated feelings of infatuation and desire, a feeling which had carried me down to this place, transformed now into something else, into an invitation. It felt as though I had done a kindness to my neighbor, and now they invited me in for coffee. Somebody, it seems, wanted to talk to me.

The door: something diffused into the water from its seams; not light, not dark, impossible to describe: color of water; perfect vision; thunder. It heaved rhythmically in and out; seizing, breathing, like a living thing. Rumble of stone grating stone; basalt skin tattooed with a hundred angular symbols. The glyphs resembled what I had seen on the golden asset, but instead of logograms lovingly inlaid in gold, these symbols were older, colder, hewn into black rock. They must have predated those on the asset; their shapes were more angular, better suited to a crude chisel than a metallurgist’s fine implements, remnants of a stone age long before man and ape parted ways. The resemblance of the glyphs on the door to those on the asset offered only one conclusion: the sinking of the U.S.S. Cetus had been no accident. The asset had drifted close to home, and the lover’s lull had coaxed the ship into the black depths.

I knew that just across this threshold was a whole other world, busily ordering itself as it had since before the dawn of life. No doubt a busy parliament of supercelestial intelligences, antediluvian sages, and paracosmic artists were hard at work sustaining the universe with colors I could not even imagine. I could poke my head in unnoticed, just for a moment, a solitary anthropoid lost in a cosmic orchestra. Maybe the celestial things wouldn’t even notice me, I could steal a glance, sate my desire, and be gone in a moment. Maybe I could even say a quick “hello” to the lover, to the friend, and be on my way. I balled a fist and poised my hand to knock on the heaving door—and I hesitated.

Did I really want to see what was going on beyond this door? Was I really prepared to poke my head into infinity? Had I really come to the very doorstep of God—and been found wanting? No sound: absolute silence. The door breathed on its own: steady, steady; it had been doing so for all time. I mistook its breathing for my own.

My hand fell to my side. If I opened that door, that great and terrible door, I would never come back, not the same. I turned around, sanity intact, and trudged back toward the wound I had entered from, and the lover’s lull ceased. I turned and stole a glance at the dancing yellow stars. Somehow I knew that the asset, the golden dancer which I had returned home, was that star, that one to the left whose comrades still clung tightly to it, still busily fretting over its return and afraid to let it go again. The stars called out profuse and silent “thank-yous,” and it broke my heart to move on. “Next time!” I promised them. “I’ll stay next time! I have some things I need to take care of.” The stars flickered, they asked me with the tearful innocence of children: “Do you promise?”

Leaving that place almost killed me; the ascent literally almost killed me; I moved too quickly and the depressurization was too much to bear. But the Tarshish picked me up, took me to port, and left the unopened door and its subterranean temple behind.

A week into my stay at Nineveh County Hospital, a couple of suits paid me a visit. The company wasn’t happy with losing its asset, which, I had reported, had been destroyed by the pressure. I was informed that my hospital bills would be my own responsibility and that I shouldn’t expect any more work from them. I get the feeling they expected me to be angry, disappointed, but I honestly didn’t see what the big deal was. There were bigger things in the world than money and health. Breathing in the sweet and fragrant air of a maritime hospital, I laid in that bed; I, a misbegotten child of a realm nobody else had ever seen, an augur of a God I had dared not look upon, and I was alive.

The nurse who checks on me laughed at a dumb joke I told, I think I’ll buy her a drink when I’m out of here. The job boards I’ve been browsing show openings for scuba diving instructors: that sounds like fun. The sun rose one morning and again the next; I saw it all again for the first time.

As for the lover’s lull, I feel it still, but it doesn’t invite me back into the ocean. It encourages me to talk to the homeless guy outside my grocery store, to volunteer at church, to pet the stray cats that beg for morsels of food. I never learned its name, never looked behind the door, but I knew it was God. I don’t know if God is the reality beyond reality or the still small voice that whispers in our fledgeling ears, not yet grown enough to listen. All I know is that God lives behind a door, far below the earth, and I do not need to knock any more.
