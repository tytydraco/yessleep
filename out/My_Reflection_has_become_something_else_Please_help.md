My first encounter with the reflection happened three weeks ago, though it feels like a lifetime.

It was a Tuesday night, and I’d just come home from a mind-numbing double shift. I live alone in a dingy, one-bedroom apartment downtown, and as I kicked off my boots and stumbled into the bathroom, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror above the sink. It wasn’t unusual to look worse for wear after work, but that night, my reflection seemed… off.

My face wasn’t just tired—it was sagging. My skin hung loosely, as if gravity had taken an extra toll on my flesh. My eyes, sunken and dark, stared back with an intensity that didn’t feel like my own. And then, just as I leaned closer to inspect the sickly pallor of my cheeks, my reflection smiled.

I didn’t smile. I know I didn’t.

The corners of its mouth stretched upward in a way that felt unnatural, almost painful. The teeth that grinned back at me were jagged and yellowed, and the gums bled as the grin widened. I stumbled backward, slamming my hip against the sink. When I looked again, it was just me.

Shaking it off as exhaustion and stress, I went to bed. But I couldn’t sleep.

The next few days were a blur of unease. Every time I glanced at a reflective surface—windows, puddles, even the sheen of a freshly polished countertop—I’d see something. At first, it was fleeting, barely perceptible. A shadow moving where there shouldn’t be one. A pair of eyes lingering a second too long after I’d turned my head.

Then it became undeniable.

I was washing dishes when I saw it clearly for the first time. The stainless steel of the faucet reflected my face as I leaned over the sink, scrubbing a particularly stubborn stain. I didn’t even realize I was looking until it moved.

My reflection didn’t mimic my actions—it didn’t even try. It tilted its head to the side, eyes narrowing as if studying me. Then it opened its mouth wide, impossibly wide, stretching its jaw until the skin around it began to tear.

I froze, my hands trembling in the soapy water. The reflection leaned closer, its mouth gaping wider and wider until I thought its head might split in two. And then, it started screaming.

The sound wasn’t audible—it was silent. But I felt it. A piercing, reverberating shriek that seemed to resonate inside my skull. My nose started to bleed, a thick, warm trickle that dripped into the soapy water below.

I bolted from the kitchen, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath.

By the second week, I’d covered every reflective surface in my apartment. Mirrors, windows, even the glass panel of my oven. But it didn’t help.

I started seeing them in other places—car windows as I walked down the street, the glossy black screen of a powered-off television, even the eyes of strangers passing me by.

They weren’t just distortions of me anymore. The faces in the reflections were grotesque, malformed. One had no eyes, just hollow, weeping sockets that leaked a thick, tar-like substance. Another’s jaw was unhinged, hanging limply as if the tendons had rotted away.

And then there were the things that weren’t faces at all.

Once, as I walked past a rain-slicked storefront, I saw a towering figure standing behind me in the reflection. It was impossibly tall, its limbs too long, its fingers twitching like spider legs. Its head was a mess of writhing black tendrils, and its eyes—if you could call them that—were pinpricks of red light buried deep within the chaos.

I spun around, heart pounding, but there was nothing there.

The worst night came two days ago.

I’d barely slept in weeks, my nerves frayed to the breaking point. I’d taken to drinking myself into a stupor just to dull the constant anxiety. That night, I’d polished off half a bottle of whiskey before stumbling into the bathroom.

I’d forgotten about the mirror above the sink, the one I’d taped over during my initial panic. The tape had peeled away in the humidity, leaving a jagged section of glass exposed.

I made the mistake of looking.

It was me, but not. My reflection was bloated, its skin a mottled grayish-green, as if it had been left to rot in stagnant water. Its eyes were missing, replaced by writhing, black worms that spilled out and wriggled down its cheeks. It leaned closer, pressing its forehead against the glass as it grinned that same jagged, bleeding grin.

Then it began to speak.

Its voice was a low, guttural rasp, like the sound of nails dragged across a chalkboard submerged in mud. I couldn’t understand the words, but they filled me with a dread so profound it felt like my soul was being squeezed in a vice.

And then it reached for me.

A hand, bloated and dripping with black ichor, pushed through the glass as if it were water. I stumbled backward, slipping on the tiled floor as the hand groped blindly for me. Its touch was ice-cold, and where its fingers grazed my skin, it burned like acid.

I screamed, kicking and scrambling away as the rest of its body began to emerge. I could hear the sound of glass splintering, the wet, squelching noise of its flesh peeling free.

Somehow, I managed to grab the edge of the door and pull myself out of the bathroom. I slammed the door shut and barricaded it with a chair, my heart hammering so hard I thought it might burst.

I haven’t gone back into the bathroom since. I’ve barely left my apartment, terrified of what I might see in the outside world.

The reflections are everywhere now. I can feel them watching me, their silent screams reverberating in my skull. They want something from me—I don’t know what, but I can feel their hunger.

Last night, I covered every inch of my apartment in duct tape, blankets, and cardboard. There’s not a single reflective surface left.

But it doesn’t matter.

Because now, when I close my eyes, I see them staring back at me from the darkness.

I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. Even with every surface covered, I could feel the weight of their presence pressing down on me. It wasn’t just paranoia—it was tangible, like static electricity building in the air before a storm.

At some point, I drifted off, slumped against the wall with a baseball bat in my lap. I woke to the sound of faint tapping.

It came from the bathroom door.

I froze, gripping the bat so tightly my knuckles turned white. The tapping was slow, deliberate. Tap, tap, tap. A pause. Then it started again, more insistent this time.

I stared at the door, heart pounding, trying to convince myself it was nothing. Maybe a leaky pipe or the apartment settling. But deep down, I knew better.

Then the whispering started.

It wasn’t loud—just a faint, raspy murmur that I could barely make out over the blood rushing in my ears. The words were unintelligible, but they carried a sickening, almost melodic cadence. Like a lullaby sung by something that had never known peace.

I tried to block it out, pressing my hands over my ears, but the whispers grew louder, more insistent. They weren’t just coming from the bathroom anymore—they were everywhere. In the walls, the ceiling, the very air around me.

“Come see.”

Two words, clear as day, spoken in a voice that wasn’t mine.

I don’t know why I stood up. My body felt like it was moving on its own, my legs carrying me toward the bathroom door even as my mind screamed at me to stop. The bat slipped from my hands and clattered to the floor.

The tapping had stopped, replaced by an eerie, oppressive silence. My hand trembled as I reached for the doorknob, every instinct telling me to run, to get out of the apartment and never look back. But I didn’t.

I opened the door.

The bathroom was pitch black, the lightbulb overhead shattered. But the mirror—it was glowing. A faint, sickly pale light emanated from the glass, casting distorted shadows on the walls.

The reflection wasn’t mine.

It was a child.

A little girl, no older than six, stood in the mirror. Her skin was pale, almost translucent, and her hair hung in damp, matted clumps around her face. Her eyes were wide, staring directly at me, and her mouth was sewn shut with thick, black thread.

She raised a hand, pressing her palm against the glass. Black veins spread out from her fingertips, spiderwebbing across the surface. Then for a moment, I thought I saw something behind her—a towering figure, its head brushing the top of the mirror, its limbs impossibly thin and elongated.

The girl’s sewn mouth began to move, the thread pulling and tearing at her skin as she tried to speak. Blood trickled down her chin, thick and dark, pouring from her chin and down her neck.

“Help… me…”

The words were faint, barely a whisper, but they sent a chill down my spine.

I wanted to run. I wanted to slam the door shut and pretend I hadn’t seen anything. But I couldn’t.

The girl’s hand pushed harder against the glass, and the mirror began to crack. The light grew brighter, more blinding, until I had to shield my eyes. When I looked back, the girl was gone.

The mirror was empty.

Then I felt it—a hand on my shoulder.

It wasn’t warm. It wasn’t even cold. It was… wrong. The sensation was indescribable, like my skin was being touched by something that wasn’t meant to exist in this world.

I turned around slowly, every muscle in my body screaming in protest.

The thing standing behind me wasn’t human.

Its face was a grotesque amalgamation of features, as if someone had taken parts of a dozen different people and stitched them together. Its eyes were too large, bulging out of their sockets, and its mouth was a gaping, toothless maw that stretched across half its face.

It didn’t move, but I could feel its presence pressing down on me, suffocating me.

And then it spoke.

“You let us in.”

The voice wasn’t one voice—it was a chorus. A thousand voices, all speaking in unison, some high-pitched and childlike, others deep and guttural.

I stumbled backward, my foot catching on the edge of the tub. I fell, hitting my head against the tiled floor. Pain exploded in my skull, and for a moment, everything went dark.

When I came to, I was no longer in my apartment.

The world around me was a twisted, distorted version of my bathroom. The walls were covered in pulsating, fleshy growths, oozing a thick, black liquid that dripped onto the floor. The air was heavy with the stench of decay, and the faint sound of distant screams echoed all around me.

The mirror was gone, replaced by a gaping hole in the wall that seemed to stretch on forever. I could see shapes moving within it—twisting, writhing figures that seemed to shift and change with every passing second.

And then I heard the whispering again.

“Come see. Come see. Come see.”

The figures in the hole began to emerge, crawling out of the darkness like spiders. Their bodies were grotesque, malformed—limbs bending in ways they shouldn’t, faces twisted into expressions of eternal agony.

I tried to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. The floor beneath me was soft, sticky, like flesh, and it seemed to pull me down with every step.

The figures surrounded me, their whispers growing louder, more frenzied. One of them leaned in close, its face inches from mine. Its eyes were empty sockets, and its breath reeked of rot.

“You belong to us now.”

I screamed, thrashing against their grasp as they dragged me toward the hole. The darkness swallowed me whole, and for a brief, fleeting moment, I felt nothing. No pain, no fear—just a void.

But then I opened my eyes.

And I was back in my apartment.

Everything looked normal—no fleshy walls, no oozing black liquid. But the mirror was still shattered, and in every shard of glass, I could see them watching me.

They’re still here.

And I know now that they’ll never leave.

Because when I look in the mirror, I don’t see myself anymore.

I see them.
