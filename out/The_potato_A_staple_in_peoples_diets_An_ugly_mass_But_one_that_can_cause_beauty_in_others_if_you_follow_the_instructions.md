Me and my friend, let’s call her Melinda were outcasts. No boys were ever interested in us in high school. Or college. Or even now in our mid 20s.   


We were lovers of the strange, the weird, the occult. Which is why when a new store opened at the edge of town with no name and windows that obscured you from gazing in at the commodities, we had to go along.   


We walked into the store, the ground around it surprisingly dry and cracked despite living in Oregon. Perhaps the chemicals they used while painting the putrid green outer shell leached into the ground. It also disgusted at the colour. As we entered it was quiet, and no cashier? In fact there wasn’t even a till or counter that I could see. There was all nature of things. Packets of Vitamin Powder labelled ‘vitamin H’ which were a bright purple as if it was shouting at you that it most likely contained a bunch of E numbers. Lemons placed individually in a jar with a skull and cross bones. And lastly a basket of potatoes which were labelled ‘name your price’. A bunch of quirky things that had *no actual value*.  


Melinda picked one of the potatoes up, the least attractive item on offer and as a joke we left the store with it paying nothing as after all it was ‘name your price’, making sure to pick up the complimentary instruction manual. An instruction manual for a potato.  


We couldn’t wait to get home and see if something peculiar might happen as surely it wasn’t just a potato. So we sat outside the shop and placed the potato on the floor staring at it as if we expected it to magically perform some sort of act for us, Because Melinda an I were not a fan of *reading instructions* and expected everything to happen miraculously. But alas the potato did nothing so we had to open the manual.   


“Want to be beautiful?”  
   


Was the potato reading our minds? It made me question if that Kombucha we had drank earlier was in fact kombucha and not some sort of hallucinogenic. We continued reading as why not?  


“Open the back of the potato and remove pins and desired features”  


We did not care to question the absurd instructions and opened the back of the potato which seemed to have a little door which it certainly didn’t have before. Melinda pulled out some pins and the ‘desired features’ which were large luscious lips, pink like the roses that grew around the house opposite us. Home to the most beautiful woman, one that we wished we looked like. The next feature a small button nose followed by fox eyes. Ingredients for the most beautiful woman in our eyes.  


The next step. “Prick finger with one of the pins and place blood on the top of the potato”  


Melinda did this, the blood somehow absorbing into the potato. The next step instructed us to pin the desired features on the potato. She pinned the lips, eyes and nose onto it. And waited. Soon her whole face began to transform, warping and twisting from her previous appearance to the new ‘improved’ look. I was horrified but intrigued at the same time, was beauty this simple? But although she loved the look she wanted *more*, before I could even have a turn.   


She removed the features from the potato ready to put even better ones in their place. But she should have read the warning at the beginning of the manual.  


“Under no circumstances remove desired features from the potato once placed”  


I read this but it was too late. The new features upon her face began to decay, rotting like a corpse. Falling upon the floor, I froze in shock, what on earth was happening? Her face now completely blank. Just skin. And slight indents where her nose, mouth and eyes would have been. The potato opposite her now a spitting image.

She stood up grabbing at the air to find her way and tripped on the potato. She fell snapping her neck. I called for an ambulance but when they arrived they just examined her and turned to me and said ‘silly girls playing with potatoes’ and smiled. A smile that still haunts me to this day. The police were on scene too, and they said the same thing to me.  


&#x200B;

They also said that no one would be able to identify her. She had no face. And she wasn’t a fan of dentists. I was left on the edge of town with Melindas body, had the whole town gone crazy?   


I left town immediately. I couldn’t stay there. And I haven’t been back since. But every time I see that ugly root vegetable I remind myself that although I may not be a model. Playing with things you don’t understand to achieve beauty is not the way to go.
