For any of this to make sense, you will need to read the two previous posts I made. I will link them in order, so click here [first]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1og49ml/something_is_off_about_the_video_rental_store_in/?share_id=VPJ7q8I-uzbNIUHSnBOdv&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) and then this one [second]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oh411g/i_discovered_something_dangerous_about_the_video/?share_id=9rF18ZENLlF__ewB3R82q&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1).



I fully intended to go to the police after making my last post, I really did.  When I woke up this morning, I told myself I was done with it all and that I’d hand over the tape, explain everything, and finally let someone else deal with whatever the hell was happening at Final Cut Video. 

But when I walked out to my car after work, I saw that it had been broken into. 

The driver-side door was hanging wide open, and the glove compartment was torn apart, papers and miscellaneous junk were strewn everywhere. The seats were slashed with giant gashes, foam spilling across the floor. 

Whoever did this wasn’t after money. They were searching for something.  I put two and two together and realized that the people responsible were looking for the VHS tape. 

They were trying to cover their tracks. 

I raced home and discovered that my car hadn’t been the only thing ransacked. 

The front door was cracked; the lock completely splintered from the force of the impact to break in. Various drawers had been opened and their contents dumped onto the floor.  My wallet, my laptop, my TV, and everything else of value was still there. The only thing missing was the tape.

The idea that they knew I was going to go to the police with it terrified me. They had always been one step ahead of me, but not this time.

I grabbed the baseball bat from my room and double checked that I had my phone before getting back into my car. Confronting them as a collector or customer wasn’t my intention. Instead, I was going in as someone who wanted the truth and would do anything to get it. 

They weren’t going to stop me from getting that tape back.

At around 5 P.M., I pulled into the parking lot of  “Final Cut Video”. I had barely parked my car before I got out and stormed towards the entrance, bat in hand. 

I opened the door, the rows of tapes in the “NEW ARRIVALS” section seemed to glare at me. The aroma of old tape polish made me grimace, and the lighting reflected off the plastic cases in a way that made the titles shimmer. 

With clammy hands, I wielded the bat and scanned my surroundings for the first signs of anything suspicious. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw the movement of something slipping between the aisles, but when I turned, there was nothing there. Maybe it was just my nerves, but my gut told me that they knew I was coming.

“Back for another film?” I about jumped out of my skin, Fulci was standing mere inches away from me.

“No…actually, I…I need answers. Now.” I said, steadying my hands around the bat.

His eyes narrowed, and he smiled like he knew a secret that I didn’t. “Oh? What do you want to know?”

I swallowed, feeling my throat tighten. “I know what happens in those tapes…Roth…he—he murdered those kids in the Summerbrook tape. And Hooper…her family…you—you murdered them.”

His voice dropped an octave, but the amusement in his tone was unmistakable. “I didn’t murder anyone, I was creating art. Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made for your craft.”

“For God’s sake, these are people! This goes beyond making movies.” I shouted, stepping further back into the aisle to make some distance.

 “Ah, see? You’re missing the point here. I’m giving them a new life and immortalizing them by doing this. Do you think they’d be remembered if they continued to live their boring little lives? How many people remember the names of the victims in serial killer cases? Now, how many memorable characters have we had in horror? These are more than just films; they are worship with better lighting.”

“You’re delusional,” I stated bluntly. “Taking the lives of others isn’t art.”

“You’re not understanding!” He screamed like a toddler having a meltdown. “I was wrong about you. I thought you wanted to create, not just collect. You’re not willing to give your life for this, you’re not a true fan of horror.”

“You brainwashed Roth into killing his friends, you killed Hooper’s parents…you’re a sick fuck plain and simple!”

“No…no, I’m not.” He laughed darkly as I pointed the bat at him.

“Enough of the cryptic bullshit!” In a desperate attempt to strike him, I swung the bat. Before it could connect though, I felt hands, their grasp vice-like, grip my arms.

“Let me go!” I shouted as I writhed around in a vain attempt to wrench free from their ambush. I managed to get Roth in the shoulder with my elbow. It was hard enough that he grunted, but it didn’t slow him down any. 

Both wrestled me deeper into the aisle, their combined weight pushing me against another nearby shelf. The shelves rattled as I thrashed and knocked into the surrounding displays, causing numerous VHS cases to spill onto the floor, clattering like dominoes.

In the middle of the struggle, the bat was knocked from my grasp and skidded across the floor. Sending a punch to Roth’s face was enough to make him stagger and fall back into one of the shelf racks. But before I could go to retrieve the bat, the sharp crack of wood exploded against my ribs and the world briefly tunneled into darkness. I collapsed to the floor breathing like a fish out of water, the air forced out of my lungs.

Hooper handed the bat to Fulci and he grabbed it with a casual smile before tossing it to the side. “Tsk, tsk, tsk,” He stepped over the mess of fallen tapes to stand in front of me. “We’ll have to clean this up later. Hooper, Roth…take our friend here to the back. I want to show him something.”

They didn’t hesitate; they dragged me toward a nearby hallway past an “Attack of the Killer Tomatoes” poster. My shoulder thudded against a wall as they turned a corner, causing me to groan in pain.

The door to the “STAFF ONLY” room opened to reveal nothing but pitch black.

Fulci flicked the lights on to reveal a room that didn’t belong in any retail space. The floors were bare concrete; the walls lined with industrial shelving stacked high with black VHS tapes and unmarked DVDs. Each one had a white sticker, a number, and names, hundreds of them. 

That’s when I saw them, the dozen people that sat in a circle on the floor. There were men, women, even kids no older than sixteen, all adorned in dark clothing with their heads bowed, eyes closed. In front of each of them sat an open camcorder, red light blinking in unison with their breathing. They looked like they were in some kind of deep meditation, or they were praying to the machines in front of them. I recognized them all, they had been the people standing outside my house watching me.

He walked between them all like a preacher at the pulpit. “These,” Fulci said, gesturing to the circle, “are our faithful crew. Every scream, cut, and frame that you have seen, they helped capture. The camera is their sacrament and the lens doesn’t lie.” He crouched beside one of the youngest, a boy with a shaved head and bloodstained fingertips, and adjusted the camera in front of him. 

“They learn, film, and most importantly, earn their names. Everyone starts as a viewer, a voyeur, but eventually, they all want to learn the behind-the-scenes stuff.” He pointed toward the shelves. “Every finished project of ours gets catalogued and every creator joins the collection. Death might be eternal, but the art…is immortal.”

The boy’s eyelids fluttered as he whispered something that sounded like, “Action.”

A low hum rippled through the group as they began to chant softly their bodies rocked gently in time with it. As I turned to look away, I noticed the pegboard on the far wall containing still shot, candid images, and telephoto snapshots. 

They were of victims, dozens of them, and they all looked terrified. My photo was among the many on the board, right in the center too. Someone had written in red marker underneath it: *SHOOT IN PROGRESS*.

With a smile, he followed my gaze. “See? You’ve been part of it longer than you think. We’ve been filming since the moment you walked through that door.”

He walked over to one of the shelves and pulled out a VHS case. This one wasn’t damaged or aged like the others, but glossy and professional, like it were brand new. He held it up, and my heart plummeted. It was a perfect frame of me peeking through the blinds of my window staring back from the cover.

*THE COLLECTOR’S INITIATION*

“It’s your big debut.” His tone was malicious and playful at the same time. I didn’t say anything, my throat was locked tight. Hooper’s and Roth’s fingers dug into my arms like handlers steadying an animal before the cut.

“Don’t take it personally,” Hooper cooed. “Everybody gets nervous before their first scene.”

On a nearby table, Fulci set the tape down with a plastic click. “Come on, let’s get you in front of the camera. You’ve already been such a natural.”

The chanting of the crew had grown louder, their eyes opened and focused on me. Bursts of bright red strobed throughout the room as the red recording lights focused directly on me. My mind screamed for me to move, to do anything, but I was completely frozen to the spot.

From the table, he picked up something small and metallic. It was a box cutter. “Don’t worry,” Fulci said, flicking the blade out with a snap. “We only ever need one good take.”

In that moment, fear compelled me to act. I drove my left elbow backward managing to catch Roth in the ribs. He hunched over in pain, his arms pulled away. Hooper shrieked as I twisted out of her grip. She reached for me in desperation, but I was already stumbling toward the door with Fulci in hot pursuit. 

“Keep rolling!” He screamed as I bolted into the hallway. 

Every step of mine caused me to feel excruciating pain where the bat had struck earlier. Breathing was difficult, every gasp of air I took felt like knives slicing the insides of my lungs. At this point, I wasn’t running so much as trying not to stop and fall forward. 

The chanting behind me morphed into psychotic laughter as the cult swarmed after me, footsteps thundering close by. I caught glimpses of the camcorders, the red lights bobbing like eyes in the darkness. Not daring to look back again, I ran as quickly as my feet could carry me.

“Don’t run!” Fulci’s voice echoed from somewhere behind. “We’ll lose focus!”

I crashed through to the front room and stumbled into a shelf, sending a bunch of tapes clattering to the floor. One of them split open on impact, unspooling black ribbon across the floor. 

My heart hammered frantically, but I didn’t stop. Adrenaline surged through my veins as I scrambled toward the front door. My fingers scraped against the edges of the shelves; my body screamed at me to run faster. Hooper and Roth’s screams echoed off the walls of the store, I could hear the shuffle of dozens of others moving behind them.

I flung myself through the glass doors out into the parking lot, the neon FINAL CUT VIDEO sign above flickered overhead like a dying heartbeat. The cool breeze hit me like a slap to the face, and the cult poured out of the doorway behind me. 

With their cameras raised, they continued chasing after me like a pack of feral animals. Panic consumed my movements as I fumbled for my keys. 

I unlocked the car door and threw myself inside just as a cultist’s hand barely grazed my shoulder.

I slammed the door shut as I watched them swarm the car with reckless abandon. The entire vehicle rocked back and forth with their weight as they shook my vehicle. Some punched the windshield, the force of the strikes causing cracks in the glass while others struggled to pry open the locked doors. 

My breath came in anxious bursts as I jammed the key into the ignition and turned. A flurry of bloodied fists banged against the driver’s side window as the engine roared to life.

My tires squealed against the asphalt as I floored my foot on the gas pedal. The car shot forward and sling-shotted several of them off the hood. 

The sickening thud of bodies against the ground blended with the screams of cult members as I barreled through the chaos. Some had managed to grip the hood and sides hard enough to hang on though. 

With one hard swerve of my car, I managed to send them flying off.

A couple of cultists got caught beneath my tires as I tore through the parking lot. The car jerked violently with every impact of flesh against metal. Their anguished screams rose above the engine and I could feel the dragging friction under the wheels. 

Somewhere in the chaos, bodies rolled across the windshield and hands hammered on the trunk. The sound of them pounding on the car followed me as I peeled out of the parking lot.

I checked my mirrors obsessively, scanning for any sign of headlights close behind while I approached the interstate. Thankfully, there weren’t any. 

The vehicles that passed me on the highway made me flinch; I kept thinking it might be Fulci’s cult. 

I honestly had no idea where I was going, I just kept driving and pulling off at random exits in the hopes that they would never find me. I didn’t dare glance into the rearview mirror longer than I needed to. 

A numbing sensation crept into my hands from how long and hard I had gripped the wheel for. My ribs throbbed in agony, the stinging sensation in my chest felt like I had been attacked by a thousand or more bees. Each breath I attempted turned into a pitiful, shallow gasp, causing shadows to linger at the edge of my vision. 

There was no doubt that I had fractured or broken ribs, but I couldn’t afford to stop and take care of them right now. Miles slipped past, and I barely noticed until the gas light lit up on the dashboard. 

I pulled off at the next exit and parked at the pump of the closest gas station. What should have been a mindless task felt like a chore as I fumbled my way through opening the gas cap and putting the nozzle in to fill the tank. 

A shiver ran down my spine as I remembered the pegboard, my photo, and the words underneath, *SHOOT IN PROGRESS*. 

My love of horror movies had been used against me by Fulci. Those films weren’t invitations; they were conditioning of the sickest kind. He wasn’t just trying to scare or intimidate; he wanted to make me part of his narrative. 

What scared me the most was realizing how easy it was for him to weaponize his words. He had already amassed a following that believed in his ideology, so maybe in some ways, he was right about there being worship in horror. 

Maybe that’s what horror really is, a way to condition and unlock the monsters that have been inside us all along. If that’s true, then how many more people like that are out there waiting for their cue?

The gas pump stopped with a loud click, interrupting my thoughts. I put the nozzle back into its place, climbed back into my car, and with a wheeze, I took off. 

When I merged back onto the highway, I watched the world outside my windshield smear into a blur of color and motion. Like a scene I couldn’t cut away from, the scenery looped with every mile that stretched into the endless night. 

My body craved sleep, but the only reason I continued to remain awake was the pain in my ribs that continued to spread and burn like wildfire. 

Time bled together as I continued down the highway until I pulled into a run-down roadside motel parking lot. This was the happiest I had ever been seeing a piece of shit place like this.

A quick exchange with the guy at the desk managed to get me a room that smelled like a combination of old cigarettes and bleach. Despite the less than appealing nature of the room, it was the first time that I had felt safe in days. 

Immediately after getting inside and making sure that the coast was clear outside, I called my insurance company. I told them about the van rear ending me and the extent of the damages from the vandalization. 

Afterwards, I called the police, and I told them everything I knew: the address of the store, the license plate from the van that had chased me, and what I had seen on the tapes. The officer I spoke to assured me that there would be an extensive investigation and that I would be contacted about making a statement later.
 
I’d like to think that they believed me, but I’m not sure if they entirely did. I’m going to rough it out in this motel for a little bit and lay low. 

I’m posting this because I need people to know that if anything happens to me, or if anyone has any information at all about Final Cut Video…please contact the authorities. I might have a room with four walls, a lock, and a light I can leave on, but I’m not going anywhere until I know it’s safe to go back outside again.

When I know more about the status of my case, I’ll continue to provide updates. Until then, this will be my final post about this. 

Even though I’ve escaped…I don’t think they’re done filming yet.
