(Content warning for mention of suicide)

I am an OS who recently started to work on my first cargo ship. The Theseus was in search of extra hands, and I was in search of a job, so the fit seemed perfect. The large amount of paperwork given to me prior to embarking had surprised me, but this was, again, my first cargo job, and I assumed this was customary.

However, when the non-liability waivers in cases of serious bodily or psychological harm or death were placed in front of me, it made me worry for a split second. But I had done well in training and was broke, so I really needed this. The pay would be fantastic. Like, five figures for a month of work- fantastic. Knowing that the average OS salary is between 900 to 1,300 a month, I more than needed this.

It was only the third day on board when the first crew member went missing, a mechanic named Teddy. We had received the news during dinner. After an extensive search on board, the first mate informed us there was a mistake with documentation, saying Teddy had never even boarded the ship. Any protest, claiming crewmates have talked to Teddy on board, were met with a swift “Theodore Hunters never boarded the Theseus”.

The second to go missing was my buddy Phil. He was one of the new guys, just like me. He disappeared four days after Teddy did. I was with him the night it happened. We had left the sleeping quarters to go out for a cigarette on deck. The flame of my lighter offered a brief relief from the cold. For a moment, we simply blew smoke into the crisp air and looked out into the darkness around us. At night, the sky and sea fused into one endless black void. You couldn’t see a thing. But the sound of wind blowing and waves crashing into one another kept us grounded and calm.

“One more week to go” Phil muttered as he took a drag from his cigarette.

“You got another shipment soon after this one?” I asked, flicking ashes into an ashtray I held in my hand.

“Nah, I’m goin’ home.”

“To the missus, huh?” I joked.

I saw his jaw tighten in the faint glow of the small deck lights.

“Not anymore.” He sighed, “My girlfriend recently broke up with me.”

I kicked myself at my stupid comment.

“Aw, man. I’m sorry to hear that.”

He looked straight in front of him.

“Yeah, she said the ‘spark’ was just gone.” He cleared his throat. “I really loved her. Was gonna propose. Sometimes I think I can still hear her voice. I can still smell her perfume-” he started to choke up.

“Hey man, I’m really sorry. That’s terrible.”

“Yeah, well…” He cleared his throat again and quickly rubbed his face while inhaling sharply. “But what about you, huh? You got a special girl in your life? Special boy?”

I snickered

“No, no, none of that for me. I’m happy on my own.”

“Uuuuh-huh.” He laughed and lit up another cigarette. He offered me a light for my second one.

We stood there smoking in silence again for a short while.

“Do you know what the cargo is?” I asked.

“What?”

“The cargo on the Theseus. What are we transporting?”

“From what I have heard some circus equipment. Trapezes, stages, tent poles, sound equipment, that kinda stuff. Some European circus needs more stuff I s’posse.”

I glanced over at where the cargo was kept. It looked like a second ocean of green and blue shipping containers. The containers were huge, like those containers millennials would renovate into tiny homes or small bungalows.

“Seems like they need a lot of stuff.”

“Big circus I guess.”

I felt the conversation starting to die out, so I decided to head back to the sleeping quarters, while Phil stayed back for his third cigarette. When leaving, I smelled the faintest hint of a woman’s perfume; floral and soft.

The next morning, Phil was gone and I was called to the captain’s quarters for questioning. I was asked to reveal everything we had talked about the previous night. When I came to Phil’s recent breakup, the captain and first mate exchanged knowing looks. They concluded that Phil had jumped overboard.

“We are sorry for your loss.” The captain said in his thick Dutch accent. “Instances like these happen sadly all too often.”

“What do we do now? Do we turn back?” I asked.

“Turn back?”

“There was a suicide on board, shouldn’t we turn back? Contact someone?”

“The right people will be notified about this,” the first mate interrupted me, “We don’t turn back. Standard protocol, kid. You’re young and inexperienced, so I understand how shaken up you are by this, but this is something you sadly get used to.”

And get used to it I did. When the third crew member, an intern named Isaac, had gone missing, I was hardly phased anymore. The first mate came up with another explanation, and work went on.

Yesterday, I finally understood what truly happened to Teddy, Phil and Isaac. I was almost the fourth.

I was out on the deck again, having a smoke and reminiscing on the last conversation I ever had with Phil.

I started to smell the women’s perfume again. It was warm and inviting. It was sweet, almost sickly sweet. Almost.

That’s when I saw them, faintly, in the dim glow of the sidelights. Women. Around six of them. Happily bobbing around in the dark waters. Swimming alongside the Theseus. They turned towards me and waved.

The sweet smell had me in a sort of trance, I don’t remember at all finding it odd to see a group of women swimming in the ice-cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean at 2 at night, days away from civilization. They called out to me. Their voices were the most beautiful things I have ever heard. Soft and melodious, the tones caressed my face. I tried my best to look closer. Their faces seemed to shift in the light. One of them had the face of my middle school crush, another was the cute barista who once gave me a coffee on the house, and another looked like my last girlfriend. When I blinked, they had other faces of previous work crushes, ex-girlfriends, one night stands,… Their faces shifted so often, morphing each of the women into amalgamations of my love interests. And they were beautiful. The faces were so, so, so beautiful.

They called out to me again. Told me to join them. I cannot describe their voices, they were the sweetest melody human ears could ever perceive. I had to go to them. The pilot ladder. I could take the pilot ladder down. I swung myself over the sides of the ship and started my slow descent down on the ladder. The wind stung my face and squealed in my ears, but their voices kept me warm. I needed to hear more of the voices. I now know of course, this is stupid. But you simply weren’t there. If you heard the voices too, you would understand the unmatched compulsion. I was almost down, the women surrounding the water under me, crowding around the bottom of the ladder.

A loud clank is what shook me back to awareness. I later found out some idiot hadn’t tied down something properly which fell due to the hard wind. I looked back at the women. Their faces… my God, their faces. I only caught a glimpse before they disappeared back into the dark water, but that glimpse was enough. It was enough. Small, fish-like eyes on the front of their faces. No nose, no ears, no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelids. Gills poked out of their necks and their mouths… Large and unhinged, like snakes. Have you ever seen a shark’s teeth? The rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth? Theirs were like that. Their tongues were like a lamprey’s, moving back and forth in anticipation.

Diving back into the water, they disappeared into vague silhouettes under the surface. I climbed back up the pilot ladder with all my might, letting myself fall onto the deck once I had reached the top. I took a second to catch my breath and sat up, looking out onto the ocean, the silhouettes gone. I puked.

Right now, I have locked myself in a storage room. I can’t do this journey anymore. Not knowing those things took my friends and will continue to do so. The boatswain is knocking at the door. I will not open it. Not until I have answers. I will sit out this journey in here. It’s only two more days. Wish me luck.
