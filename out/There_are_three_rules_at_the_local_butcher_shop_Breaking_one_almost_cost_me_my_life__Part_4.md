I followed George closely, never letting him leave my sight. Aside from a few trucks, the roads were empty at that time, so I had to be careful not to spook him. We had driven maybe twenty minutes out of town when I saw him start slowing down, like he was looking for something. He had just reached an old, run-down intersection when he suddenly turned off the highway and onto a dirt road. It led down into a clearing that was surrounded by a grove of trees. I noticed a pull-off on the side of the highway, just far enough away from the turn-off that I could still see him and not be seen myself. I pulled over, cut my lights, and sat for a moment, keeping my eyes trained on his movement. Once his tires hit the dirt road, he turned his lights out as well. His car was now only being illuminated by moonlight.

I slowly proceeded to follow, careful to remain a good distance behind him. Luckily, I had enough moonlight to see where I was going and could follow the soft, red glow of George’s taillights as he made his way into the clearing. I crested a small hill where I parked to watch from above. At the bottom, I saw he had stopped and pushed the door open, not having stepped out yet.

I cut my engine so I wouldn’t alert him. My heart was beating so fast. I had never done anything like this before, and the prospect of being caught scared the hell out of me. I steadied my nerves and trained my focus on George. I was sure he hadn’t seen me yet, or he would have taken off. I had the element of surprise on my side for once in my life. I saw him get out, pop the trunk, and pull the large bundle free, slamming it down into the dirt. He grabbed some other miscellaneous items from his car and proceeded to drag the sack toward the tree line. He soon vanished into the darkness of the woods, leaving behind a silent dread that settled into the early morning air. I didn’t follow him immediately; I was too scared to. There was no way I was going into those woods while he was still in there. I chose to wait. For all I knew, George was oblivious to my presence, and I wanted it to stay that way.

I waited, letting the stillness of the night settle in. The silence was broken only by the rustling of leaves, the whispers of the wind, and the frantic pounding of my own heart. My brain desperately pleaded with me to run, but I was trapped. Not in a physical way, but more of a morbid fascination with the nightmare that I found myself in. I had to know the truth.

After waiting for about half an hour, I saw George reappear from the forest. His apron and the bundle were both gone. He looked lighter… as if he had been released from something or someone. Through the dim moonlight and residual light from his car, I could see that he was smiling from ear to ear. He looked utterly insane, joyfully strutting back out of the woods without care. He started his car up and drove out of the clearing, taking a separate dirt road that led away from me. I watched as his glowing, red taillights bounced across the uneven trail, all the way back onto the main road. He drove without a care, seemingly pleased with what he had done. What that was, I wasn’t sure of just yet, but I was determined to find out.

I waited until sunrise before I dared to venture into those woods. I wanted to know that he was gone for a while before making a move. The comfort of the morning sun gave me the courage to, finally, creep down to the clearing. I came to a stop a few feet away from where he had been parked, nearly inside the same tire tracks, which gave me a strange feeling. I got out of my car and looked down at where he had slammed the bundle onto the ground. I could see his boot prints surrounding the area, followed by drag marks from the sack. There were dark-red streaks of what I assumed to be blood soaked into the powdery, red dirt, creating a clumped mess following within the drag marks. I followed the trail into the woods, being careful not to step in it or disturb the marks in any way.

Past the first grove of trees, the entire forest fell silent. There were no chirping birds or whispering wind, just the deafening sound of silence. I found an old log next to the trail that caught my interest. It looked to have been lying there for decades. It was dead and decaying, lying half-consumed by the earth. The drag marks led straight up to it, stopping there just before going over it. Dried blood covered the old wood, cracking across it like old paint. Deep red streaks stained the majority of the old tree, trickling down to the dirt below. It collected on the ground into a crimson pool, intersecting the drag marks from the trail.

This spot was important for some reason. I just needed to find out why. I scanned the entire area, finally looking over at where the tree stump should have been. The ground around it was disturbed, creating a discolored circular area about five feet wide. Looking closer, the soil was loose and wet as if it had been freshly dug. Fresh blood mixed in with the earth, creating a stark contrast against the muted brown and green of the forest floor.

My heart pounded against my ribs as I hesitantly took a step closer. I could see something protruding out of the loose soil, just barely visible. A chill climbed my spine as I bent down to get a closer look. I recognized what the object was immediately. Half-buried in a shallow pit, I found the sack that George had been dragging hours earlier. My initial attempts to tear it open were unsuccessful. I eventually pulled out my old pocketknife and plunged it deep into the fabric, ripping it downward. A horrific smell erupted from the opening, invading my eyes and nose. The smell was so thick and potent that it forced me to stumble backward. I clasped my forearm across my face, desperately trying to block the intrusive odor.

I regained my composure and stepped forward, peering into the jagged hole I had created in the sack. Inside, I saw something staring back at me that I noticed immediately. Freshly stripped bones peeked through the hole in the sack. I examined them closer, noticing something I wish I hadn’t. These were not animal bones. Having butchered enough to recognize the difference, I knew that these did not belong to any animal I had ever encountered. No, these were undoubtedly human.

Horrified, I stepped back, overwhelmed by the gruesome scene. A putrid cocktail of decay and rot spewed forth, coating the entire area in the stench of death. I pulled my shirt over my nose and stepped back in. I had come this far, and I wasn’t going to quit now. I peeled back the cover of the sack with a large stick I had found on the trailside, revealing all of the contents. Butchering meat had almost desensitized me to this type of stuff, but knowing now what this truly was turned my stomach into knots. As the exterior peeled away, the true horror of what George had done came to life. Some of the bones inside still had strips of skin and flesh clinging to them. There were teeth strewn about within the gory mess, as well as a child’s shoe, bloodied and lifeless, alongside the viscera.

Entrails and discarded muscle mixed into the macabre collection, causing it to coagulate and form a gelatinous mess. I could feel the acidic vomit rising in my throat. I had to turn away from it, though my curiosity dared me not to. I turned my attention away from the gore and back toward finding out who this person was. I needed to know why George would be out to kill them. At first, I couldn’t find any markings or identification for who this might’ve been. I searched around the area and inside the freshly dug hole next to the sack. At the edge of it, I found a tag. It was one we used at the shop to label cuts.

It read:

“SHOULDER - 4.3 LB - $19.76”

I turned it over, revealing a name scribbled faintly on the back in George’s handwriting:

‘Amanda’

I threw the tag on the ground. My stomach finally gave in, sending up everything it had within it. This was sick. I couldn’t believe I worked for a man who could do this. I ran back to my car, stumbling across the logs and boulders on the trail, the image of the bag’s contents filling my brain. I jumped in my car and sped out of the clearing, leaving the horrific discovery behind me.

I drove as fast as I could to the police station. When I arrived, I felt a sense of relief washing over me. I just knew that I was going to nail this bastard and put an end to this. I didn’t know when he had done this or how long this had been going on, but there was no way I could sit idly by and let it continue. I had known that he was capable of doing something like this for a long time. Seeing it in person was truly terrifying.

I walked in and asked to speak with a detective. Surprisingly, the front office manager already knew my name. They said someone had called them about me earlier that day, saying that I had been acting erratically. They said I’d gone missing from a halfway house in South Texas and that I’d been dodging my friends and family for some time.

It was all lies. I knew George was behind this. He was always two steps ahead of me in everything that he did. I tried to reason with them. I told them about Redhill Meats and about George’s odd behavior. I told them about how he killed a girl and that her remains were half-buried in a sack off of Highway 14. I was convinced that I would get justice for the girl by telling the truth. I figured that if a cop were to hear this story, no matter how sketchy the person’s background, they would have to at least look into it.

They just looked at me, making me feel like I was insane. They told me that Redhill Meats shut down almost twenty years ago, in 2007, and the owner, George, died of a heart attack the year before that, in 2006. They said that the building had remained abandoned since it closed, but that they couldn’t tear it down because George’s family had maintained ownership of it. Even though the owner was supposedly dead, the bills were always paid on time, never arousing suspicion from anybody. As long as they got their money, they didn’t really care.

I demanded that they see for themselves, but they wouldn’t listen.

“He’s a fucking psycho; you’ve got to believe me! Please come with me, I’ll show you!” I pleaded.

I pressed as hard as I could, but the officers did nothing to entertain my rant. They just held their hands out to me and told me to calm down, which had the opposite effect. It wasn’t until they threatened me with arrest that I was able to reel myself in. I already had a prior conviction, and I did not want to end up in jail again.

“Sir, you need to calm down and go home.” The lady at the front desk said calmly, “It sounds like you are having an episode. We can call somebody if you’d like.”

I looked at the woman in confusion. Anger rose in my chest, erupting before I could stop it.

“Episode? What the fuck!? I’m not crazy, I’m trying to stop a murderer!” I exclaimed in return. “You’re going to just sit there on your ass and let that psycho keep killing people!?”

This seemed to be the last straw as the two burly officers near the door rushed up to me and grabbed me under each arm.

“Sir, you are being trespassed. Please vacate the property now, or you will be forcibly removed.” One of them barked at me.

Though everything in me was telling me not to, I peaceably left without pushing the issue any further. There was no way they were going to listen to me anyway. They had made up their minds and would not be persuaded otherwise. I left the police station defeated, struggling to keep my composure as I trudged through the rain to my car. I knew that George had set me up. He had anticipated my every move. He knew I was onto him ever since the incident in cooler seven. He had lured me into his web, but why? Why hadn’t he just fired me, or killed me for that matter? Why go through all of this?

My mind reeled as I drove back to my cousin’s place, the city lights blurring through the rain-streaked windows. I was just a pawn in a game that I didn’t understand. My hands began to shake. I knew that, now, there was no way George could let me live. I knew way too much. I mulled over the thought of running away, ultimately settling on skipping town the following day. If I were ever going to escape him, I would have to run. I had broken a rule, and I knew there would be consequences.

“I’ll probably end up in one of those bags,” I said out loud to myself. “Just like Amanda.”

The thought sank into my brain, swallowed by a vortex of confusion. I wondered what she had done to deserve such a fate. Did she break a rule, or was she just an unfortunate statistic? A tear formed in the corner of my eye, sliding down my cheek and onto my shirt. I was next in line. I knew what was coming now, and it was up to me to stop it.

I pulled into my cousin’s driveway, mind still reeling from the last few hours. I scrambled to the door, yanking my keys from my pocket. My hands were shaking so badly that I could barely get the key in the lock. To my surprise, when I tried to turn the handle, it turned freely.

“Hmm, that’s strange,” I said under my breath. “I guess I forgot to lock the door.”

My mind was so far away that I didn’t think twice about the door being unlocked. I walked into the garage and closed the door behind me. I fell onto my cot, feeling all the emotions from the day washing over me at once. I was disgusted, then sad, and then angry. It was all just one massive lie, and I helped him with it. That’s what troubled me the most. For all I knew, I had been helping him cut up people for weeks.

As I pondered this new information, I heard a faint thud echo from the bathroom. Immediately, my mind was flooded with flashbacks of cooler number seven. It was unmistakable. It sounded identical to it. I stood up from my cot and shuffled my way over to the door. The closer I got, the louder it became. I grabbed the bathroom door handle, summoning the courage to enter. It was warm, like someone had just used it. I turned it and quickly pushed the door open, not knowing what to expect.

The door opened, knocking against the rear wall. I quickly stepped in, pushing my way into the space. I was greeted by my cousin John on the floor in the fetal position, bound and gagged. His whole body was covered in duct tape. His eyes and mouth were covered, along with his feet and hands being bound in front of him. He had a t-shirt shoved in his mouth behind the tape, only allowing him to make a weak moaning sound. The light thud I had heard was him trying desperately to bash his shoulder into the wall to get my attention.

I rushed to peel the tape off his eyes. Once he saw it was me, he seemed to calm down a bit. Relieved, I went to grab the piece of tape that covered his mouth. As I started to peel it off, I saw his eyes widen and fill with fear. He let out a whimper that turned into a muffled scream.

“John, it’s me! You’re safe.” I assured him as I pulled the tape.

He screamed again, sounding more desperate this time. His feet slammed against the floor as he pushed his back into the wall, desperately trying to free himself. He hit the drywall so hard that it started to crack.

I was holding John’s shoulders, trying to calm him down, when suddenly, I felt a sharp pain across the back of my head. The pain was immense but short, as everything went black almost immediately. I don’t remember what happened after that. The darkness consumed me for what felt like days.

I awoke to a pounding headache and blurry vision. I tried desperately to shake off the grogginess, but I was too weak to move. After a few minutes of struggling, I was finally able to lift my head to observe my surroundings. I was in a white room surrounded by tall stacks of boxes. Scattered across the floor, fresh pools of blood glistened under a sickening yellow light. The place was all too familiar. I was inside cooler number seven.

I could taste the metallic tang of blood in my mouth as my head slowly began to stop swaying. The cold seeped into my skin, causing my muscles to contract. I tried to move, but my limbs were heavy and unresponsive, as if every ounce of strength had been drained from me. My wrists and ankles were bound like John’s had been, rendering me immobile and powerless.

The refrigeration systems hummed in the background, mixing with the low drone of the fluorescent lights. Now and then, I would hear the slow drip of condensation from above, quickly drowned out by the incessant buzzing that filled the room. The familiar scent of blood and decay filled my nostrils, overpowering everything else. I was back in the place I had been forbidden to enter. I never actually saw him do it, but I knew George had done this to me. My mind raced, flashes of the last few days haunting me like a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.

Then, the thought hit me. What about John? The fog that enveloped my brain had momentarily cloaked the worry for him behind my own pain and self-loathing. The image of his terrified face was burned into my mind, his eyes wide with fear. He was trying to warn me. He desperately wanted to tell me, but I couldn’t understand. I never thought that it would go this far.

“What the fuck?” I whispered to myself, my voice barely audible.

I twisted my wrists against the duct tape, trying to break free, but it was too tight. Panic started to swell in my chest, threatening to take over all of my senses. I pushed my mind toward worrying about John instead of myself. Where was he? Was he ok? Was he still alive? I couldn’t think about myself right now, not after what I had seen. John would never have gotten involved if I had just followed the rules.

Suddenly, the door creaked open with a low, eerie groan. The crackling pops from the door’s hinges reverberated through my spine, paralyzing me with fear. I froze, holding my breath. George’s voice cut through the silence, smooth and cold.

“Good, you’re awake.”

I tried to focus on him through blurry vision, but all I could see was a shadowy figure standing in the doorway. He stepped into the room, his boots making that familiar echo against the cold, hard floor.

His presence filled the room like a toxic cloud. He always had that effect on me, like a predator circling its prey, ready to deliver the killing blow. This time, however, it was different. These meetings were usually met with anger or discontent from him, but this time, he seemed… happy.

“You know," he continued, his tone dripping with amusement, "I always thought you were smarter than this. But I guess I overestimated you."

He stepped closer, his grin widening. It wasn’t a smile, but more a mask covering the insanity that desperately clawed at it, trying to escape. I was staring into the face of pure evil.

“I told you that you would have to follow the rules, did I not?” He asked, still holding that psychotic smile.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t, honestly. My mouth felt like it was filled with cotton, and my head was swimming. He turned to look at me, raising a knife in my direction. It was so familiar. Through the blur and haze, I could see that it was the knife I had found behind the counter a couple of weeks ago. The crimson-red handle stood out against the white background. I could almost make out the strange inscriptions and obscure carvings that covered the blade and handle.

“Well, with any rule break, there should be a proper punishment that fits the crime, don’t you agree?” He said, voice booming off the cooler walls, “What better place to deliver your punishment than in the place you so desperately wanted to explore?”

He laughed so loudly and with such force that he doubled over in enjoyment, putting his hands on his knees. His eyes teared up from laughter, causing him to pull his blood-covered apron up to wipe them away. His face, now stained with blood, turned, twisting from a sickening smile into a deathly serious stare.

“I hate that it came to this.” He said, voice low and sinister. “I hate to have to do this to you, I really do. But you left me no choice, son. I told you that curiosity would cost you.”

My throat tightened, but I fought to keep my voice steady. “You’re sick, George. This... this isn't right. I helped you. Let me go.” I said, gasping for air. The words barely left my lips, limply reaching the intended target.

He crouched down in front of me, eyes gleaming, and pushed the tip of the ornate knife into my chest. I could feel the sharp point dig into my skin, sending a hot, searing pain across my body.

“Is that what you think?” he said softly. “Poor boy, you were just a tool. A puppet.” He said, slightly tilting his head as he spoke, pressing the tip of the knife further into my chest, drawing blood, “You did help me, though. You helped me build all of this, Tom. You helped me with every single step. I wouldn’t have been able to continue my work without you.”

He turned his head back upright, stretching a smile across his face once more.

“You’ve helped me make people disappear for weeks now.”

His words sliced through me. I was sent reeling, my mind struggling to process everything he was saying.

“No! Fuck that! That’s not true!” I exclaimed, using all of my strength to push against my restraints.

His grin widened further as he stood, pulling the knife away from my chest and taking a step back. “You know, it truly is hard to find good help nowadays. You were a good worker, Tom.”

He casually walked away from me until he reached the cooler door. He grabbed the edge of it, turning around to look at me just before he stepped out into the hallway.

“Rules are rules.” He said softly before slamming the door, locking me in.

As George’s words swirled around my mind, I started to shake. Tears fell freely from my eyes as I lay on the cold floor of cooler seven and cried. Nothing mattered anymore. I was set to become just another number, just like Amanda. An internal clock in my mind started ticking, drowning out the sounds of the cooler. As the ticks rolled by, I thought about what death would feel like.

I closed my eyes tight, trying to regain my will to live. I opened my eyes with renewed tenacity. I did not want George to get the satisfaction from me dying in this shit hole. I told myself that I was going to get out of here or die trying.

The choices were simple. Escape or become a permanent part of Redhill Meats.
