Previous Part: [Wires and Chains Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Fb9GG987xw)

I lay there, sprawled over the rock, my breaths coming in short, ragged gasps. I tried to push myself up, but the pain in my knee was overwhelming, my leg refusing to cooperate.

That's when I heard it.

The low, guttural growl.

I froze, my heart hammering in my chest as I turned my head. It was there, at the edge of the clearing, emerging from the shadows of the twisted forest. The creature. The thing that had stepped out of the tree earlier, its tendrils writhing and its featureless face fixed on me.

It moved with a horrible, jerking motion, its body bending and twisting in ways that defied logic. The hum from earlier returned, faint at first but rising in intensity as it approached.

I felt its gaze-if something with no eyes could be said to have a gaze-fixed on me, cold and unrelenting.

I was the sacrificial lamb.

Gregory and Tianna had chosen me.

The realization was like a knife twisting in my gut, cutting deeper than even the pain in my shattered knee. They had left me here, broken and vulnerable, to save themselves.

The creature moved closer, its tendrils dragging across the ground, leaving faint scorch marks in the dirt. The hum grew louder, resonating in my skull, making it impossible to think.

I was alone.

And the monster was coming for me.

I tried to make myself believe I could escape. I tried to convince myself the monster would vanish, that it would turn away and leave me behind. But no matter how hard I focused, nothing happened.

There was a gnawing fear deep inside me—no, not fear. Doubt. It clung to me like chains, heavy and unrelenting, dragging me down. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t believe, not truly. The certainty that Skibidi had wielded, the desperation that had once transformed me—it wasn’t there.

I was powerless.

The monster loomed closer, its tendrils reaching out with deliberate, jerking movements. I wanted to scream, to fight, to do anything, but my body refused to move.

The tendrils wrapped around me, cold and unyielding. They lifted me effortlessly, pulling me toward the creature’s chest. The last thing I saw before everything went black was that blank, featureless face staring into me, as if it were swallowing my very soul.

When I awoke, I was lying in a river. The shallow water lapped gently against me, barely a few inches deep, its cool touch shocking against my skin. The world around me was eerily calm, the sunlight dappled through the trees above, the soft trickle of the stream the only sound.

I sat up slowly, the ache in my body lingering but dull. I glanced down, and my breath caught in my throat.

My body was… wrong.

My skin was an amalgamation of flesh and bark, twisted and fused together in unnatural patterns. Patches of wood grew out of me like an infection, rough and splintered, covering parts of my arms, my chest, even my legs. It was grotesque, alien, a nightmare etched into my very being.

Panic surged through me, and I began to scrub at the bark frantically, my hands clawing at the wooden patches with desperation.

“Get off,” I muttered, my voice trembling. “Get off me!”

To my astonishment—and relief—it worked. The bark began to flake away, revealing raw, tender flesh beneath. I scrubbed harder, ignoring the sting, until every piece of the twisted wood was gone, my skin returned to normal.

I knelt there in the river, my breaths coming in short, ragged gasps, the water washing away the remnants of my panic. It wasn’t until I stopped that I realized there was something else—something I hadn’t noticed in my frenzy.

Music.

A soft, lilting tune, carried gently on the breeze.

I turned my head toward the sound, my heart pounding anew, though this time it wasn’t fear.

There, on the riverbank, I saw a small campfire, its flames flickering softly. Beside it stood a tent, simple and unassuming, and sitting cross-legged in front of it was a figure.

A man, playing a pipe.

The melody was hauntingly sweet, both calming and unsettling in equal measure. The man’s head was bowed, his orange hair catching the sunlight like the glow of a dying sunset.

I froze, unable to look away.

The tune faded as he slowly lowered the pipes from his lips, turning his head toward me. His face was young, yet his eyes carried the weight of ages—black as the void, dotted with the faint shimmer of stars.

“Kjäll,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The Piper.

He smiled faintly, his expression unreadable as he watched me from across the river.

As I climbed out of the river, my legs unsteady beneath me, he rose from his seat and gestured toward a neatly folded set of clothes lying beside the fire. I glanced down at myself, realizing with embarrassment that I had nothing, not even the rags I’d worn before.

“Take them,” he said, his voice calm and measured. “You’ll need them.”

I dressed quickly, the simple tunic and trousers fitting well enough. The fabric was rough but warm, and the small act of covering myself brought an odd sense of grounding after everything that had happened.

As I tied the last knot, I turned to him, my chest tightening with the weight of my question. “What… what happened to me?”

He tilted his head slightly, the faintest hint of sorrow in his dark, star-speckled eyes. “You died,” he said simply. “Or at least, a part of you did. You were turned into a leshy—a servant of the woods, bound to Naamah’s will.”

The words sent a chill through me. “I was… patrolling the woods? Like the monster we saw?”

He nodded. “Yes. The fate of all who perish here. Their souls are rewoven, reshaped into her beasts. Tools for her dominion.”

My stomach churned as I processed his words. The faces in the trees, the creature that had taken me—they were all like me. People who had fought, struggled, and lost, now twisted into something unrecognizable.

“Then… how did you find me?” I asked, my voice trembling.

He smiled faintly, a mysterious glint in his eyes. “Perhaps a part of you knew you needed to be found. Perhaps it was your belief, even buried beneath your fear, that called me to you.”

I stared at him, my mind reeling. “So… you’re saying I saved myself?”

His expression didn’t change. “I’m saying that sometimes, when a soul is still strong, it reaches for something greater. And sometimes, it is answered.”

I had so many questions, more than I could possibly articulate. What was this place, truly? How did he know so much? And why did he care?

But before I could ask, he raised the pipes to his lips and began to play.

The melody was haunting and beautiful, the kind of tune that reached deep into your soul and stirred something you couldn’t name. It wasn’t like the humming of the creature in the woods. This was different—pure, cleansing, and sad.

As he played, his form began to shimmer, the edges of his body dissolving into the air like mist in the morning sun.

“Wait,” I said, stepping forward, my hand outstretched. “Don’t go.”

He didn’t stop playing. His form faded further, his hair catching the last rays of sunlight before it disappeared entirely.

“Please,” I whispered, my voice breaking.

But he was gone, and I was left alone by the fire, the tune lingering in my ears like the echo of a dream.

I sat down heavily, staring into the flames, my mind racing. The warmth of his presence, the depth of his words—they had felt real.

But the question burned in my mind, refusing to be silenced: Was that truly the Piper? Or was it just the world justifying my salvation?

The thought lingered, unanswered, as the fire crackled softly in the quiet of the forest.

As I rose from the fire and began wandering along the trail near the riverbank, I felt unmoored, adrift in this strange, unpredictable world. The path ahead was faint, winding through the forest in a way that seemed both purposeful and completely random. I didn’t know where I was going—just that I had to move.

The forest grew denser as I walked, the sunlight dimming beneath the thick canopy. Every sound felt magnified: the crunch of leaves underfoot, the rustle of branches in the breeze, the distant calls of unseen birds. My mind raced with questions about what had just happened—about the Piper, the leshy, the rules of this twisted place.

That’s when it happened.

A faint snap echoed from somewhere behind me. Before I could react, figures burst out of the underbrush, one after another, surrounding me in a semicircle.

Brigands.

They were a rough-looking bunch, dressed in mismatched armor and wielding crude but menacing weapons. There were at least a dozen of them, their faces grim and eager, like wolves circling their prey.

From among them, a man stepped forward. He was tall and broad, with a patchy beard and a scar running down the side of his face. His armor was slightly better than the others’, though still piecemeal, and a large sword rested on his shoulder.

“Well, well,” he said, his voice gruff and mocking. “Don’t you know this is a tolled road?”

I froze, panic surging through me. Was I about to die again? Would I be dragged off to captivity, or worse, turned into another of Naamah’s beasts? My mind raced for an answer, a way out, but nothing came.

And then it hit me.

I don’t know what possessed me—maybe desperation, maybe the lingering memory of Skibidi’s arrogance—but I decided to gamble everything on the most ridiculous plan I could think of. I decided to gaslight the shit out of them.

I straightened up, puffing out my chest, and plastered a look of indignation across my face. “Is this any way to treat your boss?” I said, my voice loud and commanding.

The brigands hesitated, their expressions flickering between confusion and amusement.

The leader narrowed his eyes. “What did you say?”

I scoffed, shaking my head like a disappointed parent. “Unbelievable. I step away for one day, and this is what happens? My own men pointing weapons at me like common highway trash? Do you have any idea how foolish you look right now?”

The leader blinked, clearly taken aback. “You’re… what? Our boss?”

“Of course I am!” I snapped, throwing my arms wide. “You don’t recognize me because I’ve been undercover, you dolts! Testing you! And guess what? You’re failing miserably!”

The bandits exchanged uneasy glances, their weapons wavering. I could feel the doubt creeping in, and I pressed harder.

“You really think someone would wander this road alone without knowing it’s tolled?” I said, jabbing a finger toward the leader. “You think I don’t know every inch of my territory? I built this operation, and now I see it’s being run by a bunch of incompetent fools who can’t even recognize their own commander!”

The leader took a half-step back, the confidence draining from his face. “Wait… you’re saying you’re in charge?”

“Of course I am!” I barked. “And if you don’t start acting like it, heads are going to roll. You think I don’t know where the treasury is? Where the secret entrances to the stronghold are? Shall I prove it to you?”

The group visibly wavered now, several of the brigands lowering their weapons entirely.

“I—I didn’t realize—” one of them stammered.

“Didn’t realize?” I interrupted, rounding on him. “Didn’t realize? That’s exactly the problem! None of you think! You just swing your swords and grunt like the dimwits you are! No wonder our profits are down!”

The leader looked flustered, glancing nervously at his men. “I—I’m sorry, boss. We didn’t know—”

“‘Sorry’ doesn’t cut it,” I snapped, glaring at him. “Do you think Naamah will accept apologies when we can’t deliver our tribute? No? Then why should I?”

At the mention of Naamah, the brigands all stiffened, their faces blanching with fear.

“Boss, please,” another bandit said, dropping to one knee. “Forgive us! We—we didn’t mean to offend!”

One by one, the rest of them followed suit, bowing their heads and muttering apologies.

I stared at them, my heart pounding. I couldn’t believe it had worked.

“Fine,” I said, waving a hand dismissively. “You’re lucky I’m in a forgiving mood. But this is your last chance. One more mistake like this, and I’ll personally see to it that you regret it.”

The leader nodded quickly, his face pale. “Understood, boss. Please, let us escort you back to the stronghold.”

They actually had a stronghold? My stronghold, apparently.

I gave a curt nod, trying to maintain my composure. “Lead the way.”

As the bandits gathered themselves and began moving, I followed, struggling to keep my disbelief in check.

For the first time, I realized how foolish I had been to care about an NPC like Maple. These brigands weren’t people. They were props in this world, tools to be used, reflections of whatever the system thought I needed them to be.

It was sobering, and strangely liberating.

They led me through the forest until we emerged at a sprawling fortress nestled in a hollow. Its walls were high and jagged, and its towers loomed over the surrounding trees.

“Welcome back, boss,” the leader said, gesturing toward the gate with a nervous smile.

I took a deep breath, staring up at the stronghold that was now mine.

Over the following days, I stayed with the brigands—if you could even call them that anymore. It was during this time that I truly began to understand the strange rules of this world, and more importantly, how to bend them.

I had already discovered how difficult it was to make myself believe something enough to manifest it, but I realized that the NPCs—well, they were different. They weren’t like me. They didn’t carry the same doubts or complexities of thought. Their reality seemed malleable, and with a little push in the right direction, they could be made to believe just about anything.

And once they believed something? The world reshaped itself to fit their belief.

It started on the first day.

I was hungry, and I demanded a feast. The brigands nodded dutifully and led me to the food stores—empty barrels and shelves greeted me, the hollow echoes of the room mocking my request.

I tried to manifest food myself, focusing as hard as I could, but it was no use. I just couldn’t make myself believe it into existence.

But then an idea struck me.

I walked back to the brigands, who stood around awkwardly, and fixed them with a stern glare. “Are you telling me you didn’t check properly? That you let your own laziness insult me and deny me the feast I deserve?”

They exchanged uneasy glances, clearly unsure. “We… we looked, boss,” one of them muttered.

“No,” I snapped, my voice rising. “You thought you looked. But you didn’t. You didn’t try hard enough. Now go back in there and search again. I know there’s food in those stores—there has to be. Find it!”

They hesitated, but my insistence pushed them into action. They scrambled back into the storehouse, muttering apologies and assurances that they’d “do better this time.”

When they emerged a short while later, they were carrying crates overflowing with bread, cured meats, and fresh produce.

“See?” I said, my arms crossed as they laid the food out in front of me. “What did I tell you? You just weren’t looking hard enough.”

They bowed their heads, apologizing profusely, while I stood there in shock, barely able to contain my disbelief. I had just gaslit reality into bending itself to their perception.

The next day, I noticed how much of a dump the stronghold was. Most of it was little more than a ramshackle camp inside a crumbling fortress, the walls barely standing and the living conditions abysmal.

I walked through the ruins, shaking my head at the sight of it all. “Unacceptable,” I muttered loud enough for the brigands to hear.

When they gathered around me, I pointed to the mess and started talking.

“You call this a stronghold?” I said, my voice dripping with disdain. “This isn’t a stronghold—it’s an embarrassment. And yet you let it stand like this? Unclean? Unkempt? How do you expect anyone to take us seriously if this is how we present ourselves?”

One of the brigands scratched his head. “We, uh… we don’t have the supplies to fix it, boss.”

“Nonsense,” I snapped. “You’ve already fixed it. You just don’t remember because you’re too busy slacking off. You cleaned this place up days ago. You repaired the walls, swept the floors, replaced the furniture—it’s spotless, isn’t it? Or am I wrong?”

The brigands exchanged nervous glances, but the doubt in their eyes began to fade. “I… yeah,” one of them said slowly. “Yeah, we did fix it up, didn’t we?”

“Yes, you did,” I said firmly. “And you did a damn good job of it. Now take a moment to admire your work.”

I left them standing there, their expressions turning from confusion to pride as I stepped outside. When I returned to the courtyard a short while later, the stronghold was unrecognizable.

The walls were pristine, the floors swept clean, the buildings repaired and reinforced. What had once been a ruin was now an impeccable fortress, towering over the surrounding forest with an air of authority.

I didn’t stop there.

Once I saw what was possible, I realized the true extent of my power in this world.

The brigands were still bandits at heart, their habits crude and their morals nonexistent. But I saw an opportunity to make them into something more—something better.

I gathered them in the main hall, their eyes wide and expectant as they waited for me to speak.

“You’re not brigands,” I said, pacing in front of them. “You never were. That’s not who you are. You’re warriors. Noble warriors. You fight for the people, for the weak, for those who cannot fight for themselves. You are protectors, not thieves.”

The words hung in the air, their weight sinking into the minds of the brigands.

One of them frowned. “We… we fight for the people?”

“Yes,” I said, meeting his gaze. “You’ve always fought for the people. You’re virtuous warrior priests, champions of justice and defenders of the downtrodden. That’s who you are. That’s who you’ve always been.”

At first, there was silence. Then, slowly, they began to nod.

“That… makes sense,” one of them said.

“Yeah,” another chimed in. “We’ve always fought for the people, haven’t we?”

I smiled. “Exactly. And this fortress? It’s a temple. A place of refuge and strength for all who seek it. And you? You’re its guardians.”

From that moment on, the transformation was unstoppable. The brigands discarded their crude weapons and patched armor, replacing them with noble garb and polished steel. The stronghold became a beacon in the forest, a place of sanctuary for travelers and traders alike.

People began arriving—farmers, merchants, wanderers—all seeking shelter, trade, or protection. The fortress buzzed with activity, its halls filled with purpose and pride.

I couldn’t help but feel a sense of satisfaction. I had taken what was broken and made it whole. I had turned chaos into order, despair into hope.

And for the first time since arriving in this world, I began to feel something strange, something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

Pride.

Days turned to weeks, and then to months. The fortress was no longer just a place—it was a kingdom unto itself. And I? I was its Lord Commander, its High Priest. It was mine, forged by my will and guided by my hand. Under my leadership, the stronghold flourished. The temple halls echoed with purpose, the armory was stocked with weapons of gleaming steel, and the people—my people—looked to me as their protector, their leader, their savior.

I became lost in it all.

Every day was filled with decisions, proclamations, and ceremonies. Every night brought feasts and celebrations in my honor. I was adored, revered, and I reveled in it. The power was intoxicating, the world bending to my every whim as long as I could convince the NPCs to believe it.

But the deeper I sank into the role, the more the lines between what was real and what was false blurred. The Piper, Maple, Skibidi—these memories flickered in and out of my mind like fleeting dreams, distant and unimportant compared to the life I had built here.

Until the day everything changed.

It was an ordinary afternoon. The sun was high, the courtyard bustling with life as merchants set up stalls and warriors sparred in the training yard. I wandered through it all, my presence enough to part crowds and draw bows of respect.

That’s when I saw her.

A book merchant, standing by a small, colorful stall stacked with leather-bound tomes and scrolls. She was beautiful, her hair dark and flowing, her eyes sharp and captivating. Her voice carried an enchanting lilt as she spoke with a customer.

But as I drew closer, something about her struck me wrong.

It wasn’t her appearance, though I couldn’t help but notice how perfect it was—too perfect. Her movements, her tone, even her smile—they were warm and inviting, but there was something hollow beneath the surface.

She reminded me of Maple.

The realization hit me like a slap, and I froze in place. It wasn’t just that she looked familiar—it was the feeling she gave me. That same intoxicating comfort, that same sense of being understood and seen.

And with that came a flood of memories.

I hadn’t forgotten that this world wasn’t real, but I had pushed it to the back of my mind, buried it beneath the weight of my new life. Now, staring at this woman who felt so much like Maple, it all came rushing back.

This wasn’t real. None of it.

The thought made my chest tighten, the weight of everything I’d built suddenly pressing down on me like a crushing tide.

But before I could dwell on it, a commotion broke out in the courtyard.

Shouts and the clatter of armor echoed across the open space as a group of my soldiers marched through the gates, dragging two prisoners behind them. The crowd parted, murmurs rippling through the onlookers as the soldiers forced the captives to their knees in the center of the courtyard.

“Commander!” one of the soldiers called, his voice sharp and commanding. “We’ve captured two criminals attempting to sneak into the fortress.”

I stepped forward, my heart pounding as I approached the scene. The prisoners were bound, their faces obscured by sacks, their shoulders slumped in defeat.

“Let me see them,” I ordered, my voice steady despite the unease creeping into my chest.

The soldier nodded and stepped back, yanking the sacks from their heads.

I stopped dead.

Gregory and Tianna knelt before me, their faces battered and bruised but unmistakable.

Their eyes widened as they looked up at me, and I saw a flicker of something in their expressions—relief, disbelief, and maybe even a hint of anger.

“Glenn?” Tianna’s voice was hoarse but steady. “Is that you?”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak.

The world I had built, the identity I had claimed, the life I had embraced—it all came crashing down around me in that moment.

Because here they were, flesh and blood, real in a way this place never could be.

“Commander?” one of the soldiers asked, his voice hesitant. “What should we do with them?”

I looked down at Gregory and Tianna, my mind racing.

For the first time in months, I felt like I didn’t know who I was anymore.

My first reaction was rage. It consumed me instantly, boiling up from the pit of my stomach and spreading like wildfire. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat loud and deliberate, as though it were driving the storm inside me.

Thrum.

Thrum.

Thrum.

The sight of Gregory and Tianna, kneeling there, bruised and bound, sent a torrent of emotions crashing through me. Betrayal. Anger. Resentment. The people I trusted most had left me to die, and now here they were, caught sneaking into my fortress—into my domain.

My fists clenched at my sides as the anger demanded to be heard. Words burned on the edge of my tongue, sharp and cruel, ready to be unleashed.

But before I could speak, something strange happened.

At first, I thought it was the adrenaline, the way the world always seemed to slow down in moments of intensity. But this was different. The soldiers froze in place, their hands still gripping Gregory and Tianna. The wind stopped moving, the banners hanging from the battlements falling unnaturally still. Even the faint hum of the bustling fortress behind me ceased entirely.

Time had stopped.

I blinked, my breath catching in my throat. The silence was deafening, the stillness suffocating.

Then I saw him.

On the battlement above the courtyard, leaning casually against the stone wall, was the Piper. He wasn’t playing this time; the pipes rested at his side, and his dark eyes—those infinite, star-speckled eyes—were fixed on me.

Before I could speak, he moved. With a flick of his wrist, he tossed something through the air.

I barely had time to react before my hands moved instinctively, catching it.

The pipes.

I stared down at them in my hands, their surface smooth and cool, the faint hum of their power thrumming against my skin. When I looked back up, he was gone.

Time resumed.

The noise of the courtyard rushed back in all at once—the shuffling of soldiers, the murmurs of the crowd, the crackle of the banners in the breeze.

I stood there, staring at the pipes in my hands, the weight of them more than physical. The rage that had consumed me moments before seemed to dissolve, replaced by a single, undeniable truth.

It didn’t matter if that had truly been Kjäll or just an image, a manifestation of this world bending to my need. His presence—real or not—meant the same thing.

Mercy.

I took a deep breath, the pipes still clutched tightly in my hand, and turned to the soldiers.

“Free them,” I said, my voice calm but firm.

The soldier nearest to me hesitated. “But, Commander, they—”

“Free them,” I repeated, my tone leaving no room for argument.

The soldiers obeyed, cutting Gregory and Tianna’s bonds. They both staggered slightly as they rose to their feet, their eyes fixed on me with a mix of confusion and caution.

I met their gazes, holding the pipes tightly in my hand. “You’re not criminals,” I said, my voice steady. “You’re free to leave or stay. The choice is yours.”

Gregory and Tianna exchanged a look, but neither spoke.

Without another word, I turned and walked back toward the fortress, the pipes in my hand a quiet reminder of what had just happened.

For the first time in a long time, I felt the weight of my choices. This world may have been mine to shape, but that didn’t mean I was free to ignore what it demanded of me.

And as I passed through the gates and into the halls of my fortress, one thought lingered in my mind:

Mercy wasn’t just for them. It was for me, too.

As I stepped through the gates into the fortress, the air grew heavy, the temperature dropping so quickly that my breath fogged in the chill. The torches along the walls flickered, their flames shrinking to faint, struggling embers.

Then it hit me.

A pressure like nothing I’d ever felt before crashed down on me, driving me to my knees. It was as if the weight of the entire world had been placed on my shoulders. My chest tightened, my vision blurred, and a sharp, stabbing pain pulsed through my skull.

I clutched at the ground, trying to steady myself, but the floor beneath me wasn’t steady. It writhed, pulsing like it was alive, the cold stone shifting into something warm and fleshy.

Voices rose around me, faint at first but growing louder—laughter, whispers, screams—all blending into a chaotic symphony of sound.

Then her voice cut through it all.

“Poor, fragile Glenn,” she purred, soft yet commanding, dripping with mocking sweetness. “Even with all your power, you remain so… breakable.”

“Who—” I tried to speak, but my throat tightened, the words choking in my chest.

“You know who I am,” she said, the laughter fading as her tone turned sharp and cold. “I am Naamah. I am the one who brought you back from the woods, from the chains of the leshy. It was my will that unbound you, Glenn. My will that returned you to yourself. And yet, you dare to question me?”

The walls of the fortress dissolved into a swirling void of shadows and light. A throne emerged before me, massive and jagged, its surface pulsing with a dark, blood-red glow. Upon it sat a figure cloaked in shadow, her form shifting and indistinct, yet undeniably present.

“You amuse me,” she continued, her voice wrapping around me like silk. “With your defiance, your clever little games. But tell me, Glenn—what has it all earned you? A crumbling temple of lies, built on the backs of puppets who would cease to exist without your belief.”

Her words struck deep, but before I could respond, an image appeared in the swirling void beside her.

It was me—my body, but not me.

I was walking through the mortal world like a machine, my movements stiff and robotic, my eyes empty. The same hollowness I’d seen in those glazed-over people when this all began.

She laughed, a low and mocking sound. “Do you wish to return to this?” she taunted. “To this life of obscurity, chasing mysteries that no one cares about? Writing your little stories for the few who even bother to read them—and the even fewer who believe you?”

The image shifted. I saw myself again, sitting alone in a dimly lit room, surrounded by books and notes, my face drawn and tired. The loneliness radiated from the scene, a sharp, familiar ache that I couldn’t deny.

“You can stay here,” she said, her tone softening into a tempting sweetness. “Here, you are a king. A savior. Here, you are adored, respected, worshipped. All that I ask is a small thing in return. The interlopers—Gregory and Tianna—they do not belong. Hand them over to me, and Paradise is yours. Forever.”

Her presence pressed down harder, the pain in my head growing unbearable as her words coiled around me.

I tried to speak, to answer, but my thoughts were a tangled mess of fear, doubt, and temptation.

“Think carefully, Glenn,” she hissed, her voice sharper now. “This is the only life where you matter. Out there? You are nothing. Here, you can have everything.”

My throat tightened as I forced out a response. “Let me… think.”

The laughter returned, cruel and echoing, as the shadows around her throne surged closer.

“Yes,” she said, her voice dripping with satisfaction. “Think long and hard, my dear. And when you are ready to make the right choice, I will be waiting.”

The void around me collapsed, the world snapping back into place as I found myself kneeling on the cold stone floor of the fortress. The pain in my head subsided, but her words lingered, heavy and inescapable.

The image of my empty, robotic self walking through the mortal world burned in my mind, a cruel reminder of what waited for me if I refused her offer.

And yet, somewhere beneath the fear and doubt, a single thought stirred, faint but persistent:

Was it better to be nothing in the real world… than everything in a lie?

I stood there for a moment, the cold stone beneath me grounding me in a reality I wasn’t sure was mine anymore. Naamah’s words lingered in my mind, her taunts echoing like a cruel refrain: This is the only life where you matter.
