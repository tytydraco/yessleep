They clung to the edge of the shell crater like a drowning man to driftwood. The rattle of the MG 08’s and the shriek and boom of artillery muffled all the shouts and cries and screams. A burst of bullets skipped across the top of the hole like a smooth stone across a calm lake. They heard a whistling like a distant kettle and then heard nothing but an almighty ringing in their ears, their very minds.

“Are you hit?” Tommy screamed over the chaos of the battlefield. William’s hearing came back in  He fired one, twice from the lip of the defilade, not aiming at any spot in particular, just in the general area that the Germans were in. Squeeze the trigger, work the bolt, don’t look at the rotting corpse to your left. Just keep the rhythm. William thought. Just like training.

William patted himself down. He checked his chest, his legs. He felt wet down the leg of his trousers. Blood from a wound he feared, the mud of No Man’s Land he hoped, piss from fear he knew.

Tommy’s Springfield Rifle lay some yards away, half submerged in stagnant crater water, the butt splintered from a machine gun bullet.

“I don’t think…no, I’m okay. I’m fine.” William called.  His fingers continued to search along his kit. His canteen had been struck; what little water he had left sloshed below the impact line. That thin, metal bottle had stopped much of the force of the bullet. It had probably been a ricochet anyway. He pressed his side. Blinding light and a feeling in his throat like he might hurl confirmed his fears.

A flash and roar like a thunderstorm from Hell erupted above them. And again. And again. William clasped his hands over his ears and screamed. He screamed for God, he screamed for his mother, he screamed for anyone or anything that could make it stop.

He could not die. Not here. Not in some devastated spit of land thousands of miles from home. Not while Martha waited for him. And not next to this carcass.

The body had been dead for some time, maybe even since the start of the war. A mud splattered uniform made him impossible to identify. His helmet, along with the entire top of his head, had been blasted into a ruin of metal and bone. His eyes had rotted away, or else been picked clean by the legion of rats that infested the area.

And suddenly, it grew quiet. The guns had stopped. And in that silence, the horror grew. Groans, moans, screeching horses and screaming men.

Dirt had showered William. It got on his neck, down his shirt, it stuck to his sweat soaked face and piss and blood stained pants like metal to a magnet.

William’s eyes grew wide as he saw the red-brown patch on Tommy’s side grow. “Oh, Christ!” He scrambled over the dirt and debris to his friend. “Tommy, your mask!” There was a chunk of shrapnel the size of William’s fist through the glass lense of the right eye socket of Tommy’s gas mask. It had punched clean through and lodged in his hip.

“I’m okay. I mean I’ve been hit, but I’m not dying here. The Germans haven’t deployed gas. Listen…no gas gong. We’re okay, Will.”

There were more screams now, more choking some muffled, all very human in their commiseration.

The corpse in the shell hole seemed to turn to look at William now,  its eyeless sockets fixed right on him. Look up. William heard the voice in his mind, clear as if Tommy had said it.

William crawled away from Tommy and carefully, slowly, peered over the top.

It seemed like fog at first. It had a similar consistency. A sort of soupy, yellow-brown cloud was approaching, rolling over men and horses and devastation, inevitable as the ocean tide.

Gas. Mustard gas by the look of it. A mere touch causes your skin to blister. William did not want to imagine what happened if you inhaled it.

“Tommy! Gas!”

Thomas Totman, Private First Class, Brother, Son, William Lafevre’s best friend, drew his trench knife and advanced.

The blade was nicked from use. The brass knuckles attached to the handle, so proudly maintained through the first weeks of combat, were worn and cracked in places. But that blade was sharp. Sharp as the day was long. And today was July 4th, not far from the longest day of the year.

The knife cut through cloth and flesh as if they were butter. It sank to the hilt, retreated, and charged in again with the same ease as before. William went stiff and half rolled, half tumbled down the crater, next to the skeletal remains of one who came before.

The eyeless face, the exposed jaw and teeth, all seemed to grin at William as blood bubbled from his lips.

Tommy was on him again, though this time with searching hands. William tried to push him away, but his arms felt funny, his fingers numb.

Tommy snatched the rubber gas mask from William’s hip. It amazed him that something so small, so fragile, so unknown to them both until a few months ago, would not only destroy their decades long friendship, but also end his life.

Tommy pulled the mask on, squeezing it over his head and checking to make sure it sealed properly. Then he sat, pulled his legs to his chest and rocked back and forth, his breath misting the lenses.

The gas rolled over the lip of the crater, the smoke of a million cigarettes blown down a narrow stairwell. William tried to crawl away, maybe to the dead man, maybe he had a working mask.

His chest was screaming, begging for relief, and his useless arms did nothing but twitch at his side. The dead man’s jaw slammed open like a drawbridge, and he started laughing, cackling, as the gas descended to the bottom of the crater.
