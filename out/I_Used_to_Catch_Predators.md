Kids go missing all the time in Small Falls, so I tried not to look too panicked entering the school for the parent-teacher conference. Unfortunately, the cops outside were killing my vibe.

We get missing kids in the neighborhood and now they bring in cops to loiter around the school. Where was this energy when I was a kid, boys in blue? You were needed then.

Passing two donut lovers sitting in their blue and white cars, their lights flashed in silence in the January evening darkness, I tried to avoid eye contact with the final one, wasting tax-payer money standing beside the school door. 

“Sir?” the waste of taxpayer money oinked out.

Playing the role of the kind suburban Dad today I smiled at him for half a second and then thought , actually fuck him, I pushed the door handle.

"Sorry, sir, you have to go through the metal detector on this side."

And well, being the perfect law-abiding, no-felony having, tax-paying citizen I am, I obeyed this fine upstanding protector of the peace without complaint.

And, of course, he gave me trouble when the metal detector beeped.

"Sir, do you have anything in your pockets?"

"Just a piece?"

"A piece, sir?"

"Yeah, like a gun—a small one, though. So no worries."

"Sir, this is a gun-free zone. I, uh, understand if you didn't know, so no problem this time. I'm going to have to ask you to put it in your car."

"We've got kidnappers around and I've got to put my gun up? In fact, what are you even doing here? Go save those kids."

"Uh, uh, uh, sir—"

"Uh, uh, uh," I imitated.

"Please, sir," he whimpered.

*You see how he's disrespected me, right?*

It wouldn't be my first time proving to somebody they couldn't talk to me any type of way. I sized him up. Skinny white kid, low haircut, eyes said, help not hurt, only one tattoo all that meant he was fresh out of the academy, remnants of acne littered his face so probably for the first time in his life he could afford acne cream. And for that reason only, I didn't beat his ass.

Kids deserve a chance to grow. 

If you’re reading this and know me, don’t you dare put weakness on my name. He's the last person in this story I show mercy to. 

Anyway, I obeyed him and put my gun in the car. Which made me run late and threw off my game a bit.

Sweating and stumbling into the kid's classroom, his last known appearance, my nerves were getting the better of me. Dad mode wasn’t something I was used to.

"Hi, I'm Mr. Smith, but you can call me Jimmy," I blurted to the teacher as soon as I entered the classroom like a good suburban Dad would . In and out. Get this over with.

The kid's teacher jumped in her seat when she saw me. My large tatted arms and two teardrop tattoos below my eye tend to have that effect on people.

"Hi," I said, not stopping for a second but sliding into what I assumed was my designated seat in front of her desk.

"You're Lee's Dad?" she asked, her rainbow-colored glasses tipping as she judged me up and down. "We have a different image of his guardian in our system."

"Oh, he's dead."

"Excuse me?"

"The original guardian is dead."

"Oh, and you are to Lee?"

"His uncle... by adoption."

"Right..." she said, disbelief obvious on her face.

"You can check the system now? I think they updated it."

I looked around the room as she went tapping away on her computer, once eyeing me with a suspicious glare, and then I guess I was on there because she nodded and we got to the meeting.

"So, James Smith..." she said.

"Call me Jimmy," I whispered, shocking myself at my nerves. Cops I could deal with. What's another fight, after all? But people judging me who I can't hit? I caught myself crossing my legs like a virgin on a wedding night. Embarrassing.

"Ms. Francesca," she stood up from her desk to shake my hand and introduce herself.

Wobbling out of the seat I shook her slender hand in an awkward grip, unsure of whether to be firm or gentle.

"Sorry," I said, sitting again. "First parent-teacher conference."

"Oh, does your wife normally do these?"

"Huh? No," I chuckled at the thought of me being married.

"Then who comes to these since you've been the guardian?"

I shrugged.

"Well, this is the first one," I fumbled out the words. "It felt like an emergency. You said my son's missing. Yeah, he's just ditching school. I see him at home."

Outside of the window, one of the three police cars sped out of the parking lot, sirens blaring. Our necks jerked to the window.

"I wonder where he's going," she said. "It must be an emergency because they aren't supposed to leave because of the situation at hand."

Her suspicious glare left the window and darted in my direction.

"Yeah, odd," I said.

Outside, the second of three police cars whirled out of the parking lot.

"Now wait a minute," she said. "What could make them leave? They promised us 24/7 surveillance."

"Maybe they caught the guy," I shrugged.

The third and last police car zipped away, my guess driven by Officer Clear Skin who gave me a tough time at the front. The officer left tire marks as he whisked away.

"Yeah," I said. "They definitely had to catch the guy for all of them to leave. You alright, Ms. Francesca?"

"Yes, I'm fine," she bit back.

"Is anyone else supposed to be here tonight?" I asked.

"No, just the custodian Wilfred. The man's so old he can't hear a thing though."

"I bet."

She eyed me.

"Just making conversation," the smile I gave her was so bad she sneered at it.

"Right," she said. "Now about your son. So, I specialize in troubled youth actually. Playing hooky or ditching school is usually attention-seeking behavior."

"Oh, is it?"

"Yes, is he receiving enough attention at home?"

"Yep, sure is."

The heavy bang of the entrance door slamming outside made us both jump in our seats.

"Hey, hey," I announced and stood up. "What's going on here? You telling me old man Wilson is slamming doors like that?"

"It's Wilfred," she said.

"Whatever."

I reached for my gun that I kept at my waistband. Then cursed myself for actually obeying a rule.

"Should we call the cops?"

"You want the cops here?" She asked me as if I would have some issue with cops. I did, but still.

"Listen," I said. "I'm trying to be a good guy here. Can you give me a break?"

Something ran down the hall—boots, a lot of footsteps charging in our direction.

"Lady, you don't even know when we're about to get jumped."

"What's his middle name?"

"Wilbur's? I don't know, lady. This is the first I'm hearing of the guy."

"The custodian's name is Wilfred, and I was referring to your son's name."

My breath got caught in my lungs. I was the shoplifting kid caught with a few less items on his receipt at Walmart. The husband caught at the titty bar, pregnant wife waving the ones he tossed on the floor in one hand and smacking him with the other. All I could think was that one song with Shaggy: wasn't me.

"Wasn't me," I said.

"What? Mr. Smith, what is your nephew’s middle name?"

Voices speeding toward us brought me to the present.

"Screw you," I told her. "I'm calling the cops."

"What's Lee's middle name?" she asked.

Despite the shame and embarrassment, I did it. Each digit of 9-1-1 a slash on my reputation.

The phone rang and my heart ain’t want to beat no more. Bursting into the classroom and piling out of the door, a group of ski-mask-wearing men invaded.

"9-1-1, what is your emergency?" the operator on the phone said.

"This is Jimmy Smith. We're being attacked," I yelled to the operator.

Ms. Francesca screamed.

All according to my plan, Ms. Francesca and I were kidnapped.

Hours later, we were somewhere else dark and hot. A little room in an abandoned warehouse that even junkies know not to go near because miscreants like me 'unalive' people here, as the kids say.

Withering walls and a musty scent possessed the room, making it intolerable for a human to live in.

Speaking of possessed, the room was littered with Christian symbolism. Red Latins crosses splattered the walls. Symbols of the trinity stared down at us from the ceiling, all lit by one flickering light bulb.

Ms. Francesca and I were not alone.

A babbling homeless man stared at two cans of the off-brand soda Dr. Brown in the corner. His eyes never left the soda, but it felt like he couldn't understand the soda's existence either, if that makes sense.

In the corner to the homeless man's left, a laptop sat on top of a pile of loose-leaf paper.

I stood in the middle of the room, proud of my little plan, and in front of me was Ms. Francesca Frank. Her wrists were chained to the ceiling so she hung in a vertical position.

She wore the same clothes, a blue dress that fell below her knees (one of the frumpy looking-ones with pockets), and rainbow glasses. I, on the other hand, put on some interesting jewelry. 

On each finger, I wore a ring with a crucifix, blessed by the Pope himself.

"Mr. Smith, or sorry, Jimmy?" Francesca said. "Could you help me down? I, uh, I think we've been kidnapped. Someone's been snatching children from Small Falls, y'know. It appears they've done the same to us."

"Nah, c'mon, you had to have guessed I'm not doing that."

"Did you do this to me? Nothing's happened to me yet. You don't have to go through with this."

"Oh, I do. I owe somebody and you owe somebody," I said and tilted my head to the spaced-out homeless man.

"Jimmy, I assure you you are mistaken. You're playing a dangerous game. Think of Lee, think of your son."

"Who the f - - oh Lee? Oh, he's just a kid who wanted to make some money."

"Oh, wait... no, what?"

"Yeah, I registered five different kids in the 8th grade, all hoping for the chance to have a parent-teacher conference with the legendary Ms. Francesca Frank."

"Five different kids? In a public school system, sir, do you know how impossible that is that—"

"Do you know how much I hate you?" I asked and then got annoyed. "Also, you're insulting me here. You work for an underdeveloped and under-financed school and under-given a fuck about school. Your administration is three bribes away from naming the school after me. Hey, in fact, respectfully, I've pulled off way bigger jobs than you."

In a knuckle dragging crawl, the homeless man skittered to Francesca She screamed. I paused. The homeless man reached in her pocket and pulled out her phone and then skittered back to his place behind the Dr. Brown’s.

“Ooookay,” I said. “Where were we?”

"I am sorry, I am so so sorry. Um, you said legendary, earlier? I'm a teacher for inner-city youth. What did I give you a bad grade or something?"

"What makes you think I was an inner-city youth?"

"Well, no offense, it's just the - -"

"Fun fact, I was a nice private school kid for a bit."

"I am sorry for stereotyping you, for people like me stereotyping you. I am sure for a lot of your life - -"

"Enough, enough, lady. You've never done anything to me."

She broke down. She cried. And she asked the one question I needed for her to ask.

"Then why am I here?"

"I'm so glad you asked. You, Francesca Frank, are here to hear a true story from a friend of mine."

"Jimmy..."

"Shh, Francesca, these are the last written words of a good man." And like a teacher, I waited for absolute silence. The chains couldn't rattle, the light couldn't buzz; this was the most important story I could tell.

This was the life of my friend Dave:

At 17 years old, my revenge on evil was catching child predators.

At 13, I learned it's not strangers who are the real danger. 

I spent my 14th year of life learning Lady Justice was not only blind but lazy.

"Sorry, nothing we can do," the cops said.

At 15, I learned if the bruise doesn't leave a scar, no one cares if it heals.

At 16, late nights with unrestricted internet, I learned there's always something you can do via the show To Catch a Predator on YouTube.

By my senior year, my best friend Jimmy's and I actions resulted in the arrest of ten predators. Not the guy who I wanted to arrest, but this was good. This was something we could do. My one saving grace and my downfall now is that I couldn't stop talking, I couldn't stop telling the truth.

Jimmy and I ran a YouTube channel where we would pretend to be twelve-year-old girls via text, and once intent was gathered via nudes sent or words implying sex, we would invite the guys over to film their attempt and interview them and then hand it over to the police. We kept it all under NC state code 14-202.3. Therefore, arrests were made. 

No funny business. We weren't even popular on YouTube. Maybe a couple hundred subscribers and a thousand views. Oh, and one sponsor thanks to Dr. Brown soda (it's just off-brand Dr. Pepper).

A few nights ago, I attempted a solo predator capture with a guy from Discord who called himself Fun Frank333. I lost my mind in the process. I write this after waking up alone under a bridge; I’ve lost my battle with lucidity most days.

Regardless, here are some excerpts from the texts we got from a guy who called himself Fun Frank.

Fun Frank333: Are you a virgin?

Me: Yes, so I'm really nervous

Fun Frank333: You're not lying to me, are you?

Fun Frank333: It's really important that you're a virgin.

Me: Yes, I'm 12??? Why wouldn't I be a virgin?

Fun Frank333: Never mind that. Just I'll be in trouble if you aren't.

Yes, this did give me pause because virginity is usually lower on their concerns. Usually, they're more concerned about getting caught.

Fun Frank333: Hello?

Fun Frank333: Hello?

Fun Frank333: C'mon don't you back out on me too?

Me: Hi, yes I'm here. Um, who would you be in trouble with lol?

Fun Frank333: No, no, no, no, don't worry darling. Don't worry, baby. Did Daddy scare you?

Fun Frank333: Nobody, baby. You don't need to worry about it.

This did frighten me, because Jimmy wouldn't be coming this time. Jimmy was the muscle of the operation despite his private school upbringing. I'm pretty sure the only reason he agreed to do this for me was because it gave him the chance to hit the predators (or worse) if they attacked me.

Jimmy came from luxury, but it looked like he wanted to leave it the way he behaved, but that wasn't exactly the case. Jimmy just wanted to pave his own way; that way just happened to be violent.

At 13, Jimmy learned he was a bastard, and the man he thought was his father taught him exactly what that meant in his home.

At 14, Jimmy learned a lot of friendships don't make it through middle school, and the bathroom, despite the smell, flushing, and plopping sound in the next stall, might be where you have to eat.

"Here, you can share my headphones so we don't have to hear it. It's not that bad then," I told him as we shared our meal in the boys' bathroom.

At 15, Jimmy learned most people liked you as much as you can be useful; too bad he didn't have talents.

At 16, Jimmy learned being strong and hitting things was a talent.

At 17, Jimmy learned being strong and hitting things on camera could make him a legend and thrust him into the spotlight of crowds his thirteen-year-old self couldn't believe.

If my saving grace was my need to yap out the truth, Jimmy's was his need to keep getting stronger.

By senior year, I hoped he knew by then I liked him for more than what he could do for me; he was my brother. No, I knew he did because I think that's why he ditched me that day.

Jimmy wanted to hang with some of his more... tough friends.

"Jimmy, this guy's weird, man," I said. "You sure you can't come? I'm worried."

"What, you need me to wipe you too?"

"Ew, come on, Jimmy..."

"Bruh, you'll be fine." Jimmy didn't look at me as we talked. "They're perverts. If you're trying to bang a kid, you're not tough—it's like biology or something."

"Yeah, but I think this guy might have connections..."

"Bruh, I'm not coming, alright? That's it. I'll play detectives or whatever with you later. I gotta go with my boys, aight?"

"Yeah, see ya, Jimmy."

The prospect of human trafficking was a real danger in our hobby. However, predators had ruined enough of my life, so I wouldn't back down. My glasses with a camera in them were my only companion.

That evening, I walked through each empty room of the sting house, also known as my parents' house. Each echoing room of the five-bedroom house seemed tomb-like and wrong. And it was wrong, in ways Frank didn't even know, five empty bedrooms for parents that were never there and two children that never existed.

I'm not sure why my parents never had more children. I've heard hints that they tried and it resulted in stillbirths. When I was alone, the screech of the old house sounded like my siblings' ghosts.

Maybe my parents didn't have more kids because of what happened to me. When they're alone, I think they blame me. They whispered to themselves at night, filling the halls with elfish echoes that creeped at my door. Late at night, with the wind seeping in between the cracks of the wall, "how was your day" and "he was a mistake" sound similar.

Anything from intimacy to familiarity could answer the question of what they said, but they were rarely home. I was able to do so many predator catches because they were away on work trips all the time.

Turning off every light upstairs to save power like a good kid should, I wandered downstairs to the kitchen where the orange sky brought struggling evening light into the kitchen. I settled into my couch and watched the driveway camera waiting for Fun Frank to pull in.

The closer it got to the hour, the more frightening Frank became over text. No child predator was like Fun Frank.. 

Fun Frank: Rough good?

Me: Idk about that.

Fun Frank: Rough better

Fun Frank: for first time. Trust me.

Fun Frank: neighbors not noisey?

Fun Frank: \*nosey

Me: No they leave me alone.

Fun Frank: parents gone fall weekend, right?

Fun Frank: \*all

Fun Frank: haha I meant all. Sorry, texting and driving. I'm a bad boy.

Fun Frank: but you're the one in handcuffs right?

Me: Haha yes, they’re gone all weekend. Handcuffs?

Fun Frank: I'm going to be a couple hours late?

Fun Frank: \*!

Fun Frank: do you like religion?

Me: It’s fine.

The moon peaked at me in between clouds. My stomach begged for a snack but fear whispered for me to stay and I obeyed. I knew he would come as soon as I got up for something and then maybe come for me from behind and then... I piled another blanket on me hiding me from my fears as I waited for Frank’s arrival.

Fun Frank: how much do you weigh?

Fun Frank: tiny little girl

Me: Idk like 100 pounds.

Fun Frank: I like that!

Fun Frank: I'm gong to be a couple more hours late

Fun Frank: \*going

Fun Frank: have you been baptized? It's important.

Me: Huh?

Hunger left me knowing it wouldn't be satisfied. Too many blankets rested on me like corpses in a hole during the black plague. I sweat as the cloth choked me and gave me nightmares that were so close to coming true. Black clouds hid the moon so I was well and truly alone, and according to my cameras, that is when Fun Frank arrived at 3:33, the Witching Hour.

Fun Frank: is it okay if I draw a little blood?

I woke up to the covers stripped from my body, Fun Frank’s black tie grazing my chest, and his hands exploring my waist. His peppermint breath blasted me and the stench of his sweaty suit draped over me like a vile breath.

"Shh," he said with a face frighteningly full of folds, more pug-like than human. "Just checking for something."

I screamed, scared out of my mind. Pressing my hands into his chest, he didn't budge. I lacked Jimmy's power; I couldn't move him.

"Quiet," he said.

I yelled.

"Quiet," he commanded.

He waited, almost like Fun Frank wanted me to know this fact: I could not move him. I knew once evidence was recorded I would need to call the police quickly.

And only after I obeyed him did he get off of me.

"See," he said. "We're cool. Just listen to Frank and you'll be fine. It's Frank. I'm Frank. It's just Frank. You're Judy's brother, right? Judy says you're cool, you won't snitch, right?"

"Yeah, um, yeah."

"Cool, cool. 'Preciate it, kid. Here for your troubles," Frank handed me a lollipop.

I checked it once and placed it on the desk beside me.

"Smart kid," he said. "Candy from strangers and all that."

"Yeah," I said, composing myself. The next part would be hard; I had to get him to confess to being Fun Frank so the police would have enough evidence to convict him. "So, you're Fun Frank?"

"Yep."

"Oh, the one who's been sending my sister those messages?"

"Yeah, that's me."

"You want to have sex with her?"

"Well, I'm certainly not here to read her a bedtime story."

"What?"

"Yes, sex, kid, sex. I'm here to bang. Where's she at?"

"Oh, that was easy," I said, prepared to work for a much harder confession. "Well, there's something you should know. I'm Dave Akman and you're being recorded right now for an exposé on predator catching. Can you take a seat?"

"Wait, what?"

"Online solicitation of minors is illegal under state code 14-202.3. Can you please sit down and--"

Fun Frank ran away, which was typical, but against all common sense, he didn't run to his car outside. Fun Frank333 ran upstairs, up my house.

The action confused me so much I glanced at my laptop like it could have some sort of answer. However, it only made me ask one question aloud.

"Where was Frank's car?" There was no car in the driveway. "Did he take an Uber? Why would he leave an electronic trail? And no, he said he was driving." I said to myself.

I followed him up the steps and saw him running from my parents' room to mine.

"Where's your sister?" Frank asked.

"What? No," I said. "There is no sister."

"You a virgin?" he asked, out of breath and exhausted from the little running he did.

"Well, I mean, excuse me, wait what?"

"You'll do then."

Fear fled Frank's face and a stale, sincere mask of serenity fluttered onto it. Frank took a gentle step forward, like a leaf crackling in a fire. Frank's back heaved and then relaxed as he took in a big breath of oxygen.

"Sorry," Frank said, the word coming out twisted and gargled.

"Sorry," Frank said again, the word came out hellishly deep.

"Sorry," Frank said, and the word came out... sultry.

Against reason. Against nature. Frank changed. His stomach went flat like an Ozempic miracle. The hair on his face, the folds on his chin, and even that hairy mole beneath his lip left in smoke. Smoke gowned his body until he changed. Fun Frank did not even look like a man, more like a Kardashian.

"Hi," Frank said in a whisper of a voice that could make any man listen. "You can call me Francesca now."

"What, uh, what, uh, are you?"

"Do you want to ask questions," Francesca said, sauntering over to me in her oversized suit. "Orrr? Do you want to play?" She reached out to touch me and I jerked back out of my room, stumbling out and falling in the hallway.

"I'm calling the police," I said and reached for my phone.

"Kid," she said. "The phone is always the first thing I take. Or did you think I was trying to tuck you in earlier?" She waved it in front of me.

"Give me that," I said, diving for it and knocking her over. We crashed to the floor and I wrestled for my phone. Even in this form she was stronger than me and pinned me to the ground.

"Okay, kid. When I say fun, I mean sex. Look, I'm hot, right? You want me, right?"

"No!"

"I've been doing this for centuries; young boys want sex."

"Get off of me."

"Well, no, no I won't be doing that. You see, I'm here to damage a soul. I thought it would be through the degradation of youth through something they're not ready for. But actually... there's another option, one I don't need your permission for. I can touch your soul another way and you don't even need to approve."

"Oh, don't mind me," Ms. Francesca said, pouring her hands into my mouth and opening me. She put one hand on the roof of my mouth and the other pushed against the bottom row of my teeth as if she were an evil dentist who could only use her hands to strip away my cavities. "I'm just doing what I've been doing for centuries to those who don't know how to shut up," she said. "Ancient Egyptians made pyramids that lasted for centuries, and yet the people wilted like desert flowers in a flood when we did what they called bꜣ-šʿd." Pressing further, she peeled the roof of my mouth. Blood wept from the palate, staining her hands and feeding me so much pain. My cries were pointless. My tongue wandered as if it could help.

"Kings went mad and wet, somber fear silenced their throne rooms in Japan when they mentioned 魂斬り. Arab kings chose slavery and Arab slaves chose to be kings of dirt and worms rather than be forced to have قطع الروح thrust upon them." Fearing, freaking, and unable to speak, I used my tongue to batter her hand, pointless but desperate. The taste—burning like chili pepper—brought tears to my eyes that dribbled up my forehead and couldn't even come down because she tilted my head back so far, my tears only served to drown my eyes. At the same time, she was bitter and gag-inducing. I vomited, but because of my position what I threw up came right back down.

"The rampaging blood-lusting armies of the Apache could be forced to flee in single file line at the threat of bii' naahxaash. How many righteous or wicked popes do you think we've turned in the Medieval era through what they called sectio animae? There's no word for it in the West. You're all too busy pretending. But I think it would sound something like... Soul Slashing in your country."

She released me. Gazing up at her, I shuddered as she licked her fingers.

"You have a dark song in you," she mocked. "I heard it in your heart."

I shivered beneath her, an impossible cold froze me beneath her. 

"You don't understand why everyone stopped caring about the fact you were molested. Because you still hurt every day, don't you? Ohh, and then there's that dark, dark thought; everyone stopped caring because everyone would do the same, if they had the chance. Given the chance, everyone would hurt you. Everyone is like him"

She smiled and closed her eyes, with the self-satisfaction of a conductor in front of her orchestra.

"Now, that is a beautiful song to a demon." And with that, she moved her fingers like an evil conductor and out of thin air turned the space in front of her into musical notes. Absorbed and powerless, I watched as she made a row of notes and they wrapped around my head. Screaming at me my worst fear.

*They're all like him. They're all like him. They're all like him.*

And that song has possessed me ever since then, only granting me mere minutes of silence a day. I fear my fellow man because of it. Please, don't judge me too harshly if you see me. If you were forced to believe this song like I am, you too would live under a bridge alone and insane. If you see me, please be kind and ignore me; I can't help myself.

In my minutes of sanity a day, I try to explain my situation, but who would ever believe this? I thought I was writing this merely as a warning, but I realize no one would ever heed the warning of a babbling homeless man who lives under a bridge. All the predator catches. All the work I've done. It's all wasted. That hurts so much. So, I guess I write because I can, because I must, because I have to tell someone. It hurts so much and I can't go through it alone. Unfortunately, I still haven't learned my lesson yet. I still can't shut up.

"And that’s the end of the story, Frank or Francesca,” I told her, putting the stacks of paper beneath the laptop. The laptop which contains video of the said incident incriminating Francesca. 

"This is ridiculous,” Francesca said, rattling in her chains. “You're wasting your time. Put down that book!"

"Dave, I've heard this will hurt her very much. Enjoy your revenge, brother."

And I read the holy words in their original language. It took hours of practicing reading the original Greek from me and centuries of devotion of holy warriors across the world to discover these words and how to punish a demon and reveal its form. As wicked as I am, I spoke the words of the famous Nazarene, God in the flesh.

"Ὑπάγετε Φιμώθητι καὶ ἔξελθε ἐξ αὐτοῦ Τὸ ἄλαλον καὶ κωφὸν πνεῦμα, ἐγώ σοι ἐπιτάσσω, ἔξελθε ἐξ αὐτοῦ καὶ μηκέτι εἰσέλθῃς εἰς αὐτόν Παραγγέλλω σοι ἐν ὀνομάτι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐξελθεῖν ἀπ' αὐτῆς"

Francesca's skin swelled as if filling with pus. Her screams shook the room and she used words that made me blush. The words muffled as her cheeks swelled into torturous reddening circles. Between the mounds of her face, tears rained down the demon's eyes. Larger, wider, each part of her body swelled, painfully. Like an allergic reaction. Her obesity grew beyond what was humanly possible, she wheezed and wheezed until…

Pop! A sound like a gunshot came from her.

Sulfur and blood stench engulfed the room as a pool of blood rested below her.

I saw Francesca as she or it really was: a red, boil-filled demon with orange gumball-like eyes.

"Huh, that actually worked," I said.

The demon wheezed like a kid brought out of freezing water, trying to catch their breath.

I walked over to Dave, still babbling nonsense. That broke my heart. I was hoping that would heal him. Regardless, I grabbed one of two Dr. Brown's and poured one out.

"For us, brother," I said, unsure if he actually understood the action.

"Let me out," the demon groaned, pain and pitifulness so satisfactorily in their voice. "Let me out."

"Nah," I said.

"I can--"

"You can't do anything for me," I told her. "I'm only doing this to honor Dave. I'm trapping you here—forever."

"I can give you money! I am a demon of--"

"Francesca Frank, Frank Francesca, stop it, sweet cheeks. You're a demon of Hell and I'm a demon of Earth. After I'm done with you today, I'm going to hop on a call and scam an elderly woman out of her retirement fund. I'm a demon like you, but before I was bad, I was a kid, I was Jimmy, and Jimmy's best friend was a kid named Dave."

"He's a madman, a raving madman. I left him living under a bridge and screaming at cars!"

"Oh, but that's the thing about life, Francesca Frank. Sometimes you gotta scream. Sometimes you gotta holler until someone hears you. You'd be surprised who will take up a righteous cause."

A deep laugh came from the demon's throat without moving its mouth.

"Oh, you're a demon, huh?" It asked.

"I am the biggest and baddest the world has ever seen," I said with my full signature grin on display.

"How bad?"

"Evil, baby."

"Bad enough to let ten children die?"

"What?"

"Kids are going missing. You know that. It's been done by yours truly. I've got them tied in a basement. They'll starve down there. Oh, or, or, or, some of them might eat one another before they go. Oh, that's a guaranteed trip to my home where they'll see me and you, right? Since you're such a demon."

"What?" I asked. "No, no, I see what you're doing. Do you want me to let you out and some kids I don't care about get to live?"

"Yes."

"No."

"Fine, then so you're one of me. You're a real demon. I win."

"No..."

"Oh, yes I win. That's why I'm here: to make you people more like me and my kind."

"Yeah, okay," I said. "What if I just smacked you around until you told me where the kids are." I sent a punch to the center of the demon's gut. It sputtered out a nasty groan in pain. The pope's blessed rings finally came in handy.

"I'm not a demon, yeah, okay," I said, pounding both sets of his ribs.

"I'm the biggest," I said and proved it with a punch across their face.

Then with unrelenting malice, I walloped on the demon's face because I didn't want to hear anything else they had to say.

"I'm the baddest most dangerous thing--"

The real demon interrupted my rant to whisper something. Probably something disrespectful and, as you know, nobody disrespects me. I gave 'em a break from the walloping to raise its chin so I could hear this little back talk to my face.

Francesca chomped on my hand. Shocking pain shot through me. Revenge didn't cross my mind; ending the pain did. I tried to pull back my hand. She bit down harder, making the task impossible. In that stuffy room, coldness infected me somehow. I went in myself, wondering how anything could feel like this; fire in my hand and ice coldness consuming my body.

By her power, she let go.

"I said, ‘still not a demon though’," the real demon said, heaving. "Now let's see what your blood says about you? Get up, Jimmy. We're going for a Soul Slash."

But I couldn't get up and she knew that. I stayed there shivering in the cold she created.

"Uh-oh, I see what this is about."

"Shut up," I commanded. But just like what happened to Dave all those years ago, my world went black and I couldn't find Frank to hit him. I couldn't do the one thing I knew how to do. Frank spoke; I just had no idea where it came from.

"Oh, this is what it's about. When your Daddy found out you weren't his, what did he call you?"

"Shut up," I said.

"Oh, I know your Daddy. He walked to church but always answered when we called. So, Daddy probably called you a demon. And you kept trying to be a demon, didn't you? How many fights have you been in? And how many tattoos? Oh, so scary? Oh, you want to be me because nothing hurts when you're me. You can call me whatever you want and I'll nod my head and laugh because it's true. Oh, but you're still a little hurt because you still feel that guilt, don't you? You left your brother, Dave, and feel guilty about it. Oh, wait, it's worse than that."

"Please, stop," I begged, reliving the truth of his words as he spoke.

"You were there. You've never told a soul about that day but you were there! Because at the end of the day, he was your brother and you loved him. Oh, you saw!"

"You win, alright. Stop and I'll let you go."

"You saw me torturing your best friend and you ran out of the house because you saw a real demon! Something you can't beat. Something you could never beat!"

"You win, you win, you win."

"And that's what's been driving you. You fight and fight and fight because in the one fight you actually needed to be in, you ran away scared!"

I didn't move, only mumbled. It was hard to tell what was happening. I held myself and rocked back and forth.

Then gurgling, horrific gurgling, almost like a roar for a whole minute and I wondered what new horror Frank would spit at me, and then the lights came out.

Frank the demon was dead. The bottom of a can of Dr. Brown stuck from his mouth. Dave's hands were wrapped around his fat throat. Eventually, Dave released and turned to me.

"The- - the - - kids, Dave," I said.

Dave waved Francesca's phone at me. 

Clever guy, we could just use Apple Map history to tell where she'd been. Like Fun Frank/Francesca said, ‘Always grab the phone first’.

Dave’s eyes locked on me. The guilt flooded back. He couldn’t speak but he understood. Dave knew I betrayed him. I’ve killed a friend for robbing me before so I knew what I deserved. Homelessness really hadn’t done him well I see now. His wild eyes and scratched hands told a story of a man fighting for everything in life. The sweet kid I knew was gone.

"Dave, man. Alright, I owe you. I owe you a lot. I can set you up in a house. You don't got to forgive me or nothing. It happened and I never ask for apologies, man. I think they're worthless so I won't give you one, man. I don't need forgiveness. I've got stuff that can make your life better."

Dave rushed me. For the kill? I would let him. His body slammed into mine. Dave hugged me.

As the biggest and baddest demon on Earth, I didn't cry like a baby in my best friend's gross [beard.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/)
