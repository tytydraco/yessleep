Although it had been months since I cloned Adam's card and the NuMind corporation has since ceased operation, I still found that the door systems in their old building were working. I have taken it upon myself to investigate their headquarters directly as their recent actions have shown they are willing to silence people who seek the truth.

The access card stopped the alarm going off as I snuck into the rear of the building, using Adam's floorplan as a guide. The space inside was a small atrium, mostly an area to let people filter into one of the numerous corridors that lined the walls, but modernised with lots of glass and abstract art that now seemed to just amplify the echoes of my movement. Despite being at the back of the building I was still loath to turn on my torch in case someone from outside saw the beam, so I crept along with only a small red LED light to guide me.

NuMind has a four story tall building and my investigation began at the top and worked down. Given that the building still had power thanks to fire alarm laws and the area was shielded from outside view, I decided to take the lift. It gave a small shudder as I pressed it into life, but once it had woken up the ride was smooth. The top floor was open plan, as all of them are these days, and I stepped out into the dark office and let my eyes adjust as the light of the lift slid closed behind me. Empty desks and silence greeted me, all computers long gone. This wasn't a surprise, IT would have been sold off as the company dissolved. What I was after was paperwork, whiteboard drawings, and full bins; the kind of things that people forget about, or don't want to take responsibility for as their pay stops and their P45 arrives. Creeping forwards I began my search.

Unfortunately I was disappointed. Beyond some rotas, some advertising materials, and a very rancid lunchbox, there was nothing of value. Moving surprisingly easily in the dark office I rifled through everything I could. Even the executive offices, the top floor rooms I'd come for, were empty. The cleanout had been thorough, NuMind obviously learning lessons from the companies of the past.

The next floor down was the same, as was the floor below that, and I began feeling a hopelessness settle over me. I was risking jail time to be here, and it was all for nothing! Sweating and slightly panicked, I arrived back on the ground floor. Whoever had been through the building had been thorough, not a scrap of paper remained. Drained, disheartened, I bashed my hand against the wall. I had been so close! NuMind had been shut for months and I'd interviewed Adam almost six months ago, why had I delayed on this so much? I began pacing, angry at myself.

It was as I was moving around the downstairs that I suddenly noticed a door that I'd previously missed. Heavy and imposing, it blended into the wall like a bodybuilder trying to be inconspicuous. I double-checked Adam's map and saw that this door was missing from it. Something secret? Whatever it was, it caused the hairs to prickle on the back of my neck.

Cautiously I pushed, and it reluctantly swung open under my weight. An unfriendly concrete staircase greeted me, leading down to a second dark metal door at the bottom with a keypad glowing faintly next to it. I will freely admit that I was spooked. Dead fluorescent bulbs hung from the ceiling, the building's power apparently not reaching them, and a descent into the pitch black was not something I'd planned on when I'd set out for this. Thoughts of Beth and  Jack and all the other victims gave me courage though. Not being a fool I grabbed an abandoned chair to wedge the top door open before carefully descending into the gloom. 

The metal was cold to the touch, and didn't move at all at my push. The number pad glowed faintly, the only light in the stairwell, and I stared at the keys, experimentally I jabbed a few at random until I was rewarded with a harsh buzz. The door remained locked. I paused, considering my options, not wanting to let this opportunity to dive into NuMind's secrets slip through my fingers. All at once the numbers __1828__ floated through my mind, almost like deja vu. 

I froze, a trickling feeling running down my back.

Was this my memory? I scanned the inside of my own head, trying to find the root of the numbers that had just come to me, but it was lost in the darkness of my mind. No connections, just the numbers, closer to a feeling than anything solid. Hands shaking, I punched them into the keypad. A ping, a green light, and a shudder from the door as a magnetic latch released. I let out a shaky breath, not understanding what had just happened, thoughts racing.

_It'll lock again in a second_

Before the door could re-seal I pushed it away from the frame, and I received a blast of cold air thick with the smell of chemicals directly to the face for my effort. Throwing my sleeve in front of my mouth I moved forwards, the strange thoughts pushed out of my mind by the urgency of my discovery. 

The space beyond was a cramped corridor of bare plaster and glowing fluorescent bulbs. A gourney sat to one side, gleaming steel in the dry, acidic air. I shuddered slightly to look at it, another wave of deja vu echoing through me at the sight of the thing. What the hell was a gourney doing in the basement of a biotech company?

_Keep going_

Not wanting to touch the thing I kept moving, My footsteps reverberated loudly in the tight space, the pungent smell of disinfectant and acid getting stronger as I went. A strong sense of anxiety was growing within me as I moved, and I realised with a start that I was passing doors without checking them, my body taking me somewhere that my conscious mind wasn't aware of as if navigating a familiar old haunt. Seemingly at random, though with a sense of purpose, I stopped.

_I'm in here_

In front of me was a frosted glass door, the shapes of a space glowing fuzzily through it,

_Go in_

Whatever was making the smell was inside, and I found my eyes watering as I breathed air tasting of glass. The doorhandle was almost painfully cold under my palm.

_Go in! Go IN! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GO IN_

The hinges didn't make a sound as they swung open. Whisper quiet, like they always had beed, I knew the room inside before I saw it, as familiar to me as the back of my hand. My eyes passed over the banks of machines, the humming air conditioner and humidity controls, the chemical injectors and medication pumps, the neural interface computers and ECG readers; instead they went to the beds in the centre of the room, the focal point of tubes and wires and probes like some sort of technological rat king. Billions in investments centred on four beds.

_Which one am I? Show me show me show me_

The occupants of the beds were covered with sheets, unmoving human shapes shrouded in a way that could have seemed reverant if not for the tangle of cabling that had been jammed beneath the covers around the heads like grotesque black halos. I found myself moving towards them, bile mixing with the acetic air coming from the bodies in my throat.

_There!_

Slowly I took hold of one of the thin sheets and began drawing it back. The arm beneath was thin, emaciated. Dead. I breathed through my mouth at the smell of Formaldehyde rose. A woman's arm and shoulder, slight build. She'd been the first, the first we'd brought here.

_Show me what they did to me_

Shaking, I slid the covering off the cadaver's face.

Whatever was in my head fell silent, and instead I was faced with an overwhelming wash of alien grief and loss, emotions that weren't my own mourning the loss of a stranger I didn't know. There wasn't much left of the face before me. Large parts of the skull were missing above the nose, the space instead taken by coils of tubing that pumped a synthetic blood through the exposed brain. Electrode pads lay against the pink matter, and a trickle of saline ran across the surface down to a drain in the base of the head to keep things moist. I should have been repulsed, but the part of my brain that wasn't grieving for this person was processing the scene as distasteful but routine.

God help me I almost knew what this machinery was. In the silence I traced the wires back, following them to their inputs in the Neural Net Encoder. It was in sleep mode, but if I simply loaded a blank chip like so and began the process like this... Memories were coming to me now, old patterns of thought flowing back through the channels they'd been stripped out of. I operated the kit by memory, barely aware of what I was doing. If I just hit the switch here then I could make it-

The body on the bed screamed the moment the machine buzzed to life, an eerie howling moan of cracked lungs through a dry throat. Desiccated limbs thrashed as the computer lit the dormant brain like a reactor, pounding electric potential across each synapse and watching the result like a hawk, ready to carve each jolt into the femtoprocessor chip I'd just loaded into it. The realisation of what I'd done hit me and I hurled myself at the controls to make it stop.

The body relaxed as the computer released the electric shackles from around the brainstem, finally going mercifully still. I wanted to be sick. What was going on, and how did I know what those machines did?

_Because you helped make this place_

That couldn't be true. I've never been here before, would never be part of something like this.
_This place changed. You wanted to help people but you couldn't bear it when you saw the cost of that help. You didn't realise the price of making NuMind_

I'm not even a scientist! I'm a journalist, I always have been!

_You wanted to go public, and they silenced you with me_

I staggered back away from the beds, head spinning with memories of working in the offices upstairs. _Visions of myself as a neuroscientist, working to make a chip that could help paraplegics walk, give movement to the paralysed; feeling betrayal as my business partners began steering the company places it shouldn't have gone, making it a toy for the rich to become more intelligent, hearing how it would be "marketable"; the crushing unreality of hearing how they'd finally got the brain chips working like a human brain..._

I'd never been a scientist. The new memories clashed with a remembered life of cheap shared apartments and an English degree, failed writing and slop articles to scrape together rent.

_I'd kicked up a fuss. Too much of a fuss. They'd led me down here, told me they had a new solution..._
They'd silenced me, done what they had to do to stop this from getting out. The gloves hadn't been thick enough.

_They put me in your head to wipe you, to overwhelm you like I'd done the others. My mind helplessly being used to destroy, against my will.. But they put too much of me into you, enough that I could choose not to hurt you. Instead I've kept these memories safe. I'm working with you, Ian._

I could actually feel Lucy in the room with me now, both the  version in front of me on the table, and the passenger the chip had placed in my brain hovering behind me like a shadow.

_I chose not to destroy you, and now I need you to help me_

What do you mean?

_Kill me_

You're already dead.

_That isn't death_

I looked down again at the broken body, and the dormant brain inside the remains of Lucy's skull. _She'd been the first, but after she'd proven too strong they'd brought in the others. All of them lived half lives now._ I had to do something.

_To make up for what you've done..._

Guided by my memories of the facility, I began turning off the machines one by one, careful with the order. Even though the minds were dormant I made sure to work slowly, ensuring that there was no chance that I would wake them or add to their suffering any further. Lucy, the real Lucy, was the last, and I could practically feel her digital ghost watching as I slid her into darkness. The body on the bed let out the slightest gasp, barely more than textured air, as I did it. And then all at once I was the only one left. Alone in the room I'd apparently helped create, with one of my victims a thoughts-breadth away. I didn't know what to do.

_You tell the world what they did, and then we live our lives._

Almost subconsciously I began walking back towards the entrance. How would this work? And what did she mean "our lives"?

_We'll work that out Ian. But first you will tell everyone what you've discovered. Will you do that for me?_

I would. And now, I have. 

This is the end of my investigation. I don't know what's next for me and Ian, but we'll work that out together. But now you know why you don't get brain chips: you never know how you'll end up.
