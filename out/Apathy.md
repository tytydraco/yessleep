I’m coming here, to this Subreddit, because I feel like I’ve run out of all other options. I can’t tell if I’m going crazy over this situation or if everyone else is, and at this point I’m desperate. To explain:

About a month ago I went to visit my younger brother Louis. I hadn’t heard from him for a while which was very unlike him as he contacted me at least once a week, and it had been almost two months. He had always had difficulty connecting with other people, but never to the point of hermit-hood, especially not with me, and I was already concerned. Double that with a call from his work saying he hadn’t come in for a while, and I was on my way to his apartment.

Upon arriving and making my way up the stairs and to his door, I immediately knew something was off. There was a smell coming from the general area of his apartment door. A putrid, rotten stench that was both sweet and slightly metallic. I knocked on the door a few different times trying all sorts of methods to persuade him to answer. He didn’t. I tried the handle. It was open.

Upon opening the door I immediately regretted it. The smell from before now impacted me like a nuke and I immediately ran over to a trashcan in the hall to puke. It was awful. After recovering myself I peered inside the apartment and called out a couple times. Nothing. The lights were off and it was dark so I couldn’t really see either. I braced myself, stepped in and turned on the lights. Once again I was hit with regret.

I struggle to even write this, reliving that initial moment of shock isn’t exactly great, imagining what might have happened to my brother is worse, but I need answers. It was blood. In the middle of the living room sat his couch and a coffee table. The middle seat of the couch and areas around it had been torn up and soaked with blood. At first I staggered, physically and mentally. It took me forever to regain my composure and call the police. They said they were on their way and to stay on the call but I just hung up. As long as they would be there, I didn’t care. I debated with myself. Hesitantly I walked back into the apartment and over to the couch.

Looking at it all closer I noticed something more that made things infinitely worse. Around the edges of where the couch was torn out in the middle, there were pieces of skin melded on. Not sitting on the couch, not lying around the couch, but melded directly into it. Upon realizing what I was looking at, I immediately averted my eyes the other direction and was both startled and disconcerted at the next thing I saw. Scratched onto the wall across the couch were the words:

“Don’t be bothered”

I became upset and angry. My brother was a good person, he didn't deserve whatever happened here. I decided to search the rest of the apartment. My brother didn’t own much. Most of what he had were things our dad or I had given him. Books, video games and a couple consoles from his past birthdays and christmas’ were all set up in his bedroom. All the kitchen supplies we got for him when he moved into his apartment. Pictures of us as kids on his fridge. An urn with some of our fathers ashes. He never asked for a lot but our family always tried our best to give him as much as possible. (I probably shouldn’t be talking about him in past tense. There’s no body, which means there’s no guarantee he’s dead.) Regardless I didn’t find anything out of the ordinary outside of the scene in the living room. So I walked back in there and waited for the cops to arrive. Before they did however I noticed one last thing that didn’t strike me as odd at first, but definitely seemed out of place. A notebook sitting neatly on the blood stained coffee table. Written inside was the following:

“My name is Louis Xander. I am 22 years old, and I live in an island town called Green Fog, off the coast of Washington. I’m a college student here, a part timer at the local grocery store, and nobody outside of that really. And when I say that, I mean it: I am a *nobody*. And because of that, I’ve made a decision. I’m going to sit here and write this all down until I become somebody.

Until I care about something.

I’ve never cared about anything before. Not my school, not my job, nothing. I only really do those things because it seemed easier to go along with doing them than not. But I don’t have “passion”. It’s a concept that has seemed foreign to me ever since I was a kid. Growing up I would see all the other kids talk about their dreams, talk about their hobbies, talk about important people and events. But I never understood what the point of any of that was, I never really “got it”. And I’m sick of not getting it. I want to understand now. And maybe, just maybe, if I sit here long enough to think it through it’ll happen.

So let’s see… the last time I can remember ever coming close to truly caring about something was probably when my girlfriend and I broke up. To be honest I don’t even know how I managed to get a girlfriend in the first place, but she took a liking to me and I didn’t see any reason to refuse her advances. Oh right, her name. What was it? Ellie? Elizabeth? Right, right her name was Elizabeth but I called her Ellie because she had asked me to. She said she thought it would be cuter if I did that, so I had obliged. She was very cute, I’ll admit. This was about a year ago at this point and I haven’t talked to her, or really thought about it since though. We had dated for only about half a year and she broke up with me because, according to her, I was too “distant”. Now that I think about it, during our time dating I don’t think I was ever the one to engage her first in anything. All the dates and little things were usually planned by her, I mainly just went along with them. All the typical things of dinners, movies, a camping trip with her friends, right down to me calling her “Ellie” and the gifts I would get her. I think only once had I ever gone out of my way to do something for her without it first being a direct request. About a month or so into our relationship I heard about a museum showing horror movie props in Seattle. Most of the movies she had taken me to see were horror movies and so I thought it might be a good fit. She had a great time. I didn’t see the appeal. When we broke up I remember we were sitting in my apartment and

Sorry I thought I heard a noise just now.

Anyways, where was I? Right, in my apartment. I was sitting on the couch and she had pulled a stool from the kitchen into the living area so that she could sit across from me. She went over her concerns with me, about how I wasn’t pulling my weight in the relationship, how I was distant, etc. and I listened. I didn’t argue and when she said the inevitable I had simply sighed and replied “Okay.” She shook her head, said that “there was something seriously wrong with me.” and then left. At the time I didn’t really understand what she was talking about. I had gone through with the things she had said she wanted, and I didn’t see the problem with that. Sitting here now writing this all down however, I think this is helping. I think I finally know what she meant. Looking back, maybe if only I had at least tried a little bit more to do things like that museum trip, to show at least somewhat more of an interest in her interests, and to take on more responsibility, maybe th

Oh. Um, goodmorning. I must have fallen asleep while writing. Unfortunately, I can’t seem to remember what I was going to say. I’m tempted to read back through and try to figure it out but it seems like too much effort for something that was likely unimportant anyways. Probably best I move on. I’m starting to get hungry too, but seeing as I still haven’t figured anything out yet, I don’t feel like getting up. And anyways, sleeping has made me feel too comfortable in my current position right now to bother changing anything.

So let’s see, what was the last thing I might’ve come close to caring about? Probably… probably when my dad died. The two people I think I’d be considered closest to would likely be my older brother and my dad, and the latter died to suicide about three years ago. My brother told me later that our dad had struggled with depression for pretty much as long as I had been around. Our mom had died only a few months after I was born, though I was never told how, and he said that ever since then our fathers mental health had been a little rocky, a little paranoid. I guess I never really noticed.

My memories of growing up with my dad were the best. He tried really hard as a single parent to make sure

To make sure

Sorry I feel strange. It’s taking me forever to get even a single sentence on the page. How long, five minutes? Ten minutes? What time is it anyways? The only clocks in the apartment are all behind me right now, but it seems dark outside. I suppose I’m too lazy to get up and actually check. 

Anyways, like I was saying, our dad tried really hard to make sure we grew up well. Toys, fun trips, decent food, all the things a kid could want. But not just that, it was the little things too. The way his face always seemed so gentle even when he was mad, how he listened to and encouraged us, the fact he was always on time to everything for us and made sure we were safe. He spoiled us as best he could, me especially. My brother said he didn’t mind the bias, and that he understood why it existed. Putting all the pieces together now I think I understand as well. Not just the bias, but dads death. I was the last thing our mom left behind before she died. But I had grown up. I moved out and went to college, and for almost a year I hadn’t really seen him. I remember he would call, and usually by the end would sort of jokingly ask me when I was going to stop by and visit or invite him up to “show him around”, but I never did. For the first time we were truly apart from one another, and I couldn’t even be bothered to try and close the gap. But I should have. I sho

Ugh, I think I dozed off again. Again right? I think I did before, no I definitely did, though if that’s true I’m not sure how many times. I’m starting to feel like I’m sinking into my couch from being here for so long. I’m starving. Can’t really remember what I was saying, but I see that I’ve written quite a bit. Most of it is probably nonsensical rambling. Doubtful I would understand it even if I tried reading it back through, huh? To be honest I don’t even really know why I’m still writing this. I guess I just can’t be bothered to stop at this point. What day is it?

Hmm, okay, a good place to start properly would probably be the last time… the last time I can remember coming close to caring about something. It would probably be… yeah, yeah, it would probably be in middle school, when my brother punched a bully for me. I used to be pretty big when I was a kid, and not in a healthy way. What was the kid's name? Ran… Randy? No… Roger? Eh, who cares.

“Roger” used to make fun of me for my size. I didn’t mind it so much to be honest, but one day my brother overheard him at lunch. My brother was in highschool but we were in a small school district, so middle school and highschool took place in the same building. Anyways, he ended up walking over and decking “Roger” in the face, before picking him up, hauling him over to a trash can, and dumping him into it. My brother made some quippy comment much more clever than anything “Roger” ever said about me but I can’t remember what it was, and I’m too tired to try. He got suspended for a week because of it. It wasn’t necessarily that I was grateful for his actions, I thought they were pretty stupid on his part, and like I said “Roger’s” comments never really did bother me. But it was the fact that my brother had cared enough about me to do it regardless, it was the emotion he had behind it. It made me want to do the same for him. It makes me feel as if… as if I actually care about him.

I think I

I fell asleep. Oh well. My skin feels so strange. I can’t tell where my back and legs end and the couch begins haha. Doubt I could get up even if I tried. Might peel my skin off. My whole apartment could catch on fire and I wouldn’t be able to go anywhere. I’m so hungry. Oh well. Why am I writing again? Ah, it doesn’t really matter.

Oh. That’s odd. I think there’s a hand on my shoulder. There is. It’s kind of pale. I hear footsteps now. Hmm. There’s a person in front of me. They’re very skinny. They’re very tall. There’s something wrong about this but I’m not sure what it is. I’m not up to trying to figure it out. Its face looks so familiar. Long hair. It's closer now, leaning over, biting my shoulder. Hard. It’s making strange sounds. Like joyful whimpers. I should probably scream. Who would care anyway? I can’t be bothered.”

Since my arrival at the apartment, the police have done an investigation but no conclusions were reached. I’ve pestered them to get Feds involved, but at this point they seem like they just don’t even care about the situation in general anymore, and are getting fed up with me. They keep saying that with the amount of blood at the scene, he’s probably dead. I don’t care what they think. I’ve put up missing posters, asked around myself if anyone had seen or heard anything, to no avail, and now I’ve come here. I don’t know what to make of any of what I have seen. I don’t know what to make of what was in the notebook. If anyone has any ideas, please help me.
