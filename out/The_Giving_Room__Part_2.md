A light came on as soon as the words left my mouth. One single bulb in the very center of the room shone brightly, illuminating nearly the entire space. The room itself was plain, with dark brown wooden walls and floors, almost like a construction site before drywall and carpet were installed.

“What the hell?” I said, my voice echoing slightly. “This is definitely strange.”

I took two steps further inside, and just as I did, a gust of wind from the alley slammed the door shut behind me. A chill ran across my entire body—not just from the cold. I really needed a new coat, but decent ones cost too much. As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I heard a soft shuffle behind me.

Turning around, I saw a coat neatly folded on the ground. It was clean, thick, and completely free of holes.

I bent down to pick it up. Holding it up to the light, I realized it was dark brown—my preferred jacket color. Pulling off my old jacket, I let it drop to the floor and slipped the new one on. It fit perfectly, as if it had been tailored just for me.

Now enveloped in warmth, I bent over to grab my old jacket, only to find that it had disappeared.

“I guess I didn’t really need that one anymore,” I muttered with a laugh, though I began to feel a bit nervous.

Who—or what—was behind this? Could someone hear my thoughts and grant my desires? A thousand questions raced through my mind, each more unsettling than the last. Despite my growing apprehension, curiosity gnawed at me. There was one thing I felt compelled to try.

“So... can I get some money for groceries?” I said aloud, my voice hesitant.

Nothing happened.

I tried again. “Can I have groceries?”

This time, between blinks, a pile of groceries appeared on the floor in front of me. Two loaves of bread, a carton of eggs, two kinds of deli meat, cheese slices, mayo, a gallon of milk, crackers, and even my favorite cereal.

I stared in shock. Slowly, I reached into my pocket and pulled out the soggy grocery list I’d written earlier. Everything on the list was there, down to the exact brand and quantity.

I dropped the list and cautiously picked up a slice of ham from the deli bag and decided to give it a try. It tasted fresh and delicious. I ate two more slices before realizing I needed to leave. The gifts were incredible, but the knot of unease in my stomach was tightening.

As I tried to gather the groceries, I realized I had no way to carry them all. Before the thought had even finished forming, I looked to my right and saw two plain blue tote bags lying next to the pile.

“Okay,” I said, stuffing the bags with food and grabbing the gallon of milk. “I need to get these home... and I still need to get my keys from the landlord.”

At that moment, the unmistakable jingle of keys hitting the floor echoed behind me. Turning around, I saw my keys lying near the door.

I set the milk down and approached them cautiously. They looked identical to my old set—my apartment key, car key, and even the bottle cap keychain. Everything was there, except the bottle cap was still bent and damaged. The rest of the keys looked brand new, as though they’d just been cut at the hardware store.

I shrugged, hoping they’d work, and slipped them into my new jacket pocket. Grabbing the milk again, I turned the doorknob and stepped out into the alley.

As I walked home, my mind raced with questions. Was this food even safe? Where had it come from? What else could that room do? Despite my concerns, I couldn’t deny the comfort of my new coat and the relief of carrying home fresh groceries.

When I reached my apartment, the new key slid perfectly into the lock. I stepped inside, set the groceries down, and locked the door behind me. After putting everything away, I sat on my couch, determined not to dwell on the room any further.

That resolve lasted about thirty minutes. My thoughts churned with possibilities. The room couldn’t give me money, but it could provide food, clothes, and other items I needed. Still, one question nagged at me: why hadn’t it fixed the bottle cap? Maybe sentimental or one-of-a-kind items were beyond its abilities.

Over the next few days, I returned to the alley repeatedly, hoping to find the door again. It wasn’t there. Once, I sat across from the blank brick wall for six hours, waiting for something to happen. On the fifth day, I gave it one last try, standing in the cold morning air and pleading silently for the door to reappear. Nothing.

Defeated, I went home and accepted that maybe, for once, life had given me a rare gift.

A week and a half later, desperation clawed at me. My groceries were almost gone—just four slices of bread, two slices of cheese, and some cereal left. Rent was due in two weeks, and every job application I’d submitted had been rejected. I sat on my couch, head in my hands, fighting the urge to give up entirely.

With a heavy sigh, I lifted my head.

That’s when I saw it.

Across the room, on the empty wall, the door was there.
