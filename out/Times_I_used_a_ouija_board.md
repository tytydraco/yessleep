Back in high school I had some friends who were wiccan. They told me some stories about them using a ouija board and I was intrigued so after a couple times using it and being mildly entertained a very interesting experience happened. Up to this point the times I used it could be chalked up to the ideomotor action. But this time my wiccan friend and I were in the back seat of another one of our friend's car with her in the driver and another friend in the passenger while we played in the back seat.

 She asked it the usual questions "is there anyone there?" "Whats your name?" "how are you speaking to us right now?" But then I wanted to ask a question, I asked "can you prove you're real?" The board responded with "how" I asked "can you manipulate something in the real world besides just the planchette" then the board kept repeating itself saying "brightside" over and over and over again that's all it would say "brightside brightside brightside" the girl and I were very confused.

 I kept looking out the car window looking at different lights looking to see if any were flickering or just acting odd, after about 20 minutes of the board repeating itself and us two looking around for whatever it was talking about the girl in the driver's seat spoke up and said to look at her air freshener hanging from her review mirror, when I looked up at it, it was spinning very intensely almost to the point it had no more room to spin then it would go the other way and again it was twisting itself almost all the way before going back again, I have no idea how long it had been doing so but it was interesting to say the least, what made it even more interesting was that on the air freshener it had the phrase "look on the brightside" after realizing what was going on we quickly said goodbye and we went our separate ways.

 I continued to play the game with her younger brother, nothing that convincing ever happened again and eventually every time him and I would play after asking for their name the board would only respond with "zozo" and while interesting at first because that is apparently the name of a demon associated with ouija boards it got pretty stale and I stopped playing completely. Still the brightside incident remains the only time that I've ever been completely convinced that the board wasn't fake and something more supernatural had happened. 

Plus I've had a couple of other experiences happen to me that I can't explain that made me want to completely stop associating myself with the board because of how scary it had gotten and they almost made me feel crazy when I would tell others about them, if this gets some views and you're interested in hearing about those lmk, I only have two other experiences I can vividly remember at the moment one time involving the most terrifying sound I've ever heard and another when I was laying in bed watching youtube, lmk which one you'd like to hear about and I might decide to share those experiences with you too but right now I need to go to bed for work and just thought I'd get this memory down before it vanishes in my mind forever, thank you for reading.
