Ever see the old drawings depicting giant sea monsters? Always assuming nobody knew of the deep sea creatures of freakish size? Most think it's because glasses weren't invented yet, or people had vivid imaginations. No, none of that is right. It's because nobody lives to tell the tale.

It was a typical boring night on Orion. You'd think being on a titanic cargo ship would be fun. But it gets monotonous after a while. I was sitting around on the deck of the ship, watching the stars. A light sprinkle of rain gave that familiar smell.
"Hey Jim, You ever wonder what happened to those missing boats in the Bermuda triangle?" Will walked up to me, waiting for my answer.


"I dunno man, why do you ask?"
"Well in about 30 minutes we're gonna be in it and I need to see if I gotta say goodbye to my family, Haha." He chuckled to himself at the last part. Classic Will, always making jokes that never make anyone laugh but himself.


I stood up and was about to say my answer when out of nowhere, lightning lights up the sky.
"Uhhh, Jim... We weren't expecting a storm were we?"
He usually knew this kind of stuff, he always talked with the crew, I kept to myself. Unless it was him of course.
"I thought you knew this kind of stuff?"
The storm rapidly worsened to the point where in the 15 seconds it took to get inside, we were dripping wet.


I looked through the window, and my heart dropped.
The ship, in seconds dipped into the water and a rogue wave hammered into the front.
Orion was one of the biggest cargo haulers on the seas, it would take at least 2 more of those to bring the ship down, but that didnt change the fact that the windows were obliterated and a wall of water threw everybody in the room around. I got up, I had only minor injuries. Will wasnt as lucky.


"Jim, I dont think I can get up.." his voice trailed off at the end, as if he was struggling to keep awake. A piece of glass had put a massive gash in his head, about 2 inches long. Blood poured down his face. I helped him up and put him in a seat.
"Fuck... you alright?" I said in a panic.
He didnt respond, he was out cold.


Andrew, another crew member who was also unscathed piped up.
"I'll get bandages, you gotta watch him." He jogged out of the cabin and out into the cargo hold. 
The weather showed no sign of letting up. The boat was thrashing around in the waves.
I saw a massive splash of water, going hundreds of feet into the air. It was about a quarter mile away. The water was disturbed, resembling the trail of a small boat on a lake. It was moving. Fast.
"What the hell is that?" I mumbled to myself.


Will woke up.
"What? What's going on?" I point towards the oddity.
"Did you hit your head man? Theres nothing there"
I look back, Nothing.
I saw andrew coming back with the bandages.
"Jesus, finally" Will says in relief
The entire ship started listing to the right.
Within 10 seconds the boat was at a 40 degree angle
In the dark, I make out tentacles latching the the boat and pulling with incredible force
Each tentacle was about as thick as one of those giant sequioa trees. The 2 of us huddled up in a panic

"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT"
I call out, horrified by the sight in front of me
It all happened so fast. Metal screeched. The back of the ship was torn off cargo raining down into the ocean as the ship turns at nearly a 90 degree angle. I watch in horror as I realize the ship in hundreds of feet in the air


We all fall onto the wall which has now become the floor. A door fell off and we get a perfect look into the creatures maw.
Thousands of yellow eyes. Millions of giant, red spikes in a pit the size of a diamond mine.
Everybody is so petrified nobody can make a sound, we all sit in silence, in terror. It seems all crew members except us had falled on the boat. Then I remembered, Andrew.


He hung off the edge of the ship, a barrel hit him in the head and he lost his grip. As he landed in the mouth his body was ripped to shreds and fell into the pitch black pit. 


"JIM, WE GOTTA GET OFF THE BOAT"
The tentacles loosened their grip on  the ship as it started to plummet into ints jaws.
We grabbed each others arms, climbed to the other side of the boat and jumped.
Many lifeboats had detached from the boat when it was pulled apart. Will landed in the water next to me. And we swam for the lifeboat.


It didnt take long for us to watch it pull past us at incredible speeds into the creatures mouth. The mass amounts of water pouring into the pit had make a vortex. Before I knew it. I was surrounded by darkness.


Something sharp grazed my back. I stopped falling abruptly. I heard wills screams get farther and farther away. I pulled out my flashlight to see everything around me.
I saw will, in a pit of stomach acids, burning to a crisp. He already was missing all of his skin. I watched as he was reduced to nothing. Not even bones. I looked around me to see what saved me.

 My jacket was caught on a tooth. It the process however. My back was badly cut. I looked up and saw the entire boat plummet into the hole past me. The force of the wind must have ripped my jacket because I fell with it. I fell for atleast 3 seconds. I landed on my legs and I was crippled. I sat in agony on the wreckage of the ship. It was rapidly being eaten away.


That brings you to where I am now. My phone is on 2% as I type this. Little is left of the boat and I already have severe burns.
My name is James Callahan. This is the truth.The Orion was not lost at sea. Dont listen to what they tell you.

 Sea monsters are real.
