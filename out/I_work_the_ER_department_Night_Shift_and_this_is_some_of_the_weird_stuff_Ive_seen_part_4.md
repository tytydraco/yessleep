Hi, reddit. It’s been 4 years. 

There’s a lot of explaining I need to do. I’m sure you’re all wondering where I’ve been, what’s been happening, etc. I apologise for not updating you all, but I simply couldn’t.

I was actually ready to leave my job. Something horrible happened, which I’ll explain in a moment, and I just decided to stop playing detective and go find a job as a barista instead. Leave and have a fresh start, and forget I’d ever written about this stuff to begin with. Completely erase it from my memory - act like it never happened. But I couldn’t. I wasn’t allowed to.

It was only a few weeks after my last post when I saw one of them again. A young man, around my age. I didn’t realise he was one of them at first. He walked in normally, well, as normally as someone with a gushing head wound would have. He was clutching a motorcycle glove to his head as blood blinded his left eye, and he held his helmet in his free arm. I quickly rushed over to him, ushering for one of the other nurses to grab a wheelchair. He spoke fine, albeit a shaken quality to his voice, and told me how his motorcycle had hit a bump in the road, and he’d fallen and hit his head. I asked him his name, and he’d said it was Adam. I know I previously didn’t give away patient information, but I don’t think I can really class him as a ‘patient.’

He’d asked for some water, and I obliged, filling up a paper cup as he sat down in the wheelchair, the other nurse walking off to grab some paperwork. I handed him his cup, and as I reached into my pocket to grab my pager, he grabbed my chest. 

I’m a man, so there wasn’t even anything to grab, but somehow he’d sunk his nails into my left pec just enough to pull me forward. I opened my mouth to yell out in pain, but he shoved his glove into my mouth, and forced me to look into his eyes. They were no longer blue, but entirely black; pupils dilated to an uncanny degree. And in a rasping, pluralised voice, he said, “Don’t go looking for things you don’t want to know the answer to.”

I just stared at him, aghast. His voice had turned to a myriad of many, all fighting to be heard the most; be the loudest. There was a malicious frown on his face, but the way his brows were furrowed, it appeared more like a stern warning, than anything truly wishing to harm me any more than they had done already. Like he’d tried to mimic a disappointed parent, but didn’t quite know how to put his features right. Rage and concern and confusion and disdain merging into one uncanny myriad of a emotions, and so I continued to stare, until the gravity of the situation took hold.

I yelled out for help. Luckily, it was an extremely slow night, so he, the other nurse, and I were the only ones in the lobby. He pulled his nails out from my chest, and stood up, looming over me. He was suddenly a lot taller than I had registered as he walked in prior, and he walked out towards the sliding front doors. He stopped, turned back to look at me and the other nurse who was fretting over the puncture wounds that were leaking out onto my scrubs, and suddenly launched his helmet at almost superhuman speed at the lobby’s check in desk, smashing the glass and slamming the computer with it on the floor. The other nurse screamed in fear, and all I could do was watch, in horror, as he stared me in the eyes, walking off into the night. 

That was enough for me to decide to hand in my resignation letter the next day. I had seen, first hand, the sheer power those things had. If he had decided to launch my head into the glass instead of his helmet, I would’ve been reduced to mush. There was no amount of curiosity that needed to be scratched that could come above my desire to live a decent life. So, I had decided my super cool, super interesting monster hunting adventure (/s) was over. 

But I wasn’t allowed to leave. When I handed my resignation letter in the next day to the head doctor, he led me into his office. He’d told me that he needed to make some calls, to discuss the termination process, and I obliged. Then, he locked me in his office.

I began to freak out, trying to use my pager to get (A), or (B) to respond and get me. No one came. Then, a group of people dressed in hospital gear, suits, and smart clothing returned. I couldn’t recognise anyone, not even those dressed in scrubs. They all looked at me, stoic and unmoving, until a short, plump woman came forwards, smiling perkily. 

She was older than me, but not too old. Around 50, if my memory serves correct. She had tightly curled, blonde hair, and had she not been smiling, I’d imagine that heavy, purpled bags under her eyes would be present, despite the heavy makeup she wore. She took a seat in front of me, ever smiling, and placed both elbows on the desk, her hands interlinked under her chin.

“Hey, u/MouseCurtains, is it?” (Sorry if it seems disjointed, I don’t want to give away my personal data, especially not now.) “My name is (X). You seem rather unnerved, I assure you there’s nothing to worry about.” 

I don’t think I replied. I seem to just remember looking at everyone but her, and how they all stared, unmoving, back at me. 

“I hear that you’re asking to resign.” She smiled, trying her best to come across as warm hearted, but the thumping silence in the room made it futile. She sighed, before waving her hand behind her, and the others in the room left, albeit hesitantly. I could still see them peering through the glass even after they’d departed. “I’m afraid you can’t.” 

I asked what she meant. Surely, no one can be forced to keep a job. I was wrong. She pulled a leather briefcase up onto the table from beside her, clicking it open gently, as if any loud noise would send me trembling like a lamb. She must’ve been more prepared for my response than I was. And more understanding of my reaction too. As if she’d done this many times before. She gingerly pulled out a brown file, and handed it to me, saying absolutely nothing. I’d opened it, and immediately shut it again. 

It was a forged mental health assessment, with a referral letter to a psychiatric institution. 

I looked on in horror back at her, my mouth agape, in absolute disbelief at what I was seeing. She continued to smile, a forced sympathy plastered on her face. I began to question why, and then fought to promise how I’d keep my mouth quiet, be silent forever. She shook her head.

“If you were in our position, you’d do the same. It’s imperative that we keep everything that’s been happening here under wraps.” She dropped her faux sympathies for a more direct approach, looking me sternly in the eyes. “We’ve been made aware of some posts online.”

I felt my hands sweat, but I’d always been good at lying. Growing up with strict parents helped with that. Don’t overreact, that gives it away. Don’t try to act too nonchalant. So instead, I just continued to be as bewildered by the situation as before, which wasn’t entire difficult, after being threatened with what basically was psychiatric imprisonment. She seemed to make the assumption that I was not the one posting online, as that smile glossed her lips once more.

“The hospital will implement more procedures to make sure you feel safe here. But we cannot allow you to leave work. We cannot discuss anything more with you on the matter, but we truly hope you give us your full cooperation. Are we in agreement on the matter?” She asked, a plump finger idly tapping on the file before me. A subtle reminder of what would happen if I withdrew compliance. So I complied.

That’s why I haven’t updated in so long. I didn’t want to stay there; to keep having to experience what those things were, especially after I’d seen the sheer power they were capable of. But, nonetheless, I couldn’t help but write some of my experiences, and my coworkers’, in my diary, which I kept tucked under my mattress in my room. 

I think I should mention that I wasn’t the only one who faced a similar ordeal with (X) and those people. I’d whispered to (A) over coffee if she’d been visited, by ‘family.’ She seemed to gauge what I had meant, and nodded, slowly. She’d lost sleep over it too. (B) was the same, and had grown ever more gaunt each day that passed. (C) had left the hospital - apparently her mother had grown ill and needed care. I doubt the validity of that very much, because I haven’t been in contact with her since. Her number was out of service from the moment I’d heard the news.

I suppose morbid curiosity must be clawing at you all by now, so I’ll satisfy you. During the Covid Pandemic, things were pretty slow, concerning the ‘things.’ The emergency room during the day, and most evenings, were filled with those who desperately needed ventilators, and so we didn’t face anything but the horrors of real life illness, and the fear of catching the disease ourselves. Stress and anxiety were at the forefront of our mind, and exhaustion racked our bodies. But the most harrowing part of the whole pandemic, was that whenever ‘they’ came in, we couldn’t even be bothered to react. They’d only come in when the ER was empty, and we were waiting for new Covid patients to attend to. 

To see them trying their hardest to disturb us was almost comical, after seeing so many of our staff and patients be lost to the virus. We all so desperately tired of seeing people die from Covid that, if one of ‘them’ came in, jerking their body parts around, and feigning pain from unnatural accidents, we simply watched them, waiting for them to leave. Sometimes they’d make a big spiel, screaming and smashing things in an inhumane manner. Sometimes they’d just walk out and leave. And as the pandemic persisted, their appearances diminished more and more. Nothing at that time could’ve disturbed me more than seeing our beloved janitor, (G), succumb to the illness, unable to be surrounded by any family or friends, as (B) had to speak Spanish on FaceTime to explain to his family that we were taking him off life support, and to say their prayers and goodbyes. It was the hardest time I’d ever experienced as a nurse. But the strangest thing was I was almost thankful to those monsters, for at least allowing us to grieve in peace.

Once the Lockdown was lifted, and things began to gain normalcy again, they came back. I hadn’t been there for the first sighting, around October, 2021. A nurse I hadn’t met before, (F), who had joined the hospital as a junior nurse straight out of college to help with the pandemic, was working alongside (A). A teenaged boy had walked into the ER, speaking what (A) recognised as Korean. He kept pointing outside, crying in desperation, grabbing at their wrists to pull them outside. He was hysterical, and (F) immediately rushed forward to help follow him outside. But (A) held (F) back, skeptical of the sight before them. (F) wasn’t aware of the things, having joined the hospital when their appearances were near to none. The boy was crying, falling to his knees in a truly dramatic display. 

(F) is a compassionate person, but she has far less naïveté now than she did then. (A) pulled out her phone, which we were now allowed to keep on the late night ER shifts, and used a voice translator to translate what the boy was saying. She could’ve translated it to her herself, but she didn’t want to anger the boy. I won’t go into details because it was pretty horrific, from what I’d heard, but to put it bluntly, the boy repeatedly shouted misogynistic slurs, and said that he’d “kill all of her children.” 

When (F) read it, she sobbed. Once they’d looked back up, the boy just grinned at them, proudly. He did a bow, as if thanking them for watching his performance, and walked out of the sliding front doors. (A) had whispered to me on a smoke break that apparently, (F) had grown up with an abusive stepfather for a few years, who would berate her mother when he drank. I suppose reading what the boy had said must’ve triggered something in her. 

My next experience came soon after. I was alone at the front desk, filling out some admin work on the computer. (B) was in the bathroom. I didn’t hear the doors slide open or anything, but a slow tapping at the glass between me and the waiting room alerted me to its presence. I looked forward, until I noticed a small face peering at me from just above the desk. A child. I checked the time, and the fact the waiting room was empty, and realised. One of those things. 

It was a small, bald child. I had no way of determining it’s gender, but that was the least of my concern. It had a very large cyst on the top of it’s head. It stared up at me, expectantly, as if waiting for me to coo over it. I knew what it was, so, for the first time in my life, I ignored a patient, opting to sip my coffee and carry on with my work. It clearly didn’t like that, as it began to slap small hands against the glass, greasy marks left behind in their wake. I did keep peering at it through my peripheral, but it’s crumpled, angry face made me snicker. It was like an angry little goblin, and my beyond exhausted state just couldn’t take it seriously. That was a bad mistake. 

It screeched, and dropped to the ground, writhing in agony. I stilled. I couldn’t see it over the desk anymore, and I was stuck between checking to look at it, or continuing to avert all of my focus to the computer. After a few minutes of silence, a large, meaty hand slapped the glass, wiping pus and blood all over the screen. I jumped, and decided I had to look. What remained of the small child was a crumpled mess of skin and flesh, one eye popping out from its socket from the pressure of pushing a large, muscular arm from its scalp, right where the cyst had once been. The child’s tongue lolled out of its mouth, and the remaining eye clouded over, as the large hand continued to slap against the glass. It was horrifying, and I began to gag, unfurling the contents of my stomach into the paper bin beside me. The slapping stopped, and I looked up, to see… nothing.

A slow, wet, smacking sound bounced around the room, and I shakily looked up, over my desk, to see the hand pulling itself out of the ER, dragging the crumpled body of the child out behind it, still attached to the bursted flesh atop the child’s head. When (B) came back from the bathroom, and with more coffee, he didn’t bother to ask me what had happened, just picked up the mop and bucket, and cleaned up. 

(B) never asked me about it afterwards; clearly my green face had told him enough. In late 2022, I returned the favor, but instead, he told me about his experience. I had gone out for a smoke break (the smoking area around the building, not near the ER entrance, for patient reasons), and was leisurely scrolling through twitter, headphones in. There was another nurse, (H), on staff, so I didn’t feel bad leaving him alone. When I walked back into the ER waiting room, I saw (H) consoling (B), as he sobbed into a red towel. 

I purchased an audio recording device off amazon, as I was too scared to use my phone anymore. I’ve transcribed what he told me:

“It’s not fair! Why do they do this to us, huh?” 

He sobs.

“Tamika was my friend, why do they have to remind me of her?”

I asked him what he meant. I told him I didn’t think it was good to record him in this state.

“No, record me! I’m sick of having to pretend that we aren’t being targeted by them!” 

He steadies his breathing. (H) passes him a glass of water, which he downs.

“She came in. A woman in her 20s. She looked similar to Tamika, but I knew it wasn’t her. Just someone who reminded me of her. I checked the time and I knew what was going to happen, I knew and I felt… prepared. I wasn’t. She didn’t complain or say she felt unwell. I did what I do, you know? I smiled and asked her what was wrong, what her name was… They never react too badly to me, especially when I’m nice. She said nothing, just shaking her head at me. As if I’d done something wrong. She handed me this-“

He shakes the towel, before crying again. I tell him we can stop, once more, but he wants to continue. He’s crying, but he’s more angry than upset.

“Tamika had cancer. A nursing student with cancer; what irony.” He scoffs, bitterly. “When she got too ill, she had to drop out, and go home. I went to visit her when she was in hospice care. She had this red towel, and she asked me to wipe the sweat from her brow, but I couldn’t… I couldn’t because I couldn’t stand how ill this amazing, powerful girl had become. I just cried instead, and she comforted me, when I should’ve been the one to comfort her - and… and I haven’t been able to forgive myself since. I swore I’d graduate and be able to do for others what I couldn’t do for her. But that - that thing! That thing has to give me this, and then leave! Leave without saying anything!”

The recording ends there. I decided not to record anymore. (B) had gone through a very traumatic ordeal, and I’m sure that Tamika forgives him for not being able to wipe her forehead. But there was an added level of horror that those ‘things’ were capable of. They were capable of knowing what makes us feel guilt; a psychological concept that I  hadn’t heard of them capable before. I know that they can revisit trauma, as seen with (C)’s friend, and (F), but never guilt. Those things, those monsters, were trying to break us down as much as possible, more so than I could’ve imagined. It wasn’t just our fears that they knew, but our psyche too. 

(A) became cynical. I actually enjoyed our time on the night shift together, because she genuinely began to stop caring. She’d crack jokes left and right, always making the best out of a bad situation. I suppose I should’ve seen the signs. 

Last year she and I were working together; her behind the desk and the glass, and me on coffee duty, or, as we’d coined it, ‘fodder duty.’ Being behind the glass meant safety, even if those things came close. Only ‘Adam’ had ever come close to bothering to break it, and so anyone not behind the glass had more chance of being targeted. 

An old man came in, his walker barely keeping him upright. He looked around, and saw me, and began to ask for a ‘white man’ instead. He trudged toward (A), asking if she’d kindly ask for a white man to come help him instead. I shrugged my shoulders, and she simply laughed, pointing at the time. 1:02 AM. Pretty early for one of them, but not unheard of. He began to get irate at our dismissal of him, and so, having learnt my lesson from ignoring them, I walked over, telling him that we were the only ones available to take care of him. He frowned and shook his head, saying he’d never let a woman, especially not a Korean, or (racial slur) take care of him. (A) laughed, and turned to me, grinning. 

“Sounds just like my friend’s racist fuck of a grandpa.” 

We chuckled over that, rolling our eyes, but I kept watching the old man. I knew I couldn’t completely lower my guard, but (A)’s comment did tickle me. Where we are, in the middle of nowhere, I’d faced quite a bit of racism, but mainly from the forgotten few who’d never decided to leave the all-white town they’d lived in. Instead, fuelling their closed minds with facebook crap that’s telling them Osama Bin Laden might still be alive, and such other jargon.

(A) stopped laughing rather quickly, when she saw the old man shuffle. I walked over to face him, and saw him grasping the front of his trousers. Extremely inappropriately. His voice was low, rasping, and he spoke harrowing words.

“Hm, I bet your grandpa was always right.” 

He stopped abruptly once (A) looked at him in disgust. He took the hand that was against his trousers, and tapped the screen. It sounded like morse code, but I had no way to translate it. (A) yelled at him to stop it, for him to stop doing what he was doing, and to leave now. The man slowly left, shakily on his walker, before taking one look back, and saying:

“Them Koreans screamed the best, you know. Your grandpa wants you to know that.” 

(A) stared at him, pure fury on her face. And then she crumpled. She didn’t want to speak on it, but I knew. She’d told me before how her grandmother was a comfort woman, and how if she could’ve survived that, (A) could handle this. But (A) couldn’t. And on Blue Monday, this year, she leapt off the rooftop of the hospital to her death. I wasn’t working that day, but from what (H) and (F) told me, she seemed to be at peace before she’d died. She’d packed her favourite meal for lunch, sharing it with as many of her coworkers as she could. Then, she drank a whole bottle of vodka, took off her shoes, and leapt off the building. We were allowed to go to her funeral - take time off. It was sad, to see her smiling face on the portrait of the shrine they’d made. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d seen her face so full of life, like it was in the picture. 

You might be wondering what’s made me decide to come back to reddit, after all this time. Why I’ve decided that the fear of going to a psychiatric ward for the rest of my life is culled by the desire to share my story. Well, I’m currently in the elevator to the morgue, with one of ‘them’. 

Tonight, I was working the night shift. It was just me and (F). She’d asked to pardon herself for a bit, and I obliged. My thrill for life wasn’t so prevailing anymore. They didn’t scare me anymore. And then, (G) walked in. 

In case you’ve forgotten, (G) was our janitor, who’d died of Covid complications during the pandemic. He was a joy to work with, always cracking up jokes and showing us pictures of his grandchildren, who lived out of state. And yet here he was, walking over to me with the same warm smile on his face, a golden canine shining back at me. I teared up, I’m not afraid to admit, and I hugged it. The thing parading as (G). I hugged it, him. And it hugged back. It patted my back, and told me that he knows. I didn’t know what he meant, but the thing grabbed its’ jaw, and broke it’s neck. It winked at me, still the same, warm smile as (G) had, and pointed a finger to the stretcher, and then the elevator. 

I know I sound stupid. I know I sound dumb. But I didn’t feel threatened. So I put him on the stretcher, covered a sheet over his body — sorry, it’s body, and now, I’m writing this, sitting in the morgue, waiting for something to happen. There’s a reason we aren’t supposed to be down here… be with them, but I feel strangely fine. Safe. 

I’ll update you all when I can.
