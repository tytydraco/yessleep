For context I (19f) has been dating this guy (26M) fo about five  months. He is not an outgoing person whatsoever and doesn’t like to talk about his past or family. Every time I try to get info out of him he suddenly closes and changes subject. I’ve never met his mom or sibling and don’t even know if they exist for real.

So, for the past weeks ive been on my guard I don’t know why but I’ve been getting scared of spending alone time with my bf. I’ve never seen his passport or even driver license and he ain’t on any social media. I feel as he might be hiding something. A couple of days ago we got arrested on the road for a broken  headlight. When the police officer asked him his papers he became very nervous and said he didn’t bring his wallet even though he clearly did because we were going to eat . He got a ticket and we went on with our evening. I later asked him why he lied and he just said that he had his reason and closed the discussion right off the bat. 

2 days ago I did some digging because I felt like I was going insane.but I was fucking right . I searched his name on everything and found absolutely no trace.I thought to myself that he might just not be social media guy but as I was searching I stumble across a picture of him with some friend I never heard of. The picture is old it was posted 10 years ago. The problem was that the name he gave me was actually the name of one of the guy on the picture, not his and he also looked a lot older than 16 years old. I was shook. His name was actually Simon, I still don’t know his family name. I was about to dig up the guy’s account but my  bf came back at my appartement and I closed my laptop. I didn’t talk about it with him I was scared . 
For the last two days I’ve been paying extra close attention to what he does. When I ask him what he did today he is always super vague and doesn’t want to talk about it. He doesn’t work or go to school so what the hell is he doing all day. He doesn’t stay at home I know it because I have security cameras in my appartment.

I have noticed that every time he leaves he brings extra clothes with him and he doesn’t  come back with the same clothes that he wore while leaving. 

That’s weird right?

But the worst thing is that yesterday night I woke up in the middle of the night and he wasn’t by my side, he left in the middle of the night why the fuck would he do that. This morning I asked him about it and he ne brushed it off but when I insisted he grabbed  my wrist and told me to stop being a nosy bitch.

But tonight something is even more  off, he told me that he won’t be coming back for a couples of days, he said he was visiting family. I asked why can’t I go with him and finally meet his mom and siblings. He told me that it was better if I don’t and that I wouldn’t want to meet them anw. 
So I’m writing this and I’m asking for some advice whatsoever. 
I dug the others guy’s Social media but I only found out what high school he went to and nothing more .
I’m actually scared, why would he give me a fake name,where does he go and why does he changes clothes every time ?
Am I safe ? Should I change my locks ? 
Idk what to do im lost
