The sky—yes, the sky, or what I thought was sky—peeled. No sound. Just the falling away of silence, like skin sloughing off the world. There was a wound. A living tear. From it bled… not light, no—something deeper. A colorless color, stripped of all meaning, trembling against the edges of what the eye could take.

It shimmered. It moved.

Red that wasn’t red. Blue that hissed. They pulsed not to rhythm, but to pulse.

Then the air forgot how to behave.

Thick, syruping through the lungs. Vision bent into lines. Perspective folded. And it—not it—then—the—no.

No.

There was no thing. There was… was.

It pressed.

No direction. No arrival. Just pulse. A weightless weight that pooled behind the eyes, that seeped down the spine, curled around the nerves like cooling wax. It didn’t speak. It didn’t notice. It existed too hard.

Someone nearby turned inside out. Not physically—no, their shape remained—but they were wrong, inverted, an echo screaming backward. Their mouth spilled laughter like insects. Another chewed their fingers and wept with joy. The ground had no texture. I couldn’t feel my feet.

Something touched my shoulder.

There was no one there.

I smiled at it.

Someone was sobbing. I think it was me.

I think.

The word “I” grows soft.

I remember my wife. Or someone’s wife. She looked at me and said my name, but not my name. It was a sound I once wore. I answered anyway.

We spoke.

No words. Just mouths moving. I understood nothing, and it was perfect.

I begged—for what, I no longer remember. Sound doesn’t mean anymore. Letters fall apart if you look too long. Still, I made noise. I think it came out backward. She—they—smiled.

The sky is open. That hasn’t changed. It pulses now. Breathes. Something inside it moves in spirals—not in motion, but in pattern. The world is softening at the edges.

Tendrils.

They are not tendrils. That’s the only way I can shape them in thought. They move through dreamspace. They thread the holes in meaning. I feel them sliding through things I forgot I had—childhood moments, skin sensations, the shape of guilt. It all unknits.

I convulse now when I am awake. 

But I am dreaming, no?

I watch myself from angles that don’t exist.

But I have been here.

I tasted the hum in my blood.

It tasted like home.

I forgot…

Forgot what?

It speaks to me in mirrors. I can’t hear, but I know. The language is newer than time. It is behind time. Around it.

Something brushes the inside of my eyes.

I remember standing.

I remember standing.

I do not remember stopping.

There is something living in my chest cavity. It is not mine, but it uses my rhythm. My pulse has new chords. It follows a song behind the stars. Not music. Not tone. Just… arrangement. A curvature of awareness that surrounds, seeps, sips.

I’ve stopped being afraid. Not because there’s no fear—but because.

I am soft.

I am porous.

I am beautiful in the way ruin is beautiful.

The sky is open.

It is open.

I am open.
