When I was 15 my friends and I went on a school trip to Paris. We got a chance to explore the catacombs, I wish I hadn’t gone.

As I said we were fifteen at the time, and we got this rare chance of going to Paris for a school trip. 

We would be studying the history of Paris and its catacombs as well. 

My friends and I were really excited because we loved scary, ancient stuff like that.

Our whole class seemed to feel the same as there was a lot of discussion and rumours regarding those catacombs.

One of these rumors was that some ancient creature or entity was lurking in the catacombs.

For the rest of the morning I couldn’t shake those rumors out of my mind. People were saying things like “I’ve heard that the last group who went in only 2 returned” and “I heard there’s more than bones inside”. 

I was a bit terrified to be honest, but I laughed at the things people said like everybody else. 

When we finally arrived at the entrance to the catacombs, the air felt heavy and people didn’t laugh as much. Everyone seemed serious and I could feel the anxious atmosphere. 

“Okay everyone, get in line and don’t start wandering around. Just follow the line through,” our teacher said. 

We formed that line and went in. When I first stepped through that rusty metal door, the air felt colder and heavier than outside. Instantly I felt off, my anxiety started to rise. 

“Hey, do you feel this weirdness?” My friend Tommy whispered to me. 

“Yeah dude, really weird place. Maybe the rumors are true after all,” I answered. 

“No way bro, it’s just our minds playing tricks on us,” Tommy assured me. 

I looked around and I saw skulls and bones just piled up everywhere, torches flickering and giving light. The smell in that place was really musty and old, but what can you expect from a place where there are millions of rotting bones?

“Wow, imagine how many people are dead in here,” Tommy whispered. 

“Yeah, thousands of people and probably all ages too,” I answered. 

I was fascinated by this place. Something about these bones and the mystery about this place got me interested. 

I looked left and I saw a corridor there. For a moment I thought that I wanted to explore that corridor on my own. Then I saw something move there, it made a bone crushing sound. 

“What was that?” I asked Tommy and pointed at the corridor. 

“I don’t fucking know and I really don’t want to either,” He answered. His voice was a bit shaky but he hid it well. 

At that point I was pretty anxious, scared and just wanted to get out of there already. What was exciting at first, changed to fear in seconds. I didn’t know if anyone else had heard this sound or seen something extraordinary. 

We kept going and the tour we had was supposed to last for 2 hours, at that point 15 minutes had passed. 

Suddenly I heard a girl scream from the back of the line. I looked back and didn’t see anything. It was pitch black when I looked, all I could see was Tommy and the guy behind him. 

“What the fuck was that?” I asked Tommy. 

“Some girl screamed, she’s probably just a chicken,” Tommy said. 

The guy in front of me was called Philip, Philip opened his mouth and told us, “this place is fucked, we need to get out of here.”

Then he told us that he read from the internet that there lurked some weird monster. Nobody had seen the monster clearly, but apparently it was made of bones, had sharp nails and was devil-like. 

Philip also told us that he saw a skull that kept following him, he said that the skull had this weird symbol on its forehead. He also said that he heard the bones cracking and some distant whispering. 

I got goosebumps and right then I heard the bones cracking again on my right. I swear I saw something moving in there, but it was so dark that I couldn’t see what. 

At this point 30 minutes of the tour had passed, we stopped at a spot where there was a cross made in the wall. The tour told us about how priests came here to pray and how some priests offered sacrifices. He told us that some of the sacrifices included dead animals, human body parts or jewelry and gold. 

He also told us a story about a priest who went in there to make a sacrifice, in a last attempt to save his dying wife. The sacrifice failed, because the man didn’t sacrifice enough.
The guide ended the story with,  “The priest tried to save his wife with a sacrifice, but ended up staying in the catacombs forever.”

“Thud” 

A loud stomp was heard from behind us. The guide started laughing hysterically. Then I heard that bone crushing sound again and it was coming towards us. 

Then the guide said, “Every now and then a tourist or a tour guide goes missing in here, never thought it would be me”

Our teacher started to yell at the tour guide, “We have to go now. Let’s get the hell out!” 

“It’s useless to escape, the priest knows the catacombs better than me or you and can move much faster than us. This happened to my cousin as well, but he managed to escape by believing in god to save him.” The guide told us calmly. 

The tour guide's calm behaviour was really weird, but at the same time, it kind of calmed me down too. 

Then another thud and some bones falling from the walls.

“Should we move and try to get the fuck out?” I yelled at the guide. 

I didn’t see a point in just accepting that, now we are going to die, I was only 15 and wanted to experience more in life. 

“Yeah, let’s go.” The guide stuttered and started to lead us out of there.

We formed that line again, but now we grouped together. I was with Tommy, Philip and Jasmine. 

“Are you scared?” Jasmine asked. 

“Fuck no, there ain’t nothing in here.” Tommy answered. 

“Don’t try to look tough Tommy, it’s okay to be scared,” I said

“Yeah, I think we all are a lil scared,” Philip added. 

Another loud thud. Some girl screamed in front of the line. 
Soon we reached a spot where there was no light, a narrow passage and on the other side, there was pure darkness. Then the others came through as well. 

“Where the hell is Tommy?” I asked Jasmine and Philip. 

“I thought that he was just behind us, but apparently not.” Philip said and scratched his head. 

Then Tommy came through as well, but soon after, he collapsed to the ground and started coughing. 

“Ugh ugh, get out! Get out now!” Tommy screamed. 

He was coughing up blood and he was croaking. 

The bones crashed and the passage we just went through collapsed. This tour felt like it lasted forever. A never ending nightmare underground. 

“Okay guys, let’s get Tommy up and then get ourselves as far away from here as possible,” Philip said. 

We helped Tommy up and then started walking. We heard the sound of crushing bones, inside the walls and it sounded like it followed us. 

Then we heard bones crushing right beside us. 

Thud

There were bones flying everywhere, Jasmine and Tommy started screaming. Something had broken through a wall. Me and Philip looked at each other and nodded. Both of us understood that now was the time to run. 

“Guys we need to run now!” I yelled at the group.

Before we could start running, I looked at the wall and something bigger than any of us came through. It was crushing bones on the way.  Its head twitching, I saw only a glimpse in the dark cave.

“We need to fucking run!” I screamed, grabbed Jasmine and started sprinting. 

I didn’t see if Tommy and Philip followed us, it was life or death. I heard them running behind me. 

“Tommy! Philip! Follow us!” I screamed in hopes of them following my voice. 

Then I heard the monster running behind us. I kept begging for god to let us survive and get out. 

Then Jasmine slipped and fell. 

“Ouch,” she yelled. 

I went over to help her. 

“Get up, get up. We must continue and we’ll survive,” I assured her. She looked really scared and honestly I was too. 

We continued, took a left and then dived under a table in that room. 

“Shhhhh,” I said to Jasmine. 

We hid under there for sometime. Then I got up, looked around and told Jasmine that we were clear. She got up too and we started to find our way out. 

Everyone from our class was gone, I didn’t know where Tommy and Philip were. It was just us and that thing. 

We walked around, not a word to each other. We just kept quiet in case that thing was lurking around somewhere. 

We arrived at this corridor that had stairs going up. 

“Look, a way out,” I whispered to Jasmine and pointed at those stairs.

“Finally, fuck this place!” Jasmine yelled. 

A big fucking mistake, she thought we were off the hook. Suddenly we heard the bones crushing behind us. The monster was approaching again. 

“Why the fuck did you do that?” I asked Jasmine. 

“I don’t know,” she replied and went full hysterical. 

She started crying, I grabbed her hand and said, 
“We need to go, unless you want to die!” 

We started running up the stairs, I looked back and the monster almost caught us. Jasmine fell again on the stairs, but I had to continue, for both our sake. The door at top of the stairs was rusty, heavy and it took a while to get it open. 

Finally the door opened. I got out and looked behind, Jasmine was reaching for my hand. I grabbed it and started pulling her in. 

Then the monster grabbed her leg. 

“It got me!” She screamed and started wiggling to get herself free. Then my grip loosened and her hand slipped away. Right then, the monster started dragging her back in the catacombs, and that monster mumbled something like, 

“Le sacrifice n’est pas terminé." 
*(The sacrifice is not finished.)


“Jasmine! Fight back, I’ll save you!” I yelled at her and tried to get back in to save her, but the door slammed shut right on my face. 

I heard a soft whisper coming through that door, 

“Toi… tu finiras.”
*(You… will finish it.)*

Next thing I know, I wake up in the hospital. A doctor is checking my condition, I looked to my left and my teacher was there. She looked like she had been through much worse, she was all bloody and covered in mud. 

“I’m glad you’re alive,” she said to me.

“Me too, what the hell happened?” I asked her. 

“You don’t want to know, believe me,” she told me. 

Then I passed out, I still haven’t found out what happened to the rest of our class. I just hope I never have to go back down there to find out.
