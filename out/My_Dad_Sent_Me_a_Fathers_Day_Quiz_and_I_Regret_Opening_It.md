“FATHER’S DAY QUIZ: How well do you know your dad?”

It was the middle of the night. Father’s Day. I got a notification from my dad with a link. He was in his room downstairs, knowing that I had to study for a term exam yet his stupid ass sent me this.

Classic dad. I love him so much.

Ever since mom died, he was my backbone. He worked 2 jobs to pay off my school fees yet he also found time to attend my piano recitals. He even recorded my entire high school production of Beauty And The Beauty because he thought I looked lovely in yellow.

Deciding it wouldn’t hurt too much to spend 5 minutes, I opened my phone. 

“Happy Father’s Day!” I typed, loading it with some emojis.

“Thanks. Did you see the quiz?” he replied.

I clicked on the link. It took me to some zany HTML website that looked like it was designed by some college student on pot. It was one of those “make-your-own” quizzes where you can set your own questions. I remember doing this with my friends when I was in 4th grade. 

**“INSTRUCTIONS: CHOOSE WHAT YOU THINK IS THE CORRECT ANSWER! LET’S SEE HOW MUCH YOU KNOW YOUR DAD. REMEMBER, BE HONEST!”**

**“1. Is your dad afraid of blood?”**

There was a panel from which you can select one of three options: “Yes”, “No” or “Maybe”.

The question was simple. Ever since mom’s horrifying accident, Dad freaked out at even the smallest of scratches I get. I chose “Yes”.

**“GREAT, THAT’S THE CORRECT ANSWER!”**

**“2. Is your dad currently naked?”**

I hated this about him, but he had a habit of sleeping in his undies. And sometimes, fully nude.

Smart question, dad. But I’m smarter. “Yes”.

**“GREAT, THAT’S THE CORRECT ANSWER!”**

**“3. Has your dad ever broken his femur?”**

Obviously not. “No”.

**“OOPS! THAT’S THE WRONG ANSWER.”**

What? That sucked. I was aiming for a perfect score.

I hoped he probably set the wrong answer while he was making the quiz. He was, after all, a complete boomer. 

**"4. Does your dad have 3 fingers on his right hand?”**

Why would he ask such silly questions? “No”.

**“OOPS! THAT’S THE WRONG ANSWER.”**

Oh my God. Boomer.

**“5. Has your dad ever been kidnapped?”**

Kidnapped? Dad had told me everything about his childhood. If he had ever been kidnapped, I’d have known the story. “No”.

**“OOPS! THAT’S THE WRONG ANSWER.”**

That couldn’t be a coincidence. Dad wouldn’t just set three wrong answers by mistake.

It might’ve been a very traumatic event for him. So he probably buried it deep and never talked about it. That was the only thing that made sense to me.

Poor dad.

**"6. Does your dad still have both his kidneys?"**

At this point, these questions were making me uncomfortable. I tried to close the window on which I had opened the quiz but a big error message popped up on my screen.

**“ANSWERING ALL QUESTIONS IS MANDATORY.”**

Sighing, I returned to quickly finish it and answered the question. “No”.

**“OOPS! THAT’S THE WRONG ANSWER.”**

I felt a sour taste in my mouth. 

**"7. Has your dad’s left eye been pulled out of its socket?"**

Okay what the hell? Was this dad’s idea of a prank? “No”.

**“OOPS! THAT’S THE WRONG ANSWER.”**

A chill ran down my spine. I really hoped this was a joke. 

**“8. Is your dad writhing in pain right now?”**

And this was going too far now.

“Dad, this is not funny,” I yelled from my room. But I got no response. 

I got off my bed. The hallway was shrouded in darkness. I felt a knot in my stomach. “Dad?” I called out again, but the only thing I heard was my own echo in the somber silence.

I looked back at my phone. The question stared at me with the three options below it, waiting to be selected.

**“9. Is your dad writhing in pain right now?”**

I pressed “No.”

**“OOPS! THAT’S THE WRONG ANSWER.”**

I froze with fear. My heart pounded in my chest as the next question appeared.

**“10. Would you like to see him?”**

“Dad?” I tried to shout again, but all that came out was a shaky whisper.

Nervous, I pressed “Yes”.

**“LOADING…10%”**

The screen slowly loaded a grainy image of what looked like a dimly lit storage room. I saw two naked and brutalized legs. The right one was contorted at an unnatural angle, while jutting out of the left one was a broken femur…

**“LOADING…47%”**

The genital area of this body had been horrifyingly mutilated, with blood still dripping through the exposed veins and staining the carpet red. Thin tubes protruded from the sides of the body, leading to two crushed bean shaped organs…And the right hand only had 3 fingers… 

**“LOADING…78%”**

I saw my dad’s maimed face. One eye socket looked like a red abyss.

**"LOADING…100%”**

And then he moved.

I suddenly realized this was a live stream and not an image. Moaning in pain, my dad said, “Lily…run…”

But what petrified me more was a button that had emerged below the video saying:

**“NEXT QUIZ: HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOURSELF?”**
