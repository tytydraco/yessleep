The cops came and went carrying the chunk of meat with them. Nothing came of this. I called the local police department almost daily to ask whether they had found him, had a lead, found the victims, hell if they were even looking in the first place. They came up with nothing.

It was bizarre he hadn’t taken the car, none of his friends had seen him, and by the end of the month, when I received his bank statement in the mail, I noticed that he had not left the city to begin with. The list was not a full report, only spelled out a couple of transactions at liquor and grocery stores before asking to go the website to see the rest.

I stared at the page of transactions for what must have been an hour, a subtle trembling and nausea that could have either been excitement, or nerves disturbing my body. there was only one clear path forward, I knew that, and I knew what I would find and the end of it, I just wasn’t sure whether I could handle having my knowledge reassured.

I began searching for a private investigator right away. A good one is impressively difficult to find since any dickhead with a subscription to the whitepages and a car can apparently slap the title on himself and charge $50 an hour. But at the same time, they are concerningly just as common as people who will be able to duplicate a phone down to every account, they had ever associated it with.

I didn’t have enough money to even come close to hiring the latter (God knows if I ever will) but after a few hours, I had dug up a passport, and his birth certificate, packed them into a folder with the bank statement and got ready to meet up with the PI that I would be working with.

Steven, the private investigator, planned for us to meet up at a diner, two or so miles from my apartment. The choice of location was weird, I’d thought they would be more professional and call me up to a depressing beige office, but I was not complaining. It felt safer being out in public, even if the only other patrons of the diner were an older couple, maybe in their seventies, speaking so softly to each other, you’d think they had only been together for a year.

I’m not sure of his age, the conversation had not required him to mention it, and I was too uninterested to ask, but Steven was at least old enough to not have a single strand of hair that had not turned gray. He showed up ten minutes after me and five minutes early. We took a stall and got straight to work.

I explained everything I have typed out before, save for some details I’m sure I don’t have to pint out. He listened, intermittently taking sips of coffee and writing down notes on a small notepad. At the end of our conversation, he took the notes, the little amount of help I had brought him and four hundred dollars.

I’ll spare you from much of the verry little that happened over the next few days. But by the end of them, steven had managed to pull Gaige’s bank statements and found out that every Thursday, Gaige would usually pull money out of the same ATM.

I bit the bullet and paid Steven enough to camp out at the ATM, right at the time when Gaige would usually arrive. He was apparently hard to make out, wearing a thick black hoodie and a medical mask over his face, but once Steven confirmed that it was in fact Gaige, he began to follow him. Steven described the path he took as “awkward” Passing through alleyways, and taking long routes around certain areas instead of walking through them, cutting through a playground and jumping a fence to a cemetery that was weirdly right beside it. And at the end of it all, after a walk along a freeway, he arrived at an abandoned motel. Second floor, room number 4T.

I was too far in to give up, and work only paid me so much, so I took some money out of a savings account and paid Steven to intermittently watch the motel for another four days. Gaige only left the room early in the morning on the first and opted to order large bags of groceries for the rest.

There was a debate in my head to pay for more, but past the financial irresponsibility, I realized that it was just me putting of the inevitable, I knew where he was and as much as I had hoped that it was not true, I knew what he was, a killer.

I am aware that it was some pathetic, vigilante suicide mission, that there were better options, options that were safer for me. But I could not trust others with Gaige, he was mine, I knew him best and I needed to see him and talk to him to hear his reasoning. I needed closure to know why he had become this. I pretended nihilism, tricked myself into believing that I knew death would be the only way out of that motel room, but every thought I had and every plan I conjured up in m y head ended in me making it out alive, satisfied with all that transpired within.

It was raining when I got to the motel. I was running on twenty minutes of sleep and a half a gallon of red bull pushing itself down my piss pipes. I snuck a hunting knife into the neck of my right boot and got out of the car, hoping Gaige had not moved over the last day. I climbed up to the 2nd floor balcony and watched the numbers on the doors count down all the way to four.

I stood there for a moment, listening to the hissing rain and knocked. No one answered, just as I expected. “Gaige… it’s me… please let me in… I just want to talk” I knocked again and spoke to the door, just to get more of nothing in return.

I held the copy of the key Steven made for me. I’m doubtful of whether it was legal, or a part of his regular services, but I am sure that it was highly irresponsible of him.

It took me a moment to stabilize my trembling hands, but after a bit of struggle, I was rewarded with the click of an opening deadbolt and a stench that brought bile rising to the back of my throat.

The room stunk of rot, a crushing sweetness that sunk to the base of my gut and an aery, sourness that softly glided down the lining of my nostrils, leaving behind a nettle like trail of stinging aches. Each inhale left a bitter aftertaste on my tongue and a thick coating of bile on my teeth.

I stepped into pure darkness, and slapped my hand onto the wall to my right, looking for a light switch I did not know was there. I think this is where it began, the disassociation. Every decision past this point was either the reward of control that had to be fought for, or pure primal urges.

The switch flicked on an old and overworked yellow lightbulb, illuminating pure carnage. There was more of what I had expected, piles of teeth and bones ranging in size, a sheet of skin pinned to the wall like some form of morbid tapestry. But sadly, there was a lot more of what I hoped not to see, body parts, A lot of them, too many of them, piled wall to wall, sloping from the filthy carpet, all the way to the ceiling. Most dunes of rot were piles of indistinguishable chunks of meat, wet bones still poking out of the pinkish grey. In the mess, I could make out some arms and legs and torn chunks of torsos. Sets of scattered eyeballs and large blankets of skin covered the floor.

Some of the amputated pieces were organized, tossed into empty, plastic salt containers. But by the looks of it, he had given up on organization a while ago, as now, these containers held puddles of grey meat and mold, thick as moss.

I stared for a while, baffled by the sight in front of me, unsure of what to make of it, struggling to see it as anything more than a single conglomerate of flesh, bone and shit. Everything past this point was all filth, no reason behind it, no history, and no future that involved me, it was all just an obstacle that I would allow myself to process once it was something I had fled from. I had to go in deeper, I wanted to, I had to know, I had to see more and since he was nowhere to be seen, the lack of immediate danger drew me in further.

The bed was the worst it got, the mountain of bodily remains was now more of a wall, the flesh at the base crushed flat by the weight above it, entrails flowing in and out, wrapped around protruding bones and limbs. The wall sat nearly all the way up to the wall. I had to shimmy through the gap with my back facing the meat. I felt the warm decomposition soak into my jacket, replacing the cold of the rain. the squeeze through the gap took longer than expected, the crevice turning into a meaty tunnel lowering me down onto the filthy carpet, forcing me to twist my body and go on all fours.

The wet ground squelched under my hands and knees; I opted to not take my eyes off it as if I couldn’t feel it all. I felt limp fingers stroke my back and my shoulder slide across slick, exposed ribs. The end itself was a tight squeeze, Like I had just crawled through the bowels of a beast to emerge from its asshole. The wet meat around me aided in the final push and I easily slithered out into a surprisingly, but not well at all lit room.

There was something about the second half, it felt more hopeless, like I had just gazed into the void. The air was heavy with shame and a deeply brewing, hyper condensed sense of loss. I stood up, exhaling deeply, hoping to heave up the pain that had sunk to the depths of my lungs. Right in front of me, on the wall was a knife, pinning something to the nicotine and blood stained wallpaper.

Ignoring the rest of the room, I stepped in closer, trying to get a better look at what I was looking at. Something as small as this must have been special if it was given the same treatment as the full body sheets of skin.

The pinned meat hung limp, it looked like three separate strands. I only recognized what it was once I leaned in closer and saw that two of them ended with small ovals. It was a uterus.

The realization hit me at the same time as the loud screeching of a baby. It took me a second to gather myself. I crouched down, slid the knife out of my boot, and rushed over to the bathroom door in the back. I slammed the door open, and rushed in.

There were dozens of them, piled up in the sink, some premature, still underdeveloped red and pink jelly like meat wrapped around soft cartilage. The others looked older, with yellow skin that was still lathered in slime.

The screaming was coming from the bathtub; I expected the worst as I slowly shifted my gaze towards it. I expected some kidnaped woman tied down, smeared with blood and shit and forced to give birth.

But I saw Gaige with his hair clumped together by rot, his head tilted back, his yellow teeth gritted in pain. My eyes drifted down his body, to his belly button that was now an opening with the head of a baby poking out.

He grunted, and began to scream as the baby slid out more and more, twisting its body and dilating his hole until it finally, fully slithered out of his gaping vagina. He picked the baby up, weirdly not noticing me, and raised it to his chest.

“shhh… It’s okay now” he whispered to the newborn with a low pitched, bellowing voice.

The baby cried for a bit longer while Gaige grabbed his sagging left breast. I could not believe what I was seeing, I refused to believe what was going to happen would, but the baby latched on, and began drinking Gaige’s milk.

“shhh… it’ll all be fine now” he whispered again and stroked the baby’s cheek, while a sheet of skin peeled off his, and fell to the bottom of the tub with a wet smack.

I must have made some sort of noise at this point, because he quickly shot his vision up at me and stared. He stared at me for minutes on end, the baby still suckling from his teat, and I stared back. There is no doubt that both of us waited for the other to speak. I waited for an explanation and he waited for me to demand one, but neither of us could muster the bravery to speak.

He stared at me with those eyes, the same eyes that had wordlessly spoken messages of love and comfort to me, eyes that held the power to do so again. There was no malice behind them, there was no secrecy, just love, fear and sincerity.

He looked down at the baby when it began to scream again, it screamed so loud that the room shook so loud that I felt waves of sound vibrate against my skin. Soon after, it began to heave dry, and cough wet Flem in an unending cycle. I tried to step in instantly but Gaige raised his arm.

“No! you’ll hurt it more” his voice boomed.

The baby took over a minute to die, I watched in shock as it began to slowly turn purple, Gaige only looked down to it with pity while it shifted colors and flailed hopelessly.

After it fell limp, Gaige raised the umbilical cord to his mouth and ripped it with his teeth, the flesh tore with a wet zip. It all felt like a routine that he had fined down to a point, his eyes drooped, the death had hurt him, I was sure of that, but he opted to go about it in a rather sterile, emotionless manner.

I took a quick step backwards when he finally rose to his feet. He was taller, maybe by a foot or two and he was naked, both his single breast and flaccid penis hung and flailed with his motions in unison.

He looked down at me while he stepped out of the bathtub, his face unsure “I… I don’t know what to tell you… I don’t know what any of this is…” he laid the baby onto the pile “I don’t…” he burst into tears, weeping loudly “I don’t know what I am” he gasped between sobs, the weight of fear pulling tears out of his eyes, and raised his hands to his face, one of them was slender and brown, it’s wrinkled skin clung to his bones “I don’t know what…” his voice repeated, muffled behind his hands.

I lowered the knife, I hadn’t realized that I was still holding it up until then “Gaige, hun…” I stepped forward and reached for his face, gently stroking his cheek “it’s okay… I don’t need an explanation; you don’t owe me one… I saw it all, I know that you’re not a monster”

He looked into my eyes, a glint of hope shining in the corners of his. After all this time, after all these fears, surrounded by death and rot, I saw Gaige again, Gaige, the person, scared and lost, weeping in my arms like he had Hundreds of times before.

Out of nowhere he backed away from me and began to cough. He coughed on, his chest heaving up and down. In the crossfire, his single, sagging breast ripped off his body and spanked onto the ground, splattering a snotty green slime from its jaggedly ripped end. I looked up from the ground to his wound, meeting with the freshly developed flat chest that matched his other breast.

He kept coughing past that though. Kept coughing until a strip of meat slithered out of his throat and hung down between his teeth. I felt guilty watching him but there wasn’t much more that I could do.

He reached up to the meat with his non decomposed arm and coiled the strip around his index finger before pulling slowly. I heard his throat let out a low-pitched squeak as more of the strip left him. Each millimeter of pulled flesh came with a muted reverberating snap of tendons shaking his throat. He pulled it further, coiling more of the bodily tissue around his finger and then, gave one final tug. The strip of flesh and the vocal cord at its and flung out of Gaige’s mouth, he only reacted with a weak cough and tossed it onto the ground.

“is there a way to stop this?” I asked “I’ll do anything… please just tell me we can fix this”

He responded by opening a tub of table salt that sat beside the bathtub, raising it up to his mouth and dumping all its contents down his throat. With his head tilted back, like a snake unhinging its jaw, he struggled to take it all down. So, he turned around, stepped under the shower head, and flipped it on, flushing it all down with the help of suspiciously brown, warm water.

He took a moment, and then, without any subtlety in his speech he said “you have to kill me” his voice, now a higher pitched rasp.

“NO!” I yelled “There has to be another way. There has to---”

“there isn’t! This is it, this is the best it’ll ever be” he shouted back “I’m rotting, inside and out. And I tried to fix it, I tried to give it what it wanted, I fed it. But it’s a bastard, scum, living under my skin. The fucker can’t do shit right”

“what are you talking about?” I asked, baffled by the senseless string of words

“it promised that it’d stop punishing me if I fed it, that it would regenerate all that I lost” his voice had grown more somber now, I listened, my confusion forcing me into silence “when it didn’t stop and when it remade me wrong, I peeled my skin off, I wanted to scrape it’s spunk off of myself. But it had seeped too deep, it’s not just under my skin, or wedged between the fibers of my muscles, the mucus is in my sweat and tears, it’s wrapped around my blood cells, it’s slowly taking over” he took another short brake, wiping the tears from his eyes, one of which incidentally happened to pop out of it’s socket “I need you to kill me” he repeated, pinching his optic nerve with his index and middle finger “please” he yanked the eyeball out of its socket, the thread of meat behind it sliding out with a slurp and another eyeball sliding into its place moments later.

“Gaige, I can’t just kill you” I explained “I can’t just give up so soon and let you go… I just can’t… I need you, I can’t see myself going on without you, knowing what I did to you… it’s just…”

“DO YOU THINK ITS EASY FOR ME!?” he lashed out “I’m losing control, this body isn’t mine anymore. if I could, I would’ve slit my throat weeks ago! And…” I saw him hesitate “And where do you think those babies come from?! I fucked myself, and I couldn’t do anything to stop it. it has my body; it’s raped me and any day now it’ll take over my mind too!” I stared at him feeling shame drape over me “the mucus, It wants to be born again, it wants to take a human shape, disguise itself” he took in a deep breath “I can’t do it myself, it won’t let me, so please… kill me”

I broke and clung to him, crying. Wrapped my arms around his unfamiliar body, and pulled him in so hard I was sure we would melt into one.

“But before you do” He leaned away for a moment “I need you… one last time”

He was already leaning in for a kiss when I moved away from his chest, a bridge of gunk arching between us. I took his slips, God, it had been ages since I had felt them, no matter how many times they might have been revised, they felt the same.

We stumbled out of the bathroom, mouths hungry and intertwined, caressing each other. I lowered my lips down to his neck where a small flab of skin peeled off and flew down my throat, it tasted of bitter, long brewing sweat.

While he undressed me, I slid my hand down his chest, it was slick with the mucus and blood. Near the base of his torso, I slid two fingers inside of his new, dilated hole, and felt him shudder in response.

It felt bizarre, getting fucked on top of a piles of decomposing flesh, but it had all felt too familiar to be repulsive, it was all Gaige, ripped and tattered and heaved up, sure, but it was him in the rawest form wrapped all around me, smeared across me.

He stopped at one point to unpin the knife from the wall; the uterus had hung so long it had dried and stayed glued to it. Once he walked back over to me, he handed the blade over, there were no words exchanged, there wasn’t a reason to.

We continued, a growing anxiousness rising as we neared the end. I raised the knife to his throat, its weight held firm, the blade softly biting at his skin, drawing beads of blood.

“I love you” he moaned just before I slashed the knife across his throat. Hot blood came spilling from his esophagus and poured over me. I continued cutting, swinging the knife left and right, the metal gliding through him with a hiss. I kept cutting, the sharp metal only momentarily struggling to get thought bone, until his head and his body dropped down on top of me as separates.

It was a battle to roll him off me, some of his muscles still flinched and his stump was still poring dark crimson in sync with his slowing heartbeat. His body creaked as it twisted and finally gave out, rolling over to my side.

I could not look at him, see what he had become, see what I had done to him. I got to my feet, put my clothes back on, crawled out of the meat tunnel and into the liberating, frigid air outside.

The rain had intensified. The grey puddles that had riddled the cement before were now replaced by a constant ankle high pool. I walked down the stairs, mind distant, still shaking off the orgasmic high. The rain began carrying the filth down my body and legs with spiderwebbed rivers of gore. My skin was a refreshing cold, my lungs happy to breath anything but the brewing stench of shit and rot.

I drove home, rushed up the stairs to my apartment, first hopeful, then thankful that they were deserted. I spent an hour in the shower, pretending that I was disgusted by the grime lathered into the grooves of my skin, while in reality, I was talking myself in circles, trying to force a thought that could process what I had seen and done.

Gaige was the only person I had trusted to know me and to love me. He was the only person I had cared for, and the only person that had cared for me. The first person that helped me fall asleep at night with the promise of making the next morning worth waking up to. And he held that trust, that love and care until the end.

I’m pregnant. I’ve miscarried eight times, only the first was an accident. I feel it growing inside of me. Every night, it gets larger and hotter, waking me up in agonizing pain. As it begins to char my insides, smoke comes pouring out of me. I must feed it until it's contempt, and when the fucker decides to slide out of me, I’ll snap its fucking neck.
