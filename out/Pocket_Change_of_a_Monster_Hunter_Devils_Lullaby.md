Hello Everyone,
Victoria signing in.
As quite a few people saw my group's last publication, the story if you will,  so I have now returned to share another one today. 
Last time we discussed a case of a singular creature bringing misery to a lone family.  Contrary to this,  today we will be taking a look at the catastrophic demise of an entire German town in the year 2008. On the 20th of June 2008, the town [private information]  was stripped of all human life. On all official records, there is no evidence regarding this but there is a voice recording that was recovered from the ruins of the city.  A single man thought it to be a worthwhile idea to document the downfall of his home.  That man's name was Nathan G.  While Mr.  G., unfortunately, didn't survive the ordeal,  his voice has.  So now following are the last wows of a doomed man toward his home. Fully translated from German to English for easier reading. 

June 1st,  2008:
Hello to whoever finds this. [private information],  the town I live in will probably have perished and me alongside it. Worry not, I have made peace with my situation. Oh, I guess I should introduce myself. I am Prof. Dr. Nathan G. and I am a teacher of anthropology at the University of [private information]. 
*Audible drinking of water and clearing of throat*
Excuse me, all of this is getting to me quite a bit.  

Now the reason all of this is being recorded is that a strange illness has befallen my hometown. By this, I do not mean to describe an illness of the physical health nor one that befalls one's mind in the classical sense.  Sin has held a victory march into everyone's home and nobody does anything about it. It all started with the appearance of a musician from a faraway part of Germany. A flutist, supposedly world famous, wishing to give concerts in our little backwater city.  I had a bad feeling right away but no one ever listens to me. Last night the stranger held his first show and it was horrific.  In the beginning, it was as any good show should be,  people dancing, drinking, losing themselves in the music.  The weirdness didn't take very long to start because after a short while the crowd's temperament started to shift. The dancers got more and more excited, starting to tear off each other's clothes and violently making love. Each new song escalated their behaviour further until eventually, it was a writhing mass of intertwined flesh and blood. Unable to bear witness to it any longer I fled the scene.  Furthermore, when I went out for groceries this morning everyone seemed to stare at me.

Things have gotten drastically worse since my first recording. Not only has that damned piper been spreading his ungodly tunes every night since the start of the month,  no the entire town feels like a giant powder keg. Everyone's general willingness for violence has gone up to a frightening degree.  Just this morning two young men got into a fight over bumping into each other.  It was horrific.  One guy lost both his eyes and lips. The other guy would have straight-up torn him to shreds if the police hadn't shown up.  However, that is where it got worse as instead of trying to talk to them they just shot them both. While everyone else just quietly gathered around,  staring with a hungry look in their eyes as if they were just waiting their turn.

*Sound of a man sobbing*
Oh dear God,  oh Lord,  the end times are upon us. When I left my house today I saw my neighbors violating the corpse of a man from one street over.  It was not the only case of depravity I witnessed as the local butcher was cutting up people he had scraped off the street, the Doctor was opening up living children for everyone's viewing pleasure and so much more. The town's temper is feverish and violent. I fear that it's going to collapse in on itself any day now. The only ray of light is that the 20th with hold the Piper's last concert here,  titled "Repayment".  Maybe after that, it will all be over and all those fallen to sin will find their senses again. 

June 20th,  2008:

Oh my Lord Jesus Christ,  I beg of you to save your lost son from this hell fallen on earth. I resisted the devil's lullaby,  I alone did. All the others are gone,  swallowed up by the maw of the abyss. During the concert today a mass of rats sprang forth from every hole and crevice,  no matter how impossibly slim or small,  making their way to the dancing folk.  And oh did they dance. More manic and crazy with every single note escaping the tempter's flute.  Round and round, faster and faster,  wilder and wilder. And the rats piled up around them like a swelling tide, casting a shadow on the psychotic mass. Higher and higher they rose until they were like a wave mighty enough to crush buildings.  And with the piper's last song ending they collapsed on the crowd with the sound of screams and crunching bones. Meat being ripped and torn, blood being gulped up, and yells of panic, fear, and ecstasy drowned out by the furry flood. I now sit here in the space where hundreds of people just celebrated and have nothing to prove what happened. Not a single piece of anyone remains.  
*The sound of footsteps, followed by a smooth, almost hypnotic voice*
Oh foolish creature, unable to enjoy my wonderful song. May your words be your legacy and you one of my many mouths.  And you who bear witness to this at this very moment at any point in the future, know that I can see you.  Know that one day even your time is up. 



With that today's document reaches its end. I hope your eyes will be more vigilant and your ears filled with more suspicion toward music that sounds too heavenly to be real.  
Loving, 
Victoria.
