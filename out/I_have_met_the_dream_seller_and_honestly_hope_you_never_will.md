My name... My name is Raul... I think? Or was it Michael? No, not that... Maybe Jordan...



Focus... Focus... Please focus...



I... can't remember. Truth be hold, I barely remember anything of who I am, or was at this point. I am pretty certain I used to be a mechanic at a local garage shop. Or was I an accountant? 



I can only remember bits and pieces, a mesh of identities more akin to an abstract painting rather than a coherent being. Even now, I am struggling to pull on whatever information I can gather from the broken shards of my memories, so that I may warn you of the things I do remember. One thing I am certain of however. I remember how I felt when I met him. The dream seller.



Hopeless. Alone. Scared of tomorrow.



Why was I feeling like this? Did my wife divorce me? No... she died in a car accident year ago. That, or cancer. 



Point is, I still recall that I heard from someone, or seen somewhere, that there was someone that sold dreams. Promises of peace and quiet among restless nights of anger and sorrow. Whoever I am, all of my memories point that I was on a one-way road to collapse and I thought: Why not? Medication won't help me anyway. Maybe therapy...



Despite everything, I still see them clear as day. The merchant of my supposed hopes. Whatever doubt I had about the legitimacy of what I was getting into disappeared when I put my eyes on them.



I say them because I couldn't figure out what they were. They were humanoid, sure, but there was a certain air to them. Otherwordly. The face of an elderly man in one second, then one of a toddler. The built of a bodybuilder and the build of an actress. Obese and anorexic. Taller than a door-frame and barely able to get to my knees. 



Their voice, man and woman, sweet as poisoned honey, welcomed me to their humble abode filled with luxurious intricacies.



I told them of my plight, whatever it was, and I have been told that they have just the thing. The dream of a billionaire, rich and satisfied. 



The price, of course, was a triviality. A simple story about me, such as what I ate yesterday or the last time I scratched my back. At the time, I thought it was a weird request, and so I obliged. With a smile, they told me I shall see my dream the next time I went to sleep, and by God I had that dream. 



I found myself in a private club, surrounded by my friends and lover, partying the night away in a place I didn't even know could exist, let alone step inside of it. Naturally, I wanted more.



I sampled all sorts of dreams. Powerful executives and hot-shot actors. The quiet life of a family man with two children. A high-schooler confessing to their crush, only to find there is mutual affection. 



Night after night, dream after dream, I was finally living. I was happy. What was I running from?



The demands of the dream seller were always the same, yet they were different. Always a story, always something about myself that for some reason they were interested in. 



Over time, the stories became more complex and detailed. They asked me about my job, my love life, my hopes and dreams. I trusted them, trusted them with my very being. And that was my mistake. 



Slowly, over time, the dreams started to blend in together. I kept forgetting, not being sure what was my life or what was my dream.



It was too late when I realized what was going on. Mere minutes ago. Minutes! My addled mind saw through the disguise of that... thing... 



I don't want to do this... I want it to stop... Please... Remember... Who am I?



I do not wish anyone to live through this living nightmare, to lose themselves in the dreams of others, to forget what made someone, someone... I don't want to lose myself anymore...



Whoever is going to read this, listen. LISTEN! Under no circumstances, however bad your life is, do not search for the-



Wait. What was I talking about again? Think... Ah right! I wanted to tell you all about the dream seller. They provided me with some quality dreams to deal with my day-to-day life. In fact, I have been such a faithful customer, they agreed to come for a house-call for once-in-a-lifetime specialized dream request. The last dream I will ever need is what they said. How exciting! 



So, remember, if you are in a rut, there is someone out there willing to provide for you whatever you need. All they ask if for a simple story.
