Me and Bill had always been mates. For as long as I could remember, we were inseparable. We would get on our bikes every morning at 11, when we didn’t have school or any other obligations, and would waste the day away mucking around in town or in the woods.

I remember one time we snuck into the abandoned warehouse about 10 minutes away from both of our houses and camped there for two nights – we were always doing stuff like that… good times.

When you’re at that age, you never think it’ll end, until it does. After we finished Secondary School and were choosing which college we wanted to go to, that’s when it all started to fall apart; he went one way, and I went the other. It was bound to happen, and I think a part of me knew that, but it still stung.

We would still hang out, mind you, but it was obvious that he was moving on. It went from every free day to once a week then once every other week… you get the point.

It reached its worst when, a few days ago, I messaged him on Snap asking if he wanted to watch the comet that evening with me and he sent me a picture of him with his new mates captioned: “Nah”.

That was the last straw. If he wanted to go without me, let him. I decided to give up on going, as I didn’t want to have to be there with my parents and nobody else and so I turned in an early night that evening, as everyone on my road, hell, even the town went to watch.

Fuck that. I know in retrospect it sounds really petty, but you need to understand that this was a year of lying to myself all finally crashing down at once. I couldn’t be fucked anymore.

I turned in an early night and went to sleep shortly after I heard my parents slam the front door closed. It was a dreamless sleep.

...

When I woke up the next morning, it didn’t take long for me to realise something was wrong. I got dressed, stumbled downstairs and washed my face. It was then that I remembered what Bill had said yesterday and my mood instantly soured. What a prick. I finished washing my face and then went down into the hallway. It was a cursory glance at the floor when I noticed something that made my blood ran cold.

My parent’s shoes and coats weren’t here.

I checked the shoe cupboard, I looked in the living room right next to me, I searched just about everything on the ground floor.

I couldn’t find anything.

It was only when I mustered up the courage to open their bedroom door that my worst fear was confirmed: the bed was empty. Whatever happened last night, they never came back home.

I wanted to call someone. I wanted to search the entire town for them. I would spend an entire day looking, if needed.

I tried to think rationally. I needed to eat something. It would be stupid to try and tear through an entire town on an empty stomach, I knew that at least.

With shaking hands, I poured out a bowl of cereal and dumped two scoops of my dad’s protein powder supplement inside – I needed to be strong, I reasoned. I sat on the sofa in front of the TV and tried to temporarily take my mind off things if I could.

It was then where the second weird thing happened: the news channel just showed an empty room. Nobody was there.

The only thing I could hear was the faint buzzing of some appliance in my house, it was creepy. The newsroom was still, silent. You could’ve said that it was a picture, an image, but I could see the big screen behind the news desk still playing a looping animation.

I grabbed the remote and started flicking through channels.

It was all the same. Either static, or empty rooms. The cameras just left in place and broadcasting, with no interruption.

Something serious had happened last night, that was unmistakable. But what could it have been? Everyone had been outside, watching that stupid comet fly by: a literal speck in the sky.

I finished my cereal, got my shoes and coat on, and, after a deep breath, went outside. I walked down the path towards the gate and, as I was, I looked up over the fence into my neighbour’s garden. She was there, at least – on her wheelchair. I breathed a sigh of relief. At least someone was normal. I called out to her.

“Janet?”

Her old bones creaked as she craned her head towards me at an almost impossible angle. Her eyes were… blank, I guess. Unfocused. Glassed over. Her mouth was moving, but if she was mouthing words or just twitching, I couldn’t tell.

“Janet? Are you OK?” I called out.

She didn’t respond. Instead, she pulled herself off her chair, and, started to drag herself towards the wall separating our gardens. It was as she got closer that I got a better look at her. She was drooling.

I could start to hear what she was saying, but it was just whispers of gibberish. I swear I heard her whisper something like “It’s beautiful, you just have to see, let me show you.”

She then started to scratch at the brick wall, desperately trying to pull herself up, but she didn’t have the strength to lift herself. All the while keeping perfect eye contact with me, or maybe looking past me… I don’t know. Her eyes were milky white so I couldn’t tell what way she was facing. It was… I don’t know.

I didn’t know what to think anymore. My parents were my top priority, so I just rationalised it as an old woman gone mad, pushed it to the back of my mind and left her to it.

I opened the gate and stepped out into the main street. I’d never seen it so… empty. It was quiet. Nobody was around. I wasn’t sure if I’d prefer an empty street, or one filled with people in the same state as Janet was there.

I pushed on though.

I remembered that the night before they had mentioned that the plan was to go up to the top of town, near that abandoned warehouse as there was a hill that would have a great view of the comet. Seemed like a good place to start.

I passed the corner shop, and I took a quick glance inside. It was empty, of course, unmanned.

It wouldn’t hurt, I thought, I mean… nobody’s around.

I slipped inside and grabbed a pack of crisps. I took care to stay as silent as I could, even though I was sure the place was deserted it was just… maybe I was lucky there was a wall separating me from Janet earlier.

I was about to walk out of the shop when I changed my mind and headed back in, this time grabbing two more packs, and some generic energy drink.

That should last me for a good while, I thought.

I made my way out of the little shop and, as I turned the corner, I caught sight of a whole load of them. People. Sort of clustered together in a group about fifty metres away, backs facing me.

I opened my mouth to call out to them but then stopped myself.

How do I know that they’re not like Janet? I thought.

I decided that it would be best to stay inside the relative safety of the little shop, at least for a little while, letting myself take a look every couple of minutes. The road was long, and they would definitely be able to see me if I hung around too much in the open, so it was better like this.

They didn’t move for a solid five minutes, maybe more. And as time went on, my patience decreased until I decided I should probably make a move.

I took another look. There was about twenty of them, all packed together, unmoving, staring at… who knows what. I tried to see what it was that got them so interested but I couldn’t spot anything out of the ordinary.

I took a deep breath and stepped back out onto the road. I slowly walked away from them. They were blocking the way to that hill, so I’d have to go the longer way round. It wasn’t an issue, of course – I still knew the way regardless - but I wanted as little time out here as possible.

After a few minutes I turned left and continued walking.

I started to think. What if Mum and Dad ended up like Janet – like those people? Would I be able to save them? Fix them? No, they had to be fine.

I can’t be the only normal person left – that’s just not possible.

I took comfort with that thought. Surely someone else must have called it an early night like I did, right? That was the only thing I could think of as to why everyone was acting like this… and I was still normal.

I was grateful, of course, but I was still weary. What caused everyone to be like this? I turned right. I mean, if the news stations are empty as well, wouldn’t that mean that this has happened across the entire country?

That was a chilling thought.

I was close now, anyway. But as I neared, one thought kept repeating itself in my mind: Why me?

...

I had arrived now: the hill where my parents and most of the town had gone. And here there was… nothing. Nothing here at all. Empty. My heart sank - all I could see was cans of energy drinks and packets littering the grassy floor. Other than that… there really wasn’t anything else.

I think this is when all of the emotions I had bottled up over the course of this day finally came out. I guess I had hoped so much that I was right, that they would be here, that it would be OK, that it would go back to how it was, that I’d deluded myself with an impossible reality.

Of course they’re gone. Everyone else is.

I sat down on the wooden bench just at the top of the hill, defeated. A tear escaped my eye and rolled down my cheek. I wiped it away and then just started crying. Sobbing. It was all just so fucked.

I was maybe just sat there on the park bench, my face red and puffy, for about 10 minutes before I finally decided to pull myself together and stay strong. If I was the only human left, then I couldn’t just give up and let myself rot away.

It was then that I’d remembered: the warehouse, I hadn’t checked in the warehouse.

I slowly got up from the bench, wiped my eyes, and with a (somewhat) renewed determination climbed down the other side of the hill towards that building. It still looked about the same as when me and Bill had camped inside it all those years ago but.. now that I was looking at it, I couldn’t help but wonder: Had that massive hole in the top always been there?

I didn’t remember ever noticing it, although I hadn’t been round there for a quite a while so there was still a chance that the roof had collapsed in during that time but… now that I was looking at it I could see how the surrounding area around that gaping hole in the roof had been charred, burned.

My hopes started to rise.

A lot of people could fit inside that place. It was big. It seemed entirely possible to me that they could be hiding in there, waiting this out.

I ran down the hill as fast as I could without tripping and then circled round the fence to the far side, to see if the opening that me and Bill had used was still there. To my shock, it was. In fact, that entire bit of wire fence had been almost torn off. People had been here.

My hopes continued rising.

My shaking hands rested on the door to the building and pushed. I knew they were in here.

It was dark in there, impossibly so. I grabbed my phone and switched the torch on. I quickly panned it around the room and once I deemed it to be safe, I turned my attention to the door and pushed further. As I pushed it open, I noticed I was in a corridor leading into probably the next section. It was when I looked into one of the rooms along it that I saw them.

Mum and Dad.

I ran towards them, calling their names.

“Mum! Dad! It’s me – Michael! I didn’t know where to find you guys and I’ve been…”

My voice turned hollow.

“Mum?”

She was looking at me, or past me maybe, with those same milky unfocused eyes that Janet had.

I was too late.

I didn’t know what I was going to do but before I could even make a decision, she spoke.

“Michael?”

I looked back to her.

“Mum?”

“Michael, where have you been?”

“I… I was out looking for you.”

“Don’t worry about that now. You’re here with us, and the rock.”

I was confused.

“The rock?”

“Yes,” she said, excitedly, “let me show you. You’ll love it, I promise.”

Her grip on my arm was strangely tight. She led me back into the corridor and down into the next part of the building and, as I looked back, I saw dad just sat there, unaware I had been in the room, muttering to himself and playing with his hands.

I could see a green pulsating glow coming from the room ahead of me, impossibly bright. My mother opened the door and pushed me inside.

“Now,” she said, “look at the rock.”

I squeezed my eyes shut and faced the other way.

“Michael,” she said, her voice now stern but still soft, “Look. At. The. Rock.”

And so I did.

...

It was incredible. It was everything and nothing. It filled my vision yet it was small. It spoke to me in a way that I needed, telling me that everything would be OK and that I was safe now. I was with it now.

*Michael, stay here*. *Keep looking Michael,* the voice said.

And I did.

I could feel all my fears and troubles just sink away  – I can’t really describe it to you but it felt incredible. It spoke with the voice of a thousand and with the conviction of a million. I somehow knew that it wanted what was best for me, for all of us.

I realised that all those people I had seen on the street  that day wanted this for me, for me to be happy. They weren’t zombies, I valued them now. I no longer felt any fear.

I hadn’t blinked in minutes.

What was I looking for? I thought, and in truth, I couldn’t really remember.

All that mattered was that I was here in this room with that rock.

I sat down and kept looking, smiling. My mind went blank.

It told me stories about how it came to us to free us, to save us and how we would be joined by its creators soon. And it all sounded very good.

On its way through our galaxy it had noticed our planet, changed course suddenly to go towards us and splintered off into a million pieces, bringing its gift to as many as possible. Each chunk would grow and spread until all of us were being rewarded with its gift, until the rest come.

I don’t honestly know how long I was in that room just staring at it, but it flew by. I slowly stood up and broke my gaze with the rock, Just a little break, I thought, I’ll come back as soon as I can.

The rock agreed and let me stretch my legs.

I finally broke eye contact with it for the first time in what felt like forever and looked around the room. It had been washed green, but I had no issue with that. In fact, I decided that green would now be my favourite colour.

I felt happy and free.

It was only when I looked at the people surrounding me that something felt wrong.

Over the loud almost heartbeat that this rock was making, I could see and hear people writhing around in blind  ecstasy. It started to creep me out.

*Michael…*

I heard the voice calling.

*Michael… come back and I’ll tell you more stories. Look at me again.*

But I found now I didn’t want to.

I faked a smile, and fighting the urge to just look back around and fall back into that state I was in again, I slowly left the room.

I could hear the rock calling for me. Begging for me to look at it. Promising me the world and more, and believe me it was hard, but I had to stay strong. I kept walking and didn’t look back until I had made it back out to the wire fence around the building.

...

I haven’t felt the same since.

It felt almost like a drug withdrawal, if that makes sense. I was constantly fighting the urge to go back inside and rejoin it. But, in the last day or so I’ve been feeling a lot better. I’ve stopped shivering as much and can now coherently think about anything other than the rock for longer than ten minutes.

I’m writing this now in hopes that anyone is still normal in the world and to warn you to be careful and avoid what I did because… I guess I was lucky. I don’t know how long I would’ve been there for if I hadn’t gotten to my senses.

As I mentioned earlier, the rock spoke of more of its kind joining us, or whatever that means. Safe to say, I’m not positive about the future.

Stay safe.
