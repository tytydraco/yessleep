# 1



Andrew Ross was supposed to be Belle County's invincible street racer, but I watched him die today, just hours after I learned he was sleeping with Gale. The screams started before the engine died, and all I could hear was the quiet confession from Gale earlier that morning. We were spooned together in bed, his arms cinched around my waist like a drawstring bag.

He whispered it into my ear, “I slept with Andrew.” 

The words hung heavier than the summer humidity. I felt my breath hitch. I didn’t move, I couldn't– Eight years of quite intimacy flashed through my eyes—eight *years* of squabbles, date nights, and long car rides. I scrambled to comprehend the casual confession, but all I could picture was Andrew– arrogant and boastful, the king of the underground races. Just a few hours later, I would watch him veer off the road and wrap his Porsche 944 around a tree. For me, the death was more than a blow of steel and shrapnel. When Gale and I got home from the races, it ignited a physical, desperate fight. I left our apartment with blood dripping down my nose and nowhere else to go besides the doorstep of my neighbor, Belle County’s deputy, Chester Crass Blackwell. I knocked my hand against his door, hoping Gale wouldn’t come storming out of ours. 

“Hello?” The deputy said as he opened the door. I watched his eyes take in my bruised nose, bloody knuckles, and ripped jeans. Gale was still throwing things around in our apartment. It was audible even across the two lawns between us. “Are you okay?” 

I found my chest hitching at him. I giggled. *I giggled*! Before shaking my head and pathetically asking if I could *please come in.* 

The deputy set me up in his kitchen. He handed me a roll of paper towels and told me to keep my head leaned back. He hadn’t asked questions, and for that I was grateful. Trying to distract myself from the gallon of blood leaking from my face, I took in his kitchen. It was pristine, as if he hadn’t lived here for the six years that Gale and I had rented across the street. 

“Keep your head up.” He stipulated. “At least try not to stain my countertops.” 

I tensed. I was having the worst day of my life. God forbid, I wasn’t thinking of the state of his countertop? He was rummaging through his empty freezer. He came back with a bag of frozen peas. 

“Here.” He held them up to me and sat down across the table. 

I mumbled my thanks before pressing the chilled vegetables to my eye, keeping my head up. Gale had struck one solid blow to the bridge of my nose, hitting my eye as he did. Like most of our fights, I was the one who started it. I don’t know why I let Gale race Andrew, or why I agreed to be his plus one to the event. At the time, I was still reeling– A part of me thinking that I could be okay with Gale’s betrayal. It was wishful thinking. He would win against Belle County's racing king and pull me from the crowd to declare what a colossal mistake he made. He would make a scene out of it, scooping me up like we are Jake Gyhlennhal and Heath Ledger starring in an alternate southern romance flick with a happy ending. But I was the one pulling Gale from his car while Andrew’s sat in a pile of smoking shambles. Gale was dazed, and I was blisteringly drunk. Trying to get through the law enforcement questioning was gruelling. Gale didn’t speak; he never took his eyes off the crash scene. When I drove us away, his eyes were glued to it; he kept mumbling about how it looked like Andrew was fighting with someone to control the wheel. I thought he was just out of it. It did strike me as odd how many officers were there. The drive home would have been better if it was silent. The rumblings of my old Volvo were the backdrop to our labored breathing. Gale was shaking and sweating furiously. I lost it when he asked me if I saw Andrew *slither* out of his car. I hadn’t gotten so much as an apology from him. He had spent the whole night ignoring me, I watched him laugh with Andrew before they bumped knuckles to race. So while I hadn’t thrown the first punch, I had initiated the fight. 

“Why are you still holding your head up?” The deputy probed. I realized the fresh paper towel I had pressed against my nose was still clean. I lower my head, the deputy staring me down. His eyes were squinty and deep-set. I felt a pang of guilt realizing it was absurdly late in the night. “Will you tell me what happened, or are we just going to keep having a staring contest?” 

“Right– I, um… My roommate and I got into a fight.” I said, suddenly at a loss for words. I couldn’t tell him we were at the races, hopefully he didn’t know. On top of that, I could barely process that I had been cheated on. How was I supposed to admit it to a complete stranger? I had only crossed paths with Crass a handful of times. What if he was like the folks back home? I had no way of knowing if it was safe for me to tell him I was gay. 

“You were at the races tonight, right?” The deputy looked closer at my face. “You were stumbling all over the place, completely wasted.” 

I kept my mouth shut. I did not need a D.U.I or a lecture on the dangers of drinking and driving on top of everything. Surveying me, the deputy stood up and got me a bottle of water. I thanked him, but when I took a sip, I realized my lip had also been split.

“Do you and your roommate fight often?” He asked. 

“Not like this. Not normally, at least.” I replied. 

“What was the catalyst tonight then? The race put you guys on edge?” the deputy poked. 

I nodded, pressing my fingers to the bridge of my swollen nose. The shock had started to wear off, and my whole face felt singed with pain. I was sick of questions, sick of being bossed around and betrayed. I needed a drink and a long, *long* nap.

 “I’m sorry for intruding like this.” I say, “Thank you for your help, but it's late. I should go.” 

“Where?” The deputy asked. 

“A hotel. Why do you care?”

“Do you have your keys? How are you going to get a room?” 

I press my hands around the pockets of my jeans. He was right. I cursed at myself. In the frenzy of the fight, I had lost my keys. Even if I did have my wallet, but I doubted I even had enough money for the Motel 6. I pressed my fingers harder against my nose. 

“Hey, quit it! You’ll make it bleed again.” The deputy swatted at my hand, “Wha– Shit man, are you crying?” 

“Damn it.” I wipe my face pathetically. 

“Relax.” The deputy's tone went several octaves softer. 

I was humiliated at how nice it felt not to be yelled at. Even if it was just because the Deputy wanted me to stop crying. 

“Look, I won’t kick you out or make you go back there. It’s my civil duty to protect people. That's why I let you in in the first place.” 

“I don’t have anywhere to go.” I whisper. I cringed when I rubbed my bruised eye. 

"Family? Friends? Anywhere I can drop you off.” 

I shook my head. I moved to Louisiana with Gale when I was eighteen. Gale had lived here his whole life up until he moved to Maine during our junior year. At the age, I was in the darkest spot I had ever been. I was mad at everything. When Gale came around, he told me he had friends down south, friends who would be okay with the two of us dating. And the idea of beging welcomed somewhere enticed me. I left Maine with my boyfriend of two years without realizing that Gale’s idea of friends were a bunch of redneck drag racers who only tolerated queer people because they were too scared to admit they were themselves.

“Then you can stay here.” The deputy said. “I’ll set you up in the living room. In the morning, you can go get your things, then we will be out of each other's hair.” 

"You don’t have to do-” 

“And I wouldn’t if you had anywhere else to go.” He snaps back. I see him cringe at his outburst. “What happened to Ross was rough on everyone who saw it. Victoria’s boy, Gale’s too.” He said her name like it struggled to comply with his tongue. 

My lip throbbed, but I spat, “He wasn’t Gale’s boy.” Countertops be damned. 

The deputy pauses. I can see him putting the pieces together—the puzzle of Blance Spheres’ catastrophic dating life. I blinked repeatedly, refusing to cry again. 

“What I meant to say is that crowd is no good. It would do you some good to stay out of it.” 

When I don’t answer, he hands up again. I almost don’t take it when he reaches his hand out to me. His grip is firm, his hands are big and haired slightly at the knuckles. 

“Crass Blackwell.” He states. I notice the exclusion of his first name. I do not question it. 

"Blance Sphere,” I say back.

Crass Blackwell was the type to wake up with the birds. The precision with which he handled his espresso machine gave the impression that he refused to sleep in, even if we had been awake well into the night. I had to recount the night's previous events, trying to sort them out through my throbbing headache. Gale and I had broken up, and I had absolutely nowhere to go. I groaned at everything and buried my face into my hands. The clothes Crass let me borrow were baggy on me, but I didn’t think they would fit him either. I couldn’t imagine a shirt that was only a little baggy around my shoulders fitting him. It smelled clean. In fact, everything in his apartment smelled like disinfectant. That, combined with the espresso machine whirring away, did not alleviate my hangover. From the kitchen, Crass flicked on a small radio. He hummed along to a Randy Travis song, tapping his spoon to the beat. I couldn’t wrap my head around him. The state of his apartment reminded me of folks back in Maine. Educated and prestigious with an air of superiority that I avoid like the plague. He drank from a gentrified hippie espresso machine while dressed like a hick. I was fairly confident he knew Gale and I *were* a couple, and the fact that he didn’t seem to mind layered the confusion even thicker. I’d grown so accustomed to stereotyping people for my safety that I forgot people aren't one-dimensional. It was a little comical when I thought about it. Of course, not every man who wears wife-beaters and listens to country is a threat. 

"Coffee?” Crass called out. “I know you’re awake.” 

I sighed. I was grateful that Crass had taken me in, but I was still humiliated to talk to him. I’d hoped to sneak out and never see him again, but he apparently woke up at 6:00 a.m. every morning. His back was turned when I walked into the kitchen. He was hunched over the stove, frying eggs in the same pan as a steak. He was now softly singing a country song I didn’t recognize. I took the coffee mug he left out for me and struggled with the espresso machine. It felt wrong for me to touch something so expensive while my knuckles and nailbeds were bloodied. 

“I cut up some watermelon,” Crass said, “ stuff does wonders for hangovers.” 

“I don’t like to eat in the morning,” I reply 

He raises an eyebrow at me. He sits down and gestures to the chair in front of him. I sit down and sip my coffee, trying not to look at him. 

“Can I ask you something?” Crass asks, snagging the Tupperware of watermelon from me. He doesn’t wait for me to answer, “Do you know Victoria?” 

“Andrew’s girl?” I clarify. I had seen her plenty; she was hard to miss. She had a stark black bob and looked more like a vampire than a person. I knew vaguely that she practiced some form of spiritualism. Some of the guys at the races called her a witch.

“So you do know her?” Crass ran a hand through his hair; I looked away as a few strands fell into his eyes. 

“I know *of* her.” I take another long sip of coffee. It burns the busted part of my lip. I try not to flinch at the pain. “She drives the black Ford RS200. One of the best racers this county has seen. Or so I’m told.” I add in the last part, painfully aware that I am still an outsider to the locals.

“That sounds like her.” Crass cut into his steak that looked like it could still moo. I bite back a wave of nausea. “We knew each other as kids.” 

"Oh yeah?” I ask. 

“She’s my stepsister.” 

I recall a vague memory of when I first moved to Belle County. Gale had told me of the controversy a decade back when the sheriff married a woman with a little girl. That baby must have been Victoria. Now that I thought about it I could see the resemblance between the two. They both had keen, honey-colored eyes and razor-sharp jawlines, traits that must have been inherited from their late mother. 

“Since you were in the scene, I figured you might know her, thats all.” Crass said, “I’ve been trying to get in touch with her for the better part of two years.” 

I pull at the scabs around my knuckles. Envelopes pop into my mind. My folks from Maine had sent hundreds of letters when I moved. I never opened any of them. They still come in the mail around christmas time, even eight years later, I refuse to forgive their senders. Each holiday, I send them through the papershredder. 

I had a suspicion that Victoria didn’t want Crass to contact her. However, I didn’t understand why. They may not share the same father, or believe in the same things, but Crass hadn’t given the impression of caring about either of those things. As if it read my mind, Crass began to speak again. 

“Never mind. Even if you did know her, and she was avoiding me, you wouldn’t tell me right.” 

I agree and Crass sighs. He looks at the sweater I’m wearing. “A woman's sweater doesn’t look half bad on you.” 

I nearly spit out my coffee. “Pardon?” 

Crass shakes his head. It pisses me off how cheerful he is when last night he was acting like a total jerk. “None of my stuff would fit you. It was my old roomates. She left it behind.” 

I ran into Crass’s now ex-roommate a few times. I never caught her name, but she was almost always in equestrian attire. Apparently, she did have normal people's clothes, such as pale blue sweaters. 

“You know,” Crass started, his voice flat, “Just throwing this out there: You’re out of a place to live and it’s hard to manage this whole place when I’m always gone. You could stay here, pay me, help me get back in touch with Victoria.” 

I felt my jaw go slack and I leaned forward. 

“You want me,” I pointed at myself and let out at a laugh laced with bitterness, “The guy who begged his way inside to bleed all over your pristine countertops, who you obviously think is a drunk, to live here?” 

Crass finished the rest of his breakfast, his fork scraping against the ceramic plate. He sighed into his hand.

“I said to *try* and not bleed on my countertops, not that you did.” His tone was dry, “And yeah, you were wasted last night, but that doesn’t mean I think you’re a permanent drunk. I’m not gonna blame you for having a bad night. A *really* bad night.” He corrected himself. “It’s not rocket science, I have a room. You need a room. We split expenses and nobody ends up sleeping in their car.” He paused before adding, “Unless you like sleeping in your car.” 

My stomach did a weird flip. I wasn’t sure if it was last night's alcohol or my desperate need to dig my heels into the ground and tell Crass off. But my mind flicks through the thought of a bed, shower, and fridge somewhere that isn’t Gale’s apartment. 

“And this isn’t because you just feel bad for me?” I cave.

“Do you really think I’d feel bad for a man who insulted my character? This isn’t charity work either, it’s a way for me to shovel some cash into savings and a way for you not to be homeless. Win-win.” He mused. “Unless you have some rich aunt to go and live with.” 

I imagined my parents' faces if they knew I was contemplating living with a male deputy in rural Louisiana. “No rich aunts… Just Gale.” His name tasted like rot in my mouth. 

“Right.” Crass drew out the word, “I figured. So do I need to set up a *For Rent* sign?” 

“We need to set up some ground rules,” I say. 

“Oh yeah? Like what?” 

“Next time I come home with a bloody nose, you cannot lecture me about getting it on your counters. They will be *our* counters. And,” I pause, looking around, “we listen to something other than Randy Travis.” 

“Deal. But I make no promises on the radio.” I saw lips turn into something almost resembling a smirk underneath his stubble. “You can have the radio when I’m gone.” 

I watched as he gestured to a calendar on the fridge. The sardine-packed, neat handwriting in each column would make you think it was his itinerary for the whole year, but upon closer inspection, it was just for this week. 

“You plan your bathroom breaks?” I raised an eyebrow, “So I can play music in the morning from 6:15 to 6:20 five days a week?” 

“If I’m gone, I suppose so. I’ll warn you, I am usually done by 6:17.” 

“Don't you stress yourself out with an itinerary for every moment of your day? I think they have medications for whatever you're doing.” 

“Don’t push it. I still have that *For Rent* sign.” He cocked his head at me, “And I plan for peace of mind. I always know what's coming next.” 

I shook my head. It was ridiculous, but its unanimity felt especially appealing after yesterday's uncertainty. At least with Crass, I wouldn’t have to worry about him disappearing for days on end, or forgetting rent. It felt too good to be true. Did Crass really want nothing from him other than rent? 

“What about Victoria?” I ask. 	

“Don’t worry about her.” Crass replied, “But, if you run into her… *Please* tell her I need to speak with her.” 

There was a real reason behind this. Being a pawn in Crass’s game to reunite with his estranged sister wasn’t the worst thing I could be a part of. God knows I’d gone through worse. 

…

My pile of clothes sat juxtaposed to the rest of Crass’s apartment. What Gale hadn’t destroyed was lazily thrown around. Watching Crass fruitlessly try to organize things between hauls, I felt a little bad. The two of us took three trips to transfer all my stuff across the lawn. It made me remember how much I left behind in Maine. While living with Gale, I never even tried to rebuild my belongings.

“You had a nice record collection in the bedroom,” Crass said as he set down my nightstand. 

“They were all Gales,” I reply. 

“No shit. There had to be at least a hundred of them.” 

I scoff at the irony of it all. Gale never liked it when I bought materialistic things, but his record collection was fine. He didn’t even listen to half of the musicians. 

“You should see his baseball card collection.” My voice is dry. It hurts to think of Gale’s things. They all remind me of him, or who I thought he was. 

When Crass was done excessively wiping his hands down with a pocket sanitizer, something I tried not to take offense to, he slapped his hands on his knees. 

“Welp. I should leave you to it.” He pointed to a door down the kitchen's hallway. " That’s your room. I’m going to use the rest of my day off to run some errands. God knows I’m already two hours behind.” 

It was only 8:00 a.m., and I already felt like I had lived two lifetimes. I scooped up my pile of clothes in one swift motion before walking down the hall and promptly tossing them to the floor. I dug out a pair of sheets and draped them over the bed. I brought them from Maine, and while living with Gale, I hadn’t used them since. I knew I needed to take a shower badly. My hair had been in the same bun for the last twenty-four hours, and I could feel it sticking to my neck. I had to remind myself that it was okay to snoop around for towels when I lived here now. Besides, Crass would probably be more upset if I got his bathroom floors wet than if I poked around a few storage closets. I eventually found them, half expecting them to be folded into swans; they were not. I grabbed three, hoping that wasn’t too greedy of me. I laid one out on the floor, one for my body, and the other for my hair. 

I stripped down in the tiny bathroom. The lighting was soft with a yellow glow, but didn’t hide all the black and blue. I try to run fingers through the sweat-stained hair around my collarbones. I leaned into the mirror and ran a shaking hand across the bruise blossoming on my nose. Gale fist did this. But the real damage wasn’t physical. I ran the sink, and like the water, I felt eight years of my life go down the drain. I scanned myself up and down. I flipped through every moment Gale and I had spent together. What caused it? Was it when I poked fun at his card collection, or picked a fight over his spending habits? I loved Gale fiercely. I told him everything. I always assumed he would come to me if he ever had doubts. I heard Gale in my head. “I slept with Andrew.” There wasn’t even a flicker of remorse when he said it. It was like a punch to the gut, then again, Andrew’s death had felt just as sudden. Everything was hitting me hard this morning. 

I didn’t recognize myself in the mirror. I always had a rough idea of where life would take *us*. But now, the man who stared back was clueless to what a future without Gale looked like.
