Red hats, lavender boas, I used to do that. Can't really get to do that anymore. Just stay here, and it's this day, and they won't turn up the television. I keep asking, but they just walk right past me.

Oliver hasn't come in to see me for awhile. The youth council kids stop in and give me a card. It's a nice card.

(Later, that's the same card I used as the Third Talisman. The squiggles in crayon contained powerful emotions, kindness and innocence and concern, and it was enough to unravel that particular gate. I don't know if I'll have time to explain that part. I'm getting tired.)

It started when I was thinking about how I used to wear a pink hat and a lavender boa on my birthday. I was never called a queen, at least not to my own face. I called some of the ladies queens, sometimes. We didn't use those terms in front of anyone else, who wasn't with us when we were laughing about it. You've got to be there, in the moment, to get a joke like that. I can't tell any of those jokes, now, that's why.

Might seem irrelevant, but please be patient. I'm not good at this, and I don't like to complain, but every keystroke I do hurts my wrists and I have to stop, so I'm really trying. I wish Oliver would come and fix my Dragon microphone so I can just talk into the screen. That works a lot better.

Thank you, Oliver, it's working now.

It started when I was considering the implications of being socially isolated. My health has started to deteriorate, and I wanted to tell everyone what has happened. I've seen it, and I am still here, they didn't take me with them. I don't know why, but I think if I could tell my story, somewhere, there will be an answer why they wouldn't take me.

I could feel their intentions, the ones who I wasn't afraid of. They just wanted to help.

The challenge of explaining what has happened, what I've seen, is that it sounds insane. Not because of what I have seen, or what has happened, but because it did not happen in a way that is sequential.

It is like an ouroboros. A time loop. I'm sure you know what those are, but it was also unlike those things, those are just examples of the strangeness I have survived. It was quite horrifying, but I remain to tell my story, even if I am not very good at it.

I am reluctant to begin with the moment of terror, but that is somewhat the beginning. From my own thoughts I realized that I was not alone, in being socially isolated. Everyone I was looking at was also, and it was like I had begun to get tolerant to the drugs. I've always liked me some drugs.

Drugs are good.

I was definitely on drugs, I'd realized. I was sitting there in a wheelchair, the television practically muted, and I was in some kind of underground facility. That was what I became aware of.

My Fur Talisman. No, I said 'First', oh shit, nevermind. Erase 'shit'. I thought he fixed this thing.

Whatever.

My Fist Talisman. First, was the joy, the laughter, the sisterhood I was daydreaming of as a space cadet, totally subdued. The gate led me to myself. I was cognizant, somewhat, and managed to remove the drug feed in my arm. After a few hours off the drip, I was able to groggily move myself around, and became more aware of everything, taking note of those first thoughts I'd have to remember, because I couldn't remember anything else. Just a memory of a memory I had daydreamed about. That's all I knew.

I had to get out of the endless loop. I had to break the cycle.

Somehow, I knew that I'd just end up back in my room. That was the second gate. But I was terrified of its guardian.

Whitehead.

There is a creature in the hallway known as Whitehead. The ones who just wanted to help arrived and warned me. I was not hallucinating them. They branded their mark on my face, burned it into me. I screamed because it hurt so bad.

"We are only trying to help." the ones who wanted to be helpful said. They were almost silent. They were tall and thin and had blood red eyes and skin as white as snow. Each wore a black crown of thorns. I was not afraid of these, even though they had hurt me when they marked me on my face.

"Would one of you push me?" I asked, still wincing. I could smell the burnt skin on the brand.

"Anything to be helpful." They said in whispering voices. It took the strength of all of them combined to push me forward, in my wheelchair.

I was scared, but relied on their mark to get me past Whitehead. I closed my eyes and didn't look at the monster, but I felt its heat near me, its hot breath and stankiness in the air. That was the Second Talisman.

Once we were safe in my room, I called Oliver. He didn't answer. I still needed my Dragon microphone fixed, and I was going to have to start writing down my adventure one key at a time. It really did hurt a lot, to write the beginning.

Maybe I do like complaining. Ha Ha ha.

That is when the creatures explained what I needed to do to escape. They told me about the Five Talismans and gates, and warned me it was going to be horrifying beyond all possible reason. This was the only way I was getting out alive.

While I began to work on this, the creatures went room to room throughout the entire facility and collected everyone else. They took them all, and left me here.

That is when Whitehead went berserk and killed all those people who kept walking past us and wouldn't turn up the television. Whitehead was running up and down the hallways and I could hear people screaming and being torn apart. I was shaking with fear, I was horrified and terrified.

I did hallucinate briefly, my mind conjuring a daydream so I wouldn't go mad with fear. I thought I was being hunted by Chester Cheetah, saying "Unleash the hounds" and a bunch of Italian brain rot characters came running out led by the Jolly Green Giant. When I'd calmed down, I just sat there in ordinary terror as the horrible massacre continued.

Several times the creature came to my door. I closed my eyes, but I could smell the blood all over it. It looked at me, and I didn't look back. It saw my mark, the one left by the kind and tall creatures. then it would resume the hunting of those who were not taken, not the people in the wheelchairs with the drugs in their arms, but the other people. I guess they were workers in the facility, but I never saw them do anything but walk around.

I do not know what happened to the third gate. I've got the card from the youth ministry that visited. That's the Third Talisman. I should make a note of that, since I've had this one the whole time. I think there's some way to edit this thing.

Now I must face the fourth gate and I have no idea where I will find the Fourth Talisman. The fourth gate is guarded by something so awful, so indescribably grotesque, so twisted and warped, so obscenely ferocious, that my terror is absolute. I cannot even think about it any further, and I must, for I must pass that thing, and somehow survive.

I am too afraid to continue, why did they choose me?

Oh, right. It is because I could see them and hear them, so they were able to instruct me on what to do. This doesn't really seem fair. I'm going to call Oliver.

He never answers. I wonder why we even have phones in the first place. It seems like they just gave us phones to mess with us. I know I saw a some of the people sitting by their phones, instead of watching the practically muted television.

I took a nice break from all this horrible stuff. I found the remote and managed to get out of my wheelchair and pick it up. I am getting my strength back. I can remember some stuff, although I don't know I am remembering things. I just sorta do think about things and know certain things, but I can't really get my brain to focus on ordinary details about my life or who I am or where I'm from.

Oliver stopped by today. I've disrupted the time loop I mentioned. I tried to explain how things don't happen in the order they should logically happen in. This fact is very frightening, but it helps to be keeping a written record of what is happening. Oliver took a look at it and said that it's really cool I'm writing a horror story about being here. He says it needs work, because it isn't coherent enough for anyone to read. I asked him if he'd get it to the newspapers if anything should happen to me and he said he'd do that. I told him not to change anything and he promised he wouldn't. I didn't tell him this is all a true story, because I didn't want to scare the shit out of him.

I hid the Avolesene Sign from him under a big square bandage. Whitehead had licked up every single drop of blood, sucking it out of the carpets and peeling it off the walls with that nasty tongue. The place was perfectly clean when Oliver came to visit.

He did notice, though, that all the rooms were empty. He did notice that there were no more 'workers' anywhere. He asked me what was going on, said he couldn't find anyone and that it was spooky. Then, creeped out, despite my best efforts to protect him from the living hell nightmare fuel facility of mutilation horror shows, he left shaking.

All alone, I removed the bandage, before I could forget. If Whitehead didn't see the mark, I'd be torn to pieces, devoured and my blood would be licked out of the cracks between the furniture. That's what Whitehead did to the so-called workers.

So, for a moment, I felt kinda charged up, and I went for a walk, out of the wheelchair. I am definitely getting my strength back. Fear does wonders to the body.

I live in constant terror now of the guardian of the fourth gate. Last night, while I was resting, although I barely sleep, and I am becoming very hungry, since I cannot find any food, that's when it happened.

The guardian came up from below, slithering and pulling and snapping. It writhed over Whitehead, who looked kinda like a mixture between a dog, a man and something reptilian, and had a head as white as the Avolesenes. Whitehead served no further purpose, except as food for the next guardian, who must be as hungry as I am, I guessed.

I shrieked in terror, at the sight of Whitehead being ripped apart and eaten by so many mouths in such a horrible way. I was terrified I'd be next. That is when I realized my body wasn't the only thing growing stronger. My mind was also getting sharper, because I caught on that I wouldn't need the Fourth Talisman.

I reached the fourth gate with the Third Talisman, skipping a gate, sure. Not using the right talisman, why not? I held up the card against the freakish embodiment of carnal cruelty. The gate followed the path of the crayon drawings, erasing as they were put upon the paper, the magic unravelling the seal of sinister evil.

I was too scared to go through, although on the other side, freedom. I can see I am there, in the past, sitting with my club, with my girls, we are laughing and drinking tea and teasing each other and it is all joy. I'd go through, but it isn't my time.

It was the Mosaic of Madness. It was insane, while I was not. It shifted form, ever changing, trying to show me whatever I would see to get me to step inside. I knew the monster would wake up as soon as I did, and come after me.

The Mosaic of Madness was the creation of nightmares, trying to take away my mind, and it was the cause of my deteriorating health. Now that I knew what it was, I had begun to recover my strength of mind and body, I was almost free.

The Mosaic of Madness was the tiles on the floor of the waiting room, that's what it wanted you to think. It is a sentient pattern, a thing that hates the living, and wars upon the sane. It is a mathematical inevitability, that it would spontaneously come into our reality. A number from another dimension where numbers were colors, and colors were gods. It might be impossible for you to understand. You must pass through a gate before you can comprehend what it means to do so.

Sooner or later, everyone does. That is why all must know what is waiting in-between this place and that on the other side of the first gate.

The Mosaic of Madness saw me seeing it, and unleashed those monsters to try to stop me. If I could go through the gates, I could escape the time loop. I needed to cause sequence where it had lost all meaning. I had to reason with the impossible pattern, the Mosaic of Madness.

Instead, I bowed to it, knowing it could never be defeated, never removed. It hadn't won, but my fear had, at least in that moment. I needed to get myself together, the dread of that precipice being too much to overcome.

I limped back to my room in defeat. I am too afraid. I am a coward. I had it all worked out, I'd tricked the system, gotten past the monsters when I realized I had an opportunity, I'd done it. It wasn't enough, the fear of going through that gate, stealing through it, cheating the awfulness I've endured, I was too scared.

Maybe tomorrow I will go through. The Fourth Guardian is a bloated mess, seething in the hallway. I'll have to sneak past it, and go back down there, below, where the gate is still open.

I can hear some of the laughter, even up here in my room. I know what it showed me isn't what's on the other side. I know it will be a place of the living, a taste of freedom, and that is all. I will be hunted until I can reach the final gate. I am most afraid.

I looked at the Avolesene Sign on my face, in the mirror. It has healed up somewhat. I don't have time to edit this whole thing, and I don't think there's anything to change.

While I was looking in the mirror, I remembered everything. I'm not a prisoner, I'm a guest. I think that I will get some rest, now that the fear is starting to subside. Knowing who I was before, having my head clear, I can give certainty that this is all true, although I cannot explain any of it any better than I have.

Oliver will be fine, that monster will follow me into the gate, and I will have to hide among the living. It won't find me, I am quite cunning, and I will escape. At least that is what I hope will happen, I realize it's not really a plan. He's going to give this to the newspapers, so that everyone will know what happened here.

I'm super tired, so I'll head out after I rest for a little while.
