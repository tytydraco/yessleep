The void was an endless, featureless expanse. No sound, no touch, no smell. The silence was absolute, oppressive, wrapping around me like a shroud. It felt as if I were floating in a sea of nothingness, adrift and utterly alone. Panic began to set in, my breaths coming in rapid, shallow gasps, though I couldn't feel the air moving in or out of my lungs.

My vision was the only sense left to me, but there was nothing to see. Just a vast, empty bright blackness stretching infinitely in all directions. It was disorienting, a nauseating sensation of being nowhere and everywhere all at once. I tried to scream, but no sound emerged from my lips. My voice, my existence, was lost to this place.

Then, from the depths of the darkness, they came. The eaters. Shadowy figures, writhing and shifting, their forms indistinct and ever-changing. They moved with a terrifying, deliberate grace, closing in on me from all sides. My heart pounded in my chest, a futile attempt to escape the inevitable.

The first touch was cold, like ice spreading through my veins. Their tendrils wrapped around my limbs, pulling me all directions. I struggled, thrashing against their grip, but it was like fighting against water—ineffectual and hopeless. They swarmed over me, and I could feel their presence leeching away my very essence.

Pain exploded through my body as they tore into me, rending flesh from bone with ravenous commitment. It was a silent agony, my screams absorbed by the void. I could feel myself being consumed, piece by piece, until there was nothing left but a hollow shell. The last thing I saw before everything went black was their beady, empty eyes, devouring my soul.

I awoke to a new kind of horror. I was naked, my arms were outstretched, nailed to a cold, white and gold marble wall. I was crucified, my body splayed out in a grotesque display. A large spike was also driven through my throat, pinning my head back against the wall. The pain was excruciating, a burning, suffocating agony.

Before me stood the gods. Incomprehensible beings, their forms shifting and indistinct, made of light and shadow and something beyond my understanding. They towered over me, their presence overwhelming, and I knew that I was in the presence of a power far greater than anything I could comprehend.

A wave of helplessness washed over me. Here, nailed to this unyielding surface, my existence seemed puny and insignificant. The vastness of these beings, their immense power, made my entire life feel like a mere speck in the grand tapestry of the universe. I was nothing compared to them, a fleeting thought in the mind of an eternal cosmos. My wish, my desperation, my regrets—all felt trivial under their gaze.

I had thought my wish was the end of my suffering, the undoing of my mistakes, but standing—no, hanging—before these gods, I realized how naive and foolish I had been. I was but an insect, trying to fathom the workings of a realm beyond my comprehension. The gods' forms shifted, blending into each other, their voices resonating with a power that made my bones vibrate.   One of the gods, a being of darkness with eyes like burning coals, looked down at me with disdain. Its form was harsh and angular, exuding an aura of judgment and finality. "He should die," it said, its voice a low, rumbling growl that echoed through the void. This was Ithuriel, the Judge, who saw the world in black and white, in absolutes. His realm was one of strict justice, devoid of mercy.

Another god, a trickster with a mischievous grin, stepped forward. Its form flickered and changed, never staying the same for more than a moment. "I granted his wish," it said, its voice lilting and mocking. "And I have more plans for him yet." This was Faelan, the Trickster, who reveled in chaos and unpredictability. His eyes sparkled with a mischievous light, always searching for the next piece of entertainment, the next game to play.

Two more gods, their forms intertwined like a dance of light and shadow, spoke in unison. "We respect the wish," they said, their voices harmonizing in a strange, otherworldly melody. This was Solara and Umbra, the Twin Aspects, representing balance and duality. Solara was radiant, her form glowing with a warm, golden light, embodying creation and life. Umbra, her counterpart, was a figure of darkness, a void that absorbed all light, embodying destruction and death. Together, they maintained the equilibrium of existence.

My mind raced, trying to grasp the enormity of what I was witnessing. These gods, these incomprehensible beings, were debating my fate as if I were a mere pawn in their cosmic game. The realization was crushing. My actions had rippled through the fabric of reality, drawing the attention of entities far beyond my understanding. I was a single thread in an infinite tapestry, pulled and twisted by forces I could never hope to control.

Faelan, the Trickster, stepped forward again, his grin widening. "Your wish has set things in motion," he said. "But know this, mortal—you are far from finished. Your story is just beginning, and the consequences of your actions will ripple through the fabric of reality."

Solara and Umbra, the Twin Aspects, moved closer, their presence a harmonious blend of light and shadow. "We will honor the wish," Solara said, her voice filled with warmth and compassion. "But be prepared for the journey ahead."

Umbra's voice followed, cold and unyielding. "For every action, there is a consequence. Balance must be maintained."

Ithuriel, the Judge, remained where he stood, his gaze still burning with contempt. "Do not squander this chance," he growled. "Redemption is earned, not given."

As I hung there, my mind teetering on the brink of madness, I couldn't help but reflect on my insignificance. The vast, unending expanse of the cosmos stretched out before me, and I was just a tiny, insignificant dot. Yet, somehow, my actions had drawn the attention of gods. The weight of that responsibility was almost too much to bear.

With that, the gods faded into the void, their forms dissolving into the darkness. The pain intensified, and I felt myself slipping away, my consciousness fading as the void claimed me once more.

And then, I woke up.

When I woke up, I found myself ensconced in the sterile confines of a hospital bed. My entire body ached with a dull, persistent pain, a physical echo of the turmoil within. The smell of antiseptics, sharp and clinical, filled my nostrils, mingling with the faint scent of clean linens. The rhythmic beeping of the monitors was the only sound, a monotonous reminder of my fragile existence.

I blinked, my eyes protesting against the harsh fluorescent lights overhead. They felt like interrogator's lamps, exposing my every flaw and insecurity. Each blink seemed to bring with it fragments of shattered memories, jigsaw pieces of a nightmarish puzzle that my mind struggled to piece together. The sterile white walls around me felt like the padded room of a madhouse, containing the fractured remnants of my sanity.

A nurse noticed my stirring and approached with a gentle smile, her expression one of practiced compassion. She was an oasis of calm in the chaos of my mind. "Good to see you're back with us," she said softly. Her voice was a soothing balm against the jagged edges of my thoughts. "You had quite a fall. How are you feeling?"

I tried to speak, but my throat was parched, and the words caught like sandpaper. She handed me a cup of water, and I drank slowly, the cool liquid a temporary reprieve from the desert of my mouth. It felt like an eternity before I could manage a raspy "Thank you," my voice barely more than a whisper, a ghost of its former self.

"You were found unconscious in the park," she explained, her eyes scanning my face for signs of recognition. "An EMT brought you in. Do you remember anything about what happened?"

My mind was a storm of confusion, memories swirling like leaves in a gale. The eater, the woman, her baby... The images flashed before me, stark and vivid, each one a dagger to my psyche. My heart raced, the monitor beside me quickening its beeps. "The baby... Is the baby okay?" The words tumbled out, thick with desperation.

The nurse's expression relaxed, a look of genuine concern. "The EMT who brought you in mentioned something about a baby. Both mother and child are fine. They were here briefly, but they left as soon as they were cleared. She said to thank you for trying to help."

Relief washed over me, a wave that both soothed and drowned me. But the memory of the baby's blood, flowing so profusely from its head after I tore the eater off, haunted me. How was that even possible? The eaters didn't leave physical marks—at least, that's what I had assumed. Yet, I had seen the crimson liquid, the innocent life seeping away, as the mother screamed in horror.

Had my desperate attempt to save the child somehow worsened the situation? I couldn't reconcile the image of the eaters, consuming reality itself, with the very tangible, very human blood I had witnessed. But the mom said the baby was fine? The disconnect gnawed at my mind, a puzzle piece that refused to fit.

The nurse's voice, a lifeline to the present, cut through my thoughts. She continued to speak, but her words were a blur. My focus was on the baby's face, the terror and confusion in its wide eyes. I had to understand what was happening, why these eaters were appearing, and how to stop them before more lives were upended.

"There's someone here to see you," she said, her tone shifting to something more serious. She gestured toward the door, her eyes betraying a hint of uncertainty.

A woman entered the room, her demeanor calm yet radiating an intensity that set me on edge. She moved with a quiet authority, each step measured, as if she were treading on sacred ground. She introduced herself as Emily, her voice a smooth blend of empathy and urgency.

"Mr. Lawson," she began, pulling up a chair beside my bed. She leaned in slightly, her eyes locking onto mine with a piercing gaze that seemed to see through the layers of my soul. "We need to talk about what you saw in the park."

A chill ran down my spine. "What do you mean?"

"We've been monitoring unusual occurrences like the one you experienced," she said, her tone matter-of-fact yet tinged with a gravity that made my pulse quicken. "The entities you encountered are what we call 'Voidling Recyclers.' As far as we can tell, they're disruptions in reality, drawn to consume and undo existence itself."

Voidling Recyclers. The term bounced around in my mind until the pieces clicked into place. "You mean the eaters," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. Emily's eyebrows raised slightly at my term, but she nodded.

"Yes, that fits," she said. "Eaters. They're the result of some tear in the fabric of reality, something powerful enough to disrupt the natural order." Emily sighed, running a hand through her hair, a gesture that spoke of weariness and burden. "We're still trying to understand the full scope of the situation. But from what we gather, these “eaters” seem drawn to areas of quantum diminution. They are the muscle that breaks down the door, so to speak"

A cold dread settled in my stomach. She didn't know that it was my wish that had caused all this. I had to keep that buried for now. "So, what do we do?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

Emily's expression softened. "We need to find a way to seal these tears, to stop the eaters from consuming more of our reality. But we need your help, Mr. Lawson. You have a unique connection to these entities. You might be the key to stopping them."

Her words hung in the air, puncturing the silence with the inclined responsibility. I had unleashed this nightmare; it was my fault. But could I actually make a difference and fix this? My wish is gone. "What makes you think I'm able to help you?" I asked, needing more convincing.

Emily reached into her bag and pulled out a tablet, quickly navigating to a series of charts and graphs. "We've been collecting data from the park where you were found," she explained, handing the tablet to me. "These readings show an anomaly centered on your location."

I stared at the screen, trying to make sense of the data. The graphs showed a series of spikes in several different colors. "What exactly am I looking at?"   "This is a quantum resonance scan," Emily said, her tone professional and precise. "It measures fluctuations in the fabric of reality. Most of the readings we get are relatively stable, but here," she pointed to a particularly sharp spike, "we see a significant disturbance. It's unlike anything we've recorded before."

"And this," she continued, swiping to another screen, "is an energy dispersion map. It shows the spread of the disturbance. Notice how it's all focused around you, Mr. Lawson. When the eaters appeared, you were at the epicenter of the disruption."

I took a deep breath, absorbing the information. The data was undeniable. Whatever had happened in the park, I was at the center of it. "So, what does this mean?"

"It means," Emily said, her voice gentle but firm, "that you have a unique signature that these entities are drawn to. Your presence somehow affects the fabric of reality in a way we've never seen before. If we can understand why, we might be able to use that knowledge to seal the tears ourselves and stop the eaters."

Her explanation was clear, and it left little room for doubt. And the data was compelling. "What do I need to do?" I asked, readying myself for the daunting path ahead.

Emily stood, extending her hand, a gesture of solidarity and resolve. "First, we need to get you discharged from the hospital. After that, we'll explain everything. Together, we'll find a way to fix this."

Emily helped me gather my things and guided me through the discharge process. The paperwork was a blur, my mind racing with what lay ahead. Nurses and doctors bustled around, giving me instructions and well-wishes that barely registered. My focus was on Emily and the urgency in her eyes.

>*I don't feel that it is necessary to know exactly what I am. The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning.*  
*-Michel Foucault*

Once I was discharged, Emily led me through a series of sterile hallways, each one seeming to blend into the next. The hospital’s antiseptic smell was pervasive, a reminder of the fragile line between life and death. Finally, we reached a small conference room filled with monitors, charts, and several other individuals who looked up as we entered.

"This is Michael Lawson," Emily announced. "He encountered the entities firsthand."

A man in a lab coat stepped forward, extending a hand. "Dr. Reynolds. We’ve been analyzing the data from recent events. Your experience might provide the insight we need."

I shook his hand, feeling everyone's expectations pressing down on me. "I'll do whatever I can to help." I said quietly, feeling a little overwhelmed.

Dr. Reynolds nodded, then turned to a large screen displaying a chaotic array of data points and video footage. "These are the voids, the areas where reality has been compromised. The... entities are drawn to these spots, feeding on the instability."

"Michael calls them 'eaters'," Emily interjected.

Dr. Reynolds raised an eyebrow, glancing between Emily and me. "Eaters? That term implies consumption. Are we sure that's accurate?"

Emily nodded. "Given what we've observed and Michael's firsthand account, it fits. These beings consume the very fabric of reality."

Reynolds considered this for a moment, then nodded. "Alright. Eaters it is. Now, let's focus on understanding them better." He pointed to a cluster of red dots on the map. "These are the latest incidents. They’re increasing in frequency and intensity. We need to understand why."

I swallowed hard, "And you think I can help because I saw them up close?"

"Not just that," Dr. Reynolds replied, his eyes intense. "There's something about your interaction with them. We need to understand that connection."

As I studied the map, a thought occurred to me. "What if... what if we could trace the origin of these tears? Find the source and stop it there?"

Emily and Dr. Reynolds exchanged a glance. "We’ve considered that," Emily said slowly. "But finding the exact source is like finding a needle in a haystack."

I took a deep breath, knowing that my next words could reveal too much. "I think I might know where to start."

Their eyes fixed on me. "Where?" Dr. Reynolds asked.

I hesitated, then pointed to a spot on the map near where the mistake was made, where my wish had been born. "Here. This area. It's where I first felt... something was wrong."

Emily studied the map, then nodded. "It's worth a shot. We need to move quickly before more damage is done."

Emily and Dr. Reynolds gathered their equipment and essential personnel. The atmosphere was tense, filled with a palpable urgency. I followed them out of the hospital, the bright sunlight a stark contrast to the sterile environment I had just left behind.

We drove in silence as Emily navigated the streets, her eyes fixed firmly on the road ahead. Dr. Reynolds reviewed data on a tablet, occasionally glancing at me as if trying to piece together my connection to the eaters.

Finally, we arrived at the location I had indicated. It was an unassuming stretch of road, now eerily quiet.

Emily and Dr. Reynolds began setting up their equipment, scanning the area for any signs of instability. I watched them work, my mind racing with the implications of what we might find.

"Michael," Emily called out, pulling me from my thoughts. "We need you to stand up there. If there's any residual connection, it might help us pinpoint the source."

I nodded and moved to the spot she indicated on the rocky outcropping. As I stood there, the air seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy. The ground beneath my feet felt unsteady, as if reality itself was shifting. The sensation was unnerving and made me feel sick.

Dr. Reynolds monitored the readings, his expression growing more intense. "We're getting something," he said, his voice tinged with excitement. "A unique tear is here, but it's faint. We need to amplify it."

Emily adjusted the equipment, her eyes never leaving the screens. "Michael, try to focus on what you felt that day. Try to remember everything."

I closed my eyes, the memories rushing back with a visceral clarity. The accident, the desperation, the wish. I could feel that reality again, a burden I could never escape.

The ground trembled beneath me, and the air grew colder. The hum intensified, and I felt a strange pull, as if something was drawing me in. I opened my eyes, and the world around me seemed to shimmer, the edges of my vision began blurring.

"We're close," Dr. Reynolds said, his voice barely audible over the rising noise. "Just a little more."

I focused harder, the images of that fateful day playing over and over in my mind. The wish, the regret, the moment everything changed. The pull grew stronger, and I felt myself teetering on the edge of something vast and incomprehensible.

Suddenly, the equipment erupted with a burst of energy, and a rift appeared before us. It was a swirling vortex of darkness. The eaters emerged, their forms shifting and writhing, drawn to the instability.

Emily and Dr. Reynolds sprang into action, using their equipment to contain the rift. I watched in awe and horror as they battled to seal the tear, the eaters pushing against their efforts with relentless force.

"Michael!" Emily shouted, her voice cutting through the chaos. "We need your help. Just focus on closing the rift."

I nodded, stepping forward, but doubt sat deep in my bones. What if I couldn't do it? What if my actions only made things worse? The connection between me and the rift was palpable, a bond forged in desperation and regret. Is that enough? Am I?  I reached out, my hands trembling, my mind filled with uncertainty.

I turned to Emily, desperation in my eyes. "Tell me how to close it. What do I do?"   Emily's face reflected my own uncertainty. "I don't know, Michael. You're the first to ever try this. We don't have a precedent for closing a rift. You have to trust yourself."   Her words hung in the air, offering little solace.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my racing heart, and noticed the smells of cinnamon and chlorine. I closed my eyes, visualizing the cliffs edge, the storm, the desperate wish, the surge of regret that followed. The memories were sharp and clear, the pain as fresh as if it had just happened.

The ground beneath me trembled, the air around me humming with energy. I began to feel insignificant again, like I was pinned, nude and exposed, in front of the Gods again. "I can't do this alone," I whispered, the fear creeping into my voice.

As I stood there, fighting the rising tide of panic, my thoughts shifted to my wife, Anna. Her smile, so bright and full of life, the way she used to laugh at the smallest things, a sound that could chase away any shadow. She had a habit of humming when she cooked, a soft, soothing melody that filled our home with warmth. I remembered how she would always find a way to make even the most mundane moments feel special—like turning a rainy day into an excuse for a cozy indoor picnic.

Her untimely death had shattered my world. She was gone too soon, leaving behind an emptiness that I tried to fill with that fateful wish. I wished to undo everything, thinking it would bring back the happiness we once had. But instead, it had torn reality apart, creating these monstrous entities.

 Anna had always believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself. She would have known what to do. She had a way of making me feel like I could overcome any obstacle, no matter how insurmountable it seemed. Her strength and unwavering support were my anchor, and without her, I felt adrift.

The memory of her touch, the way she would gently place her hand on my shoulder when I was troubled, gave me a surge of strength. I could almost hear her voice, whispering words of encouragement, telling me that I could do this. I had to do this—for her, for the world that still had a chance to be saved.

>*Madness is the purest, most total form of revolution.*  
*-* *Michel Foucault*

 The connection between me and the rift grew stronger, and as I stood now in front of it, I visualized the rift closing and listened. It was slow at first, but it began to shut like a zipper. Once it became narrow enough, I outstretched my arms and grabbed onto the edges of the void. It was like holding slime for just a moment, then it reacted to my touch with a small pop. It was a weirdly crisp crack, and then I was missing the flesh below my pinky on my right palm.

At first, I thought I had been turned into a bleeder as I continued to close the rift, seeing the large amounts of blood, but not feel anything. It was only moments later that the receptors noticed something was wrong and then sent the cease fire signal to my brain to make me stop whatever I was doing. A wave of blinding pain washed over me, and I screamed out in retaliation. I had actually lost that part of my hand. The pain was surreal. My pinky loosely curled in towards the palm as no tendons were connected anymore. My wrist and forearm felt like they were on fire as I struggled to keep my grip on the rift.

I then felt a surge of energy flow through me, guided by The memories of Anna and their presence. Together, we pushed against the void, willing it to close. Slowly, the rift began to shrink again, the eaters' resistance weakening. Emily and Dr. Reynolds intensified their efforts, their equipment crackling with power. Together, we forced the void to close.

With a final sizzling crack, the rift snapped shut, and the eaters vanished. The air grew still, and the ground beneath my feet solidified. We stood there, breathing heavily.

Emily turned to me, hand on her knees as she caught her breath. "We did it," she said, her voice barely more than a whisper. Dr. Reynolds checked over his equipment, and then hastily began to scribble in his notebook   I nodded, what we had just achieved slowly sinking in. We had closed the rift. That was it! We were done! Reality saved!

If this story had a happy ending, that would have been it. Sorry, but that isn’t reality.

A slow clap resonated through the air, and a strange buzzing shook my eyes. The clapping was coming from the van.

I spun around and met a gaze with vorpal eyes and a mischievous grin.
