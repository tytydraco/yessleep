My name is Oliver, I’m in 9th grade. Me and my family just moved to one of those manufactured homes with the crawl space under it. The first day I was there I already picked up on something or someone watching me. The entrance to my house is a set of old wooden stairs with a ramp going down the left side. Inside of my house all of the floors were a dingy carpet, until it was replaced by tile at my kitchen and back door(which was a sliding glass door). Then in the living room it was dingy carpet again. 

The first couple of weeks we were moving and it was good, but at night it got dark. With where my house is and the layout in general I would always joke about it being the best place for a horror movie, I mean we bordered a forest, we lived at the end of a dirt path, and we had a big long back yard. 

One night when I was letting out my three dogs, (two of them were huskies and the other was a mutt) I heard a weird noise coming from the forest. The forest bordes the left, front, and backside of my house, but the left were my neighbors. I looked into the darkness and saw something move, it was almost human-like, but it just couldn’t be, it was too…unnatural. I quickly called my dogs inside but one of them was staring out into the forest. I went to go get her and out of curiosity I looked to see what she was looking at, and there I saw it: it was this huge black figure, its legs were long and spindly, like toothpicks. Its body was like a deer’s but if it was drenched in black ink, its face…or lack of is what I remember the most. No eyes, no ears, no nose, but it had a mouth. A mouth with razor sharp teeth. It stared at me and smiled, its teeth glinting from the light of my back porch, then it dashed off. 

I grabbed my dog and got her inside, gave them their treats and slid shut my back door. I told my parents and they didn’t believe me because I had a history of telling lies. 

In the mornings I wake up early so I can wake up, get ready for school and then have an hour to do whatever. One day when I woke up, I heard a tapping at my window. At first I thought it was in my head, so I checked my phone and it was 4:08. Then I heard the taps again, but they were more aggressive so I finally looked out my window and there it was staring right at me. It's a blank face that I could now see because of the light from my room. Its face was like the rest of its body, black as ink and long, but its mouth still smiled, and it dashed off again. I’m still terrified, I have no idea what to do, I’ll continue to update.
