In the weeks that followed, Henri taught me more about The Winter House—so called by its tenants for the perpetual season it resided in.

Lacking insulation, it was always cold within the walls. And, as I learned with any discomfort there, the only respite could be found on the table in my room. Hunger, thirst, tiredness, cold, boredom, depression, fear, even arousal—alcohol was all The House lent for me to cope. For Henri, it was the needle—for Bo pills.

The human body behaved differently within its confines than it did in the outside world. One could not starve there, or dehydrate, though the sensations of needing food or drink would become overpowering if you tried to stop consuming your vice. And it was not possible to overdose, but rather overindulgence would merely bring a brief, restless sleep—carrying with it only nightmares and painful memories.

All residents, male and female, found themselves impotent there—not that desire was removed, it could just only be managed with narcotics or drink. And while we were not discouraged from interacting with one another or leaving our rooms—we free to converse and roam as we pleased—I quickly learned that addicts made poor conversationalists, and there was no more to The House to discover beyond the dining room, sitting room, and our bedrooms.

No kitchen, no library with books, or living room with television—one afternoon, I asked Henri why The House even bothered with the dining table we were sitting at being we didn’t need to eat, or a couch being we had no entertainment to enjoy on it.

“Reminders.” He told me.

“Reminders of what?” I responded.

“Of the lives we left behind. Of a meal with family—of a movie night with a lover. The House is clever… If it just trapped us, alone in our rooms, and forced us to use all day and night, no one would last more than a few weeks here. But it lets us talk—it lets us come downstairs and see a sunrise—sit at the table and imagine being back in our own homes, at our own tables. And in doing so, it lets us keep a fraction of hope alive—a sliver of a dream that we’ll make it out of here someday—allowing it to savor its meals for longer.” He paused.

“But no one can hold out indefinitely. The door will return soon—I do not think Bo will last much longer. He cared for Alice—he was not the same after she… left…” He dropped his face into his hands and said the last few words through his fingers.

Bo had not emerged since I’d arrived at The House nearly four weeks earlier. I’d initially surmised that Henri had made him up having been driven mad by his three-month stay there consuming nothing but heroin. But sometimes, at night, I’d hear movement from Bo’s room, or a moan of anguish, confirming his reality.

“The door will return?” I asked.

“Yes, once an invitation has been sent, the door will materialize. But an invitation cannot be sent until a room has opened.” His voice faltered slightly near the end.

“And… how does a room open…?” I pressed.

“I told you on your first day here. You will not leave here alive.” He shrugged.

“So, I’ll just keep drinking until the alcohol finally kills me?” The House had chosen well if that was its goal given I’d already decided to do that the night that it invited me in.

“No…” He stood from the chair and walked towards one of the front windows before continuing. “No, it will not let your vice take you quietly—your body will not eventually just give up, nor will you be able to overdose, as you're aware already.

"Your body will rot from the inside, and you will feel pain—unbearable pain—but you will not die.”

“So, you’re saying…” I believed I knew where he was going, but wasn’t ready to speak it aloud myself.

“Yes, if you want this to end—if you want to leave here, you will have to end things yourself. Violently—painfully. It knows that you want to die, that’s why it brought you here. It knows that you’d given up on fighting your addiction and were just going to passively drink yourself to death—that’s why it targeted you. It’s why it targeted me, and Bo, and Alice, and the hundreds of others that occupied all of our rooms before us.

“We are its favorite meal—those so unwilling to seek help or feel our pain that we’d rather mask it until we simply expire. If our addiction is its dinner—our suffering its seasoning—then our deaths are its dessert. You will find that one day, when you begin to wish to die more than to live, The House will change—it won’t send your wife to put a glass in your hand—it’ll send her to hang a noose.”  Tears were welling in his eyes.

“Bo warned me it would happen—Alice had been looking worse and worse for weeks; her skin and eyes yellowed. She said her son had been telling her that it was time, and then one day she stopped coming out of her room and… we heard… something kicked over… choking… gagging… silence… and… and… Christ I can’t…” He wiped his face with his soiled shirt.

“Overnight, the door formed—I tried to open it of course, but it was locked—it needed a key...” He finished.

I was feeling sick to my stomach—something I knew I could easily fix by heading back to my room, but I wanted to know more. So, I asked, “what do you mean, it needed a key?”

“You will see soon… I… do not think my description would do it justice.” And with that, he headed back up the stairs to shoot up.

Henri refused to say more on the subject when I inquired further, but I did not need to wait long for answers. It was just a couple nights later when I was laying in my bed and powering through enough whiskey to knock myself out for a few hours, that I heard the same sounds Henri had described from Alice’s demise coming from Bo’s room.

Someone climbing on top of something... a chair being kicked over... choking...

I tried to block it out—even covered my ears with my pillow, but it forced me to listen—to hear every agonizing gurgle of Bo’s final moments—to foreshadow what it had planned for me. Somehow amplifying every excruciating detail directly into my brain.

Yet, as traumatic as it was to eavesdrop on another man hanging himself, Henri had not prepared me for the noises that would soon permeate the walls.

Maybe it had been too horrible for him to wish to recount.

First, it was the door at the end of the hallway bursting open—followed by the heavy clunks of The Warden moving towards Bo’s door.

And finally the sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor—being dragged back to its lair...

Then…

Squelching.

Crunching.

Chewing.

Again, I tried to obscure the sounds, but it was no use. So, as I’d been trained to do, I reached for my glass only to find that, for the first time, it was empty. The House was not going to give me anything to dull the moment, and I knew it had done the same to Henri when I heard his anguished screams blending with the chorus of consumption. I considered running from my room, but was too terrified of what I’d see as I had not heard The Warden’s door close behind it.

There was nothing I could do but wait. Wait, and shake, and cry, and vomit.

The House relished in its dessert—relished in every second of our combined despair.

Until silence fell again.

A weight pressed down on the bed beside me, and I turned to see Sherry holding the glass in her hand—topped mercifully with salvation.

“Shhh, it’s okay baby—you can have this now.” She purred.

I hungrily pulled the drink from her and poured it down my throat.

“That’s it—it’s okay—you’re ages away from that. You still have so much left to give me. Rest now.”

And she was gone again. Only there to feign comfort—only there to imitate compassion. A phantom that if Henri was to be believed—when I was all used up—would walk me to self-imposed gallows.

I had avoided it to that time, but I could not help a glance in the mirror to see what I’d become and was appalled with the man reflected back at me. The fat had melted from my cheeks and deep bags sat below bloodshot eyes. What color had remained of my hair was now replaced with gray, and the majority of it had receded.

I looked upon the face of a dying man.

The House could not refill my glass quickly enough that night, and eventually I collapsed back onto the bed—preferring the nightmares I might find in my dreams to the one before me.

The following day, I did not leave my room until I heard Henri venture from his, which was after nightfall. And I only did so cautiously, first peeking to see if The Warden’s door was opened.

Upon finding it shut, I ventured down the stairs to find Henri swaying in front of something that had sprung up between the two front windows.

A door.

Which, as with the rest of The House, was ancient—heavy, likely made of oak—and had an iron doorknob that sat beneath a lock carved, from what I could tell, out of bone.

“See, I told you. Here it is—an invitation has been sent. Now we wait for it to be accepted.” Though he spoke calmly, his face appeared to have aged years overnight.

While he had not indicated to me that Bo was a friend or that they were close in any way, I knew from his stories that Bo had been there since Henri had arrived. With Bo’s death, I wondered if Henri was considering how long it would be before The House would take him too.

“How will we know if it’s been accepted?” I asked, trying to focus the subject on anything other than the events of the previous night.

“The Warden will make a key.” Came his cryptic response.

“What do you mean, it’ll make a key?” I annoyedly followed up.

“You will see soon.” He said, before reaching forward to try the knob. It was, as he indicated it would be, locked. I tried it myself, though it might as have remained a wall for all the success I had.

But I was not completely deterred—I studied the lock, wondering if I might be able to find something laying around that I could use to pick it, yet it was unlike anything I’d seen before. In fact, it looked to me as if it were still waiting for a key to be designed for it.

Still, I thought it might be worth a shot to see if I could get it to turn, and finding a nail on the floor, I stuck it into the opening.

Immediately, the nail glowed orange and burned my fingers before melting to the floor. Henri chuckled while I shook my singed skin through the frigid air.

“I guess I must applaud you for trying, but this door can only be opened by one of The Warden’s keys.” He snorted.

“So, we just need to steal one of those then, right?” I asked.

He laughed harder, “Oh, if only it were so simple my friend.”

His mirth was cut short when a bang came from upstairs.

“Shit!” Henri exclaimed.

We had no time to react. It was only in that brief flash that I truly appreciated how small The House was compared to the size of The Warden. In what must have been seconds, it made its way from its room, down the stairs, and had grabbed us both around the ankles.

Then it madly dragged us by our legs, smashing our bodies step by step, up to the second floor, before unceremoniously throwing each of us into our respective rooms. And as I lay there, certain I’d broken several ribs in the journey, I heard it tear back down the stairs, screeching horribly as it did—clearly in terrible distress.

Reaching first for my whiskey to numb the pain in my chest, I next tip-toed to my door to see what was going on below. And when I made it to the hallway, I saw that Henri was leaning out from his room, a fresh needle mark in his arm, to watch the scene unfolding downstairs as well.

Down on the first floor, The Warden’s shrieks became more and more intense as it slammed itself around—pounding on the walls—charging to and fro. Confused, I wondered briefly if it was trying to escape when suddenly, it stopped just in front of the door—holding one of its hands out before its face.

There, in the palm, a spike was forcing its way out—exactly like the ones that covered the rest of its body. A pointed bone jammed through its skin before, slowly, the tip began to form into a jagged, but methodical shape.

A key.

I couldn’t believe I didn’t recognize them before, but I had only seen The Warden the one time previously, and my eyes had been somewhat clouded by painful tears.

The spines protruding from its skin were not tipped with venomous points…

But with keys.

Hundreds of keys.

Various shapes and sizes dating back to locking mechanisms in the early 1800s—I understood then why Henri had thought the idea of stealing a key from The Warden to be so humorous—one would literally need to be snapped off of its body…

The Warden continued to bellow until the key finished growing and taking shape before it fell silent again. And then, it waited.

Patiently, it hovered in front of the door—anticipating something—something that did not come until well after the sun rose the following morning.

When a noise I recognized all too well met my ears.

The turning of a key in a lock from outside the house.

I watched then, as The Warden inserted the newly formed key in its palm into the lock on the door and, pausing but for a moment, rotated it to the unlocked position.

Silently, I screamed in my head for the person on the other side to run away—to not be as stupid as I was to crack the door open. But it was no use—I saw the knob turn.

The Warden hid behind the door as it crept open, and I observed in the opening a man confusedly scanning the space before his eyes. There, behind him, was a rainy street with cars splashing through puddles, and I considered, for an instant, sprinting down the steps and diving out to freedom.

Yet before I could start my legs, The Warden reached through, just as it had for me, and yanked the man inside. He was forcefully smashed to the ground and I heard something snap as he began to wail in pain and fear. But I was not watching him—I was watching The Warden slam the door behind him—watching it remove its hand from the lock, and the key retract into its palm—watching a new quill spring up in the forest on the creature’s back—and watching the door dissolve once again into a solid wall.

The Warden circled the new arrival once before climbing the stairs again. And my first inclination was to withdraw into my room before it passed by, but I was overcome with an impulse that I could not ignore.

A wildly stupid impulse.

As it lumbered by my door, I waited until its back, right leg was set down in front of me. Then, I reached forward, wrapped my fingers around one of the spines on its ankle, and snapped it off.

It howled with shock and pain, whipped around, and struck me with such force that I was knocked clear across the room and into the wall. Something cracked in my back, and I was met with the worst agony in all my days. I was sure that The Warden was going to come in and crush more of my bones, but its head just hovered in the doorway. It looked to the key I held in my hand, and observed the anguish on my face before simply turning away and continuing back to its hole.

Perplexed, I could not believe that it allowed me to keep the key, wondering why it had not pursued to wrench it from my grasp. But when I looked down, I solved the mystery quickly.

The spine in my hand was only that—a spine. The key that had been intricately carved out of it’s point when I removed it from The Warden’s leg only moments before, was smoothed out.

It was useless.

And my back was broken—a fine reward for my brazen idiocy.

I screamed from the torment racking my nerves, but also at the futility of my situation. For a brief second, I’d allowed myself to believe there was a way out. To believe I was not going to waste away for months—to hang myself—to be eaten by a monster.

Henri left his room once The Warden was safely locked away and paused at my door long enough to say, “you are a moron,” before heading down to the first floor to attempt and calm the new arrival. He had explained to me already that we could not enter each-other’s rooms, so I knew he could do nothing to help me, but his lack of empathy still stung on top of everything else. At least I’d tried to do something to get us out of there, rather than just waiting for The House to consume us.

“You’re a very naughty boy, William.” Sherry’s mocking voice cut in, as I felt the glass slip into my hand. “Drink up! That back is going to take a long time to heal—you’ll need a lot of this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was two days before I was able to move from the floor. The drink helped with the recovery, but only enough that I could get to my bed where I remained for the next week. From my convalescence, I could hear Henri trying to communicate with our new tenant, Manuel, but they had not made much progress yet. Henri spoke French and English, and Manuel only Spanish.

While I was confined, I had nothing but time to think, and I delved firstly into why I’d done what I’d done to begin with. Why was I even searching for a way out of The House, when The House was giving me exactly what I wanted before it brought me there? All I had to do within its walls was drink—drink and die. It even removed all other worries of the outside world—bills, food, injury, work…

“The House provides.”

So then, why the impulse to survive? Why the drive to escape? Was it just that I could not stomach the idea of dangling myself from a noose? Or was it that, by forcing me to listen to Bo’s death—by refusing to let me be deaf to his final consumption—The House had inadvertently sparked my will to live?

Whatever the case, as I lay in that bed, I resolved that I would not die there—I resolved to go home.

And I believed that it was not impossible—The House had shown me something the day Manuel arrived.

It was vulnerable.

If we truly could not leave The House, then why would The Warden have bothered to return us to our rooms before it opened the door? What would it care if we were down there when it pulled someone new inside unless it was worried that while it was open to someone entering, someone else could exit?

I mulled over plans for some time that involved me sprinting down the stairs the second the door was cracked, but I considered the timing of it and the sheer size of The Warden and every scenario that I played out in my head ended with it breaking several of my bones well before I reached the portal.

I did not think it wise to test The Warden’s speed and strength. And, while I did not think that it would outright kill me, as The House would then lose one of its meals, I had just been made brutally aware that it was willing to destroy large parts of my body in defense of itself.

However, I thought again on what had happened when I snapped off one of the keys from its leg and I felt there was another clue in The Warden’s behavior afterwards.

It had made sure that the spine in my hands had ceased to be a key before it returned to its hovel. Why would it do that if it knew any key removed from its body would become useless in human hands?

With that question in mind, I examined what I knew about how The Winter House worked from Henri’s descriptions, and my own observations, and I arrived at a conclusion.

I could use my own key to escape.

The House needed to put a piece of itself out into the world to invite us in—the drink I’d found on my nightstand, the needles Henri had discovered on his dresser. And when we had accepted the invitation, we’d given a piece of ourselves back to The House—a piece which it used to create the key and bridge the divide into our world.

It was a theory, obviously, but if I was to hold onto any hope of surviving the nightmare, it was one that I needed to believe in. The key was created equally by me and by The House and only its makers could use it to access the outside world.

And while I had firm faith that my key would retain its form in my hands, I had two major issues to overcome.

The first was finding my key amongst the hundreds The Warden retained on its body.

Though I was certain I could recognize the cuts that I’d personally designed, it would take careful, and close inspection for me to locate it.

The second, and no less daunting, would come after I’d discovered it. That was, how to remove it and fit it into the door without The Warden mangling my body.

Over the next several days, a plan took shape in my mind.

A plan that would require the help of Henri and Manuel.

&#x200B;

****

&#x200B;

Neither man was very keen on my proposal when I shared it with them after finally recovering enough to leave my room.

Manuel could not understand much of it, but he gleaned enough from the conversation to surmise that it was very dangerous—Henri simply thought it would never work. Around the splintered table in our three ramshackle chairs cobbled together by a bored and restless Henri, we discussed my fantastical plan for escape.

“You’re going to get us killed.” Henri said.

“I don’t think so.” I replied. “I don’t think The Warden will take it that far. You forget what you told me on my first day here. ‘It is The House and The House is it.’ Remember? It doesn’t want to take our lives; it wants us to do that ourselves. Otherwise, it can’t savor its meal the way it wants to. Break us, sure—I have firsthand experience with that one. But we can recover from those injuries quickly here and try again.”

While our vices did speed the recovery process, they also never allowed the damage to our bodies to fully heal. My elbow still bothered me daily, and the destruction of my back made every move agonizingly tedious. I’d also noticed that every drink The House gave me was weaker than the last—it was very slowly working to wear me down and increase my suffering. But I was willing to weather significant pain if it would afford us the chance at freedom.

“Even if that’s true, you’ll never find your key.” Henri quipped.

But I was confident that I could—I would just need their assistance.

The Warden rarely emerged, so there would normally be few opportunities to search it, yet Henri had said that it would come out to separate us if we tried to murder one another as it would be a wasted meal too if we were to die by each other’s hands.

So, in my mind, it was a simple proposition.

We would need to fight one another.

Often, brutally, seriously. We would need to be convincing enough that The House would have to intervene. And while The Warden was punishing us, I would have a window for an up-close inspection of its hoard.

It took several days to convince my compatriots to join my resistance. I believe Henri capitulated as his own mortality weighed on him more and more by the hour—Manuel I think was simply afraid and looking for anything to distract him from the bleak world he’d been unwillingly forced into.

In all actuality, I did not necessarily need their endorsement for my plan to progress. I could have just as easily attacked either of them without permission, but I felt that if they did not know why I was doing it, they might ambush me someday and quickly finish me off before The Warden could stop them. As well, my conscience just would not let me keep it a secret from them, especially considering the second piece of my strategy.

I dreaded discussing it, and was hoping I might be able to leave it as something ‘to be sorted later,’ but Henri figured it out on his own.

“But of course, this is only half an idea. Even if you can locate your key, and even if you could remove it from The Warden, you would need the door to return to use it. And for the door to return, one of us must die…” Henri somberly stated. “And as you believe you must be the one to wield your key, it must be either me or Manuel.”

I could not look him in the eye when I replied with a quiet, “Yes.”

Manuel caught on and holding up a couple fingers said, “Only two?”

“Yes,” I added, “only two of us will be able to leave, and I must be one of them. Once I locate the key, we’ll need to wait for the door to return and once it’s arrived, we’ll stage one more fight. When The Warden attacks me, I’ll snap the key off and one other spine so it will, hopefully, only see the one that isn’t mine turn into a useless spike while, in the confusion, I stash the ‘real one’ in my pocket. Then, when it leaves us alone again—whatever state we’re in—we’ll drag ourselves to the door, I’ll let us out, and we’re home free.

“It’s all we’ve got.” I concluded.

Though, while the plan sounded straightforward enough on paper, it turned out to be much more difficult in practice.

Henri’s body was deteriorating rapidly. All of ours were, really, as we had to continue to use our vices in order to get through the day. Especially considering that if we did not, we became so sick and weak that we would not have the energy or strength to convincingly try to kill one another. However, Henri was so far gone already that on our first attempt, I broke several of his ribs with a half-hearted punch before The Warden fractured his skull.

It was a brutal game we played.

Desperately, in each trial, I scanned The Warden for the telltale cuts of my key, but The Warden was fast and violent.

Still, we were undaunted.

We tried again and again, with Manuel and I taking the brunt of the punishments as Henri took far longer to recover than either of us.

Then, after four months, and countless failed attempts in which I suffered innumerable injuries including a crushed foot, broken arm, broken nose, several deep gashes, and a dislocated shoulder, Henri stopped emerging from his room entirely. I tried to speak with him through the door—urged him to carry on—promised him that we were close, and that he could maybe go home soon, but it was too late. I could hear him speaking softly in his final hours.

“Okay. Okay, yes. You’re right. I’m ready. It’s too much—I’m ready.”

He had never told me who it was that haunted his room, but I knew there was a loved one in there—someone that he trusted—convincing him that it was time for him to die. The House had squeezed every ounce of life from him that it cared to take—the meal was finished, and it was ready for its dessert.

I care not to describe the sounds of that evening again, but suffice to say they will never leave my ears. Henri was not someone I would have called a friend, but he had been there since my very first day, and his passing was difficult for me to stomach. With his loss, I felt the walls of The House closing in on me evermore.

However, as bleak as the morning following Henri’s death was, there was one macabre upside to his demise.

When I went downstairs to inspect, I found Manuel standing in the living room staring at the space between the two front windows.

Where the door had materialized once again.

Manuel turned to face me, and I could see from his mostly vacant gaze and the bloodshot eyes that he’d likely swallowed an entire bottle of pills after The House had finished with Henri. Yet, buried beneath the stupor of blunted horror and disgust, there appeared a determination which I had not recognized in him before.

Manuel had, assuredly, gone along with the escape attempt so far, but with a hesitation that suggested he felt it wasn’t the only way we might leave The House. I don’t think he had truly believed that he would die there, and still held onto hope he may one day just wake up in a hospital bed recovering from a near-fatal overdose. It had clearly been a humbling experience for him, as it had been for me, to listen to another man’s life end in such harrowing fashion.

Without a word to one another, we both understood the opportunity that lay before us, and that, for at least one of us, this would be the last chance to get out alive.

A small nod from Manuel told me that he was ready, and I charged him with all the remaining strength in my body. Tackling him to the ground, I pummeled his ribs with my fists, not bothering to hold back this time.

He, having spent far less time in The House, was not nearly as diminished, and was able to flip me over onto my back with relative ease before he pinned me down and closed his fingers around my windpipe.

Blackness began to press in on my eyes as my brain was refused oxygen, and when I was on the brink of losing consciousness, I heard the familiar blast of The Warden’s door smashing open.

It came, more furiously, and more quickly that it had any time previously—even though I was hovering between life and death at the time, I was sure it was mere seconds between it leaving its room and it hurtling Manuel from atop me.

There was an incredible crash as Manuel landed on the table and it collapsed in a flurry of splinters. And The Warden followed him to dole out more abuse, while I gasped air into my lungs, trying furiously to regain my vision.

The snapping of bones jolted me from the floor, and I rolled to see that The Warden had stomped on Manuel’s ankle, cracking it in two. He cried out in torturous suffering, and I felt a pang of sympathy, but I was not looking at his newly crippled leg—I was looking at the leg The Warden had used to inflict the damage.

There, on the back of the thigh, just above the bend of the knee, was a familiar shape.

With The Warden distracted, and raising its first to deliver a blow I knew would be aimed at knocking out several of Manuel’s teeth, I crawled as quietly as I could towards their struggle. Inching closer and closer—eyes locked on our only hope.

When I was just an arm’s length away, I raised myself to my feet, and braced for the onslaught I was sure would be rained down upon me momentarily.

Then, swiftly, I threw my hands forward, wrapping my right around the base of the spine tipped with my key, and left around a random second. With a twist of my wrists, I snapped both of them clean from its body in one motion.

And I was met instantly with a backwards kick to the diaphragm.

The blast sent me, through the air, ten-feet across the room—the shock of which knocked the decoy from my left hand. But, miraculously, I managed to hold onto the true one in my right.

Working to recover my breath yet again, having had it knocked from me by the powerful shot to the chest, and blinking the stars from my eyes brought on from the slam of my head against the ground when I landed—I cautiously looked upon the item I gripped tightly in my palm.

The key remained at the tip.

I had precious little time to celebrate, however, as The Warden had rounded on me. It directed its wicked focus to what I’d stolen from it and my planned subterfuge was thwarted instantaneously. We would not be able to slip out quietly like I’d hoped—it was now or never.

Where I’d fallen, I was directly in front of the door, and The Warden looked from me, back to it, and back to me again. Both of us recognizing the gravity of each of our next moves.

I rolled towards the door—reaching from the ground for the knob with my empty hand and aiming the key for the lock. But, before I could insert it, I felt the monster’s hand around my leg pulling me back. It grabbed my right arm, and with its incredible strength attempted to crush it with the aim of forcing me to release my grasp.

But I held firm, struggling fiercely to rip myself away, knowing that if I dropped the key, it would lose form, and I would be dooming Manuel and I.

Yet, the pain was becoming unbearable—I could feel the bones in my forearm beginning to splinter when suddenly, I was released.

Manuel had dragged himself across the floor, and had picked up the spine I’d naively believed would work to fool The Warden. In a stroke of improvised genius, he’d jammed the point of it into one of the empty, black sockets in The Warden’s face—causing it to recoil in pain and confusion.

In the brief reprieve this granted us, as The Warden ran around the room trying to pry the impalement free, I was able to lift myself from the floor, slide the key into the lock, and rotate it.

A loud, beautiful click told me that it had worked.

And, understanding that any hesitation would cost the both of us our lives, I threw the door open to find my front yard before me.

A gentle, summer breeze met skin that had not felt warmth in months. I breathed in the miraculous smell of fresh cut grass as I spun and reached for Manuel’s hand. Hobbled as he was, I did not want to waste time trying to get him to his feet to limp out, and instead began yanking to drag him through the opening behind me.

But The Warden had finally been able to pull the intrusion from its face, and recovered, witnessed that we were nearly free of it. It latched onto Manuel’s broken leg and pulled him the opposite direction of me—back into The House—back into Hell.

I tried, with every ounce of fortitude left in my emaciated body to heave him loose of its grip, but it was of no use. Slowly, Manuel’s hand slipped through my fingers.

The last my eyes met his, I tried to wordlessly let him know how sorry I was—tried to thank him for all he’d done—tried to find any measure of forgiveness in his expression. But all I saw was fear and pleading—pleading for me not to leave him behind.

Yet I knew that it was over. There was nothing more I could do for him—if I did not leave then, neither of us would be getting out.

So, too fearful of that prospect, and truly hating myself for it, I turned away from Manuel.

I pulled the key from the lock.

I stepped through the portal.

And I slammed the door behind me.

It’s been two years since my stay in The Winter House, and up to this writing, I had not shared the details of my time there with anyone.

Who would have believed me anyways?

The instant the door had closed, the key turned to dust in my hand. And, though I was confident the bridge between this world and *there* was broken, I did not dare immediately check whether the door now opened into my house or its.

With the only evidence of my experience being my extensive injuries and significant liver damage, I chose to explain those as having been acquired through a lengthy bender and having lived on the streets for the few months that I’d been missing. Even considering an attempt to explain the truth of what had happened to me filled me with terror, guilt, and shame—I convinced myself that no good could come of it.

Barely alive, the first two weeks after my return were spent in a hospital being pumped with nutrients and receiving several considerable surgeries to begin to correct some of the damage to my body. And luckily, with several months of treatment and a few more surgeries, my prognosis for a full recovery was good.

It was not until my return from the initial stay in the hospital that I first opened my own door again; which, bringing with it a powerful wave of relief, revealed behind it my living room, just as I’d left it those months before.

Upon entering, the first thing that I did was dump out the remnants of the whiskey I’d purchased on the night I’d relapsed—the only glimmer of positivity from the whole experience being that it strengthened the resolve in my sobriety.

I told myself that I would never touch another drop—that I would live the rest of my life trying to help other addicts reach recovery—that I would keep as many away from The Winter House that I could.

As I know it’s still out there.

I know it’s just on the other side of the door—waiting for me.

It knows I have my moments of weakness.

It knows I suffer.

And it hungers for my return.

I’m writing this now to remind myself of the horrors it put me through. I’m writing it so that I never forget the torment I endured at its hands.

Because its temptations are difficult to resist.

For the last several nights, when I’ve laid my head down to sleep, I’ve been greeted with the sound of tinkling in a glass.

The invitation rests beside me—waiting for me accept it.

I’m flooded with the memory of euphoria it contains—of the unbridled ecstasy I could experience once again.

A familiar, chill air sweeps through the room.

And Sherry’s whispers meet my ears.

“Oh baby, I’ve missed you. It’s okay—just take it...

“Come back home.”
