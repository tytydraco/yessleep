It was early October when I felt it. When it all started. In movies and TV they show earthquakes as shaking the whole house with stuff falling all over the place. But to me it was just a loud noise. 

It was around 6:30 in the morning when a loud banging sound fully woke me up. My first thought was that one of my parents or my sister had slipped and fallen down the stairs. But if that were the case , I feel like I'd hear some groaning or my excitable bull terrier Champ would be barking for us to get help. 

He's so protective that when my sister puts her hairclip on her arm he thinks it’s something biting her and paws it off of her arm.

I decided that I should get up and investigate. The sun hadn't risen yet over my town of Geller Meadow New York so I used my phone's flashlight to feel my way to the light switch on the first floor. 


Once on I noticed the family pictures had been moved crooked and the cartoonish Betty Boop like angel glass figure my mom loved was laying on Champ's bed after falling from its spot on the shelf above. 

I laughed to myself knowing my father would be kicking himself for moving the bed over there because he hated that damn thing. I picked it up and put it back on the shelf, 

"Damnit" I heard behind me. 

I turned around to see my dad standing there in his red boxers and white t-shirt. His usually finely combed gray hair was a mess and he looked tired, 

"I knew I shouldn't have moved that damn bed". 

I looked at him,

 "What happened?"  

he shook his head, clearly annoyed that his Sunday had to start off with him awake instead of sleeping, 

"earthquake probably, not surprised your sister slept through it, she'd sleep through an atom bomb"  

He grabbed a mug and went over to the coffee pot saying, 

"By the way your mother and I are going to a wake at three, so you're in charge of her" 

 "Got it" I said.

 I lay down on the couch planning on inviting my friends over that night to go up to the hill to smoke and drink, but the weather wasn't looking too hot. Rain all day. As I was checking my phone started to ring. 

I looked up to see the contact name of "Mad Max". 

I sighed and answered it knowing I was about to get the hyperbole of one Max Hooper, one of my best friends. 

"Dude!! Did you feel that?" he asked, 

"Yeah, hard to miss it" I replied. 

Champ ran over aggressively sniffing me almost like he was taking my vitals after an accident. After his checkup he licked my face and ran upstairs. 

"Anyway" Max said, 

"I'm gonna be on the computer in a few hours if you wanna join, see ya" 

he hung up and I closed my eyes falling asleep on the couch. 

When I woke up it was pouring rain and my little sister, Susie,  about 9 years old at the time, was sitting on the chair across from the couch watching Jersey Shore. 

"What are you doing", 

she looked at me shocked that I would interrupt her replying, 

"Shut up James!"


 I shrugged and got up walking to the kitchen to get myself some cereal.  I turned on the TV hoping to see some news about the earthquake. It was of course the top story so they made me wait for it. 

A puff piece about some home made Haunted House for Halloween, a break in at a local Spirit Halloween, then finally earthquake news. 3.8. Pretty intense for this area. Not enough to cause serious damage but still. 

The next day the weather had started to clear up as I walked Susie to school, talking my ear off about the latest episode of the Batchelor. Thankfully the high school and elementary school were less than two blocks away. 

As I walked through the puddles from the previous night I heard the sound of my salvation. 

Ace Of Spades by Motorhead. I turned around knowing the black pickup truck immediately. 

I put my hand up in mock hitchhiking fashion. The truck stopped and the passenger window opened up to see Max sitting next to another close friend of mine Alex Kiley with a cigarette in his mouth,

 "McArthur! Need a ride?", 

"If there's room between you two love birds" 

I joked, 

"Hey" Max said, 

"Room for three and I hear you’re a great skier" , 


"Fuck you" 

I said climbing into the back. 

"You gotta get a license" Max said, 

"Oh what's your excuse?" 

I responded, Max turned to me, his thick glasses giving him bug eyes 

"I'm not trying to bang Sarah Clarkson" 

Alex grinned and said, 

"Ohhhh, does Kyle know you're trying to introduce his twin sister to your trouser snake?" 

 "Yeah" Max said, 

"That's gotta be some kind of Freudian thing, like you really wanna fuck Kyle but society won't allow it" 

I laughed, 

"Is that your excuse with your uncle? You wanna get with your dad but when he shows you his wrestling moves that's the closest you're gonna get?"

The car erupted with laughter as we pulled into the parking lot of the school. Alex put his cigarette into the ashtray and jumped out. We stepped out too and walked in. We went to our homeroom on the third floor. 


Our other two friends sat in the usual spot. Kyle and Sarah Clarkson. Both blonde hair and blue eyes. 

Sarah was and still is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life. Curly blonde hair, round face and a smile that could light up a dark room. 

We walked over and sat with them, 

"How's it going?" I asked Sarah, 

"Great, were you awake for the earthquake last night?" she asked, 

"Yeah, it was crazy"

, "Is champ alright" she responded, 

I grinned, "Yeah he's fine"

A few minutes later the morning announcements started. 

 "Good morning" principal Wheeler said,

 not in her usual chipper Robin Williams impression saying, "Good Morning Geller Meadow". 


She continued

 "Yesterday, an elementary school student named Will Erikson was seemingly abducted. If anybody has any information, the police will be in room 202 all day" 

the announcements went on as usual but everyone was in talking about what they thought happened. 


"Usually its a parent" one girl said, 


"Were they divorced"  

I was just stunned, he was in the same class as my sister. 

After school we drove up to the hills to have a smoke and a drink just get our minds off of it. It's a short drive from school up to a nice spot that overlooks the town. 

We found a mostly abandoned parking lot that we go to to just have fun. But there wasn't a lot of fun that day. We sat around talking to each other about what might have happened. 

"Relative maybe? Some creep" Kyle theorized, 


"Maybe your uncle" Max said. 

Alex punched his arm, 

"Shut up bozo" 

Sarah thought for a moment, 

"I read that his bike was still there but there, you don't think somebody just drove by and snatched him up?". 

"It's possible" Kyle said. 

"Is Susie ok?" 

She asked me clutching her shirt.

 "Susie's fine" I said, 

"My mom texted me, her class got out early because of everything going on and she picked her up". 

Kyle shook his head, 

"It's just one of those things. I can't imagine it happening here" 

Alex went to a ditch to take a piss. Once the sound of water hitting dead wet leaves stopped he looked to his right and said,

 "What is that"?  

He zipped up his pants as I walked over to see what he had found. He walked into the ditch over to a red rain boot sticking out of the leaves. He moved the leaves away from it and gasped falling backwards. 

He got to his feet and ran back up, stumbling over himself, 

"What?" 

I asked. 

"It's a fucking body". 

I looked down into the ditch and saw what it was. The face through the leaves was the very same one I saw on the missing posters going up around town. Will Erikson. 

After collecting ourselves we called the police. Around twenty minutes later they came up with two cop cars and an ambulance. 

We all sat on a fallen log, Sarah holding my arm tight. As though if she let go, whoever did that to Will would come for her. 

Or me. 

They needed two separate stretchers to get the body out of the ditch. 

Both halves covered by sheets with the EMT's saying things like "bisected" and "hollowed out". 

I felt like I was in a nightmare. Like I just had to sit there and wait for this to end. An officer walked over to us he looked like how I felt. His eyes wide, his voice stuttering, 

"The... I... We're gonna take you guys down to the station for questioning. You're not under arrest we just need to get some things straight" 

I nodded as the five of us got up. Max and Alex went to one car and me and the Clarkson twins into the other. Sarah still holding my arm. Under other circumstances I would be hyped that she was being this clingy to me, but I knew in the moment that she was afraid. 

We all were afraid

Once we reached the station we were taken into a conference room. Outside of the windows we could see cubicles of detectives and officers all rushing around. It all started to feel more real now. 

The door opened and a large man in his mid fifties walked in. He had a bushy moustache and was wearing a black suit and tie. 

He sat down at the opposite end of the table to us. 

"Your parents have been called, they'll be here soon. We've just gotta get some answers" 

He looked through his notes before looking back up, 

"I'm detective Jason Mills by the way" 

He closed the file and looked up at us,

 "So who discovered the body?" 

Alex raised his hand. Alex told him what he had seen. The red boot. 

"So what were you kids doing up there?",

 "Just hanging out" Max said. 

Mills looked at him with a bewildered expression, 

"A child was murdered Mr. Hooper. I promise you that a some underage drinking is the least of our concern right now". 

Sarah looked up,

 "Are we suspects?" 

Mills looked like he was mulling over how to answer the question,

 "No" he said. 

"Do you have any leads?" Kyle asked. 

Mills again considered his answer, 

"We believe that it was somebody the victim knew. His father said that in stranger situations that he have a code. Like if a stranger came up to him and said his mom was in an accident and he needed to pick him up, the stranger would have to say Black Boat.  And nobody in the neighborhood he was kidnapped heard any screaming or signs of struggle." 

I looked behind him and saw my mother running into the room of cubicles clutching her heart. She ran over to the door and opened it, 

"James" 

she said, "Oh my god are you alright?" 

I stood up and she hugged me tightly. Mills stood up 

"Mrs. McArthur? I advise your son stay out of school for a few days to process. This can be a very traumatic experience." 

She shook her head,

 "Come on... let's go"  

I followed her out into the car. 

When I got home my dad was already there in the kitchen, tense with anxiety. Susie was in her room crying. 

"James" he said, 

he stood up and hugged me tight.

 "You alright kid?" he asked,

 "I'm fine dad" I said, 

"I just need some rest". 

I went up to my room and closed the door, not even turning on the lights. I lied down and tried to sleep. 

That night I had a bizarre dream. I was in a field in some rural area.

 Will was in front of me. 

"Come on" 

he said as he skipped and hopped towards a huge factory. I followed him. The sky was red. Once we entered the factory I felt wrong. 

Like I didn't belong there, and something terrible was waiting for me at the end. "This is where he takes us" he said, 

"who?" I asked. 

He just giggled and ran forwards. Deeper into the rusty halls. Into the darkness. I felt cold then. I stopped. In the darkness I heard a voice talking in  a sing song manner,

 "Will you won't you will you won't you... won't you join the dance?"

When I woke up my heart was pounding. I was so thirsty. I went downstairs to get a glass of water from the sink. Moving through the darkness and turning the light on in the kitchen. As I filled the glass a pebble hit the window in front of me. 

Champ started to growl as I looked outside. In my backyard I saw a man. 

A man in a red and black jester costume, workman's boots and a white skull mask.  He put his finger to his lips, shushing me. Then he turned around and walked into the darkness. 

Champ stopped growling and started to whimper. When I looked at that man, in his eyes I had the same feeling from my dream. The same wrongness. 

All of a sudden I heard Susie let out a blood curdling scream. I ran upstairs as fast as I could and threw open the door. She was sitting straight up in bed shaking. I ran over to her.

 "Susie!! Susie what's the matter?" 

She looked at me with a fear in her eyes that no nine year old girl should ever have to feel.

 "He told me his name" she said. 

"Who" I asked.

 "The man who killed Will" "What is it?" I asked, 

"Jessie" she said.
