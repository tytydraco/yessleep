For twenty-two years, the sound of the ocean has been the baseline of my life. I am a priestess at a small shrine on the coast of Oita, and the waves are our oldest prayer. They are constant, eternal. At least, they were. Three weeks ago, I was walking the path to the cliffs when, for seventeen seconds, the ocean went silent. It wasn't that the waves stopped; I could see them crashing on the rocks below. They just made no sound. That was the first time. It was not the last.

My name is Akari. My world is, and has always been, built of sound. The gentle splash of water at the *chōzuya* where visitors purify their hands. The sharp clap of a prayer. The deep, resonant chime of the main bell. The rustle of the wind through the sacred camphor tree. These are the sounds of peace. Of order.

The silence came for them one by one.

After it took the ocean, it crept into the shrine grounds. The row of bronze *fuurin* wind chimes my grandmother hung fell still. I’d watch them, in a strong sea breeze, swaying violently on their strings, yet producing no sound at all. It was like watching a memory of a sound, an echo in reverse. The silence had an unnerving quality. It wasn't just quiet; it was a void. A patch of it would feel cold, the air thin and dead.

I tried to fight it. I performed the *oharai* purification rites, waving the *ōnusa* wand, chanting the ancient words meant to dispel impurities. The silence consumed my prayers. My voice would leave my lips and simply vanish, never reaching the air. The act felt hollow, meaningless. My faith, for the first time in my life, had no purchase.

Desperate, I turned to the shrine’s *komonjo*, the records kept by generations of my ancestors. I spent days with the fragile, insect-eaten scrolls, searching for any mention of such a phenomenon. I found it, in a text from the Edo period. A priest described a "silent plague," a spreading stillness that caused "a coldness in the soul" and was a harbinger of madness. He gave it a name: the *Shiinon*. The Death Sound. The text noted that the elders of that time blamed the phenomenon on the mountains to the west, a range they called, with great fear, *Nageku Yama*—the Crying Mountain. The account was dismissed by the next generation as folklore.

Tonight, the *Shiinon* came for the heart of the shrine.

During evening prayers, it seeped into the *haiden*, the hall of worship. It flowed like mist across the tatami mats. The candle flames flickered but made no sound. The scent of incense was still there, but the crackle of it burning was gone. I stood before the altar, my hand trembling as I raised my *kagura suzu*, the sacred bells used to call the kami.

I shook them. And there was nothing.

I saw the cluster of bells vibrate wildly, I felt the familiar weight of them in my hand, but there was only the oppressive, dead vacuum of the *Shiinon*. In that moment, the order of my world shattered. This was not a spirit to be placated. It was an absence. A hunger.

I don’t know what moved me. It was an instinct born of pure terror. The scrolls said it was a harbinger of madness from the "Crying Mountain," and I thought, what if the madness comes from fighting it? What if you can’t fill a void, you can only refuse to feed it? I dropped the bells, knelt on the wood, and did the one thing that went against my every instinct. I didn’t chant. I didn’t pray. I emptied my mind, controlled my breathing, and offered it my own silence. I met its void with my own.

It felt like holding my breath underwater. A crushing pressure built around me, a profound cold that seeped into my bones. But after a long, terrifying moment, the presence receded. It pulled back from the *haiden*, and the first sound I heard was the frantic, ragged gasp of my own breath.

It’s 11:52 PM now. The silence has retreated to the edges of the shrine grounds, for now. In the aftermath, shaking, I did what my ancestors couldn't. I opened my laptop. I searched for "Nageku Yama," for "Oita crying mountain," for "sound phenomenon." And I found a post on this very forum.

It was written by a sound engineer. He wrote about a village called Yonomori, nestled in the mountains. He wrote about a maddening 43hz hum, an "Infection Sound" he called the *Kansen-on*. He wrote about a compulsion, a cave, and his escape to a hotel in Beppu.

My blood went cold. Beppu is the city down the coast from me. His "Infection Sound" and my "Death Sound" are not two different phenomena. They are two sides of the same horror. He heard the mountain's voice; I am being consumed by its shadow. He was pulled toward a cave; I am being erased in my own home.

So I am writing this. This is not a confession, or a plea for help. It is a warning, and it is a message.

To the sound engineer in Beppu: You are not going crazy, and you did not escape. You only heard half of the song. I have heard the other half. The entity in that mountain does not just scream. It also listens. And I think I’m beginning to understand what it wants.
