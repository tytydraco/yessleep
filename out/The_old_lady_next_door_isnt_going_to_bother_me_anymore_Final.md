The strangest thing happened after I put the phone in my pocket and steeled myself to open the door. Well, the strangest thing up until that point. There I was, a white trash gladiator with my two-ply gauntlet and porcelain club, ready to take on my living room furniture or die trying, when I felt the whooshing of cold air from under the door. As I reached for the knob the scrabbling of legs both large and small died away, leaving me in the oddly soothing squall of rain battering the side of the building.

I opened the door and inexplicably the hallway now led a short distance straight to the closet door. Crossing it took longer than I expected, it felt like I had been walking for minutes before I finally reached the flimsy, wooden door. Turning back the way I came, the hallway seemed to stretch out endlessly, the four corners converging on each other until the other end completely vanished. I opened the door and stood for a long time, staring down into the yawning darkness.

Instead of the closet I hadn't been inside in months, the doorway opened directly onto a set of steps in a thin, straight stairwell. Directly in front of me it looked a lot like the inside of the apartment. The steps were covered in the same cheap laminate tiles that mimicked wood, the walls carrying the same cracked and pockmarked plaster. As the stairway descended into the inky darkness, however, it began to shift. Fake wood became worn stone, and plaster turned to tightly packed earth. I was still weighing my options when I heard a familiar wail echoing up the staircase.

"I'm so sorry... oh god please, I'm so fuckin' sorry..."

It was Darla, she was down there somewhere, too. My heart sank as I realized the guilt that knowledge  brought me did nothing to shore up my crumbling resolve. She needed help but I was too scared to go looking for her, too scared to take the first step. I heard another familiar sound then, echoing from far behind me.

I looked back down the hall, squinting in the distance, and saw the thing that looked like my couch. Its mouth hung open wider than before, cushions spilling out and dragging behind it like entrails as it desperately clawed its way towards me on long, many-segmented legs. The walls of the hallway bowed out ahead of the couch as the floor shrank to send the leathery sack of death hurtling towards me. I looked down at the toilet tank lid held limply in my blood soaked hand and still didn't find the strength to move until I heard yet another familiar sound, one I was finding increasingly difficult to ignore.

The material of the stairwell changed much faster than I expected, becoming fully dirt and stone in what would have been only a few flights, but as I chased down the echoing cries of my stupid cat it kept changing. The dirt of the walls and roof was dark, tightly packed mud on some levels, and loose shifting sand on others. The stones beneath my feet were massive dusty flagstones, multicolored stained glass tiles, and everything else in between.

My bare feet thundered down the steps with a splash and I realized the soothing sounds of rain had become the roaring din of rushing water. Turning back, I saw the couch hadn't followed me down. It merely stood in the doorway, watching my descent as water flowed from the hall down the little stairwell. I might not have slipped then if I had been looking where I was going, but I have a feeling the damned step would have pulled away from me anyways.

I held my porcelain weapon close to my chest as I careened down the stairwell like a street luger with no board, it wouldn't do to break my protection before I even got to use it, and that's probably how I chipped my front tooth. Just about every step on the way down went straight into my tailbone, so I couldn't tell you which one specifically cracked it. Finally, right at the very end of the stairwell the roof ended in a small, concrete lip that jutted down about an inch or two. That's what knocked me out cold.

I came to suddenly, hacking up a few musty droplets of brackish water that had slid up my nostril and down my throat. The floor was completely flooded now, and more rivulets of moldy grey rainwater flowed down the walls from cracks in the roof that swarmed with misshapen insects. There was no sign of the stairwell I had come from, just bare hallway as far as the eye could see in both directions. The walls seemed to be made of a different material every time I looked at them, and as I wiped waterlogged scraps of bloody toilet paper from my arm I saw an opening in the wall that hadn't been there the first time I looked.

Hoisting my shiny, white club onto my shoulder I stood and listened hard for any sounds over the roaring gurgle of the water rushing through the walls. Unable to hear anything over the splashing, I headed cautiously for the intersection. Rounding the corner I found myself in what appeared to be a carpeted hotel hallway.

The sopping, waterlogged carpet couldn't seem to decide what hideous color it wanted to be, flickering between lime green and burnt umber like the rattling last breaths of a homeless man drowning in the gutter. Tacky wallpaper designs bloomed and withered across the walls like the swan song of a dying chameleon. Only the doors remained static as they lined the impossibly long hall, as myriad and unique as snowflakes. None of them looked familiar.

I heard a blood curdling scream directly behind me just then, and I almost dropped the lid of the toilet tank as I spun, heart leaping into my throat. Directly at my feet there appeared to be a red, plastic cooler covered in cigarette burns dragging somebody past me so ferociously it looked like she was falling into a wood chipper. It was Darla, flailing madly and screaming in between bouts of hacking up the brackish slime that filled her open mouth every time her head was dunked.

I'm a little ashamed to say that at first I was frozen in shock, watching slack-jawed as she was thrashed and yanked towards me. The scabrous plastic of the cooler flexed and collapsed like an insectile exoskeleton as it heaved her down the flooded hallway on sharp limbs that might have resembled wheels if it curled them in tight. It shook her effortlessly like a dog with a toy, slamming her into the wall so hard I heard ribs cracking, and she landed flat on her back.

She saw me then, weakly lifting a trembling hand in my direction, and finally I snapped out of my stupor. I raised the shiny slab above my head with both hands and swung down on the rabid cooler with all my might. To my surprise, the toilet tank cover smashed a dent into the top of the cooler without taking a scratch, deep cracks spiderwebbing across the rough plastic. I'm glad Ruth sprang for the vitreous china.

The cooler didn't make a sound, save for the whooshing of air as it relinquished its battered prey, it simply turned around and scampered through a nearby door that was standing open. A car door. One of those big sliding minivan doors, open perpendicular to the wall like it was on a hinge. Before I had time to process what I was looking at, Darla coughed wetly and sat up against the wall, fumbling in the pockets of her jean shorts with trembling hands.

"Jack? Fuck, is it good to see someone else. Thought I finally OD'd and went to hell or some shit." She produced a crumpled, dripping pack of cigarettes and gingerly placed one of the sad, limp paper tubes between her trembling lips, focusing her attention now on the drowned lighter clicking uselessly in her hands.

"I thought Ruth might have slipped me something in one of her pies and this was just a really bad dream." I said with a halfhearted smile, leaning against the opposite wall.

She made a noise then that might have been a rueful chuckle, or just more mold in her lungs, and tossed the lighter into the slowly rising water. She made no attempt to pull the cigarette from her mouth, letting it slide slowly off her chin as she replied.

"I've known her a long time, that old bat wouldn't hurt a fly if it was shittin' on a Bible. She don't like the fun stuff, anyways."

Darla sighed and leaned her head back against the wall, looking up towards the ceiling. I followed her gaze and saw that the roof was teeming with a swarm of tiny insects that rushed frantically to and fro. They seemed to be carrying small bits of dirt or plaster to the spewing cracks and I watched them work as she continued.

"I thought it was a dream at first, too. I was even happy about it. Anything's better than the usual."

I looked down at her then and saw she was clutching the soggy pack of cigarettes tightly in her fist, eyes shining and wide as she did everything in her power not to make eye contact. I made it easier on her by returning my gaze to the dutifully marching bugs.

"Thought I was losing it for the longest time. Sleep deprivation does funny things to your brain, you know? Threw my damn car keys out more times than I can count but they just kept coming back. Torturing me."

I looked down at the small ring of dark holes on the meaty part of my palm as I tried to commiserate.

"Yeah, something like that happened to me tonight, too."

"That shit was real, Jack. *Is* real, and it really fuckin' hurts." She nods and closes her eyes, taking a shaky breath. "It's been getting worse the past few weeks. Last night I finally passed out and the dream... it was so much worse this time..." Fat tears broke through her pinched eyelids and started rolling down her face. At the time I thought she didn't want to talk about it, like usual. When I changed the subject she let out a shuddering sigh that I mistook for relief. I wish I had made more of an effort.

"Do you remember where you came from? Maybe if we find the same door we can get out of here."

She shook her head ruefully, squeezing her fists so tightly the knuckles turned white.

"Doesn't matter. The damn place changes on you. Run around a corner, end up right back where you started. I think."

"Well... have you seen my cat down here?"

She looked up at me then, her signature derisive smirk slowly creeping onto her face.

"You have a cat?"

Brushing aside the awkwardness of the moment I offered her a hand, but she batted it away and struggled to her feet on her own. We were still debating which direction to go when she looked back and screamed, running off ahead of me around a corner before I even had time to register the red plastic cooler lurking behind me.

Off balance, I took a heavy swing that missed completely as the cooler scurried past me without a second look, smashing the toilet tank lid to smithereens against what appeared to be a shower curtain draped across a doorway. Picking up the largest shard from the sunken wreckage, I whirled around to face the cooler for round three and saw it standing serenely at the intersection. Before I could pounce it turned, disinterested, and squeezed itself through the corner where the wall met the floor.

Approaching the spot it had disappeared into carefully, I peeked around the corner and saw Darla standing in front of a large, black car door set into the wall further down the hallway. One of her hands was on the handle.

"Darla!"

The expression on her face was ghoulish. Her deep set eyes passed over me hollowly, looking through me like I wasn't even there.

"He's in there!"

That's all she said before desperately clawing the door open and leaping inside. I ran harder than I have in years, legs pumping like pistons as adrenaline drove my body forward, but it wasn't fast enough. It couldn't be fast enough, because I hadn't started moving until she was inside.

When I got to the door and looked inside it took me a second to register what I was looking at. Like the dreams I had been having recently, the inside of the room was amorphous and seemed to have a crusty glaze over everything. What had once been the interior of a minivan was bloated and fried, resembling something closer to a 1970's style conversation pit that had seen too many fondue nights. The cushions and windows shuddered and danced around as flames licked the exterior. Sitting in the center, clutching something that looked like a vinyl doll that had been baked in an oven, was Darla.

"Darla you have to come out of there, it's not safe! That... it's not what you think it is!"

She wasn't listening. She simply sat in the middle of the roiling cushions, rocking the squirming, melted bundle in her arms. Thick tears forced their way through her eyelids, solidifying into gel-like droplets as they fell from her face and collected in a crowd around her. In a matter of seconds each shiny globule would grow and darken, sprouting spindly metallic legs as they completed their transformations into small plastic key fobs that scampered about excitedly.

"Goddamnit, Darla, put that thing down and take my hand!"

I dropped the shard of porcelain in the water and braced my hand against the metal frame of the door, reaching out to her. She was only a few inches away, I should have been able to grab her, no problem. She screamed then, and I was forcefully ejected by what felt like a bomb exploding in my face. My back smashed hard into the top half of the wall opposite the car door as it slammed shut in front of me. When I could stand, I raced over to frantically yank on the now immovable handle as I watched her slowly sink into the pulsating cushions, screaming all the while.

I'm not sure how long I stood there, pounding on the door and screaming until I began to hear a crunching sound as my bloody fist made contact. Looking down at my fist I saw a couple of smashed insect-like things, still holding bits of plaster in their twitching mandibles. I took a step back and saw that a deluge of car keys was squeezing out through the cracks of the doorframe, and most of them were busily burying the door into the wall. The ones that weren't were streaming up the walls to the roof, joining the massive parade now traveling in one direction.

As my gaze followed them down the hall, I heard a soft, echoing meow.

Brandishing the sharp chunk of ceramic I stormed down the labyrinth of twisting hallways, following the marching insects until I came face to face with the thing that looked like my sofa, standing next to a door in the hall. The stream of insects continued past the calmly waiting couch but it made no move as I slowly approached it. It merely crawled a few inches back as I approached the door it had claimed, through which intermittent muffled meows could be heard.

It was a hospital door.

I opened the door and walked into the twisted nightmare that had been tormenting me day after day. She looked worse now, crumpled and emaciated in the center of a web of wires and tubes. The swollen, bulbous mass of flesh in her abdomen roiled violently as a sickening grin slowly grew past the boundaries of her face. Her abundance of beady eyes jittered and swirled like bubbles in a boiling pot. When she spoke it was like a robotic sounding chorus, all of her own voice.

"Screw you. I'll see you tomorrow."

Those had been the last words I ever said to my wife as I left the hospital on that night. She had laughed, but I always regretted it. She had passed away less than an hour later. I should have told her I loved her. The thing ruining her face reached impossibly long, spindly arms towards me, fingers splaying and curling like hooked tentacles.

"Have you been taking care of our baby?"

We had never been able to conceive, so when I came home one day to find a World's Greatest Dad mug sitting on the edge of the kitchen sink I was ecstatic. I had come home too early while she was giving our new cat a bath, I was supposed to see Sweet Pea first. My opinion of the snooty little furball had never recovered. As I climbed into bed with the creature and recited my line it wrapped its long arms around and around me like a cocoon.

"Hell no, I hate that little snot. If you dare die before me she's going straight to the kill shelter."

"What? How could you!?"

It let out a mock gasp that sounded like a rusty harmonica, followed by a wailing that sounded far less sarcastic than it was supposed to. The sound drove ice cold spikes of guilt deep into my heart. My wife and I joked around a lot, but I always regretted not making more of an effort to put her at ease. I gingerly placed a hand on the distorted face that had once belonged to my wife and did my best to look into its eyes as they shimmied and slipped around.

"But she did die, and she had never been this fucking ugly."

I furiously drove my dagger forged of vitreous china into its face, grabbing hold of what seemed like its shoulder so it couldn't scramble away. It screamed in the dying chorus of a million tiny voices. I'm actually surprised that's all it took. The room shrank and folded in on itself slowly as I wrenched my weapon free to begin working on the misshapen mass of what looked like flesh. I dug deep into the hard carapace, tearing and prying free layer after layer of chitinous shell until finally I pulled a struggling, wailing bundle into my arms. I didn't even mind that she was covered in a foul smelling, grey slime.

The dimming, seizing walls of the room shrank in heaving jerks, sliding Sweet Pea and I into the damp hallway as it collapsed in on itself and crumbled. The melting grey sludge that had once been a hospital room now looked like an ant hive that had been stomped on and drowned. I spared a passing thought for the trusty toilet tank lid that had saved me more than once, but, as Sweet Pea settled into my arms and began to purr, I moved on. She made no attempt to leave my arms as I stood, noting that there was less water on the floor. Something about that felt ominous, and I quickly picked up following the parade of skittering insects where I had left off.

Thankfully, it didn't take long for me to find what they had been working on, where the flooding was at its worst.

The doorway to the stairs I had fallen down was almost completely boarded up, some edges seeming to melt into the wall like it had never been there as water spewed from webbed cracks that had yet to be covered. I could only tell what it was because there was a small ragged hole near the top, through which I could see the steps. I had seen how fast they worked on Darla's door, so I was confused for just a moment why they were still working on it, when the head of a ball-peen hammer suddenly crashed through, tearing a ragged hole in the barricade and sending bits of plaster flying. 

"There you little buggers, take some more of that where the Good Lord shoulda split ya!"

I had never been so happy to hear that pack-a-day buzzsaw, I actually felt a surge of hope as I called out to her.

"Ruth?!"

"Jackie baby, is that you in there?" Two scraggly, squinting eyes appeared in the slowly closing hole as she let out a hearty laugh that could make the dead file a noise complaint. "Thank sweet baby Jesus, I thought I was about to drown in your Godforsaken closet for no reason. Here sweetie, many hands make light work!"

With a grunt of effort her small, but mighty hammer carved another channel into the doorway, through which the handle of a foot-long flathead screwdriver wiggled at me. As I shifted Sweet Pea to one arm to pull free the rusty, steel skewer I felt like King Arthur, wondering just what the hell Ruth gets up to in her time off. I set to work stabbing at the cracks while she bludgeoned the other side and at first, it seemed like we were getting somewhere.

"What the hell are you doing down here, Ruth?"

"Oh well at first I was holed up in my kitchen trying to calm down with some honey tea. I couldn't stay down with all the heavy rain, big storms always give me the heebies something fierce." 

She paused for a moment to stretch her fingers, gasping softly at what must have been decades worth of arthritis, and I gently prodded her as I chipped away at the seams.

"You're afraid of bad weather?"

"Yup," she nodded curtly, looking down at her hand as she rotated her wrist. "Lost all my babies to Hurricane Andrew. That was back in '92, '93 maybe."

It felt like I had stepped on a landmine, but I didn't want to just brush past it like I had with Darla.

"I'm sorry for your loss."

She flashed her impossibly white grin at me then, I swear it's like the room lit up for a second, and passed the hammer to her other hand as she continued working on the thin barrier separating us.

"Aw that's sweet of ya dear, but I'll be alright. I cried all my tears long ago, God bless."

"How... do you keep from thinking about it so much? You live in Florida, it rains like this every couple of weeks."

"Oh, honey." She gave me a sympathetic look and gently shook her head. "I think about them every single day. They may be in a better place now, but they'll never be gone. I carry them with me, always."

She raised her soggy, leopard print pajama clad arm and displayed her collection of plastic bangles. For the first time, I noticed each had names engraved in the colorful bands. Eli. Naomi. Marlon. Jessie. David.

I noticed then that while we stood there talking, the tireless insects had undone most of our work. We had been able to make progress at first, but more of them were showing up all the time. Ruth gave one last mighty swing, smashing a pumpkin-sized hole through the quickly rebuilding wall, dropping the hammer into the waist-high water surrounding her.

"Just take my hand, let me help you out of there."

Her wrinkly, gnarled hand looked solid as it extended towards me through the hole. The insects almost seemed to shy away from her hand, hesitating for just a moment before they continued their work. When I took her hand the shifting labyrinth of hallways and doors fell away from us, sloughing off like a beard made of soap bubbles under the shower head. The spinning in my head was nauseating as I found myself laying on the flooded laminate floor of the closet next to my geriatric hero and a very pissy, wet cat.

It's a few hours later now and the first rays of sunlight are starting to peek through the dark clouds. I'm currently sitting on the plastic sheet wrapping Ruth's couch while she whips up a batch of cookies. I look down at Sweet Pea curled up in my lap, who slowly closes her eyes as I gently stroke her fur. Several apartments on the first floor, including mine, had suffered devastating flood damage. Thankfully, Ruth still has several unoccupied units, so Sweet Pea and I won't be out of a home.

Ruth had been hiding from the storm in her kitchen when she heard Darla scream. She went to go see if Darla needed any help, but couldn't get in because Darla had long ago installed her own locks on the door. When she didn't get a response by knocking, Ruth went to grab her tools and came to see if I'd be willing to help. I asked her if she saw any bugs or monsters, and she told me the floodwaters had been full of dying, twitching insects. She did have to tussle with a few scuttling plate-things from my kitchen counter, but she managed them with only a few small scrapes. She had spent the next hour or so trying to break down the dam at the bottom of the stairs.

Ruth is going to have a lot of work ahead of her to fix up the damage, but I think I can still hold a mop with my good hand. Darla wasn't the only person to go missing, two other apartments now stand empty and destroyed, but none of them had any family to contact. Just about everything in my apartment is trashed, too, but I managed to save something important.

The box of my wife's belongings had fallen to the floor, next to the bloated corpse of the creature that had mimicked it. A small, silver locket had fallen out. I had thrown it away the first time my wife gave it to me, but she must have saved it from the trash when I wasn't looking. Inside of the silver, heart-shaped shell are two images. One of me, and one of Sweet Pea. Natalie had always thought she was so damned funny, and she was right.

It's 8 in the morning and I think we're going to be alright.
