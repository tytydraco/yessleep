Last Wednesday, the time had finally arrived. It is hurtful and unfortunate, but this can no longer go on. There was no way to explain everything to my wife since she is not as open minded as you people, therefore, I only told her that I was about to quit, again. We argued for hours because I could not tell her the truth about anything, not even my wounds, but on the other hand, it was certainly better for my family not to know more about that job and especially that thing.  
  
Things at home are escalating quickly with all my children now dreaming about the voice, and demanding me to get out of the black room after developing a strange sickness that targets their lungs. Just like that, there was a monumental need for funds and I was about to quit in the middle of the storm. Conveniently, my supervisor contacted me the same day for us to have another meeting, certainly over the things that happened on Monday and Tuesday. That was the best occasion to end this nightmare, however, his response to my willingness to resign crushed me instantly.  
  
"I thought we had an agreement? Well, I'm afraid you can't do that. You can't leave now, you signed a contract." He said.  
  
Following my protest, he retrieved his copy of the contract I am really sure to have read thoroughly before signing, and showed me the part that binds me to that company for the next two months before I can talk about resignation and vacation. I still argued, convinced that I was being tricked, but he brushed it off saying that he did not even call me for such a hassle, instead, the company wanted to congratulate me with a 30% raise. I was shocked. This could not happening after my 'blunder' and it did not make any sense at all.  
  
Upon leaving the building, I encountered the man with the black motorcycle helmet, seemingly waiting for someone. I attempted to ask him if he was lost again, but he retorted with a question about how I enjoyed my new job. From what I understood of our unfriendly exchange, that guy, who had no idea what that job was about, is a former applicant who resented me for getting the position. According to him, I did not even qualify for such a work which for me is quite ironic. Now that I know about the job, I actually agree with him even though he does not know what he is talking about, and I know that you people agree with him too, since I can not stop breaking the rules.  
  
Ah humans! Look at them angrily screaming at athletes during sport games, or at anyone else in a situation they are not directly involved in, because from the outside looking in everything seems so easy, until you step in the shoes of the person you are screaming at.  
  
However, I can see that some of you really want to help. Following your reasoning and suggestions, I bought a few other useful things to survive midnight. Among them, bluetooth canceling noise earbuds because I like music and we know that the entity likes to bang on the door for attention. Honestly, on Thursday, I was not ready to fall for that monster's tricks. The night started well until midnight rang of course. Feeling cozy on the couch and under the blanket with my earbuds, I watched the entity roam around in the building from 12:00 am to 12:34 am, affecting the cameras as usual, before it stopped at the black room door. I looked at the door and saw it shaking. Curious, I removed my earbuds to hear the entity banging on the door and growling. Yeah sure, suit yourself! I thought, before putting the earbuds back, but after a few minutes, instead of the distorted music, I heard static and then my own voice:  
  
"Imbecile! Idiot! Stupid! Moron! It is only a fool of your caliber that ends up in such a place. Fools like you are the reason I am still here. You do not even know the reason why you are in that chamber. Do you think you are safe inside? I shall pay you back for all the pain you are pouring on me. You shall know no rest until I crush your progeny, your love and everything you know. I shall start with..."  
  
At that point I removed the earbuds, only to hear it continue its hate filled rant behind the door, still using my own voice:  
  
"...your oldest and you will be the last to fall. I shall feast on your fear, despair and blood until you beg me to..."  
  
I clenched my teeth and put my hands on my ears to block the evil words. What was that thing even talking about? I remained curled up on the couch, doing my best to cancel the noise with my gloved hands until everything stopped at 01:00 am. I did not respond, I did not interact and really survived it that time. I stayed in the room and respected the rules, something I really hope you are happy with. For once, I have not been stupid. Please do not hesitate to congratulate me.   
  
On Friday, I came back with noise canceling earbuds for sleep, confident that the entity would not have any means of talking to me with those on. I was not ready for what awaited. Once again, at midnight, I found myself on the couch and under the blanket with my earbuds and a flashlight, but after turning everything off: the light, the monitors, the radio and my phone. I even brought some sleeping pills along but refrained from taking some, a fact that I believe has saved my life.  
  
For the first time, I managed to sleep in the black room, for maybe twenty minutes before I involuntarily started to cough. It got to the point where I could not even stop coughing, ultimately waking me up to witness a terrifying scenery. At first, I could not see anything in the dark, only perceiving the strong smell of smoke. I then switched my flashlight on and still could not see anything except for the cloud of dark gray smoke that surrounded me, hurting my eyes in the process. I feared having been teleported out of the black room as I still have no idea about the extent of the entity's powers. Soon, I heard it laughing so close that I thought it was right next to me.  
  
Was it a fire? Was that the entity's smoke that I had witnessed that time from outside the building? I wondered, until I bumped into something metallic and shaking. It was the black room door. I was still inside, the entity was still outside, but it had found a way to hurt me. I coughed again and again, not even able to see what time it was and certain that I would die, suffocating inside that room. I ended up on the floor, defeated, hearing the entity rejoice:  
  
"You don't know what I'm capable of dirty bastard! Everything just became worse because of you. I'll make you pay, you'll pay! I'll show you things that even Kevin never saw me do." It said, speaking like several people synchronized and saying the same words, before laughing uncontrollably. I changed his name to Kevin for the reasons you know, but understand that the entity had just mentioned my supervisor. Everything then suddenly stopped. The smoke had vanished, but I was still unable to breath normally. Still on the floor, with my flashlight on, I looked at the clock and read the time: 01:00 am.  
  
Even at this very moment, I still think about those nights and the entity's words without finding out why it resents me so much for things I obviously do not know of. Just like I suspected, it seems that my supervisor was hiding a lot of things from me. Also, if the entity can sneak in smoke or gas inside the black room, then it means that even there I am no longer safe, like it said, I have no idea what it can do. However, I think my supervisor and I need to meet and talk once again.  
  
Let me just hope that tomorrow Monday I will still be alive to do so. Since the weekend, I have started coughing incessantly just like my children. My affliction of lungs however came with a darker twist. Unlike my children, when I cough sometimes, my mouth unfortunately fills up with blood.
