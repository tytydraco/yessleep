Lilith was driving me to the edge. I was white knuckled on a rollercoaster with no breaks, and I was starting to go off the rails. No one could help me.   
I screamed and pleaded and begged, but she wasn’t going to let me off.  
The only way off was to be with her. To give her what she wanted.  
I was so fucking ready to give in.  
I still can’t believe I didn’t give in.  
\-  
Charlie had his head in my lap with his tongue hanging out of the side of his mouth. He was panting so hard, but he was still talking to me. Charlie never stopped talking to me. He kept talking right until the end.  
Daddy was driving fast and the old truck was rattling louder than it normally did as we flew down the road. I saw a bunch of other kids playing outside and I wished I was them. I wished I didn’t have to be doing what I was doing.  
Daddy kept wiping his eyes. I saw him cry. I don’t know if it was because he was sad for Charlie, or because he knew there was nothing he could do to help his little girl.  
\-  
I saw our reflection in the glass doors as we went into the vet’s office. I was running to keep up with Daddy, and Charlie was hanging limply in his arms. His tail wasn’t moving. That wooden pocket watch that Daddy had made and painted gold, hung down from the blue ribbon around Charlie’s neck.  
With each step, it swung back and forth like a pendulum. The minutes were counting down.  


All dogs go to heaven, but those are hollow words when you’re watching them go through hell.  
\-  
The table. The damned cold metal table. I didn’t want Charlie to have to lay on it, so I took off my jacket and put it underneath him. He kept talking to me. His voice was tired, but I think he was trying to tell me it was going to be ok. He kept moving his head and licking the tears off of my face. His body was shaking.  
The doctor told me and Daddy that there was nothing he could do. Charlie was sick. Charlie was old. The doctor left.  
Daddy put his head next to mine. His strong voice was breaking while my old dog was dying.  
“Baby. We have to let him go. He’s hurting really bad.”  
“Can’t we get him some medicine?”  
“Medicine isn’t going to help him anymore, baby.”  
I put my face up against Charlie’s. I had never known life without my dog. I was eight, and I didn’t want to know life without him.  
“Charlie, please don’t leave me.”   
The doctor came back in with a needle.  
I hate needles. They do bad things.  
I heard Charlie start to bark, but it was coming from somewhere far away.  
“He’s barking Daddy!”  
The doctor was petting my dog while he held the needle next to his leg.  
Charlie was barking somewhere.  
“Daddy. He’s better now! Don’t let the doctor do it!”  
The doctor pushed that awful needle into my friend.   
Charlie was barking somewhere.  
“Daddy, make him stop! Charlie’s better now! I can hear him!”   
I was standing outside of myself. I saw my dad petting my head while I was petting my dog. Charlie’s eyes were locked onto mine. He knew what was about to happen.  
Charlie talked for just a second and then he was quiet. He stopped moving. He peed on the metal table.  
He was still barking somewhere.  
My Daddy whispered in my ear.  
“It’s gonna be ok, baby. The sun’s gonna come up tomorrow. You just try and get some sleep.” He kissed my neck just behind my ear.  
My neck burned. Charlie was barking.   
Daddy was frozen. I was frozen.  
I wanted to scream. I couldn’t move. His lips were setting my neck on fire.  
I could hear the dog trying to get in the sliding glass window.  
\-  
I woke up in pain. Jessica was stirring in my arms. We were sleeping on an air mattress on my parents' bedroom floor. I got up slowly, trying not to cry out in agony. My parents were still asleep.   
I hoped they were still my parents.  
I ran to the bathroom, turned on the shower, and ducked my head underneath the cold water and I felt the raised skin on the back of my neck with my fingers. The burning was turning into a dull ache.  
I opened the drawer and grabbed the small mirror and held it to the back of my neck so I could see it in the larger mirror.  
There was a new burn. Lilith had kissed me while I was asleep. Her lips had burned into me and left me with another scar.   
\-  
For two days, I couldn’t sleep. I showed my parents the burn. The cops took pictures of it. They all reassured me that Lilith couldn’t have gotten inside.  
I was constantly asking my mom and dad questions from my youth that only they would know the answer to. I second guessed myself over and over, trying to remember exactly which stories I had told Lilith about growing up.  
I felt like I had told her everything. She might have had all the right answers.  
\-  
I was constantly looking for any sign of how Lilith could have slipped inside the house. The winking cop from the cruiser outside kept walking around the outside of my parents house, but he couldn’t find any sign that she had been there either. At least, that’s what he told my father. How was I supposed to trust him?  
\-  
Detective Hopkins came by on the second day and we talked out on the porch. The sun was just starting to go down and Homer and Joe were sitting on their porch next door, drinking their cups of decaf pretending that they weren’t listening to every word.   
I noticed another coffee stain on Hopkin’s shirt. He seemed different than he was before. His blue eyes were colder.   
“Evening, Amy. You look like you’re not getting any rest.”  
“I’m not.”   
“Well, it’s probably best that you try.”  
“Looks like you still haven’t fixed that hole in your lip.” His eyes darted down to the stain.  
“Son of a bitch.” He moved his tie to the left, trying to cover the stain. There was no smile, just a stone face. “Alright, where do I start? We got the results back from the blood tests.”  
“Ok.”  
“Nothing. Everything was normal for both you and the deceased.”  
“Detective, I’m telling you that she drugged us both with something.”  
“Well, the tests say something else.”  
“What about my neck? She had to have drugged me to do that, right?”  
“Amy, there’s no evidence that anyone broke into the house.”  
“Well how the hell did she burn me then?!”   
An awkward pause.  
“You don’t think I’m doing it to myself, do you?”  
“Listen. I need you to tell me what really happened in that bar. I need you to tell me how that man died.”   
“I told you what happened.”  
“Amy, I’m going to figure out what’s going on here very soon. It’d be a lot easier if you were just straight with me. I already know what he died from, I’m just trying to figure out how it happened while he was sitting across a table from you in a crowded bar.”  
For the rest of the conversation, it was obvious that I was now a suspect.  
Lilith was laughing somewhere.  
\-  
I couldn’t see a way out. Everyone thought I was nuts, or worse. My life was over.  
The second day was over.  
I had no idea what she was going to do next.  
\-  
I tried my best to keep my head clear, but that’s difficult when you think you’re being investigated for murder. I couldn’t trust anyone anymore. I wanted to believe my parents were ok. I even doubted that Jessica was herself.  
I was mourning the loss of my daughter and holding her close to me at the same time.  
The third and fourth days just began to run into one another.   
No word at all from Lilith.  
My body was trying to force me to sleep, and the few times I almost gave in, but the dog would always start barking and slapping his paws against the glass door.  
I went through moments when I thought the dog somehow knew when I was about to fall asleep, and that he was trying to help me stay awake. Then I went through moments when I thought it was Lilith posing as the dog, making me stay awake. Trying to drive me crazy.  
Either way, I was losing it.  
\-  
I knew my body was going to betray me. Eventually I was going to crash. I was drinking coffee constantly, and walking laps through the house, but my brain finally lost the battle.  
I had fallen asleep at the dinner table and my father had carried me to my bed. The only thing I remember from that night was the constant barking.  
When I woke up, there was a new burn on my right calf.  
\-  
I didn’t say anything to the cops, but it was obvious what my parents thought. They thought I was doing it to myself, they just didn’t know how. My mother had taken out the cleaning chemicals from underneath all of the sinks.  
My father put a padlock on the door to the garage.  
They didn’t say anything. They didn’t have to. It was only a matter of time before they would make the decision to put me in a hospital.  
They both asked me not to tell Detective Hopkins about it.  
I had to hold it together. I had to put forward a sane face. I had to figure out some way of ridding myself of Lilith and it would start with the damn necklace.  
\-  
I took the picture frame that I had made, and the necklace and walked into the backyard.  
The dog was out there waiting for me; just staring at me while I threw Lilith’s shit inside of the garbage can. I walked over to him, but he didn’t move. I stopped within a couple feet of him.  
“Are you really a dog?”  
He walked to me and put his front paw on my leg.  
He looked so much like Charlie, but I couldn’t touch him.  
She knew about my dog.  
\-  
I could hear Jessica through the wall, laughing in the backyard. My mom would make the old dog sit while Jessica would go and hide, then my mom would say “sic ‘em!” and the dog would run and find Jessica.  
“He’s finding me grandma! I can’t hide!”  
They were doing it over and over.  
I was in the bath staring at the ceiling. I kept tracing the mark Lilith had given me on my neck with my fingers. I kept staring at the one on my calf.   
I was working out the problem. I needed to make her go away. How could I make her go away? I was accepting the fact that I couldn’t. I had no control.  
The white ceiling became the perfect background for the images going through my mind. My memory kept going back to an awful video that Jim had asked me to watch.   
A jar with a crab inside of it was submerged into a tank with an octopus.  
The octopus wrapped a tentacle around the jar and slowly pulled it closer, while the crab inside was pushing against the glass, helpless to get out. The octopus climbed on top and all of its tentacles draped down the sides of the jar, while the crab struggled inside. The body of the octopus twitched and undulated while it unscrewed the lid and then discarded it. Its entire body squeezed inside of the jar and descended over its meal.  
The crab never had a chance.  
My eyes fluttered and I fell asleep.  
\-  
I saw Lilith standing on the roof of our house. Her body melted and it began to run down from the roof and cover our entire home. I saw my family banging on the windows inside, screaming until the house was completely covered in a milky film that twitched and pulasted.  
It devoured everything.  
\-  
I woke up in the tub; the water had drained. I had no idea how long I had dozed off. My body was numb, but my right leg was burning.  
It was high up on my inner thigh; another kiss from Lilith.  
I was weeping silently in the empty tub. I couldn’t let anyone hear me. I couldn’t tell anyone.  
I stayed there until my head felt clear; until whatever she was drugging me with wore off.  
The door was locked. The only window was a small one above the tub that looked out on the backyard.  
I wondered how she could have possibly got in.  
My eyes moved to the narrow metal vent on the wall just below the ceiling. The paint looked slightly blistered.  
I wondered if she was behind it, watching me.  
I could hear my father talking to someone in the dining room.  
I listened to my mom and my daughter playing with their new friend. They had been out there the whole time, all three of them.   
Unless Lilith was all of them, she couldn’t be any of them. At least, that’s what passed for reasoning in my exhausted mind.  
By the time I could move, I knew what I was going to do next.  
\-  
I tried my best to stay calm.  
I had a role to play, and if I was being watched, I needed to sell it.  
My dad was sitting at the kitchen table with the winking cop from outside, and they were both having a cup of coffee and talking about the Cowboys. I walked past them and opened the sliding glass door. Jessica was asking the dog to sit in exchange for Vienna Sausages while my mom was laughing. The dog was talking and his tail never stopped moving.  
“Jessica. Get back inside the house please.”  
“I’m just feeding Charlie, Mommy! He’s a good boy!”  
I walked out onto the lawn and snatched her by her wrist and pulled her away from the dog.  
“You’re hurting me!” I didn’t listen. My mother was telling me to calm down as I led Jessica back inside.  
“You are not to go outside of this house, do you understand me?!” She was crying. “Jessica?!”  
“I was just playing with Charlie!”  
“That thing is not Charlie! Go to your room!” Jessica was sobbing as she ran down the hall. My mother shot me a look as she walked past me and followed Jessica. I locked the sliding glass door while the bony old dog was doing his best to lick every bit of grease he could out of the empty can of sausages that Jessica had dropped.  
“Amy. You need to calm down.”  
I turned to my dad. The cop was staring at the floor. He was very young and he looked very uncomfortable.  
“Why is he inside?”  
“Honey, this is Officer Avery.”  
“Um, Pete.” He looked at my eyes, but then quickly looked away.  
“I just thought he could use a break from sitting in his car.”  
I stared at them both without saying a word until the kid in a police uniform thanked my dad for the coffee and left.  
“That was a little drastic, don’t you think?”  
“I want that thing gone, Dad.”  
“What thing? Pete or the dog?”  
“The dog. You all need to stay inside the house. You can’t let anybody in.”  
He walked over to me.  
“Ok. You wanna know something? I never liked Lilith. I just smiled and nodded my head most of the time because she was your friend, but I could see something in her eyes that made me feel like I was looking at a bad person. Same thing with Jim. I probably should have said something about both of them, but I didn’t.”  
“Dad…”  
“Well I’m going to say something now. There’s nothing wrong with that dog and he ain’t going anywhere because my granddaughter already went and fell in love with him. Pete’s a nice kid, and if I want to invite a nice kid into my home for coffee, I’m going to.”  
“Dad…”   
“You know he comes back even when his shift is over? Sits out there in his car on his own time. Good kid. I love you and I know you’re scared, but that was over the line. If I were you, I’d go in there and apologize to my daughter.”  
He walked down the hall and left me.  
\-  
I walked into the backyard and opened the back gate that led out onto the street. The dog watched me the entire time. I hoped I was right. I needed to be right.  
“Charlie.” I whispered. He cocked his head. “He had to name you Charlie, didn’t he? Come here.” I lifted my pant leg and let him sniff at the sore on my calf.  
“Good boy. Now sic ‘em! Sic ‘em!”  
The dog ran out of the back gate, barking like mad as if he was chasing something. I followed him.   
Pete was watching me as I ran through the front yard like a crazy person. The dog was standing on the other side of the house and looking up.   
He was barking at the metal vent at the top of the house.   
I walked over as if I saw nothing. I tried to only take quick glances at the metal vent and the blistered paint on the outside of it.  
“Charlie! Come here!”  
I walked him into the backyard. He was yammering along, telling me in his own way what he had been barking at.  
I went back inside.  
Lilith had been near me the entire time, not posing as one of my family, but hiding in our attic.  
\-  
“No. No way.” I knew my dad was going to argue with me.   
“Dad please. I need you to go away. I need you guys out of the house.”  
“This is insane.”  
The dog was in the family room with my mother and Jessica. I insisted that they all stay in the same room. I had convinced my dad to go into the garage with me. There were no attic vents in the garage. I hoped that Lilith wouldn’t hear our conversation.  
“I know you and mom are thinking I’m doing these things to myself. I’m not. Right now, I know that all of you are ok. I NEED to know you guys are ok. I need you to drive somewhere. I don’t want to know where you’re going to go, but you don’t come back until I call you. I’ll figure out how to fix this.”  
“Fix this? Let’s say you’re not confused. Let’s say you’re right about everything. What are you gonna do? Kill her?”  
“Yeah.” He sighed and looked at the ceiling.  
“This is crazy… so damn crazy. Ok! If you’re right, how am I supposed to know that it’s you who’s calling me?”  
“Because I’ll tell you that I saw you crying when we drove Charlie to the vet to put him down. I’ve never told anyone that. Daddy, please. Please.”  
“Ok.”  
“Just one thing.”  
“What?”  
“Take the lock off of the garage.”  
\-  
They were gone. I was sitting on the front porch having a cigarette and the dog was next to me. It was getting cold and I could see the cop sitting in his cruiser staring at me in the darkness. I had the porch light off, and my mom’s little solar lights on the walkway were barely giving off any light.  
A little bit behind the cruiser, Pete was in his own car dressed in plain clothes. He was asleep in his seat when I came out, but he woke up when I closed the front door behind me.  
I watched him trying to act like he wasn’t looking at me.  
I wanted to be outside. I felt like I couldn’t think inside of  the house. I couldn’t think while Lilith’s eyes might be watching me. I had filled my dad’s old metal thermos full of coffee, and I was halfway through it when my phone vibrated.  
“Amy?”  
“Lilith?”  
“So you figured out where I was. Good for you. Always so smart. Did you feel me looking back at you? I’m not there anymore.”  
An awkward pause.  
“Nothing to say?”  
Another.  
“Amy?”  
She always hated awkward pauses.  
“Amy, you better answer me…”  
“Or you’ll do what you sick fuck? Did you follow my family? I don’t think so. I think you’d be too afraid I’d run somewhere and you couldn’t find me. I’m laughing at you Lilith. You’re absolutely pathetic. I can’t believe I was ever so low to have a friend like you. You were nothing but a waste of my time.”  


“You’re always thinking, aren’t you?! Guess I’m going to have to be a little more creative now that you’ve got that fucking dog! Maybe you’ll get to watch “Charlie” die all over again. What do you...”  


“I’m never talking to you again, Lilith. I hope you’re watching this.”  


I closed the call and I dropped the phone on the concrete walkway. I brought my father’s thermos down on it over and over again until my phone was in pieces.  
I finally felt like I had some control. For the first time I had hope that I could figure a way out of everything. A way out of her.  
For some reason, I got up and walked over to Pete’s car. He looked like hell, and it was obvious that he never expected me to walk over to him because he was fidgeting like a cornered animal in the front seat. He rolled down his window. Charlie stood up and put his front paws on the door and sniffed at Pete.  
“You doin’ alright, Mam?”  
“For now, yeah.”  
“Was that her on the phone?”  
“Oh come on Pete. I’m the suspect now, aren’t I? Lilith’s just a myth. You don’t believe me, do you?”  
“Yes, I do.”  
There was a pause, but there was no awkwardness. It felt good to have someone say that they believed me, although I had no idea why he did.  
“Looks like you’ve warmed up to Charlie.”  
“How old are you Pete? You look like you’re twelve.”  
“I’m twenty three, Mam.”  
“Well I’m sure you’ve got better things to do than sit here when you’re off duty. What are you doing here?”  
“It’s my job.”  
“Not right now it’s not. Why are you always here?”   
“I just want to make sure you’re ok.”  
“That’s it, huh? Why did you say that?”  
“What?”  
“Why did you say you believed me?”  
Another pause. He looked straight ahead and bit his lip.  
“Uh… I just feel like I should be here.”  
“Why do you believe me?”  
He seemed to be searching for an excuse, but he must have come up short. He sighed.  
“The reason I decided to become a cop was because of my mom. My dad, he… he’s a really bad guy. He hurt her a lot. When I was eight, she took me and ran. He followed us everywhere. Wouldn’t accept the fact that she didn’t want him.   
Had family and friends keep tellin’ her that she was makin’ somethin’ outta nothin’. Tellin’ her she needed to go back. That it was all her fault. My mom got so tired, she eventually gave in and went back to him. He knocked her head against the stove just a couple of months later. He’s sittin’ in prison now, and my mom’s buried out in Seguin.”  
“I’m sorry.”  
“I guess when someone takes a piece of you like that, you can just see it in other people when they’ve got a missin’ piece too. Everything happenin’ to you, none of it makes sense, but I can see it on your face that you’re tellin’ the truth.”  
“Thank you.”  
“That’s why I stay out here. Eventually, she’s gonna show back up. We’ll get her.”  
“Pete? Make sure your doors are locked and your windows are rolled up. Don’t open up for anybody. I’ll see you in the morning.”  
\-  
I was in the garage, standing next to my dad’s workbench. The necklace that Lilith had given me all those years ago was in front of me. I had fished it out of the garbage can after thinking about what Pete said.   
*“I guess when someone takes a piece of you like that, you can just see it in other people when they’ve got a missing piece too.”*  
I stared at the small point where the two streaks came together. I wanted to sever it.  
There was a small gold cap at the top of the stone where the chain was affixed. I took a couple of tools and worked at the top. Eventually, I felt something snap, and that little gold cap unscrewed. A small part of the stone had been hollowed out. Something was moving inside of it.  
I poured the rest of the coffee out of the thermos, and I shook the stone over it.  
A small drop fell out of the stone and plopped at the bottom of the thermos. It was moving around. I remembered what Lilith had said.  
*“There’s something special inside of it.”*  
*“What?”*  
*“A little bit of* [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/)*.”*
