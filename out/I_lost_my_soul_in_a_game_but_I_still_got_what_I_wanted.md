“Eyes are the window to the soul.”

It’s an old quote that most people have heard of at least once in their life. It’s also wrong. Windows are there to keep unwanted things out of the house. Things like bugs, the cold and loud sounds, while letting the light in and allowing people to look out.

The soul isn’t half as protected as that. The eyes are more a sort of doors to the soul. Close them and you close the door, safely keeping the thing behind it hidden, but open them and you leave your soul vulnerable.

Your soul is an important part of you. You might not know it, but it is and that’s why it’s very valuable. You could sell it. It’s worth a lot and it could get you almost anything you ask for, but you don’t have to trade it. You could also gamble it.

There are certain entities that would do anything to get one. And I do mean anything. From haunting and or killing someone of your choosing to giving out answers to questions no one alive has the answers to. The entities willing to trade you for can range from ghosts that have sold their own soul and are desperate to trade theirs for yours and lower ranking demons that are looking to increase their station, just to name a few.

I knew what I was getting into. I was desperate. My daughter was dying from an unknown disease. The doctors were doing everything they could, but they didn’t have the answers and they couldn’t save my little girl.

I was willing to do anything to save her. And that’s when I found a possible solution. It’s called the soul bargain. You offer up your soul to any willing to play for it. If they win they can have it, but if they lose you get to ask a question. 

I didn't want to play this game. I'm not a tough person. I've never played with a Ouija board or anything. I used to avoid that kind of stuff when I was younger. I don't even like horror movies and I would never have attempted anything like this if I had any other options, but I didn’t have any other options, because my little girl was actively dying.

I hadn’t even been looking for anything. It found me. Or something did anyway, because I received an e-mail a few days ago from someone. I don’t know who and I can’t look it up, because the e-mail seems to have disappeared from my inbox. It’s as if they knew that I didn’t need it any more. I have nothing left to gamble. Nothing left to lose.

Here’s how you play it:

Go into a room that has a lightsource big enough to light up the entire room and turn all the lights off. Make sure that the room is as dark as possible and take a seat somewhere. You need to sit with your back to the light switch in the middle of the room, close your eyes and make sure that there is ample room between your face and the wall. If there isn’t, use a different room. When you’re ready to start say the following:

“I offer up the prize behind my eyes in exchange for a conversation with the first to make their presence known.” Stay seated. The game begins when the lights turn on.

Ask a question and wait for the answer. You have to open your eyes after the question is answered. The question will always be answered truthfully to the best of your opponent’s ability. You lose if you meet the eyes of your opponent. They’ll thank you for the game and you’ll die within a few days. It could be anything from a heart attack to  
an attempted robbery gone wrong. Don’t try to avoid your fate. It’ll only make the chances of you meeting your end in a gruesome way all the more likely.

If you don’t look your opponent in the eyes then you get to continue. Either ask another question or  
close your eyes and walk over to the light switch, thank them for their time and ask them to leave. Turn off the lights and leave the room before openin your eyes. Most of them don’t like losing and they might take it out on you if  
you end the game too quickly for their liking.

I chose my bedroom. It’s not a huge room, but I didn’t need a lot of space and I knew the layout. I knew that I would be able to find the light switch blindly. I tidied up a bit to make sure that there wouldn’t be anything for me to trip on while on my way to the light switch. I put all the unnecessary items underneath my bed.

It took me a while to clean everything. The only thing I had to do was make sure that the floor was empty, but I took my time cleaning. I was stalling. I did not want to do this. My eyes fell onto a picture of my daughter and it strengthened my resolve. I had to do this if I wanted to give her a chance.

I turned the lights off, sat down and said, “I offer up the prize behind my eyes in exchange for a conversation with the first to make their presence known.” my voice was shaking, but I did eventually get the words out. I expected it to take a while and some part of me secretly hoped that nothing would happen at all, but the light turned on almost immediately after I finished my sentence. It wasn’t just the click of the light that caught my attention. I could actually feel the change in th atmosphere. I knew that there was something behind me. It didn’t feel friendly. It felt angry.

I think that that was the moment that I knew that I was going to die I hadn’t excepted it yet, but deep down I knew that the thing behind me was not going to let me go without it’s prize. I pushed my nerves down and asked my first question.

“Can you tell me how to heal my daughter?”

“Yes.” Is what it told me. It was an answer. It at least told me that I wasn’t wasting my time, I hadn’t been specific enough and wasted one of my opportunities. I wasn’t sure if I could think of the right thing to ask under the pressure. I was certain of one thing though. My instincts had been correct the thing behind me was  
angry. It had sneered the answer at. It was playing with me and it wasn’t even happy about it. 

The instructions hadn’t said that I had to opened my eyes immediately after the answer was given. I didn’t want to piss the thing off more than I had to, but I needed a second. I took a deep breath trying to calm down my  
heartrate, leant my head forward so that it would face the floor and opened my eyes. I immediately closed them again. No eyes. That was both a relief and dreadful at the same time. I hadn’t lost yet, but I also couldn’t quit without  
getting the answers that I needed. 

I asked my second question. Being more careful of my wording this time around. “What is the name of the disease that my daughter is currently dying from?” The name would be enough to get her the help that she needed.

It gave me an answer. I won’t share the name. It was something that I had never heard of before, but it was a start. 

The sound had come from my left this time instead of from behind me. That surprised me. I hadn’t even  
heard the thing move. It had been eerily silent ever since I started this game. I slowly moved my head to the right and opened my eyes. I only had my eyes open for a second before closing them again.  
I let out a relieved sigh. I had done it. I felt elated and was getting ready to sprint my way to the light switch and the  
door. I would was almost safe. And that’s when it spoke again. Unprompted this time. “The doctors won’t be able to help you with that information alone.” 

I flinched at the sudden sound of its voice. I hadn’t expected to hear it speak again. I thought that the thing would only answer my questions, but it must have known that I wanted to end the game. 

I didn’t want to ask another question. My heart was already doing a mile a minute and I didn't think that it would be able to take much more, but it had to have been telling the truth. The instructions said that the thing wouldn’t lie to me. I debated stopping the game anyway and taking my chances, but I couldn’t do that I had already come this far. It might have been the adrenaline that made me unable to think clearly, but I decided to ask another question.

“How should I treat her?” No, that’s too vague. It could give me the answer I was looking for, but it could also tell me something along the lines of “Kindly” of “With respect.” It took me a second, but then I had it. “What should I tell my daughter’s doctors to do or test for to give her the best chance of recovery?”

It was surprising helpful this time around. It gave me very detailed instructions on how to help my daughter and what I had to say to my daughter’s medical team. I didn’t think much about it, too happy and too focused on remembering to be suspicious of anything. It still hadn’t made any sounds, but it had moved again the answer had  
come from my right this time around. I looked to my left, opened my eyes and froze. The thing was indeed to the right of me, but I was still looking into its sparkling red eyes. Not directly, but I was still staring at them and the  
smile on that thing’s face told me that it counted. It had used the pictur frame that I had hastily shoved under my bed to reflect it’s face. The picture that had reminded me what I would be losing if I didn’t play this game was now making me lose something else.  

The thing was didn’t have any horns or wings, but it didn’t need any of those things. There was no mistaking this thing for human. It was horrifying. Almost too big to fit into the room. It would have been too big if it had been standing upright, but it wasn’t. It was bending sideways. It didn’t look natural. It reminded me of one of those street signs after they’ve been hit by a car. Sturdy, but all out of shape, but the worst was its smile.

It had an actual grin from ear to ear. It’s teeth were also showing. Rows and rows of those pearly whites were cramped next to, in front of and on top of each other. It thanked me for my time never losing the smile the whole time that it was talking to me and told me that it would be back to collect in three days and then it just  
disappeared. 

Three days it had said. That was two days ago. I have spent all of my remaining time with my daughter. She’s been doing well and the doctors expect her to make a full recovery. I have written letters for her to remember me by when I am no longer here. I haven’t told her that I won’t be with her for much longer. She doesn’t need to know and she’d only blame herself if she did.

I don’t have a lot of time left and I’ve made my peace with that. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want to die, but I am not going to make things worse for myself. There’s still a chance that I get to pass away from a heart attack or something. I am hoping for something quick. I already know that I won’t pass away peacefully in my sleep. I haven’t been able to sleep for more than an hour before I wake up, a burning pain in my right eye and that sneering voice in my head telling me not to try and hide its prize.

I am not looking for advice only to inform those willing to attempt the game themselves.

I am not trying to discourage anyone from playing. I have gotten exactly what I set out to achieve. I just hope that others learn from my mistakes. Good luck.
