Heya r/nosleep, I posted this to another subreddit and with the reception I got I thought it would be good enough for nosleep! This was a very long time ago so details are a little shoddy but the morph I remember like it was yesterday. 

I live in Australia and we don’t have much woodlands here besides a few that span on for a couple hundred acres or so (nothing like what Americans have) and when I was younger I’d get lost in these woods a lot and sometimes even sleep in them for a couple days at most surviving off fish and creek water, I never had any creepy encounters besides this one time. 

I was about 10 years old and just like I do at least once every 2-3 years, I had gotten lost in the woods again. I was completely fine during the day as I had eaten an hour prior to realising I had no fucking idea where I was so I had the old “ah shit, here we go again” moment and decided to walk around to find some sticks to make a little fire. I knew a lot about outdoor survival as my family went camping a lot and I watched videos on YouTube all the time since it interested me and I loved the woods. I had set a fire up as it started getting dark and was about to put out my fire before I saw a small deer on the tree line just nearly out of range of my fires light, it was staring at me which gave me some chills but I just went “ah a little deer” and I waved to it. The deer scurried off into a bush behind it and I couldn’t see it anymore then I heard this really weird noise like twigs snapping and all of the sudden a much larger deer came out of the same bush I just saw the small one jump into. 

At this point I knew something was off so I stood up and stared at the deer as it starred back at me and I was mentally preparing myself for the idea that this thing could run at me (I was a little kid tf am I supposed to think?). The deer started walking a bit towards me and I backed up a little and crouched down but as the deer kept getting closer and I kept backing up I looked down and realised this fucker had a hoof directly in the fire and wasn’t reacting to it at all. This creeped me the fuck out I mean his fur was burning and it was starting to burn it’s skin but it just wasn’t reacting, I immediately set off bolting but I heard it coming behind me, not really running but fast enough to keep up with my little legs. I came over this small hill and jumped down into a bush to try and hide from it and that’s when it happened, the scariest shit I’ve ever seen in my entire life and I remember it so vividly. 

The deers silhouette against the moonlight appeared and as I stared at the deer it let out this blood curdling call that I’ve never heard from another animal before and all of the sudden the silhouette started caving in on itself, I could hear it’s bones snapping and flesh ripping and this thing just kept getting smaller then suddenly it got much bigger and I closed my eyes because I just couldn’t watch anymore. When I opened them, there was a man standing where the deer stood or at least, the silhouette of a man. He was looking around and then started calling out in this creepy almost distorted voice “HELLO? HELLO?” and he repeated this for about 10 minutes while I just sat there in silence refusing to answer whatever the fuck stood just a couple metres above me. The man then just walked off into the trees and I heard that same awful snapping noise before it eventually faded away. 

I didn’t sleep that night, I stayed in that bush the rest of the night terrified that this thing could still be lurking around the area, waiting for me to appear again. Once the morning came I walked in a straight line until I reached a road I recognised and then I ran home. I didn’t tell my family about it as I feared I wouldn’t be taken seriously but I was terrified. I haven’t been into the woods since that day and always stayed home when my family went camping after begging them not to go. 

I’m 21 now, that incident was 10-11 years ago and I still remember that silhouette and the noise of the bones snapping. I’ve done tons of research and my only conclusion to what happened is that I narrowly escaped a Skinwalker. I’m tearing up from fear as I write all of this, remembering that horrific night, I hope you all enjoyed my retelling and if anyone has any other explanation on what this could of been please tell me.
