[The](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1bco0mc/my_wife_believes_there_is_something_in_our_closet/) drive to Mrs. Aldridge’s house was a stomach-turning one. In the darkness, the forest-lined roads felt constricting, as though I was being herded towards the edge of town and into the killing fields. I felt my stomach turning as I made the winding path into her cul de sac.

The lights were off in all of the homes, only a few porch lights and cars parked in driveways speaking to occupants, none of which spoke of wealth or a particular amount of care. I hadn’t noted how run down the neighborhood looked, as though time had forgotten it long before the rest of Redbrook, its occupants realizing there was no hope in maintenance.

I parked in the street, in front of the house I’d seen that morning, and in the darkness felt all the more foreboding. My heart beat against my chest as I stared at the path ahead, a little voice in me raising a possibility I didn’t want to acknowledge, that I may be staring at the path to my own demise.

For a moment I considered leaving, but it took only a few seconds to realize home wasn’t an option. And without Janice, where could I call home? I had nothing, all of my stuff was still at the house and the thought of going back with anything short of the military felt utterly out of the question, and I knew even if somehow I could claim my home back from the thing that lurked its halls now, what good would it be without my wife?

I had to find answers, and peering out at the dark form of the house ahead, it seemed as good a place as any to start. I’d thought Mrs. Aldridge unstable that morning, yet after the events of the day I couldn’t help but wonder how far my own mindstate was from hers, and I couldn’t shake the idea that perhaps, there was more to what the old woman knew.

Steeling myself, I stepped out of the car and into the cloying night air. I was still wearing my work pants from the day, but I hadn’t been left the time to grab a jacket. The air stung at my arms, though I walked the path up to the doorway.

I felt no rush to return to that place, visions of that door in the hallway filling my mind. I rang the doorbell, to no effect, knocking, and fighting back a chill as I listened to the sound echo through the silence of the night.

There was nothing from inside, and for a moment I wondered if the woman had left the home behind. If my creeping suspicions about what lay beyond the closet door were correct, I couldn’t blame her, but where would that leave me? Before I had time to dwell on the thought, the sound of creaking movement within the old structure broke through the quiet.

My mind seemed to run with the sound, painting images of creatures much like the one I’d just escaped shambling towards the doorway. I could hear footsteps growing nearer.

It’s just beyond the door. A little voice screamed. It’s just beyond the door, jaws gnashing, ready to swallow you whole.

The door swung open, and it took all I had not to stumble away. The woman stared up at me, peering nervously from behind the door with eyes wide.

“D - Did my Anson send you?”

I considered lying for a moment, but the faint ray of hope in the woman's eyes made me decide against it.

“No, No ma’am.” I said, quickly adding, “But I would like to help him. And you, if you can help me.”

She seemed to consider my words, brows furrowing for a moment before she stood back. After a moment, she shook her head.

“No…no, we don’t need your help. No, thank you.”

Before I could speak, the door had shut. My mouth hung open as I began to realize I had no idea of what to do next.

Turning to head back to the van, I felt all the weight of the world on my shoulders. I’d reached the end of the sidewalk when I heard the click of a lock.

“Come in. Quickly.”

I turned to see her, peering conspiratorially from the doorway, hardly opened a slit. She beckoned, peering past me through narrowed eyes.

I hurried to oblige, speed-walking to meet her and stepping inside and into the comparative warmth of the frigid home.

Mrs. Aldridge bore a nightgown and a thick sweater, pulled tight around her midsection. I kicked my feet off at the door, stepping aside as she closed it behind me.

“What can I do? What can I do to help Anson?” She hardly missed a beat, stepping in front of me and asking the question with an expression reminiscent of a child waiting for a comforting answer.

“I need to know what happened to him. Everything, before he…left, before I got here. I need to know about…” I paused, glancing past her and down the hall at the still-shut door.

I felt an urge to step closer, to check that the lock was still fixed, but with the way the woman watched me I could tell any unnecessary movements might unnerve her. I couldn’t blame her, I felt just as uneasy. I wondered for a moment if she’d seen the things I had, dismissing the thought instantly as a more dreadful one emerged.

Of course not, otherwise, she’d be dead. Just like you almost were.

She followed my gaze, raising her arms to hug herself, as though a chill had moved through the air. Somehow, I felt it too.

“Let’s…step upstairs. I don’t like it down here.”

I nodded hesitantly and followed as the woman led me toward the stairs leading to the second floor.

The hall at the top of the stairs was as dark as the rest of the house, and somehow colder, as though somewhere in one of the rooms that lined it a window sat open.

“Why not turn on a light? This can’t be…safe…?” I found myself asking.

“Oh, I - I like it better this way,” she muttered, “It saves on the electric.”

The answer felt lacking, but I didn’t want to press on, sensing I’d already pushed the woman far past her comfort zone with my presence alone.

I followed as she moved towards a room at the end of the hall, the only one with a light on within, streaming faintly from the doorway which hung ajar. She stepped into the doorway, pushing the door aside and beckoning me to enter. I nodded my appreciation, doing my best to ignore the blanket of surreal unease that seemed to drape over everything, but her eyes never met mine.

She stared past me, eyes wide as she peered into the darkness. I turned to face what she was looking towards, finding nothing but an open doorway at the end of the hall.

Had it always been opened?

We’d walked past it just moments prior. I felt an uneasy chill, but refused to let the nerves that seemed to haunt the place like ghosts take root. I entered the room. It smelled of age, sweat, and mothballs, a general mess spread about the place that matched the state of the rest of the home. There was one area that seemed untouched by the chaos, a desk against the far wall, atop which sat an ancient desktop monitor, a desktop of similar antiquity beneath.

The bed was unkempt, vague stains visible on the sheets beneath, and I elected to stand, keeping my back to the corner, arms folded to stave off the chills brought on by the freezing air. I could see that a window was open, and it took all I had not to close it myself.

I watched, waiting uneasily for the woman to speak, a part of me waiting for her to shut the door - begging for it.

After a moment of peering down the hall, she entered the room, muttering to herself far too low for me to hear.

I cleared my throat, seemingly startling her, as though she’d forgotten for a moment that I’d been there.

“So…Anson, before he…what was he working on before everything changed?”

It was an educated guess, that like myself, this woman had found herself foisted into a situation beyond her understanding, but one I could make given the suddenness of my own events.

She frowned, shaking her head for a moment before sighing.

“I - I don’t understand it all too well. Anson’s always been such a smart man, brilliant,” she smiled, the first genuine one I’d seen in the short time I’d known her, but the expression was clearly clouded by that same misty forgetfulness.

“He always knows things, always knows.”

“That’s - that’s okay, Mrs. Aldridge. Just - whatever you can remember. Anything at all really. It would be a huge help.”

"He - he never wanted to talk about his work. I - I made him, really," she started, looking up at me with a pleading stare.

"It's not his fault, it's - it's mine. I always asked, always pressed. I knew I shouldn't but… oh, his mind is such a beautiful thing and I always wanted to know what new, wonderful thing it had conjured up. After so many years of marriage it gets hard to keep your work a secret, and eventually he - he didn't anymore."

The look in her eyes was of someone unloading a weight long bared alone, almost frighteningly lucid given the state I'd only ever seen her in. It was gone just as quickly as it appeared, guilt etched across her wizened features.

"You won't tell them, will you? I - oh, I just couldn't handle costing him his job. He loves it, he does. He just…he couldn't abide by this new project at first," she glanced back at me, as though recalling my own hinted connection with her husband.

"But he understands now, I swear, he's - he supports it all. He didn't get it before, but he does now, I - I swear to Jesus, he understands."

I could tell that whatever his job was, secrecy had been integral. The idea that I may report whatever indiscretions he may have had seemed to horrify her. I could feel a rock forming in my gut.

Whatever it was that Anson had been involved in, whatever suspicions or disagreements he'd had with it, and whatever horrors it had put this woman through to create the tired, frightened person before me - my Janice was involved in.

And unlike Anson, she hadn't seen fit to clue me in. I didn't know whether I was more horrified, or angry by the revelation. It took only a moment for the latter to win out. Anson was gone as far as I could tell. So was Janice. And the thing at my house…well, I didn't want to dwell on that for too long.

Whatever the case, I felt no doubt in my mind that this thing, this 'Project Doorway', as the emails had called it, was the reason for it all.

Before I could respond, Mrs. Aldridge stepped away, shaking her head for a moment as she muttered another string of silent words far too unintelligible for me to make out. She sat on the edge of the bed, running her hands over her face as she sighed.

"No," she sighed, sounding as though all the world's exhaustion had been carried in a singular exhale.

"No, you won't tell them." she breathed, seeming resolute in her statement as though something in my silence had confirmed it.

I nodded.

"No, no, I won't tell them. To tell you the truth, I think Anson was right. I don't think the Doorway Project is good, I think it’s putting all of us in danger.”

Her eyes shone with recognition at the name, though at the mention of danger, it was gone, replaced by an animal sort of panic that instantly made me regret my choice of words.

“No, no, no, it’s - it’s nothing like that. Anson swears he was wrong, don’t you get it? He was wrong.”

I pressed on despite Mrs. Aldridge’s clearly growing agitation. Buried beneath all of the confusion, I could tell that this woman had answers, perhaps enough to lead me back to my Janice. I had to pierce through the fog that surrounded them, I had to know just what she knew.

“I understand but…my wife - she works with Anson,” it wasn’t a lie, “I think she’s in trouble, and I’d like to understand your husbands…reservations.” I chose my words carefully, keeping in mind the woman seemed to have something of a hair trigger for panic.

She watched me for a moment, before peering over my shoulder as if to be certain no one was listening in.

“He - he didn’t think it was safe.” she began.

I nodded, prompting her to go on.

“Your wife, she worked on it too?”

I nodded once more.

“Yeah, I, uh, yeah, she did. Does.”

I tried to swallow back the bitter taste the words left on my tongue.

“Hmm,” she seemed to consider the information for a moment.

“How much did you talk about? How much did she tell you about what they do?”

I was almost taken aback by the sudden return of lucidity as she watched me, eyes seeming to scan my face for answers unspoken.

“Not much,” I admitted.

It was mostly the truth.

In reality, she’d told me nothing at all, the little information I had coming from her laptop. It occurred to me for a moment, that it had been her decision to share the password with me, and to warn me, though vaguely of her…replacement. It had been her final act before…well, I wasn't sure. I tried to take some comfort in the fact that she’d at least attempted to leave me with something to move forward with.

She smiled, a thin-lipped, empathetic sort of look.

“Don’t hold it against her, it’s not up to them. When it comes to that sorta work, all the spook stuff - the things I never really understood, there’s all kinds a laws and red tape. If anything, be proud. She takes her work serious.”

She quickly added,” Not that my Anson doesn’t. Oh, there’s nobody who cares more than he does but, this old bird pecked the secrecy out of 'em.”

For some reason, pride was the last thing I felt, especially regarding her secrecy. Confused, angry, and terrified all felt more apt descriptions. I couldn’t deny Janice's work ethic, though.

Even before all of this, that much was undeniable. I’d watched her run herself ragged in the weeks prior working on…well, it occurred to me I didn’t know what she was working on now. Though the suspicion was growing that her story about assignments had been at best, a partial truth obscuring a greater secret, and at worse entirely a lie.

I decided to ask just what I needed to know. I wanted to get out of the house, though I wasn’t sure where. It was freezing, and beyond the cold, I felt something else in the air. Something I’d tried to ignore since I’d entered, but found it persistent, like a skeletal claw of dread caressing at my back.

“What were they working on? Janice - my wife, she never got the chance to tell me before…” I trailed off.

Before what? I still had no idea where she was.

Before she was killed by that thing in your house, probably. While you were at work, she was being ripped to shreds.

I shook my head as though to dispel that hideous little voice breathing life into the thoughts I yearned to ignore.

“I don’t know.” I finally admitted, the words seeming to release some of the weight I always seemed to forget I was bearing.

“I don’t know anything.”

There was something in the way she looked at me upon hearing that, sympathy? Sadness? Guilt? I didn’t know what she had to feel guilty for, it was Janice who owed all of the answers.

“Well, take a seat,” she offered, gesturing at the bed, “There’s…there’s a lot.”

“It’s alright,” I said, doing my best to reject the offer politely without offending the only hope of information I had.

“I’ll be going soon.”

She winced at that. I felt a pang of sadness upon noticing. I couldn’t blame the woman for not wanting to be alone, not after what I suspect she may know.

“Suit yourself. Your wife, my Anson, they’re smart ones. Smarter than usual, the sort of smart that gets you noticed by people in charge.”

I couldn’t deny that. I’d always felt Janice could be working for NASA or the CIA or Harvard or something, I supposed I should have suspected something.

“The job they have, you don’t apply for. You get recruited. They work for America, you see?” A smile cracked across her ancient features, a genuine pride gleaming in her eyes.

Defense industry? I wondered.

It would explain the secrecy, and Janice was certainly smart enough to be working on some top-secret space jet. But no, that wouldn’t explain the thing in my house, it wouldn’t explain half of what I’d gone through. Unless it could…some new-age mind-altering gas? As awful as it seemed, I almost preferred it to the idea that reality as I knew it was something negotiable.

“So they - they make…bombs?” I asked, feeling stupid for the question though I wasn’t sure how else to ask it.

She looked taken aback.

“No, oh, no. You really don’t know? They study the real stuff. Protect us from the…other things.”

“Other things?” I asked, though I felt the creeping suspicion that I knew what some of those ‘other things’ were.

That I’d barely escaped from it with my life.

She nodded with such ferocity her head seemed ready to come loose.

“The bad ones. The things we all try to turn into stories to scare the children. The reason our ancestors were so scared of the dark.”

I felt something cold inside me at her words, like something old and dead lurching from the grave.

“Monsters?” I asked, feeling the word far too childish for the things I felt she was implicating.

A smile crept to her lips.

“Mhm. The work they do protects us from all of it, all of the things they can’t let us hear about. They keep the bad stuff away, keep the door shut. Except…”

The smile fell, replaced by a deep-set frown just as suddenly. Something about her choice of words, ‘keep the door shut’, it felt familiar. I recalled the awful crooning of the Janice-thing as it had chased me from my home, and the nightmare it returned from the recesses of my mind.

“Except?”

She looked troubled, which said a lot given her general state. Her brows furrowed, and another string of muttering followed as she seemed to argue whether she had said too much, debating with some unseen judge. Finally, seemingly winning her mental battle, she pressed on, though I could see that dark cloud still hanging across her features.

“Well, they - they realized, perhaps, we - we could be better helped if they opened it.”

“Opened…opened the door?” I asked.

The door to what? To the otherside, that little voice that had lurked with me all that day seemed to whisper. The other side of what? Reality? I wasn’t sure I wanted the answer, though my options seemed limited.

“The door to the other places. The places where the others live. The places that aren’t like this one.”

I could see a tremor working its way through her, her eyes roaming past me with the glassy sort of expression one would expect from a traumatized veteran. My stomach turned, the implications of her terror making me feel sick.

“You’re talking about those monsters,” I started heart strumming like a war drum as pieces of an awful puzzle began to take faint shape.

“Those…those things from the closet.”

Her eyes widened to such an extent they seemed ready to spring forth from her skull.

“Oh well, yes, but, no they aren’t. We thought so too, you see, my Anson - he was convinced they were coming to…to hurt us, to replace us all and steal something they lacked.”

She spoke the words at a feverish rate, stepping closer with eyes wide, quickly adding,

“But - but that’s not true, is it? No, they - they just want to help us. To show us another way.”

I could feel the vague haze starting to allow the faintest path to appear before me, the pieces slowly falling into place though leaving unignorable gaps. I pushed through her seemingly dementia-induced ramblings, desperate for answers.

“To steal what?” I asked.

If there was any reason that these things might have taken my wife, I needed to know. Whatever she had if I could…I don’t know, bargain maybe? It seemed a weak hope, but it was something.

She looked disturbed, as though the question had awoken her from some lovely daydream.

“The warmth,” she spoke, eyes narrowing as though it were the most obvious statement in the world.

“It's so cold where they come from, so cold - and the wind bites like starving dogs. They just want to be warm. Can’t you understand that?”

I recalled my nightmare, the bits of it that remained fresh in my mind though more were growing clearer. I remembered the doorway, the feeling of the cold, such cold like nothing I’d ever known, and the singular active thought - I need to get out, I need to get warm. I felt something stirring in my gut, like the movement of something alive. For a moment, I recalled Janice in the nights before it had all begun, all those nights of fitful sleep, stalked by nightmares she could never retain.

Or refused to share. I considered.

I began to grow the eerie suspicion I knew what she had been seeing all of those nights.

I nodded in response to Mrs. Aldridge’s question, though I surely didn’t understand. Though perhaps, it seemed, I was beginning to.

“Do - do the things from those places, can they affect dreams?” The question felt silly- vague and conspiratorial.

And yet, as I awaited the response of a seemingly mad old woman, I could tell that I’d never spoken of anything more serious.

“Dreams,” she repeated the word, gazing past me as though trying to recall its meaning.

“Dreams, yes. It’s - it’s the only way they can reach out to us. The only time our minds are open enough to hear them. Anson could tell you better I’m sure, he understood all the scientific whatsits better than I ever could.

“Why?” I asked, feeling a skincrawling sensation at the idea of my mind, my sleep invaded by those…things.

“Reach out for what?”

“Oh, I couldn’t hope to know that. I don’t think anyone could. Anson used to think -” she shook her head, “Well never mind that, he was wrong - he says so himself.”

“Used to think what?” I pressed, that nauseating feeling pushing me forth despite the woman's obvious discomfort with the topic.

I should have left it there. I should have thanked her for her time, and excused myself, putting Mrs. Aldridge’s home far behind me. But I didn’t. I suppose the result would have been the same either way.

The flow of information, as choppy and confused as it was, was the closest thing I’d had to answers since the day began, and I found the faint clarity almost intoxicating.

“Well, it’s, it's not true. I swear, but…he used to think it was a way to - to weaken us. Get inside the mind and twist it up so they could track us down like a,” she snapped, attempting to recollect the word,

“Like a GPS, and lure us in.”

Her words seemed to lower the temperature in the air by several degrees.

“Lure us where?” I asked.

“To their place. Through the doors and into the snow.”

I felt something cold and sharp in my gut, like an icy dagger twisting itself deep.

‘Through the door, through the door, you’ll cling to the devil for warmth, through the door.’

The odd song of the thing that had worn my wife’s face seemed all the more threatening now.

It seemed that the dread I felt was written across my face. Mrs. Aldridge stepped forward, raising a hand in a placating gesture.

“It’s - it's not true. I promise, Anson promises, it's not true at all. He - he misunderstood them, don’t you see?” She spoke like some passionate Southern pastor preaching the gospel, a conviction that seemed almost divine woven into every word. She placed a hand on my shoulder, a comforting gesture in theory, though it made my skin crawl.

“They need us, they need our help, don’t be scared.”

I shook my head, something in me feeling the need to push back against the woman’s rhetoric. I knew it was foolish given how unstable she seemed, but the way she tried to paint those creatures…as though they were helpless, it was wrong. Worse than that, I knew it could get her killed. It occurred to me, perhaps for the first time with such clarity, that in all my time in the house, I hadn't seen hide nor hair of this Anson, outside of pictures. In fact, I was quite certain he was dead. So that begs the question?

“How do you know this, Mrs. Aldridge?” I asked.

“My Anson told me. He told me what lies through the doorway…isn’t it wonderful?”

Her words were like being doused in ice water, jarring and sudden, snapping me back into the present.

I peered past her, glancing about the room for any sign of something out of place, before realizing the futility of my effort in an unfamiliar environment. All of a sudden, I just wanted to leave - to be as far from that place as I could - but to go where?

Through the door. It was a thought whispered from the dark recesses of my mind, though I found the thought lingering stubbornly.

“The closet,” I muttered, realization sparking to life in me.

The closet door. I felt like an idiot as the thoughts connected, in all the terror, missing what now seemed so obvious.

I’d known, subconsciously anyway, that animal sense that lingers from our days hiding from the predators that stalked the darkness always shrieking for me to stay away. Suddenly, I felt I had some idea of where Janice might be, or at least, where I’d have to go to find her. Through the doors, through the closet doors where that dark feeling seemed to shoot forth like a newly discovered spring.

Mrs. Aldridge’s eyes widened in surprise, her grip on my shoulder growing tighter.

“You mustn’t be afraid boy,” she breathed, still gazing up at me with that fanatic sort of glee.

“I promise. It’s not so bad, they only want to show us. He promised.”

I felt that knot in my chest grows impossibly tight.

“When did he tell you this, Mrs. Aldridge? When did Anson tell you these things?”

“Well, just before you arrived, of course.”

My eyes widened, breaking her gaze as I stared past her and into the open doorway. The implications of her words began to unravel, scratching the back of my mind aggressively as one awful thought began to ring out.

I hadn’t checked the closet door when I’d entered. I wasn’t sure if the lock was still engaged.

As if in confirmation of my most awful fears, from somewhere beyond the threshold of the doorway, within the darkness that hung like a blindfold, there was the faint, but unmistakable creak of movement against ancient floorboards.

Someone…something else was in the house with us.
