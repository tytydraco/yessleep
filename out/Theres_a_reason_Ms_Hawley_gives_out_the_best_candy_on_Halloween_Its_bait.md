“I'm glad we're finally rid of him,” I said to Luis as we trudged back out from the forest and towards the park. 

The “him” in question was a kid called Vern. Vern was born with a complete lack of self awareness, and used this power to be an unlikable slob to anyone he met. He looked like the type of kid who'd been bullied severely, when really, you guessed it, it's him doing the bullying. He wormed his way into our friend group for the night like an ingested parasite. We'd been loitering around the school trying to figure out how to toilet-paper a building of its magnitude. It was an imposing structure of red brick and spires, originally founded as a hospital during the civil war. Not even Casey, the jewel of the school's baseball team, could manage to throw a roll successfully over the roof. Shortly after giving up, we unfortunately bumped into Vern who was likewise loitering around the school grounds on Halloween night. He wore a skin tight spiderman morph suit, which did not suit his large build. I'm being polite when I use the word large. For the past hour or two, he'd been following us around town, trying to be funny while stealing little kids’ candy. 

We had found another spot to loiter, the broken down gazebo at the edge of the park. The six of us went wild, high of sugar and the freedom of being out late at night. That's probably why when we saw Eric, a scrawny little ball of nerves from our school, we pounced like a pack of feral dogs. As soon as the runt noticed us, he turned and ran in the direction of the forest. All six of us gave chase, intent on looting his bulging bucket of candy. I had to drop my cardboard machete that completed my Jason Voorhees costume, but made a mental note of where it was so I could retrieve it after the robbery. We passed the treeline not long after Eric did and carried on into the dark woods. The tree stood tall and thick, and blotted out much of the steady moonlight. It was a challenge to not fall victim to the many tangled roots while I kept this pace. Thankfully, we soon heard a clatter. The pumpkin-shaped bucket of candy had fallen to the forest's floor, spilling out its sweet contents. Most of us stopped then to raid the pile, thankful for a moment of rest. Only Vern and Earnest continued their pursuit of Eric, intent on giving out an extra serving of embarrassment.

Russ gestured to us to grab what we could and get out. I soon realised he was planning on deserting Vern, and I was all for it. Losing Earnest would be some unfortunate collateral damage, but we could make it up to him. I scooped up what goodies I could into my own bag and ran off out of the forest with the rest of my friends. Eventually, we hit the road and continued down the sidewalk. I came across my makeshift machete, now covered in dirt, and slid it back into my belt. 

“Did you get any tootsie rolls?” Luis asked me as we walked.

“A few,” I replied. 

“Could I have them?” He asked. 

“For what?” I answered. 

Luis sighed and rummaged around his pillowcase of candy. After a while of digging around, he pulled out a large bag of marshmallows.

“For this?” said Luis.

“Hell yeah man,” I said, taking the marshmallows from him and passing over my own trick of treat bag for him to pick any tootsie rolls he could find out of. 

“Woah, what house did you get those from?” Casey asked, eyeing up the bag of marshmallows.

 I looked at Luis who answered; “Ms Hawley's house. She gives out great stuff guys, it must cost her a fortune.”

“When did we pass by her?” Russ asked.

“I went there as I was walking over to your house, she lives, like, right by me.” Luis replied. 

We gave a collective nod, followed by a moment of silence. Suddenly, Casey stopped us. We all stood and looked at him, waiting for him to speak. I noticed a familiar glint in his eye which only came out when he was planning something that encroached on illegality.

“Want to do a treasure hunt?” He asked us all.

“A what?” Russ asked as I connected the dots in my mind.

“OK, so,” Casey began, “you know how when people like Ms Hawley buy candy for Halloween, they plan on giving it out for free? Well, it's not theft if it's free.”

Russ started nodding enthusiastically. Casey continued. 

“So my plan is this - we knock on her door and keep her distracted while one of us sneaks around the back of her house, into her kitchen and makes off with the stockpile of candy she has back there.”

Russ seemed up for it, as was I. Luis was more apprehensive. 

“Isn't that a bit, like, wrong?” Luis asked Casey.

“What about is wrong?” Casey answered with a question, “she's gonna give it all away anyway.”

We started walking down another street, which was a mess of orange and black. Decorations clung to every tree, smothering some of them. A nine-foot tall plastic skeleton stood in front of the recognisable house of Gary, our Sunday school teacher. In fact, his whole garden had been turned into a makeshift graveyard. I realised we were only a block away from Luis's house, which meant we must be nearing where Ms Hawley lives. It occurred to me then that we would actually be going through with Casey's plan, as we usually do.

“Do guys even know what happened to Ms Hawley?” Luis asked us all.

We looked his way, waiting for him to continue. 

“Her husband and son died in a car crash this summer,” he told us, “that's only, like, four months ago.”

This was a bombshell, or at least I thought so. Russ and especially Casey seemed less swayed by this information. 

“That…,” Casey faltered, “doesn't matter.”

We spent the rest of the short journey to Ms Hawley's house bickering. As we made our way down the sidewalk, we reached a decision - the plan was to go ahead. The final condition that Luis reluctantly agreed to was that it would be Casey doing the candy snatching. That way, Casey dutifully said, “you guys won't get any of the guilt.” 

We finally arrived at Ms Hawley's house not long after. It was a typical suburban family home, encircled by whitepicket fences and a neatly trimmed hedgerow. We stood at the beginning of the paved walkway that led to her front door. Casey explained the plan to us using hand gestures he'd learnt from TV. He then gave us a thumbs up, slid the skull mask down from his black hood over his face and crouched, making his way to the side of her house. Russ and I hurried up the raised porch to the front door while Luis hung back a bit. I knocked, and almost immediately the door swung open. Ms Hawley stood on the other side, holding a neon plastic bowl of candy. She was in her late thirties and had messy hair and clothes to match. Her skin was coated in freckles, and the only thing that hinted at the broken woman underneath was the black bags under her sleepless eyes. She looked at the three of us and smiled. 

“Oh, aren't you three just the cutest!” She exclaimed, and then pointed at Russ, “who are you meant to be?”

“A werewolf,” Russ answered. Ms Hawley's finger moved to point at me. 

“Jason Voorhees,” I said, and then when I didn't see any recognition in her eyes, “you know, from the Friday the 13th films. Not all of them actually, did you know he wasn't…”

Russ punched me in the shoulder, killing my impending rant before it even started. Ms Hawley smiled even wider, if that was possible, and turned to Luis who remained at the bottom step. 

“And you?” she asked him. 

He begrudgingly made his way up to stand next to us. 

“Dr Who,” He replied sheepishly. 

“What darling costumes you all have," the young widow said, then presented us with the bowl of candy, “here, take as much as you like.” 

Each with a twang of guilt and self disgust, three hands dived into the bowl and looted it for all it was worth. Once our bags were full, Ms Hawley said goodbye and went to close the door. Remembering our whole purpose was to act as a diversion, I acted quickly. 

“Wait!” I said.
 
Ms Hawley opened the door fully again and looked at me, puzzled. Before I could think of an excuse, Luis interjected. 

“Nothing! Have a nice night,” He said to Ms Hawley and half led, half dragged us away from her front step. The door closed behind us and we made our way back down to the edge of her garden. 

“What the hell man!?” I asked Luis once we were out of presumed earshot, “what about Casey?”

“Fuck him!” Luis replied angrily. I'd never really seen him like that before. What followed was a while of silence while Luis and I waited for Casey to reappear, and Russ stuffed his face. 

But he didn't. Fifteen or more minutes had passed and still no sign of him. The three of us grew worried, jumping to the obvious conclusion that Casey had been caught in the act. We waited for Ms Hawley to drag him out by his ear, for him to walk held low towards us and for Luis to say “I told you so” for the rest of the night. But that didn't happen. It was getting late by the time we decided to act. Lights were off and curtains were drawn all down the block. I hadn't seen another trick or treater in god knows how long, and the only company we had was the crowds of pumpkins that seemed to infest this street in particular. Halloween night was coming to an end, and we had now spent a considerable part of it crouching behind a bush. Russ was the first to volunteer. 

“I'm gonna go look for him,” He said heroically. 

Neither Luis nor I argued with him. We watched as he dropped his almost empty bag of candy before he began to sneak down the side of Ms Hawley's house and off into her backyard. From my hiding spot, I could see that most of her backyard was occupied by a large wooden shed that almost looked like a log cabin had been dropped into her garden. I leaned over to Luis and joked that the only reason Russ volunteered was that he was afraid Casey was trying to keep Ms Hawley's candy for himself. We laughed, and waited for Casey and Russ to return, assumedly with a funny story to tell. But, after yet more waiting, there was still no sign. The clouds had cleared now and the bizarrely bright crescent moon shone overhead. With the little light afforded, I scanned every inch of Ms Hawley's home. There was no movement, and hadn't been since Russ had snuck behind the building.

“Can we just go home?” Luis asked. 

“No way man, we have to wait for Casey and Russ,” I replied. 

“But I'm tired!” He argued. 

There was silence as I thought of a plan. Once I'd perfected it in my mind, I told Luis. 

“Ok,” I began, “here's what you do. Go up to her front door and knock. When she answers, try and see how angry she is. If she's fuming, she probably caught Casey and Russ and is making them wait for their parents. If she seems ok, then those two bastards probably made off with the candy themselves. Got it?”

Luis nodded slowly. 

“Hey, why can't you do it?” He asked. 

“If you do this, you can go straight home afterwards” I said.

“Fine,” said Luis, and then “What if she recognises me?” 

I handed him my hockey mask. Since wearing it hurt my nose, it spent most of the night in my trick-or-treating bag with the candy. He took it from me and peeled off some of the wrappers which had become stuck to it. Once clean, he pulled the strap back over his head and slid the mask up. He gave me a thumbs up and told me to guard his bag of candy, and that he'd know if I took anything from it. I crossed my heart and swore I wouldn't, then watched as he made his way back up to her front door. I saw him knock, and after some time of waiting, the door opened once again. Ms Hawley stood on the other side. I squinted, but couldn't make out her expression from this distance. Away she started to talk to Luis in a quiet voice, nothing I could make out. I looked down at Luis’ bag and opened it. It was full to the brim. I studied its contents for anything that might catch my fancy. Just as I spied a box of milk duds, a loud thud made my head snap up. The front door to Ms Hawley's house had slammed shut. I couldn't see Luis anywhere. Not long after, the porch light turned off. 

Shit. I was now on my own after midnight, cowering behind a hedge. The air felt cold, colder than it had been just a minute before. The ambience of the night now felt hostile. Every cry of a bird made my head whip around in fright. Looking around at the nearby houses, I thought of going and asking for help. But what would I say? Help, my friends and I were trying to rob a grieving woman and now I think they might've been caught? I was on my own, and not just because the streets were deserted. From where I hid, I more closely examined Ms Hawley's house. There wasn't a single light turned on, and no other signs of life that I could make out. I took a deep breath in, knowing what I should do. I begrudgingly left my trick-or-treat bag with the others and crouch-walked through the small garden, keeping close to the hedge as Casey had down. Suddenly, I felt something slender and cold grab my exposed ankle. I fell in a heap and spun around on the ground to try and see my attacker. A yellow hose pipe was looped around my foot. I stood up, then patted myself down. I remembered what I was doing and quickly crouched back down. I turned to look at the large window on the side of the house just in time to see the drawn curtains ruffle. Had someone been looking out?

I felt the pit in my stomach grow. Cautiously, I made my way forward to her backyard. Her backyard was dominated by the large, wooden shed that, with a lick of paint, could've been repurposed as a guesthouse. I got to the end of her house and peeped around the corner. The wall carried down a few yards, then turned in a L shape to face me again. Directly across from where I hid was the back door. This rarely seen part of her home felt dilapidated, a far cry from the picturesque exterior. The grass here was brown and dying, spread out between sickly patches of earth. It was dark, with only a crescent moon illuminating the cloudless sky, but I could've sworn I saw something strange. Something was seeping from under the door to the shed. Something thick and foul. I heard a creak and twisted my view away from the shed. The backdoor had opened. 

The featureless doorway seemed to be composed of pure blackness. I couldn't make out anything but shadow, but the closer I looked, the more I could make out. It soon became clear that I was looking directly at someone, although all I could see was the silhouette of their boots as they stood on the first step down. My first bout of trembles set in.

“Luis?” I asked in a broken voice. No reply. 

“Russ?” I asked quietly. No reply. 

“Casey?” I asked in little more than a whisper. No reply. 

Suddenly, the figure in the doorway bolted. My heart pounded in my chest, certain of its impending death as it commanded me to run faster than I thought possible. I heard metal scrape against the wall as whatever the figure held in their hands was raised. My body, little more than an amalgam of frightened nerves, barely managed a few steps. The hose pipe that lay like a snake in the grass tripped me up, sending me flying. I fell in a heap and spun around on the ground to try and see my attacker. The figure, still just a featureless shadow in the darkness, raised its blunt weapon and brought it crashing down on my skull. 

The place I woke up in smelled of sulphur and was unbearably hot. For a second, I thought my Sunday school teacher had been right when he told us that we could go to hell for things as mundane as petty theft. I felt a wetness coating my legs and in my groggy, barely lucid state I thought my bladder had given out. As I started to become aware of my surroundings I realised the liquid coating my lower half was blood, and not my own. I tried to move my arms, but soon realised my wrists were bound. My neck, which had buckled from the impact of the shovel, clicked as I turned my head. Slouched against me was Luis. Clearly, he had been struck with more force as his forehead had caved in. His jaw was slack and his eyes were rolled upwards. I was in the shed, judging from the tool-covered interior. It was hard to determine just how vast it was, as much of the floor space was taken by the largest pumpkin I had ever seen. 

What had first appeared as just an orange blur in my vision quickly took shape. The pumpkin was simply huge, around seven feet tall not including the twisting, green root. Its skin was hard and rough, full of notches and what I could only describe as pustules. The floor beneath it was torn up, revealing soil. Vines sprouted from the giant vegetable, which climbed across every inch of the shed. The wooden walls were draped in them, the floor too, although I could barely make them out submerged in all that blood. The more I stared at the floor vines, the more they seemed to pulsate in the filth, lapping it up like a thirsty dog. Luis’ head wound began to spew onto my shoulder again, and I turned to push him away. As my vision fully returned, I realised there were more people in here with me than just what was left of Luis. Russ sat on the other side of him in a similar condition. Casey lay on the floor, partially covered in vines. His neck, wrists and other arteries had been cut uncleanly. Standing over him was Ms Hawley. Her suburbanite apparel was dripping in my friends’ blood. She held a rusting hacksaw in one hand as she nervously rocked back and forth, bending double before standing upright, over and over again. She was wittering to herself like a schizophrenic. 

“Feed… return… please,” She said to herself. 

Her words were laboured. They were spoken as though they caused her physical pain. Maybe they did. Suddenly she turned, and I snapped my eyes shut. I tapered my breathing and tried to fit in with the rest of my friends, which wasn't hard with a deep gash on my forehead. A stabbing sensation of white hot pain came in waves, enveloping my skull. It was the worst headache of my life. As I pretended to be a corpse, I heard Ms Hawley move. I risked a glance, and saw her dragging Russ’ body by his hair towards the pumpkin. I stifled a scream as she used the hacksaw to slit his throat, then dragged it down his forearms to his wrists. She let the body slump as the blood pooled and the vines fed. I kept watching as she suddenly pressed herself against the giant pumpkin, trying to wrap her arms around it. When she couldn't, she burst into tears and collapsed to her knees. She turned suddenly, and I scrunched my eyes shut once again. I knew she could tell I was alive. My rapidly raising chest and dog-like whimpers betrayed me. Still, I tried to become a rag doll, even as the rusting gardening tools propped against the corner behind me started to dig into my back. The pain of their sharp ends was nothing compared to the pain that would surely be inflicted on me if I caught her attention.

 I felt a weight be lifted from me as Luis was dragged away. I didn't look this time, but from the sounds of jagged metal tearing through flesh, I knew that he was facing the same fate as Russ. I couldn't help it. I looked. The boils that dotted the pumpkin's deep orange skin had started to crackle and pop, bursting in small explosions of pus and slime. The vines danced and writhed, making the floor look like an open wound of festering maggots. As I watched, I began dragging the plastic cord that bound my wrists against the metal tool behind me. I noticed that what had once been a small pool of blood was now nothing more than a large, grimy brown stain. The pumpkin had drunk its share, and by the looks of things, it had now been fed enough.  Ms Hawley began to cry again, this time shedding tears of joy. The giant vegetable's flesh now seemed paper thin. I could make out a dark figure moving within. It was like watching someone sprint towards you from behind an orange-tinted frosted window. 

The entire front half of the pumpkin exploded. I was covered head to toe in yellow gunk, as was Ms Hawley. When I saw what had crawled from inside the organic cavity, I quickened the pace of my wrists against the almost dull blade. I watched the figure as it stood and stretched itself out. It was grotesque in a way my comprehension barely stretched to include. It had the features of a corpse. The more I stared in horror, the more certain I became that that was all it was. Across its body, areas that had rotted away were now packed tightly with new, unnaturally brown flesh. Stringy yellow tendrils covered its body. I thought it was from the pumpkin's guts, but soon realised it was growing from, or rather within, its body and stretched out just under the new skin like creeping mycelium. From every open gash dripped a steady flow of pumpkin seeds. The amalgam seemed to me composed of the flesh of a pumpkin and of two corpses. A second, much smaller body grew out from the chest of the other like a parasitic twin. It moaned and flayed its right arm. The left arm of both corpses were one, and where their hands should've been was occupied by a third, connective joint. The face of the parasite was little more than a skull, while the others had been fully regrown. Ms Hawley collapsed forward and hugged it as best she could. 

“My boys, you've come back to me!” she said in a voice of pure elation. 

The human-like face of the main body looked down at her with its one bloodshot eye. One of its arms wrapped around her, the other smaller arm of what had once been her son attempted a hug, but failed to reach the fingertips of its father. For a moment, the embrace seemed loving. I didn't know how she could bear the smell. But soon, she was starting to cry out in pain rather than joy. I noticed how forcefully the amalgam's hands appeared to be digging into her, just beneath the shoulder blades. She began to squirm and scream in fear, begging her family to stop. Puke dribbled down my chin as their fingers sank into her flesh. Seconds later, her ribcage came tearing out through her back in a torrent of blood, caking me in yet another rancid liquid. Her screams ended then, but mine had just begun. The constraints finally snapped against the billhook I had been cutting them against. I got to my feet, a moment of physical exertion which drained me far more than it should've. To my surprise, the shed door opened with ease. I suppose Ms Hawley didn't expect any of her victims to make a run for it. 

Plunging into the cool night air was like a rebirth. I tore my ruined clothes from me as I half ran, half limped down the garden. The pain that found its home in every inch of my body was excruciating. I felt like collapsing and curling into a ball, but my basic will to survive carried me forward. I heard a crash as the front half of the shed splintered open. My neck cracked and clicked as I looked over my shoulder. The amalgam had burst out of the hellish shack and had begun crossing the short distance towards me. I started to scream out as I reached the sidewalk, desperately trying to reach the attention of anyone. I staggered into the road, and cried out as something slammed into my back. I slammed down onto the asphalt, feeling the joint of my left shoulder slip out of place as I did. Dragging myself on the sidewalk with my less injured arm, I turned to see the amalgam walking slowly toward me. The skinless face of the parasitic child protruding from its chest had begun to regrow. Its jaws snapped and clattered, eager to be fertilised by more blood. I looked around for help. Lights were starting to come on in all the surrounding houses. Still, no one took that extra step of coming to my aid. 

I closed my eyes. My mind as well as body had given up. Seconds from death, I heard an engine buzz. Despite the heaviness of my eyelids, I managed to open them and look. The amalgam stood in the road just feet away. It's long, slime covered arm of rot reached towards me. It was suddenly illuminated by a car's headlamps. Moments before its putrid hand grasped my face, a red sports car slammed into it, sending bits of organic debris flying in every direction. The car screeched to a halt a few yards from where it had struck the monster. A teen got around, running his hands through his hair in panic. 

“What the fuck was that!?” He shouted to himself. 

He spotted me and ran to my side. He was soon followed by an old woman from the house whose front yard I'd dragged myself onto. They helped me to my feet, and the old woman led me into her home to wait for an ambulance. The last thing I remember clearly of that night, which claimed the lives of all my friends, just before she shut the door behind us was the teen shouting once again. 

“Where did it go!?”
