(Using a burner so I donâ€™t ruin my own life)

I never believed in the Illuminati or secret societies. That was until I became a detective in Hollywood.

Assigned to investigate a string of high-profile heists, I found myself hitting a dead end. That is until I received a tip from an informant.

He told me about a group of magicians and propagandists known as the "Florist Friars." They were a group of avant-garde artists and businessmen who used a Robin Hood philosophy to make media to promote the individual freedoms of their audience against the tyranny of big tech and big media. They used their knowledge and resources to influence Hollywood's politics and economy to their advantage and to fight against the corruption and criminal activity of the Illuminati in the name of the common man.

Skeptical at first, I found myself diving deeper into the case. I soon realized that the Florist Friars were the only ones making any real progress against the Illuminati. With their help, we were able to infiltrate the inner circles and gather valuable intelligence.

But that was just the beginning. The secrets I uncovered during this case have stayed with me to this day. The true nature of the Illuminati and the Florist Friars is more sinister than you could ever imagine.

The Illuminati's reach was far greater than I ever envisioned. They controlled everything from the media to the government, pulling the strings behind the scenes to maintain their power and influence.

I soon realized that the Florist Friars were the only ones brave enough to stand up against them. They used their knowledge of magic and propaganda to infiltrate the Illuminati's inner circles, gathering valuable intelligence and using it to fight back against their nefarious plans.

But the Florist Friars weren't just fighting a battle against the Illuminati, they were also fighting a battle against time. The Illuminati were always one step ahead, always watching, always waiting for the opportunity to strike.

One night, as I sat with the Florist Friars, planning our next move, we received word that the Illuminati had uncovered our operation. We were compromised. We had to act fast if we wanted to survive.

We quickly devised a plan to infiltrate the Illuminati's stronghold and take them down once and for all. It was a risky move, but we had no other choice.

With the Florist Friars by my side, I infiltrated the stronghold and uncovered a network of tunnels and secret rooms that led deep into the heart of the Illuminati's operations. We found evidence of their dark rituals and twisted experiments. We found proof of their plans to control the world's population through mind control and manipulation.

But as we were about to make our escape, we were ambushed by the Illuminati's guards. We were outnumbered and outgunned, but the Florist Friars fought bravely, using their knowledge of magic to turn the tide of the battle.

The Florist Friars' ultimate weapon in the fight against the Illuminati was a comedy film that they released. The film was a satire that exposed the Illuminati's true nature and their nefarious plans to the public. It went viral, and the public finally saw the truth. The movie was a huge success, and it played a vital role in the ultimate downfall of the Illuminati.

The Florist Friars continue to fight against the Illuminati and other secret societies to this day. If you want to know more about their ongoing battle, check out their YouTube channel or website. They use comedy films to fight the Illuminati and share their message. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. www.youtube.com/@floristfriars/ or www.friars.florist/
