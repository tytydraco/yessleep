After showing Ruth where I’d spotted Winifred on the map, we determined there was only one place she could’ve been heading to: a remote spot near the edge of the park called Dancer’s Dell. It was on the south side of the creek, astronomically less convenient to reach than the northern one, where the trail climbed to the Upper Loop.

Ruth led the way up the switchback to Trestle Pass, where Beckett’s Gulch became a full-blown canyon. From father down the trail, the bridge looked like a wall of criss-crossing toothpicks, reaching up some thousand feet from the riverbed to the top of the craggy cliff-side. Every time I saw it, I always thought of those western films, where the hero has to stop the train from falling off the broken bridge.

“Haven’t been back here in a while,” Ruth said. It was her first attempt at starting a conversation since we left the lodge. For most of the hike, I’d been ruminating on the poster, and what the future might hold for me. But that wasn’t the full reason for my silence; keeping up with Ruth had me sucking wind.

“Don’t think I’ve ever been,” Was all I could manage without wheezing.

She cast a concerned glance over her shoulder. “You okay back there?”

“Fine, thanks.” I sucked down greedy gulps of air, taking in the crisp scent of pine. Somewhere close by, a falcon screeched. It must’ve made its nest on the nearby cliff side.

Ruth stopped walking. “Alright, this is it.” I heard the hesitation in her voice.  The bridge looked even less sturdy up close. Weathered planks spanned the gaps between support struts. Waist-high wooden railings bowed outward from use. The bridge was narrow enough, I could’ve reached out my arms and held both at once; not that I was crazy enough to put any weight on them.

“They ah, someone comes out to inspect these once in a while right?” I asked.

“Yeah, I’m sure.” She didn’t sound confident.

The bridge groaned in protest under every step, as if it were some slumbering beast, and we were disturbing its rest.

Pine trees reached up toward us like slender green fingers, competing for limited sunlight at the bottom of the canyon. I swallowed, and tried to refrain from looking down again.

Upon reaching the opposite bank, I realized I’d been holding my breath the entire walk.

Ruth stood by a sign post, tapping her foot. “You’re sure she was headed downriver?”

“Course.”

Ruth gave a nod of acknowledgment, and took the right fork.

When we arrived at the edge of Dancer’s Dell, the sun had sunken to the horizon. The twisting trees behind the valley’s namesake cast weird shadows over the brilliant blue flowers that carpeted the ground. Our path was the rocky ghost of a long dead stream, since reclaimed by lichen and moss.

Cottonwood seeds drifted through the air like confetti at a wilding party.

I sneezed.

“Bless you,” Ruth said.

“Thanks,” I replied.

I’d almost forgotten that I wasn’t alone. The whole valley felt like a surreal dream, where the trees swayed to the invisible rhythm of the evening breeze. They beckoned us deeper with waving branches, and we followed.

As shadows overtook the valley and last light disappeared over the hillside, a new light glowed through the trees, just up the eastern embankment. The unmistakable sound of crackling flames met my ears. A woman’s grunting, and the splintering of splitting wood occasionally punctuated the ambiance. Her camp must’ve been just beyond our line of sight.

Ruth left the path and  started toward it.

“Wait!” I caught her arm. “Shouldn’t we say something? You know, announce ourselves so we don’t startle her?”

“It’s a public park. People stumble on each other’s sites all the time in the dark. What would you even say?”

The wood chopping stopped. “Hello? Who’s there—I hear you!”

I tilted my head and put my hands on my hips. “See?” I mouthed.

Ruth furrowed her brow and repeated her question, much quieter this time. “What would you say?” Even in her hushed tone, I could hear the urgency behind the question. She wasn’t just disproving—she hadn’t thought this through.

Luckily, I had. “Winifred, you up there?”

Ruth punched me in the arm. Not a playful jab either; this was a full on wallop that sent me staggering a couple steps back down the hill.

“How do you know my name? Who are you?”

Ruth clamped her hand over my mouth. “I thought you were stupid but this?” She hissed. “How are you going to explain that you know her name without even seeing her?”

She thought I was stupid?

I pried her fingers off my face.

“First of all—“ I held up my hand and began ticking off fingers, “She already may recognize my voice from this afternoon. Second, how were you planning on breaking the ice? ‘A piece of paper from the future told me you’re in danger?’ And third—“

“Answer me, dammit!” Winifred shouted.

Ruth folded her arms and cocked an eyebrow, almost daring me to come up with a solution.

“Miss, I’m Bert Cypress. I’m a park attendant. Someone turned in your license at the front desk. You must’ve dropped it on your way out of the Visitor’s Center,” I lied. “Thought I spotted you heading this way earlier. Figured I’d do the right thing and return it.”

“You came all the way out here, alone?” She was skeptical, still. Ruth touched my arm and shook her head.

“Ah, no. I’m here with the ranger.”

Ruth smacked forehead and mouthed something I couldn’t quite make out in the dark.

“Well what are you skulking around for?”

I crested the hill before Ruth could protest.

Winifred’s camp wasn’t much to speak of. A large fire lapped away at logs in its stone ring, sending up cinders into the violet sky. The woman had gathered and split a ridiculous quantity of firewood. Logs had piled up almost as high as her faded blue tent, pitched about a dozen paces off. What I didn’t see, was Winifred herself.

“Hello?” I called out. “Miss?”

“A driver’s license, really?”

I spun on the spot. Winifred was behind me, walking Ruth into the clearing. I wasn’t sure which looked sharper, the glare the ranger was giving me, or the bowie knife being held at her throat.

“All I had to do was pat myself down to figure out you were lying.”

“I—that’s a forest ranger! You can’t—we’re here to help you,” I stammered through my sentence, fumbling for a line that would work.

“I don’t believe you,” Winifred said. “How do you really know my name? Why are you following me?”

A lot had apparently changed during the last few hours. Maybe it was a trick of the light, but the dark circles under her wild eyes looked much, much closer to the missing poster. Something had clearly spooked her.

“We’re here to help you.”

“Yeah, so you said.” Winifred adjusted her grip, pinching Ruth’s skin with the blade. The look of paranoia on her face would either be my in, or Ruth’s end.

“Listen, we’ve been dealing with some… problems, in the park. Suspicious activity.” I opted for a line that was part truth, and half Hail-Mary: “I found a piece of paper with your name and picture on it, in one of the other campsites. Looked threatening.” I took a chance, and a step closer. “Winifred, is someone after you?”

She held her composure for a moment before her lip trembled. Winifred dropped the knife in the dirt. Ruth broke away, scrambling to get out of arm’s reach. But when she turned and saw her captor crying, she paused.

“Hey,” she offered in a gentle tone. “What’s going on?”

“Not here, too,” Winifred managed between choked sobs. “He can’t be here too.”

“Who is he?” Ruth asked.

“Few weeks ago—the phone calls—my fiance, he didn’t believe me,” she raved.

“The guy on the phone, what did he sound like?” I asked.

Winifred took a few shallow breaths, on the verge of hyperventilating. “The voice was all static. Distorted. But I could tell it was saying words, I don’t—” she stopped herself and let out a long sigh. “You think I’m crazy, too.”

“You’re not crazy. I’ve heard him too.”

“You have?”

“Yeah. He told me—” I looked to Ruth, at a loss for how much I should actually share. She gave me a subtle nod. “He told me something vague about my future.”

Ruth moved closer.

“Did it come true?” Winifred asked.

“Yes.” I regretted the word as soon as it left my lips and saw the color fall from her face. “Wait, what did the voice tell you?”

“That he would find me. No matter where I hid.” She broke down again.

Ruth reached out a comforting hand. “Let’s sit, okay? We can talk about this. We can help.”

I found a few logs Winifred hadn’t gotten around to splitting just yet, and arranged them around the fire. By the time we were sitting down, the sky had faded to total darkness. It was as if the world beyond the edges of the clearing simply ceased to exist.

Ruth broke the uneasy silence: “Did you try telling anyone about the calls?”

Winifred nodded. “My fiancé.”

“And?”

“There’s this creep in our neighborhood. We thought it was him for a while. Filed a police report. But nothing had actually happened. They just took a statement.”

“Wait, what about the calls?” I asked. “Couldn’t they have looked into that?”

“James thought the same thing. We checked with the phone company, and they told us weren’t getting any. No record of ‘em at all,” she said. “That’s when he started looking at me like I was crazy. Said I was too stressed. Between my job and the wedding planning…” she trailed off. “But I know what I heard. What I’m hearing.” She sniffled.

Winifred looked between Ruth and myself, like she expected us to be laughing or something. When she saw we both were leaning in, hanging on her every word, she continued. “I came here to  get away from all the phone calls. Figured whoever was doing all this wouldn’t follow me three states over.”

“Makes sense,” I reasoned. “But I take it that wasn’t the end of it? Or you wouldn’t be so jumpy.”

She looked off into the fire like it was a thousand miles away. “I got away from the phone calls and the static. But here, there’s a new voice.” She looked up at me across the flames. “Your voice.”

A weight lifted off my shoulders. There was an explanation: I’d startled her on the trail. Caught a stalking victim at a terrible, terrible time. “That may have just been bad luck,” I said. “I spotted you across the gulch earlier. Tried to tell out.”

“Not yelling.” Winifred shook her head. “Whispering. It’s like the thing in the static, only now it’s in the wind, and it’s got your voice.” There wasn’t an ounce of doubt or uncertainty behind the accusation. She spoke it with absolute conviction.

Ruth leaned toward her on the petrified log. “Do you hear it now?”

“Yes.” Her voice was barely audible over the crackling fire. “Can’t you?”

A gust of air moved through the dell, shaking the leaves, and setting the valley’s dancers in motion. I strained my ears, focusing, listening for anything.

There was no voice I could discern.

So why was my hair standing on end? Goosebumps sprouted down my arms. Some primal sense lost to the ages, awakened in the back of my mind. There was no panting, snarling or stomping; yet I felt a presence looming over me. I fought the urge as long as I could, before whipping my head around.

Nothing but the dark.

“You heard it? You heard it too?” There was desperation in Winifred’s voice.

“No,” I chewed on the word. “I feel it.”

A breeze moved through the trees and around the edge of the firelight like a prowling mountain lion. Maybe this wasn’t a breeze at all? Every instinct I had told me something was moving in the dark.

“Uh, Ruth?”

“I feel it too.”

“I knew it.” Winifred got to her feet, a manic smile flitting across her face. “I’m not crazy. It’s here. Something is here, and it’s not just in my head.”

I tried tracking the motion with my gaze but felt somehow dissuaded, like my body didn’t understand how to obey the commands from my brain. Looking into the trees behind Winifred was like trying to bring together two magnets of matching polarity.

It wasn’t until I placed a hand on each side of my face and physically guided my head, that I could bring myself to look into that section of forest.

“What on earth are you doing?” Ruth asked.

Winifred answered for me: “It doesn’t want him to see.”

I saw… nothing; only the vague outline of trees, vines, and wild undergrowth.

Then I tilted my head up, and a surge of adrenaline flooded my veins.

I locked eyes with the stalker. They hovered near the canopy, burning with an amber glow. They were enormous, with wide pupils and thick, drooping lids; as if their owner was both exhausted and irate.

There was a rush of air, an appendage swinging from the dark, and an impact that knocked me off my feet.

The campfire vanished in a puff of scattering cinders.

I remember confusion, more than anything else; with so little information about what I faced, my brain couldn’t decide what it thought stood before me. There was fur-or maybe hair? Could it be a grizzly, splayed on its belly?

No, absurd.

A giant tarantula?

Even more ridiculous.

Ruth shook me from my confusion. “Move!” She grabbed me beneath my arms, dragging me away from the thing. I pushed off with my heels, trying to get my legs under me.

The unknown mass stood between us and Winifred, moving slowly. She stared at it, paralyzed by fear.

I realized what the entity was when its twin appeared: an enormous hand covered in long, matted hair. It reached out for Winifred with speed and precision that seemed impossible for a creature that big. Fingers thicker than stove pipes closed around her body.

She shrieked as the hand yanked her into the trees, like a child snatching up one of its toys. The hand that had pulverized the fire withdrew as well, dragging up dirt and soot as it went.

Winifred’s screaming stopped.

Ruth shoved back in the direction of the embankment. “Run!”

Knee-high grass and flowers rustled around my legs as I careened down the hill. Ruth must’ve been less than five feet behind me, her frantic panting filling my ears. I thought back to our hike up the canyon, how effortlessly she made the trek. She was going to overtake me, leave me.

No! My lungs and sides burned as I pushed harder, taking longer strides and sprinting through the dark. I reached the riverbed, nearly turning my ankle on a loose chunk of rock. Shafts of moonlight filtered down through the gaps in the canopy like spotlights on a stage, bathing patches of the valley floor in eerie shades of blue.

That feeling of dread, that I was being watched, never abated. Even over my own wheezing breath, I heard the stalking presence moving alongside us.

I staggered out of the mouth of Dancer’s Dell. The hard-packed dirt of the trail crossing almost caught me my footing. I steadied myself, and set off sprinting again along the wooded edge of the canyon.

Ruth overtook me on the climb back to Trestle Pass.

I pushed harder. My legs ached with each step.

Still, the ranger pulled farther away. She was going to leave me to be taken, just like Winifred.

The bridge loomed ahead, just at the peak of our climb. I could make it. I had to. Ruth scampered up the final segment of the trail, cut left, and broke away across the bridge. The boards thundered beneath her feet. With every pounding footfall, I half expected the entire structure to collapse into the canyon.

Somehow it held.

Following her through that last stretch was hell. I knew it was just a trick of my exhausted body, but the path ahead looked vertical. My throat burned like I’d huffed a deep breath full of sawdust, and my heart pounded so hard, I actually worried it might burst.

Ruth reached the opposite bank, stopped, and turned.

Were we in the clear? Could I rest and catch my breath?

The poster was for Winifred after all. My time wouldn’t be up for decades. I stopped at the sign post, doubled over and sucking wind.

“Bert!” She shouted. I straightened up to see Ruth pointing at something over my shoulder. I didn’t dare look; I just threw the last burst of energy I had into a final, desperate sprint. There was just a little dip in the trail, maybe twenty feet to the bridge.

For the second time that day, a pine root snagged my foot. I stumbled, failed to recover, and flopped out onto the bridge with an impact hard enough to knock the wind out of my lungs.

The deck flexed under my weight.

The struts below groaned.

I closed my eyes, winced, and waited for it all to give way.

Again, it held.

“Bert, Move!”

I rolled over onto my back, and found myself facing those tired amber eyes again. The pursuing beast stood in the inky void between the pines and aspens. Its huge, hairy fingers curled around the fat trunk of an old-growth tree. I couldn’t make out the creature’s body or face, aside from a pair of curved tusks jutting out from where its head should be. Creeping vines and moss hung off of them like they were boughs of an old willow.

The beast tilted its head, studying me like an interesting bug it found under a rock. I stared back, too scared to move for fear it would provoke a response. After what felt like an hour, the it noiselessly retreated into the shadows.

How could something so huge, be so quiet?

I clambered to my feet, never taking my eyes off the place where the eyes had been, and backed across the bridge until I bumped into Ruth.

“Did you get a good look?” She asked.

“I saw enough.” I stared across the trestle into the night. [“Now we know what I have to look forward to.”](https://www.coleschapters.com)
