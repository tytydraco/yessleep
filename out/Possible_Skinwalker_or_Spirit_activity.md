Hello, I do not know if this is the right part of Reddit to post this?

But here we go I was out in my car at night infront of the Eastern Sierra Nevada mountains specifically Mt Whitney. This was up the road before right before the part that is destroyed since 2022. The area where you learn about the Alabama Hills. I have lived here since last year and as a person who is usually very skeptical about things. I can attest this area has a lot of supernatural and interesting things besides the beauty and solitude.

After being in the car sitting from 10pm - 12pm some interesting activities started. Some of the stars that where lower in the night sky seemed to move in a pattern but bouncing like an animal. I noticed after I stopped focusing and sitting in the pitch black I saw vague shadow silhouettes that looked like giant cyclops with stars for eyes.

They kept moving for about three hours and after I stopped paying attention I swore I saw red eyes on one of the other mountains that is closer to my right. After about three minutes one of the giants seemed to be closer and it suddenly changed. It went from that into a pitch black humanoid with white illuminated squares/rectangles on its body. They were on each arm and leg and torso with eyes that went from white to red and yellow. And it suddenly folded its torso in half and sat like a lion or canine on its butt with that human but not human face. It began to move towards the car as if stalking. I immediately turned the car on and headlights and got the fuck out of there.

I live in town but made sure I didn't let it follow me home and I did keep on checking behind me. Just as I'm writing this I'm hearing animals sounds in the distance but ones I normally don't hear near the house. And this is the first night I'm thinking about it. If I could post a picture on here of what I saw and attempted to draw I would.

I haven't gone back to that spot but I will. It is a normally widely trafficked area in the day. But since the road closure its normally people walking up that road and into the trails during the day.

Still the odd night that was didn't really make me pay attention until the thing started too get closer. And from what I've read and heard they can make you see things that they want you to. Maybe it saw me from a distance away and made me see things until it was close and could change and come at me? Though letting me see it and illuminating itself seems counterproductive of what they normally try and do. Could have been something else maybe a spirit? This area is heavily saturated with ghosts and haunted spots.

But who knows? Thank you for reading what I saw and incoherently typed out.
