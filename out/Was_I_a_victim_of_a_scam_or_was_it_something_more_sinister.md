I got a call from a company about a receptionist job I applied to on Indeed a couple of weeks ago. I was interested in a part-time job that I could do over the summer and this seemed like a fun, laid-back opportunity. I applied for the receptionist position at an acting school near me, and I checked their Facebook and website after I applied and everything seemed legit.

The lady who ran the company called me and we talked for a bit about the position and what it entailed. She wanted me to come in person in 2 weeks so I could get a feel for the job position and see if I like it and if I can perform the job responsibilities they needed. I agreed that I would come in on the Sunday she needed me thinking it was going to be a quick interview and maybe she would show me around the company. I didn't really receive a lot of information on whether or not I would need to bring documentation or the time frame of the day. She reached out to me again on the 4th of July and checked in that I would be coming on that Sunday. I said no problem and would definitely be there. 

A day later I asked her to clarify what I would need to bring when I come in. She said not to bring anything. A few days passed and I had a bad feeling about this. She didn't tell me an accurate time frame and if it was an interview there would have been a time frame set up. I reached out to her again the day before I was supposed to come in and asked if there was a time frame for tomorrow. She responded with saying I'd need to stay until 5 pm to get trained. Then I'd get paid. She said that tomorrow I would be "trying out" and if I like it and they feel like I could do the work then I'd be kept to learn for the day. 

This felt a bit weird to me. I didn't realize that I would already be training right away if they liked how I performed, and never really personally interviewed me. The lady only called me and spoke a bit about the job and if I had any acting experience. Also, when I asked her if I needed to bring anything she said "only yourself". This felt a bit sketchy, so I asked her if I needed to bring any documentation if I was going to be getting paid for training. 

While I was waiting for her response, I tried looking at the company's website and Facebook again. The company had Google reviews and felt legit, but when I took a closer look I was actually scared by what I saw. The posts on their Facebook had multiple comments and likes. When I took a closer look at the people commenting, all of the profiles seemed fake and looked like the profile pictures were just stock images of random families or people. One kid in the profile picture seemed badly Photoshopped to the point where you could tell that the kid was not an actual kid attending the acting school. Under the profile of one man who supposedly took his kids to the acting school, he had badly Photoshopped pictures of "his kid". The pictures didn't even look like the same kid either. The pictures were edited so badly that it scared me. Also, the supposed "owner" of the company looked like their profile picture was also just a random stock photo of a woman. I was honestly shocked. It seemed as if the "owner of the company" made fake accounts and liked the company's pictures and made fake accounts of families and the successes they've had at the acting school. I automatically got a bad feeling and didn't know if this was just a scam to scam people out of their money, or if it was something like sex trafficking or labor trafficking. I also looked at the business on Google maps and saw an image of the company online. It was just like a plain building connected to other buildings with no name on the building.

On my Indeed application they have information about me for example my ethnicity, gender and age. I didn't know if this was an elaborate scheme to just get me to work for them for free or if it was something surrounding sex trafficking. I automatically blocked the lady and didn't reach out again. Do you guys think this was just a scam to get people to work for free? Or to scam people out of their money? Or was there something more sinister behind it?
