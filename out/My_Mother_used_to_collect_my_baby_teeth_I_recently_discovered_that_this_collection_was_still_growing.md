My mum always liked to collect the teeth that fell out when I was a child. I'm not entirely sure as to why she wanted to keep them, but I didn't really think too much either; it was just something that she did. 

I remember that she would always claim that 'It was bad luck to throw away a tooth'. She was a very superstitious woman, and growing up with her, some of that rubbed off on me.

She kept all of my teeth inside of a small, wooden box with a coat of chipping red paint. Inside, red velvet lined the bottom and sides of the box, creating a soft interior for the teeth to lay on. She kept this square box inside of the top drawer of her bedside table.

I only ever saw this box make an appearance when I would lose another tooth and she would go get the box and put the tooth into it. Other than that, it stayed hidden within her drawer. I never really thought about the box and my missing teeth. I forgot it even existed, until yesterday. 

I recently moved out of my mum's house, and so was in the process of moving all of my stuff out and into my new apartment. I entered my former home, and residence of my mother, ready to pack up the final few items that still needed moving. My mum was sitting at her kitchen table, wearing long pants, a thick sweater and wooly pink gloves. It was a strange sight to behold due to the fact that it was a warm day, but she is an eccentric woman, so I dismissed it.

I greeted her, and she looked up at me and made a small, grunt-like noise that I assumed meant hello. She was sometimes a bit dismissive, especially because she wasn't too happy about me moving out. 

I continued on into the house, grabbing whatever was left of my stuff. I grabbed some clothes, a bottle of shampoo and a couple of photo frames. I then remembered the old wooden box of old teeth.

I didn't have any real reason for wanting to take it with me, but I guess I didn't want to risk any 'bad luck', by not bringing it along. I wandered into my mum's room, which I know I probably shouldn't have done.

I walked over to her nightstand and was just about to open it, when I remembered that I should ask her permission before snooping through her things. I called out to my mother, who was still situated in the kitchen. 

"Hey Mum, is it alright if I grab that box you keep my teeth in", I yelled out, "It's in your top drawer. There's nothing I shouldn't see in there is there?"

I awaited a response from mum. I swore I heard a slight grunting noise that vaguely sounded like a yes. So, maybe stupidly, I opened the top drawer and plucked out the small box that sat atop a pile of old photographs. 

I opened the box, expecting to see around 20 teeth sitting within its wooden grasp. As I lifted the lid, I immediately saw that the box was filled to the brim with teeth. Not just baby teeth, but full sized adult teeth as well. There had to be at least 100 pearly whites all piled on top of each other.

As I stared down into the box, I heard a noise behind me, like a soft grunting sound. I spun around sharply and saw my mum standing right there. She made another muffled sound, and I noticed that her mouth didn't open. Something was definitely wrong. First, she was only making noises and not talking, and second, she was collecting teeth that didn't belong to me.

"What's going on? Who's teeth are these? And what are you doing with them?", I asked in a tone that commanded an answer.

She stared at me, and her eyes provided me with some sort of answer. She was afraid, I could see it by just looking into her eyes. But was she afraid that I'd just discovered her horrible little secret, or afraid because something dark and terrible was happening to her. She then opened her mouth which gave me a much more detailed explanation. 

As her lips parted, I saw a normal row of teeth sitting along her gums. She then opened her mouth more, slightly tilting her head backwards as she did, and it revealed another row of teeth behind. They were jutting out of the roof of her mouth. Her entire mouth was filled with perfectly white teeth. I then noticed that the bottom of her mouth also had teeth growing out of it. Along the sides of her tongue, teeth sprouted and protruded upwards.

 I let out a small yelp, both surprised and scared of what I had just seen. She looked into my eyes, expecting this reaction. She then lifted both hands, grasped a gloved hand with the other, and slid her left hand mitten off.

The sight of a hand absolutely covered in teeth is not one that I ever expected to witness in my life, but here it was. Covering her entire hand, and onto her wrist, numerous teeth emerged from underneath the skin, poking through like sprouts growing out of dirt. Her hand was covered in the enamel growths, and no skin was visible underneath the teeth. 

My stomach heaved at the sight, probably both in disgust and genuine terror. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Mum took off the other glove, revealing an identical hand made up of teeth that had broken through the surface of her skin. Sensing my feeling of revulsion, I would've thought mum would've stopped there, but she took off the wooly jumper, uncovering the rows of teeth that sat along her entire arms. 

Her chest area also sprouted teeth, but they were still mostly underneath the skin, like they hadn't fully grown through yet. Not like the rest of her body. I didn't need to see it, but I assumed that her legs would also be covered in the teeth. 

I watched on in horror as I saw one of the teeth near her shoulder wobble. It wobbled only slightly, but I could tell that it was loose. She had a loose tooth on her shoulder. The wobbling continued, and I saw the tooth begin to push its way out of her skin. It gave a final wriggle, before falling to the floor, completing it's life cycle. 

I couldn't help but stand there, frozen in fear at what was occurring. I didn't know what to do. I knew I should try and help her, but shock wouldn't allow me. Not just yet. Mum then turned around and walked out of her bedroom.

I stood for a moment longer before following, rather apprehensively. When I caught up to her, she was sat back down at the kitchen table, one tooth covered arm resting on the table, the other clutched a pen.

 I'm not sure how she managed to hold a pen, but I knew it must've been painful to bend her fingers around it, as it would stretch the skin underneath the teeth. She must've fought through this pain because she held the pen and she bought it down to a piece of paper that was sitting on the kitchen table. She began to write. 

I approached the table, curious as to what was being written. I was terrified at this point, and hoped that she was providing more answers as to what was happening to her. I walked up the piece of paper and started to read. What she had written was the most terrifying thing so far. 

**"I know you are scared, I was too when I found your Grandmother in this state. She looked awful, just as I do now. She didn't know what was happening to her, but luckily death came quickly to her to stop this suffering.**

**I never expected it to happen to me. I prayed that it never would. Yet, here I am. Plagued by the same affliction as my Mother. I'm sorry to tell you this, but. I think it might be hereditary"**.
