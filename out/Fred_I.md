We moved to the village for its privacy.
Tucked away in a corner of the city.
A square row of brick retaining walls and coniferous trees make us a fortress above the bustle of the city.

The house was big, one of those new farmhouse-facade style homes.
Four bedrooms, 2,700 square feet.
A garage big enough for Sharon’s car, my car, and the old Volkswagen I’d acquired and never started on.

Sharon and I had plans on having a few little goblins.
She wants four, I’m good with one or two honestly.

We had lived there about two years.
Everything was great.

Fred moved in on a Monday.

The house adjacent to us in our cul-de-sac had been fumigated.
A tent sat propped over the house for the entire time I had lived in the village.

Chuck, my left-hand neighbor, and many others, had contacted the HOA so many times they had a specific complaint section on their website for 5716 Sara St.

Even people from other parts of the neighborhood would drive by or literally stop, get out, and gawk.

One night I went out and pulled at the huge blue and red fumigation tent.
By this point it was covered in a layer of black mildew from the elements.

I tried the doors first.
There was a zipper, but it was impossible to unzip.

I got a good look at it with my flashlight.
The zipper itself was encased in a hard epoxy of some kind.

So I went to the corners and edges.
The tent itself met with the ground and slid down into a thin slit in the dirt that rounded the whole house.

The tent was somehow anchored somewhere under the ground.
I could find no stakes or other things fixing the tent in place.
It was all underground.

The back zipper was the same story.

No windows or flaps open.
No way in.

So I left it alone.

Chuck and I had beers.
I told him about it and he had me show him.

Chuck was really weirded out about it.

Chuck’s a great guy, but he’s a bit of a 9/11 truther.

He called the HOA president about it.
She said it is not ours to move or question.

That house was under some kind of state lien and the HOA had an agreement to leave it alone.

But the next day a crew of two came out and cleaned the mildew with pressure washers.
They were completely gowned up with breathers and everything.
Standoffish to our questions.

So I left it alone after that.

It sat for another year.

Then one Sunday they came out.
Removed the tent to reveal… a regular house.
Almost identical to the rest.

Fred moved in the next day.

The moving company came before Fred, however.

An unmarked box truck pulled up.
Two more people, completely gowned and silent, pulled into the garage and unloaded brand-new furniture in boxes.

I don’t think I saw a single box labeled “my things” or “clothes,” or “pictures.”
Nothing like that.

They finished very quickly.

That night Fred showed up.
Chuck said he never saw the guy go in.

Fred was just there.
Looking out the windows all evening.
Watching the neighbor down the street mow the lawn.

The next morning Fred was outside.
Blue polo with no logos.
Khaki shorts.

He had on what looked like New Balances.
Once again, no labels.

By this point Chuck and I had a nightly ritual.
Sitting in my garage with the door open.
Watching Fred come and go.

That might seem weird.
But Fred was a bit weird.

The first day we saw Fred outside, he was standing on his lawn.
Hose in hand.
Watering a single spot in his yard.

Only his head moved.
He wore this expression.

It’s hard to explain.
He was blank emotionally.
No indication whatsoever of what was going on under the surface.

Chuck noticed something else.

Fred’s attention would snap to any people coming and going from their houses.

When a door would open, he would look over at them.
For a long while.
Usually until they disappeared around a corner or went back inside.

“Look,” Chuck said through a swig of Busch Light.
He had on his best camo hoodie.
The kind that no doubt cost him hundreds of dollars.

“What?” I asked, looking over.
My interest in Fred had started to wane as the buzz took over.

“Look at him. He’s doing something,” Chuck said, leaning in.

Chuck reached into his hoodie pocket and produced a pair of worn binoculars.

“Chuck…” I said.
“You for real brought your binoculars?”

Chuck looked hurt.

“Of course, man!”
He was already putting them to his eyes.

He sat there looking through them a long moment.

“Well?” I said, throwing my hands up.

“Hold on, hold on. I gotta pay attention.”
He leaned in further and rolled the dial for focus.

I waited.

Chuck leaned forward.
Almost like he was listening.

“Chuck…” I said.

A door opened somewhere down the street.

Fred looked at the woman coming out of her house.
Big pink leash.
Little cocker spaniel.

She went to the mailbox.
Pulled out envelopes and magazines.

She fumbled one.
It fell onto the dog’s head.

The dog ran until the leash was taut.

“Oh sorry, I’m sorry,” she said.
Grabbing the dog.
Petting it.

“Look,” Chuck said.

“I saw it.”

“No. Look at Fred.”

I looked.
He seemed normal at first.

Watching the woman disappear around the corner.

“He’s not doing anything,” I said.

Before the words left my lips, Chuck shoved the binoculars into my hands.

I grabbed them.

“See?” he said.

“No.”

Then I did.

“Wait,” I said.

“See???” Chuck said.

Fred was still standing there.
Still watering that spot.

Water pooled around his shoes.

But that wasn’t the weird part.

Fred was working his mouth back and forth.
Same motion.
Over and over.

He was mouthing something.
Again and again.
A little different each time.

I tried to read his lips.

“He’s saying sorry,” Chuck said.

“He’s saying ‘oh sorry, I’m sorry.’”

The next day I saw a car in Fred’s driveway.

A brand-new white… something.

It didn’t resemble any known model I’d seen.

Was it Chinese?

No logos on this either.

I got home.
The car was still there.

I walked inside.

Sharon was coming down the stairs.
Taking her headphones off.

“Meetings today?” I asked.

“Nonstop. Chase is on a warpath trying to track down his inventory,” she said.
Throwing herself onto the couch.

She wore a beige sweater.
TOXIC printed across the front.
Tight black leggings.

I winked.
Raised my eyebrows.

“Shut up. I just got off work. I’m gross,” she said, waving me off.

I shrugged.
“It didn’t matter when we were 25.”

She rolled her eyes.
Looked toward the front window.

Her expression changed.

“Oh yeah. Your buddy next door.”

“Chuck?” I asked.

“No. The other one. The weird one.”

I looked too.
The white car.
Still no logos.

“Oh. Fred.”

“How do you know his name?”

“I don’t. That’s what Chuck and I named him.”

“God, you two are children,” she laughed.

Then stopped.

“Doesn’t that guy give off serial killer vibes?”

“Kinda. We were watching him last night.
He was mouthing words to himself.”

“Oh never mind. He’s just mouthing words to himself. It’s fine…”

“What were you going to tell me?”

“The car.”
She stood up to mime it properly.
“It hasn’t moved all day. He never went outside.”

“No way.”

I tried to identify it again.
Hyundai. Mazda. Ford. Chevy.

Nope.

It had features of all of them.

I looked at the mailbox.
Measured the driveway in my head.

Movement.

Fred’s garage door was opening.

“Hold up,” I said.

I ran for the front door.
Sharon beat me.

We collided.
Smashed into the window.

Laughing like idiots.

Fred stepped out.
Stood perfectly still next to the car.

Stared at the entrance to the cul-de-sac.

“The fuck?” Sharon said.

A minute passed.

Then someone pulled in.

A red Jeep.
Taryn and her husband.
Brett? Britt?

Fred snapped to attention.

He watched them until their garage door opened.

Then he got in his car.
Started it.
Pulled in.

Perfectly in sync.

Sharon and I stood there.
Slack-jawed.

“WTF was that about?” she asked.

I shrugged.

“I… I don’t know,” I said.
“But I know who to ask…”
