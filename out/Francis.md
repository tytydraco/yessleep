Growing up, I always had dreams of this one man. He was tall, muscular and had ginger hair. The one thing that really stuck out was that he always wore a mask that covered his full face. I loved going to sleep since I knew he'd be there. He'd take me to places such as amusement parks, playgrounds, the movies, etc when I was dreaming. I named him Francis, he was my best friend. 

I was raised by my nanny, Lydia. My father was often far too busy to care for me. I told Lydia about Francis and she acted weird towards me ever since. I loved Lydia. She always told me stories about her older sister, Alice, an archaeologist who randomly disappeared one night. It hurt that she suddenly turned cold.

As I got older, Francis started acting meaner. He got so bad that I ended up staying awake for days just because I hated going to sleep that much. Because I knew he would be there.

When I was 17, the dreams stopped. I felt so much relief that I didn't have to deal with him anymore. I felt like I was finally rid of him forever. 

However, on my 18th birthday, he returned. My dream was going normal. I was having dinner with my family. I went up into my bedroom and he was sitting on my bed. I stumbled back, reaching for the door. He rose up from the bed with a knife in his hands, I tried to run away, to scream to do anything to alert my family but nothing worked. Francis murdered me. I woke up, my heart beating like crazy and I was sweating like mad. Apparently, I had shouted in my sleep since my brother came in to check on me. I stayed awake for days again, terrified that I would see him again.

That was the last time I ever saw Francis. I graduated college, got a job and got married to the love of my life.

My husband, Darren, is amazing. He's funny, handsome, smart and has gorgeous, long red hair that I spend hours braiding each night. His smile could light up a room. 

Darren's sister was hosting a Halloween party at her new house. Darren had been staying at her house since he was decorating it for her. He had ordered his costume to our house, it was due to come when he was back from his sisters. It ended up coming earlier than expected so I was home alone, working on my computer when the doorbell rang. I was curious to see what he ordered. I opened the package and there was a box on top of black clothing. I opened the box and I felt my heart sink into my stomach. There was a mask. A mask identical to the one Francis had always wore.

I called Darren to ask what it was for and he blew up at me for opening his stuff. It was completely out of character for him. 

About three hours later, he returned home looking absolutely furious. He spent the whole night giving me the cold shoulder. 

Three days before the party, I get a call from an unknown number. I answer the call. It was Lydia. She told me to meet with her that instant and that I was in danger. 

I quickly got ready and told Darren, who was in his office  that I was going to have coffee with my sister. I nearly got pulled over for speeding because of how fast I drove to Lydia's house. She welcomed me in, made us tea and sat me down. 

"That's not Darren." She said.

I was incredibly confused. Why wouldn't it be? Just as I was about to speak, she continued.

"I never really told you what happened to my sister, did I?" She sighed, sitting down her tea. I shook my head, she always thought I was too young to hear what happened. She only told me the stories of what she did when she was around.

"Her husband murdered her. I suspect Francis was behind it." I furrowed my eyebrows.

"Can you explain?" I ask. She nods.

"Alice had dreams about him too when she was young. However, he wasn't nice to her like he was with you. I think he was only nice so you'd trust him more. He knew you didn't get much attention at home and used it to his advantage." She said. "The month she died, she was in Brazil at a digging site. Her husband went with her. Everything was fine until I got a call from her boss. Her husband had murdered her. All he left behind was a mask. One that would cover the wearer's full face. They later found his body in the attic."

I gasp. She was lying. Darren wouldn't do that to me.

"Tell me, Archie, has Darren been acting weird lately?" 

I nod. "Nothing major has happened but he's been angrier. Yelling at me, ignoring me, all that stuff. He's never done that before." 

She hums, taking a sip of her tea. "Don't go to the party, Archie. I want you to stay with me. I know how to get things like Francis away. Do not contact Darren." 

"Okay." I say, opening my phone to block Darren's number. She stops me.

"Don't do that. It's far too obvious. He'll know." I nod again.

I didn't speak to Darren for four days, he never even tried to contact me once. Today, we heard a knock on Lydia's front door. Darren was there and he was angry. 

"Good afternoon miss, I was wondering if my husband was with you?" He asks with a fake smile. "His name is Archer Smith, do you know him?" 

Lydia shakes her head. "No, I'm terribly sorry, sir. I hope you find him."

He laughs. "Lydia, I know you're lying to me." 

I froze. It began to settle in that he really wasn't my Darren. Darren had never met Lydia. 

"Archie? Are you there darling?" He calls into the house. I don't give an answer. He tries to push past Lydia but she stood firm. 

"You're not getting into my house." She states, closing the door on him. He tries to put his foot in the door but she slams it on his foot, causing him to take it away in pain.

He began banging on the doors, trying to see me through the windows. Lydia took me into the basement and locked me in there. 

I can hear him upstairs, he's managed to get in. He's fighting with Lydia, demanding to know where I am. I'm scared that he's gonna find me. If he does, I published this so everyone will be wary of Francis. Lydia has told me what to do if you see Francis in your dreams, which I will now share with you.

• Do not interact with him. 

It starts with him watching you from afar. If you decide to investigate or acknowledge him more than you should, he has you. 

• If you do interact with him, burn white candles, wear white clothing, make everything WHITE.

Francis hates the colour white. He'll start to leave you alone if you have everything white. After he leaves you alone, you can go back to normal colours again, but do it gradually as he may try to come back. 

He is an impersonator. He will become the person you love the most to trick you. He feeds off of fear. 

When this is all over I'm almost 100% sure I will be dead, please look for my husband. 
His name is Darren Smith, he is 32, is 6'1 and has red hair. If something happens to him, please make sure he has a funeral. I know that is not him up there.

If you see Francis in you dreams, pray that you don't turn out like myself or Alice. He is pure evil.
