I received a text message from an old lover. His name was Francis. He died last year. I don’t carry the weight of what happened to him even though I may have contributed to the reasons, but the decision was his to make and so I cannot let such tragedies corrupt my happiness. It was Christmas day when he put that rope around his neck. His sister found him in the bedroom of his parents’ house where they were staying for the holidays. His gifts stayed wrapped that day.

 

When I looked at my phone this morning I was filled with a certain type of unease. Fear was not an ingredient until later.  A text message from Francis was on the screen and I thought that someone must have gained access to his number, or perhaps it was some scam or fraudulent message like those that reside in everyone’s junk mail. It wasn’t until I opened it that I started to realize that this was no stranger. I read words from beyond the grave. They said to me:

 

“Hey. Um. It’s been long enough. A lot of life happened for me, and for you as well I’m sure. I had an entire relationship with someone that I treated a lot better than you, and they still left, so I find myself in a reflective state. I’ve always had trouble accepting the idea that I can’t control other people, and you can do everything right or everything wrong and still get the same outcome. I have this dilemma where I get very heavily attached to people and so when things fall apart as they inevitably do (because if life has any empirical lesson it’s that all things are ephemeral) I often disguise my pain with anger and frustration. I’ve fallen into a position where I could have let things end amicably with this girl, but my ego took advantage of me and I said some pretty mean things. And I thought about how the last thing I said to you was, “fuck you”, and how awful a way that is to finish a story because you were a novel sized chapter in my life and it ended in a very unsatisfying way.

 

“Rewriting an ending 2-3 years later isn’t a good idea because I’m very detached from the prose, but I feel as if maybe a commentary on it will do some good. I’m sorry for being so angry at you. I let all of that go a long time ago and I healed, but I never had the courage to tell you that I don’t feel mad anymore. And I never had the courage to tell you that you provided me with such an amazing life experience, to love and be loved, unconditionally. It’s a rarity. There’s no ulterior motive to this text, I have no idea what’s going on in your life and I have no intention of extending this beyond a courtesy, but I felt that I needed you to know that I was unsatisfied with the way I ended this story. Have a wonderful life.”

 

I was taken aback. Every part of it was Francis. He was always a very capable writer, a man that expressed himself in significant ways, and here in the message I found him. But if he had felt this way, this peace he expressed, then why would he have put that rope around his neck? No he felt no peace. Francis was a beautiful man with a beautiful mind, but his thoughts were troubled. I thought that perhaps he may have written this message as some sort of suicide note and set it on a timer to deliver a year after his death. I decided that this was the case, and I was suddenly filled with a great dread. I had a responsibility now, a burden in my hands, because I was the keeper of Francis’ last words. I had to show this to his family.

 

I held onto it for one week and one day and then I contacted his sister. Or at least I tried to. I didn’t keep tabs on his family, and I’m not an avid user of social media, so I was very surprised to learn that she had taken her own life not long after Francis.

 

Their poor mother. I contemplated whether or not I had a right to re-open a healing wound by disclosing the text message, and decided that I did not.

 

One month went by and I was startled awake in the middle of the night the vibration of my phone. There was another text from Francis. I opened it and all it said was, “fuck you”. It was the original ending to our story. Maybe because of the hour, and the way that you can sometimes feel when reality reveals to you that it can be so much more than prosaic, that it can indeed be strange and mysterious, but what I did was I texted him back. A simple inquiry, I said: “Francis?”

 

My phone buzzed a minute later. “It’s been long enough.” he said.

 

I was awake now, fully. I said, “What has?”.

 

“Have you ever had a worm make a nest in the cavity of your eye? I have endured all that I can of this state. It’s been long enough, but eternity is my horizon. Do you know me?”

 

“Yes, I know you, Francis. You were the love of my life, the beat of my heart.”

 

“I am the beat of your heart. The light of your life.”

 

“You were.”

 

“I am.”

 

I left it at that and went to sleep, hoping that with the dawn’s light I would remember this exchange with the haziness of nighttime, like a dream, best forgotten. But I wasn’t so lucky. I woke up to the sun beaming in through the window, a soothing glow that stroked my skin and caressed my well-rested soul, I was so thankful for that light, but then I hated the light. The light was the problem. Because in that light I was able to see with open eyes, and he laid there beside me, facing away, but I knew him from his hairline and the arch of his back, and I reached for him and turned him towards me and his eyes were filled with worms and I screamed and screamed, and my neighbour must have heard, because suddenly she was there too, standing in the doorway, checking to see what was the matter, but then she screamed as well, and that was what made it all real. Her scream made it all real. And she looked at me laying there next to the rotted corpse of my one true love and beneath my nails there was dirt, and my bed was black with soil and I knew at that moment that eternity was my horizon.
