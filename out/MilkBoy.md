Growing up I was a shy kid. So, I didn't have many friends. But I used to have one friend! He was a skinny pale boy who could not speak. He often would give me cartons of milk which I would collect! So, I always called him MilkBoy because of this.   
  
Most of the other kids thought he was weird, so they made fun of him! So, I was the only one he would feel comfortable around. For years we would hang out in a forest by the school. Playing games as hide and go seek or tag! But whenever i would find him or tag him he would flitch!  
  
And when it would get dark, and we had to head home MilkBoy would cry! I didn’t understand why at the time! But nonetheless as we got older, we drifted apart. And MilkBoy eventually stopped giving me milk cartons.  
  
And I started to notice changes in MilkBoy. he started to hurt himself more and more! I even saw him out in the woods where we used to play in setting things on fire! And things only got worse when this bully at our high school named Brutus started to hurt him!  
  
I often saw MilkBoy being beaten up by Brutus! I should have helped him, but I was afraid. One day as I was walking to a store, I saw MilkBoy dad Bill. I told him about what brutus was doing to MilkBoy and he looked unphased to this abuse and only furious that he has to get MilkBoy new clothes! He even told me he regrets making him his son!  
  
At that moment I began to remember how MilkBoy was crying about going home. I should have done something sooner when I realized the abuse! But I didn't and I was about to regret it. Because one day I overslept and was late to school and my parents weren’t home and I didn't have a driver's license!  
  
So, I had to run to school if I wanted to make it in time for my math test, I had that day. But on my way, I saw multiple police cars on my way to school! I was confused until one officer stopped me and told me that I was entering a crime scene!   
  
I didn’t know what he meant. until I smelled smoke. The entire school was on fire! As I walked back home in a state of shock, I began to wonder what happened! And that question was unfortunately answered when I arrived at my house! MilkBoy was at my front door.  
  
He was wearing a hoodie and gloves and tinted glasses. And from the gaps in the clothes, I could see scars all over his body! MilkBoy gave me an envelope and walked away. That was the last time I ever saw MilkBoy!  
  
When I got inside the house, I opened the envelope! And there was a letter inside. When I read it, I felt as if I died inside! I still think about this moment in regret. And well this is what MilkBoy wrote to me!  
  
Dear Mark,  
  
I am disappointed in you for not helping me when I needed it! I thought you were my friend, but I guess I was wrong! You would let Brutes and Bill abuse me while you did nothing! And because you ignored my cries for help, I did something horrible! Although you didn’t abuse me you did still hurt me! You are never going to see me again. Oh, and if you want to know why I was giving you those milk cartons! Then go take a closer look at them because they could have avoided all this if you noticed what was on them!

As I walked up stairs and into my room, I opened my closet and grabbed one of the milk cartons from the pile! I then looked for what MilkBoy wanted me to find. And I saw what he was talking about!  
  
There was a photo of MilkBoy back when we were still friends with the words missing Mathew Williams!
