Have you ever heard someone’s voice you recognize call into a podcast? Once, while sitting in traffic listening to one of my favorite comedians’ podcasts, my high school crush called in. Her voice, raspy and sweet, brought me back to high school.

Jade is unforgettable because she didn’t forget me on the first day of high school. Coming in halfway through the year, my new school assigned me a ‘buddy.’ My ‘buddy’ wasn’t interested in sitting with me at lunch. Guess who was? Jade.

Maybe the star-shaped brown birthmark plastered on her face made her understand what it was like to be an outcast. That beauty mark on her face could never stop me from having a four-year-long secret crush on her.

Chasing her affection was a constant subplot in my high school story. Sprinting between classes to find her and dancing over the line between friendship and flirtation in cherished hallway moments were my daily quests.

Our classmates predicted we’d end up dating. Rumors would come to me that she liked me. Jade heard the same rumors. But someone liking me that much seemed impossible. No leaps of faith for me to ask her out, but if you don’t leap, you’ll drown.

Jade’s voice drowned my hope when she told me someone asked her to the homecoming dance freshman year. It took until senior year prom for our romance to meet a climax. What a night we had. Jade’s voice was scratchy and deep—a baritone for a woman. She was mocked for it in high school, but it also had a do-gooder level of innocence.

Even as a grown man, sweating in his suit in his car without air conditioning in the LA sun and sitting in five o’clock traffic, Jade’s voice had me floating away, smiling, and dreaming of better days.

My world had a breeze. For once, I enjoyed traffic because it allowed me to enjoy my old friend.

I’ll change everyones’ names to respect her. This was the voice message she left seeking the comedians’ advice:

“So, I’ve been doing bookkeeping for a local psychic here. It’s just me and the psychic—we’re the only employees. She sat me down the other day and told me business hasn’t been great.

“But pet psychics have been really big lately, so she’s thinking of bringing one on, which is just people who do readings on pets. I said, ‘Okay, that sounds cool.’ Then she offered me that position. I do not possess psychic ability.

“She basically told me she wants me to lie to these people and tell them that I can communicate with their dead animals. But I would be paid double what I earned and obviously less work. So right now, I’m doubting everything she’s ever told me.”

The professional funny men burst into laughter.

“Wait, wait, wait,” one said—let’s call him Davy. “You were working for a psychic and you thought this was real?”

The two laughed at this for a while. Usually the laugh of the main host—something between a great uncle’s gaffe and a wheezy supervillain—gets me to laugh, but Jade’s predicament made me feel bad for her.

The comedians cooked Jade to a crisp with jokes that normally don’t bother me, but again, this was about Jade. With one minute left, they got to the actual advice portion.

“You have the opportunity to learn the truth,” Davy said and coughed away a laugh. “Like, it seems like being honest is something that matters to you, so you thought you were helping people. Maybe dig into that. You could do bookkeeping for something that’s truthful. Yes, you’ve been lied to, and it does suck, but the fact that you care about lying to people is unique and says a lot about your character. You don’t want to go down this path of lying to yourself.”

“Nah,” the other comedian said. Let’s call him Danny.

“What do you mean, nah?”

“Forget all that, just lie to yourself,” Danny said.

“Danny?”

“Don’t be evil, but lie to yourself. Only accept money from nepo babies and rich idiots.”

The funny men laughed, but Davy forced himself to become serious.

“I mean, yeah,” Davy said. “Look, we’re lying to ourselves right now. It’s not going to be a bunch of nepo babies and rich people. It’s going to be a bunch of poor people who always fall for scams. Look, you care about truth. That’s rare. Go and seek truth.”

“Well, those are your options: lie to yourself and lie to people and make great money, or be honest and be a broke loser,” Danny said, and the call moved on.

The episode was a month old. Jade had heard it by now. My phone was in my hand before I knew it, searching through her LinkedIn to find out what she chose. A horn blared at me because I had to go a couple of inches forward.

Buddy, we’re stuck here. I’m not moving for the delusion of getting to our destination sooner. Huh, I guess he was lying to himself as well.

Anyway, nothing on LinkedIn about any job. Next, I checked Facebook. The guy blared his horn again. This time I ignored it because her Facebook showed where she worked: Madame Z’s Readings. With the guy behind me going ballistic, I made my appointment. The drive made me realize how much I missed Jade.

Although I didn’t have a pet alive or dead that I wanted to talk to, I lied on the application form. “Didn’t want to” is maybe a stretch; “afraid to” is more like it.

I had one pet, and it died in 24 hours, so I never had the heart to get another. It was a frog I found and stuffed in this cheap plastic container with air holes at the top. It probably felt like prison for it. How unfair was that? You’re living your nice little frog life, then some kid enslaves you. Anyway, I named it well: Starfire from Teen Titans, my first crush.

As a kid, I lived with my grandmother, my best friend, the sweetest woman, but she dropped out of middle school as a child, so she didn’t know that not all frogs could breathe underwater 24/7.

So, trying to help make Starfire comfortable, she accidentally drowned it by filling its water to the brim overnight. Starfire died. Devastated, I vowed to never have a pet again.

Thinking about that still made me sad. I never told anyone that story, and I didn’t think telling “Madame Z” was the best time to share. So I made up a short story about a dog named Zippy. I’d keep my story with Starfire to myself and my long-deceased grandmother.

Madame Z’s Readings sagged between an adult video store (didn’t know they still had those) and an adult arcade, a place notorious for the poor and addicted to gamble away their money. Both places seemed to take more care in their appearance than Madame Z.

I imagined the type of person who would go to all three in one day.

Walking in, I faced the entrepreneur herself. She stood behind a foldable table with a cash register on it. Behind her hung a poster board menu of various marijuana edibles, so I guess they doubled as a dispensary.

“Mr. Adam, nice to meet you,” the psychic said and shook my hand. Have you seen the movie Holes? If so, you’ve heard the accent Madame Z was faking. Fake Romanian accent and stereotypical clothes: a baggy colorful dress bouncing with every step, hoop earrings swinging with each dramatic gesture, and a head wrap close to slipping off at all times.

“You as well,” I said.

“Come, let us begin.”

With no sign of Jade, I had to make a move.

“Hey, sorry if this is awkward, but um, and I don’t want to change anyone’s schedule. I can come another day, but um, could I see the other girl?”

“What other girl?”

“Oh, um, woman or um… they, if they’re going by that… I don’t know.”

“Mr. Adam, I’m the only psychic that works here.”

“Oh, but I thought…”

“Maybe you are seeing into my future, Mr. Adam. Maybe you have the sight. We are hiring more psychics if you’re interested.”

Jesus, lady, you never stop recruiting, huh?

“No,” I said. “Um, sorry, I just thought…”

Madame Z’s thin, cold hand grasped my face and pulled me close. She tapped her long acrylic nails on my face.

“What pretty eyes. Surely, they see something… missing. No? That’s all the sight is. Seeing gaps in the world that others can’t. What do you see missing, Mr. Adam?”

“Just personal space,” I said with squished chipmunk cheeks.

Madame Z pulled away.

“No, Mr. Adam, I’m the only psychic that ever has or ever will work here.”

She led me to a room only a couple of steps wide with black walls and blacked-out curtains and a circular table covered in black cloth.

“Now, let’s talk about your pet, Zippy. What a name.”

A husky puppy scurried from under the table and through the other door, so quickly I only saw its tail.

“Oh, um, is that your pet?”

“No, I own her. Just a puppy. Some clients prefer to have one in attendance, but I sense you won’t be needing her. Right, Mr. Adam?”

“Uh, yeah, sure, I guess not.”

Madame Z made some fake conversation with Zippy, and everyone got what they wanted, I guess. I got to see that Jade didn’t take the job. Madame Z got paid. And I figured Jade, wherever she was, got what she wanted as well.

On my way out the front door, the same puppy scratched at the door like it wanted to leave. It barked incessantly, making a scene. It scratched the door and pushed it, making the bells on the door sing.

It was blocking my exit, and I didn’t want the dog to escape, so I got on one knee and called for it.

“Hey, girl. Hey, girl. Come here, girl,” I said, and the dog turned to me.

Once it saw me, it dropped its mouth in surprised silence. Something I had never seen a dog, much less a husky, do. We stared at each other, eerily. The husky had a brown patch on the side of its face, almost identical to Jade’s.

My face crunched. I couldn’t speak. Sound. Words. I couldn’t make them. How do you say what you’re thinking when I’m thinking this and sound sane?

My heart hammered, then slowed, then trickled. The chime of the door stopped. The gentle hum of the husky’s breathing was the only noise.

But why did a dog look like Jade? Why did this happen? What is this?

“What?” I said to the dog as if it could answer. “Wait, no, wait.”

Silent, frozen, we watched one another. A single tear plopped down the dog’s face.

“Jade, come!” Ms. Z commanded the dog, and with a pitiful whimper, the husky dragged itself to her.

“What?” I stuttered out. “What’s her name? You said Jade?”

“You should be able to leave now, Adam.”

“Madame, uh, Madame Z. Who does your books?”

Madame Z did not answer me. The beast looked back at me. Mouth dropped, tongue hanging and swinging like a noose on a chill Sunday morning. But in that sweet, deep voice that could be Jade’s, the husky spoke.

“Starfire said she does not forgive you.”

The words chilled me to my core. There was no way on Earth she should know about that. I pushed my way out of the door and ran for at least three blocks until I was comfortable enough to stop and call an Uber. I haven’t gone back there since. I won’t go back there.

The comedians were wrong about there only being two options: lying to yourself or finding out the truth. Jade did try to lie to herself, but unfortunately, she found a much stranger truth. Truth mankind was never supposed to know.

I like to lie to myself as well, because I’m never going back [there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/)
