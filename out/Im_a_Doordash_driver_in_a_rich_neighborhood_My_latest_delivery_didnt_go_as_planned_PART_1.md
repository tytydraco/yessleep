Okay, so I’m going to try this here.

I’ve tried posting this on other boards but it gets taken down immediately. Apparently no one wants to believe my accounts, and that’s okay. I’ve accepted that at this point the only way to convey my experience to the general public is within the comfortable frame of fiction. And it’s for this reason that I had my fiction-writing brother, Jimmy, proofread this log before posting.

So here goes…

My name is Carl Rogers (yes, like the psychologist.) I live in a small town in Northern Illinois which I won’t name here for reasons that will become apparent later. I have been a Doordash driver for a little over four years, meaning I know the ins and outs of the business—if you want to call it a business.

The truth is, Dashing is a lot like corporate news writing, another industry which, unfortunately, I have experience in. Both professions require lots of self-management, quick turnover, and a loose skirting of the law in order to get ahead. Of course, if you get caught breaking the law, you’re on your own.

In all my years of Dashing, only twice have I had run-ins with the police. The first was a speeding ticket. The second, well . . .

I’m getting off track.

I want to focus on my latest Dash, because I think everything will become a little clearer after you hear this “story.” I use quotes to remind you that this is my *real life experience*. Even so, I will refer to it as a story—no quotes—if it makes it easier for you to swallow.

The time on the dashboard read 10:44 PM. I rolled into the parking lot of Lazy Dog, a contemporary American eatery with a proclivity for staying true to its namesake. I would normally skip over a restaurant which was routinely 15 to 20 minutes late on their orders, but that wasn’t an option. Kelsie P. was shelling out $38 for a chicken pot pie, a side of crispy deviled eggs, and a 6-pack of the joint’s house-brewed pale ale. For 9 miles, this was an extremely generous sum. Of course, the neighborhood I was delivering to was known for its generosity, which was no surprise considering its average household income was an order of magnitude greater than the U.S. average.

But I digress.

I parked my 2007 Honda Taurus in the pick-up-and-go spot and stepped out, hearing the subtle creak of its door hinges, then the loud slam of its quick latch. The car’s beige paint was beginning to rust along the bottom trim. I surveyed this with contempt as I fingered through a ring of keys with the ease and focus of a man selecting a carton of eggs at the supermarket.

After I locked up and started toward the entrance, I considered my vehicle. Bessie—I had named the car after an old horse of mine—was old, but reliable. I had treated her right. Routine oil and filter, fuel injections, coolant, difs, exhaust—the works. It’s my belief that of the very few things we hold stewardship over in this life, we should aim to preserve those things and improve on their qualities. In other words, leave it better than you found it. Or at least don’t screw it up. Life’s enough of a shit heap without us adding our own personal shovelful.

It was in such a state of philosophizing that I walked through Lazy Dog’s absurdly large entrance door by pulling a huge dog-bone handle, feeling a release of pressure consistent with the opening of a space-shuttle’s vacuum-sealed hatch. I scowled without realizing, then continued through an empty anteroom and into the dining room where three college-aged girls were giggling behind the host counter. I approached, expecting one of them to turn and address me, but after thirty seconds, it became apparent they lacked any peripheral vision.

“Uh-hm,” I mumbled, clearing my throat. But still no response.

Now, I consider myself to be a generally calm and reasonable man. At the ripe age of 53, I have seen my share of troubles. I served two military tours: the first in the Persian Gulf, the second in Afghanistan. And on top of all the death and despair I witnessed there, I was also around to watch both of my parents pass, and neither in a good way. My dad ran the family farm down South, and one day he got on the wrong side of a harvester. Tore him up pretty good. He lasted a whole 48 hours before succumbing to internal bleeding. That’s when my mom’s insides also started to bleed. She was depressed, I knew that, and she blamed me for leaving. That’s why it wasn’t a shock when I found her hung up in the barn a few months later.

My three brothers and two sisters attended the funeral. It was the first time in a decade we were all in the same place. By the time of mom’s suicide, everyone except Jimmy and I had already flown the coop, found spouses, and acquired well paying jobs. As a result, the conversation over inheritance was short. As the oldest, I was willed the farm’s title, and outside of the land, there wasn’t much of value to dicker over. Tom mentioned selling the farm and sharing the payday, but at the time I wasn’t ready to do that. So I gave what little mom had saved in the bank to Jimmy and went on my way.

A couple years later, I met Karen. I was working at a reputable news company based out of New York at the time. We met at a Starbucks early one morning after I finished working out at a nearby gym. She complimented my shoes which I had purchased over the internet a couple weeks back. Apparently they were some top notch running shoes. I didn't really know the difference, but she was really into running 5k’s and the like. We went on a couple dates, and 6 months later, we were engaged.

About a year into our marriage, she began to bring up the farm. I should have noticed the red flags, but I was naïve and in love. The two should be counted as synonyms.

I had taken her to Illinois to see the house I grew up in shortly after we were wed. At the time, she didn’t have much to say. I mentioned how I was loaning out the acreage to some local farmers to cover its cost-basis until I decided what to do with it. She said that was a good idea. But she must have gotten a whiff of how much those acres were worth, because she started nudging me to sell, always couching it in terms of what we could do with *“all that money.”*

I was never the type to lust after possessions. To me, things come with an invisible weight attached. Like I said earlier, I take care of what’s mine. So whenever I did make an important purchase, it took a while for the added stress of owning another thing to roll off my shoulder. I guess I just figured Karen was the same way. I guess we all think everyone else is like us, until we’re proven wrong. And boy was I.

I got a decent bid from an out-of-stater and decided to pull the trigger. I won’t share the figure here, but let’s just say it was a comfortable retirement. The first thing I did after accessing the money was immediately deposit 20% of the net principle into a checking account in Jimmy’s name. He was still struggling to find his way, trying to become some kind of fiction writer, so I thought the money might help keep him afloat while he worked all that out.

As it turned out, that was the best decision I ever made, because a week later Karen divorced me and took half of my net worth in alimony (more than half when accounting for court fees and taxes.)

We never had any kids together, and I’m grateful for that. Not just because Karen turned out to be a gold digging bitch, but because kids were never really my forte. Just didn’t make sense to me, even when I was one myself. So standing here, now, in front of these teenage girls, I’m reminded again of the kids I never had, and the woman who took most of what I did have. And it pissed me off.

“Hey,” I snapped, raising my hand and offering a slow, “earth to human” wave. “What is this? Am I at a restaurant or the local rub-and-tug? I don’t have all day…”

One of the girls—the middle one—turned, her arms crossed, and with a face full of disgust, spat out, “What?”

“I said—”

“I know what you said,” she cut me off, lifting her hand in a halting motion. “Have you ever heard of sexual harassment, old man?” She waited a moment to see how I would respond. When it became apparent I wasn’t going to, she relented, and with a groan, she asked, “What do you want?”

*The past thirty years back,* I thought, but only said, “Kelsie P’s Doordash order. Think you can manage that?”

The host, Maybell, (who’s naming these kids nowadays?) rolled her eyes, then shot a tortured glance at her friends who regarded her with sympathy. “Be right back,” she said and strutted off toward the kitchen. The other two eyed me, afraid I might strike up a friendly conversation with them next, but I had no such plans. I backed up near the door and leaned against the wall.

My attention was split then between surveying the surroundings and thinking about my past. Often this was the case. I inhabited some space between yesterday and today—with the present often acting as a stage for old actors. For example, the rustic dining room, outfitted with its Western-styled tapestries and moose heads and a taxidermied bear standing on a platform, brought to mind good times on the ranch. The stretch of years when the whole family ate supper together. When the harvests were good and mom and dad would kiss before heading into town. These memories brought me as close to smiling as I could manage.

But then I looked over and saw the few bachelors lingering by the bar, and I was reminded all over again of the things I had tried to bury at the bottom of countless bottles. Things which, for better or worse, had come to define my perspective on life. The war. Dad’s death, then mom’s. Karen. My own insufficiencies. It all came bubbling up like an uncorked bottle of champagne, filling my empty cup with poison.

And I recognize it, too. I understand how some of my thoughts and actions may come off as cynical and uncouth. I agree it’s not pretty. A part of me changed after the war. Like some wires crossed in my brain and I no longer felt things the right way. Then when my parents died, I wasn’t able to mourn them properly. Karen was really the final nail in the coffin. I stopped caring so much about the way people felt. I became cold and mechanical. I could feel my own bout of depression coming on, and it reached an apotheosis right around the time I started Dashing. Then something happened. I didn’t change. As much as I’d like to change, I’m convinced that ship has sailed for good. But I was able to carve out a new purpose in my life. And it’s that purpose that helped me shrug off the decades of rot which was festering like an invisible, gangrenous tail slithering behind me wherever I went.

I was pulled from my machinations by Maybell returning with a brown bag. It contained the Lazy Dog logo and was stapled shut to prevent hungry Dashers from sneaking a few fries. She held it out as if she was offering me a dead squirrel.

“Are you sure you’re old enough to be serving alcohol?” I asked whimsically.

She groaned. “Just take it. Please.”

I smiled and tipped her a nod before extracting the bag of goodies from her hand. “You have a good night now,” I patronized.

She turned around without saying another word.

It was misting when I got back to the Taurus. *Great, that’ll help the rust situation*, I thought. I hopped in, tossed the doggie bag in the passenger seat, and turned the ignition key. Bessie came roaring to life, her sound augmented by the performance exhaust I had installed at the turn of the year. It was April now, still Winter for all intents and purposes, but it hadn’t snowed in over a week which meant the roads were easy-driving. I flipped the radio on and listened to the barely audible talk-radio host mumble about the petro dollar and exchange rates as I pulled out of the sparsely populated lot. After a few minutes on the highway, the storefront lights faded into a dreary blur in my rearview mirror.

I turned off at an exit and entered into the village backroads. The wide highway condensed into two pencil-thin lanes, boxed in by endless stretches of tall trees which hung over the road in severe ellipses like rows of giants bending down to examine a strange bug. A chill worked up my spine, which I thought was strange because I was pretty sure electrical impulses were supposed to originate in the brain. Or maybe it was the heart. Either way, I was certain it wasn’t the middle of the lower back. I flashed my brights, searching for deer, but there was nothing. Just me, Bess, the trees, and a little bit of rain.

My phone, a Galaxy-something-or-other, lit up and started buzzing. The screen read: *Julie*. I canned the radio and answered.

*Me: Hey, Jules. On the road now. ETA 5 minutes.*

*Julie: You hear about Kevin?*

I was quiet for a moment, processing her sudden question. Then I remembered.

*Me: (Somber) Yeah, I heard.*

Silence.

*Me: Jules? You there?*

*Julie: Just be careful, alright? Get home safe. I worry about you sometimes.*

*Me: Nothing to worry about, darlin’. I’ll give you a call when I get back.*

*Julie: Alright.*

I hung up.

Julie, or Jules as I call her, is a kind of co-worker of mine. And a very anxious one at that. We had met under precarious circumstances a few years ago and decided to team up ever since. And, no, before you ask, we aren’t romantically involved. I made it clear from the start that our relationship is 100% business. She agreed. I just call her things like “darling” to mess with her. Lighten the mood a bit. And believe me, we can use all the mood-lightening we can get.

I checked the Dasher app and saw the house was less than a mile away. I slowed down to around 15 mph and reached into the back seat, returning with a 10 lb bag of Gold Metal all-purpose flour. I parked along the road bank and flicked my hazards on. Then I took up the Lazy Dog bag and grimaced. *Staples. It had to be staples.* I reached into the glove compartment and took out a staple remover, a stapler, a small enclosed vial, and a pocket knife. After opening the Lazy Dog bag, I removed its contents, setting the food on the passenger-side floor mat, then I slashed a hole in the top of the flour bag and poured the white powder in. When the flour was fully added, I planted the vial in the center, then stapled the bag shut and put everything away.

I stepped out of the car and dusted off my trench coat, coughing a few times into my elbow. I had done this procedure over three dozen times now, but I was never able to pour the flour without making a mess. When I was sufficiently cleaned off, I reached under Bess’s console and tapped a square out from the box of Camels I had stashed there. I lit the cigarette and smoked for a few minutes, feeling the occasional drop of rain patter down from the canopy of freshly-budded tree leaves above me.

I never really cared for forests. To me, treelines were like nature’s curtains, hiding its bare beauty on the other side. That beauty was an open field, a valley, a mountain. Any kind of concrete structure not bastardized by nature’s spurious outgrowths. If I had a choice, I would move out and work in Utah or Colorado or Arizona. But I didn’t have a choice. This was my home, and I had to defend it.
