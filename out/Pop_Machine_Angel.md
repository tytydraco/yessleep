We kicked in the plastic of the pop machine because we were bored and hot and angry. It was humid and the pool was closed on Sundays. 

But could we go home? Nope. Camp lasted for another week, and not just any camp: Church camp. 

Let me be absolutely clear about one thing. My family is not religious and never has been. But my mom found a pack of menthol cigarettes in my backpack last April and didn't believe me when I had no idea how they got there. 

The last days of the Satanic panic came in the mid-nineties. People literally believed a secret organization of devil worshippers were killing babies at daycares and subliminally influencing children through cartoons and heavy metal. 

My parents weren't impacted. I got to watch Smurfs and play Dungeons and Dragons. But the general end of the hysteria had a curious effect on my parents. It made them consider the media their son was consuming. 

Violence, sexism, and Metallica seemed like maybe not the best stuff for a fifteen-year-old. When they found the cigarettes that only confirmed their bias. These video games and fantasy books had clearly misled me on the path to a successful life.

They found the camp online, Heaven Pentecostal camp, on the outskirts of a shithole tourist trap called Bridal Veil Lake. 

I never saw the town itself because Heaven is like a crater in the middle of a forest. There's pavement everywhere and grass, and churches and tents and trailers and cottages. It's like somebody dropped an urban facade on top of the trees. Camp is probably the wrong word for the place. 

Run-down spa would be more accurate. Amenities are limited. The focus is more on the church services and small group discussions. There is a pool with a concrete liner so rough it cut my back. Also, a small store sells candy and ice cream and French fries. But not on Sundays.

Sundays are all day church, trapped in a sweaty tabernacle. Kids throw up in there because it's so hot. They throw up and are praised by the pastor for their dedication, if they stay. 

I left the second the vomit smell wafted over the pews. Some teenager in a security t-shirt tried to stop me, so my friends and I literally ran away. 

Our escape made us hot, which brought us to the little store because it had an old pop machine. I wanted a sprite. It ate my loonie. Hence, the wrath I lay upon it felt justified and good.

The click of a camera shutter said we were not alone. Behind us stood an old man - like really old. He had so many wrinkles he might have been made out of tree bark. A small camera dangled from a wrist strap. 

There were four of us and we quickly surrounded him.

"You just take our picture?' Jordan asked. I'd met him the first day of camp because we both didn't want to be there and tended to hang back. He was big, the biggest fifteen-year-old I've known, and that made him the leader.

"You broke the pop machine," the old man said, pointing with a gnarled finger not at the machine but at Jordan.

"Did," Jordan emphasized each word, "you. take. our. picture?"

The old man retracted his finger and looked between Jordan and I. The situation, I think, was clear to him.

"Give me the camera," Jordan ordered.

"No," the old man said, slowly, quietly. He cleared his throat and attempted to walk away, through the group. 

Jordan threw the first punch. That's all I can say for certain. Cartilage in the old man's nose popped and blood immediately poured into his astonished mouth. 

What came next, I can't remember clearly.

In deprived circumstances, man is a wolf to man. We needed the camera, sure, but that isn't why we beat him. Our collective rage had been building the moment we arrived in Heaven Camp. The pop machine had been our selected effigy, not the old man, but he got in the way.

I'm sorry for what we did. I was immediately sorry. He lay in a bloody pile, his breathing ragged, struggling.

When Jordan undid his belt and opened his zipper, I shook my head.

He grinned and his cold eyes watched me while he relieved himself all over the probably dying man. The other two guys, Jack and Ben, laughed nervously. 

Jordan yawned as he did up his pants. "You wusses can go. I'll take care of this."

"What do you mean?" I asked at the same time my new acquaintances jogged away from the store. I didn't know them. I didn't know Jordan. We were like criminals in a jail. One did not ask about the crimes that led us here. All were presumed innocent and wrongly incarcerated. 

But Jordan's next words revealed the difference between us. "You want to help?" 

"Help? Like get him some help?"  

He laughed, and showed me his meaning. Across painted grey concrete, he dragged the old man to the side of the pop machine, leaving a narrow streak of blood. 

I'm ashamed to admit that I kept a lookout, up and down the tarmac path going to the fenced in pool and the tabernacle, and beyond to the row of rental trailers where we slept each night. 

"What are you doing?" I asked so quietly, Jordan didn't acknowledge the question. He grabbed the old man under his arms and squashed him behind the pop machine. 

Jordan swung the camera by its strap against the wall until it broke. The remnants he jammed into the old man's bloody mouth. We'd beaten him so badly, his eyes were already swollen shut.

"Oh god, oh god." I was freaking out. 

"Right, oh god," Jordan said. "Back to church now." He pulled my arm roughly when I wouldn't move, and soon we were back in the sweltering tabernacle after a brief stop in the public bathroom to wash the blood from our hands and faces. Jordan used wet paper towels; I felt like a bewildered toddler as he gently dabbed and cared for me.

Jack and Ben hadn't been so calculating. They sat there in the back pews with flecks of blood on their knuckles and faces. The teen security guards behind them were already talking.

"Shit," Jordan said, "idiots." He prodded me to a pew far away in order to think up our next move. "Go back to the machine, and pretend to find him," he said to me.

"What? Why me?"

We whispered while the youth pastor huffed into a microphone and walked back and forth like some Vegas lounge act. I've no idea what the sermon was about - something about lust maybe. 

"I got history," Jordan said. He stared out over the crowd of sweaty teenagers. I've never met an older kid in my life. His "history" could only mean a criminal record. I had never done anything like this before. 

"I don't want to," I said. My body felt cold and fevered at the same time. 

"He could die," Jordan said.

"He might already be."

"You," he said, "could die."

The room got quiet as a real cool twenty-something guy in sunglasses started playing a church organ noise on an electric keyboard. Jordan's threat might have seemed empty had he not just beat and pissed all over a person. 

All for simply snapping our picture. He cared about Heaven camp and that pop machine. We could have let him leave and likely nothing would come of it. 

There were hundreds of teenagers here exactly like us: Many that were true Pentecostal believers and enough that were present because their parents wanted to set them straight. We could have changed our clothes, separated, laid low, and been back to our respective homes within a week. Now we were probably murderers.

I squeezed my sweaty hands.

"Go on. Hurry. He needs help. You want him to die?" 

"Shit," I swore, taking off, once again, while another teenager, probably two-years older, tried to get in my way. 

I sprinted to the machine and… nothing. He wasn't where Jordan had left him. Nothing, however, wasn't quite the right word for the filthy space. 

Something else took up residence in the old man's final resting place. I couldn't see it. I knew it was there.

"F-fuck," I stuttered and wished I'd just kept my mouth shut. The air turned cold, frigid, and I shivered while the sun continued to shine the same as it had seconds ago. 

The old man's death had left a void. It couldn't be seen, only sensed. Imagine a small space without life, growth, or change, where the breeze skirts an invisible nothing. 

What my eyes saw wasn't real; details had been added by my brain - the dust coated wires, the cobwebs - to maintain the consistency of my world. Visually, the space and the creature within couldn't be understood by the human mind. 

You can't imagine nothing. Go ahead and try. I guarantee the best you'll envision is an empty space. And even an empty space is something. 

This. Was. Nothing.

And it made me want to sit down and die. 

Or maybe the thing I couldn't understand did that. I don't know. It's too hard to describe and it must seem like I'm contradicting myself. It was there. But it was nothing. Maybe I can't relate what happened given the limits of language. 

What followed, in any case, is simpler: I tried to run and ended up staggering away with no specific destination in mind. Disoriented, I crossed the stretch of stamped, brown grass to the chain link fence surrounding the closed pool.

The being from nothing unfurled into existence, shedding the void like a yellow sac spider. Finally, it had manifested into something I could see, if I dared to look.

To stay upright and moving, I weaved my fingers through the chainlink and pulled my wobbly feet into uncertain but certainly far too slow steps. The stench it threw - intense, burning spice - crashed the olfactory system and I almost passed out. 

At any moment, if it wanted, I could be dead, taken into the nothing as if I'd never been. I only lived because it wanted to observe me first. 

There really wasn't a point in trying to run away. Soon, I would understand that and give in to the inevitable. For now, I continued to move slowly, feeling half-dead already.

The fence ended inside a copse of litter filled pine trees, the coniferous bearers of plastic bags and empty pop cans. My feet clattered the cans. The bags hissed along my thighs as I passed. At no time did I risk looking back. That would be the end if I did. 

Beyond the stunted trees, the ground dropped to a tarmac road just wide enough for one car to drive on. Unfinished, yet soon to be grander, cottages stood in neat rows in a square of almost dried out mud. My shoes tripped along rubbery ridges left by truck tires renting the earth. 

Nobody around at that point. Nobody but me and what followed.

Huge windows created a reflective maze of corridors. They were building the cottages tight. In the floor to ceiling surfaces, I was a lurching shadow-boy crested by the oppressive rays of the sun. 

Click.

The camera shutter swung, and there the old man stood, distorted in a dark refraction mere steps away. His features were blurred but it was him. It was it. And it/he was smiling.

I stopped because he should have been ahead of me based on the image in the window. Yet, nothing but more drying mud and weeds appeared there. Again, I knew my brain filled in the space with details to preserve my sanity. 

Backing away, I ran down a corridor between cottages on the left. 

Click.

Another picture. The camera hung by the strap from his wrist. 

Again, I stopped. "W-what do you want?" 

Only the blurred smile from the hazy visage continued to serve as an answer. 

I turned and ran back to the wider space I'd just come from. 

Click.

In the midst of an unintentional crossroads, there were four reflections of the old man in the huge windows. 

Kneeling in a row, trembling, were the others: Jordan, Jack, and Ben. Their lips were blue but they were sweating. I'm sure they felt exactly like I did, both hot and frozen, and that I must look the same. 

I almost went to them, almost kneeling, but its words came first.

"Suffering before nothing," it said, though from where, I don't know, "they must go to the void willingly..." The wind was the air of its unseen lungs and the grass, the buildings, even us, were the objects it used to speak. 

"Don’t do it," Jordan begged. "Man, let's just run."

"I tried," I said, "there is no running from it." 

"W-what is it?" Jack stammered. 

I had the urge to slap him, to slap all of them. "It's what we made of that old man and the space behind the machine, you f-fucking idiots. Before, neither space had any dark meaning… now they always will unless… unless it takes us away like we never existed. It's here to fix what we did by removing us, the cause." I had spoken so rapidly and surprised myself with this quick assessment. 

"Suffering", it whispered, urging my hand into a fist.

"There’s three of them," I said when what I meant was "I can't beat Jordan in a fight." He had already killed somebody. "I will be killed."

Searing heat engulfed my skin, a wave of fire so fast and unexpected, I thought I couldn't possibly be alive. But there I stood by the reflection of the old man, marked by darkness and the barest edge of red light, a new aura I carry and can see with the naked eye if the conditions are right. 

I have been marked.

"Whoever kills you will suffer vengeance sevenfold," it said. The boys cowered low in the mud, and I knew I could do what had been asked, though I still didn't want to. 

My hands trembled so hard my joints hurt. I found slim, rusted rebar amongst the weeds and wondered how anyone could have missed them. The rods stood out to me as if glowing, but then I realized so does everything that might be used to harm someone: glass from the windows could be shattered into sharp edges; rocks can smash the ends of fingers; even half-dried mud can choke a person to death.

"Begin," it said.

"No," I said. "Please, I don't want to do this."

"You may join them after."

I thought of the offer. If I did the awful deeds it wanted, completed the suffering, then my own being and regret and everything would be erased too. Willingly into the void, and it would be that I never existed.

So it didn't matter, and what I did to them, those boys, would only hasten us into peace through nonexistence. 

As I drove the threaded rebar into their necks, expertly avoiding fatal points like a surgeon of pain, I thought about the mercy of our predicament. We were being redeemed. This pain was to create a desire to detach from the trappings of this world. 

They cried and begged while I made them into tortured artworks of blood and rusted steel, pinned to the mud. I saw in their faces, eventually, the acceptance of the being's gift.

First, when I stuck them, they wanted to live.

Then, when the pain became so great, they wanted to die.

Last, when I popped their eyeballs, they no longer wanted to be, and they were ready. 

The being took them - they simply disappeared - and every sign of what had happened. Literal blood on my hands became figurative but that shouldn't have been either. It was my turn.

It left me. The humid air returned to ordinary discomfort. In the windows, I stood covered by the new shadow eclipsing the light bearing the edges of my soul. 

"No, please," I said, "you were supposed to take me too. They never existed. How can I remember them and what they did? That's…" Not possible? Not fair? Both concepts seemed childish in the aftermath of the ordeal. 

"Why me?" I wondered too but the entity had gone, and I've had decades to think about it. Why me? Why not me? That's the best I've come up with.

I left the unfinished cottages and went to the pop machine and the little store. Church had ended and crowds of irritable teens piled onto every available picnic table bench. 

Jordan, Jack, Ben were not missed because they had never been. The exist now only as an idea in my head.

The old man wandered by, alive and well, and unaware of the intervention some otherworldly being had undertaken on his behalf. 

I didn't speak to anyone for the rest of the week. Camp ended. I went home. 

"Fine," I answered when my parents asked how it'd been. They seemed satisfied to have a quiet child return in place of the one who regularly blasted music through the house. And they were blown away when I told them I was going to the library. The dust on my Super Nintendo was a parental trophy.

They didn't know what I read. They didn't care. I wanted answers, so I read bibles, Christian and Satanic. Next, I looked into scientific and psychological studies. No book held any definitive answers. Philosophy only raised more questions.

Why hadn't the promise to take away my existence been fulfilled? Why am I the only one to remember Jordan, Jack, and Ben?

That old man with the camera never died, never got pissed on, and shoved behind the pop machine, so how come I can vividly recall all of these things?

I don't know.

The entity from the void doesn't answer prayers. 

I drift through life, bitterly aware that I have suffered far longer than the others, and that it is neither fair nor unfair 

It is, and no one I talk to about it believes me, so I write it down and hope that someone knows. I can't be the only [one](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot/s/uP6OpnrI7p).
