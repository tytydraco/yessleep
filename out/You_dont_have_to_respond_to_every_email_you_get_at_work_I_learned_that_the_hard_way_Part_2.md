part 1 \^

  
We broke silence when the sun came up.   
  
“Hell of a night,” Milton said, crawling out of his tent. He stood up and stretched his hands into the air and yawned, “Smells like bacon, don’t he?”   
  
“Fuck you,” Eli said, “You don’t even feel bad, do you?”   
  
“He didn’t have to go out there,” Milton nudged the corpse with his boot. Boyd’s back was charred where the shirt had burnt off, and his hair had completely burnt away leaving a blackened scalp punctuated by a fist-sized rock stuck about 2 inches deep, “I am glad he did though, I reckon he saved our asses”   
  
Eli walked away from the conversation and began packing camp. For the first time since I met him, Ross was silent. I crouched down next to him and softly asked him if he was alright. He looked up to me and said, “The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. Nelson Mandela.” He was going to be okay.   
  
“Alright Piggy,” Milton called to Kenny who was sitting on a log eating a granola bar, “Get packing we’re burning daylight.”   
  
“Fuck you,” Kenny replied, taking another bite of his breakfast.   
  
“Not so fast my friend,” Eli shot back. He held up his cell phone in one hand and pointed at it with his other, “One call, that’s all. Don’t forget that.”   
  
Without another word, Kenny stood up and started packing camp.   
  
Before we left camp, Eli, Ross and I had a ‘team meeting’ if you could call it that. This campsite would be our meeting point. If any of us were to get lost or separated, or if Milton went crazy and started attacking people we would meet back up here. Eli also instructed me to lay down the three bear traps I had brought with me around the campsite. If Bigfoot were to chase us, maybe we could lead it into one. And if Milton was chasing us, well, we’d get him the same way.   
  
We packed our bags and headed off, I followed a few minutes behind after setting the bear traps in our designated spots and hurried to catch up.  
  
We walked mostly in silence, each of us contemplating the previous 10 hours of our lives. The new found respect for a creature half of us believed to be myth. The haunting melodies it made. The sickening crack of Boyd's skull splitting.  
  
Regardless of how the events of this hunt played out. I think after the first night in the woods, each of us was changed forever. Each of us now possessed a psychic scar of these events that we would carry with us for the rest of our lives, however long they may be.  
  
I honestly, don’t know why I stayed that after that first night. The money wasn’t good enough for the danger we were facing. Maybe I was scared to walk back alone. Maybe I’m just a follower and was more comfortable doing what I was told. I think back to the email that started this entire mess. Ross wrote, “I know this is a lot to ask a common man, but maybe you aren’t so common after all” and I think that is it. I’m not saying I think I’m some sort of Übermensch. I think this was a once in a lifetime chance at something great, right? Why not take it? Either I spend the next 40 years of my life taking raccoons and squirrels out of attics and probably die on the job having never achieved anything. Or I take a chance and die doing something no one has ever done before or maybe, just maybe, survive and at minimum get a good story out of it. Sure, I’ll end up being the psycho at the bar raving about bigfoot, but at least I’ll know the truth. Does any of this make sense or am I just rambling? I’ll carry on.   
   
Milton seemed to be the only one in a talkative mood. Mostly just telling everyone how he “Had Kenny by the balls” and he’d have “Kenny’s wife licking caviar off his nuts” as soon as he got his bigfoot money. Kenny didn’t say a word the entire time. It wasn’t a fun walk.   
  
About 45 minutes after we left camp the smell hit us, which finally shut Milton the hell up.  
  
Eli silently led us to the mouth of the cave we had been searching for. The smell was insanely powerful. It was like the cave mouth itself had a horrible case of halitosis.   
  
The 5 of us stood there and the reality of the situation began to dawn on us. None of us had a plan, none of us had experience with anything like this. What were we doing here? Not a single one among us was some brave explorer driven by an unyielding curiosity and the promise of discovery. None of us really wanted to be here. One of our party members had already been killed by this creature without us ever laying eyes on it. What the hell did we think we were going to do now?  
  
Predictably, it was Milton who broke the silence, “alright piggy, in ya go,” he whisper-shouted towards Kenny while nodding towards the cave entrance.  
  
Kenny, calmly, walked past Milton and whispered into Eli’s ear. Eli’s eyes flicked between Kenny, the cave, Milton and back to the cave again. Then he smiled and he handed Kenny the shotgun.   
  
“Alight piggy, get in the cave,” Kenny said, leveling the shotgun at Milton.   
  
“Not so fast my friend,” Milton began, pulling his phone out of his pocket, “One call –   
  
Kenny interrupted him, “Like I give a fuck”  
  
BOOM!  
  
Smoke belched from the shotgun and we watched as Milton’s hand exploded into a fine red mist. All of us, even Milton, stood in shocked silence. With the exception of Ross who muttered to himself, “I must not fear, fear is the mind killer, fear is the little-death…” I knew that one. It was a Frank Herbert quote.   
  
 I have to admit. Milton took it like a fucking champ. He didn’t scream, but instead erupted into a quiet rage like you do when you stub your toe at your girlfriend’s parents house. His face twisted in pure agony and he hopped around in a circle whisper-yelling obscenities, then brought the mangled stump that used to be his hand into his gut and pressed it in his shirt to try and stop the bleeding. He hopped around a few times more times, then regained his composure. “Fuck all y’all,” he said, before heading slowly towards the mouth of the cave.   
  
Eli walked over to Kenny, pulled the shotgun out of his hand and loaded a shell to replace the one that had just been spent.   
  
Milton stood on the threshold of the cave mouth and turned around. “I’m going in but before I do, y’all should know,” he extended his stump in Kenny’s direction, “Piggy here is a fucking pedophile. Do with that what you will.” Turned back into the mouth of the cave and calmly proceeded in.   
  
The three of us who remained looked sharply at Kenny who couldn’t seem to take his eyes of the ground in front of him. I think Ross was about to break the silence when we heard, from deep in the cave, singing. It was Milton, half crying, half singing, “When I get to where I’m going, on the far side of the sky,” There was a slight pause for his whimpers, “The first thing I’m going to do is spread my wings and fly”  
  
Ross whispered to us, “yeah but he’s going to hell, isn’t he?”  
  
The singing continued, it echoed off the stone walls of the cavern giving it an eerie reverb that gave the impression there was a full choir deep within the cavern with him, singing along. “I’m going to land beside a li-OH!”   
  
That last exclamation, “OH!” was the last we heard of Milton. Instantly all of us froze in a combination of respect that someone had walked so calmly to such a grisly death, but also the fear of recognition that what we had been hunting was now here in front of us, separated only by shadow. Also, it could probably see us.  
  
Suddenly, we could hear it. Loud footfalls and heavy breathing. I slowly started backing away from the cave entrance, Eli and Kenny did the same. Ross stood planted, entranced by sound of the approaching horror. Eli shouted for him and told him to move but Ross remain as if his legs were stuck in concrete.   
  
Suddenly, the massive figure emerged from the inky darkness of the cave mouth. It towered over Ross who now stood only feet in front of it. It was somewhere between 8 and 10 feet tall, the entirety of its massive frame was adorned with thick reddish-brown hair. Its deep-set, yellow eyes were at the same time both intelligent and primal and sat in a skull the size of my entire torso. Its arms were long and muscular, its legs were short and powerful and of course its feet were giant. It held one of Milton’s arms by the wrist and was chewing on the bicep.   
  
The next part of this story is the most unbelievable part of this entire story, but I swear to you it really happened. Scout’s honor.   
  
The sasquatch removed Milton’s arm from its mouth, looked down at Ross who was pissing his pants 6 feet in front of the hulking monster and it said, “What?” I swear to God this happened.  
  
Now, I don’t think the Sasquatch can speak English. I don’t think it can understand English either, but I’ve seen videos of Cats that sound like they’re saying “Howdy” and I’ve seen dogs that sound like they’re saying ‘I Love you’. I mean, just the night before we heard the sasquatch mimic a thousand different creatures while it terrorized our camp, so its not out of line to think this monster had heard that word somewhere before and just randomly decided to mimic that specific word at that specfic moment.   
  
But my god, what bad time and moment that was for Ross to hear the beast say that.   
Ross instantly whipped his head around towards Eli in a I told you so look. A massive grin spread across his face. He craned his neck to look up at the immense creature before him and cleared his throat, then said, in a ridiculous and vaguely British accent, “Oh, Great One of the Forest! May I offer you a cigarette?” He pulled a cigarette out from his pocket and extended it towards the behemoth.   
I could not believe what I was seeing.  
  
The hairy colossus gently laid Milton’s tattered arm on the ground and gingerly reached out towards Ross’ hand as if he was going to say, “Hey, thanks I needed a smoke," then light one up with him.  
  
Ross turned his head towards us again, I have never seen a smile that wide. The giddiness on his face conjured up images of children at petting zoos who see a llama for the first time and think they’re taking part in a once in a lifetime experience. Only in Ross’ case I guess that really was true.   
  
Ross cleared his throat once more and said, “Yes, Yes, My good Ape-friend, would you like t- “  
  
In a flash, the sasquatch’s extended arm lashed out and grabbed Ross’ extended arm by the elbow. The only sound Ross had time to utter was a bewildered, “huh?” before the animal flung him high over his head then bashed him down onto the rock floor of the cavern mouth. There is no doubt in my mind, Ross was dead on impact. Blood and offal shot out in every direction, but the brute continued hulk-smashing and rag-dolling the corpse until Eli fired his shotgun, striking it in the midsection.   
  
The Giant ape dropped the bloody pulp that had, just moments ago, been Ross and turned its attention on us. The monster looked down and placed its huge hand over the small wound the shotgun had left on his stomach and pulled it away revealing a small amount of blood. I think the expression on its face was shock, but I can’t say for sure. Even if the wound was generally insignificant for a creature of this size, I don’t think anyone had ever made it bleed. It bent down and began packing the wound with leaves and dirt.   
  
We took the opportunity to break for the campsite. The 3 of us tore through the forest as fast as we could. It wasn’t long before we our legs were burning and we were gasping for breath, pushing our bodies to their limits on the incline of the mountain path and under the weight of our large packs, but we pressed forward.   
  
Branches lashed at our arms and faces like whips as we ducked through the thick foliage. It wasn’t long before the forest around us shook with an incredible roar. The chase was on. We could tell from the periodic roars of the beast that it was gaining on us quickly. It would catch up to us soon and we had no chance of winning that fight.   
  
I grabbed Eli and Kenny and quickly doused us with a bottle of red fox urine I had brought to cover our scent, then I grabbed a handful of dirt and pine needles and began rubbing them all over me and instructed them to do the same.   
  
After about a minute of trying our best to cover our scent I pulled them both into a dense thicket and told them to be as quiet as possible. I could only hope we had done enough to cover our scent. It would be difficult considering how much we had been sweating.   
  
After 2 minutes in the thicket the rank odor of the sasquatch returned. Sweat ran down my face and my heart beat so fast, I was afraid it might give me away. I pressed myself deeper into the bush, my body trembling with anticipatory dread. The scent of damp earth mingled with the pungent aroma of pine, masking my own scent as I prayed it would be enough to evade detection. Every fiber of my being focused on maintaining stillness, blending seamlessly with the surroundings.  
  
I realized despite the smell getting stronger with each passing second, we hadn’t heard the trademark heavy footfalls that up until now had characterized its arrival. I wondered where the beast could be, when a heavy shadow passed across our hiding spot.   
  
It was in the trees. Its thick powerful arms carried itself from limb to limb, muscles rippled like waves under its thick coat of matted fur. The creature moved silently, almost gracefully through the woods around us, stopping from time to time to scan the forest floor and sniff the air.   
  
I dared not make a sound, even as the Sasquatch lingered a few meters above my hiding spot, its inquisitive gaze scanning the area. Its intelligent eyes seemed to search every nook and cranny of the forest, piercing through the layers of foliage with an uncanny intuition. My heart raced, threatening to expose me once again.  
  
But fortune favored us in that moment as the Sasquatch's attention shifted elsewhere, drawn to a distant sound or scent. It hesitated, a mere few meters from my hiding place, before turning away and disappearing into the labyrinth of the forest once more.  
  
We sat in the bush for another 30 or so minutes before we allowed ourselves to let loose a sigh of relief.  
  
I had survived our first face-to-face encounter with the sasquatch, but we still had many miles to go before we reached home.
