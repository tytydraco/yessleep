When I was eight, my mom told me not to talk about the blood on the walls.

“It’s just paint,” she whispered, scrubbing the walls with shaking hands. “You only imagined the rest.”

She always said I imagined things—the screams from the attic, the rot from the basement, the voice behind the mirror:

**“He’s not gone baby, He’s just hiding.”**

Dr. Linden, my therapist, said something similar:  
“Children create monsters to survive trauma. The monsters aren’t real. But the pain is.”

I saw the man in the walls for the first time after my dad disappeared. One night he was there, the next, gone. My mom said he left. “Men do that,” she muttered, folding laundry, eyes down.

But I’d heard him scream—from the basement. A single strained, strangled sound. Then silence.

When I told her the story, she forced a smile. “Just a bad dream.”

But I wasn’t dreaming.

That night, there was a voice that whispered my name through the outlet in my room. Wet and Guttural.

**“Aaaasssssshhh.”**

No one called me Ashton. Not even my parents. Only “Ash.” But the voice knew. It knew the name locked away in a drawer I wasn’t allowed to touch.

Dr. Linden said I was projecting. “You’re trying to make sense of something senseless. But the monsters aren’t real, Ash. *You* are.”

And for a while, that helped.

But the voice never stopped.

Soon after, my mom locked the basement door.

I’m 29 now. I have a boring job, a cheap apartment. My only company is my cat—Ashes. Fitting, I guess.

I thought I was fine.

Then my mom died.

They said it was a heart attack. Peaceful, if you can imagine that.

When I cleaned out her house, I found a manila envelope in the drawer i wasn't allowed to get into when she was alive, it was labeled:

**“FOR ASH. IF HE STILL REMEMBERS.”**

I didn’t. Not until I saw the address:

**Unit 139 – Eden Storage.**

The name made my stomach turn. I used to write it in crayon on my bedroom wall. She’d scrub it off and Slap me out of what seemed like anger.

“Never write that again.”

I thought she was mad about the wall.

I was wrong.

I had to go to the storage unit, I had to know...

The storage unit was freezing. Almost unnatural. Like the air wanted to crawl under your skin.

Inside: There was one wooden box. Very Old. Loud Humming. The box was wrapped in something that looked like stretched skin.

I opened it.

Inside were old dusty VHS tapes.

On top, there was a note:

**“You lied. You said you forgot. Watch them. Remember.”**

I went home Immediately, Turned on the T.V and plugged in the VHS player.

I popped in the FIRST tape.

It opened up to static..and then my face.

In the tape I was eight years old, I looked Exhausted. Hollow dark looking eyes with dark circles to match.

**“Tell the camera what he said, baby.”**  
My mother’s voice.

**“He said Daddy’s not gone. He’s inside me now.”**

I looked straight into the camera.

Then—frame by frame—my pupils contorted into a almost Goat-like shape.

I stopped the tape, before i could even move, I Vomited. 

I told myself it was old footage. Bad lighting. Tape warping. Anything my mind could think of to disprove what I had seen.

Then Ashes started howling at the closet door.

The same closet I haven’t opened in two years.

I watched the second tape.

It opened up to a shot of my dad—after he disappeared. He beard was much longer than i had ever been used to seeing. His eyes were sunken in and his pupils had the same weird shape as mine from the first video. the video zoomed away from his face. That was when i realized he was tied to a chair in the basement, crying.

My mom stood next to him, holding a knife.

**“Say it.”**

**“It’s not human,”** he sobbed. **“You MADE me feed it. You MADE me dig it up.”**

She slapped him. HARD.

**“He’s not** ***it*****. He’s your** ***SON*****.”**

The tape cut.

I watched six tapes. Each worse than the last.

One showed me on my seventh birthday. I had a crown on my head. Symbols carved into my arms. Everyone smiling. Even me.

Another showed me in bed, speaking in a voice that wasn’t mine:

**“The Vessel is ready.”**

I stopped watching after that.

I layed there trying to process everything that had just unfolded in the tapes.

Then the dreams came.

I woke up three nights in a row with dirt under my nails.

Last night, I woke up holding a tape that hadn’t been there before.

No label.

I played it.

A live feed. Of me. Sleeping.

I wasn’t alone.

Something stood over my bed.

Breathing.

Six seconds. Then black.

Just before the static cut, the number **666** flickered.

In the morning, Dr. Linden called.

I hadn’t told her anything.

She didn’t say hello. Just whispered:

**“You opened the box, didn’t you?”**

I said yes.

She cried.

**“You were never meant to remember. They made you. Your parents… they were part of something.”**

**“A cult?”**

**“No,”** she said. **“Worse. A bloodline.”**

My real father wasn’t my father. Something old lived beneath our house. My mother fed it. Worshipped it. Offered me to it.

**“The rituals sealed it inside you, Ash,”** she said. **“The tapes keep it asleep.”**

**“But I stopped watching.”**

Silence.

Then:

**“Then God help us.”**

Now, my apartment walls started bleeding.

Ashes won’t come near me. He stares at the closet.

Tonight, I opened it.

Inside?

The basement door from my childhood.

I don’t have a basement.

I’ve started sleepwalking. Writing on the walls in dead languages.

One phrase repeats:

**“I AM ALMOST BORN.”**

And now the voice is back.

Not in the walls.

In my head.

It sounds like me. But deeper.

Hungrier.

It says:

**“You should’ve burned the box.”**

I don’t know how much time I have left.

I’ve set up a camera. I’ll record tonight. Leave the feed running.

If I post again, I made it through.

If I don’t...

Check your closets.

And never open anything addressed to the name you forgot.

He remembers.

And he’s hungry..
