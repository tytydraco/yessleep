We made it. Even as I type these words out, I can’t fully believe them myself. I keep looking around at all of the people, normal people, who are all talking and laughing with each other, afraid beyond belief that I’ll blink my eyes and find myself back in town, like the director’s cut of *The Descent*. But I know it’s real. We escaped. Both of us. But there were several moments during the night that I thought we wouldn’t.

  
Before I tell you what happened, I just need to say one thing, and it’s something that Aubrey also asked me to tell you all. Thank you. When we first rounded that corner and saw Mr. Schultz murder Mrs. Cravitz a few days ago, neither one of us knew what to do, beyond simply trying to survive. But thanks to you all, we always had some idea of a plan to follow, some ideas to keep in mind. We wouldn’t be here right now if it wasn’t for you, and neither of us will ever forget that.

  
That being said, it’s time I told you about how we made our escape. And what happened as we did.  
After I finished posting my account of what happened yesterday, Aubrey motioned for me to join her at the back door. Looking out, I saw the last remnants of the sun sinking in the sky, casting an almost eerie reddish glow over the town. As I watched darkness fall, a somber thought passed through my mind. *This may be the last time the sun ever sets on this place*. Aubrey’s voice snapped me back to reality. “It’s almost time, Eddie. We’re going to give it another fifteen minutes or so, and then we’re going” She turned to me, her face still set in the determined look that she’d worn when marching out of the basement. But her eyes betrayed the mixture of fear and doubt that lurked behind the brave face. I nodded at her. The two of us had agreed to not head straight for the bottom of the ski lifts, as the sentries the General had spoken about would no doubt be watching it. The last thing we needed was to be picked off by a sniper halfway up to the mine.

  
“You really think we’re gonna make it?” she asked, allowing a bit of vulnerability to break through her façade. It was my turn to put on a brave face. “We’re gonna give it a damn good try, that’s all I know” She nodded, then looked out the window again. “I can’t believe this place will be gone tomorrow. All this”, she gestured out at the roofs of houses and the town beyond, “All we’ve known our entire lives. After tomorrow, it’ll be like it never existed” The thought was almost too much to bear, but I pushed it away. “We can’t think about that right now” I said. “We need to focus on surviving. On getting to that mine shaft without being spotted. That’s all that matters now” A look of gratitude passed over her face, and she quickly pulled me into a short hug before stepping back. “Thank you” she said simply. I allowed the corner of my mouth to lift in a smile and nodded. We both turned away from the door for our packs as the watch on Aubrey’s wrist let out a soft *beep!*

  
It was time.

  
Slipping out the back door into the night, we carefully made our way to the edge of the backyard. A large, white picket gate in the tall hedges opened up onto an alley that ran between this group of houses. Being as quiet as possible, I reached out and pulled the latch up, slowly swinging the gate open. The yellow glow of a street light illuminated the alley, which for the time being seemed to be deserted. I turned and signaled to Aubrey that it was safe, and as we had the last few days, we used the yards of the houses as cover, this time moving up towards the very edge of town itself.

  
Thankfully, it seemed that The Affected, however many of them were left now, had all moved into the downtown area. The neighborhood seemed deserted, save for the ever present stench of death that had seemed to stain town the last few days, and the occasional scenes of slaughter we passed. I glanced into the lit up front window of one of the houses as we passed by it. I had to quickly look away. The grisly scene of a man who’d been impaled to the far wall by a fire poker through the mouth was another image that would likely forever haunt my dreams. *Assuming we survive*. I shook my head. *We ARE going to make it out, and whether it takes a month, a year, or a decade, these bastards will pay for what they’ve done*. The thought brought back the image of my mother, wrestling with herself and throwing herself through the window to keep from harming us.

  
I allowed the anger that boiled up inside of me to fuel my determination, and we moved to the second to last row of houses. The streetlights beaming down from the main roads meant that we could still navigate without having to use our flashlights; a blessing, for I felt sure that the beams would attract unwanted attention from either group we wanted to stay hidden from.

  
The sound of screeching tires nearly caused us both to jump. “Hide!” I hissed to Aubrey. But she was already in motion, dashing into the backyard of a house and flattening herself on the ground, using a tall row of hedges as cover. I hit the deck next to her, feeling my heart thudding loudly in my chest. A few moments later, the roar of an engine could be heard, and not two seconds afterward, the Sheriff’s Explorer flew by, almost leaving the road with how fast it was going. I didn’t catch a glimpse of Sheriff Wake; the interior of the cruiser was too dark to see into. But I was able to see the grisly sight that adorned the hood. *Oh, Jesus…* A body had been mounted to the hood of the Explorer, tied down with what looked like rope or chains. It was like some sick, demented caricature of a hunter, driving down from the woods with a prized buck on the hood. Thankfully, though, I couldn’t tell who the body was.  
The cruiser continued on, and I waited to hear the screech of tires as it turned onto the last paved road in town. But I didn’t. Instead, I heard another roar of the engine, followed by the smashing sounds of metal. For a moment, my mind couldn’t make sense of the noise. Then Aubrey whispered beside me. “Eddie, he’s going up the mountain!” The realization crashed into me like a tsunami; there was a utility road, barely a single, bumpy dirt path that led up directly under the ski lifts. The Sheriff was going straight towards the waiting sentries. This was our chance to use this unexpected diversion as cover.

  
“Come on, let’s make a break for the woods! This is our chance!” I loudly whispered to her. Her eyes wide with understanding, she nodded. Together, we leapt up from our hiding place and ran. Every step we took, I was sure I’d hear a cry of rage from one of The Affected, or the piercing sound of a shot ring out from the dark. But nothing happened as we fled across the last row of houses, across the street, and aimed for the thick tree line that marked the border of town. A few moments later, we entered the dark sanctuary of the woods. We stopped to catch our breath for a second, then slowly unhooked our flashlights from our packs. “Keep your light hooded, and try and move as slow and quietly as you can” I whispered. She nodded.

  
For what seemed like forever, but what the glow in the dark hands of my watch told me was only an hour and a half, we walked. Even though we were moving away from the horror behind us, I still felt tense, afraid we’d be attacked at any moment. The ground began to slope upwards, indicating that we were starting our ascent up the mountain. A few minutes later, we stopped as multiple sounds pierced the still night air. The echo distorted the sounds somewhat, and it took a second to recognize them. It was the rattle of automatic gunfire, and from what I could hear, it sounded like a lot of it. *Sounds like the Sheriff found the sentry guards*, I thought. I could tell that Aubrey had the same thought; a cautious look was embedded on her face. For a few seconds more, the gunfire continued. Then, it stopped. Silence, albeit now with a slightly eerie feel to it, settled again over the woods.

  
“Do you think they killed him?” Aubrey finally whispered; the first thing she’d uttered since we’d entered the woods. I shook my head. “I really don’t know” I admitted. I looked at my watch. It showed that it was close to 11PM now. The real dead of night was coming fast. I motioned for her to keep going. “Come on”

  
Again, we moved in silence, only unhooding our flashlights to navigate our way around fallen trees and bushes. As the slope became steeper, I realized that I hadn’t heard a single animal call. No owls, no birds, no bears or coyotes or mountain lions. *They’re all gone.* *They know this is a dead place now, and they did the smart thing and got out of dodge while they still could*. Shaking my head, I kept walking. After another twenty minutes, I came to a break in the tree line. “What is it?” Aubrey asked, stepping beside me as I shone my flashlight at the ground. Well worn tire tracks could be seen in the muddy corridor that swung up the hill towards a darkened shape.

  
“It’s a house” I said quietly, then realized whose house it was. “Aubrey, it’s the Noltes’ house!” She looked at me for a second, her face blank, before her eyes widened in recognition. “The preppers! The one’s whose keys you grabbed from…” She trailed off, remembering our near death experience from earlier. I nodded. “Yes. That’ll mean they might have some stuff we can add to our survival gear. Maybe even another gun” I looked up at the dark shape again. “Plus, it’ll give us a chance to rest for a few minutes and check the map again”

  
She gave the house a pensive look, then nodded at me. Moving as the crow flies, we moved straight up the hill until we stood at its base. Part of the house had been constructed on stilts, sticking out from the mountain a bit. A set of wooden steps led up to a large deck area. Even though I was sure that nobody was here, I still pulled the pistol from my waistband and flicked the safety off. *Right now, it pays to be cautious*. Leading the way up the stairs slowly, I found the deck had a perfect view back down into town. I only allowed my gaze to wash over the lit up houses and buildings for a moment. I saw that someone, either one of The Affected or someone else had started a large fire near the edge of the downtown area; the flames rose high into the sky, the orange and red glow shimmering in the dark.

  
Turning away, I pulled the ring of keys from my belt. The third key fit into the door, and with a soft *creak*, swung open to reveal a dark hallway. Moving inside, I shut the door behind us and locked it again. Unhooding our flashlights, we set down our packs and quickly checked out the house. We didn’t dare turn the lights on; the sentries would no doubt see it if we did. “Nobody’s home” I heard Aubrey call from a room over. Sighing in relief, I slid the pistol back into my waistband and turned to pull the map out of the backpack. Pushing aside cans of spray paint and tools that had been placed on a workbench, I spread the map out, focusing the beam of the light on the side of the mountain. The Noltes’ house wasn’t on the map itself, but I had a rough idea of where it was. I traced my finger up to where the sign marking the mineshaft was.

  
“Aubrey, we’re less than a mile and a half from the mine!” I called out to her. I heard her race back into the room. “That’s great! It means we’ve made more than halfway up the mountain!” A trace of excitement entered her voice. “And look what I found hanging over the bed in the back room! I turned around, aiming my flashlight to see what she held up. For a moment, I blinked to make sure I was seeing things correctly. I felt my eyes widen, and I let out an astonished half laugh.

  
“Holy shit, dude”

  
In Aubrey’s left hand, she held a box of what the label stated were twelve gauge shotgun shells. But it was the hulking shape she balanced in her right hand that caught my attention. I looked at it, my gaze shifting from the metal folding stock to the imposing barrel. “That’s a freaking SPAS-12” I breathed out. A military shotgun from the 80s. *The Nolte’s must’ve paid a pretty penny for it*. She placed the shotgun and the shells on the table. “I figure our odds of survival just went up a few notches” she stated, smiling slightly. I couldn’t help but smile as well. The shotgun *did* drastically increase our chances of making it to the mineshaft. Even if we ran into a sentry or two, we’d been on a much more level playing field than with just the pistol. “Well, now that we have two guns, here” I said, pulling the pistol from my waistband again and holding it out to her.

   
She looked apprehensively at it for a moment, then took it, along with the two extra magazines I gave her. “I haven’t shot a gun in years” she admitted to me. “Well, hopefully we don’t need to it. Either of these,” I replied, “But it’s better to be safe” She nodded, then looked at the map as I opened the box of shells. I counted at least twenty four shells in the box. Checking the gun, I found it to be unloaded, and began sliding shells into the breach. After eight shells, it refused to take anymore. I placed the box of remaining shells into my pack, then turned to Aubrey. “Well, you ready?” I asked her. She turned to me and nodded, and we picked up our packs, slinging them on.

   
That was when a loud sound came from outside, from farther up the mountain.

  
*What the hell?* Snatching up the shotgun, I flicked both safeties off. “Kill your light” I said to Aubrey. A moment later, we became enshrouded in darkness. The sound came again, accompanied by a crashing sound. Moving to the large window which looked out of the back of the house and up the mountain, I swung my gaze around.

  
A blinding flash of light made me squeeze my eyes shut. Opening them again, I suddenly saw what was flying towards us. A surge of adrenaline and horror flooded every fiber of my being. *Oh…fuck me, sideways*. I turned and sprinted back into the room we’d been in, snatching Aubrey’s arm as she’d been coming to stand next to me. “MOVE!” I screamed.

  
The world around us seemed to explode. The sound of exploding glass, tearing wood and screeching metal sounded about what I thought the end of the world must be like. I felt the house beneath my feet shake, and for a moment the bright lights flashed over us, the roar of an engine almost deafening. Another ear piercing crash came from the front of the house, along with sounds of something heavy crashing to earth. Then silence. For a few moments, we simply stood there. I could feel Aubrey shaking slightly in my grasp. Then we stepped out of the room.

  
The entire right sound of the Nolte’s house was *gone*. In its place was a massive hole that opened up to the night sky. “Wha…what the hell was that?” Aubrey asked, her voice shaking. I turned to look out of the hole on the other side of the house, but couldn’t see anything. The house shook again slightly, now made unsteady from the destruction. “Come on, we need to get out of here” I insisted, pulling on her arm. Unlocking the back door, we stepped out onto a rocky area. I felt sure of what I’d seen flying straight at me like a missile, but I needed to be sure. Glancing around and holding the shotgun in unsteady hands, I moved so I could see down the hill.

  
*I freakin’ knew it*.

  
Resting about four or five hundred feet down against a tree, was the Sheriff’s Ford Explorer. It lay on its side, completely destroyed from its flight through the house and down the hill. The headlights cast bright white beams into the woods, and smoke had begun billowing up from underneath the hood. Aubrey stepped next to me and looked down, then back up at me. “Was…was he in it?” she asked me. I wanted to lie to her; to tell her I was sure he had been. But the truth was, I didn’t know. So, I answered honestly. “I honestly hope so” She looked around. “But, didn’t we hear him fighting with the sentries? They should’ve killed him” I just stared down at the destroyed cruiser. An almost animalistic wariness and fear had settled over me, and I turned and looked around at the almost pitch black tree line about twenty feet away from us. *He could’ve jumped out. He could be waiting for us*.

  
I forced myself to breath slowly, feeling a little more reassured by the heft of the shotgun in my hands. Even if he had done that, he likely would have lost his rifle. *And one blast from this will put him down for sure*. I finally spoke. “We can’t stop to think about that now. If those sentries are anywhere near us, they’ll have heard the crash. We need to keep moving and get out of here before we’re spotted” Aubrey looked at me, her eyes hardening instantly, and nodded. I said a silent prayer of thanks for how tough my friend was. We both needed to be to make it the final bit out.

  
“Come on, then” she said, and began moving towards the trees. I followed close behind, and still feeling the uneasy feeling in my gut, we moved into the next set of trees.

  
We continued upwards for another half an hour. I saw no trace of anyone, but I refused to let my guard down. I kept my grip on the shotgun, aiming it around almost every tree we passed. I was thankful that we had chosen to put on the heavier coats and hiking boots; the air was becoming chilly the farther we went up. At one point, a branch snapped somewhere off to our right, and we both stopped, aiming our guns in the direction of the noise. After a minute of nothing appearing, though, we continued on. The trees became more spaced out, less clumped together, and I realized we were close to the mine shaft. I’d seen photos of the entrance in the town’s visitor center, and knew we’d have an open space of five or six hundred feet to run before reaching it.

  
And then, it appeared in the gloom. I could see the cavernous rectangular opening, looking like the yawning mouth of a monster and somehow even darker than everything around it. I could also see several small buildings around it, as well as a decaying conveyor belt feeding out from the entrance. I took a deep breath, hearing my exhalation shake slightly. It was both from fear and exhilaration. The latter, because we were so close now to actually escaping. The former, because I felt terrified that *this* was where we’d be cut down, by anyone or anything. The thought of dying so close to freedom was almost unbearable, and I forced the mental image of my own broken body lying in front of the entrance away. “Okay, when I count down from three, we don’t stop. We don’t hesitate. We don’t think. We just run like hell for the entrance, okay?” Aubrey looked at me, the same mixture of fear and astonished excitement in her eyes. “Okay. I’m ready” she said.

  
I raised three fingers. Then lowered one. My heart began to beat like a drum in my chest. I lowered the second. My breathing became harsh and ragged. I lowered the final finger.

  
We ran.

  
The wind whipped in our ears, and the cold stung my eyes so badly that I felt tears beginning to form. But still, I ran, hearing our footfalls echoing back at us from the surrounding rocky terrain. I snapped my gaze around, and for a second, I thought I saw a dark figure rushing towards me. Horror flooded my body. *FUCK, NO!*, I mentally screaming, raising the shotgun to fire. But nothing attacked me. I was simply seeing things in my panicked dash. The darkened buildings flashed by. And then, we were inside the shaft. The two of us stopped, our heavy breathing amplified and echoing back at us from farther inside. We stayed there for a few minutes, allowing ourselves to regain our composure.

  
Finally, Aubrey stood up, using her free hand to push her brown hair away from her eyes. “We made it” she whispered quietly. I felt a small smile form on my lips. “We did. We made it here” I echoed. Then took a deep breath. “Now we just need to make it through” I saw some of Aubrey’s happiness deflate, but she nodded, agreeing with my statement. “You’re right, let’s save the celebrations for when we get out the other side” She motioned to me. “Break out the map, that way we can find out where to go” Pulling off my pack and setting down the shotgun, I fetched the map of the mine out of the pocket and unfolded it. Aubrey snapped on her light, and together, we studied it. “Okay, it looks like the main shaft goes in about two or three miles or so, before branching off into the side shaft that’ll take us out the other side of the mountain. We just need to remember to look for the sign, if it’s still up, marking it” she said, tracing her finger over the worn paper.

  
I nodded, following the path she’d outlined and mentally locking it into my head. Folding the map up again, I glanced at my watch. *Ten to midnight now*. That’s when Aubrey’s voice snapped me from my thoughts. It was filled with a sudden, tense tone to it that I stiffened like a board. “Uh…Eddie?” she managed out. I turned to look at her, to see what had suddenly set her so on edge. She was aiming her flashlight at the ground, and my gaze followed the beam of light down.

  
*Oh, shit*.

  
Clearly visible on the rocky floor of the shaft entrance was a large, red smear of blood. Beside it lay a few shell casings from a rifle or a pistol, evidence of a shooting and a struggle that hadn’t ended well for someone. The smear of blood showed it went deeper into the mine. “Oh, fuck, no” I breathed out, swallowing hard. I didn’t want to say the thought that was now endlessly repeating itself over and over in my mind. But I didn’t have to. Aubrey said it for me. “He’s in here, Eddie. He’s in here with us” She didn’t need to clarify; I knew exactly who the *he* was she was referring to. The pitch blackness of the shaft had suddenly taken on a very sinister and terrifying atmosphere, and my eyes squinted into the dark, trying to separate rock and wood from a human outline.

  
“What do we do?” she asked me, now holding my arm with her free hand. With the other, she was aiming the pistol out into the black. I already knew the answer to that. So did she, as much as neither of us wanted to admit it. The shaft was our only way out of here, our only sure way of surviving. Going back down into town would be a death sentence, and going over the mountain itself opened us up to being spotted by sentry or satellite. Swallowing again, I shouldered my pack and picked the shotgun up, now holding it in slightly sweaty hands. “Don’t let your guard, even for a second” I whispered tensely to her. “Keep your light hooded, keep as quiet as possible, and don’t stop moving. And most importantly, stay close to me” Her eyes showed how terrified she was. But still, she nodded, then flicked on the flashlight.

  
Stepping slightly in front of her, we slowly but steadily began our walk into the mineshaft. We stayed close enough that our shoulders brushed against each other, and I could hear her breathing coming in as short, ragged gasps as mine. The only other sounds we could hear were the soft, ghostly whistle of wind through the shaft, along with the dripping of water somewhere farther inside. That made it worse. Because it meant that the Sheriff could be silently standing in the black, waiting for us to get close enough to…do whatever his fried, insane mind had in store for us. The seconds felt like minutes, and the minutes felt like hours as we moved deeper and deeper into the shaft and into the mountain itself. The air became even colder than before, and even with the heavy coat protecting me, I felt myself begin to shiver slightly.

  
The shaft angled upwards for a moment, then began heading down in a gradual slope. We passed by mine carts and more conveyor belts, along with a row of pickaxes. With a pang of anxiety, I realized that one was missing from its place. *Hopefully to God it’s just because some miner didn’t bother to put his back, and not that someone recently grabbed it*. Here and there, a few large, open spaces where a vein of whatever precious metal had been discovered had been concentrated on. Every inch of my body was now tense, and I forced myself to ease my pressure on the shotgun’s trigger, afraid I’d accidentally fire a shot. I didn’t want to accidentally cause a cave in; there was no telling how unstable the shaft had become in the decades of disuse.

  
That was when we saw the flickering light ahead.

  
I felt Aubrey stop dead beside me, and she quickly flicked off her light. For a few moments, we stood there in the dark, waiting. When nothing rushed towards us, we spared a look at each other, then slowly moved forwards. I could see her aiming the pistol at every nook and cranny that came in her vision. I didn’t blame her one bit. About a hundred feet more, and we found ourselves at the edge of the largest cavern we’d come across yet. It looked to be a central connecting hub for the mine shaft; I could see at least four or five smaller shafts leading off of it. I realized that this was the area that the shaft we needed to find branched off from. Aubrey suddenly gripped my shoulder, tight enough to cause pain. Her breath became ragged again, and I followed her gaze into the cavern.

  
*Oh, God, almighty*.

  
There had been sentries guarding the entrance to the mine shaft. At least three or four of them. I know, because they were all here. And they were all very, *very* dead. They’d been dragged back here and…the only way I can describe it is had sickening things done to them. One had been impaled onto a stalagmite rising up from the cavern floor, while a second lay half in and half out of a mining cart. A third had been pinned to the wall with the pickaxe I’d spotted missing from the line a few minutes ago. But the forth one was the worst. He lay slumped against wooden support beam. His freaking *head* had been torn off his shoulders. In place of it, a rusty shovel had been jammed into the body. A flickering flashlight lay beside his hand; the source of the light we’d seen. Feeling like I was going to be sick, I swallowed, then looked around. I saw no sign of movement. Aubrey finally spoke again, her voice barely a whisper. “Eddie, where is he?”

  
The rage filled roar behind us nearly stopped my heart, along with the thundering footfalls.

  
I spun around, fear coursing through my body as I saw a blur of movement charging towards us. I began to raise the shotgun, but the blur crashed into me before I could fully get it up. My finger instinctively squeezed the trigger, and an almost deafening *boom* rang into my ears, along with a sudden flash of light from the barrel.

  
Then I was crashing to the floor of the cavern. For a second, I fought to get the breath which had been driven from my lungs back. Then I began fumbling to free myself from the heavy pack, which now weighed me down on the ground like a turtle flipped onto its back. As I finally got my arms out of the straps, I heard Aubrey let out a blood-curdling scream. I snapped my gaze up, and felt my blood run cold.

  
Whatever had been in the Broadcast Test that had been inflicted on my town had to have affected everyone differently. It must’ve driven some people far more insane than the others. And Sheriff Wake had been affected the worst by it. The figure that now glared at us almost didn’t seem human anymore. Bullet holes riddled the man’s thick, muscular chest from where he’d been shot by the sentries, all dripping blood out in rivulets. His fingers had almost been scraped down to the bone; I could see the white tips glinting in the flickering light. But it was face that was the most horrifying. It had been mutilated, likely by himself, to such a degree that it looked like a creature straight out of the *Hellraiser* series. He had no eyelids or lips, and his teeth were coated with blood. 

  
The blood red eyes moved between me and Aubrey, as if sizing up which of us to attack first. I tore my gaze around the cavern, searching desperately for the shotgun I’d dropped. With a surge of adrenaline, I saw it lying about twenty feet away from me. That’s when the eyes locked on to me. I saw the huge Bowie knife in his hand. I didn’t think, I just ran. I dashed for the shotgun, seeing the figure explode into motion out of the corner of my eye. I stretched my arm out, the barrel getting closer and closer to my outstretched fingers.

  
I screamed as I felt something slash at my bag, a searing pain coursing through me. I fell to the ground, now less than five feet from the gun. Spinning around, I found the Sheriff towering over me. The knife now dripped blood from the blade. *My* blood. I tried to scramble backwards, but he took a step forward and brought his foot down on my ankle. I screamed from the pain that shot through my leg, and I saw the look of sadistic fury cross his features. He raised the knife, and I closed my eyes, praying that Aubrey would escape and that I would have a quick death.

  
The sound of gunshots rang out, and I opened my eyes to see the man stumble forwards. Looking behind him, I saw Aubrey moving into the room, aiming the pistol at him. She kept pulling the trigger until it clicked empty. The Sheriff spun towards her, snarling with rage as she ejected the magazine and grabbed another. But he’d taken his weight off my foot. I was free! As he began to step towards her, I reached out. My fingers caught the barrel, and I snatched the shotgun up. Jumping to my feet, I saw Aubrey dodge the knife slash that had been aimed for her throat. She looked terrified, and I knew she wouldn’t be able to dodge the next slash.

  
“HEY!” I screamed, aiming the gun. The Sheriff spun around, his eyes locking with mine.

  
I pulled the trigger.

  
The deafening *BOOM* rang out again. As soon as I knew my aim had been true, I turned away. I didn’t want to see the man’s head explode from the buckshot. But I heard his body fly back, crashing into something that let out a loud crack! I wasn’t even able to take a second to breathe, when the rumbling began. The entire cavern began to shake violently, and I dropped the shotgun, almost falling on my hands and knees. I cast a look towards the still form of the Sheriff. He’d crashed into one of the support beams when he’d flown backwards.

  
*The whole cavern is about to collapse!* I looked at Aubrey and saw the same horrific realization filling her face. “RUN!” she screamed, pointing at a shaft to my left. A shaft that had a sign marked *Exit* painted in white letters. Sprinting to and snatching up my pack, we dashed for the shaft as boulders and dirt began to crash down from the ceiling. Dust and dirt filled my lungs as I ran. I saw Aubrey enter the side shaft and leapt in after her without a moment to spare. In seconds, the entire cavern had caved in. Behind us was an immovable wall of dirt and rock.

  
We lay there for a few minutes, coughing softly and trying to catch our breath. “Are…you okay?” I heard Aubrey ask in the dark. I let out another cough. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m okay” I felt tears sting my eyes as I realized how close to death I’d been. “Thanks” I added. I felt a hand fall on my shoulder. I was about to speak again, when I heard the muffled sound of someone yelling on the other side of the cave in. We both froze.

  
“Yes, sir! It looks like one of the subjects made it up into the mineshaft!” A moment of silence. “No, sir. It looks like some of our men stopped him. But there was a cave-in. We lost our men as well as him” Another moment. “No, sir. I don’t believe anyone else got through here. And with the cave-in, no one will be able to now. This exit is blocked” A final moment of silence. “Roger that, sir, withdrawing to a safe distance. Over and out!” And with that, the sound of the voice died away. We could faintly hear the sounds of retreating footsteps echoing through shaft. Then silence. After a moment, we stood up. Neither of us said anything. We just began walking.

  
When we emerged into the open air at the exit to the shaft, the fresh air felt better than I’d ever realized it had. The two of us looked at each other. “We made it, Eddie!” Aubrey exclaimed, then flung herself into my arms. We laughed and cried, both in relief at having survived, and in sorrow for all that had been lost. Then she pulled back, still smiling. “Come on, let’s get out of here” she said.

  
Together, we’d made our way down the other side of the mountain as the night gave way to dawn. When we reached a road, we stuck out our thumbs until a passing 18 wheeler stopped to pick us up. Giving some story about being hikers who’d gotten lost, we hauled ourselves into the cab. As we accelerated away from the hell we’d experienced these last few days, I looked out at the sun which now seemed to have a hopeful gaze to it. Deep inside myself, I felt the horror I’d experienced the last few days. I felt the grief welling up inside myself for all the people who had been turned into a science experiment, who likely would be dead soon, if they weren’t already. I thought of my mother…But I pushed it away, focusing on the white clouds in the sky. There would be time for grieving later. There would be time for planning later. But, for now? It was simply time to enjoy still being alive. I felt Aubrey’s hand close in mine, and I looked at her. She smiled at me, and I smiled back.

  
We hitchhiked until we got out of the state. And we kept going. That’s where I am now. I won’t say *where* we are right now, but it’s far enough away that I feel safe. Nobody knows we’re alive. They all think we died with town. And that will keep us safe for now. I honestly don’t know what they did to wipe it off the face of the earth. I can only imagine. But every attempt I’ve made to look up our town yields no results now. Not in Google. Not in Bing. Nowhere. It’s completely gone.

  
And now, we’re going to disappear. Aubrey and me. We don’t know where we’ll go, but we’re going to disappear for a long while. We’re going to hide away, and we’re going to plan. We’re going to find a way to make the people who did those horrific things to our town pay. No matter what it takes.

  
But for now, I’m just happy to be alive.

But I have to give you one final warning. If you ever hear about another Emergency Broadcast Test happening in the future, whether you live in a small town, or a big city, turn off your phones. Turn off your radios. Turn off your TV’s. Because those people are still out there. They’re still perfecting and honing that weapon they’re making.

  
And who knows *where* they’ll end up testing it next.
