I live in a home with windows in every room. The kitchen, the basement, the bathroom, every room, even the doors have windows, which should be normal.


So, obviously, my bedroom has windows.


This happened to me around 2 or 3 years ago.


I was on winter break, and this happened on the last day of freedom before I had to go back to school. I was struggling to fall asleep, so, as mostly everyone does, I went on my phone.


I can't remember what time it was but it was certainly after midnight and before 4am.


I was on my phone when I started hearing tapping noises on my window. I brushed it off as a tree, but there are no trees even close. The closest tree is by my garage and next to the driveway, which is pretty big.


I thought it was rain but if it was, I would've heard the rain on both windows in my room, mainly the one right next to my bed.


The tapping continued for about an hour maybe.


I breathed a sigh of relief when the tapping stopped, but couldn't bring myself to get out of the bed and check to see if it was there or not.


I put my phone down and tried to go back to sleep.


The next day I woke up before school started. The light of the sun slipped into my room from cracks of the curtains just enough to lightly illuminate my room.


Now that it being day with the sun shining, I got out of bed and walked towards the window.


I pulled the curtain away and as expected, nothing was there.


I went to school, obviously disturbed by the encounter. I didn’t tell my friends, for as they aren’t the nice type of friends, rather the ones who “joke” about insecurities. The experience left my mind quickly though, as the school work distracted me.


I returned home from school, the experience still out of my mind. The rest of the day flew by, next thing I knew I was lying in my bed, struggling to sleep once again. I tossed and turned before I finally fell asleep, not hearing the tapping.


I woke up in the morning to get ready for school. It was just like yesterday, except this time I finally told my friends, as the experience slipped into my mind in the middle of my first period.


As expected, they told me that it was my mind creating sounds or something like that. Either way, they didn’t believe me.


The rest of the day was just the same, until I got into bed.


I struggled to sleep once again. It was around  1 when I heard it once again.


The tapping returned. It was just like last time.


I thought about telling someone again, but I didn’t.


Now that I’ve told this story, I’m afraid it will return tonight.


Everytime I tell this story, the tapping returns on my window.
