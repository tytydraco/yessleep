You may have had a childhood fear of the “monster in the closet”.

Many of us have had this fear as children. But you know what ? There really are things lurking in our closets.

They're just not what you imagine.

When I was a child, I had the impression on many occasions of seeing glowing eyes staring at me in the darkness of the closet where I kept my toys.

I would call my dad, and he would come into my room, turn on the light and show me that there was nothing there and that it was just my imagination. I'd tuck my head under my blanket for the rest of the night, hoping that whatever I was certain I'd seen wouldn't attack me under the inviolable security of my blanket.

Years went by and, like all children, I stopped staring into the dark interstice of my closet at night and stopped being scared at the same time.

Until that horrible night.

-

It was a Friday night and I was just planning to spend the night in my room, snug under my blanket, watching the latest Netflix documentary series about some serial killer.

I had snuggled down comfortably under my blanket and strategically placed the snacks I'd brought with me.

That's when I heard a noise in my half-open closet in front of me.

There were only my clothes in there, so I figured something had fallen off its hanger.

I hesitated, and finally got up. It was a rule I'd recently imposed on myself as a result of procrastinating so much. If it takes less than a minute, do it now and don't wait until tomorrow.

I walked towards my closet in the silence of the night, my episode ready to be launched on the screen of my laptop still on my bed.

I'd obviously turned off the lights to better enjoy watching my series. It was therefore completely dark, and after getting up I thought I should have taken my phone to turn on the lights. 

*Never mind, I'll just use my eyes' natural night vision.*

I opened my closet, took a step forward, and toppled over.

It was as if I'd missed a step on a staircase that didn't exist. I felt that sudden sensation of falling, that familiar feeling of vertigo, and the next thing I knew I was back on solid ground.

I looked around in confusion. I could see absolutely nothing; it was as if the night had enveloped me.

I frowned and stepped back, thinking that the dizziness must have made me dizzy and that I'd better go back to bed.

But there was nothing behind me.

I kept walking, my hands in front of me at knee level so as not to bump into the bed, except that my bed was nowhere to be found.

“What the hell,” I said aloud.

I finally reached down slowly to feel the floor, which was still the only tangible thing I could feel. 

The ground was cold, and solid. But it was as dark as the rest.

It was as if I were lost in the darkness.

I thought maybe someone had hidden in my closet, knocked me out and taken me somewhere. Maybe I'd been locked up in some dark place I didn't know, a shed or something. Maybe that's why I didn't recognize my surroundings.

More and more certain of what was happening, I kept walking straight ahead, waiting to find a wall and then the door which, if I was lucky, might be open and allow me to get out. Or at least give me an idea of an escape route.

I walked for 10 minutes. Then 20, 30 minutes. Probably a whole hour.

Nothing.

There was absolutely nothing.

At that point I collapsed in on myself, realizing I was in some unknown nightmare with no way out. 

Was I dead?

While I was asking myself all sorts of questions about my situation, I finally heard a sound.

“Good night Dad!”

The voice of a teenage girl.

I looked around to see where the voice was coming from.

I finally spotted something strange a few feet from me.

It was like an opening with light.

Like when you close your bedroom door almost all the way at night and only the light from the corridor comes through the still-open gap.

I approached and saw her.

A girl, probably 15 or 16, getting ready for bed.

What the hell was this? I was in her house, in her bedroom. I was somewhere in the house of this girl I'd never seen before in my life. How was this possible?

Just as I was asking myself all sorts of questions, her eyes finally met mine.

I didn't know whether to run away or call for help.

In the end, I decided to believe in an accident, a mistake, a bug in reality I don't know, and I called out to her for help.

“Hey hey young lady please help me I don't know where I am!” I shouted at her.

I tried to get closer, but my feet refused to cross the threshold of the “door”.

I tried to reach out to her while continuing to call for help.

She came towards me, there was barely any light in her room and it was dark behind me so she might not even have seen me, but why the hell wasn't she answering my cries for help?

She approached me with slow steps.

“Please help me I don't mean you any harm, I'm just, lost.”

Her eyes opened all at once and the next second the opening in front of me closed.

“No, no, no! Help!” I screamed in frustration.

But there was nothing in front of me.

After a while, realizing that this “door” or whatever it was wasn't going to reopen, I kept walking in the endless empty space around me, calling for help from time to time, just in case. 

I couldn't see what else to do, after all my phone was still on my bed, I had nothing to call for help other than my own voice.

-

I don't know how long I walked before I finally saw another bright opening.

“George, go turn off the hallway light please,” said the voice of a mature woman.

I ran back towards the opening, determined to scare them off if only to have someone attack me and make physical contact with me that might allow me to return to reality.

“Okay okay,” a man's voice replied.

I could see them now, a couple in their bedroom getting ready for bed.

“Hey get me out of here! You hear me I said get me out of here!” I yelled at them at the top of my lungs. But again, like the teenager before, it was as if they couldn't hear me.

I tried again to cross the threshold, without success.

All I could do was reach out a little towards the light, but my fingers never protruded from the gloom.

The man threw a piece of clothing in my direction without me feeling the slightest impact, and the next thing I knew, the opening had closed.

“Fuck FUCK!” I screamed in rage.

-

I kept on walking, heading for the openings in front of me.

Each time I found myself in someone's room, unable to communicate with those inside.

All they could visibly see were my eyes.

My eyes shining in the night.

Every time someone saw me, they either turned on the light or closed the door. 

In both cases, it “cut off” contact.

I thought back to those nights in my childhood that I'd spent terrified after thinking I'd seen something in the half-light of my closet.

Each time, I hid under my blanket, or turned on the light before checking that nothing was there.

Had I myself condemned lost people to walk indefinitely in darkness?

But how could I blame myself? After all, who rushes to a closet in the middle of the night when they feel eyes are watching them? Nobody.

After spending the probable equivalent of several days, if not weeks, in this place, I noticed that my physiological needs seemed to have stopped. It was as if I were suspended in time, not hungry or thirsty or even asleep.

I also came to realize that I wasn't alone here.

Communication was difficult, fragmentary and often very short. But there were definitely other people here, just as lost as me. 

Every now and then a misty shape would form somewhere in front of my eyes, and if the person and I did our best to concentrate on our eyes, we could exchange a few words before the “connection” disappeared into the night.

Some people have told me they've been there for months. Some even for years. It was difficult to know how time passed here, so it was impossible to know if it was true or not, but the idea of spending years lost here terrified me.

I kept walking tirelessly, not knowing if I'd ever get out of here, or if it was even possible. There seemed to be no end to the place.

Openings kept coming my way. And each time I'd either scare the child into running for the light switch, or simply have the door shut in my face.

With my arm still outstretched, I'd fall backwards into the darkness and cry in despair.

-

I don't know how long I'd been lost when I saw that opening.

I was sitting on the ground. I couldn't take it anymore, I wanted to give up. I just wanted to die here and get it over with once and for all, hoping that the darkness would take pity on me and absorb me.

Then light discreetly appeared, right beside me.

I didn't even have to move to see inside, just turn my head.

I watched, sitting on the floor like an abandoned dog ready to accept death.

A pink room with wallpaper with flowers of every color on it appeared before my eyes.

Probably a little girl's room. Another little girl to be terrorized by my eyes.

I looked again at my feet in front of me.

“You okay?” said the soft, shy voice of a little girl.

I turned my head.

She was standing right there. A little girl with long blonde hair who must have been barely 6 or 7, and who was shyly wringing her hands.

“What's your name? I'm Emma.” she continued.

I started to open my mouth, then remembered that she wouldn't hear me anyway.

She ran her hands through her blond hair, and I was surprised to see her pull it back with one hand. It was a wig. Her small bald head appeared before my eyes.

“I was sick but the doctors say I'm better now. I just wanted to put my hair away if you don't mind.”

I felt a tear roll down my cheek.

I simply turned my head from left to right.

“Here take it you can wear it as long as your bring it back to me tomorrow” and she held out her hand, holding her wig in her fingertips.

I reached out for hers.

She didn't back away. Just a little more, and my hand would reach hers.

I felt the tip of her warm thumb on my index finger, and the next thing I knew, I was toppling over.

-

I was on my knees, my eyes on the ground.

I could feel wood under the palms of my hands.

I looked up slowly.

The screen of my laptop on the bed dimly lit up my room.

I was back home.

-

To this day, I'm not sure what happened. Once up, I looked at the clock, and no more than 10 minutes had elapsed between the moment I'd switched “to the other side” and my return.

I spent the rest of the night with the lights on all over my place, and the next day at daylight, I had installed portable lights in every closet in my apartment.

I have no idea who that little girl was, but one thing's for sure, she saved me.

I wish I'd had her courage when I was her age.

After taking a few days to absorb the shock of my stay in this alternate reality, I made the decision to leave my bedroom closet ajar every night.

I never venture in without light, of course, but when I'm lying in bed and ready to sleep, I always glance in to see if there's a pair of shiny eyes in there.

After all, whatever's in our closet at night isn't trying to take us into the darkness with them.

They just want to get out.
