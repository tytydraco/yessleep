The rain was relentless that night, hammering against the window of my office like it was trying to drown the world. My place above the bodega on 7th Avenue wasn’t much, but it had two things that mattered: privacy and character. It was a relic from before the tech bro takeover—before the city traded its soul for startup culture and slick rebranding.

I was nursing a cup of coffee so bad it could probably double as engine oil when she walked in. Tall, poised, and wrapped in a trench coat that probably cost more than my rent. She dropped a manila folder on my desk with the kind of grace that made it feel like a calculated move rather than an accident.

"My husband’s missing," she said, her voice steady but strained. "He worked for Hyperion Dynamics. And I think they did something to him."

Hyperion Dynamics—the name alone made my skin crawl. A nonprofit think tank that claimed to be solving the world’s problems while leaving a trail of broken lives in its wake. Their motto was all about “empowering humanity,” but their boardroom was known as a battleground of unchecked egos and shadowy motives.



Her husband, David, had been a lead researcher at Hyperion—a brilliant mind whose work in AI ethics had raised some eyebrows within the company. According to her, he had been growing increasingly paranoid in the weeks leading up to his disappearance, ranting about “the whispers” and “a choice he couldn’t make.” She showed me a photo: a gaunt man in his late thirties with kind eyes and a weary smile. The kind of guy who probably just wanted to make the world a little better but had stumbled into something much darker.

I took the case, and my first stop was Hyperion HQ. Getting past security took some finesse—false credentials, a neotech hacking tool, and a stolen keycard did the trick. The deeper I ventured into the building, the more I felt like I didn’t belong. The walls seemed to hum, almost breathing, as whispers brushed against my mind like cold fingers. My heart raced, but I pressed on.

At the center of the labyrinth was the boardroom. The lights flickered as I stepped inside, and there she was: Marcela, the enigmatic CEO. She was striking, her sharp features illuminated by the faint glow of the room’s holographic display. Around the table sat her senior staff, their forms flickering unnaturally. It was like looking through heat waves—human shapes warped and wrong.

Marcela smiled as if she had been expecting me. "Detective," she said, her voice smooth and commanding. "Welcome to the future."

She gestured toward a large screen. On it was David—or what was left of him. He was strapped to a chair, his face pale and gaunt, eyes staring blankly ahead. Tendrils of light pulsed from a helmet on his head, connecting him to a swirling mass of data. The whispers grew louder.

Marcela explained it with chilling detachment: David had discovered Hyperion’s true project—something they called “Resonance.” It wasn’t just about AI; it was about merging human consciousness with machine intelligence. David had tried to stop it, but they had silenced him, making him a part of the system he’d sought to dismantle.



I barely made it out alive. The boardroom erupted in chaos as I tried to free David, and the last thing I saw was Marcela’s unyielding smile as she whispered, “You can’t save him. You’ll only feed the system.”

I escaped with the manila folder clutched in my hand, but David was gone. His wife sat across from me in my office a week later, her eyes hollow as I told her everything. The truth didn’t set her free—it crushed her.

But I wasn’t done. I’d seen the machine and the people who fed it. Hyperion wasn’t invincible, and the world needed to know its secrets. As long as I drew breath, I would fight to expose the horrors lurking behind those glass walls.

Because the real horror wasn’t just the whispers or the monsters. It was the people who heard them and chose to listen.
