I guess this is the only place I can talk about what really happened. No one's going to believe me anyway. And if the feds are still monitoring me, then hi—I’m not insane. Not entirely.

It started when I moved to a small rural town near Salem, Massachusetts. Not the touristy side. This was the part they don’t put on postcards—endless fields, whispering woods, and a town population that looked at you too long before talking.

I got a job working for an organic farming initiative—the kind where you "live off the land" and help with sustainable agriculture. I love planting things. Dirt calms me. The legends about this place—witches, dead fields, cursed grounds—I didn’t give a damn. Stories for old drunks.

I was given a small, run-down house with a patch of land in the back. It was early spring. Cold. I started digging a small trench for planting apple trees. About an hour in, I hit something hard.

At 3:33 PM, I uncovered... a body.

Not a skeleton. Not bones. A fresh corpse. Pale, still soft, eyes open. There were symbols carved into its chest, some kind of twisted runes. I freaked out and called the cops immediately.

They showed up, made me sit in the living room, and searched.

They found nothing.

The hole was empty. No sign of the body, no disturbed dirt, nothing.

They left. Gave me a warning about filing a false police report, citing Massachusetts law—Chapter 268, Section 13A. "Don't waste public resources again, sir."

I didn’t sleep that night. The next day, I convinced myself I hallucinated. I was tired, jetlagged, paranoid. I dug the trench again, planted the tree, and covered it up.

Then something weird happened.

The tree grew fast. But it wasn’t the sapling I planted. It was black, almost oily, with sharp, brittle branches. Its roots pushed out of the dirt like fingers trying to escape. It gave off this... hum.

I yanked it out. Burned it.

When I planted another tree in its place, I checked my watch just as I finished covering the roots.

3:33 PM.

The ground sank beneath my shovel. I dug, heart pounding—and there it was.

The body.

Only this time it looked worse. Older, more decayed. More symbols. And something was stitched into its mouth.

I didn’t call the police this time. I drove to the sheriff’s office in person. Made a scene. Demanded an investigation.

They came back. Searched.

Again, nothing.

I was fined $500 for repeated false emergency reports, and warned that one more call could result in misdemeanor charges—up to 1 year in jail under state law.

So I stopped reporting.

But I didn’t stop finding them.

At 3:33 AM, or 3:33 PM, the ground would open, just slightly, and I’d see more corpses. Always in the same place. Always more symbols. Some looked like they were trying to climb out.

Sometimes the dirt closed on its own.

Then I started dreaming of them.

Always the same thing: I’m in the garden. There’s something buried inside me. Someone is standing over me, whispering something in Latin. And then they start to dig into my throat. With their fingers.

Last week, I woke up bleeding from my mouth. My sheets were covered in dirt.

I don’t remember what happened after that. They say I was found naked in the middle of the field, screaming in a language no one understood. The sheriff said this was the third time I caused a "panic" in town.

Now I’m in a county jail, awaiting court. They’re charging me under Section 268, and disturbing the peace. The police think I’ve gone nuts.

They’re wrong.

There’s something in that ground. Something that remembers.

And it wants me to remember, too.

I hear it every night in my cell, scratching at the floor beneath my bed.

Waiting for 3:33.

The prisoner who wrote it—Inmate #3381, Michael R.—was reported missing from his locked cell at exactly 3:33 AM on the morning of June 14th.

Guards found the floor beneath his bed cracked open, the dirt beneath freshly disturbed.

There were no signs of escape or forced entry.

The hole was filled back in... by the time backup arrived.
