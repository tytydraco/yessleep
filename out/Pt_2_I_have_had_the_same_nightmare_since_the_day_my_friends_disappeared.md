They expected me to just sit in my room.  I remember dying on the inside just sitting there.  But I couldn't keep from staring at my camera. Everyday I thought, I could try and get proof. Take my camera and find wherever my friends were at, and get pictures to prove to everyone I'm not just some dumb kid who is making things up. As I sat there "grounded till my eighteenth birthday" of course, my thoughts switched to just anger and defiance.  I thought this is bullshit, they wanted me to sit and stew because I messed up, but I told them the truth and yet I'm still in trouble. I had been told my whole life, that as long as I told the truth my parents would have my back no matter what. And now, I needed that to be the most true and I had nothing. The two people I was always supposed to depend on to be my support, were basically telling me to fuck off. 
Don't get me wrong, I understand hearing your son tell you the reason he isn't doing what he is supposed to do is because of some man bird, I see that, now. It's hard when you don't see the crazy, unimaginable thing, someone is telling you is there, again I understand that now. I just know at that point, I couldn't figure out why no one would believe me, and after sitting and staring at my camera and staring at the window I decided, screw sitting there just waiting for my friends to not be found, I was going to go get the proof, trouble be damned and show my parents and everyone that I wasn't lying. Show everyone that there is some asshole stalking the neighborhood. 


I grabbed the camera that my grandma gave me as a Christmas gift, made sure it had film and was ready to actually take pictures. I know I'm a child but I also have seen enough horror movies to know you don't leave a safe place to get proof of something without making sure the way you are getting that proof is actually going to work.  I had a note that I had been writing on for the whole time I was grounded, explaining to my parents I was sorry and where I was going and what I was doing.  That way at least if something happened maybe they would find my body and the rest of my friends, if nothing else. I walked over to the window and threw it open. It was somewhat early in the morning so I had plenty of time here it got dark.  I stared into the woods behind my house and  took a deep breath and had to re convince myself this wasn't the dumbest idea I had ever had. I climbed out of my window, and down the tree that man bird was sitting in to scare the shit out of me. When I reached the ground I took one look back at my house trying to not change my mind about what I was doing and booked it into the woods towards the direction of Johnny's house. I figured if that is the original place my friends met up, the best place to start looking was in that direction. 


You might say, (weren't you afraid you would get lost walking through the woods?) As much as I see that argument, those woods, we thought, had been thoroughly investigated by us. Me and Johnny had spent more hours than I can count in those woods. Laura, Jack and Daniel had also been through quite a bit just not as much as me and Johnny. However if this person had found some place hidden that we never got to, there is no telling how close he could have been to us every time we were in the woods and how long he had been watching us run around before he finally decided to make his move. 
There I stood at the edge of the woods,woods that I had up to this point had no fear of.  I just hoped no one would see me looking out of their window or something. I followed the trail that me and Johnny had mostly cut, not wanting to get away from that path. I kept looking around trying to focus in the distance for anything that was out of place. Anything that might ring of a "playhouse", or just some weirdo holding a bunch of kids against their will. Nothing, I saw nothing. 


I continued to walk, slowly working my way down the path we had made.  Every noise that came from the woods, every crack of a stick every flap of a bird wing was excruciating.  I thought with every sound I was about to be run up on by some nut job before I could realise what was happening. But I just kept telling myself I have to pull it together and continue.  I remember I even started to sing positive songs to myself to keep from getting scared like This Little Light Of Mine, but it really wasn't working. I finally reached the end of the man made path me and Johnny worked so hard to make where the vines and leaves were still thick. Me and Johnny had cut all the vines and limbs to make it easier to walk as well as took some of our dad's tools and tried to make the path cleaner and more defined. However here is where we stopped. 


That was at the end of summer before it turned cold and we started to care more about other things and not as much about running around the woods. I just stood there for a minute looking around. I just wanted to find something to prove me right, something that leads me to my friends. I wanted my friends back. I couldn't believe they were gone, they just couldn't be. I had to force myself to believe they were still alive, I just had to believe. 


I decided to try and push through some of the vines and limbs past where me and Johnny had stopped. When we were clearing everything, it was all extremely thick but we had "borrowed" our dads machetes to help so I expected to have to fight with the foliage and try not to get tangled in it.  I grabbed a few vines and went to jerk on them to see how hard they would be to move. The foliage easily shifted aside and it caught me off guard.  I was surprised and caught off guard that it moved so easily, almost like it was the beaded curtains that hang in doorways. I was caught off guard to the point I dropped the vines and took a step back. That was not that easy to mess with the last time I thought. We had to chop at that shit pretty hard the first time we had messed with it. 


I approached the spot again and wrapped my fingers around the vines and started pulling back and the whole thing folded back like a curtain. I couldn't believe it, it was like a theatre stage having the curtains pulled up to reveal the play. I couldn't believe my eyes I didn't understand.  Behind the vines as they lifted open, there was a large, what looked like crop circle that seemed as though someone had been working the plot of land for a bit of time, the same way me and Johnny did on the trail.  It seemed like whoever did this put much more work and effort into it. In the center of the circle was a fire pit that was smoldering like it had been used often and somewhat recent. I was dumbfounded, there was no way that was there when we stopped clearing this area out. We smelt no smoke, we yanked on all of the vines that last day hoping we could clear some more path easier and none of them moved.  So what in the world is this, who has decided to make their shelter out here in the woods behind our houses.  
I took a second and looked around making sure no one was coming up behind me or something and it seemed empty. I hoped maybe whoever was here had moved on.  


I stepped through the curtain and entered the opening letting the vines fall slack behind me. In the discovery of this crazy opening I almost forgot the reason I was here, why I was even risking my life. I pulled my camera up and started taking a few pictures. I slowly stepped further in hoping this would be something, but I knew there was no way it would be enough. I had to find something more for anyone to take me seriously. I needed to find concrete proof. I started walking around the fire pit looking for anything that would point me in the right direction. I was bending down pushing around a piece of trash that looked like a beer can and maybe some old Polaroids of what looked like animals being skinned and candy wrappers.  I stood up after giving up on finding anything in the fire pit and looked to my right, when something caught my eye. There was a weird arch, almost like someone had gone to a store and bought a yard decoration a few feet away from where I was crouching down.  


It was made with tree limbs flowers and some other trash but oddly it was intertwined with what looked like colorful birthday streamers. I didn't understand. I walked over towards it keeping my head on a swivel and looked at it closer.  I can understand the limbs and stuff but why birthday supplies. I pulled my camera out and took a couple of pictures before I heard a limb snap behind me. I froze, I just kept repeating curse words because how careless I was being not paying attention.  After taking a deep breath I whirled around looking at the area it came from. It was a thick group of trees and I couldn't see anything. I feel like I stood there for ten minutes squinting at the area trying to focus but it was more like two probably and I never saw anything. After satisfying my fear to the point I could bring myself back to the task at hand I turned back around and started studying the arch again. I just wanted something to be there, anything that would show me my friends were here, anything at all but there was just nothing. Disappointment flooded over me as I took a deep breath. I walked further under the arch seeing if it actually led anywhere or if it was just a decorative arch.  I had prepared myself for a bittersweet disappointment. I stepped under the arch and looked up as I walked through and stopped for a minute.  All I could think was it couldn't be, my pink panther toy?


I received a toy of the pink panther from the cartoon for a birthday one year. However I took it outside playing with it and I accidentally left it once but when I returned to find it later there was no sign of it. (Why is this here). I pulled my camera out and took a picture. After taking a couple pictures I started to inch my way forward continuing to keep my head on a swivel and slowly entered another area that had also been cleared out. I remember looking back towards the neighborhood and could still slightly see the end of the tree line where it opened into the neighborhood. I figured if nothing else someone could still hear if I screamed, or at least, I hoped.


"What the hell?"


I stated out loud before realizing how loud I was being, as I stepped through the arch.  Laying on the ground were a lot of deflated birthday balloons and some hanging from the trees and bushes.  There were more colorful streamers and in the center of the opening was an old rickety looking table  surrounded by some shitty looking wooden chairs. The table had what looked like a moldy rotting birthday cake and plates with smaller pieces of the cake on them sitting in front of each chair. The surrounding chairs had something sitting in each of them that I couldn't really see. I took a few pictures from a far and slowly moved forward towards the table trying to figure out what was in the chairs. From the distance it looked like terribly made stuffed animals. But someone made them out of chicken skin instead of fur.  If you've ever seen a chicken before it is cooked you'll know what I mean. I walked towards the table creeping up on inanimate objects like they are going to come to life and attack me.  The closer I got to the table the more I wanted to throw up.  The smell was horrendous.  I didn't know if I could stand the small to get close enough to see what was there.  


I was able to fight through my nausea after a few deep breaths and gags and stepped up to the table, my hands shaking as I placed them on the rough, unkept table top to take a look at the thing in the chair nearest to me.  I stared closer at the stuffed thing next to me, attempting to hold myself together. It looked familiar, I have never seen a stuffed animal like this though. Along with the pale skin, you could see where the sections had been stitched together.  It was a terrible stitching job, it kind of looked like when a kindergartener is given the yarn to sew together their first felt teddy bear.  Surrounding all of the stitching was a dark brownish red stain.  The thing really looked more human than animal at this point.  It had long brown hair although it seemed to be falling out in chunks.  The eyes on it had become a bit cloudy but I could still see a hint of green showing through.  As I looked closer and stared deeper into the eyes of this thing, it slowly became clear to me what I was looking at. This specific thing I was looking at, was Laura. Well it was Laura's skin sewed up shittily and stuffed with leaves and straw and other things off of the ground. Discovering what I was looking at I fell back.  In the process I apparently grabbed at something to steady myself and gripped a different chair pulling it over with me and having what was in it fall on me.  


Staring me straight in the face, another one of those abominations, this was johnny.  I threw the body off of me and stumbled to my feet.  I regrettably had begun to realize what this was. All of them, lumpy, terribly sewed back together flesh sacks.  What was I supposed to do at this point. I stood there staring at my friends stuffed like dirt old teddy bears. I couldn't move, and as much as I wanted to run all I could do was stare, to feel like I was about to vomit. And vomit I did, I remember letting the contents of my stomach go.  In the midst of this I could swear I heard leaves crackling closer and closer but I didn't have time to finish vomiting and look towards the sound of electricity arcing.  I felt a sharp, stabbing, shooting pain radiate from my side, my whole body seized up, my teeth slammed together and my jaw locked up, my breath was knocked out of me and all I could taste was metallic before my ears started ringing and everything went black.  


I remember I didn't completely go out but for a minute, before I regained my fuzzy consciousness. The problem was with my consciousness returning my muscles were still very weak and all my senses had not returned. I felt someone moving me around, a large set of hands attached to long lanky skinny arms. My vision was still blurry and in a tunnel almost. My breathing was somewhat labored but at least I was able to breathe. I attempted as hard as I could to fight. Tried to see who this person was that had ahold of me, do anything to get away and back to my mom and dad. Then I slowly realized what was going on. I felt the two large hands release me but I was still unable to move.  I remember being a little bit in and out pretty groggy and slowly I regained the ability to actually see clearly and the ringing in my ears subsided mostly but everything tingled, like little bugs were crawling underneath my skin. I still had the taste of metal in my mouth that never did go away and all I wanted was water. 


I tried to move, raise my arms and stand up but I couldn't.  Every time I tried to shift to stand I felt something rub against my skin. I had been tied to a fucking chair. The first thing I did, was attempt to rock back and forth and shake irrationally, and move, just nothing happened.  The chair was apparently heavy as shit because through all of my jerking and ting to tip it over it barely moved. I stopped trying to catch my breath and took a moment to try and reassess my situation. Try and figure out what was going on and how to get out of this. I took a deep breath and looked around me. I saw the friends I once had in their terrible state and I had to hold in a scream of secondary shock. I saw the rotting food and then my eyes caught the raggedy stage in the distance.  It was some shitty rotting wood.  Tattered curtains hung from posts that looked like they were about to fall down from the weight.  On the stage was an empty metal chair frame. Not a chair, the fabric and stuff had all rotted out of it but a metal chair frame and a rickety stool with a dirty record player that had no power cored.  At that point the only option I could think of came to me.


"Help! Help me! Someone help! He..."


Before I got the rest of the word out I had something shoved in my mouth.  Whatever it was almost made me throw up again.  It was grotesque to say the least.  It was like having a gym sock shoved in my mouth from a football player who left their dirty socks in their dark locker all week before taking his clothes home to wash them.   


"Shut up!"


 A voice shouted, that looking back now sounded like someone doing a bad imitation of Joker from batman, before it dropped into a more calm calculated version as two large hands at an uncomfortable speed moved from my back to either side of my neck on my shoulders before digging their fingers into my chest like they were trying to literally attempt to feel my organs with their finger tips.  I felt someone leaning their face in closer as I felt hot breath on my ear and smelt rotten eggs.  As they whispered.


"I can't finish getting ready for the show with all of your yelling. That's very rude you know, and you are making the rest of the guests veeeery uncomfortable."


My eyes popped wide open.  I was left again sitting, staring at the grotesque scene that was laid out in front of me. I couldn't tell what was going on behind me, I just heard shuffling and things moving around and the random giggle and chuckle that about made my skin crawl. All the noise stopped and I heard footsteps on the dirt headed towards the stage as the man finally revealed himself to me.  A tall, thin man with a semi limp walked to the stage.  His outfit was tattered brown dress pants or at least the stains seemed to dye them brown with what looked like blood or urine or shit or a combination of all three, I don't know they were pretty dirty.  He had an old ratty brown suit coat with a brown patch on one elbow and the other hanging halfway off.  It only had one button left and no shirt underneath but one of those bibs that only come down to your stomach that look like you are wearing a dress shirt with a bow tie. A blackish top hat which was the only part of his outfit that looked somewhat new and large clown shoes that looked like they one time were bright red and at that point looked like they were worn for years. The color had faded, and there were holes in the toe of one each so they flopped every time he stepped. His pants stopped at his calves like capri pants and he had one nasty polkadot sock on his right foot. I tried to stare a hole in this asshole with contempt and fear.


(A fucking clown)


Is all I could think. You know when you're in a situation like this, it seems as though there would be all kinds of life changing thoughts. How your life would change, how you'd be a better person if you can just get out, but no, just the thought that a fucking clown was about to be the last thing I saw, I fucking hated clowns.  I had a birthday that was ruined because the clown that was supposed to be there never showed and my dad tried to entertain the crowd.  It went absolutely terrible.  Hell I was made fun of for weeks at school. The clown strutted to the stage and stepped up onto the creaky wood platform as he sauntered side to side his shoes slapping the stage while doing spirit fingers with his back turned to me. He stopped and whirled around still doing spirit fingers on each side of his face as though I was a new born and bending at the waist with one leg also bent and one straight stomping his heel on the floor. He had terrible mostly faded clown make up on, that seemed lacquered to his skin as though he never washed it off and his nasty yellowed teeth showed through a terrifying smile that seemed too big for his face outlined with overly chapped lips the makeup attempted to hide. A shiver ran down my spine as I thought of those teeth being right next to my ear.  His eyes felt like they were drilling through me like he was trying to stare straight into my soul.


"Well hello there."


He said moving his hands over his head in the shape of a rainbow.


"I would like to welcome you back to Mr. Pickles Playhouse. Where everyone is welcome. And there is a smile on everyone's face."


He said as he still just eyed me like a hunter with a deer in its scope.  He snapped his head to the metal frame of a chair on stage next to him.


"Henry, you didn't tell me we were having any new guests. I didn't have time to prepare for guests."


The clown sneered at the empty chair.


"Well I guess I will just have to see what I can pull out of my hat real quick."


He pulled the top hat off of his head and flipped it around twirling it in his hands. He then waved his hand in front of it and tipped it showing the inside. The top of the hat was ment there. I could see straight through it.


"As you see there is nothing in the hat.  No trap doors here folks."


 He lifted the hat up and placed it on the table.


"Now watch as out of nowhere I pull a rabbit from my hat. Be amazed!"


He exclaimed before his eyes went wide showing how bloodshot they were like he hadn't slept in days.  He stared at me as though he was demanding I show some emotion at his lackluster performance even though I had my mouth stuffed with some cloth and was tied to a chair. He slowly rotated his head back to the hat and stared in disappointment with those same wide bloodshot eyes.  Of course he reached into the hat and pulled nothing out. He lifted the hat and stuck his hand through the bottom before taking an exasperated breath and shoving the hat back on his head. He sneered at the chair again with an aggressive whisper.


"What the hell Henry, I told you to prepare the hat. I told you to get my stuff ready and what do you do, nothing."


He  slowly turned his gaze back to me as though he forgot I was there and smiled with that uncanny grin.  He twirled around and raised his arms making a show of it.


"Ok well let's move on."


He then reached into his pocket and began pulling out a dirty handkerchief. I'm pretty sure it was meant to be one of those never ending handkerchiefs but he didn't seem to have more than two tied together. When the second one came out of his pocket he continued to pull at empty air before he looked down in disbelief before awkwardly exclaiming.


"Ta dah!"


The clown dropped the handkerchief and turned on his empty chair partner with a sneer and laid into him about not having things prepared before he took the chair and threw it off the side of the stage. The clown turned back and collected himself, straightening his fake bowtie.


"Sorry folks my assistant He Ray was feeling a bit sick and had to take a break.  I will now perform a musical number for your enjoyment."


He reached over to the record player and clicked the power button.  Nothing not a sound, but he seemed very pleased. He began to dance around awkwardly slapping his shoes on the stage and singing a song about a sad clown who just wanted to make the world smile. As he danced he stepped off of the stage with all my wishes that he would trip failing he continued to shuffle his way towards where I was sitting at the head of the table.  Just passed me the sounds of feet shuffling on dirt and terrible singing with no music stopped and his shit eating grin turned to me, looking at me with that giant toothy grin and those bloodshot eyes. He began to mess around in his pocket before yanking a giant knife out and pressing the point into my cheek.


"Well now Benjamin, why aren't you smiling.  All of your friends are enjoying themselves, what is wrong with you, you disrespectful, unappreciative little shit."


He walked over to where I had knocked Johnny, and Laura over.  It wasn't till this moment I realized that all of my friends had large smiles cut into their faces and sewed back together to keep the shape from going away.


"See little Laura and Johnny can't even set up straight in their chairs they are having so much fun.


He returned and pressed the knife into my cheek again.


 "Now, I'm going to cut this tape off so that I can see that beautiful smile of yours. Just know Benjamin if you scream I'll force you to smile forever."


He pulled the knife out of my cheek where I am pretty sure I felt some blood trickle.  He pulled the thing out of my mouth and as I saw it I threw up in my mouth as it looked like a dirty polkadot sock. The clown clapped cheerfully and giggled like a little kid sneaking a cookie, before raising his foot up sliding the sock halfway back on his foot and proceeded to dance his way back towards the stage, singing all the way.  He stomped his way back on stage and finished his song, finally.  He glared at me, as he tried to catch his breath, the same way h glared at the empty chair, before grabbing the record player and smashing it on the ground. I guess I wasn't giving him the satisfactory response to this craziness as he wanted, you know seeing as how I was a child and was more quivering in fear than smiling and clapping and having fun. He crouched down and  jumped off the stage.  In slow plotting steps, awkwardly clipping in his shitty clown shoes almost having to high step his way to me. I remember he almost gave me a look of insane disappointment.


"I expected better of you Benjamin."


He knocked Danny out of the chair he was sitting on,  And seemed to almost collapse onto the chair himself crossing his long skinny legs.  He laid one long skinny arm across his lap and propped his elbow on his thigh pointing the knife at me.


"I waited so long and did so much preparation just for you.  Just to be able to give you the show and the birthday party you deserved. I even brought all of your friends together to celebrate with us. You know I should have been the one at your birthday party not your fucking dad, but no your parents had to go and stick their noses where they didn't belong. You know the do not enter sign on the back of my truck wasn't just there for decoration. However it was really only there for children.  I didn't think it needed to be clarified for adults as well. Now I do all this work, all for you Benjamin.  All for you you little shit!  And what, do you do!"


I couldn't comprehend at the time what he was talking about. All I could think at the time was how did he know my name and all of my friends names, who was the crazy man dressed as a clown and what in the hell was he talking about. I didn't have a birthday party with a clown, my parents said they planned one for me but some things happened and they had to change last minute.  I've never had a clown at a birthday party though.


"You sit there like a knot on a log, no smile, no reaction, at least you could clap along to the music.  Like a spoiled little shit who doesn't know what entertainment is if it stabbed you in the face."


He grinned that big smile and giggled before turning away from me on the seat and crossing his arms as though he was a pouting child that didn't get what he wanted, as though he was trying to shame me.


"You know, I used to be somebody, kid. I had a name, I had built myself a empire of entertainment.  Do you know what it's like to have worked your whole life and achieved your goals just to have the rug pulled out from under you.  You know that act used to kill, and Henry wasn't a lazy asshole that didn't pull his weight.  Now look at me. Doing shows for ungrateful brats.  Kid maybe you'll understand one day.  Then you'll appreciate all that I did for you today.  Maybe you can book me for your kids parties."


Then it was like he snapped out of his pittyparty and in a split second reminded himself of something.


"But it was you, your the one that fucked everything up for me. It was your birthday party and your stupid nosey parents that caused me all the problems in my life."


At this point he had turned back to me and started waving the knife in my direction. He pushed the knife towards me placing the tip in my cheek again. It felt like he was about to pierce my skin and give me the smile he threatened me with earlier. At that point everything came crashing down on me in a moment of realization. I started to cry and I remember thinking I was going to die and no one knew where I was. My parents thought I was in my room serving my grounding sentence and they wouldn't have seen my note unless they came up to my room.  But they had no reason until late afternoon since that is when I was allowed out of my room to do chores and eat. No one would even know I was gone. I couldn't believe I was going to die in the woods by myself with this wacko. He pulled the knife back awAy from my cheek and started waving it at me.


"See I had a good system kid, I just had to stay unassuming enough to not draw any extra attention more than just my shows. But your fucking dad had to stick his nose where it didn't belong. I made one mistake and your dad being the good little boy he was couldn't help but call the cops could he?"


I was finally able to stammer something out


"I...I don't know...I don't know what you're talking about. Please just let me go."


He stopped and stared at me with those bloodshot eyes and oversized yellow grin before tapping himself in the forehead with the side of the blade.  He jumped up throwing the chair back a few feet.


"Boy, you don't understand.  See I ma gonna let ya go. After I skin ya and add ya to my audience, permanently.  Just like ya friends, you'll be returned just not with ya skin. You need not worry, you gonna be reunited with ya family before too long."


It was like he started to break down.  His voice became completely different and he started pulling at his hair and slapping himself in the side of the head.  


"I'll make it quick, don't ya worry boy."


All of a sudden he stopped and turned his head slightly as though he were listening for something.


"Look man I won't tell anyone just pleas..."


"Shut the fuck up!"


He whispered in an aggressive tone at me.  Then I heard what he was listening to. The faintest sound of voices. The faintest sound of hope.  In a very distant yellow I swore I heard my dad saying my name.  Like a savior from a distance.


"Benjamin!  Benjamin!  Where the hell are you at!"


Were they looking for me?  They sounded so far away.


"Don't fucking make a sound."


He hissed at me again.  I felt the knife pressing hard just under my chin but I had only one chance, I really didn't think I was getting out alive either way so I just thought fuck it and decided to scream out hoping someone would hear me and come looking in this direction.  


"HELP!  HELP!  IM OVER HERE!  SOMEON..."


Looking back on that decision it was probably stupid but then again I'm pretty sure it's the least stupid decision I had made all day, and I figured it was my only chance.  I figured if I hadn't no one would look further than that curtain of vines and he was going to skin me and stuff me like my friends.  As soon as I blurted out the words, the clown jerked, and I guess I caught him off guard as he sliced up my cheek barely missing my eye.  I started to hear rustling in the bushes nearby and yelled more.  I yelled as loud as I could just hoping someone would get close enough before this psycho did anything else.  Before anyone could get too close to his nightmare theatre I felt him lean down to my ear.


"Remember the scar I gave you today boy.  I will see you again and you will be my audience for good."


He took a deep breath in as though he were smelling me and licked up my ear catching some of where he sliced my face running off into the woods behind where the opening sat.  I never saw where exactly he went.  I was just happy that he had left me alone.  Sure he left me alone tied to a chair and staring at all of my friends but he left me alone.  I started yelling and screaming louder now out of not only fear but disgust as well trying to direct someone to my voice.  Before too long multiple police and my parents and other kids parents busted through the arch blocking off the opening from view.  I didn't see much after this as I was cut loose and hoisted up in my dad's arms and they removed me as fast as possible.  The only thing I remember was before my dad got to me, as someone was cutting me free, a policeman was showing him a pamphlet.  My dad dropped his head into his hand and took a deep breath before approaching me and repeating how sorry he was over and over again, as he carried me out of the woods.
I was given the night to sleep and was told we would talk in the morning but for the time being, get some rest.  
The next day my parents sat me down and told me some history of the neighborhood.  But I'll save that maybe for another time. 


That brings me to today.  The first time I have returned to the place of my nightmare.  The place where I lost all of my friends and almost my life.  It just doesn't feel the same here now.  Not because of all of the development.  It feels as though at any moment Mr Pickles could show up and finish the job he wanted to before he was interrupted.  Maybe one day I'll get over it and forget but, I don't know if or when that will ever happen.
