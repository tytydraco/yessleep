>!CONTENT WARNING: DECAY, VIOLENCE, MURDER MENTIONED!<



It all started with almost one hundred calls to the Lake County Police Department the day that Mercy Haskins had her fit. Most of them were parents, others were kids from the school that witnessed her outburst. 

Everyone had different statements about what they saw, and every officer had differing opinions and written reports about what happened that day. I was one of them. 

Besides the yellow tape and sea of terrified kids, the scene was extraordinarily bare compared to other homicide scenes I’ve been on. When I walked onto the scene, it was relatively bloodless, but it was just as vile. 

Something I’ve not been able to shake is the stifling, suffocating feeling that made my mouth go dry and bitter when I stepped into the hall where it happened. I can’t describe it properly, but it was the same sort of naive shame and seething hatred you felt when your parents were angry with you when you were a kid. The feeling was simple, but full of intensity. Like an aura encapsulating the hall. 

It made me want to run as far away as I could, the instinct to run away biting back against how much I steeled myself to step in further. There was also a pungent smell in the air, and it had three very distinct notes I can still smell, like it's hung itself in the hairs of my nose. The wet, clingy smell of mildew was the most prominent, along with decay, and burned plastic. It made the rotting and severed head of Mercy’s math teacher covered in lacerations and bugs even worse to look at.

The head had to be weeks old at that point, flesh falling off of the cheekbones, and the soft rotting skull dented in where it was dropped on the floor. Bile came up the back of my throat as my stomach lurched and tightened while I tried not to be sick. I had to plug my nose and look away, something I’ve never done in my few years of working as a homicide detective. I don’t know if that’s something to be proud of or not.

Regardless, I was assigned to the case, despite not knowing any details about it other than the head and Mercy’s outburst. Originally, this was thought to be an open and shut one, but I’ve been on break from the case for about two weeks now, because the girl is still recovering in the hospital. The doctors think she may have gone catatonic, or is in a fugue state. Some investigators tried to do an interview with her, but it didn’t go well. Which is unsurprising, considering she hasn’t talked at all since the incident.

For the time being, I’ve been stewing over it, thinking about every piece of evidence we’ve collected (which I obviously can’t share here because of confidentiality laws) so far, and I can’t seem to get rid of this dread about everything involved. The evidence, the crime, and the girl herself is something I can’t take my mind off of. Even in my other cases, my mind slithers back to Mercy’s, because of how unusual it feels.

 I do wish I could say more, but I can’t, both because of the confidentiality laws and because the department hasn’t made an official statement yet. Saying anything would be a gamble I don’t feel comfortable taking yet. 

 I understand how ridiculous this makes me sound, and like I’m withholding information to make it more mysterious, but I promise I’m not. I’ll update whenever the statement is released if any of you are really that curious—I just needed to find a place to get all of this out for the moment, because of how much space it was taking up in my head. I’ve tried other forums, but no one paid any attention, or gave advice. I hope you all don’t mind my short little rant here, despite how blown out of proportion it may sound. 

Take care, and Happy New Year. Hopefully I’ll hear something soon, or take my mind off of it. Either way, I hope whatever has come over me ends soon.
