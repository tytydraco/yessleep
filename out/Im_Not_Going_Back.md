I never believed in superstition or the supernatural. Still, even then, I found myself face-to-face with something beyond explanation. Now, I don't know if I should regret it or laugh at the situation I found myself in.

Just weeks prior, I was dangling from a tree, a deep gash on the side of my head, blood dripping toward the ground as something laughed at my expense. I was just glad someone found me before anything worse could happen.

My name is Mike, and like most people my age, I'm stubborn, reckless, and now very bored. I shot myself in the foot by agreeing to come to this place.

You see, my parents forced, ahem, I mean asked me to visit my grandfather's grave in another country, as well as reconnect with family we hadn't seen in a long time.

Yippee…

I didn't want to be there, especially not in a place where the internet moved slower than a snail. So, I sought distractions elsewhere.

We were in a heavily forested area, far from the city, so I got it in my head to venture into the forest just to escape. Before my mom's old friends could find me and hit me with another round of "Do you have a girlfriend?" before shoving a picture of their daughter in my face.

I was just done at that point and wandered off. And, as you probably guessed, I got lost.

Who would've thought right? Not my stupid brain, that's for sure.

I must have spent hours circling around that damn place until I found myself leaning against a massive, ancient tree. I rested for a bit when I suddenly felt something.

All the water I had chugged earlier (just to escape conversation) was catching up to me. I needed to pee. Badly.

Without a second thought, I relieved myself on the tree. Sweet release. Finally. As the last drops trickled, I heard something, and when I looked up, I saw a very angry old man storming toward me, shouting something I couldn't understand. But I didn't need to. His face said it all.

Roughly translated, I think he was yelling, "What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here! What have you done?!"

At that point, I should have run. But before I could even react, the old man grabbed me in a vice grip and dragged me away from the tree. I hadn't even zipped up my pants yet.

After a bit, I managed to fix myself, but the old man kept ranting in my ear as he dragged me along. The only reason I didn’t start a fight right then and there was because I recognized him, he was from the village. That was at least some relief. More importantly, he knew the way home. If only he would shut his mouth, I could practically feel the saliva slapping me in the face.

I just wanted to plug in my headphones in that moment, but I had a feeling that would only make things worse.

When we finally reached the main road, he still didn't let go. Instead, he hauled me straight to my mother, who looked like she was about to tear into me. Great…

I braced myself for a scolding, but the old man spoke to her before she could even start. That was my chance, I slipped inside and plopped down next to my cousins, who didn't even seem to notice I'd been gone for hours.

Then Mom came back.

I stood up, preparing for a lecture, but what I didn't expect was the fear in her eyes. Before I could ask, she grabbed me and dragged me toward the old man again. Now, I was getting worried. My dad was there, too, looking at me with the same expression.

I had never been so nervous that I could hear my own heartbeat, until now. As my parents whispered frantically with the old man, a suffocating feeling settled over me. I was sweating, and I didn’t even know why.

Then, the old man turned to me. He was holding a knife.

At that moment, I saw my life flash before my eyes. But what he did next made my heart stop.

And maybe, just maybe, made me shit my pants a little.

He slashed at something.

I hadn't noticed it before, but there was a dead chicken on the table, hanging upside down, its blood dripping into a bowl.

The old man dipped his fingers into the blood and began chanting some scripture I didn't recognize. Then, he smeared the blood onto my forehead, arms, and neck like I was some kind of damn street art.

I wanted to protest and demand an explanation, but seeing my mom crying and my dad's usually jolly face looking grave shut me up. I just sat there as the old man continued his whatever crazy thing he was doing.

That night, my parents slept beside me for the first time in years. Well, my mom did, dad stayed awake on the sofa next to the bed, sitting in that thinking pose he does when he's stressed.

As for me? I just lay there awkwardly while my mom whispered for me to sleep. The worst part? The blood was still smeared on me. Come on, that’s just gross. But when I tried to wash it off, Mom threw a fit.

With no choice, I just did what my mom was saying.

I don't know what time of the night it was, but I was jolted awake. I felt something. I did not know how to explain it. Then, my nose was assaulted by a smell.

But before I could even think about it, my feet were tugged like someone was grabbing it.

I thought it was Dad, but when I looked, I saw my mom turned away from me, still asleep. My dad was dozing off in the chair.

Groggy, I tried to sit, only to be yanked violently off the bed.

My head slammed against the wooden frame, and everything went black.

The next thing I know, I woke up feeling something rough scraping against my back. I was being dragged.

I struggled, but my body felt like lead, my limbs sluggish, my head pounding. Dirt filled my mouth as I gasped, my fingers clawing at the ground, but whatever had me wasn't stopping.

Then, it did.

I coughed, tried to sit up with all the strength I had left, and quickly looked behind me.

At this point, I was now vigilant, but what I saw made my eyes wide as I was in the forest area, and a familiar tree stood before me.

Then, I heard something move. A putrid stench hit me, thick and disgusting like an uncleaned urinal left to rot. My eyes darted to the tree line, where two glowing eyes peered at me from the darkness.

I froze, then instinctively backed away only to slam into the tree. By God, I almost cried. I’d completely forgotten my back was already bruised from being dragged. But even through the pain, I remembered what my dad always taught me, *never take your eyes off a threat.*

The silhouette was small, too small to be human. Too small even for a child.

It stared at me, filled with something worse than rage. Pure, suffocating malice.

Then it grinned.

Every instinct screamed at me to run but I couldn’t. Something coiled around my ankles, yanking me upside down in an instant. A branch. It had stretched unnaturally from the tree, wrapping around me like a noose. But that wasn’t the worst part.

My head had slammed against the trunk when I was pulled up, leaving a deep gash on the side of my skull. I could feel warm blood dripping down, tickling my temple. Then, I heard it, a giggle. High-pitched. Mocking. My breath hitched as I forced myself to look up… or rather, *down*  
  
Staring me in the face was a tiny, naked, human-looking creature if I could call it even that. Its face looked old, very old, wrinkled, and it was grinning, and now it was laughing at me.

Next, that smell… assaulted my nose, and I discovered where it came from. It was the creature below me.

It picked up a stone and started throwing it at me, howling with laughter like this was all some kind of game.

The smell grew worse, suffocating me. My vision blurred. The creature was still laughing, still throwing stones.

**I screamed for the first time in my life, like a girl who just broke all her nails.**

**The creature? It just laughed harder.**

But then, I heard footsteps, many of them. Through teary eyes, I saw flashlights. The old man. Others from the village. They rushed toward me.

One of them climbed the tree and sliced through the branch, holding me up. I fell, caught by the others.

The next thing I knew, my mom was hugging me, sobbing.

As for the creature, the moment I heard footsteps, it was gone.

Time passed. My dad and the others chopped down the tree and burned it.

We left the village after that. I'm never going back.

But sometimes…

I still catch a faint, awful smell lingering in the air.

My mom says it's just my imagination.

But she knows. I know.

And my dad does [too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/)
