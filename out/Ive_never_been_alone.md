Since I was a kid I always felt like I was never alone, it didn’t matter if I stayed in another house or my grandparents room, there was always something staring at me trying to get close, every morning when everybody got up in my grandmas house I would tell everyone the night before to please leave the light on until I get up and they never did, my imagination played me many games especially that the floor was full of snakes. One time I even screamed to the top of my lungs that I couldn’t sleep that something was staring at me and started crying so much my aunt got scared because I couldn’t control myself I was 8.

The first “encounter” I ever had with a paranormal activity happened when I was 6 years old, just like I said nobody would leave the light on so I was just there building up courage in my mind trying not to look around the room and ignore the noises, for some reason I decided to start singing to calm myself down, I sang twinkle twinkle little star and you know the song so to make the story short when I was singing it the second time the phrase “where you are” something or “someone” pulled the pillow I had under my head from behind with SUCH A STRENGTH like it was MAD I swear to god, I heard the “thud” of the pillow hitting the wall that was behind the bed. I got so scared but I’ve always been too curious so I counted until 3 and turned really fast, the pillow was placed against the wall and then I looked at the closet, that corner of the room seemed darker than usual.  That afternoon I didn’t give a single f if the floor was full of snakes I got out of the room so quickly and didn’t tell anybody. 

My grandmas closet is full of memories but I don’t know if it holds something, I still love that closet, I used to hide in there because I liked the smell of old wood but every time I did that I always felt like I could stop time or that something in the room couldn’t see me anymore, one time I even saw my grandma walking in the room when I was in the closet and when I asked her if she went in the room she said no but I swear I saw her come in and it looked exactly like her. 

I remember it like it was yesterday cause nothing felt the same after that and I suddenly lost all fear as a kid, I became numb af to the point I was expecting something to happen again. Something more clear. I’ve always been too curious and hope that doesn’t get the cat killed.

That was just the start of all the things that had happened to me, the rest became worse with the years, I just found this place on Reddit, I’ll probably post the rest and doesn’t matter if someone reads them or no but this demons/entities or ghost however you call them are all around.
