I brought [the box](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kz5wb0/the_funeral_game_part_2/) down to Joel’s basement. He flinched when he saw the key. “I can’t do this again,” he said.

I knew convincing him to play the Funeral Game would be harder than last time, but I had to try. “I need someone to walk the circles and dig up the grave,” I said. “I’m not asking you to go in the coffin.”

“I don’t want to lose you too, man. I’ve been through enough.”

“You don’t have to lose anyone else. If this works, maybe we can get Abby back.”

He started pacing. I doubted I could get anyone else to believe the game was real. I imagined myself in that dark, cramped box underground, gasping for air while my friends gave up looking for me and drove home. I gave him Collin’s letter.

He read with worried eyes. “It would take me all night to dig you up on my own.”

“Just don’t let the candle go out and I’ll still be there,” I said. “We can do this. We can find Abby.”

He read the letter again. After a long while, he answered. “If you come back troubled like this, it’s on you. Promise you won’t pass anything onto me.”

I promised Joel, hoping I could avoid whatever latched onto Collin in the first place. It didn’t have his body to haunt anymore.

\*\*\*

The groundskeeper had started locking the cemetery gate at night, so Joel parked by the roadside and we hopped the fence.

We climbed the hill and followed the ritual as before. This time, I unlocked the mausoleum myself and kept the key. Joel was done with it. Then, just like that, I was lying in the coffin. The night was warm, but I shivered uncontrollably.

I’ve sometimes wondered what dying would be like, to realize my time has run out. I’ve wondered what my final thoughts would be, if my life would feel complete. That night, it felt like death was there for me. I thought of Collin and Abby, and I thought of my family left wondering what could have happened.

 The lid groaned as it slid over me, but Joel stopped before he shut me in.

“This better work,” he said.

Then I was in the dark.

At first, all I could hear was the sound of my own breath. Then I felt the wood beneath me start to shift. It was as if the floor of the coffin was deteriorating, too weak to support my weight. Slowly, I sank into nothing. I could no longer hear my panting echo in the coffin. I had passed into a void, and I was falling.

As I tumbled, a cold, blue light illuminated the space below. I was rushing toward a reflection—water. The wind whistled in my ears, then I broke the surface. The water was shockingly cold and flowing gently. I had landed in a river. The light from above couldn’t reach through the murk, and I had this dreadful feeling that I wasn’t alone above the depths.

I scrambled to the surface and gasped for air. The river coursed through a tremendous cave. High over my head, the cave ceiling split to allow light down, but I couldn’t see the light’s source. I thought I could see stalactites reaching down from the rock, but as my eyes adjusted, they appeared to be the obelisks and headstones from the cemetery.

I didn’t see Abby or Collin anywhere. I could tread water for a little while, but I knew I would fatigue and drown if I didn’t find a way out of the river soon. Something splashed behind me. I spun in place to see a boat emerge from the shadows.

It was a small vessel just big enough for the two aboard. At the front of the boat sat a well-dressed man, patiently looking ahead with his arms folded in his lap. Behind him, another man in tattered robes pushed a long oar through the water.

I called out to them and swam over as quickly as I could. When I reached the boat, I grabbed onto the edge. Suddenly, the oarsman stopped and reached for me. He didn’t help me up, though.

He lifted my hand from the boat and dropped me back in the water.

“This journey is not for you,” he said, his voice thin and dry. “Go to shore and wait there. A way will open.”

He pointed to the riverbank on the edge of the light.

“I can’t go yet,” I shouted. “I’m here to bring someone back.”

The oarsman looked out into the dark, then back at me.

“You’ll find her there,” he said. “Her light has gone out, but you may take her with you as long as your fire still burns.”

He leaned in close so that I could see the glint of his eyes.

“When you pass through, take her by the hand and don’t look back. Let nothing else go with you.”

Then he took up his oar again and the two continued down the river.  

As I swam toward the shore, I felt again as if something else was in the river. I could sense the depths churning under me, but all I could hear was my own frantic splashing. Finally, I pulled myself onto the rocky riverbank.

From the shadows, someone called my name.

I turned and Abby wrapped her arms around me.

“What are you doing here?” she asked.

“I’m here for you. Collin said there was a way to bring you back.”

Her expression fell in the ghostly light and she sat down beside me.

“I saw Collin,” she said.

I asked if we could bring him back, too.

“He’s gone,” she shook her head. “Not long ago, I saw him in one of those boats. He told me you’d try to come here.”

“He was right,” I said. “He left the key for me.”

Abby looked out over the river, then lowered her voice.

“He said someone else would try to escape when the way out opens. There’s something down here.”

Heavy, booming knocks echoed all around the cave. One, two, three.

Abby pointed to the craggy wall down the shore. In the middle was a tall, wooden door, wider at the top like a coffin.

“There are doors like that all up and down the riverbank. Soon, a beacon will light over one of them, and that door will open. That’s our way out.”

I pictured a candle dancing above a grave somewhere in the cemetery. Then I recalled the pitiful flame dying in the rain the night we lost Abby.

“Abby, I’m sorry we didn’t get you out in time. It started raining. Joel’s brother showed up and we tried—”

“Don’t apologize,” Abby said. She was silent for a while. “I know you tried.”

 Then, she stood and helped me to my feet.

“We’ll have to hurry when the door opens,” she said.

“We’ll make it,” I tried to sound confident.

“Listen,” Abby wouldn’t let go of my hand. “Just before I saw Collin, something else came down here. I was there on the shore and something cast a huge shadow from above. I looked up and saw a man riding on this big, ugly winged thing. It smelled like death. They dove into the river, and I’ve been scared to go near the water ever since. Sometimes, I can see his eyes watching me in the dark.”

“We’ll have to be faster than him, then,” I said.

I don’t think time passes the same way down there. I surely lost track of it talking with Abby. We walked along the shore for a while. Abby asked about her family and what life was like since her disappearance. She said that Collin told her goodbye before his boat drifted away.

“The river leads far away from here. There’s something else after this place,” she almost smiled.

In a blinding flash, a beacon burst to life ahead of us. The door was higher than the rest, up a narrow flight of stairs.

“This is it!” I shouted. “Let’s go!”

My voice was drowned out by a terrible noise. Horns blared within the cave, chaotic and shrieking like vultures fighting over carrion. We turned to the river as something rose from the deep.

A bare, cracked cranium emerged first, followed by deep-socketed, gleaming eyes. This was the corpse I saw in the coffin, gaunt and decayed, now with a piercing gaze and deathly scowl. Black shrouds hung over his shoulders, but the beacon’s fire revealed metal across his chest, like a nobleman’s regalia or a warrior’s armor.   

He raised an arm slowly, as if it were too heavy, and pointed a sharp, black-tipped finger toward Abby. His sunken cheeks rose in the faintest hint of a smile, and with what appeared to be great effort, he spoke in a low, gravelly voice.

“Mea.”

His first steps were stilted and uneasy, but we didn’t wait for him to find his footing. Abby and I took off running for the open door. The horns sounded again and I could hear him gain traction behind us.

We reached the flight of steps and I stopped. I knew that he had his sights set on Abby, and if he made it through, she’d suffer the same fate as Collin. I dug into my pocket and turned to face the corpse.

“What are you waiting for?” Abby shouted.

He would be on top of us soon. I pulled my hand free and held the mausoleum key overhead. The corpse stopped all at once. The ruined tissue of his face contorted in scalding anger, and he stretched a bony hand out to me.

“Mea.”

I pitched the key as far as I could, and it sent up a splash in the river behind him. He looked back to me with a face constricted with rage, cracked lips bearing a mouth of long, gnashing teeth. I braced for him to lunge for us, but he turned to the river and plunged in after the sinking iron key.

I grabbed Abby’s hand and we ran up the steps. The horns blasted again and again, laughing voices rose up all around us, but I didn’t look back.

The beacon was still burning when Abby and I passed through the door. It slammed behind us and we fell into nothing, tumbling through the void again. As we flew through the dark, I could hear the corpse’s drowned voice speaking words I couldn’t understand. An incantation, a spell, a last curse to bid us good riddance.

And then we were in a box.

With our arms wrapped around each other, we barely had room to move, but I could tell that the coffin itself was moving.

“Are you ok?” she asked.

“I think so. What about you?”

“I’m alive,” she said, nearly laughing.

A stuttering, coughing commotion from outside hushed her, then something loud and close roared at our feet.

“It’s getting hot,” she said, panic rising in her voice. “Where did we go?”

I didn’t want to say it, but I feared the worst.

“I think we’re in the funeral home,” I said. “In the retort.”

“We just got back!” Abby slammed her elbow against the lid. “I don’t want to die so soon. Help me!”

We shoved as best we could against the coffin lid, the heat rising around us. It quickly became unbearable, and for the second time that night, I feared that my life was about to be snuffed out. What troubled me most, though, was knowing that Abby would suffer the same fate.

Then the flames died. The whole coffin rattled as it rolled back on its conveyor, and we came to a jarring stop. A shovel blade broke through under the lid.

“Watch out, we’re in here!” Abby said, wiping debris from her face.

“Sorry,” Joel’s nervous voice was music to my ears.

He pried the lid open, then helped us out of the scorched coffin. The smell of burnt wood was thick in the air, but we caught our breaths and hugged it out.

“How did you get back here?” I asked.

Joel held up his shovel.

“I saw the candle on top of the funeral home, so I let myself in. We’ll probably hear from Jason about that.” He turned to the hissing retort. “How did you get in *there*?”

“We must’ve gotten lost on the way back,” Abby said. She looked back into the blackened coffin. “We’d better get out of here. I don’t want to look at that thing anymore.”

Joel threw his shovel in the truck bed and started up the engine. Abby sat in the back with me.

\*\*\*

Abby ended up with a full ride to an out-of-state university, while Joel and I recently enrolled in community college. I don’t get to see her as often as I’d like, but we’re staying in touch. We don’t really have a choice.

When you pass through the door, I don’t think the game can tell one soul from another. I took some part of her with me, and I think she did the same. It’s not as obvious as Collin seeing a corpse in the mirror, but sometimes, I think I can hear her laugh. I feel a calm set in when she’s well, and pangs when she’s stuck on some unpleasant memory. It seems like we always know when to check in on each other.

I’ll probably hear from her again soon.
