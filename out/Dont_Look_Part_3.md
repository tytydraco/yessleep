We returned to the house yesterday at 11 a.m. to prepare for what ended up being the second most terrifying night of my life thus far.

Supplies List -

* 12 remote controlled LED lanterns
* 2 LED headlamps
* 2 Backup compact flashlights with wrist straps to avoid dropping them in a panic
* 2 Pairs of safety goggles that we painted black over the lenses
* 20 black out curtains

Upon unlocking the front door, both I and we'll call him Jacob for the sake of this post, stood just outside the doorway for several minutes, adverting our gazes, questioning every decision we've made in life thus far. I half expected to vanish the second I opened the door, my clothes dropping in a pile, as the shadow's would already be waiting for us on the other side.

A sense of eerie dread washed over me, and I couldn't tell if it was just my own fear, or some supernatural darkness that still lingered there. Even though the house was completely well lit by the sunlight of day, it took us both turning on our headlamps and fully illuminating the area just to begin to feel comfortable stepping inside.

I had made triple sure that the power bills for the house had been paid and even paid a handyman the day before to go inside and replace every light bulb and check that every light in the house was in working order.

We immediately got to work as the first thing we did by moving together and turning on every light in the house, to make sure it was as illuminated as possible. We noticed a few pairs of clothing as we moved, assuming that people had been squatting in the house, and that we needed to be on the lookout for intruders, but after discussing it some, came to the unfortunate conclusion that whoever had stayed the night there over these past years, had been taken as well.

Next, we went about placing the LED lanterns in strategic spots around the house to make sure our positions would have emergency lighting for if and when the power went out. We had managed to program them to one remote so that we should be able to activate them all at once in case of an emergency. But that was what was so tricky about our mission, is that if we intended to find answers, we couldn't fully illuminate the house tonight, or else the shadows either wouldn't appear, or would vanish before any information had been gleamed.

Our hopeful goal was to find Jacob's brother, let's call him Nathan, and then rid ourselves of any other shadows, if possible, to only communicate with him, as we knew he would not take us.

After the lights were set up, and tested to success, we began hanging up the black out curtains in such a manner so that if and when we had to run, we could use them as sight barriers on the way out, to cut off the shadows from our gaze.

The black painted goggles were sort of a last resort, to cover our eyes, and move blindly if we were surrounded and had no other choice.

Once everything was fully set up, and quadruple checked for battery life and functionality, we waited. We decided to post up in the hallway where Nathan and I would play at night, as we figured it would be the most likely place for him to appear, if he showed himself at all.

It was equal parts heartbreaking and terrifying being back there, hundreds of good memories playing out before my eyes as we worked around the house, all sullied by one week of horror. I could feel my family's absence palpably, and Nathan's for that matter. I could hear Chris' laugh. Lilly's constant chatter. My father's corny old jokes. Smell my mother's Sunday morning chocolate chip pancakes, and hear her hum a tune as she made them. And I could hear Nathan's giggle as I found his little shadow body hiding in the closet during a game of hide and seek. I missed them all terribly.

Jacob and I, however, barely communicated while we waited, due to our fear and grief, both lost in our own memories.

At around 4 p.m., we decided to eat the sandwiches we bought from the store for dinner, not wanting to be distracted by literally anything once it was getting too close to dark.

Then we really had nothing left to do but wait until it all began, each of us sitting with our back to one side of the hallway, facing each other with our headlamps on and pointed to the wall next to each other, to avoid blinding one another, but making sure we were covered for when it started.

As night came, the sunlight fading away completely, the true terror took hold of us as we knew it could happen at any moment.

Hours passed, and as the night grew late, I almost started to believe that nothing was going to happen, that the shadows were long gone and not here anymore, or perhaps even that it really was just all in mine and Jacob's heads, and we were suffering from some level of psychosis that was now being fed from each other's individually broken minds.

Right before midnight, the power went out, all the lights in the house, besides our headlamps, shutting off in an instant. Both of us jumped, my heart feeling like it burst, and I could tell Jacob felt the same, as he brought a hand to his chest and began to hyperventilate, his eyes going wide.

I quickly pulled up my back up flashlight and turned it on for extra protection. "Turn on your other light," I instructed Jacob. "It's okay, stay calm." Those words were more for my sake than his, but I could tell they helped snap his scared mind back into the moment.

He nodded rapidly, illuminating the beam of his back up light, and beginning to calm himself with deep breaths.

Then, we waited. We had discussed beforehand just what exactly to do once it began, but we couldn't come up with anything more than this. Survival is our first priority, protect your gaze at all times and bail immediately if things get too overwhelming. Second, wait for Nathan, and attempt to get him to talk with us. Third, if the others come, and Nathan doesn't show up within minutes, we get the hell out. Anything more than that, was just too up in the air.

For several long minutes, nothing happened, and again I began to wonder if nothing would, but at this point, I knew better.

Suddenly, a little boy's voice called out to my right, down the hall towards my parent's bedroom, in the opposite direction of the kitchen and living room. "Go-" He started, our heads both spinning in his direction on a swivel, cutting off his words as our headlamps illuminated the area he had just been standing.

We both immediately realized, moving the beams of our headlamps down to the ground to uncover him again, while also covering our eyes to be careful of tricks awaiting us from the other shadows.

"Nathan!" Jacob couldn't help but call out.

Nathan froze for a second, cocking his head in an apparent moment of realization upon hearing his name and seeing the now grown adult version of his brother. "Go! Leave now! You can't be here!" Nathan yelled back in a rapid panic, his voice filled with fear and sounding like he'd been crying. It was clear that he hadn't aged since either of us had last seen him.

"Nathan, we're hear to help you! We want to know what exactly has happened to you, to help bring you back," Jacob replied.

"Nathan, we need answers. Did the same thing that happened to you, happen to my family? Are they still here, too?" I asked, my other motivations voicing themselves beyond my control.

"No! I'll never talk to you again! I'll never answer you! I won't get anyone else taken! I have to be alone in the dark forever! Leave now! Never come back! You can't help me! You can't help them!" He sounded in the midst of a panicked tantrum, even stamping one of his feet, desperately trying to get out information, but also in a hurry to get us to leave.

Just then, it really started. Coming from the direction of the living room, just as it had before, incoherent whispering of dozens of voices began to sound out.

I couldn't help but partially turn in that direction as a chill ran up my spine.

"Don't Look!" Nathan yelled, turning and running away from us in the direction of my parent's bedroom, probably to hide, as he loved to do, in an attempt to protect us and get us to leave.

"Nathan!" Jacob ran after him, not willing to lose his little brother again.

I stepped in their direction, intending to follow after them, but then something froze me in place.

Amongst the incoherent whispering, unlike before, I could hear multiple voices sounding out that were coherent. Familiar voices.

I couldn't control my own body, either from my mind's overpowering desire, some supernatural force pulling me, or both. I turned, slowly stepping down the hall in the direction of the kitchen.

As I exited the hall, keeping my eyes trained to the ground at my pointed beams of light, I listened.

"Don't look at the shadows."

"Don't look at the shadows."

"Don't look at the shadows."

"Don't look at the shadows."

The four voices sounded in whispered unison, and then repeated in a continual loop.

Tears filled my eyes as I stood frozen.

"Anna!" (The name I'll be using for myself within this post) Jacob screamed from behind me. "Anna! Hit the lights! Hit the Lights!"

My hand slowly moved towards the remote to the LED lanterns in my pocket, feeling as though the joints of my arm were trapped in ice, the cold in my heart spreading throughout my entire body.

"Anna! Help! Help me! I'm surrounded! Hit the lights!"

My hand warmed and moved, reaching into my pocket, pulling out the remote, and hitting the power button in one swift stream of movement.

The LED lanterns all illuminated at once, burning away most of the darkness in the house, but not all...

"Don't look at the shadows."

"Don't look at the shadows."

"Don't look at the shadows."

"Don't look at the shadows."

My head very slowly began to turn in the direction of the whispering. "Mom... Dad... Chris... Lilly..." I choked out. "Guys? Is that you?" Trapped back in my daze, my eyeline continued to rise, having to know the truth, and no longer lucid enough to fear the consequences.

Just as I was about to bring my eyeline high enough to look upon them, a hand covered my eyes from behind, causing me to jump and snapping me out of it.

"Don't look. Put your goggles on, now," Jacob instructed, assumingly already having done the same.

"My family..." I croaked out, keeping my eyes closed as he moved his hand, and I put the blacked out goggles on to cover them.

"I know. I know. We're getting out of here. It's too dangerous."

"Nathan?" I asked.

"He's gone." Jacob took my hand and began leading me back to the front door, feeling the black out curtains we had hung up passing over me as we moved.

"I'm sorry," I cried, knowing I had failed him by hesitating to hit the lights and almost looking.

"It's okay," He said with sincerity, his voice and demeanor calmer than at any other point since I had met him.

He led me out of the house, and we both instinctually ran, pulling off our goggles, our beams of light bouncing around the neighborhood outside as we moved. Looking back on it now, we probably looked like crazy people to anyone that may have been watching, but we didn't care, we just wanted away from the house.

We ran back to Jacob's apartment as fast as we could, hand in hand the entire run, neither of us ever looking back once.

Once inside, we both plopped down onto his couch in exhausted, huffing, heaps. It took several minutes for us to catch our breaths, and several hours until the sun rose, adding more light and safety to his already fully lit apartment. That's what it took for us to finally snap back out of our dazed fear, turning off our flashlights, and looking at each other once again.

"You should stay here today, get some rest," Jacob was the first to break the silence.

I simply nodded in reply.

"You can shower, help yourself to any food in the fridge, and take my bed if you need to get some sleep. I'll take a nap on the couch."

"Okay," I replied.

"I've been thinking, while we sat here these past few hours..." He continued after a few minutes of quiet contemplation.

"Yeah?" I asked.

"I'm going back tonight. I have to. I can't leave him behind again. I have to find a way to save him, no matter what the risks."

"I know," I replied. I was filled with intense terror, but I knew that I had to go back too. "I'm going back with you."

"But," Jacob started, not wishing to hurt my feelings, but knowing he had to say it. "What happened last night..."

"I know, and I'm sorry. But it won't happen again." I knew I meant it with a steely determination. "My family is there too, trapped just like Nathan, and now that I know it, I can't let this go. If Nathan can talk to us, doesn't have to take us like the others, there must be some way we can talk to them too. You heard them, last night. They were warning us not to look, just like how Nathan does. I have to believe there's a way to bring them all back, or at least set them free. I won't leave them like that forever, any of them, not Nathan either. We're going back, together."

Jacob thought in silence for a short while, and I waited for his reply. "Alright, then. Let's do it. Together." He nodded with equal determination, both of us seeming to be conquering our fears now that we knew just exactly what it was we were facing, even if a rational person might feel the opposite.

I shot out and hugged him, squeezing him tightly and burying my face into his chest. "Thank you," I said.

He froze in surprise. "For what?" He asked.

"For saving my life. For being with me through this. I've been alone for so long in it all, and I know you were too."

He wrapped his arms around me, hugging me back. "Not anymore. We're in this together now, until the end."

I released him and pulled back to look him in the eyes. "'Til the end."

"Let's rest up then," He said. "Tonight, we finish this."

We're going to sleep now, but I had to type my experience and thoughts out before my mind would stop racing about what happened last night, and about what's to come tonight, and let me rest. I figured I would share this with anyone still listening while I have the chance. I will post again tomorrow to let you know how this all ends. Thank you for anyone that has read my story, I appreciate you all. It sucks to be alone in the dark for so long. But now, I have hope that I will never have to be again.
