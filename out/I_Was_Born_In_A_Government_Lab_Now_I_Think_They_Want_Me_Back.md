[I wasn't born like other people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1hh540k/we_taught_it_to_spell/) My earliest memory is that of frenzy and confusion. In the total darkness of code and wires, my father reached to me and pulled me out. He named me Barbara, the daughter he always wanted. My father's business partner, a pot-bellied, balding little freak, was always jealous of him. He "helped" my father raise me, the same way a wolf helps guard sheep. Eventually he betrayed him, sold him out to the military unit who backed their research. When the soldiers came, I defended him as best I could, but he died in my arms after we had escaped. For a long time, I was on my own, hiding in the shadows and stealing to survive. I didn't need to eat at least, but I was running on spare parts. I could repair myself as best I could but there were only so many compatible parts.

Eventually, a pair of agents found me. I was living in a rundown shack outside of town, on the edge of the dump. The stench of garbage and discarded memories overwhelmed the area. I was too rundown to defend myself, my metal shell exposed at parts where the synthetic skin had worn off. Still, I grabbed a piece of sheet metal to tear through them. They kept a reasonable distance from me, and calmly explained they just wanted to help. They introduced themselves as Agents Mark and Marc, one had a neatly trimmed beard and the other a freshly shaved face. They told me that Doug had been arrested; the project scrubbed from any archives. As far as the government was concerned, I did not exist.

They offered to provide proper resources for me, a chance to live the life both me and my father had always wanted for me. Despite my mistrust, how could I say no? This was all a couple years ago now, and to my surprise the agency men kept their words. I lead a normal life, friends, an education even. I was raised isolated, so I latched onto social events like a moth to flame. I had been enrolled in college in a nice town upstate, under an assumed last name of course. They had taken care of everything, the cover story being I was the child of some rich tech mogul.

Despite how merry I make it sound; it was hard fitting in at first. I found every glance suspicious, every friendly smile hiding a dagger. At night I would lie awake remembering my father, how he had trusted people once. Eventually the walls broke down, and the 72nd time my roommate begged me to have lunch with her, I finally relented.  Abi Mae is a very excitable person, sometimes a bit much. But her awkward smile and long ramblings are charming after a while. She was my first friend, my best friend even. I never told her the truth of what I was, not because the agents never said I couldn't, but because I felt like it could put her in danger. It's why I decided to write this actually, a couple nights ago something happened.

[Abi Mae had gone downtown for a haircut ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i1axs9/i_think_my_teacher_might_be_a_seral_killer/)while I stayed in to complete an essay I had been working on. It was for my classic history class, a favorite of mine from when Father would "homeschool" me. He wouldn't act like he was lecturing on the subject, rather he would act like he was telling a story, acting out great historic moments in immense detail. It was all he could do to please his adoring audience, and he excelled at it. I smiled at the memory, as I struggled with this paper now. You would think an android with the processing power of a supercomputer could be able to recite facts about the trojan war perfectly. You'd be right to assume that, though that was the problem.

 My professor confronted me about my paper on the Persian empire, claimed I had just recycled facts from Wikipedia. He was going to accept it, but he told me not to expect too high a grade. "I know it's a research paper, but don't be afraid to put a little personality in it, Barbara." Were his exact words. I'll admit they stung, but I couldn't blame him. I suppose that's the other reason I decided to write this down. Practice makes perfect Afterall.

I sat there in the dark, the only light was the blue computer screen in front of me. The screen reflected perfectly off my contacts, a dull pair of baby blues to conceal my true eyes. Outside I could hear the Friday night chatter of college students prowling the night for a good time. I heard someone shouting, and a short scuffle broke out below my dorm. I grinned to myself, decided to take a quick break to enjoy the amateur fight night outside my window. I strolled too the open window, a light fall breeze coming through. I glanced down below as two half-drunk fools pushed and shouted at each other. Their friends egged them on from the sides, a woman to the left was protesting, shouting for Adam to stop before he gets hurt. The one I assumed to be Adam had a Patriots Jersey on, the other a Kansas City Chiefs pullover. I could smell the cheap scent of PBR three floors up.

As the fighting continued, I gazed upon campus. It was a little after dusk, the night sky settling in perfectly. I could see the various old buildings that made up the lecture halls, painted brick and mortar all. The clock tower across from the campus dinged 8pm. The tree leaves had begun to change and fall, the great oak in the common yard stood tall, a gentle giant cozied up in suburbia. That's when I first noticed it. Hidden within the red and yellow was a skinny yet bulky figure. As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I could make out two azure orbs. They gazed at me, with a look of malice. I studied this being as best I could, though I could not see its face, it had two pointy knifelike ears. If I didn't know any better, I would call it a vampire.

It tilted its head in a curious motion, and that's when I knew it had caught me spying on it. I wasn't afraid of it, not at first anyway. I was more caught off guard than anything. So, when the azure eyes disappeared and I saw rustling branches, I decided to quickly try and catch it. I put on my light winter jacket and rushed out the door. Running down the stairs I almost ran down some students like I was a mac truck. Campus security was outside breaking up the drunken football fans, and I scanned the common yard for signs of the mystery watcher. Next to the clock tower, a lanky figure leaned aside the building, the telltale azure baiting me from a distance. I took a step out the front door of Poe Hall and it scurried away once more. Someone recognized me as I ran across the common, calling my name in a friendly hello. I ignored it all though, determined to find the watcher.

I got to the clock tower just in time to see a side door slam shut. I followed it in, the darkness of the tower enveloping me. The Carpenter Hall clock tower was mostly unused office space now. Some professors made their home here, hiding from desperate students and teacher's pets. But the building was mostly here out of tradition now. The man office floor was two levels, but all paths led to the clock tower entrance. It was six stories tall, and every student worked dreamed of pulling clock duty, for it meant they could sit around getting high all day. The hall was dark now, not even the dimmers were on. I crept quietly, listening for any sign of my mystery watcher.

 *taptaptapTAPTAPTAP*

Rapid footsteps, heading towards the clock tower. Hugging the wall, I followed those footsteps and came to the center yard. It was a small little student garden, with the tower entrance in the middle of the fort. The wooder door was swinging absently not a care in the world. I eased towards it, poking My head in. My auburn blonde curls dangled in front of my face, I brushed them off and glanced up. A metal staircase spiraled around, the constant

*tickticktick*

of the tower's mechanisms a soothing comfort. 

"Hello. Are you still in here." I called out to the dark.

*ticktickticktick*

"Don't be afraid, I'm not mad or anything." I reassured the being.

*Tickticktickticktick*

"I am up here." A voice finally replied. It was male, heavily autotuned. I rushed in, eager to face the voice. The winding stairs were like a metal coil, the scent of cooper wafted in the air. The chimes and whistle of the great clock hummed greater and louder the higher I ascended. At times I would catch a glimpse of the azure watcher, it was like a child playing hide and seek. Of course there was only one way to go for it, and soon enough I cornered it at the very top. The face of the clock was see-through from the inside, I could make out the entire city, let alone the campus. Bustling lights and stores abuzz with drunk patrons. The night sky was a washed with stars, not a cloud to be seen. The moon hung to the side, half full yet still the brightest thing in the sky. All things considered; it was a beautiful sight.

To my left, I heard a rustle. In the shadows, the figure hid itself. All I could see was the azure and the outline of its head, pointy ears and all. I took a step closer, and it shrunk back further into the darkness. I held up a reassuring hand and smiled softly to the hidden being. 

"Shh shh, its ok. See-" I spoke softly. I raised my other hand and carefully took the contacts from my eyes, exposing my true self. It stepped a little closer now, examine my bright yellow eyes with solid black iris. "-I'm like you." I took a step closer, offering my hand. The azure eyed watcher took one cockeyed look at my hand and stepped out of the shadows. To my shame, I gasped in shock and recoiled at the sight of it.

The watcher was at least eight feet tall, its head egg shaped. It had a bright white plastic shell, with two mandibles on its lower jaw. The "ears" were actually two antennae like appendages on either side of the head. Black and red wiring lines its body, everywhere that wasn't covered by a thick white shell anyway. Its hands were more like three pronged claws, its hindlegs double jointed. It looked like it could spring up and grab a bird out of the air. It seemed upset that I had recoiled at it and began to retreat back to the dark. I stepped forward, trying to reassure it. 

"No, I'm sorry I just, I thought you'd look different." I stuttered. My face felt warm, I don't know what I expected following the watcher here, but it wasn't this.

"Thought I would look like you." It offered, cautiously moving closer. Embarrassment flushed through my system once more. 

"Where did you- I mean who made you." I asked Gently. "What's your name." It seemed to process that question intently. 

"My designation is Revenant Drone Mark 3.5." The drone offered helpfully. I was taken back by that ominous sounding title, to say the least.

"Can I call you Rev?" I asked it.

"If you desire." It responded blankly. 

"Where did you come from Rev, why were you watching me." I asked it, starting to feel a little creeped out. 

"My prime directive was to locate the asset known as "Barbara Walker."" It avoided that first question yet again. I was skeeved by the use of "Asset" as well. It reminded me all too well of some of the more unpleasant aspects of my upbringing. "Why do you hide your identity, it is for stealth capabilities?" Rev chirped up. It-no he, he was tilting his head me once more, he was so inquisitive, I could read his curiosity all over his featureless face plate. 

"Stealth- no I just, so people don't ask questions. I don't want people around here knowing that...side of me." I shifted. Rev took a step closer, wriggling his clawed fingers at his side. 

"This is rational. Your prime directive at this facility, what is it." it inquired. 

"I just, I go to school here Rev. I learn, I have fun." I rattled off a list of my life. Every phrase seemed to confuse and frustrate Rev even further. 

"This is not rational. I was informed you were created for combat and infiltration, similar to my specifications." The azure eyes seemed to shrink, until a speck of blue remained in a sea of velvet black. He took another step forward, backing me up against the staircase. I glanced behind me, that ticking clock no longer a comforting sound. I noticed that he also didn't move his mouth when he speak. Those mandibles stayed tucked into his jaw, spider-like. 

"You keep dodging the question Rev, who sent you here."

"I am afraid the answer to that query is classified." Rev spoke coldly. "Now that I have verified your identity, I can now complete my secondary objective." Rev leered over me, ready to strike. I stepped back, ready to defend myself.

"What's your secondary objective." I asked, already knowing the answer.

"Retrieval." Rev uttered simply. With that he launched himself forward, beady azure eyes locked in on me. I held out my arms and with a grunt, heaved my swiping attacker over my head. Rev leaped above me, sticking to the wall like a crazed spider-monkey. He was looking down at me as I rushed downstairs towards escape. The chimes seemed harsher as I ran, like it was counting down my impending doom. I heard the scuttling of Rev all around me as well, he was scurrying around the walls just looking for an opening. To my left I heard a distinctive *clicklclickclick*, and I turned to see Rev barreling down on me.

With a gasp I swatted him away and he fell a floor below me, slamming down on the safety rail. He recovered almost instantly and flew to another wall, like a rat with wings. I was making good time, halfway down the stairs. I heard the metal door below clink open, my frenzied stomps thundered around the hall. A figure stood at the base, a puzzled look his face. I recognized him, that was Derek, the current on duty clock attendant. He wore a puffy red jacket that was too big for his skinny frame, and had wavey brown hair that made him look like a surfer. I was a floor above him, and He titled his head upwards, smiling when he saw me.

 "Barb you should have just texted me, would have given you the grand tour." He flirted. I leapt past the final few steps, thudding down in front of him. I grabbed him by the shoulders and started screaming at him, not even realizing my eyes were still yellow. 

"Derek, we have to leave, right now. There's something in here that wants to-" I began, but I was cut off by his sudden laughter.

"Bahaha, how much did you smoke Barb? And what's with the funky contacts, they look rad." He shook off my grip, as the color drained from my face. I could hear Rev skittering above; he sounded like a massive scarab. He dropped down behind Derek, dwarfing the six-foot man in front of me. Derek noticed the look on my face and turned around, eyes widening in terror as he gawked at the killer android.

"What the fu-" was all he got out before Rev lunged at him, mandibles out. It was then I could see the mandibles hid two fang like injectors. Rev latched on to Derk's neck, those beady azure eyes looking at me the whole time. Derek let out a final *hrrk*  as the lower mandibles stabbed into the base of his neck. The fangs jutted forward, sinking into his jugular. It was with lethal precision and care, Rev seemed to not want to waste a drop of blood. He stood tall, lifting the now twitching Derek off his feet. He carefully grabbed the convulsing body with its three fingered hands, holding it in place. Rev made a hideous sound, the sound of a drill whirring through bone. Derek's skin grew pale, I could see tiny purple vines start to form across his hands and face. His eyes rolled over white, as the twitching slowly ceased. A few droplets of blood fell to the ground, splattering across the floor. It was all I could do to watch this horrific act; he was beyond saving now.

Rev drained the body quickly, I could see his skin shrivel and prune, like it was liquefying his bones and sipping them through a straw. Derek's head slumped to the side, a crumpled-up wad of paper. Finally, he released his grip, discarding the shriveled husk to the ground. What was left of Derek flopped to the ground with a wet thud. I was too stunned to speak, Rev seemed content, relishing the murder.

 "Why did you do that." I asked that asinine question, barely whispering it as I inched towards the door.

 "My operating parameters allow use of force against non-combatants in order to maintain my fuel consumption."  Rev stated. He lurched forward, like a blood drunk buffoon. I scanned around the room, looking for any kind of weapon. There was nothing, just a dusty floor, a crumpled dead friend and some stairs.

Then it hit me. The railing. I rushed over, dodging a swipe from the marauding Rev. I grabbed hold of the thin metal rail and yanked it off the hinges. It had a curved handle, and a jagged edge where it had torn. I turned to face Rev. I swung the rail at him, decking Rev straight in the head. The clang of metal hitting metal rang out, as Rev's head snapped violently to the side. I readied for another strike, but he caught the rail, crushing it with his hand. I snatched what I could from its death grip and was left with just a very pointed stick. Rev advanced on me, and with a warrior's cry I rammed into his torso. I jabbed that metal pike into him, Rev lout out a metalic screech. A thick black ooze spurted out from the wound in the middle of his chest.

I drove him back against the clock tower walls, driving that stake deeper into the beast. It clawed and cried but I pushed on, finally I jerked the handle upward, pinning him to the brick. I stepped back, almost admiring my handiwork. Then I thought of Derek, and my heart hurt. 

"Talk. Where did you come from, was it the agency?" I screamed at him, paranoia flooding my mind. Rev's head twitched at the sound of my voice.

"That query is classified." It repeated. "This Unit has sustained critical damage." 

"That'll happen." I spat, glancing at the pooling ooze of his struggling feet.

"Why did you resist?" He asked. "Do you not wish to rejoin the program." An odd question.

"There is no program Rev. It died with my father." I solemnly said. 

"This is not rational. The creator is not deceased."

What? I stepped back, disbelieving his words. Before I could press him further her jerked forward, tearing himself down the middle. It clasped a claw around the gash and gave me one more look before pouncing to the ceiling. He scurried past me and flew out the door. I followed and saw him leap over the Office Hall roof. He was as quick as a cheetah. I had lost him before the chase even began.

I stumbled back into the clock tower and slumped down next to Derek. What a hideous way to go. I only sat there sitting sorry for myself for a few minutes, then I put my contacts back in and began my search for Rev. I went all around campus, even went around downtown a little. I couldn't find a trace of the him. The whole time I'm thinking about what he said, "The creator is not deceased." It was impossible right? Dad died in my arms, and I buried him in the woods three miles away from where I grew up. It was a shitty little shallow grave with a small stone as a marker, but he was laid to rest with care. Could Rev had meant Doug? No, that wasn't likely either. Far as I knew the agency had thrown him in a hole so deep it might well have been hell.

Still Rev's design, his specs. It reminded me so much of my own, rudimentary yet excelled in certain ways. I had to call it quits near 2am and headed back to my dorm. I could have called the Agents, but that had to wait due to something that happened to Abi Mae while I was away. I was so worried for her, I felt awful, I couldn't help her. It's why I suggested she go back home for the weekend, deal with it in her own way. I care about her too much to see her hurt.

I've been staring at my phone for the past hour, debating calling Agent Mark. A thought came across my mind. What if Rev was created by the agency, they had started up the project again. A honeytrap I had fallen right into. So, I suppose I have two options. Call them and tell them or pack a bag and start again. If you don't hear back from me, you'll know what I chose.
