There’s a certain hopelessness that comes with being [watched.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/126t104/i_let_a_stranger_take_a_picture_of_my_family_now/) You just want to take off your skin for a little while. Maybe crawl inside a hole or fuck off behind the couch all day. Kind of hard to do that in the digital age. Anyone can access your location at almost any time. All it takes is a simple search. Even the refrigerators have cameras.

A stranger in the woods took a picture of me in my home. 

I had a lot of trouble wrapping my mind around that fact. The same place where my kids slept. The same place we hoped to grow as a family. Nothing felt safe anymore. The television could be bugged. The lights could be hacked. Every online article about twenty-first century surveillance spawned little red ants that moved back and forth beneath my skin. 

The police arrived early in the morning. Emma made french toast and bacon. Two officers looked around the property for about an hour. They spent a good amount of time on the porch and the steps leading up to it. I hoped for the best. But nothing unusual turned up. 

They asked if we had any enemies. I explained the encounter at the beach. I focused on the man taking my phone for the picture and the woman bringing it up the prior night. I thought maybe they were working together. I told them we couldn’t stay at the house anymore. I didn’t think it would be safe. I must have rambled.

The officers sipped their coffee. They nodded patiently. They thanked me for the information. They thanked Em for breakfast. 

Then they left.

“We’ll file a report. Let us know if anything changes.” 

I don’t know what I expected. Maybe a dozen squad cars and a personal chopper to escort my family to safety. But there wasn’t any damage. No names to blame. No tips or data to trace. We had a creepy picture and an odd late night visit. That was it. Not a whole lot to go on. 

I booked a hotel. 

We spent the day at the mall. The shops kept the kids busy while I sat in line at the store to figure out a way to secure my phone. I had this growing suspicion of the strange people around me. Everyone from the middle-aged guy at the counter to the thin woman eyeing bedazzled cases seemed suspicious. 

The customer service rep called my name and my stomach dropped. I caught my breath. I got up and took a minute to explain the situation once again. I emphasized the fact that these weirdos found my house. The young guy’s eyes grew wide at the details. But he didn’t seem altogether phased.

“These days,” he opined. “Everyone can change their number. Forget burners. You don’t even need a new phone anymore. There are apps that will do it for you. You might be able to block the server or block the number that’s calling but who’s to stop them from trying another one? And another? And around and around we go. This is how you still get spam calls.”

Tell me about it.

“So what do we do?”

He grabbed my phone and looked over the two messages in question. He typed the phone numbers into his computer. He stared at it for a minute. He looked around for help. Then he mumbled.

“They’re actually real numbers.”

I got excited.

“But they’re not connected to anything,” he frowned. “Weird. So maybe not real in that sense.”

I deflated.

“What does that mean?”

“Well, the phones aren’t sold by us. So we can’t see everything. I can only see the provider right now and it’s not one that sounds familiar to me.”

He showed it to me. 

“WVC. Never seen that before. Mean anything to you?”

I shook my head. He scrolled a little more. It was clear we were at another impasse.

“Maybe try finding the carrier,” he hesitated. “Also... have you ever heard of AirTags?”

I shook my head again.

“Little white GPS trackers. Portable. People use them for finding their keys and stuff. Now, the ones that are made by the big companies are pretty obsessive about privacy. You’ll get notifications on your phone if anybody is trying to follow your movement. But the off-brand types? Private investigator shit? Somebody with a little more knowledge can very easily buy one of these things online, stick it under your bumper, and use the data for nefarious purposes.”

“Great.”

“So check your car.”

“Done.”

He typed a few more things on the computer. He power cycled the phone. Then he handed it back to me.

“Okay. You’ll want to do the same thing to your wife’s phone, or it won’t work. The change on your end should be immediate. Hopefully this little roundabout will throw them off. Call us if anything changes. We can work with the police as well, once there’s an active investigation, let us know.”

I thanked the guy. I headed out into the crowd of the general atrium. I was exhausted. There was a table by the vendors with some comfortable reclining chairs attached. I grabbed a seat and let the prior day’s struggles fall into the faux leather handles. 

I might have dozed for a little while. 

The din of crowds and conversation converged to form an odd sort of lullaby.

I opened my eyes to the screech of a child crying for a toy. The traffic seemed to have died down by that point. Afternoon shade dipped in through the painted glass. I got up and looked around. That's when I saw him. Black slacks, white shirt, gray golf cap. 

Elderly. 

I darted across the cafeteria like a psychopath. I knocked over a safety cone. I bumped into a kid. I didn’t give a shit. This asshole was going to pay. I lost control of myself and grabbed him by the shoulder right in front of a security guard. I regretted it almost immediately.

“Hey!”

I raised my fist. The man turned around. I gasped. They looked absolutely nothing alike.

“Shit.”

“What’s your problem?”

“I’m sorry.”

“You should be.”

“I thought you were someone else.” 

I backed away. The man brushed off his jacket. We both nodded at the guard. I apologized again. I turned around to get my bearings and found my entire family staring back at me.

“Real nice.”

We left the mall together out of embarrassment.

“You have to calm down,” Emma chided. “Seriously. You’re scaring the kids.”

The walk back to the car was awkward. She was right. I never wanted to be the type of parent (or person) who lost his temper in public. Joey didn’t seem to care but Sofia wouldn’t look at me. I tried to cheer her up with dad jokes and promises to play with all the cool stuff at the hotel. But she wouldn’t budge. The poor kid just wanted to go home. I kept telling her we couldn’t. 

I was distracted. 

Otherwise, I would have noticed the girl walking behind us the whole way back.

“Excuse me,” she shouted. “Do you have time for a picture?”

I ushered the kids to the car. Emma got inside with them. I could hear the click-clack of heels gaining speed while we fumbled with the seat belts. I shut the door, set the lock, and turned around to a wide-eyed teenager smiling back at me.

“They say a thousand words, don’t ya think?”

I screamed at her. I couldn’t help it.

“What the fuck do you want?”

A concerned couple stopped at the sound of my voice. A few more onlookers joined them. I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t fight back. I couldn’t hit her. I couldn’t even raise my voice. She knew it. 

“A picture,” she giggled. “Just a picture! That’s all. Why do you have to be so uptight about it?”

“We don’t want you to take our picture.”

“Okay!”

She had a certain giddiness about her that’s hard to describe. Do you know the type? She was just as pretty as the last one. Brown hair. Tanned skin. Flowing dress. But she did not stop looking me in the eyes. Crazy eyes, as my friends might have called it, or a thousand-yard stare.

“But we’re going to do it anyway.”

I got inside the car and slammed the door. The kids cried in the back. Emma scrambled to calm them down. I backed out of the spot and nearly hit the creepy hippie along the way. She was still smiling. I hated that smile. Like she knew something we didn’t.

“What is going on?!”

I hit the gas hard. We peeled out of the parking lot. My wife turned on some music. Down by the Bay became the soundtrack to my complete and total mental breakdown. 

“Did you hear that? Three people now. Three. They all know about the picture. They all want more. Who are they? Why are they doing this?”

“Calm down.”

“How can we calm down? What do we do? Where do we go?”

“Go to the hotel. Or no. I don’t know. Just drive.”

I turned onto the highway. Traffic spilled out into the intersections. I found a back road that led to a quiet route by the water. Emma called the police along the way. I pulled over at a gas station and checked for trackers. There weren’t any.

“The officer in charge will get back to us soon.”

We didn’t really have a plan. We didn’t feel safe at the hotel. We didn’t feel safe at the house. So we got back in the car and drove north. We kept driving until the road signs became unfamiliar. Then we kept driving some more. The sun slipped down and the kids fell asleep to the steady motion of the bumps in the road and Raffi’s greatest hits. 

“Do you think they’ll stop now?” Emma whispered at one point. “It’s probably just a stupid prank, if the police pressure them, maybe they’ll back off…”

“I don’t know. I hope so.”

She nodded and reclined her seat. I thought she drifted to sleep. But soon after that talk, her voice startled me. 

“Do you see that black truck behind us?”

I actually did see it. They had been with us for miles. Most traffic turned right at the parkway entrance, but this guy stayed straight, about three lengths behind. I just didn’t know what to do about him yet. 

“Turn.”

I sped up and dove into a neighborhood. The truck flew past. I came back out to enter the highway. 

The truck was waiting.

"Shit."

“Call the police again.”

I hit the gas. The truck followed. I changed lanes. The truck followed. The next few seconds happened sort of fast and slow at the same time. They pulled up beside us. I tried to avoid them. I saw a face in a mask in the passenger seat and then a quick flash.

“Matt!”

They rammed us. 

Gravity suspended.

The car flipped three times with my family inside. 

And even through all of the blood, chaos, and screaming... 

I could still see them taking pictures before the ambulances arrived.
