Due to the recent news about the UFO hearing I have decided to give my own testimony and to tell you, the government is still hiding the true truth from us. I have no idea why they chose to visit earth, I have no idea where they come from, and no, we haven't found any that are alive. I work for a branch of the US government that specializes in extraterrestrials and I am needed for the stuff from space. I handle all signals, transmission and spikes in radiation that come from outer space. Almost all of my job is sitting around waiting for the next 5 months for a 2 second transmission that is just static. Some of the other jobs around the facility includes; sending signals into space, taking pictures of space, taking pictures of deep space, and investigating Extraterrestrial corpses. One day while I was sitting around one of my colleagues, John, made a sound that was like a mix between confusion and anger.  
“Alright, who fucked with my computer?”  
The question was posed in an accusatory tone. Everyone in the adjacent area all looked at each other as if to see if someone was lying because of their face, but as far as I could see, the 5 other people in this room were fine.  
	  
“All my equipment is screwy, a vast portion of stars are missing from the sky. Did one of you put a smudge on my equipment?” he asked  
“None of us did anything to your station. We've all been here all night.” said Jamie after what felt like an eternity.  
He was right, none of us had moved from our stations since we clocked in. But when we went over to check it out, he was right, there was a black spot where the lights of stars should be. I suggested that it was a smudge on the telescope but he said that it would have color and not just a black spot, we suggested a mechanical issue but that wasn’t plausible. Every explanation we gave out was shot down. We just reported it to the higher ups and left it at that, the next day it was even bigger, and I started receiving small signals. I didn’t think too much of it at the time but looking back, I should have listened.  
	  
On the third day I received a message, an actual, verbal message, it was translated to the following words: Stop sending signals, it can hear you. Just those words sent chills down my spine. By this point the black spot on John’s station took up most of the screen. We have had stars disappear from the system, and we just chalked it up to a burnout, i mean, there's so many stars in the sky that one or two burning out every once and a while shouldn’t be uncommon. But a whole patch of hundreds of stars, that should be possible, as my father always corrected me; possible but not probable. We sat there like a bunch of morons staring at John's screen and watched as another disappeared.   
	  
We didn’t know what to say when I got the notification that I had another signal, I sat down and translated it, what it said still haunts me in my last moments  
“You didn’t take my warning, it has found you, find a way off the planet”  
A second message soon followed it up not seconds later  
“This will be our final message, for if you are not dead we can’t send anything else for fear of killing ourselves.”  
We sat there and just stared at the message, we now knew what that black spot on John’s station is, and we fear that we are too late. We have no way to get off the planet and live for long enough to get to the closest planet away, which is light-years away. Even if the people live long enough to make it to the planet there's a chance it was destroyed years ago by whatever is coming for Earth. This was a few days ago, the black spot has grown in size and has now started to take form, whatever it is, when I look at it I feel like I want to throw up.  
I quit working there today and now I'm just sitting at home, waiting to die, and the government is working on sending Earth's best chance into space, in the opposite direction of this thing and I have no clue how long we have left. But however long is left, use it wisely because it isn’t getting any further away.
