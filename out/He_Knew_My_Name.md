I still see him everywhere I go. That sick fucking smile.



We had been searching for a missing kid for a couple of days. 

We all knew how these things ended up. Either he was found before dinner, or hands and feet started washing up on the bank. 



Hikers phoned in. They saw the kid on the north side of the river, stumbling and panicked, running from something.

They said he’d been screaming for Mom. 



I was on nights and lumped into the search party since nothing crazy happens in this town. A couple of domestics, home invasions, and bar fights are usually what I have to attend to, so a search party didn’t seem too bad. Plus, on nights lunch was covered. 



I took my squad car out on the dirt roads behind the Jackson’s farm, the only man-made paths leading into the forest. 

I thought that, for once in this town, I could have a quiet night, free from all the broken glass and crying kids. Free from cars getting broken into. Free from the chairs being thrown at the pub. 

Looking back, I would've done anything to get those calls that night.



I set out on foot and got pretty far out onto the riverbank, sweeping the area with my flashlight. All I found was trash. Beer cans. Crumpled cigarette packs. Nothing that screamed ‘missing kid.’



I was making my way back to my squad car when it hit me. 



Something was wrong.

I could smell it in the air.

In the way the trees were swaying.

I jumped out of my skin when I heard twigs snapping and leaves rustling directly to my left.

That’s when I saw him.

A man, crouched over in the bushes, staring at me through his long, knotted, greasy hair.

The sick fuck was smiling.

He was barefoot. Thin. Wearing nothing but a dirty hospital gown.

The kind they give you when you’re not supposed to go anywhere.

I wish I could tell you I did something different, I really do.

I froze, and couldn’t get any words out of my mouth. 

That damn smile still on his face. 

My hands snapped down to my pistol in an instant, fumbling with the clasp of the holster.

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get my pistol out.

The man, watching me fuck with my holster, stood there in silence. His grin spreading further and further up his face.

Like he was inviting me to finally get it right.

He lifted one hand, slow, deliberate, and pointed right at my holster.

His voice was low, almost patient, like he had all the time in the world.

“It’s not hard, brandon,” he said. “Both buttons. Together.”

He knew my name.

I did what he said.

My hands shook so badly that I could barely feel the buttons under my fingers.

I pressed them both.

Heard the click.

The gun finally came free.

But I never pointed it at him. I didn’t even say anything. I watched as he climbed out of the bush and came up to me, inches from me. 

His smile never gave up. 

Then he leaned in for a whisper, close enough to feel his breath against my cheek.

“You’ll never find him,” he said.

Calm.

Certain.

Like it wasn’t even a question.

He didn’t touch me.

He didn’t even look at me again.

He just turned, slow as anything, and started walking back into the trees. 

I didn’t call for any backup. 

I didn’t chase after him. 

I stood there frozen in fear like a little boy.

I found my path back to my truck and started it. And drove away.

I didn’t stop.

Not until the trees were gone and the sun was bleeding up over the fields.

Not until the woods, and everything inside them, were somewhere I could pretend didn’t exist.

It’s been months now.

I’ve moved two towns over, switched precincts, and finally bought a house with my fiancée. 

Sometimes, on good days, my life feels normal again. I’ll go fishing with the boys, or help my fiancée in our garden.

But in those moments, I’ll see him.

Submerged in the water, smiling at me, or crouching behind the rose bushes. Every time with that same fucking smile. 

He disappears when I blink.

And I’ll never find him.
