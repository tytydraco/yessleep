It started with a bar of chocolate.

"You didn't eat it?" Sara asked when I told her about it.

"No! I opened the parcel because it had my name on it but it clearly isn't actually meant for me."

Sara sighed.

"If Amazon haven't emailed you saying you need to return it then I don't get what the big deal is, it's not l-"

"It isn't from Amazon, the address is handwritten. So I'm not eating it, it'd be weird."

The phone went silent for a moment.

"Okay, that *does* sound weird. You don't recognise the handwriting?"

"Nope."

"Secret admirer?" Sara suggested with a hint of mischief in her voice.

I groaned.

"I don't want an admirer. I don't even want the chocolate, not when it's been sent by some mysterious stranger."

"Send it to me, I'll take it!"

"No."

That should have been the end of it, but I wouldn't be writing this if it was.



When I received the second delivery I recognised the handwriting instantly. Inside there was a voucher for two games of bowling. There was no note. Whilst the chocolate had been a flavour that I enjoyed the bowling voucher was less personal, at least. I hadn't been bowling since I was a child so if... wait. For the first time I registered which alley this voucher was for. It offered me two free games at my local alley which wasn't even part of a chain. Whoever had sent this to me either knew that I lived close to the bowling alley this voucher was from or lived locally himself. Maybe even both.

"If this is a prank I don't like it." I said when I called Sara.

"I wouldn't." Sara insisted. "This is actually sort of creepy. Did you talk about chocolate and bowling at work maybe?"

"No."

"Right."

"Nobody at work even knows my address anyway. We talk on social media sometimes but they've never come to visit or anything."

There was a pause and I could hear tapping from the speaker of my phone, the gentle yet repetitive sound of Sara poking her phone's screen.

"Are you seriously scrolling on your phone whilst we're having this conversation?!"

I didn't like the sound of my voice as it left me, a shrill demanding cry. Still, I felt my concerns were serious enough that Sara should be paying more attention than casually multitasking.

"It's not like that." she said quietly, "I was seeing if I could find your address."

"But... you know my address."

"Yes. But if I didn't, I think I might still be able to work it out from some of your posts. You took a photo of the skyline and said it was from your window, you have a post you tagged with 'support your local library,' things like that. I don't think *I* could work out how to find you from this but only because I don't know what I'm doing. I've read stories about people who've tracked exes down from photos where there's a letterhead with their address on that they hadn't realised was there and there are people online playing games where they can track a location from a photo of a park bench or whatever. This could be somebody from your work."

I tried to think of any of my coworkers who might like me or dislike me enough to do this.

"In fact," Sara continued, "it could be anyone at all. You still have a Facebook page and your name's pretty unique. Is it even private? I don't know how to tell..."

"It isn't. It will be."

"I'm sure it's nothing." she said.

Sara has never been a good liar and the slight waver in her voice betrayed the fact that she was now almost as worried as I was. I ended the call and threw the voucher away.



If I'd been unsure whether or not the gifts I'd been receiving were well meaning or creepy the next parcel more than made up for it. It was larger and heavier than anything that I'd received so far and really I shouldn't have opened it but I did. The cardboard box held a small cool box inside like you might use if you wanted to bring some pasta salad with you on a summer's hike. I pulled off the lid with increasing dread and found myself looking at long, sandy blonde hair. 

I wasn't scared at first. The gentle curls sat there waiting for a reaction and I felt nothing at all. In a trance like state I lifted the hair out of the box as if getting a closer look would make all of the pieces fall into place and the hair came up as one connected mass.

It was then that I noticed the pieces of scalp holding the hair together and I screamed so loud and so long that my next door neighbour forced the door open to reach me.

"Are you hurt?" he asked in an authorative yell.

I couldn't answer and only succeeded in bringing my screams down to a gibbering, sobbing mess of chaos. I'd thrown the hair away from me when I'd noticed the skin attached to it and I pointed at it. He picked it up just as I had and recoiled when he realised what he was holding.

"What the shit..." he muttered.



The police were called. I think that they were reasonably thorough but I don't know what steps they're meant to take when someone gets a scalp delivered to their home. They took fingerprints and DNA from both me and the neighbour who'd stormed in to help me. He didn't look pleased with the interaction but he complied. I was advised to stay somewhere else if possible and to get cameras.

"I broke the lock on your door when I came in," my neighbour admitted, "do you want me to install a new one?"

I shook my head. I'd never had to attach a lock to a door before and my neighbour had given me no reason to distrust him but whoever was sending these parcels was dangerous and right now anybody could be a suspect.

"I'm sorry. I thought you were in trouble." he said.

He did ask if I wanted him to stay with me but I'd feel no safer with this stranger whose name was either Mick or Mike and occasionally played death metal loud enough that I could hear it through the walls than I would alone. He left and closed the useless door behind him.

Staying where I was tonight seemed unwise. Ideally I'd stay with a friend but Sara was my closest friend and she lived a two hour flight from where I was. Even at that point I didn't want to reach out to my parents. I didn't want to upset them, partly for their sake but partly for my own. I'd been to years of therapy but neither of them had really dealt with what had happened when I was younger and instead developed an excessive fear that something truly terrible could befall on any one of us at any moment. They fed into each other's paranoia and I was terrified that if I told them what was going on then they'd suck me in and I'd finally become so fragile and broken that I couldn't be fixed.

I bought cameras and locks and spent the evening making my home as safe as it could be. I didn't sleep that night and kept a kitchen knife near to me at all times.



The next parcel was small. I wasn't supposed to open it and if it had arrived sooner then I wouldn't have. But I'd been trying to get the police to tell me anything about the investigation into the scalp I'd received and they weren't telling me anything. Some crazy part of me thought that this parcel could have a clue and I'd be able to solve the mystery myself.

There was nothing particularly disturbing in this box but a child's toy. Specifically it was a Polly Pocket set; not the newer ones that I think are still made today but a mermaid themed set that was new when I was a kid. This wasn't the brilliant lead I'd hoped for but it wasn't nothing either. An hour of internet searches told me that this set hadn't been in production for a long time and barely anybody was selling this particular set online. Only one of the sellers wasn't overseas and so I decided to start there, sending a long and emotional email explaining that if they recently sold a Polly Pocket Mermaid Sleepover set then I desparately needed details of who they sold it to. I attached photos of the scuff marks near the clasp and the chipped paint on 'Polly's dress in the hope that it would verify that I was telling the truth.



Two days later I'd received no word from the toy seller but my dad called. Grandma had been in some sort of accident and as she didn't live near to me and my parents, they were both travelling out to help look after her. I knew that my mystery stalker was behind that too somehow but I couldn't prove it so I said nothing.

  
Finally there was something close to good news. I received an email from the online toyseller telling me that she had sold the set in the pictures recently. I didn't recognise the name that she gave me but she also gave me his email and his address. I had his actual address. A sane person would have called the police but they still hadn't said a damned thing about the scalp and this bastard was fucking with my family. A quick google told me that the address was only a ten minute drive away and I grabbed the kitchen knife that I'd taken to sleeping next to and headed to the place where my stalker apparently lived.

  
Once I arrived at his door I realised that I wasn't sure what to do next. I knocked and regretted it immediately. When nobody responded I should have left but I needed answers. An attempt to shoulder barge the door open resulted in nothing but a dull pain that radiated all the way down to my wrist but there were rocks nearby in someone else's garden and I threw one at the window. It didn't break straight away but I threw another and then removed my jacket and broke away enough of the shards that I could climb inside.

The house barely looked lived in. There was furniture but no photos, no ornaments, no TV. There was nothing beyond the bare essentials in various muted tones until I reached the study and there on a cheap pine desk lay a diary.

I didn't remember writing a diary before today but as soon as I saw the bright aqua notebook adorned with its many stickers I knew it was mine from childhood. It was only a small book and yet was still barely two thirds full so perhaps I'd forgotten about writing in it because I hadn't kept a diary for very long. The only other thing on the desk was a red biro and I flicked through the first few pages until I saw a phrase that been underlined in red and then checked off with a large, passionate swoosh.

It was an entry in which I'd mentioned wanting a bar of the chocolate that my stalker had ended up sending to me. A few pages later there was more red ink, this time marking my displeasure at being too ill to go to another kid's party at the bowling alley. I flicked through a more pages and found a jealous whine about how I wanted hair 'just like Stacy's.' The vague memory that I had of the child I'd written about had had the same colour of hair that I'd been sent with pieces of her stuck to it.

The next entry that had been marked made no sense at first, a rant about how I wished that mean girl in my class would 'just shut up.' It wasn't someone I'd spoken to in school and with a sense of dread I wondered what'd been done to her. I didn't even have any way to find out. My parents came under fire next with an entry saying that I wished that they'd just give me some space. And so he'd created a reason that they'd have to move away for a while.

We were nearly at the end of my entries now and I turned to the last page. The script here was different. It was still my handwriting but it was rougher and almost stabbed into the page. I remembered why I'd stopped keeping a diary.

A noise outside startled me back into the present and I left the house from the same window I entered. I've no doubt that someone saw me as I drove away but it's the least of my issues now. I'm writing this from a cafe, too scared to go back home but too stupid to think of any other plan. Because it turns out that the day that I wrote the final entry of my diary was the day that James died. 

The last sentence I wrote says 'All I want is my brother back.'

And it's been checked off with one final red [swoosh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leavesandink/).
