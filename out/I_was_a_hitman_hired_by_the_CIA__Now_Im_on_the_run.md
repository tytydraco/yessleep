I’m writing this now not for me but for everyone out there, even one guy who will read this as proof that I exist… I was real… I am writing this as I have nothing to lose but I never had anything to gain. They will reach me soon enough I know, but I need someone to know this.. Anyone.

I was born on the streets. My dad was an alcoholic. I vaguely remember his scrawny beard and curly hair, his ugly features before he was beaten to death when he tried to assault a girl in his state of heavy intoxication. As for my mom she sold me to human traffickers for substance but little did she know I was brought by the C.I.A. 



I have little to no memory of my parents. I was sold when I was about six. I do not feel anything about them, no hatred, no anger , no happiness, no remorse. I was raised in a facility,training and eating there. I was grateful to have a roof over my head and enjoyed the physical drills I was put to. By the time I was 17 , I had learnt to break every 206 bones in the human body in a different way from the other and learnt innumerable ways to kill someone. I was a ghost. No past relationships from the outside world, no records or traces. I was C.I.A.’s most useful, deadly and lethal hitman. The one who could appear and disappear at will.

I never expected to make it past forty. I always assumed I’d meet my end in some nameless alley, a bullet lodged in my skull before I hit the pavement. That’s the life of a ghost. You live in the shadows, you die in the shadows. No names, no records, no past. Just a body count that never sees the light of day.

It started with an assignment that felt... wrong. Not that any of them ever felt right, but this one was different. I wasn’t ordered to eliminate a high-value target or a foreign operative. I wasn’t even hunting down a rogue agent. No, this time, I stumbled upon something I was never meant to see—something buried so deep in the black budget projects that even the people funding it didn’t know the full extent of what they were paying for.

What I was asked to recover wasn’t some elaborate joke, or something political, No, the things I have seen are sinister. Things which if ever leaked into mainstream media would cause the foundations of sanity itself to tremble.

I had been tasked with retrieving a drive from a compromised field office in Geneva. Standard recovery op, nothing extraordinary. But when I accessed the files, I found something horrifying. I saw something which I shouldn't have seen in the first place. It made my blood boil, my stomach curdle and made me want to rip my eyes out. I was sitting in the chopper. A long flight home awaited me. However, this mission had been weird, not in a good way. No hidden traps, no killers lurking around Heck, no soul in sight which wanted to harm me. This got me curious enough to want to see the files. This was an obvious breach of regulations but I think they trusted me enough not to look. Well… I thought wrong.

It was an encrypted file with a password easy enough I thought as I had been trained to hack but this took longer. After about 20 minutes I got in. There was only a singular folder labeled “Test 1: Erebus” , a strange name I thought as I opened the file. There were a series of videos each labeled with date, time and the experiment number. Anxious, I clicked on the first one . 

I saw videos—grainy, black-and-white footage at first, then clearer, high-resolution recordings. Some were decades old, others disturbingly recent. In every clip, there were people—men, women, and even children—seated in stark, windowless rooms, their eyes hollow, their bodies restrained, their expressions vacant yet filled with something I can only describe as broken submission.

In one, a man sat strapped to a chair, electrodes attached to his temples. His head twitched with each electric pulse, his mouth opening in silent screams. A voice offscreen repeated the same phrase over and over, methodically, coldly. At first, he resisted. His lips trembled, his eyes darted around in confusion. Then, over the course of minutes—maybe hours—something changed. His breathing slowed. His pupils dilated. When the voice spoke again, he repeated the phrase without hesitation, his tone eerily devoid of emotion. The electrodes were removed, and the unseen figure asked him his name. He gave a different one than before.

Another video showed a child—no older than ten—being made to hold a gun. She sobbed at first, shaking, refusing to pull the trigger. A shadowy figure loomed over her, whispering something just out of the microphone’s reach. A few moments passed. Her cries faded. Her hands stopped trembling. Then, without hesitation, she fired. The camera panned to the target—a bound and blindfolded man slumped forward, motionless. The girl didn’t react. She simply turned, awaiting her next instruction.

One of the most chilling recordings showed a woman sitting in a dimly lit interrogation room. Her face was bruised, her lip split. The timestamp suggested this had taken place nearly twenty years ago, but the image quality made it feel like it had just happened. A man in a lab coat leaned into frame, holding a metronome. He set it on the table, letting it tick in steady, rhythmic beats. As she watched it swing back and forth, her breathing slowed, her eyes glazing over.

The man asked, “What is your purpose?”

At first, she hesitated. A flicker of defiance in her eyes.

Then, something clicked. Her expression shifted from confusion to eerie calm.

"To serve," she whispered.

"Who do you serve?"

"The ones who made me."

"Who made you?"

She smiled, a slow, unsettling smile.

"You did."

And then she stood up, removed a hidden blade from her sleeve, and slit her own throat.

The camera didn't cut away. It recorded everything—the way she didn’t flinch, the way she collapsed silently to the floor. And the way the man in the lab coat didn’t even react.

These weren’t just prisoners. They weren’t just test subjects.

They were being erased—not physically, but mentally. Their pasts overwritten, their identities fractured and rebuilt into something else entirely. Something obedient. Something untraceable.

Something inhuman.

I slammed my laptop shut. I was sweating profusely and I realised why these files were hidden. I now understand why everything is not what it seems. The creatures they had made were not of recent time. No, they dated decades ago. Old videos showed the raw experiments which got refined with the passage of time. I felt nauseous. I realised I was no longer safe. I heard a gun cock from the cockpit. I swallowed hard. The message had reached so fast already ? I knew my contract had been reworked, that I was a mistake now, a liability. I rushed towards the cockpit , The driver’s hands were trembling. He knew he could not kill me. I calmly stepped towards him and snapped his neck as I stepped over his lifeless body and grabbed a parachute and jumped out of there. 

When my clearance was revoked, it wasn’t just a bureaucratic shutdown—it was an instant death sentence. My name, once buried in classified files, was now flagged on every intelligence database. My access was severed so quickly that I barely had time to react. One moment, I was an elite asset with top-level clearance; the next, I was an expendable liability.

I barely managed to burn the copies of what I had stolen before the first kill team arrived. Zurich. A quiet, cold night. I had been holed up in a safe house—an apartment above a bakery, chosen for its nondescript location and easy exit points. I should’ve had more time, but they found me faster than I expected.

Three men. Highly trained. Silent. Efficient.

They didn’t announce themselves, didn’t try to negotiate. No warning—just execution. The first one came through the front door, suppressor already fitted onto his pistol, aiming for a clean headshot. I ducked before the bullet shattered the kitchen window behind me. The second one flanked from the balcony, dropping in from above. I heard the faint thump of his boots just before he raised his weapon.

I killed him first. A quick twist, a broken neck. The body crumpled, gun slipping from his hand. The third was smarter—he didn’t rush in blindly. He waited, anticipating my movements. I almost didn’t see him, lurking just outside the bathroom door. But when I turned my gun on him, he didn’t hesitate. He shot first. I felt the heat graze my arm, but I fired back before the pain registered.

The bullet hit him in the throat. He gurgled, slumped against the wall, and was dead before he hit the floor.

I didn’t wait to see if there were more. I grabbed what little I had and vanished into the night.

They wouldn’t stop coming.

Since that night, I haven’t stopped moving. I switch cities like a gambler switching cards—never staying long enough to be noticed, never returning to the same place twice.

Passports, burner phones, forged identities—I use them all. I change my face with subtle tricks: different haircuts, colored contacts, even slight changes to my posture and gait. In airports, I blend in with tourists. On streets, I become part of the background noise.

But no matter where I go, I feel them closing in.

It’s in the way I catch glimpses of shadows moving too purposefully in reflective windows. The way footsteps behind me seem just a little too synchronized. The cars that idle near my hotel longer than they should, engines rumbling softly, waiting.

It’s the paranoia that has kept me alive.

The worst part? I have no idea who I can trust.

This isn’t just about escaping an intelligence agency—this is about escaping an idea, a program designed to be invisible, to operate without limits.

If Erebus is real—if they have been running these programs as long as those files suggest—then it means there are people walking around right now who have been programmed to obey without question. People who don’t even know they’re assets.

It could be the friendly bartender who served me a drink last night. The old man reading a newspaper across from me at the train station. The woman in the elevator who hesitated just a second too long before pressing her floor button.

Anyone could be one of theirs.

That’s why I stopped reaching out for help.

Every time I pick up a phone, send a message, or even leave a trace of my existence, I risk alerting someone—someone who might not even realize they’re waiting for a trigger, a command buried deep in their subconscious, ready to turn them against me.

I am alone in this.

At first, I thought the Amazon would be safe. It’s one of the few places on Earth where technology struggles to keep up, where satellites lose track, and GPS signals become unreliable.

I went deep. No credit cards. No cell service. Just cash, a fake name, and the dense jungle swallowing me whole.

For a while, it worked. The silence was almost comforting. No distant hum of traffic, no digital noise. Just the rustling of trees, the chatter of insects, the occasional growl of something moving in the underbrush.

But even there, I felt them creeping in.

It started with whispers in Portuguese—locals asking questions about a foreigner who had arrived unannounced. Then, I noticed the same faces appearing too often in different villages. A man leaning against a market stall, staring just a second too long. A woman pretending to haggle for fruit but glancing at me when she thought I wasn’t looking.

They were probing. Waiting.

I left before they could act.

I thought Eastern Europe would be safer. It was once a playground for spies, and old networks still existed, buried beneath layers of corruption and bureaucracy. I used contacts I hadn’t spoken to in years—former assets, smugglers, people who owed me favors.

Budapest was supposed to be a safe house.

But the moment I stepped into my contact’s apartment, I knew something was wrong.

He looked at me like I was already dead. His hands were shaking as he poured a drink, avoiding eye contact.

"They know," he said, voice barely above a whisper. "You have to leave. Now."

I didn’t ask how.

I didn’t ask who.

I just walked out and never looked back.

Now, I sleep in abandoned buildings. I move through underground tunnels when I can. I stay off cameras, out of sight, off the grid.

Cash only. No phones. No digital footprint.

I know the digital world is their playground. Every search, every transaction, every CCTV camera—it all feeds into their network. The moment I use any of it, I light up like a beacon.

But I can’t keep this up forever.

I can feel my body slowing down. My reflexes aren’t as sharp as they used to be. The exhaustion is catching up with me.

I need a plan.

Something more than just survival.

Because sooner or later, they’ll find me again. And when they do—

I won’t be able to run anymore.

I have to be careful now. The CIA doesn’t just kill people like me; they erase them from history. No records, no traces, no one left to remember. If they succeed, it’ll be as if I never existed at all.

The world needs to know. Not just about me, but about all the others. The ones who never got the chance to run. The ones who were turned into something less than human, programmed to kill, to obey, to forget who they once were.

I am in an abandoned building right now . I might not be able to answer your questions. I might not survive. If they are desperate enough they might even send those god forsaken things after me those mind controlled freaks. I might not survive. This post might get deleted. If you think I’m lying, think again. I have hacked into some unsuspecting user's account to tell you this so that they can’t trace me, can’t find me again. Soon my energy will run out. But now I have put it out there. I will update you guys If i'm out there If you’re reading this, it means I’m still out there. Still fighting. Still running.

But for how much longer, I don’t know.

If you never hear from me again, just know: the Agency doesn’t make mistakes. And I was their biggest mistake of all
