I used to think the hours before dawn were the purest part of the day. They were just for me, for the rhythm of my feet on the dew-soaked grass, the silent thwump of my soccer ball, and the quiet burn in my lungs. I practice at the old North Field, which backs right up against the thickest, most impenetrable stretch of woods in the county. It’s the kind of forest that eats light, where the trees look like a solid black wall until the sun hits them. But it was in that black wall that my peaceful routine began to break.

It started last Monday. I was wrapping up my drills, around 5:15 a.m., when I heard it. Music. It wasn't loud, but it was high-pitched and sickeningly sweet, like a music box playing a perfect, endless waltz. It had a strange, orchestral quality, yet it felt muffled, as if filtered through water. I stopped instantly, listening. The music pulsed from deep within the forest, and when I looked at the tree line, I saw a circular break in the density. The trees were unnaturally spaced, forming a kind of perfect, spherical amphitheater. In its center, a dim, flat amber light flickered, the color of old, stagnant honey. I rationalized it as some idiot teenagers having a bonfire or an all-night party, packed my gear, and left, but the joyful, eerie tune stuck in my head.

Tuesday, the music was louder. It was still the same waltz, but now I could pick out what sounded like voices, too—a chorus of high-pitched humming that matched the synthetic strings. It was too pristine, too flawless, and it made the hair on the back of my neck prickle. The circular clearing was still there, and the light was now stronger. It wasn't flickering this time; it was a low, constant glow emanating from the ground itself. It looked like a hidden stage. I stood there, frozen, the ball at my feet, watching the unnaturally glowing circle of perfect dark earth. I didn't practice a second more that morning. My heart was thumping hard against my ribs, and I could feel my childhood curiosity—the kind that always got me into trouble—starting to take hold. I needed to know what this was.

On Wednesday, the fear was overshadowed by the need to see. I didn't even bring my ball. As I approached the field, the music was no longer distant; it was vibrating in the cool air around me. When I reached the tree line, the amber light was dazzling in the pre-dawn gloom, and it illuminated the full scene. They were dancing. Maybe twenty people, moving in slow, synchronized, ritualistic steps. They were all dressed in white linen, like ancient robes—long dresses for the women, flowing tunics and trousers for the men. Every face was hidden behind a smooth, featureless white mask. No mouths, no noses, just two small, dark eye-holes. 

Their movement was agonizingly slow and unified, swaying back and forth to the mechanical, joyful rhythm. It felt less like a celebration and more like a trance. I felt a genuine panic, a cold spike of certainty that I was watching something I shouldn't. I must have made a sound, a little gasp, because one of the figures on the perimeter, a tall man, didn't break his sway but slowly, smoothly, tilted his white mask toward my position. The blankness of the eye holes was terrifyingly focused. I ran harder than I’ve ever run in my life.

I skipped Thursday entirely. But by Friday, I was back. The music and lights were gone. The woods were just woods. But I walked the perimeter, my curiosity a physical ache in my chest, and I found it: a thin, nearly invisible path, marked only by small, flat river stones placed every few feet, leading straight toward the clearing. Tucked into the roots of a giant oak, the path’s entry marker, was a single, white paper flower, folded intricately like an origami crane. Beside it, I saw something else, something metallic. I reached down and picked it up. It was a tiny, gold-plated key, the kind that locks a small box or a diary. My hand shook when I recognized it. It was the key to my old locker from high school—a key I was certain I’d lost years ago. This wasn't some random ritual anymore. This was personal.

Saturday morning, the air was heavy and still. I took the path. I walked slowly, past the smooth stones, and stepped into the circular plaza. It was perfectly round, packed earth, oddly dry and totally barren. I walked to the center, pocketing the key. The air here was silent, save for a low, continuous thrum beneath my feet, like a gigantic, slow heartbeat. I looked down, and a chill of absolute horror went through me. Embedded in the earth, caked in dried, flaky black mud, was a single silver soccer cleat. My size. The left one. I had lost its match on this very field three years ago, convinced I’d kicked it off into the high weeds.

I backed up slowly. The cleat wasn’t the only thing. Scattered around the perimeter of the circle, where the dancers had stood, were dozens of those white paper flowers. I kicked one over. Beneath it was a faded, plastic nametag from the elementary school summer camp I attended. I kicked another. It was a dog tag from the stray I had adopted and lost a decade ago. Each flower marked a forgotten relic of my personal history, a piece of myself I thought was gone forever. The music suddenly swelled, not from the woods, but from everywhere, and it was no longer joyful—it was ecstatic, pleading. I finally understood. 

The circular clearing wasn't a formation in the woods; it was the boundary of something ancient, and the people weren't inviting me to a dance. They were offering up their lost pieces, their lost selves, to fill the center of the circle. I was the final piece. I dropped to my knees, staring at the cleat, and as the music hit a deafening crescendo, I saw movement.

In the center of the circle, where I had just been standing, a figure slowly rose from the ground. It was fully dressed in white linen, and it wore the blank, smooth mask. But it wasn't the cleat it held. It was my practice ball, the one I had left on the field on Monday. The figure raised its hand—my hand, I realized with a gut-wrenching certainty—and tossed the ball gently back toward the path. Then it turned fully, and I saw the back of its neck. It wasn't wearing white linen over its hair; the long, dark hair was woven entirely into the cloth of the tunic, thick and perfectly still. 

The figure didn't turn its body, but the white mask tilted, just like the other dancer's had done days before. The black eye-holes stared. I scrambled backward, tripping over the path stones, and I saw the figure raise its arms in a wide, slow, embracing gesture of welcoming. The music was now a unified, roaring wave of beautiful, horrible joy, and I knew it was waiting for me. I ran without looking back, but now, tucked inside my own left shoe, the one I’d worn to practice, I can feel a single, small, gold-plated key. I think I know what it unlocks, and I know I have to go back and find out
