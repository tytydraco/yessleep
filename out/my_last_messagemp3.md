Hey, if you're listening to this message, I'm probably dead by now. My lifeless body might be lying in front of you, or it might be half decomposed, deep down the earth. My fate, It already has been sealed.

So, Right when I woke up, I-I started feeling his presence. Random hallucinations of the past, my family... they-they felt so real, Kathie... My daughter...

Then, random pieces of broken glasses, Faces, drawn onto my mirror with... blood. Gone, before I can even take a second look.

But the most prominent of them all, a presence so... so evil, that one would beg to die after experiencing only a small fragment of it. So So evil that neither gods, nor mortals could contain him.

I had only head about it by my grandmother's mouth, she used to always tell me the stories, Before she mysteriously disappeared, not even a trace was found of her. The stories were about a war, so brutal that an ocean could be filled with the blood that was flown in it. But, a war against whom? A war against... it. Humans and gods, side by side, fighting to contain him... but failing inevitably... and that's the last time he roamed here on Earth, I guess he was... tired of all this... or something much more cold, he was.... bored.

But feeling this presence now, here, on Earth? This is far from normal...

Grandma used to say, "He'll first torment you to an extent where death will only be the way to escape from all this

He'll devour you slowly, ripping your flesh apart, then feasting on your bones at last, and... he'll make sure you stay alive. Screaming will be useless. It'll only increase the pain... and his enjoyment...

Nothing you did, or will do will matter from that point of time...

You just have to wait... helplessly, in agony"

I don't know how... how am I able to still speak, while my head lies in the depths of hell. I...I can still feel that burning sensation around my cheeks. How am I not dead? Is this... Is this all even real?

NO! This is real... this has to be.... I saw his dark hands, it looked like I'm staring into an abyss. His face, his face was... I don't know how to describe it, it was just a vast abyss of nothingness.

I saw him reaching for my neck, and slowly pulling it off... He looked at me, trying to make sense of my spine, dangling from my head, I saw as my head slowly transformed into ash... But, I still was able to see.... Everything.

Is this all even real?

No.... NO please!!! NO! This isn't real... THIS ISN'T REAL!!!!! I...I went to the bathroom... to... to freshen up. And there... in the mirror, I saw the unfathomable. My head... it was... it wasn't there! What I saw was a frail, slightly decomposed body. Barely able to stand up, without a skull and a backbone. How!? How can I still see!? How can all this be real?!

Why Me?!
