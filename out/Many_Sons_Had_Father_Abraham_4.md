With an overnight bag packed with essentials, and my laptop in its bag, I piled everything in the passenger seat of the car.

&#x200B;

The sky was just starting to get dark above me. God willing, by the time night fell and Joel came home with Patrick, I’d be long gone and Smokey Falls would be far in my rearview.

&#x200B;

I should’ve left sooner… I should’ve begged Joel to leave the night after I first met Father Abraham. But I had to make excuses. Was that wrong of me, not to want to walk away from three years because of some suspicions? Was that a mistake? I guess it hardly mattered… Too late to change things now. Either way, I was leaving.

&#x200B;

I keyed the engine and pulled out of the dirt driveway, heading for the interstate. I gripped the steering wheel tightly with both hands, the vivid memory of Father Abraham plunging his knife into that boy's heart still seared into my mind.

&#x200B;

The nearest town was about an hour away. Once I got there, I’d stop by the local police station and give them the SD card I’d taken out of the camera. They could deal with Abraham, Patrick, and Joel. I would’ve been happy never to speak to that man again… God… I hadn’t thought Joel was ever capable of being part of something like this. The man I thought I’d married had been kind, he’d been sweet, he’d taken care of people! The man I thought I’d married wouldn’t have stood for something like this! But I guess you never really know a person, do you?

&#x200B;

As I drove down the highway, I almost felt a little lighter. My heart was still pounding more violently in my chest than it ever had before, but Shannon, Patrick and Father Abraham seemed to melt away behind me. Someone else would deal with them. I was getting out… I’d made my choice to leave before things got too serious… That was the best thing I could’ve done, right?

&#x200B;

My grip on the steering wheel didn’t let up. I kept thinking that I was almost home free… Just a few more miles and I’d be away from this awful situation.

&#x200B;

Then I saw the headlights in my rearview mirror. They shone bright. Almost blinding, like whoever it was had their high beams on. Typical for some asshole driving a big pickup truck, I guessed.

&#x200B;

The lights behind me were getting closer as the truck sped towards me. Also typical for an asshole in a big pickup truck, I supposed although something about those lights made me uneasy. Maybe it was just my own paranoid nerves… That was probably exactly it, but… The closer that truck got, the more I was sure that I recognized it.

&#x200B;

From what I could see, the truck was a deep red Ford F-250. It had a grille guard that was designed to look like it was made of barbed wire and a big protruding pair of bull horns jutting out of the grille. Looking at it, I recognized it by the horns and knew it had a pair of those ugly little truck nuts hanging off the back of it.

&#x200B;

Oh God, I knew this truck…

&#x200B;

This was Patrick’s truck.

&#x200B;

Feeling a spike of panic rising in my chest, I hit the gas, speeding faster down the highway, glancing into the rearview mirror to see Patrick getting closer. His stupid redneck truck just kept getting closer, like an advancing wall coming for me. How the hell had he known I was trying to leave? Had someone told him? Had Shannon noticed me leaving? Was it Briar?

&#x200B;

At that moment, it didn’t matter. The only thing I cared about was losing Patrick, which seemed more and more like it was going to be impossible. He veered into the next lane and I could hear the titanic roar of his engine as he hit the gas, slowly inching closer to come up alongside me.

&#x200B;

I glanced over at the truck and could see Joel watching me from the cabin… Never before had the sight of my own husband's face filled me with so much dread. He stared at me, with no expression that I could read. I tore my eyes away from him to focus on the road. My speedometer slowly crept upwards.

&#x200B;

60.

&#x200B;

65.

&#x200B;

70.

&#x200B;

80.

&#x200B;

But Patrick didn’t fall behind me. He just kept slowly pulling ahead. Up ahead I could see the road curving sharply and I knew that this was it… We were going too fast. There was no way either of us could turn here… and I realized that Patrick had probably been counting on that.

&#x200B;

With my mind racing, I felt like I stopped thinking entirely. I spun the wheel, trying to lean into the turn. My tires skidded along the asphalt and from the corner of my eye, I saw that Patrick had fallen a little behind me. He hadn’t even tried to turn.

&#x200B;

Of course it was a trap.

&#x200B;

As I tried to turn, Patrick hit the gas again. His truck sped forward slamming into my car from the side. The entire vehicle shook. One of those stupid bull horns shattered my drivers side window as the force of his truck buckled the drivers side door. Cracks spiderwebbed across my windshield as my car was forced off the road and into a ditch by the turn. I felt the car hit the ground hard before the world seemed to roll. My head hit the ceiling and my ears started to ring. I didn’t seem to notice it when I stopped moving. My world still felt like it was spinning and everything had gone out of focus. I slumped against the back of my seat, my eyes unfocused and blurry as I slowly began to drift away… And for a moment, I wondered if I was dying.

&#x200B;

I looked up towards the headlights of Patricks truck. I could see the doors opening as he and Joel stepped out and I could hear them talking, but not what they were saying. Darkness crept into the edges of my vision and I silently hoped that it was death… Somehow, I knew death would be better than whatever they had planned for me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The world around me was still blurry and hard to make out when I started drifting back into consciousness. I could feel cold air blowing against my face and hard gravel against my cheek. I knew I was out of the car. My ears were still faintly ringing and my entire body ached. But despite the pain, I was relatively sure that I was in one piece… Unfortunately…

&#x200B;

I could faintly hear the rumble of an engine nearby and the headlights of Patrick's truck still blinded me. I could hear distant footsteps along the asphalt and faint voices around me. It took me a few moments to recognize them as Joel and Patrick.

*“Yeah and I heard you tell me you had it under control.”*

*“I did…”*

*“The hell you did, Joel! Does this look under control to you! I told you, I told you clear as goddamn day to keep your woman in check! You didn’t. So this is what happens.”*

&#x200B;

I blinked slowly as two pairs of legs came into focus a few feet away from me. Patrick and Joel. Patrick was leaning against the side of his truck while Joel stood a few feet away. He kept glancing over at me, although I wasn’t sure if he knew I was waking up or not.

&#x200B;

“We can still make this right.” Joel said, “We’ll… We don’t need to involve Father A-”

“Will you quit your goddamn bellyaching.” Patrick sighed, “Goddamnit, I swear the worst thing you ever did was leave town. All it did was soften you up.”

“It didn’t-”

“Bullshit it didn’t. You had a year to get your woman in check. A year to ensure she was ready to join the family. And the fuckin’ day after she gets here, she’s poking around the Church during Prayer Circles, then there’s this fucking video camera horseshit! You have any idea how much of a mess you left me to clean up? *DO YOU?*”

&#x200B;

I watched Joel shrink back from him, recoiling as if Patrick was about to hit him. Patrick just spit onto the ground.

“If it were anyone else, you’d be working at Smokey Oak. You’re goddamn lucky that Father Abraham listens to me. Swear to God, neither you nor Briar seem to understand what I’ve done for this family! Y’know I kept her out of Smokey Oak after that whole fucking incident with Minnie. And I was hoping, I was really, truly hoping I wouldn’t have the same goddamn trouble with you but here we are. Congratulations Joel. You’re as much of a fuck up as Briar is.”

“N-no, Patrick don’t say that!”

“THEN PROVE ME WRONG!” He snapped, “Prove me wrong…”

&#x200B;

I could see headlights on the road. New headlights. Another car approaching. My body was still too sore to move although my every nerve told me to run. I weakly tried to pick myself up only to collapse again. Patrick looked over at me and scoffed.

&#x200B;

“Well, well… Look who’s waking up…” He said as he approached me, “Was wondering if you’d try to leave town…  Was really hoping you wouldn’t, for Joel’s sake. But once again, you’ve disappointed me, Danielle.”

He grabbed me by the shirt and forced me onto my knees.

*“Fuck you…”* I rasped, my voice hoarse. Patrick just laughed.

“Oh man… Y’know, I was hoping my little brother would bring home a nice girl. Instead we got you. Too infected to save. Too dumb to run. What a waste of meat.”

&#x200B;

The headlights on the road slowed to a stop as they pulled over. I recognized the new car as a large black Cadillac SUV and from the drivers seat, stepped the looming figure of Father Abraham.

&#x200B;

“You found her,” Abraham said, sounding disturbingly calm.

“Caught her making for the highway.” Patrick replied, “Had to rough her up a little, Father… But she’s still kicking, far as I can tell.”

&#x200B;

Abraham looked past me, towards the wreck of my car and narrowed his eyes.

“The Lord rewards a steady hand, Patrick.” He said, “It’s harder to redeem a sinner when they’re entombed in twisted, broken metal.”

“I got the job done, didn’t I?” Patrick asked. Abraham just scoffed.

“The camera footage?” He asked.

“Taken care of. And we’ve got her laptop.”

“Good. Do what you need to.” Abraham said before his attention returned to me. He put on a knowing smile as he approached me.

&#x200B;

“Danielle…” He said softly, “Did you really think we would not notice your… Intrusion, into our affairs the other night?”

I didn’t respond. I just stared back at him, afraid to say a single word.

“Joel as always spoke out for you, of course. He had hoped that should you see the beauty of our work firsthand, you might understand… With your curiosity sated, you might open yourself to fully join our community. But Patrick and I had our doubts… Hence why I asked him to ensure you didn’t do anything too rash…”

&#x200B;

“Go to hell…” Was the only response I could offer.

“My dear, you and I are in hell right now.” Father Abraham replied, “You may not realize it, but this country, this world… For such depravity to exist in such a widespread state as it does, we must surely be in Hell…”

“You can’t be serious…” I murmured.

&#x200B;

“I am.” He replied, “I suppose you wouldn’t see it. Every institution in this nation… In most nations normalizes and condones sin. The courts, the government, the media,  the corporations, the schools, even other Churches! Their every breath defies the word of God as they try to twist immorality into morality. But I see through it all. We see through it all… I suppose that is both a blessing and a curse…”

“Morality…” I repeated, “I watched you kill a teenage boy… How the fuck do you justify that?”

&#x200B;

“I purified him. I shed his blood and bathed him within the holy light of our Lord. In doing so, he was reborn.” Father Abraham said, before pausing, “Ah… But perhaps you didn’t see… I must confess, we’ve never tried to record one of our prayer circles. So to be completely honest, I’m not entirely certain just how much you saw. The power of the Lord… I don’t believe it’s meant to be recorded. Not in the way you tried to do it, at least. It is meant to exist only in the memory. Nowhere else. What did you see, Danielle? Did you watch me take the dagger to that boys heart? Did you watch me drain his blood? What then?”

&#x200B;

I didn’t answer. Father Abraham stared down at me for a moment before chuckling.

“How little you know…” He said wistfully, “Jeremy Holman is currently at home with his family, recovering from this process. Much like Minnie is, after her purification. Perhaps like you might be at some point… We will see…”

“If you’re going to kill me, kill me…” I said, “Just get it over with.”

&#x200B;

“Now, now. No need to jump to such a harsh conclusion so quickly.” Abraham replied, “I believe that salvation is a choice… And I will give you the opportunity to choose it. But you must earn it first. I have no intention of killing you, Danielle. I have no intention of killing anybody. I simply want you to join our community. I want you to sit at our table and break bread with us, I want you to live a full life with your husband, your inevitable children, your grandchildren. I want you to die old, surrounded by the ones you love and I want you to be welcomed into the Lord's embrace. That, is what I want for you… But you have to want it too…”

&#x200B;

He patted me on the shoulder and gave me a warm, almost fatherly smile. It chilled me down to my bones.

“Patrick, take her to Smokey Oak.” He said calmly, “Give her a few days to recover, then set her to work.”

&#x200B;

Patrick nodded as Father Abraham turned away. I was forced onto my feet again and dragged into the back of the truck. Joel just stood by and watched as his brother took me. His eyes met mine for a moment before he looked away.

I didn’t call out for him to help me.

I knew he wouldn’t.

&#x200B;

The darkened hills rolled past my window as we drove down a dirt road towards Smokey Oak Farm. My hands were cuffed and I was still a little out of it from the car accident. Neither Patrick nor Joel spoke as we drove. The only thing I could do was stare vacantly out the window, a looming pit of dread sinking in my stomach, twisting my insides and making me feel sick.

&#x200B;

In the darkness, I could see the shadows of crosses on long poles as we pulled into a driveway. I could see the lights in several cabins. The truck stopped and Patrick got out. Joel didn’t. He just sat there in the passenger seat, dead silent and shifting uneasily. I think he felt my eyes on him, but he wasn’t man enough to say anything about it.

&#x200B;

I on the other hand was.

“You really are a piece of shit…” I said quietly. He still didn’t look at me.

“I loved you… I came here because I wanted to do something for you… For your family… And this whole time you were lying to me…”

“I wasn’t lying.” He said softly, “You just… You’re sick… That’s it… The rest of the world. It’s a sick place. But being here will help you. It’ll teach you to fit in with Society. The way God intended. Then we can be together… And you’ll understand why we had to do this. I promise you, you will!”

&#x200B;

I didn’t dignify that with a response, and I didn’t really have a chance to either. The car door was pulled open and Patrick dragged me out, onto shaking legs.

“Walk.” He ordered before nudging me towards the door of a nearby cabin. I didn’t move.

“Walk.” He said, more forcefully this time before pushing me, knocking me to the ground. I lay there and he stood over me for a moment before drawing a foot back and kicking me square in the gut. I let out a wheeze of pain before he grabbed me by the hair and forced me up to my feet again.

“Walk. I ain’t telling you again.” He growled.

&#x200B;

On trembling legs, I walked, shuffling towards the door. He opened it for me and ushered me inside.

“Got you a room down near the end of the hall, all to yourself.” Patrick said as he led me through the plain wooden hallway, “You’ll be up at four for breakfast. The day starts at five. I’ll have someone show you the ropes tomorrow. I’m thinking you’ll be in the fields. You get dinner at seven in the evening. Then you’re back in here.”

&#x200B;

“Father Abraham said I’d get a day to rest…” I rasped.

“Well Father Abraham ain’t here, is he?” Patrick asked, “I already played nice with you, girl. I’m done. As of now, your scrawny ass is mine. Not Joel’s. Not Abrahams. Mine. Is that clear?”

&#x200B;

His cold eyes met mine and as much as I wanted to swear at him, I felt a primal terror well up inside of me. I only managed a faint nod. He huffed in response before continuing down the hall.

“You might think you were playing smart before. But you try pulling that shit in here, I’ll shoot you dead, girl and Joel won’t do a damn thing to stop me. You run. You die. You disobey. You die. You waste my goddamn time, you fucking die. That clear to you?”

&#x200B;

“Yes…” I rasped as Patrick stopped in front of an empty room. He pushed the door open and gestured to the plain mattress inside.

“Welcome to your new home. You’re gonna be here until you learn to be a functional goddamn member of Society… Until the Lord deems you ready to be saved… And if you can’t be saved, then Abraham will save you. Choice is yours one way or the other.”

He nudged me into the room before closing the door behind me. The heavy sound of it made me jump and I heard the click of a lock on the other side.

“Get yourself a good nights sleep, Dani. You’re gonna need it. Welcome to Smokey Oak.”

&#x200B;

With that, I heard his footsteps fading away into the distance and when he was gone, there was only an uncomfortable silence remaining. Slowly, I dragged myself to the bed and curled up on the mattress. I didn’t have the energy to investigate this room more. I only wanted to lie down and cry.

&#x200B;

The only window in the room, which was barred with what looked like iron showed nothing but darkness outside, and the darkness swallowed me up, making it easy for me to slip into an empty, dreamless sleep as my new life began.
