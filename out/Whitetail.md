It was that time of year again. Meeting up with Matt and Olly in our local bar, we got to organising our next trip.



Like an annual holiday, each fall we’d find a new national park to camp out in, over the weekend. As the rota went, that year it was my decision.



Having already planned out our whole excursion, being the prepared person I was, our destination was set. We’d be charting a portion of the Appalachian trail.



Already researching some of the local mythos, I had my spooky campfire story and harmless prank locked in, ready to get Matt back for scaring the shit out of me the previous year.



That was just it, spend some time with your mates, enjoy the natural beauty of our country and scare each other with some made up campfire story.



It had worked that way for the last five years. Why would that time be any different?



\-



Finishing up our breakfast, we saddled up my aging Corolla and embarked. Olly’s tunes were impeccable as always, as we jammed out to some peak 2010’s white girl bops.



A couple of hours in, as if the realisation hit Matt like a truck, he flung himself backwards in my passenger seat and swore.



“Fuck! I forgot my dam pillow. Fucking AHHHH!”



Laughing for a second, that triggered me into silently itemising my own list.



“Crap, I think I left my toiletries bag on the sink.”



I remembered packing the bag, but evidently it didn’t make its way on our trip.



Olly, loving our collective pain, couldn’t stop laughing, especially as he was the most forgetful out of all three of us. However, his sniggers quickly fell, as Matt spat out a retort.



“Yeah, yeah dickhead, at least I don’t get my mum to pack my bag, at twenty-four.”



Interspersed with the occasional snack and toilet break, as Olly had a bladder the size of a pea, we eventually made it to the gravel parking area. The unusually low number of other vehicles almost got me worrying that the trail had been closed.



Fortunately, a family of five pulled in behind us and unpacked with the rapid efficiency of seasoned campers. Seeing them funnel through the wooden gate in the time it took me to stretch and open my trunk, those worries subsided.



It had rained the day prior, though as it was on the way over, the midday sun peaked from behind the calm clouds, signalling a fair-weather hike.



Still as pumped as we were that morning, I whipped out the map as the boys followed me onto the trail. The hike was as perfect as we’d expected.



Shade from the enormous pines shielded us from the ever-radiant light cascading through the canopy, as we marched on to the tune of Olly’s constant chatter. Though he wasn’t one to keep quiet, the ambient whistles of unseen birds and soft breeze quickly drowned out whatever it was he was yapping about.



Breaking from the trees for a short section, Matt pointed out a small group of deer trotting from across the plains, on a lower plateau. Far too busy to even acknowledge us for the most part, they scurried on to another section of tree line, tailed by one seemingly older member.



Though we were easily around seventy meters away, it stopped and gazed over. For an uncomfortable moment the older deer seemed to stare straight through me, those miniature white pinpricks in its otherwise black eyes almost singling me out.



Before I could even comprehend the situation fully, it turned and fell in line with the others. Olly, without even finishing his current ramble chirped up.



“It can probably smell you from here, Ah haha ha!”



Sarcastically laughing, I made my way back to the head of the group as we pressed on.



Though the scenery was beautiful, something felt wrong about being there. Apart from that family earlier on, we’d not seen another soul for a good couple of hours by that point.



Pushing those thoughts out of my mind, at least we’d not have to worry about keeping the noise down.



Yes, there were designated sites, but as always, we preferred the privacy to really enjoy our time. Diverting from the main trail, we made it to a small clearing which would be our spot for that night.



I’d been clued into this area by a long-distance friend who’d travelled the trail a couple of years back. He’d given it a glowing review and urged me to pitch up here, which I’m glad we did.



Thick groves encircled the around 11/11m clearing which fit our three tents and campfire perfectly. Remnants of campers gone, stained the shallow pit in its centre where a small pile of firewood laid.



Digging out and setting up our gear, we were settled for the first night. Leaving Matt to start on the sausages, me and Olly scouted out our vicinity. We were supposed to be collecting firewood, but with the small reserve already at camp, what we really wanted was to find the creek.



Damian had also informed me that there was a slow flowing creek and small waterfall nearby, though had given us fair warning that it was frequented by a range of animals, which he emphasised.



Breaking from the treeline, we emerged to a picturesque view, exactly as he’d said. Though the day was drawing to a close, that creek was serine.



Its soft babbling mixing with the now chirping nocturnal insects brought a calming wave over the both of us. In awe, neither of us had noticed the lone stag at the crest of the fall.



Bowing as to drink from the flowing stream, it too hadn’t clocked our presence. A snap diverted all three of us to the other side of the creek, deeper betwixt the dense wood ahead.



Scurrying away into the underbrush, Olly tapped my shoulder and beckoned for us join the deer and return to the camp, though I strained my eyes to get a better picture of whatever had startled the stag.  



Though neither of us saw anything from across the way, the majesty that our surroundings had captivated, all but fell away. In its place, that primal fear, borne of whatever now coughed out a raspy croak from the shadowed treeline.



Turning and scampering back to camp, the safety that cindering lifeline brought calmed us.



No natural creature willingly wanders close to those flickering flames, and with the drinks flowing, those fears had been relegated to the backs of our minds.



That being said, I couldn’t shake that engrained feeling of being watched. Those two caught on quick and gave me a fair amount of shit for being scared at my own location.



“Mate, you’re supposed to be scaring us. How have you wet yourself already?”



Laughing in tandem, they were right. Downing the rest of my drink and musting up all the courage I’d been lacking so far, I fuelled up the fire and got to telling my campfire story.



From what I can recall it was something to do with creatures that could perfectly mimic animals. Matt wasn’t buying it at first, calling my story a crappy copy of his wendigo-based tale from our last trip.



The basic gist was that they couldn’t speak and instead made a choaking coughing sound as they attempted to mimic the voices of people. With that and their uncanny appearance, they’d scare off people attempting to stay overnight.



My plan was to use the deer mask I’d brought to jump them on the second night, but a couple of minutes into telling my poorly crafted story, a rustling came from the bushes behind Matt’s tent.



Quit rightly freaked out, we all aimed out torches at the area, only to see a stag slowly emerge from the foliage. The animal looked to be in a trancelike state, not even glancing at us or seeming bothered its antlers were snagging on the drooping branches as it entered and exited our camp.



Simply walking in from one side of Matt’s tent to the other, we were all stunned to silence. Taking that as a good enough sign to stop drinking and just call it a night, we pilled on whatever timber we had remaining, in the hopes it would keep whatever else was out there at bay.



I knew full well that wild animals don’t like people, especially animals as skittish as deer, but that one looked wrong. I remembered something about chronic wasting, even bringing it up to the boys in the morning, but still, its hollow white eyes were burned into my head for the rest of the following Saturday.



Olly looked restless that morning, saying something about one of us needing to take our inhaler with all that croaking we were doing the past night, but we brushed it off as him trying to keep up my bit.



None of us really wanted to talk about it, other than my suggestion, leaving that experience in the clearing as we eat breakfast and departed.



Pretty quickly we were back to it, mesmerised by the quiet serenity of the trail and cracking jokes. Though the path seemed to narrow and we got caught up in the occasional lower branch, it was smooth sailing.



Around halfway into our day, at a conveniently placed bench, carved out of a fallen log, a dog walker strolled bye. Honestly it startled us a little, having not seen anyone since we entered.



The man smiled as we stroked his black and white pointer, departing with little more than a ‘hi’. Finishing up our food, we returned to the slightly steeper portion of our remaining hike.



Once we broke from the heavy canopy of the woodland we’d been trekking through, all the chirps, squeaks and croaks faded. Before we knew it, all that we could hear was the chilling howl of the cooling day.



Out there, exposed in that portion of grassland, that feeling returned. Though we could easily see over vastly greater distances in all directions, some part of my mind screamed out that with the next swivel of my head, I’d be locked in another staring match with something unnatural.



Finally cresting the ridge we’d been following our eyes collectively met the trails snaking path, into a deeper section of woodland. Fixed to our position, a single stag stood at the entry way, head down in the dirt.



Though for a couple of seconds it seemed perfectly normal, the longer we looked the more its movements seemed off. The closest thing I can compare it to, is the motion of chewing, though more human, with its lower jaw moving up and down.



The animals mouth also seemed off. Instead of the thin mussel characteristic of most deer, its moth was more squared and shorter, opening at an angle far too wide.



The thing that unnerved us the most and caused me to take a few steps back, was the fact it wasn’t eating anything. Those false movements only seeing to mimic actual chewing.



In the instant it saw us, it darted back into the undergrowth out of sight. I didn’t want to take another step, ready to turn tail and huff it back to the car, even through the night if we had to.



“That’s not a deer.”



Olly’s voice shook, dislodging the carefree attitude he’d carried throughout the trip.



Matt wasn’t having it though.



“So what, its some deformed deer. Yeah, it looks fucked up, but I got my Ruger so were good.”



Flashing his hip elicited a tired sigh from Olly. Their spat from back when we were planning this trip rearing its head after Matt flat out refused to leave his holster at home due to potential dangers. Olly was a very strong advocate, but regardless I think even he was a little reassured after seen that animal.



Breaking their circling argument, I put the rest of our hike to a vote. As expected, Olly agreed with me, though Matt wouldn’t budge.



“We’re over halfway back now, plus we’ve gotta sleep here one more night regardless. I don’t care if you two wanna go back, I’ll be seeing you at the car.”



Though we didn’t like it, Matt was right, and he had the gun.



Conceding, we pushed through those final couple of hours. The rest of that day and even into the evening I could tell it was getting to them, no matter how much Matt tried to hide it behind a stoic expression and Olly behind his constant yammer.



Though we had a lot more cans still, no one seemed overly eager to drink, especially with the woods having eyes now. That feeling only grew the deeper into the night we stayed, with our roaring campfire keeping the monsters at bay.



Calling it a night way earlier then we ever had, the fire was fuelled as we all zipped up for what was going to be a long night.



I can’t remember if I was actually asleep or just in the throes of consciousness, but Olly’s scream jolted me to life like a taser.



Grabbing my multitool and flicking the zip down at a breakneck pace, I was met with the glacial chill of a pitch-black night.



Straining to focus until Matts torch blinded us both, Olly was petrified mid-way through his apparent unzipping.



Though I didn’t see what he had, I recall the sounds of cantering hooves just as his scream reanimated me, though it didn’t click until he painted the picture.



According to Olly, he’d woken up as nature called on his infinitesimally small bladder. Stretching he saw the faint embers of our fire cast a hunched silhouette across his nylon wall.



Rocking over onto his knees to unzip his tent, he spoke, questioning whether we needed more timber as he assumed the person was one of us. Mere moments before the flap opened exposing him to the truth, a gargled hoarse voice groaned out in an almost anthropomorphic tone.



“Not … deer.”



Peaking at whatever that creature was caused Olly’s death rattle. Honestly, I’d never heard him scream that loud before in my life and I don’t think I will again.



His best description in that state was that of a stag, crouched down in the posture a person would if they were stoking the fire. The moment their eyes met, it scowled bearing its straight, slim teeth, before lurching up and galloping into the undergrowth, like a human on all fours.



The thing that freaked him out, aside from the broken regurgitated sound of his voice, were the milky white eyes of the creature we’d been seeing all weekend.



Nobody got anymore sleep for the rest of that night, singularly focused on keeping that fire going until daybreak.



I know Matt wouldn’t admit it, but even he was shitting bricks too. For once Olly was silent. Though I never found his jokes funny, one or two would have really lightened the mood.



Early in our groggy, tired attempt to pick up a decent pace, rapid footsteps startled us into grasping our weapons of choice. Gliding up the path ahead came the dog walker we’d seen the day prior. He looked like he’d been running all night as he questioned if we’d seen his dog.



Having other things on our mind, we sorrowfully apologised that we’d not, crossing paths for the last time. Maybe we should have backtracked and helped him, but we wanted out asap.



I considered telling him to be careful, but in his heightened state of panic, I doubt he’d have registered anything other than his dog’s location.



On our final descent of the trail, our once picturesque surroundings had morphed into the setting of a bad horror movie. Gone were the cheerful ambient sounds of critters, instead replaced by the filtering call of that ratcheting gale.



Still pressing on, we happened upon a camp, though no one rose to greet us. A handful of tents and a now deceased fire littered the cleared patch of woodland they’d called home. Thinking back to that family, I prayed they were just out for a morning walk, though with the scattering of supplies, my mind wandered.



Stopping for a moment to catch our breath, refuel on our leftover rationes and add another layer, I sputtered out a wheezing cough. Though we hadn’t been running, my restless body and the intense pace we attempted to maintain had taken its tole on me.



Olly almost flew out of his newly adorned coat at the sounds I croaked out, spinning to face me. That look in his eyes only filling me with another wave of dread, though soon after they stared passed me.



I had thought it was only my loud cough, mirroring that creatures’ raspy tones, but the advent of something soft and wet on my lowered right hand, had my heart beating out of my chest.



Spinning to face the adjacent threat, I was met with the panting, dirty image of a dog. Though I couldn’t fully make out its coat’s colouration, it strongly resembled the pointer that walker had passed us with, on the second day.



Caught in a moral dilemma, none of us wanted to re-tread the trail back in hopes of finding its owner, but at the same time, we couldn’t just leave it here, with what we’d seen.



Pulling a section of cord from my bag and tying it around the dog’s collar, we opted to just return to the car park and call a ranger. With the dog in toe, we resumed our eager pace.



Oh, he pulled a lot. Any rustle, small snap of a twig or even some faint sounds we couldn’t fully make out, he was yanking towards the shrubbery.

  
"Was it really a good idea to take him along?"

  
I knew Matt didn't mean it, that bitemark from when we were kids, messing around in his neighbours yard resulting in preconceived notions even twelve years later. 



We knew they were probably just some small animals making their way through the underbrush, but every shake of foliage could have hidden that stag.



Yanking harder and pulling me almost headfirst into one pine, our new companion didn’t make it easy to keep moving, especially when we hit a steeper than normal decline.



The path did split, visibly circling round the gorge, at least by my maps account. The only downside was that there were no trail marking for that portion. With our estimates putting the tour at an extra thirty-to-forty-minute, we opted for the more dangerous path.



Reckless as it was, we desperately just wanted out, though our fears came true. Slipping on an uneven outcrop, with the force that dog pulled, I had a spur of the moment decision to make.



Let go of the lead and take the brunt of the fall or release the cord and hope my arms could shield the impact. I chose the latter.



Leaving the dog to bound down, practically unharmed, I attempted to use my now free arms to anchor myself on the first topple. Unfortunately, with a heavy pack, I was simply praying for unbroken bones.



I don’t even remember how many times I barrelled down or for how long. Waking in a heap at the base of the gorge, the whole right side of my body was numb. My brain screamed out that I was in pain, but my nervous system lagged, though only for a moment.



Rolling over and attempting to claw myself up to my knees, a wave of excruciating pain radiated from my right wrist and knee, flooding my body and bringing me to tears. Flopping back to the floor like the wounded animal I was, Matt and Olly quickly approached.



I don’t remember what they said or even what they were doing, simply forcing myself to grit the pain and refrain from looking at the epicentre of my torment.



In hindsight at the hospital, it was clear I’d fractured my patella and broken a portion of my lower femur. Other than a sprained wrist and ankle, the scrapes were the leas o my worries.



Laying there, staring up in a trance at the swaying treetops, they must have give me something to dull the pain, because as quickly as my mind had focused on my injuries, it flicked to the barking, echoing out from my right.



As they attempted to sterilise any open wounds and bandage me up, my gaze fell on the dense foliage that now shook in contrasting intervals to the gust cutting though us.



Wrenching me up and flinging my arm over his shoulder Matt crutched me away, whilst Olly picked up the slack.



The ghostly white faces and wide expressions they wore indicating that they’d noticed it too. In our panic, the dog had either fled or chased down whatever was rustling in those woods, regardless, and as morbid as it sounds, we couldn’t have kept tabs of him with our current situation.



With my crippled knee, our pace dropped to a crawl and with the evening drawing on us faster than anticipated, we all prepared to trek through the night. As if on cue, the moment the day died those coughs arose.



Serenading us from every conceivable angle, those rustles drew closer, though what caused them never exposed its form.



Whatever was out there, maybe only a meter from us in any given direction, it could have attacked us, I mean we were sitting ducks, but it didn’t.



As the cacophony grew lounder and the impending fear of attack rose like a predator about to pounce, our salvation shone through the grove ahead.



Breaking from the treeline, that gravel path seemed to glisten like gold in the slowly emerging moonlight. Spinning to finally lay eyes on whatever had pursued us for the last three days, the forest fell silent.



No rustling, no sounds, not even the shrill chill of the wind lingered.



Maybe it was the suddenness of those sounds dissipating or the complete lack of energy we had after dragging ourselves back to the car, but the silence was almost worse.



Some deeply primal part of my brain, reminding me that, out there between the thick groves of oaks and narrowing branches of maples, there were things that scratched that pray sense, we carried back when the wilds were far more dangerous.



Pushing those guilty feelings of trespassing out of our mind and spinning gravel, we departed for the hospital.



I don't know why I even considered looking back. As if meet eyes with whatever was observing our exit would rationalise that weekend. Fortunately, my eyes stayed fix to the road, just like the others. No amount of curiosity was worth the trauma Olly replayed.



\- 



It’s coming up on our date soon, Olly’s turn to pick our location.



He’s been really shaken up, not even wanting to go hunting when I finally got the full range of motion in my leg back, though I get it with all the whitetails in our neck of the woods.



Maybe we’ll miss this year, though I know that will piss Matt off, it’s probably for the best. 

  
That's just it, life goes on and we slowly drowned in the security of our daily life.



If we ever end up giving it another go, we should really stay on the beaten path.



Damian did say, all manner of animals frequent those secluded trails.
