Alright,  a friend said that this subreddit discusses weird experiences with the same open mind as an alcoholic anonymous session. I thought I might as well share this account of the past 2 days and see what you all think.

My parents have been in the process of downsizing their house to make a move to a quote-unquote "quieter part of Idaho". And I got a call last week from my mom asking to stay for a while and help shift through the junk, with the ever-enticing promise that I now was of age to handle pieces of decor I had been eyeing since a young girl ( it only took about 20 years ). So clocking in my sick leave at work I drove across state to Idaho with my arm dangling out the car window surfing the breeze of the rushing vehicle ( I still have a sunburn all down that very arm ). Even from the outside the town in which I grew up hasn't been altered a single bit, right down to the blurred outline of a penis graffitied onto the lefthand corner of the sign that welcomed me: 

NOW ENTERING SPLINTERS.

this is the kind of town where if something of minor interest occurs its notoriety will grant it a front page on the local newspaper. So I guess it was no wonder that when the news got about that a resident of Splinters was now a child actor the magazines went crazy. I think I was 8 at the time and I still don't know what possessed Mom to get me to audition for a show that was filming nearby ( I should ask her at some point ). I think the only reason I said an eager yes to the whole thing was that I was 'intoxicated' that day by root beer floats, and of course, the prospect of being able to be something that was against Dad's expectations.

It's a suburban landscape, Splinters. Cul-de-sacs defining the border of the town like failed expeditions to escape. driving at a relatively calm pace I am reminded how Each house is a copy-and-paste version of its neighbor to such a defined exactness I could have exited my car, entered a random house blindfolded, and located the toilet by muscle memory alone. Living in a neighborhood like this you couldn't identify an address based on the house but rather those of its surroundings. That's how we'd know where to go as kids. It was never, 

" let's hang out at so-and-so address of so-and-so's home"

 but rather, 

" let's hang out at the house with the tree shaped like a sideways fart " 

and everyone would know to go to Sherman's home.  

 As my car rolls up to the old 2 story home, known not to me as 109 on 14th Bernard St but as Footprint Pavement, I see my mother's golden grey head peer through the curtains, her dull blue eyes see my car, gone 7 years pulling in. she greets me halfway up the path and wraps her short arms about,

" Charlie, it's so lovely to see you again! " she breaks free from the immersion and peers up, "You've changed so much, I thought a different person entirely stepped out of that car!"

insisting she takes the luggage I've barely even begun to carry, Mom and I meet Dad at the door. He always has this reluctant manner about him whenever near me. like it took, to be in my presence, an effort, leaving just enough strength to slouch his shoulders and bald head grumbling, 

"Welcome home, son" 

and walk back to his regular haunt in the T.V. Room. Mom showed me the room I am staying in, my old room. As I am writing here now, on a bed too small. I look around the tiny room and fail to notice any sign of age, anything amiss. the wallpaper is the same, baseballs flying through clouds on a blue background. the rug under my stained dresser is that same tone of faded blue ( I honestly believe that if I examine the carpet hard enough I can still see breadcrumbs from late-night summer snacks long ago ). Sleeping here has been difficult, mostly because of the bedframe, but also because in the back of my head is a constant worry about the surroundings about me. In a situation like this, one where you get to sort through a physical symbol of your past, it's like a burning house. Dreading the moment when the frame of better times collapses you gather as many belongings as you can before it all disappears under ash.

 On the first full day, I decided to bite the bullet and choose to go through the materials that built a child from a town called Splinters. I asked Mom where my Babybox was and she, with more emotion than I, showed me the pale blue keepsake filled with worn-out teddy bears, tiny blankets with large holes, and chunks of colored plastic chewed to obscurity. The process was swift and soon, to Mom's dismay, I had chosen only a few tokens from the box ( a cap I wore to keep my bald soft spot warm, a bell I recall being in my earliest memory, and a teddy bear that smells like spoiled food). It was easier to let go of the other things, I didn't really have as much of an attachment as mom did. I can see she still misses her little boy no matter how good she thinks she is at hiding it.

I spend the evening in Dad's garage. As though I am a stranger who arrived the other day and slept in his house, Dad doesn't know how to make anything but simply converse as we sort through ceramic pots. He talks about the past as if it's still happening today. Drill in hand, he starts the thing twice before unscrewing the shelves I once helped construct with him,

" I think Mom said there was another thing for you: fan mail, remember getting those? "

" yup " 

"Are you gonna keep them? "

I shrug, 

" Nah, I have no use "

The sound of the drill stops and a screw falls to the ground,

"Chuck, let me ask you this: what are you going to keep? "

" I don't know, stuff with actual value? "

Dad bites his lip and grumbles to his best friend, the shelf,

" Sometimes there's value in even the most broken things "

" I'm not junking everything, Dad, I'm keeping the wedding dress mom is handing down "

He throws the drill down as he finishes and uses me for balance when getting up, then patting my shoulders, he addresses his main point,

" you've got very broad shoulders, and a body built for carrying. don't make your mother carry your things "

  

The Second morning at Splinters greeted me with back pain. gently I descended the stairs as if a child once more, trying not to disturb sleeping parents, and tip-toed into the kitchen to have breakfast. There's a window in front of the sink that looks out on the street. I saw the outline of yesterday's turnouts. broken, redundant junk. I text some old friends in town about a potential get-together while I munch on toast, I haven't seen any of them in seven years. Washing my dish I wonder what they must think of me now, absolutely different in aspects I was remembered for. It's like I am a breathing example of Theseus's ship.

what was first an absent glance up turned into a full-on stare as I saw a dark green beetle car stop in front of the decor left to the curb. I believe it was a man who stepped out and paced about. He (and again I am uncertain as to the gender), had maroon overalls with a mustard yellow turtle neck tucked in (It could maybe belong to something because I sorta recognized it). Overalls appeared to be searching heavily about the junk, taking up one thing and storing it in another, and with such a frantic manner I couldn't help but think of a vulture picking apart the edible parts of roadkill. satisfied, he heaved the lot up and settled it in the front seat before performing a violent U-turn the way he came. 

Curious as to what was taken I stepped outside to examine. It took longer than necessary to find the main absentee: the Babybox and all the objects I sorted through the previous day. the man didn't even take the inviting variety of mom's possessions, it was all my stuff. Snatched up and gone, his greeting card the stretched tire marks in a pattern of stars burnt out on the road.  

The rest of the day was fairly easy, I sorted through crumbled drawings and fan mail from kids now far away from this town. All children have the same handwriting, and it's fairly charming. I toss them all into a second-hand cardboard box en route to the bin. then decided the fate of Mom's behemoth army of sofa pillows with a thumbs up or down like I was a Roman emperor deciding the fate of a gladiator. As a form of a peace offering, Dad took us that evening to a stake house we used to go to on special occasions growing up. It's most likely because of the diversity my taste buds experienced outside of Splinters but the food there didn't have the same flair as before. My disappointment must have been observable to Mom,

" is something the matter? "

I swallow, a sign the food isn't the issue but rather something else, 

" Not really, did they change recipes about here? "

Without a word, Dad cuts a small portion of my meat and samples it himself.

" No, the paper would have mentioned it... No difference between my plate and yours Chuck, maybe it is you that's changed "

Mom hisses something to Dad who, unperturbed, continues with his plate, 

" Thanks, Dad, for the report " I dryly responded. 

On returning, we saw the bins that were left out for collection had been knocked at, and one's contents spilled out on the street. through gritted teeth, Dad sighs,

" damn kids... hardly know left from right let alone the brakes "

Mom leans forward and puts a hand on his shoulder from behind his seat,

" Language, Carl"

" And would you believe it?!, its the Star-spangled one visiting us again! " Dad has his finger jabbed at the window shield. I follow the shaking digit and see a new pair of tracks to go with the mornings,

"It's alright, I can pick it up, " I say, squinting at the litter, " It looks like they only hit the Recycle "

It wasn't that daunting of a task, Mom makes sure to place all the loose articles together in sealed boxes so it won’t fling out when the garbage truck comes round. the sunset catching my attention, I paused my work to see it ride off into the night, a ruminant of a life now defined by the blurry linework of nostalgia. Ok, It's stupid I know, but there's a chunk of my past preserved here and I have to wonder if I have changed to such a degree I even hesitate to call this town my own and not someone else's. what belongs to me anymore, and what no longer does? 

Picking the last of the boxes it seems empty. flipping it upside down I see it appears to have been cut open. I rotate it to its side and see my mother's handwriting,

CHARLIE FAN-MAIL

As I have written all this it has only been a few hours since found the empty box. This and the Babybox (things I cannot Imagine having an outside use) are the only things to be taken. I am really on edge. I'll keep you all on tab if anything more happens.
