So yeah, this might sound boring to some… the most of you; but trust me: I watched a meeting of the UN today which was definitely interesting. Since I gave up my political science studies to pursue more profitable things, I made a habit of keeping track of international relations (short IR). You see, most of the stuff in political science is nice to know, but IR is like a slow paced, constant chess game. Interestingly most of the players manage to somewhat loose without a clear winner emerging. Really fascinating stuff, but especially with the current conflicts around Ukraine, Taiwan and Kashmir not good for the sleep with the threat of nuclear Armageddon and all. But I’m rambling, I wanted to tell you what I saw in the stream.

So the from time to time the UN meets and a lot of the big heads address the general assembly in order to mobilize international support for their policies. Long speeches are being held, some more boring than others, some less. But that one guy, Harald Astur, nailed his performance. He was representing a little known, but important principality; the name just slips my mind right now.

So what you need to know is, that most people in IR have a certain corset of theories through which they see the world. So called ‘Realists’ for example view it as a dynamic of capabilities, where states try to survive, either by the weak banding together or the strong sucking them into their sphere of influence. The rationale is a tad darwinist but works in a lot of cases. Or the ‘institutionalists’ arguing that peaceful and profitable coexistence is possible, given a well-thought out system of conduct. ‘Constructivists’ that believe in a dominance of ideology worldview. And so on. All explaining the world with their neat, rational deductions. Season versions of that with a healthy dose of smug righteousness and you have the UN General Assembly. 

But that one guy did not think along those lines. Instead he offered a different picture, where his principality, wait… Carcosa its called, that was the name. A picture where Carcosa, lost Carcosa is at the centre of irregular circles, winding around themselves. Sometimes intersecting at odd angles. In those circles, the we, the humans would organize. Why, he would not tell, but think about it, it just makes sense. So everything aligns with Carcosa, dim Carcosa and outside of those described circles would also be Carcosa, lost Carcosa, marking the boundaries of sensible existence. Now that I dwell on it, for being the first time at the General Assembly, it was a remarkable speech. Never seen him before. Sadly, I’m already forgetting some of the details, but what matters is the big picture. Like, this guy offers a new alternative for the current world in his speech. A lot was centred around the reign of his head of state, the so-called King in Yellow. His advent will free us humans from the inconveniences of modern life. Of course, some sacrifices must be made.

Most will die, that is true. At least death would be the closest to the description given by Him, I’m not sure if our categories even fit here. I remember being scared when I heard it the first time. The rest may suffer in exquisit agony near the shores of Carcosa, hoping to cross lake Hali. Just imagine the glory. When the cosmos opens. Away from the unimaginativeness of the current ways, the current laws of the universe, towards a new order. Or disorder. The way He worded it, both interpretations are seemingly correct. And after all, He already has ruled aeons ago. Basically, nothing will change, as change is irrelevant to The King In Yellow. He has always ruled, from time to time just unseen and he always will be ruling. The General Assembly understood this. Sure, most of them did not make it, but they expired gladly although not cleanly in acceptance of His coming. And Carcosa, Carcosa beckons. Who in his right mind would resist its heavenly call? There’s so much to see under those twin suns.

So yeah. You should really watch the video from today’s session of the UN Assembly. It will totally blow your mind.
