**PART 5:**  
  
Hey everyone… I apologize for the delay in posting. Between the events that unfolded since my last post and nosleep going dark, I just haven’t had much time (or the sanity) to type all of this out. This is my *last* post in regards to my stalker… And all of you are in for a wild ride. Bear with me as I stumble through my words. I struggled all day yesterday trying to come up with a way to make this sound… Complete? I thought that finding out who my stalker was would tie up all of the loose ends, but if anything, I feel like I’ve been left with way more questions than I started with. So, here it goes…  
  
In my last post, I mentioned speaking to my neighbors. Some of you had suspicions that it was my landlord, Jack. Others of you questioned Mrs. Kirtley’s strange reaction to me. And then there were a few that may have even had reservations about Matt or Derek. Before I get to any of that though, there was a comment that stood out to me in my last post. It was something along the lines of: “How did the apartment look when you first moved in? Was it furnished at all? If so, have you tried moving anything around to check what’s behind it?” The second I read that, my heart dropped. I felt so freaking stupid. My place did come partially furnished. Jack mentioned that the previous tenant left in a hurry. Something about a death in the family? But I guess I hadn’t thought much of it? Whoever it was, they left behind a small, trendy couch that probably came from Ikea, some house plants (that were in desperate need of water), some cleaning supplies, a mirror, a bookcase and a large abstract canvas painting.  
  
I started with the couch. It wasn’t very heavy, so I pushed it aside, wincing as I listened to it scrape the hardwood. There was no trap door under it though. Part of me was hoping I’d find something, but the other part was more relieved than anything. Then it was on to the mirror. It had been hanging up on the wall in my bedroom facing my bed. Gently, I tugged it from the wall and found… Nothing. A silent breath of relief fell from my lips again. My eyes traveled over to the large canvas painting hanging on the opposite wall in my living room. If there was anything behind that, it would only be the hallway… So, that left me with the bookcase.   
  
The bookcase was in the small office area that I used for storage of various items I still couldn’t find a home for in my apartment. Odd little vases, a plethora of trinkets, etc. The bookcase was large and solid and it was filled to the brim with all kinds of books. The tenant before me had to have been a female. I never gave any of these books very much attention when I moved in, but I couldn’t help but look over all of them now. Almost all of them were some sort of romance. I cringed when I read some of the titles on the spines. They were all so… Cheesy. It literally looked like the type of stuff you would stumble upon on Wattpad. Quickly, my attention was swept over to one book that didn’t quite fit in though. This one was old… Very old. When I pulled it out and cracked it open, dust flew back in my face and I coughed so violently that the book slipped from my grasp and plummeted to the floor. When I finally composed myself, I reached down to pick it up and nearly passed out. There on the floor… Was a neon yellow sticky note.  
  
***“If only you could just read between the lines…”***

What did that even mean? More importantly, how did my stalker know that I would even find this last sticky note? Glancing at the corner of the small, square paper, I noticed another marking. This had to be the last piece of the puzzle. Sprinting to my bedroom, I yanked open my drawer and rummaged through the collection of sticky notes I’d slowly been collecting. When I saw the three with the markings, I quickly gathered them and hurried back to the office. With steady hands, I posted all four of the sticky notes on the wall, each of them fitting together like a puzzle piece. They fit perfectly, but I was still at a loss in regards to the image that was staring back at me. Grabbing the book from the floor, I opened it up and peered at the contents. Brows knitted together in confusion, I flipped the pages until I saw a symbol that looked familiar. The second I found it, my breath faltered and my eyes widened. *“Sigil of Lucifer…” “Seal of Satan.”* My eyes skimmed over the words and upon further investigation, I completely froze. *“A sign/symbol used in ritual magic. It is used to call forth the devil.”* My heart rate quickened and my hands felt sweaty. What kind of dark stuff was this guy into?? Peering back at the bookcase, I stilled for a second when I saw something shiny gleaming from the spot I’d taken this book from. Laying the book down on the floor, I got closer to the bookcase and examined the empty spot. Where the book used to be, towards the back of the wall, was a small gold circle.   
  
Apprehensively, my hand reached out to touch it. The second my finger came into contact with it, the circle popped from the wall to reveal a handle of sorts. A mixture of curiosity and fear bubbled from within me. Gently, I tugged at the handle and was horrified when the bookcase came away from the wall like a door. This whole time… This whole time he was getting into my house through this bookcase. Matt was right. Walking into the small room, I was surprised to see that it was well lit. I don’t know why I expected it to be dark and dingy? Various bookcases lined the walls of this small room, along with a futon and a desk. My eyes darted to the odd objects that were scattered about one of the bookcases. Strange spices and herbs littered one. Another had mason jars filled with who knows what. The closer I got to them the more my heart raced. The labels on one of the jars had my name written across it. The handwriting was the same… Clutching the front of my shirt, I tried to stop myself from hyperventilating. Inside the jar was a wad of my hair. My brush had been missing for weeks… I thought I’d lost it during the move. Stumbling away from the shelf, I sat down in the chair nearest to the desk and fought to steady my breathing.   
  
The second I turned to look at the desk though, chills raced over my entire body and the intense need to panic nearly overtook me. There, on the desk, were various drawings of me. But in the center of them all was one that was more disturbing than the rest. This one depicted me tied down to a large stone, the same symbol from the sticky notes carved into my flesh. Small, maniacal giggles left my throat when I finally realized what everything meant… He wanted to sacrifice me because he thought I was pure! He wanted to conjure the devil! This psycho was in some kind of sick freaking cult. Pulling open the drawer under the desk, my fingers twitched when I realized what I’d found. Various sticky note pads and sharpies lined the inside of the drawer. I was experiencing so many emotions all at once, but one was slowly starting to stand out among the rest: Anger. I had nearly lost my mind and this maniac was this close the entire freaking time! 

Suddenly, I made the impulsive decision to see what was behind that door. Wrenching myself from the seat, I walked over to the door and pressed my ear up against it. No sound could be heard from the other side. The adrenaline pumping through my system was no doubt the reason I chose to actually tug that door open. The moment I did though, a dreadful feeling of nausea rose within me. Glancing around the apartment, I realized who it belonged to. This was Mrs. Kirtley’s apartment… Quietly, I explored the expanse of her living room before I heard something that nearly made me jump out of my skin. Her answering machine roared to life and a familiar voice could be heard. I stopped dead in my tracks. All of this new information hit me like a ton of bricks and I’d barely had enough time for the other realizations to sink in…  
  
“Hey grandma, this is Derek. I was just calling to let you know that I’ll be over later tonight. I promise that this girl will be the last one. We just need one more and we’ll be able to ascend.”  
  
What the… What did that even mean? My legs shook as I played his words over and over in my head. It all made sense now. That’s why she wanted to avoid me like the plague. Derek was her grandson. She knew what he was up to. Thinking back to my interaction with Derek, I couldn’t help but feel sick. Running over to her sink, I vomited so hard that I began to cry… Hysterically. Tears were streaming down my face and a mixture of vomit and drool slid down my chin. Grabbing a napkin, I wiped at my mouth. I voluntarily invited that… Monster into my house and let him use my first aid kit. Everything that he said. All of his charm and banter and sarcasm was a mask. He was acting the entire time. It was all a facade…  
  
And then I heard it. Ducking down behind the counter, I tried to steady my breathing. I prayed that it would be the lesser of the two evils that had just walked through that front door. But luck wasn’t ever on my side…  
  
“Grandma, you here? I decided to just go ahead and come on over. I figured you would be back from bingo by now anyways!”  
  
I heard him search the apartment before he realized that he was alone. I watched as he walked down the hall and over to the door I’d just walked through. In less than a second, he would turn that knob and realize that I’d left that bookcase open… He would realize that I was in on his little plan. In an attempt to stop him, I quickly reached up and grabbed the kitchen timer. Twisting it, I tossed it over the counter and into the living room.  
  
***Riiiiiiiiiing!***  
  
The shrill scream of it was enough to make him stop in his tracks and whip his head around. He was so close to opening that door, that his hand had actually twisted the knob.  
  
I heard him curse as he came stomping into the living room. He was much bigger than me and probably much stronger. I wouldn’t be able to fight him without some kind of weapon. Quickly, my eyes darted up at the knife block. I knew I had to move fast, but the fear of what I was about to do was crippling. Quickly, I scrambled to my feet and ripped one of the knives from its sheath. I turned to see that Derek was staring at me from the living room, the small timer clutched within his hands. Tossing it aside, he prowled closer to me, a wicked sort of gleam in his eye. He looked absolutely predatory. A disgustingly sinister smile stretched across his face.  
  
“I figured it was a matter of time before you realized. In fact, I was hoping you would after a little while.” Pausing, he studied me a moment before that menacing grin of his reappeared ten fold. “I like a good challenge anyways.” He whispered.  
  
With each word he spoke, he came closer and closer to me until I was cornered in the kitchen. The knife shook in my hands as I fought to hold it steady.  
  
“STOP!” I shouted at him, the fear I felt intermingling with my words. “Stay right there…”  
  
A low chuckle escaped his lips as he stalked closer. I stepped back further until my back hit the oven and there was nowhere left for me to go.  
  
“I’m warning you, Derek.”  
  
The gleam of the knife shined in the fluorescent lights of the kitchen. Sweat beaded at my brow as I watched him stare at me and then the knife. And in one quick motion, he had invaded my space and successfully disarmed me. The knife clattered to the ground and his hands quickly grabbed my own as he caged me up against the oven with his body. His huge frame towered over me. Dark, green eyes stared down at me as he spoke.  
  
“I’m not going to kill you right now, I’m just going to restrain you. But if you do decide to put up a fight-”  
  
Head butting him in the nose as hard as I could I heard a sickening crunch and a low groan. This was enough for him to release me for a moment. I tried to race from the kitchen and back towards the hallway, but it was all in vain. His arm reached out and a single hand wrapped around my arm like a snake suffocating its prey. I cried out and tried to yank myself free, but he was too strong.  
  
“Please!” I pleaded. “Please just let me go. I won’t tell Jack or-”  
  
“Shut up! Jack is just as much in on this as I am. He couldn’t care less about what I do with you. By the time we’ve sacrificed you, it won’t even matter anyways.”  
  
Shoving me against the counter, he grabbed my wrists and then rummaged in the drawer next to him. I winced in pain when I felt him zip tying them together so tightly that I was sure I would rub the skin raw if I tried to escape them.  
  
Spinning me around to face him, he tucked back a strand of my hair and almost sort of… Admired me?  
  
“You’ll make a beautiful offering. Lucifer will be pleased.”  
  
“Let. Me. Go.” I seethed between clenched teeth, my fear turning into anger once again. Spitting in his face, I watched as it landed on his bloodied nose.  
  
A quick, burning sensation bloomed across my cheek as he harshly slapped me. A small hiss of pain left my lips, but I tried to bite back the pain.  
  
“Apologize.” He demanded. “NOW.”  
  
  
Staring up at him with a defiant gleam in my eyes, I slowly shook my head.  
  
Another hard slap and I was seeing stars this time. A warm substance slowly dripped from my nose and pattered onto the floor in slow, steady drops. Tears burned at my eyes. I didn’t want to die, but I was hoping I could stall long enough that maybe I could think of a plan. But I couldn’t see any other way out of this, and that was scaring me. So… I screamed. Loudly. Hysterically. There was a plethora of emotions that flickered over his face before he slapped a hand over my mouth and silenced me - surprise, anger, annoyance and the smallest tinge of… Fear? Was he afraid that someone had heard me? *Had* someone heard me? That small inkling of hope was what propelled my next move. His hand was pressed so tightly against my mouth that it gave me an idea. Opening my mouth, I latched onto his hand with my teeth.  
  
A blood curdling howl left his mouth as he tried to retract his hand, the yanking only tearing the flesh away from his palm. Pressing my teeth in harder, I bit down until I tasted blood. A mixture of shock and rage washed over his features as he stumbled away from me. Distracted, his eyes were on the chunk of meat that was hanging off of the side of his hand, giving me the perfect opportunity to run. Sprinting towards the front door, I turned and tried my best to quickly use my tied hands to unlock it. Panic erupted into every part of me, when I saw that Derek wrapped a hand towel around his hand and he was charging in my direction. The second I swung open the door though, I was more than relieved to see Matt on the doorstep.  
  
“Anna, are you-”  
  
“It’s Derek!” I screeched, running over to his apartment door.  
  
Seeing the state that I was in, Matt quickly raced over to his door and dragged me inside. Less than a breath later, Derek was trying to shove his way in. Matt’s body pressed against the door as his hands worked to turn the lock. Loud pounding was heard as Derek beat against it relentlessly.  
  
“Hey! Hey, now! This is all just a big misunderstanding!” Derek shouted at the door.  
  
When Matt finally turned to look at me, I just about lost it. Large, hot tears cascaded down my cheeks as I cried. My lips trembled as I sucked in shaky breaths.  
  
Brows furrowed together, he slowly approached me. My body shook like a leaf as I hovered just within his living room. With a gentle hand, he guided me over to the couch and told me to sit down.  
  
“Listen.” He said gently, his brown eyes staring down at me with an indescribable amount of worry. “I’m going to call the police and we’re going to get this all straightened out.”  
  
I nodded my head in understanding, but my breaths came out shaky and ragged as I fought to calm the wave of emotions that came crashing down over me. Despite Matt and I’s awkward first meeting, I was glad to have met him. Reaching down, Matt hesitated a moment before wrapping me in his arms and hugging me tightly. He whispered to me that it was going to be okay… And every fiber of my being wanted to believe him.  
  
After Matt called 911 and explained the situation to them, they were quick to respond to the scene. Five minutes later, the apartment complex was surrounded by cop cars. Jack was taken out in handcuffs, Mrs. Kirtley still hadn’t come back from Bingo yet, but she would be next and Derek was nowhere in sight.  
  
After multiple interviews with the cops and them searching mine, Derek’s and Mrs. Kirtley’s apartments, they found all sorts of strange evidence. But there was still no sign of Derek. Seeing as I didn’t have any family to take me in, Matt was more than glad to do so. I only stayed with him all the way up until yesterday, and surprisingly, during that short time we had become good friends. We even agreed that after I moved into my new apartment complex today, that we would stay in touch. During my stay with him, I learned that he was much kinder and warmer than I’d initially thought. He was just… Struggling. His awkward interaction with me was simply due to the fact that he had lost a daughter my age about a year ago, and apparently we looked pretty similar. He said that seeing me for the first time was almost like looking at his daughter again. And that was hard. He went on to explain that despite keeping to himself, he noticed me moving in and couldn’t help but want to look out for me.  
  
“I wish I’d been able to look out for her.” His voice sounded sad and a bit… Far Away? Like he was trying to convince himself that by saving me, he had atoned for not being able to save her.  
  
Patting his shoulder I tried my best to comfort him as I stood to grab what little belongings I did have. Walking me to the door, he opened it and waved me off, telling me to call him if I needed anything.  
  
My new apartment was nice and clean and much better than the last. Against my wishes for him not to worry about it, Matt had paid for my rent for the entire year. He wanted me somewhere safe. He mentioned that being a doctor meant that he had more than enough money, and that at his age, it didn’t really mean all that much to him anyways. He didn’t have any children outside of his daughter, and his wife had passed away in a car accident when his daughter was fifteen. I told him of how my family was taken from me too, and we cried over it together. My parents were killed in a car crash as well… It was a drunk driver. So, we had become more like each other’s family than anything during my short stay at his apartment.  
  
For the first time in a long time, I felt… a little safer than before. But not completely though. Derek still hadn’t been found. Due to everything that I was going through, my work was more than willing to give me some time off to deal with everything though, but today I insisted that I come back to work. I needed to get my mind off of everything. I needed some type of normalcy.   
  
When I came in at 8 AM this morning, I was surprised to see a plain white envelope on my desk. Dragging my nail under the seam of it, I ripped off the top portion of it and peeked at the contents. Everything inside of me wanted to scream. Dropping the envelope, I watched as a sticky note slipped out and fell to the ground. Gripping the side of my desk, I started to cry hysterically. My sobbing and hyperventilating was so loud that two of my colleagues were quick to rush into my office and set me down into a chair, both of them trying to calm me.  
  
“Anna, what’s wrong?” Eliza asked, her red painted lips turned down into a frown. “Do you need to go-”  
  
“L-look.” I interrupted her, my finger pointing at the sticky note.  
  
I could hear the quiet swishing of Janice's skirt against the floor as she knelt to pick it up.  
  
“Janice, what is it?” Eliza asked, her voice wavering just the slightest.  
  
Janice’s face paled as she read the words aloud.  
  
***“Anna, who should I visit first? You or Matt.”***  
  
And then she paused, noticing the address at the bottom of the sticky note. Both of them exchanged a silent look. They knew it was mine. He knew where I worked. He knew where I lived. And he knew how to reach me.  
  
Long story short, I *know* I’ve got a stalker… And he’s *still* sending me sticky notes.
