Hey everyone a couple of things before we begin you will be entertained im certain of that at the very least. i am a terrible story teller so be patient but i feel like i need to go a bit into detail as a lot is relavant. I will edit if you feel its to detailed or has useless info. Also i have a couple of more memories/stories that are equally entertaining ill post in the future. 

i have never had a pet (parents never wanted the responsibility which i now understand). My country has a eagle and snake on th flag doesnt really regulate strays and my city doesnt really have any "free" programs to nueter/spay. 

House dimensions is only 1 bedroom, kitchen/living room and a small bathroom. I started living here as i was single and was doing my internship near here i later got a job 7 min drive away and then i got married and she moved in with me. 

Back yard dimensions are 20 feet by 20 feet. A corner has tiles there is an old couch also my landlords and a water heater (boiler) for the house. And a pretty old wood ladder. 

Now to the "good" part my house doesnt have a faucet(besides a tiny one in a cramped bathroom or space for a washer/dryer so i normally would handwash my clothes and dishes in the same washing board/fuacet in my back yard then i would hang my clothes on some clothing lines i installed which is why we would spend so much time in the backyard. 

Chapter 1: The unlucky one is born 

So when my wife moved in around the same time a cat also moved in underneath a pile of tiles my landlord kept  in a corner of the backyard and anytime we would hang clothes it would hiss at us but we just ignored it. I had a chipped plate and decided to scrape any leftovers and give it to the cat. After a couple of weeks we started to see a change in its behaviour and it would kinda smush itself onto our legs. A few weeks later we start hearing various small meows and realized it was a female cat. So boom with my great naming ability i named her gatita. She had 3 kittens one which is gonna be our main focus of this post which further establishing my naming abilities i named MADAFAKA. 

Cheetah and atrofio(atrophy) were the other 2 names of the kittens. Anyway they were hesitant at first but eventually they also started to leave their tile den but i noticed their eyes had a crust over them im no vet but i heard somewhere kittens where born with their eyes shut so i thought it was normal (first assumtion) after around 2 months they still had the crust and i read online that it should have been gatitas job to lick them clean but for some reason she wouldnt and at this point the kittens had green mucous coming out of their crust holes. IT GETS WORSE trust me its not for the faint of heart. 

I ran to the store bought baby wipes and assumed it wouldnt hurt them like babies so i gently wiped the crust off and voila they had a new set of baby blues i also did it at night so the light wouldnt hurt them. And boom they instantly became rambunctious and it was funny to see them pounce and run and be amazed. Every 2 days after that they would return to their crusty ways and id clean them away again. Around this time they had started climbing the sofa and would be scared to jump off but Madafaka was even more of a sissy and would just stay on the couch untill my wife would feel bad for him and set it on the ground, i told her to leave him alone so he learned which he eventually did anyway. Now they where even more of daredevils and would climb the LADDER and this set a series of DEVESTATING events and the downfall of madafaka. 

So in my state specifically it usually gets super hot or super cold there are no in between one day my bottled water created a lens efect in my car and melted the air duct cover. Anyway im an engineer and my wife is a teacher i work from 7 to 4 and she normaly works from 9 to 3 sometimes later. This was one of those days when i got home i was alone so i made lunch and washed the dishes up to this point they had been living off our leftovers. As i washed i heard a tiny squeel not even a meow and i kept looking for the source everyone except you guessed it MADAFAKA i searched for him and i realized he was on the roof im scared of heights but hey i jumped in that rickity old ladder and there he was i brought him back down but it was TOO LATE fate had sealed the DEAL. 

On the floor i finally noticed he was panting like a dog his eyes were buldging out if his head and he couldnt even balance i took him inside and let him rest on the cool tiles as i searched for a dropper which i only dropped a couple of drops of water on his tongue to avoid over stimulizing or something i also heard starving people can die if they eat or drink to fast. My wife finally gets there and we decide to take him to the vet, keep in mind that i am barely starting off as an engineer and dont have any savings as i was getting payed poorly and my wife would out of our pocket also pay for least fortunate students materials. 

We get to the vet and they take him to inmediate care as he was in a pretty bad state. Anyway they make me all sorts of questions and i know none of them as this is a stray. All the clinic at this point is surrounding me as to know how that poor cat was in that state. And finally they ask what the kittens name is and absolutely confident i said MADAFAKA and at that tense moment everyone bursts out laughing and so do i. She was not having it and wrote fido in the name section what a sourpuss ba dum tss. 

Anyway they keep him over night and they tell me hes probably mever gonna see normally again,  malnurished and needs special eyedrops they give him special cat food and hand me a huge bill and instructions on how to remove the gunk from his eyes. Half our savings gone but i could see my wife wanted to do it so i did. 

3 months he had to spend in my bathroom as he would bump into everything around the house with his face and hurt his eyes i presume so i set up a box with an old blanket and not agitate him only to give him his medicine and food. After 3 months i take him back to the vet they say its as good as it will get and to be happy with him like hes assuming i will take him in and hand me another bill i mean come on! Me and my wife dont like pets indoors and these 3 months where long. So we decide to release him back to the backyard he inmediatly runs to Gatita and gets a face full of paw. She no longer recognized him as hers and ignored him. It was brutal to see but tiz the way of life. Luckly he was big enough to eat dry food and we bought a bag for everyone. When it would rain everyone would huddle up under the tiles except madafaka who would sleep near the entrance. 

Chapter 2: Mating season 

Fast forward a bit and apparently female cats kick their young out after a certain amount of time and since she didnt recognize madafaka he was spared the backyard was now down to 2 cats madafaka was a teenager now. And he was now bugeyed as his peripheral vision was better than the clouded spot on his eyes in front of his pupils. Now me and my wife come from a family centered back grounds and my family lives south east 2 hours away and my inlaws live 2 hours sout west. So we normaly visit one family one weekend and the other the next. 

Anyway we leave to meet the inlaws on friday afternoon and return sunday afternoon.We go to the backyard and there is no one except madafaka who is on the couch but it seems hes struggling and i mention it to my wife who doesnt believe me he was facing away from us. Once he finally turns around and he was completly hairless on his right side and his right back leg was limp like those ufc shin breaks. you could tell that his femur was snapped and was joting out both sides of his thigh most likely he was ran over maybe (bad eyesight). Anyway the car had problems and we had no savings after fixing it and i had already given him his freebee so i wasnt willing to take out a loan. 

so i run to the fridge grab 4 posicles take the wood pieces and screw 2 together and bring in electrical tape and an old towel. I set him on the ground throw the towel over him except his leg and straddle him to avoid scratches and bites. I place both screwed pieces on each side of his thigh and jam the bones back into place as he meows/howls (mowls) its BAD i can see muscle and bone so as best i could i place tape on certain points so to avoid movement. And im done he gets up and limps away. I later did spray some blue/purple stuff in the gaping holes to help him out. 

Im sorry but i had a serious talk with my wife about putting him down, i dont own a gun and we cant pay for a shot. So the best i could come up with was bash his head in with a cinder block and put him out of his missery as after a couple of weeks he had puss in his gaping thigh holes and it would ooze out so he licked it constantly, it smelled foul. But she refused and called him a fighter but i regret not doing it as things get WORSE. 

Now during the next few weeks there would be fights over gatita and it got noisy in the backyard but we ingored the best we could, madafaka would be scared and you could see him pace around trying to avoid them aswell. It was 3 male cats viejito (old man), pantera(black gorgeous cat) and the alpha padre( father). Father was king and next in line was viejito but he was pent up as father had dibs on gatita. 

So one of madafakas thigh holes had closed but the other couldnt as his femur still had a piece of bone joting out and would reopen if there was movement. So at night we heard a strange howling sound and as you guessed by now viejito was so pent up he would snatch madafaka by the scruff of his neck which would make him go limp and the absolutly destroy him. My wife would then run out with a broom and shoo him away but as soon as she closed the door he would return to annihalate madafaka. He would learn that if he meowed enough at the door my wife would shoo viejito but it was to no avail as she would eventually get tired and viejito would have his way with him. 

Viejito also learned that since madafaka would go limp he could drag him to the opposite corner of the backyard and could go all out as my wife was sick of trying and i would laugh at him as at this point i considered he was super unlucky im awfull i know. Anyway the draging would also scrape his bone on thr ground and open his wound up since all the Movement.


Chapter 3: Butter and a short lived happiness 

So i felt bad and grabbed the towel and straddled him again this time with a pair of pliers and in one slick move removed the femur bone joting from his knee and it offered absolutley no resistance it was like butter i then removed his makeshift support and it had worked he could run jump and walk like normal! Granted he was still getting all of viejitos love but with some time to heal he might be able to run away. 

And so the mating season passed gatita had her second batch of kittens mierdin(shitter) and viejon(oldy) my wife thought it looked the same as viejito. And as it rained one day gatita, madafaka and his 3 younger siblings finally slept together in the tiles to keep warm. While growing up he would babysit them and gatita would leave to party to not be seen in a good couple of hours and he was the one to lick their crusty eyes. But when dinner came around even his younger siblings would push/scare madafaka and he would be the last to eat. Some time passed and gatita also kicked her new batch out madafaka was still allowed to remain. 

Another season of mating came around and same scenario viejito had returned to aliviate his stress, but the howling had stopped something in madafaka changed and i noticed it just didnt know to what extent and i lost my job in the pandemic while all this was happening so i finally got a call at another company at a different state and moved to test the waters before my wife left with me. 

I didnt like the new city so i was looking to come back to the previous city so i asked for 2 months of home office to visit my wife and they approved it. At this point i met the new kittens and they were not fond of me until after a certain amount of time this was the 3rd batch soruyo(blacky)  and palomo(white) and piru(wien) and lin(ner) they were twins and together they were wienner,  madafaka no longer helped gatita and he would fight back. Now during this time i got another job and moved to a different country around 8 times the pay and inmediatly accepted. 

My wife paused her career and visited her family for around 2 weeks she left the cat food outside and then for holidays i went back to visit her. She told me how she finally wanted to officially own a cat since she fell in love with wien and we headed back to the house. In the drive way madafaka was laying down on a small patch of grass but would not look at us and his meow was wierd at best. She picked him up and mentioned he was shaking. We opened the backyard door and i hear her yelp awww wien! I went to check and he was dead he had his hide twisted in a sick corkscrew kinda unnatural way and i mentioned to my wife that i could only suspect the neighbor as it looked unnatural especialy since it didnt even smell. Well here comes MADAFAKA and takes a huge bite out of wiens remains and i realize there are no more cats only madafaka and soruyo. They had CANNABILIZED their own brother. So she gets sad we get the things we came for and go back to her parents house. 

We had bought some more food and left it out but would return 1 week later. And we finally saw madafaka lifeless in our neighbors yard. And soruyo nowhere to be seen and our backyard empty. And twas the TAIL ba dum tss OF MADAFAKA THE UNLUCKIEST CAT. 

Something i forgot to mention was that i believe the eye crust thing was gatitas genes as they all had that happen and soruyo was even born without eyes.
