I’ve spent the last six months scrubbing my skin with bleach until it bled, trying to wash away the memories of the screams and corpses. Someone has to know what actually happened in those woods—the truth that the police reports don’t say.

I will forever be haunted by my own cowardice. I will spend every night for the rest of my life seeing those geometric shadows and hearing the wet, rhythmic *thlupp* of footsteps that didn't have bones to guide them.

To David, Emma, and Mark: I am so sorry. I’m sorry I looked at the hives instead of your faces. I’m sorry I ran when you needed me. I hope this story acts as a warning, a perimeter, a barrier.

Because once you see the pattern in the bark—once you notice the trees are breathing through a thousand tiny, weeping pores—it’s already too late. You aren't a guest in those woods anymore.

You’re the soil.

It all starts with us being the usual stupid college kids. Spring break rolled around and we wanted to go have some fun on a lake. David's uncle owned a cabin out in some back water place. It was a long drive for us. The four of us jam packed into Emma’s little sedan. But whatever, It was time to get shit faced at a cabin, away from the busy world. David was driving, Emma and Mark kept making out in the back seat.

“Will you two cut that shit out? Fucking nasty” David harped from the driver seat.

“Come on David, what’s the big deal?” Mark said as he pulled his mouth away from Emma.

“Guys, Look, we're getting close. Can you just save it for later” I chimed in, simply not to hear more arguing.

“Whatever Andy, you’re just jealous your girl didn’t want to come with” Emma piped real quick back at me with a smirk.

“Whatever, so David, what's up with this cabin anyway?” I look over to him as I roll my eyes at Emma. “How come you never brought us out here before”

“My uncle said never to go to the cabin, he never said anything more. Just told us to stay far away” David says calmly “But since he passed away, I got the key” David says with a greedy smile.

“Well damn dude, no respect for your uncle huh?” Mark speaks up

“Nah, screw that guy” David said with malice “He was batshit crazy”

“Are the woods dangerous or something?” I asked 

“Hell no, I think my uncle was just lost in the head or something. If it was dangerous, why would he build a cabin out there anyway” David replies.

“Fair point” Mark says back “As long as there is room for myself and Emma” he winks

“You guys are gross” I say without looking behind me.

The drive took us through one of those real hick, backwater, towns. Where everything is rusted and looks like it was built fifty years ago. But we drove right through and into a dirt road leading into the woods. It felt like another hour before we finally reached the cabin. I looked straight out of a horror movie. 

“Is this really it Dave?” Mark said with a disapproving glare.

“Well yeah, it’s a cabin in the woods, not the damn Marriotte.” David snaps back quick

“At least we can get hammered out here without anyone calling the cops.” Emma said rubbing her hand on Marks shoulder

I looked at my phone, no signal, of course. “Well, I guess we should unpack and get set for the night”. I say.

Everyone nodded in agreement as we unloaded our bags, and most importantly the beer. Emma of course did nothing, making Mark do all her heavy lifting. It only took a bit before the car was unloaded and we were ready to start a drunken bender. The cabin was a lot nicer inside then it was on the outside.

“Damn David, this place aint bad. So weird your uncle never let anyone out here” I say as I make some food. 

“Like I said he was crazy” David said with cold detachment.

“Come on you damn losers, lets get a fire going and the beer drinking” Emma says with a laugh

“Alright, alright” David stretches “Sun will be going down soon anyway”.

“I can give you a hand” Mark steps up and goes outside with David, leaving me alone with Emma.

“So Andy, how come your girlfriend didn’t want to come? She’s fake isn’t she” Emma smirks

“Very funny Emma, no, she picked up extra studies that go over spring break” I say

“NERD!” Emma yells as she slaps my back

I just chuckle at her before stepping out to join the rest. 

Time passed quickly, the fire was roaring and everyone was drinking their hearts out. Well, everyone but me. I wasn’t in the mood for drinking. Mainly because as soon as the sun set, I couldn’t shake this feeling in my chest. I realized that in the last few hours, I haven’t seen or even heard a single animal. The woods around the cabin were so brutally calm, other than the three idiots I was with. I looked over to my friends. Emma and Mark were poorly dancing, David was slamming back a beer while mocking them. But, I couldn’t shake this deep seated pool forming in my gut.

“What’s got you so down dude? Need a beer?” Mark sits next to me out of breath from dancing.

“No, I’m good. I just realized I haven’t seen a single squirrel or anything.” I say

“And? We make a lot of noise. Probably spooked everything away” Mark says with a shrug.

“No, it’s something heavier than that. Like we stumbled somewhere that they don’t live” I say, letting out more worry than I even knew I had.

“Stop being a pussy dude” Mark says as he punches my shoulder.”Just slam back a beer or two, it will help you feel better” 

Before I could retort, I saw it on Mark’s shoulder. At first, I thought it was just a clump of wet forest mulch that had fallen from the canopy. Then, it *unfolded*.

"Mark, don't move," I whispered, my stomach doing a slow, sick roll.

The thing was the size of a plum, but it lacked a solid shell. Its body was a translucent, bruised purple, like a hematoma given legs. But it wasn't the color that made my throat tighten—it was the texture. The creature's back wasn't smooth; it was a dense, vibrating cluster of open pores. Each hole was perfectly circular, rimmed with a pale, crusty white film. They flexed slightly as if the bug were breathing through a hundred tiny, open sores.

"What? Is it a spider?" Mark started to reach up.

"No! Stay still."

I leaned in, and the smell hit me—sweet, like rotting peaches and old copper. The bug’s legs weren't hooked; they were tipped with tiny, fleshy suckers that seemed to fuse with the fabric of his flannel shirt. As I watched, the *"honeycomb"* on its back began to dilate.

The creature didn't have a head in the traditional sense. It just had a vertical slit that peeled back to reveal a ring of serrated, concentric teeth. It didn't just bite him; it *latched*. Right onto the side of his neck.

“Holy shit” Mark yelps out as he grabs the bug. He had to rip it out, I could see his skin stretch as the bug did its best to hold on. But Mark was able to tear it off, with a small squirt of blood. He just threw it into the fire. “Fucking bitch that hurt” Mark said rubbing the welt on his neck.

“Who's the pussy now Mark?” David said “It was just a bug”

“Dude that was no normal bug, look at this welt on my neck!” Mark shows the bruised red mark on his neck, about the size of a nickel.

“Whatever you big baby” David replies

Everyone goes back to drinking and partying. But, I couldn't stop watching Mark. He kept itching his bite. It was turning a dark purple, he was bruising it more. I was worried about him, and that bug. I really didn’t want one to bite me. Emma sits down next to me.

“Look at those idiots,” she says, sipping her beer.

David and Mark were slow dancing

“Yeah, they are special,” I say, trying to hide my worries.

“Come on Andy, have some fun with us” She says with a kind smile.

I said nothing and walked from the fire to the tree line. I needed some cool air. The firelight behind me was a warm, flickering hum, but it felt miles away the moment I stepped into the shadow of the pines. The air here was different—heavy and stagnant, with a cloying scent that reminded me of wet cardboard and old meat.. But when I looked into the woods, one of the trees looked weird in the darkness. I was captivated trying to think of what the tree looks like in the light. I knew it was just the shadows being weird, but it felt so off. Like the tree had a weird bush growing on it.

I blinked, waiting for my pupils to dilate, for the "bush" to resolve into a cluster of mistletoe or a burl. But the texture was too uniform. Behind me I heard a scream, I jolted around to see Mark chasing Emma with a frog.

“Of course” I thought to myself and turned back around. The shape was gone. “What the hell” I said to myself. “Must just be this moonless night.” I worked my way back to the fire. Everyone had calmed down. Mark was still scratching at the welt, Emma was trying to make a smore, David was pounding another beer. David stood up and walked past everyone.

“Gotta go drain the old snake” He said with a terrible southern accent as he walked a spot in the trees.

“Mark your neck looks like shit dude” I said as nicely as possible

“Yeah, it fucking itches” He replied.

“Here babe, lets go inside and clean it up” Emma says leading Mark to the cabin.

I just enjoyed the peace to myself. I love them, but it can be a handful. Then a realization crashes into me, I turn around. No David. I quickly moved to where I thought he was at and yelled out for him.

“David, this shit is not funny man” No response

“David come on man” still nothing, just the echo of my voice from the silent trees

“David, where the hell are you!” my voice cracking with fear

“Andy what are you yelling at?” Mark and Emma come out, Mark has a bandage on his neck.

“It’s David, I think his drunk ass wondered into the woods” I say concerned

“Well shit, lets go look for him” Mark says letting out a sigh

“I’m guessing he passed out somewhere” Emma says

We pull out our phones for flashlights as we comb through the trees while calling out his name.

“David’ nothing, “Come on David” still nothing. We walked for what felt like hours.

“He must have wandered somewhere around here” Mark says nonchalantly.

I look back realizing we can't see the light from the fire anymore. But before I could speak up we all heard it. A scream, a cry for help.

We ran toward it as quickly as we could. There we saw him, David. Laid out under a tree. We moved our lights on him. Emma vomited immediately. Mark and I just froze.

David was no longer a person; he had become a terrestrial reef.

Something hadn't just killed him; it had repurposed him. His chest cavity had been forced open, the ribs pulled back like the shutters of a derelict house, but there was no blood left to spill. Instead, his torso was a thriving, porous landscape. Thousands of tiny, hexagonal apertures had been bored directly into his muscle tissue—perfect, geometric pits that pulsed with a faint, sickly heat.

The sight triggered a primal, skin-crawling revulsion. Every inch of his exposed thighs and neck was encrusted with clusters of pale, waxen bulbs, each the size of a marble. They weren't smooth; they were honeycombed with deep, dark pores.

Inside those pores, things were moving.

A frantic, liquid shimmering flickered beneath the surface of the bulbs. As I watched, paralyzed, one of the larger clusters on David’s throat began to weep a thick, translucent amber fluid. The surface tension of a single pore snapped, and a dark, multi-jointed leg—thin as a hair—twitched out from the hole. Then another. Then a dozen more. It was the same bug that bit Mark, just so many more.

The sound was the worst part: a dry, papery rattling coming from inside David's lungs, as if his very breath had been replaced by a million vibrating wings. The skin around the holes didn't bruise; it simply turned a translucent, parchment-yellow, stretching until it was thin enough to see the writhing mass of larvae packed into the *"hive"* of his collarbone. David’s jaw hung slack, and as his head tilted back, the flashlight revealed his tongue—now a bloated, perforated husk, every tiny hole teeming with those grotesque larvae.

“Holy fucking hell” Mark manages to get out.

“Oh my God, he is still alive” I say outload, realizing David was trying to stretch his hand out to us.

“We have to get the hell out of here” Mark yells

“We can’t just leave him!” Emma shouts back

“Fuck David, look at him!” Mark shouts.

The forest went deathly still, the kind of silence that feels like it's pressing against your eardrums. Then, the rhythm started.

*Thlupp. CRACK. Shhh-thump.*

It was the sound of footsteps, but there was no bone in the strike, no dry snap of a heel hitting solid earth. It was heavy—impossibly heavy—but it sounded wet. It was the sound of a hundred-pound bag of raw meat being dropped into a swamp, over and over again.

*Thlupp. Thlupp. Thlupp.*

Each footfall had a secondary sound: a sickening, adhesive suction. It was the noise of boots being pulled out of deep, thick clay, but louder—the sound of skin peeling away from a surface it had fused with. It was the "running" of something that didn't have solid feet.

“We need to run, now!” I shout. Mark grabs Emma by her hand and we take off sprinting into the woods. The sound of whatever it was chasing us was getting louder. I could hear it moving with horrifying grace as it slips between the trees. Then, Emma tripped. Mark and I both turn around.

“Emma!” Mark rushed over to her.

I didn’t move, I don’t know why. I just watched. In a split moment while Mark was trying to lift Emma up. He was gone, whatever it was snatched him and drug him off into the darkness. His screaming only lasted a few seconds.

Emma couldn’t stop crying. “Emma come on, we can still get out of here.” I say reaching for her.

“You still have the keys to the car right?” I say frantically. She only manages a soft whimper as she takes them from her pocket and hands them to me.

“Come on Emma, lets get the fuck out of here” I lifted her up, holding her head close to me. Not to comfort her, but to hide her sobbing. I didn’t hear any movement. It must be transforming Mark right now, the same way it did to David. 

We tried walking back to the cabin. We didn’t see the drop off, it wasn’t a deep ditch, but it was deep enough that Emma broke her ankle. She screamed out in pain, I could see the bone sticking out. Then the same sound. 

*Thlupp. CRACK. Shhh-thump.*

I didn't think. I didn't weigh the years of friendship or the promises we’d made. The moment that heavy, thumping stride entered the perimeter of my vision—a hulking shadow that looked like a man-shaped hive—my lizard brain took control.

"Wait! Help me! Please don't—" Emma’s voice was a jagged spike in the dark, but I was already a dozen yards away, my lungs screaming as I sucked in the cold, thick air. I didn't look back, but my ears betrayed me. I heard the squelch of the creature’s impact. I heard the sound of her plea being cut short, replaced by a wet, bubbling gurgle—the sound of someone trying to scream through a throat that had just been separated. There was a sound like a wet sheet tearing, followed by the frantic, high-pitched skitter of a thousand tiny legs.

I burst into the clearing where the cabin stood, my eyes searching for the orange glow of the campfire—the only thing that felt "right" in this world.

But the light was gone.

The fire didn't just burn out; it had been violated. Someone—or something—had stomped it into the dirt with a singular, violent purpose. I didn’t waste a moment, I sprinted straight to the car.

I scrambled into the driver’s seat, my fingers slick with cold sweat as I fumbled the key into the ignition. The engine turned over with a violent roar, and as the high beams cut through the suffocating black, the world turned into a nightmare of overexposed white and deep, cavernous shadows.

There, standing in the middle of the dirt track, was the source of the muddy thuds.

It was a staggering, asymmetrical tower of translucent, weeping meat. It didn't have a skeleton; it had a scaffolding of chitinous, insectoid legs—dozens of them, thin as needles and black as oil—thrusting out from a central trunk of human torsos that had been fused together like melted wax. The creature’s skin was a shimmering, violet bruise, stretched so thin I could see the frantic, churning motion of millions of larvae pulsing beneath the surface.

But the center of the mass—the "head"—was what stopped my heart.

The creature’s "mouth" wasn't a jaw; it was a massive, circular vent of pulsating pores, a trypophobic hive that had distended to the size of a manhole cover. Anchored deep within that ring of vibrating, toothy holes was Emma.

Her head wasn't just being carried; it was being integrated. Her neck had been elongated into a cord of raw, stringy muscle that disappeared into the creature’s throat. Her face was tilted toward me, her skin the color of wet parchment and perforated with that same horrific, geometric pattern.

As the light hit her, her dead eyes rolled in their sockets, and her mouth—now filled with a cluster of pale, writhing bulbs—opened as if to scream. No sound came out but a wet, whistling sigh from the monster’s pores.

I slammed the car into gear, the tires screaming as they tore into the gravel. As I surged forward, the creature didn't move. It just stood there, its thousand-holed body exhaling a thick, amber mist that coated my windshield like grease. I pushed the gas pedal into the floorboards, the steering wheel shaking in my hands, but even as I flew past, I couldn't unsee the way Emma’s hair was being woven into the creature’s porous skin, becoming part of the hive.

I didn't look back. I couldn't. I just kept driving, the rhythmic *thump-thump* of the tires on the road sounding far too much like those muddy, suctioned footsteps following me home.

The detectives called it "survivor’s guilt." They looked at my shaking hands and the way I scrubbed my skin until it bled and saw a boy who had watched his friends die to a "local bear population." I let them believe it. I told them we got separated in the dark, that I heard screams but saw nothing. I lied because if I told them the truth—about the geometry, the weeping pores, and the way Emma’s voice sounded like a vibrating reed—they would lock me in a ward.

And in a ward, I couldn't control the environment.

Now, my life is measured in liters of bleach and the harsh, antiseptic sting of 99% isopropyl alcohol. I live in a world of surfaces. I don't see a tabletop; I see a landscape of microscopic fissures where things could hide. I don’t see a person; I see a walking vessel of warm, porous meat.

I am so sorry everyone. I wish I could have saved you all.
