When I was little, I first learned the rule that no one was to leave their bedrooms after 7:00 PM. 

I didn’t know why, but no one told me since I was only 4. I assumed that they would tell me when I was older, but they didn’t. 

I asked every single night, but they never answered. 

When holidays came around, we still had to follow the rule. Our parents set out gifts on Christmas Eve, and we never went trick-or-treating because it started at 8:00 in our neighborhood.

If we left the house before 7:00, and it was after 7:00 while we were still out, we weren’t allowed back in the house until after 7:00 in the morning. 

Today was my 17th birthday, and curiosity got the best of me. 

I waited until my parents and my little brother were asleep, and then I did it. 

I opened the fucking door. My bedroom door. 

It made a soft creek, but it didn’t wake anyone up. 

‘What the hell?’ I thought. ‘Why were we trapped in our rooms for all these damn years. There’s nothing here!’

My thoughts were quickly cut off by the soft sound of footsteps downstairs.

I jumped back, and I hit my hand against the wall, and it made a loud bang. It didn’t wake anyone, but the footsteps immediately stopped. ‘Oh shit!’ I thought. I ran into my room and slammed the door. 

8:59 

The clock hit 9:00, and then it started. Something was scratching at my door, and it wouldn’t stop. “MOM!” I yelled. “DAD!” 

Nothing. 

Tears descended from my eyes, and then they turned into sobs. 

6:29 

I didn’t know how this wasn’t waking anyone up. The scratching was extremely loud, and so were my sobs. I had screamed names, and pure screams, multiple times, but no. Now it’s just banging.

6:58

It’s almost over, from what I know. Inhuman screeches have came now, and I don’t know what to do. 

7:00 

It’s finally over. Thank god it’s over. I opened my bedroom door, but there stood a mangled human with bird talons. It just stood there, and then my parents bedroom door swung open. My father was in his night robe. With a cross in his hand, he yelled, “BY THE POWER OF CHRIST, I CONDEMN YOU EVIL DEMON.” It screeched, but then collapsed. It disappeared THROUGH the floor. “What.. the fuck,” I said. “WE WARNED YOU!” my mom screamed. “NOW HE’LL DO EVERYTHING TO KILL YOU!” my dad yelled. “Can someone tell me what the fuck is going on?” I asked. 

“This house is cursed, and that demon will kill anyone it can, but only during the night,” my mom said. “Now, you can never leave your room while you are here,” my dad said. “You think this is a sick joke?” I asked. “All these years, for a sick joke. Ruining holidays, and our life! I’m returning to my normal life!” “Wait!” My dad yelled. But it was too late. And now I write this, as my body is now mangled and my feet are cut into talons. I must tell you something, reader. As you read this, I am here, and PLEASE come downstairs after 7:00 PM. PLEASE.
