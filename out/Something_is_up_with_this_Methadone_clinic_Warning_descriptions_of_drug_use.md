All methadone clinics smell like candy shops.  The smell of that sweet pink drug seeps into the ground.  That was the first thing that got my alarm bells ringing.  I had just blown into Pittsfield, my time in Vermont cut short by a debt collector who was comfortable using a tire iron. I rolled up to the local clinic early to establish myself before I got too sick to wait.  This place smelled like a hospital, and it was spotless. Fresh white paint on the old brick building, no tags or street art telling you where to buy or who to buy from. Even the brown standing ash trays were clean. 

I scratched the barely scabbed sore on my arm releasing a little yellow brown puss.  A leftover from making do without my rig on the way here.  First, I get my medicine, then I go sleep it off in the ER.  But this place was giving me the creeps.  I had to walk through protestors like this was an abortion clinic.  Maybe they do both? Nobody gets up at 6am on a Tuesday to protest the poor mopes who need this poison.

Then there were the lines.  There was a long one wrapping around the building.   That line smoked like a chimney and was full of unfortunates just like me, a familiar sight.  But through the clean storefront style windows, what had this place been before, a gym?  I could see other lines.  Lines that wove around stanchions with blue nylon ropes stretched tight.  There were three of them, quickly moving to the nurses who manned the windows.  Above each window was the large sculpture of a coin.  Quarter, dime, nickel.  There were fifteen people in the quarter line and less than ten in the dime.  The nurse in the nickel line sat back in her office chair doing her nails. 

My stomach gurgled and a cramp hit me like a truck.  I had been bound up for three days, but the sickness will make you loose.  I needed to get established.  But this was a new city.  When you wait for methadone your line buddies can make all the difference.  I clenched up and leaned on the dumpster of the nearby Donut shop.  It didn’t take long before my guy came along.  Dog tags, four poster cane with tennis balls on the feet, and a Jesus saves t-shirt with food stains.  He joined the long outdoor line and used that cane to tap the guy ahead of him.  They shared a playful round of fake punching then one of them broke out a flask.  He wouldn’t give me any trouble.  I hurried into line behind him, only shuffling a little.  I had the sweats now, the chills were coming.  I hugged myself tight clutching my hoodie against my skin.

The guy with the cane noticed me right away. “You hurting son?”  He was thirty years older than me, gray and thinning on top.  He grabbed a pack of parliaments from his pocket and darted one forward.  I leaned into his lighter against the breeze.  The thick smoke filled me easing a little of what I was going through. People don’t know that junkies are generous. We didn’t end up in the gutter by being greedy.

“Thanks man.”  I muttered flashing a smile and hating the shake in my voice.  Our line was hardly moving.  I stared through the windows.  Every so often someone from the outside line would break off and join one of the fast-moving indoor ones.

“You new?”  Jesus saves guy walked with a limp, maybe a prosthetic.  Sempre FI tattoo fading on his forearm.

“New here, been on some kind of clinic for the last ten years. Never seen anything like this.”

“Yeah, that copies.”  In a less violent life he could have grown a beard and played Santa Claus for his kids, ” It’s new here too.  Couple months ago they started a government trial program.  Trust me son, you’re in the right line.” In the time it took us to have this exchange two people in the dime line were taken in. We hadn’t moved a step.

“You should tell him about the coins Jimmy.”  This was from the man with the flask, scars on his cheeks and nose spoke of a history of meth.

“He’s in the right line Mack.”

“I want to know, what’s with this place?”

Jimmy sighed and offered me another parliament.  “The quarter line, you go there, they dose you with methadone no questions asked, you don’t even need an ID.  High dose.  You get a breakfast sandwich and you can sit in this big waiting room with a wide screen TV until you’re ready to leave.”

“Yeah and the nurse blows me.”  I spat on the ground and exhaled smoke.

“Honest son, It’s a new program.  You got to sign some forms but they don’t even check your id.”

I scanned my two new friends for any hint they were putting me on.  If it was a gag they were committed.  I can play along.  “And the dime?”

“And the dime?”  Mack mimicked the quaver in my voice, “He’s hurting Jimmy.”

“Federally funded shooting room. You get clean needles, pharm grade morphine and a nurse to Narcan you if you go too far.  They got recliners in there in little cubicles.  When you leave you get 50 bucks and a voucher for a night in hotel down the way.

“And a little baggy of toiletries, so you can shave and brush your teeth.”  Mack crowed, “Don’t forget the little baggy of toiletries.”

“Yeah, name brand shit like Colgate too, not dollar store shit.”  Jimmy mumbled.

“I don’t get the joke-“  The anger that I got from my father started welling up. Jimmy shrugged and pointed.  A guy a couple years younger than me busted out of the metal double doors of the clinic and put his arms up smiling.  Two or three people in the snaking line cheered.  He high fived a woman who was old enough to be his mother.  In his hand he had a clear baggy full of toiletries including Colgate toothpaste.

“No agency lets you shoot up and gives you junk.” I protested.

“New administration new rules.”  

“What about nickel? That nurse is just sitting there.” I knew I sounded pathetic.  Mack caught my eye and sneered.

“Another shooting room.  A week in the hotel, 200 bucks, and you get to see a social worker.  She can set you up on food stamps get you hooked up with insurance, HUD stuff, even get you in to see the doctor if you need meds filled.”

“There's got to be a catch…”

“It’s all in the numbers.”  Mac was having a good time.

“Yeah, there’s a catch.  That’s why we got them Christian protestors.  It’s all about saving money, yeah?”

“That’s right man, sometimes you don’t come back.  So, me and Jimmy we stick to the long line.”

“Quarter, like 25.  One out of 25 of those methadone doses is a sedative mixed with some sort of nerve stuff.  Painless, you just go to sleep.” For a moment Jimmy looked angry and I could see him in fatigues, a young man in some arid desert place.  A woman came out of the clinic holding another one of the baggies, grinning.  Understanding washed over me.

“That’s illegal.”  I couldn’t take my eye off the nickel nurse just sitting there.

“You don’t listen to the news huh?  New administration is trying to solve the fentanyl mess. Some scientists figure this kind of a program can save sates millions. Turns out the drugs aren’t the problem, we are” Mac took another pull from his flask and gestured to the long line of peers.

“So, the nickel line?”

“One out of five. They cremate them in the basement.”  Jimmy put his warm calloused hand on my shoulder.  For a moment my shaking stopped.  “You’re in the right line son.”

I was through the door before my feet knew what they were moving.  The nickel nurse saw me coming and put down her emery board.  On the wall beside there was a sign that listed the perks Jimmy and Mack had talked about. A huge warning with a skull and crossbones dominated the sign, English and Spanish.  “Un de cada cinco”. How long had it been since I spent a whole week under a roof, in a private room. I bet the hotel has cable.  The nurse smiled a sad smile and held out some papers for me to sign. Things were looking up.
