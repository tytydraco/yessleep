“Stream of consciousness,” she said, like it was the key to enlightenment.

“So like, just say whatever comes to mind and… record it?”

I kept picking at my shirt that day, and the hole mocks me by getting larger every time I do laundry.

“Precisely.”

Dr. Deckar is always straightforward with me, even when I have her explain like I’m five more often than not and usually skip completing my therapy ‘homework’ in favor of playing video games. This time, however, she didn’t let me off the hook for the one assignment she said I needed most- journaling. And since I can’t manage to put pen to paper, I’ve opted instead to audio journal whatever pops into my head, with the caveat that it has to be about me. I hope you’re proud, Dr. D., that I skipped Skyrim for this.

So, here goes-

“Snow is falling outside. Not softly, but in big, glossy chunks the size of playing cards. They tap at the window like nails, a sound that spooked me at first but has since become cozy like rainfall.

Hailing from the sunshine state, my first encounters with snow were always predicated by a sense of awe. I was working a new job when the weather reported 3 inches coming in, and rushed outside after a coworker told me it had begun. That was a delicate flurry that ended far too soon- hardly enough to make a proper snowman, but just enough to teach me about black ice.

This snowfall is supposed to be different. Deeper, more like a blizzard than anything I’ve seen and bigger than any the area has had in the last 20 years. Some news stations said 12”, with others saying 24” just a few hours later. What’s for certain is that I am ready to make a real snowman, even if I have to wade through two feet of powder to do it.

There it is again- the pitter patter, tap tap tap against my window. Something between the sound of rain and small pebbles, insistent and chaotic.

I never thought snow would have a sound, you know? Out of all the things my new neighbors told me to expect, from the salted ground to the boots I’d need, nobody once thought to mention the sound it makes against the windows when it really comes down. Or how after a few minutes of that, absolute silence reigns and everything is still. The wind gusts here and there, until the whole cycle starts again- tap tap tap, wind, then silence.

Speaking of neighbors, Jeremy came by today to let me know he’d be checking in after the storm passes through. He also brought that mint tea he was telling me about! It’s nice to know someone is looking out for me, even if he’s occasionally a bit more flirty than I’d like. I’m still single and enjoy the independence, but even I’ll admit that the possibility of getting snowed in for a few days with just me, my thoughts and no power is a little terrifying. Luckily his apartment is just above mine, so that would make two of us stuck out here in the Catskills- three, if you count his cat Tim.

“I’m starting to get a little sleepy. Part of me wants to stay up to watch the snow but I tried that earlier and it felt… strange? Yeah, strange. Like I wasn’t supposed to be looking, and like something was looking back.

Nothing was, of course. The lawn was illuminated by the warm, amber string lights we put up in October. They’re pumpkin shaped and apparently staying because “Pumkpins are cute no matter the season,” in Jeremy’s opinion, and in this case I agree. They’re the perfect color pop in the gloom, basking the powdery grass in cozy lighting right up until the tree line absorbs it.

“I think I’ll reheat some of that tea and look at the snow one more time. Even if it’s a little spooky, it’s undeniably serene and somewhat magical. I need to lock up and close the curtains anyhow, so… hang on.

How come the snow is coming down in flurries, but the lights aren’t moving in the wind?

The trees aren’t moving, either. Weird.

Maybe the breeze is enough to carry the flakes, but not move anything else? Is that normal?

“The tapping is getting louder. It sounds like nails, or tiny stones, or like… claws against wood floors, only now it’s so loud I’m worried the window might break.

I’ve tried having tea to calm myself but, frankly, it tastes horrible. Something between cilantro and the taste of a green tea brewed too long, bitter and sharp in the mouth. He said it was really good so either he’s crazy, or this is a bad batch.

*glass breaks, wood splinters*

“What was that?”

*howling wind, snow tapping*

“Was that the window?
Oh shit, the window is broken!”

*the sound of footsteps receding*
*muffled thumps, groaning*

“Jeremy, is that you? What are you doing here?”
“Is that BLOOD?!”

*unintelligible screams*

“No no no, keep looking at me, don’t close your eyes, please Jeremy PLEASE!”

*groans, tapering into silence*
*muffled crunches, footsteps approach*

“The snow….”
*sniffles*

“Dr., the snow, it got Jeremy. It got him real bad, there’s blood everywhere and it’s… it’s sticking out of him, like glass. I don’t know what to do. The trees aren’t moving, I don’t understand. Why aren’t the trees moving?!”
 
*wind howling, snow tapping*

“Oh god, oh fuck, it’s coming for me!”

*rapid thumps, screams*
*howling wind*
*silence*
