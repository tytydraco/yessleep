Hi guys, I don’t use reddit often (or at all really, other than for some occasional browsing), so I apologise in advance for any type of formatting issues. Please understand I wouldn’t be reaching out to all of you on here if I wasn’t desperate, but I can’t deal with this anymore, and I was hoping someone here might be able to help me out.

I truly have tried everything I can think of. It’s current 3:25 AM and I am at my absolute wit’s-end listening to this grating, repetitive, loud, high-pitched blaring noise. I don’t even know where my phone is anymore. (I think I threw it across the room earlier tonight? Im pretty sure I hear it vibrating somewhere on the floor.)

Im typing this out on my computer for you all now, and I’m rushing so I’m sorry if there are any spelling mistakes. 



About 4 days ago, the government launched the first test of a new public warning system. Instead of you just receiving a text, like usual, now your phone will vibrate in a distinct pattern and make a siren-like noise to make sure you can’t miss it. The sound keeps going (it’s like 2 or 3 rhythmic bursts of noise that fade out ever so slightly at the end before booming back to its maximum volume or louder, and then starting again.) The noise and the vibrations continue until you pick your phone up and acknowledge the Emergency, which, importantly- stops the noise. 



I had seen it reported on the news that they were going to test this new system, but hadn’t seen that it was anything other than the usual text message. I don’t usually pay any attention to these things, this testing of the text Alert system happens every month or so in the summer and about every 3 weeks in the winter, and the Sirens that warn of a Nuclear Catastrophe or oncoming Natural disaster are tested every first Monday of the month at 11:00 AM sharp. 



All of this is to say I truly didn’t even give it a second thought until we were all sat in class, and suddenly, all at once, that disgusting blaring sound filled the whole classroom. 

People were taken by surprised and jumped back in their seats, looking at their phones and rushing to stop the sounds coming from them. It made me wince and clench my teeth when I heard it. 



This disruption to the class lasted around 20 minutes, as some peoples phones received the alert more than once, some peoples alerts were delayed and people were rightfully rattled at the sudden sound of  emergency sirens coming from their phones. 

After 20 minutes went by my friends and I had gotten bored of talking about it and had gone back to focusing on the lesson. All of us are struggling in physics, and wasting time talking about a new and fancy public alert system simply wasn’t as important as hopefully graduating. 



And that was it. For about a day and a half, that was the end of the story. We, the public, now knew about this alert system and we could carry now with our lives until either the next first Monday of the month, or until they decided it needed to be tested a second time.



That was until I got home that second night. 

I’d heard other peoples phones blare out that  rhythmic beat a few times during lunch in the canteen, but I’d just assumed it was their phones being slow. None of my friends mentioned it, so I didn’t either. I’d reached into my back pocket more than once to check my phone as I’d both heard and felt it vibrate in an unfamiliar manner a few times, but every time I checked there was nothing. 



That night I had gone about studying like usual.  I’d had dinner like usual. I’d taken out dog out for a walk like usual. It was like it always was and I feel stupid for not savouring it more, because now I’m frustrated to the point of crocodile-tears and I cannot stop this noise no matter what I do. There’s a screwdriver in the sink and blood on the marble countertop but I can still. Hear it.



It was like normal when I got out of the shower and it was like normal when I was scrolling through instagram when I was brushing my teeth. It was like normal when I was going through TikTok in bed and I fell asleep like normal too.

It was difficult to actually fall asleep, mostly because my dog wouldn’t stop whining periodically and circling at the foot of my bed. I assumed we were both just restless, and turned my alarm clock around to face the wall to stop myself from watching the minutes tick by slowly. This was around 00:23. 



I don’t know how long I lied there in the dark, but my dog must’ve left because I’m sure I heard the sound of claws scratch rhythmically against our hard-wood floors, and the jangling of what I assumed was his collar as he shook his coat off and padded past my room. 

I remember thinking I hadn’t felt him jump off the bed, but I just assumed that id fallen asleep for a few seconds and missed it. 

“Thats probably why I’m awake in the first place” I thought to myself.



And then my room went quiet. Completely quiet. 

I wish I could’ve enjoyed it more. It’s the quietest my room has ever been and God I would give anything and everything for it to be that quiet again. 



And then, through my closed eyelids, I saw the blue light illuminate my room suddenly. 

And then, after a seconds pause, the siren from the emergency alert system, the same one that had come from everyones phones in school, pierced right through the quietness of my room. 



The noise was so sudden and so Ear-splittngly loud it caused my eyes to snap open and for me to slam my hand into the light switch above my headboard, my fingers colliding with it and illuminating my room in the warm but harsh light of my ceiling light.



In my panic, I almost threw myself at my nightstand to reach for my phone, but the sudden change of brightness in my room meant I had my eyes squinted almost completely shut, and I accidentally knocked it onto the floor instead. I leant over my bed desperately grasping for it. I felt around the floor for a few seconds too long and once I finally got my hands on it, I pressed desperately and frantically on the “Acknowledge button”. 



And it was quiet again. 



It wasn’t until I felt my heartbeat in my temples that I realised hadn’t stayed frozen in my uncomfortable position of leaning half off my bed with my face to the floor. I braced my palm on my floor, grabbed my phone with my other hand, and pushed myself back into bed, sitting with my knees pulled closely to my chest. 



I let out a breath I hadn’t realised I was holding and waited. Looking back, I realise now that it was too quiet.  It was abnormally quiet. I couldn’t hear my dog walking around, I couldn’t hear any noise from the wind or the trees outside, I couldn’t hear anything from my parents room. 

So I sat, and I waited. 

Im not sure what I was waiting for. 



I didn’t want to touch my phone. The low, rhythmic beat and consistent droning of the siren and paired with my desperation to stop it had taken me so off-guard that it had almost pushed me into a panic attack. I felt my heart drum so strongly in my chest, it almost felt like it was moving up my throat. 



Im not sure how long I waited for, and I’m not sure why I was so nervous. Maybe it was the silence. It almost felt like there was something telling me not to move. Even with my back pressed against my headboard, and my ceiling light still on, it felt like there was someone- no, not someone, something, stood behind me. Lurking ominously, but I knew if I turned around, it wouldn’t be there. Not because there was a wall behind me, but because It did not want to be seen. 



After a while, I was simply too scared to move. I tried convincing myself this paranoia was just a result of me being awake later than usual, and the suddenness of the siren noise, and I was just scaring myself and that I had to be up for school in 5 hours and I needed to get a grip and go back to sleep. 



Slowly, I became less scared. That fear had turned to mild annoyance and I sighed in frustration. I dragged my palms across my face an forced myself to get up and go down to kitchen to have some water. I hoped it would calm me down. 



I walked out of my room, and was slow going downstairs.

I noticed that at this point, it was still insultingly quiet.

The thought crossed my mind that it felt like I was the only person on Earth. I frowned at myself. I knew thinking like that would only freak me out more. 

I gingerly stepped past my father’s toolkit resting at the bottom of the stairs, it was placed in an awkward position where, if you weren’t looking where you were going, it would’ve been easy to catch the textured black rubber along its corner and send it straight against the floor with a loud ‘smack’. Making noise was something I desperately wanted to avoid. 



I dragged a glass out of the cupboard and gently turned on the faucet so that it was a little more than a steady stream of water that started filling up and weighing down the cup. Even the sound of the sink running was enough to make my shoulders tense. I could’ve turned it to run with a higher pressure, I could’ve filled the glass quicker, but that would’ve made it louder. Something was telling I had to be quiet. 



Once it was finally it full, I turned it off. 

And then, the silence was cut suddenly, sharply, rudely, Two rhythmic blares, a low drone, another two rhythmic blares, a low drone. The phone vibrated twice against whatever surface it was on, then it paused, then twice again. It wasn’t in the same rhythm of the sound of the siren, so there was absolutely no break from the noise. Just constant noise from somewhere behind me.

The noise made me jump so violently the glass slipped straight through my fingers and onto the floor. I heard it shatter against the floor but I didnt look to see where. 

It was on the counter behind me. Had I bought it downstairs with me? I was positive id left it upstairs on my bed. Would I ever place my phone so perfectly on the counter like that? When have I ever placed my phone perfectly straight and face-up on the counter like that? 



The noise was starting to blend together in a way I cant describe in words. You had to be there, I can’t explain it. It was getting louder. It was getting louder and louder and I winced and physically recoiled from it. After I recognised what was happening, I started to move to the phone. The noise was so horribly anxiety inducing that it had sent me basically into a frenzy. I snatched my phone off the countertop, I tried to acknowledge it; I tried to turn it off, but i couldn’t. 

The button was there, I was pressing it, the text on the screen explaining it was a test, that no action needed to be taken faded off the screen, but the noise didn’t stop. 



I paused and tried to think against the noise, against my racing heart. Was It actually coming from my phone? Is this even my phone? When did I bring it downstairs? I don’t even think I walked past this counter hone I came in; I went straight to the sink. 



My breathing was starting to get ragged and I fumbled with my phone, I tried to shut it off but I was fumbling with it; I wasn’t pressing down on the power button long enough. 

In a fit of what I can only describe as absolute petrification, I threw my phone. I can’t remember where I threw it to. I don’t know where it’s gone. Ive been looking for it ever since. I didn't think you could hear without eardrums. I couldn't think with all the noise and... I don't know. I simply don't know anymore. 

It sounds like it’s everywhere right now. It feels like it's everywhere right now.  Every surface is vibrating in that god-awful pattern of two’s. I can feel it in my fingers. I can feel it in my jaw. I can feel it behind my eyes. 



Please, please, please tell me what I can do to stop this. Its everywhere. I don't know what else to do.
