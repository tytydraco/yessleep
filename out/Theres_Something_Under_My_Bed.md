Do you remember all the things you were scared of when you were little? If you really look back on it, you’ll probably remember a whole bunch of them. There were probably some silly ones, like lava or quicksand. Probably some more rational ones too, like drowning or getting lost. And, if I had to bet, you probably had some of the classics as well. Darkness. Spiders. Monsters under the bed.

That last one was the worst for me. I remember many nights as a child where all I could do was wrap my blankets tightly around me and try to ignore the nagging feeling that something was lurking just below me. 

It never worked, of course. No matter how many times I told myself that my fear was irrational, that nothing could be down there, I wouldn’t believe it. Even if my mom had checked for me as she was tucking me in, my brain would still tell me that something had been hiding from her when she’d looked. Or perhaps it had materialized after the fact. The only thing I “knew” for sure was that something was definitely waiting for me down there. Something with sharp claws and slavering fangs. Something that wanted to hurt me.

Of course, this fear made sleep all but impossible. Every time my eyes would start to drift closed, I would start to hear little sounds. Nothing significant, just a gentle tap or scratch or shuffle in the darkness. But to a child’s frightened mind, these sounds constituted proof of everything I’d been afraid of. Every tiny sound was a sign, every thump or click or creak the noise of the terrible beast stirring, shifting, preparing to emerge and swallow me whole. 

These thoughts lessened as I grew older. After all, these fears were for babies, and anyone who still believed in monsters under the bed at the ripe old age of 10 was an immature, silly, scaredy-cat. That’s what my friends told me, anyway. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get over my phobia completely. There were still a few nights a month where the fear would reawaken and I would pull myself out of bed the next morning, bleary and exhausted, hoping for a miracle solution. 

That solution came when I was 13. My parents, giving in to my constant begging, had finally gotten me a phone. It was junky, having belonged to my grandma for a number of years before being passed down, and it had very limited capabilities, but it was mine. 

It was one day, while messing around with that stupid Photo Booth app, that I came up with my ingenious solution. Whenever I was scared that something was under my bed, I would simply take a photo of it. That way, if there was something down there, I would be able to see it and get help. But if there was nothing, which would almost certainly always be the case, I would be able to put my mind at ease and go to sleep, comfortable in the knowledge that no boogeyman would jump out and get me if I did. 

This method worked wonders. Night after night, when the creeping suspicion would start to sneak into my tired brain, I would switch on the flash, reach my hand over the side of the bed, and snap a quick picture, all from the safety of my mattress. And, when that picture inevitably turned up empty, my fears would be alleviated and I would drift right off to sleep. 

Over the years, I eventually stopped having to take the pictures altogether. After all, I had seen dozens of empty photos, night after night after night, and there had never once been anything to worry about in any of them. Finally, I’d come to accept those little noises for what they really were: just noises. By the time I reached college, I no longer had to use the camera at all, which was probably for the best. After all, the habit would have been difficult to explain to my roommates. 

Since then, I’ve graduated college, started my career, and moved away from home. I have my very own house now in a nice suburban town and, though I live alone, I felt completely safe. I hadn’t thought about my silly worries in almost a full decade, and everything seemed to be going well. Until tonight. 

About an hour ago, I jolted awake with a start. I thought I’d been having a nightmare, though, at this point, I’m not so sure. If it was a dream, it must have been terrifying, because I woke with clammy skin and a racing pulse. Thankfully, as my eyes darted around my dark room, I felt my fear start to gradually ebb away. As I scanned every nook and cranny, seeing nothing, my body started to relax again. I adjusted my blankets and prepared to turn over and will myself back to sleep when I felt a nearly forgotten creeping terror start to bloom in my chest. For the first time in years, my mind once again started to wonder whether something could be under my bed. 

I tried and tried to stop thinking about it, but it was no use. The leftover adrenaline from my sudden awakening fueled my anxiety, and, soon, I was starting to work myself up pretty badly. Every random noise startled me, just like when I was little, and, if I focused intently enough on the silence, I could swear I heard shallow breathing. In a burst of petrified curiosity, I peeked down through the tiny sliver of darkness between my mattress and headboard, and, for just a moment, I thought I saw something shift.

It was then, as I fought through my fried nerves and nausea, that I remembered my old trick. With shaking hands, I reached down to where my charging phone was resting on the floor beside my bed. As my fingers cleared the bottom of the bed frame, it was all I could do not to yank my hand back as I imagined something curling its claws around my wrist. Trembling, I managed to flip my phone on its side so that the screen faced the darkness under my bed. 

I never managed to take the photo. In a tiny fraction of a second, something happened that shocked me to my core. In an instant, all of my rationalizations flew out the window, and, in a moment of panic, all I could think to do was to yank my phone and myself underneath my covers like a frightened child. I now know, for certain, that something is under my bed, and that no photo I take will help to alleviate my terror. And, what’s worse, I also know what it looks like. 

See, unlike that first old phone I had, my current one is loaded with the latest technologies and updates. It can be opened in two different ways. As has always been the case, you can input a preset passcode. But, for the average modern Internet consumer, this process is tedious and difficult to do every time you want to open your phone. So, as an alternative option, phone companies have introduced a much more convenient feature: face ID.

I’m typing this now from the “safety” of my mattress, though I don’t know how much longer I have before whatever it is that’s down there decides it’s not going to abide by that arbitrary rule any longer. I don’t know what it wants, but I’m certain that whatever it plans to do will not end well for me. I can’t bear to make a run for it because, from the second I turned that phone over to face the inky abyss and watched the little padlock at the top of the screen flip open, I knew for sure. 

There’s something under my bed. 

And it looks just like me.
