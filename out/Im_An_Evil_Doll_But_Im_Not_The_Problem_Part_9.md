You’d think the worst was behind us, but the slow, paranoid trudge to JP’s place was it’s own little slice of hell. Though in a much less literal way. 

Poor Kaz is rough, every step seems like a battle. And it’s not helped by the fact that we have to take looping, wandering paths to avoid me being seen. Didn’t realize how much I’d gotten used to the new eye. 

But eventually we make it there, Kaz shirtless, and myself doing my best to keep out of sight. 

I knock, and out of all the strange things I’ve seen tonight, the beautiful, dark skinned woman who answers the door throws me for the biggest loop. 

If I hadn’t just trauma killed my way through hell, I’d have probably noticed the fact she didn’t seem to bat an eyelash at the two of us standing there. 

“No way this is his place. “ I say, considering the paint peeling stuff JP was saying about just about every group of humans on the planet.

“Oh, it is. “ She says with a smile before turning , “ Babe, your friends are here.” 

I expected JP’s place to be some kind of tinfoil hat themed rat’s nest. Full of cork board, red string,  firearms and offensive posters. But I’m looking at a nice middle class home. Lots of computers, a few antiques, but nothing to indicate JP’s career. 

“Kaz and punch, right? I’m Sveta, Justin told me you guys would be in rough shape, but, wow. Come in.” the confusingly located woman says. 

We do. Kaz and I exchanging stunned looks. 

JP comes downstairs holding a jar full of a black, tarry, almost cotton-candy like substance. This time though, he looks like he could be an accountant or pharmacist. Dress pants and a clean, button up shirt. 

“I have so many questions “ I blurt, taking a seat on a leather ottoman. 

JP grins, handing the jar to Kaz. 

“What, you were expecting something different? “

Kaz takes the jar, and begins eating the substance within. 

“I have no idea how to answer that politely. “ I say, honestly. 

JP laughs, Sveta joining him. 

“The shit that goes bump in the night has all kinds of ways of finding people. They can look for things you didn’t even know could be seen. 

Positive actions, words, thoughts, they smell those like a hound smells sweat. 

Here, I’m protected from things like that, but when I go out? I take no chances. I surround myself with a fug of the worst ideas made by man. “ JP explains. 

It gives me a sense of scale, of just how big all of this can be. When you’re stuck in the thick of it, you don’t really get that kind of perspective. 

Kaz finishes the jar, leaning backward into an overstuffed couch. 

“How long till you’re patched up?” JP asks. 

“A few days, at least. I’ve never been this badly hurt. Might be as long as a week. 

Are we too late to help Leo?” Kaz replies. 

“ Son of a bitch. “ JP begins, “ Well, I have good news, and bad news on the Leo front. 

The good news is that he’s still alive, The Dutch Uncle is really making a meal out of things. Tearing him apart, putting him back together. I don’t think he’s stopping any time soon. “ 

“ Then let’s put an end to that.” Kaz says, he tries to sound determined but he’s tired, hurt, and it shows. 

“No, when something like the Bishop starts going full super villain. You let them. It gives us time. “ JP replies. 

“If that’s the good news, what’s the bad news?” I ask.

“This bishop of yours, his reach exceeds his grasp. “ Sveta starts, “ He’s part of an organization, worldwide, ranks themselves based on local religion. Heresy in parody.  

They have a plan for this place, this city. They’ve began to move their people in, that house was just the beginning, it’s current owner, pretty much middle management. “

“Jesus Christ.” Is all I can muster. 

“ Great example of who we need.” JP says fatalistically, “ That, or a fucking army. “

“What can we do?” Kaz says with a grunt as something deep within him makes a wet popping noise. 

“Lower our expectations. 

How many spooky bastards can you round up?” JP inquires. 

“None, by now Pi will have made it known that I am persona non grata. Few around would openly attack, but I won’t be getting any help. “ Kaz laments. 

“You’re shitting me, right?

Okay, so there goes plan B. 

Plan C it is. 

If we don’t have anyone to run some severe interference, you three need to disappear

Kaz, I’ve got a contact in Holland, little city your kind get along pretty well in. 

Punch, Ecuador, nice old toymaker, he’ll keep you on the straight and narrow. 

Leo gets the deepest pit of the most barren part of Canada. 

If it’s just Leo and the proxy, we’re looking at about a %25 success rate. “ JP explains, grimly. 

“Kaz, there isn’t anyone?” I plead. 

“Maybe Hyve and Flapp. They hold no love for their kind. But reaching out  is going to be risky in and of itself. And knowing those two, they’re going to want to be paid handsomely. “ Kaz offers. 

“That’s another thing. What I had to smuggle to Mr. E back in the warehouse. None of it was cheap and none of it was easy to find. 

I’m running  low on anything of real value and it’s going to take a while to replenish my stocks. 

I’ll help you guys all I can. But I’m running on fumes here. “ JP laments. 

“Appreciated. Two questions though. 

First, how can I get healed, or repaired or whatever? I’m looking like a factory reject and feeling like shit. 

Second, if you could understand me, why did you let me keep texting back at the house?” I ask. 

“You’re talking to a guy who’s family business is working with supernatural objects and who’s wife has forgotten more than he’ll ever know on the subject. I’ll get those dents banged out. 

And I let you keep texting because it was kind of adorable. “ JP replies with a grin. 



I can guarantee that at some point you’ve heard pain be referred to as ‘indescribable’  . When what the person really means is that it isn’t relatable. 

But the pain I felt as JP began his combination of surgery, small appliance repair and ritual was the very definition of the word ‘indescribable’. 

Where would I begin explaining what it feels like to have your metal heated and bent? Or the sensation of flesh that isn’t truly living going under the knife?

I can’t describe the pain, but I can describe the fear. 

Every second made me feel more like I was trapped in something. Every glimpse of my twisted flesh in a mirror, shocks me. Makes me want to rip apart this walking coffin I’ve been placed in and bleed out on the stainless steel table. 

I have to do something to distract myself. 

“What’s the diagnosis?” I ask JP as he uses a pair of stout pliers to straighten out a bent spar of metal. 

He looks around for a moment, then stands, closing the door to his workshop. 

“You know how everyone thinks your maker was a C student? 

I’m not seeing that. And the more I look at how things are playing out, the less I’m willing to accept coincidence as an explanation. “ He answers. 

“What are you saying?” I prod, as fittingly JP prods some mechanical bit in my left arm with a modified voltmeter. 

“I don’t know a hundred per cent, but I have some theories. 

No one can tell the future, if they could you’d be able to hunt the supernatural by looking for lottery winners. 

But a decent amount of people in our world have foresight, it’s rare but not unheard of. 

Maybe your maker saw some of this coming, set you in place to drop a turd in the bishop’s punch bowl. “ JP postulates as he begins to saw the handle from the knife jammed through me. 

“What about the family? I’ve felt that mission nagging at me every second of every day. Why don’t I know anything about the bishop or Leo, or you?” I inquire. 

“Can’t say for sure, but my guess would be information you don’t know can’t be information you give. 

 Things at this scale move subtly, little nudges to fate moving things toward one direction. 

You still being you inside there isn’t a bug, it’s a feature. Whatever is playing out, it needs conscience, it needs some kind of morality. “ JP sounds somber as he reconnects my new eye. 

“Oh yeah, I’m a perfect role model. I told you what I did back there. “ I nearly whisper this, shame, and fear at what I’m capable of hit me as hard as the pain from the surgery. 

“Punch, you can’t be observed again, and you’re in a quiet neighborhood in a home that’s warded against just about everything. 

Take out about a dozen people, you’ll be a force of nature for a half hour. Even odds at walking out of the bishop’s place. 

Go nuts, now that this eye is back in, I can’t stop you. “ JP lets the statement disguised as an offer hang, I don’t reply, “ That’s what I mean. 

You’d be more efficient with your wits and the morality of a virus. You’d be more deadly as a six foot hulk of iron and chainsaws. But instead, you’re a conflicted Lil fella with just enough punch to keep going. That means something. “

“I can’t tell if you’re trying to reassure me or warn me. “ I say. 

“Both. I have a lot of clients, the Greysmiths keep the fight against the void well armed. But Leo is a close friend of mine, he’s saved my wife, my life, and been like a brother to me. 

But I have to tell you something about the Proxy. Now that I’m digging around in here, things make more sense. 

Don’t think of it like a free life. I know it’s tempting to see what you are as some kind of superpower, but it isn’t. 

You’re controlling it with the parts of your mind and being that are still human. If it gets destroyed while you’re using it, what’s left will be something I have to put down. 

You need to know the risks involved here. “ JP replies. 

“Still trying to synch up the JP I met in the house with the guy who is acting as my therapist/repairman here.” I add, trying to lighten the mood. 

“Yeah, trust me, wading through hours of the worst opinions on earth isn’t fun. Gives me a bit of faith in humanity when I get sucker punched for some of those shirts I wear though. 

Cost of doing business I guess. Glad to pay it. “ JP says. 

“Your wife, what’s her deal?” I reply, scrambling for a topic to keep my mind off the pain, and confusing flashes of a past life.

“You and I , we’re not family yet Lil fella. 

But let me give you a history lesson. You’ve been out of the loop for a few decades. 

Things like vampires, witches, true demons, Krampus, Goblins, we call them Brand Names. And all of them are extinct or nearly there. Years of infighting, hunting and power struggles that could destroy the world have left them beyond decimated. 

The new breeds, your slenderman-likes, cursed media, corporate themed slashers, rules summoned entities, they are more numerous, but less, related. They’re chaotic, created from a system that’s breaking down. “ Jp says with a tone of reflection. 

“And what does this have to do with my question?” I reply. 

JP simply shrugs and continues the final touches on bringing me back to as close to factory default as possible. 


The next few days go by at a snail’s pace. JP has patched into the security systems and we watch as Leo is shown and introduced to otherworldly torture so brutal and esoteric, it’s best to leave things a little vague. 

The Bishop gives things the personal touch less and less as time goes on, content to see the results of the ritual spawned creatures and cultists dressed in their Sunday best. 

After some false starts and nerve wracking deals Kaz manages to get in touch with Hyve and Flapp.  Reluctantly JP parts with most of his remaining stock in exchange of a promise of them covering our exit. 

“If this place is so well warded, why aren’t we home free when we get back?” I ask JP as the four of us go over the newest variant of the plan. 

“There’s a difference between being scryed on, and having someone follow you home. 

Making two monsters walking up to my door look like a tall uncle and a wobbly toddler, I can do. Re-write a cultist’s brain to forget they followed a prisoner here, that’s a little beyond me. “ JP answers sarcastically. 

“When do we get Leo out?” Kaz asks. 

He’s been getting better, but what they put him through still clearly shows. 

“That’s on him. Once he makes a play for the stash in the bathroom, Punch can use the proxy and we  all hope for the best. 

The only thing I’m worried about is his mind. 

Hunters, they’re human, but they come from a very crooked branch of the family tree. They don’t get twisted and warped by contact with the unknown like most people, but that battle of will, makes them a different breed. 

You’ve noticed it, the camp, the extreme confidence, that pulp character vibe. It’s all part of who they are. 

I’ve seen this kind of helplessness break them, the rest of us, we’re used to getting the shaft, having no options. Not them though. “ The admission makes the room go silent. None of us has anything to add as we think of our friend being broken to that extent. 



I may be an evil doll, but if the story ended with watching one of the only people I can trust go insane and die, I wouldn’t be posting it. I’m not an asshole. 

Leo picks his moment perfectly. 

The bishop is gone, and the majority of the twisted, Hell spawned creatures are focused on other infernal tasks. 

Around him are a half dozen cultists, none quite dressed the same, but all in what I’ve come to think of as the uniform of this cult. Cheap suits, dress pants, and somewhere on each outfit a stark purple accent of some form. 

Leo is bad-off, missing fingers, one foot twisted at a brutal angle, and wounds of every imaginable type covering him. Half dead from trauma and infection, he has no problem selling his ruse. 

When he vomits on himself, the group laughs and mocks him, but no one wants to be stuck in a damp windowless basement with a man that just shit what’s left of his pants. 

If these were trained people, they would have simply let him stew. But the bishop’s human followers are the twisted and the weak minded. Locals lured with dark promises and dark magic. 

They drag Leo from the sprawling, now dungeon-like basement, his broken foot making him scream and nearly pass out. 

He’s roughly thrown into the bathroom, leaving a smear of blood, waste and filth on the tile. 

A large, athletic built man in a tweed suit coat and green pants spits on him. 

“ Clean yourself up for fuck sake. “ The cultist says slamming the door. 

We watch through the grainy camera as Leo limps to the toilet, almost falling as he stands on the seat to reach the wall mounted tank. 

The large Ziplock bag inside has a gun and some ammunition from the home invaders, but more importantly, a gift from Kaz. 

The small, wrapped candy looks ancient, golden wrapper long since faded to an off brown. But what’s inside is more than a piece of spun sugar from a brand that hasn’t existed since the 60’s. 

It's the result of Kaz doing what his kind does. Filled with something a hell of a lot more useful than a caramel center. 

Leo grimaces as he eats it, not that I can blame him. Half century expired toilet candy, magic or not, can’t taste good. 

The worst of the Hero’s wounds seal. Fingers sprout painfully. His foot twists back into place with a snap he’s smart enough to muffle with a towel. And in a few seconds, while he’s not looking fresh, he’s clearly got some fight in him. 

“It’s go time. “ JP says. 

I let myself float, I feel the scraps of my mind and soul begin to get pulled somewhere far away. 

There is a terrifying moment of nothing, blankness. A feeling of being stuck in a place that’s claustrophobic and immense all at the same time. 

Then, I’m there, proxy whirring and clicking to life. It’s three and a half feet of bone, steel and pulsating inhuman flesh. 

For a second I savor it, to be free of that constant predator’s mindset. That nagging urge to do the worst things possible. But the cold, vacant feeling that replaces it makes me wonder what consequences playing musical chairs with my soul is going to have. 

Information is tossed at me through the proxy’s eyes, it’s all to much to parse at first. What I’ve come to think of as ‘My body’, is fluid, almost elegant. What I find myself encased in now, is a blunt tool. 

The readouts tell me the house has somehow gotten slightly bigger. There are about 15 humans inside, and an unknown number of ‘Malignant and other Entities. ‘ . 

I’m standing in the attic, above the bathroom door, waiting for some kind of signal to get this couple hundred pounds of mechanical horror moving. 

Scared doesn’t begin to describe things, I thought I’d feel invincible in this thing. But with what JP told me, it feels like holding massive pistol in a shaking hand. 

I can hear Leo mumbling something, a soft, almost song-like prayer in a language the proxy can’t identify.

I hear a clip being slammed home. And a door explode. I figure it’s time to roll the dice. 

I break through the cheap drywall ceiling quick enough to see the man from before screaming in pain and rage. Bits of door kicked with a force beyond what someone should be able to muster sticking from his body. 

He shifts his focus from Leo to myself, his horrified look as he sees the skunk-themed monstrosity that is the proxy is all the opening the Hero needs. 

The overhand punch breaks the cultist’s jaw, and knocks him out instantly. I’m already moving, wicked claws ready to finish the job. 

Leo blocks my way with a bare, grime covered foot. 

“Most of these people had no choice. They’re being threatened and corrupted. Once the Bishop is out of the picture, they can pick up the pieces. 

Nothing permanent to anything human, got it? “ The wounded hero demands. 

I go to reply, and realize I don’t know how. A second or so later though, a digitized version of Leo’s voice comes from my chest, “ Nothing permanent, got it.” Something inside me changes the tone of the words to be a reply. 

“Fucking hate, that. “ Leo comments grabbing a two foot piece of wood from the door. I wonder what good the flimsy, jagged debris is going to be, but the proxy shows me a strange energy starting to infuse it. 

  
The hallway has two more rooms than before, and the entire place has a damp, grimy feel to it. Like some kind of sad attempt at the kind of reality warping Pi was capable of. 

Below us we hear the sounds of footsteps, cultists being drawn to the commotion. The front door is out of the question, but you know what they say, when god closes a door he opens a window. 

Leo’s kick, bare-footed or not sounds like a gunshot when it hits the door. But despite their cheap look, and Leo’s renewed vigor, it doesn’t so much as rattle. 

“Son of a bitch. This is going to take a minute. “ Leo says, as he starts to tap and prod ad the door. 

“Got it.” I reply in his voice. 

“At least if I die I won’t have to hear that again. “ Leo says, starting to chant lowly. 

I’m wide enough to block the top of the stairs, as the handful of cultists reach them, three pistols ring out firing a dozen or so shots in a couple of seconds. 

Plates chip, the proxy’s vision stutters, and one claw is blown from my hand, but the resulting backspray of hot lead in the small hallway sends the first four cultists falling down the stairs holding painful fragmentation wounds. 

“No guns unless you can hit the Hunter you fucking idiots. We don’t need bullets chasing us around in here.” A small man with a cutting voice says. 

His suit is more expensive, and he has a small, subtle silver circle lapel pin. A leader of some form I’m guessing. The proxy confirms my suspicion as it shows him as 93% human 7% unknown. 

A crackle of static and a yelp of pain from behind me, whatever Leo is doing, it doesn’t seem to be going well. 

The proxy calculates the most efficient ways to kill, no compulsion, just temptation. 

But if this was just a story about an evil doll who kills well, it wouldn’t be that interesting, would it? You’ve heard that before. I have to follow through with my promise, and show, I’m not the fucking problem. 

The proxy is slow, but the torque sends cultists flying down the stairs. Ribs cracked, sensitive parts aching, teeth spread on the carpet, but each one will see the sunrise. 

This thing isn’t designed to dole out mercy, and things take their toll. It’s sluggish, robotic motions can’t dodge the clubs, cleavers and knives of the cultists. 

Wounded zealots rise again, throwing their damaged selves against me. The weight of the swarm, and the constraints of trying to keep my humanity making me back up into the hallway. 

Weak points, and damaged systems start to pop up in my vision. 

“Sixty seconds. Maybe 90.” Leo yells, a burst of green light illuminates the hallway. 

Whatever programming is running the proxy isn’t designed for what I’m asking, but I feel it trying to accommodate, to adapt.  

I jab and I roar, trying to slow the mob, none of them want to get close to the proxy, but they’re starting to realize I’m holding back.

Then, from calculations goosed along with dark energy a solution presents itself. 

I need more force. 

If you want to subdue someone you don’t send someone well armed, you send in someone big. 

One of the three tubes from the backpack releases a quarter of it’s thick red liquid into the proxy. 

I thrash and jerk, hitting the ground in an almost seizure like state.  The spectacle itself gives the cultists pause. They stand unsure and wary as I grow, taller and wider in painful bursts and fits. 

By the end I’m an asymmetrical, misshapen construct nearly five feet tall, I taunt the group with their own screams played back. 

These people may be lost, and being influenced by powers beyond their understanding, but fear and self preservation take the edge off of their lunatic zeal. 

Ribs break and cultists find themselves stuck through walls, as my vision shows me a dozen points of concern on the proxy. Joints are beginning to wear, damage is taking it’s toll.   

But in a few dozen seconds, I’m standing at the top of the stairs, all of the cultists either unable or unwilling to keep trying. 

The man with the silver pin looks exasperated, shaking his head as he pulls out a cell phone. 

“Yeah, he’s got something with him. Kind of a half assed construct, send up the negotiator.” He says, grinning a wicked smile at us, as if he didn’t just watch me disable a dozen people. 

I hear a small arching noise and a click. 

“We’re good…” Leo begins. 

Five massive, clawed fingers, large enough to fill the doorway from the kitchen put deep furrows into the damp drywall. 

The sounds of something being dragged, an entity large enough the proxy’s readouts can’t seem to decide if it’s sentient or an architectural accident slowly makes it’s way up the stairs. 

“Leonard, if you get out of that window as fast as you can, there’s a very good chance you’ll escape. “ a voice, choked and gleeful says from the basement doorway, “ But behind that door are 5 lucky people we’ve been saving for a rainy day. 

We both know you won’t leave them. You’ll waste your window of freedom, and you’ll be back with me. “

More dragging noises, the house itself seems to creak under the weight of the entity speaking. Another hand grasps the opposite side of the doorway. The voice sounds closer now. 

“You’ve offended me Leonard. You’ve made me and mine look foolish to the bishop. 

I want you to imagine what I’m capable of now that you’ve made this personal. Truly understand that what I’ve done to you, what I’ve shown you, until now, has just been business. 

If you make me leave the comfort of this basement,  the rules change Leonard.”

I expect a quip and some crazy power, but when I look to Leo, I see terror, hesitation. Whatever went on here beyond what we saw, it’s left it’s mark on him. 

Behind those massive, wicked claws are wrists the size of young oak. Whatever is dragging itself up, I want no part of, I turn and run toward Leo. 

I tackle him into the room, and as promised a group of 3 men and 2 women are crudely chained to the floor. 

The impact seems to have snapped him back to reality a bit, but I see a very unheroic look of panic on his face. 

He sprints to the door, and with a mumbled syllable he had to repeat a half dozen times the wards he bypassed engage again. 

“That won’t hold him for long. “ Leo says, desperately trying to control his breathing. 

The group scream and plead for help. I walk to the window and look for any sign of Flapp. 

Nothing but three well armed cultists waiting for our escape. 

“Our backup isn’t here. “ The suit says, having to heavily garble some words. 

Leo shudders, his face terror and frustration.

“Fuck me. “ Leo says, softly. 

“Are you going to be okay?” I ask, wishing I had more control over the tone when I ‘speak’. 

“I’m going to have to be. But that thing down there, we can’t win a straight up fight. And we need to get these people out. 

You’ve got the ear of tens of thousands of people, maybe one of them has been paying enough attention to help us figure things out. “ Leo says, as the dragging noise begins to get closer. 

And that’s where I am, desperately trying to give you guys an update before that door comes crashing down and I get to see what is scary enough it has Leo wanting to run in the other direction.   

You’ve helped me out before, JP boosted a couple of books when he was here the first time, and Hyve seems to think he can work something with the insects in the home. 

I know it’s a lot to ask, but I want these people to get out, I want to prove, I’m not the problem. 


Looks like I'm still around:
