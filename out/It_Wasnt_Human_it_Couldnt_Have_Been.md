All my life I’ve heard scary stories, from ghosts to killers. All the kids in my town would hush and whisper these stories in each other's ears. Telling that no story hit like a ghost story, but my opinion was always different. After all, we were the ones to create them.  Time and time again I would see and hear the heinous acts humans themselves commit. Murder, abduction, abuse, rape. All humans. I always found the horrors of humanity to be more bone-chilling than any demon or monster lying under mountains, or hiding in the shadows. At least that’s what I used to think. 

Markus and I had planned to go out to have a picnic. Markus had just turned 18 and wanted to celebrate his birthday by watching a meteor shower. I wasn’t the biggest fan of sitting out in the open, in the middle of the night, but he really wanted to so I folded. Markus was responsible for the drinks and I, for the food.  It was a thirty-minute drive and a fifteen-minute walk.  The sun was starting to set and I couldn’t shake that I was seeing shapes peeking behind the trees. Markus told me to stop being so weird and I quickly shut up.

I followed him to a small circular clearing between the trees. We set up our tent, and placed our blankets and food down, before lying down ourselves. We waited around an hour before the meteor shower actually started. It was amazing, I could see everything, and every star felt like it was right in front of me. I had never seen the sky so clear, the city I lived in was always too bright to see anything.  I never really went camping as a kid and definitely didn’t after this. 

“I’ve never seen a meteor shower,” I said.

 “Really, my mom and I always travel to see one when we can. Like a late gift, you know?” 

“makes sense, it’s nice,”

“It is. We should do this more .”

 “Watch meteor showers?” 

“No, I mean…” Markus turned to me. He looked at me for a while, shifting his glance from my left to right eye. “Can you pass me the drinks?” He finally said. 

I grabbed his bag and looked inside. My face dropped a little. When he said he packed drinks I expected lemonade, tea, or something, but what I saw was alcohol. Markus said it would only be this one time, and that I'd like it, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and eventually, Markus almost drank a whole bottle of…something, I didn't have as much as he did, but I felt sick. I’m not sure what it was, I just knew it tasted disgusting. Markus looked through his backpack for something.

“What are you looking for?” 

“Chocolate.” I sat up a little. 

“You brought chocolates?” I asked excitedly. 

He pulled out a small box of chocolate. “ Well, kinda.” He said. “I took them from the store.” He shrugged. 

“You stole edibles from the store?”

 “Yeah, sorry.” He said unapologetically before popping one in his mouth. 

“Markus!” 

He rolled his eyes. “Oh come on Billie, it’s not even that big of a deal, see” He put another one in his mouth. 

I had never done anything like that before, never a lick of alcohol, no weed, cigarette, or anything. I looked at him convinced somehow he’d die. I realized very quickly how stupid that idea was. He held out a hand, with a stupid grin on his face.

 “C, mon.” 

I gave him my hand.

 “I promise it won’t kill you.” He smirked.

 I loosened my grip, pulling my hand back. He laughed at me a bit, I will admit I felt a little embarrassed, maybe I was overreacting (I totally was.). 

“It does nothing, it’s just weed, at most it makes you giggle, or hungry.” 

I squinted a little.

“Close your eyes.” 

I reluctantly did so.  He opened my mouth and put a chocolate on my tongue. It tasted awful, not sweet at all. Half an hour later we were there laughing a little too loudly for the quiet night. After a bit, I got too dizzy to sit up, so I laid down on my back. Markus looked down at me and smiled. 

“Dizzy?” He asked. 

“Maye a little.” 

He pointed up at the sky. “See that.” He said. 

 I looked up but my eyes just couldn’t stay still enough to focus on any stars

 “No.” 

“Well, it's the Milky Way.” 

“Milky Way,” I said looking up at the sky. I put my arms above spreading my fingers apart, trying to focus on them. He looked at me.

“I know you know what the Milky Way is.” He said. 

“Yeah, I just, I just feel dizzy, can’t really hold a thought.” 

Markus laughed at me a little. “You still think you're going to die.” 

“Yeah.”

He leaned over me, looking down. “Your face is all red.” He laughed.

I covered my face with my hands. “Says you, you look like a tomato.” I smiled.

“Yeah, well, whatever,” he said. He looked at me for a while. I smiled at him.

 “Billie..” He said. 

“Yeah?” 

“I’ve been thinking,” he said slowly. “I’ve been thinking that maybe we could go ou-.” he fell silent. 

I looked over to see him looking out to the bushes. 

“Markus?” 

He clasped his hand over my mouth. “There’s someone in the trees.” He whispered. 

My eyes shot over to where he was looking,  I looked through the small split through the tent's side cover, but all I saw were trees, branches, and bushes. 

“You’re just drun-” 

CRACK. 

A branch snapped under pressure about thirty feet away. My eyes widened. It had to be some animal. We listened but everything was silent. No birds, deer, bugs, or wind. It was completely silent. I looked over at Markus. His breath was heavy and broken. He laid down pulling me next to him.

“Are you sure it was a person?” I asked.

“No, but it definitely wasn’t an animal, I heard it talking.” 

We laid in silence for a bit before we heard what I assumed was a deer. It was walking around for a little before starting to eat the nearby bushes, I went to sit up, but Markus pushed me down. “Don’t,” he whispered with desperation. I was about to argue when I heard a bone-chilling tear. The deer let out a screech of pain that left my ears ringing. After minutes of screaming in agony, we heard what sounded like individual tendons getting ripped apart, bones snapping, and flesh being torn, I could hear large spills of blood splash on the ground. After every ear the deer grew quieter and quieter until it went silent, I heard something large smack against the ground.

 Then we heard the chewing, fleshy raw chewing, I started to shake uncontrollably tears swelling in my eyes, It must have been a bear, no human could’ve done that, but as we heard the last tear, there was a groan, minutes of just mindless groaning, and shrieking from a deer, but deeper, so much deeper…until the first “Hello.” My body was struck with so much fear I couldn’t even shake, my body went completely still. 

Its voice changed from human to animal, male to female, young to old, before resting on a man's voice. “Help me.” It said louder. “Get away from me!” it said shrieking louder and louder. I looked up at the sky above me hoping whatever that thing was, wasn’t taller than the tent. It started to walk closer, blood dripping from its fingertips. It tapped the side of the tent. I could hear Markus whispering something under his breath but I couldn’t tell if it was a prayer or an apology. 

Markus shoved me down and covered my head and neck, I wanted to scream. I held my breath as it began to unzip the tent. Slowly but surely it got the bottom unzipped but stopped when a gunshot was heard in the far distance. It started to walk away, before breaking into a run pushing everything and anything in its path. We waited long after that thing's footsteps grew quiet. I poked my head up. Markus looked at me, his eyes not able to focus on me. 

“What the fuck?” He said, stammering.

“I...I don't know.” 

“I, we can’t stay here.” He said nervously.

 I looked at him, my heart still pumping. I just looked at him before laughing. 

“It’s fine, anything dangerous has already passed.” 

Markus looked at me. “No, everything safe is gone. We have to go, Billie. Come one.”  

Markus looked through the small slit before slowly opening the tent the rest of the way. “Please don’t hear me, please don’t come back, please.” I heard him whisper over and over. Once it was all the way open, he stared into the wilderness for a minute. He turned around and shoved our phones and anything else important in his backpack, and he grabbed me and we ran out of the tent. I could barely hold consciousness, everything around me looked like a blur. I must have blacked out because when I opened my eyes, Markus was flying down the road. He didn’t even think to drive me to my house, we just spent the night at his place. His mom was out on a business trip, which made our anxiety so much worse. 

We made sure every window and door was locked before we even went upstairs. I spent the whole night crying and shivering. The next morning, I woke up to the smell of something cooking. I slowly made my way downstairs. Markus was making breakfast for us, he was humming to himself like nothing happened.

“Good morning.” He said happily. 

“Good morning.” 

“Last night was a fucking mess, I was hallucinating like crazy.”

 “I heard it too Markus,” I said. 

“No, no, I think we were just out of it.” He said seriously before turning around and humming again.

I saw his arm started to shake. I nodded. 

“Yeah, yeah, I was so out of it.” I said drifting my vision to the window 

“I made eggs and toast.” 

“Thanks.” 

I sat at the table patiently waiting while he made my plate. I thanked him and started to dig in, but I barely got through my first egg before running to throw up in the kitchen's trash can. Markus held my hair behind my back. 

“C’ mon let’s go to the bathroom.” He ran me over to the bathroom nearby, I almost missed the toilet before throwing up again. I started to ball my eyes out. He had no clue what to do. He got up.

“Do you need water, Gatorade, you want me to stay?.” 

“I want you to shut the fuck up.” I gargled. 

He quickly sat down on the rim of the bathtub next to me. After an hour and a half, I was finally done. 

“ I, I wanna lay down,” I said. 

“Here let me get you something, and I’ll take you upstairs. He ran and grabbed something from the kitchen and came back with a bottle of water a flavor packet, and a bucket. “ here, take my arm.” 

I stood up weakly, my legs were shaking like crazy. Taking his arm he led me upstairs to his room. “I can just go back to the guest room.”

 “No, no it’s fine, my parents would kill me if their “nice sheets” got messed up.” He rolled his eyes. “Now just lay down, before you get dizzy again. He pulled the sheets out and laid me down.

 “I’m sorry I threw up,” I said embarrassed.

 “No, it’s fine, I already knew my cooking was bad anyway.” 

I smiled weakly. “You know that’s not it.” 

His face dropped. “It’s fine really.” He said before walking out. 

The rest of the day was awkward, He seemed so out of it. I didn’t blame him, I didn’t know what to make of it either, it’s like I both understood what happened, but I also didn’t like somehow I could explain it somehow with logic, but I couldn’t. It was around 6:30 at night when we were going to order some pizza. Markus offered to pay me back so he ran to get his wallet from his bag, but it was gone. He looked up at me,  his face went pale. 

“I left it in the tent.” He stuttered.

 We had to go back, lord knew I didn’t want to, but he kinda needed it. I told him we needed to get it but he insisted everything in it was replaceable, or we could go another day, but after arguing for an hour we finally got in the car, it was already dark out, so It made everything feel so much worse. Once we reached the spot we got out our flashlights and started to walk to the tent. It was an agonizing 15 minutes, we twitched at every sound, and the sense of death weighed heavy on our backs. We knew when we got close that we could smell flesh in the air, I stopped and was taken back to the day I found Gabe’s car.

I felt sick, and I could feel tears swell in my eyes. Markus looked at me with sympathy before pushing further into the darkness. When we reached the tent, we both grasped a little, It had been torn apart. We looked at each other hesitantly before walking closer. Markus pushed aside some of the cloth before searching through our stuff, he grabbed our food bag and finally, he held up his wallet. He stood up, wiping the dirt off his jeans. I felt a drop on my arm, I looked at my sleeve before feeling it again, I looked up to the sky, it was raining as if the darkness was bad enough. Markus started to move his flashlight around, searching. I looked at him confused.

“Where’s the deer?” He asked.

 “What does that matter? Let’s get the hell out of here.” 

“No, I want to see what it did, I need to.” He walked into the nearby bushes until he came across it. He said something to himself.

 “What? What’s wrong?”

 “I, I don’t know.” 

I walked next to him and looked down at what once was a deer. It was disgusting, It was torn to pieces, and I couldn't even tell what was skin and what was an organ. I looked at it closer, something was off, I couldn’t tell what it was, I just knew something was wrong with this deer. 

“Markus we need to leave.” 

He nodded and turned around. We walked in silence as the rain began to hit us harder every minute. I looked back behind me, I felt like something was there, just out of sight of the light. I turned to Markus, shining the light at him. My heart dropped. Someone was standing not even 20 feet away from us. I could just barely see their legs, but there was undoubtedly somebody there. Markus turned around, and he froze. His breaths became quick and sharp. The person stood completely still, but as I looked closer I could see something in their hand. I squinted, was it a stick, a pipe, I couldn’t tell. Markus took my flashlight from me slowly, before grabbing my hand. I looked at him confused, but I couldn’t see his face. I heard him count from three, before turning off our flashlight and running toward the car. 

I heard a shot ring out. I ducked my head. Another one rang out, it sounded so much closer this time. I heard them try to reload it, but I think they gave up because they stopped to run after us. Markus squeezed my hand tightly, pushing any branches aside.  I could barely see anything, my eyes hadn’t had enough time to adjust, I tried to make sense of what I saw in the moonlight, but the rain made it so much harder. Markus let go of my hand, He told me not to wait up and that the car wasn't far. I ran pushing branches out of my face, I could see the car, and a smile came across my face, but I got distracted with hope and I slipped in the mud. 

Markus pulled me up and we began to run when I heard something smack against Markus, He let out a scream and fell to the ground. I turned around and I could see the man standing over top of him. “You killed him!” The man screamed, “What are you?” He screamed again in almost desperation. 

The man smashed the end of his rifle against Markus’s face. Markus screamed, but the man didn’t care he raised his gun again. I looked around and there was nothing, I looked up at the man, still hidden by the darkness. I ran at him with all the force I had knocking him over. Markus got up and grabbed the gun. 

I punched the man as hard as I could, still seeing nothing but his outline. I felt a wave of pain go up my arm, it felt like I broke all the bones in my hand, and then I did it again.

“You killed him, You killed him!” He said screaming over and over. 

I hesitated and put my hand to my side. Something wasn't right, I didn't understand what he was saying.

Markus pulled me back. “Come on!” He grabbed my hand and rushed me to the car, he shoved the keys in the car and drove off.

When we finally made it back to my neighborhood, he pulled over slowly. He shut the car off and rested his head on the wheel. 

“How bad is it?” I asked. 

He looked at me, Half his face was covered in bruises. I winced a little. 

“Jeez, way to make me feel better.” he sighed.

 “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it!” 

He waved me off. “You probably should get inside, before your mom flips out on you.”. 

I nodded. I opened the door slowly and climbed out. 

“Goodnight.” I turned to look at him. 

“Goodnight.” He said, not looking at me. 

I shut the door and walked inside quietly. My parents were sleeping so I tried to stay quiet before I got to my room. I took a shower and went to bed. Markus tried his best to make his bruises go away before his mom got home that weekend, but they didn't. Markus told her he got into a fight with some kids and had to stay inside for a week. I told him to just tell her what happened, but Markus just brushed it off. 

He and I didn’t talk about what happened, and when we did, he would brush it off as us being drunk and hallucinating. We both wished that was the case. The man in the woods was found a few days later, I saw it in the paper. He claimed something attacked his friend while hunting the night Markus and I were out. Police said it was a bear, but Markus and I knew better. We both knew that thing wasn’t human. I tried to talk to the police about it, but they all insisted it was a bear. I asked them to explain the voices, and they said nothing.
