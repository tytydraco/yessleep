Warning for mentions of child and sexual abuse. 

So... I finally talked with my mom after hitting rock bottom. 

I had another dream. The woman and I where fighting, I don’t know why. She hit me with the wooden spoon again, but this time she also did something else. She pulled my hair, dragged me to the basement door, opened it, threw me in and closed the door, leaving me in the pitch black room. Alone. 

I tried knocking hard and screamed, ordering her to let me out, but, no response would ever come.

I woke up, as you can guess, very distressed, full of bruising I’ve had nearly since the day I moved. 

The feeling of loneliness, the feeling of being powerless, trapped, not being able to do anything, is worse that the visions of the lady or anything I’ve ever experienced. 

Alone, seeing nothing but dark, only you and your thoughts. 

I couldn’t sleep for days after that nightmare. Coffee was the only thing that kept me running. I would soon be hallucinating more and more, but only at the house. I didn’t feel safe in there anymore. I don’t think I ever did.

I was in the train to work, I blinked and woke up several hours later, it was now nighttime and I was very far from home. I called my boss, she was worried I never showed up but understood my situation and gave me some days off to recompose. 

I’ve had enough, if the situation escalated and I lost my job, I wouldn’t have a form to sustain anymore and would never be able to forgive myself. They would put me in a mental institution, but I knew I wasn’t crazy. It was all real, it had to be.

The next day, I went to my mother’s house, confessing the visions of the woman I had been having—including the dreams—totally expecting her to say nothing. 

She didn’t. 

She told me everything. 

When I finished my rant, I looked at her and she had more expression in her face than I’ve ever seen, her eyes bolt open. She was crying as she stood up abruptly. My mother came back with a photo in her hand. I took a glance at it, and sure enough, it was the smiling woman but... younger. 

My mother said that the lady was my grandma, which I’ve never met because she went missing or something, her name was Grace. She never talked about her. It was a taboo topic I wasn’t allowed to ask about. 

She started from the beginning. They used to live in my aunt’s house, my grandpa died when they were 10 and 8, that’s when my grandma became very abusive, she seemed to enjoy beating them up, and there was no one anymore who could stop her.

Grace would grab a wooden spoon—the same one I saw in my dream—and hit them all over their bodies. She was also strangely protective, they weren’t allowed to get out of the house or hang out with friends, but they would often sneak out, anyways. If my grandma found out, she would lock them up in the basement—the one I saw, too—in complete darkness. Just like I had seen.

One day she sneaked of to a party. My mother stopped talking at this point, seeming very conflicted to keep telling me what happened. 

She finally told me she was taken advantage off by an older guy. She was only 16 years old. 

My mother turned out to be pregnant—I knew she had me very young but she had never told me this. She had to tell my grandma. Grace didn’t take it well, calling her names I don’t even want to write, but you can assume what she said. She kept her in the basement for a week, only opening the door to give her food. 

I was born, my mother was very honest and said she hated me, since I was the child of her rapist and the cause of more abuse from her mother. Still, she didn’t want me near my grandma.

Soon after I first birthday, my mom would meet my dad, he was 18 but he already had a job and could get my mom out of the house. She scaped and moved far away. But she left my aunt with her bully, her own mother. 

She said she regretted it, she should’ve taken her, but they couldn’t afford another mouth to feed. 

After 10 years my mother found my aunt on social media and contacted her. They reunited. My aunt hadn’t held a grudge on her, saying she understood why she left. She used to be like that, really altruistic and generous. 

My aunt told her my grandma left one day and never came back, she reported her missing to the police. My mother thought it was weird that she would leave like that, but didn’t want to push it further. 

We moved closer to my auntie not long after. My mom wanted to be closer to her sister like they once were. I was 11 when I met her and I’ll always love her since. 

But, something doesn’t add up, I told her, the basement, there’s no door anywhere. 
She told me there was one—right beside the kitchen like saw—but that my aunt had covered it up and wouldn’t talk about it. Probably trauma, my mom said.

The first couple of years, there was a weird smell coming from it, but my aunt would always be baking something—she was a really good baker—and it disguised it, so no one complained. 

After that, my mother apologized to me for all she had done to me, saying she never intended to be like her mother, cold and unapologetic, but that she couldn’t hold the pain inside anymore. 

We hugged, and I forgave her. I quickly said goodbye to my mom, thanking her for telling me the truth, but I was sure there was more to the story that my mom didn’t know.

I had to look into that basement. 

I arrived home. Grabbed a hammer and began striking at the place I had seen the door. Sure enough, it was solid, but it seemed like they were old bricks, so they rapidly fell apart. I energetically hit them, more than once repeatedly. A hole was starting to form as I could hear the bricks falling through the stairs. So there was a basement after all! I lash out once again, the construction crumbled completely, taking me with it. I rolled through the stairs and hit my head on the floor, passing out. 

I woke up in the dark minutes later, probably with a concussion, but I didn’t care. With the help of the little light that came through the door, I found the switch, and soon I could take a look at my surroundings. 

Right beside were I fell, there were bones, bones that belonged unmistakably to a human! The skull, still had hair around it, but the femur, I realized, was broken in half. 

In that moment, I was sure of it. That was surely my missing grandma, the one my mother and aunt never spoke about. 

She was dead, and her remains were below me all this time. 

I can only imagine what might have happened, since both of the witnesses are dead, I have no one to confirm my theories. But with my knowledge I can tell you what I think happened. 

My grandma, Grace, must have fallen through the stairs like I did, but she probably didn’t have the same luck as I did. Hse had fractured her leg, unable to get up or walk. 

My aunt, seeing her there, helpless, would take revenge upon her, doing the same thing she once did to her daughters. She locked her there. 

Complete darkness, a broken leg, no food. My grandma died not long after. 

It was obvious that the police would arrest her if they found out she had done nothing to change her mother’s destiny, so she covered the basement up and filed her as missing. 

Basing it sorely on my visions, this happened not long before my mom contacted her, hence the smells. My grandma would’ve been around 48 at the time. 

At the moment, I was still processing everything. But I knew exactly what I had to do. 

Go to the authorities? No.

I had to get rid of her bones or she would never leave me alone. 

The work is now done and I’m on my way to buy bricks and cement. For the first time, I feel safe in my own house. 

I wish I could talk to my auntie one last time and tell her that I still love her, and that I understand her decision. That woman was the devil, and she deserved what she got. 

Now her secret dies with me, and with you. 

Thanks to everyone who commented trying to help, I appreciate it.
