I knew that my actions would catch up to me one day. My hedonistic wallowing for the last two years, my self-neglect, my disregard of any responsibility, has finally turned round and bitten me. I know repeated exposure over the years has probably desensitised me to gore, but this is something else entirely, I know that now. The visions won’t leave my dreams, the stench of rot won’t leave my nostrils. I can’t sleep without hearing its wretched voice gurgling against my eardrums; pleading with me to carry out its purpose. I know that it will soon break me, that I’ll have no other choice but to surrender to its desires. And I have no other way to fix my wrongdoings, other than to warn others. If you ever find a website called carcass, DO NOT GO INTO IT.  

My first visit to the site was over a week ago. For the last two years, I’ve been a nobody, a recluse living in a small apartment by myself. I don’t go out nearly as often as I should, I work a dead end remote job, and most of my social interaction is online. Like any other person in my predicament, I made a habit of scouring message boards, social media, anything that would provide some sort of input to my dulled dopamine receptors. I even started using a tor browser to find things that I wouldn’t have been able to on the Clearnet. The deep web is really not that scary when you know what you’re doing; it’s basically a slightly more secure version of the internet. I heard about carcass through a message board on there, some off brand deep web imitation of 4chan which I’ve forgotten the name of. Id been scrolling the paranormal board, trying to find any websites or scary stories or esoteric theories that might keep my brain occupied. I found the usual schizoposts and discussions about the occult, until one thread stuck out at me. It read: 

‘Fuck LaVeyism, Hermeticism, Satanism and all that other horseshit! Come and commune with the REAL MOTHER OF ALL MOTHERS! Come and gaze upon the carcass of the Old World, and join us to bear the fruits of the Next!’  

Underneath was the typical 32 character string of a .onion site. I figured it was another schizopost, or some kind of obscure cult trying to recruit misanthropic edgy teenagers on the deep web. Nevertheless, my nail scraped the keyboard as I clicked the link. The site loaded in surprisingly quickly; pop ups littered the edges of my screen, obnoxiously pulsing with loud, brightly coloured animations. As my eyes adjusted to the flashing images before me, I realised that they contained saturated pictures of dead bodies, both human and animal. They were all in different states, some were burned, some were in advanced stages of decomposition. Great, another shock site. My ‘edgy teenager’ hypothesis was starting to seem more credible. 

The description of the site read: 

“Welcome to carcass.onion! When so much suffering exists in the physical world, its hard to not look for redemption in the metaphysical. For centuries, people have tried to find justification for their own mortal suffering, through religion, through philosophy – and they’d be right, in a sense! The answers DO lie beyond our bodies, beyond our souls, beyond our feeble comprehension. But the catch is, how do we guarantee our happiness after life? How do we feed the metaphysical? How do we comprehend the incomprehensible? 

OUR MOTHER who has no name has shown us the path; will you trust us to illuminate yours?” 

I mean, the kid who wrote this was obviously creative. I just wish they’d put their talents into, I don’t know, college or a job or something rather than this degenerate bullshit. 

I scrolled down, revealing the usual distastefully named posts one might find on a gore site.  

‘Jam spill’ in which the viewer sees the aftermath of a shotgun suicide. ‘King Chomp’, a video of a crocodile attack. All things that appealed to my morbid curiosity, that disgusted me, but made me feel something, anything other than the boredom that always lurked in the four walls of this apartment. But the contentment was momentary. As it always was.  

I continued to scroll until I reached the end of the page, and arrived at a heading. 

‘Video of the day!’ it read – ‘1 Peter 2:2 – a bastard is born under our mother’s wing!’ 

Almost involuntarily, I proceeded.  

The website automatically went to fullscreen. Uncomfortable with the notion of this website overriding my tor browser, I fumbled to press my esc key. The moment I did, a pop-up immediately appeared. ‘NO. Now you bear witness.’ Well, fuck. Admittedly unsettled, I pressed on.  

The video appeared to be CCTV footage of a barn. Static wiggled across the footage as the camera focused on a dark mass in the near corner. I couldn't tell what it was a first; its grotesque disproportionate shape made it difficult to discern. I eventually forced a resemblance in my head; It was a horse, but it still appeared... wrong. Its joints bent at random angles, its legs kinked and twisted. The muscles on its flank bunched up in a tight mass that clung to its oversized body. Its torso was humungous and bloated, almost egg shaped, cartoonishly inflated beyond the proportions of the rest of its body. It lay on its side, presumedly too malformed to stand.

Then I heard the muffled acoustics of a man’s voice, speaking in a language I didn't understand. His voice was taught with emotion, which grew to desperation as the grotesque creature’s abdomen swirled and contorted. I watched in horror as the beasts belly split open, and expelled a large beige-coloured mass. The static subsided to reveal a woman, limp and weak, now lying in a pool of blood and afterbirth on the harsh hay. The man ran into frame, cradling the emaciated figure in his arms and weeping. However, this weeping wasn't pained. It was relieved, almost joyful. I looked back at the horse, its torso sunken and deflated like a rotting pumpkin. I stared at the grisly scene, unable to take my eyes off what i was seeing, until the browser exited Fullscreen again, surrendering its control back to me.  

It took me a moment to even begin to rationalise what I'd seen – realistically this must have been special effects for some indie horror movie that never saw the light of day, or some ghoulishly accurate ai generated shit. It took me a second to register that there was another pop-up on my screen.  

‘*That is not dead which can eternal lie,*   
*And with strange aeons even death may die.*’ - HP Lovecraft 

*Get fucked*, I thought, shutting down my browser. I didn't want to admit to myself that some edgy kids' art project had shaken me up. 

It took two hours and a melatonin pill to finally send me to sleep. My dreams were peppered with the visceral images id seen, and I woke up unsettled. This probably wasn't helped by the fact that my computer now appeared to have some sort of virus. Tabs on my browser were opening and closing, and my screen became littered with txt files filled with bible verses and doomsday ramblings. I swore at my screen, how had my browser been compromised so easily? My tired eyes scanned the screen in a last ditch effort to find a way out. Another pop-up appeared. 

‘You seek retribution through any means but the one presented. Why?’ 

I tried to click out again, to no avail. Another pop-up. 

‘Those who don't give will be taken instead.’ 

My inner monologue sounded louder upon reading this, almost palatable in my mind. Images began to flash on my screen, more mutilation and viscera and things I couldn't comprehend in the short time I had to process them. I unplugged my computer from the wall, but the images only persisted in my mind. 

At first, the next few days were better in a sense. Not having a computer meant I had to find other ways to entertain myself; I tidied my apartment, even went on walks. But the words and images I’d seen kept flashing across my mind. They’d come when I least expected it, seeping across my schemas like treacle, burying themselves into the crevasses of my brain. They echoed in my dreams, snipping my rest short. And they began to tell me to do things.  

They were small things at first, like intrusive thoughts, but louder, more urgent. Smash your phone, put your cutlery in the microwave. In my sleep deprived stupor, the voice became all too real. I started doing the things it asked. When it asked me to smash my phone, I did it. When it asked me to buy a gun, I did it. 

And when it told me to kill the fox I found on my walk, I did it.  

Each action was rewarded; the voices would stop. Every little piece I cut off from the mundanity of my life was another offering to quiet the screaming chatter in my skull. 

But now I can't give it what it wants. It wants human life. I cannot bring myself to fulfil this task, and now it is punishing me. It took two xanax for me to sleep last night, and i fear even that won't work tonight. All I can hope for is that someone stops me before I do something terrible. 

O' mother, O’ mother, I wish to sleep.
