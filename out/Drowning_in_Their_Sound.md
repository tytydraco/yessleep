My name’s Alex. I’m the first chair clarinet in my school’s Advanced Band.
I’ve been in state honor bands, I practice for hours a day, and I know exactly how to make a room sing.

I needed a place to practice my audition solo — somewhere quiet. A friend mentioned this old abandoned pool in the woods where he and his buddy used to sneak off to smoke. I figured if it was that secluded, it’d be perfect for my sound.

So, one afternoon, I took my clarinet and walked fifteen minutes through the trees until I found it.

The air was heavy and sour, like old water and moldy chlorine. The pool itself sat sunken in the middle of a cracked concrete deck, its surface lined with graffiti that wasn’t quite… normal. There were shapes that looked more painted than sprayed — visible brushstrokes like an artist’s breakdown. Waves of black and purple coiled across the floor, and the walls were etched with symbols that looked ancient. Words in red Xs and slurs surrounded them like they were mocking something sacred.

When I stepped inside, the acoustics were unreal. I played a tuning note, and the sound bloomed around me — sharp, pure, echoing back like the pool itself wanted to sing with me. The reverberation was flawless. Perfect. Almost… alive.

I couldn’t help it — I smiled. This was my kind of space.

I flipped to my favorite solo, Canon in D. It’s written in cut time, slow and graceful, but I tend to take it faster when I’m locked in. I raised the clarinet to my lips and let the first note spill out.

The echo hit like a wave.

Each note bounced back through the air, wrapping around me, swelling. The reverb built until I felt it in my chest. My legs tingled, my hands trembled, and with each phrase, I felt myself sinking deeper into the sound — like the pool was filling, note by note.

Halfway through the first run, a chill climbed my spine. The air felt thick, heavy, wet. I stopped for a second to adjust my reed and noticed something glistening on my hands. Water.

Then came the footsteps.

Soft. Wet. Right behind me.

I turned so fast my ligature nearly flew off — but no one was there. The sound stopped, but the air still rippled with its presence. I told myself it was just my echo, maybe a delayed reflection. I forced a shaky breath, lifted the clarinet again, and kept playing.

Bad idea.

The faster I played, the worse it got. The acoustics didn’t sound natural anymore — they were following me, doubling my rhythm like something was playing along. The reverb hit too early, too heavy, and the air pressed in on me. I tried to slow down, but my fingers kept moving. My body wasn’t listening.

When the solo reached its fast section, my breath caught. It felt like I was underwater, lungs burning, but I couldn’t stop pushing air through the instrument. Each inhale was a gasp — each exhale a choke. The runs blurred into one endless phrase, a drowning rhythm. My feet squelched in something cold.

I looked down.

The floor of the pool was wet. The water was creeping upward, just enough to cover my shoes — then my ankles — then my shins. But there was no source. No drain, no leak. Just rising, silent water.

Then I saw it — movement inside the reflection. Something shifting with the rhythm of my notes. The water wasn’t just rising; it was listening.

My tone cracked, and for a second, the echo stopped responding. Then it came back — not as my sound, but as something else’s. A lower note. A growl beneath the melody, like something singing from the bottom.

I dropped my clarinet and ran for the wall, slipping on the slick surface. The water surged faster now, slapping against my knees. I clawed at the edge, but the weight of it pulled me down — heavier and heavier like it wanted to keep me there.

And then I realized — the water was breathing. It pulled when I exhaled, surged when I gasped, matching me like a living lung. Its pulse was steady, patient. Hungry.

The drains burst open, spraying torrents that filled the pool faster than I could climb. It reached my waist. Then my ribs. I kicked against the slope, muscles screaming. The water’s pressure grew thicker with every second, dragging me toward the center. I felt hands — cold, liquid hands — wrapping around my arms, pressing against my back. Not invisible. Formless. The water itself was holding me.

I screamed, but it came out as bubbles. For a second, I thought I was gone — that I’d end up a sound, trapped inside the echo.

I don’t know how, but I got out. Just barely. My palms tore against the edge as I dragged myself over the lip. When I rolled onto the cracked pavement, I saw it — my clarinet. Still standing upright in the center of the pool, untouched.

Then it fell.

The water hurled it upward, launched it out of the pool. It hit the ground beside me with a wet thud, bell first.

I ran. I don’t even remember where I dropped the clarinet, just that I tore off my soaked jacket mid-sprint because it felt like it was pulling me back. By the time I reached the main road, I couldn’t hear anything except my pulse.

When I got home, I peeled the rest of the wet clothes off and left them by the door.

If you ever find a place like that — a pool that sings back — don’t play for it.

Because when I turned around… the clothes were gone.
And then I heard my front door creak open, and the sounds of wet feet approaching my door.
