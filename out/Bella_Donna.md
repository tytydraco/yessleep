Would you stay if she promised you Heaven?

Would you even try?

I do not know what to believe anymore.

What was my purpose? What did I do? And what becomes of us after we die? Do we go onto our hereafter, whatever that may be, or do we cease to exist? As a Catholic, I believed in the answers provided by the Church for those questions, or, at least, I thought I did.

I did not always have these doubts about death and the afterlife. In fact, I had once embraced them, in a way. I believed death was the way that led us to God and His everlasting love in Heaven. That was my message. Death was not to be feared. I carried that with me as I volunteered at hospitals and care homes. I wanted everyone to know they were cared for and loved as they passed from this world onto the next.

Not now.

When I think of death now, I can only envision myself lying in bed, abandoned and forsaken by the world. My breaths grow more shallow until they stop completely, whilst my heart slowly stops its rhythmic beat. As I die in that empty room, I am alone.

All alone.

That terrifies me.

All of this started after my neighbour died following a long battle with cancer.

My neighbour, who lived in the apartment below ours, entered hospice care after her cancer returned and metastasized to her brain. A nurse would come each day to manage her symptoms with medication and help her with basic tasks. When her nurse was not there, I volunteered to help Ms. Martin, particularly meeting her spiritual needs, since she was unable to attend Mass. We read the Bible, we prayed the Rosary, and I would accompany our pastor after Mass on Sunday back to our apartment building, where he would give her Holy Communion. Ms. Martin and I grew stronger as friends whilst her body weakened and her mind faltered.

As I unlocked my bicycle from our stand, I stuffed Ms. Martin’s grocery list into my pocket.

“Do you need anything else?”

“No,” she answered. “Nothing else. Thank you.”

“You’re welcome, Ms. Martin,” I replied.

With a wink, she said, “It’s ‘Maud.’ You know me, Kitty. No need for formalities.”

She smiled, and she waved me off as I bicycled to the grocer’s in town.

After I returned from the grocer’s, I delivered her groceries, put them away, and we prayed the Rosary. When we finished praying, I made tea for the two of us. As we sat on her couch, we sipped from our cups of tea, whilst we talked with each other.

Despite her condition, Maud was always in a good mood. She endured her pain and suffering with the patience of a saint. She was still young at forty–five years of age, but she had no fear of her impending death. She was a devout Catholic, and she found comfort and courage in her faith. My own views on death notwithstanding, I did not know exactly why Maud was so comfortable with what amounted to an expiration date on her life.

As we talked with each other that afternoon, Maud finally confided in me.

“May I tell you something?”

“Yes,” I answered. “You can tell me anything.”

She raised her eyes heavenward, smiled, and she returned her attention to me.

“Thank you, Mother,” she whispered. Before I was able to ask what she meant, she continued in a low voice, “Did you hear her?”

“What do you mean?”

“Her voice. . . .” She trailed off. “Did you hear her?”

I heard nothing.

After a moment of hesitation, Maud asked again, “Didn’t you hear her voice?”

I did not hear any voice other than her own.

“Who are you talking about?” I asked.

“Mother Mary,” Maud beamed. “She came to me, Rhiannon, when I needed her most.”

“What?”

I started to feel a gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach, but I did not exactly know why.

“Do you remember the day I told you my cancer had returned?”

“Yes,” I answered. “The 25th of March.”

“The Feast of the Annunciation,” Maud added.

“I don’t understand. . . .”

“That night was the first time I saw her.”

Unsure of how to proceed, I stammered, “Did she say anything?”

“‘Do not be afraid. I came from Heaven,’” Maud answered. “Her voice was full of grace and love. I’d never felt as I did. It was as if her voice penetrated my soul and told me the truth about everything I’ve ever felt in my whole life.”

There was a certain lustre in her eyes as she told me about her vision. I felt a gnawing sensation start in the pit of my stomach. It startled me to see and hear how much this vision impacted her. She completely believed she saw the Blessed Virgin Mary. Yet I realised what I believed or did not believe happened was unimportant. I could see how much all of this meant to her. And I could not take any more from her, so I simply nodded as she continued speaking.

“I saw her for a minute, but it felt like forever. She asked, ‘I have come to ask you to offer your sufferings to God. Are you willing to do this?’ I answered, ‘Yes, my Mother.’ She started to fade away. Before she was completely gone, I asked, ‘Will I go to Heaven when I die?’”

“What did she say?”

“‘Yes.’”

There was a brief pause.

“Do you believe me, Kitty?”

Although I felt that gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach, I dismissed it, and I answered, “Yes, I believe you.”

It was the first time I lied to her.

Whilst I believed she was seeing visions and hearing voices, I attributed them to the multitude of medications she was prescribed. I did not believe she was actually seeing the Blessed Virgin Mary or hearing messages from Heaven. The most logical explanation was opioid–induced hallucinations. That had to be it. *What else could it be?*

After Maud confided in me about her alleged visions, they began to increase in frequency. Every day, I would visit her apartment, and I would invariably find Maud kneeling in front of her shrine, praying her Rosary, and she would tell me another message that the Blessed Virgin Mary gave her. There was little difference between the messages in her visions – *Offer your sufferings to God.* *Suffer for sinners.* *God is pleased with your offerings.* I started to dread whenever Maud told me about another message from Heaven. *Does God only want her to suffer?* Suffering has a purpose, but Maud’s suffering seemed to have none other than to cause her physical and spiritual harm.

A couple of weeks later, I walked into Maud’s apartment to check in on her, and I found her writhing on the floor. She was holding her face in her hands, her half–open eyes rolled back into her head, whilst moaning in ecstasy. I was terrified, but I tried to help her anyway. She could not be moved. As I prepared to call an ambulance, Maud suddenly returned to her senses. When she saw me standing over her, she smiled.

“Kitty,” she said. “Oh, Kitty, I’ve never felt so close to God.”

As I helped her onto the couch, I asked, “What happened?”

“I don’t know if I can explain it,” she answered. She made herself comfortable as she continued, “I was one with love itself. No more pain or suffering. No fear. Only love. . . .”

Before I was able to ask another question, Maud mumbled, “I feel empty now.”

With that, Maud fell asleep. I placed a pillow underneath her head and laid a blanket over her. As I left her apartment, I watched as Maud comfortably slept, but her words reverberated in my mind — *I feel empty now.*

On the following day, Maud and I were praying the Rosary when she had a vision. She looked up with that lustre in her eyes, and she spoke, inaudibly, to her Lady. When her vision ended, Maud looked sad, and I asked, “What did she say?”

Turning to look at me, Maud answered, tearfully, “‘Suffer, daughter, suffer very much. It is pleasing to God. Suffer the pains of Hell in this world, so you may not suffer them in the next.’”

The gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach returned as Maud told me what her Lady said. *Suffer the pains of Hell.* Why should she suffer the pains of Hell if she was going to Heaven? It did not make sense to me, but I did not say anything to Maud, because I did not want to upset her. After we finished praying the Rosary, I helped her into bed, and I left her apartment.

In the morning, I was feeding stray cats around our apartment building when I started to think about Maud and her visions. Although I could not name a specific reason why, I felt profoundly uncomfortable when I thought of them. *Why would God want her to suffer the pains of Hell?* It seemed to go against what I was being taught in Catechism. *What if that is simply her cross to bear?* I did not know what to believe. After I finished feeding the cats, I heard a crash coming from Maud’s apartment.

Concerned for Maud and her welfare, I ran into her apartment, where I found her on the floor, unconscious, bleeding from a wound on her forehead. It appeared as if she fell and hit her head on an end table. I called for an ambulance, which came as Maud started to regain consciousness. She was treated by the paramedics, who examined her for any other signs of injury. The paramedics did not find anything, but they said she was malnourished and dehydrated. They wanted to take her to hospital, but she refused. After the paramedics were assured Maud would be taken care of and left, I sat Maud down on her couch, and I asked her a question.

“Do you remember how you fell, Maud?”

In an attempt to evade my question, Maud asked, “Did you feed our kitties, Kitty?”

“Yes,” I answered. “Please, answer my question.”

“I don’t know,” she answered. “I’ve been fasting. . . .”

“Why would you fast in your condition?”

“To suffer more.”

Appalled by her decision to fast in spite of her health, I decided to look over her medication. It looked untouched. *Had she stopped her medication?*

“Are you still taking your medication?”

She did not answer.

Concerned, I dialled her nurse on the telephone in her kitchen.

“Hello?”

“Hello,” I said. “My name is Rhiannon Fitzgerald. I am calling on behalf of Maud Martin.”

“Yes?”

“I was wondering if you’ve been out,” I answered. “I haven’t seen you in a couple of days.”

After an awkward pause, her nurse said, “Ms. Martin dismissed me last week.”

*What?*

“Did she give a reason?” I asked.

“No.”


There was another awkward pause before she asked, “Is there anything else?”

“No,” I answered. “Thank you. Goodbye.”

After I returned the telephone to its cradle, I walked back into the front room where Maud was sitting on her couch. I asked her, “Why did you dismiss your nurse?”

“God told me to do it.”

In the absence of her nurse, I made sure Maud safely resumed eating, drinking, and taking her medication. She still looked weak, but there was more colour to her face. I put her to bed, and I left her apartment. *Why would God want Maud to wantonly risk her life?* None of it made sense, so I went to see someone whom I believed would be able to make sense of it.

As I walked into my parish, I crossed myself with Holy Water and genuflected to the Tabernacle, and then I walked to the parish office. The pastor, Fr. David Murray, was sitting at his desk when I knocked on the door and entered.

“Hello, Ms. Fitzgerald,” Fr. Murray said.

“Hello, Father Murray,” I replied. Sitting in one of the chairs in front of his desk, I said, “Thank you for meeting with me. I don’t know, Father, but I think you’re the only one who can help me.”

“What is your problem?”

After I told him about Maud’s alleged visions and messages from Heaven, Fr. Murray looked pensive. He was trying to find the words for his answer. Eventually, he said, “Her visions and messages are indeed a cause for concern.”

Although I was relieved Fr. Murray believed me, I was scared by the fact that he agreed Maud’s visions and messages were a cause for concern.

“Can you explain?”

“If you recall Scripture, St. John writes in his First Epistle, ‘Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God,’” Fr. Murray answered. “Has Ms. Martin tried this supposed spirit?”

“No.”

“Has Ms. Martin expressed any concerns?”

“No,” I answered. “What scares me, Father, are the messages from the spirit that seem contrary to the Faith. Some of its messages have even caused Maud to despair.”

“‘Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God: and every spirit that dissolveth Jesus, is not of God,’” Fr. Murray recited. “Are you afraid that the spirit might be evil?”

“Yes, I am.”

“As St. Paul wrote in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, ‘Satan himself transformeth into an angel of light,’” Fr. Murray recited. “It is certainly possible that the spirit, if there is one, could be evil.”

A chill went up my spine.

Stammering, I said, “I don’t understand, Father. Why would an evil spirit be attracted to Maud? She’s one of the holiest people I know.”

“An evil spirit would be attracted to Maud because of her holiness. Satan does not want sinners, whom he has already claimed, but saints, so they will be separated from God forever, like he is,” Fr. Murray answered. “Her condition makes her even more susceptible.”

“What do you mean?”

“Evil lies in wait. It waits for an invitation. The purpose of demonic obsession and oppression is to break an individual down and possess them. Maud makes an ideal candidate for demonic oppression. She is not only holy, but she is dying. She is easier to break, because she grows weaker–physically, mentally, spiritually–by the day. An individual must be broken, a crack must form in their soul, for the smoke of Satan to enter in.”

As we concluded our conversation, Fr. Murray assured me he would discuss the matter with the Bishop. I left the parish office, and I bicycled back to my apartment building. Entering Maud’s apartment, I saw her in bed, praying silently. She had a pallor to her skin, and her legs and feet were mottled with purple splotches. Her pulse was fast and her breathing was shallow. She did not have much time left. I walked toward her, and she flinched when I placed my hand on her shoulder. She opened her eyes, and she looked frightened.

“Who are you?”

“It’s me, Maud,” I answered. “Rhiannon.”

“Kitty?”

“Yes,” I nodded. “It’s Kitty.”

“She came to me again,” Maud said. “Mother. . . .”

As she trailed off, I asked, “What did she say?”

“‘It is almost finished,’” Maud recalled. “‘Soon you will receive your reward.’”

Before I was able to say anything, Maud cried out, “Mother, help me. . . . Please, stay with me, please.”

I started to cry as I listened to her pleas for her Lady to stay. Placing a chair at her bedside, I sat down, and I held her hand in mine.

“Rhiannon,” she whimpered. “Don’t go.”

As tears trickled down my cheeks, I was torn between belief and disbelief — *Was she receiving visions of the Blessed Mother, or was she being deluded by Satan?* I did not know. I wanted to beg her to hold on, but what if I would only prolong her suffering?

Maud looked over at me, and she whispered, “One more Rosary?”

With tears in my eyes and a quiver in my voice, I nodded, and said, “Yes.”

Maud and I started to pray the Rosary. In the middle of one of our Hail Marys, a brilliant light enveloped Maud’s bedroom. The familiar lustre in her eyes returned as she prayed, “Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, poor sinners. . . . Poor sinners. . . .”

As she sat up in bed slightly, Maud announced, “She’s here.”

And I was able to see her.

To my astonishment, I was able to see the form of a woman, who was dressed in a white gown with a blue mantle and sash, her face obscured by the brilliance of the light surrounding her.

Although I could not see her face, I was able to hear her say, “Come and receive your reward, good and faithful servant.”

With a dreamy smile on her face, Maud collapsed onto her pillow, lifeless and limp.

She was dead.

Through tears, I looked at the Lady before she faded away completely into the light. At her feet, which were covered by the bottom of her gown, roses, lilies, and violets bloomed, but in the centre of the bouquet, there was a sprig of belladonna flowers.

Although I saw and heard everything with my own eyes and ears, I was still consumed by doubt. *Was it true?* I did not know. *Was it false?* I did not know. *What did I know?* I had no answers for the questions I asked, and I was racked with sobs over Maud’s body.

A week later, Fr. Murray celebrated Maud’s Funeral Mass at our parish, and she was buried in the adjoining cemetery. The mourners dispersed soon after her coffin was lowered into the earth, but I remained at her grave to say goodbye.

As I prepared to leave, I heard a voice in the wind.

It sounded like the Lady.

“Rhiannon. . . .”

*Could it be?*

I turned around, but I could not see anyone else in the graveyard.

*Mother Mary?*

When I turned back around to Maud’s grave, I saw a fresh sprig of belladonna flowers placed on her headstone.

As I pondered the meaning of the beautiful yet poisonous plant, a flood of memories of Maud came over me.

Her battle with despair. Her rapid physical, mental, and spiritual decline. Her immense suffering. Her lonely death, abandoned and forsaken by the world.

All of it began when she started seeing a beautiful Lady, who would never show her face, even to her.

I felt paralysed as a familiar voice spat directly into my ear.
