Baba has warned him many times. Yet, despite all the scolding, and threats, Horen Master keeps coming back.

In the evenings, during power cuts, when everything is dim and dusky, Horen Master knocks on the front door. A very polite kocking - only three taps in a particular rhythm.

I’ve never studied under Horen Master. He used to teach my two elder brothers - Raju and Somu.

I’ve never seen them either.

They were gone before I was born. People say Horen Master took them.

Where he took them - I don’t know. Bapi never talks about it. If I ask, he just glares and snaps.

“Why the hell do you need to know all that for? Don’t you dare open the door if Horen Master comes…”

I follow Bapi’s words. I obey him like a good child.

Whenever Horen Master knocks, Bapi shudders. He draws the curtains tight. He grabs me roughly and whispers, “Hush! Not a sound. Go... Hide under the bed…”

Ma stifles her sobs with the loose end of her saree.

Horen Master eventually stops knocking after a while. Sometimes he scratches at the window of the study room.

At midnight, Bapa climbs to the old attic - a tiny room on the roof. I’ve never been inside that room. A rusted lock always dangles from the trapdoor’s latch.

One night, I tiptoed behind Baba. I pressed my ear against the attic door.

I heard Bapa sobbing. He was weeping, whispering through tears, “O Somu… O Raju… where did you go, my precious boys…”

Something knotted up inside my throat. I fled back to my room.

Then came that stormy Kalboishakhi evening.

Ma and Baba had gone to see my sick grandpa at Howrah hospital. They were supposed to return by dusk. But dusk passed into evening. They didn’t return. A wild storm swept in with a roar. I ran around the house, closing every window and shutter.

Then I sat down in the outer room with a comics - and was about to turn the pages - when lightning struck the betel-nut tree in the courtyard with a deafening crack. It burst into flames. The power went out at the exact moment.

I lit a candle. The latch on the front door rattled gently.

That rhythm. It was so familiar. I knew it. I knew who that could be.

Horen Master was back.

Three soft knocks.

I froze. After a couple of sets three knocks, he stopped. I was about to leap up in relief when, from beyond the closed left window, a rough voice rasped, “My child, are you alone tonight? Is Baba not home?”

Sweat beaded my palms. My throat turned dry as dust.

“Open the door, Khoka. It’s terrible weather outside. I’m… I’m a good man. A schoolmaster. I… I taught your brothers…”

I said, “No. Baba told me not to.”

Over the storm’s howling, I heard Horen Master plead, “Open up, Khoka. Mastermoshai will adore you so much...”

I screamed, “No! I won’t open the door! no! no! Go away…”

There was silence for a while. The wind outside started to calm. The world felt still, too still.

Then came the scratching. Horen Master was clawing at the wooden window of the study. The sound was like a spatula scraping a milk pot - shrill, sharp, grating. As if someone were dragging claws along the bones of my ribcage.

I dashed to hide under the big bed in my parents' bedroom and curled up in the darkness. Eyes shut tight, hands pressed over my ears, I stayed there.

Then a faint whimpering. And silence again. The chirp of crickets began.

Late at night, I heard the key turn in the front door. Ma and Baba had returned. I ran to them.

Baba listened to everything and pulled me into his arms.

He said, “Bravo my boy! He’ll come again. Remember... Never, ever open the door to Horen Master…”

Years afterwards, when I returned to that house, Baba was no longer alive.

It was another Kalboishakhi night. I hadn’t slept a wink. My son, Ved, was curled up against me, fast asleep.

I got up and went to the attic. The door was ajar. No lock anymore. In the musty darkness, sat an old tin trunk.

Worm-eaten picture books, old notebooks, Alphabet Mate, Aesop's Fables.

On one notebook, in crooked handwriting of a child, was written: “Raju Roy.”

On one of the back pages, in large, clumsy, misspelled letters, was scrawled:

“When Baba isn’t home, Horen Master touches me. He tells me to take off my shorts. He tells Somu too. I will tell Baba. Somu says not to. I am scared.”

On the next page, scribbled in dark oil pastel, was a tall figure in dhoti and kurta. Two black cavities where the eyes should be. Claw-like nails on the hands. Underneath was written: "Horen Master."

From the ground floor, Ved called out in his tiny voice, “Papa, where are you? I’m scared.”

I ran down the stairs. Held him close to my bosom.

Just then, the front door latch rattled gently. That old familiar rhythm .

Veda asked, “Papa, who’s come?"

I whispered in his ear, “Promise me, buddy... If Horen Master comes, DO NOT open the door.”
