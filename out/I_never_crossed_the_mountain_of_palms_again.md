I don't know if anyone here knows the northern area of ​​Formosa. Over there, the planting of sweet potatoes is the most common, and what I am going to tell happened to me in one of those fields where that tuber is worked.

I was helping with the harvest. To get to the field you had to cross a fairly closed palm forest. It wasn't very long, but it was dense, full of shadows, and at night it was impressive. Still, no one would think that one could get lost there.

That day the boss invited all the harvesters to stay for a barbecue dinner. I hesitated a little, because I knew that returning late through the mountains was not a good idea, but in the end I stayed. There was music, laughter, wine... and it was later than I thought.

When I said goodbye, I took advantage of the fact that a colleague was going the same way. We entered the mountain together, but soon the darkness became so complete that we couldn't even see the ground. There was no moon, it was a heavy night, the kind that crushes your chest.

At first you could hear the bugs in the field, the crickets, the toads, some birds. But little by little, everything went away. It was strange, as if the mountain itself had run out of air.

I don't know how far we walked, but it began to seem to me that we were not moving forward. I felt like we were spinning in the same place. The air became thick, humid, with the smell of old earth. And there something grabbed me in the chest, as if something wasn't right.

I stopped. And in that silence, I realized that we were not alone.
I didn't want to look back. But I heard a noise, branches breaking slowly. My legs were shaking. And when I finally dared to turn around, I saw a huge shadow rising between the palms. I can't explain it well... it was something that seemed to have a shape, but at the same time it didn't.

I didn't think, I just ran. I ran with my soul in my mouth, without looking back. I felt like something was coming behind me, so close that I could even hear the leaves moving. I ran until I suddenly saw the lights of the road.

A truck stopped, the guy got out and asked me what had happened to me. I, still with a choked voice, told him that I had come across a yarará. I lied. Because what I saw that night… it wasn't any mountain bug.

The next day I returned to work, but I couldn't even get close to the trail. I felt like the entire mountain was watching me. I told the boss that I was not going to return again. And I complied.

Until today, every time I pass through that area, I avoid looking that way.
I don't know what I saw that night, but I'm sure of one thing:
The mountain let me go out, just because it wanted to.
