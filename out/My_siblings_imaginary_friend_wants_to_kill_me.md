Something grabbed my leg at the pool.

I was on my last lap—just doing a leisurely breaststroke—when massive fingers wrapped around my thigh and dragged me down.

I squirmed and tried to get away, but the fingers were wrapped tight. They had some form of *suction cups.* My ensuing struggle attracted the attention of the lifeguard. As soon as he came to my aid, the massive fingers let go.

The guard believed me when I said that something had caught my leg. He inspected the area. But all he could find was a pink plastic wristband.

“That’s not what pulled me down,” I said.

He shrugged and put on the wristband.

\*\*\*

In the locker rooms I swear I could hear something walking around, making large, squishy, *plodding* sounds. I stayed hidden in my change room, waiting for the sounds to stop.

From beneath the change room curtain I could see wet footprints. I could literally see large, towel-length *footprints* appear on the ground—out of nothing.

Of course it freaked me out. And of course I gasped out loud.

Before I knew it, the curtains opened and closed on their own.

I was cornered in the back of the changeroom.

I let out a half a scream before invisible wet fingers wrapped themselves around my face. My head was shoved against ceramic tiles.

Fear froze me completely.

A hot breath arrived, smelling like moldy fruit. Then a voice came. It was high pitched and squeaky, choking a little on its own words.

“No need to be scared. It's just me. JUMPY!”

Like a chameleon, the skin of the creature slowly solidified into gray. One of its eyes was the size of my head. I would say it looked like one of those red-eyed tree frogs, except it was nine feet tall and it could easily kill me.

It switched from holding my mouth to pressing its sticky fingers against my throat. “Remember me? Remember *me*?”

*‘No’* seemed like the wrong answer, so I just repeated the name it told me. “...Jumpy?”

“YES! YES!” The creature jumped up and down—still holding me by the throat. If I hadn't grabbed hold of its fingers, it might have hung me on the spot.

“Jumpy! Jumpy Frog! That's me!”

I was dropped to the floor as it started to clap. The massive webbed hands created a deafening applause.

“Marie-Anne and Jamie *made* me when they were babies! I was their best friend!” The frog jumped onto a wall effortlessly and peered down at my struggling body. “Every day I was with them—every day I helped them!”

It was referring to my older twin sisters, who died last year in a car accident. Part of the reason I was out swimming so late is because that’s how I’ve been coping with their passing. We all used to do synchronized swimming for many years.

“But now they’re gone… They're gone! How terrible is that?!”  The frog sounded like an overdramatic, sad cartoon. It teared up, and pounded the very wall it was climbing. “And now, no one believes in Jumpy!”

I was still recovering, breathing through a pinhole, but that didn’t stop Jumpy from hoisting me by the leg.

“You’re the only Whitaker sister left! You *have* to believe in Jumpy!”

It felt like I was speaking through a tiny straw. “*Have to*?”

“Yes! Can’t you see? I’m fading! I used to be green for frog’s sake!” Jumpy shoved its forearm against my face. Some of the gray slime stuck to me.

“If you don’t believe in Jumpy … I’ll die! And I don’t want to die!”

The frog crawled to the ceiling and dangled me by the leg, high above the marble floor. “You have to believe in Jumpy! You HAVE to!”

If I landed in the wrong way, I could easily break my neck, or skull. I forced myself to sound happy. “I believe in Jumpy, I believe in Jumpy.”

For the first time in the entire encounter, the creature treated me like a porcelain doll. I was gently lowered to the floor, and then patted on the head.

“Good. Keep believing in Jumpy. Think about Jumpy every day.” The frog made a gagging sound, then leapt back to the ceiling, leaving wet marks along the wood. “And if you stop believing in Jumpy, don’t worry … I’ll come back to remind you!”

The frog smiled in a way that made its giant eyes bulge and look in two opposite directions. I thought for a second it had a tongue lolling out of its mouth, but I peered closer, and could make out a human hand in its lips.

A human hand with a pink wristband.

Jumpy slurped it up.

\*\*\*

Since that encounter I’ve basically been in a permament state of fear, praying that Jumpy never visits me again.

I’m an animator so drawing is a hobby of mine. I’ve drawn countless sketches of Jumpy and left them around my house, my work, on my phone, etc. Not a day goes by without me seeing a picture of that frog.

I believe I’m fulfilling my promise. I’m thinking about Jumpy every day. But I also haven't slept properly in like … months.

I’d like to stop thinking about the frog. But that also sounds terrifying.

I’m pretty much forced to think about my worst fear all the time.

Its wearing me down. I’m so exhausted…
