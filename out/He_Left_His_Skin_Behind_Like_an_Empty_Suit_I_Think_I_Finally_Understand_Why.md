**CAPSULE** 

While in a cramped internet café capsule in Tokyo, I heard strange, wet noises from the booth beside mine. 

A slick, slithering sound, followed by something peeling, tearing—like a wet glove being turned inside out.

I cranked up the volume on *Tentacle Prison 4: The Warden’s Revenge* to drown it out. The sound design was high-budget depravity—squelching, slapping, exaggerated high-pitch gasps—but at least it was expected. The reality on the other side of the thin capsule wall was not.

I didn’t sleep much. The noises stopped around 4 AM. Silence settled in, sticky and unnatural.

By morning, the café’s cleanup crew had gathered around capsule #17, whispering in fast, clipped Japanese. 

The air reeked—salt, iron, something faintly acidic. As I squeezed past, my gaze flicked inside.

A man’s skin lay on the mattress. Neatly folded. Completely intact. Like a discarded suit.

But his body was gone.

Something in me buckled. A small, primal part of my brain refused to accept what I was seeing. The details etched themselves into me regardless—the careful arrangement, the soft pooling at the wrists and ankles, like he had slipped out of himself.

I left Tokyo the next day.



**HOME**

Back in Europe, everything felt smaller, duller, and more artificial. 

The streets were familiar, but the people looked thinner, stretched out like their skins didn't fit quite right.

I quit porn. Or tried to. But my brain had been rewired—a mosaic of flickering thumbnails, auto-play loops, and clickbait depravity. 

I’d scroll for hours, watching nothing. Hunting for something.

But nothing was enough.

I stopped going out. Stopped talking to people. 

My phone became my companion, my window into worse and worse places.

I started seeing ads I didn’t remember clicking. Private forums. Invitation-only streams. “Live Experiences.” Some with Japanese titles.

A message arrived in my inbox. No sender. Just a link. 

I clicked.

The page loaded slowly, deliberately. A video player. Thumbnail: capsule #17.

I hit play.

It was him. The man from the café. Naked. Trembling. Kneeling on the mattress. 

A wet sound. Familiar sound. His skin split.

Not cut. Opened. Voluntarily. Peeling from his back like a curtain drawn aside. 

And then—Something stepped out.

The man wasn’t gone. He had just left himself behind. The thing that emerged turned toward the camera.

It had his face.

But it was smiling.



**THE SHEDDING**

I stopped leaving my apartment.

Not out of fear. More like—detachment.

The world outside felt unreal, like a poorly rendered background in a game. 

The air smelled wrong. Sounds were muffled, like cotton stuffed into my ears.

All I could think about was the video.

That thing stepping out of itself. The freedom in its movements, the relief.

The video disappeared after I watched it. Refreshing the link led to nothing. But the messages kept coming. At random hours of the night. No sender. No subject.

Just instructions.

Stretch your skin. Press your fingers beneath it. Feel the looseness—the way it peels so easily from the muscle beneath.

I stopped resisting.

I don’t know why. Maybe I was already halfway gone.

Maybe some part of me had always been waiting for this.

I started pulling at the skin of my forearms, and my stomach. It didn’t hurt. Not the way I expected.

It felt natural.

Like loosening a collar that had been strangling me for years...
