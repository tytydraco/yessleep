Well, it finally happened. The worms infected a person. 

Yinz remember that PSA I gave about avoiding deer meat until this epidemic was resolved? Yeah. 


(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

This now marks the fourth after hours emergency call I've joined Victor on. It was Reyna's first. She picked me up, since I'm still looking for a replacement car (someone down the street is selling a Jeep Wrangler that I have my eye on. Just need him to call me back.) I eyeballed the water gun she had sitting in the back seat. She explained that it was filled with saltwater. 

“You can make fun of me if you want, but it'll make a Neighbor think twice!” She insisted. 

“I wasn't going to make fun of you, I was going to say that it's a good idea!” Then I read the name written along the barrel. “But maybe you shouldn't have gotten one called 'The Squelcher?'” 

She sighed, “It was a dollar, okay?”

On the way there, Victor caught us up over the phone. 

For background, our local authorities know about the deer problem and strongly advised locals to avoid hunting until the epidemic is eliminated. However, one hunter decided he wanted to risk it all for some venison steak. His elderly father - our client - didn't participate in this worm-infested bounty due to a doctor’s restrictions on red meat. A few hours later, the deer hunter complained of an upset stomach. Thinking it was just indigestion, he took a shot of Pepto and tried to sleep it off. 

In the wee hours of the morning, the client was awoken by the sound of something heavy falling to the ground, followed by his son yelling. The client, not being able to move well on his own, got his cane and went to check on his son, then had to use that cane to defend himself against the worm that tried slithering out from beneath the crack in his son's closed door. The client took cover in his bathroom, standing in the bathtub out of fear that the worms would try to reach him from under the door again. 

We all rushed to the suburbs. Victor was the first to arrive. Reyna and I got there to find that he'd trapped the infected man in the bedroom with a line of salt. From inside, wet choking noises could be heard that made my stomach clench. 

If anyone is curious: yes, this *is* my worst fear come to life. 

“Client's still in the bathroom.” He told us. “One of you should check on him, make sure he hasn't been bitten. Not sure what to do with this guy yet.”

I knocked on the locked bathroom door, announcing, “I'm with Orion Pest Control. Have you been hurt, sir?” 

The old man sniffled in a way that made my heart ache, then shakily replied, “I'm alright. What's happening to my son? Is he…?”

He couldn't finish that sentence. I assured him that we were working on it and asked if he'd want one of us to take him somewhere safe. He refused to leave, insisting that he wouldn't abandon his son to face his fate alone. Eventually, I was able to convince him to move to his sitting room, administering salt to the entryway to ensure that nothing could get to him. At least he had somewhere more comfortable to sit while we tried to figure that mess out. 

When I approached the hall, I overheard Reyna asking, “Weren't they able to treat that dog that got infected? Do we know what they used?”

Victor replied, “Yes, but they were able to get to it before the dog started showing symptoms. The worms hadn't reached maturity yet. Unfortunately, we're past that point with this guy.”

Reyna absent-mindedly toyed with her hair as she thought hard, “Okay… so the worms are vulnerable to salt, we know that much. What if we could get him to ingest it?”

The client's son banged around in his room. He alternated between furious howls and guttural growls. 

Victor gave the door a pointed look and said, “You think he'll cooperate?”

Reyna let out a deep breath and shrugged. “We'd have to hold him down and at the risk of sounding like a total wimp, I… don't really want to get close to him. At least not without gloves and full body armor.”

“I could go back to the office and grab the tranq gun.”

I informed Victor, “It won't work. The first time I found an infected deer, the tranq didn't do shit.”

Still watching the door as if prepared for the client's son to bust through it like the Kool-Aid Man, Victor replied, “Alright, so knocking him out is out of the question. I don't know if the worms can get into me, what with my condition and all, but I'm not sure any of us want to find that out the hard way.”

“Wait. A saline.” Reyna then muttered. “Instead of the sedative, why don't we fill the tranq darts with a saline solution?”

Victor considered it, then shrugged. “It's worth a try. The office isn't far, and we have a bottle of wound wash that we could use.”

While he went to take care of that, Reyna and I were tasked with standing guard to ensure that the client's son couldn't get out. He sounded like a trapped animal, bellowing and thrashing around in his room. 

Glancing in the direction of the client, who was slumped on his couch with his face in his hands, Reyna whispered, “If my idea doesn't work, I also know of some plants that can be used to treat intestinal parasites. Unfortunately, I won't be able to get them until the shop opens up, and even then… that's just for like, tapeworms. I don't know if it’s effective for Hell worms.”

Glass broke. We looked at each other briefly, sharing identical expressions of wide-eyed fear before I raced outside to make sure that it wasn't the window. 

Guess what? It was the fucking window. 

When I saw the client's son lean out of it, I gagged. Long strings of foamy drool flowed from his pale wet lips, clumping his orange beard. His eyes were wide with a wild sort of confusion that reminded me of a rabid coyote that we'd dealt with back in April. His face shone with sweat in the dim light from his room. 

I took out the salt shaker from my belt and swung it in an arc. Grains of salt hit the side of the house, causing the infected man to flinch away from the broken window. Ideally, it would be best to put a line on the windowsill to keep him inside, but it was going to be hard to get close enough to do that. He was already trying to get out again. 

His mouth dropped open with a nauseating gurgling sound. One of my nightmares became a reality as I saw a pink worm starting to squirm out of his throat like an extended tongue, its jawless, toothy mouth visible as it stretched towards me. Its host grunted painfully, eyes bulging as another worm fought to get out of his mouth. 

Like the big hero that I am, I muttered out loud, “Oh, *fuck* no!”

I salted the nearest worm, causing it to retreat back into the man’s gaping mouth. 
I just had to keep this guy from leaving. The last thing we needed was for him to infect someone else, especially if that someone else was me. 

Reyna came out, holding her water gun in both hands. She squeezed the trigger, spraying saltwater through the open window, forcing the infected man to jerk back. Any time he'd try to get close afterwards, she'd pull the trigger again. 

This tactic may sound goofy and I'm sure it would have looked ridiculous to anyone that witnessed it, but hey, it worked. Looks like I'm going to have to invest in a Squelcher, too.

Headlights. Against my will, I thought back to when the mechanic had found me on the side of the road. To my relief, it wasn't him; Victor was back with the tranquilizer gun and a case of darts filled with 0.9% saline. 

Of all the things that would make me antsy, it seems so strange that headlights would be one of them. 

Victor took aim with the tranquilizer gun as the infected man approached the window again, then fired the saline shot. 

That's when everything went wrong. 

The worms tore out of his throat with a grotesque sucking sound, leaving their host doubled over the windowsill with blood pouring from his mouth, eyes staring vacantly ahead, eyelids and hands twitching. 

Without a word, Reyna rushed back into the house as the worms flopped onto the ground, writhing aimlessly without their host. Victor sent me to help Reyna as he finished them off. 

I came in to see that the client's son was now having a seizure. She'd placed a blanket under his head and was in the process of trying to gently turn him onto his side. I called for an ambulance. 

The client called through the hallway, asking what was going on. Guilt contorted Reyna's face as she watched over his son. Trusting her to keep an eye on him, I went out to sit with the old man, not sure what I was going to tell him. 

Before I could say anything, the client teared up. I held his hand as he silently wept. 

Fortunately, the ambulance got there quickly. By that time, his seizure had stopped. He was unconscious, but still breathing. The old man rode with him to the hospital, refusing once again to leave him alone.

Reyna blamed herself. There was no way that any of us could've known that the worms would react like that. We still know so little about them. Unfortunately, when it comes to the atypical, sometimes it takes some trial and error to figure out what works and what doesn't. Sometimes these ideas pan out, other times… not so much. I told all of her this, but I know from experience that it'll take time for her to realize it. 

Welcome to being an Orion employee. 

The client called us back the next morning, informing us that the worms had ripped a hole in his son’s large intestine during their hasty exit, so he had to undergo emergency surgery. Initially, when I heard this and the tone of the client's voice, I feared the worst, but thanks to the wonderful people in the hospital, the man miraculously survived. He has a long recovery ahead of him, but it's better than the alternative. The client thanked us, his voice catching, then hung up before I could say another word. 

Reyna almost collapsed from relief when she heard the good news. 

In town, word spread quickly about the man who ended up in the hospital after consuming infected venison, so hopefully that’ll keep other people from making the same mistake he did. 

In the meantime, Reyna's making it her mission to figure out how to deal with the worms without harming the host, so she's been trying to get into contact with the Department of Wildlife to see if they know anything that we don't. There has to be a way to remove those things safely. We just have to find it. 

Speaking of trial and error, I've been focusing on the Weeper. 

Something I'd been thinking about is that she has to be near her river at all times. What if she kept some of her river with her? Did the water matter more or the location?

In order to test this, I visited her a few days after the worm incident, bringing a canteen that I found at Goodwill for three dollars with me. It was big enough to hold a decent amount and when I washed it out, I tested it to find that it didn't leak. It even came with a neck strap for carrying convenience. 

When I found her, she was sitting on the riverbank, turned away from me, staring into the water as it rushed around her bare ankles. 

I sat cross-legged next to her, asking, “What was your life like before this?”

Gaze distant, she replied, “I'm afraid that I don't remember much. I've always just… been here.”

“How long has that been? Do you know?”

She shook her head. As per usual, her eyes were red and irritated from crying. As much as I hate to admit it, I've had crying spells like that before. The kind that make your sides hurt from sobbing so hard and your temples throb well into the next day. 

After thinking for a moment, my next question was, “The first garment you ever washed. What did it look like? We might be able to discern how long it's been from that.”

The Weeper frowned at me, “What is the point of this?”

“I’ve looked back in our records and I may have a few ideas of how to get you out of here. However, whatever method we try will depend on how you got here in the first place. If there's anything you can remember, it’ll help.”

She sighed, tilting her chin up thoughtfully, closing her eyes in concentration. Her face screwed up in frustration, then she shook her head again, “There's nothing.”

The Scottish tradition came to mind, making my stomach do a somersault. How in the hell was I supposed to bring that up? It’s not exactly a casual topic of discussion. 

She frowned at me again, “Are you that agitated? You're flushed.”

Sure enough, my cheeks were warm. Wonderful.  

“I am?” I replied dumbly, trying not to sound flustered. “Oh, it's not because of you. I’m not agitated. I’m just… thinking about one of the methods I read about.”

She continued to stare at me. I looked away, wanting to crawl out of my skin. 

Still not able to meet her eyes, I stammered, “There's no good way to say this, so please bear with me. In Scottish records… actually, you know what? Nevermind. We'll start with my other idea.”

Yeah, I chickened out. We’ll save *that* method as a last resort. 

I held up the water bottle. She furrowed her brows at me, not understanding. After removing the cap, I held it beneath the surface until bubbles stopped floating from its open mouth, then handed it to her. 

“Try walking away.” I told her. 

The Weeper went from being unsure to curious. She rose from the bank, then took an exploratory step forward. Then another. With each step, she looked more and more cautious.  

Eventually, she turned and gave me the first truly joyous smile I'd ever seen from her. She began to laugh, a surprisingly girlish sound that I'd never expected to hear from her. Her arms wide, she twirled, the wet edges of her skirt flying around her like the petals of a black flower. 

The Weeper brushed a lock of white hair from her beaming face, saying, “I've never been this far before!”

As nice as it was to see her so happy, I wanted to be truthful with her, “It's not a permanent solution, unfortunately. The water will evaporate, eventually, so that'll need refilled from time to time, but it's at least a start.”

Thankfully, that information didn't seem to dampen her mood. “That's more than what I had before.”

When I got up to stand beside her, she did something else I didn't expect: she threw her arms around my neck, pulling me into a tight embrace that genuinely knocked the wind out of me.

Struggling to breathe, I gingerly wrapped my arms around her, debating on if it would be rude to ask her to loosen her grip. I decided that I could handle it for a few seconds longer. She was so cold. With the heat of the day, it felt nice.

When she loosened her hold on me, I tried not to make it too obvious that I was eager to get air back into my lungs. 

“Let's see how far you can go.” I said once I'd recovered. 

The answer was pretty far. We got to my apartment without her feeling the pull of the river. She explained that whenever she'd tried to leave previously it felt like there was a vicious tug on her innards, as if the river had a leash connected directly to her lungs. It was normally agonizing for her to even attempt to go farther than the bank. 

I then asked her about the violent Weeper incident I'd mentioned in my last post. She said that Weepers can only leave if it's necessary to complete their duties as seers of death. She also confirmed that another Weeper had been responsible. That one is tied to a pond and is reclusive even by Weeper standards. 

She glanced around my apartment, eyes large as if I'd taken her someplace wonderful. I suppose to someone who lives in a river, even my mediocre, outdated living space must look like a palace. 

“Would you like me to get you something warmer?” I offered. “My clothes might be a bit big on you, but I'm sure it'd be nice to wear something dry.”

She gave me a demure smile. “That would be lovely.”

The coziest clothes I could find were a black crew neck sweater that read ‘HELL IS REAL’ (I got it passing through Ohio), sweatpants that were definitely going to be too long for her, and a pair of wool socks. No one ever accused me of being a fashionista. However, the Weeper accepted them without complaint.

After she'd changed, she asked about cleaning up the dress she'd been wearing only to be shocked to learn about the invention of the washing machine. When I showed it to her, she narrowed her eyes at it suspiciously as I showed her how to use it. Judging by the way she stared at it, I think that she was expecting the thing to chomp down her dress in one bite. 

“This gets the clothes clean?” She asked skeptically. 

“Most of the time.” I said. “Some stains are more annoying to get out than others, though.”

“All it does is spin the clothes in a wet circle. How could that possibly be more effective than scrubbing?”

I shrugged. “The doohickey in the middle scrubs it… sort of. Just let it do its thing and then judge afterwards, alright? Give yourself a break.”

The Weeper still looked doubtful, staring at the machine in disdain, but didn't comment further as I pressed ‘start.’ 

What sold her on modern appliances wasn't the washing machine, but the dryer. Once I removed the blanket I'd thrown in with her dress and draped it over her shoulders, she seemed content. No one can resist a blanket straight from the dryer, not even Neighbors. 

Where all of that laundry talk brings us to is what I woke up to at midnight. 

At some point, I must've dozed off, still trying to get my energy back after a week of illness and injury. When I woke up, the Weeper wasn't in the blanket cocoon that she had been in when I'd passed out on the couch next to her. 

I noticed that my broom was placed next to my front door, the salt line interrupted. She'd set it perfectly upright, a common way of warding off malevolent spirits down south. At least she'd taken the time to protect me before sneaking out. 

I went out to search for her, but I didn't have to go far. She was singing softly, her voice mournful. It was hard to hear, only audible once I passed close to the laundry room. I found her sitting in front of the washing machine, her canteen of river water still slung over her shoulder, her pale hair and skin illuminated by the red glow of the pop machine right by the entrance. 

*“Agus airiú, 
Agus anauiridh, níl duin ar bith agam,
‘S airiú…”*

Equally as confused as I was concerned, I approached her, asking her what was going on. 

The Weeper turned her head to look up at me, eyes shining with tears. 

Uneasily, I looked closer at the washing machine. Reflective yellow vests, the same ones construction workers wear to catch drivers’ attention, all spun together in a wet clump. I couldn't tell how many there were exactly, but the machine was shaking from the heavy load. 

Carefully, I asked, “Can you tell me who they belong to?”

Seemingly entranced by the bloodied laundry as it spun, she rasped distantly, “The shepherd of the forest will come to protect its flock. The sun will set over red soil.”

Shepherd… Could she be talking about a False Tree? They're extremely territorial, protective of the forests they call home. While they don't inherently harbor ill will towards humans, they can be extremely dangerous when they or their homes are threatened. 

“Is this happening right now?” I asked. 

She shook her head slowly. 

So we had time. Good. We were going to need it, if I was right about what we could be dealing with. 

The next morning, I told my coworkers about the Weeper’s premonition. After scouring the local news, we found that the suburb was planning to expand with construction starting at the end of the week, despite protests from locals. Everyone that’s lived here long enough to be aware of the Neighbors knows that this will end horribly. 

It wouldn't be so bad if the people running that development actually gave a damn, but they appear to think the Neighbors are just small town superstitions. Easy for them; they aren't the ones that have to deal with the repercussions. 

We figured out where the construction site was, deciding it would be safest if all three of us attended. False Trees get stronger as they age, though it should be noted that young ones are formidable enough. As such, we make sure not to use violence. False Trees are essentially spirit of the forest given form. They are not to be taken lightly. That being said, they can be reasoned with. 

Some general advice when it comes to dealing with False Trees is to always be respectful of their homes. If yinz find yourselves feeling like you're being watched while alone in the woods, do your best to stay calm. They’re judging you, making sure that you're not up to any trouble. They'll let you continue on your way unharmed as long as you prove that you're not a danger to them or the forest they inhabit. 

Beforehand, we made a pit stop to get an offering for the False Tree in the hopes of appealing to it: lamb meat. According to our records, those that had to venture into the woods would sacrifice one of their flock to be granted safe passage in the forest guardian’s home.  

We parked the company truck some distance away from the construction site, not wanting any trouble, especially since there were allegedly already attempts to sabotage construction by locals. Before we entered this section of the forest, each of us asked for permission to enter. There was a gentle, pine-scented breeze in response. That meant that we were welcome, at least for the time being. 

We left the lamb meat offering on the trunk of a fallen birch tree. Reyna said a prayer over it for good measure. 

The first bad omen we'd encountered had been the Weeper’s. The second was when we found a hammock tied to two trees. Reyna and I glanced at each other in confirmation. Both of our hagstones reacted. 

The hammock wiggled as its occupant sat up, revealing that it was Briar, still in his gray Dubnos Towing work shirt, holding a book open in his hand. He looked just as thrilled to see us as we were to see him. 

“I'm not here for you.” He said, not hiding his irritation. “You don't bother me, I won't bother you.”

Victor curtly replied, “Works for me.”

I could still feel his eyes burning into my back as we kept heading towards the construction site. 

Once we were out of earshot, Victor whispered, “They're like sharks. They smell blood in the water, they circle.”

Reyna shuddered. I advised her not to look back at Briar. The last thing we needed was to worsen the situation by provoking him, especially since he'd expressed interest in her in the past. I doubted that interest had conveniently fizzled out. 

As we kept going, we saw a construction worker in his hard hat and bright yellow vest wandering around. The man looked disoriented, his head turning from side to side as he took in his surroundings. 

“I have no idea how I got here.” He said when he saw us. 

False Trees like to lead people astray. Sometimes this is done merely as a prank, other times it's a warning. 

Victor scanned the trees surrounding us as if he expected one of them to move at any possible movement. It was a reasonable concern. In turn, Reyna was shifty, clearly growing anxious. Meanwhile, I kept thinking back to the vests in the washing machine, wondering if his had been one of them. 

The worker started to ramble nervously, “I was *just* at the site! I walked in a straight line! How…?”

I calmly assured him, “We can lead you back to where you need to go. The woods can be misleading, especially if you're unfamiliar with them.”

After I spoke, I felt a cold chill take over my chest. The False Tree was watching. I resisted the urge to look around despite the paranoia that was gripping at my heart, knowing that it wouldn't reveal itself unless it wanted to. 

The construction worker nodded quickly, his eyes still flitting around as he followed us. 

Victor asked, “Did you follow a voice? Or hear any whistling?” 

The worker looked even more confused, “Well, I heard one of the guys whistle, just messing around, so I whistled back. Don't know what that has to do with me getting lost.”

Victor, ever the people person, didn't sugarcoat it. “Yeah, that wasn't your buddy that you whistled at.”

“What are you- Hold on. What's going on?!”

That feeling of being observed wasn't going away. It was following us, listening. 

Victor abruptly stopped, casting his gaze at something in the distance. 

He raised his voice, keeping his tone polite, “Is this man permitted to leave?”

A strange groaning echoed throughout the woods, like the creaking of an old tree being felled, changing in pitch as the sound went on. A chorus of growls rose around us, joined by the shrieks of angered birds. 

I resisted the urge to sink into myself. The worker's breathing quickened beside me, his eyes huge. He crept closer to Reyna and I, afraid, but trying to hide it. 

Victor hissed to the man, “I know this sounds strange, but you need to put your shirt on inside out and backwards. *Right now.*”

The worker swallowed nervously, sweating as he did as he was told. While he did the same with his work vest, Reyna suddenly jolted back, her eyes fixed on something. When I followed her gaze, I saw a flash of black fur that was far too large to be a coyote. 

Like many other Neighbors, the False Trees can appear in many forms, the first being - you guessed it - a tree, one of the other common disguises being a bear, and another a bearded old man. 

The ominous groan gradually turned into a deep chuckle. When angered, one of the few things that can spare yinz from a False Tree's wrath is to make it laugh. For whatever reason, they find a human wearing their clothes incorrectly to be peak comedy. Or they just enjoy seeing terrified people desperately try to appease them in any way possible. 

The noises began to fade, though the feeling of being watched did not.

Without another word, we promptly began walking again. Nothing obstructed us, but the air felt thick. This wasn't over. The construction worker was shaking the entire time. 

When we found the construction site, the worker sprinted away before any of us could say something, making a beeline towards a man with a clipboard. This man looked like he thought himself to be extremely important, possibly the most important person in the forest. 

The False Tree's awareness was crawling along my skin. The air felt even heavier as it took in the progress of the construction. Trees felled. The ground gutted. The odor of hot oil tainting the air. 

*This is going to be a bloodbath.*

While I couldn't hear what they were saying over the roar of machinery, the man with the clipboard's face turned red, waving his arms animatedly as he argued with the worker we'd found in the woods. The worker's face turned white, then he abruptly turned and walked out, the clipboard guy shouting at his back. 

That worker would be one of the lucky ones. 

Clipboard guy did a double take when he saw us, then marched over. 

Victor grumbled, “Here we fucking go…”

Clipboard guy yelled, “You can't be here!”

Victor stepped forward, “I'm with Orion Pest Control-”

Clipboard guy interrupted, “I can read your jacket, asshole! So why the *fuck* are you here?!”

*Well, aren't you pleasant?*

Victor's expression didn't change despite the man’s hostility. “This site is dangerous. There's an animal prowling nearby that becomes extremely violent when exposed to this kind of work.”

“Is this supposed to be a joke?! Get the *fuck* off my site before I call the police!” 

Victor abruptly yanked down his bandana, showing off his slit throat. The man's face went from bright red to pale as he backed away. 

“You think this looks bad?” Victor said, pulling it back into place. “This animal I'm talking about will do worse. If you and your crew don't want to end up like me, you'll leave right now.”

While that would've convinced me and most normal people, clipboard guy apparently had no sense of self-preservation. He shouted again that he was going to call the cops on us. 

Reyna whispered, “What do we do now?” 

The False Tree didn't give Victor or I time to answer. It had seen enough. Its home was being desecrated and it wanted someone to pay for it. 

Over the sound of construction equipment, I heard that telltale deep groan that had resonated through the trees earlier. I silently reached for the fire poker on my belt. Victor saw me and shook his head at me. Reluctantly, I took my hand off of it. 

The sky suddenly became much darker as the shrill cries of birds became overwhelming. I looked up to see that their wings blocked out the sky. Coyotes yipped and cackled as they surrounded the site. From the corner of my eye, a lumbering shape darted past. 

The shape turned out to be an extremely pissed off black bear. 

Trying to stop the animals wouldn't stop the attack. They were following orders. We had to find the one controlling them. My coworkers and I hurried off to find the False Tree as all of the animals converged on the construction site at once, a vicious flurry of fur, feathers, and teeth. Screams rose from the site behind us as the workers were subjected to the full force of the forest's anger. 

It had to be nearby. It had to be close enough to watch what was happening.

Things would've been so much harder without the hagstones. Reyna spotted it first, point out one of the tallest pine trees I'd ever seen. 

Keeping the desperation out of my voice, I called out to the False Tree, “Shepherd of the forest, may we have a word?”

The False Tree's eyes opened, glowing an eerie shade of green. Its pine needles began to resemble a bushy beard as the shepherd revealed itself, towering over us even as it crouched to get a better look at us. Squirrels poked their heads out of its beard, their small faces scrunched in accusation. 

The tree’s voice boomed as if the earth itself spoke through it, “I have no quarrel with you. You may leave.”

Victor asked, “And the crew?”

The False Tree bristled, “They drew the blood of my flock, so I will draw theirs.”

I asked, “Is there anything else that can be done to satisfy this blood debt?”

“Your offerings and prayers are appreciated, but no amount of lamb will be enough to replace what has been lost.” The tree replied sternly. 
 
Victor then asked the question I was afraid to hear the answer to, “If we try to help them, will that implicate us?”

The tree did not hesitate. “Yes. It is best that you left.”

Reyna and I glanced at Victor, her not even attempting to hide her horror. He couldn't seriously be considering leaving these guys to die. No. He could be, if he thought that this False Tree was more than what we could handle. 

I don't know why, but after besting a member of the Wild Hunt, I had been beginning to think that things would be different. That we were now magically capable of handling more than just home infestations. But that was stupid. We’d *barely* survived the Hunt, saved only by the mechanic being bored and egotistical enough to agree to give us that hint. 

Victor thanked the False Tree for allowing us to converse with it, then started heading away. Reyna and I followed.

Reyna whispered, “We aren't just… going to walk away, are we?”  

Victor half turned, his voice low, “You two are. I can't die, may as well use it for something.”

Even though I hated the idea of leaving him alone to try to save whoever was left, I didn't waste time arguing. We couldn't afford to. 

When we’ve encountered False Trees in the past, we’d occasionally been able to talk them down, but this False Tree was angered beyond reason. Tangling with it while it was in this state would be a suicide mission. 

With the screams at our backs, I guided Reyna back in the direction of the company truck. I clenched my teeth, telling myself that if I died with them, it wouldn't help anything. Try telling my conscience that, though. 

I wish I could say that the nightmare stopped there. 

Halfway to the truck, we heard heavy breathing and footsteps behind us. It was the clipboard guy from earlier, covered in blood that may or may not have been his. It was hard to tell. 

As Reyna started to approach, he cried out in agony as he fell to the ground. 

Black thorns wrapped around his ankle. Briar had found who he'd come here for.

Instinctively, I stepped forward, but then Reyna’s fingers dug into my shoulder. I saw then that Briar had left his hammock, standing with his arms crossed over his chest, eyes fixed on me, silently daring me to try him. 

“We can't interfere with the Hunt.” I reminded myself numbly. “Not unless we want things to get bad again.”

Clipboard guy reached for us. Thorns shot from the ground, pinning his wrist. More coiled around him like snakes, leaving gashes where they touched his skin, tearing at his clothes. When he cried out, they slithered into his mouth, his screams now coming out wet and grating as the thorns burrowed into his throat. 

This all happened in seconds. I didn't want to see it and couldn't watch any more of it, turning away to continue our journey back to the truck. I flinched when I heard a sickening tearing sound, then again when a warm liquid splashed across my back. Reyna had made the mistake of looking back and let out a horrified gasp that turned into a sob. I don't want to know what she saw. Her eyes were haunted and wide. 

*I'm sorry.* 

On the way back, I heard Reyna praying under her breath for that man, the others at the construction site, and for us. 

I hate cases like this. I hate failing like this. 

It wasn't a complete failure, I should make that known. We’d saved that man we found before the slaughter. Victor managed to get a few others out, but not without taking some punishment in the process. He’s going to be home for a few days to recover. 

Construction has been halted. Can only imagine why. 

In the meantime, I’ll be returning with more offerings for the False Tree. It's hurt, too. The only way we can stop more attacks like this is to rebuild our relationship with the forest. I'm also going to try to get in touch with that construction company, try to get them to reconsider. Maybe if they won't listen to the locals, they'll listen to someone who saw what happened to their workers.
