I sat in my stationary car, my knuckles clenching the steering wheel with a grip so firm I thought it might crumble in my fists. My phone was somewhere on my lap, on loud speaker to the emergency services. 

'Ok sir, they're on their way to you now. I need you to try to calm yourself down and describe to me what happened...'

My wife Angela and I had been having a "lovers tiff" all evening over every little thing, but the argument came to a head at bedtime. I was laying in bed in my pyjamas quietly watching a movie while Angela silently completed her nightly routine, making a great effort to not acknowledge my existence. A soft tapping sound from above my head pulled me from the movie. I practically dove out of bed when I looked up to find the cause of the noise. A large black spider slowly made its way along the wall, each movement of its long coordinated legs giving off a slight brushing sound. 

Angela glared at me. 'What are you doing?' With wide eyes, I point to the eight legged intruder. 

'Could you take it outside, please?' I asked her softly. Angela laughed. 'Pathetic,' she said coldly. 'A man of your age and size squealing like a little girl over a spider.' 

I'd always been scared of spiders, it's a fear I just can't shake. Angela knows I'm ashamed of this phobia, and is usually very understanding. But tonight, she chose to be mocking. 

'Could you get it for me please, I'll go get the cup and-' My pleading was cut off by Angela suddenly throwing her hairbrush at it. The hairbrush sailed through the air, bouncing off the wall and falling behind the bed, taking the spider with it.  

'There was no need for that.' I told her. Angela glared at me once again. 'What? I killed it, you can go back to bed now, you big brave boy.' She smiled sarcastically. I looked towards the bed. 'But the spider's under there now, you only knocked it down by throwing things at it, maybe we-' 

*'Shut up*!' Angela suddenly boomed, with a tone so full of rage I almost flinched. Angela took a breath, instantly looking remorseful for her unwarranted outburst. She opened her mouth to speak, but I cut her off. 

'I'm going to sleep downstairs tonight.' I told her, as I pulled on my robe and slippers and headed for the door. I left the room before Angela could say another word. Switching on the living room TV, I made myself a little camp on the sofa and continued watching my movie. 

I woke up at 7 in the morning, a small ray of sunshine lit up the room from a slight gap in the curtains. I stretched, turning off the TV which was now playing some random early shows. I felt a mild frustration that I'd fallen asleep before finishing the movie I'd been watching, but soon got up and decided to make coffee. 'I'll take a cup up to Angela so we can talk things out,' I thought to myself as I poured in the boiling water. 'She's an early riser so she'll be up by now.'

Armed with my beverages, I began to make my way up the stairs to our bedroom. I try to open the door with my elbow, making a lot more noise than intended. Finally, after a struggle, I managed to crack it open. 

'Angela?' I called into the dimly lit room as I slowly entered. 'Ange, are you up? I've got a coffee, I thought we should talk about-' 

The sight I was met with made me stop in my tracks. My eyes widened as I realised what I was looking at. 

A large, silky, bloody cocoon was strung above our bed, levitating my wife within. Crimson blood dripped onto our once white sheets, and flecks of skin and hair littered the bed. The only part of Angela visible was the top half of her head. Her crystal blue eyes, once shining with life, now stared desolate back at me. I dropped both mugs of coffee at my feet and began to back away, my legs shaking uncontrollably.

 Then, through the thumping of my heartbeat in my ears, I heard it. That familiar brushing sound, but this time much louder and more frequent. I forced my head to turn to the direction of the sound and I nearly fell out the door as I laid eyes on the cause. A hole in the ceiling around the size of a snooker ball, with multiple large black spiders slowly scuttling out. It was then I saw something more. From the hole, a large, grey, hairy leg the size and width of a candlestick emerged and began feeling its way around the opening in the ceiling. The creaks emitting from the floorboards above told me all I needed to know about its size, and I turned and fled. I almost tripped down the stairs as I sprinted for the front door, snatching my car keys off the counter in the hallway as I did so.

I ran across my driveway and flung my car door open before diving inside fumbling for my phone in the pocket of my robe. Hands shaking uncontrollably, I managed to dial the emergency line and hit loud speaker before my phone slipped out of my sweaty hand. I gripped the steering wheel, trying to get myself under control as I bellowed barely coherently into the phone my address and pleaded for help.

I'm currently staying with my sister and her family in their spare room. My first therapy session starts next week. Every slight brushing sound or crinkle of a bag has me bolting upright and the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. The police found Angela deceased in a woven cocoon as I'd described, and found evidence of an abnormally large spiders nest in our attic. No spiders were found. The coroner stated Angela had been fully drained of blood. 

One evening, I was sat in my sisters living room with her family, watching a movie on TV. In my peripheral vision, I saw a small, dark figure scuttle across the other side of the room. I leapt from the couch with a gasp, heart pounding and eyes wide as I began to lose control of my breathing, pointing in the direction of the dark mass on the carpet.

'I got it!' My brother in law assured me, as he ran to the kitchen to get a cup to remove the uninvited guest. My sister sat with me and held my shaking hand to console me as her husband rid the house of the unwanted creature. Her six year old daughter, too young to be informed of the horrific event which took place, looked up at me with a toothy smile and gave me an innocent giggle. 

'What's wrong, silly? It's just a spider...'
