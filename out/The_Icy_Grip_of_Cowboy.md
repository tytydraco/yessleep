As a child, I grew up in a 1995 original modular home about a mile from the river in the swamplands. Woods stretched far beyond our yard, whispering secrets of what lay ahead. Our large oak tree stood firm, its roots intertwined with the stories of the past, hinting at the history waiting to unfold. Near our land, hills are hidden deep within the woods, remnants of those who walked this earth before us. Their spirits rest quietly, but there's an air of expectation, as if they’re awaiting the right moment to share their tales. You know what they say about Indian burial grounds, right? They intrigue and warn, a reminder of the mysteries that lie beneath.

My parents often reflected on the land's challenges, believing it was cursed. The only thing that thrived was the flowers my mother planted. The soil seemed to reject any attempts at cultivation, as if it held a grudge against my father's gardening aspirations. The grass would tease him with a brief flourish before wilting away, leaving the garden barren. A cloud of darkness seemed to loom above the perimeter of the property, reinforcing the belief in a curse and the struggle we faced. 

As fall gradually gives way to winter's chill, the once vibrant landscape succumbs to a somber gray, as if draped in a heavy, oppressive shroud. The air thickens with a sense of foreboding, and our once lively household becomes steeped in an unsettling silence. The arrival of Christmas, often portrayed as a joyous time of celebration, casts a shadow over us, deepening our melancholic spirits. Even our pets seem to sense the change, their behavior subdued, eyes flickering with unease as they curl up in the room's corners, their fur standing on end like the bristles of a broom. 

Amidst this unease, a sinister presence stirs—a restless spirit of an ancient soul, mischievous yet ominous, awakened by the freezing ground. As the first frost blankets the earth, this entity begins to manifest in the subconscious of the living. Whispers of its tricks echo through the dreams of the unsuspecting. Nights turn into vivid escapades where children catch fleeting glimpses of the spectral figure, watching it dance through their dreams or gaze back at them from the shadows through their frosted windows. They believe this spirit's playful antics are harmless, interpreting his ephemeral presence as a sign of his return to the very earth that once nurtured him. But in their innocent misinterpretation lies a more profound, more unsettling truth—there exists a darker game afoot. The spirit's 'playful antics' are not as innocent as they seem, but rather a subtle threat that lingers in the air, a threat that we could not ignore. 

He delights in causing mild disturbances, like moving objects or creating strange sounds, intertwining curiosity with a subtle threat, reminiscent of winter's beauty wrapped in its icy grip. In a household filled with life and laughter, the spirit quietly picks its target, often drawn to the most vulnerable—perhaps the timid sibling or the wide-eyed child with a vivid imagination. With their untamed thoughts and dreams, it's as if these young souls catch the spirit's attention, making them both fascinating and susceptible to its mysterious allure. 

My siblings and I have always referred to him as Cowboy. Each winter, we endured a different season of his haunting presence. He yearned to be heard, and his rage and pain were palpable through the veil that separated the living from the dead. He was a tall, slender figure, dressed in traditional Western attire from the 1800s. His clothes, tattered and stained, were a grim reminder of his violent past. But it was his sinister grin that sent shivers down our spines, a grin that seemed to hold all the darkness of his soul. His long beard and the shadow cast by his cowboy hat always hid his eyes, as if he were looking down at us, not directly, a silent threat in his gaze. He must not have been a patient man in his lifetime, and he certainly was not in his afterlife.

One winter night, it was snowing hard. There was 3 feet of snow easily on the ground. My brother and I were watching TV in the living room when we heard a pounding on the door in our laundry room. We looked, and no snow had fallen to cause the pounding; there is no way snow could have created a sound that was impatient, hard knocking. There were also no footprints in the snow. My parents always complained about hearing people whispering in their bedroom, even though the TV was never on and they had no idea where the whispers were coming from.

In one dream, he had come to me with a fox in his hand that he had caught. He was skinning the fox in the front yard. He grinned at me and turned his body towards a specific area of the woods. He was trying to lure me in. He did not have to speak for me to know what he wanted. He wanted me to find what was hidden in the woods. Oddly enough, it was in the same general area that the window of the laundry room faces that my brother and I heard the loud banging on the door. There are no such things as coincidences.

One night, a cowboy visited my niece while she was resting in her room. She was not afraid of him, as he had a way of intriguing children's interest. My niece reported that he entered through her window and then vanished into the grass, which was his usual “home.”

Despite our fear, my brother and I were drawn to the secrets the wooded area had kept for more than a century. As we ventured in, guided by my brother's similar dreams, we stumbled upon a chilling discovery. Not too deep within the woods, we found the remains of a foundation, a silent witness to a home that once stood in this wooded area of the property. This discovery, shrouded in mystery, seemed to confirm the reality of the cowboy's haunting. We couldn't resist the urge to dig deeper, to unravel the enigma of this entity and understand why he returned every winter, as if to remind us of his existence. Why did he want us to find this foundation? 

We examined property cards and even found a painting of a wooden cabin that used to sit on the corner of the property, in the same place we discovered the foundation. 
The cabin had burned to the ground, leaving behind only the remains of the foundation and the Cowboy's broken heart, as he had lost his wife and children to scarlet fever. He burned to the ground with his cabin, and this was his family's last resting place. How could we ever put his soul at ease?

My brother and I consulted a medium, who had let us know that the Cowboy was a poltergeist disguising himself as the man who had died in the fire. We gained insight into "cowboy" losing his family to scarlet fever, and that the entity was evil, and we needed to work to remove his presence from our property. 

The Indians buried deep in the hills warned against the power this entity held. My brother, in particular, Cowboy, liked to disturb. The entity had followed us to the medium. The medium was fearful of the evil that the entity possessed and intended to come to the property to help us rid it of his presence. Still, it was so deeply rooted that she never got back in contact with us. 

My brother and I were devastated, unsure of what to do. The Native Americans had delivered a chilling message: anyone who passed away on the property was trapped there forever. They could never leave the land. This included our family dogs, which we had buried all over the yard. They were stuck in a state of limbo, unable to free themselves and move on. The cowboy’s hold was a firm one, and he would not release any soul from his property.

A "For Sale by Owner" sign sits at the edge of the property, as my parents were ready to move on from the grip of the poltergeist. We never received any closure, but perhaps the subsequent owners will find it.
