EVIDENCE ITEM #2009-447B

RECOVERED FROM: Brides of Christendom Compound, Mummuwurra Australia

DATE OF RECOVERY: 18 September 2009

CLASSIFICATION: Personal Effects - Journal

OWNER: Kirby Leedy (Missing Person Case #NT-2009-1184)

INVESTIGATOR'S NOTE: The following excerpts were recovered from a water-damaged Moleskine notebook found in the lower chambers of the New Eden Compound following the 2009 raids. Though partially degraded, forensics have confirmed the handwriting matches known samples from Ms. Leedy. Several pages show signs of exposure to extreme heat.

The last page indicates a noticeable deviation from Ms. Leedy’s handwriting style, suggesting a third-party addition. After forensic analysis, it was confirmed that this last entry was written in her own blood.

**11** **July 2004**

I’m in.

Fucking idiots.

Times must be dire if they're so desperate for new sycophants that they don't run background checks first. You would think they'd remember me with all the trouble I caused them years back. You'd think they'd remember the girl who stole away one of their own. I suppose I was a kid then—and I've shed a lot of weight since—but I'm irked. Perhaps I've flattered myself all this time, thinking I'd managed to draw blood. No matter. It works in my favor.

I’m here, I’m clear-headed, and I’m taking these fuckers down.

This is for you, Phoebe. I'm going to find out what happened after they took you back.

It was almost too easy. I dyed my hair back to its natural, mousey brown. Bought some second-hand, moth-eaten clothing and rolled the sleeves up, showing off my old self-harm cuts. Had to add some new ones to make it believable. Even all these years later—I'm a natural. Funny how muscle memory works—the blade felt like coming home. Top it off with slumped shoulders and a look of vulnerable, gullible naivety and they basically made a beeline for me. Nothing like a sad girl for an easy target.

‘Have you heard of our family, the Brides of Christendom?’

*Oh, you bet I have.* But sweet, impressionable Lindsey Adams (I even had an ID made) shook her head and was completely in awe of the lies they fed me. A permanent home of welcoming, independent women tired of the patriarchal shackles of society. A philanthropy-rich organisation, growing and donating their own food to those poor starving children in Yemen or Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo or whatever country popped up when they googled *'places with dying kids'* that morning.

After that, I sowed the seed. Couldn't raise suspicion by jumping onboard immediately. I played the part of the tempted mistress. I started popping by a couple times a week for chat, then every second day, then every day minus weekends. Then I took them up on their offers of church, sitting in the pews with a sappy, dogmatic look of growing fanaticism on my face.

Three weeks is all it took.

I was invited into a side room, and they were waiting for me. Three enormous women in those stupid white robes, holding out their arms and embracing me one after another. They smiled their wide smiles, chins multiplying, and invited me to their Australian compound. I swear to God, they called it their 'flagship' enterprise, as though their little culty town out in the middle of central Australia was some kind of retail chain. Like a Bunnings.

I’ve now been here for a grand total of eight hours, and here are my thoughts so far.

One, everyone here is super, ridiculously overweight. I know I sound like a dickhead right now—but you have to understand how out of place this is. It makes no sense—it averages thirty-three degrees celsius on any given day and you sweat half your body weight just standing still. Cars break down on the side of the road, aircons overheat and shut down. You spend your days swimming in billabongs or walking several kilometers to the nearest service station to stand in front of drinks fridge. There's also nothing to do—so you dick around with your mates and walk the mainstreet, or play ball on asphalt that cooks the bottom of your sneakers.

There's no cattle country out here, and supplies are flown in twice a week, so it's not like last-minute mars bars are a thing. Nearby jobs are almost exclusively mining and a good thirteen-hour straight drive through an endless expanse of sun-kissed country. Or there's government incentives for hunting pests—wild cats, camels and kangaroos. I'm painting this picture for you, because I wanna stress that it's really poor out here, and physical labour is just a way of life.

And yet, everyone on this goddamn compound is fat as all fuck. I'm not talking a couple extra kilos put on after an overly-generous helping of Christmas pudding—I'm talking Jabba the Hutt chunky. Which, when you consider the Brides of Christendom claim one of their core tenants is providing food for the poor— it's all a bit hypocritical. You'd think with all the notoriety they're facing these days, they'd pay a little more attention to their public image. Can't go using skeletal child soldiers as your poster boys when you're sitting around looking like you're downing a stick of butter every meal.

And that’s not even getting into the actual compound.

You ever seen Indiana Jones 4? Yeah, I wish I hadn't either. Anyway, there's this scene where Indiana Jones stumbles across this fake, cookie-cutter town that has been erected for the sole purpose of simulating a real life population centre before a nuclear attack. This is exactly what the Brides of Christendom compound in Mummuwurra looks like. Neat little houses with white picket fences, neatly tended gardens and clotheslines full of white robes and beige underthings. The church is this big, almost retro-looking 60s church—white, domed and tacky as all hell, with these weird symbols carved into the foundation stones.

My fellow brides of Christ zoom about the place on their little scooters, welcoming me to the compound and offering me welcome biscuits. They've given me my own little house, complete with a TV that doesn't connect to anything other than the local prayer channel, a huge fridge stuffed with all the trimmings, and a mustard-yellow lazy boy that groans when I sit in it like something's living in the stuffing.

But what really grinds my gears are the lawns. You ever seen a picture of rural, central Australia? I'll give you a hint. It's brown. There's rocks, there's red earth, and crystal blue skies—and any vegetation is prickly, dead or a combination of both. But these supposed Christ-ordained agents of frugality have lush, emerald-green lawns. A 24/7 reticulation system, complete with a hired agency from the neighbouring town to come by once a week under strict observation, to mow and whippersnip the curbs.

This place is *off*.

I've been told I'm not allowed out at night. I've already checked my front door—it locks from the outside. I've been told the warden comes around at 6am, and lets everyone out. So that's already given me a clue—night time is when the iffy shit goes down, so I'll need to think of a way to get out then and look around.

Anyway, I might as well try and sleep. It’s been a long day.

I’m trying to be realistic. I don’t think I’ll find Phoebe. I think she’s dead.

But I am hoping I’ll at least find her body.

**13 July 2004**

Two days in. I think I'm starting to lose my mind.

Everyone here is a Mary, Anne, or Katherine. For Warlpiri country, I’ve never been in a place so white in my life. I've met four Marys today alone, each more enormous than the last. I tried keeping track at first—Mary with the mole on her left cheek, Katherine with the neat, gummy smile, Anne who smells like vanilla—but they all blur together now. Same white robes, same placid smiles, same dead eyes. Even their voices are identical, this soft, breathy whisper that makes my skin crawl.

We spent today packing "care packages." Canned goods, rice, dried beans, cheap little plastic toys. Normal enough, except I've never seen any of it actually leave the compound. The loading dock where trucks should arrive is covered in dust and cobwebs.

When we're not doing that, we're tending to these sad little crops out back. Scraggly things that somehow survive the heat but never seem to produce anything edible. Not that it matters—our meals are these elaborate, decadent affairs. Today's lunch was butter-poached lobster and black truffle risotto. In the middle of the fucking outback. No one questions where it comes from.

Met the woman in charge today. Mother Bee *("that's B-E-E, dear"),* who runs this place like some syrup-sweet summer camp counselor. She's massive, makes the others look positively svelte in comparison. She touched my shoulder during morning prayer and her hand was fever-hot through the robe.

Being here, seeing all this—I can't stop thinking about Phoebe and what it must have been like growing up here. I think about that night she showed up at our door, soaking wet despite the drought, eyes wild and clothes torn. Dad was always a soft touch for strays, whether they were dogs or traumatized cult kids. Mom just sighed and made up the spare room. They didn’t report her, it was a kind of don’t-ask-don’t-tell agreement amongst my town to take in runaways from the Brides of Christendom compound. Even back then, people with half a brain and a well-honed gut know that place was up to no good.

We shared everything those six months. Clothes, secrets, my old walkman. But Phoebe had nightmares. Bad ones. She'd wake up screaming. Claimed she didn’t remember what she dreamt about. I thought it was just trauma, religious abuse playing tricks on her mind. One day, the Brides turned up at our doorstep, demanded we return Phoebe. We begged her, but she went anyway. Said she didn’t want us getting mixed up in all this, that New Eden wasn’t an enemy we wanted. I still remember her last departing look she sent me. Hollow, surrendered.

We left notes for each other in that dead eucalyptus tree, right where the dirt road splits between our towns. I did most of the talking—stupid shit about musics and TV programs and which high school I wanted to go to. She never told me much about Brides of Christendom. Maybe it was because it wasn’t safe to do so, but I got the impression that she just wanted to hear about me and my mundane, free, glorious life. She wanted to lose herself in the point of view of the friendly girl she’d met six months ago.

Then the notes stopped.

I called the police, eventually. Filed a missing persons report. They investigated and came back saying there was no record of a Phoebe ever living at the compound. No birth certificate, no school records, nothing. Like she never—

*Something just happened. My hand is shaking.*

There was screaming outside. Young, female. God, she sounded so young. There was a struggle—I heard feet scuffling on pavement, multiple sets. Then the scream began to fade, to the east I think... not away, but down. Like they're taking her underground.

My front door is locked. It's always locked at night.

I can still hear her. Getting fainter. Going deeper.

Phoebe, what happened to you down there?

**19** **July 2004**

Found one of the girls trying to bury evidence of her period today.

She couldn't have been more than thirteen, on her knees in the red dirt behind the tool shed, desperately trying to cover a sheet spotted with blood. When she looked up at me, her eyes were pure animal terror. Not the kind of fear that comes from getting caught breaking rules—this was bone-deep fucking terror. The kind of fear prey feels when it knows it's been spotted.

"Please," she whispered. "Please don't tell."

She was one of the Annes—Anne 13, I think they call her. Before I could say anything, Mother Bee materialized behind us like a white-robed mountain. I didn't hear her approach.

"Anne 13," she said, voice thick and sweet like spoiled honey. "It's time."

The girl went limp. Mother Bee's massive hand engulfed Anne's shoulder as she led her away. Just before they rounded the corner, Anne looked back at me. Her face was blank now, resigned. Like she was already dead.

I saw the children today. First time since I've been here. They keep them in this old schoolhouse—all girls, all overweight, all silent. Must have been twenty of them, sat in neat rows, learning to knit. None of them looked up when I entered.

The classroom walls were plastered with typical little-girl stuff. Rainbow drawings, practice cursive, paper doilies. But something was off. In every picture, the sun was black. Every student self-portrait showed them with their mouths open impossibly wide. One had written "I'm so hungry" over and over in cramped handwriting until the paper was practically black.

Found a drawer full of class photos. Years of them. Hundreds of little girls, all with those same dead eyes. But not a single boy.

They put me on laundry duty by the creek today. The water runs red here—iron deposits, they say. We kneel in a line, washing those endless white robes. They don’t stain, somehow. The women around me chat about recipes, about the weather, about what’s for dinner. They call me Katherine—I’m always slow to respond. I came in under the fake moniker Lindsey Adams, but at some point they decided I was one of them and now I’m Katherine 8. But I do a passable imitation of dimwittedness and I just smile and giggle at my forgetfulness and they giggle along with me and we’re just having a great, creepy fucking time.

We were laughing about something I can’t remember when I found the first bone.

Small. Delicate. Definitely human. A child's finger bone, scraped clean.

I looked up. Every woman had stopped washing. Every head had turned to face me. No more giggled, not even a smile. Just dark, beady eyes suddenly boring in me, and I somehow knew then, that this was a test. Nobody moved. Nobody spoke. Just watched.

I pushed the bone downstream. Watched it tumble away in the red water. Went back to washing.

More bones came. Ribs. Vertebrae. All tiny. All clean.

"I wouldn't mourn," Mary 8 whispered beside me, not looking up from her washing. "The boys. Better to return them to Her. Nothing goes to waste here."

I think I know what she meant. I pray to the God that abandoned this place that I'm wrong.

They're still watching me. Always watching.

I have to get out of here at night. Have to see what's underground.

God, Phoebe. What did they do to you?

**27** **July 2004**

Finally figured out how to get out of this fucking dollhouse.

The front door's a bust and they've got cameras on all the obvious exits. But I noticed something while "praying" in my room today. They do this thing, prayer time, just before bed. It’s like they don’t trust you to freestyle a quick prayer to the good lord above, so they blast out a psalm full-volume through wall-mounted speakers for over an hour. I wonder how many heart attacks I could induce by telling my fellow brides that it reminds me of the Adhan—an Islamic call to prayer.

Hilarious. I’m almost tempted.

Anyway, during one of these prayers I noticed something—they didn't bother securing the air conditioning ducts. Most compounds in the Northern Territory use industrial-sized ducts because of the heat. These ones are filthy, like they've never been cleaned, but they're wide enough to crawl through.

Been mapping them out through the ceiling vents. They all seem to connect to a central system behind the church. I can get there through my bathroom vent if I can get the grate off.

Had to get creative with supplies:

* Borrowed (stole) a screwdriver from the maintenance shed during yard work
* Swiped some rope to haul myself up there in the first place
* Got my hands on a proper torch during electrical maintenance duty (third Mary kept talking about how blessed I was to be chosen for it. I had to resist the urge to cave her head in with it.)
* Stole a peek at a maintenance map Mother Bee had hanging in her office, memorised what I could 

The hard part was the grate. Took three days to gradually loosen each screw during my "prayer time," just enough that I can pull it off quickly when needed. Had to keep adjusting it so it looked untouched.

Everything's ready. Tonight's the night.

I can hear chanting of some kind. Sounds hungry.

**31** **July 2004**

Something wicked this way comes. 

If anyone finds this, I need you to understand what happened here. What's still happening. My torch is dying and I can hear it moving out there, so I'll write fast.

Getting out was the easy part. The screws came loose silently, years of rust giving way. The duct was tight—crushed my ribs squeezing through—but I managed. Dropped into red dust behind my house and went in the direction those screams went, all those nights back.

Crept past the perfect houses with their perfect lawns, walked for maybe an hour. Cold desert night, but I was sweating. Then I saw lantern light flickering ahead, bobbing like anchorless corpse-lights in the dark. I stayed low, crawling on my belly through dirt until I found it—a massive stone arch, framing a set of polished stone stairs leading down into darkness. I mentioned it was cold, right? Well going down those stairs, it was like I’d stepped into a sauna. A few degrees hotter, and I swear the very air could boil me.

The stairs went down forever. My torch beam caught crude symbols carved into the walls—circles made of mouths, endless spirals of teeth. Then I heard the chanting. Knew that voice. The closer I came, the louder the chanting got, wet-sounding. Like the singers' throat was full of something thick.

The tunnels below formed a maze. I nearly got lost twice, but the chanting pulled me forward. That's when I found them.

The chanting was Mother Bee. Anne 13 lay spread-eagled on a stone altar, manacled at wrists and ankles. Her stomach—

My hand is shaking.

Jesus Christ, her stomach. No pregnancy should look like that. The skin was stretched grey and it was huge—fucking enormous—bulging with movement like a garbage bag full of rats. Mother Bee stood over her, arms raised, that massive body swaying as she chanted. Her eyes had rolled back, showing only whites. I couldn’t tell you what she was saying. Didn’t sound latin, what little I know of it. There was no tonality to it, nothing I might’ve heard on the radio or on TV. This was new. I felt sick just listening to it. My vision dimmed and the words faded in this strange, formless buzz in my ears. It felt like drowning, but the peaceful kind.

I was frozen to the spot when Anne screamed, and I heard something break inside her.

I didn't think. Just grabbed a loose stone from the ground and swung. The crack of it hitting Mother Bee’s skull echoed through the chamber. She went down hard.

I tried to help Anne up, but then she screamed—this horrible, wet sound. Her stomach split open. Completely open, right in front of me. Not just between her legs, but up, up, all the way to her sternum. She split like a rotting fruit, intestines spilling out in a soup of blood and fluid and—

Oh god.

The thing that *slithered* out.

Fat doesn't begin to describe it. It was obesity made flesh, a blob of rolls and folds with too many mouths. Each one ringed with tiny, black teeth, all of them opening and closing with wet smacks. No eyes. No proper head. Just mouths and mouths and mouths, all of them screaming with that newborn craving for sustenance.

I raised the rock. It wouldn’t have been like killing a baby, because it wasn’t. It was something else. But it was like it sensed what I was about to do, and it screamed. The sound was wrong, like metal being torn. The ceiling started coming down.

I ran, didn’t have time to slam the rock down. Stumbled into this small chamber off the main one, just as the stone above the entryway collapsed. There's another girl in here, long dead on a stone bed like Anne's. Bucket beside her holds what I think is the remains of her baby boy.

The cave-in has blocked the exit. I'm trapped.

My torch beam is weakening, but I can see I'm not alone. There are bones in the walls. Hundreds of them. I wonder which ones belong to Phoebe.

Something's scratching at the rubble outside. I can hear its mouths working.

There's writing carved into the wall beside me. A name: BEELZEBUB. I know that, from somewhere. But I can’t think. I can barely write this. I’m going to die. In truth, I’ve longed for death for so long, but now that it’s here—I’m not ready.

If you find this, burn the Brides of Christendom to the ground. All of them. Every compound. I’m no bible thumper, but this I can tell you with certainty—there’s no God here.

The torch is almost dead. I can hear it getting closer.

I think it’s hungry.
