My parents went missing around 2 months ago, ever since this weird guy has been taking care of me.

He is very skinny, almost like a skeleton. His skin doesn't seem right, almost as If he skinned someone and wore their skin. He has black eyes, but they aren't exactly normal when he's alone his eyes turn completely black, and when make even the smallest noise, his eyes are back to normal. His voice is very soft, deep, and raspy.

For some reason the lock to my room is on the other side of the door, so he always locks me in my room at night when I go to bed. Everyday I eat this wonderful looking breakfast of pancakes and burgers,but it just doesn't taste right, as if it's been cooked with rotten ingredients.

My bus stop is a block away from my "home", most kids don't enjoy school, but it's like a safe place for me, most kids love the weekends, but I dread them.

When I get home the cycle repeats, l've stopped eating his "breakfast", when he's not looking I dump it all in a container and throw it away at my stop, but he's gotten suspicious, so I now throw it away at school, l've heard kids say,
"who would throw this away, this is the best breakfast I've ever seen". If only they knew.

I told my teacher all about this and she believes me, and she supplied me with a lock pick so I could escape my room, did I also mention that my windows have metal bars blocking them, like a prison.

I left my room one night with the lock pick, I was walking down the hall, there's this guy screaming bloody murder, and a terrible smell the gets worse and worse every step I take, I go down the stairs, there was so much blood, the guy screaming saw me and said "HELP ME PLEASE", but the old man wasn't there, I felt something watching me, and it was him, covered in blood with a butchers knife, he had no face anymore. Holy shit, I was eating human!? He told me “Go. Back. To. Sleep.”

I immediately ran into my room, but my lock pick wasn’t there anymore, I didn’t sleep last night. I didn’t get breakfast and I told everything to my teacher. She gave me another lock pick and a call to CPS. They were there the following weekend. I showed them my do- son of a, he changed my door so the lock was on my side

My and my teacher were still determined, she gave my a camera to record everything, she also told me “when you have enough recordings, go to the police station”.

That same night I went out of my room, the man screaming was… decapitated, I recorded everything and ran for the police station, the old man saw me and chased after me… he wasn’t human he was completely skeleton.

While I was getting chased I took a shortcut through the graveyard, boy was that a bad idea I went through the woods, I had about two minutes before I got to the station. I heard him screaming “GET BACK HERE!”, I ran as adrenaline coursed through my body. I finally got there as he said “just wait until you come back”. 

I went into the station out of breath as the officers said “woah slow down there buddy”, I explained everything and I showed them the footage but… GODDAMN IT, the cover was on the camera. They thought I was joking and kicked me out.

Now I’m sitting under a bridge and I’m waiting for the right time to go back.
