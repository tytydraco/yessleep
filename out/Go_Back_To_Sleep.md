My parents went on vacation 2 months ago saying they would return a week later...they never came back, ever since that happened this guy took care of me.

He never bothered to tell me his name, or tell me anything about his life, he lives in the middle of the woods the nearest town being 10 minutes away.
He is very old. He is very skinny, almost like a skeleton. His skin doesn't seem right, almost as If he skinned someone and wore their skin. He has black eyes, but they aren't exactly normal when he's alone his eyes turn completely black, and when I make even the smallest noise, his eyes are back to normal. His voice is very soft, deep, and raspy.

Most of the time I wake up to screaming and the smell of ...something, all I could make out of the screaming was "Help". I confronted the guy, he said that it was a bad dream, but I'm convinced that something is wrong.

For some reason the lock to my room is on the other side of the door, so he always locks me in my room at night when I go to bed. Everyday I eat this wonderful looking breakfast of Pancakes and bacon, but it just doesn't taste right, as if it's been cooked with rotten ingredients.

My bus stop is a block away from my "home". Most kids don't enjoy school, but it's like a safe place for me, most kids love the weekends, but I dread them.
When I get home the cycle repeats, l've stopped eating his "breakfast", when he's not looking I dump it all in a container and throw it away at my stop, but he's gotten suspicious, so I now throw it away at school, l've heard kids say, "who would throw this away, this is the best breakfast I've ever seen". If only they knew.

I told my teacher all about this and she believes me, and she supplied me with a lock pick so I could escape my room, did I also mention that my windows have metal bars blocking them, like a prison. I left my room one night with the lock pick, I was walking down the hall, there's this guy screaming bloody murder, and a terrible smell the gets worse and worse every step I take, I go down the stairs, there was so much blood, the guy screaming saw me and said "HELP ME". The old man said "there's no one here to save you, anyways... good night" he proceeded to bash his head in and decapitate him. The guy who was taking care of me had no head, it was completely blood and skeleton. He was chopping the now dead dude with a butchers knife limb by limb, organ by organ. He told his dead body "don't worry you'll be breakfast" then I realized, HOLY SHIT THIS GUY HAS BEEN FEEDING ME HUMAN.

He gripped his knife harder, as he saw me. After he saw me he said,"Go. Back. To.
Sleep."

immediately ran back to my room after what I just witnessed, I couldn't sleep all night knowing that I was living in a house with a cannibal and a murder. I didn't get breakfast that day, he told me to eat at school. I'm thankful he said that because don't even want to look at that "food".

I went to school, then went immediately to my teacher, I told her everything and she asked me if I had a camera. I said I did, then she told me to go outside my room again and record everything and go to the police station.

Itold her I can't do it tonight because of what I saw. She understood and told me to take as much time as I need, after that the bell rung and class began, the next few hours went by in a blur, but then the teacher told me to stay after class, we discussed on what to do and for the guy who was taking care of me to be on alert.

After that I went "home".
I went to my room and didn't even acknowledge the man, in my room I was reading until sunset then, I fell asleep.

But suddenly... I woke up, I heard my parents downstairs saying "Please ju-" the guy cut them off saying "no I'll cut you up" it was followed by the screaming of my mom and she said "YOU MONSTER YOU KILLED MY HUSBAND" i was going down the stairs and I heard smooshing sounds, presumably him squishing my dads guts, I heard my mom crying. She was covered in... dirt and blood? She was balled up in a corner while the man was chopping my dad up I threw some trash I found on the ground to distract him, then I went to my mom and then when I touched her she... faded away almost like a ghost, and then... my hand was cut off I was bleeding like hell, then he stabbed my heart and then... I woke up.

Thankfully that was a dream, I woke up sweating and panting, I went downstairs and the old guy said "you have a bad dream?" How the hell did he know that?
What if he has a camera in my room? I went searching my room, I couldn't find ab anything for a while I searched under my bed, on the clock, in my closet, and I couldn't find anything. I went to school and I thought "Oh the fire alarm" after I went home and searched in the fire alarm, and sure enough, it was there, I recorded the camera then destroyed it. I heard the old man mumbling, presumably because I destroyed his camera.

Then I went to school the next day, me and my teacher decided today is the I record everything and go to the police, I went home, waited until nighttime, and recorded everything and I made a run for it. Oh crap... he heard me, I was being chased by a skeleton covered in blood and organs, i don't what he was but he was not human, I took a shortcut through the graveyard, boy was that a mistake.


The graveyard is surrounded by deep forest, I know my way around. Suddenly I tripped over a rock and he almost cut my back open, then he threw his knife and almost decapitated me. After that he was, screaming? Then he grew really long needles from his back, he almost stabbed me in the leg. Then he threw his knife and it hit my arm. I was bleeding crazy, but then I felt lightheaded and I fell, I tried to get up and failed multiple times.

But then I got up and realized I was 2 minutes away from the station, I was running as fast I can but then I saw my... mom, slapped myself told myself I was hallucinating, but i don't know if I was. I was outside the station when he gave up and he yelled "Wait till you come back". I went into the station and I reported him for cannibalism, murder, and stalking. I showed them all the evidence and they said they would look for him.

But i still wasnâ€™t done, not until I find my parents
