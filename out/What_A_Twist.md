It was almost Halloween and of all things, we were going to be spending it at my paternal grandparents’ house. They weren’t the kind who’d bake you cookies or sit you on their lap and tell you a story. Instead, they were the hyper-religious type and nothing they perceived as being even remotely Satanic was allowed inside their home. Being in my teens at the time, I didn’t have much to look forward to going over there. I begged my parents to let me stay home alone.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, due to an incident when I was little involving aluminum foil, popcorn kernels, and our microwave, they didn’t trust me to house-sit by myself. It happened one damn time. Now I would have to spend an entire weekend being forced to participate in Bible study. They didn’t even have cable or internet which meant I couldn’t even catch any Halloween specials. If my mood was bad, my mom’s was several times worse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nothing she did was ever good enough for them. I asked why she even bothered with them if that were the case. She told me that it was complicated. As we pulled up to their leaf-covered driveway, I wondered why we couldn’t have gone to my other grandparents’ place. Sure they didn’t have internet either, but at least I could have gotten some brownies and carved a pumpkin. Not to mention, I wouldn’t have gotten a daily lecture about how Jesus died for my sins.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I couldn’t even bring a book to read since I only read horror. That meant the height of excitement for me would be doing my homework and studying.  I couldn’t implement the avoidance strategy either since my grandparents were the workhorse types. If there wasn’t any work to be done, they’d make some. There was a “No Free Handouts” sign on their yard.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This house is getting egged for sure,” I said.

“Quiet,” my dad replied and then knocked on the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My grandma answered.  The house smelled as if Goodwill and Value Village had a baby.  My face instinctively scrunched up and yet that was no match for my grandma’s expression. If my dad had told me she was born biting into a lemon, I would have believed him. She leaned on her cane, giving us all the stink eye.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wipe your damn shoes off. They look filthy!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She called for my grandpa when we came in and he came out of the basement with his face covered in soot. Upon seeing us, he gave a disapproving look

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’ve gotten even pudgier, Hugh. Let me guess, still stuck behind a desk all day?”

“Just trying to make a living, Dad.”

“You should make it getting your hands dirty, like a man.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My grandpa turned to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, Rick, it may not be too late for you. Sure, you’re a bit scrawny, but I can put some hair on your chest.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We hadn’t even been there two minutes and already I was considering trying to hitchhike back home. Dinner was nothing but bland gruel and either prune juice or water.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How’s school?” my grandpa asked.

“Well, I got a lot of tests and projects coming up and studying so it’s been pretty tough.”

“I thought your dad was soft. Let me tell you something, back when I was your age…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He went on a ramble about how he had to be up four hours early to work on the family farm, then he had to walk for two miles to even reach the school. After that, it was off to the coal mines for six hours.  There were several issues with his claims that involved how much time there is in a day. However, I knew if I pointed this out,  he would only start going on about how my generation needed to respect their elders.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, my grandmother commented to my mother that she needed to lose weight and that her clothes looked like they were found in a dumpster. While my grandparents got up to get seconds, my mom stared at the knife block on the counter. My dad put a hand on her shoulder and gave her a pleading look. She blew out a breath and calmed down. With dinner over, it was time to sleep.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The beds we slept on had sheets that made sandpaper feel like cotton.  Between trying to find a comfortable position on the lumpy mattress and constantly itching myself, rest didn’t come easy.  I checked the clock by my bed and saw it was past two in the morning. Knowing sleep ironically may as well have been a dream at that point, I decided to try and kill some time. We were going over Julius Caesar in school so I read about him in my history book for a bit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While doing this,  I got hungry and decided to sneak into the kitchen for a late-night snack. I wasn't expecting much given the dinner we had, but I thought I might find something at least somewhat edible. I settled on some saltine crackers and stood eating them in the fridge light. When I was satiated, I began heading back to my room. However, before I reached it, I noticed a red light fading in and out coming from the basement door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At first, I thought photos were developing down there. However, last I checked, it doesn't require weird chanting. It was coming from beyond the door along with a rhythmic tribal drum beat. Of course, I investigated. This was the closest thing to entertainment I got since we'd been there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Besides, they never explicitly told us to stay out of the basement. The light increased the further I descended. It got so bright I had to shield my eyes. Then almost as if someone had flipped a switch, it was gone. I found myself in some catacombs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where in the world did this come from?” I thought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Granted, the last time I was in the basement was when I was a toddler, but I feel like secret tunnels would be something even a child would recall. There were some torches beside the entrance. I grabbed one and continued. The chanting and drum beats were becoming more amplified the further I went.  Eventually, I came to some kind of alter room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In it, someone was strapped to a table with six hooded figures around them. It was already well lit so nobody noticed the light from my torch. I  crept closer, crouching as I did.  The cloaked people were silent now until one of them spoke.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can we finally kill her?” my back is killing me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That voice. It couldn’t be. Neither of my grandparents was ever the practical joking type and that meant what I was witnessing was real. I wanted to get out of there and call someone. Unfortunately, the lady on the altar noticed me and in her panic screamed for help.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The next thing I knew, I was hit on the back of the head. I woke up next to my parents and we were all tied up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What in Sam Hill is going on here?” my dad asked.

“I can answer that.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From the shadows, came the cloaked figures. Two of them lifted their hoods.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Mom? Dad?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They stood, glaring down at us with disapproval.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s a shame you all had to find out this way,” my grandpa continued.

“What is this?” my dad replied, sounding panicked.

“We wanted to keep it a secret, but Rick here had to go snooping!” my grandma said.

“Yeah, because your house is boring as shit.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I let out a hiss of pain when she whacked me across the side with her cane.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“No cussing! We won’t let you fuck this up for us!”

“Look. I don’t know what’s going on, but if you let us go we swear not to tell anyone,” my dad pleaded.

“It’s too late. Nobody who has witnessed the order can go free,” my grandpa said.”

“The order?” I asked.

“Yes, it goes back thousands of years, especially in our family. In fact, your great great great…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I lost count of the number of greats he said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Grandfather was a founding member. Each sacrifice reduces our age. You’ll all be joining little Missy over there unless…You are willing to join us?”

“I could have sworn the Bible said something about not killing,” I said.

“It’s fine. We always ask God for forgiveness every time we do this,” my grandma replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I rolled my eyes. Then my grandparents had the others pick us up and drag us to the altar. They were mean and miserable sure. However, I never thought they’d do anything like this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s the young ones that are the best for this,” my grandpa said. “We get to reap the benefit of your lazy generation’s work!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These people were insane and they were about to murder us. We were bound next to the girl who begged to be spared.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We could’ve gone to my parents instead, but you insisted on coming here,” my mom told my dad.

“Look, I’m sorry, alright. How was I supposed to know about all this?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Although, deep down I still felt bad for my dad. The one in charge then agreed with my mother, especially given what was about to happen.  My grandparents and the others danced around us. Actually, it would be more accurate to say the others danced while they awkwardly shuffled in a circle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If it weren’t for how scared I was, I might have found this amusing. Their words weren’t merely insane rambling. As they spoke, the air around us started changing.  A wall of fire flared up around us.  From it, would could hear demonic voices speaking in unison. Although, we couldn’t understand them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m pretty sure this is satanic,” I yelled.

“Don’t be ridiculous! They told us they’re angels!” my grandma responded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was no reasoning with them.  It appeared that those who wanted their youth had to perform the kill. This was indicated by my grandparents being the ones to step forward. They took out some machetes. Their eyes were now fully black.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’d be saying all kindness in them was gone if they had any, to begin with. Our fate was sealed. If there was an afterlife, it was going to be awkward as hell,  It was hard to imagine one worse for my dad than having to hear my mom say “I told you so” for eternity.  My grandparents raised their blades with gleeful expressions on their faces.  As they were about to bring them down, a gunshot rang out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ve been waiting years to do that,” my mom said, holding a gun.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My grandma fell dead with a hole in her head. My mom was free of her ropes. The cultists attempted rushing her and were also gunned down.  When the last of them fell, the flames and the voices vanished.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Good thing I always keep silver bullets handy,” my mom said. “It’s the best way to deal with these kinds of things.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My dad and I stared with our mouths agape. She used a hidden knife to free us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ll explain everything later,” she continued. “Right now, we need to leave.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We freed the girl who was in shock. On our way out, she lit one of my grandpa’s cigars and used it to set the curtains on fire. My grandpa kept barrels of stolen gasoline in the backyard. When the fire reached them,  we knew the department coming wouldn’t make a difference. In the next few weeks, my grandparents would be declared missing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I haven’t heard anything about the girl who was with us, but I hope she’s doing okay. As for me, I learned some shocking revelations that night. The main one being was that my mom was a monster hunter. She told us this on the way home.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why didn’t you ever tell me?” my dad asked.

“I was undercover.  I was tasked with dealing with the last members of your parents’ cult.”

“How long have you been at this?”

‘Since we met.”

“We’ve been married over sixteen years. Are you telling me our entire relationship was just so you could murder my parents?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mom, who never smokes, lit up one of my grandpa’s other cigars and took a drag.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was self-defense. Besides, they needed to be stopped.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wasn’t sure how to process all this. I assumed she must’ve been practicing fighting while I was at school and  Dad was at work. Things were different from then on. I learned that my mom’s side of the family has a long history of hunting monsters. From what she told me later, the youngest learn about them when they’re a little older than I was back then.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She has helped me acquire some self-defense skills and took me to the range. She told me I seemed to have a knack for this kind of thing. While I am glad she thinks highly of me, I didn’t know if I wanted her career choice to also be mine. Still, it has been a decent way to deal with emergency bills.

&#x200B;

I’ll finish this post by wishing you all a last-minute happy Halloween. If someone wants you to spend time with people like my paternal grandparents, do yourself a favor and don’t, especially on holidays. Instead, spend time with people you actually like or just get stoned. Whatever works for you.  Now if you’ll all excuse me,  there’s some leftover candy with my name on it and [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) potnet [edible.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
