Hey everyone,

I’m reaching out because something really strange has been happening to me, and I’m starting to get seriously freaked out. Over the past week, I’ve been having these incredibly vivid and unsettling dreams. They’re like nothing I’ve ever experienced before – they feel so real, almost as if I’m actually living them.

In these dreams, I keep seeing strange symbols and hearing whispers in a language I can’t understand. The places I find myself in are terrifying – dark forests, abandoned hospitals, endless hallways that seem to stretch on forever. There are these beings that seem to be watching me, following me. It's hard to describe, but I've never been so afraid.

At first, I thought it was just stress or something (I work in a pretty stressful environment), but they keep happening every night, and they're getting more intense. The symbols seem to be vaguely familiar .

The weirdest part is that sometimes, when I wake up, it feels like I’ve brought a piece of the dream back with me. I’ll find scratches on my arms or dirt on my feet, even though I haven’t left my apartment. It’s starting to mess with my head, and I don’t know what to think anymore. I even tried staying up all night to avoid the dreams, but as soon as I doze off, I’m right back in those terrifying places.

One dream in particular stands out. I was in an old, decrepit hospital. The walls were peeling, and there was this overwhelming smell of decay. As I wandered through the endless, dimly lit hallways, I could hear distant whispers and the occasional echo of footsteps that weren’t mine. At one point, I turned a corner and saw a figure standing at the end of the hallway. It didn’t move, but I could feel its eyes on me. I woke up in a cold sweat, my heart racing.


I’ve tried researching the symbols I see, but I haven’t found anything that makes sense. They’re unlike any language or script I’ve ever seen. I even posted about it in a few dream interpretation forums, but no one seems to know what they mean. 

I’m starting to feel like I’m losing my grip on reality. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Am I going crazy, or is there something more to these dreams? Any insights or similar experiences would be really helpful right now.

I’m really desperate for answers. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. Those dreams are starting to affect my personal life ,its been almost one week i didnt go to work because of the fatigue. Some of my relatives are leaving me thinking im crazy or cursed If anyone has any idea what might be happening, please let me know. I’m open to any suggestions, no matter how out there they might seem.(and the classic pray and god will protect you does not work)

Please let me know if you’ve encountered anything like this or have any idea what it might mean.

Thanks,
Kenny
