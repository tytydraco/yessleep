I used to work at McDonald’s. What I found in the basement made me move to another country. 

This was in the early 90s and back then the internet was not easily accessible. 

I was reminiscing about the past and this came to my mind, so I decided to post it online and see if anyone else has had similar experiences.

So I was 18 at the time and just got my first job as a McDonald’s employee. I was excited because this meant that I could afford something bigger than candy or going to the movies.

My first shift was set to start at 8:00 in the morning. I had to learn all the things there, so my manager was waiting for me when I arrived.

I arrived at 7:45 because I was excited.

“Hey, you’re here early. That’s very great to see that you are serious about this job,” my manager greeted me. 

“Hey, thank you and so excited to get this chance,” I greeted him back.

We shook hands and went inside to check the place out.


“Here is the dining hall and back there is the kitchen. Come I’ll show you around.” He said as we walked in the dining hall.

That McDonald’s was small but better than the restaurants today. It was a vintage 1990s McDonalds and there were 5 other workers.

The kitchen was clean and looked like a nice place to work in. Seeing this place made me so happy that I got this job.

Soon that happiness would disappear and turn into a mix of curiosity and fear.


“Here are the stairs to the basement. You don’t ever have to go in there,” said the manager with a calm but serious look. 
“In fact you are not even allowed in there. There is only one guy that’s allowed in there. His name is Ricky and he works night shifts. 

“You can get night shifts too after you have worked here for a little bit,” he added. 

“Why is the basement only for Ricky?” I asked him

“You don’t need anything from there and you might hurt yourself there. Ricky has experience with these things,” He answered. 

That raised my curiosity about the basement. What was in there and why wasn’t I allowed to go there?

My manager showed me the toilets and ordered another worker to start teaching me. 

My co-workers name was Chrissy. She was a 27 year old woman and had worked there for two years.

She had short, blonde hair and she was pretty short. 

“Okay, I think you two will be fine. Remember don’t go in the basement even if you hear noises coming from there. You understand?” The manager asked before leaving.

Both of us nodded and agreed to not going in there.

“What’s in the basement?” I asked as soon as the manager left.

“I don’t know. I’m not allowed to go in there either,” She answered.

That was weird, an employee who had worked for two years wasn’t even allowed in the basement. 
I finished my shift that day and went home.

I wake up the next morning, brush my teeth and cycle to work again.

“Hello, how are you?” I greeted Chrissy.
 
“Oh hello, I’m fine but it has been pretty busy today. Thank god you arrived” She answered.

I changed my clothes and then went to work. It was really busy that day and before I even knew it my shift was about to end.

That’s when the manager comes into the restaurant and starts rambling to me about the basement.

“I told you that it’s a forbidden place. There is nothing in there for you,” he said with a panicked look on his face.

“I have not been in there,” I told him

That’s when he calmed down. I could see that he instantly relaxed and he looked really relieved. 

“Oh that’s good to hear. Have you seen Ricky by the way?” the manager asked.

“Nope,” I answered.

“Weird, he was supposed to do a night shift yesterday but I didn’t hear anything from him,” He added.
I didn’t know what to say to that so I just told the manager that I need to work again.

I finished my shift and was throwing out the trash when I heard a loud crashing sound, then a loud scream. 

I quickly went inside and looked around. Nothing had happened.

I then walked around the restaurant just to be sure that everything was alright.

I pass by the stairs to the basement and see that the basement door is open. Not a lot but still open.

Curiosity got the best of me and as I’m walking down the stairs, I hear a weird breathing sound coming from the basement.

I got goosebumps but still decided to continue this “adventure”.

I peeped through the basement door and there were lights flickering and some sort of liquid on the ground.

Opening the door made me realize that I might have made a mistake. The liquid was red and thick. I assumed that it was blood but couldn’t know for a fact and I was not going to taste it.

Walking deeper into the basement it got colder, a lot colder. That place felt like a freezer.

That place gave you a really weird feeling. It made my heartbeat fast and I heard my heartbeat echoing. 
 

That’s when I saw the body of a man laying in the corner. That man’s head was turned all the way around. It looked like someone or something had twisted his head a full 180 degrees.

That’s when I started hearing this low humming sound.  

It sounded like it came from all around me. The place was filled with that sound. Then the body of the man rose up and started walking towards me.

He walked towards me backwards and it was just wrong. I almost puked seeing this.

“What are you doing here? Only Ricky is allowed to visit us,” The body spoke.

It sounded rude and its voice echoed in that small space.

“The door opened and I had to check out the noises coming from here,” I answered while backing out of there.


“Were you not warned about this place?” It added.

“Yes but..” 

“Well then you are really foolish!” The voice interrupted me. 

At this point I looked around. There were at least four freezers with see-through doors. All of them were full of frozen meat.


“You have arrived in hell on earth. In this place no human will survive. We produce you meat that keeps people satisfied and craving for more. Meat that tastes like no-other but it takes something from you. It takes a part of your soul for us to feast on,” The creature told me.

“What are you?” I asked shakingly.

“I am a soul taker, a demon and every horrible thing you can imagine! But none of that matters for you anymore,” The creature yelled.

All this time I was backing up. I was not going to stay there for another minute.

“What is your name?” I asked to keep it distracted.

“J….” 

I didn’t listen to it anymore. As soon as that creature started speaking I ran for my life.

I got out the door and that creature slammed into it. It tried escaping and it was strong but I got the door closed. 

Then I locked the door, ran upstairs and changed my clothes. I left that work place right then and there.

The next morning I woke up with tens of missed calls from my boss. I called him back and he was really angry.

He found out that I went into the basement despite his warnings. I told him that I heard noises and had to check it out but realized too late that it was a mistake.
 
He then told me how irresponsible I was and that I don’t listen to managers and bosses. Then he fired me.

I was glad that he did, I would never have to go in there again. In either case I would have quit that job.

I still wonder about the creature in that basement. What was it? Why was it there?

Anyway that is not important to me anymore. I just dodged a bullet and got to live to tell the tale.
