I was 11 or 12 years old, just on the cusp of becoming a stupid teenager. My mother and stepfather had bought their house a year or so ago in anticipation for the birth of my younger brother. It was an old Queenslander, as old as the city I grew up in, its old hard wood frame creaking in the night, scaring me on late nights playing video games. At this age, I started discovering the horror genre, and was terrified of it. I was such a baby, that I would have nightmares from reading just the *back* of Goosebump books in the school library. But despite all this, I know what I saw.

 

I woke up one night, and it was early in the morning. Maybe 1 or 2 am, and I saw a light in the corner of my room. I sat upright to realise it was 9 perfect circles, arranged in a square, and they started to dance. Not in a free flowing way, it was linear, geometric but at the same time their movement was smooth and perfect. The lights crisscrossed over each other diagonally, one corner moving to the other, before crossing again in the other direction. The square of lights then began to spin, clockwise, then counter clockwise, not too fast, but not too slow. I felt they danced for a solid 10 minutes, while I watched, frozen in wonder, before the lights stopped their dance and began to move across the wall, towards me and faded away like the smoke of an smothered match.

 

Thinking back, I don't really remember my reaction exactly. I think I was in some form of shock but I know I was calm. I do know I thought to myself that it must be a car's headlights, and I went back to sleep. When I woke up the next morning I couldn't get it out of my head, how they moved was unlike any headlight I've ever seen, or even a torch, and to deepen the rabbit hole, if it was from a car, it was *impossible* for the lights to reach that spot. My room had 2 windows, both of which were parallel to the road, so no car would be facing either window. One was on the wall the lights were on, and the other was behind my bed head, perpendicular to the aforementioned wall. This window, was concealed from the front path by an overgrown garden bed with a thick, tall hibiscus tree, and a canvas awning that covered the window. I know for a fact, that those lights had no traditional source.

 

And that's it. While it was incredibly weird and unexplainable at the time, I got on with my life, graduated primary school, then high school, then eventually, university after taking way too long to finish. I never saw the lights again while I lived in that room. I moved downstairs anyway when I hit 14 so my brother could have a bigger room, and at 21, I moved out. I've finally graduated, 4 years late and I've just moved south to Brisbane (the state capital of Queensland) for work and finally my life has begun, except,

 

Last night I saw them again.

Dancing on the ceiling

Humming their siren's tune

I forgot how beautiful they were. I can't believe I forgot their beauty.

I think they're calling me.
