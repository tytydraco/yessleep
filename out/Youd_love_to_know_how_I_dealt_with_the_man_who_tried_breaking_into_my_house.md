I’ve been told to give my entire statement in writing, but before you begin you have got to believe me, I am not a lunatic. I am not insane. Everything I did, I had full knowledge of beforehand. Every miniscule detail in this plan I had accounted for. Every possible step, every move, every thought, I had taken into account long before the day I was found. After all, being one of the smartest scientists in the country has to mean something. 



Some time ago, I came home late from the lab and saw Bryan walking across the street. He waved at me, but I was in no mood to exchange pleasantries, and moved towards the door before he came behind me and pulled my hand. Irritated, I pushed him off and went into my house, locking the door behind me. I unpacked, made dinner, and as I sat at the table to eat, I glanced out the window to see his eyes locked on me. His stare pierced through the thin glass, as if he wanted to rip out my heart with his look alone. 



Now bear with me dear reader, I can almost sense your scepticism, but as a single woman I’ve had to take a lot of precautions for my own safety. The news displays scarier and scarier headlines every day, and when I saw him looking through the window, I’d lost my appetite completely. I left the food untouched on my table, and quickly locked all my doors and windows, closing the curtains while trying to get an angle on the man who won’t leave my front lawn. All night I stayed awake, sitting on the couch with a cooking knife in my hand, when suddenly I saw lights in the driveway. I laid down, still, with my knife in hand, and creeped towards the door, when the front door shook violently on its hinges. A man, I could make out it was a man, screamed my name again and again. My heart beat faster, the fact this man knew my name meant he probably knew my workplace as well.



It was then I decided to kill Bryan before he could harm me. Those dark beady eyes of his that dared look through my window would soon have no life left in them. I felt it was my duty, to ensure he causes no harm to me or any other woman for that matter. 

Committing a murder is quite an easy task dear reader, but planning the perfect one, in such a way that you get away with it scot-free is quite an ordeal. You must be fully in control of their mind, and possess a certain conviction and faith in your actions, knowing them to be just. I felt I had no reason to hesitate, after all, I was simply proactively defending myself, some may even call it a “pre-emptive strike”. 



The next day, I checked my phone to see dozens of unread texts from my abusive douche of an “ex-husband”. If only he knew what I was about to do, then he’d know what I’m really capable of. He was just jealous, for the longest time he simply couldn’t stand the idea of his wife being smarter than he was. I decided not to view them until I was done with my plan, just for the satisfaction of having done something right for myself before giving him the privilege of a response. 



Around closing time at the lab, while chatting with my coworker, I snuck a vial of chloroform into my coat pocket. Now chloroform, dear reader, you probably associate with scenes from movies, with criminals stuffing chloroform-soaked rags into the noses of their victims, so they fall asleep almost instantly. In real life however, it takes at least five minutes of continuous chloroform inhalation to result in unconsciousness. Chloroform does have another use though, when exposed to UV light, it converts to phosgene gas, one of the many lethal gases that distinguished themselves in the trenches of Flanders during the first world war.



I bring up these small nuances so you truly can appreciate the effort put into my plan. No ‘insane’ person could ever even attempt such an audacious plan. The preparation of phosgene under non-laboratory conditions is a dangerous task, but I did so without any external help whatsoever. I then stored it in a gas cylinder under high pressure, for transport purposes. Such a small amount of chloroform wouldn’t give nearly enough phosgene gas to cause the mass havoc it once did in past wars, but if used correctly, would still be lethal, or at a minimum, render them unconscious. 



The next night, I crept out of my house and made my way to Bryan’s neighbourhood. His house was around half an hour away from me, and I left around 6pm knowing that most of the people in my area would only come home from work past 8. I parked the car two blocks away from his house, and checked my backpack to ensure everything was packed. Inside my backpack was a 2 litre stainless steel cylindrical container, in which I had stored the phosgene gas, a surgical mask, gloves, and an LPG hose. I then waited, steadily watching as the hour hand of my watch ran its rounds across the quartz surface. I waited patiently, knowing that I was about to do a great service to the world, to rid it of a sinner, and that I’d never have to look behind my back again. 



After several hours, I crept out of my car and used the backstreets to make my way to his house. I jumped the fence to its backyard, and found a ladder which I used to climb into the first floor window. I gently pushed it open, and landed onto the soft carpet floor of an empty bedroom. The house was deathly still but for the ticking of the wall-clock that showed just around 11pm, and for a strange sucking noise that repeated cyclically. I made my way to the bedroom across from the one I landed in, and found my stalker, sleeping peacefully, his face covered by a plastic mask with a tube running out of it, and into a machine that made deep breathing sounds. I disconnected the mask’s tube from the machine and connected it to the steel cylinder, knowing my target would suck up the sweet yellow cloud that smelled of hay. 



And then I waited and watched. I didn’t dare leave his bedside while he ignorantly breathed the nectar I had so diligently prepared. After 10 minutes, he began coughing, slowly at first, then rapidly, so quick it seemed his own lungs were rebelling against him. I locked the door, so if anyone else was in the house they wouldn’t be able to hear, and watched him writhe and struggle. His eyes slowly opened, and those reddened watery orbs stared straight into mine, and I felt a feeling of anger building up within me. His hand moved towards the plastic mask, and I struck him, holding his hands in place so he couldn’t do anything but accept what fate had dealt him. He tried to scream, but I kept my knee firmly on his throat, not too hard as I knew the phosgene was probably burning through his throat already, and he couldn’t scream if he wanted to. 

After thirty minutes, he stopped resisting. The mask had traces of vomit blood, and his watery eyes had rolled back, as if to accept his fate. Around an hour or two after I first connected the cylinder, he began spitting up a pink liquid. This dear reader, is a symptom of having too much fluid build up in your lungs, and meant he was on the verge of death. Usually, phosgene gas can kill within a minute of inhalation, but I had diluted it severely to the extent it would take a long time to kill, solely so I could see this sinner suffer. After his body stopped resisting, I checked his pulse to know he was dead. I had done it. The perfect murder. I turned off the machine, and connected the mask to it so it would seem he died in his sleep. While driving back, I threw the cylinder and hose into the sewer, and I threw the gloves and mask into the fireplace once I got home. A sense of elation crept up my legs as I realised the magnitude of what I’d done. I slept peacefully that night, with no machine necessary to keep me tucked in bed.



The next morning, I woke up to find several missed calls from my ex. I opened his chat to find over 50 texts which I really was in no mood to go through, so I decided to call him directly. 



“H-Hello? Oh Evie thank god you picked up, I’ve been trying to reach you for ages, just- the worst thing has happened, could you come to Charing Cross Hospital as soon as you can?”, he begged through the line, the panic in his wavering voice barely disguised.



“Well well well, I’d known you’d come crawling back eventually. What made you decide to call me after letting me hang for so long?”, I replied, barely hiding my disgust. 



“I- I came over the other day, and you didn't open the door. You can't accuse me of ignoring you, you should consider it a miracle I even decided to visit you after all you did-” 



“Oh wow yes I’m so grateful. Well what’s this ‘urgent emergency’ you called me for?” 



And then dear reader, well, let me tell you, when you commit a murder a secret part of you wants to be appreciated, to hear the admiration or fear in someone’s voice when they describe your grisly deeds, and oh goodness did his next words have that same effect:



“It’s Bryan. He wouldn’t wake up, and his room smelled like musty hay. I know we’ve had our differences in the past, but please, it's our son’s life we’re talking about”
