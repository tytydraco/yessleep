Kyle and I were born and raised in the bustling city of Chicago. We were an ordinary family, as far as anyone could tell. Yet, there was something peculiar about our family history, particularly our father’s. Growing up, I had always been curious about his past, especially about his parents, but he never spoke a word about them. It was as if they didn’t exist. Sometimes, I would catch Dad staring off into the distance, a look of sorrow hidden deep in his eyes, but he would quickly brush it off, returning to his usual cheerful self. I always knew there was something he was keeping from us, but I never had the courage to ask.

One morning, Kyle and I were lounging on the couch, binge-watching our favorite TV show when the doorbell rang. I hopped up and rushed to get the mail. Among the usual stack of bills and ads was a single, ominous envelope addressed to our dad. Without giving it much thought, I handed it over to him.

Dad tore it open, and as he read the letter, his face went pale. His usual calm demeanor vanished, replaced by a torrent of emotions that flickered across his face—confusion, sorrow, and something else I couldn't quite place. He said nothing. My mom, sensing something was wrong, leaned over and glanced at the letter in his hands. Her reaction was immediate. She gasped, covering her mouth with her hand, whispering, “Oh my God, I’m so sorry.”

Kyle and I exchanged worried glances, utterly confused. What could this letter possibly say? Just as I was about to ask, Dad crumpled the paper into a tight ball and tossed it into the trash can. Without a word, he stormed out of the house. Mom followed him out, leaving Kyle and me in a thick cloud of confusion and silence.

We stared at the door for a moment, unsure of what had just happened. My heart raced, and my curiosity burned even brighter. Something in that letter had shaken our parents deeply, and I had to know what it was.

“Kyle, we have to see what that was,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

Kyle raised an eyebrow. “You’re not seriously thinking about going through the trash, are you?”

“Do you have a better idea?” I shot back, already making my way over to the crumpled letter. With trembling hands, I reached into the trash can and pulled it out, carefully smoothing the creases. Kyle joined me, his curiosity piqued.

The letter wasn’t long, but the words hit hard. It was an official document notifying Dad of an inheritance. Our grandfather—someone we hadn’t even known was still alive—had passed away. Dad had inherited his father’s home, a large estate located in some remote area of Ohio. I looked up at Kyle, wide-eyed.

“Our grandfather…?” I said, stunned.

“I didn’t even know he was still alive,” Kyle muttered, shaking his head. “This is huge.”

It felt surreal. We had never known our dad’s parents. He had never spoken about them, and here we were, reading about a house we had no clue existed, left behind by a man we never knew.

“We have to go,” I said suddenly.

“Go? To Ohio?” Kyle replied, eyes wide with disbelief. “Are you serious?”

“Dead serious,” I said. “There’s something about this. We’ve spent our whole lives not knowing anything about Dad’s family. This is our chance to find out.”

After a moment’s hesitation, Kyle nodded. “Alright, let’s do it.”

That evening, after our parents returned home—both looking eerily composed—we made up a story about going on a camping trip. Kyle and I were frequent campers, so they didn’t question it. The next morning, we booked a flight to Ohio and rented a car to find the property. It was a long drive through increasingly desolate roads, but eventually, we found it.

The house was massive, an old two-story building with a large lake glistening behind it. The place looked abandoned, the paint peeling off the walls, the windows caked with dust. There wasn’t another house in sight. It was just us and this eerie, decrepit home.

We stepped inside, and the air was thick with dust and the unmistakable scent of decay. The floorboards creaked beneath our feet as we explored the dimly lit rooms. Furniture lay scattered about, covered in dust and cobwebs. The whole place felt frozen in time, as though it hadn’t been touched in years.

As we walked through the house, something caught my eye. A framed photograph, resting on a dusty shelf. I picked it up, wiping the grime away with my sleeve. It was a picture of a young couple standing with a small child. My breath caught in my throat. The child looked just like Dad when he was younger, and the woman—her face was weary, her eyes distant.

“Kyle, look at this,” I whispered.

Kyle stepped over, peering at the photograph. “That’s Dad, isn’t it?” he asked, his voice quiet.

“Yeah,” I said, nodding slowly. “And those must be his parents.”

The woman in the picture wore a gold ring that caught the light. I stared at her face, trying to piece together the fragments of my dad’s past. Why had he never told us about them?

As the evening wore on, we cleaned up a little and made a small area to sleep. We decided we would explore more in the morning. After a quick snack, we decided to call it a night. I fell asleep quickly, but a few hours later, I was jolted awake by a strange noise coming from upstairs.

At first, I thought it was just the old house settling, but the sound was persistent. A soft creaking, like footsteps. I glanced over at Kyle, still fast asleep. Not wanting to wake him, I grabbed a flashlight and decided to investigate.

The house was deathly silent as I crept up the stairs, the floorboards groaning beneath my feet. My flashlight cast eerie shadows along the walls. The noise seemed to be coming from one of the rooms at the end of the hall.

I reached the door and pushed it open slowly. The room was cold and smelled of something rotten, like it hadn’t been aired out in years. I swept the flashlight around the room. Nothing seemed out of place, just old furniture and dusty curtains swaying slightly in the breeze.

And then, just as I turned to leave, I heard it again. A soft, muffled sound—like someone crying. My heart pounded in my chest as I swung the flashlight around.

That’s when I saw her.

In the far corner of the room, huddled on the floor, was a woman. Her face was hidden behind her knees, and she was wearing a long, tattered gown, yellowed with age. My heart stopped when I saw the gold ring on her finger—the same one from the photograph.

I froze, unable to move or speak. The woman began to weep softly, her thin body trembling. My entire body was paralyzed with fear. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed my shoulder, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.

“Are you okay?” Kyle whispered, standing beside me. He must have followed me upstairs.

I pointed toward the corner where the woman had been, but when we both looked, she was gone. The room was empty. My heart was racing, my palms sweaty.

“I swear she was right there,” I said, my voice shaking.

Kyle raised an eyebrow. “You’re just tired. You probably imagined it. Let’s get out of here.”

I didn’t argue. Maybe he was right. Maybe I had just imagined the whole thing. But deep down, I knew what I had seen.

We went back downstairs, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, my mind racing. And then, just as I was starting to drift off, I heard a soft knock.

At first, I thought I had imagined it, but then it came again. A gentle tapping on the window.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding in my chest. I turned to look at the window, and there she was—the same woman. Her face was pale and gaunt, her eyes wide and hollow, her mouth twisted into a grotesque smile. She raised her hand, the one with the gold ring, and tapped on the glass again.

I screamed, loud enough to wake Kyle. He bolted upright, his eyes wide with fear.

“What’s wrong?” he shouted.

I pointed at the window, but the woman was gone again. Kyle rushed over and pulled back the curtain. There was nothing outside but the dark, still night.

“I swear, Kyle, I saw her,” I said, my voice trembling. “It’s her. The woman from the photo. She’s here.”

Kyle was about to tell me I was imagining things again, but then we both heard it. A low, chilling laugh, echoing through the room.

Without another word, we grabbed our things and bolted out of the house. We didn’t stop until we were in the car, speeding down the empty road, away from that cursed place.

The next morning, we called our parents. Dad was furious when he found out where we had been, but he told us to stay put. They were coming to get us. When they arrived, Dad’s face was pale, his eyes filled with a sorrow I had never seen before.

On the drive back, he finally told us the truth. Our grandfather had murdered our grandmother in a fit of jealous rage. She had been beautiful, attracting the attention of many men, which drove our grandfather insane. He killed her and hid her body in that very house, in the bedroom upstairs. Dad had witnessed the entire thing as a child and called the police. Our grandfather was sent to a mental institution, and Dad had been put into foster care.

The woman Kyle and I had seen—it was her. Our grandmother. Forever trapped in that house, reliving the horror of her death.

As Dad finished the story, I looked out the window, feeling a cold chill run down my spine. We had gone looking for answers, and what we found was far more terrifying than we ever could have imagined.
