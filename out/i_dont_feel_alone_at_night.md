, i always feel as if im being watched, i can hear footsteps in the grass at night and my grass is always wet from the rain so you can distinct it very well. my bedroom window is right next to the outside front yard. i spend all day in my room. so im really used to the smell, noise and how everything looks, i can notice if a pencil is out of place.

i usally hear taps on my mirror but thats a normal thing thats always been happening, probsbly the mirror re-adjusting or something. but nothing else in my rooom moves. for the past couple weeks ive heard on my window knocks but with a finger like little taps seeing if id “notice” or something around 12am, 2am, 1am time that would be “late” for me a 14–15 year old. at first i thought it was my dad because of how he weirdly knows so many things, and i do believe it was him a certain point but i know someones there, anyways eith the finger taps, if i pretend to still be asleep i would hear nothing, but if id get up or turn on my flash id instantly hear quick footsepts like running.

when this first started, it was nothing but a gut feeling, but it wasnt just that, i felt as if every night it just got bigger, and bigger, bigger. until one night i felt the reason of this gut feeling was inside my house, my room, that it fount a way inside. and i never got the feeling that it “came in” again. just that it was inside. i decided to write this post now because i realised ever since i moved my curtain snd made like a peakspot through my window, where u could see anyone who comes, i dont hear the taps any more. but i can hear footsteps on the gravel on the littke corner outside my window and taps on my wall, i can hear this all because my walls are thin.

i dont feel safe sleeping or if my ohone dead or in the dsrk, and the probelm is that i dont even know if this id just my head or real, because now i can feel someome watching me not from outside but inside my room snd sortve “hiding”. apart from this i can feel peoples emotions wether it be my brothers parents or my friends, i can. but depending on the situation in my room, if i put a flash i can feel slight fear and worry and i can literally feel them hiding as if theyre on the corner of my eye, if i call my mum to sleep next to me i can feel anger. i dont know.

about 30 minuetes ago i heard my cat plsying with someone, my cats never sctive at night because no one to play with, but i heard foostoes and her toy being held and my cat chasing it, but toys dont fly? do they. so i called my mym and she was in her room so im terrified shitless.

i dont even know what to say of this, i judt need a answer. im soryy its really bad worded and dosent get to the point but youll know what i mean.

just so you know im muslim so dont give me bible prayers please.

and i believe in jin, spirits ghosts, whatever it is paranormal activity, just not “human souls”.

i dont know if this has to do with 3 of my cats going missing in a fully locked house while alone.

thanks
