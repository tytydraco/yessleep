April 19, 1974 was the day when our family's world shattered into pieces, forever changing our lives. Prior to this day, we were merely an ordinary, happy family. We've never been rich, but we loved each other very much. My parents, my younger sister Valerie and me - we had an inseparable bond. Siblings often don't get along too well, but that wasn't the case with us. I was 4 years older than Valerie, but I loved spending time with her and taking care of her. She was such a happy, bubbly girl. She was very smart, too. She learned how to read when she was just 4 years old, and she loved nature. Quite often, we used to visit our uncle Rainer on his huge, beautiful farm. While we were there, playing and exploring, Valerie used to search for various plants and bugs and then look them up in the thick botany and entomology books that our uncle kept in his impressive home library. We all held the conviction that she would become a biologist once she grew up. In the countryside, both us kids and our parents found joy, not just for its charm but also as a refuge from our less safe neighborhood. Rumors circulated among other kids about shady characters and ex-cons, but our parents' strictness kept Valerie and me out of trouble.

Until that fateful day came and changed everything. In 1974, I was 12 and Valerie was 8. Due to her charming personality, it was unsurprising that she made numerous friends while attending primary school. Each morning, she greeted the new day early with a burst of energy, unlike me, who liked to sleep in. However, on that Friday morning, it wasn't the sound of my alarm that woke me up. It was the sudden, piercing scream of panicâ€”my mother's voice shattering the calm, jolting me awake. That morning, Valerie didn't emerge from her room for longer than usual. Concerned, my mom went to check on her, only to find her room empty, the window open, and her bed vacant. 

I can barely recall any more details from that day and the following weeks. Fear and despair consumed us. The police were involved right away, and we held onto hope, praying for Valerie's safe return. But she never came back. I couldn't wrap my head around how one day my little sister was there with us, everything was normal, and then she simply vanished, leaving no trace, as if she never existed. It felt like we had all been living in a beautiful dream, only to abruptly awaken to a harsh reality. From that moment on, our lives became empty shells, devoid of our previous happiness and carelessness. My parents changed. They appeared tired, pale, and thin, a stark contrast to their former selves. They didn't speak much to me about the ongoing search and investigation. Instead, they just told me to pray for Valerie every night and to be brave. Eventually, after a few months, they began saying that Valerie was now an angel in heaven, watching over our family. Initially, I couldn't bring myself to accept it. I didn't want her to be an angel; I wanted her to be there with us, just like before. It felt incredibly unfair. Why did it have to be her? Why did it happen to our family, out of all families?

But time kept passing by. As the old saying goes, "you can get used to hanging if you hang long enough." And that's exactly what we did. Life went on. My parents continued to do their best to look after me, but it was a struggle for them. A few weeks after Valerie disappeared, they both turned to drinking, and they never really stopped. I don't blame them for it, not anymore. As I grew older and had children of my own, I couldn't even bear to imagine what I would do if anything happened to them. It would destroy me. So I never turned my back on my parents; I cared for them until the very end. As you can imagine, their health suffered after years of drinking and misery. They both passed away a couple of years ago. As for Valerie, when I was around 20, I finally mustered the courage to ask my parents for more details. Unfortunately, they didn't have much to share. There were no foreign fingerprints found in her room, and no blood or bodily fluids that, with today's forensic technology, could aid in DNA identification of a perpetrator. The only evidence the police uncovered were a few muddy footprints, left behind by men's boots, size 12. All men from our neighborhood with a criminal past were examined by the police, and search warrants were issued for a couple of houses. But still, there were no traces of my sister. Despite pursuing several leads, the authorities were unable to make any significant breakthroughs in the case. After that conversation, we never talked about Valerie again. I wasn't a child anymore, and I was aware of the cruel realities of the world. I couldn't bear to dwell on what might have happened to my dear little sister. The possibilities were simply too terrible.

It's been 50 years now, though I couldn't tell you where all that time has gone. I've lived a fulfilling life and am now a grandmother, surrounded by loved ones in a different state. However, recent events called me back to Maine to handle family affairs. My uncle Rainer passed away at the age of 90, leaving me as the sole beneficiary in his will, as he was never married and had no kids. I inherited his farm, which once served as a big playground for my sister and me. Now, it lay abandoned and neglected, in need of attention. I've made plans to visit my late uncle's home, sort through his belongings, and prepare the property for sale, keeping only a few mementos of his. While we weren't particularly close once I became an adult, he was still family. With the house in disarray, I've scheduled a two-week stay to clean up and set things right. 

I decided to begin with his bedroom, which appeared to be the least cluttered of all the rooms. The first thing that caught my eye were two large, red boxes tucked beside his bed. They looked old and were filled with letters. Tons and tons of letters. It got me curious. My uncle was a mysterious man; come to think of it, he must've been quite lonely on his big farm in the middle of nowhere, with no family and not so many friends. Yet, perhaps he had shared a deep connection with someone, who deserved to know of his passing. So I picked up a couple of the letters from the nearest box and was surprised to conclude that all of them were written by him and appeared to never have been sent. They weren't dated, and they all started with "my dearest wife." As I said, my uncle was never married, so I was rather puzzled. I had heard whispers of his extensive travels before settling on the farm, leading me to speculate that he may have married abroad and kept it a secret. With him no longer among us, I reasoned that delving into his private correspondences wouldn't be overly intrusive. What can I say? I'm an older lady and I love me a good, old romantic tale. So I started to read. 

The letters were filled with declarations of my uncle's undying love for his unnamed wife and descriptions of his daily work on the farm. They were all similar. Nothing suggested who the woman was. With a tinge of disappointment, I opened the second box and picked up a letter from the top of the pile. Judging from its appearance, it has been written pretty recently. As I read it, a creeping sense of realization and dread enveloped me, causing the blood to drain from my face. You probably already suspected where this story is headed, right? To you, it was probably obvious from the beginning. But believe me, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to uncover. I desperately wish I had remained in the dark. Without further delay, here is what my uncle penned in what would turn out to be his final letter:

*My dearest wife,*

*My time has finally come. I can feel it deep within my weary bones. I am but a shadow of the young, strong, and handsome man you once knew. My life has stretched long, yet it has been a lonely journey since you left me. But we will meet again soon, and it makes me so incredibly happy. Thoughts of you have filled my every waking moment for decades. From the very first moment we spoke, I was captivated by your beauty, your extraordinary maturity, and intellect. You were the epitome of perfection, as if tailor-made for me. I had to have you.*

*You know, I've never stopped celebrating our wedding anniversary. Every April 19th was a sacred day for me. Do you remember? I do. When I close my eyes, I can relive the day when you finally entered my house as my bride. I've been waiting for it for so long. I remember the beautiful white dress I put on you and the flower crown I placed on your head, as a symbol of your innocence. I remember our first night together. Light of my life, fire of my loins. It's such a shame that our love had to remain hidden. Most people are narrow-minded and judgmental, and they wouldn't accept us. That's why we had to live in the shadows, my love. I know it wasn't perfect. You complained quite a lot, darling, but I didn't mind. That's what women do all the time. You didn't like your room; you said it was too dark and too cold. But all I did was for your own good, so that we could've been happy together.*

*We had only 4 beautiful years. Then it happened. It was so painful to lose our first child right after it was born. And you got so sick; there was so much blood. But I couldn't take you to the hospital; you knew that. Yet, your accusatory stare pierced me like a dagger. I had no choice but to let you go. A part of me died when I saw the light leave your eyes. But fate is relentless, indifferent to our pleas. I had to forge ahead alone, carrying within my heart your cherished memory.*

*There's one thing I deeply regret, and that is that I couldn't give you a proper burial. Our love had to remain concealed, even after you were gone. So believe me when I say that I cried my heart out when I watched the pigs consume the vessel that once held your radiant spirit. For that, I am terribly sorry. I hope that when we finally meet in heaven, you'll be able to forgive me, and we'll spend the rest of eternity together.*

*Until then, my beloved.*

*Your Rainer*
