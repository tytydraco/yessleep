When I graduated college, my friends and I decided to go on a trip to both celebrate our accomplishment and mourn the fact that we were officially leaving adolescence and entering the ”real world”. We decided to go on a backpacking trip to Europe as it seemed to be the only place that we could all agree on and was perfectly cliche for a group of (former) college students. We were all experienced hikers and had traveled virtually everywhere in the U.S., so we thought Europe would be a nice change of scenery. Not a lot of planning went into our trip, we just had a vague idea of what we wanted to do. Fly into Denmark, end up in Switzerland, staying in youth hostels along the way. We had set aside a month for the entire trip so we weren't stressed about having a coordinated agenda or planned stops, we just wanted to get drunk at every bar and do things that caught our interest along the way. 



The beginning of our trip went as expected. We flew into Copenhagen and immediately went out to the nearest bar. For the next month, we made our way south through Hamburg, to Hanover, to Frankfurt, and finally to Zurich. Our trip was filled with hiking, drinking, sightseeing, and a few drug-fueled experiences that now seem hazy in my memory. Everything was what I was expecting from the trip until we got to Zurich. When doing the little planning we did before embarking, the one thing that we did plan was our flights. When we arrived in Zurich, it was a few days before our scheduled return flight home. Being at the end of a month-long bender, none of us really felt like continuing partying and decided to go on a short hike in the Swiss Alps before our return trip. 



Not all of us went on the hike. Out of the 5 in total who went on the trip, only 3 including me decided they wanted to see the alps. The two who went with me were my friends Henry and Kyle. To get to the alps, we had to ride a train for about 2 hours. The image of the mountains towering over me as we stood at their base is imprinted in my mind. The smell of the fir trees, the quiet ambience only interrupted by the chirping of birds and the rustle of the leaves. It was truly serene, and Henry, Kyle, and I silently agreed to not disturb the peace with conversation as we started our way up the trail. Even though we were experienced hikers, we were not planning on climbing to the summit of any mountain, but as we continued down the trail at relatively the same altitude, it got cold. Very cold. 



“Do you guys also feel chilly?” Henry asked us.



I turned around to see him shivering in his t-shirt and shorts.



“Yeah it feels like way colder than when we started.” I replied.



We had set out for our day trip at around 11:00 AM and had only been hiking for about an hour, so it should have been getting warmer if anything. We didn’t really think anything of it as we all had sweaters in our backpacks for when it got chilly at night. In Switzerland the temperature in June, when we were there, is around 55 degrees Fahrenheit at the coldest, but we could tell it was getting much colder than that. Still, we decided to keep going since the route we were taking would take around 8 hours to complete, putting us back at the base of the mountain at around 7:00 PM, just before the sun set. About an hour later, clouds started to move in, blocking out the sun and making it even colder. The wind was picking up too, adding to the already plummeting temperature. I could tell that it was easily close to, if not already, freezing now. When we set out this morning, the forecast said that it would be sunny all day, with no clouds in the sky. 



“Guys, maybe we should just turn back now. It’s getting really cold and it looks like it might rain.” Kyle said. 



“Yeah it's getting mad uncomfortable and I don’t want to be cold and soaked.” Henry added.



“Yeah alright, let’s head back. I'm cold as hell too.” I agreed.

“Let me just take a piss real quick, I’ve been chugging water all morning.”



I was disappointed that our excursion didn’t go as planned, but was looking forward to getting out of the cold. I went off the path to relieve myself behind a tree. After finding a nice pine, I unzipped and did my business. Looking up, I noticed a strange symbol carved into the tree slightly above my head. It looked like an owl head with a cross marked in its forehead. I figured somebody got bored doing what I was doing right now and decided to doodle it into the tree, maybe hoping to scare the next pisser. I zipped back up and headed back to the trail to meet up with my fellow hikers, but when I got back to the trail I didn’t see them. 



“Guys?” I said, slightly above my normal talking volume.

“Alright, very funny guys!” I shouted.

“I guess y’all are gonna jump out and scare me now?”



No response.



“Guys?” I tried again, looking around to see if I just didn’t see them when I was walking back. 



I was only met with the howl of the wind and the swaying of the trees. Without any other explanation, I told myself that Henry and Kyle just ditched me as a prank and already started back to the trail head. It felt wrong to me though, I knew that they wouldn't do that to me, especially since we were hiking in a new place and the weather was so rapidly degrading. They wouldn’t leave me alone, even as a joke. I swallowed this doubt and started back towards the foot of the mountain, determined to save myself from the cold and hoping to find my friends along the way. 



Throughout the afternoon, the clouds above me grew denser, darker, until it felt like dusk. Trudging through the cold, windy afternoon it felt like knives were striking my skin every time the wind picked up, tearing my skin apart. After walking for what seemed like an eternity, I checked my watch to gauge how far I was from the trail head and the sweet warmness of the train ride home. It read “2:53 PM”. We had turned around at about 1:00 PM and had started at 11:00 AM, so I should be reaching the beginning of the trail soon I figured. As I read the numbers on my watch, a white flake landed right on the time display. I picked it up with my finger and it melted almost instantly. I looked up to see hundreds of snowy, white flakes falling from the deep, dark gray sky. A feeling of panic and dread filled my stomach. 



“How could it be snowing in the middle of June?” I thought to myself.

“Thank God I’m almost out of here.”



I was hoping with everything in my being that Henry and Kyle would be waiting for me when I got back, standing next to the warm train, waving me inside. However, as I continued down the path, my hope slowly evaporated. I walked for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 45 minutes, still no trail head in sight.



“I should be right by the train by now.” I told myself.

“Did I walk the wrong way when I finished pissing earlier? Did I somehow go back to the wrong trail? Where am I?”



I was starting to panic. Snow was still falling and each crunch under my boot slowly weathering my assurance that I would see my friends or the train again. My feet and my legs were growing numb. I had nothing but my shorts and a sweater to protect me from the unforgiving cold. Still, I kept walking. Eventually, the clouds grew so dark I had to take out my flashlight so I could see the path better. I looked down at my watch, expecting it to be close to sunset. “4:12 PM” it read. I figured even if I did walk the wrong way, I would still end up at the trailhead by 7:00 PM since that’s how long the entire hike would have taken. I continued, each minute growing more and more scared of the reality I was in. Snow was building on the ground, the wind and the cold had still not given up. Each minute had the weight of a freight train, pounding into my body. Luckily, I wasn’t entirely stupid and had packed food and water for the journey, so I would still have my strength to continue. As the afternoon turned into the evening, 7:00 PM came and went and the trailhead was still nowhere in sight. My panic grew with each step I took. It was pitch black now, almost a complete absence of light. We weren’t expecting to stay the night up here, so I hadn’t packed a tent or many camping supplies, just a sleeping bag. 



I started coming to terms with the fact that I would probably have to spend the night out here in nothing but a thin sleeping bag when I saw a light up ahead of me. I felt my heart skip a beat, thinking it was another hiker. At least I won’t be out here alone. Maybe they had some camping gear or at least extra clothes so I wouldn’t freeze to death. However, as I made my way towards the beckoning light, it turned into multiple lights, yellow and warm. I finally got in range to tell what it was, not another hiker, but a cabin. I didn’t have time or the luxury to think about all the warnings I was given by Grimm’s fairy tales in my youth to think twice about approaching this lone cabin in the middle of the Swiss Alps. As I quickly walked towards the cabin, I thanked God with every step and thought about the warmth that would bathe me as I entered the cabin. The cabin appeared rustic, like Paul Bunyan built it himself. There was a big, cast iron knocker on the door. I reached to pick it up to knock, but the door flew open before I even touched it. Greeting me was a tiny, old woman. 



“What are you doing out there in the cold?” She asked in a sweet, comforting voice.

“Come in sweetie, you’re gonna freeze to death!”



“Thank you so much.” I blurted out as I quickly entered the safe haven of the cabin. 



The crackling of a fire met my ears at the same time its warmth covered me. A flood of relief entered my body and mind with the assurance that I would not freeze to death tonight. This only lasted for a minute as I was reminded of Henry and Kyle.



“Are my friends here? Have you seen them?” I automatically asked.



“No, sweetheart, you’re the only soul we’ve seen.” The old woman said with concern in her voice.

“Come in dear, sit down, do you want some coffee? Tea?” 



“Sure, uh coffee please. You’re sure you haven’t seen anyone else tonight?”



I wandered over to the fireplace and sat down on the old sofa, next to the rocking chair. As I glanced over to the chair, I was shocked to see an old man occupying it. I hadn’t seen him when I entered.



“Positive, dear. Your friends probably had enough sense to get off the mountain when it started snowing.” She chuckled.

“What are you doing on the mountain in this weather anyway?”



“I got turned around and couldn’t find my way back to the trailhead.” I said as she handed me my coffee.

“I’m glad I found this place, I thought I was gonna freeze to death for a minute out there.” I took a sip of the coffee. It felt like ecstasy as it dripped down my throat, warming my insides.

“Is it normal for it to snow like this in the middle of June?”



“I remember only one time since I’ve lived here that it’s snowed in Summer. It was many many years ago, when I was about your age. As you can tell I’m not from here,” She smiled.



It hadn’t occurred to me when I was being rescued from the icy cold, but she spoke with an American accent. 



“Oh yes, now that you mention it.” I said between sips of coffee.

“Where are you from?”



“I’m from a little town in Kansas called Columbus. I moved here right after I finished college. I met my dear husband over there on a trip me and my friends took and I’ve been in love with him ever since.” She smiled at her husband who in return continued to rock in his chair as if he hadn’t heard a word that was said.



“That’s sweet” I said to break the silence. 



“Even after all these years he refuses to learn English.”



The old man continued to stare blankly at the fire and rock back and forth in his chair.



“Could I use your phone? To call the park rangers about my friends. I haven’t been able to get cell service since I got to the mountains.” 



“Oh we don’t have a phone dear, we don’t use any electricity here. I’m really sorry about your friends, but you’re welcome to stay here tonight and I’m sure Wilhelm here will go with you in the morning to look for them.” She gestured to her blank husband.



“Oh uhh ok. Thank you. I really appreciate it.” I said with a concerned tone to my voice.



I finished my coffee and after a hot shower, the old lady led me to their guest room where I’d be staying the night. As I crossed the hall from the bathroom to the bedroom, I could see into the living room, Wilhelm was still rocking in his chair, staring at the fire. As I laid down in the bed, I could feel an itch in my throat, you know the kind you get before you get sick. I figured being out in the freezing cold for so long would probably give me something so I just took a preemptive ibuprofen from my backpack and laid down to sleep. 



That night, I awoke with terrible chills and my head pounding. The blanket that was draped over me was drenched with sweat. The ibuprofen I took before sleeping was the last one in my pack, so I wandered out of the bedroom, across the hall to the bathroom in search of more painkillers. I turned on the water and splashed some on my face. Opening the medicine cabinet, I was greeted with a very odd assortment of jars. They were filled with what looked like herbs and fungi. I figured since these people didn’t have electricity, they were probably the kind who grew their own natural remedies as well. The jars had labels on them that specified what they were and what they did. I searched for one marked painkiller or anti-inflammatory. Sure enough, there was one with just that inscribed with sharpie and masking tape. It had the appearance of some sort of mushroom. Cracking it open, a sharp and vulgar odor hit my nostrils. It smelled like burnt rubber. The scent immediately caused me to think twice about taking whatever this was. However, being in immense pain guided my decision more than the hideous smell of the mushroom. I made sure to write down the name of it before taking it though, so I could research it after rejoining civilization. When the fungi hit my tongue, the taste hit me like a truck, it was much worse than the smell and caused me to gag before choking it down. 



I drank an ample amount of water to try and wipe the memory of the taste from my mouth, but it persisted. The effects of the strange medicine were immediately noticeable. My body began to tingle and I became dizzy. Walking out of the bathroom to the bedroom, I took another look down the hallway to the living room and stopped dead in my tracks. The old man was no longer sitting in his chair. I could see only half of his body as the doorframe cut off my view from the rest of him, but I could tell that he was naked. I slowly made my way down the hallway towards the living room. The rest of the man’s body was revealed as I got closer and my viewpoint was no longer obstructed by the door frame. The old man was right in front of the fire, facing towards it. I continued into the living room.



“Hey dude, are you alright?” I said with a nervous quiver in my voice.



He muttered something quietly in German I assume, but I couldn’t hear what it was. Something about him caught my attention though and when I saw it, my stomach dropped. On the man’s left shoulder was the symbol of an owl with a cross on its forehead, the same one I had seen on the tree. The room started to spin, I got lightheaded and fell to the ground. When I regained consciousness, I was back in the bedroom, lying down on the bed. The only light provided in the room was coming from the hallway. I tried to sit up, but I couldn’t. It felt like in those dreams where you try to run, but you can’t, your body is too heavy. As much as I tried, I couldn’t move. My struggle was interrupted by several people entering my room. I could only see their silhouettes created by the warm, yellow light peering in through the doorway. Counting them, there were upwards of 15 people, all of them nude. Among them, I could make out the elderly couple. I tried to speak and ask them what was going on, but I couldn’t. They slowly gathered on either side of the bed and began to raise their arms above me. Once their arms were perpendicular to their bodies, they slowly got down on their knees. I could feel their cold touch all over me. Their hands were wet with some liquid that I can only assume was vinegar, as the smell was overpowering. All of a sudden, it felt as though the bed underneath me had dropped and I had the sensation of falling, like my chest was tied to an anvil and there was nothing below to stop it. My eyes rolled back into my head and my nervous system became overwhelmed.



I awoke what I presume to be the next morning to the pleasant touch of the sun warming my face. Immediately shooting up, I expected to see the mysterious figures from the night before, but I was shocked to find that I was laying in a patch of grass, my backpack to my right. It was a typical June day, the sun beaming down beating on my face. Warm, warmer than usual. No snow or any sign of snow around. My illness was seemingly gone, but I still felt drained from whatever happened. Shakily making my way to my feet, I scanned my surroundings, seeing that I was near a trail, but no cabin in sight. I put on my pack and walked towards the trail. The surroundings felt familiar, the rocks, the trees. As I approached the trail, the owl symbol I had seen earlier beamed from the tree, capturing all of my attention. I stopped mid-step and stared at the symbol, processing exactly what this meant. Questions raced through my mind. Had the occupants of the cabin carried me all the way back here? Had I gone in a big circle? Had I gone anywhere at all in the first place? I put my concerns to the side and turned my attention to what I wanted most at this point, to go home. I started down the path in the direction of where I initially thought the trailhead to be, determined to find it this time. After about 20 minutes of walking, I heard something out in the distance. 



“Trent! Treeent!”

I recognized the voice immediately. I quickened my pace toward the source of the shouting. 



“Henry!” I shouted in return.



Rounding the corner of the trail, I almost wept when I saw Henry and Kyle walking towards me. When they saw me, they began to run towards me while I stood frozen, awash with relief. 



“Where the fuck have you been dude?” Kyle said when they finally got close. 



“You wouldn’t believe it man, there was this cabin and these old naked people and I woke up in the grass and– wait what about you guys, where the fuck have *you* been.” 



“We’ve been looking for you dude, you disappeared yesterday after you went to go take a piss.” Henry said with frustration in his voice.



“No, you guys disappeared.” I retaliated.



“We’ve been shouting your name for the past 24 hours, walking up and down the trail. Where did you go?” Kyle asked.



“I tried walking back to the trailhead, I figured you guys ditched me as a joke or something and went on without me. How did y’all survive the snow, you guys didn’t pack tents or anything right?”



“What snow?” Henry asked, with a confused look on his face.



I returned his look with one of equal confusion.



“The snow. It started snowing yesterday after we split up.”



“What do you mean man?” Kyle chuckled.

“After we split up it got hotter, dude. It’s June, there’s not gonna be any snow up here.”



I explained the rest of my night to my friends, the cabin, the old couple, the ritual that was performed on me, but they didn’t believe me. They figured I was either lying or took too many mushrooms and had a bad trip or something. In reality, I wasn’t entirely sure what happened to me was real either, God knows I didn’t want it to be. 



We made our way back to the trailhead and after about an hour and a half were sitting on a train on our way back to Zurich. The suite was quiet the whole way back. We were all fatigued from this trip and were looking forward to being home. I was resting my head on the window sill, trying to somehow find sleep after the horrific experience I had just endured. I was recounting the events that happened in the cabin when I suddenly remembered writing down the name of the fungus that I took before everything happened. I pulled out the slip of paper it was scribbled on as well as my phone and quickly googled “Mycoterra Maleficium”. I tapped on the wikipedia article for it and scrolled through. “Should not be ingested, could cause hallucinations, vomiting, seizures, and diarrhea. Known for being the substance ingested during the 1974 mass suicide of the Black Dawn cult.” This was deeply concerning to say the least, I could feel myself start to sweat and my heart beat increase. How could I be that stupid to take a mushroom that I found in a stranger's house? I was livid with myself, but that was quickly replaced with fear. I clicked on the link for the Black Dawn on wikipedia and nearly dropped my phone when the page loaded. What else was going to greet me but the same owl symbol from the tree and the man’s back.
