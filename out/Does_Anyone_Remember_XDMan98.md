If you grew up in the early 2010s, you can probably remember the rise of Minecraft YouTubers. The story is usually the same: You learn about this game that looks like legos and you, having unlimited internet access, decide to search it. Soon, you become engrossed in a world of cubes and personality. Even if the jokes fly over your head, you laugh along with the banter. Soon, you begin to actively follow them. Even when the game starts loosing steam, you may see them keep playing.

This is where the stories start to divide.
 Those personalities will eventually hop onto the next big game. Friends you watched build houses begin arguments and then eventual full on attacks.

Next thing you know, the guy you grew up watching is being called things I don't I can say here.

Normally, most people don't live to see an empire rise then collapse or even if they did, it was never this close. Yet, you can see the world you once saw yourself dreaming of joining crumble away like the buildings of Pompeii.

That was me for almost all of my favorite childhood YouTubers. Skydoesminecraft, Sjin, Tobuscus. While some did escape scrutiny like DanTDM, most ended the same way.

Disgraced.

Well, almost everyone.

You see, there was a channel I watched when I was in 5th Grade. Around this time, I stumbled upon a Minecraft Mod reviewer who went under the name XDMan98.
 Their profile pic was the Epic Face and their skin would be, what the younger generation would call, an E-Boy Skin. 

He had kind of a dry humor to him. His jokes were less bombastic and more observational. One time, while reviewing the John Mod, he spawned in a small john that immediately ran into a ravine and he chuckled, saying "Well he didn't like existing".

Maybe if you saw what I saw, you'd laugh too.

Sometime in 2017, i stopped watching Minecraft content. Not that I didn't hate the game, it's just I felt like I didn't need to watch these people anymore. Soon, the people I watched began to fade from memory.

Cut to now. I am in college and I was hit with a quarter life crisis. I began to do some research on several of the YouTubers I grew up with. I was disgusted that two thirds of my childhood heroes were monsters but soon began to realize something. Despite my searching, I could not find any mention of XDMan98. Even if he deleted his channel, there should be at least mentions of him.

I saw saw his comments back in the day, he had collabed with several big names at the time. Even if he vanished, there should have been something about him. Fanart, fanfiction, a mention in an old video or even from people in my position, trying to remember the past.

Nothing.

It got to the point I went onto Reddit and asked about them. I was called a troll among other words in the subreddits I asked.

I genuinely feel like I am losing my mind. I remember, so vividly, his videos.

I have checked everything. I dug deep into The Internet Archive and came out with nothing but frustration.

A Man who's channel was large enough to be in Youtube Rewind, which he was, shouldn't have just vanished. Not only vanish, but also have everything about them is scrubbed and everyone forget they exist.

Everyone but me.

I come as a pleading man, begging.

Does Anyone Remember XDMan98?
