[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h7kyt7/i_created_an_astrology_chatbot_for_a_girl_i_like/)

It’s not perfect yet, but it’s definitely *doing something*. Let me explain.

After I posted last week, someone dmed me and said I should tell Jasmine about AstroBot. But before I did, I wanted to make sure it was impressive enough to blow her away. I mean, she already knows a ton about astrology, so if I showed her some half-baked chatbot, she’d probably roll her eyes and tell me Mercury was in retrograde or something.

So, I doubled down. I spent the entire weekend refining AstroBot. It started as just a chatbot trained on astrology data, but I wanted it to feel more… real. Like a modern fortune-teller. So, I added two things: tarot card readings and palmistry.

First, I uploaded an open-source dataset on tarot interpretations. You know, stuff like *The Tower* means chaos, *The Lovers* means harmony, and so on. AstroBot could randomly pull three cards for a reading and explain how they worked together. It wasn’t perfect—it sometimes gave super vague answers—but Jasmine always said tarot is more about intuition anyway. I figured vague answers wouldn’t be a dealbreaker.

Then I decided to tackle something more ambitious: palmistry. Jasmine mentioned it once when we were talking about astrology, saying your palm lines can reveal your personality and future. That sounded way cooler (and harder), so I used an image recognition model to train AstroBot to read palm lines from photos. The idea was simple: someone uploads a picture of their hand, and the AI cross-references their palm lines with their star chart to give a custom fortune.

I had no idea if it would actually work, but when I tested it on myself, AstroBot analyzed my palm and told me this:

*“Your lifeline suggests resilience, but your fate line is broken—meaning you often feel like your future is out of your control.”*

Uh… yeah, okay, that one hit harder than I expected. But I brushed it off as coincidence. After all, I trained it—I knew it was just spitting back data in a convincing way. Right?

By Monday, I couldn’t keep it to myself anymore. I had to show Jasmine. I told her I’d been working on something “cool” and brought my laptop over to her apartment. She was already burning incense and reading a book about moon phases when I walked in (of course). 

“Okay, what’s this big secret?” she asked, her eyes lighting up.

I pulled out my laptop and showed her AstroBot. “It’s kind of like a digital fortune-teller,” I said. “You can ask it questions, upload your palm, whatever. It reads your chart and predicts stuff.”

Jasmine’s jaw dropped. “You made this?”



“Yeah. I thought you’d like it.” 

“Like it? This is amazing!” She grabbed my laptop before I could say anything else and started asking AstroBot questions.

Her first question was harmless: *“Where are my keys?”* AstroBot responded with a generic answer: *“Look near the windowsill.”* Jasmine laughed, saying she hadn’t seen them there, but then… she actually found her keys on the windowsill.

“Okay, that’s spooky,” she said. 

“It’s just a lucky guess,” I said, even though my hands were sweating.

Then she asked it something bigger: *“What does my future hold?”*

AstroBot analyzed her birth chart and palm photo, and after a few seconds, it replied:

*“A dramatic change in your personal life is imminent.”*

Jasmine tilted her head. “What kind of change?”

AstroBot responded: *“Opportunities will arrive from unexpected places.”*

She laughed and said, “Guess I’ll keep my eyes open, then.”

At that point, I was starting to feel like the cool boyfriend who’d nailed it. Jasmine was obsessed. She spent hours asking AstroBot random questions, and it kept giving her answers that seemed just plausible enough to be true. But the weirdest part came later that night.

Jasmine texted me at midnight, freaking out.

“YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS,” she wrote, followed by about ten exclamation points.

She sent me a picture of a letter she’d just opened. It was an acceptance letter to her dream college—a school she’d applied to on a whim and hadn’t expected to hear from for months.

“The bot was right,” she said. “It said there’d be a dramatic change! This is it!”

I stared at the text for way too long. On the one hand, I wanted to be happy for her—this was huge. On the other hand, I couldn’t shake the feeling that AstroBot’s prediction wasn’t just a lucky guess.

Was it possible the AI had influenced this somehow? Or worse… did it *know* this would happen before anyone else?

I told myself it was just a coincidence. I mean, it had to be, right? It’s just a program.

But still, I logged the prediction.

Just in case.



So yeah, that’s where I’m at right now. Jasmine thinks I’m a genius, which is great, but this whole thing is starting to feel… weird. AstroBot is way better at this than I thought it’d be. Too good, maybe. 

Let me know if you guys think I’m overthinking it. I mean, there’s no way an AI can actually *know* the future.
