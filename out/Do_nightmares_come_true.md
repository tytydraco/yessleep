Alright, so... A quick introduction about me. I've always been fascinated with horror stories and started listening to podcasts about paranormal experiences from the age of 10. I myself however, haven't encountered anything paranormal in my life, except for the few instances of mistaking a pile of clothes for a monster or the howling of dogs at night to be the call of ghosts. Things that happen to pretty much all of us once in a while. I haven't seen or experienced any "ghostly" entities. At least that is what I'd like to believe. You see... lately, I've been having these nightmares which are starting to come to life. And if I start believing them to be real, very soon, they WILL be real.

It all started with the horror stories. Stories that  would keep me up all night and yet I always wanted to hear. And growing up, I know why. Kids always have a weird fascination towards things that are not meant for them or could possibly be harmful for them even. And I wasn't any different. As a kid, I'd find ways to gather stories from the web or listen to radio channels that had people talk about their paranormal experiences. Although these were thrilling in their own ways, in my country, the best way to enjoy a spooky night is to gather around with your cousins and take turns in telling horror stories. All of which were made up of course. Just for the scares. But it was worth the while to say the least. You might be wondering why drag the story with such irrelevant information but please bear with me. Because it was these "horror story sessions" that shaped itself into my first living nightmare.

I remember it being November, 2015. I finished dinner, brushed my teeth and went to bed like any other day. Being a 16y/o teenager who had to attend classes everyday for 7 hours straight, it didn't take long for me to doze off and fall asleep. And I did. I was asleep and soon fell into the dream-like state, like most other days. Now, having nightmares weren't anything new to me. I've had plenty of nightmares before and none of them were any less scary than this one. Dreams or nightmares, whatever you call it, are all very much realistic. That is, until you wake up from it. And that's what made this particular nightmare different from the others. I don't exactly remember how the dream (yes, I'm calling it a dream because it wasn't remotely scary at first) started but I found myself joining a cousin of mine in one of those story telling sessions. Except, it was only me and him. I didn't have any new stories to share and so he went on to tell a story of his own. It was about a bride in white sareeâ€Œ, a traditional clothing in Bangladesh and the neighboring countries like India and Nepal. The story itself wasn't that long and only had details of how she was murdered by her husband and how she came back to life to haunt other men who fall prey to her traps. Typical Bengali horror story I'd say.

Everything was okay until this point, but if you've had vivid nightmares, you know that's not how a dream or nightmare works. Very soon I found that things around me were starting to disappear. Not vanish in a single instant but fade away into nothingness. Even my cousin was not around me anymore. And a few moments later, I was back on my bed. The very bed I remember falling asleep in. Even at that moment, I wasn't sure if I was asleep or not. It was my bed after all.
