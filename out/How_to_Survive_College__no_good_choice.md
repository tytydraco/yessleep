A lot has happened since I last posted.  I’ve been reeling from it all and have been putting this update off.  The situation with Maria and James wasn’t something I could wait on, because Maria was somewhere, perhaps trapped as James had been trapped, and the thought of that was intolerable.  I wanted to throw up just thinking of it, my stomach twisting into a painful knot that sent pain stabbing up into my chest.  I couldn’t live with this outcome.  I *couldn’t*.  So wrote the last post, just so I didn’t forget anything, and then immediately went to find Grayson.

He didn’t answer my text message *or* my phone call, so I went to his house.  Perhaps he was in class (if he was still bothering to go, I don’t know, I haven’t been keeping track of him because I’ve had my own problems) but, if he wasn’t answering his phone then I was going to either find him or be there for when he got back.

I pounded on the front door for a good minute before Grayson answered it.  The sight of him made me pause, like a bucket of ice thrown upon my anger and fear.  He looked *bad*.  His skin had a gray cast and the veins in his eyes were darkened, like the blood was slowing down and drying out. This was why he had been so exhausted all year, I realized.  Not because he was graduating, but because this wasn’t his body and it was dying all around him just like the president’s body had.

“Maria is gone,” I said.  “She fell into the water in the power plant basement and something else came out.”

His eyes widened and he sucked in a sharp breath.  

“You know something, don’t you?” I demanded.  “You have to.  That’s where you *came* from, isn’t it?  If it can - can put souls in other bodies, then it put *you* here in James’s body.”

It was like now that I was going, I couldn’t stop myself.

“Did you know that I’ve been drinking from it?  And that I can’t remember doing it?  What is this place doing to me!?  What did it do to Maria!?”

I was shouting at the last bit.  Grayson raised his hands and he was saying something, I don’t know what, trying to calm me down before the neighbors noticed.  I wasn’t hearing his words anymore.

“Yes, you’re right!” he finally snapped, shocking me into silence at last.  “That *is* how I got here!  I wanted a way out and so when it was offered to me, I took it.”

“*Who* offered you a way out?”

He laughed softly and stepped back, leaving the door wide open.  An invitation to come inside.  I hesitated.  Would I even remember this conversation later?  Knowing what Grayson was, could I trust him?

“The first president,” he said wryly.  “He wanted to harness the inhuman.  You’ve seen how that turned out for him.”

He was gone.  Long dead, a walking corpse, propped up by human souls being shoved inside that rotting bag of meat.

“Did you - were you the reason the president was that way?” I asked, horrified.

“I’m… trapped by the status quo,” he murmured, his gaze growing distant.  “I knew it was a cage and I stepped into it anyway.  And once I had a role, I had to keep it going.”

It was humanity that changed things.  The inhuman preyed on us, but when we told stories, they had no choice but to play along.

“There were others, of course,” Grayson murmured.  “He had a bunch of them under his sway.  They knew of my existence and he promised them power and immortality if they helped him.  That was very popular back them.  Using the occult for those things.  Using *us*.  Some of those families are still around, though I think the descendents weren’t informed of what was done.  Here.  Come inside.  I’ve got some photos.”

Reluctantly, I stepped inside the doorway.  He closed it gently behind me and led me through the house to the president’s office.  The house felt desolately empty.  Like it hadn’t been lived in for a very long time.  There were no lights on and the office was lit only by the gray sunlight trickling in through the windows.  Grayson rummaged through the file cabinets.  He was breathing hard.  Like that short walk from the front door was enough to exhaust him.

“Here,” he said, handing me a photograph.

I took it.  And perhaps because I was getting the hang of how things worked around here, I wasn’t surprised by what I saw.  The president stood there, staring solemnly at the camera, flanked on either side by men of similar appearances and ages.  And towards the right was one, his hair long gone, that looked vaguely like a certain professor who could bore the devil himself to tears in a lecture.

I sighed and handed it back.

“Let me guess,” I said.  “They’re still in positions of power around the university?”

“Some are.  I don’t keep close track of them.  They’re not necessary anymore.  The rumors of an immortal president among the staff has been enough to keep the cycle they started going.”

“This isn’t helping me save Maria,” I said, sighing and handing it back.

“It’s all I can give you,” he replied quietly, putting the photo away again.  “I’m not in a state to help.  I can’t do *anything* right now.”

I couldn’t do everything.  I couldn’t save everything.  Yet I still had to ask - this was *Grayson* and yes he wasn’t human and yes he had kept so many secrets from me but at one point I cared for him - no - I still did I think - and I felt like I had to try.  So I asked him what I could do to help, perhaps after we saved Maria, and he said there was nothing.  He just had to make it until the end of the year, he said.

“Is that when you steal another body?” I blurted out.

He didn’t seem upset by what I said.  He stared at me for a long moment before quietly saying that no, if everything worked out like he hoped, he wouldn’t need to.  He’d finally graduate.  He wouldn’t be playing the role of the university president’s son any longer.  He’d leave.  He wouldn’t be stuck in this cycle.

“If you’re following the rules setup by the university,” he said, “you can use the pool of water to possibly bring her back.  A lot of it hinges upon the strength of her will though… and the will of whatever came back.  I’m sorry Ashley, but this one is on you.  I wish I could help, but I’m at my limits.”

“Is it… the tree?”

He’d once said that it was trying to consume him.  I thought it was a metaphor.  But I thought of the swimmers, crushed by its roots, of my manager entombed in the cemetery.  Grayson meant it literally.

“The tree and time.  I’m sorry I can’t tell you more.  I know how it works, it made me into this, but I cannot change things on my own.”

He shuffled to the front door.  I followed, distracted as my mind raced.  I wasn’t considering Professor Monotone at this time.  Obviously I want to find out what he knows as a descendent of the people who put Grayson into his incarnation as the president’s son.  But I doubt he actually knows anything, if his parents or their parents didn’t talk about what they did.  He might be able to find something out by rummaging in the attic, but that would take time.  I needed immediate results.

He opened the door.  And someone was on the other side and they came lunging through it, slamming into Grayson and throwing him bodily to the ground.  He hit with a huff, like a balloon deflating, and he did not try to get up.  He didn’t even try to fight back.  He just lay there, gasping, as Maria - no - *James* - wrapped his hands around Grayson’s neck.

Grayson cried out, a strangled, agonized cry.  His eyes rolled back in his head and his back arched.  He whimpered back in the throat and I felt - I saw - a crushing darkness, pressing in all around me, like the entirety of the world was wrapping me in its hands and squeezing tight.  And when it spread them again, I would be scattered as atoms into that ocean and I would lose everything I once was.

The fear was overwhelming.  I couldn’t go back to that.  I couldn’t.

I gasped, surfacing from that darkness like I’d been drowning, sucking air into my lungs as if I hadn’t been able to breath for a long, long time.  On the ground, Grayson stared up at me with his dying, blackened eyes.  I saw the fear I felt echoing in them.  His fear.  It was *his* fear.

I don’t know if I should have done what I did next.  If it was the right thing to do.  I think… I think maybe it wasn’t.  But that terror was squeezing at my chest and I heard the distant roaring of water in my ears and I had to do whatever I could to make it stop.

I tackled James off of Grayson.  We went over in a tumble of limbs and bruised elbows, slamming against the wall of the hallway.

“Get out!” I shrieked, stumbling to my feet.  “GET!  OUT!”

James was picking himself up too, disoriented by being attacked.  He clearly did not expect to be interrupted.  His gaze cast over to where Grayson lay, curled on his side with his head in his arms, and James stretched out a hand towards him.

I put myself between the two.

“OUT!” I screamed again.

There was no logic anymore.  No reasoning.  I felt like I was a bundle of raw emotion, of pain and terror and loss and I didn’t know what was right or wrong anymore.

“That’s - it’s -” 

“OUT!”

I slammed my palms against his chest.  He seemed bewildered by my resistance and stumbled backwards towards the door.  Maybe it was easier because he looked like Maria.  Because I feel comfortable with her and I wasn’t scared of *her*, but also it wasn’t her and that made me *angry*.  But I chased him out of the house.  He didn’t seem willing to fight directly with me.  I stepped out onto the front porch and pulled the door shut behind me.

“You don’t know what he is-” James began to say.

“I know what he is,” I snapped.  “And I know what *you* are.”

He froze.  Stood there as if he were made of stone.  Then he sucked in a hard, shaking breath, and quietly said that it’s been a long time since he was called that.  Or at least, he thought it was a long time.  He didn’t remember much.  It was like waking up from a dream, he said.  No.  A nightmare.

“That’s my body,” he said, pointing towards the house.  “That - that *thing* took it!”

“I know!”  I sucked in breath, trying to calm my racing heart.  “I know.  But - I don’t think he’s entirely to blame.  He… he’s trapped in this as well.”

“I don’t care.”  

He said it so flatly that it was like a slap in the face.  I reeled at the sharpness, at the utter lack of emotion in his words.

“I’m sorry,” he continued, “but I will do *anything* to get out of there and get my life back.”

Slow breaths.  Even breaths.  I couldn’t be angry, even though that was my friend’s voice he was speaking through, even though he *took* her life, even though he was sacrificing *her*.  He was talking to me.  That was good.

I wanted to punch him.  I wanted to hit him and not stop.

“And then what,” I asked.  “What happens to Maria, once you’re back where you belong?”

He hesitated.  His gaze slide sideways and down, careful to avoid my eyes.  It was easier to see him like this, no longer pretending to be someone he wasn’t.  There was a feral, hunted look in his face and his shoulders were pulled in tight, his back hunched as if that could protect him from the world.  I hated seeing it on Maria’s frame.  And for a moment, even though I had never met James in a way where I could form an opinion of him, I hated him.

For only a moment.

“I don’t know,” he whispered.  “Maybe you can take this body and just - put her back.  I really don’t know.  I was just… so desperate.  That’s all I remember feeling.  Like I was losing myself every day and I knew - the *only* thing I knew - was that I was running out of time.”

He shuddered and turned his head away from me.  His eyes darted sideways, covertly glancing at the front door of Grayson’s house.

“I’m still running out of time.”

He needed his body back.  And soon.  Before he lost his hold on this world entirely and before his body with its inhuman occupant finished rotting away like the president had.

Grayson was also running out of time.

“I don’t know what to do,” I whispered.  “I have to lose someone, don’t I?”

James took a deep breath and ran his hand through his hair, then paused and stared at his hand in some confusion as he reached the base of his neck and hadn’t run out of hair yet.  He shook it free, irritably tucking it behind an ear to get it out of the way.  I briefly considered telling him about ponytail holders but thought, nah, let him figure it out.  He was the interloper here.  Maria’s long hair was *his* problem to deal with.

“I can hold on for a little while longer,” he said.  “I don’t remember hardly anything, but I feel like I remember you.  You tried to help me.  If you can think of a solution before then, great, I’ll go along with it.  But if you can’t… then I’m getting my life back.  I’m sorry.”

“J-just promise me one thing,” I said, each word feeling like I was spitting up glass.  “If I can’t fix this… we take Grayson to the basement and… you make the switch there.”

So that we were right next to the pool of water.  So that we could lower Maria’s body into it as soon as it was empty and maybe, just maybe, give her a chance to claw her way out of that darkness.

“Of course.  I - I’m sorry about your friend.  I couldn’t think of anything but escaping.”

He shuddered and hastily walked away from me, his shoulders still hunched and his fingers stuck in the pockets of Maria’s jeans.

Grayson had told me what I needed to do - if I was playing by the rules laid down by the university.  I also walked away from the house, turning in a different direction than Maria had gone.  I was returning to my apartment and I wasn’t thinking straight, I wasn’t thinking clearly at all.  I was almost there, the turn that led to my street was up ahead, when a voice stopped me cold.

“Looking for this?” the devil asked from behind me.

I spun.  He stood there, twirling the stake between his fingers.  He held it out towards me.

“Did you know?” I demanded, my voice rising until it was almost a shriek.  “Did you know this would happen to Maria?”

“Goodness, no,” he replied hastily.  “I can’t see the future.”

“But you gave me the stake.”

He took a sharp breath and stared down at me, his normally cheerful demeanor gone.  That cunning calculation was back in his eyes.  This was the trickster in a rare moment of honesty, the glib mask set aside, leaving exposed the treacherous cunning.

“*I cannot see the future*.”

He enunciated each word carefully and firmly.  It made me pause, made me catch my breath and stopped my panic for enough heartbeats to catch the importance of what he was saying.

The stake may be unrelated to what happened to Maria.  The choice of what to do with it remains solely mine to make.

“Then what do I do?” I whispered.  “How can I save her?  Can *you* save her?  Is that a bargain I can make?”

“I can’t save her.  But… we can talk.  I can advise.”

Oh, I should have known better.  I should have known.  Trickster or devil - it didn’t matter.  There was always a trap and *merely talking* was the crack their poison slipped through.  But I was desperate and scared and he was so quiet and calm and it was everything I wanted.  

I laid out my options as I saw them.  I could let James take his body back and Grayson would be gone.  Or I could sacrifice Maria to save Grayson.  One choice meant destroying someone I considered a friend to do what was right, the other meant saving the people I cared about by doing something wrong.

“So I have to chose who dies,” I said miserably.  “Maria, James, or Grayson.”

I hated myself for this, but Grayson was the “fairest” choice.  He wasn’t human.  He didn’t belong here.  James had his life ripped away from him, so didn’t he deserve to have it back?  And Maria, wasn’t that obvious?  I was ready to burn the whole campus down if that was what it took to get her back.

I felt sick at the thought of losing Grayson.  That fear I’d felt.  It ate at me.

“The stake,” I said, “it’s unrelated, right?  But… what happens if I use it?”

“I don’t know,” he replied, his voice soft.  “All I can promise you is this *will* change things.  Drastically.  After that, well…”

He trailed off, but I knew what was being left unsaid.  What happened next would be my choice.  It was always meant for humans to make that choice.  To make things *change*.

“Will it change things enough that I can save everyone?” I demanded.

“*I don’t know*.”

A hint of impatience bled into his voice.  His eyes were narrowed in annoyance.

“Stop delaying,” he snapped.  “If you’re going to act, then *do it*.  I might be bad decisions incarnate, but sometimes that is what you humans *need,* you need to be set loose from all your reservations and fears and everything holding you back.”

Sometimes we have to make things worse before they can get better.  I took a sharp breath.  It felt like I was teetering on the edge of a precipice and I could feel the wind at my back, the building storm that would gently usher me over the edge.

“One last question,” I said.  “If the tree dies - will it hurt campus?  Will it hurt the administration?”

This time, he laughed, softly, wryly.  A hint of a smile curved the corner of his lips.

“I’m the devil,” he said.  “What am I infamous for?”

Rebelling against the greatest authority in existence.  Of course.

I took the stake from him.  And then I turned towards the graveyard.

If my only options were to let them take one of my friends from me, then I would take everything I could [from](https://alderrayne.com/) [them](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/).
