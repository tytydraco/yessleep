Like, I don’t mean that metaphorically. I don’t mean “it’s yellow” or “it goes bad faster than you think.” I mean I have strong, growing evidence that time itself has the physical and behavioral properties of mustard.

This started as a joke. Not an inside joke or a prank but a joke with myself that went way too far.

I was at a hot dog stand near the park—one of those places that hasn’t changed since the 90s. Laminated menu. Cash-only sign that feels more like a threat than a policy. An array of expired bazooka bubblegum shoved inside a glass jar pinned next to the register. I asked for mustard, and the guy behind the counter sighed like I’d requested something morally complicated.

He handed me a packet.

It was already warm.

I squeezed it, and it came out slow. Thicker than it should’ve been. Not expired, just… resistant. Like it didn’t want to move forward unless pressured.

That’s when the thought hit me, fully formed and unhelpful:

That’s how time works.

I laughed it off. Ate the hot dog. Went home.

But the idea stuck to my brain like putty on a hot day. The more I thought about it, the more it fit in ways I didn’t like.

Time doesn’t flow evenly. It clogs. It speeds up when you’re not paying attention and slows down when you need it to hurry. It stains everything it touches. It separates. It never fully washes out.

I started noticing it everywhere.

Mornings were bright and sharp—fresh mustard. Manageable. Then by mid-afternoon, things thickened. Minutes dragged. Conversations stretched. Emails took forever to send but arrived instantly when I wasn’t ready.

By night, time had that old, sour quality. Sticky. Hard to scrub off. Sleep didn’t reset it anymore. It just smeared it into the next day.

I mentioned this to a coworker once, half-joking.

“Doesn’t it feel like time’s gotten… thicker?” I said.

She stared at me for a beat too long. Then she laughed, but it came out brittle.

“Yeah,” she said. “Especially after your thirties.”

That should’ve been the end of it.

Instead, it escalated.

I started testing small things. Not experiments—just observations. If I delayed tasks, time built pressure like a sealed packet. When I finally did the thing, everything rushed out at once. Deadlines, consequences, phone calls I’d forgotten about.

When I stayed busy, time thinned. Slid past unnoticed. No flavor. No resistance.

The worst was waiting.

Waiting rooms. Red lights. Loading screens. That’s when time turned into that grainy, almost-solid paste that sticks to the roof of your mouth. You can feel every second. You can’t swallow it.

I Googled it.

Not “time is mustard.” I’m not an idiot. I searched things like time feels thick and why does waiting feel longer than doing. Normal stuff. Psychology blogs. TED Talks. Nothing useful.

Then, buried in a forum thread from ten years ago, I saw a comment:

That’s because you’re pressing on it.

No explanation. No replies.

Just that.

Things got worse after that.

I started noticing yellow stains where there shouldn’t be any.

Not literal mustard—nothing I could photograph. Just a tint. A heaviness. Like the air itself was slightly off-color. Old places had more of it. Hospitals. DMV offices. Apartments where people had lived too long without leaving.

I noticed it strongest in my reflection.

My face looked… seasoned. Not older exactly. More processed. Like I’d been sitting out longer than I remembered.

One night, around 3 a.m., I woke up with the overwhelming certainty that I was late for something important. Not an appointment. Not work. Something bigger. Something I couldn’t reschedule.

I checked my phone. No notifications. No missed calls.

But my kitchen clock was behind.

Not by hours. By seconds. Just enough that the ticking didn’t line up with the quiet of the room. Each second felt delayed. Thick. Reluctant.

I reached out and adjusted it.

The moment I turned the dial, everything lurched forward.

The fridge kicked on. A car passed outside. My phone buzzed with three notifications at once—emails I hadn’t received before, all marked urgent, timestamps stacked on top of each other.

I understood then.

You don’t move through time.

You apply pressure to it.

The more you push—deadlines, expectations, plans—the faster it squeezes out. The less you push, the more it pools. Gathers. Spoils.

That’s why childhood feels endless. No pressure. Fresh time.

That’s why grief feels sticky. Time sits with you, unmoving, staining everything.

That’s why routines make years disappear. You spread time thin. Barely taste it.

I tried to stop pushing.

I quit my job. Stopped planning. Let days unfold without structure.

Time didn’t free up.

It congealed.

Hours sat on me. Heavy. Suffocating. The yellow tint deepened. I felt preserved instead of alive, like something waiting on a shelf.

I started dreaming about packets. Endless packets. All labeled NOW. All warm.

The dreams ended the same way every time: I’d tear one open, and nothing would come out. The packet would already be empty.

I don’t joke about it anymore.

Because once you notice what time actually is, you realize the problem isn’t that it runs out.

It’s that it never really moves on its own.

Someone is always squeezing it.

And eventually—

there’s nothing left in the packet but the stain.
