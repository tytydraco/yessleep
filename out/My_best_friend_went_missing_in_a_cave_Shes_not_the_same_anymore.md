I don’t know if anyone will see this. The signal’s spotty out here, and the snowstorm’s only getting worse. But if someone reads this—please tell me what to do.

I’ve already tried calling the police. I got through once, just long enough to explain where we are and that my friend’s gone missing. But the blizzard’s too heavy—they said they can’t send anyone until the weather clears. And now the signal keeps dropping, and my messages won’t send. The battery’s almost dead.

I’m stuck in an Airbnb cabin in the middle of nowhere with my best friend, Paige. We came here for a weekend hiking trip, something to clear our heads and escape the noise of the city. It was supposed to be fun. Peaceful. But everything’s gone wrong since we found that cave.

We hadn’t even planned to go off-trail. The snow was already starting to fall heavier, and we should’ve headed back. But Paige spotted the cave halfway up a rocky slope—just a jagged black crack in the mountainside, half-hidden behind frost-covered trees. I told her we should keep going, but she was already climbing toward it, boots kicking up powder as she moved.

“Come on! Just a quick look,” she called over her shoulder, breath fogging in the icy air.

I hesitated at the entrance, heart thudding a little too fast against my ribs. The air seeping from the cave felt wrong—colder than the snow-covered woods around us, with a faint metallic tang that stung the back of my throat. My phone buzzed in my pocket, the battery already dipping into the red.

“Paige, let’s go back. The snow’s getting worse.”

She just laughed and ducked inside; her silhouette swallowed by shadows.

I cursed under my breath and followed her in.

The air changed the moment I stepped inside—dense and damp, thick with the scent of wet stone. My headlamp carved a narrow cone of light through the darkness, illuminating slick rock walls and uneven patches of ice beneath my boots. The tunnel sloped downward as I crept forward, one hand brushing against the cold, rough stone to steady myself. Water dripped somewhere in the distance, each droplet echoing like a slow, deliberate clock.
“Paige?” My voice sounded too small in the vast, suffocating dark.

“Over here!” Her voice echoed from somewhere ahead—distorted by the cavern walls, but still recognizable.

The tunnel narrowed as I moved deeper, forcing me to hunch beneath low-hanging stalactites. The air grew colder with every step, biting through my jacket and numbing my fingers even inside my gloves. My boots slipped against wet stone as I rounded a corner—and then a sound split the silence.

CRACK.

Stone shifting somewhere ahead.

“Paige!” I broke into a half-run, breath hitching in my chest as I scrambled over slick rocks. Dust and rubble filled the air as a section of the tunnel collapsed ahead of me, sealing off the passage in a deafening roar of stone on stone. I coughed against the dust, eyes stinging as I staggered forward and pounded my fists against the jagged wall of rock.

“Paige! Can you hear me?!”

Silence.

Then, faint and distant, I heard her voice.

“...Help... me…”

But something was wrong with the way she said it—drawn out and broken, like the words didn’t fit in her mouth. My pulse pounded in my ears as I pressed my ear to the rock, straining to hear more.

“Paige, hold on! I’m gonna get help—just stay where you are!”

Silence.

Then, just as I turned to leave, I heard something else.

Breathing.

Not mine. Not Paige’s. Something deep and slow, like air rasping through hollow stone.

I bolted.

I don’t remember getting back to the surface. My boots slipped on wet rock as I scrambled through the narrow tunnel, the headlamp bouncing wildly as shadows twisted and stretched around me. My breath burned in my chest, ragged and shallow as panic drove me forward.

Then, suddenly, I was outside again. The air hit my lungs like a slap—freezing and sharp as I staggered into the snow, collapsing to my knees as my pulse thundered in my ears.

Somewhere behind me, I heard footsteps crunching through the snow.

Light. Uneven.

I didn’t look back.

I ran until the cabin appeared between the trees, warm light spilling from its windows like a beacon against the dark. My boots pounded up the porch steps as I fumbled with the door, breath fogging in the air as I threw it open and stumbled inside.

I slammed the door shut and locked it, leaning against the wood as my heart pounded against my ribs. My fingers ached from the cold as I clutched the doorknob, waiting... listening.

Footsteps crunched outside.

Slow. Deliberate.

A shadow passed across the frosted window.

I squeezed my eyes shut, telling myself it was nothing—just the wind or some animal wandering too close. But then the doorknob rattled.

I bit back a cry, pressing my back harder against the wood as the bolt shuddered against the frame. The footsteps paused. Then the knob twisted—once, twice—before falling still.

I held my breath as icy air seeped through the crack beneath the door, numbing my fingers against the wood. My pulse pounded so loudly that I almost didn’t hear the faint creak of hinges as the door swung open an inch.

Then—

“...Paige?”

The door opened wider, and she stepped inside.

Snow clung to her hair and shoulders, melting into droplets that trailed down her pale skin. Her eyes were too wide, the pupils blown out like twin black holes. She stood perfectly still, breathless and silent, as if she hadn’t just hiked through a snowstorm to find me.

“I found my way back,” she said softly.

Her smile was wrong. Too wide. Too still. As if she’d forgotten how to use her face.

“I—how did you—” My voice caught in my throat.

“I don’t remember.”

She stepped past me without a sound, boots leaving faint, wet footprints across the wooden floor. Frost clung to her clothes as she stopped beside the fire, staring into the flames without blinking.

“I’m cold,” she whispered. “Let me stay with you.”

I should’ve left then. I should’ve grabbed my coat, my keys—anything—and run. But the snowstorm had already buried the roads beneath half a meter of snow, and the signal on my phone was gone. No way to call for help. No way to leave.

So, I stayed.

And Paige... she’s not the same anymore.

She doesn’t eat. Doesn’t sleep. Just sits by the window, watching the snow with that strange, hungry look in her eyes. Sometimes, I catch her watching me when she thinks I’m not looking—her gaze too still, too unblinking.

And at night, I hear her whispering to herself in a language I don’t understand.

The first night, I locked my bedroom door. I woke around three in the morning to the sound of her footsteps outside. Slow, bare footsteps pacing just beyond the door. I lay frozen beneath the blankets, breath shallow as I stared at the faint sliver of light beneath the frame.

Then came the laughter.

Soft. Breathless.

Like something half-remembered from a dream.

I squeezed my eyes shut, pressing my hands over my ears as the footsteps continued down the hall.

In the morning, I found scratches on the inside of the cabin windows—thin, deliberate marks carved into the frost as if something had traced its nails across the glass.

Paige just smiled when I asked about them.

“You should’ve left me in the cave,” she said.

The snowstorm’s only gotten worse since then. The windows are half-buried beneath drifts of snow, and the generator’s struggling to keep the heat going. I’ve been rationing what little food we have left, but Paige hasn’t touched a thing.

Last night, I woke to the sound of footsteps outside—soft, shuffling sounds that circled the cabin again and again. I peered through the frost-covered window, but the snow was falling so thickly that I couldn’t see more than a few meters into the trees.

There were no tracks in the snow.

This morning, Paige was gone.

The front door stood open, snow piling against the threshold. I followed her footprints through the woods—bare feet pressed deep into the snow, leaving strange, uneven impressions that seemed to shift if I looked at them too long.

They led me back to the cave.

I should’ve gone back to the cabin.

But I stepped inside.

The air hit me like a slap—cold and wet, thick with the scent of earth and stone. My breath fogged the air as I crept deeper into the tunnel, headlamp slicing through the dark as shadows clung to the rough stone walls.

“Paige?” My voice echoed back at me, thin and hollow.

Somewhere ahead, something moved.

Slow footsteps shuffled against wet rock.

Then I heard her voice.

“Help me…”

It sounded wrong.

I stepped back, heart hammering against my ribs as something shifted deeper in the dark—too large, too heavy. My headlamp caught a glimpse of pale skin and hollow eyes before the shadows swallowed it whole.

I ran.

Branches clawed at my face as I tore through the woods, lungs burning with every breath. The snow clung to my legs, slowing my stride as frost bit into my skin. I didn’t stop until the cabin loomed between the trees, its windows glowing faintly against the dark.

I staggered onto the porch, heart slamming against my ribs as I shoved the door open and collapsed inside. My breath came in ragged gasps as I bolted the door behind me, pressing my back against the wood as I listened.

The snow outside is still falling, thick enough to erase the world. I can hear footsteps circling the cabin—slow, deliberate. Something heavy brushes against the walls, the faint scrape of nails on wood.

I try the phone again—nothing. My messages still won’t send. The battery’s almost dead, and the single bar of signal keeps flickering on and off.

The footsteps stop.

Something presses against the window.

A pale face peers through the frost-covered glass.

It looks like Paige.

But she’s smiling with too many teeth.

Please, if anyone’s reading this... tell me what to do.
