["Why didn't you shoot it?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dh8te4/my_wife_and_i_were_the_highest_bidders_for_a/) My wife asked, referring to the monstrous figure we had just seen hack one of the serial's killer's victims to pieces, before we darted off, deeper into the maze he had built for them.

I simply hung my head in shame, as I held out the empty chamber of my revolver for her to see.

"But why?" She asked, "Isn't the point of having a gun, so that you can use it when needed?"

"Ada, when the grandkids come over, do you really want that thing to be loaded?"

"You lock it up!" She yelled, losing her temper, something she rarely did, before calming herself down. "I'm sorry."

But it didn't bother me. After all, we were in an extraneous situation, locked inside a labyrinth built underneath the serial killer's home that we had just bought in an auction. A serial killer that I had spent my entire career trying to find, and only in retirement, with the help of my wife, was I finally able to.

"So what now?" Ada asked nervously, as we stood there in the dark, unsure of what direction to go, or what passage to take.

"We just keep going. Like you said earlier. Until we find our way out of this place."

My wife, left with no other choice, reluctantly agreed. And so, we both set off into the unknown, our only guiding light that of the flashlight I'd had the foresight to bring with me.

But before we could make it very far, we once again found ourselves arriving at a dead end, where yet another sickly victim of the serial killer was tied up, once again with an IV in their arm.

"You were right," Ava said, "They're all alive down here."

Not long after that, we found another.

And then another.

And then another.

"How many people had disappeared again?" My wife  asked, surely wondering how many more victims we might find down there.

"Over the years? Seven men and seven women." I replied.

"I think one version of the myth is like that. Seven men and seven women."

"The myth?"

"Of the minotaur. Like you had nicknamed him."

I suddenly froze in horror, as I realized how literal the analogy really was. Sure, after the serial killer had carved mazes into the last whereabouts of his victims, I had suspected he was keeping them in a "Labyrinth,"and had always jokingly referred to him as "The Minotaur."

But now that we had found a literal monster in the maze, and my wife had pointed out that seven men and seven women had disappeared, it had become more clear than ever that its architect was not the minotaur, but King Minos, and the labyrinth was not a happy accident, but some sort of fucked up immersive homage to that very myth.

"But why?" I asked, after sharing my thoughts with my wife. "Why would he go into such detail?"

"Perhaps to better understand it, you have to go back to the myth itself. Why did Minos create the labyrinth in the first place?"

I thought about it for a minute, before it all came back to me.

"Because his son, Androgeus, was killed by the Athenians. So as a punishment, he forced Athenian men and women to be sacrificed to the Minotaur."

"Did Milton Aster have a son?"

"What are you getting at?" I asked.

"Just answer the question." Ada insisted.

I thought about it for a moment.

"No. I mean... yes... but he died. Along with his wife."

"Well there you have it."

"Have it?"

"The minotaur is his son."

"But how?"

"I don't know how, or why, but I just have a feeling."

"I just don't understand." I said, trying to rack my brain around how Milton Aster's son could still be alive, and why he was running around in an underground maze.

But before I could get too lost in thought, we were interrupted...

...By the very sound we had heard earlier, just before the "monster" had stormed into our passage, and hacked the first victim to pieces.

Suddenly, the entire structure rattled, and the earth below our feet shook, as the sounds of growling, huffing, and stomping could be heard growing closer... and closer... and closer... until...

...The giant man came barreling around the corner of the maze, sword in hand, and howled.

"AAAARRGGHH!" It cried out, as I shone my flashlight light into his eyes, and was finally able to see the monster's head.

It was that of a man's, covered in a burlap sack, with holes cut out for eyes and mouth, with horns seemingly drilled into his head.

"What... the... fuck!" I cried out, as Ada took a step back and screamed.

"That's the fucking minotaur!" She called out, as she put her arm around the three new victims we'd found and attempted to back them away.

"RRAWWRGGHH!!" The giant screamed, as it raised it's sword above it's head.

But just then in that very moment, my flashlight's battery died, and the entirety of the passage went dark.

Not knowing what else to do, and fearing that  the minotaur would strike at any moment, I reached out into the darkness, took Ada by the hand, and ran in the opposite direction of the monster.

"But the victims!" Ada called out.

"Just run!" I urged her, as we darted away down the tunnel, to the sound of the poor victim's being torn apart.

A good distance later, we finally stopped to catch our breath, and held each other, shaking, in the pitch black dark of the labyrinth.

All was quiet, except the heavy inhales and exhales of our exhausted panting, and what I swear was the sound of both our beating hearts, still racing from the encounter and the escape that followed.

And as we both stood there in the darkness, terrified, and fearing that there was no end in sight. The most curious of things happened.

I saw the faintest glimmer of light, far away into the distance.

"Ada," I said, "Look!"

She turned and saw what I saw. "But what could it be? It doesn't look like daylight?"

A few minutes later, after following the tunnel to the source of the light, we arrived at the center of the maze we found, of all things, a living room. A small living room. But a living room no less. With a refrigerator. And two beds.

And there, sitting in the center of the room, rocking back and forth in a rocking chair, was an old woman, her hair white, her hands wrinkled, and her eyes squinting.

"Come, Bobby, it's dinner time." She asked, clearly mistaking us for someone else.

Until Ada and I both took a step closer, and she realized we weren't who she thought we were.

"Oh, you're not Bobby." She said, correcting herself. "Then who are you? No one else is supposed to be down here."

"Is Bobby your son ma'am?" I asked.

"Yes."

"Is he the one with the sword, dressed like a bull?"

"Yes."

"Can I just ask... why?"

That's when the old woman signaled us to sit down in a couple chairs beside her, and began to tell us the story of her son, and the labyrinth. "As a boy, Bobby was always fond of Greek Myths. His favorite was the story of the Minotaur. He'd always run around, pretending to be the minotaur in the maze. But after the accident, he couldn't separate reality from fantasy, and the 'real' Bobby never returned. All that was left… was the minotaur."

"But why the victims? Why do you keep people down here?"

"Because his father..."

"Milton Aster. That's was- I mean is- your husband?"

"Yes. He wanted his son to be happy. So he created this place for him. Labyrinth, the sacrificed Athenians, and all."

"Where are the others?" Ada asked. "We only found four people down there."

"Oh, they're gone."

"Gone?" I asked.

But before she could answer, suddenly the monster himself came storming down the passage. Closer... and closer... and closer.

But when he arrived at the living room, and saw his mother, the Minotaur, or should I say, Bobby, simply relaxed his composure, and took a seat at a nearby table, where a plate and silverware had been waiting.

"Where have you been? It's dinner time." His mother said, as she walked over to the refrigerator.

But what we didn't expect… was what she removed from it...

...A plastic bag full of body parts, clearly that of Milton Aster's former victims...

...And what she would do with them, as she proceeded to pour the body parts onto Bobby's plate, and he proceeded to feast on them.

Ada's eyes grew wide in horror, as I resisted the urge to throw up.

But suddenly, in that moment, while the minotaur and his mother were distracted, I spotted the key to the trap door at the entrance of the labyrinth and, taking Ada by the hand, seized the opportunity, stole the keys, and ran off, back into the dark tunnels of the maze, before the monster or the old woman had a chance to react.

Not long after, the hatch opened and we emerged from the labyrinth, our eyes squinting, as they adjusted to the daylight, before immediately calling my former colleagues at the police department.

And in a matter of hours, they had raided the maze with guns drawn, swept the entirety of the structure, and detained the "Minotaur" and his mother.

But unlike the myth, neither my wife and I, or the cops, were ever able to save any of the victims.

So, in keeping with the tradition of not startling the townspeople, the police kept the arrests, and what had happened under Milton Aster's house, under wraps, leaving the cold cases as just that.

And while I didn't agree with that decision, I accepted that I was retired, and it wasn't my decision to make. And basked in the closure that had come from finally knowing Milton Aster was the serial killer behind the disappearances.

When the cops finally left us, to what was now a home with little purpose, my wife simply asked me.

"We don't have to keep living here do we?"

To which I replied, "Oh fuck no."

In no time, we had bought a new home and had sold Milton Aster's house.

And now, whenever I sit on the deck behind my house, looking out at my backyard, I wonder if the poor suckers that bought the last house… 

…Will ever discover the "Minotaur's Labyrinth" in its backyard.
