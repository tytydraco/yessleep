Ms. Hazelwood's Home for the Orphaned is where I grew up. Well, grew up until I was 15. And no, when I was 15 I didn't get adopted by a loving family with a picket fence and a dog named Buddy. I'm not quite sure why I'm writing this down, Ms. Hazelwood is certainly dead by now. I guess I'm just reaching out. Seeing if I can find anyone else who grew up here. 

I'm not going to name where this home was as I still live in the area and am trying to keep a low profile there, but this happened in the 80s, in an English speaking country you've probably heard of before. 

The orphanage had been around for at least one hundred years, and by the 80s, orphanages were certainly phasing out, but a few stragglers stayed behind. Mine was one of them. 

There were only ever about a dozen other kids there. Some came and went. However, my best friends there were a girl about a year older than me named Laura, and a boy around my age named Frank. My name is Darren, by the way. We were all close because- well, to be honest, we all knew none of us had any chance to be adopted. We weren't cute, well behaved, nothing a doting parent would want. We knew all we had was each other. 

Most of our lives took place in three rooms- the boy's bed corridors, the dining room, and the small courtyard just outside the dining room. The orphanage was actually a lot bigger than those three places we frequented, but a lot of it was restricted to us. The orphanage also doubled as Ms. Hazelwood's own home, so we weren't allowed to enter it. But you guys aren't here to learn about some sad boy whose parents died. So I'll get into it. 

There's really no "start" to this story, weird shit happened throughout our entire lives, so I guess I'll begin the first time I remember something strange happening. I was eight, and Frank and I were kicking a ball we had stolen from the courtyard in one of the hallways of the east wing, the area in Ms. Hazelwood's house where the orphanage was. We weren't being careful, and I ended up kicking it down a staircase that led to the cellar. None of us had ever been down that staircase, there was really no point, the door at the end was so heavy we weren't even sure it opened. It was an old ass house, there were a lot of rooms that simply weren't used for anything. If anything, we were all kind of scared of that door. Some kids theorized there were monsters or an evil robot down there, and I pretended not to believe them, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't expecting a massive hunk of metal to crush the door and steal our ball.  

Frank and I both froze in place. I was hoping he'd go get it, and I'm sure he was thinking the same. 

"What are you guys doing?" We heard from behind us, and I remember us both jumping in fear. It was just Laura. 

We sheepishly explained to her what had happened to our ball, and asked her if she could go down and get it. 

"Okay," she said. "But I'm not going down there all by myself." 

Together, we all crept towards the staircase. I felt like we were in Scooby Doo. The stairs felt darker, and longer, than it looked like from above. When we got to the bottom, I grabbed the ball and motioned for Frank and Laura to come upstairs. Frank followed me, but not Laura. She had pressed her ear to the door, and her brow furrowed. She beckoned Frank and I over, and we cautiously stepped towards her and pressed our ear against the door as well. 

It was...knocking. Something was behind that door, knocking. Like it wanted us to open it for it. We listened as it got more and more frantic and loud. Eventually, it slammed so hard that it made my ears vibrate. All three of us backed up in horror as we heard another sound. A scream. Terrified, we all sprinted back up the stairs. I dropped the ball and it bounced back down but I didn't care at this point. I just wanted to get out of there.

That night, I lied awake in my bunk. Frank was on the bottom bunk, and judging from the tossing and turning I heard, he also couldn't sleep. The boy's bed corridors happened to share a wall with the hallway where we had played that afternoon. I listened in silence as a loud and almost ear piercing creak, or scrape, rang through the room. 

The next morning, out of curiosity, I crept down to the door and pressed my ear to it. I hadn't noticed up until then, but the ball had disappeared. Did I hear...bouncing? 

That was the first ever odd occurrence. Weird stuff kept happening, though. We'd hear what sounded like murmuring from the walls eating dinner, while Ms. Hazelwood just told us to ignore it. Laura would swear she saw something out of the corner of her eye before it quickly darted into the restricted area. And then there was Jason. 

Jason was probably about 12 or 13, and came to the orphanage when me and my friends were 15 or 16. At this point so many kids came and went I usually didn't bother to learn their names, but I had a soft spot for Jason. The three of us kind of took him under our wings, and he became like a younger brother to us. It wasn't long, though, before Ms. Hazelwood had sat him down and told him he had been adopted, and to start packing his bags. The next morning, he had gone home. A few weeks went by, and we had begun to put it all out of our minds. There was something else that caught our mind, anyways.

Laura was hanging out with us in the boys' corridor, when we heard something. That same fucking creaking I remembered from all those years ago. There was then another sound. Like a human running, but it sounded louder. Almost like it was on all fours. 

The three of us exchanged glances. Frank slowly stood up and opened the door as Laura and I tried to be brave. 

We caught a glimpse of something. It was haunting. Whatever it was, it looked back at us. It stood up and we watched it struggle to find balance, like when a baby first learns to stand. I was tempted to hide. But that's when I realized something. Those eyes. I had seen them before.

"Jason?"

I looked at Laura and Frank. They saw it, too. The thing bounded away from us. With a bit of hesitation, we followed him. Until we reached where we saw him go. The cellar door.

Feeling a bit of Deja-vu, we all crept down the stairs. And to our horror, the door had been opened. We looked at each other, a bit scared, but we knew we had to go in. 

To say we were speechless was an understatement. 

It smelled awful, like rot. Everything felt slimy, and it felt colder in here than anywhere else in the orphanage. Jason ran around a corner, and we were all too stunned to follow. We looked around and saw framed photos of kids. I recognized them. These were the kids in the orphanage. The kids who had been adopted.

What had really happened to them? 

"You aren't supposed to be here." We jumped at a voice behind us. Ms. Hazelwood. 

She began to walk towards us. I had so many questions, but could only stutter. 

 I looked back to see Jason, or what used to be Jason, looking back at me. He was crouched in a corner. What had Ms. Hazelwood done to him? To all of the kids? 

I glanced at Ms. Hazelwood again. I had never noticed her posture before. Or how pale her skin was. I looked at Jason, then back at Hazelwood. 

If you took off the hair extensions, the makeup, the nice clothes, it was clear. She was one of those...things. And now, it was our turn. To become one of them.

Suddenly, something jumped out from behind me. Jason had leapt out from his corner and pounced on Ms. Hazelwood. I was frozen in horror as I watched her thrown onto all fours. She looked much more natural that way. I caught a glimpse of her eyes. So unhuman. Like looking into a doll's eye. Just not what life is supposed to look like. 

Jason ripped a chunk of flesh off Ms. Hazelwood. I watched as he grew even bigger. He looked back at us. 

"RUN." He managed to spit out. 

And so we did. We ran up the cellar stairs, hearing Ms. Hazelwood's animal-like screams of agony. We ran through the hallways, into the restricted wing. Laura tripped over something as she was running, and I heard her scream when we all noticed what it was. A bone. 

We couldn't let that stop us. We kept running until we saw a door. It seemed to get further and further away the more we ran. 

Eventually though, we burst through the door and looked around us.

The orphanage wasn't built in a quaint little village like Ms. Hazelwood has always told us. In fact, we didn't know what we were looking at. It was dark and smoggy outside, and dead trees surrounded us. Frank nudged us, and pointed to the house we had just escaped from. 

It looked nothing like it did on the inside. It was disgusting. It sat abandoned, the wood rotting and the windows broken. Cobwebs filled every corner. 

We didn't know what to do, so we just picked a direction and walked. We walked for what seemed like forever until we found a road. A man in a large truck had picked us up, and drove us to a building. We had no fucking clue what was going on, we had been raised isolated in an orphanage. I found out later what we were in was called a police station. 

People stared a lot at me when I left. 

Laura, Frank, and I were sent to live in a group home for a few years. The lady who ran it was named Denise, and she was nicer. 

It's been years since this all happened. I live on my own now, in a small apartment. It's not much, but it's nice, and I've taken a liking to Taco Bell. Last I heard, Laura is going to a community college, and Frank is a cashier at a grocery store. Life has a way of moving on.

But sometimes, when I'm walking at night, I swear I see a massive monstrous looking figure. He never follows me, or runs away from me. He just watches me from a distance. And every once in a while, I lock eyes with him. And I know exactly who he is.
