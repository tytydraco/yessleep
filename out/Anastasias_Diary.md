# The Train Hunt

**Year 1849**

To my sisters, or snooping servants or guards—should I discover you rifling through my personal effects, you had better pray the Countess finds and delivers punishment before I do. 

Despite my desire for expression, our Countess, Lady Elizabeth Bathory, insists that writing beyond academics or letters to the aristocracy is rubbish. I informed her that academics were for humans attempting to grasp their pathetic mortal coils and kissing the feet of any human aristocracy was almost equally, perhaps more so. My words were received poorly, but 'tis true nonetheless. Do we not live long lives of perfect health? It grows tedious here, and I have decided to seek some new —experiences beyond that of academia and the livestock they bring from afar. I wish to experience the world. Its vast wonders. And, of course, its delicacies. Who knows? I may wish to relive, perhaps even share with others.

I write this after conceiving a most intriguing idea. The Countess insists we must always hunt away from large crowds, but what if the crowds were contained and came to us? Trains are the most perfect invention! Many humans voluntarily board these iron cages, packed together with only two simple routes of entry and exit. When this notion struck me, I realized there was no need for greed. If I shared the venture with one of my sisters, we could divide the catch and ensure no soul escaped to tell the tale. The plan was flawless!

Brunhilda, though reluctant for fear the Countess might not be pleased should she discover our whereabouts, agreed to my proposal when I revealed I had previously left the castle without our lady's knowledge. In fact, I had been departing on a frequent basis, learning about the outside world. A train full of wealthy, well-fed passengers would be passing just a brisk flight away, near Belgium.

"Quarter Master, Brunhilda and I are taking some fresh air. You need not wake the Countess. In fact, it would be beneficial for such a healthy man as yourself to carry on with your duties and, should the Countess awaken and inquire of our whereabouts, inform her that we retired late the previous evening for our studies and are likely resting in our coffins," I told the quarter master with my natural smile. His breathing was nearly steady, though he could not hide his fear. No human can.

"I understand. You are likely asleep. The lady should remain at rest for another day or two," he informed me, though she always woke early. That mattered little—she herself forbade disturbing a member's coffin.

The castle was silent. Not a chirp from a rat, not a whisper from an insect. Only Victor, the servant, with his quick and uneven footsteps. Most guards were active during the day, leaving only empty hallways filled with stale air. Instead of descending to the great hall, we ascended to the northwest tower. Stars filled the night like snow frozen in time. We walked to the edge, my steps outpacing my sister's in my eagerness, though I waited for her before stepping onto the rampart. The stone was smooth and beautiful, but not as beautiful as the moon over the countryside. My eyes found Brunhilda's, meeting her gaze. We shared a smile, then fell with time moving slower than moments before.

My eyes darted to the ground as bones pierced my unnatural skin, followed by more bones wrapped in natural flesh. Before reaching halfway down, my wings expanded, tilted, and lifted my gaze back to the countryside. I turned my sight skyward to search for my sister, who flew further forward and higher than myself—not that I was surprised. The dive gave me a sense of life rarely felt by most of my kind.

Trees bunched together, dark and damp from all the rain of early spring. The farmland and town were easy to spot. They were the only ones who knew of the castle, but never dared speak of it since we last graced them with our presence. They had even torn down their old church, smelling of rotten fish and unkept livestock. The Countess made it clear: once a decade, we would all choose one of the villagers and do with them whatever we pleased. Should they tell anyone of our presence or think of leaving the safety of our realm, we would take not just anyone, but everyone we desired.

Before I saw the smoke from the train, Brunhilda called out in our ancient cry. My eyes lifted, widened with excitement and, if I possessed a beating heart, I am certain it would be pumping nearly as fast as my prey's.

She adjusted her flight to match my speed. "I should start from the rear. You should begin at the front and halt it."

Her suggestion was both greedy and ignorant. "That is foolish! Why stop the train when a moving train is harder to escape? Besides, it was my idea. The richest blood is in the back, and I would like the first bite. You take the front—dispatch the conductor, stokers, and fireman first. I'll work my way back from the passenger cars."

She snarled but understood my reasoning was more than fair, and so agreed to my counter-proposal. "If you insist. We should be swift, just in case Lady Elizabeth wakes early. You said she might."

That I did say, but in that moment I cared not. A rush overcame my mind and body, leaving me with no concern save for this venture. Never had I enjoyed so many humans gathered together. They were livestock that herded themselves. Exhilarating!

We descended almost in unison, separating as we selected our targets. I dove, flattening my wings to slow my fall. The last grey-brown car approached closer. A thud echoed as I struck my mark—a cargo and luggage car, which wasn't particularly entertaining, but I understood there could be no survivors. I searched for a moment. No heat. No heartbeat. I rushed to the next car, claws tapping against wood and metal. No humans. I was efficient, if somewhat loud and careless, but the train's rolling wheels on the railroad afforded me some leeway. Perfect—they would be trapped soon enough.

Before leaping down, I noticed a man behind the door, gently pulling back. The man was warm and young, though not entirely in perfect condition. He had been drinking, which sours the sweet saltiness of their blood. The creature was unbalanced, possibly why he abruptly leaned against the rails. Not my favorite flavor, but a good start. After all, there were many such passengers to sample.

I spread my wings between cars as he took a swig from his flask. Fangs extended and my body lowered. When my claws gripped the rail beside him, causing him to turn, I struck. My teeth sank in before he could release a scream—his blood was still warm. Delicate. Delicious!

The man made desperate attempts to pull me off, pushing with all his young muscle and strength, but it was little more than waves against rock. The gentleman with his now-bloody chest gurgled what I could only assume were cries for help. His head turned to watch me drinking his life essence. Perhaps it was because I had transformed back into a beautiful woman and he found it puzzling that such an innocent little blonde could perform such monstrous acts. It was my favorite form for executing all my cruelest deeds. My dress had been torn away in the wind, which would be considered indecent by these people.

The door creaked and a meager voice followed. I turned to hear a high-pitched scream from a young woman—perhaps a lover, I pondered, though it mattered not. My hand reached for her throat, and rather than bite, I crushed her windpipe, feeling a burst of air release. Her bones turned to powder and fragments. When she dropped, many began to stir in their sleeping compartments. I stepped beyond the moonlight into a dimly lit corridor, the floor paved with luxurious red carpet and dark wood framed in steel surrounding me. The second compartment was empty—probably because the occupants had been out past their bedtime. How naughty! But the others all contained new cuisine to sample.

Then a conductor approached, his eyes darkened with exhaustion, shoulders slouched from a long day and night on watch duty. I thought it best if he rested for a while. Perhaps forever?

"What in God's name happened, my Lady? Where did all this blood come from?" I realized my face was likely quite a mess. The young man appeared rather confused, and I was about to finish him quickly and move on, but what fun would that be?

He wore a clean, wrinkle free uniform second only to his clean shave. But his soft face full of color begged to be drained.

"It was awful. Dreadful! The man tried to hurt me," I looked down to feign tears, and that was his cue to aid a dear helpless lady in shock.

"My lady what's wrong," he placed two warm, surprisingly rough hands on the sides of my head before I looked into his sparkling blue eyes.

"I am just so thirsty! I need a drink and something to eat," I said, forming a smile, which caused him to release me from his warm embrace.

My left hand shot and grabbed and squeezed his neck, but didn't crush it. I didn't want to crush it, only to halt his airflow and cease the screams that he'd soon use to alert others. Naturally, his eyes were wide. I wondered what he thought of my unnatural strength. What questions did he have for me? If I had more time alone with him, I might even ask him some questions regarding my writings.

I pursed my lips, leaning forward. Despite his moans and muffled cries, my lips touched his. They were warm and intense and their owner fell into a trance. One I knew he would not break. No man or woman had before. He was mine.

"I really love the soft men. They taste sweet and fine, unlike stale men dirty from labor. But they at least put up a fight. Hehe!" I told him in what Elizabeth called my "playful" and "bedtime" voice.

His eyes widened and he realized his doom. And I obliged, half releasing his neck. My fangs struck, piercing skin. Deep inside. With my mouth I ripped open a fist size hole in his neck. Blood sprayed wildly. Fangs retracted, my mouth returned wider than before. Wider than any human could manage and with it captured everything. The ticket collector became a water fountain in sound and purpose. Yes, I had given him purpose. A job far above collecting trivial pieces of paper. He was part of me, now.

In my own trance I didn't catch that the passenger doors had opened as their occupants squeamishly peeped their little heads as though, behind those doors, they were safe. A woman in a gorgeous blue dress was the first to release a scream that made me positively giggle with delight, followed by an older couple. I really liked that dress.

"Oh my!" I exclaimed, clapping my bloodied hands together in mock surprise. "It appears the ticket collector is no longer capable of carrying out his duties. How terribly inconvenient! My name is Anastasia, and fret not, dear passengers—I shall personally collect your... *dues*." I curtsied playfully, unable to hide my wicked grin as their screams filled the air like the most beautiful symphony.

Everyone began to scream and scramble about like startled mice. Even the old man was hollering! When prey runs, I simply must chase—it's only proper etiquette, after all. In one graceful leap, I could have blocked the beautiful lady in blue from escaping, but why rush such delightful entertainment? They weren't going far on a moving train!

The trio stumbled toward the dining car in their panic. The old man lagged behind—the elderly ones were always so terribly slow and their blood so disappointingly stale. But waste not, want not, as they say!

"Oh, sir! Allow me to help you with your... *departure*," I called sweetly before wrapping my delicate hand around his arm and hurling him off the side of the train with a cheerful wave. "Safe travels!"

The ladies had nearly reached the far door when I sauntered into the dining car, humming a little tune. They frantically tugged at the door handle as cold air rushed in, but before they could escape, it slammed shut. Dear Brunhilda had begun her own performance! The sound of their renewed screams was simply *music* to my ears.

"Now, now, little doves," I called in my sweetest voice, "there's no need to be so terribly rude! I only wish to make your acquaintance!"

The door wouldn't budge for them—how perfectly convenient! I decided to make a proper entrance. Positioning myself just so, I launched forward with both fists extended like a battering ram. Wood splintered, glass shattered, and the entire door frame exploded inward in the most satisfying crash!

To my absolute delight, I accidentally burst right through the old woman's skull like a ripe melon—what a wonderfully unexpected bonus! Her companion in the blue dress toppled over, whether from quick reflexes or simply tripping over her own skirts, I couldn't say. But oh, how perfectly this was working out!

I landed squarely atop another gentleman who had the audacity to yell at me. How frightfully impolite!

"My sincerest apologies, good sir!" I chirped brightly, not moving from where I sat perched on his chest. "But you see, my dinner was attempting to run away. Have you ever experienced such discourtesy? Food that tries to escape before being properly eaten? The absolute *nerve*!"

I tilted my head expectantly, waiting for his response with the patience of a well-mannered lady. Instead, he merely screamed directly into my face—such appalling manners!

"Oh dear, that simply won't do," I tutted, shaking my head in disappointment. "If you cannot engage in proper conversation, then I'm afraid we must end our chat."

I stretched my jaw before my mouth lunged toward the young man's neck, teeth piercing flesh to pull his warm blood into me. Its taste sent a rush through my body unlike anything I had felt in perhaps years. Once I had drained him properly, I rose gracefully from his now-still form.

The remaining passengers scattered like roaches when the lights come on—some fleeing back toward where I'd come from, others rushing toward the front of the train. Such delicious panic! I decided to intercept the middle-aged couple before they could spoil my fun.

With theatrical flair, I pounced upon the couple and began systematically removing their limbs, humming a waltz as I worked. Not for sustenance, mind you, but for the sheer artistry of it all! How wonderfully different we sisters were! Where I savored the performance and the fear in their eyes, she relished the pure, raw violence of the hunt. I wanted to paint this entire train the most gorgeous shade of crimson—wouldn't that be simply divine?

"What do you think?" I called out gaily to the remaining passengers who cowered in the corners, waving a severed arm like a painter's brush. "Red is such a lovely color for traveling, don't you agree? So much more interesting than these dull browns and grays!"

I began conducting an imaginary orchestra with my grisly implements, laughing as I decorated the walls in sweeping arcs of scarlet. "Even that cold Elizabeth couldn't deny that a crimson train would be absolutely *magnificent*! Perhaps I'll invite her for the grand tour when I return home. What a delightful homecoming gift this shall make!"

After we finished painting this train cars seats, walls, and ceiling, I insisted on a second pass, thoroughly searching for stowaways that may forget to pay their dues. 



As it were, my clumsy partner in crime had missed a wonderfully sweet couple on their honeymoon. I wanted to savour such a sweetness, but a dim light peeked beyond the window and above the forest. Brunhilda and I sank our teeth for a quick bite, then returned to search for loose lips that, when questioned by German authorities, might reveal dark secrets they shouldn’t. 



Before long, me and Brunhilde pushed into the sky with our wings towards the castle. The train stopped behind us was my first art piece for the world to see. The only shame was they wouldn’t know the author of such a grand piece.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**May 10th, 1849**

Perhaps it is too soon to write of this again, though it would be far more prudent to forget writing entirely and burn these pages before the Countess's curiosity is aroused enough to read them. I must find a hiding place even Her Grace would never contemplate searching.

Alas, I simply cannot cease in the midst of my most exquisite and beautiful art—recreating such divine experiences through words. I can almost hear the feeble protests of human minds, "Anastasia, you destroyed those people's lives on that train. You create nothing. You are pure evil." Perhaps it is true that even some of my sisters may be slow to grasp the beauty of my artistry, but as a developing artist, I shall be gracious and illuminate my philosophy.

Art is, when stripped to its most primitive essence, the experience of its creator made manifest. Mortal painters capture their love for landscapes in oils and canvas. An Englishman might commission a regal self-portrait adorned with symbols of his accomplishments—a leather-bound tome to display his scholarly devotion, or a gleaming rifle from his exotic hunts to demonstrate his prowess and daring.

I, and many of my kin, do not find humans to be exotic creatures in themselves. I dare say their kind are far more akin to pests scurrying aimlessly about. Despite this, such fleshy creatures are integral to my most exhilarating experiences, and though I have thought little of these vermin for the better part of my three hundred years, they have become my greatest joy. So much so that if they were no longer to exist, my immortality would become unbearable. But they ARE alive! They are plentiful! Each one capable of satiating my deepest appetites. In those precious moments when they cry, beg, or bleed before their death, they transform into something more exotic than the rest of their existence.

These experiences transcend far beyond their pitiful individual lives, rippling outward to their kin near and far, echoing down through their bloodlines for generations. Is such magnificent art not worth infinitely more than the fleeting specks they dare call "life?" The truth is simple: without these experiences I would become hollow inside. One might even say dead, then one might also argue that it would be murder to deny my right to experience these moments of life. Creation!

Tonight the Countess awakens from her deep slumber to inspect the fresh livestock blood and, perhaps, claim one of the creatures for her own amusement. But why should she be the sole beneficiary of such delectable company? It seems rather selfish, does it not?

For such an event, the Countess Bathory demands we wear our regal corsets made for our house, the Feminarum Sanguinis.

A sumptuous gown of deep crimson silk that shimmers with otherworldly richness, as if the fabric itself had been woven from liquid rubies and moonbeams. The bodice is fitted with a square neckline that plunges daringly low, designed to ensnare men's gazes and render them helpless. It is edged in delicate ivory lace that cascades like frozen tears. The corset beneath is constructed of whalebone and crimson brocade, cinched to create an impossibly perfect silhouette.

Intricate white embroidery adorns the stomacher in patterns that resemble both elegant florals and something more sinister—thorny vines that seem to writhe across the fabric, punctuated by pearl-white beading that catches candlelight like drops of luminescent blood.

Though many of the women favor heavy, cumbersome skirts, I commissioned a maiden to create a more fitting, streamlined version with a sleeker silhouette. The way it complements my figure invokes both subtle and apparent jealousy among my peers. That is all it ever amounts to—fragile, pathetic jealousy. Though Brunhilda can be simple in her pursuits and Anya remains cold from words to touch, they possess more spine than the rest of our house. The others speak more words than a hundred mortals while accomplishing far less.

At the waist, a wide sash of ivory silk is tied in an elaborate bow, the ends trailing nearly to the floor, while the neckline is adorned with a choker of alternating crimson garnets and milk-white pearls that pulse against pale, cold flesh.

When light gleamed through the crack in my coffin, I rose eagerly to see who approached—guard or intruder. The wooden cover fell as I rose vertically, toes pointed and afloat. It was Gregor, the oldest guard still serving and one of Elizabeth's favorites. Despite the adrenaline and hunger threatening to overtake my body, I held still, retracting my fangs while giving the old man a smile. "Is it time, good man Gregor?"

He nodded. "Yes, I've awoken the others. Lady Bathory rose early and requested that you all attend the dining hall at your earliest convenience. With proper attire, of course, milady." His words echoed as his shadow moved with the flames of a large candle.

I nodded with a smile, planting my feet on the coffin's wooden boards. "I shall fetch my attire at once. Rest assured the Countess will not have to wait long." Though the man was hardly afraid of me due to his long standing with his mistress and ability to fulfill her every need, he remained polite when saying "earliest convenience." She had no need for such veiled language with us, so she was often far more direct and, I dare say, even more brutish than Brunhilda. But when you bathe in the blood of thousands and overcome the twisted realm of the fae, one might understand her limitations in manner and tact. As she might also say, I was in no place to judge.

"Milady," he nodded, then turned, walking through the darkness and dampness with quick yet calm and consistent steps. The man was focused. Sometimes I wondered how quickly that tough demeanor would evaporate if I had my way with him, though it was wise to use humans to watch over us. Perhaps, however, there would come a day when I might walk free both day and night.

After a few moments, I followed behind, my feet rising just above the floor once again. His heartbeat was so steady that a pocket watch might be less accurate for counting seconds. After keeping my distance until he turned the corner, I flew up the stairs to my personal chambers. I nearly passed by until Sonya's snark alerted my ear. I turned my head and saw her already dressed, accompanied by her two pets whose names I never bothered to remember. They were human and, unless they were Gregor, the quarter master, or other senior staff, were of no concern to me.

Even more entertaining, I caught one of them exchanging a glance that told me he might prefer blondes to that soulless redhead. Not that I possessed a soul, but I was certainly more interesting than that unimaginative hag who called herself a "lady."

Inside my chambers, a maiden awaited—pale and trembling. I had never seen the poor dear before. This must have been her first time attending a true lady of the night. I smiled, hoping to reassure her while my thoughts lingered on her pretty face, brunette hair, and pulsing neck. Truly, the best time to feed was when they were excited or terrified. But no—I could not take from her. At least, not until the feast was concluded. Perhaps I could read her portions of my diary should I refrain from spilling her blood.

"Beautiful, would you be a darling and tend to me? I have a feast to attend," I spoke with intent, unable to hide the hint of excitement in my voice.

She returned nervous nods before replying in a delicate voice, “yes, your Grace. I do good work. I was told your dress is unfit for the ceremony, but I kept it in case you still wish to use it.

She was fearful, yes, but also a clever girl. Perhaps I would spare her.
