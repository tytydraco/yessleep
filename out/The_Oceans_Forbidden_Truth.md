Dear Reader,

You don't know me, and it's better if it stays that way. My anonymity is the only thing protecting me right now. What I am about to share might sound insane, but it is the truth that humanity needs to know.

I work as an underwater imaging technician for Google Street View. My job was supposed to be simple: capture and map the oceans for the public to explore. But the truth is much darker.

A long time ago, before I even took this job, a discovery was made in the ocean depths. A skeleton of a colossal creature that wraps around the world not once, but twice. The creature was nicknamed "Jörmungandr," after the Norse mythological serpent.

For those unfamiliar with the legend, Jörmungandr, also known as the Midgard Serpent, is a giant creature from Norse mythology. According to the legend, Jörmungandr was so large that it could encircle the world and bite its own tail. During Ragnarök, the Norse apocalypse, Jörmungandr was said to emerge from the ocean depths, bringing chaos and destruction.

What most people believe about ocean exploration is a lie. They say only 5% of the ocean has been explored, but this statistic is manipulated to hide the truth about Jörmungandr. In reality, much more of the ocean has been mapped and studied, but knowledge of this creature has been deliberately suppressed.

The skeleton of Jörmungandr is unlike any known creature. Its form resembles that of a Chinese dragon, a serpentine body with elongated, sinuous curves. This adds another layer of mystery, as it connects to various cultural depictions of dragons around the world.

Theories have emerged about the true nature of Jörmungandr. Some scientists believe this creature may have been responsible for the separation of Pangaea, the supercontinent that existed millions of years ago. Others suggest that Jörmungandr is the origin of many marine monster myths across cultures around the world.

For a long time, one crucial aspect of Jörmungandr remained hidden: its skull. The location of the skull was a significant mystery. However, with recent technological advancements, satellites detected what appears to be the creature's skull on the dark side of the Moon. While it cannot be definitively proven that this skull belongs to the skeleton that encircles the Earth, its size and proportions match perfectly, making it a plausible conclusion.

This information is highly classified. I was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement, with explicit threats of severe consequences if we leaked any information. My job, although officially recorded as underwater mapping, is actually to manipulate images to hide any trace of Jörmungandr. Every photo we capture is meticulously analyzed, and any evidence of the skeleton is digitally removed.

Incredibly, this colossal skeleton can even be seen with the naked eye from the International Space Station. The size and scope of Jörmungandr's remains are truly beyond comprehension, making the effort to hide it even more sinister.

Since I started this job, my conscience has been an unbearable burden. Hiding such a monumental secret goes against everything I believe in. The truth must be known, regardless of the consequences.

I am writing this letter as a last act of desperation. I know I could be discovered and punished, but I cannot continue living with this weight. Humanity has the right to know about Jörmungandr and what it represents.

Please share this information with as many people as possible. If something happens to me, let this letter serve as proof that the giant serpent exists and that powerful forces are trying to hide the truth.

The truth must prevail.

Sincerely,

An Anonymous Technician
