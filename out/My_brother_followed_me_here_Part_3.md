I barely slept last night as you could probably guess. Julie went to the store so I've been walking the grounds looking for any sign of him, any sign of what used to be Landon. I know this is something a big brother should never say but I want him dead I want so badly just to kill him and be done with this whole thing.

I probably look like a psycho i feel like one. I can feel my eyes twitching, I keep freaking out over every crunch of leaves. Fuck him fuck him for doing this to me I don't know what's happening and God knows I'm not in the right state of mind to figure it out. A lot of you guys have been saying he's possessed. What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? Am I supposed to help him? Kill him? I'm not even sure what i believe. I just know I want this to be over, I want to sleep I want to marry Julie I just want to move on. I'm not the most religious but me and Julie always went to church together on Sundays since her family's catholic. We've put crosses all over the house, salt in the doorways and locked everything up tight. I'm just not sure what to do anymore.

12:36 pm 
Julie just called she's headed back. I'm gonna head inside and wait for her. We're thinking about making dinner together tonight pasta or something.

Around 1 pm 
I heard a knock on the door. It wasn't Julie. It's just a box. A cardboard box about 3 feet tall and 3 feet wide. Immediately my mind raced with thoughts of what was in the box. Is it Landon? I gripped the axe tightly in my hands my knuckles white. I thought of the movie Se7en and my blood ran cold. What if it was Julie in that box. I tore the top open and as I did I projectile vomited onto the floor. I screamed falling backwards vomiting again sobbing. I screamed again choking on my own bilethe noise coming from me sounded just as horrible as that baby dear. But dear God the dear was nothing compared to what's inside that box. It was the officer, the one from the other night. He was naked the only thing covering his body was his blood. All I could see was his head and his feet but I knew that monster fit the rest of him in there. He looked terrified tears of blood ran from his deep red eyes looking as though they may pop out at the slightest touch. His feet were pressed against his face almost like a twisted rendition of the scream painting. 

I kicked the box off the porch and the body fall out of the box and into the grass as I slammed the door shut.

Julie never came home I'm in her dad's old pickup truck now driving around trying to find her. I keep calling but she won't answer. I need to find her I need to I can't lose her. He can't take her from me. 

I don't know what to do.
