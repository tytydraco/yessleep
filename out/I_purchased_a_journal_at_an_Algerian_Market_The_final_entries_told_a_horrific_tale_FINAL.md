***Thursday, 3 July, 1952***

*I write today with, what feels like for the first time in an eternity, a shred of good news. Blake has given an initial inspection of both the radio and telegraphs, and has come to the conclusion that, while it will take a small amount of time, the damage dealt to both is within her means to repair. She has told us that it will take, with a combination of supplies found within the living quarters and from our own bags, a maximum of two to three days to get them back up to snuff.*

*I can also report that during Soren and Morretti’s watch as well as, accompanied by Corrin, my own, we saw and heard no trace of…whatever lies out there. I hold no delusions that they may have left, though; all throughout the night I could feel their eyes upon the fort. Especially when I passed a window. Several times I would stop in front of them, swinging my head around and squint into the blackness. Of course I saw nothing, but. The hair that rose on my arms every single time assured me that, if the night were able to withdraw and allow the secrets it covers to be visible, I would have borne witness to a sight both blood chilling and macabre in its appearance. In the past, I often wished that God had given us the night vision that large predators were bestowed with, but now, I am beyond thankful He did not.*

*For the most part, we have remained inside the living quarters, only venturing outside for brief periods of time to fetch water from the water garden. The fear and tension felt when doing so though is palpable enough to slice with a bloody razor, especially as it sits directly next to the main wall of the fort. When it was my turn to refill our canteens, my head swiveled around on my neck not unlike an owl’s, turning this way and that and feeling that if I allowed even a second to glance away from a particular spot, I would turn to find the last thing I would ever see gazing into my eyes. Fortunately, whether due to the material the fort was built with or its position against the mountains, the interior remained relatively cool, even as the noonday sun beat down to the point I could see, both up close and in the distance the air itself shimmering from the temperature.*

*I do have to mention one thing. Ever since Tarek fled inside the building the other day, he refuses to try and help us in any way. When asked by Morretti, all he would do is shake his head and repeat the words he spoke to us the other day, the words about the ones who live in the mountains, before retreating into a supply closet. He remains there, only coming out briefly for food or water before returning to it.*

*One other important thing to note. As we had some free time on our hands, I used it to further explore the living quarters, thoroughly checking every lockbox and supply case for anything we could possibly use. In most, I have found only medical supplies and, in the upper levels of the building, two cannons, along with fuses, gunpowder and half a dozen cannonballs. However, as I further explored the upper areas, I found a metal lockbox that, after breaking the aged lock with the butt of my revolver, held two flare pistols within. Each only has a single flare, already loaded inside with no sign of additional flares nearby. I showed them to Morretti and the others, who agreed that they would be stowed away to be used if any sign of life were spotted in the desert below. “These may be what end up saving our hides” Talley said.*

*The sun is setting now, and with the descent of the orange, almost blood red sun over the horizon, it feels like whatever safety we felt in the daylight is disappearing before my very eyes.*

*I pray we make it through the night.*

***Friday, 4 July, 1952***

*The screams…*

*I find it a struggle to put to ink and paper the abject horror and shock that I feel this morning. But I must, if only to try and help preserve the fleeting sanity that almost seems to precariously cling to me. Last night, Soren and I were tasked with taking the first watch, patrolling the halls and rooms until half past one in the morning, when we would rouse and be relieved by Morretti and Corrin. Soren carried the shotgun, while I remained with my pistol. Slowly, silently we moved through the building, occasionally convening to confirm no sign of trouble and poking our heads into the bunk room to check on the others. The only sound that could be heard, aside from the whistling wind and creaking of the ancient building, was the soft ticking of the watch on my wrist, its unstoppable march seeming to bring a little comfort to me.*

*That was when I heard it.*

*At first, I couldn’t identify the sound; it was too far off in the distance and too muffled to properly make out. It barely carried on the wind, almost being whisked away completely. But as the moments spilled over into minutes, I realized that it was slowly growing louder. Which meant whatever it was…it was getting closer. Feeling my heart begin to race in my chest, I raised my revolver and pulled back the hammer, my eyes straining to see into the darkness. The sound continued to increase in volume, and for a moment I froze. For a moment, I had almost recognized it. A shiver passed through me as I gripped the windowsill tightly in one hand, the other shaking slightly as I aimed the gun into the black.*

*That was when a hand fell on my shoulder.*

*I nearly jumped out of my skin, whirling around to find Soren standing beside me, the shotgun raised toward the ceiling in his free hand and an intense look upon his face. He looked at me. “I hear it, too” he said simply, in response to my unspoken question. For another moment the two of us stood there, straining our ears as we held by the window. The sound continued to grow nearer, and I felt another shiver pass through me. I couldn’t understand why, but I almost swore I recognized the sound. Finally, I whispered back to Soren. “What is that?” He remained silent for another moment or so. Then I saw his face go slightly pale in recognition, his expression changing from stone to clearly unnerved.*

*“…Screaming”*

*There was another stretch of silence between us as we both strained our ears. I prayed for a moment that he was wrong. But as the wind fell for a moment, I felt the blood in my veins turn to ice as it came again, clear this time. It was, indeed, screaming. What’s more, the source was unmistakably human. I had heard far too many men to count scream on the battlefield during The War. Heard men shriek their last after they had stepped on a landmine and lay, blown apart and rapidly bleeding out on the ground with it too dangerous to try and retrieve them. I heard the screams of captured Germans in the bunkers as operatives went to work extracting information from them.*

*These screams not only rivaled them but surpassed them. They were the most horrible, panicked and pained sounds I had ever heard a human being utter. It sounded nothing less than as if the screamer were being flayed alive, feeling every single cut and peel of their skin. And then the terror I felt compounded as a second rose up. A second scream. One which rose and fell beside the first, occasionally overlapping it until it sounded as though we were hearing the damned souls of Hell itself crying out for release. His eyes wide, Soren turned to me and said only three words.*

*“Rouse the others”*

*Soon, we all were standing by the window, every expression a mirror of the fear on the other as we listened to the infernal sound that, now, almost sounded as if it were coming from just beyond the sealed front doors of the fort. Blake clasped a hand over her mouth, closing her eyes and leaning against me; I wrapped an arm protectively around her, pulling her close to me as I looked at the others. Corrin looked as though he were about to faint from terror. “Jesus, Mary and Joseph…” he breathed. I saw Talley swallow hard. But it was the look that swept across Morretti’s face that drew my attention. It was one of recognition. He fought to find his voice for a moment, then softly spoke, his voice almost lost to the shrieks outside.*

*“Samir…”*

*Everyone turned to look at him at the single word he uttered. I felt a small wave of confusion wash over me. Then, if possible, I saw Soren’s face go even paler than it already was. “God almighty. That is Samir. And that other scream…I remember how Richter yowled when he broke his ankle a few years ago. That’s…that’s him” Fresh waves of horror rolled over us like the sea as the information sunk in. I had been on the same expedition with the two men when Richter had broken his ankle climbing a rock. I prayed to the God I hoped was listening that they were wrong. But in my bones, I knew they weren’t. I knew we were hearing the screams of our two lost compatriots. Talley suddenly began to turn towards the stairs to the lower floor, yanking his own pistol from his holster. “We have to help them!” he yelled, beginning to sprint away. Just as quickly, Soren and Morretti began to chase after him, telling him to wait. Still holding onto Blake, I jerked my head for Corrin to follow and hurried after them.*

*When we descended the stairs, we found Soren restraining Talley, his face enraged in the flickering light of the lamp above. “Let go of me, damn you!” he yelled, attempting to kick the larger man to free himself. Morretti leaned forward towards him. “Use your brain, you stupid fool! There’s a reason why it’s coming from just outside the fort. It, they, whoever or whatever is out there wants us to go out there! It’s a trap!” Talley kicked at Soren again, but this time, it was weaker. “You don’t know that!” he protested. “They could have found their way back!” Soren shook his head. “After what Liam and the others found? No, they couldn’t. Especially not after two days. I’m sorry, Mr. Talley, but Alessandro is right. They are counting on our emotions to get the better of us. It’s designed to lure us out into the open” Talley closed his eyes and turned his head away, almost in denial of what I had realized was true myself, but I could see the words sinking in.*

*He slowly slumped, Soren releasing the man and allowing him to crumple to the ground, pulling his knees towards him and wrapping his arms around them. Standing in the narrow hall, we all listened to the screaming of our two friends continue outside for a few minutes. Then, as it began to feel as though the sounds would drive us all mad, they slowly began to move away. The screaming grew fainter, the sound of the wind beginning to mask it again. Until finally, we couldn’t hear it at all. For a time, nobody moved. I glanced at my watch, seeing that it was quarter to three in the morning. I hadn’t realized how long the terrifying ordeal had really lasted.*

*Finally, Talley stood up. He refused to meet any of our eyes, and slunk back upstairs. Corrin followed close behind him. I felt a sense of worry at what I saw in the second man’s eyes; the look was akin to one a cornered animal wears, and revealed that he was close to the edge. Soon, all of us had returned to the upper levels, Morretti relieving me of my watch and ordering me to try and rest.*

*But sleep is the last thing I feel I could obtain right now. Not when the horror of what we’ve experienced is still so fresh in my mind. Blake has somehow managed to drift back off, though I can tell her dreams are nightmares by how she moans and wriggles on her cot. So I write, not knowing what else to do. I pray for the rising sun to come soon and banish away the small taste of Hell that I witnessed tonight.*

*One last thing. I only noticed once we returned from upstairs, but not once during the entire ordeal did Tarek join us. I only saw him when we returned upstairs, peeking out from the closet to stare at us with wide eyes. The look on his face is one I remember well from the medical tents, on the faces of wounded soldiers who knew they were about to die.*

*It was the look of a man who has resigned himself to his fate.*

***Saturday, 5 July, 1952***

*Whatever lives in these godforsaken mountains, it will not allow us to make a call for help.*

*Blake finished repairing both the radio and telegraph today. For a few moments, we clung to a tiny scrap of relief, like a shipwreck victim to a life ring. We crowded around her as she began to send a distress call, tuning to the proper frequency.*

*Something answered us…but not what we hoped. Almost as soon as she released the transmit button, a sound spilled from the speakers. At first, it was too soft to make out, but soon grew in intensity until we could clearly recognize it. Whispering. Voices, dozens of them or more, all whispering in a language none of us could ascertain or understand. It was not Arabic; I doubt it’s a language any human has spoken in millenia, if ever at all. The sound made chill after chill shoot up my spine. I could see horrified looks in the other’s faces. The whispering continued, soon joined by screaming. And I swear, I heard Samir and Richter’s screams among the others. The same screams we heard the other night. Finally, the radio just seemed to die completely, the glowing dial dimming to black. No matter how much Blake fiddled with it, she couldn’t get it to turn on again.*

*And no sooner had she turned to the telegraph, using Morse code to type out an SOS then we received an answer, far quicker than anyone could possibly respond. I remember the look of confusion on her face as she reached out and pulled the small piece of paper from the machine, raising it to her eyes and reading it. When she lowered it, she looked to be on the verge of tears. “What does it say?” Morretti asked her gently. She took a moment before answering, swallowing hard.*

*“No saving”*

*I find myself terrified now. Not just for my life. But my very soul.*

***Sunday, 6 July, 1952***

*Soren is gone.*

*I was roused shortly before dawn by Morretti, who gazed down at me with an expression which shocked me. Throughout the entire ordeal, the man had attempted to remain calm; now, as he pulled me to my feet, I found myself staring at an almost panicked face. Trying to keep his voice level, he explained that when he had not seen Soren crossing his path after doing so thrice before, he had gone looking for the man. He discovered the shotgun leaning against the wall near one of the cannons, with no sign of him at all. What’s worse was there was not a single sign of a struggle. It was as if he’d been ambushed and simply lifted up and out of the world with nary a splash of blood or scream.*

*He handed me the shotgun, asking him to help secure the building with him. Quickly, and with the worried eyes of the others turning on us as they awoke, we swept through the living quarters, our guns at the ready and eyes darting around. To my dismay, we discovered that the door to the courtyard was still bolted from the inside, indicating that Soren hadn’t walked outside. Which meant whatever had happened to him, had happened in here. Every shadow cast by the flickering candles and lamps now seemed threatening, whatever safety we felt inside torn away like a favorite blanket from a child. I want to say my eyes were playing tricks on me, but I fear that, as I moved through the living quarters, my eyes occasionally would spy something moving swiftly and silently among the rafters over our heads, only stopping for a moment to watch us before darting out of sight.*

*Once dawn broke, and despite the door being locked, we left the living quarters and moved out into the courtyard. We still found no trace of the man, and the front doors were still barricaded. We made a quick pass through the armory, still finding nothing, before quickly stopping to refill our canteens. While water is obviously not an issue, we will soon begin running low on food.*

*But I fear it is not starvation that will be the end of us.*

***Saturday, 6 July, 1952, Addendum***

*The screaming is back. It came just after nightfall. It is still Samir and Richter’s screams, sounding almost exactly as before. Only now…I hear Soren’s deep, guttural cries among them.*

*God…God, I don’t want to die here. I don’t want my fate to be whatever theirs now are.*

***Sunday, 7 July, 1952***

*Tarek is dead.*

*At first, when we awoke, nothing new seemed out of place. The same creaking of the building could be heard, but nothing more screamed of the change. Until I went to try and bring the Algerian some water and food. I found the door to the supply closet standing wide open, and when I peered inside, it was empty. Feeling tension suddenly erupt from my body, I turned and began calling for the man, attracting the attention of Morretti and Talley, who were on their patrols. Once I showed them the empty closet, the three of us fanned out, all calling the man’s name, and Morretti calling out what had to be soothing words in Arabic. But there was no response at all, aside from the confused calls of Corrin and Blake as they awoke and joined us.*

*That was when I saw the open front door.*

*The sight of the living quarter’s door hanging wide open, gently waving in the breeze and showing the sand outside, the sun just beginning to spread across it filled me with a sense of dread. Quickly I called the others, and after a quick discussion, Morretti and I moved outside, while Talley closed and bolted the door behind us. We instantly spotted a set of footprints in the sand, moving away from the building out into the center of the courtyard. We followed them, seeing that they’d stopped near the steps to the armory, as if the man had contemplated running to it, before turning and heading towards the front doors of the fort itself. Even from here, I could see the board had been pulled down; it now lay haphazardly on the ground, and one of the great wooden doors had been pulled slightly open. Gripping the shotgun tightly, the two of us moved and looked outside. Nothing moved in the stillness, and besides the wind, no sound could be heard. I looked to him, and he gave a short nod before stepping outside.*

*Instantly, I felt far more vulnerable without the buildings around me. Just as when I had gone looking for Samir and Richter, my hands turned cold and clammy, and I nervously eyed the still shadowy areas around us. Every sense was on alert. We followed the man’s footprints as they continued forward, and with a sinking feeling, I realized that they were heading for the edge of the cliff. Morretti seemed to have realized it as well, and I saw him tentatively take a few steps forward, putting one hand on the rickety wooden railing and peering over the side. For a moment he said nothing. Then he closed his eyes.*

*“…Fucking Hell”*

*Quickly I hurried to his side and looked over. A small sense of vertigo overwhelmed me, and I felt dizzy looking down the straight drop. But I instantly spied what the other man had seen. Tarek’s body lay far below us, his arms and legs splayed out in various directions. Bright, crimson blood splashed out around his body; even from here, I could tell he had not landed on the sand, but had instead slammed into one of the boulders at the base of the cliff. The man had jumped, knowingly taking his own life. I whispered a silent prayer for the man, hoping that God would have mercy on him for such a terrible sin. Then I looked at Morretti. All he could do was shake his head. As we stood there, attempting to process it all, a noise behind us caused us to turn around.*

*The pitter-patter of sand and small, loose rocks being shifted aside.*

*Instantly, all thought of Tarek vanished as the sensation of eyes on us returned with a vengeance. Terror began coursing through my system, and we aimed at just about everywhere possible. Nothing moved now, but I knew he could feel us be observed. Being stalked. Without delay, the two of us ran for the fort, rushing inside and pushing the door closed before again setting the barricade. Just as quickly, we moved to the door to the living quarters, banging on it and yelling to be let inside. To our relief, the door unbolted, revealing the ashen face of Blake as she yanked the door open. We hurried inside as she closed and redid the lock.*

*Before we could tell her what she found, she pointed back towards the hallway to the stairs. “You need to see this” she said, before leading the way back towards the main bunk room. Moments later, we found ourselves at the supply closet that Tarek had hidden in, the others crowded around it. And I noticed something I hadn’t before. In my haste to locate the man, I hadn’t noticed that, using a small, sealed can of black paint and a brush which had been left inside, he had written something hastily on the wall in Arabic. Talley turned to Morretti, asking him if he could read it. He stood in silence for a time, either unable or unwilling to answer. Then he turned towards us, his face grim.*

*“Roughly translated, it says that death is better than what fate awaits those who are taken”*

*It is dark now. Night has fallen again, though mercifully, the screaming has not returned. All I can think as I sit here writing is that whatever lies out there…whatever watches us from the shadows in here, up in the rafters that I now know isn’t a trick of my eyes, it is slowly toying with us and picking us off one by one. They have taken our strongest members first, a strategic move that reveals their intelligence, and drove possibly the only person in our party with any knowledge about them to the point he chose to take his own life rather than face them.*

*Whatever they are…they will not stop until we all are dead.*

***Monday, 8 July, 1952***

*I saw them.*

*Dear, sweet, merciful God, I wish I hadn’t. I wish I hadn’t decided to take a torch with me when I was roused by Talley to take the second watch with Corrin. I wish I’d ignored the urge I’d had to turn and look out the window. I wish so much.*

*But if wishes were horses…*

*It happened just a little before four in the morning. I’d just finished speaking briefly with Corrin; ever since yesterday, I’d grown more concerned for the medic. The man looks nearer and nearer to insanity, and I fear with a loaded pistol, he may do something brash or violent if he snaps. But he assured me that he was still as sane as he could possibly be in such a situation, and feeling somewhat relieved, I moved off to patrol the outer hallways again. As I passed a window which looked out over the courtyard, the ceaseless sensation of being watched suddenly spiked. I felt the biggest shiver yet shoot up my spine, and I reached down for my belt. I’d chosen to take a torch with me to light up any dark corners; after now feeling sure we were not alone in here anymore, I wanted a way to light up any dark corners. I flicked it on, turning and aiming it out the window into the dark towards the armory.*

*And saw it.*

*It crouched, almost feline-like on the roof of the armory, arms and legs wrapped around a section of stone for support. As my light fell upon it, it looked towards me before quickly leaping out of sight. But not before I had time to see the details. The sunken eyes, sunken so far back that it almost looked as if it had none. The recessed nose, almost entirely erased from its face. The mouth, filled with jagged, razor-sharp teeth that could easily tear a man apart. All of this filled me with an existential horror I only ever felt when hearing about Hell during church sermons. But it was the one additional detail that slammed into me like a freight train.*

*The torn, tattered and decaying uniform that hung off its emaciated body.*

*It was a uniform I instantly recognized. I had seen an identical, albeit much more intact one on the corpse of the man in the armory jail. The uniform worn by soldiers in the French Foreign Legion during the First World War, and into the 1930s. As my mind scrambled to process the information, another shape darted in view of my torch beam. And this one nearly caused me to scream. Because it wore a different, much fresher uniform.*

*The same one that Richter had worn when he’d set off with Samir that day.*

*It is midday now as I write this. I have not told anybody what I have seen. I know I must, and yet…I cannot. I cannot bear to share the horrible truth that I now know. What Tarek almost certainly knew, and what made him choose death by his own hand over it. Even though I now know that none of us will leave this mountain alive, I feel that it would be too cruel for them to know.*

*Those things out there…they may have been hidden in this mountain for Lord only knows how long. When the fort was first built centuries ago, they may have watched as it was constructed. But the most horrible part about them, was that when they came for them, the same as they came for the French soldiers stationed here decades ago, as well as the rescue party, is that they did not kill them. They did not devour them; as horrific a fate as that might have been, it would have been a mercy in comparison.*

*They dragged them off. And they…changed them. They somehow turned them into more of their own.*

*And they have done the same to those of our team who they took. Samir, Richter, and Soren. That’s why the screams we heard always came back. Because even though they’re not the same men anymore; they’re not even human anymore, their souls have long been stripped away, leaving what I can only describe as demons spewing from the mouth of Hell itself to wear their bodies, they still retain enough of their intelligence to know how to lure others to them. Like a duck hunter with a call to imitate their own kind.*

*Talley says he wants to try and use one of the flare pistols to signal anyone who might be nearby. I haven’t the heart to tell him that even if anyone human is nearby, they know better than to approach this place. They know it is cursed.*

*It is only a matter of time before they come for the rest of us. God have mercy on all of our souls.*

***Tuesday, 9 July, 1952***

*These will be the final words I will ever write. The others are all gone, and I am the only one who remains. Night is coming fast, and if I do not act quickly, I know they will return for me as well. So even if no one ever finds this journal of mine, I feel I must put to paper how it ended. If nothing more than to serve a warning for anyone who hears the tale of this accursed place, and finds themselves one part brave, two-parts fool to try and reach it.*

*What awoke us was not the hell spawn that lay in wait for us. It was the sound of arguing, of babbling screams. And finally, the sound of a weapon of some sort being discharged. I remember the look on Blake’s face as she awoke, looking at me with wide, doe-like eyes. I snatched up the shotgun from beside me, seeing Moretti pulling his pistol from his waistband as he shot to his feet. In unison, we sprinted for the hallway outside the bunk room.*

*When we opened it, it was to a truly grisly sight.*

*Talley lay on his back on the floor. A shocked look was permanently affixed to his face, his wide eyes glassy and forever staring at the ceiling. The sparks from the flare that had been shot into his mouth still spewed from inside, the horrific smell of burning flesh filling the hallway. Standing in front of him, still pointing the flare gun, was Corrin. When he turned towards us, I instantly knew the man had snapped. An insane grin was plastered on his face, and his eyes flew about in their sockets. Instantly, Moretti and I raised our weapons, but before anything could be done, Corrin had shoved past us and raced down the stairs. We heard him unbolt the front door, and running to the windows, saw him sprint across the courtyard to the armory, disappearing down the stairs. A moment later, we heard the faint sound of the door slamming shut.*

*Nobody could speak. When I turned back, it was to find Blake standing over the body of our sponsor, unable to stop crying. Quickly I raced to her and embraced her, allowing her tears to soak my shirt. After a few minutes, her crying had reduced to sniffles, and she pulled back, wiping her nose with her shirtsleeve. I looked to Morretti. The man looked beside himself with shock and confusion. He hadn’t realized how close to the edge his medic had been. Then he regained his composure, looking towards me with a steely edge in his eyes. When he spoke, his voice was deadly calm.*

*“We have to go after him”*

*I was unsure as to why, after murdering our sponsor, the man wanted to pursue him. Whether for a twisted sort of retribution, or a sense of duty to those under his leadership, even in such extreme cases I will never know, but I didn’t dare argue with him. I knelt down, gently prying the pistol from Talley’s hand and trying not to look at his face. Standing up, I handed it to her. “Can you fire a gun?” She looked at me and nodded after a moment. Nodding in return, I quickly retreated to the bunk room, picking up the pack which still held the shotgun shells and slinging it over my shoulder. Returning, I nodded at the others, and together, we headed downstairs and out the front door.*

*The wind howled as fiercely as a banshee as we made our way across the courtyard, all three of our guns shifting around aim. I remembered what I had seen the night before, and felt my muscles tense, gaze shifting to the tops of the ridges high above the fort. I felt sure I would see the demons climbing quickly down towards us. Thankfully, I saw nothing. Reaching the steps, we descended to the front door of the armory and found it unlocked. Stepping inside the gloomy interior, we moved slowly, occasionally calling out Corrin’s name. Not a soul answered, and for a moment, I wondered if the man had been taken as well when his back was turned. After all, we had barely explored the building, choosing to huddle inside the living quarters.*

*As we rounded a corner, though, I saw signs that he was still here. Barrels of gunpowder lay on their sides, the black grains spilling out onto the floor. A workbench had its tools scattered about. That was when I noticed the hole in the floor, one I hadn’t seen previously. I would have ignored it completely if it hadn’t been for the sparkle that came from something lying next to it. As we approached, I realized it was a diamond, one of the largest I’d ever seen in my life. And when I peered into the hole, I couldn’t help but feel my mouth drop open as I saw precious gems and gold coins that filled the entire hole, piled into what I could tell was a hidden room below.*

*The treasure had been real.*

*Even in our predicament, the three of us couldn’t help but look at each other and laugh softly. “Well, at least we know that the stories of the treasure was true. Talley was right” Blake said softly. For another moment we stared. Then we slowly tore ourselves away from the treasure, moving on and calling out Corrin’s name. Still, nobody answered, and I began to feel that we should simply leave the building. As much as I could understand to a degree Morretti’s reasoning, this was being dangerously foolhardy. But I never had a chance to voice my thoughts.*

*As we rounded the final corner to the jail, a shot rang out, the bullet striking the wall not a foot from Morretti’s face. The three of us leapt back, pressing up against the wall for cover. Another shot rang out, and then, for a moment an eerie silence fell over the hall. Then I heard Corrin scream, the insanity audible in his voice. “Stay away! I found the treasure; it’s mine! Mine, not yours!” Morretti chanced a look around the corner, snapping his head back as a third shot rang out. “He’s managed to get the keys from the dead man in the cell and locked himself in” he told us, “And he’s got some of the treasure scattered around him” He looked at us, and I already knew what he would say before he opened his mouth.*

*“Fuck him, we have to go”*

*Quickly, the three of us backtracked through the armory to the front door. We slipped outside and began to run across towards the living quarters.*

*They were waiting for us.*

*We had barely made it halfway across the courtyard when what I can only describe as a blur of motion flew down from the window of the living quarters. I saw Moretti look up at the shape rocketing towards him, screaming, saw him raise his pistol to fire. He never even had a chance to let off a single shot. The creature slammed into him, knocking him to the ground and sending the revolver tumbling from his fingers. The beast looked at me, and with a horrified realization, I recognized the blue eyes set deep in the already recessed sockets. Then, gripping Morretti’s shoulder with one of its clawed hands, it leapt off the ground, pulling the screaming man with him as it rapidly climbed the rock and out of sight.*

*We had no time to grieve or process any of it. Because the rest came for us.*

*Everything blurred together in those moments, much as it does in war when adrenaline and reflex take over. I cannot remember anything clearly, only faintly recall the sounds of deafening gunshots as we fired at all we could see, the motion of reaching into the pack for extra ammunition for Blake and myself, the sounds of the two of us shouting and screaming, and the pained, enraged cries of the creatures as our shells and rounds slammed home. I was dimly aware that we were moving towards the water garden.*

*The next thing I can recall, is the silence.*

*I found Blake and I slumped against the wall near the fountain. She had pulled me close to her, and she had cupped some water in her hands, using it to sprinkle over my brow and drip into my mouth. The refreshing, blessed liquid brought me back fully, and when I asked what had happened, she told me after a time, they had all retreated. None had died, even after all we’d fired at them, but they still retreated. As I looked around, wondering for a moment if we’d succeeded in frightening them off, my eyes fell on a sight which wrenched whatever hope I had left from my soul.*

*The sun was beginning to set in the sky.*

*I instantly knew that the only reason they had retreated, was to wait until darkness fell again. It had been a strategic move. They would wait until the night blinded us, when they could still see perfectly. And then they would come again. Either to kill us, or…drag us off like the others. Like I’d seen the beast Soren had become do to Moretti. To make us like them. In those moments, any remaining thoughts of surviving fled from me. I said nothing, however. I climbed to my feet, looking around. Then I looked down at Blake. She gave me a strained smile; even still, it made her look beautiful. I smiled back at her. Finally, she sighed and pushed her mousy hair behind her ear, before looking up at me.*

*“What do we do now?” I didn’t answer her. Instead, I simply shook my head to indicate I didn’t know. I waited until she had lowered her head and closed her eyes. Then, before she could open them again, I swung the barrel of the shotgun and aimed.*

*I find a sort of peace that she never knew what was about to happen.*

*And now, now that I am done writing my account of this all, I have but one thing left to do. I refused to let the demons change Blake into one of their own. As much as I know my soul is damned to Hell for the unforgivable sin I have committed against her, it was a mercy. And it is the same mercy I will give myself.*

*I am going to follow the same path that Tarek took. I will jump from the cliff. I will face my own death at the hands of the rocks below, rather than the fate that has befallen the others. That is, beyond all shadow of a doubt, a fate worse than any death imaginable. I pray for my own soul. I pray for Blake’s. I pray for Talley’s. I even pray for Corrin’s; I hope that, like the soldier before him, it is thirst or hunger that takes him.*

*Please. Heed the dire warning this journal contains. While there is treasure above you, do not attempt to climb and retrieve it. You will not live to spend a single bloody shilling of it. The beasts above have claimed it, and the fort for their own. Let it be, if you value not only your life, but your humanity and very soul. For if you don’t, you will find yourself facing a fate that is more horrific than written about in any tomb.*

*And please…if you find this, get word back to my sister in Maidenhead. Tell her I’m sorry.*

*God forgive me…*
