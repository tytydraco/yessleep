Sooner or later, she shows herself to me.  
I know she never left, always hidden in the back of my head, watching, whispering, waiting for an opportunity, a moment of weakness, a moment in which I find myself alone and hurt, a window to talk to me once againâ€¦  
  
With barely a sound she appears to me. Beautiful as always. The tall figure of a stunningly alluring woman, behind a blanket of fog. As she gets closer, her features are revealed with each frightful step.  
  
From under her long dress sleeves, I can see hands, as white as snow, and seemingly just as soft too. These always come first, her hands slowly undressing out of the thick fog.  
  
Next is her dress, as black as night, covering her body fully, just the right fit, but still delineating the form of a voluptuous body. Just like a sculpture from the ancient Greek masters, she inspires both awe and desire. I steel myself, for what is to come next.  
  
From the black veil that composes her dress, long locks of ashen white hair fall over her shoulders, and down to her chest. Some of them braided, and some of them left natural, but none of them shine, dull as ash, giving off an illusion as if they mixed and flowed with the fog.  
  
And finally, her facial features are revealed. She emerges with closed eyes, black eye- lashes contrasting against her white skin, a small nose, and below that, lips that sport the only vibrant color she possesses, red. Not only that, but bright red, seemingly wet, like freshly harvested snow berries, or spilled blood.  
  
As she takes her final steps towards me, her eyes open. The moment I always dread, because no matter my resolve, it always breaks me down into tears. Her eyes shine with tears too, welling down her ever-stained cheeks, as if she cried for eternity. Irises sporting a faint mauve hue, but most importantly, radiating a sea of sorrow and sadness, but with overwhelming care and a promise of comfort too.  
  
She approaches me slowly, looking down, hands clasped in front of her, letting tears roll down her cheeks and plink on the ground. I take a step back, hesitant, and then another. A feeling of revulsion washes over me.  
  
But when she looks up at me, deep into my eyes again, that feeling flows away. She doesn't want to harm anyone, only to bring comfort, peace.  
  
With slow steps, she sits down on my bed, next to where I stand. It is not always like that. Sometimes she expects me to approach, others she moves and hugs me with haste, or lies down by my side on cold nights with a embrace and soft whispers to my ears.  
  
But not this time. I feel something different. My legs feel like jelly one moment and lead the next, walking is impossible, and with a grunt, I fall to my knees in front of her.   
  
Her hands reach over, tenderly holding my chin and caressing my cheeks with the tip of her fingers. It works almost as a spell, coaxing me closer to her.  
  
It works, I move inch by inch until I'm next to her, she lifts my head so that I can look in her eyes. Her gaze feels like a hurricane of broken glass, and the caress of a thousand flower petals. Warm like the embrace of a soul-mate, and cold like the grave. Impossible to stand for long, but coaxing me ever closer to her lips.  
  
That's all she ever wants, her final objective in her visits, everytime. Sometimes with soothing words and promises. Or empathic looks and tender caresses.   
  
She promises me that the pain would go away, that I wouldn't have to feel sorrow ever again. Her voice is sharp as steel and soft as cotton, heavy like lead and light as feathers. She caresses my cheeks and lightly brushes the tip of her fingers on my lips.  
  
Always so tender, so caring, only wanting to get rid of my pain. My resolve waivers further, and our lips approach one another. I need to resist, I need to stop this, I need to send her away! Damn her beauty, her promises and her tears!  
  
As I think that, a sad smile touches her lips, and she promises not to force me. It is my decision alone to take her hand and accept her offer. Her hands move to the back of my head and pull me into her chest. Not in a vulgar manner, intent only as a soothing gesture.  
  
And as darkness envelops me, I'm swallowed by emotions. Her warm body feels like the most relaxing bath in the world, and I can smell a mix of old ash and fragrant flowers  from her. All is well and perfect here, it feels like a dive into the kindness of her soul.  
  
However when I try to pull away, to distance myself from her grasp, pain and sorrow of all kinds flare up at once, driving me to abandon these thoughts, and just give up, to not even dream about letting go of her bliss, and I feel her arms tightening around me.  
  
Hours go by like that, existing in that space one loses itself. What time is it? Is it night or day? Cold or warm? Wet or dry? I'm I alive or dead? Is there anyone who cares? I don't care.  
  
It is peaceful here ,it is calm here, it is quiet here, and above all, it does not hurt here. A comfortable numbness that envelops my whole body. My skin slightly prickling. Slow breaths, ones where exhaling and inhaling take an eternity to pass. My once teary face now a mask of peace,The discomfort of a beating heart gone, now resting still like her own.   
  
But slowly, she pulls me away from her. Everything floods back. I'm alive, and I feel again. I'm angry, frustrated, sad, and filled with pain once again. From the delicious cozy blanket of her soul, back into the despair of reality once again.  
  
She takes her hand to my cheeks, and pulls my eyes to her gaze. She has an expression of compassion and pain now, stained by her ever flowing tears. The compassion she feels for me is overwhelming, she offers me a way out of this, a place in her still heart, enveloped by her heavenly soul.  
  
All of that can be mine, if only I give her a kiss. A single kiss is all it takes, and she knows that I crave it more than anything else.   
  
I close my eyes. Approaching ever so slightly every minute, and this goes on for some time, the distance between us closer and closer. Strangely enough, I want to feel every single moment of this. If I want to experience this moment in a painfully slow manner, and she indulges me in this. True to her word, she would never force me, for this is my decision.  
  
Eventually, the distance between our lips is almost non-existent. I can feel her warmth, and our breaths swirl invisibly in the narrow gap between us. Longing and yearning seeping from my soul, patience and love from hers.  
  
I imagine the moments of our kiss. The feeling of her wet cheeks on mine, her tears running down and mixing with my own. All I want is to have her soft lips pressing on mine, the sweetness of her mouth, the tenderness of her arms around me, to just let everything and everyone go, in an impulsive act of love for her and complete disregard for life.  
  
In those moments, I can almost taste how it would feel. Like the bitter taste of poison? The bland taste of capsules? Sweet pills washed down by running water? The feeling of iron ripping at flesh? The smell of gunpowder in the air? The strangling hold of a rope? Vital essence slowly bleeding from my veins? The burning of lungs out of air?  
  
And just as fragile as life is, so are these moments. Messages prompting a vibration from my phone, sunshine seeping through my curtains at dawn or more often than not, the memories of others that promise me that I would be missed dispel the moment in a second. Opening my eyes, I see that she is gone, the only evidence of her presence a faint ashen scent and the warm tears on my cheeks.  
  
And I curse myself, I should have been faster, seized the moment, for I still remember the peace only her could give me. Maybe this is a blessing in disguise, maybe at the last moment I would regret sharing a kiss with her.  
  
But one thing is for sure. She will return. Once she told me they called her Lady Suicaedere, and that all she wants to give me is a kiss of peace, a kiss of death.
