Have you ever thought about being immortal?
Have you ever wished for eternity?

If so, do yourself a favor: never wish for that again.
Just want a normal life — the complete cycle: being born, growing up, getting old and, blessed be the word, dying.

Cursed was the time when I stopped accepting the only decent truth of existence: the end.

It all started in nineteen thirty-seven.
At that time, I only wanted one thing: more time.
More time to make money, build my empire, achieve the success I believed I deserved.
Time was my enemy.
And, like every arrogant man, I wanted to beat him.

One night, in a smoky and noisy bar, a well-dressed man approached me.
He had a kind face, but an enigmatic look — he didn't seem like the type of person who frequented that type of place.

— What do you want most in life? — he asked suddenly.

I smiled, surprised by the question.
— Live forever — I replied, laughing, pretending it was just a joke.

He raised an eyebrow and, in a calm tone, simply said:
—Are you sure about this?

—Without a shadow of a doubt.

The man smiled sideways, as if he knew something that the other didn't know.
And then, in a low voice, he murmured:
— May your wish come true.

He turned and disappeared around the corner.
I thought it was some kind of crazy thing — maybe a drunk, maybe a lunatic.
But I was mistaken.
Very mistaken.

In the following days, I forgot about the episode.
But time passed... and I didn't change.
No wrinkles, no signs of aging.
It was as if my body had frozen at thirty-four.

I got married, had children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.
For decades, I kept the secret.
Until one day I told my wife about that mysterious man at the bar.
I told her that somehow I had been blessed with immortality.

But the first blow came.
Just before we celebrated fifty-three years of marriage, she died.
There are no words to describe the pain of burying the love of your life — of continuing to breathe when all you want to do is stop.

Thirty-two years later, it was my first child's turn.
A father should not see his son in a coffin.
I lived desolate, dragging centuries of memories that never erased.

Still, I continued.
I changed my name countless times.
I achieved the success I was looking for.
I was the richest man in the world for several generations.
I visited all the countries, learned dozens of languages, tasted all the pleasures.
But what was once fascination... turned into boredom.
An endless boredom.

The world turned, changed, died and was reborn — and I continued.
I saw wars, empires, pandemics, the entire planet change its face.
And then, in the year three thousand one hundred and fifty-four... the end came.

An asteroid, the size of Nevada, collided with Earth.
I thought: finally, my rest.
But death... didn't come.
She never comes.

I'm immortal, but that doesn't stop me from feeling pain.
I've died countless times — in a plane crash, in a burning car, with a bullet going through my skull.
I felt every agony.
And slowly, my body always regenerated.
At first it took days... then minutes.
Until death stopped being a pause — it became just an interval between torments.

When the asteroid hit Earth, the planet exploded in less than fifteen minutes.
My body was launched into space, shattered, amidst debris and darkness.
I felt every bone break, every cell scream.
And yet... I stayed alive.

I floated through the void for centuries.
The cold of space burned like fire.
I felt hungry, thirsty, short of breath... and a loneliness that devoured my mind.

I always imagined that the end of the world would also be the end of me.
But I was doomed.
I remembered an old story: that of an immortal man who could only die if a snail touched him.
When, after eons of wandering the cosmos, he finally finds the snail...
touch it —
and the snail dies.
And the man realizes, too late, that he will never be able to rest.

I was that man.

Over time, I was being pulled by the Sun.
The heat melted my skin... and it was reborn.
It melted... and was reborn.
An endless cycle.

I ended up diving into that flaming ball.
Five thousand degrees on the surface.
The pressure crushed every atom of my being.
I burned and rose again... burned and rose again... for ages.
I thought I would go crazy — and I wanted it with all my might.
But not even madness was granted to me.

I carry with me every memory, every face, every scream I heard in centuries of existence.
I thought about everything I wasted.
I had all the time in the world... and I used it seeking money and power.
So many lives, so many loves that I let slip away.
I had all the time to be someone better — and even then, it wasn't enough.

Billions of years have passed.
The Sun expanded, became a supernova.
And I, accustomed to the impossible, resisted.
I saw the universe burn, collapse, disappear.
And then, once again, I floated in the void.

There, in the absolute silence of the cosmos... I saw something.
A figure.
Floating.
Smiling.

The same man from the bar.
The same sideways smile.
He didn't say a word.
He just looked at me, mocking me.

I tried to scream, but in a vacuum the sound doesn't travel.
I tried to express the pain of those who had the privilege of death taken away...
but I realized that it was not taken from me.
I delivered it myself.

The Bible talks about eternal life—one with God, in paradise, where there is no hunger, no thirst, no pain.
And he also talks about the other type of eternity — one in which sadness and suffering never cease.

And everything leads me to believe that... this is my private hell.
