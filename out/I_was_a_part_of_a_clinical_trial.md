"Mom! They accepted me to test out that new procedure."

"Oh, that's great news!"

"I wonder if it can really fix me."

"I don't trust it."

"Yeah, it's weird. The clinic has already done private trials. One guy regrew two fingers and another woman said her eyesight came back sharper."

"It's like we're becoming lizard people." She grimaces.

"They didn't even use lizard DNA for the process to work. That is, if they're telling the truth."

"That doesn't mean it wasn't inspired by lizards."

"Other animals have the same properties they do." I laugh.

"Still, it makes me uncomfortable."

"I'm excited."

I arrive at the hospital, and a nurse instructs me to follow her through a long, low-ceilinged hallway.

It's very different from the rest of the tall, colorful hospital.

The silence of the hall feels heavy, oppressive, and unnatural.

The bright fluorescent lights don't hum, even though they're close by.

They do, however, flicker, like a person blinking, but only when I pass.

I'm led into, not an exam room, but a place that has a comfortable chair next to an I.V. bag hanging on a stand.

The fluid inside flickers like the hallway lights. It's a strange color that I can almost remember. When I blink, the color ripples.

The nurse, who hasn't talked, gestures for me to take a seat.

I sit and gasp.

The chair is there, but I can't feel it.

The nurse smiles and rubs my shoulder.

I think she's trying to comfort me.

I gasp again as she secures the I.V. to where my arm should be.

Beyond the stub, floating in the air.

I stare with my mouth hanging open and swallow.

The fluid begins to drip as a strange tickling sensation flows into my 'arm.'

I gag as my head swirls and floats above me.

It's not painful, but it doesn't make sense.

The fluid creates veins in the air, connecting to my stub.

Once connected, I scream.

"Why does it feel like that?" I sob.

Light pulses from my new appendage.

With each pulse, my vision brightens with the sound of color.

I recognize the rhythm but can't place it.

The 'veins' pierce my stub with a pang of dullness.

I could feel them web within my body.

My arm feels sore, like I've been working out.

Every movement aches.

I attempt to grab my new arm and feel my fingers glide between the veins.

There's something there. Something I can only see if I blink.

I groan as I pull my fingers out, not in pain, but in weirdness.

The nurse finally speaks, "It's trying to remember how to be an arm."

"What does that mean?"

She doesn't answer but pulls out a syringe and inserts it into the I.V. line.

The stuff inside the syringe pulls in the light from around us, making it darker than shadow.

I tried to run.

I can't leave the chair.

I struggle and sob as she pushes the contents of the syringe into me.

The world around me shatters. Sounds break and crumble in my ears.

Colors explode and implode in quick succession.

Nausea overwhelms my senses, and I feel like I'm going to throw up out of my arm.

I can taste the veins, which sends shivers down my spine.

My head erupts with waves of needles, each one coursing through my hair.

A pain so exquisite that I crumple in exhaustion.

I'm lucid but unable to move.

I breathe heavily into the chair while pulses of electricity jolt me periodically.

Cold sweat pours down my back as I writhe.

Her voice grates in my ears, "Your arm is adapting very quickly." She says, matter-of-factly. "Much quicker than expected."

I scream as red and white protrude from my stub, slowly splitting open my scars like a broken seam.

The bones crystallize unevenly as my veins grind them down like sandpaper.

Time doesn't work anymore as my body rewrites what an arm should be from non-existence.

The structures bore outward, unraveling glacially as my eyes roll back in agony.

The growth extends to my wrist as fingers drill outward, causing me to cry out until my fingers are formed.

Silence.

I lay still as the nurse sings to herself.

She pulls out yet another syringe.

"This is your own blood." She says as she injects it into the I.V. line.

My arm lifts me off of the chair, holding me midair as a red light emits from my new bones.

I don't care anymore as I dangle lifelessly from my arm.

"It's remembering how gravity works. It'll take a minute."

My vision fades as flits of rainbow dash across my vision. Non-cohesive and in spurts.

I wake up to her pushing another syringe into the line.

This one is hard to look at, and when I look away, it's not there anymore.

My arm rests on the chair again.

I swallow and brace for the next experience.

I stare at my new skin, unable to comprehend how it got there.

It's roughly the same shade as my other skin, but it looks wrong. It feels synthetic, although it looks exactly the same as my other arm, just reversed.

"It will feel like that for a long time. I'm uncertain for how long; it's different for everyone."

I shake my head.

"We're all done, here," She says. "Recovery time takes about a year. Do not do anything with it until it's finished remembering how to be an arm."

She shuffles some papers.

"There will be residual phantom pain, which will fade eventually. So until then, no strenuous activity."

I wake up in bed with my mother crying next to me, "You're back."

Her arm is completely gone from her body. The same one that I had just regrown.

"They said only one of us would remember," she sniffs. "Seems like they lied."
