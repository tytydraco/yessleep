I was always fond of older media. Having been born in the late 90s and having a brother who was almost a whole decade older than me made me nostalgic for gadgets that I did not grow up with. I fondly remember the nights I would watch my brother play his PlayStation on his old CRTV, the way the screen would flicker with static as the whole picture glitched along with it. The darkness that enveloped us both with the glow of the television, the sole light to break through it like a beam. I’d often look at him when the games he played were too scary for me (Silent Hill was always his favorite series) and I even remembered the way the tv display reflected off of his glasses. Warped and warbled enough for me to be immersed while still safe in the confines of my brother’s room.

It was always a fond memory of mine, thinking back to those moments. But, it’s important to know my love for this kind of media for context as to the situation I found myself in. 

It all began this past Tuesday. I had off that day from work and I was bored out of my mind. There was only so much sleep, tv shows, and a pen could do to stave away the monotony that was laziness. The sun shone hard that day and it basked my room in morning brilliance despite it being the middle of winter. I remember the glare from my window aggravated me to the point I had to get up and do \*something\*. Whether it was the seasonal depression that came with winter or the depression that was nothingness, it didn’t matter either way as whichever spurred me to move from my stupor. Through the haze that was Cherry Kush, I quickly made the bed, grabbed my car keys, and practically ran out the door of my apartment and out into the cold winter day. 

I didn’t have anything particular in mind to do that day. The urge was satisfied now that I was out but driving around the neighborhood in my car was not exactly the activity that I thought I needed. While the cookie-cutter homes of the surrounding neighborhood started to meld together, I could feel myself slipping back into memories of better times. Times when life was much simpler and the days did not seem to drag on endlessly like I found them now. Even when I drove–on a day off from a dream job that actually gave a crap about me–I still felt utterly empty. 

Steeped in that moment, I began to think back to my childhood. Back to those familiar memories of the CRTV and my brother alone in a dark room. That familiar glow and the static, I could almost hear the crinkle of the screen as the pixels heated rapidly against the pressed glass. The faint smell of Axe body spray that always permeated his room, I thought I could even see the old heavy metal posters that hung on his wall.

All of which was interrupted by an ear-piercing scream that brought me back into harsh reality.

I slammed on my breaks, just in time for the car to stop but mere inches before a woman. Her body braced itself for an impact that wouldn’t happen, the box that she carried now on the road with various books spilled out of it. When the both of us realized what happened, her face grew red with rage as she glared at me. 

“What the hell was that?!” I couldn’t blame her, I almost hit her with my car because I was too busy daydreaming. I jumped out of the car and quickly bent down to help her pick up the objects that she dropped. 

“I’m so sorry, ma’am!” I remember repeating this over and over to her as I grabbed each and every book from the cold asphalt. I could not say it enough and eventually she calmed down enough to huff and continue on her way. Entirely embarrassed by the situation, I began to return to my car to drive off when I noticed where she was taking that box towards. 

Right next to my car was a house in the middle of a garage sale. The garage was wide open and out pooled many tables full of boxes and various objects for sale. The clutter reached to the very sidewalk of the property due to the sheer amount of stuff available, almost like an antique store situated out of someone’s house. 

Well, I guess a garage sale is something like that. And that woman, the same one I almost ran down absently, carried that box over to a man near the entrance to the garage. She plopped the box onto the table in front of him with a huff and exchanged a few words with him while sneaking careful glances towards me. 

I quickly went back to my vehicle and parked my car, now decided that *this* was the thing I wanted to do. Check out some old items at a random neighborhood garage sale. 

It really was a random moment like that, an impossibility, that staved away the monotony the best. I had completely forgotten about my inner turmoil once I saw the potential goldmine that lay before me. Despite almost getting into an accident, I was secretly happy that it even happened at all since it gave me this perfect opportunity to pass the time. I bounded across the street and up to the property once I managed to park nearby. 

Much like any garage sale, there was a mix of useless garbage and somewhat interesting trinkets with a heavy emphasis on the garbage aspect. There were things like old children’s toys from seemingly decades ago to strange garments that I was sure belonged to the person’s great grandparents based on how outdated their designs were. That being said, it was also neat to feel the fabric, how stiff they were with the liberal use of starch back in those days. Most of the items were pretty useless for me if not at least interesting to gaze at but that was all they were–interesting knick knacks. Nothing substantial.

The woman stared at me the whole time I moved from table to table. I could feel her eyes on me as I wandered about which made the whole situation all the more uncomfortable. Her glare was so strong, it got to the point that I started to run through the tables so that I could leave faster. It was then that I almost passed by a clear box packed to the brim with what looked like video game cartridges. I nearly skipped right by it before I caught the familiar glimpse of what looked like a golden Nintendo 64 cartridge. I stopped, thought that there was no way I saw what I thought I saw.

But, to my surprise, when I opened the container and fished out that cartridge, it was a golden N64 cartridge. It was the very famous *Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* gold cartridge, almost ripped straight from my childhood. I looked through the box and found many more games from other consoles including the Playstation, SEGA Dreamcast, and even the original Xbox. I hit the proverbial goldmine that I was after and I could not have been more ecstatic. I grabbed the box and ran up to the man and woman who both stepped back as if in disgust. 

The woman glared at me while the man handled the purchase. I remember muttering an apology to the both of them before the man was willing to give me the box.

“Fifty bucks.” The man gruffly said to me. He had a hard look in his eye and I was all too aware of why. I quickly handed him the money and left once he nodded his head, satisfied in the transaction. 

Clearly not having learned my lesson from before, I drove back home like a bat out of hell. The only thought in my mind was how I was going to fish out my old CRTV and video game consoles from storage and where I would put them in my cramped apartment. The process would be annoying but the excitement I felt overshadowed any negativity to it. I found what people spend thousands to get back, I was going to relish in this achievement one way or another. 

Before I knew it, the day turned to evening and I had finally got everything connected. The process took much longer than anticipated but the end result was well worth the pain. I flicked the old television set on and felt butterflies in my gut as the old thrum of the CRTV rang out softly. The glow of the television illuminated the smile stamped on my face, the static across the screen a comfort to my eyes. I quickly connected my older video game consoles and began my very long night reliving the heights of my youth. 

It must have been close to midnight by the time I noticed the tape in the box. I had just gone through all of the N64 cartridges that was in the box when my hand brushed against an old VHS tape. Puzzled, I picked it up to examine it. There was no writing but the condition of the tape itself was almost immaculate, having no marks or scuffs along the black plastic wrapping. This struck me as strange as it was something I did not notice when I initially looked through the box to begin with. A VHS tape was something I would have noticed yet here it was, just as present as the cartridges that lay before me. 

“No marking…” I remember muttering to myself. It definitely piqued my interest although the chances of it just being a blank VHS tape was very high. I figured things like this happened all the time when people were gathering old junk to sell. Sometimes, things get mixed up and put into places they didn’t belong. 

As it was in my nature, I was curious nonetheless about the tape. It was the *only* video tape in the box amidst video game cartridges and discs. Even though I was confident there was nothing on there, I was still curious enough to check. All the equipment needed to play it was already out so I decided to check it out regardless. The worst that could happen was  nothing would be on the tape and it would just open up to that familiar blue screen. Honestly, that alone was enough for me to try for even seeing that was enough to steep me into nostalgia. 

But, I was wrong. The VHS started once I slipped it in the reader and pressed play. The video began with a dark screen that continued like this for the first five minutes. I almost stopped the tape there until I heard the soft sound of someone breathing coming from the tv. I leaned in closer, thinking that I had misheard something but it was there. Whoever was carrying the recorder was breathing heavily and I could hear it through the tv. It was then that a brilliant flash of light blasted onto the screen only to die suddenly into a ring of candles. Amidst the candles was a figure with a hood over their head. They were sitting in a chair but when I looked closer at the screen, I thought I could make out rope or some material that bound their arms to the back of the chair. Behind the person there were figures clad in dark robes. At first, I thought it was the stutter of the CRTV but the figures swayed in a way that belied presence and I began to grow disturbed. 

*What is this? Who are these people? What is going on?*

All these questions rang in my head as the figures slowly walked closer to the person strapped to the chair, their robes now illuminated by the ring of candles. The figures' whole bodies were hidden, each one wore a mask with no features to hide their faces. It was then that they stopped just inches beside the person who remained still the entire time. They parted in unison for another figure clad entirely in white robes to emerge from the darkness. It was such a sudden transition I gasped at the contrast. The white robed figure approached the person in the chair and removed their hood that covered their face. 

The person looked exactly like me. Same eyes, hairstyle, mouth, everything about them was myself. Except, they were stone-faced. Despite being tied up and surrounded by strange figures, they did not react nor have any sort of expression other than the cold, blank stare that met the screen. 

I was reeling at this point, the whole world spun around me as if I was on some hellish trip that I couldn’t escape from. The person *was* me, this I could not deny. They had all my features even the way my beard would curl around my jawline to the small mole just below my right eye. It was all so uncanny and horrifying I couldn’t help but keep watching the tape in anticipation of something awful about to happen. 

The person clad in my face looked at the camera as one of the black-clad figures from behind stepped closer. I looked on in horror as the figure raised what appeared to be a mallet high above their head, only to crash it down on my doppleganger’s head. A sick crunch rang out from the tv as the figure continuously beat down on my look-alike, more figures approached and brandished their own weapons. They tore at the being ripped them apart with such ferocity that the camera’s screen soon became red from the blood and gore that spewed from the beating. I quickly yanked the VHS player from the outlet and the whole scene blinked away with a sudden hiss as the CRTV fell quiet. 

I don’t know what to do about this. The person looked *just* like me but I’m here. I’m *alive.* And who were those people? The very concept of someone being tortured to death let alone bearing my own face shook me to my core. Even now as I type this, I feel sick to my stomach at the images and sounds that are stuck in my head. The crunching of shattered bone, the squelching of rendered flesh, it all haunted my head.

I’m going to go back to that house and get some answers. Whoever they are, they must know where they got this tape. I will try to update as I go but I hope I make it long enough to get some answers.
