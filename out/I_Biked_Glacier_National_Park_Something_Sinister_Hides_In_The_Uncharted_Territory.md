I love the outdoors, any chance I can, I get out and do some hiking, biking, kayaking, anything to explore. I’m from the western United States so I’ve explored most of the Rocky’s in Colorado, Utah, Jackson hole Wyoming area and a little in Montana. 

I had been planning a trip to glacier national park, one area I went camping as a child a few times, but never got a chance to explore it as an adult. It was August so the weather was perfect mid 80s. Clear skies for the next week. 

I began my journey stopping in Kalispell, Montana, Flathead lake area and the sights were beautiful, water crystal clear you could see 20-30 ft down. I seen a father and son fishing, so I had to ask “how’s the fishing?”
“A few bites” the father said, “but pretty slow”.

I checked into a motel a little further up the road in Hungry Horse Montana. The next morning I got my mountain bike out, it was an older model Gary Fisher, but it has been one hell of a good bike. I have thousands of miles on this bike so it’s been hard letting it go. 

I started on a trailhead outside hungry horse to check out the hungry horse dam. The sights were breathtaking, I seen mountain goats on mountain peaks just watching me as I rode up the trail, waterfalls, beautiful waterfalls and scenery, little chipmunks, and squirrels. Day 1 of my trip has been amazing. 

I set up camp by the lake, a few other campers were in the area but not overly busy. I gathered some firewood and started a fire, set up my tent and ate some dinner. I read my book until I couldn’t see anymore and thought I’d turn in for the night. 

The next morning I gathered my things and made my way towards the next beautiful lake. Lake McDonald, the lake with beautiful colored rocks from the glaciers hundreds of years ago. It was about a 16 mile ride so, I hit the trail fast, 
I arrived at Lake McDonald by mid afternoon. 

This place was extraordinary I could see trout rising for flies on the surface of the lake, the colored rocks were beautiful. Not allowed to take any of course, so I snapped several pictures for memories. A few boats out on the water, and this place was packed with tourists. 

I set up camp in my own little area outside of the area since all the sites were filled around lake McDonald. I spent the remainder of the day scouting trailheads I could take for tomorrow. I found an old trail with overgrowth throughout it, but I could tell it was a trail at one time just hadn’t been maintained in a few years. 

At first light, I made my way to the old trail, and started my way up the mountain, it was rough riding but I figured I’ve made it so far everywhere I’ve went so why quit now. About 3 miles into the trail, I noticed I hadn’t seen another person for hours.  It was rocky steep terrain, but it finally flattened out and a ways back into the woods I seen what looked like an old abandoned cabin or rangers station something of that sort up ahead in the woods, It was dark and creepy the location of the place so I approached with caution. 

I got up close to the cabin and seen the front door was open swinging in the breeze. I decided to explore being the adventure type that I am. It was a two bedroom cabin with a basement, still furnished like somebody had been living there but with furniture that was 20 plus years old.  As I was about ready to leave and get back on the trail. I heard a noise like something or someone was moving around in the basement. 

As I approached the basement door I heard a moan it sounded horrifying like somebody in extreme pain, I opened the door and called out “hello” is someone down there?” “Are you ok”?
Then I heard it again a quiet gurgled help me!! 
I started to panic not knowing if I should go down there, what if it was a trap, I was in somebody’s house without permission. 

Then I decided I can’t just leave someone hurt or in trouble down there without knowing. It would eat at me forever. So, I turned on my flashlight and made my way into the basement it smelled terrible down there. It was unfinished with a dirt floor, I flashed my light around asking “where are you”? Are you ok? Then the same time as I heard the response I seen a poor lady covered in blood chained to a wall barely clinging on to life.

She had missing fingers cuts all over her body, covered in blood from head to toe. I thought I need to get her outta here and fast. “Who did this to you” I said. She didn’t have the energy to even respond as I looked closer she started gurgling blood coughing it up. Then I noticed her guts were hanging out. She wasn’t gonna make it. I panicked as I knew I had to get out of here. Whoever did this could be back soon. 

As I made my way back towards the stairs I noticed human remains and bones piled up in the corner, flies everywhere and the most rancid smell I’ve ever smelled. The floor was stained with blood and it looked like some kind of hell on earth. I regained composure and quickly ran up the stairs and outside of the cabin to my bike. 

As I got on and started riding away I heard yelling and screaming and looked over my shoulder to see two what looked kinda like men but deformed men. wearing furs and and war paint, but I was unsure. One had arrows and was readying his bow to take a shot at me. I took off as fast as I could, then shot behind a tree to avoid an incoming arrow. I heard grunts and weird animalistic noises coming from these things.  I had to ok act fast so I took off the side of the mountain making my own trail.

This was a mistake as I tumbled almost immediately and fell several hundred feet. I was injured pretty badly, and my bike was gone further down the ravine. The adrenaline kicked in as I got up and started running as fast as I could along the side of the mountain in the direction I thought was back towards civilization. 

I noticed blood trickling down my pant leg and from my head. I knew I couldn’t stop for anything though as whatever those things were, had to be on my trail fast. I could still hear the grunting and groaning of them not far behind, and this made me pick up my pace and the hurt went away.  

It was getting dark out and I still had no clue where I was. I was terrified, shook up, and the pain was at a 9/10 now. I had to rest so I made a shelter hidden amongst the brush to blend in so I was not easily found. I heard strange noises all throughout the night, not getting a wink of sleep. No sign of the deformed men, so at first light I took off continuing towards what I had hoped was lake McDonald.  

I was moving much slower today, as the adrenaline wore off, but I knew I wasn’t completely safe yet.  I hiked several miles, wishing I had my bike. Bloody and broken, I made my way out to a recognizable trail and came across a couple hikers, who called an ambulance. 

I was kept overnight in the hospital with fractured ribs,collarbone, and a 3” gash across my head. It’s a wonder what adrenaline can do when afraid for your life.

The police interviewed me asking what happened. I told them where I went what I seen everything. They went up to the location I had given them, and they found nothing no blood, no remains just an old beaten down abandoned cabin. I know what I seen and what was chasing me. Those deformed cannibals knew what they were doing and must be stopped.
