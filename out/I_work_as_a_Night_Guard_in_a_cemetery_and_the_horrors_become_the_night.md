I have only attempted to train one person in the fourteen years I have worked in my local cemetery. I now have the incredible task of training two young men in the ways of the Night Guard. Jacob and Seth are either the next new night guards or next sacrifices to the cemetery. 

They have both been given an intense breakdown of the responsibilities and the importance of not talking after the gates are closed. Something that should be a simple one minute rundown but usually lasts a couple hours over the severity of consequences if you open your mouth and say anything to anyone.

If a ghost can hear you speak, they can cross whatever threshold that bars them from touching the material world and directly interact with the speaker. There is no love for those that welcome the touch of death.

The only relief I was able to guarantee for myself was the responsibility of watching over only one new trainee at a time, alternating between the two each shift I work.

The first night of training Jacob had been an easy night that only had one strange occurrence that I have never seen before.

Just after the 10pm gate lock, Jacob and I were making our way to clean up the new mausoleum. There had been no remains that needed to be cleaned and it was just a collection of litter that had been left behind by the town’s residents. The former mayor had not been very popular and the standing rumor was that he had embezzled a lot of money during his time as mayor.

Upon removing the last of the rotten produce a grating metal on concrete sound approached us from behind. The former contractor that had lost his temper and then his life over a phone, groaned a muffled shriek.

Wrought Iron spindles pierced throughout his body and face made it impossible for him to communicate any words to us. The slight clinking of the spindles as they bounced off of one another whenever he tried to move echoed in our ears. His skin had soured to the color of spoiled tuna around the oversized piercings. Any attempt he would make to remove the spindles as he neared us proved fruitless as his arms were fixed in place leaving him unable to clasp onto any of the rods. Not that he could have actually grabbed onto anything as his fingers bent and twisted like branches of corkscrew willow. The lower half of his clothing was stained burgundy with dried blood that appeared decades old.

I put a hand on Jacob’s shoulder and guided him past the departed making sure to have myself between him and the latest occupier of the night. This was the first time I had seen someone who had been killed by the spirits within the cemetery return as another of the imprisoned nightmares.

I had always assumed that the unfortunate souls consumed by the cemetery were just that. Consumed. Devoured. Devoid of existence in any afterlife either heaven or hell. Now I had either proof that not all killed in the cemetery were truly never to be seen again or an outlier of someone so full of rage that he was cursed to consume the souls of others just as he had been consumed.

Jacob had taken his first encounter with the night dwellers surprisingly well. He had tensed when I placed a hand on his shoulder but his legs did not lock in place as he was guided away. Most important of all, he did not speak at the sight.

The remainder of the night had been uneventful and Jacob turns out to be quite the ping pong player. Thomas and I did a 2v1 against him and he skunked us twice in a row. He won every single match we played and I could tell the distraction was good for him. Mad Michael really enjoyed watching us play and kept score. He even only made one vague prediction of death the entire time.

Mad Michael has become one of the new favorite spirits since Callahan killed that contractor. Mrs. McCarthy is still the unanimous favorite as her raunchy tales have somehow become even more explicit without the chastising from a disgraced priest. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a wilder story involving a branding iron, a bottle of scotch, and a pigeon before in my life.

My next shift I was with Isaac and I told him about seeing the contractor again. He was equally confused as he had also never seen anyone ‘come back’ after dying in the cemetery. We agreed that we would have to ask Eli or one of the other old guards if they had ever seen anything like that before.

Seth was giving another rundown about the rules and warned again that under no circumstances is he to talk to anyone while the gates are locked. With a nod we set out for another night and Seth stood in lockstep with me every minute we walked the grounds.

Seth was shaken by the night, the job was not for him. This became more and more obvious as Callahan split open with a demented shriek as I held up a middle finger to him as we walked by. When Mrs. McCarthy made a crass comment about having a hot piece of ass keeping an eye over her stomping grounds, I was certain Seth was going to lose his dinner. It is actually quite a sight to see someone blush redder than a tomato while also looking green in the gills.

I was certain of my decision to tell him in the morning to find work elsewhere when we found the forewarning given by Mad Michael during my previous shift. 

Suspended in the air by a series of winged squids with spiked vines for tentacles was an indistinguishable mass of human remains. What was once a torso…or head…or maybe  even a thigh, was being repeatedly kicked by the iron pierced contractor before the three-faced fox unhinged its middle jaw to consume the meaty chunk. 

To his defense, Seth did not say a word until the gates were unlocked in the morning. As the three of us stepped outside he said he didn’t think the job was for him. I wholeheartedly agreed and bid him farewell.

Making a grand for a night is good money to make, but the alcohol needed to dull the memory will become expensive without the slow apathy that grows the longer you guard the night.

I feel bad for Seth with his first night being as rough as it was.

And yet, the cemetery is a place not for the living to so carelessly enter.

Not everyone can comprehend the horrors within, and even I am only able to give a feeble attempt at describing the amalgamations that I see.

The fountain depicts Phobetor and Phantasos, the Greek gods of nightmares both real and surreal. 

But of the two, I think that if any being truly rules over this cemetery. Phantasos is the one who domineers the night.
