**Recording #1** 

*(Sounds of tape click and slight background hiss)*



**Jack Sullivan (calm, steady):**

>"This is Jack Sullivan. The date is March 3rd, 1982. I’m sitting down with Mr. and Mrs. Thompson regarding the disappearance of their daughter, Emily. Let’s begin. Can you tell me when you last saw Emily?"

>

**Mrs. Thompson (nervous, soft-spoken):**

>"It was Monday night. She left around 9:30 to visit her friend Lisa in Jackson Heights. She said she’d be home by midnight... but she never came back."



**Mr. Thompson (more guarded, trying to stay composed):**

>"She takes the same route every time. 74th Street–Broadway Station, the 7 train to Times Square, then the 1 train uptown. It’s routine. She’s done it a hundred times."



**Jack:**

>"Was she alone? Or meeting anyone else that night?"

>

**Mrs. Thompson:**

>"No… just Lisa. They were studying together for a college midterm. Lisa said she walked Emily to the station herself. That was around 10:15."

>

**Jack:**

>"Do you recall what Emily was wearing that evening?"



**Mr. Thompson:**

>"Yeah... she had on her red varsity jacket, the one with the patches from her high school. Blue jeans, white sneakers. And a gray knit hat. She always wears that thing this time of year."



**Mrs. Thompson (choking up):**

>"She had her blue backpack, too. The one I got her for her birthday. Lisa said she was holding it when she went down the steps to the platform."



**Jack (pauses briefly, voice softens):**

>"Thank you. I know this isn’t easy. One last question for now, has Emily said or done anything unusual lately? Any changes in behavior?"

>

**Mr. Thompson:**

>"No. Nothing strange. She’s been happy, focused on school. No problems that we knew of..."

>

**Mrs. Thompson:**

>"She… she did say something odd the week before. That she saw an old train on the tracks, but it didn’t stop. Said it didn’t look like anything she’d seen before. I thought she was joking."



*(Jack is silent for a beat, then clicks the recorder off.)*



 **Journal Entry – March 3rd, 1982**



Met with the Thompsons. Emily was last seen in Jackson Heights, headed toward 74th Street–Broadway Station around 10:30 PM. She never made it home.



The parents are shaken. The mother mentioned something odd — a train Emily claimed to have seen that “didn’t look right.” Probably just a tired girl seeing shadows. Still, it's noted.

**Recording #2**



**Jack:**

>"This is Jack Sullivan. I’m at 74th Street–Broadway Station. No witnesses, no sightings. The night Emily vanished, there were no scheduled trains during her window — nothing should’ve been running. That’s either a massive coincidence… or something else is going on."

\---



 **Journal Entry – Later That Day**



I talked to an old janitor who works nights. He told me about a “ghost train” that rides through abandoned lines when no one’s watching. Said it doesn’t just carry passengers, it takes them.



Probably just a local legend. Subway crews like to mess with the new guy. But something about the way he said it… gave me chills. Still, legends don’t abduct 19-year-old girls. Someone does.

**Recording #3**

*(\[Rustling debris. Low hum. Jack’s breathing shallow.\])*



**Jack (whispering):**

>"Jack Sullivan. March 4th, 1982. Found a tunnel behind the south maintenance wall, way off the maps I’ve seen. Had to crawl through a collapsed bulkhead."



*(\[Footsteps crunching, flashlight clicks.\])*



>"Inside… there’s piles of clothes, old backpacks, shoes. Nothing fresh. But this isn’t a maintenance dump. Someone’s using this place. Maybe living down here. Or maybe… they’re bringing people here."



*(\[Distant, slow train whistle, unnatural, echoes through the space. Jack stops.\])*



>"...You hear that?"



*(\[Silence.\])*



>"That sounded like a train. But no line runs this deep. Not anymore."



*(\[Long pause. Jack exhales.\])*



>"...It’s probably just wind through the vents. But I’m logging it just in case."



*(\[Tape click.\])*

**Journal Entry – March 4th, 1982**



I keep circling the same possibilities ,abduction, trafficking, maybe even some kind of sick ritual cult operating out of the tunnels.



But now there’s this other piece: I found an article from 1913. Charles Atherton , a railroad mogul, was accused of murdering his competitors to win tunnel contracts. The one he built? Never used. It was sealed after several unexplained deaths during construction.



That’s the tunnel I found.



I’m not saying I believe in ghost trains. But I am saying there’s a pattern of disappearances tied to this stretch of track going back over 70 years.



And I don’t think it’s over.

**Recording #4**



*(\[Low, tired voice. He sounds conflicted.\])*



>"This is Jack. I’m going back to the platform tonight, during the off-hours. Still think there’s a real person behind this — a killer, not a spirit. But if something’s using these abandoned tunnels to grab people… I’m gonna find it."



*(\[Pause.\])*



>"And if that train whistle wasn’t just the wind? Then I guess I’ll have one hell of a story on tape."

>

*(\[Tape clicks off.\])*



**Recording #5** 

*(\[Tape clicks. Soft hiss. Ambient echo of an empty subway platform. Jack's voice is steady, tired.\])*



**Jack:**

>"This is Jack Sullivan. It's just past midnight. The last scheduled train left the station ten minutes ago. I've checked the board. From here on out… nothing should be coming through."

*(Pause. You can hear Jack shifting on a bench.)*

>"So now we wait. Let’s see if the old man’s ghost story has any legs."



*(\[Tape continues for a beat. Then click, cut off.\])*

  


\---



**Recording #6** 

*(\[New tape click. The hiss is heavier now. Distant squeaking echoes from the tunnel.\])*



**Jack (quietly, uncertain):**

>"...I’m hearing something. Just off the edge of the platform. Real faint… sounds like wheels dragging. Not fast. Sluggish. Metallic."

>

*(\[The squeaking gets louder. Jack inhales sharply.\])*



**Jack:**

>"...Jesus. It’s just some damn homeless guy. Pushing a shopping cart along the rail bed."

*(Relieved exhale.)*

>"Scared the hell out of me."



*(\[He lets out a dry chuckle. The recorder clicks off.\])*



\---



**Recording #7**

*(\[Tape clicks. This time Jack’s voice is tense. There’s something in the background: a low whistle, distant… but approaching.\])*



**Jack (serious now):**

>"There it is again. That whistle."

*(A beat.)*

>"Closer this time. And—no—no scheduled service until five a.m."

*(Pause. Jack’s footsteps as he walks toward the platform edge.)*



**Jack (low):**

>"I see lights."



*(\[There’s a building hum — the faint sound of metal gliding on rails. It grows louder. The whistle sounds again, sharper now.\])*



**Jack (awed, skeptical):**

>"What the hell...? It’s a train. Looks... old. The body’s—Jesus—the body’s pristine, but soaked. Like it just crawled out of a lake. Not a scratch on it, but it’s dripping wet."

*(Footsteps slowly approach.)*



**Jack (more intense):**

>"The windows are all fogged, but there’s this... yellow light shining through. Like it’s lit by candles."

*(Long pause. Then — a mechanical hiss. The train door opens. A moist thump, like old rubber gaskets giving way. Jack gasps.)*



**Jack (softly, almost broken):**

>"...Elaine? Is that you?"



*(\[Silence. The background hum changes — now more ambient, like home. Jack’s voice grows distant, dreamy.\])*



**Jack:**

>"...Oh my God. It's—it's the house. Our old place in Queens. But this can’t be… it smells like her perfume."

>

*(\[Distant background: the faintest wet, organic squelching. It doesn’t overpower — just sits under everything, subtly wrong.\])*



**Jack (laughing softly):**

>"You kept the couch? I thought we tossed that thing years ago..."

*(He walks deeper inside. Footsteps fade slightly. Then:)*

>"...Honey, is that roast chicken? You remembered..."



*(\[The train door hisses shut. A dull wet thunk follows, final and heavy.\])*

  


*(\[Recorder still running. Jack's voice is dreamy, caught in the hallucination.\])*



**Jack (soft, smiling):**

>"You remembered the couch… I thought we got rid of that old thing after your sister—"

*(He trails off. A long pause. You hear him sniff once. Then again. The air has changed.)*



**Jack (quieter now):**

>"...No. Wait. That’s not"

*(A longer pause. Something shifts in his tone, from fond to confused.)*

>"...You can’t be here."

>

*(\[He takes a few steps. A soft squish beneath his shoes.\])*



**Jack (panicked):**

>"No. No, no, no, this isn’t real. This"

*(He starts breathing heavier. A hand hits metal, or what should be metal.)*



**Jack (angrily, desperately):**

>"This can’t be real. You died. Elaine, you, you died six years ago. I buried you."



*(\[He gasps. Something changes, a sound like a heartbeat in the walls. The illusion slips.\])*



**Jack:**

>"...What the fuck is this?"



*(\[Shuffling. A chair scrapes, but it’s wet. A sinewy tearing sound as he rises.\])*



**Jack (horrified):**

>"...Where am I? Is this... the train?"



*(\[The background grows more organic: low pulsing, like breathing or a distant stomach churn.\])*



**Jack (disbelieving):**

>"...The walls… it all looks like, flesh. Red. Wet. Alive."

*(\[He steps forward. A moist squelch with every step.\])*



**Jack:**

>"The seats… they’re not seats. They’re ribs. Cushioned ribs. The holding poles feel like tendons. They’re flexing."

*(A wet slap. He recoils.)*

>"And the windows, God, the windows are sealed with… some kind of thin, clear membrane. Like… like teeth pressed together."



*(\[He touches something. A wet tack as his fingers stick to it.\])*



**Jack (gagging):**

>"The lights, those yellow lights, they're not bulbs. They're sacs. Glowing… fleshy sacs."



*(\[The ambient sound swells, a wet mechanical thrum as if the train itself is waking up. Or feeding.\])*



**Jack (panicking):**

>"No, no, NO, get me the fuck OUT of here!"



*(\[He starts banging on what was once a door, now it sloshes like muscle under skin.\])*



**Jack (screaming):**

>"OPEN! LET ME OUT! LET ME"



**Unknown Voice (distorted):**

>"...next stop..."

>

*(\[Wind rushes. Jack gasps, feet pounding. Then a sudden, wet THUD, a fleshy, bone-snapping CRUNCH. The wind continues.\])*



*(\[Beat. Silence. Then faint, wet breathing.\])*



**Jack (gasping):**

>"Darkness. I’m still falling. I can't see"



*(\[Sudden impact, a hard, wet floor. Jack wheezes.\])*



**Jack (barely audible):**

>"...Elaine… I’m sorry…"

*(He exhales. A faint, wet sound echoes. Like something feeding.)*



*(\[Tape hisses. Then silence.\])*



**> Incident Notes:**

*Audio ends abruptly after the subject appears to attempt escape. Based on environmental noise, the subject exited the train during non-stop travel.*

*Body not recovered.*



*The phrase "next stop..." has been noted in two additional missing persons cases from 1984 and 1986.*

*NYCTA formally denies all supernatural associations.*
