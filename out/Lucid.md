I keep a dream journal, and I've been actively writing on it since I was a teenager.

I started doing this after I realized that most times, my dreams feel more like me watching a movie. Some of them were silly, like this dream I had of a group of students worried because they couldn't finish their dinner. Others were more frightening, like the time I dreamt of a man walking down an alley, keeping a steady walking pace because if he ran, the thing with many teeth following him would give chase.

That ended with the man losing his nerve and running, and the last thing I remembered was seeing a shadow lined with rows and rows and rows of teeth.

One morning where I woke up with my heart pounding and sweat making my bed damp, I felt frustrated as I realized shortly after waking that I couldn't recall what exactly got me so worked up. The only bit I could remember was that there were people hiding in some kind of cabin, and even the slightest noise they made would cause whatever was outside to notice. I wrote that down anyway, and thought nothing more about it as I started my day.

The following morning, I woke up again with the same feeling; heart pounding and my bedclothes and sheets drenched with sweat. I quickly grabbed my journal and prepared to write but then, I couldn't remember what happened.

Again, all I recalled was that it was still about those people in the cabin. Hiding, struggling to keep even their breathing quiet. Outside it was pitch black, and something large and unnatural was stalking the building.

I let out a deep sigh and prepared to write when I saw that there was already something written on the page.

"Help."

It was one word, written in extremely small handwriting that I almost didn't notice it. I actually almost didn't and the only reason why I saw it was because it was written in blue ink.

This made me pause. I asked my girlfriend and then my brother if they did this, if this was some kind of practical joke since they knew about my journal. Both denied doing it, arguing as well that among the three of us, I was the one who can write extremely small.

I went about my day and the next few nights, I dreamt more regular dreams. Some were about me, with one having me back in high school and realizing I didn't study for a test. Nothing major at all.

Then this past Thursday, I woke up in the middle of the night.

My heart was pounding and I was frightened. The darkness of my bedroom was oppressive and stifling, the air heavy and humid. I reached out to turn the fan on and discovered that the side table that had my fan and my lamp weren't there, that my girlfriend wasn't sleeping beside me, and that the bed I was on wasn't the one from my house.

My vision slowly adjusted and as I turned around, my eyes found the window. A bright yellow moon was the only thing visible against a backdrop of sheer black.

"What the fuc..." I muttered just as there was this shuffling sound to my right.

I recoiled as I saw her, a gaunt wisp of a girl huddled against the corner of the room just beside the bed. Her skin was pale, so very deathly pale, and her black hair was plastered on her face. Her eyes were orbs of pure black, and as I stared I saw pure fear in those eyes.

She quickly raised a trembling hand and holding out a finger, pressed them to her lips.

The dim light suddenly got dimmer and turning to the window, I saw something obscure the moon.

My blood froze and my body went rigid. What the fuck was happening?

"Help..." A tiny croak of a whisper cried out beside me. Turning back to the little girl, I saw that she moved closer, crawling an inch to and on top of the bed. "Please..." She said again, her tiny voice pleading. "Help..."

I blinked and suddenly, I was staring at my bedroom ceiling. I sat up and saw my room, my stuff, my girlfriend still asleep beside me.

I was drenched in sweat and my heart again pounding like mad. I grabbed my phone and checked the time: it was still too early, just about ten minutes before 5am.

I sat there for a moment, gathering my thoughts and steady my heart. I had no idea what happened, what that was, only that it was a nightmare that felt so fucking real. After a few deep breaths, I felt calm enough to realize that I wanted to take a piss and change out of my sweaty clothes, possibly even take a shower.

As I got out of bed, I stepped on something. Looking down I saw it was my journal.

It was lying face up and open, the page entirely blank except for a few extremely small written words.

"Help... Please help us..."
