I received the call during a routine patrol with my fellow officer in the neighbourhood. It was near midnight on a Friday night, the moon was shining brightly in the clear sky.

We were covering the old town of the metropolitan, where historical buildings mixed with new developments. Hip boutiques, artisan shops, antiques dealers, bistros & cafes filled the narrow streets. It was an area for the middle-class where the bourgeois hang out and lived. A peaceful community with only occasional petty crimes. Although it was late at night, the bars and bistros were still full of people, cheering and laughing out loud despite their hollow souls and exhausted minds.

According to the emergency dispatcher, the caller was a middle-aged man who wasn’t fully conscious nor could he speak clearly. He murmured in agony to ask for immediate help. Although he couldn’t explain what situation he was in, the operator could barely hear the address. She caught his name as Jacob and heard him saying, 

“The devil is trying to kill me.” 

At first, we thought it was just another case of alcoholism or drug abuse.

“Sergeant Dickinson, here we are.” said officer Gordon. She was a rookie cop who graduated from the cadet school last year. A blonde with a fit build, she was bright with a great work attitude. “Let’s pull over at the front.” I said. We parked our cruiser outside Residence 82. It was in autumn and the wind was chilly outside. I looked at my watch, it was four minutes after we received the call. Residence 82 was a high rise apartment building with modern and post-industrial architectural design. 

The caretaker, a short and skinny man with silver hair, opened the main door for us when he saw us approaching. “How can I help you?” “We received a man’s call from flat B on the 23rd floor, who is seeking emergency help.” I said. “Oh, Mr. Williams? I wish him well.” said the caretaker. “What is his first name? Is anyone else in the apartment now?” officer Gordon asked. “His first name is Leo. No, I don’t think so. The quiet gentleman lives alone, and never has visitors.” replied the caretaker. Officer Gordon and I gazed at each other, but remained silent.

We took the elevator to the 23rd floor. There were four units on the storey. Officer Gordon pressed the doorbell. Nobody answered. She knocked and spoke aloud our purpose. Still completely silent in the apartment. But strangely, when she tried to turn the handle, we found the door was unlocked. “Let’s be cautious, officer Gordon.” I said in a very low voice. With our hands ready to grip from our gun holsters anytime, we opened the door and entered quietly. 

The apartment was cosy and spacious. Nobody was in the living room and the lights were off. Through the large windows, we could see our unsleeping city in bird’s view. The city’s lights shined through the windows and let us see the interior clearly. Besides posh designer furniture, the place was filled with art pieces and unusual objects. However, the collection was somewhat random and bizarre. Objects such as hand written letters, used envelopes, long knives and clothes were framed individually. There were sketches and scribbles just like children’s drawings but depicting the most obscene acts. The large paintings all revolved around morbid themes - killings, body horror, decaying corpses and tortures to name a few.

There was light from the room at the end of the corridor, and the door was opened. “We are the police. We are entering your room now!” I shouted. Silence. We approached that room slowly, and made sure the other two rooms, the bedroom and the bathroom, located on the left and on the right of the corridor were clear, before we finally reached its door. We held our guns in ready position. 

I held my breath and entered the room, officer Gordon followed. It was the study. A man was lying still on the floor. He was bold, aged around mid-forties, muscular body with very pale skin. I stepped forward to check his breath with my fingers, it was stopped. I tried my torch with his pupils, they weren’t reflexing. Finally, a detection of pulse on his wrists, nothing. “He is a dead man. Now, let’s find out who he is and what killed him.” I said to officer Gordon. We called for support and began our search. We couldn’t find any bruises, cuts or defensive wounds around his body. The study had simply a desk and a bookshelf full of books. It was neat and tidy except the mobile phone fell next to him on the floor. There was no sign of struggle at the scene. “Sergeant Dickinson, please have a look at this.” said officer Gordon.

There was a document called the social worker report and a letter lying on the desk. Next to them was an opened cardboard envelope. It looked as if he had just opened the parcel and started reading them. The social worker report was issued by the department of corrections, it was for an inmate called Jacob Devon. The letter was handwritten and signed:

Dear Leo,

I hope life is treating you well.

Here you go, I have enclosed a present for you - The original copy of my first social worker report, after I was put in prison for having taken those sixteen lifes. 

It has been twelve years since we first exchanged letters and started our trades. It’s interesting to see your murderabilia business is prospering. The collectibles from me, like those random stuff I have used and my silly scribbles, have rocketed in value. I have also become the hero of fellow sickos, receiving more and more letters from my fans. But you know what? I was born a killer, and only killing can make me truly happy. Being in a supermax prison for life sentence makes it nearly hopeless for me to satisfy my desire again. Luckily, one of my admirers is of great help. He is a talented scientist and a murderabilia collector. He has become fascinated by the idea of killing but doesn’t know how to start. So I gave him some encouragement and we worked up a plan. 

Do you find the social worker report a bit dusty? There is no dust. It is the new deadly poison he made, which is killing you in minutes. He is so kind that he even delivered this parcel to your mailbox in person. No hard feelings my friend, there is nothing personal. You are only the first, and I am sure he will make good use of this new poison, just like I did with mine back in the good old days. Anyway, thank you for everything you have done for me, and I wish you rest in peace.

Your sincerely,

Jacob Devon
