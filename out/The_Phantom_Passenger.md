Driving for a rideshare service, you get used to weird things happening. Drunks stumbling into your car, people having bizarre conversations on their phones, the occasional passenger who swears they’ve been in your car before, even when they haven’t. But nothing could have prepared me for what happened last Friday night.

It was around 2 a.m., and I was thinking about calling it a night when I got a ping for a pickup in a quiet residential area. I pulled up outside the house, and a woman got in. She was pale, almost sickly looking, with dark circles under her eyes. She didn’t say a word as she settled into the back seat, staring straight ahead. I asked her for the destination, but she just pointed down the road. Figuring she might be too tired to talk, I started driving.

The ride was unnervingly silent. I tried to make small talk—asking how her night was, if she lived in the area—but she didn’t respond. She just sat there, staring out the window. After a few minutes, I noticed something odd in the rearview mirror. Her reflection was blurry, almost like it was out of focus. I blinked, thinking it was just my tired eyes playing tricks on me, but when I looked again, her reflection was gone entirely.

My heart started to race, but I tried to stay calm. Maybe it was just a trick of the light, or maybe the mirror was dirty. I kept driving, hoping the ride would be over soon. But then, out of nowhere, the woman spoke. Her voice was soft, almost a whisper. “You shouldn’t be out this late,” she said. “It’s dangerous.” I glanced at her in the mirror, but her reflection still wasn’t there. A chill ran down my spine. I asked her what she meant, but she didn’t answer. Instead, she leaned forward, her face inches from the back of my head.

I felt her cold breath on my neck as she whispered, “They’re coming for you.” I slammed on the brakes, my heart pounding in my chest. I whipped around to face her, but the back seat was empty. The door hadn’t opened, and there was no way she could have gotten out without me noticing. She had simply… vanished.

I sat there for a few minutes, trying to make sense of what had just happened. My mind raced with possibilities—maybe I was just exhausted, maybe I had imagined the whole thing. But the cold spot where she had been sitting told me otherwise. I quickly checked the rideshare app, but there was no record of the trip, no sign that she had ever been in my car.

I drove home in a daze, my mind replaying the night over and over again. The next day, I did some research on the address where I had picked her up, and what I found sent a shiver down my spine. A woman had died there, in a car accident, exactly one year ago to the day. The reports said she had been on her way home late at night when she lost control of her car and crashed into a tree. She died instantly.

I’ve tried to rationalize what happened, but deep down, I know the truth. That woman was a ghost, and she was trying to warn me. Ever since that night, I’ve had the feeling that someone—or something—is watching me. I’ve stopped driving at night, but the feeling won’t go away. And sometimes, when I’m alone in my car, I catch a glimpse of something in the rearview mirror—a pale face, dark eyes, and a whisper that chills me to the bone: “They’re coming for you.”
