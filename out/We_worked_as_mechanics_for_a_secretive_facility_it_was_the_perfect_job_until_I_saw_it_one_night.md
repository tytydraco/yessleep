So I signed a lot of NDA-type documents before working this job, but this story happened in the late 80s and I can’t even find any trace of the company online so I think it’s okay if I name them, I will however not be using any real names here.

When I was young I didn’t have a good family life. I got on with my older brother but when your parents couldn’t give a crap you tend to go without a lot. So, following in my brother's footsteps when I hit 18 I hit the road in search of seasonal work. I always enjoyed the idea of travelling around, working whatever job I can, and after hearing my brother's tales from the road it was the only thing I wanted. 

I had a good time for a while, I was a seasonal chef, a farm worker (learned a lot of Spanish here), temporary work at stores and just a whole load of jobs that allowed me to meet so many people and learn so many things.

As with all good things though, this part of my life had to eventually end and by the time I hit my early 30s, I wanted something more permanent. Tired of short-term friendships and unfamiliar beds I decided to scour the papers for anything that might let me get a good footing, I had enough money to get set up basically wherever but that wouldn’t last long without an income.

It was almost a sheer moment of fate that I happened across a job posting in a local paper while doing some seasonal farm work down in Texas. I can’t remember it exactly but there were promises of a good wage, free accommodation and a career for life with infinite growth potential within the company. I didn’t quite believe it at first, especially because the job was a few states north but seeing how perfectly this fit in with my yearning to settle I figured it must be a sign or something.

I quickly got an interview with them even noting that the variety of experience I had will do well for me, probably the first time I’d heard that. They met me at a coffee shop in a company-owned town that was just down the road from the Facility (or so he called it) and was a very quaint little town hidden among a pine forest. Everyone seemed relatively polite if not busy with their own lives as they went about on their day off.
“Everyone here works for Sampersons.” Remarked the interviewer, a friendly seeming woman named Barb with silver hair put up into a neat bun.

“Really? It seems nice here to be honest.” I remarked looking out the nearby window as I took a sip from the free coffee in front of me.

“I’ve looked over your experience and I just had a few questions, nothing about your work or anything you’ve certainly got a diverse resume but I do need you to answer a few… personal questions before we can bring you in.” His eyes darted from me to the window, making the perfect amount of eye contact which was oddly comforting, I’d suggest this is why I responded the way I did.

“Uh yeah, sure.” Understandably I don’t normally talk about myself but there was something about her, about this place, a new sensation I hadn’t felt before. This place felt like home.

“So you have moved from place to place a lot but here we pride ourselves in keeping our employees as lifelong family members, is this something you’d be interested in?” Her calm voice somehow pierced through the mutter of the cafegoers. 

“Honestly, that’s why I’m here. I’ve never really stayed in one place even as a child and coming here…” I paused and returned my gaze outside. “Here I could stay.”
Looking back at Barb I saw an empathetic smile of recognition across her face. Without saying a word she began to frantically look through a pink handbag she had been keeping close. Ripping out a pile of papers and a pen she slaps them in front of me.

“If you just want to read through these and sign we can get you set up with a nice apartment this afternoon. Fully furnished and you will love how much space you get.”
I signed those papers (just a load of NDA-type things and a very standard work contract with plenty of benefits) and yes, I got my apartment that afternoon I was able to move in as soon as I arrived back with my large pack from the hotel a town over. 

The apartment was beautiful, even by today's standards you would call it modern. Huge windows with blinds across them, hardwood floor with basically an entire floor to myself. It took me a few weeks to get my sleeping routine down because I wasn’t used to sleeping in a room so big.

The work was easy, I worked as a janitor in the beginning within the local town but it was only a year in when I got the opportunity to train as a mechanic. I even convinced my brother to come to visit and celebrate my promotion (a decision I now regret), and within a week he was working my old job and living a few doors down. A year on again and I’d be training up my brother to work on the transport vehicles with me.


I tell you all of this because I want to get the point across that this place became my life, it’s not that the company wanted loyalty or anything, just don’t talk about your role with anyone you don’t directly work with and they will pay you well, give you a great place to stay and all the shops and restaurants in the town where heavily discounted if not free on some days. Importantly there wasn’t anything strange, not yet, but at this point, all of my work had been in the actual town itself, I’d only once been to the Facility to fix up a truck enough to take it to the workshop in town.

What did this Facility do? As far as I knew it held a separate living area for some of the staff and a large production facility for things like vitamins and supplements. Again nothing about this seemed suspicious or anything it was all pretty normal.


Eventually while working on a particularly frustrating truck, my brother and I would be approached by a member of HR, he was a non-descript white guy in a suit but he seemed nice enough. He wanted to know if we were interested in additional training, a pay rise and shorter hours by working at the facility. My brother wasn’t too sure and it took him a little convincing, mostly done by myself, I’d been desperate for a while to move over and do something a bit more challenging.

The training was odd, we were trained to maintain and fix a machine that we had no idea what it did. Any questions about this would always result in the same answer from anyone we asked: “You know not to ask about another department”. As far as I could tell it transferred electricity through a missing middle section that we never got a look at, other than this the machine also seemed to oscillate some form of radiation through glass tubes that curve around the centre section. We truly had no idea what was going on outside our workshop and by the time we’d finished for the day everything was quiet at the Facility.

This is where the story really begins, the thing that would force me to leave that almost perfect place, to leave nearly a decade at this point of my life behind.


My brother and myself got placed together after our training was complete, they figured we’d work better together and they were very much correct. We quickly became the “dream team” as our supervisor would put it and we got placed on the night shift, a position that paid even better than the others and was only three nights a week.

At night the machines were off, but that meant we could take our time and not have to worry too much about rushing, if anything that’s why they put us on the night shift, fixing one of these machines was easy but maintaining them so they don’t need to be fixed as much as real art, on top of this we got to work on things outside our little workshop giving us a little more freedom around the Facility.

It was calm the night we found it, too calm. Often there’s a clatter in the distance or a hum of electricity as the evening facilities do their thing, but that night all of the seemed to be still. The machine we were maintaining that evening had weakened glass and needed it replaced, the deafening silence and need for focus killing any conversation.

“I’ll get the replacement reserve tube and we can put that in before the main one, yeah?” It was reassuring having my older brother around, and even more reassuring that he had remembered the reserve tube, something I had in fact forgotten.

“Okay, go grab it from the workshop I’ll see if I can get this glass out without creating a mess.” I chuckled as I gestures towards a door at the other end of the dark warehouse.

“Two minutes.” He groaned as he stood up and broke into a light jog.

“Oi! Be careful, I don’t want to have to wait an hour for another one out of storage, you know what they’re like at this time of the night.” I didn’t get a response, he was already out of sight among the pitch-black maze of shelves and industrial equipment.

Signing I began to slowly remove the glass, the fact that it’s a twisted pipe of 2mm glass didn’t help things along but I was able to get it out without much in the way of trouble. Gently placing it down next to the machine I took the opportunity to take a drink of my now lukewarm mug of coffee.

A loud bang broke me out of my brief trance, followed by the loud and panicked cry of my brother.

“COME OVER, I FOUND SOMEONE, CALL SOMEONE. I THINK HE'S DEAD, MAN.” 
I broke out onto a sprint, a now empty coffee cup in hand. He was standing by the doorway to the workshop and through the backlight, I could make out my brother in the doorway, his eyes wide and hands gripping on so tightly to the handle you could easily believe he was about to unwillingly fly off.

“What’s happened?” Reaching him and grabbing hold of his shoulders I could see the terror in his eyes.

“Behind the workbench.” He sputtered.
Shoving the radio into his hands I shoved past him and ran over to the workbench that sat near the corner of the room. Reaching the workbench I turned to see my brother still standing there now fumbling with the radio to call ‘medical’ and our supervisor (something we had been trained to do). I turned my head now that I was leaning over the wooden surface and that’s when I saw it.

A shirtless man in tattered jeans, no older than 25 but with deep wrinkles and ivory-white skin. Worst of all was the triangle that had been cut through his torso, all the way through. It wasn’t bleeding and in fact, had signs of healing somehow.

Suppressing my gag reflex I stumbled back, my brother's voice coming from behind me the room began to spin as the smell hit me and the image of the corpse burned itself into my mind. It was about then that I fell backwards into a standing toolbox, lucky really because it broke my fall. I had passed out and the last thing I remember was my brother swearing before calling out over the radio, and a distant sound of glass breaking from the warehouse.


The next day was uneventful, I and my brother talked about what we saw with some people from HR and were told that it seems like someone had snuck into the workshop after hours and managed to mangle themselves on a piece of industrial equipment. Honestly, this put both of us at ease and not wanting to discuss it any further we decided to just take it at face value. We even managed to get a few days of psychological leave to reset and get over that night.

One night the day before we were due to clock back in to work me and my brother decided to have a few drinks out in the nearby forest, a warm campfire keeping us company as we talked about old times. Eventually, the conversation would go to that evening.

“So what happened after I took the weak way out?” I asked filling a moment of silence.

“Oh yeah, so after you passed out the medics arrived within like two minutes where they figured out you had just passed out.” A little tipsy he was gesturing wildly with his arms as he spoke. 

“And the body?”

“So the body, yeah, they took a little look but honestly didn’t seem that interested, they were more worried about you and making sure you were okay.” He was now spilling the half-full beer in his hands as his hand swung excitedly around.

“Strange,” I muttered, taking a deep drink out of the beer in my hands.

“I guess they must have figured he was already dead so they don’t need to worry or something.” 

“Maybe.”

We quietened down and drank for a while as we stared into the slowly dying fire, only breaking the silence with the odd joke or comment about the nature around us.



We both went back to work with little issue, it became routine again after only a few days, but it was only just long enough for the memory of that night to fade before my final night at that place would occur.

Again we found ourselves working in one of the Facility's many warehouses but this one was different. Instead of an obvious warehouse or production facility, this place was almost like a labyrinth of moving mechanical walls that lead into fenced-off pens. Our job here was simple, one of the wall sections kept seizing during normal operation and the normal maintenance crew for this section came down sick. So with a set of unfamiliar blueprints and manuals for the walls we began.

It didn’t take long for my brother to figure out what we needed to do, I had been there longer but I guess a few more years of life experience made the difference when coming up with something unfamiliar. Toiling away in the dark he turned and began to hum gently in between the odd command. 

“I don’t think we have long to go.” He muttered while removing a large piece of cloth from the interlocking gears under the base of the wall's pivot point. “Just gotta get this out and we’re already done for the night.”

“Good.” I exhaled looking around the dark labyrinth of steel and wood. “I don’t want to be here longer than we have to.” 

It was then a low, pained moan began to emanate from somewhere within the building, growing in intensity for just a moment before failing off in a directionless echo.

Freezing I look at my brother. His eyes wide and hands ever now working more frantically he whispered just loud enough for me to hear.

“Look, can we just pretend that that was some sort of machinery cooling or an animal or something?” His voice rose in pitch as he attempted to squash any adrenaline that was now pumping around his system.

“Yeah man, just give that a good yank and we’ll call it a day.” I turned and began to place all of our tools back in the box save for a screwdriver we needed to screw the panel back on.

Suddenly out of the corner of my eye, I see my brother jolt back as the cloth now flung itself free of the gears, however, as soon as the gears were free they began to turn and grind, the wall not spinning on its pivot, separating us. 

“Hey, I’m stuck, the gears have caught my overalls and I am not getting out of this.” I heard his voice straining from the other side.

“I’ll find a way around just waiting there.” I ran down the newly formed corridor to my left trying desperately to reunite with my brother, if I’m honest while I was worried about him, I just didn’t want to be alone there.

Then I heard it.

It started as a familiar moan.

Then it was suddenly cut into by the terrified scream of my brother.

I broke into a sprint, all cautious about the suffocating darkness thrown out.

I turned what felt like a hundred corners to reach him.

Then I saw it.

A shirtless woman her eyes sunken and surrounded by heavily wrinkled, pale skin, and a triangle, cut out of her torso, revealing the section of wall behind her. 

My brother was at her feet, still caught in gears but his skull was caved in, blood surrounded the two as it dropped from his head as well as the woman’s fingertips. A moan now re-emerging from her perfectly frozen face as she looks away from my brother and over to me.

Her eyes were cold and lifeless and yet somehow revealed pain beyond anything else.

I didn’t know what I was looking at but I know my brother was dead and might be next. Fighting the urge to pass out I turned around and ran, god damn did I run. 


I didn’t even go home to get anything. My instincts to hit the road had hit full force. Whatever I saw that day wasn’t something the police could just sort out and I’m not convinced that this doesn’t have something to do with that secretive company, so I kept quiet until now.  To this day I don’t know why any of this happened but I can’t help but feel like just running and never looking behind may be the reason why I’m still kicking today.

Nowadays I own my workshop and work on bikes out of Florida, I have a wife and a few kids and possibly a grandchild on the way soon. I’ve never visited that place again and after a few years of my son talking me into it I just might go and visit that old town again, see if it’s still there and see if maybe there’s a headstone for my brother in the quaint cemetery in the town I remember.
