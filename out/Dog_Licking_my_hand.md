I used to work at a hospital and would come home to my apartment really exhausted. I lived with my dog at the time. After work I would come home, shower and go to bed. Usually, my dog would lick my hand while I’m a sleep. I didn’t mind it at the time. 

One night, he was barking at the ceiling. I thought to myself, “Why was he barking for no reason…..” Since, I was tried from work I told him to be quiet and he came back to lick my hand. This goes on for a couple of days. My dog barking and coming back to lick my hand. As the days go on I notice my dog in the corner and looking at the ceiling. Which was weird and also an odor that smells like rotten meat during the night. I didn’t pay attention to it since I was working 12 hours shifts and would come home burnt out from work. 

So, on one of my days off I decided to take my dog out for a walk. I thought maybe he needed a change of scenery instead of looking up at the ceiling in my apartment. While, walking my dog acted like a normal dog, playing fetch, running around at the park, etc. Then, all of a sudden he stopped, looked at me and smile. It wasn’t your typical doggy smile. It was a creepy menacing smile. I freaked out for a bit but maintained my composure. I’m a nurse so I seen some things in my life so I brushed it off. 

As we came home, he went back to his little cornered and stared at the ceiling. He didn’t want no food or water. I decided to make an appointment for my dog to go see a veterinarian but available appointments wasn’t until next week. So, I made an appointment for next week. After, making the appointment I went to shower. Kid you not I swear I hear someone talking to my dog while I was in the shower. I got out of the shower and saw my dog on my bed just looking at me. No emotions at all. I decided to hug my dog and went to sleep. 

It was around 3am my dog was licking my hand he usually does that. But, it was different this time it felt really damp and sticky. I got curious and decided to look at my dog. However, I saw my dog at the corner and staring at the ceiling. I thought “…who the hell is still licking on my hand.” It freaking stink like rotten meat. I pulled my hand into my cover and begged for everything to be fine. In the morning I woke up to my dog in the corner dead, his neck twisted backward with that creepy smile. I panic and called the police. Nothing was founded and a couple of days later I left that apartment and quit the hospital. Til this day I can still remember that feeling of being licked.
