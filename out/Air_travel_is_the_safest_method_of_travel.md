Airplanes are absolutely fascinating yet very complex machines. Behind every inch of them, there are meticulous engineering. They must be in harmony from the plane engine to the smallest screw. Even the tiniest parts of them can feel the neglience if they are not taken care of. Brilliant engineers are trained for such delicate machines so that airplanes can operate and serve the people to travel around the world.  
  
4 years ago I had graduated as a brilliant engineer aswell. After compulsory internship, I got a job in a small but reputable company. At first, my passion for aviation and airplanes was at the forefront. I didn't care about the workload, mobbing or low salaries. Every shift, I'd arrive first and leave last.  
  
I had respect for the company too. It was a company that started from scratch and became the best regional airliner. Also, they had trained many engineers and pilots before. The boss, Gage Woods, was much respected in the aviation world and loved by his employees. And second-in command, he had a snooty, snobbish son, Andrew Woods.  
  
You know airlines always care about looks. So that, we always had a lot of young and hot air hostesses hanging around the headquarters. It's not that I'm very handsome and they don't know my worth, but I was very unlucky with girls. Whenever I try to hit on some hot hostess I'd be rejected. I wouldn't push my luck too hard not to be called a perverted leech in the company.  
  
But Nola was different. She was hardworking, small-town girl. She wasn't the like other cocky girls who thought they were on the podium at companies corridors. I'm sure other stewardesses would sleep with the captains or Andrew to get a full time contract. But Nola wouldn't do that, she would always kept her modesty.  
  
I had daydreams often when I watch her at cabin crew rest room. I had started to dream of marrying her. We would have middle size apartment by the city center. After working hard and earn money, we would bought a big house at the countryside and live a modest life. For now, she is unaware of these plans. But I'm sure she'll love it when she hears it.  
  
The only obstacle was Andrew. Previous evening, at the annual company dinner, I caught his dirty glances to her. Bastard even had the audacity to ask her to dance. I was sure that she accepted just because she was kind and polite person. That piece of shit definitely planned to get Nola to himself by force. Why didn't he hit on other hostesses, Nola is mine and she knows this too.   
  
I overheard the chatter of the shift supervisors after dinner. Andrew was due to fly to Chicago at noon tomorrow.  
  
Today was the day. I had to talk with Nola and reveal my innocent intentions. We had a great future ahead us, as I dreamt before. I was completely sure of myself that she would approve of me. Having finished the shift. I caught her at ring waiting area. I kindly told her how much I loved her and my future plans with her. She seemed shock at first, my pure angel, but recovered quickly.   
  
*"I think you've mistaken me for someone else."*  said with her velvety voice. I was prepared because I knew it would happen. I offered her a water that has a tranquilizer to ease her mind. She didn't want to drink at first, but I used some persuasion, anyway, there was no one else but us. I carried her to my car laid her to backseat. She looked so innocent while sleeping, so I kissed her cheek. At drive back to home I was the happiest man in the world. I was happy because I had touched her, heck even kissed her. I was happy because I always dreamt to make her love of my life and now, we had a birght future filled with love.  
  
I was going to tell her about our wedding and ask how would our first holiday be like, tell her about my past and listen hers carefully. I was going to tell her my journey of gathering courage to talk to her and tell her how I saved her from perverted intentions of Andrew Woods. She was going to learn how I clogged the fuel filter of Andrew's airplane.  
  
*''Flight OC121 San antonio - Chicago exploded in midair for unknown reasons. A large number of firefighters were dispatched to the area that airplane has fallen.''* the radio rattled.  
  
I turned off the radio and enjoyed the silence for a bit. After 20 minutes of driving, we reached to my house. I carried her to my bed gently, finally we were alone. Since this was our first night I didn't want her to sleep alone so I laid next to her without waking her up. Then I heard two knock on my front door.  
  
*''Mr.Poole, Hello, Iâ€™m Officer Aiden. We got a call from someone who says they are concerned for your welfare and that you need help. Please open the door.''*  
  
Damn Andrew, he was dead and still messing with us. But how did they find us?  I was extra attentive and careful while sabotaging the plane. I had assured that there was no fingerprints or camera records. As I was drowning in stress, I noticed that the screen of the Nola phone was glowing. Last call was 911  
  
Nola wasn't slepping.
