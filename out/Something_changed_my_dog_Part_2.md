Well, the vet turned out to be a waste of time. They told me there was nothing they could do since he didn't seem to be physically hurt or altered in any way. All they did was refer me to an animal trainer and behavioral specialist. I decided to hold off on the trainer. If Max was still acting up in a couple days, I'd take him.

The second I opened the door to my house, Max bolted to the end of the hallway and into the living room. I chased after him, but he was gone. At this point, I couldn't even begin to explain Max's behavior. The only way out of the living room was down the hallway that he came from, so he couldn't have gotten out without crossing my view. I called out Max's name, but he never came to me.

I was sitting on the couch half an hour later. I had sat down after searching around the house for Max, but not finding anything. I had turned on the AC earlier, and I felt the breeze on my ankles from the vent underneath the couch. I noticed something... different, about the air. My AC was normally freezing cold, or at least gave me a slight chill. This air was uncomfortably warm and came in long gusts with breaks in between, rather than coming out in one continuous gust. I stood up from the couch and slowly bent down to look underneath.

Those eyes.

Those same fucking eyes glowing in the darkness, illuminating his gaping jaw and razor-sharp teeth. I didn't say a word, just grabbed my lighter and a box of cigarettes off the counter before I stepped outside. I flicked open the box with shaking hands. Empty. Of course, just my luck. I cautiously stepped back inside to grab my keys. The house was completely silent, aside from Max's ragged breathing that resonated from the living room. I quickly grabbed the keychain and scurried back outside, locking the door behind me.

I drove myself to the gas station, picked up a pack of cigarettes and started smoking one outside. I finished the first one quick and lit another, then another, and another, and another. I ended up chainsmoking the entire pack in about an hour and a half.
"Fuck," I groaned to myself, throwing the empty pack on the ground and stepping into my car. I felt disgusted with myself. I'd never smoked this much in my life, but I just couldn't calm the fuck down. No amount of nicotine could get those eyes out of my mind.

I started my car, not knowing where to go. I couldn't go back home after what happened. I couldn't go to my parents, what would I tell them? That I was scared of my own dog? They'd laugh my sorry ass out the door. Maybe my sister's house? She had a small place and a husband, but I wouldn't need to stay for long. Hell, even just being allowed to park in her garage would be enough for me. Just anywhere that I could feel safe. I picked up my phone, quickly dialing her number and clicking the call button.

"Hey, Sandy?" I said slowly, nervously looking all around me as if Max would just pop up out of nowhere.

"Yeah, what's up?"

"Okay, uh, this is gonna sound really stupid, but you need to hear me out."

"Okay?" Sandy replied in a confused voice.

"My dog's acting really weird. He won't stop hiding around the house and just... staring. All he does is stare at me and it freaks me the fuck out."

"Did you not, like, take him to the vet?"

"I did, they couldn't do anything. There's nothing physically wrong with him, he's just acting weird."

"Just get to the point."

"Okay. Can I stay with you for a little while? Or at least keep my car in your garage and sleep in there?"

"I mean, I don't see why not. You can sleep on the couch."

"God, thank you so much," I breathed a sigh of relief. I told Sandy I'd be there soon, said goodbye and hung up. I almost instantly hit the gas and got on the road. I was so eager to get away that I floored my car and started going 65 in a 45. I only slowed down when I hit a red light and almost rear-ended the guy in front of me.

Well, I'm sitting in front of my sister's house now. I feel creeped the fuck out so, like last time, I'm trying to finish this quick. I feel like I'm being watched. Anyways, I'll update again soon. Bye.
