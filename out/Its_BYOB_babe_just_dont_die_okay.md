The wind howled through the tree trunks that shouldered the forgotten path. It had a cold bite to it that was incredibly unforgiving to someone dressed as a slutty rendition of Frankenstein’s Bride. 

I pulled up the collar of my jacket, thinking it was entirely too chilly for October. Like a whisper of the winter that was soon to come. One that I wasn’t ready for in the slightest. 

Especially not in a mini skirt and heels.

I pushed through the underbrush despite the saplings that grabbed at my thighs and tore at my fishnets. My pink pumps sunk in muck and mire as I trudged through the patch of wilderness that lay adjacent to my backyard.

Nineteen years old and I still had to sneak out of the goddamn house to go to parties. Conservative parents were the plague of my existence. It was 2024 and they might as well still be puritans.

I reminded myself that it was just a few more weeks and I was off to college. The thought of living in the dorms was a poison apple to my parents, but to me a delicious promise of freedom. 

Headlights spilled across a clearing just past a row of honeysuckle to my left. EDM poured through the speakers and splashed against the yellow leaves overhead. 

“*Hey bitches!”* I cried as I bounded across a ravine and into the small gravel lot. 

Megan and Amanda screeched with excitement as I plopped into the back seat of the Range Rover. 

“About damn time girl!” Meg groaned as she spun out of the lot and onto the asphalt. 

“*Ugh I know.* My fucking parents man… I just can’t…” 

“Yeah honey, they really are *the worst…”* Amanda grimaced in the passenger's seat as she checked her makeup in the visor mirror.

“Maybe you should just kill them?” Meg snarked. 

“Ew, Meg don’t be such a bitch.” Amanda snarled as she powdered her nose. 

“No I mean, think about it, our social media following would *literally* explode since we were bestfriends with the killer… *oh officer, I had no idea she was capable of such terrible things…*” Meg fake sobbed for a moment and then cackled like a hyena. 

“Shut the fuck up, I’m not killing my parents. Besides, we’re off to State soon anyway.”

“*STATE, STATE, STATE, STATE!”* They chanted in unison, pumping their fists in the air. 

*They really were dumb bitches*, I thought. But they were *my* dumb bitches. I couldn’t help but smile at their stupidity and let my mind drift off to fantasize about my new life that was soon to come. 

Ten minutes went by as they bickered in the front seat and sang horribly to whatever song came on the radio. I rested my forehead on the window, watching as red lights turned green. The fog was thick over the town, making the lights bleed into small effervescent clouds through the mist. 

Rain began to drizzle causing neon drops to race down the glass. I rubbed my hands together as gooseflesh crept across my arms despite the heat pumping through the vents. The weather wasn’t cooperating with the spirit of slutty Halloween season whatsoever. 

I was just thinking how I wished that I’d chosen a costume with more clothing to it when we pulled into a parking lot. *Haney’s Grocery.* The LED sign cut like a beacon through the night, reflecting in puddles that gathered in at least a dozen potholes. 

“What are we doing?” I asked, leaning over the center console. 

“Need to score some drinks babe, it’s BYOB.” 

I shrugged and followed them out of the car. We ran as quickly as our heels would allow across the parking lot and smashed through the double doors at the entry. 

Amanda immediately spun around to a storefront window to check her makeup as Meg and I approached the liquor aisle. 

“How are we going to buy that?” I asked as she held up a bottle of Patron. 

“Hello? Fake-Id, *duh.*” Meg scoffed. 

She grabbed a jug of margarita mix and nodded for me to follow her to the front counter. 

The old man behind the counter looked over his magazine with a raised eyebrow as Meg placed the alcohol next to the register. 

“You girl’s old enough to buy that?” He grinned as he set aside his copy of JEGS. 

“Yes sir.” Meg beamed at him. 

“Can I see some ID?”

“Of course you can!” She giggled as she bent over just enough to allow her cleavage to hang out of her Cleopatra costume. Her tits were on full display, jiggling dramatically as she fished the ID out of the purse around her shoulder. 

The old man licked his lips as he took the square of plastic from her hand. 

I shuffled nervously, uncomfortable at the lust in his eyes. Meg didn’t seem to mind though. 

“Ah yes… twenty-two eh? Well. I was young once, about two hundred years ago.” He cackled as he handed back her ID. 

She laughed along with him, keeping up the charade of flirting. Even added a comment about how good he looked for being over two hundred years old to boot. 

Which gave him more to smile about. 

But that shine in his eyes… I didn’t like it. There was something cold to them. Something that almost threatened violence. It made my skin crawl.

“Thirty-eight dollars and fifty-two cents hunny.” 

Meg slapped two twenties on the countertop and gave me an eye roll after the man turned his back to open up the register. 

He was pulling out change when suddenly Amanda shrieked from the storefront. 

“*Oh my God he’s got a gun!”* 

I spun around just in time to see someone in a black hoodie smash through the front door with a sawed off shotgun in tow. 

“Leave the register open!” He bellowed as he pushed his way past Meg, pointing the barrel right in the old man’s face. 

“You don’t want to do this…” He whispered to the gunman as he put his hands in the air. 

“Shut the fuck up! Put all the money in a bag. NOW!” 

Meg and Amanda had scurried off to hide in the aisles, but I was frozen in place. My mind screamed for me to run but my body wouldn’t budge. I felt piss trail down my fishnets and warm the sole of my foot. 

The gunman forcefully shoved the barrel of the shotgun into the center of the old man’s forehead twice, causing his head to jerk back violently. It left a red ring just between his eyes. 

But surprisingly a smile crept across his face. For the life of me I couldn’t understand why, and it seemed neither could the man holding the gun. 

“I’m not playing around old-timer!” He racked a shell in the chamber to show he was serious. 

“But I love to play…” The voice coming from the elderly man now sounded deep and powerful.

The lights flickered and suddenly with a lightning fast movement the cashier snatched the gun from his hands and broke it into two pieces over his knee like it was a piece of kindling. 

“*Yo! What the fu…*” 

Then his hands clamped over the man's shoulders and with a mighty shove brought him to his knees. 

“Let me show you how I like to play.” The old man growled. 

I finally regained consciousness of my legs and started to peddle backward as the old man brought the gunman into a deep kiss. 

Blood trickled down their chins as the gunman muffled silent cries, struggling against the embrace. 

The old man pulled back his head, his eyes glowing yellow, and spat the man's tongue out from his mouth. It flew across the room and smacked me square in the chest. 

I screamed with terror as I slapped the hunk of meat away from me. My foot slipped in the blood as I spun to run and I went crashing into a wall of chips, bringing the entire shelf down to the floor. 

I turned over to see the old man smile at me, that same predatory smile he’d had earlier, but now his eyes glowed so brightly like two suns burning in their sockets. 

He turned back to the gunman who was now weeping and holding his hands over his ruined mouth. 

The bones in his jaw cracked as it became unhinged and widened enough to swallow the man’s head down to his shoulders. 

There was a scream, then an awful slurping sound as he pulled the man's face and scalp right from his body from the force of his suction. 

The monster swallowed the scraps of flesh as the body crumpled to the floor. His head now only a ball of porcelain skull and purple tendon. 

I was so overcome with fear that my mind went to a place of static and pure instinct took over. I didn’t know how but suddenly I was scrambling over the fallen shelf, kicking off my heels as I went, and then I was running. 

My feet smacked against the cold floors of the aisles as I sprinted towards the back of the store. 

I saw Amanda from the corner of my eye cowering behind boxes of cereal but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

The women’s restroom lay just ahead. I pounded my soles foreword to the promise of sanctuary among the porcelain. 

I flew inside, stopped my momentum against the sink and then spun around, slammed the door shut and locked it. 

Bile rose in my throat immediately. I barely made it to the toilet before I sprayed chunks of vomit across the seat. 

“*Fuck, fuck, fuck.”* I whispered and then began to weep.

Deep sobs welled in my chest until a scream pierced through the silence.

*Amanda.*

Muffled pleading and then more screaming permeated the restroom walls. 

Then a sickening wet sound and… silence once again. 

I held my mouth closed with a shaky hand, daring not to make a sound. 

For a moment there was nothing. Only me and the fear that felt like ice in my stomach.

But then blood. A pool of crimson slowly pooled beneath the door, swallowing the off-white floor tile. 

There was a gentle knock at the door, then a soft turn of the door handle from the outside. 

“*Oh little pig. Little pig. Won't you please let me in.”*

“FUCK YOU!” I shrieked.

“*Oh, now don’t be that way, I just want to play*.”

Another knock, louder now and then a harsh rattling of the door knob.

“*Your friend tasted sooo good, now I want to taste you. I can smell you. The sweet stink between your legs and the blood in your veins. Mmmmm.”*

The door rattled violently in its frame as he shook it. 

I looked around, no windows, no way to escape but wait… up… we go up.

The ceiling of the restroom hadn’t been finished. There was no drywall, only open framing with a good three feet of space before the roof parapet.

“*Let me in you fucking bitch!”* 

*SMASH. SMASH. SMASH.* 

The door slab splintered in the center as he smashed his fists against it.

I quickly stepped up on the toilet tank and scurried up into the framing, pulling myself up by a low hanging two-by-four. 

I drug my belly across the lumber as I crawled deeper into the bowels of the grocery store.

The sound of the door finally giving way and imploding inward was almost deafening. The primal shriek of frustration that followed was so loud I had to cover my ears. 

I slithered across beams as silently as I could until I reached the far wall. I followed the cinder block until I reached another opening over the stock room.

Carefully I lowered myself onto a pallet of dry goods. 

*“I smelllll youuuuu.”*

A cackling laughter rang out somewhere in the store. It sounded close. Too close…

Hot tears fell down my cheeks as I scooted around pallets and boxes. 

I didn’t know where he was but I knew he wasn’t far behind me. Biding his time. A sadistic game of cat and mouse.

But after rounding the corner a sweet salvation appeared in the form of a red glow. An emergency exit sign lit like a beacon of hope over a set of double doors. 

I broke out into a run and crashed my body against them. They budged an inch but then fell back into place. In my panic I hadn’t even noticed that they were chained shut and locked with a padlock.  

“*Oh little pig, where arrrrre youuu?”* 

His laughter sounded so close, just around the corner. 

I desperately searched for anything to break the lock as heavy footsteps fell nearby.

*God please…*

There. A hammer on the shelf.

I grabbed it and put two fingers in the shackle loop, pulling it towards myself to create tension and smashed the hammer over the side of the lock as hard as I could.

Over and over and over again.

I felt as if his hot breath were on my neck as I pounded on the lock, but I didn’t look back because if that were true I’d already be dead.

“*Come on… God dammit come on!”* 

Finally the pins let loose of the shackle and it popped open.

I quickly untangled the chains and dropped them to the floor. 

I felt fingertips graze the nape of my neck as I burst through the doors, causing screams to erupt from my throat as I ran faster than I ever had towards a light pole at the edge of the lot.

I swung my arms around the base and twisted my body to the otherside, foolishly hoping it would protect me from an attack. 

But none followed.

After a moment I peaked around the pole and…

“*OH MY GOD NO…”*

The old man held one side of the door open with a knobby, twisted arm as long as a tree branch. He’d at least doubled in size.

And in the other hand he held an outstretched hide. 

It was Meg's skin. 

She’d been flayed from scalp to shin. 

Her white nipple piercings sparkled beneath the neon band above the door frame.

He laughed as he shook her skin like it was a piece of bologna. 

I fell to my knees and wept as the monster draped her hide over his shoulder and turned back to disappear once more into the stockroom.

I cried until I couldn't feel anymore.

Then I sunk back into that place of static and slowly walked to the front parking lot.

I climbed into the Range Rover and dropped the keys from the visor.

I slipped the keys into the ignition but then paused after a motion caught my eye. 

The old man was back to his normal self now, just as we’d first seen him.

He was waving at me as he pushed a mop bucket.

A flash of yellow glow lit up his eyes only for a moment, bringing me back to myself.

The fear returned, creeping up my spine as I turned over the ignition and peeled out of the lot.

I sped, blowing through every red light that hovered  in the mist and didn’t stop until I was home.

———

The next day the police visited Haney’s Grocery after my parents had called them. I’d come home and broken down into hysterics and had to be sedated by paramedics after they called 911 due to my blubbering about murders and monsters.

In the morning I’d gotten my shit together enough to tell them what had happened, but they didn’t find any evidence of foul play in the entire establishment.

There were no signs of Amanda Reynolds, Megan Carmicky or an unknown gunman. 

They’d even met with the store owner, Michael Haney, and he said he’d never had an old man employed at his place of business that matched my description.

He’d claimed that the store had been closed early for Halloween so that his employees could enjoy the holiday. 

My story was picked up by the tabloids only after Megan and Amanda’s parents filed missing persons reports. 

“*Girl in mental hospital after claiming to see her friends murdered by a monster*.”

The rest of the town was suspicious that I’d had something to do with their disappearance. Murmurs of me being the killer soon became the local rumor. 

My parents would have moved away after onslaughts of harassment but they wanted to visit me at the mental rehabilitation center as much as possible.

I loved seeing them but wished my mother would stop crying when she saw me drool a little as a side effect of the medication.

No one believed me.

But that was okay, at least it was safe in here. 

And Meg got exactly what she’d wanted. Her social media following just hit 300k last week. 

It exploded.

Just like she had wanted.

And I didn’t even have to kill my parents.
