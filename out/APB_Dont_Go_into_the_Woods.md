Hello. My name is Joseph (You can call me Joe, everyone does) and I am a Police Officer in Maine. I will not specify where for many reasons. One of which being that I hope none of you come here and meet a fate you could otherwise avoid. I’m not one to mince words or beat around the bush so let me be blunt. What I am going to reveal here is going to sound unbelievable and little more than the ramblings of some dissociative mad man. I won’t blame a single one of you for having doubts. Believe me, I understand.

Only a month ago, I thought the same. Unfortunately reality saw fit to humor me with the revelations of malignant machinations and evils just beyond the veil of society. Deep in the dark of the trees from which humanity was birthed is something far more sinister than wolves or mountain lions. Something that I’m now convinced our ancestors built civilizations and carved away nature’s thorny grasp to repel. Or at least weaken in some fashion.

Most of what I have to present is not my own accounts and words, but that of a man named Warren Bracken. A local Hunter, survivalist and hermit after a fashion. Recently I came into possession of the man’s journals written in an old-school leather bound journal. Before last month on November 3rd, I at best knew the man passively and never knew him to pass more than the bare essential words along to his fellow man. Despite that, he wasn’t a total recluse. He had lots of local buddies who he’d take to all the best hunting spots and he was the go-to mentor for kids that wanted to learn the essentials of survival out in the forest. Despite all the stereotypical signs of being a black sheep of a society of people, locals still trusted him.

… I wish I had. I deserve what’s coming.

Before I get into Warren’s Journals, I need to lay out why they are important by establishing the foundation of all that has occurred and why I am posting things on the internet for so many to find.

On November 3rd just before sunset, the radio in my squad car started blasting.

“Dispatch to all Available Officers, 11-99 over on Deepgrove Road! I repeat, 11-99 over on Deepgrove Road!”

An 11-99 means, ‘Officer needs help.’ Without hesitation I clicked on my lights and responded to dispatch,

“Officer Thatcher to Dispatch, 10-17 I’m on my way over.”

I was the closest officer to Deepgrove and got there in less than 5 minutes. Deepgrove, like most of the town, is a very rural area made up mostly of back roads flanked by towering trees of Birch and Pine. Like a witch’s mangled fingers about to clasp. I saw another cruiser pulled over by a hiking trail entrance and pulled over quickly.

I hopped out, unholstered my nine millimeter and sharpened all of my senses. Heart racing, adrenaline pumping but training and situational conditioning keeping both from defining my state of mind. However that training and experience had not prepared me for the most jarring state of affairs that assailed me when I focused my senses outside the car.

Quiet.

I don’t mean just that there was no gunfire nor screaming. I mean it was as if I had passed through a doorway into a coffin already buried. There was no rustling of branches, snapping of twigs nor a light breeze rippling the leaves into a subtle orchestra of rustling. This, more than any domestic violence or active shooter call, put my hackles up. I waited and breathed for a minute, praying I would hear something break this dread covenant of silence in my stead. Unfortunately not.

It was just then I remember I needed to report my arrival to dispatch and move onto the trail to rendezvous with my fellow officer.

“Thatcher to Dispatch, I’ve arrived at Deepgrove Road. No initial contact with the situation nor the reporting officer. Moving onto the Hiking trail. What was the reported situation?”

A moment of radio fuzz and then the click of a connected signal.

“Dispatch to Thatcher. Corporal, we are currently unaware of the situation outside of the panic call from Officer Larren who has gone silent. Proceed. 10-30. More Officers on route!”

10-30: ‘Danger.’

“10-4 Dispatch, proceeding.”

I disengaged the safety on my pistol and held it at ready position with finger off of the trigger. I moved onto the trail, passing into the treeline like an insect being pulled into a trapdoor spider’s pit.

The trail was very steep and rocky, with roots sticking up everywhere. The fall leaves crunching beneath my boots the only accompanying ambience to my descent. I knew this trail. It was a popular place for teens and young adults because of a large Gravel pit just off of it about a half mile into the forest. Trying to think logically about what the situation was, I figured Officer Larren had responded to some complaint and gone onto the trail knowing as little as I did. Probably meeting a bear or something and in a panic called for aid.

If that was the case, maybe the bear got him. Larren was about as green as they come and was a city boy before transferring to a rural town like ours. Although, It was just as likely he ran from a tree falling and he fell and knocked himself out after fearfully pleading for assistance over his radio.

This was the most optimistic scenario I could come up with and I wish with every fiber of my being now that I had been right then.

It took me 7 minutes to work my way to the edge of the treeline that opened up to the gravel pit which was a steep slide down. Over thirty feet. But before I could even breach the trees to view the pit, I saw slumped limply onto his knees at the edge was Officer Larren.

I moved to him quietly but rapidly and looked him in his face staring out to the open clearing and the pit. He was alive, breathing and conscious. Yet there was a lifelessness to him. His eyes were bloodshot, sunken and full of tears still trickling down his young face. His mouth slightly agape, breathing hoarsely.

Despite this severe expression of despair and horror, he was otherwise hale and whole. No gunshot wounds or injuries of any kind. Despite knowing he was looking down into the gravel pit, my subconscious told me not to look. So I tried to draw Larren back to reality.

“Bob. Hey Bob, it’s Joe. I’m right here brother, please look at me. Just turn your head away and look at me.” I said as tenderly as I could. I figured what he saw down below had been some poor soul who had fallen or even driven their dirt bike off trail into a steep thirty foot crushing fall. Despite having seen worse than both such scenarios, something in me pleaded not to look.

Robert Larren continued to stare for a few more moments before saying through hoarse whispers that converted to a pleading wail, “All of them… All of them were jus- just… And why them? Why them!? ... So Young... So young...”

He still would not look away from what was down below. Thus, with phrased such as ‘All of them’ & 'So Young' being uttered, I ignored my instincts and peered into the abyss below. What I saw I will never be able to purge from my mind.

What my eyes were forced to define to my mind and soul would rewrite how I would forever associate the color red. Nevermore allowing me the ability to bask in the splendor of my wife’s favorite dress of a dark scarlet. Evermore the sound of breaking chicken bones or snapping of lobster shells at restaurants would bring me right back to that very moment in all its boundless horror.
