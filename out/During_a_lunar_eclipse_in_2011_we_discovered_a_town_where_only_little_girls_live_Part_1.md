"Dawn! Look! The moon is red!" My little brother Zack spoke with excitement, pointing at the sky.  
  
"Yeah Zack I saw it." I replied, completely unimpressed, my eyes riveted on my phone, as I drowned in the disappointment that has been my first ever gymnastics competition. The red moon just seemed to worsen an already horrible day. "The moon of doom." I quietly added.  
  
"Come on darling! Just your first time, I know that next time will be better." My father spoke, looking at me through the rear-view mirror while displaying his signature bright smile that he knew always made me feel good.  
  
"It won't happen if you don't take us home. Focus on the road and get us out of here!" My stepmother retorted, her growing anger slowly leading to an umpteenth argument. "Oh boy, where the hell did you take us to?" She added as soon as a strange and unfamiliar place came into view.  
  
Trying hard to remain calm, my father simply made a U-turn, hoping to get us back on the highway.  
  
"It will be okay Dawn. I know you'll win next time." Zack told me. The kind words and the sweet little voice melted my heart and forced a smile out of me.  
  
"Trying to comfort me like a grown up?" I asked him, still smiling. "You only five years old you little boy!" I added as I began tickling him.  
  
"You're only ten so we're both little." He replied between giggles.   
  
At that moment, a police car passed us, speeding towards the strange place we were trying to distance ourselves from. The word 'Policija' was written on the car and I could glimpse two officers having a heated exchange inside the vehicle.   
  
The strange occurrence comforted my father in the direction he took. However, after an hour drive at least, the only visible things were the sky, the path, with grass on either side and absolutely nothing else around, not even a hill. By that time, the parents were arguing, plunging us into an atmosphere much darker than our situation. They then decided to follow the police car and try to get help from the officers; therefore, we made our way back towards the strange place, which came into view rather quickly to our surprise. It was an old town.  
  
"Welcome toâ€”" My father tried reading the sign, but the name of the town was scratched entirely, and the words 'Sylvestra Sisterhood' was painted over, along with the letter 'S' followed by its reverse to form some kind of heart symbol. The town seemed abandoned, and all the buildings resembled constructions from the 40s or 50s. Most of them were in ruins as if bombings recently happened, but some still had electricity. Not one soul was outside, and we soon saw the police car seemingly abandoned, with both front doors opened, and awkwardly parked next to an alley.  
  
"Stay here." My father said as he stopped the car. He then stepped out and went to check on the police vehicle, hoping to see at least one of the officers. He then turned to us and shook his head. After that, he carefully proceeded into the alley to see if he can meet them nearby and disappeared from view. However, after around forty minutes, he was not back yet.   
  
"Where the hell did he go?" My stepmother spoke, trying to reach him on the phone. "No network, just great!" She added, her nerves put to the test. She then turned to my brother and I and asked us to remain in the car, comforting us with her nervous smile. She then stepped out of the car to investigate too, and just like my father she went through the same alley, and just like him, she did not come back, until...  
  
"Dawn?" I heard her calling from afar, piercing the overwhelming silence of the town.  
  
"Is it mommy?" Zack asked.  
  
"You heard it too?" I questioned.  
  
"Dawn please, come and help me, your father is hurt." She shouted.  
  
"Daddy?" I said, concerned. "Zack stay here and lock the doors behind me." I instructed.  
  
"No Dawn, I'm afraid. Don't leave me here!" He protested.  
  
"I'll be back. They're not far. We'll all be back, don't worry, I'll never abandon you. Be brave, my grown-up brother." I spoke with a smile before I got out of the car.   
  
"Dawn!" She shouted louder in distress.  
  
I ran, she kept calling, aiding me to locate them as her voice directed me through the alleys and the ruins of the town. I soon found myself completely lost, not able to recall which way I came from and felt anxiety rising inside of me. I looked around not knowing what to do, until I heard a last 'Dawn' coming from a building behind me from which I could hear faint squelching sounds. I turned around, saw its dark entrance contrasting with the lit alley I stood in. After creeping towards it, I pushed what was left of the door and gasped.  
  
Revealed by the street light, a man, surely one of the police officers from the uniform he wore, was lying dead on the floor as a hideous monster covered with scales feasted on his guts. The monster then slowly lifted its head and turned, revealing its glowing yellow eyes that instantly drowned me in a pool of terror.  
  
I took off running.   
  
Looking back at some point, I saw the creature emerging from the building, while kids I could not see giggled at the scenery. Clothed in fear, I ran to save my life, tears rolling down my face, not daring to imagine myself under the claws of that beast, until I fortunately located the car.  
  
"Zack! Zack, open the door!" I shouted, running towards the vehicle. "Zack?" I called when I reached the car and found it open.   
  
Zack was not there.  
  
Fearing the beast, I got inside and locked the doors, looking around to spot my little brother to no avail but instead, saw the monster emerging from the alley. I hid, hoping not to get found while considering my next action. My parents had disappeared and my little brother was somewhere out there, at the mercy of a monster that could as well be the end of my then ten years old self.  
  
What should I do?
