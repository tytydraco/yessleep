Friday last week I uploaded, “Why do I keep coming back for more?” to the nosleep subreddit. The post was removed. I received a message from r/nosleepMOD saying, *Hi* u/slush_pile_writer*, your post has been removed for breaking* r/nosleep*'s Unacceptable Horror Guidelines. DON'T REPOST IT TO* r/NOSLEEP*.*

That evening, I noticed the file had disappeared from my hard drive. I thought I had accidentally deleted it. I checked my reddit profile too but all traces of my post and the mod’s message were gone. I told myself it was a bug.

Later that evening my phone rang but the caller hung up when I picked up. I checked the caller-id and saw my cousin’s name next to the number. It was odd he’d do that but even more strange was that my phone’s background picture was gone. In its place a black screen. On the upper right, a watermarked, r/nosleepMOD. Had my account been hacked? Impossible. I never used reddit on my phone.

I texted a few friends to know if they’d experienced anything similar. With each exchange, my mind relaxed a little more until one of them texted, *wait who is this??* I thought they were joking and continued writing. They blocked my number. I wasn’t sure what had happened, unease creeping into my head again.

The next morning, I went to the local bar for breakfast. The barista waved and asked if I wanted the usual, then he handed me a coffee and croissant. The coffee cup he gave me had the name r/nosleepMOD printed on the side. Why was that name popping up again? I gulped the coffee but the caffeine never entered my system. The milk was rank so I spit it back into the cup.

When I went to pay, the cashier asked me if I was alright. I said I was fine, but she asked me to speak up. Twice I said yes, and twice she couldn’t hear me. I thought she must be pranking and waved her off, but as I was about to leave, the barista asked if I came to the bar often. *You look familiar*, he said. I hadn’t connected the dots yet, but it was becoming clear that something was off.

Freaked, I ran out.

In the lobby of my building I felt safer. I grabbed my phone and placed my finger on the unlock screen but couldn’t unlock the phone. The fingerprint wasn’t taking. I was trembling and thought that must have been the reason. When I finally managed to text my sister, the messages would go through but then they disappeared like I’d never sent them.

At that point, my unease was turning into fear. In the elevator, I scrolled through the pictures I had taken at my friend’s party the previous night. My mind craved a distraction, but the distraction it got was not what I had hoped for. In each picture, my face was smudged. In one I was downright deformed, my mouth downturned, like the pixels were melting.

I was now losing it. Ten minutes it took to get inside my apartment. I was able to unlock the door easily enough but my hand kept passing through the handle. Who WAS that mod?

I grabbed my laptop, wanting only to log onto reddit, regretting not having downloaded the mobile app like the platform had recommended. I jumped on the sofa but instead of falling on the comforting plushy cushions, I passed right through it(!!). What was reddit doing to people? Who exactly had I pissed off and why?

Once on reddit, I saw that my entire history had been deleted. An entire life now missing. Worse, like that life had never been.

I barely slept that night.

This morning I posted my experiences as a warning on r/nosleep. Twice the post was deleted, twice I was warned not to try this again.

Just two minutes ago, r/nosleepMOD sent me a screenshot. It had pictures of reddit usernames with strikethroughs, they’d been permanently banned.

I just recived a new message. Pictures of those same users, their true identities revealed through missing people posters.

…now my username in on that list, a strikethrough beginning to form.

I’m trying to call 911 but my hand can’t hold the phone. I’m typing this using a pencil, it’s thin enough to hold onto it. I scream but nothing comes out of my mouth. My hands move to my cheeks, or what used to be my cheeks. I probably look like The Scream.

I crawl under my desk. I press submit.

Please, remember me.
