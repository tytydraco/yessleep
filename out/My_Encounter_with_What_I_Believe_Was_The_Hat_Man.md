I was nine years old when this happened. My parents had recently divorced, and my sister and I were adjusting to a new living situation—weekdays with our mom in a small apartment, and Wednesdays and weekends with our dad. I mention this only because before the divorce, I had never experienced anything like what was about to happen.

At the time, I was terrified of the dark and had been diagnosed with night terrors. I refused to sleep alone. When I stayed at my dad’s, I always slept on the couch in the living room while he sat on the other couch, staying up until I fell asleep. He usually dozed off and went to bed around what I assume was 1 a.m., though we had no clocks or cable boxes that displayed the time.

The layout of the house was simple: a single story with a hallway leading to three bedrooms. If you stood in the hallway facing the living room, the kitchen and dining area were to the right, separated from the living room by a dividing wall. In the living room, one couch sat against the exterior wall, another against the dividing wall, with a coffee table between them and the television in the far left corner.

Almost every night, the same pattern unfolded. After the house had gone quiet and my dad had turned off the TV and gone to bed, I would wake up with a sudden, overwhelming feeling that someone was in the room—watching me.

And every time, I saw it.

In my peripheral vision, leaning against the dividing wall between the kitchen and living room, was a tall, solid black figure shaped like one of those plywood cowboy cutouts people put in their yards. He wore what looked like a fedora and always faced downward, motionless. He never changed positions. He never moved. He was simply… there.

For a nine-year-old already afraid of the dark, it was paralyzing.

Above the couch where I slept hung a stained-glass artwork—a red flower vase with curling vines, held together by twisted metal wires and suspended from a chain. For reasons I still don’t fully understand, that stained glass felt like protection. Every time I awoke and sensed the figure standing there, I stared up at the stained glass and refused to look away. I would keep my eyes fixed on it until morning light slipped through the blinds. Only then did I feel safe enough to let myself fall asleep again.

This went on for what felt like a year, though I was nine, so I’m sure it was shorter—maybe only a few months. But it always happened on Wednesdays, never on weekends.

Eventually, I became angry—not brave, just tired of being afraid. I convinced myself it had to be a shadow, maybe from a coat rack or something ordinary. One night, after waking up to find it in the same place yet again, I finally decided to confront it.

The moment I stood up and took a step toward it, the figure dissolved. It didn’t vanish suddenly—it dispersed, like smoke thinning into the air until nothing remained.

I screamed and switched on the lights, calling for my dad. I don’t remember anything else from that night. What I do remember is that after that evening, I never saw the figure again. And strangely, the stained-glass artwork was gone too. I never noticed its removal—it just wasn’t there anymore.

Fast-forward fifteen years.

I was in my dad’s attic, digging around for old snowboarding gear, when I found it—the stained glass. I had convinced myself over the years that maybe the whole experience had been imagined. But seeing that piece again hit me like ice water. I got goosebumps and couldn’t bring myself to touch it. I left the attic immediately.

Not long after, I mentioned the experience to my mom. She didn’t hesitate—she said, “Oh, you were terrified of that thing. We had to get rid of it.” She then told me something I had never known.

Apparently, when I was about four years old, the stained glass used to hang over a window in the dining room. One day, my mom walked in and found me standing in front of it, speaking to it. When she asked who I was talking to, I pointed at the stained glass and said, “The lady who made it, Mommy.”

What my mom never told me as a child was that the artist who created the piece—a close friend of hers—had passed away within a year of giving it to her.

Years later, I was randomly scrolling online when I came across a video discussing “The Hat Man,” a global phenomenon describing identical sightings: a dark human silhouette wearing a fedora, seen while dreaming, awake, or during sleep paralysis.

The description matched exactly what I had seen when I was nine.

And for the first time in years, I realized I had never truly forgotten him.
