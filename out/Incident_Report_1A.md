THE CHERNOBYL RUSTED DOOR

This report follows team Epsilon-Alpha, Team leader Jackson [REDACTED].

The last team that went to the Chernobyl power plant never returned, so we where dispatched to the plant. When we got there we searched for the missing team. That is when we found a rusted door the seemed out of place. What made it stand out was the fact that it was open.

Me the the 5 other members in my team slowly made our way down the long staircase. The air grew more heavy and colder as we went deeper. When he got to the bottom we found a long corridor with several blast doors. Some of them where completely destroyed, and blood was everywhere. 

We slowly made our way down the corridor. We soon came across a blast door that was covered in semi-fresh blood. When we entered we found the squad leader of the missing team. He had a long note of what happened that was sent in to HQ. 

We continued to look around the underground facility. We came across the lab the Squad lead wrote about. There we found many recordings.

Man 1: The portal device is almost done.

Man 2: This is a turning point in history.

*Alarm*

Man 1: Something is not right!

Man 2: Something is coming through the portal. 

*Screams*

We played many recordings. Most of them where normal. While that one was not. We continued to look around and than we heard the most ear wretching scream. Whatever made that scream was down the corridor we just came from. 

We all turned around and shown our lights on our rifles down it. That is when we saw it. A creature with long arms a claws. It was covered in blood. It's long teeth was stained with blood. Shivers when down my spine when I layed eyes on it. 

The creature got on all fours and ran like a mad-man at us. Before we could even do anything it had already put its large hand through one of my guys stomach. I lifted up my rifle and opened up on it. 

I emptied my entire magazine into the creature, and it did nothing. It was as of I was shooting it with an airsoft gun. Before I could reload the creature has already killed 3 of my men. With 3 of us left we took off deeper into the facility. As we ran I could hear the creature running down the corridor as well. 

I hear another man scream and than the last. I ran and ran until I made it back to the lab. I didn't have enough time to stop because the creature was right behind me. I ran until I got back to the stairs. After I got to the stairs I turned and saw the creature. It was stopped just before the first step. 

My guess is that it had never been up the steps. I took this opportunity to throw a granade at the creature. When it went off the creature just stood their. It than sprinted towards me. I turned and booked it to the door.

I made it to the door, and ran towards the town of Priyat. The creature followed me. I ran towards a building and closed the door. I sit here making this audio recording. This may be my last time I ever see my family again. If you find this please tell my family, I love them.

*Sound of door busting open*

*Creature's scream*

*Jackson's scream*

*Sound of wet meat being chewed on*
