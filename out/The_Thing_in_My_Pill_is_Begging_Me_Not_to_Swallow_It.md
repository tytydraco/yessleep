Last night, under the harsh bathroom light, I saw it. Just holding one of my little white pills, like I do every night. Pressed against the inside of the gel cap. A face. Tiny. Insect-sized, but a face. Eyes wide with terror. Mouth open in a silent scream. Not a bug. Wrong angles. Like a coal sprite shoved into a pill. 

  

I dropped it. *Tink* on the tile. Then it squealed. High-pitched, wet, like a mouse dying. Flushed it fast. The smell stuck around, burnt caramel mixed with something sharp and nasty, like fear-sweat. 

  

Skipped my dose this morning. Big mistake. Dr. Armitage wasn't kidding. My head feels like it's cracking open. Hands won't stop shaking. Stomach churning like spoiled milk. Every little noise scrapes my nerves raw. Called him, voice trembling, told him about the face. He brushed me off. "Stress hallucinations, Reid. Withdrawal symptoms. Take your meds. Be rational." 

  

Rational? With that thing staring out of my pill? The burnt sugar smell was still faint in the bathroom air. I couldn't bring myself to open the bottle all day. 

  

Now it's dark. My head is pure agony. The withdrawal is winning. Sweating like crazy even though I'm freezing. Shadows in the corner look too thick. 

  

And the bottle. On my nightstand. *Rattling*. Not pills rattling. Scratchy. Desperate. Like tiny claws on plastic. I grabbed it. It felt unnaturally warm. Held it to my ear. 

  

Silence. Then... *thump*. A tiny, muffled knock. Then another. And another. Frantic. And underneath... crying. Faint, muffled sobs. Coming from inside. My pills are sobbing. 

  

The burnt sugar smell hit me hard, coating my hand, thick in my throat. Rational? RATIONAL? 

  

White-hot pain lanced behind my eyes. I groaned, curling up. Oh god, it hurts. Need it to stop. Need it. 

  

Hands shaking bad, I fought the child-proof cap. *Click*. The smell punched me, sickly sweet burnt sugar and pure animal panic. I tipped one small white capsule onto my sweaty palm. 

  

It was warm. Body-warm. And it thrummed. Like a tiny, terrified heartbeat trapped inside. 

  

I lifted it close, squinting in the weak moonlight. The face was clearer. Much clearer. Little multi-jointed limbs scratching at the gel prison. Pinprick black eyes locked onto mine, pure horror. Mouth gaping wide in a soundless scream.

  

Bile burned my throat. Almost dropped it. The headache screamed, drowning everything else out. Take it. Swallow it. Pain stops. Shaking stops. Breathe again. 

  

But the face... begging. Pleading silently. Don't. Please. Don't. 

  

The bottle in my other hand rattled. *BANG-BANG-SCRATCH*! Violent shaking. The muffled crying became a chorus of tiny, shrieking wails. 

  

My hand jerked. The pill almost fell. Tears blurred everything. So tired. So scared. Skull felt like cracked glass. 

  

I raised the pill towards my open mouth. The tiny face inside pressed frantically against the gel, distorting, pushing away. 

  

The smell filled my nose and my mouth. Burnt sugar, raw fear. 

  

Lips parted. 

Capsule on tongue. 

Tiny thing frozen in silent, ultimate terror. 

Agony screaming through my skull. 

  

Do I swallow?
