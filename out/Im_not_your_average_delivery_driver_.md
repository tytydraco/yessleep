I've always been a bit of a try hard.  I don't know why.  Even as a young child, I was a bit of teacher's pet, with my freshly sharpened pencil and my hand waving in the air at every question she asked.  I know you're probably judging me.  Hell, I'm judging me.  I've always been jealous of those oh so cool people with no fucks to give.    I just can't.  I CARE what Carol from accounting thinks of my new haircut and what is written in my performance report.  The first half of my life, this quality brought me lots of success.  I always excelled at school and I excelled in the corporate world next.  

I had my life all planned out; the coziest little version of the American dream you ever saw.  I seemed to be on track: high paying career; handsome, attentive husband; three beautiful and intelligent children and all in the right zip code with the right resume.  That all ended in a single moment when a drunk driver crossed the line and killed my husband.  

Grief, three children still counting on me, and a new and worsening bout of insomnia all caused me to get my first negative performance review.  A two week cycle of us giving each other Covid got me my first write up.  I was fired for attendance points when my youngest fell on the playground at school and broke her leg.  I got a job in the same field but it came with a 30 percent pay cut.  That, after losing my husband's income, made us have to significantly downsize.

The new apartment was in a bad neighborhood and only had two bedrooms.  I slept on the couch in the living room.  Even with cutting our budget until it bled, I was still short at the end of every month.  I started driving for door dash at night just to keep food on the table.

Even for the pathetically low or non existent tips, I was still a try hard.  That shit is hard to break.  I kept my acceptance rate perfect, 100 percent.  Every delivery complete.  Every special request filled.  No one cared.  There was no performance review, no incoming raise; it's just how I am.  

Well, no one cared except one strange old man who ordered a pizza every Tuesday night. Each week, he'd ask to see my stats and he'd marvel over them.  He'd assure me each week that none of his other drivers had such fine numbers.  Because he was so interested, I'd often share little anecdotes from my deliveries though the stories were not very exciting.  He was creepy and there was an uncomfortable and musty odor that hit me in the face every time he opened the door.  I should have just handed over the pizza and left but I was just too caught in my people pleasing ways.

One week, he texted as soon as I picked up the order and asked if I could just do one little errand for him in addition to the pizza.  Even though I was swearing the whole drive, of course I did it.  I didn't even ask for extra money.  The next week the request got bigger.  Soon, he'd have me picking up a ranch sauce from pizza hut to dip his pizza from donatos in and could I swing by the grocery store and pick up some soda, the pizza place charges too much for a two liter he said.  Sometimes, this asshole even shorted me a dollar or two from my side errands.  Still, I always did it and delivered with a big grin and a thank you for the privilege of being his doormat for a couple bucks.

Each week I told myself this was the week I tell him no.  Each Tuesday night ended with me beating myself up for failing.  This week's order came with three unscheduled stops, one to collect his yappy Chihuahua from the groomers.  His dog wouldn't walk up the three flights of stairs to his apartment door so I had to carry him and the order.

I was panting and hot and sweaty as I knocked on the door.  The door opened and I awkwardly thrust forward the dog before glancing up.  The man in the doorway was most assuredly not the same man I'd been delivering pizza to the last six months.  He was elderly with a grayed out complexion.  He was long of face, long of body, long of everything.  Each finger was an awkward looking four joint affair that didn't make sense.   I'm fairly sure his feet pointed backwards.  It kinda hurt to look at him, especially when your brain would note a detail like one of his eyes was bleeding.  If ever was the time for running it was now but all I did was plaster on my most people pleasing smile and asked if he ordered a pizza in my best customer service voice.

He invited me in.  Oh, I know better.  EVERYONE knows better but my feet shuffled along and soon I was inside.  He very carefully dusted off a chair for me with a frayed, gray handkerchief and told me to sit.  I did, desperately trying not to notice my former client was currently sitting at his kitchen table with his throat slit bleeding into a crystal jar.  I'm pretty sure he was already dead, pretty sure.  

The man, or creature, or whatever he is started asking me questions.  I didn't know what to do with the pizza so I just sat there with it burning my thighs and filling the air with the scent of grease and pepperoni as I answered them.  Of course, I answered him.  You would've too.  But much to my writhing disgust, I was answering eagerly.  Yes, I do consider myself a team player, I assured him, even adding examples of how I handled an issue from my corporate job.  My strongest qualities are hard work and excellent time management.   I even listed my extracurriculars from high school when asked.  

I didn't know what he was interviewing FOR but I knew a job interview when I heard one.  I kept piping up after each question, making sure he knew I was exactly the right person for... whatever it was.  I think I even nailed the question of why I wanted the job.  I explained that I always had a passion for non traditional work environments and loved to work with people from all backgrounds.

The interview was easier than the handshake he offered me with the job.  It hurt.  My left ear still bleeds a little occasionally when it rains.  Still, it's not even close to all bad.  I get a company car that never needs fuel.  I get four weeks of vacation time a year and twelve days of sick leave.  My retirement plan is looking healthier than it ever has.  I quit the corporate job after a week.  Much more growth potential in this field.  I've already been promoted!  Being a delivery driver might not be the most glamorous job but I get compensated for mileage and the commute to hell to deliver the souls is always a nice bonus.  My last performance review said I was a real go-getter.
