Chapter 1 — Arrival at Echo Station
The shuttle’s descent into Mars Echo Station was silent, too silent. Lieutenant Aaron Vey’s squad expected bustle, but the docking bay was deserted. The air smelled of ozone and burnt copper. Emergency lights pulsed amber, casting shadows that seemed to move on their own.  

Inside the labs, they found shattered containment cylinders. One still held its occupant—a humanoid figure with ember‑glowing eyes. It broke free, slaughtered Corporal Jensen, and vanished into the walls. Black ichor seeped from steel seams, pulsing like veins. A distorted voice whispered over comms: “You shouldn’t have come.”

Chapter 2 — The Descent
The squad pushed deeper. They discovered logs referencing Black Horizon Protocol—a classified experiment merging quantum gateways with bioengineering. The scientists had attempted to weaponize dimensional rifts.  

The deeper they went, the more reality fractured. Hallways looped impossibly. Doors led back to the same rooms. Faces pressed against walls, mouths opening in silent screams.  

Then came the first portal chamber. A ring of machinery hummed, its core glowing with impossible geometry. Within, shadows writhed like living things. Sergeant Kade approached—and was dragged screaming into the light. His voice echoed from nowhere: “It’s inside me.”

Chapter 3 — The Survivors
They found survivors—two scientists, pale and trembling. Dr. Mira explained: “We opened the gate. Something answered.”  

She described creatures that weren’t demons in the religious sense, but entities feeding on fear, reshaping flesh. The experiments had birthed hybrids—soldiers fused with infernal parasites.  

One survivor convulsed mid‑sentence. His skin split, revealing bone and sinew that twisted into claws. He tore through the squad before being incinerated. Mira whispered: “They’re not just here. They’re learning us.”

Chapter 4 — The Invasion
The station erupted. Alarms blared, lights died, and the walls themselves tore open. From the rift poured horrors: skeletal beasts with molten cores, insectoid swarms with human faces, and towering figures cloaked in flame.  

The squad fought desperately, but ammunition barely slowed them. Vey realized the creatures weren’t attacking randomly—they were herding survivors toward the central reactor.  

There, the truth emerged: the reactor had been converted into a gate stabilizer. The Black Horizon Protocol wasn’t containment—it was invitation. The scientists had built a beacon, and Hell had answered.

---

Chapter 5 — The Betrayal
Dr. Mira revealed her role: she had designed the stabilizer. But she wasn’t trying to stop the invasion—she was trying to transcend humanity. “They offer evolution,” she said, eyes glowing faintly.  

She activated the reactor, opening the gate fully. The canyon outside split, revealing a landscape not of Mars but of endless fire and bone.  

The squad turned on her, but she transformed—her body elongating, skin peeling into obsidian plates. She became the first Ascendant, a hybrid commander of the invading force.

Chapter 6 — The Black Horizon
Vey, wounded and desperate, led the last survivors into the reactor core. They planted charges, hoping to collapse the gate. But the Ascendant pursued, whispering promises: “Join us. You’ll never die.”  

The battle was apocalyptic—rifles against claws, grenades against flame. One by one, the squad fell. Vey faced Mira alone, her voice echoing in his skull.  

He triggered the charges. The reactor imploded, sucking the gate inward. Mira screamed as her body was torn between dimensions. The canyon collapsed, burying Echo Station in rubble.

Chapter 7 — Epilogue: Transmission
Weeks later, a salvage crew intercepted a signal from beneath the canyon. It was Vey’s voice, distorted: “Black Horizon Protocol complete. We are inside you now.”  

The transmission spread across networks, infecting systems with strange code. Screens flickered with faces pressed against glass. And in the silence between static, a whisper: “You shouldn’t have come.”
