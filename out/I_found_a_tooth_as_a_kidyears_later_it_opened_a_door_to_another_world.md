I moved back to my old family home to focus. It was the kind of place where the silence pressed down around you, tucked deep in the woods and far from anything that could distract me. I figured it would be perfect place for finishing the textbook l'd been dragging my feet on, the quiet and isolation giving me the push I needed to finally get it done.

For the first couple of weeks, it worked. The house creaked in all the same ways I remembered from childhood, and if I ignored the dust and peeling wallpaper, it almost felt comforting.
Everything was fine until a familiar smell was permeating the air. It was faint at first, like a whisper of something on the edge of my senses.

A sweet smell but eggy a bit. It didn't smell rotten, exactly. It smelled... fresh. Like meat, raw and wet, hanging in the room.
It reminded me of my old butcher shop, where I'd spend hours surrounded by carcasses, cutting and cleaning until the smell of it worked its way into my skin. I actually never minded the smell. But this? This was different. There was no meat in my house...
I wrote it off as phantom smells, like that thing where your brain summons smells from your memory. I haven't butchered anything in a long time, certainly not recently and I was the only one at this house for over a year.

Parosmia—Memory smells. I think it's called. But some part of me wasn't convinced, because the smell didn't fade. It got stronger.

I recalled of my days back at the butcher when I lived here, late nights, knives gleaming under fluorescent lights. I saw something caught in the meat—a tooth. Jagged.
Too big to be human, but not quite animal either.
Like a long-rotten fang, green and yellow with weird purple thin tendrils where the roots should be.

That night as I lay asleep, I dreamt of the butcher shop. This time it was littered with buckets of blood, bubbling over and spilling onto the floor. Purple tendrils were snaking out of the buckets, growing thick and veiny-ready to burst at any given moment.

And then a deep, loud rumble sound followed by squelching, and then I saw it, standing there staring at me. A tall, lanky figure as skinny as a baby, so tall its head was hitting the ceiling, dark sunken eyes, long fingers with claws at the end of them, wearing a red striped shirt with jeans and tattered sneakers. It was frantically trying to claw at me in desperation, shaking. But its arms were being weighed down by some mysterious weight, being kept at the height of its hips. The more it struggled, the more it made these jerky like movements that were so fast it was like someone clicked fast forward. Still unable to lift its clawed hands above its waist, it swayed back and forth, frustrated, and then behind me.

—Another squelching noise and bursting made me turn my head to see that there was its twin behind me. This one looked completely identical, except different clothes. It was also clawing at the air, its movements jerky, but when I turned back to the first one, it had gotten closer. Too close. I realized something then-if I didn't look at them, they could move. The second I turned away, they could get to me. I didn't have time to test it, though.

The rumbling got louder, when they spoke it sounded like nothing l've ever heard, like low and rumbling deep in their stomachs, an echoing voice, “Meat Mookie.”

I woke up gasping, drenched in sweat, but the voice didn't stop. "Meat. Mookie." It sounded like it was right there in the room with me.

It had been a long couple of days so far and I hadn't even started work. I figured maybe it would be a good distraction to all this craziness.

I could set up shop, brew some coffee, and pull an all-nighter and sleep during the morning and day. Surely my dreams would be friendlier during the day. At least that was my logic.

As I was walking back into the kitchen with my coffee mug, underneath the archway leading to the living room, I took note of the seam so as not trip over it like I always do.
Even with the smell hanging in the air all night I was able to get some work done and decided to call it quits at 3:45am. I was out like a light.

My eyes stirred open at the brightly lit room.
One eye made out two lanky figures hovering over me, I tried screaming but nothing came out. One eye could see them perfect, the other eye was in the real world with nothing there. As soon as they saw I was awake they started slashing away at me with their long fingers with bladed hands. The pain was excruciating. I begged and begged for them to stop until suddenly I got a burst of energy and bravery, almost like a feeling of being shocked by a defibrillator. In an angry growling voice I told them to fuck off and I jolted back into reality. I bolted upright searching the room for any sign of them. 

Nothing.

Later on the day it got weirder and this is what made me fear for my sanity.
As I crossed the archway being careful not to trip over the seam, I saw a slab of meat, perfectly the size of a forearm laying seamlessly against the wood. Like it was part of the house, I wouldn't have noticed it if I didn't always look at the floor under the archway.

I grabbed my keys and left immediately. I called a friend who lived locally and asked her to come stay with me to prove to me that the smell wasn't there and that this was all in my head.

She bugged me little about it, called me a city boy. I laughed it off and promised her l'd make her some cabbage rolls. The kind with tomato sauce that her grandma used to make. I could practically hear her beaming over the phone.

She said, "If this is an excuse for you to finally see me then I guess l'll take it."

When I arrived home the meat was gone-a part of me was relieved but the other part was sad for my mental health.

Sarah arrived at the house around 8 PM.
Cabbage rolls were ready. They were golden brown-they were perfect with just enough salt to enhance all the flavours. There's just something about salty cabbage, or is that just me?

Sarah, gave me a big hug, "It’s been a long time, buddy, she glanced up at me and slowly backed away, wow you’re… big—bigger, I mean larger,” her eyes were like cute round saucers. She still had the same style, her large flannel shirt hanging loosely over a regular shirt and some jeans. Kind of that classic little converse look, but older. I guess things move slow in small towns, I on the other hand was pretty “classy” compared to my former self, I didn’t own regular shirt anymore, just button ups and sure some flannel maybe. She smelled like coconuts. A welcoming smell in comparrison to what l've been smelling lately.

The evening went perfect and we were all caught up. Just as things were getting a little flirty after several glasses of wine each, I told her I had to go to the bathroom,
"Don't fall asleep on me now."

She went to go sit on the couch, a small smirk playing on her lips. “You know,” she said, “you used to hate cabbage rolls. My grandma practically had to force-feed you.”

I laughed, shaking my head. “Yeah, well, people change, Sarah. Clearly.” I looked down at myself playfully back. 

She tilted her head, studying me for a moment before adding, “Your brother would’ve gotten a kick out of seeing you now. All grown up and…” She paused, her smirk softening. “Handsome.” A grin pulled at my lips. 

“Guess it runs in the family, huh?” 

Sarah smiled and curled up on the couch underneath a blanket.

As I was washing my hands finishing up in the bathroom, I looked in the mirror, and I swear I could hear that rumbling again, the mirror was quaking ever so slightly, I leaned towards it for a better look as I swore it sounded like a tuning fork had been hit—And that's when the smell started again, I nearly burst out the door to tell her,
"See! There’s a smell! Can you—” But no one was there, my heart sank. What have I done? I searched frantically yelling for her over and over. 

***

The officer leaned forward, pen tapping against the notepad. "Alright, so what's your relationship to Sarah? Any history there? " 

"Yeah... I mean, a long time ago, we had a thing. Nothing serious, though. Then-well, my brother came into the picture. " The officer nearly scoffed and raised an eyebrow, 
I froze, realizing too late how that might sound. 

"Wait—no, no, it's not like that! I mean, yeah, l was upset back then, but that was years ago. I got over it. It's not—I didn't..."
My voice trailed off as the officer's gaze grew sharper.

The officer leaned back slightly eyeing me suspiciously, “Well, Sarah’s pretty forgetful, right? She probably had to rush off for an emergency or something. I’m sure she’ll come back for her phone later.”  

"Look," I said desperately, "My brother... he passed away. After that, Sarah and I stayed friends. There's nothing weird or bad here, I swear, this was a lifetime ago."
The officer, whose name tag read "Ola," scribbled a few more notes before looking up at me. 

I laughed and shook my head, this is futile. Small town cops, what can I expect right? If anything did happen to her from his point of view I would be to blame. 

“Well, I get why you’d be worried. It’s better to be safe than sorry, right? 

I tried to wrap things up with him so I could do my own searching. “I just don’t think Sarah would leave without saying anything. It’s not like  her.” I shot him a look, the kind that didn’t even need words to say, Are you serious?

"Alright," he said, his tone even but firm.
"Here's what we're gonna do. I'll send someone out to check around the area, see if anyone's spotted her. In the meantime, l'd like to take a look around your house-standard procedure, just to rule out anything we might've missed". I nodded reluctantly. Maybe I shouldn’t have pushed him too much. I wanted to find Sarah as much as anyone, but the thought of the police poking around my house made me uneasy. I needed to fix this. It's just I had to report her missing to the police, it was the right thing to do.

***

I let Officer Ola in, I kept one ear on the officer's footsteps, but my mind was elsewhere. The tooth. I hadn't thought about it in years, but now, I wondered-could it still be in my old childhood room? Slipping away under the pretense of finding something, I headed down the hall and opened the closet in my room. I scanned the shelves and floor until I caught eye of something in the darkest corner at the top left. There it was. The tooth. But it wasn’t alone. 

Surrounding it was a black, goopy, sponge-like mess, tendrils extending out at unnatural angles and hooking into the tooth’s root. The air reeked of rot and decay, an almost sour scent that made me squeeze my eyes shut for a moment. 

The mass was unsettling—big enough that a baby could crawl through it—and i couldn’t shake the feeling that it had something to do with the creatures. A portal, maybe.  

Whatever it was, I couldn’t just leave it there. I grabbed a socket wrench and carefully used it to pry the tooth from the mass. As it came loose, the tendrils recoiled, retreating into the tooth itself as though alive. I barely breathed as I carried the tooth to the bathroom sink, careful not to let the foul-smelling goo touch me. Once there, I rinsed it off, scrubbing it clean under the water. When the putrid smell finally faded, I held it up to the light, and for the first time in years, I touched it with my bare hand. 

Meanwhile, I could hear Officer Ola’s footsteps crunching in the backyard, oblivious to what I was doing. Thankful for the officer's distraction.

As soon as I touched the tooth with my bare hand, my vision become cloudy, and the world around me dissolved into a foggy, spinning haze. Everything blurred and churned, leaving me dazed and disoriented. 

The creatures began communicating with me in their strange, alien way—not with words, but through feelings, impressions, and flashes of shape and color that swirled in my mind. Their thoughts weren’t speech, but a kind of visual, gestured telepathy I could only barely comprehend.    Through this chaotic exchange, I began to finally understood their message. 

They were grateful for “The meat,” and with a mounting sense of horror, I realized they meant Sarah. They explained that her flesh wasn’t just food—it was essential, acting as a key to bridge their dimension and mine. Without it, they couldn’t travel back and forth. But now, they admitted they didn’t simply need it; they wanted more. They liked the taste, savoring it and rationing it, and they planned to bring others of their kind through the portal. 

So they needed more resources—and they had decided I would be the one to help.    They reminded me that this connection between them wasn’t accidental. My mind watching, yanked to the day I’d found the tooth in the butcher shop, how I’d kept in my pocket, and how I’d unknowingly slept with it in my pocket at night, you see, I was out drinking with Sarah after work and passed out in bed immediately upon entering my room. 

So that night, while I’d been unconscious, the tendrils of the tooth had crept out, sinking into me and injecting their interdimensional energy into my very being. From that moment onward, I’ve been tied to them, a telepathic link I had never understood until this point.    

My chest tightened as I processed their demands and the realization that Sarah was alive—but only as long as I cooperated. If I refused, they wouldn’t waste time on me. They’d simply find someone else to fulfill their needs, which meant well... 

There was no threat, no malice in their tone. Just cold, calculated indifference. A very familiar feeling. 

I realized I had only one chance to stall for time while figuring out a way to save Sarah. “If I’m going to help,” I said, projecting my thoughts carefully, “I need to understand your dimension. 

Let me see it—to learn how it works.”    

The creatures paused, then agreed, explaining that I was too large to pass through the portal as it currently existed. Instead, they planted instructions directly into my mind, vivid and searing. I felt the intricate details—an elaborate setup involving cameras, lasers, and bizarre configurations—burn into my memory. The complexity of it all was overwhelming, yet impossible to forget, as though it had been etched into the fabric of my thought.

I don’t even know how to describe how my head feels right now. Not only after what they planted in there but also—It’s like my once dull, predictable life has twisted into something surreal. Part of me feels a strange thrill I can’t ignore, but that’s buried under something heavier—fear. Fear for Sarah. I have to find her before it’s too late. I’ll keep you updated, feel free to doubt me. To think I’m crazy. But until I find her, none of that matters.  What would you guys do?

Hey everyone, I know this hasn’t reached a lot of you yet, and i’m not sure if it will, but l’m here and I need to see this through. If anything this is for Sarah and in case I don’t come out of this the same. Feel free to give me your thoughts if you have any.
