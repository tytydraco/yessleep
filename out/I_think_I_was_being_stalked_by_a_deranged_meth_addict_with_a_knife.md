This happened about 2 years ago when I was house sitting for my parents. I’ve got an old beat up car in their back yard I’ve been trying to get running for a while now, so staying at their house for a weekend was a good excuse to work on it. When I got there it was about 10pm and I went out to the shed to get my tools ready for the next morning. When I opened the door to the shed I was hit with a wall of cigarette smoke. Not the actual smoke, but the distinct smell. Nobody in or around my parents house has smoked cigarettes in years so this spooked me quite a bit and I decided to just wait until morning to go out there. (For context, this shed is 2 stories and has a covered concrete patio on one side at ground level, perfect for working on a car, lawn mower, whatever.)

Morning came along and I went out to my parents large 2 story shed and smelled stale cigarettes. Again, nobody smokes so it was strange. It was daylight so I wasn’t so nervous to go in there but I was still a bit spooked. I’m a 6 foot tall, strong military veteran, so it takes a lot to scare me. I was terrified when I found cigarette butts on the second floor of the shed, but there were no people so my smooth brain decided to shrug it off. 

I started working on the car and spent all day on it. I’ll spare you the details cause you probably don’t care, but it was a pretty major repair. It took all day and into the night before I finally could turn the key and attempt to start the car. It was about midnight by the time I was finishing up, but there was still about an hour left of putting bolts back in before I was ready to call it a night. By this point, my only flashlight that still had any battery life left was a little pen light just bright enough to see into an engine bay but not bright enough to see more than 3 feet in front of you. I was mainly relying on a plug in work light, mostly cause the heat it put off was keeping me warm. 

It was about 12:30 at night when I started feeling like I was being watched. I couldn’t see into the tree line with all my lights dead, so again, smooth brain, I ignored it. But I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. By about 1am my phone finally died and took my music with it, so I was finishing up the last little bits in silence, still ignoring the feeling of being watched. 

It was the first sound of leaves crunching in the tree line probably 20 feet away from me that really fucking scared me. However, it’s not uncommon to see deer in my parents back yard, and deer are known to watch people, so I just assumed it was a deer and kept working, confident that I could hold my own if a confrontation with a human were to occur. 

The leaves crunched again a few min later, but this time it was much closer. Like just outside of the circle of light coming from my work light. When I looked up I couldn’t see anything and I’d had enough. I was tired from working on the car all day, I needed to plug my phone in, and I desperately needed to shower. So I called it a night early, grabbed my phone and my Bluetooth speaker, turned off the light, and went inside, leaving all my tools spread out across the whole area. 

For some reason I never connected the cigarette butts and the creepy feeling until I got into the house. The moment I made that connection, I went around the house locking all the doors and windows and brought my pistol into the bathroom while I showered. While I was in the shower, my parents dog started to go absolutely insane. This wasn’t particularly uncommon as shes a 4 year old yellow lab with more energy than an atomic bomb. I didn’t think much of it and figured if someone was gonna try to break in, they’d be scared off by her loud barking. Eventually the barking ceased and I got out of the shower to find nothing out of place so I went to bed, bringing my pistol with me. 

Fast forward 2 days without incident and my parents came home. I told them about the strange things that I experienced and they blew it off like it was relevant. Whatever my parents are kinda oblivious sometimes. I went home and all was well until my mom called me that night in a bit of a panic. 

The same night I went home, my parents next door neighbor was coming home from the grocery store. She was alone in the house because her husband worked the Night Shift. As she was bringing her groceries into the house, leaving the door unlocked as she went back and forth, a man entered her house and tried to attack her with a knife. This badass lady managed to fight back long enough to get to her purse where she kept a little 22 pistol and she shot her attacker 3 times. He didn’t go down right away and escaped the house. She called 911 right away and the man was arrested about half a mile away. He was found in possession of a large kitchen knife, a small amount of meth, and… cigarettes. 

I can’t confirm if whoever was smoking in my parents shed was the same person that attacked my parents neighbor, and I can’t confirm if I was being watched by this person or if it was just a deer, but I don’t really like the idea it’s all just a coincidence.
