Living alone in an apartment was beginning to be a lot more stressful.

Sure, I get the freedom that I have wished for since I was in high school. All the times that I have said that I want to be out of this house and to live on my own.

But now, I am slowly realizing that having just one person in the apartment wouldn’t hurt, especially given how expensive everything is nowadays.

So, I went through every social media platform and made posts, all with the necessary details. One thing that I didn’t like about this choice was the horror stories of weirdos and creeps, but I was more than willing to take the risk.

The first few weeks, nothing. That was until later in the month, I was getting request and DMS through the roof. Hell, they even offered money that was more than the original rent. I was looking up to it.

But there was one request that I took notice of. He was a college freshman looking for a place to live for the current semester. He offered five hundred dollars a month and was willing to cover groceries. I was sold.

The day he moved he was a promising guy, he did what he offered. I am happy with that. Everything was great.

I began to notice a few things about him. Every night, his bedroom lights were turned on for the night and strange noises were coming from behind the doors. I made nothing of it and went on with my own thing.

After the night comes the morning, he’s changing. He looked sickly, possibly insomnia, and began worrying about the guy. It was all too weird. And he got very defensive when I questioned anything about the nights.

A lot of his things have changed since he moved in. First, was the exterior walls surrounding his bedroom, and then the living room. He became more parasitic as time passed, covered with Polaroid photos and notes with ominous phrases.

As the nights progressed, the noises got louder and louder. I was fed up with these noises. I needed to know what was going on. I must find out the truth behind all these changes–I was afraid of the truth.  


That very night was all the same except for one thing. There was an awful smell of smoke floating from the bottom of the door. Colors changing. What in the hell was he doing in there?!

I knocked on the door and everything suddenly stopped, the strange noises. The lights stopped at one color, blood red. My heart was pumping rapidly and I was beginning to sweat profusely.

Damn it, I just kicked the fucking door and broke the lock. There he was on the small futon; completely naked, covered in blood, and holding a pipe. The one thing that caught my eye was what was left next to him, the nude body of a woman with her hands for stumps and missing a head.

He smiled and blew out the smoke in the air as he stared deeply into my eyes.
