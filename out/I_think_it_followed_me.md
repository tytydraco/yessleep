Ever since I was a child weird, unexplainable things have always happened around any house we lived in. My mom being the extremely spiritual person she was, swore up and down it was ghosts. I never really believed in ghosts and laughed at her outrageous conclusions to things that happened. My dad was also a non believer and so were my siblings. It wasn't until I was 12 when things shook me and my beliefs changed. We moved into a beautiful brick house that was built in the late 1800s. 

It was a small town, when I say small I mean one gas station and not many houses around. I loved the house, it had its original wood flooring, the walls told stories and it was just gorgeous. The basement did give me very weird feelings tho, like an uneasy feeling settled in my stomach anytime I walked past the doors. I hated going down there for anything. It's where the washer and dryer were tho so I had to frequent it often.

 I chose the middle room on the second story with my sisters. I was 12 at the time my sister 9 and my youngest sister was only 3. Our room was also very eerie, but i put it down to new surroundings and it being old. The first night is when things started happening. My sister's and I were in the room all giddy and laughing from the excitement when the closet door just popped open. We all fell silent and stared at each other. I got up and closed it and said it was probably already cracked and a draft opened it more. They agreed and we went back to talking. 

As we got settled for bed and I had just started dozing off when the closet door had popped open again. This time I didn't want to get up and shut it, not only was I too exhausted after a 5 hour move but i just didn't feel good about what was on the other side of that door. I ignored it and went to bed. The following months it kept happening along with other scary things. For starters I got my first bout of sleep paralysis. That was the worst thing I've ever experienced in my whole life. I woke up but couldn't move, scream or cry. 

Just forced to stare at that closet door. The whole time all I could hear was what sounded like too me someone stomping up and down the hallway. From my parents room to my brothers stopping Infront of our door for a few seconds then continuing on. After what felt like forever I finally snapped out of and screamed my sister's name. She woke up angered and told me it was a nightmare and to go back to bed. I also began seeing things, my brother saw them too. He was 12 and I was 14 the first time we saw it. We called him the tall shadow man. The figure was tall and just a pitch black shadow who stayed in corners. Our first sighting was in the living room. We both couldn't move, frozen from fear. 

He stood at least 6'8 and just was glued to the corner of the wall. We saw him many times after it but never spoke on it. My mom told us the house was haunted after we came to her. She said she didn't want to say anything because no one believes her ever, but she has witnessed so many things and has tried everything to rid the house. 

All failed obviously. An another honorable mention was when my brother came looking for me to play kickball but I had left for the day with my friends, he didn't know that because he had just woken up three hours after I had left. He said he went in the kitchen didn't see me so he went to my room and then my parents to ask where I had went. They told him I was at a friend's and he went to go back to his room to just play the 64. As he passed my room he thought he saw me standing my the mirror so he circled back thinking I was home. 

When he went in my room no one was in there. He yelled my name and when I didn't answer he went outside. He later told me it looked me except the hair was a light brown, I had black and red hair at the time because I dyed it. The last thing scary that happened before we moved due to my dad's death was what happened in the basement. I hated that basement. 

My youngest sister who was now 5 at the time, my mom and I were doing laundry. My mom wanted me to get the clothes from the dryer while she put the clothes from the washer in the dryer. 

My sister sat on the bottom step. There were two sides to the basement, the right side is where the washer and dryer were. It wasn't very scary there. The left side was different it stretched out about 30 feet and had the heater in the middle, it was the heater for the radiators in the house. About 8 feet past that were these two large red doors. No one ever went in them, but they just emitted this horrible feeling. As we're doing laundry my sister stands and points towards the doors and asked "who is that?" My mother asked who and she replied "the girl, she looks sad." My mom immediately dropped the clothes and asked what do you mean? What does she look like. This part still gives me chills to this day, I will never wash these words from my brain. She said "she's got long brown hair it's got red in it too and she's holding a jar, she looks said, she's telling me to come here baby come here" immediately after she said that I ran for the stairs, my mom grabbed my sister and it was like we were playing leap frog to the top. 

My mom screaming "in Jesus' name be gone, I do not welcome you in my home" while my sister screamed she was coming and I am desperately trying to get to the top. After that day I always had this weird feeling of someone watching me.

 I'm 24 now and have moved states since then. I have a family, am married and live in a new nice home far far away. The part that scares me the most is I think it followed me. What exactly? I don't know. The shadow man? The girl? The thing in my closet? It likes to hang in the room we don't use. I can feel it's presence and every once in a while something happens. I get sleep paralysis on the worst days. I don't know what to do, or what it wants. All I can do is pray and sage my house. I let it know it's not welcomed and I can help it find its way home if it needs but it is not allowed here anymore. It doesn't care. What should I do?
