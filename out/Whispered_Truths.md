Desperation makes liars of us all. I told myself I was taking the house-sitting job for the money, that I needed the quiet, the isolation. But the truth is, solitude calls to me—its silence a canvas upon which my thoughts become unbound, raw, and often unbecoming.

The ad itself was unremarkable:

“House-Sitter Needed. $1,200 for one week. Remote cabin. Quiet location. Must appreciate solitude.”

The response came swiftly. A woman, Angela, wrote with a tone of gracious urgency. She would be gone for seven days. The cabin was stocked. There was no Wi-Fi, but there was a landline. Her only request was tantalizing in its singularity: “Do not open the basement door.”

Her instructions were sparse, yet her image was everywhere. When I arrived, she met me in the driveway—an elegant woman in her mid-fifties, with a gaze as sharp as a scalpel’s edge. I found her attractive, almost disturbingly so, in the way one might admire a knife for both its beauty and its potential.

After she left, I discovered photographs of her scattered through the house: Angela on a sun-drenched porch, beside a lake, leaning against the cabin’s wooden frame. The cabin was filled with her presence, her scent, her secrets.

Night One: An Indiscretion

That first night, I explored. The house was unassuming, filled with the detritus of a life lived alone. Books, faded rugs, the faint hum of silence in every corner. But it was in the guest room closet that I found them—a pair of black lace panties, worn and folded with a care that felt almost ceremonial.

I should have left them where they lay.

But there is something in us—a dark curiosity, a need to brush the edges of propriety. I held them, hesitated, and then pressed them to my face.

The scent was faint, intimate, and intoxicating in a way I dare not name. The act was over in seconds, yet its shadow lingered, curling into the corners of my mind. I buried the panties back where I found them, ashamed but strangely exhilarated.

That night, I awoke to a sound: a tap, tap, tap, soft as the brush of fingertips against wood. I sat up, ears straining. The sound was faint, deliberate, and seemed to emanate from somewhere below.

I told myself it was the wind and went back to sleep.

Night Two: The Whispers Begin

The second night was worse.

The tapping returned, joined by something faint—whispers, thin and airy, rising through the floorboards. At first, they seemed random, like the rustle of leaves. But as I lay in the dark, listening, I realized they had cadence. Words.

I strained to hear, but the whispers eluded me, tantalizingly just out of reach.

Sleep was impossible. My thoughts returned, unbidden, to the closet, to what I’d done. I told myself it was nothing, a moment of indulgence, but the whispers carried a different weight. They were accusatory, amused, like laughter behind a closed door.

I locked the bedroom door that night. Not that it mattered.

Night Three: Voices in the Dark

By the third night, the whispers had become voices.

They slithered through the cabin, rising and falling like a tide. At first, they were fragmented: soft, unintelligible murmurs that brushed the edges of comprehension. But as the hours stretched, the words sharpened.

“He watches. He waits. He hides.”

I froze in bed, the sheets damp with sweat.

“He touched. He smelled.”

The words wrapped around me like a noose, pulling tight. My breath came in shallow gasps, my mind racing. The voices knew. The house knew.

And then I heard it: my name, whispered in unison, carried on a current of malice.

Night Four: The Basement

I couldn’t take it anymore. The house had become a living thing, breathing, watching, judging. I told myself that facing it—whatever it was—would grant me release.

I took the key Angela had left, heavy with unspoken promise, and opened the basement door.

The air was cold, heavy with the scent of damp earth and something metallic. The stairs groaned underfoot, each step a betrayal.

At the bottom, the darkness seemed alive, shifting and writhing. At first, I saw nothing. But then a shape emerged—a shadow against shadows, its edges indistinct, its form alien. It did not move, but its presence filled the room.

And then it spoke.

Its voice was low, soft at first, curling through the air like smoke. “We saw you.”

I froze, my blood turning to ice.

“We watched as you held them,” it continued, its tone laced with contempt. “Did you enjoy the scent?”

My breath caught, a strangled gasp escaping my lips.

“You thought you were alone,” it hissed, louder now, the words sharp and accusatory. “But we saw everything.”

The shadow moved then—just a step forward, but it was enough. My legs gave out, and I scrambled backward, clawing my way up the stairs. The voices rose around me, a cacophony of laughter and whispers, chasing me as I fled.

Aftermath

I drove away that night, never stopping, never looking back.

When I reached home, I found an email waiting in my inbox. The subject line read: “I hope you enjoyed your stay.”

The message was brief:

“The house enjoyed you. And so did I. Don’t worry—we’ll always be watching. —Angela.”

I deleted it immediately, but the damage was done. The whispers followed me into the night, into my dreams, into my life.

I will never be alone again.
