***-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***

I finished reading the first chapter of the book- soul collecting 101. It took me the better half of the day, and even then I had to read it a couple more times to fully grasp what it was saying, what it was explaining. Everything sounded batshit crazy.

*Every twentieth person has made a deal with the devil.*

I didn't even know the devil was real.. I mean why would I think he is? Or is it a she? And every twentieth person? Does that mean every twentieth person is running around with no soul, filthy rich? Hot as hell? Or whatever else they wished for?

*Souls aren't worth as much as you think, an average human soul doesn't interest the devil, and he won't buy it for outrageous wishes.*

So every twentieth person is maybe just a little richer, maybe just a little handsomer? But where does my grandfather come into play here? What was he doing?

*As famously known, people often attempt to trick the devil into giving them their wish, while still being able to keep their soul, and sometimes the sold soul never makes it into the devil's hands. That's where Soul Collecting 101 comes into play. Devils do not wish to waste their time to collect lowly souls themselves, so they employ me- or you to collect it for them.*

I wonder if my soul would be considered lowly? Would I get a good wish for it? That's not the point right now though. Since it doesn't say, I'll just assume they pay in lowly human currency for these jobs. How would I go about collecting a soul anyway?

*Soul collecting is simple on paper, you have to make them willingly submit their soul, and then place it into a soul jar, which the devil provides.*

That sounds anything but simple. Make them willingly submit their soul? Who in their right mind would just give up their soul. Am I going to walk up to someone and be like "Hey, you owe your soul to the devil, do you mind paying up?".

I take a deep sigh and place the book on the coffee table, laying back.

What to do, what to do, what to do..

Maybe I should call Ezekieel, none of this makes any logical sense. I frown at that thought. No, he'll think I'm actually interested in this then. I'm just testing the waters. All I really want is the cabin in the woods to sell.

"Hi!" I suddenly hear a demonic voice say from somewhere in my apartment. I scream in horror, getting up frantically and looking around.

I see a young boy, Luis standing in the doorway to my kitchen, still wearing his overalls, waving his hand at me. "You scared me!" I shout at him.

He sheepishly grins in respons. "Oh I love doing that." He whispers under his breath, which I can still hear. "What was that?"

"Nothing." He responds.

I take another sigh. "What do you want?"

"How's it going? Reading the rulebook I mean?" Luis asks.

I slump back into my cushioned chair, picking it back up. I've barely gone through the first 3 or 4 pages, and already have a massive headache trying to understand it all. It's like trying to study a combination of medicine and law while being high on LSD.

"Not good?" Luis takes my silence for an answer.

I nod to him.

"Well how about a little practical experience on soul collecting?" He says, his demonic voice sounding excited, gosh that voice gives me the chills, but I perk up my ears to listen anyway.

He continues speaking. "I have this guy, sold his soul to me a while ago, and as per our contract, I was to collect it on new years, well it's been two weeks since new years, and I still haven't heard a peep from him."

I had so so many questions running through my head right now. Luis was a devil? What did the man wish for? Where was he now? Why do devils collect the souls of the living anyway?

Instead of asking any of that, I just gulped down on my saliva and thought about my answer very carefully.

"What do I get out of it?"

"Yeah yeah, I'll pay you no biggie." This devil is more like a young hippie. I saw his lips perk up into a grin.

"Hmm? Why are you smiling?" I asked.

"You do know that I can read your thoughts?"

I flushed in embarrassment and horror. "Get out of my head!" I screamed at him.

"yeah yeah.." He dismissed me like it was nothing.

"I can't answer all of your questions, but since he has already broken the contract, I can reveal the contents of his wish." I waited in anticipation, this would determine whether I'd do the job or not.

"He wished for his crime to be forgotten by all living beings."

"What was his crime?" If he was a murderer, heck no. But if its just theft, then just maybe I'd go for it.

"I do not know." Luis responded sounding a little disappointed himself.

"What were all those people back in my grandfathers funeral? Were they all also devils?" I asked.

"No I was the other devil present, I do not know all of those people, but I assume all of them were business partners in one way or another."

"How about Ezekieel?" I asked.

"I would stay away from Ezekieel." Luis said grimly. I nodded along.

"So how about some experience in soul collecting?" Luis tried using an uplifting tone, which just made his demonic voice sound really really weird.

"Can't you change your voice into something.. more human?" I asked carefully, not trying to offend.

Luis flashed hurt on his face. "This is my true voice, why would I want to change it?" I sighed in defeat.

"Alright alright, sorry I asked." He walked over to my tv. "Fun fact, these things are often used as portals." He put his small hand on the screen, rubbing a spot in circles. The tv suddenly lit up and a channel opened. I could hear people's screams coming from the other end.

"What is that?" I asked, curious.

"Hell." Luis smiled at me, and removed his hand, the tv turned back off again.

"So, how about it, you want the job or not? I don't have all day." I knew I couldn't avoid his question for the fourth time.

I sighed. "Only if you can give me a search area, or even better his direct location."

Luis grinned at me then and walked up to me, reaching out his hand. I looked at it curiously. "I can do one better." I took his hand and he pulled me up. "This might hurt." He warned.

"Wait wait wait!" I tried saying, but it was already too late. my clothes had already caught on fire and I could feel the heat on my skin. I tried flailing around, I tried putting out the flames but it was no use. It traveled upwards until it reached my torso, then my neck, and soon, my entire body was burning. The flames were incredibly hot, the heat was intense and I could feel it lick my skin. But strangely enough I thought it would hurt more.

The flames suddenly started going out slowly, and the intense heat disappeared. I opened my eyes again and the first thing I did was check myself. I was completely unharmed. My clothes, too were unburnt. How was this possible? My entire body was on fire.

"Was that fun?" Luis asked with a smug expression. I gave him a look.

"Warn me next time?" I said, feigning hurt. Truth was, this was fucking cool.

"I did warn you!" Luis responded defensively. Had he been a normal boy, I bet we could've been the best of friends.. or okay not friends, maybe uncle and nephew.

"I am probably 300 times older than you are."

"Stop reading my mind!" I warned him.

"Alright alright." He put his hands up defensively.

"Where did you take us?" I started asking the important questions.

"To the sinner."

I took this time to look around. I could tell that we were in a dark, small room, but nothing else besides that. Luis snapped his fingers and a small flame appeared in his hand, illuminating the room, which I now realized was a closet big enough for people to walk around in. I noticed a light bulb on the ceiling, with a string attached to it. I pulled on it and the light came on.

I looked around for the door, and once I found it I attempted to open it carefully and quietly. It opened  into the outside, so I had to use a little force to push it open, which then resulted in the door banging against the wall, and the man whose home we were in to be alerted of it.

"What was that?" I heard a male voice say from somewhere else. Luis shook his head at me.

I stepped out of the closet, not sure what to do next. I looked around for a weapon, and found a table lamp which I quickly snatched up. The footsteps were getting closer. I hid behind the door, Luis was standing out in the open. "What are you doing?" I angrily whispered to him. "He can't see me" Luis said normally, and then added. "Oh and he has a large knife." He grinned.

I flipped him off with my middle finger. I saw the man's toes just barely past the door frame, but he stopped moving. Then suddenly he jumped into the room, facing the open closet door, luckily he didn't see me, because I was hidden behind the door. I heard the man sigh in relief and he walked up to the door and closed it. I was out in the open.

I quickly lifted the table lamp up and smashed it on his head. He fell over and was knocked unconscious. Luis clapped his hands.

"Fuck off." I told him. "Here's your soul, now take me home." He shook his head in response.

"You have to make him give it up." I suddenly remembered reading about it. I could just slap myself across the face.

"Make sure he doesn't wake up."

After telling Luis, I walked through the apartment, searching for three simple things; a chair, rope, and duct tape. This man was living quite a rich life, making me believe my theory even more; the man was a robber.

With the chair and duct tape in hand, I returned to Luis, the man was still unconscious on the ground. I lifted him up and sat him down on the chair, and began trying to tie him up using the tape. Unfortunately no rope could be found, not like anyone just keeps rope around in their home anyway.

After a good 10 minutes I finally felt confident enough that he wouldn't be able to break free. The man didn't look strong anyway, he was skinnier than I was, had almost no muscle and was pretty short.

The entire time Luis was just observing me and my actions, like teacher observing student.

"Well?" I looked at him.

"Oh right the soul jar." Luis sprung into action, snapping his fingers once more. Flames burst out at my feet, before slowly succumbing into thin air, in their place stood a glass jar.

"By the way, if you fail to make him give up his soul, then you'll pay with yours instead." Luis said, giving me a sly smile. This fucking devil. He tricked me. I gulped down saliva, it was time for this guy to wake up.

I slapped him across the face. He didn't budge. I walked to the kitchen and filled up a large cup with water, once I got back I poured it all over his head, this time he jolted awake. "Please don't hurt me!" He pleaded, trying to move in his bound state.

"That depends." I was trying to sound as cunning as possible.

"You signed your soul off to the devil, I have come to collect." I said in my deepest possible voice. I was standing in a darker corner of the room so he wouldn't be able to see me.

"Please, anything, just let me live." He pleaded again. I look at Luis for guidance, does this already count as giving up his soul? He just shrugged.

I opened the jar and spoke. "Say that you are willingly giving your soul away."

"I am giving my soul to this person." The man quickly said.

"He doesn't mean it, he has to mean it." Luis said behind me.

"You have to mean it." I repeated Luis's words to the man.

"Okay okay." "I am willingly giving my soul away!" He said rapidly. I saw a small orb appear from his chest. It hovered above the man.

"Again." I said.

"I give my soul away! Take it please!" I was a little confused on why this man was so terrified of me. I mean if he just said no, I'd be the one to give my soul to the devil instead?

The orb slowly started to move towards me. I held up the jar and it floated inside. I closed it.

"Happy?" I said out loud.

Luis nodded and clapped his hands.

"Oh no.. It's- it's you!" The man was looking at Luis wide-eyed.

"You can see him?"

"I have ownership of his soul now, so naturally he can see me."  Luis said, sounding uninterested.

"I never signed my soul to you! Only some of my memories!" He accused Luis.

"Well I wanted your soul as well." He said.

What the fuck is going on? I looked at Luis, my eyes pleading for an answer.

"He didn't owe me a soul, but you just made him give it up, so thank you for that." He smiled.

I was frozen in place. He fucking tricked me. Twice.

"Untie the man, we're leaving." I nodded and cut the tape with scissors.

"Please give it back." The man pleaded. I could only look at him with my sorry, regretful eyes. Luis snapped his fingers and my clothes caught on fire again. Soon, I was back in my apartment, standing in the exact same spot as before we left.

"You tricked me." I said under my breath.

"Yeah well that's also a valuable lesson."

This devil, demon, whatever you want to call him, I let my guard down because he seemed innocent, he seemed nice. He looked like a kid with a scary voice.

"Well I'll be on my way, I hope this practical experience will help you in your future endevours of collecting souls." He said nonchalantly. He had a strange look in his eyes. I couldn't tell whether it was regret, or triumph.

He burst into flames and disappeared into thin air. I sighed and leaned back on my chair once more.

Looking at the time, it was getting late now. So I decided to head to bed.

Today I learned to not trust the devil, no matter how nice or innocent he may [look.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Coureherritt)
