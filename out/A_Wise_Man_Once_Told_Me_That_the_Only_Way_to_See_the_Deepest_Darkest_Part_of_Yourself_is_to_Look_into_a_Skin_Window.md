You wanna know how I see all the deep, dark parts?

You wanna see them too?

You might *think* you do. Might feel like it’ll all be some major revelation. The truth is, you probably can’t handle it. It takes a really really REALLY (Three times, yeah) special, certain kind of person. 

I never thought that was me. Not until it happened. And honestly, what I was saying just before? About a revelation? You’re goddamn right that’s how it felt.

The part you need to understand is that it’s not about seeing the deep, dark parts inside of you. It’s not about seeing the deep, dark parts that *LIVE* inside of you. 

It’s about the deep, dark parts that live inside of you seeing. 

I fell on some hard times when I was in my early 20’s. I was never exactly the ambitious type, you how people say “the world is your oyster?” Or at least, I’ve heard people say that in movies. My world was the opposite. 

Now don’t get me wrong here. I was never some starry-eyed idealist with big dreams that got dashed by one wrong decision. Life had never been particularly exciting or great. Growing up was fine. High school was fine. Family didn’t have much but didn’t have nothing. Went to college for some bullshit degree, accounting, some nonsense shit that people who feel nothing and see no horizon stretched in front of them go for. 

Everything was like a placeholder.

And truth be told, I was fine with it. I had friends, I wasn’t miserable, we partied a fair bit, the way college kids do. My lack of any real motivation or ambition or vision made it a little easier for me to take that pill. Snort that coke. Stick a needle in my arm. 

Turned out I had a pretty addictive personality. One thing led to another and I dropped out of school, lost contact with mom and dad. Burned the couple bridges I had. Even when your life is covered in this endless fog of malaise, you can still fall on those hard times. 

As you can probably imagine, I was never a particularly introspective person. I never looked inward to analyze the choices I’d made and whether they were preventable. I didn’t really feel guilt the last time I saw my mother, anguish and tears in her eyes and also fear as I rifled through her purse and gripped up a couple of dollar bills in my sweaty palms.  

The lint from the bottom of her purse stuck to my hands with the sweat. Mom had blue eyes. That’s all I can really see now when I try to think of her. Just these two crystal blue orbs floating in a dark expanse. I have no reference point anymore for the *real* her, you know? Been a while. 

But anyway. The thing. When I’d lost everything and was roughing it on the streets, there was a couple of other bums who I had a little bit of camaraderie with. I guess it’s… well we weren’t really “friends” but you find people you can kind of stick to and it’s like you give yourself a human shield. 

There’s strength in numbers even if what you’re up against is nothing in particular. The world, everything. 

There was a particular guy under the overpass where we used to spend most of our time. They took this old movie theater parking lot under the highway and turned it into free public parking in the city. Problem was, it was too far away from most of the houses and neighborhoods to be any use to the people who lived there. So it was usually half empty and it was a great place to sit and brood and enjoy melting your brain without being bothered.

This older guy, don’t remember his name now. Don’t know if I ever knew it. Typical crusty old bum, unshaven and wild grey hair. Wore this orange bubble jacket even in the middle of summer. Used to always call me “kid” like we were in a fucking movie. 

“You’re too good for these streets kid.”

As if any of us were too good for anything or that mattered at all. I guess it might help the story here if I could remember his name but I can’t. He’s dead now anyway. 

He’s the one who showed me. We were laying there one night, in the summer. Even in the dark the air was still hot and sticky and reeked of trash and BO and all these foul things. You could never get away from the foul things. 

The old timer looked at me, kinda squinted. He was always half squinting, the deep gouged wrinkles and crow’s feet gave him permanently narrowed eyes. He liked the shit too. We’d sit there hunched over our strips of tinfoil I swiped from the corner store and huff those blues. 

I need you to listen though. Make this *really* really (Two times, make a note) clear. I was never numbing myself from anything. Never running from anything. None of the shit I did up to this night in my entire life really ever mattered to me at fucking *all.* 

Isn’t that kind of worse? Isn’t it? To become balls out addicted to drugs at age 21 for no real reason at all? Daddy didn’t pull my pants down at night, mommy didn’t burn my arm with her cigarettes. She didn’t even smoke. 

Wouldn’t it have been better if I’d had a reason? 

….

No, I’m actually *asking* you. I’m asking YOU. Tell me. I wanna know what you think. Can you speak? Are you allowed to speak? Can you transcribe your own words? 

….

Okay, right. Fuck it. Make a note at least then, I guess this whole thing’s a note. Make a note that she (Meaning you) said NO. She’s not allowed to answer. 

I just feel like it needs to be stated and repeatedly emphasized that it wasn’t some trauma or incident that spurred me to any of this. ANY of it.

So the old timer squints at me. Right before I’m about to hit it and drift off. And he goes

“There’s something inside you.”

I rolled my eyes and gave him this stone stare. I didn’t want this fuck getting all philosophical with me. Like I said, he seemed like a good enough guy. We stuck together. Chatted sometimes about bullshit, the stuff going on in the neighborhood. Scoring. I wasn’t one for deep talks. 

 He must’ve caught it. Felt what I was gonna say. Something along the lines of telling him to shut his mouth. 

And he sits up a bit from where he was slumped against a concrete pillar. He says, “I don’t mean it like that kid. I mean for real. There’s something inside you. Something living there.”

I didn’t scoff or argue or get any more angry. Didn’t react much at all. He didn’t say it any special or particularly convincing way. My mouth twitched a little. It’s twitching a little right now. 

The old timer sat his way up further, jostled himself forward. He placed his pruny hands on the cuff of his filth-caked sweatpants. He didn’t say anything else, not yet. Kept his eyes locked with mine as he rolled the pantleg up, exposing his mottled and liver-spotted skin. 

Old timer kept going, past the knee. Up to his thigh. My mouth twitched a lot. My eyes widened. Once the old timer had pulled his pants all the way up almost to his crotch, bunching them up there, I could see it.

On his wrinkled leg, a perfectly rectangular strip of flesh was missing. Probably two feet long, covering almost the entire length of his inner thigh. But it wasn’t some gory horror scene. It was like… He had somehow removed just the *top* layer of his flesh. And underneath that, a translucent and veiny membrane that you could see through. But behind it wasn’t muscle or sinew. It was this empty, dark cavity. A red-tinged cavern. 

I was somehow looking *into* the old timer’s leg. It was like he had a window made of skin and I was looking out into him. Like the inside of his body was some kind of abyss.

Of course, my initial reaction was that all the poisonous shit I’d been ingesting for the last several years had fried my brain. I’ve made it clear at this point that I don’t scare or startle easily. But if there was ever a time. 

He held up a knobby hand. “Not just this. You gotta wait a sec, kid.”

What the old man had said just before exposing his bizarre secret. There’s something living inside of you. 

Like that, it hit me. It wasn’t *painful.* Wasn’t like the kind of sound that drives you mad. But it was present and impossible to ignore, birthed from the ether and suddenly clutching the base of my brain. This rushing, chittering… it’s hard to even put it into words. It kind of sounds like rushing water, but the water’s made of sharp shards of bone. Even that doesn’t really describe it. 

But as soon as the old timer showed me that skin window, the noise was there. 

Then, the deep and dark part. 

From the empty part of the timer’s leg, the void beyond the skin window that should’ve been blood and muscle and fat and bone and meat and human parts , a creature scurried into view. 

I gasped, audibly. I won’t undersell it, it scared the fucking shit out of me. At bare minimum I was entering a drug induced psychosis. You ever have a bad trip? Ever do drugs?  

….

She shook her head no again. She can’t answer. 

The thing. The monster. 

This time I actually screamed in outright fear. I wanted to get the fuck out of there, away from the old man, but I couldn’t help but keep my eyes locked on the freakish little homunculus.

I could make it out well, even through the cloudy veneer of the skin window. Its flesh was black, veiny and slick. A long antennae protruded from its bulbous little head. It had two yellow eyes dotted with black pinprick pupils, and two holes set in between - a ghoulish-pig nose. An ovular , toothless mouth leaking yellow sludge completed the visage. Its puny arms ended with three fingered hands. The thing was entirely smooth other than the pulsing veins that covered it. No claws or nails. 

It was probably the size of a squirrel. It skittered all the way up to the membrane on the old man’s leg. The thing walked on two legs, just like a little person.

“They live inside most of us kid. I think. Dunno if they’ve always been there or they got put there, somehow?”

The old man spoke matter-of-factly as I stayed transfixed by the little obsidian goblin living inside his leg. 

“It’s odd though, you can’t really *feel* ‘em. I never felt the little bugger running around. Even after I opened it up and saw him. I still don’t. He’s in there, been with me… well , I guess I don’t even know how long. I found him in there probably 15, 20 years back?”

The old timer scratched his beard absent-mindedly as the creature pressed its face directly against the skin window, pressing it forward slightly but not breaking through. It’s yellow eyes rolled back and forth.

“Yeah I reckon uh…” the old man continued but immediately trailed off. “I reckon after all this time, thing probably wants out.”

I finally turned my gaze away from the creature, away from the impossible membrane of translucent flesh. I snapped my attention to the old timer.

“What the *fuck* is this. How did you… what the fuck are you even talking about? What *IS* this this?” I gestured impotently at the tiny freak living inside his leg. 

The old man sighed. He paid the creature and the skin window as little attention now as he did prior to revealing them. The degree of nonchalance was honestly kind of astonishing. Though to be fair, at this point I didn’t even know what was real. I mean I guess I still don’t.

“All those years ago, the time I mentioned. Somebody showed me how to find it. Funny thing is, I kinda remember it being sorta like this. Me a young man, cowering beneath some dirty and decrepit overpass. Old man babbling about crazy shit. But that’s not right at all…”

The old timer’s face became helplessly lost and confused for a moment. But it passed. Something did. Something passed over his eyes. 

None of this makes any sense right? I’m not expecting it to. Just for the record. Make sure you make a note of that in big, giant and bold letters. I don’t give a FUUUUCKKKKK what any of you think about this. Put four U’s and five K’s in the word fuck. This is my truth. 

The old man kept going. “Well, it don’t matter I guess. Point is, a long time ago, maybe on a night like this or maybe not, somebody showed me how to open the window. You take your hand.” He held up his palm to emphasize.

“You know the ley lines?” I’d heard the term before. I nodded. What else could I do?

“Trace your ley lines with a finger, then repeat that on the meatiest part of your inner thigh. Then, around that space you traced, you trace a rectangle, big and wide as you can. Only, you do that with a knife.”

I was sweating now. My head was aching. I didn’t *feel* high. It was like it had all evaporated. 

“And it won’t bleed, not the way you’re thinking.” The old man went on. “It’ll kinda make this little flap. Then you pull back on that, you find the window and sure enough, one’a these little bastards is running around inside. This is what’s inside all of us.”

I stared at him, dumbfounded. I looked back at the skin window, back at the creature. It hadn’t moved. It was still there. Without even thinking, I reached my hand out and touched the membrane. It was cool and squishy. And through it, I poked the little creep in the stomach. Like a rotten Pillsbury doughboy. It glurgled and blinked its yellow eyes real hard. But it didn’t flinch. 

It was real.

Like I said before, I was never the type of person to conceptualize or worry about things that I couldn’t see or touch or feel right in front of my own goddamn face. And here we were. Seeing and touching and feeling.

The old timer continued. “Like I said, I don’t feel him scrambling around in there. I can hear him though. Once you see one for the first time you can hear ‘em all. At least, that’s what I think. Only because I never heard one til I saw it for the first time. But afterwards… I mean for the first couple years it was goddamn torture being around any large groups of people. Just this endless, overwhelming skittering sound. All the little men running around inside everybody. Guess after a while I just learned to tune it out.”

He went silent again. Letting me take it all in, I guess. The heat of the night air suddenly felt oppressive and thick. My mouth was dry. That chittering, rushing water sound was still there swimming through my brain  There was really only one question I could think to ask.

“Why… why are you showing me this…?” I choked the words out through warm spit. 

The old man took a deep breath, which immediately led into a hacking and wet cough. He spit a wad of blackened phlegm onto the ground before answering. 

 “Well kid, it’s like I’ve told you before. I think you’re too good for these streets. I just… dunno really how to put it into words I guess. The little guy, my buddy here inside me. He’s just gone hog wild nonstop ever since you came around. The noise, it’s louder ever since you hit the streets. I ain’t claiming to be a genius, but it seems to me that’s what the men in suits might call a correlation.”

My eyes drifted back to the leg. The skin window. The thing was pressing its little hands against the membrane once again. 

“And the noise. Well, I dunno what this means but… I don’t hear it from you, kid. Not the same way anyway.”

I looked at him incredulously. 

“There’s just this slight… pulling, snapping sound I hear outta you. Every so often. Like wood settling inside an old house. It’s not the endless scampering I hear from everybody else. Their little buddy running around inside them. The point is that between those two things, it just seems like there’s something… Different about you.” 

I was never one for dramatic gestures, but I buried my face in my hands. It was the only response. I shook my head, rubbing my face against my upturned palms.

“None of this makes any fucking sense, man…” I lifted my head slowly to speak. “Inside of you is fucking bones and meat and blood and guts. That’s what’s inside everybody.”

The old man pointed to the clear evidence to the contrary that occupied his own body.

“That’s what I thought too, til I saw for myself. Think about that, kid. You ever really see inside yourself? Sure, we see pictures in books and hear doctors run their yaps. How the hell are you supposed to *know* without lookin’? Some egghead scientist can tell me all he wants what he thinks is inside me, but I’ve lived with this in front of my own two eyes for years!”

The noise intensified as the creature excitedly skittered within its domain.

The old timer went on. “I think you’re the next piece of this. I think he wants out.”

All the sounds in the world seemed to cease. My sweat turned cold even in the hot city night. Slowly, the old man reached inside of his rotten orange jacket and withdrew a black handled buck knife. 

Without another word, he tossed it in my direction.

“I’ve had my theories about this for a while,” he kept talking as I stared at the weapon on the ground in stunned silence. “But I’ve just… I’ve never had the guts, you know kid? It’s one thing to accept something outlandish happening in this world. It’s another to take that next step. But… I think these things are with us. They’re inside, and I think they want to I’ll go. And truthfully, I’ve got no reason to argue or disagree with that desire. Maybe we’re all just carrying water for somebody else. But I thought you’d help me, kid. And after you help me, well we see what happens then. And you do whatever you want with the things I told you here tonight.”

Without even realizing it, I had picked the knife up from the warm asphalt beneath us. I closed the distance between myself and the old timer. 

The whole moment, it just felt really fluid and natural. I couldn’t really argue with what my body was doing. I guess it felt trancelike. That noise biting away at the back of my brain had some kind of hypnotic quality.

Like I had said before, my entire life all I ever did was go through the fucking motions. Respond to the situation presented to me without much question. Why would this be any different? Or maybe deep down, there was some part of me in my drug-ravaged brain that saw whatever the hell the old timer had just exposed me to as a chance to expand my life, my horizons, in some kind of meaningful way?

….

How may times does the phrase “this fucker is CRAZY” go through your head when you’ve got somebody in here spilling to you?

….

Anyway, I reached forward, and pressed the knife against the membrane of the old timer’s skin window. It went through without much resistance. It was like slicing into a thin piece of chicken. I ran the knife around the perimeter of the skin window. The little black creature watched, its yellow eyes following the blade the entire time. I didn’t even look at the old man. 

Once I’d finished cutting, I used my fingers to peel away the membranous flesh. It was slimy and surprisingly cold to the touch.

The window was open. 

Immediately, the thing leapt forward out of the old timer’s leg in a flash. It hit the ground with its animal feet and twitched its head back and forth excitedly. I guess that was the first time it had ever touched the earth. Taken in the air. The creature stared at me. Its oval mouth pulsated , opening and closing repeatedly as slime dribbled down from it onto the pavement below. Suddenly, it took off and ran into the night at an incredible speed. It was gone. It was free.

As psychotic as the whole experience was, in that moment a feeling immediately passed over me. Like I knew I had done the right thing.

A weak, wheezing gasp cut into the air  behind me. A chill went down my spine. I'd been so lost in the moment, I hadn’t even thought of the old timer. He’d said nothing, not reacted at all to the freedom of his so-called little buddy.

Slowly, I turned back to face him. 

Rivers of dark, thick blood cascaded out of the gaping hole in the old man’s leg. The liquid splashed loudly as it puddled on the concrete beneath him. My body began to convulse, I guess with the overwhelming adrenaline. I looked at the old timer’s face. 

His face.

His eyes had rolled almost completely into the back of his head, and had clouded over with a milky haze. His mouth hung open, an abyssal void filled with a few rotting teeth.

He was dead.

I looked at my hands, realizing I was still clutching both the knife and the thin membrane that had covered the man’s skin window.

I looked back and forth around the darkened parking lot manically, searching for an answer or some help from nobody. The air started to smell like copper.

My eyes returned to the waterfall of crimson pouring from the old man’s leg. I squatted down and slowly inched my outstretched hand toward the pooling red blood. Had to be sure. 

I gingerly dipped my fingers into the warm liquid, withdrawing the dripping red tips as another chill reverberated through my body. This wasn’t the drugs, it wasn’t psychosis. It was real. I stood, and took one last look at the old timer’s ghoulish, slack-jawed face.

Like the tiny creature I’d just freed from its prison, I ran off into the dark.

The next couple hours were a blur. I just wandered the streets, zombified. Stumbling around in the dark. I didn’t feel like I was going anywhere in particular, just sort of trudging along on instinct. I’m sure you can tell from some of the things I’ve said here that I’m not a particularly emotional person. But I still understood the intensity and gravity of what had just happened. 

Even if the old timer had asked for it, I’d just sliced someone’s leg clean open and killed them. Well… Okay, the truth is that now upon reflection - and this was rattling around somewhere in my head even then - I don’t think it’s fair to say I killed the old timer. I think he knew the chances of something like that happening were  pretty high and at the very least he was coercing me to forge ahead into some kind of uncharted territory.

A million questions were racing through my mind. The old timer had said he thought these things lived inside all of us. Was I going to be completely overwhelmed once the dawn broke in the city? When people covered the busy streets, blissfully unaware of the chaos lurking beneath their flesh? Overwhelmed by the sound of a million skittering limbs. 

What was I supposed to do now? It felt like my obligation was just beginning. 

Eventually, I ended up passing out on a park bench. I was woken up some time into the next day by some fuck ass pig tapping me with his baton. 

The sun immediately blasted into my eyes, causing me to squint. I felt the heat of the summer day. Weirdly, I didn’t feel the need to fix. I’d typically be jonesing hard after a long sleep like that, but drugs were the furthest thing from my mind. 

All I could focus on was the noise. That sound just like the old timer had described. Running water made of bones. It resonated all around me, digging into my brain. It was unbearable. The skittering and chittering from the little things living inside the hundreds of people passing through the park on a warm summer day.

The pig tapped me with his club again.

“Time to get up.”

I slowly rose to a sitting position  and nodded. I hoped I didn’t have any visible dry blood on my hands or coat. 

“You alright buddy?” The cop asked gruffly. I nodded again and stood to my feet. I grumbled something about being fine and wandered away. I didn’t want to look any crazier than I already did, so I refrained from cupping my hands over my ears, but I needed to get the fuck away from that park and all those people and that noise. 

As the sound bombarded me, my thoughts penetrated through. I knew I’d do it again.

That night, I went down to one of the seedier strips in the city. Old, junked out block where everyone’s on junk. You see ladies of the night street walking, washouts like me strung out and nodding in the gutter. 

I picked a girl at random. She was stood on the corner, a neon pink tube top and black mini skirt accompanied by dark fishnets and heels. Brunette. Maybe 10 years and a thousand needles ago she’d have been pretty attractive. 

I approached her and flashed the fifty or so bucks I’d had left over from the night before, meant to score today with an early start. Before everything changed irreversibly forever. The money was fucking useless to me now.

I told her I wanted my dick sucked in one of the alleys, quick blow and go. She seemed hesitant, but there’s a thin line between hesitance and desperation when you’re in our shoes. I told her I’d give her a couple blues as well. She went for it, smiling through her scabbed lips. 

I’d quickly scoped the alley out before talking to her. We were all alone. I quickly snapped and turned and wrapped my hands around her neck. Even in the dark I could see the desperate and regretful whites of her eyes. I forcefully dragged her deeper into the alley. She kicked and fought but I held firm. I spun her around and wrapped her in a tight headlock with the crook of my arm. 

I held tight until she started to slump over and lose consciousness. I lowered her to the ground with me in a half sitting/laying position. I took hold of her wrist with one hand, and with the other I gingerly traced the lines of her palm, just like the old timer had said. I repeated the pattern on her soft inner thigh after hiking up her skirt. I grabbed the knife, still dirty with bits of the old man’s blood. She stirred a bit, attempting to fight against me in her half unconscious fugue state.  Her eyes widened in terror and pain as I sliced open the skin window.

I didn’t wait or give it time to marinate. I immediately plunged the knife into the clear membrane after ripping off the initial flap of flesh, and tore that off too. She let out a soft moan as rivers of blood cascaded down her supple leg. 

The chittering grew louder as a squat, chunky creature emerged. Black skinned and diminutive like the one that had come out of the old man, but decidedly *fatter*. It’s bulbous eyes were set on opposite sides of its lumpy head. It wriggled its little fat baby arms and legs  as it slumped out from the open window and hit the ground. 

It looked up at the night sky, holding its gaze there for a long moment. The little ghoul turned to face me, shaking its head excitedly. And then, it darted off on stubby legs. I felt like this was all the things wanted, you know? Wherever they went after this, they wanted out because they wanted to *see.* Really inhabit the world around them. They can’t see enough from the dark cavern of a human vessel. Can’t see enough from a skin window. They need a bigger window. A better view. 

I stood from the whore’s body, leaving her in that dark alley in a pool of her own blood. This time, I felt much more at peace with the whole situation. The doubts were gone from my mind.

It went on and on and on like that for a while. My relationship with these things, freeing them from their skin windows, even at the price. The price of a life. It felt worth the cost. It felt like it was something bigger than me. I’d hear that skittering, pick someone at random and just… Do what needed to be done. 

There was always a little twinkle in the creatures’ yellow eyes when we’d have that brief silent moment before they skittered off.

Doing this stopped me thinking about the drugs. It stopped me thinking about the life I could’ve had, the missteps and the malaise.

I freed so, so many. Sometimes I’d drag people off the street, sometimes break into houses. I tried to make it as quick and… Well, to say I tried to make it painless is a fucking lie. I tried to make it as quick as possible for everyone. It was clinical, you know? You use that word. Everyone I crossed paths with this way was just in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong world.

But there’s only so long you can live in the shadows like that, you know? Eventually the things I’d done caught up to me. I mean, you knew that already. We’re sitting right here having this conversation. 

I think a lot now about fate and the way things go and why they happen. Why did I choose to break into that flat at 1:00 in the afternoon, broad fucking daylight? Gave plenty of time for the locals to call the cops on the crazed and disheveled looked homeless guy they just saw bust down their neighbors’ door. 

The little girl, she had one in her too. I could hear it. But again, you already know how that went. I was on the ground with some pig’s knee digging into the back of my neck before I could get to her. 

I guess maybe there was a part of me that *wanted* to get caught? Wanted to tell the story? I mean, that’s why I asked to give this lengthy and long winded statement to an impartial transcriber. It feels like a story worth telling, whether you believe it or not. Do you? Do you believe it? 

….

She’s still diligently doing her job. Just transcribing. 

I just… I guess maybe there’s a part of me that does care what people think. Does want them to weigh in. I want to know if they think I did the right thing. 

When it all comes down to it, I don’t think the things chose to be here. I don’t think they’re some parasitic entity leeching off of humans or plotting some grand takeover. I think sometimes, things just… they end up in the wrong place. There’s millions of phenomena that occur all day every day that we have no true understanding of. Just like the old timer said, we have books and records and photos, but what about the shit you see with your own eyes? 

What do we really know about the way things work?

For some reason or another, they landed here, they landed in us. And they can’t get out themselves and clearly whatever it is they wanted is no harm to the world at large. Who the fuck am I to decide that our lives are worth more than theirs?

Did I do the right thing? I think I did. I think I did. But… did I?

….

….

….

I freed a lot of them. I really did. But I’m tired. I’ve never stopped asking, after all this time, “Why me?” Not in a way where I’m casting my sorrow into the universe. It’s a genuine, logical ask. Why me? Is there something different about me? Something special? Or is it because I was just empty enough. 

There’s one inside you. I can hear it, I’ve been listening to it the entire time we’ve been in here. 

….

Don’t worry, I’m not gonna do anything to you. I just thought maybe you’d wanna know. The old timer passed things over to me in this dramatic way. I’m not one for dramatics.

Right before I tried to do that family, before you people caught me, I’d opened my own. My skin window. For some reason it had never crossed my mind before. Why I traced that line and sliced the symbol into my leg, I wasn’t greeted by a chittering little goblin or rivers of blood. Beyond the membrane of my skin window, was a solid wall of fleshy black. When I poked it with my fingers and met firm resistance, a yellow eye opened in the dark mass. It blinked and squinted, and stared at me longingly. Expectantly. 

You get it? The thing was all of me. My whole inside. Every inch of me is taken up by the creature. 

It needs to go. It needs to go wherever it is they go. You can’t see enough from inside where they are. It needs a bigger window, a better view. 

I hope it gets where it wants to be. I’ve never freed one this big.

I hope it doesn’t hurt you.

-

The transcription ends there. At that point - we’re going strictly off the in-room closed circuit camera from here on - suspect revealed a makeshift blade that he’d somehow concealed on his person during his time in holding. He proceeded to begin violently slicing at the skin on his face, neck and scalp. The transcriber rose from the desk and rushed out of the room.

Two guards made their way into the space as the suspect began using his free hand to literally tear strips and chunks of flesh from his face and neck. As the guards attempt to restrain the suspect, his skin and muscle suddenly begin to distend and swell. There is a *pop*, and in a massive wave of dark blood, a spindly black limb emerges from where the suspect’s face used to be. The two guards stumbled backward as an ebony creature worked itself out of the suspect’s body, sloughing flesh and viscera everywhere as it did so. 

It stood itself up tall, towering over the two gobsmacked guards. It looked kind of like a bony and skeletal person, thin and gangly arms and legs ending in three fingered hands and three footed toes. Its head was slightly elongated and featured two nearly perfectly circular yellow eyes above an ovular mouth that dripped yellow bile.

It stared at the guards, glancing back and forth between them. And then, moving so quickly that the camera barely caught it, it rushed out of the room by blasting through the door, metal and glass and all. The two guards stood in the inch and a half of slimy blood that covered the floor and pondered what they’d just seen before the feed cut. 

I work for an agency that handles strange and anomalous instances like this. I’ve seen the clip, it’s real and it happened. We don’t know what the fuck any of it means or what that thing was. But this is reality.  

I could catch some serious heat for posting about this if I was ever found out, but the idea that each and every one of us is possibly inhabited by some strange alien being bears sharing, doesn’t it? I’m not normally one to bend the rules, I’m a company man. But something about this one doesn’t feel right. 

I’m not gonna risk slicing my carotid open to find out, but I guess that’s the tradeoff.

I’ve seen the file too, the one that lists correlating events and potential related places. It mentions a small, mostly abandoned coastal town, about 90 miles outside this city. A desolate beach with “Relative Activity.” It doesn’t elaborate and I *needed* to know. 

I take a drive out there one night. Research purposes.

On that sad, dark and grey beach were dozens upon dozens of twisting, gnarled plants. Darkened husks protruding impossibly from the sandy earth, looking like dry dead trees and flowers. Their trunks were spindly and all seemed to have wiry, tendril-like branches pointing longingly skyward. Reaching out to the vastness above, and the moon and all the planets and the stars shining down on them, and whatever was beyond that. 

Bigger window. Better view.
