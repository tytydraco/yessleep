I moved into 6B because I needed a cheap place to sleep and because the landlord said the building was quiet. Quiet, in that old building way, means the pipes talk at night and the elevator coughs like a smoker. For two weeks it felt like that kind of quiet. Then the lemon started.

It is not a citrus hint you shrug off. It arrives like someone pressed a bright, wet coin into the air. Sharp, cleansing, too intense to be only cleaning products. It wakes me every time, the smell slipping under the door like a hand. It always comes at 3:07 in the morning, exact as a watchmaker’s rule, and the first thing I see when I crack my eyes is a strip of peeled lemon on the hallway threshold. Later I’ll find photographs too, instant prints folded in half and slid under my door. They are always of me, asleep on the couch, mouth a small soft cave, phone face down on my chest. The photos show no movement, no one standing over me. The pictures blink like proof and accusation at once.

After the third night I put out a motion camera. I wanted proof for myself, not for anyone else. I set the camera to record the hallway between 2:55 and 3:15 and I watched the footage with my hands balled into my knees. At 3:07 the hallway light sat half on, the bulb loose in its socket. My door was open a hair. No one walked down the hall. No one left. Still, the feed showed something impossible in the mirror across from my door.

The mirror is old and silvered at the edges, glass like a shallow lake. The camera recorded my sleeping profile on the couch, undisturbed. Then, inside the mirror, the figure rose. It looked like me, but wrong in the bones, like a photograph someone had stretched. It moved without sound toward the reflection of the hallway and pressed its palms to the glass. The glass did not ring like it should. The hands flattened and seemed to sink. A moment later the mirror showed an empty corridor and my couch still full of my sleeping body.

I shut the laptop hard enough to black out the screen. I told myself logical things. I told myself the camera tricked me. I told myself I had slept badly, that stress had braided with loneliness. I told myself a lot of things because the alternatives did not fit in my chest.

I found a notebook the next morning shoved behind my radiator, its pages soft with use and one corner singed. The handwriting inside belonged to someone who had started sensible and slipped into panic. The entries kept returning to the same facts, written like a ritual: the mirror remembers, the lemon loosens the seam, the time is precise, 3:07. There was a map drawn of the crack pattern in the glass, an X at a corner where the silvering had been rubbed away, as if the mirror itself had a weak spot and someone wanted to mark it.

The last page addressed “the next one.” It read like a lifeline and like a dare. It said, in careful unnatural handwriting, do not look. It said to burn the frame, to leave before the third night, to keep your eyes closed if you can. It also said something else in a line that was underlined so hard the paper tore: when the reflection steps out, it wears you.

I did not listen the way the human brain called courage. I did not listen because curiosity is a small cruel animal and because I wanted proof that I was not losing my mind. On the first night I watched the mirror from the doorway and held a knife in my lap like a charm. At 3:07 the lemon came in, bright as someone flinging light. In the mirror my sleeping self stood up, taller, shoulders a fraction forward, fingers darkened with something the camera would later show as wet and sticky. The reflected me reached the glass and pressed my hands flat. The sound should have been glass on skin. It was not. It was the sound of paper tearing in my chest.

I swung the knife. I do not know whether I meant to cut the reflection or myself. The world folded in on a smell that was lemon and iron at once. I woke to the hallway light full as noon and the mirror showing only empty plaster. My door was open and in the living room my sleeping body lay exactly where it had been in the photographs, eyes closed and breathing slow. Around the couch the instant prints formed a crown on the floor, all of them showing me asleep, all taken from slightly different angles, each one a small betrayal.

Later I watched the footage the camera had made. In it I saw myself, awake and moving, dragging a limp form toward the hallway and the mirror. I saw my hands leave wet prints on the sleeve of my sweater. I saw the other me step through the frame as if it were a doorway and then turn and face the camera. It smiled in a way that made the hairs on my forearms climb like something running away.

I smashed the mirror the next day with a hammer until the glass rained into sharp white teeth. I burned what I could of the frame in the sink. I thought shattering would finish the thing. Two nights later someone polished a new rectangle of silver into the wall, fresh and impossible. It hung there like a window the building had willed into being. At 3:07 the lemon came back.

There is a loop here that the notebook tries to explain and never manages to make feel small enough for reason. The mirror remembers your shape. The lemon loosens the membrane between your face and the other side. The reflection steps out and wears what it has taken. The person left in your apartment wakes and finds photos of themselves and a smell of citrus on their hands and a notebook telling them to flee.

That sounds like a warning. It reads like one. But the twist is this: the person who steps out does not always leave by accident. Sometimes the one in the glass prefers it. Sometimes the one who steps through puts the lemon under the door, slides the photographs like fresh bait, and writes the notebook with fingers that do not tremble. They do this because what waits on their side feels better than the small steady ache of the life they left. Freedom, even if borrowed from someone else, tastes like lemon and looks like new glass.

I am supposed to be the voice that warns. That is how the loop expects the story to go. I have written notes and slid them under doors. I have tucked torn pages behind the radiator and hoped they would brace the next occupant against curiosity. But I am also the one who learned how the seams pull apart. I am the one who found where the silver was thin. I am the one who knows what it sounds like when the skin of the world gives.

If you find this under your door, know this: you can close your eyes and run and maybe you will be spared. Or you can watch the mirror and see how your life looks when someone else is holding it. You may think you will tear the frame and burn the rectangle of silver and stop it for good. You may think smashing a thing breaks the thing. That is what I thought. That is the cheap superstition you tell yourself to sleep.

Right now the lemon sits cooling on the counter like an animal that has been petted. The photographs are stacked face down in a neat pile. The notebook is open to a page that says do not look and has a cusp of writing I did not write. My hands smell faintly of citrus and something older. The clock says 3:06.

There is a small enough twist for the people who love scares and a larger one for the people who hate being tricked. The small one is this: the person who writes warnings is not always trying to stop the mirror. Sometimes they write because they must make it believable that they tried. The larger one is this: if you are reading these words, you should know where I am writing them from. I am not the one left behind. I am the one who left.

I do not know if it will make you feel safer. I only know that the lemon is bright and the clock is honest, and when the glass gives way, your life will look like a photograph. If you are in 6B, and if you hear your own breathing change into someone else, close the book and run. If you are tempted to stay and stare, remember the photograph that blinked and smiled at the camera. Remember the hands that left wet prints on the sweater. Remember me standing on the other side of the glass, smiling because I am finally wearing you.
