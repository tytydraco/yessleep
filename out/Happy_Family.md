Have you ever had an experience that is so visceral and surreal that it follows you every day for the rest of your life? One that makes you second guess or hesitate doing anything that may put you in the same situation? If you haven't already guessed, I have.

I was very down on my luck at the time, no job, no family (that i was close to), and subsequently, no home. My days consisted of moving around, being as I was homeless at the time I didn't stay in one spot for very long. I'd had a nasty break up with my then-girlfriend and left with nothing more than a backpack with some clothes and a blanket. I didn't even have a phone.

One particular day I decided to move on to another town, yet I had no specific destination. I simply picked a direction, and carried on my way. I found myself walking along some back roads that took me further and further into bum fucked nowhere, with only the occasional wooded areas every couple of miles on either side of the road. I wasn't even sure how long I'd been walking, but night fell and the road in front of me was getting dark.

Any source of light was obstructed by thick storm clouds that made it difficult to navigate. There was no telling how far the nearest civilization was, and if that wasn't bad enough it soon started pouring rain. I pulled my hood over my head and trudged through it. I'd begun to worry that I'd be walking for several hours before reaching any semblance of shelter. I hadn't seen a car pass for I don't know how long.

I kept pace as fast as possible until I came across what looked to be a house that I spotted through a clearing of thick trees. I contemplated for a moment, not sure what to do. Eventually I decided it would be best if I tried to see if I could hunker down, at least until the rain dissipated. The house was pretty far back into the trees down a narrow dirt road. As I approached I saw that the one story house seemed old and run down. I noticed the shutters on the windows were closed.

I reached the porch and knocked, to be honest I was a little nervous about who I might encounter out in the middle of nowhere, where basically anything could happen. There was no answer so I knocked again. I waited for a couple minutes before hesitantly turning the knob.

As I entered I was met with the smell of stale air and it was pitch black. "Hello?" I called out. "Anyone home?" Silence... I felt a long the wall until I found a light switch, though nothing happened when I flipped it. I shut the door to keep the rain out and let my eyes adjust to the room. I squinted through the darkness, surveying the living room, it was rectangular in structure.

To the far left sat a small couch with an armchair across from it, separated by a coffee table. Across from me was a doorway leading to what I presumed to be the kitchen, and directly to my right was a coat rack. Aside from the furniture, the rest of the living room only consisted of a bookcase, and photos that hung loosely from the walls.

Hoping that maybe the electricity was only briefly knocked out by the storm I searched for a breaker box. In the kitchen was a door that led to a basement. The only other door was the back door, which was boarded up as well. "Great." I thought. "The breaker box would be in a creepy basement of a house that was tailor made for horror movies."

I cautiously descended the creaky stairs as I struggled to find my footing in the darkness. The basement was filled with random boxes as far as I could see, along with a few baskets full of clothes. I spotted the breaker box and tried to flip it. To my disappointment nothing happened. I sighed, gathering that no one has lived here for a while. I found it odd, however, that it seemed as though most of the occupants' belongings were left behind.
