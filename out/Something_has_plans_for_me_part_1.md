It started with a feeling—a strange, unshakable sensation, like I was being watched. At first, I thought it was just my imagination. After all, I’ve always been a bit of a paranoid person. But then, small things began to happen. My keys would disappear from the counter, only to show up in my jacket pocket hours later. My phone would ring, but when I answered, there’d be nothing but static. The sense that something—someone—was out there, pulling strings, started to grow stronger.

One night, I woke up in the middle of the night to a soft voice calling my name. It was faint, almost like a whisper in the back of my mind. At first, I thought it was a dream, but when I sat up, fully awake, I could feel it—a presence in the room with me. The air was heavier, colder. The voice came again, this time more insistent. “Come.” That’s all it said. Just “Come.” My heart raced as I scrambled out of bed, my body frozen between fear and curiosity. I couldn’t explain why, but something in me was drawn to it, pulled by an invisible force that I couldn’t resist.

The following days blurred together. I found myself doing things I didn’t remember agreeing to, walking down streets I didn’t recognize, talking to people I didn’t know. It was as though I was being guided—led by an unseen hand. At first, I thought I was losing my mind. But then, I found the notes. They were tucked inside my jacket pockets, always handwritten in a neat, precise script. The notes would say things like, “You’re closer now” or “It’s time.” The strangest part? They were addressed to me, as if someone—or something—had been planning every move I made for weeks.

One night, I arrived at an old, dilapidated building on the outskirts of town. I wasn’t sure how I got there, but the moment I stepped inside, everything fell into place. I could hear the whispering again, only this time, it wasn’t a voice. It was more like a hum, resonating deep within my chest, vibrating through my very bones. The walls seemed to close in around me as I walked down the hallway, each step guided by that invisible pull. At the end of the corridor, there was a door. And on the door, a note: “You’ve done well. Come inside.”

I don’t know what’s inside that room. I don’t know what’s waiting for me. But somehow, I know this: Something has plans for me. And I’m not sure I’m ready to find out what they are.

I hesitated in front of the door, the humming sound now vibrating in my head like a heartbeat. The note was still fresh in my hand, but it was almost as if the words had melted away in my mind, leaving behind only a feeling. A sense of inevitability. This was the next step. I could feel it in my bones, deep in my chest. I didn’t understand it, but I knew I couldn’t turn back.

With a deep breath, I gripped the handle and pushed the door open. The room inside was dim, lit only by a single, flickering lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. The air was thick with dust, and the floor creaked underfoot as I stepped inside. The walls were covered in strange symbols—shapes I couldn’t quite recognize, but they seemed to pulse with a faint energy. A chill ran down my spine, but I couldn’t move. I was rooted to the spot, drawn to something at the far end of the room.

There, in the center of the room, was a chair. It was old, weathered, with straps across the arms and legs. And in that chair, sitting as if waiting for me, was a figure cloaked in shadow. I couldn’t make out any features, just the vague outline of a person—or something else—shrouded in darkness. My heart pounded in my chest, and I wanted to run, to flee, but my legs wouldn’t listen. I was being pulled forward, like a puppet on strings.

“You’re late,” the figure said, its voice a low, gravelly whisper that sent shivers through my entire body. I didn’t speak, couldn’t speak. I was paralyzed, trapped in whatever force had guided me here. “But we’ve been patient with you,” it continued. “We’ve watched, and we’ve waited. You’ve followed every step, every twist of fate. You’re ready.”

For a moment, I thought I might faint, or perhaps I was already dead. This was no ordinary dream or nightmare. This was real. But before I could process the full weight of what was happening, the figure stood up slowly, its presence overwhelming. “You’ve been chosen,” it said, its tone colder now, almost final. “To become part of something greater.”

Suddenly, the symbols on the walls flared to life, glowing with an unnatural light. The air grew thick and charged with energy, crackling like static. The room was alive, and I was at its center. My body shook as the voice continued to speak, growing more insistent, more commanding.

"Now, sit." The figure motioned toward the chair, and against my will, my legs began to move. I tried to fight it, but my body obeyed, walking toward the chair as though it had a mind of its own. I sat down, the cold straps tightening around my wrists and ankles as the figure leaned closer. Its face still obscured, but I could feel its gaze, burning into me.

And then, as if the moment had been waiting for this, it spoke one last time:

"Tonight, your life as you knew it ends. Welcome to your new reality."

I stood there for a moment in the quiet, my breath slow, the remnants of what had just happened still swirling in my head. The weight of it all—the transformation, the ritual—pressed down on me like an invisible hand, suffocating my thoughts. I looked down at my hands, still trembling, and then at the door, the exit. The world outside was waiting. But nothing felt the same anymore. It was like I had crossed a line, stepped into a new reality where I didn’t belong, where I wasn’t me anymore.

I stumbled out of the building, each step heavy, my body still reeling from whatever force had altered it. The night air hit me, cold and sharp, but it did nothing to shake the feeling that I was being watched. The world around me was still the same—quiet, suburban streets, dim streetlights, distant sounds of traffic. But I knew better now. I wasn’t the same. They were still out there. And they were waiting.

I made it a few blocks before I stopped walking. My breath was shallow, my chest tight. That voice—the one that had guided me, the one that had led me into that room—echoed in my head again. “You’ve been chosen,” it said. But this time, there was something more to it. A finality. A purpose. I was part of something now, something bigger than I could ever understand. And I could feel it in every step, in every breath. I wasn’t free—not truly. Whatever plans they had for me, I had already become a part of them.

I looked up at the sky, the stars barely visible through the haze of city lights. For a brief moment, I thought I saw a shadow moving across the moon, a figure, too large to be real. But before I could blink, it was gone, as if it had never been there at all. The chill in the air grew colder, biting into my skin, and I realized: I wasn’t just walking through the world anymore. I was walking into it, as if I had been placed here for a reason.

I didn’t know what they wanted, or who they even were, but I knew one thing: whatever had happened to me, whatever I had just become, was just the beginning.

I walked out of the building and into the world that had once felt familiar. But now, it felt alien—like I didn’t belong, like I was a part of something else now. And as I took my first step out of the building, I realized one thing with terrifying clarity:

Whatever plans were made for me… they were far from over.
