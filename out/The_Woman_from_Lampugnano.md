# **The Woman from Lampugnano**  
*Posted in r/nosleep*  

---

I work in an emergency room just outside Milan.  
Night shifts are quiet until they aren’t -- until someone walks in carrying the kind of story that sticks to your mind like static.  

That night, she came in around eleven.  
**American passport. No luggage. Eyes like cracked glass**  
Her jeans were dirty from travel, and she kept glancing at the door like she expected someone to follow her in.  

> “I just got off a Flixbus from Germany,” she said.  
> “Someone injected me with something at the Lampugnano stop.”  

That’s not the weird part.  
The weird part is how calm she was.

We took her vitals. Normal. Reflexes fine. She looked exhausted but alert, calm, and terrifyingly coherent.  
When I sat down to talk, she spoke perfect English, every sentence clean, deliberate — like someone used to being ignored but determined to be heard anyway.  

She said she’d been **kidnapped as a child. Not for ransom, not for custody disputes. Not once — repeatedly.**  
By the same people.  

> “They’re part of a trafficking ring,” she told me.  
> “They took me when I was four. They always brought me back home without marks, so my parents thought I was making it up.”  

I tried to keep my tone neutral, writing notes, the way you do with possible psychiatric cases.  
Then she told me she’d married one of them.  

> “He was part of it all. I didn’t know. We had three kids. They’re gone now. Killed.”  

I remember my pen freezing mid-sentence.  

Her story shouldn’t have made sense — but it *did*. Too much.  
Names, places, embassy visits, police reports — all recited like someone reading their own case file.  Always the same pattern: disappearances, threats, poisonings.

When I checked later, some of it matched — French police had indeed logged reports under her name.  
Filed. Closed. *“No evidence.”*

She asked for bloodwork.  

> “They poisoned me with arsenic three weeks ago,” she said.  
> “Now they’ve injected something else.”  

Her labs were clean.  
But one of the nurses swore he smelled **bitter almonds** while changing her IV.  
Cyanide.  
He laughed it off, but he didn’t sleep the next night.

Around **3 a.m.**, she started talking about **Ukraine.**  

> “If I volunteer,” she said, “they’ll give me a five-year residence permit. I’ll finally be safe.”  

When she reached into her pocket, I thought she was pulling out a passport.  
It was an old **U.S. diplomatic ID.**  
Expired years ago.  

The agency printed on it didn’t even exist anymore — dissolved after a trafficking scandal the State Department quietly buried.  

I didn’t say anything. I just kept writing.

At **4:12**, I went to call the psych ward.  
**No beds.** None in all of Milan.  

When I got back, her bed was empty.  

Just an open window. The curtain fluttering.  
A hospital gown on the floor, beside a small white cloth damp with something we couldn’t identify.  

Security footage? **Gone.**  
Four minutes missing. Cameras froze at 4:07, came back online at 4:11.

Two days later, I got an envelope in my locker.  
No sender.  

Inside:  
- My own ER report  
- Her wristband  
- A note written in shaky blue ink:  

> “They poisoned me again.  
> If I die, they are not imaginary.”

The hospital archived the incident as *“voluntary disappearance.”*  
The report vanished from our system a week later.  
When I asked about it, administration said it must’ve been a *file error.*

That was last year.  

Sometimes, when I finish a late shift and drive past Lampugnano, I see a woman standing by the Flixbus bay.  
Same coat. Same pale hair.  
She doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink. Just scans the crowd.  

Once, I swear she looked right at me.  

And I felt it — that same cold certainty from that night:  
maybe she wasn’t crazy.  
Maybe she was running from something real.  

And maybe, whatever it was...  
**found her first.**
