So, it's been a few days now and I've noticed some strange things. I mean apart from the actual fucking rapture happening, leaving me (as far as I can tell) the last man on earth. Well, the last sane man on earth. I think I'm sane anyway... 

Admittedly I did spend the first, let's say roughly 36 hours, in a drunken haze. I remember going through cycles of crying myself to sleep and laughing at my predicament until I passed out. Needless to say, I was not in the best state of mind. But then, what would you do in my place? Think you could handle it any better? 

Actually, the only reason I eventually sobered up was that I ran out of alcohol. I woke up late Thursday morning with a pounding head and a swirling gut. I stumbled my way to the bathroom of the small house I had been renting with my girlfriend. She was gone now, just like everyone else.  

As I leaned over the toilet, voiding out my insides, I felt the reality of my situation creeping back in. Not long after, the shakes started up. I flushed and hurried to the fridge; I needed a drink before I broke down again.  

I flung open the fridge door and felt my stomach drop. There was nothing left, no beer, no wine, nothing. I screamed in frustration as I slammed the door closed. “God Dammit!” 

I tried to compose myself; I really did. Instead, I broke down again.  

When I was done with my momentary pity party, I grudgingly decided it was time for a supply run. We needed groceries badly before... all of this, and along with the drinking I had done quite a bit of emotional eating as well. Half a bag of stale Fritos, the rest of mine and Jens leftovers from the pizza place, and several bowls of cereal with questionable milk. So, I threw on my bathrobe, climbed into my truck and headed to the store.  

My local grocery store would have beer and frozen food. But if I went ahead and drove 15 minutes to the next town over, they had an actual liquor department in their grocery store. That seemed well worth the drive to me.  

On the way, I cycled through radio stations, hoping and praying to hear a voice, even if it was just some prerecorded message. But there was nothing on, nothing but dead air. I couldn't stand the silence, so I reached under my seat. After a bit of fumbling I found my CD case and slid in one of the discs. It was an old mix I had made in high school. Metallica, Radiohead, Black Sabbath, and Nirvana. I swerved and weaved between stalled cars on the highway as Creep blared through my truck speakers, loud enough to wake the dead. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking. 

About 10 minutes later, I pulled into the parking lot of the big grocery store. Not worrying about the shopping cart crunching under my wheels, I backed right up the door of the store and stepped out onto the empty lot. I noticed a small dog a few yards away, sniffing at a dropped purse. It was a corgi, and it wore a leash the same shade of pink as the purse.  

I started to walk on into the store but hesitated. If the dog ran off with the leash still on it could get tangled up or trapped. Maybe if it was friendly I’d keep it. After all, I was alone now, and dogs are supposed to be man's best friend, right? 

I stepped over to the dog, which eyed me curiously. “It's okay girl, I'm gonna take care of you now.”  

But as I got closer, the dog lunged back, snarling and barking. “What the hell?” I thought. I had never had a dog respond to me like that, I love dogs, and they usually love me. Maybe she was just freaked out from what was happening, I knew I was. 

“Easy girl, I'm not gonna hurt you.” I said softly as I crouched down, trying to seem unthreatening.  

The dog barked and snarled as it backed further away. But it couldn't go anywhere very fast. The leash was actually fixed to the heavy purse.  

As quick as I could I reached down and grabbed the purse, pulling the dog towards me and into my arms. It snarled and snapped trying to bite at my face, but I managed to get the collar unfastened. I dropped the dog and stepped back, watching as it took off running and yipping in fear.  

“Poor thing” I thought. “It must be terrified.” I watched it continue running as fast as its little legs could carry it, until it disappeared around a corner. With that over, I turned and headed inside the store. 

I was glad the power was still on as I made my way down the aisles, I hadn't even thought about bringing a flashlight. That thought led me to wondering, how long would the power stay on? With no one to maintenance the grid, it would only last a couple days, right? Maybe a week tops. I decided that however long it was on I was going to enjoy drinking my beer cold while I could.  

I was halfway through a six pack when I made it to the exit, my cart filled with booze, hot pockets, and various other unhealthy items. I even had a carton of cigarettes, I don't even smoke, but I figured now was probably one of the best times to start. 

I was in the middle of wondering if and where I could find some drugs, (I had never done any drugs before, aside from a little pot when I was younger) when my eyes caught something across the street. It was the mall, the same mall where I had met Jen. “Jen...” I felt a hitch in my chest as the pain started up again. I bit down on it and downed another beer. I looked at the mall again, shaking thoughts of her from my mind. The food court had the best soft pretzels in the state. I sniffed and pulled a bottle of Kentucky bourbon from my cart and headed across the street. 

Walking through an empty mall in the middle of the day is... unsettling. After raiding the food court for the now very hard pretzels, I stumbled aimlessly from store to store. I rode the escalators up and down over and over again. There was evidence that people were here. I saw plates of food unfinished on the food court tables, bags of purchased items littered all around the floor, and a few abandoned strollers. What happened? I mean really, What the actual fuck happened to everyone? And why hadn't it happened to me?  

I looked up at the roof skylights. “WHY!?” I shouted. “WHAT DID I DO?” I screamed to a God who had clearly abandoned me. I was answered only by my own voice, echoing through the empty mall.  

About half of the bottle was gone when I stumbled into the movie theater. I found myself wishing I knew how to run a projector, there were a few movies on here I wanted to see. But at the time I was too far gone to even attempt figuring it out. Instead, I filled a bucket of popcorn and made my way into one of the auditoriums. I plopped down into what I thought was the best seat in the house, absolute center of the theater. I stared up at the blank silver screen, thinking back to all the movies I had seen here, with my dad, with my friends, with Jen. Tears burned in my eyes as I ate my stale popcorn and drank my bourbon. 

 

Sometime later I woke up and didn't immediately know where I was. The dim theater lighting seemed strange and alien. I climbed to my feet and let the empty bottle I was holding clatter to the floor. Suddenly I remembered, it all came back in a flash. I was alone and just like that, I felt the shakes coming on again. 

I left the mall and made my way back to the grocery store. The frozen food I had collected was now a soggy mess. I wondered how long I was gone. Checking the clock on my truck dash I realized it was quite a while. It was 9:26AM. I had left my house around noon, yesterday. I shook my head and started to chastise myself for my degenerate behavior, then shrugged it off. Who the fuck would care now anyway, there was no one left to judge me. After another round of grocery shopping, (more booze and hot pockets) I climbed back into my truck and headed for home. 

When by some miracle I made it back home in one piece and unloaded my supplies, I remembered something. The dog from the grocery store and the way it had been stuck on the leash. I knew that some of my neighbors had dogs and cats, and I still kind of wanted a pet. At least then I wouldn't be completely alone. 

I made my way around the neighborhood, checking the houses for trapped pets. Some were already gone from when I had broken in before. But the others... They reacted to me exactly like the dog from the store. Mrs. Smith's chihuahua was terrified of me. The Ryan’s golden retriever snarled at me like it wanted to bite my head off. I couldn't understand it. Those dogs had always been so friendly. I had brought Churro home to Mrs. Smith after he ran off dozens of times. And the Ryans always walked Goldie around without a leash. Their behavior, even under the circumstances, just made no sense. Unless... The lyrics to the song I had been listening to on the way to the store came back into my mind. “What the hell am I doing here?... I don't belong here... I don't belong here.”  

They knew. The animals, they knew. Something is wrong with me. I don't belong here, not anymore. I finished making my way around the neighborhood, propping doors open. The animals could come and go as they pleased. I wouldn't bother them. 

Finally, I made it back to my house and stepped inside. With nothing else to do, I threw a hot pocket into the microwave and started in on the next case of beer. 

I hadn't realized that I left my front door wide open, not until I heard the noise of something scuffling slowly across the floor. I felt a momentary spark of excitement, thinking that just maybe one of the dogs had calmed down and sought me out. I stepped around the corner to the front door and froze. The blood in my veins turned to ice water. It was a man, he was bald, broad shouldered and wearing a dirty, rumpled grey suit. And he was standing on all fours, staring up at me like a deer in the headlights. I wanted to speak, to ask him who he was or where he came from or what happened to everyone else or any of the dozens of other questions I’d had since this started. But I couldn't find my voice, and even if I could, I didn't want to. In that moment I was more afraid of him than I was of being alone.  

We stood there staring at each other, neither of us daring to move. Then the microwave dinged, and the man went into a panicked frenzy. He screamed in a deep throaty howl as his face contorted in anger. I began to back away but then he lunged at me, his fingers hooked and his teeth chattering. I screamed and fell back hard onto my ass. I scrabbled back out of his reach as he pounced at me again and again. But I couldn't get away. He grabbed me slammed me back against the oven causing a cast iron skillet that I had used and never washed to fall to the floor. I reached for the skillet with my right arm as I used my left to keep his gnashing teeth away from my throat. As I felt my fingers fumbling the handle of the skillet into my hand, my left arm erupted into a white-hot pain as he bit down on my forearm, shaking his head side to side like an animal. I swung the skillet with all of my strength, bashing in one side of his forehead. Blood spattered across the floor as he let go of me and whirled away trying to find his balance.  

I quickly stood and brandished the skillet in front of me like it was Excalibur. “Come on motherfucker! You want some more!” I shouted. Hoping I sounded more confident than I felt. In truth, I was petrified, I felt like I was about to pass out. Luckily for me, he didn't want any more and quickly ran out the door, still on all fours. 

I ran over and slammed and locked the door, gasping for air. I watched him through the window as he made his way to the woods behind my house. The whole way, he kept on shooting angry and confused looks back at me.  

 

Later, as I sat on my bathroom floor, I examined the bite he had taken out of my arm. The teeth went deep, and the bleeding hadn't yet stopped. There was about a quarter size chunk of my arm meat missing, I felt sick thinking about where it was now. I had a brief moment of concern about turning into whatever he was but dismissed it. That shit only happens with zombies, right? He didn't seem like a zombie, didn't really seem all that human anymore either. I thought about that as I disinfected and wrapped my arm with gauze and tape. There was something in his eyes, something primal, something feral. Thats when it hit me, there was no humanity behind his eyes, no soul. They held intelligence sure but more like a savage and cunning intelligence. Like a predator. He looked at me exactly like the animals did, with fear and confusion.  

I didn't drink any more that night. I went to my closet and pulled out my grandfather's hunting rifle, a lever action 30-30. If he came back, I’d be ready.  I'm not as alone here as I thought. And I don't belong here.
