"Fuck this," Dave yelled, sprinting for the front door. He grabbed the handle and tried to wrench the door open, but it wouldn't budge. He started booting the door and screaming, but nothing happened. He was having a full-blown panic attack, and I feared the contagion would infect us all.

"Dave! Dave, relax. We're gonna be okay," I said, trying to get a hold of the situation.

"No, we’re not," Art said, "This isn't a mere specter. This is demonic."

"Oh my god," Maggie said as she sidled up to me. She was shaking. I found her hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze.

“I don’t fuck with demons,” she whispered.

"We don't know if it’s demons," I said.

Art stood up and made his way toward me. "There is a blackness here. It's enveloping all of us. Don't you feel it?"

"No," I said, but then I felt the bottom of my feet start to tingle. "Wait...the bottom of my feet are…."

"Mine too," Maggie whispered. "What the fuck is going on?"

"It's entering our bodies," Dave said, hyperventilating. "It's going to eat our souls!"

"It's getting our attention," Art said.  

"It's got it," Maggie said.

There was another rumble, and we braced for an aftershock. But it didn't come. The rumbling was some invisible figure stomping down the hallway toward us. We all huddled together and collectively held our breaths.

The smell of death came wafting into our nostrils. Whatever this thing was, it was in dire need of a shower. The unseen creature stopped in front of us and started to growl. Maggie's shaking was worse, but she still managed to record what was happening. I remember thinking, *Damn, I admire the commitment to the job*.

The creature roared in front of us, and we felt it. As the peak of the roar, the sound dropped away, and every door that led to the backyard flew open. The dark house was suddenly thrown into blinding daylight.  

We covered our eyes with our hands, trying to adjust without permanently ruining our vision. I pinched the bridge of my nose, opened my eyes, and let them adjust. Through the haze, I saw a figure standing in the doorway before us. At first, I couldn't make it out, but then I heard her scream and knew who it was.

My eyes finally started working again. I saw the screaming figure turn away and run into the backyard. I followed behind it. Maggie, still holding my hand, came with me, followed by Art and then, reluctantly, Dave.

I could see the backyard paradise in front of me. But, as soon as I crossed the door's threshold, the world outside was replaced with an inky black that made everything around us disappear. We weren’t in the backyard anymore – we were in a void. The only other thing here that we could see was the Quia house.  

I looked back and could see the inside of the big house behind us. It was like we stepped into another dimension. That realization shook me to my core. I felt a sudden need to turn and run back into the big house, back into our world, but the door behind us slammed shut.  

We were trapped in the void.

"You're the expert, Art. What do we do?" I asked.

"I...I don't know. I’ve...this is….what happened can’t….” He continued on in that manner for a few seconds before trailing off. Dave was just whimpering. Maggie was silent and recording, but she never let go of my hand.

There was a loud clunk behind the front door of the Quia house, like a heavy lock had been released. The door slowly swung open, and the squeaking of the hinges dragged on like a bad movie. I thought someone might walk out. Instead, I saw the cloaked figure holding a candle just inside the house. Next to him was the screaming figure. It looked like a woman but I couldn’t be sure. I remember thinking, *where was the woman in the white and yellow dress?*

"They're waiting for you," said a familiar voice behind me. I turned around and was stunned to see Marsha standing in the big house's now open doorway.

"Marsha?" I asked as if my eyes were lying to me. "How are you here? Aren't you supposed to be with your mom?"

"My mother died years ago," she said, walking past our group of gawking onlookers. "She was murdered and her land stolen from her."  

“What?” I said, utterly confused.

She grinned at me. “There never was a Marsha, John.”  

*Zombie snails*. Fuck, Art was right.  

As she strode from the big house, the door slammed behind her. I heard dozens of locks snap into place. We were stuck now. "This can't be possible," I said.

"And yet, it is," Marsha said. The years melted off her body with each step she took toward the Quia house. She was de-aging in front of our eyes. Stranger, her whole body changed. Marsha, the older white woman who hired me, was unraveling. Her skin was nothing more than a costume.

By the time she stood on the porch of the Quia’s house, Marsha as I knew her, was gone. In her place stood a Hispanic woman in her early twenties. Her eyes were red with rage.

"You're part of the Quia family?" I said, putting words to all our thoughts.

"You may have killed our bodies, but you've never been able to destroy our spirit," she hissed.

"We didn't do anything to you," Dave yelled.

"No, but you'll pay for what your ancestors did to us just the same."

"John, what do we do?" Maggie whispered into my ear.

I didn't have an answer...until I felt the rock in my pocket. I wrapped my hand around it and decided I had only one option. I was going to Nolan Ryan this fucker into Marsha's face.

I reared back and hurled the stone as hard as I could. As it left my hand, it felt like the perfect throw. Every mechanic in my arm snapped the way it was supposed to, and the rock felt true as it left my hand. I didn't think it would kill her, but I thought it'd give us time to scramble away.

Marsha raised her hand, and the rock stopped mid-air and fell into the darkness.

"That's going to cost you," she said with a grin. "That's going to cost all of you." As she said that, her form changed again. She grew three feet in the blink of an eye. Her arms elongated like coils of cable. Those long ropey arms had blades jut out down her limbs like porcupine quills. Her hands ended in sharp, needle-like points. She unhinged her jaw, and the maw dropped two feet. Her teeth grew until they were nothing more than six-inch razors.

We were going to die.

"If you let me go, I promise I'll give my housekeeper a raise," Dave whimpered.

Just then, Art moved in front of us all. Even though he was long and lanky, he looked like a child next to this monster. But his face was resolute and confident. Any doubts he expressed earlier vanished. He looked as transformed as Marsha.

"You aren't the Quia kin," he bellowed. "The true Quia girl has spoken to me! You are nothing more than a parasite! A lapdog of Beelzebub! I call down the power of God above to strike you down where you stand!"

Nothing happened. Marsha started laughing. It boomed all around us. I squeezed Maggie's hand, and she squeezed back. I wanted to die knowing someone cared about me. I wanted her to know I cared about her, too.

Art raised his hands and uttered something in a tongue I didn't know. A shaft of bright white light came crashing down around Marsha like Zeus had tossed a thunderbolt. She screamed in pain. Art turned to us, his face racked in pained concentration, and yelled, "run!"

I looked back and heard the locks on the door back into the big house unlocking. The door swung open, and I locked eyes with the woman in the white and yellow dress. This was the woman who had warned me to leave. This was an actual ghost of the Quia family. My savior. The parasite had never been able to catch her. I nodded thanks, and Maggie, Dave, and I rushed through the open door.  

I turned back and yelled for Art, but he was locked in a struggle with the monster. I heard him scream something else in that native tongue, and there was a blast of white light all around them. I was blown back three feet and slammed into the nearby wall. Before I could see what had happened, the door slammed shut.

The ground under us roiled again, worse than before. This was a big quake. I scrambled towards Maggie and covered her with my body. The entire house shook for what seemed like an eternity. After a minute, I opened my eyes and saw the devastation all around us. The big house had severe structural damage, and we had to leave before we were buried under the rubble.

Before I did, though, I had to look in the backyard. I had to see if Art was okay. I stumbled to the door and whipped it open. Everything look liked it had returned to normal. There was no inky black void, monsters, or mysterious candlelights – just the sprawling gardens.

One thing that had changed, though. The Quia house was gone. It was not knocked down or damaged from the quake but completely removed like it had never been there. Maggie joined me, and we stared at the yard in silence. All around us, emergency vehicles screamed, but in this little oasis, we stayed quiet.

After a few, Maggie whispered, "Art?"

"He's not out here."

She turned into my shoulder and started to cry. I hugged her and let her sob. I started crying too. This was easily the worst *Taskr* job I've ever taken. I decided at that moment it would also be my last.

Dave popped out and saw us. He said he was going to go home and wished me luck. I didn't respond. I heard him shut the front door as he left.  

We heard another rumble and thought it was another aftershock. It wasn't. The big house, weakened by the quake, collapsed in on itself. Maggie and I dashed deeper into the yard to escape the rubble. We left the property not long after.

I never got paid, which shouldn't be a surprise. However, I didn't need the money because I had found a new roommate – Maggie. The trauma of the experience had drawn us closer together, and we both realized that our reunion was something special. She called it fate and I couldn’t disagree. She had converted me, finally. We're going strong to this day, though her paranormal investigations have halted for now. I can't blame her.

Art hasn't returned, but we still hold out hope that he will. If nothing else, we owe him our gratitude for saving our lives. I have no clue what happened to him or what power he called or anything. I'm not sure I want to know. Whoever said ignorance is bliss must've lived through a traumatic experience.

Marsha's body was never found. She was one of the countless dead lost to the quake. With no surviving kin, her property is up for sale. In this market, someone will snap it up quickly. I hope they retain nothing from the old house save for the guardian angel that patrols those grounds. Other than her, burn that place to the ground and start fresh.

A few days later, Maggie and I were lounging on the couch when she remembered she had taken footage of the whole encounter. She had forgotten she had recorded anything in the hubbub of the quake, the haunting, and Art going missing. She pulled up the video files, and every single one was nothing but a silent black screen.

Except for one.

In the last video, right before it ends, there's a crackle, and someone whispers a phrase. There's heavy distortion and audio noise, but you can hear a voice speaking. Maggie thinks the person is saying, "Don't forget me. You can get me." I'm not that optimistic. What I hear is something a bit more sinister.

"The door is open. We'll get you."
