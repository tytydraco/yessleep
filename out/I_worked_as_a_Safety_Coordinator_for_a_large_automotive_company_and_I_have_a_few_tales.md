I used to work as an Safety Coordinator for a large automotive repair company. For the most part, it was extremely boring. It’s a lot of paperwork, some walking around, typing long reports, and answering questions from managers and employees. But I was recently talking to my old boss when I got the idea to write about my atypical experiences, the ones that I completely forgot about until she reminded me just a few hours ago. So, as a fan of this site, here is my contribution:

\--

I was covering a different market up north in the Adirondacks, the definition of rust belt towns. And for the most part, it was same-old same-old. Questions, weird flirtatious behavior from men twice my age, and the travel in between locations. The fall colors in the mountains made the whole trip; I don’t come from a very mountainous area with this many trees. I remember the leaves fluttering down in various shades of red and yellow when I pulled into one shop, the first of the day. And immediately I was hit in the face with the strongest smell of industrial solvent ever smelled outside of a containment room. Solvent is extremely volatile and corrosive, prone to catch fire and knock people unconscious with its vapors. Smelling it outside could mean the spill containment was punctured and the ground I was standing on was one match away from spontaneous combustion. 

The building itself looked fine. Small, maybe six employees, not brand new but not built in the fifties either. Painted tan, and the company logo out front, “Superior Collisions” in a blue monochrome. My eyes were watering from the solvent when I went inside to chew out the general manager. The office was better than outside, and I grilled the general manager over the smell. He reported the painter used water-based paint, and used very little solvent. The solvent smell wasn’t coming from them, but the local EPA couldn’t locate the source either. The letters from the EPA office showed the same information, so I dropped it and we completed his assessment.

The following quarter, at the same location. Same solvent smell. It so far had been a fairly snowless winter, only a few inches compared to the several feet of average seasonal snow. Still, the solvent had melted a few patches in the ice, all of it on the black top of the driveway. I brought this up to the general manager again, and like before he showed the letter and report from the local EPA showing no known source of the solvent and no chemical on their facility that could possibly be what was on the ground outside. He stated they were installing cameras in the driveway to investigate, but they would have to wait for the end of month to pass. He suspected one of the body men doing personal car work in their lot after hours, abusing the space. Once again, the walk went by without a serious issue.

The third time, there was no solvent smell. It was a strong stench of rot, like a thousand roadkill corpses stacked on top of each other in smell. The entire area behind the building was cordoned off by police tape and the facility was closed. I gave the general manager a call, to which he didn’t answer. I gave his regional a call, and he filled me in. Apparently the body men, those that do body work on the car, had performed ritual sacrifices behind the building every week for the past few months. A pit was dug and bodies were flung in with other parts of desecrated animal carcasses. They were covering up the rot smell with large amounts of solvent, which slowly leaked into groundwater. EPA were able to definitively track it to the source and launched a full investigation, which led to the discovery of the bodies. The whole building was a crime scene, and all three body men were under arrest awaiting trial. I’m pretty sure the manager went to jail too, I remember hearing that it was him buying the solvent after all and scoping the customers for easy targets. I don’t know what happened with the case, but the building was demolished and the area, from what I was told, still smells like solvent.

Another weird case happened shortly after I started at the company. I was going to my former boss’s shops around the DC area when we were tasked to open a new center somewhere in east Maryland. This one was huge, thirty employees and multiple buildings, one with an upstairs office. The problem we came across was a door that wouldn’t open in the second building paint department. The painter, an older guy with white hair and thick hands, mentioned he hadn’t opened that door in fifteen years and had no intention of opening it now. My boss was a brash and fearless woman, and asked for a key or assistance prying the door open. Again, the door wouldn’t budge and no key would fit into the lock. The painter became irate at this point, stating we were breaching his privacy and it was a private room. Now, OSHA can come into your workplace and they can search areas that the company owns, but they can’t search employee cabinets or personal effects. An entire room belonging to an employee is ridiculous, but the general manager agreed and asked to not search it this time around. The painter was asked to clear the room prior to the next visit, and we moved on.

Six months later, I was asked to assess the facility since my boss was busy at the time. This time, the room was open and accessible. Really there was nothing in it, just a rug and a table. The manager said the room was changed into a temporary break room while the actual break room was under construction. Fine with me, and we went to leave before I noticed slight scratch marks in the wall. Then more and more of them. Long, scraggly marks that appeared in rows of five, some looked recently painted over and some extremely deep. I asked about them, and both the general manager and painter shrugged them off. Design choices of the eighties, they said. 

About a year after I left the company, my boss called me. The painter had converted an unknown paint booth into a spare room and covered the ground to hide the grates. He would then bring unknowing people into the space, close the door behind them, and turn on the booth. It doesn’t get too hot, only about one fifty Fahrenheit. He liked listening to them scream and beg to turn the heat off, then would defile the dried carcasses. When we went in for the opening, there were still bodies in the booth. The only reason the manager ever found out about it was because he flipped the breaker and nearly cooked a detailer. The painter was arrested, his house was raided too. They found several of the dried corpses there. He sprayed clear coat on a few to preserve them longer, he had them hung in the closet nice and organized. He offed himself in prison before the trial ended.

Repair shops are a lucrative business in the states. There are at least a hundred thousand repair shops in the United states, twelve thousand are in Texas by itself. But every manager will tell you a good body man is worth his weight in gold. The industry when I was working was struggling to find body men, trade jobs were seen as secondary jobs and mostly consisted of old heads. Really old heads. 

I was down in Texas when I met a body man that was ninety-three years old. Originally, I thought he was joking. The man spoke fondly of his profession, showed me pictures of his grandchildren and great grandchildren. He even had a great-great grandchild on the way! How he was still doing back-breaking work was remarkable to me, and gave him the nickname Superman. I saw Superman every quarter for about two years, still trucking along and with the same vivacity. Until one quarter, when I noticed he looked different. He seemed to be graying, and his skin hung loosely to his frame. I tried to talk to him but he seemed far away, and answered in a series of grunts and would not look away from the vehicle he was sanding the filler dust off of. I brought it up to the manager, but he said Superman gets like this sometimes. It was just the time of the year when they got swamped with work, everyone is on the grind. I let it go, and expected Superman to bounce back next quarter.

Next quarter came, and Superman looked worse. His skin was more gray, dry and cracking around his neck. He had his welding hood on and moved slowly underneath the car. I asked if he felt better, and he didn’t respond. The manager again said they were swamped with work, and not bother him; he was in a bit of a mood. Superman stayed under the car the whole time, but I hung around in the office and peered at him through the window. I wanted to ask him what was actually going on; was he sick, was there a problem with the management? I watched as he crawled out from under the car and took off his welding hood. I swore to my manager when I told her that he was missing his lower jar, his face was mummified, and he only had one eye that he peered at me before putting the mask back on. She told me to stop trying to scare her during Halloween. I chocked it up to sleep deprivation.

The next quarter, Superman was gone. He died shortly after my visit. The manager said he really held the shop together, and the building wouldn’t be the same without him. He died in the shop, a dedicated worker through and through. It was the painter who told me he had crumbled into dust before his eyes, now scattered around the building like the body filler dust. I didn’t believe him, honestly, but I was especially careful to wash my hands after that visit.

I feel this is a good place to stop for the time being. I might have some more after I see my old boss next week.
