Throwaway for obvious reasons. I’ve tried posting about this on other subs (different accounts) but the posts always get buried or disappear. I know someone here will believe me.

I work for NordGen. We do monthly inspections of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. It’s basically a doomsday backup for the world’s plant/crop life (frozen seeds stored in case of catastrophe). I've been doing this for six years. It’s routine: humidity checks, air pressure, frost integrity. Nothing weird. I do it with a colleague named Eivor from Crop Trust.

I’ve been doing inspections with Eivor for a few years now. He’s a good guy. Smart, calm, easy to work with. We occasionally hang out after shifts, grab food, shoot the shit.

Last month during a standard inspection, Eivor veered off. Said he had to check something  and walked through a steel door I *swear* I’d never seen before. Before it closed, I caught a glimpse of an elevator. Just a single button: down.

I finished my duties and waited. I’m not allowed to leave without him. Ten, maybe fifteen minutes passed. Eventually curiosity got the better of me. I opened the door and pressed the button.

It took a while, and when it finally opened… the smell was *vile*. Not cold storage or mildew — rot. Meat left in the sun. The elevator had a full panel: 31 sublevels. I’ve never been told there was *anything* below the vault chamber. The seed banks are all accounted for in the public schematics. So what the hell is all that space for?

I backed away. A few minutes later, Eivor came out looking pale, like genuinely sick. Like he’d seen something awful. He looked at me, locked eyes, and mumbled something.

I said pardon?? He spoke just a little louder this time, but trembling.  
*“Did you see the elevator?”*

I hesitated, which made it abundantly obvious. I didn’t even get a word out before he screamed, “HE KNOWS. HE KNOWS. YOU FOOL!”

I just stood there, frozen. He’s never raised his voice to me. He’s always been calm, cheerful. We’re friends for fuck sake! This wasn’t him.

As we exited the tunnel, I tried to apologize, to ask what was going on. He didn’t look at me.

I said “EIVOR! Just talk to me man, please!”

He turns towards me, head down, and whispers. Whispers so quietly I could barely hear it.

One word: “Draug.”

My whole body tensed. Heart raced immediately. That word… I hadn’t heard it since I was a kid. My brother used to try and scare me with those dumb old Norse ghost stories *Draugr, the dead who walk beneath the ice.*

What the fuck is beneath the vault? Are Crop Trust in on it? Or just Eivor?

I can’t sleep, my mind is racing. Not sure when I’ll get answers though. My supervisor called last night; says next month’s inspection is postponed. Eivor is missing.

As I’m finishing typing this, I see a delivery guy pull into my driveway. Park on the street you fucking asshole.

Envelope. No return address. Inside: just an unlabeled flash drive. Am I dumb enough to put this thing in my computer?
