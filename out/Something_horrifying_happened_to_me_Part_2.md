So as i was getting closer to the house to take a good look of it, the old man appeared again, but this time he had the burn marks on his face. I was shocked when i realised that he could be the father that was burned in this house. But that was impossible, was it? 

I started to think that i was going insane. I ran back to my house and thought what i saw and combined everything. Somehow it made sense but i had to be sure. So i called my friend Jake (from the first part) and he came to my house immediately when i told him what i saw. 

He ran too my room and i told him every little thing. About the connection of the old man with the father that was burned, the burn marks on his face and the special connection with the house. After i told with alla that he suggested that we go there and explore the place. But i remembered the words of the old man and told with that we can't go. But i was so curious about that place that i wanted to see what's inside. So we went out that night. It wasn't a school night so my mom was sleeping like a baby and didn't notice that we got out. No lights outside, only our flash lights. It was cold and we had to hurry. We approached the front yard. The old man wasn't there so we ran to the door. 

As we opened the door, i was sweating with fear. Then we heard something coming from upstairs and Jake told me that we go check it out. I was more than sure that we would die that night. As we went up the stairs chills were running through my spine and we were terrified about what we'll discovered up there. When we reached the top of the stairs, we heard another noise coming from one of the bedrooms. Then we saw it. We saw it running from one room to the other so quick and then it stopped. It stopped at the hall and was starting to get close to us. The light from the moon was enough to see that this thing had nothing on his face. We didn't get to see much because we ran out of the house and there he was the old man was in the front of the house. I was more terrified than before and confused as well at that moment. We ran past him and went into my house and straight to my room. We could sleep at all that night cause we discussed what had happened.

How was the old man in two places, or he wasn't. Then i remembered again his words and one specific word ' devil '. Was that what we saw the devil himself roaming the house. I tried to calm down but the memory was coming back into my head. I couldn't forget that and I can't even now. In the morning my mom came into my room and saw us already woken up well see thought. She gave us a cup of orange juice and she went to work. We again wanted to see what was in that room. 

We went out again that morning and found the old man in the front. He tried to stop us and that time we listened to him. He said something to us that got our interest. 

He was a young man when the house caught on fire. When he saw what was happening he tried to help the poor father to escape the fire but he was hit by the roof which was on fire and that's how he got the burn marks. He was unconscious when the firefighters found him on the floor after the fire was stopped. The last thing that he remembers from that day was that moments before we fainted, he saw a shadow above the father in the basement. The shadow did something to the father and the next day it was all over the news. The father was dead. We couldn't believe what he said only listen to the next horrifying part. He said that after the family moved out of the house, he went to explore the place. He didn't found anything in the basement but he found something in the upstairs bedroom. The family had a cross on the wall that had the father's initials written on it. He told us that people say they saw the devil in that room when they went to explore like us and most likely that what we saw yesterday was the devil himself. After he had finished saying all that we couldn't believe in our ears. Then we ran back home and we stayed in my room for the rest of the day. 

When my mom returned he told Jake to go to his house because his parents were worried about him. He didn't have a choice than to go home. 

That night though, as i was sleeping, i woke up in 4:27 and couldn't move at all. I had heard about that its sleep paralysis. Although that wasn't just sleep paralysis. I saw something moving in the corner of the room and i realised that i couldn't speak. I screamed but no one heard me. The shadow was moving closer to the bed. And then i saw it again.
