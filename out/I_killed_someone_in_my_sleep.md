It was a nightmare and it started out with my family and I driving home. Something didn’t feel right in the car. On either sides of the road were endless carnivals; I could hear the music playing. Nightmares were common for me when I was 16 yrs old. Sometimes my bed would shake too. This one felt like it was going to be the worst one of all.

My family pulled in the driveway and I felt evil all around me. I did not feel safe at my home in this nightmare so I started up the stairs to my room. I remember the air got so heavy I was afraid to turn around to see what was behind me so I didn’t. I proceeded up the stairs to my room and that’s when I saw him sitting on my bed. It seemed male but I really couldn’t be sure. It looked like Satan with red skin, yellow-green eyes, and horns. He was very large and I was immediately petrified at the sight of him. I thought about pissing myself so I would wake up but I knew he wanted something.

“Sit down Kate,” Satan said.

Then he showed me a vision; a baby dressed in red that had just been born. I thought maybe the baby had been born around Christmas but now I know the baby was born the day after Valentine’s Day.

“This baby gets cancer. Will you take her place?” Satan asked me. Then he showed me the little girl’s family, her parents, and that they vacationed in the Outer Banks, NC. I could see every detail in the vision. I thought about it, I’m not going to lie but I didn’t want to die yet. I knew if I traded places with the baby, the cancer diagnosis would be immediate and I would not live much longer. 

If I knew what I know now, my answer would’ve been different. Even though she was a baby, I would most likely never know her and no one would have to know what I did. It’s not like I would be caught. Back then, I was an extraordinarily selfish person.

“No,” I told it.

“Very well then,” Satan said and then the evil thing disappeared. 

I forgot all about the dream for 15 years until I was married with kids of my own. They were happy days and both of my daughters loved playing with their cousins. Their favorite cousins were Mitzi and Alonna. 

One day while we were spending spring break together Mitzi had a pain in her side that wouldn’t go away. She was 16 yrs old, and yes it was cancer. I couldn’t believe it. The nightmare had been real. She lived until she was 20, another 4 years. Mitzi was born on Valentine’s Day in 1996. I felt so bad. It felt like I caused it. 

I wish I could go back and change my answer. Back then I had things to live for, friends and family but now all the people I loved are dead. People I cared about dropped like flies after that nightmare. 

I took a life for no reason at all. Nowadays I’m alone. I don’t have friends anymore, my husband died and my family.

I didn’t know the nightmare was real. 

I wish I could go back and make it right but I can’t. 

Mitzi is dead and I watched her suffer. That was hard. 

It should’ve been me that died, not her.
