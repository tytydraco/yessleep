I grew up in a rural area of Michigan where the town was peaceful enough at night for a walk. I would invite friends over, play tabletop war games and spend my money on some cookies and soda at the local store. Nothing made my day more than late night journeys and dice rolling but I never went alone. I was told the usual safety tips and behaved rather well so my dad let me do whatever as long as I didn’t do drugs or go to parties. 

It wasn’t until my junior year of high school that I figured the town was safe enough for me to walk by myself after dark to the local dollar store and things went just fine the first few trips. 

One night though, I took my usual route which was through the residential area as much as possible before getting close to the store and little did I know that it would ruin my sense of safety and security for the rest of my life. 

I went outside, walked through the familiar neighborhoods and could hear the faint sound of a dull thud followed by a bell jingle. It was just a few times on the way there so by the time I bought the cookies and soda, I’d forgotten about it. After getting outside it felt as though my body didn’t want to let me leave the comfort of the lights in that parking lot. I looked around and saw nothing out of the ordinary. There were the regular night owls going in and out of the shops nearby as I worked up the courage to walk back home. *Slap slap slap* came a rushed noise behind me along with the slight jingle from before. I once again checked my surroundings and saw the street lights dimming. I knew the town was cheap and stingy but this seemed like a new low. 

As I now turned on my phone flashlight, I heard a giggle following my every step. The hair on my neck was on end at this point and my track skills were about to be tested as I turned behind me to see… absolutely nothing. There wasn’t a single soul nearby other than myself. The pitter patter of thuds and bells continued as I turned back and picked up my pace. A giggle here and there seemed to be stifled as the noise traveled back and forth behind me seeming to be some person getting a kick out of setting a teenager on edge. 

I decided the jingles and giggles had gone on for too long and I was at least halfway home by now. That’s when I turned and saw the sad excuse for a stalker dressed in an ill fitting colorful checkered unitard with shoes that had bells on the heels.

His gait was something he didn’t choose for himself as his legs seemed forced apart with a spring in his step and then the heels clicked together to ring the bells. His face was adorned with dark red almost rust colored paint into a forced smile despite his actual mouth being in a frown as if to confirm his actions weren’t his own. As he came closer, it sparked something in me telling me this was life or death no matter my pity for the heel clicking fool. 

My limbs went numb as I sprinted for dear life back home feeling a cold chill on my neck despite my scarf and hood. It was as if I struggled with my own body in those initial moments after seeing the character but within a minute, I was able to continue unabated with him growing smaller in the distance. As I made it home I made sure to lock the door and sprinted up the steps to my room throwing the covers over my head. A few thoughts ran through my head like, “What was his plan for me? Would he be able to track down where I live? Will I ever be able to walk alone at night again?”

My questions were answered the next morning when news broke that there was a woman my same height and hair color dangling lifeless from a bridge with all of her vital organs removed despite no signs of a gash. They had apparently been removed via the throat. My heart pounded in my ears as I saw a little bell ringing by itself just like the heel clicker’s by the bridge that day on a mid day walk.
