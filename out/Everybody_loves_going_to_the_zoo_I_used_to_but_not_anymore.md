I always loved going to the zoo as a child. I was such an animal fanatic, particularly the big cats. I know, it's a cliché, everybody loves them, they're one of the biggest draws of any zoo. I mean, sure, you got your pandas or other rare and endangered species that can act as a big enticement to get your customers in, but people rarely hold these animals in a special place in their hearts. If an animal is rare then you rarely encounter them, so you don't build the same connection. To me, watching a tiger or a jaguar skulking through its enclosure moved me in a way no other animal could.  


I, therefore, quickly came to the decision that when I was an adult I would want my career to take place in a zoo so that I could be around these animals all day. The drawback - I was not really the brightest kid. There was no way I was going to get into a good college and continue my study into animals and zoology. Add to that, zoo jobs are incredibly sought after, so I was always going to be facing some pretty stiff competition if I wanted to be a keeper or tour guide. There just wasn't enough going for me.  


What I did have, though, was incredible patience. I could sit in one place or stroll around the same route over and over again and not lose my mind at the boring repetitiveness of it all. So, that was my way into the zoo industry – I got a job as night security for the Redmane Zoo. It wasn't the best paying job, and there wasn't exactly much of a ladder to aspire toward – I could basically get to supervisor and then my climb was done. Still, I got to do what I wanted, so what more could I ask for?  


The job was fairly simple. There were four of us in total. Three of us – Daniel, Aisha and myself – would patrol three different sections of the zoo. We would switch up these roles every month or so to help prevent the job from getting too repetitive. The last one of us, Hakeem, stayed in the main office with the CCTV feeds and watched us moving around. His was by far the cushiest job, but technically you had to observe all three zones, so it was therefore was reserved for the supervisor. That said, I didn't care if Hakeem's job was technically easier than mine, I got much more enjoyment walking around the enclosures.  


Now, if I'm being honest, it wasn't the most exciting thing to be moving around the zoo at night and I did feel a bit let down once I got the role. Most animals are not left out in their habitat during the evening, with most of them, especially the larger ones, being coaxed back into smaller individual cages to sleep. Whilst sleeping, they didn't need to be able to move around as much, and it protected them from the elements, so this was definitely preferable from and animal welfare point of view, y'know. Additionally, it ensured they didn't get up to any mischief while no one was around to keep an eye on them or stop them. I guess that, as a keeper, you didn't want to come back in the morning to see one of your males had hit maturity and decided to make a play for the alpha position, or had just gotten bored and picked a fight. That had the potential to become quite an… unpleasant sight.  


All in all though, I was satisfied with my job: I got to be outside, I stayed healthy from my constant walking, and did get to look in at some of the smaller, nocturnal animals every so often. Plus, being an employee of the zoo did earn me free entry, so I could go during the day whenever I wanted, assuming I was awake enough to do so. I probably could have done that job for the rest of my life. That was until last night. Now, I don't think I'll be able to go back to a zoo ever again.  


I had arrived at the zoo by 9pm, ready to start my shift. I often arrived a bit early so Daniel and I could chat and talk about nothing in particular, normally a football game or something like that. Aisha arrived right on time and was a more closed off, she never really talked with us a whole lot. I think she did the job because she found the quiet and solitude somewhat meditative, so our presence sort of ruined that calm. We didn't mind, it didn't affect us, so we kept out of her way. We collected our equipment from our dingy office, talked our nonsense, then set about making our way out into the zoo.  


I was stationed in Zone 1 this night, so I was looking after our aquatic and ape sections. This was a pretty easy zone to make it through compared to the others, given that a fair bit of our aquatic section was indoors and, therefore, we just checked to make sure it was locked every so often and then left it be. So I spent most of the time moving through the ape section, which was constructed to be high up, the windows looking into the enclosures from behind the glass in small viewing stages. During the day, you would see gibbons, as well as colobus and spider monkeys, swinging around the various cables and branches there to stimulate them and give them a taste of home. In the middle of the night, it was just and empty jungle. All the monkeys made their way into their dens to rest out the night, so instead all those branches simply bobbed in response to wind whenever a gentle breeze drifted through. I stared into the enclosure of the gibbons, trying to see if I could glimpse one sleeping, but all I could see was the twisting of wood and leaves hanging limply. I couldn't help but be disappointed - even after 2 years of doing this job and knowing full well that there was going to be little chance of seeing anything ever, I still held out hope every night.  


But as I kept moving around the enclosure, I noticed a slight movement, more than the gentle breeze should have been making. I tried to squint into the enclosure to get a better look, but it being dark the squinting only seemed to make it more challenging. There seemed to be some sort of silhouette against the dark. I couldn't see it all that clearly, but I could feel it. It was watching me, whatever it was. I had been trying to avoid shining my torch on it since, given how much I wanted to see animals at any point during my job, I didn't want to scare off the first one I saw the instant it was finally there. But I became more and more uneasy the longer I stood there looking at that shadow. Eventually, my nerves wore down enough that I had to see what it was. I lifted my torch at focused onto the dark creature. As expected, the moment the torch shone on it, it leaped to another branch and out of sight. I didn't get the best look at it, but it was definitely a monkey of some description. Something was off about it though - the colouring was off, as if it was somehow paler than what I was expecting? Less brown, more… tan? Pink? It was hard to figure it out in such a flash of time.

 

I heard a crackle of static slice through the night. I jumped a little bit, the sound coming in being completely unexpected and me already on edge, though I was beginning to feel there was no real good reason for that. We didn't often talk with each other on our routes, and any messages that came through to us were normally Hakeem asking us to check on something he had seen looking at the monitors, which was normally a bit of rubbish blown by the wind that he had only caught a glimpse of. Rarely was it anyone. I grabbed the walkie-talkie and held it to my head to hear clearly. It was Aisha, which surprised me, her voice definitely being the last thing I expected to hear coming out of the tiny speaker. She was asking Hakeem if he could see anything odd around the brown bear enclosure. He questioned her about what sort of thing he should be looking for, but Aisha just replied that she wasn't sure, she just felt there was something odd there.

 

I rolled my eyes listening to this. I felt Aisha was coming off quite dim in this particular exchange, and knew Hakeem would be frustrated with her vague response, though he would still do his due-diligence and check his monitors any way. As expected, there was nothing, and you could hear the tone of bitterness in his voice as he told her this and reminded her to keep the channel open for actual emergencies, not "feelings". I felt so awkward having heard the exchange. It was never pleasant to listen to a full grown adult be told off as if they were a small child.

 

I continued on with my route, letting the serene uneventfulness go unabated for about another 20 minutes, when I heard the walkie-talkie static once again. And again, it was Aisha, but now she sounded quite panicked. "Hakeem, there is definitely something here, I can hear it following me! And I swear I could hear laughter a moment ago." Hakeem went silent and checked his monitors once again. Not at all to my surprise, he replied that he didn't see anything, but you could hear there was no irritation in his voice this time. We had always known Aisha to be quite stoic, so I think hearing her becoming somewhat frantic was enough to melt Hakeem's heart and have him give her a more sympathetic ear.

 

Hakeem asked me if I could go check out her location since the bear enclosure bordered on Zone 1 and therefore put in the best position to assist her. To be honest, I think I was being sent more to console her rather than check anything out. Though if she was genuinely hearing things that weren't there, I thought she would probably need someone with a bit more psychological training than I had to actually help her.

 

I descended back down the ramp out of the ape enclosure and began to make my way the short distance to Aisha's position. As I passed the aquatic house once again, I began to hear rustling and the crunching of leaves headed closer toward me. I pulled out my flashlight and pointed it into the bushes, only to see a trio of figures look up at me, whisper loudly some sort of profanity, and push their way deeper into the garden.

 

I was originally a bit frightened when I heard the rustling: Aisha had worked me up with her panic, but after seeing the intruders I was now just annoyed. People being here meant that something had indeed gone wrong on this shift, but there likely wasn't anything dangerous or threatening about it – the most plausible explanation was that it was a bunch of teens who thought that they would dare each other to break into the local zoo. Not really something that I would have to concern myself with too much, but it would mean I would need pay extra attention and stay late after my shift to write a report, so still a pain in my ass. I picked up my radio to let Hakeem know that I just seen a couple of troublemakers and he let out a sigh that showed he experienced the same level of frustration about this that I did. He told me to do my best to follow them and find where they had gotten to, then told Aisha that she could relax, it was just a bunch of kids, she didn't have to worry herself into a frenzy.

 

I stood there in the silence. I could feel my stomach gradually tie itself with anxiety as we both waited for the reply from Aisha. Hakeem came on the line again and asked her to respond. I've heard before of people describing a silence as 'heavy', but until that moment I had never truly understood what that expression meant. Nothing came from the radio. No relieved exhale, no explanation that she had felt so dumb for getting worked up over nothing, not even the crackle of static. Just... silence.

 

I wasn't sure what was the best plan of action here. On the one hand, my duty was to check on the teens and see what they had gotten up to, but I had no idea what had happened to Aisha. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe she had simply forgotten to charge her radio and was headed back to the office now to grab a spare. Maybe that was it. I had hoped that was it, because the alternative was that the people we were now in this zoo with were far more dangerous than I expected. There was definitely an aspect of self-preservation that was causing my indecision. Still, that didn't feel right. If you were someone who had just assaulted or, if we're getting extreme, killed another person, you're not just going to swear and run away the moment someone else spots you. You're going to fight back, aren’t you? I mean, I've never been in the situation, but it just makes sense that once you've committed the crime, why not keep going? Especially when someone had just seen your face - or, y'know, as much of their face I could sight before they quickly fell back into the garden. I dunno, I didn't I really didn't get a violent impression from them.

 

In the end though, I did decide that checking on Aisha was the best call, and I told Hakeem I was going to continue on my way to check on her. If she was injured or in danger, then we had a responsibility to ensure we did what we could to help. If not, well, how much damage could a couple of teens really cause? He agreed, acknowledging that she was not on any of his screens, therefore we needed to get eyes in the area. Daniel also chimed into the conversation, saying he would head closer toward her zone to take a look as well, as it sounded like there was a chance we could need some extra numbers to help deal with a situation.

 

The journey over to Zone 3 is tensest I've ever felt in all my life. The solitude that I had previously had no trouble dealing with in the past suddenly felt threatening, as if the night itself was just waiting to swoop in at me from anywhere and everywhere. Every empty enclosure now screamed at me that this was not a place I belonged, that I should not be here. Every second Aisah didn't respond just made me want to leave, just get the hell out of there. But if I did that, then I would be blatantly abandoning someone, and I couldn't do that to her.

 

I looked in at the bear enclosure when I arrived, a large open space with sparse trees and rocks, along with a lake for the bears to swim in. As I had expected - and hoped - it was completely devoid of any movement whatsoever. I looked around into the darkness as best I could, trying to see any flicker or slight movement to indicate life. There was nothing though. I called out Aisha's name and waited. I have never felt a pause so unendurable. I needed it to end. I called again, and again. Every time I yelled, I broke the tension, but it just came back even greater each time.

 

I could feel my fear tangibly throughout my body, as if it was hands grabbing onto me and holding me in place. Every step further into that zone became even more difficult, like those hands were trying to pull me back, though whether it helped or hindered me I wasn't sure. A footstep broke through the tension, and then magnified it further. There was someone with me. I didn't hesitate, I couldn't. I grabbed the flashlight and turned to say, essentially screaming at them, "Who's there! Show yourself now!"

 

A hand moving up to cover the face meant I couldn't place them immediately, but the uniform managed to put me at ease once again – it was Daniel, having made his way when he heard me calling with no response. I have never felt so relieved in all of my life, just to not be alone if nothing else. I jogged up to him and it took all the restraint I had to not pull him into the tightest hug I physically could. He, on the other hand, did not look relived. From his perspective, he had heard me calling for Aisha, and he could only see me. She was still missing. The joy that had returned now disappeared so much faster. We uneasily looked around our immediate surroundings, but nothing had changed. She was gone, and we were no closer to figuring out where.

 

I radioed back to Hakeem, hoping desperately that she had found her way back, but, as we had all known, she had not. She had vanished. I asked Hakeem what to do. I knew that this was my job, but I had only ever just walked around, caught the odd kid that broke in for a laugh. I hadn't ever experienced real danger. Thinking at that time felt impossible, as if a physical wall had been placed in my mind, holding back all my ideas. I needed Hakeem to tell me what to do. But the moment of silence that came back told me he didn't know before he even had a chance to say it. He was lost. Daniel was lost. I was lost. We just stood there, the only illumination around us right then were the torches we held pointlessly at our sides. I heard Hakeem say he was going to call the police, but all I could manage in response was a half-hearted acknowledgement.

 

The slightest, most gentle chuckle drifted through the air. I twisted and shone my torch furiously, looking around in every direction to try and pinpoint the source, but there was nothing there. All I could see was a white railing in need of a new paint job blocking the still very empty bear enclosure. Nothing. Then I heard her – Aisha calling out to me. I heard her cry "Help, I need help. \**grunt\** Why isn't anyone helping me?" I felt myself lurch into action, my legs exploding into a run directly forward, but I came to a halting stop almost straight away. The cry was coming from inside the habitat. The utterly and unmistakably empty habitat. Maybe she was right up against the wall? Maybe that is why I could not see her. But wouldn’t she have tried moving to somewhere more visible? I don't know why it was, but I could not bring myself to look. I the whole situation just felt so… wrong. Daniel called back to Aisha, asking where she was, what had happened. He was met with a pause, a moment where I swear you could literally hear the gears churning in the mind of whoever was there, then, it came again, "Help, I need help. \**grunt\** Why isn't anyone helping me?" Word and pitch perfect. We didn't move, didn't even speak. We just turned and began our walk to the main office, quicker than we had ever walked before. Whatever was there, we didn't need to be the ones to deal with it. A shrill, feminine laugh echoed behind us as we made our escape.

 

Then there was a slight pat from behind us as we walked, kind of like footsteps when the person was not wearing shoes. Another and another. It was slow and methodical, each step almost in time with our own. I tried to ignore it, we both did. We tried not to look around. I didn't want to know what had taken Aisha's voice. But it got faster, as if the person who was walking had begun jogging. Daniel and I tried to quicken our pace, but the steps were continuing to quicken. Soon it was running, then sprinting. I couldn't get away fast enough. I turned, only to find that we were still very much alone. Daniel and I didn't need to speak, didn’t need to confirm anything. We ran.

 

Ripping our feet from the ground we ran, ran as far from that enclosure as we could, ran back toward the office, toward the entrance of the zoo, the point where we could get out of this zoo. A scream pierced through the night right ahead of us. A shrill and intrusive call that locked us back down only for a moment. Our heavy breathing was all we could hear in that night, straining our ears to hear any more clue of what was happening. A slight laugh once again from our left, then another from our right, then from behind. We ran again. It kept coming, getting louder and more pronounced. It became such a multitude, a crowd jeering us on, deriding our pathetic attempts to get away from it. The sound hounded us as we continued running. We were being toyed with.

 

The only thing that bought us back to a stop was when it clicked that the thudding of our feet on the asphalt had been replaced by a squelch and the sharp splash of scarlet across our path. Daniel came to a stop and shakily pointed his torch at the ground. The crimson fluid spread beneath our feet, making its slow and steady flow back deeper into the zoo. Slowly tilting the light up, there was a mass lying across our path. The clothes were so torn and the gashes so deep, it took us a moment to actually recognise that it was a person who blocked our way. Once a person, now just a body.

 

It took a moment to notice that the laughter had stopped, only to be replaced by the slow and gentle patting once again, the footsteps growing closer, then further, as the striding passed on our left. I didn’t look for the creator of the sound, didn't move my own torch off the path directly ahead, off the corpse that blocked the road. I instead looked at Daniel, but he was only shaking and crying. "I don't want to die," he whispered through his tears. Neither did I. I kept my torch fixed onto the body, but as the light hung there, a mass of orange and black obstructed the beam, muscles taught and flexing with each step as the tiger strode in front of the body. It worked its way around until it was behind the corpse, then it looked up at us. The widest of smiles spread across its face. I need you to know that I am not projecting when I say this. This is not me pushing my own thoughts of humanity onto this creature. It had an expression of genuinely murderous glee. It smiled a smile so full, so obvious, it was impossible to mistake it for anything else. And I am certain of this, because that smile was full of giant, human teeth. So white, so perfectly straight and square. A complete violation of what I knew to be true about this world. Then, as the tiger stood there, I heard Aisha's voice for the last time as it bent down to pick up the corpse in that repulsively human jaw, though the only movement of its mouth was to bite down on the body, "Sorry, this one is mine."

 

It was several minutes before I finally made it back to the office and to Hakeem. I had stood, shaking, frozen at the sight I had witnessed for god knows how long. I was in such a shock that I only found my ability to move again once the monkeys descended on Daniel. At least, I think that's what they were - they didn't have any fur. The echoing laughter that partnered the raking of Daniel's flesh... you'd think teeth would need to be sharper to tear at skin so easily, but it seems ours work just fine. Hakeem tried to question me about what I'd seen, about what had happened to Aisha and Daniel, but he let it drop once he noticed the bloody footprints I walked in with me.

 

The police tried to question me when they arrived. All I could say was that some of the animals had gotten lose and attacked us. I knew they would not believe the truth, I was wondering if I had lost my mind myself. Based on the heavily mutilated corpses, they were happy to accept that explanation. I was sent home. I don’t know how long that explanation will hold up once they came to examine Daniel's body and found the myriad of tiny human bite marks all over him. I wouldn't be surprised if they just covered it up.

 

I called up the zoo this morning and let them know I wouldn't be coming back. They accepted my resignation with no resistance, and I was told I would get a glowing reference from them. I just can’t be around animals any more.

 

They won't stop smiling at me.
