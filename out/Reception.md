It started with quiet.

I told everyone I was going off-grid for a few days. Said I needed a reset. Time away from screens. “Mental health,” I think I called it. It sounded better than the truth.

The truth was, I was burned out. Pissed off. Couldn’t stand the sound of my own name in someone else’s mouth. The group chats. The “check-ins.” The relentless flood of fake concern. I didn’t want care. I wanted quiet.

So I packed up the truck, loaded Bear in the back, and drove east into the Appalachians. Four days. Just me, my dog, and the woods.

No calls. No kids. No messages. No work. No world.

Silence.

But that was the thing about silence. Eventually, it always broke.

I found a clearing I’d marked years ago—no signs, no service, nothing but moss and air and an ancient pine standing like a cracked totem.

Bear, my old retriever mix, never strayed far. He sniffed the perimeter once, then curled up near the fire. I watched the sky turn melt above the trees and let the quiet settle in my chest.

I figured I’d sleep like a stone.

But Bear didn’t.

That first night, I woke to him sitting upright, ears twitching.

I sat up too.

“Something out there?”

He stared upward at the starry sky, cut apart by waving branches.

I looked.

Three pale lights hovered over the ridge. Bright, steady, and far too still for planes.

For a second, I actually smiled. I remembered the Brown Mountain Lights. People swore they saw them dancing over the trees. Ghost lanterns, they said. Reflections. Static trapped in the air.

I'd spent the better part of my childhood out here and I’d never seen them before.

I realized my phone screen had lit up and the flashlight had turned on by itself.

Bear growled low in his throat.

The light flickered once—then went dark.

“My damn phones messing up,” I said, picking it up and turning on the flashlight to see if it worked.

No service, of course. No messages or calls.

It’d be a good weekend.

When I returned my attention to the sky, the lights were gone.

The second night, Bear wouldn’t eat. Wouldn’t even lie down. He kept pacing to the treeline and freezing like he was listening to something.

I sat by the fire, flipping through old photos on my phone. One of them was of Mom standing next to Bear, her hand on his scruff. I’d taken it the year before she died.

Fog had crept in, rolling low.

Then I saw it—something shifting behind the clouds. Massive. Slow.

A shadow painted against the bright clouds.

Bear let out a bark so sharp it snapped me out of my trance.

The shape was gone.

Bear didn’t stop pacing.

And that night, neither of us slept.

The third day was wrong. The air was stale. My food didn’t taste right. No flavor.

I made coffee and tried to act normal. It tasted metallic.

This was what I wanted.

Quiet.

There were no birds. No insects. Not even wind.

It felt like the whole forest was listening.

That evening, I saw a figure between the trees. Tall. Distorted. Shimmering like heat over pavement. The second I looked straight at it—gone.

But Bear barked once and took off.

I chased him up the ridge with the flashlight swinging wild in my hand.

He stopped just before the edge, staring up at the sky.

I followed his gaze.

And everything broke.

The sky tore open.

Light moved across it like veins of fire.

Then came the sound. It reverberated in my skull.

Voices. Crying. Screaming. Singing.

I don’t even remember running. Just white-knuckle panic and Bear’s tail in the dark.

We made it to the truck. Don’t ask me how.

The engine barely caught. I reversed so hard I lost one of my mirrors on a tree.

The lights were above. A sky twisting like someone’s crappy wallpaper. Just color moving around.

I kept driving.

Bear barked louder and louder.

Twenty minutes later, the phone lit up.

Reception.

Four bars.

Then everything exploded.

Missed calls. Messages. Voicemails. Dozens.

Dad: *How’s the trail?*

Dad: *You feed that dog?*

Anne: *Our son is going to get himself killed.*

Anne: *something is outside.*

I clicked off the messages and opened the voicemails. I played the first one. My sister’s voice.

*“Mason—where are you? Just—please—please call me—”*

Static\*.\*

I played the next, my brother.

*“Mason. Christ man. Get your kids out of Pittsburgh!”*

I nearly slipped off into a ditch. I cursed and jerked the wheel, righting the truck.

*“—Marie! Forget the cat! We have to go! Mari—”*

A crash cut him off, so loud that it fuzzed the audio.

The voicemail ended.

I fumbled with my phone clicking through voicemails.

Anne.

Nothing but sobbing. Broken only by violent coughs and a faint scream in the background.

Then, static.

I dialed Anne’s number as the trees thinned out. And then I saw it—Pittsburgh.

Or what was left of it.

At first, it looked normal. From a distance. Lights. Streets. A faint hum of motion.

But the lights above weren’t normal. They hung in the air, massive and pulsing.

And the people—They were rising.

Dozens of them at first. Then hundreds.

I blinked hard, convinced it was some optical illusion. A trick of distance. Maybe my brain shorting out from too little sleep.

But the shapes were human. Arms limp. Heads tilted slightly. Faces slack.

I gripped the steering wheel so hard my knuckles popped. “No,” I said out loud. “No, no, no—”

Bear whined in the backseat.

I couldn’t stop watching.

And then, they came apart.

Just a sudden collapse into dust.

Hundreds of bodies gone in an instant.

Turned to ash.

It poured.

The first flakes hit the windshield like hail.

Gray.

I turned on the wipers.

They dragged thick streaks across the glass. I could see bits of hair, fragments of cloth caught in the slush. Skin? Teeth?

My stomach turned. I gagged into the crook of my elbow and started rolling up my window.

Too late.

It rushed through.

The stuff clung to everything. My jacket. My hair. The dashboard. The vents started sucking it in, blowing it in my face like cremation on high.

I pawed at the controls, turning off the fan, trying not to scream.

I looked back at the skyline—what was left of it. The lights pulsed again, slow and sure.

And more people kept rising.

I couldn’t breathe.

I couldn’t blink.

The truck hit the ditch and everything spun.

I dangled by my seatbelt, groaning. Nothing really hurt. But everything ached.

Bear shifted around in the back while I reoriented myself.

My phone rang.

Anne.

I stared at her smiling face and answered.

It started with a scream.

Shrill and raw.

I flinched, holding the phone away from my face.

Bear panicked and scrambled against the upholstery, trying to bury his face beneath the seat.

Then came her voice.

Not shaken. Not panicked.

Soft. Sweet. Too sweet.

Like syrup dripping into my ear.

"Mason?”

“Anne, are you okay?”

“No, Mason. They got the house. The boys… they’re…”

“Anne. What happened?”

Coughing.

“Anne.”

“Mason. The boys are gone. They’re in the air. Everyone is in the air.”

I watched the sky.

Gray pouring down.

“It hurts so much.”

“God,” my voice broke on the word. “I’m coming, Anne. I’ll—”

“Naked…. naked I shall return.”

The line went dead.

The quiet returned.

The quiet I wanted so badly.

But now, I knew it would last far longer than I’d ever planned for.
