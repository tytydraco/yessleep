Okay. This is true, and I will accept whatever comes after I post it. Read it if you want. Do not read it late at night if you get scared easily. I am writing this because nothing else makes sense.

Two weeks ago I moved into a cheap little house on the edge of town. It was the kind of place people use for weekends, a weathered bungalow with a porch that creaks like an old jaw. The realtor told me the owner had passed and the estate wanted it gone quick. She gave me the keys with a smile like it was charity. Rent was almost nothing. I told myself it was perfect. I told myself a lot of things.

The first night I noticed the smell. It was faint at first, like something from the back of an attic box, old paper and dust, and under that a wetness that did not belong in a house with two functioning windows. I blamed the gutters, the uncleaned drains. I left the windows open and slept on the couch.

On the third night, I woke to the noise of someone moving in the hallway. Not footsteps, not a knock. Not ordinary. A dragging. It sounded like fabric across wood. I sat up and listened. The sound stopped. I told myself it was a branch. I told myself the wall had settled. I lay down. The dragging came again, this time slow, patient. Close. The hairs on my arms stood up.

I switched on my phone flashlight and walked out barefoot. The hallway was empty. No shoes, no coat rack, no signs anyone had been there. I checked the locks. They were fine. I laughed at myself for being ridiculous. Then I saw the doorway to the basement ajar.

I had not planned to use the basement. It was the sort of place people collect things to forget. The basement light was a single bulb that hummed more than it lit. The air hit me like an animal. There were boxes, old newspapers, a tangle of lamps. On a folding chair in the center of the room was a single thing that made my throat close.

A child’s music box sat on the chair. It was brass, scratched and small, with a painted ballerina frozen mid-spin. The key stuck out of its side. Someone had left it wound. The ballerina turned slowly on her own. The sound was thin and wrong. My stomach dropped. I did not remember seeing the box in the listing photos. I should have left then.

Instead I took the music box upstairs and placed it on the kitchen table, intending to return it to the chair in the morning. That night, the house felt wrong. The couch felt like a stage and I was an actor who had missed his cue.

At 3:07 a.m. the music started. Not from the kitchen, not from the table. From the far side of the living room, where the wall meets the window. The ballerina spun in the kitchen as if someone wound her down with breath. The same thin, sour tune.

I walked toward the sound and the air grew colder with each step. The bulb in the hallway flickered. When I reached the living room I saw the shadow.

It was not a shadow a light makes. It had edges, like a person painted on glass and left to drip. It leaned against the window frame and hummed the last bar of the music with its skinless mouth. It wore my coat. My coat hangs on a hook by the front door. I have never left it in the living room. I have never owned a coat it could wear.

I remember thinking, this is impossible. I remember naming every rational explanation. I remember the clock striking 3:08 and the shadow turning its face toward me. In its eyes was my childhood bedroom, and the smell of the thing was like the basement and like rain on summer gravel and like something dying slow.

I fled. I left the house with my bare feet, the music still playing, and sat on the curb watching through the fogged window as the figure moved about the living room. It opened drawers I had not shown it. It sat in my chair. It read my mail. It folded my shirts. It made no sound but the faint water-skim of the ballerina.

Neighbors called the cops. The cops were kind. They told me no sign of forced entry, nothing missing. They suggested stress. One of them stayed longer than the others and, when he left, he dropped his voice and asked if I had found any old family photos. I said no. He looked relieved and then said nothing.

The next day I found a small envelope tucked under the kitchen mat. My name was written on it in a handwriting I knew like a mouth in my dreams. Inside were two Polaroids and a yellowed receipt. The pictures were of me sleeping in a bed I had not owned in years, and the bed had the same floral sheets as the one in the back room of this house. The receipt was for a music box, bought at a store that closed forty years ago. The seller’s name matched the name in the deed of this house.

The music box had a scratch inside the metal. It was not a mark a machine makes. It was a tiny sentence gouged into the brass. I used my phone to zoom and read the letters. They were not in English. They looked like fingers.

That night I did not sleep. The figure watched me through the living room. When I tried to film it, the camera showed only the room, empty and whited out as if someone had bleached memory. My phone would not save the clip. But the ballerina kept turning.

I stayed for a week after that, telling myself I could outwait it. Each night the figure learned something new. First it learned my kitchen layout. Then the routes I take to the store. Then my voicemail tone. When it finally learned the sound of my laugh, I packed a bag and left and found a motel where the towels smelled like bleach and the TV had no channels.

It followed me that night in my dreams. Not as an apparition. As a polite guest. It made tea and set it on the bedside table. On the spoon it left, in place of a fingerprint, was the tiny gouge from the music box.

I am posting this because the envelope this morning had a new Polaroid. It shows the motel bed. It shows my shoes beside it. The timestamp is from two a.m. tonight. The ballerina in the music box is wound nearly to the limit.

If you have cheap houses near woods. If you inherit. If you buy an old thing. If you find a little brass music box. Return it. Burn it. Bury it deep where roots will chew it. Do not take it upstairs to your table. Do not leave it wound.

I write this with my hand shaking under the yellow motel light. There is a scratching at the door now. The ballerina’s tune stopped for a second. I think it is listening.

If you want rights to this story, be my guest. I cannot sell them. They already own a piece of me.
