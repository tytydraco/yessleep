I don’t how much time I have left to type this up before I lose myself for good, but if you are reading this, I probably already have by now.

Listen. If you live in Terre Haute, Indiana, and see a man with a scar around his neck, then **run for your life.** If you see him and are carrying a gun, shoot him in the head repeatedly until you are absolutely, 100% sure he is dead. 

The person I am talking about is the one writing this post right now — **me.**

On April 10th, 2025, I was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer that results in brain tumors and eventually death. My doctor estimated that I only had about 6 months to live. My family was devastated.

However, the doctor said there might be a solution. I had two options.

I could choose to be admitted to hospice and accept my fate.

Or…

I could undergo a potentially life-saving surgical procedure in what would be the world’s first head transplant performed on a living human being.

The doctor explained to me that if I didn’t go through with the procedure, then my death was guaranteed. On the other hand, If I agreed to get the operation, I had at least a 1% chance of surviving.

Although slim, I decided that a 1% chance of survival was better than guaranteed death, so I agreed to go under the knife. I signed my will on the same day so that my family would receive my inheritance if I didn’t survive the procedure.

As you may or may not know already, the United States Penitentiary — where death-row inmates are held — is in Terre Haute. One death-row inmate in particular, an expert serial killer who was sentenced to death for murdering *thousands* of innocent lives, was given a special offer that would remove him from death row and release him from prison immediately. The consensus was that he had to agree to participate in the surgical procedure by swapping his head for mine, and, of course, exhibit good behavior after being released. 

Despite knowing that his brain would be replaced with my cancerous brain — and mine with his “healthy” brain — he still agreed to participate, as he thought it was better to live free for 6 months than spend decades in confinement while awaiting his execution. Either way, he was going to die.

I asked the doctor if he could simply swap our brains instead of a full-blown head transplant, but the doctor insisted that a head transplant was the only way for it to work. I didn’t like the thought of having to wear the face of a serial killer, but I figured I could just get plastic surgery afterwards.

On the day of the procedure, the neurosurgeon and his team explained exactly what they were going to do; first, they would put me and the serial killer in a medically induced coma. After we both fell into a coma, they would insert a tube that provided a steady flow of blood supply to our brains and decapitate us, leaving my head in a controlled state of hypothermia to preserve it while they worked on attaching the killer’s head to my body. After successfully replacing my head, the surgeons would attach my head to the serial killer’s body. Finally, since we both had each other’s brain, the surgeons would infuse my original brain cells into my new brain, while the serial killer would receive his brain cells. This method ensured that we would still be ourselves, as it allowed us to keep our memories, characteristics, personality traits, etc.

Miraculously, I survived. However, the serial killer wasn’t so lucky, who only lasted a few hours before his body rejected my head. When I woke up from the procedure, I saw the dead killer next to me, wearing my lifeless head as he lay slump on the chair. It was a disturbing sight, to say the least

Shortly after, I received plastic surgery to reconstruct my face back to normal. You almost couldn’t tell that I was wearing someone else’s head, except there was a scar that wrapped around my neck. Besides that, I looked and felt great.

But then, things started to go south. **Fast.**

One day, I could hear a voice in the back of my mind, like someone else’s thoughts were inhabiting it — almost as if I were sharing a consciousness with another person. It whispered horrible things related to death, murder, and bloodlust.

*“Kill them,”* the voice whispered. *“Kill them all. Let them know pain.”*

A bit worried at first, I shrugged it off and dismissed it as an intrusive thought. I convinced myself that an increase in these “intrusive thoughts” were just a temporary side effect that would eventually go away.

But they never did. They became louder and more frequent. But most of all, they became more and more disturbing each day. The voice described how it had killed hundreds of thousands of innocent adults and children in great, morbid detail.

Then, one morning, I woke up to find myself unable to move my body. I thought I was paralyzed, but suddenly my body bolted upright on its own. Then my legs moved themselves off my bed and walked me towards the kitchen, controlling me like a puppet.

Confused and afraid, I tried to call out for help, but I couldn’t speak either. All I could do was watch through my own eyes as if I were looking through a window, trapped and helpless.

*”I am in control now.”* the voice hissed.

I involuntarily opened a drawer containing utensils and grabbed a large steak knife. The thing that possessed me then guided me to my bedroom where my wife slept peacefully, unaware of the events that were about to unfold. I screamed bloody murder in my head as I slowly approached her with a firm grip on the knife.

*”Die! Die! Die!”* the voice shouted as I watched myself stab my wife in the chest dozens of times.

I wanted to close my eyes so badly, but my eyes were forced wide open. Blood splattered all over the bed and seeped through my wife’s pajamas as she took her last breathes, a sight I will never be able to erase from my memories.

I begged for mercy as I walked into my son’s and daughter’s rooms, who’d both meet the same fate as their mother. The voice’s laughter echoed in my mind as I watched myself brutally murder my loved ones, one by one.

After witnessing my entire bloodline end before my eyes, I was just about to slaughter my dog when I slipped and hit my head on the floor, landing on a puddle of urine that my dog must have made earlier. I was knocked out instantly.

I woke up, and I am now sitting on my front porch as I type this on my phone. It seems that I have temporarily regained control over my body after hitting my head, but I can feel it trying to take over again. Don’t worry — I locked myself out of the house to protect my dog from any harm. 

To whoever is reading this, please do not **ever** consider getting a head transplant, or else you will end up just like me. And then… Oh, no. I can feel it coming. There’s not much time left.

*Dear reader,*

*Don’t worry, he’s under my control now. I’m still going to post this for him because I find it rather entertaining. Hehe!*

*Oh, and that mutt he was speaking of? She may be safe for now, but I will find a way.*

*I always do.*
