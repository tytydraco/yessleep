Do you feel it? Or am I just crazy?

Don't answer that. Not yet.

It's heavy, though, right? Not on *you*, if that were true, you'd have already been crushed. Flat. Into something inhuman, something *thinned.*

And it has no place, really, it spreads, like an awful blanket, anywhere you go, there it is, pressing down, pressing *in*—but really it has no direction. It's just heavy, it *impends.*

I felt it for the first time at the corner store, looking up, but that's not where it was, it's not about directions, it's not a thing that's above. What I saw looking up was a building, but I live in the heart of this city, the pulsing, beating, flowing swish-and-swirl of concentrated humanity, so there's nearly always a building, when you look up.

Yeah. Felt it the first time at the corner store. I'd just walked out with a snack and a bottled soda, smelling the street, hearing it, all those familiar ups and downs, the small syncopated dances of human and machine and even street-bird. It was good, it was life grooving along, never a perfect song but almost always worth listening to, moving to, maybe sing along.

And then the heaviness hit me, and I had to look up. It wasn't there, because looking does you no good, it's something felt, in the bones, in the heart, in the *throat*, maybe in those cracks along the skull leftover from when you were still squishy and growing. And you're not any less delicate now, because the heavy, it's not gonna crush you any different as a whole-grown human, you think those ungrowing bones of yours will help you at all?

I looked up again, and again it wasn't there, wasn't where I was looking, and it wasn't on me, still isn't, because I'm still here. But I felt it all the same, and I dropped my drink, bouncing plastic bottle off the cement, making it churn inside, threatening sticky hands and wasted fizz if opened.

I still feel it now. It's coming, but I don't know when. I think some people are sensitive to it. I think some people feel it too, I can see it in their faces and I know that they know, and that they're uncertain like me. Maybe it won't matter before I die. Maybe enough of us will feel it that someone smarter than me can figure out what it is, and something can be done. Or maybe not.

It's getting worse. Not by much. Just a little more, and a little more, and a little more, every day. I can still stand up, for now, so I go on. Sometimes I tell myself, it's in your head, and that's right, it is, it's everywhere, head not excluded. Nothing excluded. Not you either, whether you feel it yet or not.

So do you? Or am I just crazy? You can answer that now. Or maybe you'll be able to answer it a day, a week, a year from now, when you're moving along and it's there, has *been* there, only now you know, and now you gotta answer for yourself, not just me.

And if you do feel it now—it's heavy right? Not on you, not on me, not yet. So if you do feel it, and I'm not crazy, tell me this—

How long do you think it's gonna be?
