When Grandma Lorna died, the family didn’t mourn. Her death was almost celebrated—a breath of relief for people who had long since stopped caring about her. She was harsh, strict, and unyielding, a woman who demanded respect and got very little in return. By the time she passed, she was more burden than matriarch.

I was different. Maybe because I was always the outcast, the black sheep. I never fit in with the rest of the family, especially since they despised me for being gender-fluid. My existence was something they mocked behind closed doors, pretending tolerance when I was around. Grandma, though, never judged. Even with her fading eyesight and brittle hands, she could still see things in people. And she saw me—maybe even more clearly than I saw myself.

But after she died, something changed in the house. It was subtle at first. A cold draft, a door that creaked on its own, the feeling of eyes watching when you were alone. Then came the will. To everyone’s shock and outrage, Grandma left the house, the land, and her savings to a trust that none of us could touch. All except for one thing—a key. And it was mine.

It was during the reading that I noticed it: the flicker of something dark at the edge of my vision, like a shadow slipping past the doorway. I glanced around, but no one else seemed to see it. The family, all gathered in the stuffy, dimly lit living room, were too focused on bickering over their pitiful inheritance.

Aunt Meredith was furious. Jason and Mitch—my cousins—were no better, scoffing at the junk they'd been left. Trinkets, really. None of them cared about the woman Grandma Lorna had been, just the value of what she left behind.

"Alex, you got something," Aunt Meredith sneered at me, bitterness dripping from her voice. "A key. What’s that for?"

I shrugged, unsure myself. The key was old, tarnished bronze with intricate engravings, cold to the touch. I wanted to tell her I didn’t know. But a part of me knew—deep down, it was meant for me, and me alone.

That night, the house felt heavier, like the walls themselves were pressing in. The family stayed for the weekend, fighting over what they could take. But I didn’t care. I couldn’t stop thinking about the key and what it unlocked. My room was freezing despite the heat being cranked up, and strange, fleeting whispers echoed in the halls. I could hear Grandma’s voice, though distorted, as if calling from beneath layers of earth.

Sleep didn’t come. Instead, I found myself wandering the house after midnight, clutching the key. The attic—sealed for as long as I could remember—was calling to me. It took some effort to push open the heavy door, and inside, dust filled the air like a thick, choking fog. The key seemed to pulse in my hand as I made my way toward an old, locked chest in the corner. It was like something was urging me forward.

The lock clicked open with an unsettling ease, and inside was a single, ancient-looking journal. I could almost feel the weight of my grandmother’s presence hanging over me as I flipped to the first page. The message, scrawled in her spidery handwriting, made my stomach twist:

**"They will all pay for what they did. But not you, Alex. Never you."**

My breath caught in my throat. It wasn’t the words themselves, but the overwhelming sense that she knew something terrible was coming. I slammed the chest shut and hurried downstairs, trying to shake off the unease. But the house was different now. Darker. Shadows seemed to stretch unnaturally, corners too deep to be real. And then, the rocking chair in the living room creaked.

I froze, eyes wide, staring at the chair near the window. It had been Grandma’s favorite place—she used to sit there for hours, staring out at the trees like she was waiting for something. Now, it was empty. But still, it rocked, slowly, back and forth. The air was cold and thick with a stench of rotting flowers.

"Alex…" A whisper, soft and unmistakable.

I turned, my blood running cold. There, sitting in the chair, was Grandma Lorna. She wasn’t a pale, ethereal ghost. No, her skin was a sickly gray, her eyes sunken deep into her skull, lips cracked and dry. Her head turned toward me with a slow, deliberate motion, the bones in her neck audibly cracking.

"I told you… they’ll pay."

My heart raced. I wanted to scream, to run, but I couldn’t. My legs refused to move. The temperature dropped even further, and as I stared at her, I saw something horrible. Her hands—those frail hands I remembered—were now blackened and twisted, the nails long and sharp, dripping with a thick, black liquid.

She raised one of them slowly, pointing past me. "They’re already beginning to suffer."

The next morning, Jason was the first to fall ill. He was always the strongest, the loudest. But now, he could barely stand, his skin pale and clammy. He vomited black bile, clutching his stomach in agony. Aunt Meredith dismissed it as food poisoning, but the panic in her eyes said otherwise. Jason screamed through the night, his voice raw and broken by morning. They found him curled up in a corner, whispering about something watching him from the shadows, something crawling under his skin.

Then it was Mitch’s turn. He woke up screaming, clawing at his own arms, tearing his skin apart as if trying to get something out. Blood splattered the walls, and by the time they restrained him, he was nearly unrecognizable. His eyes were wild, pupils blown wide with terror.

"It’s in me," he kept whispering. "She’s in me."

The house grew colder, darker with each passing day. Aunt Meredith, always the skeptic, started hearing things—loud banging at night, whispers that came from nowhere. She found blackened handprints on the walls, smears of something foul on her bedroom door. And the smell—that sickening, rotten stench—hung thick in the air, no matter how much she scrubbed.

I knew what was happening. Grandma Lorna had come back. She had warned me. And now, she was taking her revenge.

It was two days later when Meredith vanished. She’d been locking herself in her room, refusing to come out for meals, barely speaking to anyone. Jason was bedridden, muttering incoherent things about being buried alive, but Meredith’s door wouldn’t open. The whole house seemed to vibrate with a low hum, like it was alive, angry.

I remember standing outside her door, hearing her crying softly. Then the crying stopped. There was a wet sound, like something was tearing, ripping apart.

"Meredith?" I called, my voice barely a whisper.

No response.

With shaking hands, I opened the door. Inside, the room was covered in blood. The walls, the floor, the bed—everything. It looked like something had exploded inside her, like she had been ripped apart from the inside out. And in the middle of the carnage was Meredith’s lifeless body, or what was left of it. Her face—oh God, her face—was twisted into a grotesque mask of terror, her mouth wide open in a silent scream, her eyes bloodshot and bulging. Her chest was caved in, bones jutting out at sharp angles, as if something had burst out of her ribcage.

And on the floor next to her body, smeared in blood, was a message:

**"She’s coming for all of you."**

I stumbled back, bile rising in my throat. I wanted to run, but where? The house had become a maze of darkness and terror. Everywhere I went, I felt Grandma’s presence—watching, waiting. The others, too, could feel it. Jason’s screams had stopped; now, he just stared blankly at the ceiling, his lips moving silently as if reciting some forgotten prayer.

I couldn’t stay in the house, but every time I tried to leave, the doors wouldn’t budge. The windows were sealed tight, the walls seemed to close in. It was as if the house had become a prison—her prison—and we were all trapped inside.

The final night was the worst. Jason was gone by then, his body found crumpled in a heap at the bottom of the stairs, his neck twisted at an unnatural angle. I was the only one left.

The whispers grew louder, filling every corner of the house. The shadows twisted into grotesque shapes, moving like they had minds of their own. I could hear her footsteps, slow and deliberate, moving closer and closer. The air grew thick with the stench of decay, and the temperature dropped to the point where I could see my breath.

I hid in the attic, the journal clutched to my chest like a shield. I don’t know what I was hoping for. Maybe for it all to be a nightmare. But the creak of the attic door shattered that hope.

"Alex…" Her voice, soft and sinister, echoed through the room. "It’s your turn."

I turned slowly, and there she was. Her eyes were no longer milky and distant—they were black, empty voids. Her mouth twisted into a grotesque grin, revealing teeth that were sharp and jagged. Blood dripped from her lips, staining her pale skin.

She raised one of........
