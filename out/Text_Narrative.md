I was hired fresh out of college at the ripe age of 22. I had gone to school hoping to become the next big thing; this generation’s Stephen King. Instead, my aspirations dwindled toward the end of college, hell I would’ve been happy to work a regular 9-5 writing job at that point. What happened? Well, the ideas I did have, came slowly and the ones I did have didn’t garner much attention. The few drafts I sent to publishers couldn’t hold them for a few chapters, let alone a whole novel.  The feedback was all the same, I was stuck on non-important details, and my description of events didn’t move the story forward, leaving the reader unengaged. The “signature style” I like using in my writing turned out to be too dry for a mainline audience. With no novel, job, or plan after college, I was reaching the bottom of the barrel, things were looking bleak. That is until I attended a last-minute job fair a month before graduation.

 

I was recruited by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the job title that was proposed to me was data entry. At the time I couldn’t help but scoff at the idea that the four long years I spent on my undergrad qualified me to fill out Excel spreadsheets, but I couldn’t be more wrong. My role, or “specialization” as they like to call it, turned out to be more defined as audio and video interpretation.  For the first 6 years of my career, I worked under a senior video and sound engineer (VSE) who helped train me in the process of transcribing video/audio evidence. The transcription work at that level was mainly ransom demands for wealthy families and petty crime footage. Would you be surprised that most ransom demands come from within the family of the victim? As for the petty crimes, they were mostly solved by the time we made our input.

 

After 6 years, I moved on to video evidence from cold case files from the '80s-'90s, transcribing and documenting anything that may have been missed by the original detectives. This was easily the most satisfying work I have done in my career. My department managed to shine a light on evidence never before analyzed in multiple cases. Hell, we managed to drum up new leads on about thirty-five cold cases and help close two, one of which had aired on “Unsolved Mysteries”! I am a sucker for those types of shows.

 

The success I found in that department rocketed me into multiple opportunities. Ultimately, I began leading task forces specializing in video and sound analysis. My department had partnered with Homeland Security, focusing on potential domestic threats. I led groups that analyzed cartel and terrorist footage, and the work we did saved countless lives. With this level of work, security, and secrecy were of the utmost importance. My security clearance had shot up significantly, which helped me into my next role which I currently am at.

 

About 5 years ago, I was approached internally by an unnamed group within the FBI, hoping to recruit me in the hopes I would lead a task force to tackle unexplained or unnatural video/audio evidence. This group was later named Unexplained Phenomenon Specialized Task Force, or UPSTF (The FBI - or any government agency for that matter - is notorious for bad names).  I accepted and have been the lead director for UPSTF for the past 5 years. Although the initial work we did seemed fruitful, we eventually hit many roadblocks with the submitted evidence. We had little success explaining anything we managed to get our hands on.

 

Eventually, with no results, the Bureau had a hard time justifying our budget. Our once thriving task force dwindled to just about five or so people over the past two years. The work we do now is more of a documentation process and in all actuality, we have reverted to what I was doing when I first started, transcribing video and audio evidence. Believe it or not, the FBI largely lives in the past, and archaic systems still thrive. All transcriptions are typed out, printed, placed in a manilla folder, manilla folder then placed in a box, a strip of painter's tape slapped on the outside of the box, named based on the case file, dated, and thrown onto a shelf. The official name for this process is known as “Transcribing Documentation Through Text Narrative Based on Audio and Visual Interpretation Through Specialized Extrapolation” (again, really?), my coworkers and I have shortened this wonderful name down to “Text Narrative”.  We have provided Text Narrative to thousands of cases over the past 5 years.

 

The evidence which we transcribe will never see the light of day, multiple layers of red tape stand in the way. Although the video and audio evidence will never see the light of day, the Text Narrative remains and is largely “declassified”. Why would these be declassified? Well, the higher-ups at the Bureau have their reasons, but I think it came down to funding and believability. Additionally, the slow nature of bureaucracy and little transparency to the public will probably provide enough cover for these documents to never leave the shelf they live on.  How long would a Freedom of Information Act Request really take? Years? Decades? Who knows. This is what your taxes pay for, is it not? 

 

Anyway, although my department knocks on death's door, I feel the urge – no, the *need* \- to share this with fellow Americans.  The Text Narrative we have done over the years shares insight into the nature of this world that no one would believe.  The shit that they are hiding… it's *unfathomable*. Hopefully, this reaches the right audience. I can’t just copy and paste these since they are all on paper, but I can type them out for now (goodie!). The following excerpt is one of the stranger cases we reviewed and one of the first we had done with the assistance of AI. Take what you will from this case and make your own decision with what was documented in this Text Narrative.

 

**Text Narrative #4443 – The Disappearance of Corey Phillips**

 

*Brimmer Bay Police video and audio evidence dated: 10/22/2023*

 

*Ongoing supporting case evidence submitted by Trooper Bill Hatchers of Brimmer Bay Police*

 

*Visual analysis documented by Licensed Video & Sound Engineer (VSE) Sally Stromberg with audio excerpts interpreted by OpenText AI®*

 

*Additional note from ASE: OpenText AI helps capture all audio with detail and accuracy-- all text excerpts from subjects are captured as pronounced for complete documentation sufficient for criminal investigations and transcription purposes. (Personal note from ASE to UPSTF director can be omitted in the final report – This greatly helps capture the authenticity of voice distinction, need to use on future transcriptions, or even update past completed Text Narratives)*

 

*Start.*

 

*10/21/2023 – 5:32 pm*

 

*The video starts with a close-up shot of the face of a child. The camera is manually zoomed backward from the boyish face. The shot is now wide on the face of a young boy in a mowed yard. A camera strap extends from the camera around the boy's neck as the boy holds the camera out far facing himself.*

 

*Notable Identifying features of the “young boy”: Caucasian, short brown hair, blue eyes, red Mickey Mouse shirt*

 

*ASE identifies this child as the missing boy on file, Corey Phillips (age 7), per the case record.*

 

*The sun positioning and shadow geometry of key background details confirm the camera date and time as accurate. There is a red house that fills the backdrop behind Corey. A wrap-around wood back porch leads to an open sliding glass door to the residence. All indicators show this is the Phillips residence per case crime scene photography.*

 

Corey: “All right guyths, you are not gonna believe thisth. My parentsth gave me their old camera!  Itsth ancient!”

 

*Corey proceeds to dance and spin with the camera, giggling in the last few hours of sunlight. The camera then flips around to face the open sliding glass door. Corey runs up the back steps of the porch and through the back door. The back door opens to a modernized kitchen with a granite-topped kitchen island. A slender man and woman stand at the edges of the kitchen island, working busily at something out of sight from the camera. It is safe to conclude it is most likely dinner prep or the breakdown following dinner.*  

 

*Identifying features “man”: Caucasian, tall, brown hair, white dress shirt, denim jeans*

 

*ASE identifies this man as suspect* ***one****, Kenneth “Ken” Phillips (age 43), per the case record.*

 

*Identifying features “woman”: Caucasian, average height, red hair, red dress*

 

*ASE identifies this woman as suspect* ***two****, Caroline Phillips (age 41), per the case record.*

 

Corey: “Dad, can you film me running at thuper thpeed?!”

 

Ken: “Not now little man. Your mother and I are getting ready for date night! You remember that don’t you?”

 

Corey: “But dad, how am I thupposed to know how fatht I really am?!”

 

Caroline: “Corey, have you still not showered? Your gam-gam is going to be here in 30 minutes, and you need to be washed up before she arrives!”

 

Corey: “Mom I don’t wa-”

 

*The camera faces the ground and the video cuts to black*

 

*Video end*

 

*10/21/2023 – 6:39 pm*

 

*Video resumes*

 

*The camera is aimed between wooden banisters along a stairway railing, looking down from atop a set of stairs Corey seems to be crouched with the camera. Caroline can be seen standing next to an older woman. They are mid-conversation.*

 

*Identifying features “older woman”: Caucasian, short, long grey hair, blue nightgown*

 

*ASE identifies this woman as suspect* ***three****, Susan Walker (age 75), per the case record.*

 

Susan: The opening ceremony is very important to the elders dear; you mustn’t forget the ceremony steps.  The Elders are *very* strict.

 

Caroline: Yes mother, I know. You do not need to worry - But mother… I am still scared. I can't help but remember what happened to Sean. I… It keeps me up at night; I can still hear his scream.

 

Susan: Sean was careless! He did not take it seriously and paid the consequences. You are nothing like your brother. Do not embarrass your father and me as your brother did.

 

Caroline: Mom! How can you talk about your *own* son like that? I just don’t see ho-

 

Ken (off-camera): Hon! We are gonna be late, are you ready? I am about to come down, please start the car.

 

Caroline: Yes! It's already started, I still need to grab some things before we go!

 

*Susan grabs Caroline's arm and pulls her close, speaking under hushed breath.*

 

Susan: Don’t forget the steps. You will do just fine, don’t think just do.

 

Ken (off-camera): Hey buddy, filming a documentary?  It's time to start getting ready for bed big guy, don’t make your grandma do everything while we’re gone.

 

*Video ends*

 

*10/21/2023 – 6:51 pm*

 

*Video resumes*

 

The camera is facing Corey, the background is dark with no identifiable location.

 

Corey: Alright guyths, I am sthneaking out! I am going to sthcare the crap out of Mom and Dad! They won't even know what hit them! Grandma never watchesth me if I'm upstairsth. I already sthnuck back down and am almosth to the car. Mom and Dad didn’t even sthee me! Thisth is gonna be stho awethome.

 

*Video ends*

 

*10/21/2023 – 6:58 pm*

 

*Video resumes*

 

*The camera is facing forward from the rear of the Phillips family SUV. Caroline and Ken quickly enter the car in what seems to be a hurry. The car swiftly starts and begins to roll down the road.*

 

Ken: Hon, I told you we were going to be late; we needed to leave 15 minutes ago.

 

Caroline: Ken, it's okay. My mom said these types of ceremonies always start late.  We won’t miss the initiation, my family's connection to the church simply wouldn’t allow it.

 

Ken: I know- I just- after what happened with Sean.

 

Caroline: I told you not to bring him up.

 

Ken: I know.  I'm sorry, I am just nervous, that’s all. Plus, I feel naked without my phone!  I know this is all secretive and whatnot, but I am just not used to having it. I also worry about your mom with Corey, she never seems to *actually* watch him.

 

Caroline: I know sweetie, but Corey will be just fine. My mom will take good care of him, she knows how big this night is for us and our family. She might be an old crockety bitch now, but she takes care of her own.

 

*A light giggle is barely picked up from behind the camera.*

 

*Video ends*

 

*10/21/2023 – 7:24 pm*

 

*Video resumes*

 

*The car headlights shine down a gravel road barred on each side by large pine trees.  They are approaching an iron-stylized gate with hooded figures standing on either side.  The figures’ dark brown cloaks cover every inch of their bodies and excess cloth lay on the gravel.  As they get closer to the gate, horned masks with long snouts can be seen poking out from under the hoods.  One figure raises a hand, and the car comes to a stop. The other figure begins to walk toward the driver's side of the car. Ken rolls down the window.*

 

Ken: Uhh hi, we are the Phillips family? We were told to be here by 7:30, I know we are cutting it clo-

 

Cloaked figure: Family origin name, please.

 

Ken: Oh right, uhh it's uhh-

 

Caroline: Walker.

 

*The man in the horned mask turns toward the other cloaked figure and nods. Reaching off to something out of frame, the gate starts to swing open.*

 

Cloaked figure: *Furfures*

 

Caroline and Ken: Furfures

 

*The window is rolled up. Ken nervously looks over to Caroline, she reaches and puts her hand on his thigh.*

 

*Video ends*

*The video is dark / barely discernable. Although faint it seems to be pointed at Coreys face. Corey can be heard whispering.*

 

Corey: My parentsth left, I wasth too sthcared to sthay anything and I am sthtill in the car. Thisth isthnt dinner, where isth thisth playth?

 

*The camera pans out the back seat window. Lit torches lead up a dirt pathway toward a large wooden building. The outside details seem to look like an abandoned church but with no identifiable religious symbols.*

 

Corey:  My parentsth are in that housthe. I am going to justh wait till they get back.

 

*Video ends*

 

*10/21/2023 – 9:45 pm*

 

*Video resumes*

*The camera is facing toward the church. In addition to the torches, it appears a large fire has been lit behind the building. Although the fire is not visible, the light from the flames illuminates the large pine trees. Shadows can be seen cast through the illumination of the fire. In addition to this, there seems to be a barely audible chant that is coming from outside of the car. OpenText AI® spits out an error when prompted to discern.*

 

Corey: I don’t know where my parensth are at and I want to go home. I need to find them so we can leave thisth thcary playth. I can't sthee good but the camera can sthee good in the dark.

 

*Corey sticks his thumb into his mouth as the camera flips around. He opens the back door and climbs from the car down to the ground. He turns toward the lit path and starts to make his way toward it. The chant is now very clear once outside the car.*

 

Chant: *Come now Furfures, come up Furfures, heed thy words Furfures, come now Furfures, come up Furfures, heed thy words Furfures (repeats)*

 

*Corey reaches the path and walks up to the church. He reaches a large wooden door with a cast iron knob. With his offhand not holding the camera, he twists the doorknob and the door swings open. Bright light floods the camera view, and the camera must quickly adjust its focus to its new surroundings. Now in focus, a large room empty room lies before Corey. No furniture can be seen, but thousands of red candles are lit on the floor of the church casting a low-level light that had disoriented the camera. The candles seem to have been lit for a while as they are melting and pooling out on the large open floor in all directions. As Corey steps through the door frame, the door shuts behind him as the chants grow quieter. The low light of the candles only reaches about 7-8 feet above the floorboards, leaving anything above that to the high ceiling of the church shrouded in darkness. A low whisper can be heard but is not discernable through an ASE headset. Opentext AI provides dialogue when prompted to.*  

 

Unknown voice: *coreeeyyyyy*

 

Corey: Dad? M-m-mom?

 

Unknown voice: yesss correyyy, *its daaad* commmmme clossssser

 

Corey: Dad I am sthcared. I can’t sthee you.

 

Unknown entity: *Don’t be scared, follow the sound of my voiccccee*

 

*Corey aims the camera down and his light-up sketcher can be seen walking through the clear patches between candles. Even with caution, Corey's light-up shoes begin to accumulate wax clumps, dampening the effects of the flashing light on the shoes. As he moves forward, the gaps between candles and their pools grow farther apart and eventually the wood flooring is clear of red wax.  The camera pans in a circle, Corey is now in the center of the large room, a small circle clearing of floorboards is where he now stands.*  

 

Unknown voice: *cooorreeeyyy, furfures beckons youuuuu*

 

*The camera pans up into the ceiling rafters. Although hard to tell in the darkness, a large dim silhouette can be seen moving from rafter to rafter above Corey. The whisper seems to be coming from this shadow in the darkness. The chanting from outside the church is now growing to a loud chorus, either the chanters are moving closer to the church, or more people are joining.*

 

Unknown entity: *youuu shallll be minnneee, cooreeeyyy*

 

Corey: W-what? D-dad what are you doing up there? Come down, we need to go.

 

Unknown entity: *your dadsss soooul is miiinnneee coreeeyy, and yourrrss is nexxxt*

 

Corey: You're- You're not my Dad! Where isth my dad?! DAD?!

 

*Corey cries out into a sob. A loud bang is heard off-camera, the chanting now stopped. The camera swivels to a now open door across the room from the door that Corey had walked through. A hooded figure in a horned mask and another man in dress clothes wearing a similar mask stand in the door frame. The man in dress clothes takes his mask off, it is Ken Phillips.*

 

Ken: Corey? What are you doing here? You can’t be here!

 

*Ken begins walking toward Corey. The hooded figure next to Ken reaches out to grab Ken’s shoulder but misses.*

 

*Hooded figure:* Leave him, do not enter the church!

 

*Ken does not falter and continues to step forward into the large room. The hooded figure then backsteps out of the doorframe. Ken does not seem to notice and is focused on Corey.*  

 

Ken: That’s my son! He can’t be here! Let me get him, it will take one second.

 

*Ken is about halfway toward Corey when he freezes mid-stride. From this distance, you can tell that not only his movement had frozen mid-stride, but his facial gestures seemed to be fixed in place. Only a small twitch in his brow can be seen. A low-pitched gravelly voice can now be heard shouting from somewhere in the church.*

 

Unknown entity: **MORTAL FOOL**! You **DARE** step into the domain of Furfures? You have *willingly* given your soul, but for this act, I will now *take* your **LIFE**!

 

*Still frozen, Ken instantaneously combusts and is set ablaze. Corey can be heard hyperventilating behind the camera. The shadow that had been above Corey now looms above Ken. A silent scream can be heard escaping from Ken as he burns.*

 

Unknown entity: **SILENCE!**

 

*Ken’s body explodes from seemingly nothing. Scattering blood everywhere around the room. A loud moan from the unknown entity can now be heard. The camera now rises into the air and is being rushed back from the scene. The camera falls and is dangling from the strap around Corey's neck. The camera still points back toward where Ken had been, multiple cloaked figures now stand in the doorframe and more can be seen standing behind them. The voice of Caroline can be heard through Corey's quick breathing.*

 

Caroline (off-camera whisper): *It’s okay. It’s okay. It’s okay. (repeating)*

 

Unknown Entity: The time of the culling is upon us! Those who have willingly given their souls now must pay penance! ENTER MY DOMAIN FOR YOU HATH BEEN CHOSEN! **INTRAR IN INFERNUM!**

 

*Deep laughter booms loudly in the room. The cloaked figures now shuffle into the wax-filled room, walking toward where Ken had once been. A door can be heard opening. Corey and Caroline push through the door frame Corey had entered through and are on the lit dirt path. Loud chanting can now be heard as before, but chanting is something different.*

 

Chanting: Furfures. Intrar in infernum. Furfures. Intrar in infernum. (repeats)

 

*The sound of a car door opening can be heard and Corey with the camera is placed into the car.  The camera's video is pitch black as it records a seat cushion. A car door can be heard closing, then another opening with another quick close. A frantic shuffling can be heard.*

 

Caroline (off camera): Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Where are the goddamn keys!

 

Corey (off camera): M-m-mom, what happened to daddy?

 

Caroline (off camera): D-dad, he.. Well, he… he’s okay…

 

*Silence fills the car for about 5 seconds.*

 

Caroline (off camera): He had the keys. Corey, we are going to go for a walk, okay honey?

 

Corey (off camera): Mom, I want Daddy.

 

Caroline (off camera): No fussing.

 

*A car door opens and closes.  Another opens closer to the camera. Corey with the camera lifted into the air again.  The camera is now facing the church once again, dangling on the unseen strap. Light emanates from the large fire behind the church, the lit path, and between the boards of the church building itself. A large fire can be seen growing from inside the church. Caroline and Corey start quickly moving away from the car and the scene behind them. The chanting can now again be heard, although faint. Burning figures begin exiting the burning church and shuffle down the lit dirt path. As each burning figure reaches the last torch at the end of the path their last step past the torch is adjoined with a shallow pop.  Following the shallow pop the cloak of each burning figure blasts up into the air and falls to the ground, now empty. Multiple burning robes now fill the darkness beyond the dirt path. A continuous roaring can be heard reaching over the monotonous chanting from the remaining burning figures. The camera suddenly jerks and swings back and forth, Caroline and Corey have stopped.*

 

Caroline: Mom?! What are you doing here?!

 

Susan: Tonight is the night sweetie. We are being freed; the promise of immortality is being fulfilled! Where is Ken dear?

 

Caroline: Mom, they killed Ken! They LIED! I don’t know what is in that church b-but there is a monster, and he *killed* Ken!

 

Susan: By the wonder of Furfures dear, he was freed! You and Corey must join him in eternal service!

 

Caroline: Mom, no. They are lying to you! What are you doing? Let go!

 

*The last remaining burning figure has hit the end of the lit path, and the cloak explodes into the air. The chanting along with the roaring has stopped. The church is now fully burning, the flames reach 50 feet into the night sky. Caroline drops Corey to the ground as the sound of a struggle between Caroline and Susan can be heard off-camera. Two large dark-clawed hands stretch from the front door of the burning church grabbing the door frame on either side. Horns begin to emerge from the fire spitting out the door frame, the face of what seems to be an animal or human/animal hybrid looks out. As the horned entity pulls its long furry body out of the burning church, large wings sprawl out from its back.  Now fully out of the burning church, the horns and half-human face most resemble that of an elk or that of an elk that is dying or deformed. The entity begins to flap up, then down, and gallop in the direction of the trio. As it reaches the end of the path the large now silhouette glides through the night directly toward the camera. The silhouette closes the distance fast and the camera with Corey begins lifting into the air. The struggling mother and daughter look up and shrink away from the camera. Caroline reaches into the air toward the camera, as the distance widens, the expression of horror on her face. Susan gleams up brightly toward the camera.*

 

Caroline: COREY! NO!

 

*Caroline and Susan now blend into the expanding darkness. The fire from the burning church dwindled farther and farther away. Loud flaps from the unknown entity can be heard as a roar echoes into the night. Corey can be heard sobbing. The roaring is replaced by booming laughter as the camera strap fails. The silhouette of Corey can briefly be seen, thumb shoved into his mouth dangling from the long legs of the unknown entity as its claws clutch his shoulders. Wind is now whistling into the camera microphone, and the footage is pitch black. A sharp crack in the audio marks the end of the video.*

 

*Video ends*

 

*10/21/2023 -10:32 pm*

 

*End.*
