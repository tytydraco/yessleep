I used to be an avid golfer back in the day, there was something so meditative about heading out the driving range and knocking a bucket of balls into the depths of the night sky over a couple hours.  I still am to an extent, but there is one night that sticks out in my mind.  Many years ago I pulled into the parking lot of the Big Swings Golf Center as I used to do on a Saturday night to escape the wife and kids. Surrounded by rocky outcrops and cacti, this place radiates peace as soon as you arrive.  I always thought that the way my headlights shine on the field of golf balls makes them almost look like they’re looking back at me.

Despite it nearly being closing, I know I could slip Christy a $20 and she’d let me stay a bit longer even though she knew she wasn’t supposed to.  Despite there being tons of parking spots to choose from, I always chose my usual spot near the back of the lot.  Something about the ritual of being at the same place signals my brain that it’s time to be present, almost like how those Tibetan singing bowls are used to start meditation.  I hauled my clubs out of the back of the car and noticed a small piece of paper fell out of my pocket.  It was a permission slip for my kid’s field trip, with my ex’s signature right at the top.  The last meeting with the lawyers turned into a complete shouting match over some silverware. I realize now that it wasn’t the knives I cared about but more that I was trying to “win” the divorce.  Whatever, I put the thought out of my mind and tried to focus on golf.  

The driving range was much emptier than usual with only a couple of people on the second floor this time.  I usually like it when the range is empty, the peacefulness is something I don’t get in my day-to-day life.  The long curved roof gives off a cold illumination combined with the fluorescent lights, when you see it from a distance you can’t help but think that middle aged men are attracted to driving ranges like bugs to lightbulb.  I guess that makes me a bug.

My membership came with a key fob that lets me in without having to interact with anyone, which is probably a good thing considering the divorce proceedings gives me the world’s shortest fuse.  I set up at tee box #3, or my “home away from home” as I used to call it before my actual home became a warzone.  The warm desert air passed through the range as I slipped on my glove and poured out a handful of balls onto the tee.  Peering out into the field I noticed that the furthest set of lights was out, and while I hadn’t hit a 300 yard drive in a long time, if I did it would be impossible to see where it went.

A couple weeks back I decided to invest in myself and buy some golf lessons, mainly just as an excuse to leave the house.  Dave the instructor asked me to record myself as I practiced and so I took my small tripod out of my bag and set up my phone to record.  Now maybe it was luck or maybe it was the combination of the smooth desert air but this was one of the biggest drives I had ever done.  Definitely up into the 300 yard area, which unfortunately meant that as soon as I looked up from my swing the ball passed through the dark veil of the stadium lights and was lost in the night.

However, I figured maybe I could get an idea of where it went from the video, so I stopped the recording and zoomed into where I thought the ball should have landed.  I was unsure what I was looking at initially but after adjusting the brightness I saw it.  Out in the darkness of the driving range my ball was clutched in the hand of a person, their eyes glowing in the night, staring directly back at the camera.

My blood turned to ice in my veins as I adjusted the zoom to get a full look at the creature on the range.  I peered out into the night at roughly the same area and couldn’t see anything from the lights.  I figured it must have been a prank or something, maybe one of the photo-filter apps my kids installed on my phone.  I reset the camera and send another long drive into the night, not nearly as far but still good enough.  After thoroughly examining this new recording I couldn’t find any sign of the person on the golf course and so shook it off before finishing my bucket of balls.

As the night wound down I packed up my equipment and loaded it into the backseat of my car, only one of two left in the lot.  Peering back out into the darkened driving range I looked again for the thing who caught my ball but didn’t see a thing.  I reversed out of my spot and made my way to the parking lot exit, nearly getting to the end before slamming on the breaks.  In front of my headlights rested one of my own golf balls setup on a tee wedged in a crack in the pavement, with “#3” written in sharpie, facing my car.

I have never returned to the Big Swings Golf Center.
