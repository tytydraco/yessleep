Have you ever heard of a famine village? At the height of the Irish Famine, when hunger spread like a disease, communities were wiped out. Some people withered like flowers in winter; others fell into a slumber so deep they were mistakenly buried alive. An occurrence that became all too common. The starvation set in slowly at first, but with every failed crop, the hunger pangs soon turned to cramps, then to agonising aches, and people resorted to eating anything. First, they survived on mushrooms, foraged at the borders of graves. When those ran out, they turned to boiling nettles, and after that, rats. Anyone caught stealing food was killed on the spot, no matter the age. The young and the elderly were the first to go, followed by entire families in the span of a week. Houses were either torn down, or abandoned. Those that remained rot where they lay, left to be devoured by the earth itself. These abandoned villages held so much horror, none more so than Cairn village.

Just off the western coast of Ireland, sat Achill Island. An isolated place shrouded in mystery in an already mysterious place. Despite being separated from the mainland, the famine didn’t spare them. In the early 20^(th) century, an attempt was made by the local council to re-inhabit the place. Thus, Cairn village became a haven for lobster trappers, along with farmers making their golden butter, the place should have thrived again. Then, one day, the inhabitants were just gone. It was discovered by a census worker sailing over, and finding no one to greet him. No fishermen, no farmers, no children playing down by the shore. Everyone had just vanished. A search was conducted, of course, the island wasn’t that big, with only a span of 57 miles, there was nowhere to hide. Yet, no one was ever found, not a trace. Stranger still, not a single boat was missing.

So, what happened? Did a storm attack the island? There was no record of a storm.

Did a new type of fast acting disease wipe them out? There were no bodies.

Did the farm animals rise up against their masters? The animals were gone as well. 

To this day, the disappearance of Cairn village remains one of Ireland’s greatest mysteries, and me and my friends were supposed to solve it.

I thought Stephen was joking when he suggested travelling to Achill Island. For one thing, he hated sailing, and the other, he was an archaeology student, how the hell would that help? I’ll never forget his smiling, eager face when he asked me to go.

“No.” I immediately answered. Stephen’s face fell,

“Aw, why not?”

“Do you have an hour?”

Spending a 3-day weekend on a wet, lonely island didn’t exactly scream fun to me. Frankly, it baffled me I had to explain that to him. Stephen was persistent.

“Come on, when was the last time we all hung out together?”

“We’re hanging out right now,” I gestured to the café around us,

“I mean all of us, you, me, and John Joe- a boy’s weekend,”

“On an abandoned island,” I frowned.

Stephen could see I wasn’t being swayed. He pouted, taking a moment to slice into the bacon on his plate. My eyes fell to my own plate, eggs on toast. I picked up my fork and poked the yellow lumps. My appetite nowhere to be found. I managed two bites of toast before giving up, the crumbs catching in my throat. I moved the eggs around, pushing it to the side, into my napkin, getting it out of sight. Luckily, Stephen didn’t notice.

“I mean,” Stephen tried again, “Just imagine, we could be the ones to unravel the mystery,” his red face shined with hope, and bacon grease,

I looked at him, “You mean you,”

Stephen waved away my words, “I would credit you two.”

I sipped at my coffee, the hot liquid numbing the emptiness.

“And, you’re bringing John Joe because…?”

“Please. You’d think he’d pass up a chance to rough it on an island,” Stephen shook his head fondly,

“The lad thinks he’s Bear Grylls, he’d be pissed if I didn’t invite him.”

I had to nod; that made sense. When we were all in university, John Joe opted out of student accommodation, choosing to live out of a tent in the forest, emerging only for class, or a shower at one of our places.

“And me?” I clutched my mug tighter, “Why do you want me to come?”

Stephen went quiet, chewing his bottom lip. Then, he reached out and put his hand over mine on the table,

“I really want you to be there. I…I worry.”

The coffee turned bitter in my mouth. I don’t remember what happened after that as my mind went blank, but somehow, I ended up on a tiny boat, wedged in between my two friends, while being doused in sea spray.

I shivered, almost vibrated, where I sat, the layers and long johns I wore did nothing. Beside me, John Joe kept sniffing,

“Smell that sea air,” he breathed. It just smelled like fish to me.

“Nothing like it,” Stephen agreed, not looking up from his notebook,

“Works up an appetite.”

I sighed, the sound whipped away by the bitter wind. Our boatman, an elderly fisherman by the name of Martin, his snow-white hair hidden under a *Guinness* beanie. He was reluctant to bring us over, until Stephen pushed a wad of notes into his hands. Even so, the man grumbled under his breath the entire time. The other two didn’t notice, or care. I shivered at the brow of the boat, deciding that I better join in the conversation.

“So, what are we going to do when we get there?”

“I’ll be setting up camp, catching dinner, getting a lay of the land,” John Joe happily said, my stomach twinged at what he considered dinner.

“I will be doing a survey of the land, catalogue anything interesting, and find places to dig,” Stephen said, finally looking up from his notebook,

“Are you going to do a dig this weekend?”

“No, if I find anything interesting, I’d have to inform my professor and she’d have to get a permit, then organise a team.”

I interrupted him, “Surely, anything interesting would’ve been found years ago,”

“Not according to my research,” he flipped through his novel sized notebook, “In the history of Achill, I found that hardly any archaeological surveys have been conducted on this island.”

“Why though?”

Stephen hummed in thought, “Superstition I suppose, you know how the older generation are,” he glanced at over his shoulder at the boatman, still grumbling under his breath,

“When I was younger, my dad knocked a fairy tree down by accident, and I still remember my granny falling to her knees,” his eyes got a faraway look,

“The screams of her.”

John Joe sucked in air through his teeth,

“Ooh, I don’t know, I wouldn’t mess with a fairy tree either,”

Stephen scoffed, “Don’t tell me you believe in that nonsense?”

John Joe made a guttural noise before spitting over the boat, followed by the boatman,

“Stop it! I’m serious.”

“John Joe, come on, you’re almost 30, and you still believe in that fairy shite,”

John Joe crossed his arms, “What happened to your dad after the tree incident?”

“Oh, he died.”

John Joe gestured with his hands,

“He died from a heart attack,” Stephen corrected, “The man ate like shit.”

“And he was only struck dead after knocking down a fairy tree? Yeah, that’s a coincidence,” John Joe replied dryly,

Stephen tutted, turning to me,

“What do you think, Niall? Are you on my side, or the fool’s side?”

I sighed, “I think you’re both fools,”

Stephen pushed it, “Who’s the bigger fool?”

“Me, for coming on this trip.”

The pair burst into laughter, and I couldn’t help smiling myself. I had to admit; it was nice being with the boys again. Back in our uni days, they were, and still are, my best friends. I was too pessimistic for others, which Stephen and John Joe delighted in telling me so.

Another plus, they never questioned why I didn’t eat in the canteen.

Behind us, the boatman cleared his throat, speaking in a low, growling voice,

“God rest the poor souls,” he even crossed himself.

I thought he meant us until the island came into view, the craggy rocks rose out of the sea like the hunched spine of a hidden beast, puling us in. Then, I saw the cottages. Grey, little matchbox things that dotted the land. John Joe whistled his amazement, Stephen finally snapped his notebook shut to look, but I couldn’t take my eyes off the boatman. Upon nearing the shore, the boatman’s face hardened. As the boat cut through the waves, he kept crossing himself, muttering what I knew was a prayer. As we neared the shore, the boat slowed, the old man grunted a ‘leave,’ before turning the wheel. I got out first, unnerved by the man’s actions, and onto the wet sand. My feet slightly sank with a squish.

John Joe tossed out our bags, Stephen struggled to climb out while clutching his notebook, trying not to lose any pages. The boatman wearily watched us, making no move to help. The minute Stephen’s foot left the hull, the boat spun round. Sending up another burst of spray as it sped back towards the mainland. Stephen almost fell into the low tide, swearing as he did. All three of us watched as he quickly became a dot on the horizon. Our only way off the island, and it was gone. A cold stone of dread sat in my stomach,

“He does know to come back for us, right?” I asked Stephen,

“Yep,” he straightened himself up, checking all his pages were still there, “I paid him enough anyway.”

I tried not to focus on the pause in his voice.

I sighed; this was going to be a long weekend.

With our bags in tow, Stephen led the way over the beach, up onto the dirt path, trodden on and shaped by generations of farmers and animals. It felt strange following their footsteps, it almost felt like walking over a grave. John Joe marched on, his bag slung over his shoulder as his boots tramped forward. His bearded face lit up as he took in the scenery, breathing in the smell of nature. With his thick, luscious beard and flat cap, he looked like he was plucked from the island’s history, then he hummed the *DanDaDan* theme tune, ruining the image.

I, on the other hand, was falling behind. We weren’t even at the steepest part yet. We still had a hill to crest. My bag hit my shin with every step; my nose itched at the smell of grass. My steps kicked up so much dirt I could taste it. I barely listened as Stephen pointed things out. The sea churned and frothed behind us, the waves drowned out whatever they were talking about. Stephen had to shout to be heard over the noise,

“See those ridges?” He asked as we reached a series of fields, even overgrown, the layer of grass couldn’t hide the shape of the ridges carved into the ground,

“Those were lazy beds, so named because all you had to do was plant the potato seed, turn the sods, apply some seaweed, then just stand back and watch it grow,” he smiled, smugly, waiting for our reaction,

I grunted out a “Yeah,” and carried on walking. John Joe was the only one matching Stephen’s energy, asking about local wildlife, pointing out wild mushrooms for a stew. He gasped, plucking purple berries from a needle-like bush,

“Juniper berries!” He exclaimed, popping one in his mouth,

“Come back to me when you turn it into gin,” I muttered.

The grey sky disappeared as the foliage grew denser above us. The twisted hawthorn trees burst from the ground; empty branches curled like claws. If I wasn’t careful I could lose an eye on a twig.

Finally, after what seemed like an age, we rounded the end of the hairpin turn, and there it was. Cairn village. Heralded by the low, crumbling walls that encompassed the place. Stephen informed us that a total of 100 cottages were abandoned. Cottage was a strong word. The hovels left behind were nothing like the pictures in Stephen’s history book. Square, stone dwellings, some reduced to rubble, some swallowed up by the earth. The thatched roofs had long since been swept away by the endless barrage of wind and rain. This was no village; this was a graveyard.

“Wow,” Stephen breathed, “We’re gazing at history,”

I hummed, whether in agreement or not, I don’t know. John Joe hurried over to the first dwelling, jumping over a thick hedgerow.

“We’ll sleep here tonight.”

“Why would you pick the only cottage with two walls?” I sighed, “It’s not even a cottage, it’s a corner of a cottage,”

John Joe waved away my words, “We’ll get a great view of the stars this way.” He was already pulling out his sleeping bag.

I sighed and looked away, just 20 feet away was a steep drop, overlooking the bay where we were dropped off. It looked like any other coastline, the water glittered like diamonds, I guess it was a nice sight. Stephen let out another breath, wiping his glasses on his sleeve.

“John Joe, I’ll help you set up camp, and Niall-,”

I looked up from checking my phone, no signal in case you were wondering,

“Can you take this?” he handed me a thing that looked like an old compass,

“Go up to the top of hill there and get a number for me,”

“A number?”

“Yeah, I want to know how far above sea level we are,”

The highest cliff, Moy Head, Stephen told me, wasn’t that far, but it was a steep walk. My legs burned at the prospect. I really didn’t want to, but a quick look at the tent rods John Joe was pulling out made my decision. I saluted Stephen and began my upward trek. The altimeter was what the weird little thing was called, it rattled as I walked. A steady rhythm matching my uneven footsteps. With every step that took me higher, the voices of my friends grew fainter. They were talking about me, I knew it.

The grass overtook the dirt under my feet, I struggled to trudge through the tangled grass, tripping over hidden rocks and roots. Despite my creeping exhaustion, I had to admit, it did feel humbling walking a path forgotten by time. It got my imagination flowing. What did happen to the people of Cairn village? My theory was that they all walked off the cliff like lemmings in some mass panic. I was fixing to do it next; my legs were killing me already. I glanced behind me, my friends were just dots, waving at me. I waved back. I heard the scuffs of footsteps on rocks; the wind carried the sound to me.  

Dotted throughout the pasture, I noticed dark patches, not buried cottages, they were bog pits. The bog cotton confirmed it. I better warn the other two, the last thing we want is someone sinking into a bog. The Irish equivalent of quicksand. My grandfather lost a friend that way. One minute they were playing, the next, grandad was alone, The last image he had of his friend was his frantic, waving arms as they slowly sank into the earth. Yeah, I better warn them.

As I neared the peak, the altimeter showed 625 metres, while looking down, I caught sight of something in my periphery. A dark red colour. It looked like a tumble weed, stuck between two massive rocks. The reason it caught my attention was that it was the only colour besides green and grey. As I stared at it, shivering in the breeze, I wasn’t watching where I was going and tripped. The altimeter fell from my hands with a clunk. I scrambled for it as I straightened up, the red bush gone, probably taken by the wind.

I shrugged, thinking nothing more of it. The altimeter was stuck at 625, hopefully that was right. I tripped over the thing again. Annoyed, I bent down, tearing up grass to find and throw away the offending rock.

It wasn’t a rock.

It was too smooth, too pale, and it grinned up at me. It was a human skull, embedded in the earth.
