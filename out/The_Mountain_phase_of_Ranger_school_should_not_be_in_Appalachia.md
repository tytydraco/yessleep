Since only a handful of people read my recounting of the events of October 31st 2015, I assume I can use this site to provide a record of another unsettling event from my military career without drawing too much attention to myself. This is the second of such anomalous events.

In 2018 I was undergoing Infantry officer training and was attending the storied Ranger School during the latter half of the year. Ranger School is an at minimum 63 day leadership course that uses starvation, sleep deprivation, and physical exhaustion to mimic combat stressors. All the while conducting graded simulated combat missions and planning. Phase two of the three phases is based out of Camp Merrill Georgia, and the training missions take place in the Appalachian Mountains northwest of Dahlonega Georgia. It was late October or was it early November? I do not recall a precise date due to the days and missions blending together.

The mission that night was a simple ambush on OPFOR(Opposing Force) moving along a trail. I was the assault element Squad Leader, and I needed a passing assessment as to not recycle the phase like I did phase one, this was the last graded patrol before the class moved to the final phase of training. My squad and I were all Recycles, we had been in the school longer than the rest of our platoon and our original classes had already graduated. This mission was the furthest distance into the mountains we had been. The night was eerily dark under the thick foliage, my NODs(night optical device) gave me a green filter of the world using the beams of the half moon’s light that were obscured by wispy clouds that rode on the wind. 

The mission went well. My squad and I handled our business, assaulted and cleared the objective quickly and effectively. The RI(Ranger Instructor) that was grading me commended me for correcting the platoon leader when he botched the withdrawal sequence and my aggression on the matter was what was expected of a combat leader apparently. His mouth projected the smell of stale moist tobacco into my face as he spoke.

“Well Ranger, you’re doing good but mission’s not over.” 

“Roger Sergeant, am I still in leadership position?” I responded shakily. The adrenaline dump of being in leadership was starting again waking me up. Normally we would change positions after the actions on the objective portion of the mission was over. 

“Damn right Ranger, you are assisting the platoon sergeant in the rear of the formation as we march you bastards to your patrol base. Do your job and I can guarantee you that go.” He turned and walked away and I could smell the crisp mountain air again, my buddy Wolf walked over.

“You got that go Webb?” He asked supportively.

“Not yet bud. Apparently I’ve got to babysit the platoon during the movement to wherever we are bedding down.” 

“Well it shouldn’t be to fucking hard, RI Greer is walking pace and he’s the slowest one so nobody should be falling out of the walk.” 

“Yeah as long as this march doesn’t turn into a soup sandwich I should get my go.” 

We walked over to our rucks where the rest of the squad gathered in a penguin huddle to keep warm as the late fall wind blew, chilling their rain soaked uniforms. They complimented me on my grit, and hoped I would get my go. 

The RIs ordered the platoon to prepare for movement. I could hear the collective groans from 45 exhausted Ranger students as we rolled our 80 pound rucks onto our backs and adjusted our kit to make it as comfortable as possible for the rest of the night. I set my equipment and placed my helmet on my head, the sweat soaked helmet pads were ice against my shaved head, I flipped my NODs down and I could peer into the darkness again as the flash lights turned off when the marching column formed. I walked to the rear of the formation, wondering where the trail RI was. 

“Where are the RI and platoon sergeant?” I asked the Ranger in formation in front of me.

“I think the RI went back to base, and the platoon sergeant is up front so he can cheat the indirect fire response.” He said wired, I assume he had been sucking on a field made caffeine pouch from the grounds in our twice daily MREs. 

I was all alone in the rear, which made the grading easier for me and I would not have to walk up and down these mountains again after that night. The hand and arm signal to move out made its way back to me and I repeated it behind me, nobody was there but you are supposed to regardless. I conducted a press check on my M4 to ensure I had a blank round chambered and the magazine was seated and the walk began. 

Not 100 meters down the forest service road the distinctive shrieking whistle of an artillery simulator pierced the night. “Incoming!” Rangers shouted throughout the column as I threw myself to the ground as if the pending explosion was a real round. The explosion vibrated off the mountianside, “300 meters, DOT, move!” Commanded the platoon leader. The command was echoed back to me as I struggled to get back up and began the slow jog to end the drill. I encouraged the tired Rangers in front of me as we trotted on the uneven gravel towards the 300 meter mark. We made it, nobody fell out, my go was closer with every step.  I reported the pack count to the front of the column and we began movement again. Within 6 minutes we turned and marched onto a hiking trail collapsing the column to single file. Being back under the tree branches the shadows felt alive and I could almost make out the shape of faces in the trees. The little bit of the world I could see in green suddenly felt alive around me as we continued to move forward. Shadows moved unnaturally out of the corner of my field of view. It was windy so I assumed it was my exhaustion playing tricks on me.  

We marched up a switchback and over the wind and the rustling leaves I heard a whistle, “Incoming!” shouted one Ranger ahead of me and everyone joined in as we got down. But the whistle, it wasn't a shriek, it was melodic. No explosion came. 

“What the fuck Rangers!” Yelled the RI leading the file. I could hear and see the shapes of a handful of Rangers attempting to explain, swearing they heard a whistle. The RI realizing it was one or two making a mistake told them I was likely an echo from one of the other platoons a ridge over training. 

I leaned forward to the pair of Rangers closest to me. “Did that sound like an artillery sim to y’all, or something else?”

They looked at me with confused looks on their faces with wide eyes that looked pure black under the NODs. “No it sounded like a tune, I thought I was droning,” said the first Ranger. 

The wired Ranger from earlier said, “Yeah I heard a tune too, weird.” 

The continue mission signal made its way to the back of the file and the walking continued. I trudged along the trail scanning the woods surrounding me as the chance that one of the odd shadows I had been seeing could be OPFOR stalking us as that is exactly what I would do. The melodic whistling returned and a Ranger 10 meters ahead of me whistled a tune back that sounded sour like it was coming through cracked lips. I stepped off the trail and trotted up to the whistler. 

“Why’d you whistle?” I inquired as to why he violated noise discipline while in a tactical movement.

Blinking quickly the whistling Ranger responded puzzled. “Umm I do not know man, I was just replying.” The confused face on the Ranger clued me in that he was probably droning and not aware of much else than he needed to keep walking. 

“If you hear something, alert me and I’ll radio the PL for a course of action.” I told him as he began walking again and closed the gap in the file.

I stood on the side of the trail as my classmates walked by, some scanning the woods with the green light of their NODs illuminating their faces as they gazed into the shadows. Looking towards the end of the file where I would rejoin the line the sleepy Ranger walked off the trail to the left side of the direction of travel towards the dancing shadows of the trees. I hurried over to him, whispering as loudly as I could without it being just talking. He was not far, no more than 3 meters from the time he strayed off the trail but there was no sign he could hear me. The Ranger had his weapon in the high ready when I caught up to him, I grabbed his ruck and he swung around leveling the rifles blank firing adapter with my face. 

“What the fuck.” I said pushing the barrel down away from my face.

“Did you not hear that? Somebody was calling my name ‘Richard' from over there.” The Ranger manically spouted out pointing to what looked like a game trail that was wreathed in shadows that the moon light did not illuminate. I smelled the odor of rotten meat from that direction. I used my IR(Infrared) Flood light on my rifle to allow me to see through the darkness and I saw nothing but disturbed under brush 3 meters in front of us off of the game trail.

“I think you were droning and spooked a deer that ran off, lets go.” I ushered the Ranger back to the file. While walking back onto the trail I saw in the middle of the file another Ranger wandering off to the trail to the left. I keyed my radio to the platoon net to alert the leadership. 

The platoon leader responded, “Halt, third squad go grab your guy, we move once complete.”

I kneeled with the wired Ranger pulling rear security as we waited. I stood up to see what was going on and could see three Rangers walking back because their flood lights were on. The radio crackled. 

“This is Third, Douglas thought someone was calling his name in the woods, charlie mike.” Third Squad Leader reported. I felt a sense of dread and fear that I had not felt since a dreadful Halloween in college or the camp fire stories told around the camp fire in the Ozarks as a Boy Scout. I turned to the wired Ranger. “Keep your head on a swivel.” 

“What you think Bigfoots out there?” he laughed back. 

“No.” I responded as we stood up to continue marching for a few minutes before he said something again. 

“Hey man, do you see faces in the trees?” 

I looked around at the trees in the direction he was looking and did not see anything but made him aware of what I had seen earlier when we turned on to this trail. 

“This is getting fucking weird.” he responded as we walked. 

“Contact left!” Yelled out a Ranger towards the front of the file. A dozen M4s and a couple automatic M249s began firing blank rounds into the trees. I followed the IR lasers showing where the Rangers were looking and I saw a shadowy figure running back into the woods and back towards me and the rear of the formation. My radio squelched to life and the Squad Leader that called out the contact reported what they thought was OPFOR had charged the formation. The weapons squad opened up with one of their M240s towards the entity, drowning out all other noise with controlled bursts from the belt fed machine gun. The figure moved fast towards my position looking like it was avoiding the sounds and flashes of blank gun fire, it moved in an animalistic way through the trees. It cut towards the column and lounged into formation before the Rangers started shooting. Three Rangers fell backwards on impact and started rolling down the hill. Those still standing there started shooting blanks at it. I moved towards the scuffle, the entity was more visible as it was attempting to pull a Ranger into the woods. Well over 300 pounds of man and equipment was being dragged away like a child. In the direct moonlight I could make out its form, a gaunt figure with its skeletal frame protruding from tight skin, its legs bent with extra joints and the mouth was humanlike but the flesh around it was ripped and torn. It looked directly at me, its eyes were deep set in its sunken face, eyes glowed in my NODs. 

I arrived at the site of its attack and saw Wolf. 

“Grab two and follow me.” I commanded. 

“Roger.” Wolf responded, grabbing two fellow Rangers to follow us and directed others to assist with the three who were thrown off the trail and now lay between 5 and 15 meters down the slope. 

The four of us followed the being as it attempted to abduct our classmate for what purpose I could only assume. We engaged with sustained fire with our rifles that continued to distress it and it dropped the Ranger. It howled with broken noise that sounded like a rasping bear that unsettled me as I stood between it and our retrieved our classmate. It lowered itself onto all fours and galloped away shirking. Once it was 15 meters away it faded into shadows and disappeared into the dark forest from whence it came leaving an odor of decay and rot.

Wolf and one of our squad helped the saved Ranger up as the RI called out “Endex!” announcing the end of exercise, Wolf looked at me confused. 

“Was that OPFOR?” He asked.

I backed up to him keeping my rifle at the low ready as I loaded a fresh magazine into it and scanned the forest. “I do not think so but the RI sounds confident that it was an exercise.” I responded. 

Wolf gave an attempt at bravado, “Damn OPFOR really took spooky season to heart.”

This all unnerved me to my core, I was shaking with either adrenaline, or exhaustion, but I knew it was not the cold. 

Wolf's team, the rescued Ranger, and I rejoined the platoon as the last of the trio of Rangers were pulled up the steep slope, their falls had been slowed and stopped by brush and trees. I returned to the rear of the formation passing by Rangers that showed no sign of comprehending what just happened, they were all still droning even after all of that. I radioed the platoon leader reporting that men, weapons, and equipment were all accounted for, I did not want to be on this trail a minute longer. The march continued and when I received the hand and arm signal to move out I did not pass it on out of the feeling we could still be followed.

After what felt like another 15 minutes we left the covering of the thick canopy of the trail and began movement on a forest service road as we normally did. I looked back at the trailhead and there were what still looked like faces hidden in the trees. A melodic whistle cut through the cold breeze as if it was saying come again. The wired Ranger turned around and asked. “Did you hear that?”

I turned to the column and continued walking, “No.” I said coldly. 

Half an hour later I received my go as the Patrol Base was being set up for the platoon to sleep. I asked about the thing that attacked us. The RI only referred to the contact with the ominous being as an “OPFOR probing attack” and claimed the sleep deprivation was causing mental breaks. I know there was something else, college showed me that there are unseen forces in this world. There should be a new location for Ranger school because there is a darkness that stalks Appalachia.
