The day is January 12th, 2023; time of recording is 5:43am. Doctor LaMeu presiding, special psychiatry task force. The victim was transferred to our custody roughly two hours ago, and we’ve only been able to communicate with him just now. The following is his written statement.

…

All my life, I’ve had problems sleeping. When I was a child, it was the monsters under the bed, the ghosts in the closet, or the gremlins in my drawers. When I was a teen, it was insomnia, anxiety over tests or girls, and the occasional Mountain dew induced binge.

But I’m an adult now, in a stable relationship at a stable job. I eat right, work out, and even took up meditating not too long ago. Still, I stare up at the ceiling some nights, others I sleep fitfully and wake up in the morning with aches and sores. The nights where I get more than three hours of shut eye are few and far between, and the only reason I can function during the day can be attributed to modern medicine.

I don’t remember when it started, or for how long it had been going, but I remember when it turned for the worse. It was that day I jolted awake, not a particularly unique experience, except this time I felt my limbs spasming in a brief but violent frenzy. Somehow Nylah slept soundly, with no indication that I woke her, not even an annoyed grunt as she made sometimes when I would disturb her rest. Before my limbs jerked and mind returned to consciousness, I heard a sound. Except what my ears and brain told me made no sense, and the thick haze of drowsiness added further doubt to my assumption. 

It sounded like a snap, like a branch had been cloven in two next to my head. I'd hoped that the mundane pondering of the strange sound, would welcome sleep – but I knew better. The quiet hiss of the heater, the gentle creaking of wood contracting in the cold, and the muted sounds of the world outside trickled into my ears. The thought of the strange sound and the noise outside kept sleep at bay until the sun finally rose, and Nylah along with it. I told her about my experience, to which she gave me an uninterested response. She knew about my history and how difficult it was for me to sleep. A sound jolting me awake in the middle of the night wouldn’t be a new terrifying concept to her, and it shouldn’t have been for me – *so why can’t I let it go?*

That day we went about business, overpaying for a mediocre brunch, running errands, and even went down to an outdoor rink for some ‘romantic ice skating’ as Nylah had pitched it.

When night finally came, my anxiety was louder than usual as it scratched at the back of my mind. *Will it happen again?* I wondered, unsure if another episode would ruin what little rest I could claim. That night, I adopted a new posture of sleeping on my side, which thankfully produced results, my mind gracefully slipping into blankness.

That night was one of the rare times where I dreamt. It wasn’t a good dream, nor was it bad, at the time I felt nothing – which frightened me the most. I was in our room, the lights were off, and I was in the bed next to Nylah, still on my side and seeming to be sound asleep. It was a strange feeling to be watching myself from another perspective. *However,* *it’s not like dreams are known for their normalcy.* Nylah slept on her back, her face smooth as the sheets rose and fell with steady breaths. A blatant contrast to her state, I was making a strange noise; like something between a wince and moan while my body shifted and twitched in short and jagged movements.

The vehicle for my dream was tall, almost at the ceiling. I slid across the carpet in a strange silence, the eerily silent movement made even more poignant by the muted noise that managed to creep through the walls. It was strange, watching me glide across the floor while I’d sent no commands for my legs to move. I don’t know why I never tried to stop moving, or to wake up. Perhaps some part of me knew it was a dream, and that I wasn’t in any true danger. I felt calm, which was especially odd when a hand reached out towards my sleeping self. It was not a normal hand, wielding spindly digits of hairless, pale skin, fingers much longer than normal and thin like chopsticks. I remembered the chilling indifference, an empty boredom that dulled my thoughts and left me uncaring as the milky digits pressed against the back of my head. Immediately, my sleeping form stopped twisting and uncomfortably rustling. My body froze for a second, almost as if the fingers instructed me to be still.

*It’s helping,* I thought. Not a second later, my body jerked, limbs spasming once more. Blinking in confusion, my eyes were open. The world was now sideways, my vision doused in ethereal blue from the moonlight creeping past the blinds. It took my mind a few seconds to put the pieces together, but when the memory flooded back in, I quickly turned over. Eyes snapping to where I’d been standing in the dream, there was nothing, just an empty wall.

For a while I tried to make sense of it. *What happened? What did he do to me? What did I do?*  Massaging the knotted muscles at the back of my head while staring off into the distance.

As my thoughts drifted, different possibilities flittered into my mind space. *Did that even happen?* I wondered at some point, it wouldn’t be the first time my overactive mind conjured a dream to explain the soreness in my knees or back when it twisted into uncomfortable positions. I’d had those moments before, but this felt different. The dream felt real, aside from the odd hand reaching out there was no strangeness that often accompanied my dreams. What’s more, the pain felt poignant and unique, like frostbite tore through the back of my head after lying on blocks of ice.

Nylah woke that morning with a content smile, stretching in the sunlight like a satisfied cat. Just as I finished explaining last night, she cut me off with her own explanation, that it was my aches and pains caused the dream. It’s like she knew that I had been considering that exact possibility, and a loud part of my mind was more concerned with it being an invention of my mind than the truth. For hours I sat there, mind circling around the possibilities. I knew how I looked to Nylah. There were a few moments where she entered my eyeline and we spared a few words, but I never left the bed. I didn’t take in her reaction, but I imagined it ranging from annoyance to concern.

Minutes blurred into the next, eventually turning to hours, and before I’d noticed, the sun was well on its way down. As it neared the horizon, warm, orange light reflected through our window. In a dazzling array of refracted light, it painted narrow spotlights against the opposite wall. One stray beam inched towards the ceiling, eventually catching on a small object nestled between the walls and ceiling. Hot, white light then reflected into my eyes, forcing a wince as it knocked me from my ponderings. It was so small, and nearly the same shade as the darkened walls, I’d forgotten it was even there.

*The nest camera,* I realized in a sudden rush of clarity. Like a layer of snow shaken off a buried tree, my mind sharpened. I rolled out of the bed, legs wobbling as they struggled to bear the weight after a day of lethargy and atrophy. But I made it to the dresser, where I’d left my phone last night. It had been months since I used the app. Once I’d confirmed that I didn’t sleep walk, the motion sensing camera facing our bed was largely unused. I’d customized the app to only save any footage from the night before, so I was surprised when several clips were available for my viewing.

The first few were all of me tossing and turning, rolling onto my back before settling back on my side. However, the first clip to truly earn my attention started at 3:06. Staring at the screen for a few long seconds, confusion started to bubble in the back of my mind. *What am I looking at here?* Something had to have tripped the motion detecting, infrared sensor, yet there was no movement on the screen. The clip played for its minimum of fifteen seconds before jumping ahead.

The next clip was from 3:12, by my eyes, it seemed that it was another clip of nothing that lasted exactly fifteen seconds.

Then the 3:21 clip started, and I was starting to see a pattern. It looked like the same video had been copied three times over, me on my side asleep next to Nylah. I raised a finger to exit out of the video, only hesitating when I noticed a flicker on the edge of the screen, barely detected by the subpar night vision mode in the slight lighting. It was like a shadow of a figure, or an artifact of the grainy video. It would have been invisible in a still image, but I spotted it when the grainy shadow moved slightly.

The figure was like a whisp of smoke, billowing from a flame unseen. It stood above the nearby dresser, and was much taller than the bed, the fuzzy image gliding slowly across the floor. It moved incredibly slowly, its pace so relaxed I was surprised that the camera even detected it. It took a few minutes for it to arrive at our beside, every excruciating second building a sickening sense of dread inside me. A glimpse of the shadow shimmered, a movement streaking across the screen, and then it froze.

I couldn’t tell if the image froze, or if the shadowy figure just halted as it had almost seemed to do several times already. Then before I could think to stab the screen in frustration, the clips abruptly skipped ahead.

My brain struggled to filter what my eyes were showing me. After a day of doubting and wondering, the proof was there. Next to my bed was a figure of milky white skin, its surface seemed smooth, devoid of hair or markings. It was tall and thin, seeming to be completely naked but missing any creases or muscles – it looked closer to a mannequin than a person. 

As I blinked, the video skipped forward once more to where the figure was leaning over the bedside with an impossibly thin arm carrying unnaturally long, and thin digits held out. It was exactly like my dream, *except I suppose this means it wasn’t one.* Frozen at the point where my dream had ended, the thin appendage and fingers were held out hovering over the bed near my head.

The screen tore again, a ripple of static tearing through the image as it jumped forward. At this section of the clip, its fingers were pressed against the back of my head. I’d stopped shifting and turning, now seeming completely still as the pointers poked my head. From the fingertips glowed a soft yellow light, illuminating strands of hair from the base of my skull. Slowly, the glow turned from yellow to orange, its intensity increasing as the light became more prominent. After a few excruciating seconds of stillness, my breath caught, and I realized I’d been holding it since the video started. 

I forced an exhale, and sucked a slow breath in, expecting the video to jump once more. Except this time, the video kept playing, and the orange glow quickly started to darken. As it turned red, the glow softened, its intensity seeming to dull under the new character. *Is this what did it?* I wondered, a hand rubbing against the dull pain that continued to throb in the back of my head. Almost as if to answer, the red light seemed to pop in a sudden flash of strength. With it my body jerked abruptly on the video, back arching as if electricity arced through me. Just as quickly as the spasm had gripped my body, the thing ripped its arm away, taking the red glow with it.

Once more, the screen buzzed with broken pixels and it skipped to a scene of me lying on my back staring at the wall where the thing approached, confusion stricken across my face as we were alone in the room once more. *It grabbed me…or something.* “What is it?”

My eyes snapped up from the phone, still wide from the shock of what they saw. Her brow was furrowed, hands on her hips while looking to me a flicker of annoyance on her face. I stared back at her in silence, a few seconds delay before I found my words. “It’s real.”

“Not this again,” she said with an exhausted dismay. “I told you. You slept weird and now your neck hurts, it happens sometimes.”

I swiped frantically at the screen, “no it’s real. Look.” Turning the phone over, she paced across the bed, a skeptical look of concern on her face. 

“What am I looking at here?” Then she seemed to actually look at the screen, her eyes narrowing into a lethal expression. *Shit.* I scrunched my features, the face I made when she caught me doing something that would make her mad. Her shoulders immediately tightened; head cocked as she twisted the screen to give her a better view. “What the fuck is this?” she hissed.

Tilting the screen down, I reached my hand around her. “Babe, hold on.”

Her hands pushed me away with some force, “don’t fucking ‘babe’ me. Are you kidding me with this?”

“It’s not what it looks like.”

“Really? Because it looks like you have a perv cam pointed at our bed. Are you putting this shit online? Do I have an OnlyFans I should know about?”

With some space between us, I felt comfortable enough to snort with a smile. She didn’t enjoy that, lunging towards me with a hand raised. But I managed to catch her wrist before the open palm slapped across my face. “No,” I said tersely, “remember when we were concerned about me sleep walking?” She didn’t speak, but I saw the flash of understanding loosen her features. “It’s just there to see if I’m sleep walking, I haven’t used the app in months anyway.”

Ripping her hand free, she crossed them across her chest. “Show me what you need to show me.”

“Look,” I said, pointing at the screen. With bated breath I waited while we stared across the screen. The seconds passed with a dreadful slothfulness, but as one melted into the next, we still didn’t see anything. *What?* I wondered, and as my eyes cast to the edge of the screen where the shadow had first appeared – I had my answer. “No,” I whispered. I could feel her gaze shift from the phone to me, a concerned look on her face as I scrolled through the video. It was almost five minutes long, and seemed to be a still frame of us sound asleep. There was no figure, no glowing light, only my past self jolting awake at the end of the video. 

“It’s here,” I muttered, swiping across the screen to skip back and forth through the clip.

She slid off the bed, indifferent of my desperation to prove myself. “I’m leaving.”

I cocked my head to the side, fingers frozen. “What?”

Feet carrying her to the closet, she paused to audibly sniffle, back of her hand wiping at her face. “To my parents. You need help, professional help.”

I felt like my legs were frozen, leaving me unmoving on the bed. “You can’t go.”

“I can’t stay,” abruptly swinging open the closet and pulling out an empty duffel bag that had been stored at the bottom.  “I need time to think,” she said, unable to even look my direction while she threw some clothes and underwear into the bag. I should have protested, begged her to stay – do something. But I didn’t. I just sat there, petrified on the bed while watching Nylah pack the bag before walking out the door. 

The house was quiet, quieter than I’d expected. I hadn’t realized how much I would miss the clattering of dishes or noise from whatever she was watching on her phone or the tv. Despite how exhausted I felt, I didn’t once feel hunger or thirst; in fact, I barely moved except to adjust the folding of my crossed legs when they became too numb.

In my hands I held the black screen of my phone, it had died a few hours ago, drained from my constant replaying of the video. The footage seemed unaltered, yet it refused to show me what I’d seen on that first viewing. With the depleted device in my lap, I stared at the wall, wondering if Nylah was right. I wondered if I’d reached my limit, if something in my brain had finally snapped, unable to be kept operational by the battery of pharmaceuticals and sheer will. I wanted to believe it was real, but knew how little sleep I’d been getting. With a sigh I fell backwards onto the bed. U*nable to sleep, how lame is that?* I thought while flashing a smirk that oozed self-pity. The irony of it was that I almost immediately fell into the unconscious black after barely a minute of staring at the ceiling had preceded the new dream. 

Once more I was in my room, except I’d skipped the preamble of slowly gliding across the room, and the dream began at my bedside. Ahead of me, my sleeping form was on its side, back turned while taking in slow and heavy breaths. Just as it had last time a hand of painted white fingers reached out for the back of my neck. 

I couldn’t let it happen again. If I’d conjured everything, and it was all in my head, then I had full control. With that knowledge, I imagined myself standing at the height that my eyes were showing. I commanded my face to wrinkle, ordered fingers to pinch the flesh on my arm – anything that might wake me from the dream. Regardless of my input, the dream continued unperturbed, a narrow hand reaching towards the exposed skin of my neck. I tried to grind my teeth, and even opened my mouth to scream. It was as if my voice had been stolen, it felt as if I’d shouted, but only the quiet ambience of my empty home filled my ears.

Milky fingers a few inches from the base of my skull, I tried to scream again, and found failure again. As I held my mouth open in a desperate protest, a thought flashed into my mind. 

I stuck my tongue out and slammed my teeth down on it – hard. 

Eyes shooting open, I was back in my bed, an arm tucked underneath the pillow and a thin crust of drool hardened at my mouth’s edge. With my free hand, I turned quickly in the bed and reached out. To my surprise, my grip wrapped around the cold wrist of a towering figure. I didn’t let go. My grip instead tightening as the rest of my body flinched in surprise. The thing was taller than I expected, nearly reaching the ceiling even while its neck hunched over and shoulders seemed dropped. Despite its kowtowed posture, the sheer size of it left me grasping for words.

As I’d seen in the video, it was completely naked, but its body looked more like a marble statue than that of a simply pale human. However, its face was nothing like that of a person. Its oddness demanding my full attention, as I laid in silence, unable to look away. Its head was also hairless, a stretched oblong shape with a crease down the center, running from the top to the bottom of it. Two columns of two jet black eyes dotted the edge of its face. With no discernable pupils, I couldn’t see where it looked, but I felt like its chilling gaze was pointed at me. It had no mouth, made no noise, and stood as still as I was. It seemed equally frozen by my latching onto its wrist, the smooth chest remaining still as if it didn’t need to breathe.

Twisting in the bed, my head snapped to the side. *Nylah.* But she wasn’t there, only an empty fold of the blankets that had been her side of the bed. I cursed silently as my mind slid into a panic.

Looking back to the thing’s face, a single eye blinked open underneath both columns of the two black orbs. The new ones were different from the other four, distinctly larger and seeming more human with a white surface and coloured pupil in the center. Except the pupil was a neon purple, so bright I had to squint my eyes and even considered looking away. The bright purple eye blinked forward a few times then snapped down to focus in on me, the sudden shift sent a chill almost as cold as its wrist racing down my spine.

Then a loud crack reverberated in my ear, like hidden fingers had been snapped. One second, I was in my bed, holding on to the thing’s wrist; the next, it was like I’d fallen over. I came crashing down on the hardwood floor. It was like nothing I’d ever experienced, a buzz of static crackling through my limbs. The fall had been short, but it was so sudden I could feel my chest tightening from being winded slightly, as if I’d been knocked on my back. I still felt the chill of its appendage between my fingers, and once again I tightened my squeeze onto the thing.

It took a moment to take in my surroundings, and process what happened. Somehow, the thing had moved us from the bedroom to the living room in the blink of an eye. It was like I’d been dropped on the floor, winded slightly and in the same posture I’d been in my bed. Now pulled closer to the floor, the thing bent over slightly, still staring at me while I held onto its wrist. “Help,” I croaked to no one in particular, suddenly aware of how dry my mouth was and how few words I’d spoken before collapsing into bed.

Along the crease, the upper half of its head split open. The two flaps of milky flesh peeled itself to the side, it seemed to have no further use for the black orbs that I’d thought were eyes. The mouth that had opened where a forehead would be was a gaping maw of blackness, its interior lined by pinkish flesh that glistened with moisture. My stomach churned at the sight of it but couldn’t look away. I twisted my head while watching the thing from the corner of my vision. “Help!” I shouted with everything I had. This time, I felt the sound echo in my throat as my voice filled the quiet home.

In response, the thing leaned forward. The abrupt closeness of its face and the cavernous hole, made me flinch. Head turning further, I tried to sink into the floor, a desperate attempt to put distance between its face and mine. *Distance.* Realizing that I still gripped its wrist, I quickly let go of the hand and rolled onto my stomach.

With both hands free, I started to crawl across the warm wooden floors.

But the thing had other plans. I barely made it a meter when a cold hand gripped my ankle, its frigid digits sending chills through the pant leg of my sweats and up the limb. Immediately, I tried to kick it free with a shout of exertion, but its hold was like a vice grip. Its fingers clamped on my leg in a squeeze, the instant pressure sent bolts of pain racing up my leg. My mouth opened to scream, but I was robbed of the chance as an unreal strength pulled me downward across the hardwood floor.

Something in my leg popped, and I took the opportunity to howl in pain at the floor. It must not have liked the sound because another hand grabbed a fistful of the back of my shirt and twisted. The fabric pulled, threads and stitching audibly tearing from the stress it failed to withstand as it spun me around.

On my back, I felt a jarring whiplash, like my brain had been rattled. Despite the pain racing throughout my body, I laid in a stunned silence for a few moments, eyes cast upward to the figure staring down at me.

From the murky blackness that had been the opening of its face, something white appeared. Operating on an instinctual level, I thought I could no longer be shocked. I’d given up trying to discern reason from the horrors unfolding. All I could think of was getting away. Yet the thing that looked down on me, locked up my limbs and widened my eyes. From its mouth two pale hands sprouted, their palms were facing me while conjoined at the wrist, ten bleached fingers fanning out in a crescent. The conjoined hands hovered for a moment, just long enough for me to take in the sight, then snapped forward like a striking viper.

The open palms pressed against my mouth, cold as ice while its longer fingers secured its hold on my face. Before I could react to the coldness of the smooth hands covering my mouth, they grew warm. The sensation was instant, and panic gripped my mind. I tossed and turned, but its hold on my face was strong, my neck quickly protested with its own stabbing pain as the frantic flailing proved useless. Instead, I swung balled fists at the thing. I couldn’t generate much force from my back, but each time it felt like I was punching a steak, subtle slabs of muscle and sinew covered its torso. Finding failure at the body, I tried for the face, but the arms attached to its torso were still free, and ice-cold hands grabbed onto my wrists before slamming them into the floor.

Held down and trapped, I was only left with a pitiful struggle. I attempted to wiggle a few times, but halted when the hands that had been pressing warmth against my mouth retracted. It still held me down, but with my face released from its grip, a part of me relaxed slightly. I felt fine, I wasn’t in pain as I’d expected, my lips feeling a pleasant warmth as they were pursed tightly. 

Then it released my hands, rising slightly to return some distance between us. The conjoined hands continued to retreat, slinking up into the mouth until disappearing completely. The cavernous maw was still held open, but I felt a strange ease with the oblong face. It took a few moments, but my senses eventually did return to me. *Run. Get help.* Pulling in deep drags of air, I blinked in confusion. My heart was racing and I’d been panting heavily, but my lips refused to open.

Ragged breaths filled my nostrils, each one shorter than the last. Slowly raising fingers to my face, I touched my mouth – or where my mouth had been. Instead of lips I found smooth skin. 

*No.* “Help!” I wailed, the muffled sound rang in my ears. With nowhere for the noise to go, it banged around inside my head, vibrating my vision and sending the painful buds of a migraine into my head. I didn’t care how much it hurt, I screamed again.

When my vision steadied once more, it felt like an hour of screaming had passed. Though, I’m sure it was closer to a minute. My head ached with the pangs of a fully matured migraine, my exhaustion also brought a profound resignation to my mind and body. Still the figure stood there, leaning over me.

Distracted from my wallowing and despair, my eyes flicked to the conjoined hands shooting out from the opening in its face. My body jerked with a new wave of panic, but I was too late. The hands snapped forward, and my head flinched as they came shooting towards me. The cold hands this time firmly placed over my eyes, the balls of the palms pressing into my sockets as the long fingers wrapped around the sides and back of my head.

The warmth was fast, pouring from the hands onto my face. *NO.* I knew I was too tired, and it was too strong to fight – still, I threw my shoulders and twisted my body to try and wriggle free. A second later I felt the pressure release from my eyes and everything was black. Shaky breaths came in and out of my nose, deprived of the two senses that could enable my escape, an undeniable dread finally settled in my mind. If there was a faint fool’s hope before, it was now gone. *It’s over.*

Next, the hand grabbed my leg. The loud snap rang in my ears and I was falling once more. For only a few milliseconds I was in the air and landing softly on a thick bed of snow. Cold air raced over my body, the howling wind singing in my ear. Just as I’d lost it, a flutter of hope entered my mind as I realized where I was, it had taken me outside. It was the middle of the night in the suburbs, but I’d thought I could maybe flag someone down. 

As quickly as the hope had come, it dissipated when a loud buzzing came down from above. I wondered what the sound was, and quickly received an answer as weightlessness gripped my body. It felt as if I was falling, as if gravity no longer existed. But I knew this couldn’t be true. I felt air rushing past me, and despite my lack of vision I knew the truth. *I’m going up*. The sensation didn’t last long, maybe half a minute of me floating, cut abruptly short with the thundering boom of metal on metal, like a gate had just been shut.

Like the instances where I was thrown from my bed to the living room, then to the street, I dropped on the floor. There was no snap, but I knew I had been taken somewhere else. The surface was smooth and warm, a familiar sleekness to it that I could only assume was polished metal. I sat up, instinctively turning my head left and right – despite my blindness to everything around me. I tried to listen for clues but there was nothing, no quiet buzzing of electricity or hissing of gas travelling through pipes.

I should have been terrified, but I felt no longer capable of that emotion, like the corresponding chemical responsible for it was tapped out from over usage. *Which probably isn’t not far off from the truth.*

Between breaths, I listened for anything, and wondered if I was alone. After what felt like a minute, I thought it must have been the case. But then a wide hand pressed against the side of my head. I flinched, a quiet moan of surprise echoing inside me. Just as I recovered from the stunned surprise, I realized what was happening. 

Another set of hands clamped over my other ear. “No!” I howled. I didn’t care about the migraine that leaped to the forefront of my senses. Hands shooting up, I grabbed on to the cold wrists. I pulled with everything I had, twisting, and yanking at the frigid appendages.

“NO!” 

I kept pulling.

A gentle warmth tickled at my ear. 

“STOP!”

It kept going. 

“Please.”

My mind knew what I said next, I felt the vibrations and the corresponding pain in my head.

Yet, I only heard silence.

*I don’t know how long it’s been. I don’t know where I am. I don’t know who I am.*
