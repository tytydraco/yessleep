I’m gonna get back out there. I’m gonna socialize. I’m gonna get back out there. I’m gonna meet new people..

This has sort of become a mantra for me. I’m an awkward, shy, introvert. I really always have been. It just wasn’t as difficult when I was a kid in school. I went to a small school and never changed schools, so I had pretty much corona with my classmates. It wasn’t difficult to be myself around them.

It was a few years after graduating that I realized how bad my issues really were. I always saw myself as the mellow guy in the group. The easy going, chill one. I hadn’t realized before that my ability to socialize was propped up by friendships that began when I was five, six, or seven years old.

As my friends started to move away and I stayed back in my little hometown, I realized that I had an inability to socialize alone. I couldn’t approach a woman at a bar and spark a conversation. I had difficulty even holding a conversation. It was like my brain would momentarily turn off in social situations. Then I would walk away thinking about all these things I could have said.

In any case, I’m making an effort to get back out there. I’m not gonna be a loner anymore. I’m done spending Friday nights alone. I need to get out and meet some new people, and that’s exactly what I’m going to do tonight!

I’ve been preparing for this. I’ve been having practice conversations in the mirror. Thinking of interesting topics and responses to common questions. I’ve binge watched a few popular shows.Squid game. Spoiler alert, no squids.. Breaking bad. Spoiler alert, Malcolm‘s dad breaks bad. Game of Thrones.. Honestly I couldn’t make it through that one. I almost didn’t include that bit in this journal because I don’t want any death threats or angry messages. Haha. The point is that I have some shows to discuss if that would interest a potential friend or lover.

I decided I would start the night at a bar. Just gives me options. It gives me the option to have a few drinks and lower my inhibitions. I need to be very careful with that because when it comes to me drinking, there is a very fine line between completely sober and embarrassingly obnoxious drunk.

The main point was to try to find a fun atmosphere that people are willing to meet people at .I could sneak in to some sort of celebration and act like I’ve been there the whole time. I could have the bartender send the lonely girl at the corner of the bar a drink, then give her a quick wink when she receives it. I don’t see beautiful women sitting alone at bars in real life as often as I do in movies, but it could happen.

So now I’m here. I’m sitting at the bar and I have my drink. A beer and a shot to loosen up, then just beer from there to remain focused. It’s pretty crowded and I’m feeling nervous, but I got a spot at the bar so at least I’m not standing awkwardly alone in a corner.

I’ve been sipping on my beer and pretending to watch the game for about a half hour now. I’ve been trying to scope out potential friends and lovers without seeming creepy. It’s hard to tell if there’s more potential for friends or for lovers, but if I were to find a lover I would want them to be my best friend as well. I’m a self proclaimed hopeless romantic, which in reality probably just means hopeless..

Nope! None of that negative energy! Nothing is hopeless! If you set your mind to something, you can succeed! You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take! Something else inspiring!

Okay, i’m back again. I took a walk around the bar and tried to act casually. The guy brushed shoulders with me and apologized. I told him it was perfectly fine, then I offered to buy him a drink. He politely declined and in hindsight, I’m pretty sure he thought I was hitting on him. 0 for 1 so far, but at least I talked to someone! It takes a spark to ignite a forest fire! This guy is my spark!

I’m back again. It’s been about a half hour since I wrote the last paragraph. I’m 0 for 2 now after trying to join a group of people celebrating something and doing shots. They sniffed me out pretty quickly. This one was pretty embarrassing, and I felt that I could use another shot of my own.

Another hour has gone by. Still no luck, but I believe the stars may be aligning in front of my very eyes! It’s getting late and closer to closing time. The crowd has thinned out a bit. I look over and I see a beautiful woman sitting alone at the bar. It’s like poetry. This unlikely scenario that I mentioned earlier could be actually materializing!

I feel like I have the perfect level of buzz for this. I’ve got those butterflies and I’m feeling a little nervous, but I’m going to do it. I’m going to send her a drink. I’m not sure where I’m landing on the wink. I’m picturing it, and it seems creepy.. once I am done second-guessing, I will order her a drink.

Success! She came over! She’s in the bathroom at the moment so I’m going to write this down quickly, but she actually came over here! The bartender pointed me out as he served her the drink. She immediately got up and walked over. I braced for rejection, but she was kind!

She said something along the lines of “So did you only buy me a drink because you don’t see women drinking alone at a bar very often?“I replied with something along the lines of “Uhh.. yea, well no! I mean.. umm.. you looked nice..”Somehow, she was charmed by my nervousness. So far she seems easy to talk to as well. She isn’t very intimidating. She seems pleasant and friendly. Could this be a friend or a lover? I gotta be careful, because I will take friend if I can get it. I will live in the friend zone. I’ll buy a timeshare there!

I just excused myself to the bathroom before last call. I’m trying to work up the nerve to ask her to go home with me, or at least hang out a little longer. I don’t even know what’s open this late.Maybe we could hang out at a gas station like Jay and silent Bob. Maybe she’ll give me a kiss goodbye at the doorstep like in a romantic comedy. Or maybe… Just maybe, I’ll spend one Friday night doing something other than watching television and movies..

She actually asked me if I had seen Breaking Bad. When I excitedly said yes, she told me she hadn’t seen it and laughed. She’s funny. I love that in a friend! I like it in a lover!

I’m back again! I’m currently in an Uber pretending to text. I bet you’re wondering if I’m alone in this Uber.. No! No I’m not!

We left the bar after the owner politely yelled for everyone to get the hell out. When we got outside, there was a familiar awkward silence. I felt a sense of dread as those anxious feelings crept up. Then out of nowhere, she asked if I was tired or wanted to stay up longer! I told her I was down for whatever, and now we are on our way back to my house! We just might have a lover on our hands!

I am now in the bathroom at my house. Things are going great! We put a movie on, but we’ve been talking so much that we haven’t even been paying attention to it! The conversation is just flowing! I am still nervous, but I think I’m ready to make a move. I better get back out there so she doesn’t think I’m pooping. Wish me luck!

Has the suspense been killing you? I bet you’re wondering how it went. The answer is perfectly! It’s like a real life fairytale! Everything from the nerves early on in the night. The failed attempts at making friends. It’s been a real roller coaster!

Oh what a night! What a marvelous night! It’s taken a long time to work up the nerve and the courage. It’s taken a lot of practice.. but I think I may have found both a friend and a lover!

The sun is just starting to rise now. It’s the most beautiful sunrise I’ve ever seen. Hopefully the first of many that she and I will experience together.

I’ve been up all night long. I’m too excited to sleep! I already have her gutted, skinned, and salted! Taxidermy has been a very difficult skill to learn. It’s taken a lot of trial and error, but I believe that I’ve finally mastered it!

Soon, the process will be complete. She will be preserved and we will be together forever. Both as friends and as lovers. I’ll never have to worry about saying the wrong thing or seeming awkward or weird. We will never fight. She will never hurt my feelings. She will never judge me. She will love me just as much as I love her. Best of all, she will never leave me like the others..

We will sit on the front porch and watch the sunrise each morning. We’ll binge watch all the popular TV shows together. This is like a dream! A fantasy come true!

I got back out there! I socialized! I found a friend, and I found a lover. If that isn’t a happy ending, I don’t know what is..
