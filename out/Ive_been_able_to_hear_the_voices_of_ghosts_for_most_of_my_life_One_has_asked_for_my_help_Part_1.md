At first they thought it was schizophrenia.

My parents took me to several different medical facilities to try and treat it, but never to any effect. Most professionals agreed that I lacked many symptoms and signs of schizophrenia in a female child, which is what I was when the voices first appeared. MRI tests came back showing my brain was completely ordinary.

Still, I struggled with hearing voices throughout my childhood and into my adulthood. The location was the most important factor in how difficult dealing with them was. Places where more people died, especially hospitals, was my equivalent to walking into an ongoing construction site. Dozens of overlapping, unintelligible sentences, screams, cries.

Other areas weren’t as bad. Spots on the edge of town, my home in the suburbs, really any place that hasn’t been consistently populated for long, those were much easier to handle.

You see, not everyone that dies comes back as a ghost. Some of the old myths about ghosts are true, like the fact that only people with some kind of unfinished business remain behind. They don’t necessarily have to have negative reasons like revenge. Some ghosts remain to look after a loved one or to see the immediate aftermath of their life choices.

Another myth is that ghosts are tied to this world forever. It’s not true. Most fade away within a decade. All those stories you hear about some haunted doll from the Victorian Era or a tortured peasant from the Dark Ages are false. Maybe they were true to begin with but they don’t last.

How do I know all this?

I’ve been talking to ghosts for over half my life at this point, you don’t think I haven’t tried to figure out how it all works?

I’ve made friends with some of the spirits. I’ve been heartbroken when some of their voices started getting quieter and quieter until they faded away.

I used to know an old lady who lived in my house before I did. Her and I would talk all the time. She helped me through more than a few of my cringier middle school crushes that went sour. All she wanted to stay for was to see who would inhabit her beloved home after her death.

I grew to love her very much, but I don’t talk to all of them. In fact, I don’t talk to most of them. The spirits don’t know I can hear them until I let them know I can, and I found out early on that I don’t want any of them following me around. It’s really hard to think when there’s a couple dozen disembodied voices around you at all times.

That’s why when I found out my parents were going to move to a big city after I graduated, I told them I wasn’t going with. They knew about the ghosts but never really believed me. Regardless, I had enough money saved from my part-time high school job that I could afford to move to a small town on the edge of the Colorado Rockies.

I’ve lived in this small town for three years now and it’s been the best three years of my life.

Why?

No ghosts.

I haven’t heard a single voice since I moved here. The small house I rent is near some hiking paths on the outskirts and even when I go into town, the only voices I hear are those of the living. I’m sure some people that die here do turn into ghosts, but clearly not enough of them to notice or to bother me. Then again I suppose it’s also possible I just don’t go out often enough. If you had my condition, you’d probably develop a similar light case of agoraphobia.

I first moved out here in 2020 and managed to land an online job because of world events I’m sure you’re familiar with. I’ve been able to keep the job so that I can work from home and spend less time around the dead. Really the only time I leave my home is to go shopping once a week or to go on a hike for a little fresh air and some exercise.

It was on a hike a few weeks ago that I broke my streak of not communing with the no-longer-living.

I was on one of my routine hikes through the trail behind my house. The air was particularly sharp in the Spring mist. This year’s Winter had lasted from October to late March so it was incredible to finally get back out on the trails without having to be bundled up like a mummy or drudge through thick layers of snowfall.

The trail was fairly devoid of people, more so than usual. Luckily none of them were particularly chatty either which meant that I was able to keep my earbuds in throughout the hike. But my music was interrupted by the horrific wails of a woman somewhere in the wilderness.

*HELP ME!* She screamed. *DEAR GOD, PLEASE!!*

Over and over again I heard her crying and shrieking for help. I rushed towards the origin of the voice. Branches snapped back and stung at my arms and face, but the urgency kept me going at full velocity.

It had been so long since the last time I’d heard a ghost that not once did I consider the possibility that the voice was not that of the living.

I was so invested in the emergency that when I broke into the clearing of the blue spruces the sight of the body alone nearly knocked me off my feet. The screaming of the spirit was drowned out by my own shrill screeching.

The corpse was torn apart. The bloody flesh was strewn about over the mountain rocks. The body was face down but besides that I could not tell much else from the carnage.

On instinct, I ran. I ran down the trail looking around constantly in fear of bears or wolves or anything which would cause me to end up like that woman. I saw no one else on the path. No one else the entire long trip back to my home.

Into the house, deadbolt locked, and as soon as my heartrate had slowed I pulled out my phone to call the police.

My nerves refused to steady. My hands trembled as I made myself a cup of tea. My breaths felt forced from my chest. In and out and in and out with so much pressure that I collapsed onto my sofa.

As I stared up at my ceiling, as the kettle whistled somewhere far away, I could only visualize the redness. I could only see the gore. The horrific stench of decomposition and the haunting screeches of a woman’s last moments.

I got no work done for the next two days. The experience was still too fresh to allow me to think clearly of anything else. On the third day, I attempted in vain to hype myself up for work. I told myself I had to meet my quota so that I wouldn’t lose my job.

I sat down in my home office with another cup of tea. The millionth one of the day and one which did nothing to calm the visions. All the tea did was make my visions more erratic and my bathroom breaks more frequent.

I booted up my laptop and opened a new window for my browser. Not long into my work I got the sudden urge to look up the local news. I was afraid of what I might find, but I was more afraid that without closure, I would never be better.

It was the first thing on the online newsletter.

**Local Woman Brutalized by Wildlife on Popular Hiking Trail**

**Authorities Warn Citizens to Keep Clear Until Safe**

I attempted to process the information but was interrupted by a voice from behind me. A voice which made me jump and spill my drink across the rug.

That’s not what happened.

Those were the words spoken by the voice. Then they were followed by more.

*So you* **can** *hear me.*

I stayed still for a moment. I watched the tea soak into my carpet. The damp stain spread over the rug just as the blood had on the mountain sand.

“I can,” I said. I rotated my office chair to where I assumed the voice was standing. “But I can’t see you.”

*You saw me at one point. Three days ago. You heard my calls for help.*

I talked with her for a while. I explained to her, like I had always used to do for other ghosts, the extent of my communication.

Hearing yes.

Seeing no.

Helping never.

*What do you mean you won’t help me?* She asked, horrified.

“How can I? I’m just some person, not a vigilante.”

*You’re the only one that can help me because you’re the only one who can hear me.*

“You don’t even remember who killed you. You just said they got you when you were turned around.”

For a while it was silent. I wondered if she had left until she continued by saying,

*I don’t remember it all. It’s fuzzy, yes, but I know I saw a person. It had to be one of the people I saw on the trail.*

“That doesn’t much narrow it down,” I stammered, rather more shortly than I had meant to.

I heard a faint sobbing which immediately made me feel terrible.

*Please. Please help me. You’re all I have.*

So now I guess I’m a detective. Now it’s up to me to figure it out. I’ll update you guys when I can, if I can.
