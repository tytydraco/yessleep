I will describe to you what happened to me this morning.

The alarm clock went off. Before I even open my eyes, I wonder how the night went by so quickly, how it is that I slept for so many hours and feel the full weight of fatigue on me, how it is that I can't drag the warm blanket off of me on this cold morning. I open my eyes and turn off the alarm clock. The time is 6:40. I'm getting ready to catch the 7:00 bus to work. As I leave the house, the wind blows me hard. And I'm hit mercilessly by the cold wind, as I'm tormented by my hunger (I didn't have time to eat breakfast), as I'm bothered by the fact that today is a Wednesday or a Tuesday, I don't remember and I don't care. And there I am thinking about how I don't want to go to work on this boring, cloudy, cold, gloomy day, I see a colleague at the bus stop. He says "good morning" to me, but I reluctantly shake my head at him, as if recognizing his greeting. I'm not sure I remember his name... His face is familiar, but I don't remember his name. Anyway, how can he be so social this early in the morning? Ah, if only it were Friday! I wish I had the afternoon to rest! But it's not. And just when I'm thinking that on a morning like this, when the sun itself is tired of waking up, I should be the one to wake up, the bus appears.

Reluctantly, I enter the wretched vehicle. It should have been built at least 30 years ago, its condition is deplorable. I get my ticket punched and head for what looks like an empty seat. The people who take this bus are few, so I easily find a seat. But it's such a strange atmosphere today. No birds can be heard, nor can you see many cars on the road. It seems as if the whole city, people and animals alike, are sleeping peacefully, unaware of what's going on in the outside world.  Sunrise came a few minutes ago, but the sun is so weak behind the thick curtain of grey clouds, that all it manages to do is not to light up the city but to show how much fog there is today. All of nature has averted its gaze, hidden us in the mist, no one is looking at us. A really strange feeling.

I looked at the time, it was 7.09. The lousy machine was late. Not that it matters, of course, I begin work at 8.00. I take the 7.00's because I work out of town and usually the ride takes half an hour to 40 minutes. After everyone gets in, the engine starts. As we drive through town, I see a car. A red car, the first, and probably the last, of the ones I've seen and will see on the road today. The silence of sleep begins to feel more like the silence of death to me. After all, sleep is the cousin of death, or so an ancient Greek proverb goes, or at least that's what I remember the teacher at school saying. But what nonsense am I thinking so early?

The bus just left town and this nonsense is back in my thoughts. Now that we've left behind every sign of civilization, now that we can't see the houses, the closed shops, and the parked cars on the side of the empty road, we've lost every external sign that proves there is a society beyond that bus: the only world I will know until 7. 40 will be the world of that bus, still half asleep and drowning in the heavy silence, which is broken by the occasional roar of the engine. Oh, and the trees. Let's not forget the trees and hills, through which the bus now passes. I should probably stop reading philosophy before I go to sleep. It's making my head spin the next day. Solipsism and other related nonsense... all meaningless. Let's live our lives simply, without this nonsense. I'm cold. I'm cold and hungry. I just want to go to work, finish work, and return home.

As I watched the bare tree branches through the fog, out of the corner of my eye I saw the screen with the bus stops in the front change. I look closer and instead of the next stop, it read "Welcome to the Legion". I stare at the message in wonder. What could it possibly mean? Could it be some kind of stupid commercial? Possibly. Could the driver have been bored and thought to write something silly to give passengers pause? Maybe. Not that it matters to find out, I couldn't care less at this point. I don't care about the driver's pranks right now, I care about getting to work so I can get the job done.

I look at my watch, the time is 7.22. So we must be about halfway there. We're about to enter the village, which is the last stop before work. I'm bored out of my mind. Every morning the same bus torment. When am I going to get a car... The first houses are starting to appear in the evocative landscape. The driver stops at the bus stop and four people get in. The doors close tightly, the engine starts and before I know it, we have left the village behind. One of the new passengers looks strange, a little out of his mind. Anyway. The village is swallowed up in fog. Funny how the bus doors work. Once they're closed, they're hard to open from the inside. Most of the road is now behind us. Now there's just one straight stretch left and we're there.

Already 5 minutes had passed since we left the village and suddenly there was a loud, unusually high-pitched sound. For only 3 seconds and then that was it. At least it broke the dead silence, that's something. Anyway, in all the years I've been taking this bus, this is the first time I've ever heard a sound like that. As soon as that noise was heard, the text on the screen changed and now read " Unity is the only way". I may have more important things to deal with, but the string of strange events is starting to stress me out. It's probably that solipsism from yesterday.

We're almost there. 10 minutes tops, no more. What?   How?  Why? I don't understand. Just when we were supposed to continue straight, all straight for 5 more miles, the driver suddenly decided to turn onto a dirt road! The turn is so steep that it threw me onto the glass of the window. That's it. He can write all the crap he wants on the screen, but can he change the route at will? Of course not. Someone needs to go talk to him and get off the dirt road. I don't care what he does, as long as he gets me to my job. That's what he gets paid for. To get people to their destination. Not to turn onto dirt roads that lead nowhere. Where are we going, really? The road is now becoming very bumpy, and the trees, which were relatively sparse on the main road, are now becoming dense. It is very difficult to see anything outside the bus with all the fog and dense forest. Anyway, I'm going to go ask the driver why he turned. He better come up with a good excuse.

No one else seemed to be affected by the wrong turn. I have to get up because no one else will. I lean on the front seat to get out of my seat. As I barely walk down the aisle to the middle, I unconsciously look at my hand as I grip the handle to keep it from falling off. My thumb is a reddish color and I feel my hand a little damp. The moment I looked at my palm to find out where this color came from, I saw a gruesome sight. A bright red liquid covered the entire surface of my hand. A liquid that looks like... It can't be! It's blood. Where did it come from? Did I cut myself somewhere and not realize it? Am I bleeding? Have I lost that much blood? At the sight of the blood, my head feels light like it's emptying, I feel a little dizzy. A jolt of the bus from the dirt road brings me back to life as I fall to the floor. Blood! More blood! The whole floor is covered in a thin layer of blood. What's going on in here? How did this happen? As I get up, in my confusion, I see that the windows have also turned red, dripping everywhere. What kind of sick and twisted joke is this? But the seats too! The seats are throbbing as if they have a pulse, a strong, rapid pulse. I'm on the verge of madness, of paranoia, I can't believe my own eyes. I look around to see how others react to this horror. No one. No one reacts. No one! I shout, "Don't you see what's happening! There's blood all over the bus! Can't you see? Why isn't any of you talking?", but I don't get an answer.

I go to a gentleman sitting in the front seat. I grab him by the shoulder and shake him: 'Excuse me, can't you see what's going on here? Are you all asleep?" I look at his face. It's pale, devoid of signs of life. Eyes wide open turned up as high as they can go, and mouth slightly open, dry and unmoving. He looked like a corpse. A corpse, yes! And just as I'm trying to look at the situation calmly and rationally, suddenly the corpse in front of me, this skinny, dehydrated, pale little man, moves his mouth. He moves his mouth, but nothing else, and answers my earlier question, "Nobody sleeps. I see more than you think. I am Legion, for we are many" This answer shakes me to such an extent that I am completely confused. The only reaction I could manage to accomplish was to slap him hard, just in case he came to his senses. But as soon as my hand touched his almost dead face, something pulled me or something pushed me, I didn't understand in my confusion, and I found myself on the floor again.

Now even the walls began to turn into throbbing flesh, bright red and hideous. They began to swell and contract, enveloping us all, like the inner walls of some beast's viscera. That's what we are! The food of a beast, into whose stomach we willfully entered. The blood was now flowing down the former bus to our ankles. It began to coagulate and form large, almost black, gelatinous clots that made walking difficult. I went to break the nearest window before it was devoured by the ravenous and ever-growing amorphous mass of flesh. I can hardly see anything through this window, so red has it become. On the roof, veins, arteries, muscles... I bang on the window a few times to see if I can break it but to no avail.

Suddenly I hear a loud, shrill, deep voice, not coming from one direction, but coming from everywhere: "Stop individual. You have no right to oppose the many. You must become one with the many.". "Who are you?" I shout desperately. "I am Legion, for we are many." "What? What does this mean?" "It means that I am the many and the many are me. I feed on the blood of the many and in return, I carry out their common will. For there is a single will of the multitude and you, an individual that you are, dare to defy it. Your blood shall be mingled with that of the multitude, your flesh shall be ground with that of the multitude, your bones shall be crushed with those of the multitude, and above all, your will shall be one with that of the multitude. You will dissolve your ego into that of the multitude." I now realize that this voice came directly from the beast in whose bowels I am. Machine and flesh, blood and wires, have now become one. A monstrous organism that feeds on humans. Not just with their bodies, but with their minds. Not with their brains, but with their minds! It captured their minds and homogenized them, and whatever unholy came out of this process, it adopted it as its purpose.

I bang on the window again. There is no hope of getting out of the doors. They are firmly shut. If I don't break this window, I'm a prisoner of the monster. Where it goes, I go. I remember again that the bus - I mean the beast - is on the move. Even if I jump out the window, I might die from the fall. Of course, it's the only hope of salvation I have. The abomination growls. I don't know what to do.

The monster spoke again: "Remember that nature hid me in the mist and the forest. Until 7.40, I am the only world you know." "Let me go," I shout at him. "You're part of me. You're in my viscera. Your desire will be broken before the will of the crowd. Isn't that what you call democracy? You will submit and dissolve into the crowd like a drop of water in the ocean. Your ego is already dead. My ego, which is equivalent to theirs survives.". "This is not democracy! You can't have a just regime without moral citizens. If the citizens are perverted, the regime will sooner or later become perverted itself. If the crowd, which you represent, decides to throw itself into the depths of hell, why should a person who is moral follow that decision?" I hoped that my words might convince the beast and let me go. There is no longer any choice but persuasion. The glass is not going to break.

The "many" replied, "If you don't share my vision, leave. You are free. No one forced you." The moment he said this, the window opened wide. I am free! I can leave this horrible nightmare! I stuck my head out of the window. I looked at the road. The monstrosity was going incredibly fast now. If I jumped out, I would land on my head. I hesitated. I didn't know what to do and put my head back in. The window closed with a loud bang before I even knew it.

The crowd says: "You have chosen the path of unity freely." "At that speed, I would have been killed. How could I jump out?" "The circumstances surrounding your decision are not my concern. You had the opportunity to risk your death or to comply and participate in something beyond the limits of your individuality. You chose to remain a drop in the ocean." "But that's madness! We are heading for destruction!" "Destruction is relative. The dissolution of your individual self may be a disaster for you in your present state, but it is a triumph for you in your future state. There can be no civilization without the surrender of liberties by the individual, and for you, the only civilization is me, the many." "Of course, the individual must give up his freedoms that cause unrest in society for the sake of peaceful coexistence, but in a truly free society, these restrictions do not encroach on the value of each individual. The whole has value, but the persons who make up the whole also have value. That is why it is important to defend the cohesion and morality of our society, to protect the individuals that constitute it. You, the multitude, in this case, trample on the will and physical integrity of all to impose the vile mixture that constitutes your desire. When the desire of the multitude is immoral, what is the point of submitting to it?"

The windows were now covered with flesh. There is no source of light. The crowd cried out: "You are within the multitude of your own accord. What my purpose is and whether it is worth pursuing even by trampling on your very person is not your concern, for you do not exist. You are already part of the crowd, part of me.". The lack of light combined with the words of the multitude left my trembling voice unable to utter another word. I begin to despair, filled with anguish, fear to the death, indignation, anger. I begin to punch the flesh covering what used to be the window. "Every punch you throw makes me stronger, all the energy you spend gives me power." I notice that every time I punch its flesh, some of my own is torn from my hands. Every time I touch it, it consumes me as if I were mere food. Every drop of blood I spill, it absorbs it. There is no solution. I have to accept reality. As long as I stand, I will live in excruciating pain. When I get tired and fall down, it will eat me like an appetizer. There is no escape from this outcome.

After all, the idea of being part of something bigger doesn't sound so bad. Through the crowd, I could accomplish some purpose in the world. Sure my personal value is being violated, but what can I do now? Nothing. Only accept the greatness that the beast has destined for us, the crowd. Unity is the only way. Together we are strong. The multitude will always consume individuals in society.

I write all these now, in my last hour as an individual. This is a testament to the power of the many.
