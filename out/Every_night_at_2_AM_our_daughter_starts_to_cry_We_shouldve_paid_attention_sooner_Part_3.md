I felt my skin crawl, as my eyes began to wander the room instinctually, the thought that there had been cameras in my house without my knowledge…made me feel *ill*.

All of the sudden, it felt like from every corner there might be eyes watching, distant perhaps, but watching me all the same. 

“I’m calling the cops now,” he continued, though his voice seemed to have drifted into the background. 

“And the goddamn realtor tomorrow. This is - it’s *ridiculous*, it’s invasive, it…”

He trailed off, and I could see his eyes on Abigail in my arms, glistening with tears I knew resulted from a feeling of frustration and powerlessness.

“I’m - calling them now.” He finally said with a sniff and a nod, gathering himself as he grabbed his cellphone and made his way out of the room. 

I just sat on the edge of the bed, head swirling with half-formed thoughts and eerie suggestions, the memories of the day before - Abigail's escape, and my apparent encounter with…whoever had been following me in the parking lot - all seemed content to gnaw away at my sanity. 

Strange, and paranoid thoughts began to force themselves to the forefront, lack of sleep, terror, and the paranoia of discovering I had, in my own house, been watched and listened in on by…somebody, served as ample kindling for their fires.

The police were at our house nearly an hour and a half later. Allen walked them through the events of the day, everything from my escapade that afternoon to the inexplicable events of the night. Four officers were dispatched, two stayed with Allen in the living room listening to his account of it all, the other two I led from room to room as they searched the house.

“Do you guys have any idea what this could be? How can we find out who’s behind this?” I’d asked, as I led them from the laundry room and up the stairs towards Abigail’s bedroom.

One of the two officers accompanying me shrugged, a short, hispanic man with kind eyes and a wide face.

“We can’t be sure of anything, ma’am. We’ll get the devices your husband gathered into the tech guys and see what they can determine.” 

He pursed his lips, giving an apologetic smile as though he could tell the answer wasn’t what I wanted to hear. Still, I nodded, leading them into Abigail’s bedroom and flicking on the lights.

“This is our daughter's room,” I said, “Where she was sleeping when -'' I didn’t feel it in me to recount the events of the previous night again, the very thought draining. The other officer nodded, stepping past me and beginning his search of the room. 

“If you have the means, you might consider staying in a hotel for the foreseeable future,” he kept his voice low, and in his expression I could see a level of care his sterner partners felt lacking.

“I’m a parent, two daughters, one of em’ barely older than your little girl. I know how scary this has to be. I’ll do my best to make sure we stay on this.”

I could have hugged the man in that moment, Officer Ramirez, according to his badge. He’d been the only of his colleagues to treat the situation without an almost clinical sort of coldness, and it made me feel somehow less hysterical about it all.

“Thank you,” I muttered, wanting more to say but finding nothing. He nodded, before joining his partner in the search.

They were gone fifteen minutes later, Officer Ramirez leaving Allen and I a number to call if anything else unusual happened, and with that, my little family was alone again in a house that suddenly felt so much less like a home than only that morning.

Any hope of sleep was long gone, and I spent the next few hours pacing the bedroom and hallway, Abigail in my arms, my mind moving faster than my body could manage. Allen tried to stay up with me, but with work in only a few hours, I encouraged him to get some sleep around 4, promising that Abby and I would stay close.

We did, spending the hours until light began seeping through the blinds in dusty rays in the rocking chair, until my eyelids grew heavy and sandpaper-like. 

“You gonna be okay here, today?” Allen asked me, his eyes watching me through the standing mirror while he worked at his tie.

“You can always go stay at my sisters today. Tracy would be fine with it if -”

“I’m fine, Allen.” I interjected, exhaustion robbing me of any tact, my voice sounding harsher than I’d intended. 

“I’m - I’m fine,” I repeated, softening my tone a bit. 

“Maybe, if she’s free, I’ll call Tracy later and see if she can watch Abby for a bit while I get some sleep.” I offered.

Allen frowned, but nodded, seeing clearly that there would be no point in an argument. As he completed the final buttons on his shirt, he made his way over to us, kneeling down to plant a kiss on Abigail’s cheek, and then my own.

“We’re gonna be okay. I know last night was…” he trailed off, “But we’re gonna be fine.”

I nodded, smiling, though the expression failed to reach much of my face. As he rose to leave, making his way for the door, a thought occurred to me. 

“That stupid damn bear you got her, can you bring it here?” I asked. “I think I threw it in the crib when the cops were here, sorry, I’m exhausted and just really don’t want to get up and risk waking her so I can listen to screaming for the next three hours.”

He fixed me with a quizzical look, and for a moment I wondered if, in my exhaustion, I’d misspoken somehow. Finally he smiled, chuckling to himself.

“Sure boo, I’ll grab it,and I dunno what you mean ‘**I** got her’. I'm tired of her lugging that thing around as much as the next guy, but don’t put the blame on me.” 

I felt my eyebrows raise, mouth opening in search of the question I felt struggling to form through the fog of my mind, but he was gone and off in search of the bear. As if responding to the sudden rush of my thoughts, Abby stirred, cooing to herself in her sleep, and in my heart I knew I would stand between a train, a bullet or anything else for her.

“Here it is,” Allen’s voice stirred me from my thoughts, the sight of the large stuffed teddy making my skin crawl, my gaze moving to those cold eyes from the night before.

“Thank you love, you can just leave it here,” I nodded beside the chair, and he obliged.

He placed his finger under my chin tilting my head up for a final kiss before heading for the door. As I watched him leave, I felt a vague sense of deja vu, and his words from before seemed to drift to the forefront of my mind.

*“I dunno what you mean ‘****I*** *got her’. I'm tired of her lugging that thing around as much as the next guy”* He was being humorous, that much was obvious by his tone, and yet it didn’t seem like he would lie about that detail, even as a joke. It was too minute, too…random for him to simply be teasing me.

I wanted to call him back and inquire further, but the groan of the garage somewhere below told me the opportunity had passed, and with my phone across the room and a sleeping baby in my arm, I relented on the idea.

Instead, I found myself staring at the bear. I realized I had never really taken the time to look it over, why would I? How often does anyone deeply examine their children's toys, the thought had never so much as occurred to me. However, now that it was, details previously taken for granted, suddenly seemed odd under scrutiny. It was big for a stuffed animal, almost half of her size, and unwieldy as all get out to have her constantly carrying.

As I leaned forward slowly, reaching for the toy while trying not to wake Abby, I felt the wrap on her injured wrist brush against my skin, sending an awful chill through me that momentarily dissipated whatever unsavory thoughts I might be having of getting rid of the thing.

I grunted under its weight, with only one arm free it never ceased to amaze me the weight of the thing. I raised and lowered the stuffed bear, gripping it by the ears, as though somehow my arm might realize it had miscalculated how heavy a pile of stuffing and fabric ought to be. 

Perhaps it was the accumulation of paranoia after a night of events that would serve to make anyone paranoid, or perhaps, it was a far too delayed reaction of that mothers instinct. 

I can’t be certain, all I’m sure of was the disquiet I could feel creeping through me like the unwanted caress of cold fingers against my back as I struggled with the unnatural weight.

I twisted the bear so that its back faced me, moving my hands through its fur in search of any sign of a zipper, or button, or some sort of opening. As a child, I could recall the first time I’d received a fancy toy of any sort. 

It had been a doll from my parents, one of those electronic ones that could cry and babble like a real baby, and I could recall just as easily having it taken away after flinging it at my sister during an argument. I hadn’t meant to hurt her, but being a kid, I’d failed to account for the small, plastic box at the center of the toy which housed all of its electrical components, and the resulting gash it caused had me grounded for half of the summer.

As I searched Abigail's toy, my arm starting to quake with the prolonged effort, I could almost feel the weight of that doll again, from all those years ago.

I adjusted my grip, grabbing the toy around its stomach and pressing down. My heart jolted, settling into a rapid pace, as I felt my hand close around something hard and square. My eyes immediately settled on its stomach, on the thin line stitching that I had hardly taken the time to notice before, assuming it to be a sign of wear and tear. 

Now, it seemed almost threatening. I stood from the chair, and carefully made my way over to the bed, settling Abigail at the center of it as gently as possible, before heading over to Allen’s bedside table. I pulled the drawer open, rifling through all of the miscellaneous junk, old chargers, and ancient mail, before finding what I was looking for, a rusting pair of construction scissors. 

It was the only pair we had in the house despite many a mental note to buy another, and necessary to what, despite intense mental debate, I knew I was going to do. In the back of my mind, I could already hear Abigail’s future tantrum when I had to deny her the bear, until I could manage to sew it back up, but in the moment all that mattered was finding an answer to the question at the center of my mind.

I pushed the tip of one of the scissors blades through the faint line of stitching across its stomach, cutting carefully along each of the stitches until an opening large enough for me to fit a few of my fingers was made. For a moment, I found myself pausing over the stuffed animal, a strange sort of apprehension gripping me from inside. I needed to know, to abate the fears forming in my mind, every bit as disquieting as they were unclear. 

Without another second of hesitancy, I pressed my index and middle finger into the bear, digging through its innerworkings, mostly cotton and what looked to be old rags were shoved beneath its skin to fill the stuffed toy, until my finger fell against something cold, hard, and plastic. 

I tried to get a grip of it, struggling and failing not to widen the tear as I forced my hand in after whatever lay at its center. I listened closely for Abigail’s sleeping breath, the only sound over the faint rip of fabric, as my hand closed around the object. 

It felt like a box of some sort, running my fingers up its shape, something seemed to extend from one of its corners. It was thin, a thread perhaps? No, whatever it was, I was certain it felt of plastic, not yarn or any sort of cloth thread. No this felt more like …a wire.

My heart kicked into motion like a prize racehorse, sending an icy-hot wave of adrenaline washing through me. I gave up on any sort of care, the breath in my throat coming quick and uneven now, as I set to digging through the stuffed animal like wrapping paper, until what lay inside was revealed.

I pulled hard against the box, feeling a great bit of resistance from within, straining until, with a sudden *pop*, it shot loose nearly sending me careening off of the bed. As I collected myself, I looked over what I held. It was a small white box, maybe 4 or 5 inches across, on one side a series of holes were placed in the same configuration one might see on a phone…or a walkie talkie. On the other sat a switch, unlabeled. 

I immediately recognized the design of the thing, or something of the sort at least. It was eerily similar to that which had been inside of my own doll years ago. Except that was meant to be electronic. As far as I knew, this stuffed animal was meant to be only that. 

Beyond all of that, there was one difference between the object I held now, and that I had seen in similar toys.

I felt my mouth run dry. The wire that extended from it was a pale green, and when I saw what dangled uselessly at the end of it my stomach tightened like a fist. Hanging from the end of the pale green wire, sat one of those cold, glassy eyes. 

The thoughts in my head descended into a hurricane of thoughts and things I ought to do, call Allen, call the police, burn the damn thing, and yet I sat, staring as if somehow it might change the disturbing reality of what I was seeing. It was a camera, I had no doubt about that, a camera lens made to look like the glass-eye of my baby girl's  stuffed bear.

My hands shook with such force, I was certain I might drop the thing, and my stomach flipped 180°. I quickly grabbed the eye, closing it in my palm, the fear that somehow it might still be active and whoever was on the other side watching me, making my skin crawl. 

My chest ached with the racing of my heart as I pulled until my arms strained, until I heard a snap and the eye broke free of its wire. I stared at it for a moment in my hand, the object making a faint mechanical whirring that grew quiet by the second, and all I felt was rage. Without thinking, I tossed it without thinking, sending it careening into the wall, and scattering into a shower of small electronic components.

It was all it took to stir Abigail awake. The tears were immediate, it had been hours since she’d been given anything for the pain and I could only imagine it was the first thing she was aware of, and the thought made my heart ache like I’d been stabbed. 

It was all more than she deserved, everything; the recent speech issues and temper tantrums, the injury, everything that had happened in the past 48 hours, it felt like I was failing in every way to protect her. 

‘*Painkillers, where are her painkillers?*’

My focus momentarily split, I scanned the various shelves of our room for the mild-pain killers we’d been recommended, eventually finding them on my dresser. I rose, quickly making my way over to the little orange bottle. As I turned to make my way back I heard it. 

A faint whirring click from that little white box. It was followed immediately by the sound of static, hissing like a broken television, and through that static I could hear that voice again. The distortion was greater than before, but I could hear it more clearly than ever sitting atop my bed.

‘*Little bear, don’t cry…. come ….ay outside.*” even with the electronic distortion, my blood ran cold. 

It was as though a lightbulb had been set off in my head, recognition blooming amidst an equal amount of cold, sharp dread and blazing anger. I watched in horror as Abigail slowly grew silent, eyes opening and hardly bothering to take notice of me as she seemed to search the room for the source of the voice, her eyes falling on the bear, splayed open only feet away.

“Daddy?” she spoke with bleary recognition. 

All at once, it felt as though the struggles of the past several weeks, once appearing separate, but equally distressing issues, suddenly revealed themselves as one. 

I made my way to the bed quickly, scooping Abigail up as though the bear itself might take hold of her, and grabbing my phone off of the bed. 

“*...lit…come…adventure..*”, the hiss of distortion grew, the words in between becoming lost in the storm of sound, and yet all I could do was listen. 

That voice, I hated myself for not recognizing it sooner, though we had only spoken once before. It belonged to our neighbor, the old man next door who’s first name I could hardly even recall. 

My husband hadn’t given Abigail the bear, I realized. Her father was the most present man in her life, ‘daddy’ being the only name she would think to call the voice speaking to her in the night…

I opened my phone, immediately navigating to Allen’s number and pressing the call button. The seconds between each ring seemed to stretch on for an eternity as I waited.

“Hello?” my heart leapt at the sound of his voice.

“Allen, I know what’s going on,” I said, so many things I wanted to say at once, my thoughts still in a whirlwind, I struggled to even determine where to begin.

“Are you okay, you sound freaked out?” his voice came quickly, the panic audible, “Is it happening again?”

“Yes, Allen, yes, just listen, I know who’s doing this. I know who gave her the bear. It was Melody, the old guy next door.”

There was a moment of silence from Allen’s end, on which I could hear movement.

“Sorry, I needed to get out of the office, what do you mean he gave it to her? I thought you -”

“No, no, we both did, we never thought to ask because of course we wouldn’t. Allen, listen, I’m going to take Abby to your sisters, I want to get her away from this place. I’ll call the police on the way, if you still have Officer Ramirez’ number call him too.”

I could feel myself speaking at a mile a minute, but felt unable to cease, moving about my bedroom just as frantically in search of my keys. On the bed the box continued to hiss and crackle faintly, and through it all I could hear breathing and…movement? 

“Hold on,” I breathed to Allen, ears perked as I tried to hear through the foggy audio. 

It sounded as though there were…two voices, loud and yet far too distant for me to hope to make out anything being said. Still, even without being able to make out the exact words, I knew the sounds of an argument.

The realization only hastened my search as I tore drawers open and tossed pillows and sheets aside with my free hand, all the while Abigail screaming in my ear.

“O - okay, alright I’ll do it now. Just get to Tracy’s please, I’ll call you back, keep your phone close. I love you.”

And with that, he was gone. With a sigh of frustration, I gave the room one more look, seeing no sign of the keys, before resigning to check the rest of the house. I knew that when they weren’t on my bedside nightstand, most of the time they’d be found on the small table beside our garage door. 

I was on my way out of my room, when I heard two things that made me freeze, my heart falling through the chasm I felt in my chest.

There was a scream, audible through the speaker sitting amidst the cotton-strewn remains of the bear's insides… and somewhere in the distance. The hairs raised on my back at that realization, that it was coming from more than just the bear. Someone was screaming next door, a woman, shrieking bloody…

There was a bang, this time loud enough that there was no doubting whether it had been from the bear…or somewhere very, very close. 

For a split second, I felt frozen. The sound seemed to echo, an unmistakable crack reverberating through the culdesac, echoing over the speaker which fell silent immediately after. Abigail’s wails grew louder, my heart threatening to burst from my chest as I lingered in the horror of what I was certain I had just heard.

‘*The keys,*’ I thought, ‘*Find your fucking keys!*’

The thoughts spurred me into action, pushing me forth and out of the room, as I chanced one final glance in hopes of finding them.

I took the stairs as quickly and carefully as I could manage, hyper aware of the way Abby’s cries grew louder with the force of our movement. My mind felt torn in a dozen directions, like holding the leads to a pack of wild dogs, and the world seemed to spin as my head grew hot with sheer panic.

I hurried to the backroom where the door to our garage was, and felt my heart drop as I saw nothing on the table. 

“Fuck, where the fuck are my keys?!” I shouted, far louder than I should have so near Abigail, but the panic had frayed my nerves past the point of repair.

Her tears quieted for a moment, as she watched me with glossy eyes, her little face almost confused by the outburst. She looked between me and the table, and I saw that innocent little smile begin to play across her lips, as she pointed with one chubby finger on her uninjured hand towards the table where I had once felt so certain they resided.

“Daddy!” she waved her little fist, pantoming her favorite thing to do with either of our keys - waving them about for the noise - and in my heart for the first time in a while somehow, I felt I understood my daughter immediately.

My stomach did a complete 180°. Though I suddenly felt quite sure that my keys were no longer in the house, and likely hadn’t been since the events of the prior afternoon, I knew I had to be certain. I wracked my brain for where they could be. The kitchen was the only place I could think to look next, hurrying there with my thoughts feeling all the more scattered. 

There was nothing, no sign of them anywhere. I could feel a strange sort of helplessness beginning to seep in, and as I searched for some answer.

Without my keys, I had no way for us to get out, no way to escape the house, and if I was stuck I needed to be certain that help was on the way. I pulled out my phone, dialing ‘911’ and switching it to speaker. Quickly, I made my way to every door and window, ensuring each was locked, starting at the front of the house.

I peered out my front window, onto our street. An eerie silence seemed to have fallen over everything since the sound of the gunshot had rang out. Not even the usual odd bark could be heard. It seemed even the birds had gone into hiding. 

I craned my neck to see the house next door, and felt my blood run cold. Their front door sat wide open, a sight I’d never seen before at the home of Ms. Melody. She was the sort I’d heard berate her husband for leaving a window open and risking a ‘chill’, and as minute a detail as it was, it felt a surreal confirmation of my fears.

I set Abby down in the living room, needing every bit of movement as I continued securing the house. It was as I arrived at the backdoor, that a thought occurred to me, almost freezing me in motion.

‘*The police,*’ it struck like a bolt of lightning, the realization. *‘I still need to call the police.’*

I quickly pulled out my phone, working the locks with my free hand, and dialing the number, setting it to speaker.

I had arrived before the garage door, when there was an answer, yet as I stared ahead, feeling a nightmarish sense of deja vu like nothing I had known before, my mind felt filled by the sight of the open door before me.

A breeze rolled in, up the driveway and into the house, and somehow, it felt like the caress of death.

With it, came a single thought, laden in venom and horror that wracked me with tremors.

“Hello? Hello?” a man on the other end of the phone called, momentarily pulling me from my shock though terror coursed through every inch of my being.

I raised the phone to my ear, breathing my address into the receiver, and as brief a synopsis of my situation as could be managed. My final words sent a chill down my own spine.

“I need police as soon as possible please, I - I think he’s in the house.”

“Units are on their way ma’am, please stay on the line.”

As I stared at the open garage, I felt transported back to the day before, and with the feeling came only one thought.

*Abigail.*

I raced back towards the living room, not even bothering to shut the door behind me as I did so, my heart climbing higher into my throat with every step. As I turned the corner into the room, my eyes shot immediately to where she’d last sat on the couch. I felt my blood curdle, and struggled to bite back the scream I felt rising in my throat.

Abigail sat on the couch, in her hand a stuffed pink bunny, with which she was occupied. Behind her, holding her as like he bore some familiarity, was my neighbor. Mr. Alvin Melody, as I would come to know him, sat hardly bothering to acknowledge me as I entered. 

His leathery face was covered in trickles of deep red, which spread along his clothes and arms, a baseball cap hanging loosely atop his thinning silver hair.

I felt a fear like nothing I’d ever known, cold and sharp through my veins, along with a pain in my chest like I was being stabbed, but it all felt second to the rage.

“Get the hell away from her.” I hissed the words through clenched teeth, hardly even recognizing my own voice through the sheer hatred in it.

I peered over at the fireplace for a moment, just behind the couch, seeing my opportunity, I hurried over and snatched the poker from its place, brandishing it like a club.

“Get the hell away from her now!” the last part I roared, taking another step forward and raising my impromptu weapon.

He looked up at me, with eyes such a cold, lifeless blue it almost gave me chills, and sliding a single hand across the couch bringing my attention to what sat beside him - a single, 9mm handgun.

“Quiet now,” he spoke, in a tone that was almost casual.

“You don’t want to upset the baby.” he caressed Abigail’s head, the very sight making my skin crawl.

I could taste blood in my mouth, alerting me to the fact that I’d been biting my tongue. 

“Get. Away. From. Her.” 

He laughed, and it sounded genuine, and in his eyes, beneath mock civility, I could see a glimpse of something…*unhinged*. 

“Even backed into a corner, see how the mother bear roars for her cub.” he smiled, meeting my gaze with an unwavering stare.

“I like you, you know?” He spoke with a sort of familiarity that unmanned me, no hostility in his tone, just a cold sort of appraisal like some school principal. 

“Unattentive, perhaps, but you’re a good mother deep down. Your love for your little girl is…fierce.  Admirable. It’s a trait I wish my wife had had.” he spat those final words, his expression shifting for the first time into something hateful. 

“I had a daughter too, once. Her name, too, was Abigail.” he smiled down at Abby, who was utterly oblivious to the danger she might be in, distracted with her newest toy.

“I loved that girl as much as a man can love. More than I’d ever known I could. I spent months, sometimes years away from home as a military man. But it was always made better knowing I was returning to this…little person who looked at me as though I held up the sky.”

He smiled, though there appeared something behind it this time, something deeply sad, as he nodded to himself.

“My wife though, she - she never loved her like I did. Oh, she said she did but I could tell every time I was home, she resented how close we were.” His eyes narrowed as he looked at me.

“Sick woman, she was. I got the call when I was deployed, running comms for an operation overseas that my Abby had…” I could see that the man was struggling, his jaw tightening visibly.

My eyes fell back on the gun. It sat perhaps a foot or so away from him. I could be no more than four. In my head I tried to play out some situation in which I might advance on him before he could get to the weapon, either striking him with mine, or taking his, without risking mine and my daughters lives.

He seemed not to notice my split attention, his own so wrapped in memories from years past and likely the waning adrenaline and shock of his own actions.

“They say it was an asthma attack that took her. My Abby. But I know better, it was my wife,” he hissed the word like it was venomous, staring off and out the window in the direction of his home. 

I inched forward, moving so lightly it made my muscles burn but even still my heart bounded with the fear that the ground might creak beneath me.

“I’m sure of it. As sure as I was when I saw this little girl,” I felt my stomach tighten, and fought the urge to rush forward and strike in that moment.

“That day  you all first came to this house, and I heard her name, I knew what it meant.” 

He smiled at me, and for the first time any mask of civility, or calm was gone, a gut-wrenching, wide-eyed fanaticism in its place.

“My little girl had returned. I was being given another chance.”

“She is my daughter,” I couldn’t hold my tongue any longer, “You have spied on our family, you…you took her from my house, you are sick.”

Rage flashed like a supernova beneath his eyes, his smile falling instantly. 

“No, she isn't. Not anymore. And as to my…devices,” his lips quivered into a little grin, “The bear. Of course I needed to keep an eye on her. I wasn’t going to let negligence rob me of my joy again.”

I realized, listening to him speak, what I already knew - the man was…insane, beyond any sort of reasoning. The police would surely be on the way, and at his age, how far might he go before being caught even if he was successful? For some reason, the thought brought me no comfort, the opposite in fact. It made me realize there was no predicting how he might respond.

“Don’t think of it as all…ill-intentioned. That bear was my Abby’s, long ago. She loved it, didn’t she?” he nodded, smiling wide.

“Of course she did, that’s how I knew. You and your husband were very distracted on your moving day. I saw her sitting on the porch, and gave it to her while the two of you directed the movers. The way she smiled…I knew in an instant.”

He peered down at her, and every part of me wanted to swing down with the poker bringing it down atop his sun-leathered scalp. I fought back my instinct, instead inching forward once more. 

‘Keep him talking.’ It was the singular thought running through my head.

“What happened to Mrs. Melody?” I asked, wanting to hear nothing more about my daughter from that mans mouth.

He frowned momentarily, shrugging as his eyes met mine.

“She - she found out what was going on, always has been wary of me that one. As if our daughter didn’t die on her watch. Always said I was paranoid. Didn’t wanna hear it when I explained. Told me I was insane,” he chuckled like the assertion was unthinkable, “Told me I was *sick*. In the end, I did what I should’ve done all those years ago. Nothing should stand between a man and his daughter.”

He stared down at Abigail, planting a kiss on her hair, and it took every bit of strength I could muster to stop myself from leaping forth. Instead, I took the momentary distraction, and inched forward. There was perhaps a little more than a foot and a half between us now. 

If I was quick…

His smiled faded for a moment as he looked up at me, and for that instant I felt my heart stop in fear that he’d seen me moving forward, and had grown suspicious.

But the face he wore was almost apologetic, as he ran a hand over her injured arm, still wrapped from the E.R. visit.

“I assure you, this wasn’t my intention. I meant her no arm, or you, even yesterday. I was simply…worried. You can understand, I'm sure, how we care for our daughters.” 

‘*Swing. Hit him. KILL HIM.*’ Some primal, cavewoman part of my brain shrieked like a chimp attacking the bars of its cage, fighting for immediate action. I simply inched forward.

“I f - forgive you.” I managed, as genuinely as I could force myself to sound. 

To my surprise, his smile grew at that, as he nodded fervently.

“Good I - I knew you would. You’re a good parent, you would understand.”

“Perhaps,” he began, his eyes meeting mine. “Perhaps, you could join me. A girl deserves a good mother, and you and I could take care of her, we -”

The distant sound of sirens suddenly echoed through the air. The room filled with a silence that buzzed with awful tension. Slowly, his expression shifted, any of the previous affection replaced by a mask of animal fury.

The sirens grew louder, almost certainly somewhere down the street. 

“You bitch!” he spat the word, face going a deep red, animated in a way that almost seemed unfit for his age.

“You - you whore, you’re just like her!” He turned to see the approaching vehicles, still not visible yet though I could see the approaching glow of police lights through windows on the neighboring houses. 

They were on our street now. I had to act. 

“We could’ve raised her together!” he roared, still staring towards the approaching vehicles as if in shellshock.

“Abby,” I spoke, voice hardly above a whisper. 

Her eyes fell on mine, wavering between myself and the man, fear growing palpable on her little face.

“Go outside, go run. Go play!” I spoke, as quickly and with as much forced levity as I could manage.

To my relief she smiled, nodding, and sliding off of the mans lap, tottering past me and towards the open door. He turned to face me.

“We could’ve raised her happy, but because you wanted to be a fool, my Abby will have to be raised without a mommy.”

I saw his hand make a move for the gun. I raised the poker above my head. Everything seemed to blend into one long moment, time warping and melding and losing its meaning as there was only movement. His arm moving towards the weapon, my legs forcing themselves to close the distance, the poker raised high into the air.

He grabbed the gun, making to raise it at me. It was too late, I brought my arms down with a grunt, swinging with all the force I could muster. I felt a sensation like nothing I’d known before, my arms shaking with the sudden feeling of resistance, followed by a wet *crack*, as one of the poker's curved edges dug itself into the man's head. 

Our eyes locked in a moment that remains frozen in my mind, his wide, and searching, almost unbelieving of the fate dawning on him. For a moment I tried to pull, yet the feeling of resistance and the gurgling sound the man began to make made me stop, even in my hatred, that human part of me unable to go any further.

His mouth opened as though to speak, yet only a faint ‘c-c-c’ came forth. We stayed like that for several moments, frozen in a horrid union, until I found it in me to release the poker. His head swayed forward, then back.

With an almost staggering suddenness, he dropped back onto the couch going utterly and completely still. 

For several seconds that felt like minutes I stood there, processing the image of him, the reality of what I’d just done, before taking a breath. I had no time to mourn for myself, or grapple with ideological qualms.

I made a mental note to give it a thorough look, as I would be with all of her toys from here on out. But for now, for now, I felt there was no rush. Even if there was a device, I had the distinct feeling there would be nobody to take advantage of it.

My smile grew, a genuine expression despite the storm of emotions still under the surface. Something told me that Abby would be experiencing no more late night outbursts.

That night, after statements had been taken, Allen had arrived, and it seemed like a hundred calls had been made and received, we all had our first full night of sleep in [months.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SetiStories/)
