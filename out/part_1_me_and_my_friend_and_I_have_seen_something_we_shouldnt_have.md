Me and my friend got bored one day around 11 at night but we remembered something we could go to there was an abandoned house it must have been. Abandoned no longer than 40 to 50 years, we got In after a long walk that lasted 20 minutes to get there when we saw the house. It looked really beaten up plants was over grown all over the house. The red paint was almost nonexistent, the wood on the door. And the house was chipped, and Rowlett it looked like it was going to fall at any moment, but being dumb bored teenagers, we still went into. The house first thing I felt there was something or someone was watching us and then the smell of the inside of this house hit us. It smelled like rotting food and must have been like the people who lived here didn't take anything but a few things with them before they left in a hurry the. Shoes jackets hoodies just left a few feet a away from the door and the fridge and the furniture was left and the house made creaking noises almost ever step into the kitchen and the hallway into the living room. The house looked a lot better on the side , and the outside wasn't as broken down. we started to wonder why this place was. Abandoned than there was a sound upstairs. Sound it like something fall we looked at each other then he started walking out to the hallway then I started to follow him all the way.




To the stairs and walked up the stairs hearing every crack and creek all the way up the stairs. It looked nowhere near as good as it did downstairs there was 2 hallways and 6 doors and we went down the hallway in front of us we went in each door we split off to one side each of the hallway. To make the looking around faster, there were 4. Room 1. Bedroom 1. Bathroom 1. Spare room and 1. Master bedroom.  They looked like the hallway but just with more stuff in them, but then we heard something that. Stock me to my very core it was a deep dark laughter from the hallway we didn't go down, yet we went by the stairs and seemed the thing that made this laugh it had red eyes. And a black figure, but it didn't look transparent like a black mist it disappeared around the doorway. For some reason, we didn't leave then, and there we just had to go see. What it was we went into the room there was nobody in there no way out but the door then we heard the laugh in the hallway I seem only. For a moment before it went downstairs, we wanted to go to leave right then and there, but it was at the. Bottom of the stairs and all I felt was a deep hatred then the laugh and it was gone just like that we didn't wanna stay there for any longer. We started to run down the stairs out the door into town, and we both went home after and talked. About what happened the next day, but it didn't stop there for me.



The dreams the laughs the sounds the whispers the dreams didn't stop until my friend went back to the house when I seem him the next day he looked like a shell of himself but he wouldn't tell me what. Happened to him, but after that was the last day anyone.  Had seem of him, but I know he's in that house, and I will get him out of there, but I know that red eyed thing is not the only thing in that place
