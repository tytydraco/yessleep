I was sitting at my kitchen table with my laptop in front of me one afternoon, since I had chosen to work from home. I would have surely gone insane if I had to sit in a stale, boring office for hours while taking calls from angry customers screaming about their car insurance. It was already boring enough as it was. I sighed, pulled my laptop closer to the edge of my kitchen table and put my headphones back on, ready to take another call. While a man told me about an issue he was having with his insurance company, I began to hear faint static in the background. It got progressively louder, to the point where the man’s voice became inaudible. Within the sound, I heard a low distorted voice that made me tense up. I knew what was coming.

“Simon says... Insult your customer,” it said.

I could almost distinguish hidden amusement in the voice, like it enjoyed playing with my life. I took a deep breath, knowing I had no choice.

“God, you suck!” I exclaimed.

It was all I could come up with under the pressure. Immediately, all sound cut off and the man’s voice came back.

“What the fuck did you say?!” he screamed.

“Sorry, sir!” I said. “My cat jumped on my keyboard.”

The man sighed, said he would call somewhere else, and hung up. I leaned back on my uncomfortable chair and shut my eyes. I felt embarrassed, but relieved that I would not end up dead today. I wondered who would have found me first? My girlfriend? My dad? My employer? A series of thoughts kept repeating in my head and anxiety quickly set in. Evidently, the entity that voice came from was not confined to the radio anymore. That fact filled me with a cold dread. I wondered where it would end, what it meant, why it changed. Was it evolving? The rest of my shift was uneventful and, though I was on edge during every call that came next, I managed to help every customer to the best of my abilities.

I desperately wanted to understand what was truly happening. I had to know what was causing all of this. I was afraid, constantly unnerved and the endless spiral of anxiety-induced thoughts kept me awake way too late at night. My previous research had been less than helpful, so I knew I had to take a different approach this time. I thought about turning on the news, but decided against it.

Instead, I decided to call the non emergency police line. My expectations were not high, but I was hopeful that they could at least give me some information. I picked up my phone and dialed the number.

“Non-emergency police, this is Isabel speaking,” the woman on the other side of the phone said. “Who am I speaking with?”

“Hi, my name is Jack,” I answered.

“Alright. Jack,” she said. “How can I help you today?”

“Well...” I began but I was already trailing off. “I was wondering if you knew what was going on with the whole ‘Simon says’ radio voice and everything. You know, with what happened at the grocery store...”

Isabel stayed silent for a few seconds before speaking again.

“I’m sorry, sir, I’m not allowed to divulge any information on the matter at the moment,” she said more sternly. “The event is still under investigation and hasn’t been made public yet.”

“Please,” I almost begged. “Please, I just want to know... I’m scared, I just want to understand.”

“I’m sorry, sir,” she repeated. “As I said, the investigation hasn’t been made public yet and...”

“Please!” I was practically screaming into the phone by that point. “I was there! I saw the bodies, the blood, I saw them all dead in front of me! All of them! I just need to know! I need to know, so I can sleep at night. I can barely sleep, I keep having nightmares. I see them in my dreams, in my head, all the time. I keep remembering what they looked like...”

“Alright, alright, Jack. Listen,” she interrupted me, her voice softer now. “All I can say is that we think it was probably caused by a gas leak. It seems like the most likely explanation. I can’t say anything else, telling you more could get me in career-ending trouble. Now, I recommend that you seek professional mental health help. I can give you the number for mental health services in the region if you need.”

“No, that’s okay...” I said, calmer. “Thank you for the offer, though.”

“You’re welcome, sir. Is there anything else I can help you with today?” she asked.

“No, nothing else,” I replied. “Thank you for your time.”

“You’re welcome, stay safe.” she said before hanging up.

I did not buy the gas leak theory at all. I knew that gas leaks could kill people, but there was no way it had the ability to make so many people drop dead at the exact same time. I knew they could cause hallucinations, but everything seemed much too real. I saw the bodies, yes, but I also smelled them. I felt the blood sticking under my shoes. I scrubbed it out of my carpet and spent half an hour trying to get all of it out of the floor of my car. It was there, I knew that. The more I thought about it, the less believable it seemed, but what other explanation was there? What else realistically could have caused that? Mass poisoning? Who would take so much time out of their lives to fill syringes and inject that many people with poison? Plus, their skulls had exploded. Poison did not do that. They would have been throwing up and foaming at the mouth at most, I thought. I was spiraling again.

I decided to run myself a warm bath. As steam filled the room and my skin turned red from the heat of the water, I tried to relax. I closed my eyes, focused on the soft ripples of water against my limbs and tried to breathe in and out slowly.

The next day, my dad called me and invited me to a family dinner. We tried to do those at least twice a month, since my apartment was not too far from the family home. Staying close despite not living together anymore was very important to us. I had always been close to my brothers and both of them were very attached to me. Growing up, they were little menaces. I heard somewhere that twins have a special sort of bond that most people cannot understand or relate to, and that definitely applied to them. It seemed like they shared the same mind, always ready to get in trouble together. They were both eleven years old now and they definitely calmed down over the years, but what linked them had not changed.

I got in my car and arrived half an hour later. I saw Joey noticing my arrival through the window and running towards the front door. It flew open and he jumped out with Sam right behind him. I got out of the car and both of them ran to me and began telling me all about their day and friends they made at school. They were talking over each other so fast that I could barely make out what each of them was saying. Their excitement was contagious.

Joey wore new glasses, but he still looked so alike Sam that, if they were to dress the same, they could easily be mistaken from one another. As little kids, they loved surprising people by switching places and pretending to be the other one. As they grew up, both of them developed their own mannerisms and personalities, so they could not prank the family as easily anymore, but it still worked on strangers.

They began leading me towards the house and I saw both of my parents standing at the door waving at me. Mom had the biggest smile on her face and leaned lovingly against my dad who had his arm around her waist. I walked up the steps and they wrapped me in their arms. It always felt so good to be home.

“I’m so glad you’re home, honey!” my mom began. “I hope the drive went well?”

“I missed you, mom,” I responded. “There was barely anyone on the road.”

She rubbed my back, like she had done ever since I was a child.

“Ready to eat, bud?” my dad asked. “The food’s almost ready.”

“You know I’m always hungry for mom’s food.” I replied with a chuckle.

My mom’s food was the best. Every meal she cooked was perfect and absolutely delicious. Sam and Joey dragged me to the living room, where they showed me a new video game dad had bought for them. They handed me a controller and begged me to play with them. I was never much into video games, so I was pretty bad at it, but it made them laugh and I smiled. All three of us sat on pillows on the ground, my brothers playfully pushing each other with their shoulders trying to make the other lose. I lost the next game, and the one after that too, then mom called us to the kitchen for dinner.

We all sat down around the antique wooden table and mom brought us plates of meat and potatoes covered with brown sauce. It was a comforting meal I had the pleasure to eat all through my childhood. Dad brought forks and apple juice to the table for my brothers, then asked mom and I if we would like some coffee, which I accepted gratefully. What I liked the most about eating with my family was that the table never got silent. With five people sitting together, there was always a conversation going. Between two bites, Sam brought up the park they went to the day before.

“The squirrels were huge!” he said.

“It was a dog park!” Joey added. “I saw so many! There was this little tiny one and a huge German shepherd!”

“Mom?” Sam asked. “Can we have a dog?”

Mom and dad looked at each other, silently trying to guess what the other thought. My brothers never had a dog growing up. I have vague memories of my parents and I having a fluffy white dog when I was very young, but I was their only child back then.

“Do you think we’d have enough space in the house for a dog?” mom asked my dad.

“I’m not sure, Sylvia.” dad answered. “I think we could give it a try.”

My brothers screamed in unison and began cheering and clapping their hands.

“We’ll have a dog! We’ll have a dog!” they screamed together.

“But!” dad interrupted. “You’ll have to take care of it. I’ll show you how. Dogs aren’t toys, they’re living animals and they can be a lot of work.”

My brothers calmed down a little bit and tried to contain their voices, but I could see the excited glances they threw at each other.

“The house is gonna blow up into a storm,” mom chuckled.

I smiled and kept eating. My mom absolutely adored animals and I knew she had to be as excited as my brothers at the idea of having a dog. I could see sparkles in her eyes when she looked up at me.

“The food’s delicious, mom,” I told her.

“Thank you, honey.” she replied. “Oh! I took a video of a funny white dog I saw at the park. Do you want to see it?”

Of course, I accepted. She put down her fork and pulled out her phone. I leaned in towards the screen and she pressed play. The dog had tiny little ears and the rest of its fur made it look like a ball of snow. It was running around a tree, trying to catch a squirrel that was way too fast for it, then gave up when the squirrel climbed up the tree, innocently sitting on the glass and looking up into the leaves.

“It’s a Samoyed, just like we had when you were a kid,” she explained. “Do you remember?”

“Vaguely,” I replied. “I can remember glimpses, but that’s about it.”

The video continued and showed the dog playing with a small Pomeranian. It was careful not to step on the tiny dog. I always loved how smaller dogs were so unaware of their size, ready to face danger and fight anything. My mom joked that they compensated what they lacked in height with their attitude.

The video randomly cut to black and muted itself. My mom frowned, confused, and tapped on the screen a few times, but nothing happened. As she reached forward to pick her phone up, probably about to give it a shake to “try to fix it”, a new sound starting coming from it. The voice. That voice. The one I could now recognize immediately. The one I knew I had to obey. The one I knew *they* had to obey at all costs.

“Simon says...” it began.

All eyes were on the phone, wondering what was happening. I knew what would happen. My face did not reflect confusion like theirs did. It reflected anticipation, worry and fear. I glanced at my dad who, clearly, had not warned my family like I told him to. His eyes were wide open and his mouth was slack jawed as if to say: “You really weren’t kidding...”

“Make a mess!” the voice finished.

I did not even hesitate, did not even consider what my parents would think. I grabbed my plate with both hands and flipped it, sending it flying towards the middle of the table. Potatoes and sauce spilled everywhere and the plate shattered. My parents stared in shock, but my brothers broke the silence.

“Food fight!” Sam screamed.

He grabbed handfuls of mashed potatoes and launched them at Joey’s face, who retaliated, grabbing meat and sending it all over Sam’s clothes. Both of them kept going, frantically throwing food on each other, on the table, against the walls and onto the floor. My dad abruptly turned towards them, opening his mouth to yell, but his elbow caught the handle of his coffee mug and made it fall off the table, shattering as it hit the floor. Mom stood up and walked towards the mess on the floor. She was rarely the one who disciplined my brothers, she was a gentle, caring mother and wife.

“Don’t move, George. I’ll clean it up,” she said. “Be careful, boys. There’s glass everywhere.”

She never reached the broken cup, though. As she was about to take another step forward, she dropped to the floor. For the first time, I got to see what happened when someone did not obey the entity’s orders. I regret it to this day. I saw her eyes pop out of their sockets. I saw fragments of bones be ejected out of her head as the flesh wrapping her skull tore into shreds, loose flaps of skin hanging down with her hair still attached to it. It was instantaneous. Within a second, she was on the floor in a pool of her own blood. It kept flowing, spreading on the kitchen tile, leaking on the grout separating them like a macabre river. Her body did not convulse or twitch like I though it would. It was still as a rock, still as death. She was face down with her twisted limbs by her side.

“Mom!” Joey screamed as he turned towards the floor. “Mom, are you okay?!”

Sam’s mouth opened, but no sound came out. I was pretty sure that he had not seen what I saw. Tears formed in his eyes and rapidly began to fall on his shirt as he kept opening and closing his mouth, trying to find words. My dad stood from his chair so fast that he sent it falling backwards.

“Get your brothers out of the kitchen!” he ordered. “I’ll call an ambulance.”

I did as he said. I stood up, vision blurred by the tears. I did not speak, not able to say anything. I walked up to my brothers and put a hand on each of their shoulders. They stood up, Sam with stiff limbs and shaking knees, but Joey kept screaming. He protested, tried to fight me to stay in the kitchen, but ultimately let himself be brought to his room. I gently pushed both of them in Joey’s room and shut the door.

“Just... Just wait here,” I said. “Dad and I will take care of mom, okay?”

I walked back to the kitchen, bracing myself to see her body a second time. I could hear Sam sobbing, while Joey wailed and screamed questions I had no answer for. Dad had propped mom up so she looked like she was sitting. Her back was on dad’s lap, with her head on his chest. He stared into what remained of her face and ran his hands through her sticky, bloody hair. Chunks of it were coming out and getting stuck to his fingers.

“Sylvia... Sylvia, please,” he begged. “No... Please.”

I could not do anything. I was unsure of what to say and I knew that, no matter what I said, it would not make the situation better. Nothing I could have said or done would have helped. I walked up to my dad and kneeled beside him, silent. He looked at me with wide, tear-filled eyes, begging for an explanation, to understand, begging for a reason. Shaking my head slowly was the only answer I managed to give him. I just cried silently and avoided looking at mom’s face.

“You were right...” he just said in disbelief. “You were... What you said, it was true...”

I did not respond, I did not know what to say.

“But how...” he kept going. “How?”

“I don’t know... I have no idea,” I simply replied.

I had no better explanation, and I felt guilty for it, like I was letting him down. I did not know why it had to be this way, if god was punishing us, if hell was descending on earth or if this was all a weird fucking mind virus. I did not know, but I knew that mom was dead and that my brothers would need to grow up without a mother, raised by a dad who lost half of his heart right in front of his eyes.

The ambulance came and took mom away from us. Dad got in with her and left me at home to care for my brothers. I tried in vain to comfort them for hours. Sam cried himself to sleep, but Joey screamed until his voice gave out and his throat became raw, then he just stared endlessly at the ceiling. I sat in the living room and watched my cup of coffee become cold while I waited for dad to return. One hour turned to two, then three, then four. I stared at the black TV screen, unable and unwilling to turn it on.

Dad came back home at some point. It was the middle of the night and he looked terrible to say the least. He said that, to keep it short, there would be no police investigation. Foul play was ruled out pretty much instantly. The wound in her head had clearly been caused from the inside and there was no way any of us could have caused it. The coroner consulted the doctors, but in the end, none of them really knew for sure what had caused it. So we were left in the dark while they kept mom’s body. They told my dad that they would keep working until they found an explanation, but I doubted they would find one.

I spent the two weeks following the event being a useless mess in my apartment. I did not talk to anybody, did not go out, did not play games nor watch movies, nothing. I was barely conscious, barely alive. I called my girlfriend once to tell her that my mother died, she was rightfully heartbroken. She offered to join me at my apartment to keep me company, but I politely refused.

Mom’s funeral came and I wore a black suit I bought for the occasion. Dad and my brothers did the same. We had not seen each other since the day mom died, but no heartwarming smiles were exchanged that day. No laughs, no jokes and no banter from my brothers either. We hugged each other when we got there, but it was different, too different. It felt forced, like we knew we would burst into tears if we really leaned into it. My brothers were already tearing up before we even entered the building and I saw that dad was trying to stay strong for them. I could see his eyelids twitching, as if he was trying to contain tears. I had never seen my dad cry before that day. He was a strong, loving husband. He was a pillar you could always lean onto when you needed help. He had the advice, the stability and the strength of a king. Even during the hardest period of his life, he still tried to represent that role, but I knew. I knew that, under the cover, behind the mask, he was struggling.

He put his hand behind my back as we entered the funeral home, and I did the same for him. I did not want dad to feel like he was alone. His other hand went on Joey’s shoulder and mine went on Sam’s. We walked down the aisle between family members and old friends of my mom. I pretended to ignore the whispers, forced myself not to listen to them. I did not want to know what they had to say, their theories, the rumors, the lies. We sat down together in the four empty chairs waiting for us in the front row.

A middle-aged woman I had never seen before walked on the little podium and began the ceremony. She wore a long-sleeved dress and spoke in a solemn voice.

“We unite here today,” she began. “To not only mourn the loss of a mother, wife and friend, but to celebrate her life, her achievements and the beauty of her soul.”

She kept speaking, but I had trouble listening. It felt like I was stuck in a terrible dream. Once she was done speaking, my brothers and I stood up and each stood on a different side of the casket. We held our respective candle while the woman lit them and, once a soft music began playing, we slowly marched up to the casket. We held the candles in front of our chests and closed our eyes. I could not bear facing the teary eyes of the audience, but I briefly met my dad’s eyes. It was a mistake. My knees began to shake and I shut my eyes tightly in a silent prayer. I heard my brothers sniffling, trying to hold in their cries. After we opened our eyes, I risked a glance at mom. She was covered by a white sheet, so I could not see her. I wondered what I would see under it, what she would look like. We sat down the candles and made our way back to our chairs, where dad was quietly sobbing.

A pastor came in next and led a prayer. Our family had never been very religious, but we believed in God. At least, at first I did. Now, after what I had seen, I was not so sure anymore. I felt like I was betraying our beliefs, but I also felt like our beliefs were betraying us themselves. The prayer was beautiful. The pastor was confident, compassionate and polite. He carried his voice through the whole room perfectly and seemed to enchant everyone with his words. “Mom will be okay,” I thought. “The angels will take care of her and so will grandma and grandpa.”

Then came the hardest part. The last person who was going to speak to us was going to be my dad. He pulled out a folded paper from his pocket, steadied himself and stood up. Like an unshakeable statue, he walked on the stage, brave as he always had been. He positioned himself behind the podium, sat his paper down onto it, and leaned towards the microphone. I heard him inhale shakily, then he began reading.

“Thank you for allowing me to speak today. I want to thank our friends and family for coming, I know that Sylvia would have appreciated it greatly. I also know that she would be heartbroken to see the sadness you all have to bear today.” he started.

He paused for a second, then kept going.

“Sylvia was, is, and will forever be the love of my life. Together, we lived a life I could not have asked more from. Together, we raised the most beautiful, brave children I have ever seen. Together, we braved storms, problems and fears. But you know who never gave up? Sylvia. No matter how things were, no matter how scared I knew she was, Sylvia was the voice of hope. Sylvia was the one who always kept believing. She was the light of our lives, no matter what she faced. That’s how great of a woman she was,” he continued.

Everyone was crying by that point. Most people were doing so silently, but some were openly sobbing. My brothers leaned closer to me and I squeezed each of their shoulders. I was not trying to contain the tears anymore, I let them fall freely.

“I know that Sylvia would be satisfied with the life she led, as much as I am. I am saddened to know that she will never... get to see our little boys become men. She will never get to see our brave young man, Jack, grow old. At least, not from earth. But I believe that, from Heaven, she will watch over us all, cheering us on to keep going, to stay strong,” he said.

I struggled to breathe, like the air was getting stuck in my trachea. I would not be able to be brave for much longer. My brothers’ tears soaked into my suit, but I did not care. “Cry as much as you need,” I thought. “I’m here for you. Your brother’s here for you.” I held them tighter.

“If there is one thing I know Sylvia would say, it would be this. She would say: ‘Stay strong for me. Live a life you know I would be proud of. Stay strong for me, because I will always keep you safe from heaven.’ Sylvia was and will always be the greatest woman I got the chance to share my life with and I am grateful for every single second we spent together.”

My dad wiped the tears from his face and folded the wet paper, before putting it back into his pocket. We clapped quietly and offered weak smiles for his strength and his words. Clapping any louder would have felt disrespectful.

Before the ceremony ended, the woman from earlier walked up to the casket and removed the sheet from mom and folded it onto her lap. Dad, my brothers and I were invited to walk up to her and say our last words. We approached the casket cautiously, like we desperately wanted to see her but were also terrified of what we would see.

Her body wore her favourite light blue dress. It was strange, seeing her so pale and still. I always heard that dead people in caskets looked like they were sleeping, but I disagreed. She looked too still. The sight in front of me made me all too aware that her body was now nothing but an empty vessel of flesh. It was distressing. I shifted my gaze from her dress to her face, apprehensively. Her face looked wrong too. Her features were all slightly different, just enough to give me an unpleasant feeling. I could see bits of the device holding her jaw closed and the ends of the stitches sewing her eyelids shut. My guess is that, since her eyes had popped out of their sockets, there was no way to make them look right without stitching her eyelids close. They had shaved her hair, though we could not see the top of her head. They had covered it with some sort of scarf that matched her dress, but a small part of her scalp was visible above her forehead. Her skull must have been so disfigured that there was no way they could leave her head uncovered, but I knew. I knew what it looked like, and I could not stop picturing it in my mind.

My brothers mumbled their last words while my dad kept his hand on my mother’s cold arm, sniffling. The only other sound audible was a prayer played on a speaker just quietly enough that those near the casket could hear.

“Out father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name,” it began, but it got interrupted. “Simon says... Laugh.”

We knew we had to. We knew what would happen if we did not do it. For a split second, my heavy heart thought that maybe, just maybe, I should ignore it. Maybe I should stay still and wait for it to bring me back to mom. I shook the idea out of my head. I needed to be there for my brothers. I needed to be there for dad. I needed to live. Dad is the one who started. He let out a hesitant, quiet chuckle. I followed and nudged my brother with my elbows, a silent way to tell them to obey. We hoped that the audience could not hear and that, if they did, they would believe it to be nervous laughter. I hoped it would be enough to satisfy the entity. I hoped it would count. I did not know if it would, and I was scared. I think my dad had the same thought, because then he said:

“God... Imagine if she saw how pitiful we look right now.”

Loud enough for the audience to hear. So we laughed. We really laughed. It was not even forced, because we knew he was right. I knew that mom would want us to be strong and keep living. She would not want us to cry, but she would understand. The prayer resumed on the speaker, and we let out shaky sighs.

We held each other’s hands and, together, we said: “I love you, mom.” Then, we turned and left the funeral home, leaving the other guests behind. My dad asked if I wanted to come spend some time at his house until I felt better, but I declined his offer. I doubted I would be able to stand the sight of the kitchen, or the house in general. I did not want to remember how I had to mop up the blood and pick up the fragments of bones. I drove home and cried until I had no tears left. That night, I dreamed of my favourite memories of mom. It was the best dream I ever had.
