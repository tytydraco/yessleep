[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hpuxsn/something_in_the_woods_was_calling_my_name_part_1/)



The rest of the day was uneventful. Pappy set up some cans and bottle in the backyard for some makeshift target practice. I was half tempted to blow him away but honestly, I would have missed. It had been years since I had held a gun. Pappy and my mom took me and Richard once or twice when we were really little. She would make us wear earmuffs and stand about ten feet away while she and Pappy searched a clearing for a decent shot. When she wasn't looking, Pappy snuck us a sip of his lukewarm beer and taught us how to hold a riffle. I remember it weighing about seven tons and I could barely get my stance together. Pappy didn't get mad at me for that though, he just smiled and slapped me on the back, saying I would get there someday. 

Today it was still heavy, But I shifted and postured my shoulders just right as I aimed down the barrel at the bottle of rolling rock about eight yards away from me. Pappy was to the side of me, no ear protection whatsoever. I held my breath as I steadied my aim and fired. I dropped the gun, the kick almost knocking me over. The bullet whizzed through the air and chipped the top of the bottle. It wobbled slightly but it remained intact. My face flushed red, and I waited for Pappy to berate me. Instead, he calmly picked up the riffle and offered a crocked grin. He shoved the gun back into my hands and slapped me on the back and simply stated: "You'll get there."

It took a few hours, but it was like riding a bike. All those childhood tips on how to wield a gun came flooding back and soon I kept hitting mark after mark. The grass was littered with broken glass and pappy beamed with pride. He said my reload time needed work, but I could stay on target like a sumbitch. His words. I tried to subside my anger and bond with the old man, part of me really did want that. But then I kept thinking of Richard. The way his face barely held together as he lay in that coffin. The mortician had clearly done the best he could, but those staples barely held together. The story I had been told was "boating accident." Frankly it did not sit right with me then either. Pappy had tried to stop him; I did believe that. But it was him who filled his head with stories, it was him who taught Rich to hunt to begin with. Like he was teaching me now. So, I shoved the riffle back to him and went towards the house and grumbled something about dinner. 

We ordered take out that night, it took about an hour and a half to get there and was freezing cold by the time it got there. But pizza is pizza so me and Pappy sat there and ate our slices as best we could. It was like chewing through cardboard at times but frankly it wasn't bad. Pappy mentioned that tomorrow we will be passing a stream, it is a short little stroll into the forest. He said once we passed it, we would officially be in winndy territory. I nodded my head and went back to eating. Looking back, I was being childish and should have just spoken to him like a man. I regret that, and at the time I almost swallowed my pride and spoke up when I heard a loud thump coming from the roof. It sounded like something had not so gracefully climbed up there. A warble sound rang out following it. Now me and Pappy were both staring at the ceiling, waiting for further disruption. My brother's voice called out from the yard. Pappy reached under the table, a sawed-off materializing from under it. The voice called out again.

"Ty-ler. Give him to us. We ju-st w-ant him." My brother crooned. A dark shape took form in the middle of the yard, I could barely see it through the sliding glass. It's antlers massive; it was hunched over on all fours. I could make out two glairing red lights I assumed were its eyes. They bore into me like a drill. The Winndy spoke again, repeating its demand. I stood up from the table, fire rising in my chest.

"Don't." Pappy commanded with a whisper. I looked to him and he pointed the gun upwards. My eyes flicked to the ceiling, and I heard scuttling from above. Pappy studied the unseen thing's movements and aimed his sawed off true. When the scuttling stopped, he blasted at the ceiling. I winced at the sound and heard a creature cry out in pain. It quickly scurried off the roof and I saw a massive beast crash into the ground and leap away into the darkness. The hunched over winndy made a low growling sound and it looked like it was about to pounce right into the house. My heart skipped a thousand beats a minute as Papp pointed his gun at the glass.

"The pa-ck hungers." The Winndy called out ominously, as it suddenly retreated into the darkness. Those burning crimson eyes the last bit of the thing to sink into the night. Pappy was unbothered by all this and quietly sank back into the dining room seat and dug back into his meal. I silently joined him, a million questions rushing through my brain. Pappy must have been a mind reader because he spoke up, without looking away from his frozen slop.

"These things don't usually hunt in packs. Solitary critters mostly. It's me they want boy. I sinned against them one too many times and they want to reap my soul before father time can." he calmly explained.

 "They won't go away even if we kill the one with Richard's voice will they." I squeaked. 

"Probably not. Might back off a tick but they'll keep coming. They'll find a way in." He retorted. 

And that was the end of all dinner conversation. I couldn't sleep that night, just kept glancing to the woods, my rifle at my side. The house stank of rancid of filth, and I realized I had not heard any animals for over two days. The thought to just abandon my grandfather in the morning did occur to me. But despite it all, i couldn't do that to him. I owed Richard that much.       

I stood at the edge of the yard, right when the wild woods creped onto our land. Tall lumbering giants stood in front of me. Trees older than the country itself. Pappy was in the house behind me, getting our tools ready. The sky was a lazy orange, the night creeping over us. Pappy said the cover of darkness was actually our ally. The winndys, as I myself have begun to call them, couldn't see all that good. Or so Pappy claimed. He had already sprayed me with what he called "musk" a putrid substance if I had ever smelt one. If I had to guess, it was wolf piss mixed with about seventy other types of animal urine. I could hear his labored breath behind me, and the tap of his cane on the ground. It was odd, this past week he had still seemed so strong. Now though, on the eve of our first hunt, he seemed so frail, so nervous, so old. I turned and saw he had trimmed his mile long white beard into a clean jawline. I noticed his attire and spoke up.

"Pappy why the vest." I motioned to the bright attire he had on. 

"Only thing more dangerous than a winndy is a drunken hunter at night, boy." He loudly exclaimed. I simply nodded my head and turned once more to face the wild. Was I ready for this?  To face the creature, I saw that night. The thing that spoke with Tommy's voice. I felt a sturdy hand grasp my shoulder.

 "I appreciate you coming out here with me boy. I know you still harbor ill towards me, but. . .well Richie would have liked you doing this." I remained silent at his praise, a rare occurrence with Pappy. He hobbled past me and effortlessly strolled into the woods. I blinked and suddenly he had been swallowed whole by it. A voice ran out, "COME ON THEN BOY" it called out to me. I hesitated for only a moment. What if it was one of them, the winndys? I brushed that off quick, however. I took a big breath, like I was about to dive into a fifty-meter pool and stepped into the woods. 

It was hard to see, though I suppose that is obvious. I Was surprised at how much ground we covered, however. After what seemed like five minutes, we were already way past the small stream Pappy had shown me yesterday. In my hands I held a rifle, it felt heavy in my hands. I remember going hunting with Pappy and mom only once as a kid. I didn't hold a gun of course; I was only seven at the time. But I remember that sound it made, that hideous boom, like the earth split open and the reaper itself had come from below to claim the soul of that nice buck mom had shot. I remember its eyes. They were glassy, a nice hazel color asking me why it had to die. This was personal, this hunt for the creature. It has to be killed. Yet in the back of my mind, I could see that deer on the ground.

I was lost in thought and almost took out Pappy in my tracks. He had come to a dead stop. I was about to ask what when he held up a hand. The air was silent. Dead silent. I could feel my blood freeze. After a moment, it began. There was a low howl, mournful I would say. It became louder, almost like a dying shriek, like an elk being garroted alive. As suddenly as it began, it stopped. The silence was followed by a couple of low clicking sounds. Almost like the predator.  That had been Richie's favorite movie.  Could the winndys mimic their victims' thoughts as well as their voice. No, no that's dumb, that was just nerves talking. I needed to tamper down my emotions, be a lion like Pappy. I couldn't believe how calm he was now, how determined he was. Was he just a sociopath or am I just a coward.

I had no time to ponder these thoughts of course, as that elk like shriek returned. I could feel that cry run up and down my spine like an Olympic triathlete. It was all I could do not to piss myself in absolute terror, God what a coward I was. Yet there was Pappy, cool as ice. He lifted his riffle and scanned the trees for movement. All I could see was darkened bush and pointy shrubs.  God why had I come out there I was going to get us all killed. Torn apart and mimickly mocked for eternity. Suddenly pappy Stopped, frozen in motion. I turned my head and saw. . . Trees, just trees, oaks pines whatever the hell they were I was no botanist. I was an accountant.  Damn Pappy, I should never have come here. I should have let the old bastard rot, I should have-

BLAM.

I snapped awake from my treacherous thoughts and saw Pappy's smoking gun. My eyes darted back to the tree line, and my heart sank. Edging out from behind a tree were at least three-meter-long antlers, curved in heinous directions. I could see the creatures' eyes staring at us, red and beady, almost bioluminescent. There was a low hum, almost like a buzzing sound. Was it growling at us? My eyes adjusted to the darkness once more, and I saw the tree it was standing in front of more clearly.

Pappy had Missed. 

For a split second I waited for Pappy to try and get another shot off, but he just stood there. In a panic I raised mine to fire at the Winndy. The creature leered at me through the tree line, I swear its mouth was watering. The gun went off in my hand, the recoil almost sending me flying. A horrendous mist appeared in the creature's shoulder, as it let out a hurt warble. Had I hit it?  I felt a loud slap on my back, straightening my coward's spine. 

"Thatta boy, hit em again." Pappy crooned. I aimed and fired again, better prepared for the recoil this time. The shot hit it square in the chest and the winndy snapped back and stood there, bent over frozen like some sort of bizarre cartoon. It quickly snapped back upright and looked me dead in the eyes as it began to convulse. It dropped down on all fours, looking like a four-legged spider with how long and frail looking its limbs were. In an instant it darted behind the trees, disappeared into the cover of darkness. I started to shart in my pants until Pappy spoke up.  

"Wait patiently boy, let me hear it speak." He calmly reloaded his gun, and I noticed it seemed to be some sort of single shot rifle. 

"Pappy, you missed why, how-"

 "Best way to learn to swim is be thrown into the deep end, face first." Pappy replied. 

"Best way to, are you fucking insane?" I silently screamed at him. Pappy turned to me, a sly grin on his face. He winked at me and spoke

"Like a fox." At that suddenly everything was a blur, as something tackled me from the bushes. I slammed into the ground, practically shattering my shoulder. A rancid smell violated me as I was pinned down by the winndy. It drooled on me, gooey spittle dribbling towards my gaping mouth. I probably should have closed it in hindsight. The deer like skull face of it bored into me, like it was studying me. Its mouth crept open, and it spoke in that familiar tone. 

"Bro-ther. . . H-elp Me. You -Sh0t Me. Wh-yy" The animal croaked at me. I could feel my face flush white with terror. 

"R-Richie" I began. I failed to get another word out before black blood splattered across my face. There was a rather large gunshot in the winndy's head. After a second it slumped over next to me, what's left of its eyes staring at me. They were asking me why. I hadn't even heard the gun go off. Nor did I see Pappy offering his hand to help me up until he berated me.

 "Git up boy, come on now don't be going pansy on me now" He commanded. I took his hand, my heart desperately trying to escape my chest. Jokes on my heart, I was pretty sure I had about 12 broken ribs keeping it in place. I stumbled up, eyes glancing to the deceased creature next to me. It seemed. . . Smaller than it did before. It was not twitching, it was shriveled and defeated. I had to guess. It was probably about 4 meters tall all together. The winndy's fur was patchy, like it had supermange. It somehow smelled better dead, not by much but still. 

"Good shot." I mumbled under my breath. Pappy chortled at this.

"Ah you softened him up Big Boy." He patted me on the back. A part of me was relived. My brother's death avenged; Pappy seemed proud of me. So why did I still feel so uneasy. Pappy hobbled past me and kneeled besides the corpse. I couldn't help but notice there was still an absence of any sort of sound. I saw Pappy pull out a bowie knife from his back pocket and began to Wittle away at the creatures' horns. I could make out faint glyphs on the knife, archaic symbols that spoke nonsense to me. It was like watching him carve wood. Strike that, it was like watching Michaelangelo sculpt David. It was masterful watching Pappy work that knife, it just slid and chipped in all the right spots. It was the cleanest skinning I had ever watched. It was the ONLY skinning I had ever watched, come to think of it.  

As I watched him work, I heard a familiar clicking sound. Then another. Before I knew it there were about a dozen sounds like the winndy we had just killed. They had surrounded us. Pappy was whistling as he worked now, I recognized the tune, I swear to God it was that dwarf song from Snow White. He must have sensed how horrified I felt, because he spoke up in a soft voice. 

"Keep your eyes on the trees. Don't show fear, stare right back at em." Pappy instructed. I could see shadows with eyes begin to peak around the corners. They clicked and chittered, an orchestra of mimicry. Some of them cried out for help, in a mocking tone. Their eyes were an array of darken colours shinning in the dark. Violet, crimson, even emerald green shined through, yet there was no life in them. Only a ravenous hunger. Pappy picked up the pace of cutting through the dead winndy's spine, the cleanest cut I had ever seen. He dug deep and tore it from the base of the body, a sickening crunch followed.

He stood up on both feet and held the creature's boney head in one hand, and a wad of its leathery skin in the other. I noticed the skin had a sort of covering on it, like an elk pelt stitched together. Some of the other winndys seemed to be wearing pelts of some kind, to blend in better I would assume. I saw two wolf pelt ones and another deer, yet they all had those twisted antlers giving away their deception. The creature's shrunk back at the sight of their fallen comrade. Pappy called out to them.

"Leave my land, you damned heathens. Let it end here, let me die in peace." He pleaded with them. The winndy's chittered and mimicked their victims, like they were discussing the matter amongst themselves. For a moment, it seemed like they would do just that. I could see those misshapen antlers start to head back into the dark. That was when a voice ran out. A woman's voice, slow and confident. It spoke with a stern tone, and it froze my heart to the core when I heard it, despite how many years it had been. 

"Your land is our land." My mother called out. "We do not forgive, and we do not forget." She growled in a sultry voice. I could feel the venom radiating from that voice, and in a panic and I looked around for its source. I glanced up and saw a hulking winndy curled up in the branches above. It had such majestic antlers, and yellow eyes that shone like spotlights. I could just barely make out its face, it seemed to have a skull like a possum, and its body was covered in fur, wearing it almost like a cloak. I was taken back by this human like behavior, and noticed the creature even had a thin tale curled up around the branch. Pappy stood frozen against the alpha winndy. He locked eyes with it, and for the first time all week I saw a twinge of fear in his eyes.

"Sandy. . ." He muttered my mother's name under his breath. The creature atop the trees purred and slowly started to descend, a mocking tone in its voice.

"She lives within me. Don't you want to see her again." The creature extended a mangled claw towards pappy, beckoning to come closer. Then Pappy did something I didn't expect. He turned tail and ran away. Finding myself alone with these things I decided to follow my elder's lead. As I brushed past the trees and stumbled on loose ferns, I could hear the braying and cackling of a dozen winndys pursuing us. Their vicious mockery stung me to the core as I could barely make out Pappy in front of me. Truth be told I am amazed he even ran as fast as he did. I was barely keeping up with the old fart, my lungs clawing at my out of shape chest. Each breath I heaved was like a knife in my back. But it was worth it not to get torn apart by the winndys. I could see the House; we were almost clear of the tree line when Pappy turned around. His eyes were raised, and he pulled up his riffle. I ducked as Pappy fired.

Something wet hit my face as A beast cried out, the shriek of its death throes piercing my ears. I almost tripped as I skipped forward, avoiding the fallen winndy. Pappy stood his ground at the foor of the treeline. He hurried me past him and shot off three more rounds, a wail accompying the third. As I reached the sliding glass door I turned to see Pappy hobble towards me. Behind him were at least a dozen Winndys, the largest was the Possum faced alpha. It stood tall out in the open, at least five meters high. I hurried Pappy inside and shut the weak glass behind me as the alpha roared in defiance. It shook the house; I could feel the ground vibrating beneath my feet.

Pappy had overturned the dining room table and crawled behind it; I could hear his rapid-fire breathing. I shot across the room to join him. I saw him clutching his gun like a baby would a rattle. I slide next to him, and he flinched at my presence. My mother, or so I was told, had died in a skiing accident. The alpha had ma's voice, and I knew what that meant. But I needed to hear it from him. 

"How did it happen." I asked plainly. It took a moment for Pappy to calm himself. He couldn't look me in the eyes he explained.

 "The ski trip. It came in the night and took her. Your father blamed me of course, said it was meant to be me. Maybe he was right. Christ it is all my fault boy. I failed her, I failed you I failed your brother. Christ Tyler." Tears were streaming down my once proud pappy's face. "It's all my fault boy I'm so sorry. See if you can sneak out the front, get to your truck boy it's me they want." He begged me. I could hear scrapping at the windows and rustling on the roof. The creatures groaned and skittered around the property testing ways to get in.

I'm ashamed to admit I did think of leaving Pappy there. But I just couldn't do it. Despite his misadventures he had only wanted what was best for us all. I put an arm on his ancient shoulder and grinned. 

"We're in this together now old man. Now come on, we might need more firepower." I suggested to him. It was a crapshoot, but I figured my grandpa must have had something up his sleeves. I could see a spark of something behind his eyes and he nodded his head. He sprung up and led me down to the basement. The howls of the damned creatures seemed to echo louder down there. Pappy hurried over to a locked shelf and butted the lock off with his riffle. He struck it twice and I heard it clang to his feet. He swung open the shelf and revealed a rack of pump action shotguns. The lowest shelf held boxes of ammo, the doors held a set of three silver axes and a set of silver swords. Pappy grabbed one of the guns and a box of ammo, turning to me.

"Dragons breathe." He uttered simply. I nodded and took my own. As we loaded the weapons, we heard a series of crashing and banging on the walls upstairs. Pappy eyed me carefully. "Now be careful with these now, it packs a hell of a Kick. Don't worry about what you're hitting just stand firm and hold it tight." I nodded in agreement.  The banging slowed down and all we heard was the sound of loud skittering across the floor, and low giggles. The smell of them clung to the air, rotten sulfer stung my nostrils. I just held my head high, and my gun higher. Pappy crept towards the stairs and peeked around the corner. Immediately he swung forward and blasted up the stairs, the smell of burning flesh flaring up. I could see chunks of skull and blood fly past Pappy as he stood his ground.

I Went behind him and saw another winndy trying to claw its way past its dead friend. I raised my shotgun and fired, taken back a little but my aim holding true. The winndy's wolf like skull was vaporized in an instant and it collapsed to the floor. Howls and cries filled the house as we heard a mountain of terror heading towards us. Me and Pappy stood side by side, pockets full of napalm as we slowly made ground up the stairs. Three more creatures tried and failed to make their way down them. We used their bodies as steppingstones as we made our way up. Climbing over a rabbit skulled one, Pappy almost got his head taken off by one that was hiding behind the corner. He ducked and I blasted it in the arm which went flying in the air as the wounded Winndy scurried after it. We reached the dining room and surveyed the damage.

Glass and what was left of the sliding door lay around the hardwood floor. The lights near the kitchen sink flickered as a massive hole in the by window jutted inward. Near the living room I could make out a hole in the plaster, I could see something lurking in there, could hear it as well. We raised our guns and instinctively went back-to-back, slowly looking around the room. I saw antlers rise above the overturned table and fired. I hit the thing in its back, causing it to wail in pain. I pumped once more and fired a hole clear through its chest as it rose to face me. It flew back hitting the wall with a wet crunch.

This went on as we made our way through the downstairs. As one of us reloaded we covered the other. They came at us like rabid wolves, and we put them down as such. It was like something out of an action movie. Body after horrid body dropped, The winndy's numbers thinning. The floor was soon covered in black blood, as their bodies lay twitching in a smoke-filled haze. Some were still burning, the fire dancing around their fallen bodies lie it was Mardie gras. One has taken a decent swipe at me, blood tearing at my shirt. Another had leapt at Pappy and taken a small bite out of his shoulder. He had barely even grunted in pain as he jabbed the thing with his shoulder and shoved the barrel of his shotgun down the winndy's throat. I could hear the thing gurgle out a cry as Pappy pulled the trigger and disintegrated the monster's insides.

As the smoke began to clear, me and Pappy held our breaths, our guns shaking in our hands. There was silence now, but the smell still lingered. I heard a creek above us and before I could glance up the ceiling collapsed, the alpha winndy crashing down on top of us. I got the brunt of it, the thing's canine like feet digging into my back. Pappy collapsed onto the ground and looked back as the alpha swatted his shotgun away with its tale. 

"Naughty boys." It mused in mom's voice. "All you had to do was give up." It barked. It picked up Pappy, bringing it close to its hunched over figure. It could barely fit in the kitchen it was so big. I could taste its rotted fur in my mouth as I struggled to get out from under it. 

"You-you aren't her." Pappy cried out in protest. The alpha chuckled. 

"I looked for you for so long. I found her there in the lodge that night, fast asleep. Her death was quick. Yours will not." The creature flung pappy down the basement steps; I heard him cry out as he hit everyone. He landed with a thud and the bottom, and I could see him start to crawl away further down. The alpha raised its foot and bore it down on me, slamming my spine. A shock rang out through my body almost causing me to pass out. "Stay put little one. Mommy has some work to do." It sang out. It slowly crept down the stairs as it abandoned me. I struggled to get up, my gun nowhere to be found. I could hear Pappy cursing at the thing as it made its way down, its bulky body crushing the walls as it forced its way down the steps. I pounded the ground with my fist, determined to get up. Pain shot throughout my body as I forced myself up, my lower back radiating with anger.

As I got on my knees, my eyes darted towards the door, and I saw the alpha slump off them into the den. With all my energy I got up in a rush and hurried down the steps, barely keeping myself up. Halfway down I could see the thing diggings its claws into Pappy's chest. Its head was over his, it was opening his mouth in a rancid hiss. Pappy spit at the thing and told it to kill him already. It was so focused on him it didn't see me. My eyes went to the shelf, its doors swinging open. I didn't think, I just ran up and grabbed an axe.

 The Alpha leered over Pappy; its eyes locked into his. It made a sort of hissing sound as it opened its jaw, like it was sucking the very soul from his body. Pappy could barely struggle under the weight of the beast, and I could hear his grunting and protest start to wither and fade. Axe in hand, I grippe the wooden handle with all my might and raised it above the monster's head.

Its eye darted to the side as it finally noticed me, still sucking the life out of Pappy. I brought down the axe with a strong thrust and drove the silver deep into the winndy's neck. It screeched, my ears ringing out as they deafened. I struggled to tear the axe from nasty wound I had inflicted, and tore it out with a grunt, blood splattering on my face. It felt warm and moist.

The frenzied creature turned to me and I brought the axe down once more, splitting its skill plate right down the middle. It collapsed onto the ground like a heap of dirty laundry, struggling to get up. Dark fluid leaked onto the shag carpet, staining it with sin and fury. Once more I cleaved the axe into the skull of the thing, a sickening crunch rang out. Shrapnel of splintered bone and brain matter flew into the air. It held up a shaky arm to stop to try and save itself. It lifted what remained of its caved in skull and tried to speak.

"Please Tyler. Don't do this." It pleaded with my mother's voice. "I missed you so much, please you love me please." It sputtered, but I tuned it out with the rhematic sound of an axe carving up flesh, and eventually the pleading stopped.  Before Long I noticed the axe had been lodged into the floor. I let go of the handle, my hands shaking hands raw and bloody. Steam and viscera covered the area where the things head had been, the axe stuck in what was left like Excalibur.

I heard Pappy wheezing just a few feet away, snapping me out of my stupor. I rushed over to him and collapsed, taking his frail body into my arms. His eyes were barely open, his breath sick and wet. I could feel how broken his body was in my arms. Tears stung my eyes as I gently shook him and spoke his name.

"Pappy, come on old man wake up. Talk to me, just talk to me let me hear you talk." I said to him softly, dread creeping into my tone. His eyes barely opened but I could feel him looking up at me. He weakly grasped my shoulder, and he pursed his lips. 

"It didn't get my voice, boy." He Horsely whispered. He coughed up a lung afterwards and I could feel his already weak grip start to fade. "You're a good boy Tyler. I'm sorry I dragged you into this like I did Richie and your ma."

"Try not to speak Pappy." I urged him. "We can get help; you can make it out ok."

"No. Let it end here. Tyler don't push it, don't go looking for payback." Pappy pleaded. "Let those sleeping dogs lie in the dark where they belong. Promise me boy." His eyes begged me just as much as his words. The grief and shame of his vendetta overwhelming him in his final moments. I took his hand off my shoulder and gripped it tight.   
"I promise Pappy." A small smile formed on his face. He nodded his head.

"Good boy, you always were a good one." His voice drifted off and he took few finals breathes until passed in my arms, still holding my hand until the very last second. The next few hours were a blur. Eventually I found the strength to pull myself away from Pappy and called the cops. I don't know why I called them, I couldn't think of anyone else who might be able to help. What started as couple of patrol cars led to a full-blown circus going miles down the road as word spread of the monster massacre. I was bulldozed with questions and remarks about the things, and I could barely get a word in even if I wanted to.

Eventually men in black trucks and fancy suits pulled up. They had hazmat crews tag and bag the fallen winndys. I overheard radio chatter from them, talking in codes and lingo I could barely understand. A man with greying hair and a grim smile saddled up to me at some point. I had just been sitting on the front steps, a blanket thrown half heartly across my back by some sympathetic cop. The man wore a dark leather jacket and a black button down. His cloths reeked of cigars and wine. The man sighed and reached into his pocket, bringing out a pack of Newports. He lightly tapped my shoulder and offered me one. I staired at him blankly and he just nodded, whisking a cig from the pack and lighting it up.

"I didn't think you'd want one lad. Hell, I barely tolerate it myself now-a-days. But today is a mournful one." The man said solemnly. I studied him more closely, his thick Boston accent putting on a hell of a performance. 

"You knew him didn't you." I prodded. The man nodded. 

"My father was closer to him, but I met him a few times. Joined him on a hunting trip once, shot a bear. He was a proud man your grandfather. One of the best trackers I have ever known." The man beamed, extending a hand. "Call me Terry." I took his hand and shook it, a million questions rattling in my brain. He must have sense as much, so he went off.

"I'll take care of the funeral for the old man, to start with. I owe him the last rites. As for any sort of lingering feelings you might have about what happened here-" He began but I cut him off.

"He made me promise not to look for more of them, but there has to be. I heard dozens of those things out there." I waved to the forest, illuminated by the array of flashing red and blue. "I made a promise but. . . This all has to mean something, they took so much." 

"Monsters like that, it's all they do. You're probably right, there are more of them out there. More than you can ever comprehend." Terry replied ominously, but honestly.  "What happened today was a tragedy, Tyler. I am sorry." I was silent once more; Terry took the time to take a long frag from his cigarette. 

"I know what he wanted. But I can't shake that feeling. That I have to do something you know. Fight back." I finally spoke up

"You're talking about your brother." Terry replied

"And my mother." Terry was taken back by this, a crushed look in his eyes. He glanced away quickly.

"Didn't know that part. Robert never told me. She was a nice lass your ma. You have her eyes." Terry said softly. 

"So, you get it then, why I have to do this." I was eyeing the men in their black trucks as they loaded the bodies in. They all seemed to be quite calm considering the number of slain beasts. I had assumed they were feds but know? Maybe they could help me find some closure. 

"Don't be daft Laddie." I heard Terry speak up. "You think you want this because you're hurting, and I'm sorry son I truly am. But you don't want this. Trust me, ya just don't" He bitterly spat. I looked at him, this man who was at least 40 years old, but his eyes looked much older. I could see the streaks of silver and wet that spotted his once black hair, and the bags under his eyes seemed to carry the weight of eternity. 

"What can I do then." I said defeated. 

"Ya want my advice son. Go live. That's what your pappy would have wanted. Find ya self a nice girl and settle down and forget this nightmare. Honor him by enjoying the life he would have wanted for himself." Terry said, smacking my knee. I mulled over his words as his finished his smoke and got up. He offered a hand and a lift to a nearby motel he was staying at. After a final glance at the men in suits, I took his hand. 

That was a few years ago now. I know this is a somewhat anticlimactic and even sudden end but that's all there is to it. We had the funeral a few days afterwards, with Terry performing the service. Nice enough guy, I had dinner with him afterwards and he told me stories about Pappy and his life in general. Haven't seen him since but I do get Christmas cards.

I know you want to hear I went ahead and started hunting winddys anyway, or some creepy ending where I hear Pappy's voice calling me from beyond my backyard but no. I had my brush with evil and frankly that was enough for me. I took Pappy and Terry's advice to heart. Went back to the city, met someone, and went on with my life. Had our first kid a year ago.

We named him Bobby, after the best damn grandfather I ever had.
