What place in the house could befit such a painful way to go? It did not take me long to pick the living room, after finding and picking up my two weapons. Exhausted, I crashed on the sofa Razor sat on earlier, patiently waiting for the raging fire to consume me. As they went from flames to ashes, I watched many of the family's belongings slowly disappear. It felt disturbing to witness the family pictures on the walls burn, as all of them showed smiles aimed to lie and conceal dark truths that not only plagued our family for years, but also an entire village and many innocent people.

After at most ten minutes inside that hell, I started to cough and suffocate, overwhelmed by the heat and the smoke, while hearing the countless souls outside rejoice to the prospect of my demise. I clenched my weapons tighter the more I coughed, thinking about how I was about to end up fried at the age of 13. This was no sweet fictional story where everything is rosy or ends well. I had failed to stop Redeye, I had failed to save my family and on top of all that, I was about to die. How could I win such a battle? After all, was I not just a kid?

The question then popped in my mind suddenly: who am I? I remember the shadowy entity asking me that. Am I not the Outlander? I thought. Every single person in the world is going to cross the finish line one day, however, how that person will do it matters a great deal, at least, it does for me. What about me then? Is it how I am about to meet my end? Cowardly hiding in a burning house? I wondered, before jumping off the couch. It caught fire right at that instant and part of the ceiling then crashed on it. After everything I went through, after everything Edlynn went through, for all the souls that created the diary, for all humans, I could not let it end that way. With one forearm covering my nose, I made my way to the kitchen and used a cup to pour some tape water on myself. I was still hesitating to step outside until I spotted the gas cylinders we sometimes used to cook in the house, on the verge of going off due to the heat. Whether it was adrenalin, fear, courage or just my legs, I found myself speeding through the flames and exited the building right before the cylinders exploded.

My face on the ground, still lucid despite the blast, I heard the souls laugh and applaud at the spectacle. Holding my remaining weapon in one hand and the backpack in the other, I managed to shake off the dizziness before standing in front of them.

"Quite the tough kid huh?" The soul who ignited the fire said.

I wore the backpack and then took a fighting stance, handling the salt-covered stick with both hands and ready to defend myself till the last second. They all laughed at my resilience, many of them preparing their weapons to end me once for all. Then armed with a crowbar, the one who spoke earlier then approached, sauntering confidently towards me while I made tiny steps backwards, stuck between him and the fire. My ordeal was about to begin. He was ready to strike when the loudest sound of thunder I have ever heard demanded our attention as we all looked at the red sky.

"Looks like Razor already made the delivery." One of the souls said. "Your blood really is special, Outlander." She added.

"Redeye has done it! He's done it for us!" The one next to her said, rejoicing.

"Therefore it is true? After centuries, we shall finally become alive once again?" Another asked.

"The shepherd of souls fulfilled his promises." Another one said, rejoicing.

"That's the end kid. Tonight we win." The soul in front of me said.

However, before he was about to resume his attack, sounds of electricity draw everyone's attention back to the sky once again as the red lightnings entered in an ominous state of frenzy. In less time needed to say it, one of those lightnings struck the soul in front of me. It slowly lifted him in front of an amazed audience, and his eyes rolled, before he emitted gurgling sounds as his body began to contort, getting more and more mangled at each movement. It looked like a slow and painful ordeal by the hand of a sadistic torturer. Then, the red lightning released the soul who crashed on the ground, agonizing in front of me with his surprise filled eyes piercing mine.

One of his fellow souls approached while I recognized seeing another vessel in such a sorry state earlier. Mr Pavel, one of my father's friends whose mangled body landed next to the truck I was hiding under. The soul who approached examined the one on the ground until the latter succumbed to his injuries.

"I can't feel anything." The soul quietly said. "This is not what Redeye— This— That's the Red Death. He's dead!" The soul spoke, sending a wave of confusion and consternation among them as they began looking at each other, hoping to find an explanation that would come sooner than they thought.

Suddenly, other red lightnings struck several souls in the same brutal manner and at the same time, and the more time elapsed, the more many of them were mangled to death. Soon, they all scattered, screaming and running in random directions to hide and save their lives. Many entered buildings, thinking they would be sheltered from the red death. However, even through roofs and ceilings, they were still struck by the lightnings, that strangely attacked them only.

"BETRAYAL!!!" Some of them shouted.

"He lied to us!"

"We'll all die!" Others were shouting while fleeing as I became the least of their priorities.

That last statement however woke me up on the spot. Those bodies, those vessels, they belonged to the villagers, people I knew, people who have seen me grow. Everything I had been doing is for them, for my family and many more. The red death seemed to strike randomly yet massively, therefore, every villager was in danger including my family members wherever they were. In the middle of the chaos, I quickly retrieved the diary from the bag to check the location of the last altar, the Root Altar, before I started running towards its location, weapon in hand and through the many souls running around.

In my momentum, one of the souls grabbed my arm. My reflex of course was to strike him with my weapon but I stopped in my track when I recognized the familiar face of a well appreciated villager.

"Outlander..." He only said quietly and just stopped, but his sad and pleading eyes completed what he attempted to tell me before the red death took him right in front of me, while I remained unharmed.

"Nooo!" I let out, but I refused to witness his painful death and continued my run, the heart loaded with sadness, worries and anger.

Once again, I found myself in a familiar place, at the very center of my birthland: the village square. I stood there, at the exact point where the altar was supposed to be, confused about seeing nothing but some grass and sand. I checked the time to reassure myself, hoping that it was not too late, and read 9:27 pm. For someone that had to take an altar down before midnight, I really still had a lot of time, but where was it? I wondered. Wait, is it not called the Root Altar? After all, each of them had a specific name characterizing them one way or another, like all the previous ones being named according to their locations. The Root Altar was in the center of the village according to the map, and in most cases, roots are located underground, I thought. The Root Altar, as in the origin of all this mess or the root of the problem.

Using my hands and my weapon, I started digging at the location, as fast as I could for at least 20 minutes straight, running out of strength, running out of breath, tired, hungry, desperate, while still hearing the souls and by extension my people dying at the hands of the red death. I did not find anything and I was running out of time. I then got the diary out before frantically and mindlessly pacing through its pages unable to spot any clue. The screams all around the village nourished the growing frustration inside me, so I threw the diary away before scratching my head, not knowing what to do.

As a last resort, I picked up my weapon and ripped a piece off my partially burnt outfit. I folded it and used it to blindfold myself. There was no other choice other than to miraculously remember that strange ritual from earlier, that allowed me to disappear from the wine cellar. Yes, not the most logical or brilliant plan, but that was my plan. You know, I see and hear a lot of people complaining about all the poor decisions I have taken throughout my journey, about me running away most of the time. People think that once they find themselves in dangerous situations they will have the reflex or the lucidity to do the right thing. That is fiction. It is already hard for adult trained specialists like soldiers, so how about a thirteen years old kid? Therefore, I ran left, then left again and tried to remember the rest, but I was still hearing the screams and the lightnings of the red death. Of course, I failed to correctly remember the sequence of instructions and could no longer bear to hear the screams and the noises so much that I cried in despair, until I screamed louder.

"Stop, stop, just stop, stooooop!" I shouted while ripping the blindfold off my face with my eyes still closed. I just wanted the screams to stop and— they did. In fact, everything did as I could no longer hear even the lightnings of the red death.

When I opened my eyes, I noticed that everything was frozen in time, including the red lightnings in the sky, thus providing lighting and visibility in that new dimension I found myself in. However, nothing stood out more than the fancy brown casket placed in front of me, right where I dug a hole earlier. It looked like I was on the right path, but I really do not know how I achieved that. You know, it was like the way certain things in real life do not make any sense even though they happened. A miracle maybe? Who knows? The most important thing is that it occurred. Somebody out there, more involved in the supernatural than myself, might know what happened, but I do not, and I am really sorry about that.

I approached the coffin, weapon in hand, trying to make sense of the occurrence and get ready for any attack when it suddenly opened. I stepped back in fear, but soon realized that it was empty. That looked like an invitation to lie down in, but the eerie option seemed impossible for me. After longly hesitating, I remembered how time in another dimension could seem slower than in the real world, which meant that a lot of people were still dying, even though I was no longer seeing and hearing them in real time as everything was immobile except for me and the coffin. I could not allow myself to waste more time. I sat inside, then looked around just in case, before fully lying down only to see its lid violently slam to close the coffin. I immediately panicked, banging on the lid to force the casket open to no avail, and after a few seconds, it started shaking. The casket shook as if an earthquake surprised me while I was trapped inside, and I screamed and banged throughout the terrifying nightmare until it abruptly stopped and opened.

Vomit came out of my mouth at the same time I jumped out of the casket, and I crashed on a clean sparkling floor.

"How befitting! Just arrived and already making a scene." A voice said.

"Long live Redeye, master of the craft, shepherd of souls. Long live Redeye, master of the craft, shepherd of souls..." Other voices repeated.

The scenery I lifted my head to behold surpassed my imagination and still does to the very moment you are reading this. Ancient lit up oil lamps floated above everything in the large chamber, allowing me to see what resembled a palace throne room with walls covered with ancient colored paintings representing people who could be historical figures.

Redeye was present, dressed in his ceremonial attire just like earlier. On his left, something disgusting made of slowly moving, viscous, bloody plant roots seemed to crush something red and luminescent trapped in its grip. The two rotting corpses that accompanied Redeye earlier recited incantations in front of the altar, with their arms stretched towards it, making its roots slowly grow by the second. On his right, the terrifying stone statue of what I can only call a monster stood tall on several tentacles. It looked like an octopus with countless tentacles, but its head was covered with multiple, protruding, ominous and angry looking human heads all provided with faintly glowing red eyes. One of the faces was missing a right eye. On my left, my family members were trapped, each of them in individual cages, hypnotized with glowing red eyes and reciting those awful and undeserved praises about Redeye.

Seated on a floating golden throne, Redeye looked down on me with his expressionless golden mask. The third eye on the forehead shone brighter before the sealed facial features of his mask mysteriously moved as if it was alive, with the lips curling into a smile. Then, I heard his deep yet soft, calm and reassuring voice once again:

"Terrence, wonderful boy. You are welcome son."
