I watched my coworker get arrested and then found out he had a sinister plan for me.

I worked with this man for a little over three years. We worked pretty closely on some projects over the last two years and even sat near one another at work. In September I showed up and saw about 10 detectives at my place of work. I was a bit startled as this was quite unusual for my area. I looked around and saw that my coworker was in handcuffs and looked quite disheveled (which wasn’t out of the norm to be honest). I walked up to the detectives, introduced myself and let them know who I was in relation to him. I asked what was going on and they filled me in on why he was currently being arrested. For the sake of the case I won’t share more than he was a disgusting person. 

Over the course of the next 3 hours I watched as they dismantled his work station, went through his belongings, took evidence pictures and so on. I was pulled in an out of rooms answering questions about his character, what I knew of him and my feelings about him as a person. I told them he gave me a weird feeling in my gut. That I’ve always told my husband I wouldn’t be surprised if the cops ever did come looking for him. That my husband even thought he was weird, and if I ever went missing that he’d be the first person to be suspected (didn’t realize how real this almost was). 

The detective on site told me that they served a search warrant at his home and were looking there for any evidence. It sounds like they found more than they anticipated and were looking to see if there was anything else, unrelated to what they were currently investigating. I was asked my name and my husbands name for confirmation for something they found- which I did think was odd but I let it go and called my husband to update him on the happenings of the day thus far. However, the last hour I was pulled in for the final time and advised by one of the lead detectives, who couldn’t even look at me, that I needed to ensure I was safe and protected in the event they didn’t book him that day. Come to find out, he had been journaling about me over the course of at least a year. Saying he wanted to be with me but the “problem” was that I was married. 

His journal then lined out a plan to set my husband up for “cheating” on me. And the end resulted in my death- caused by him (my coworker). The officer said that everything in between was more vile than he’s ever heard- to the point he was crying when he was telling me to make sure I was safe… crying- A DETECTIVE- and didn’t want to “scare” me. Thankfully, he was charged and it looking at a long long time in prison. But I still think about it. It keeps me up at night. It just shows you never really know someone- even your coworkers.
