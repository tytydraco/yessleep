Flight MH370 | March 8, 2014

⸻

I don’t know if anyone will ever read this. I don’t even know if this will survive. But if it does—if anything is found—I want there to be something left of us besides silence. My name is [REDACTED], and I’m writing from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Or… I was.

We were somewhere over the South China Sea when it began. Or maybe earlier—I don’t know anymore. We took off after midnight, and the plane felt like any other red-eye: dim cabin, passengers sleeping, trays half-full of forgotten meals. The man beside me was watching a movie. A baby was crying softly four rows up. I remember thinking how peaceful it all seemed.

Then the screens froze.

The flight map just… stopped. The little plane icon hovered over the Gulf of Thailand and didn’t move again. I tapped the screen. Nothing. The woman next to me muttered something in Mandarin and tried hers. Same.

Then came the turn.

It was subtle at first—like when a car gently changes lanes. But I fly a lot, and I know what a flight path should feel like. This was wrong. We were veering west. Not north. Not toward Beijing. Back toward Malaysia.

No one said anything over the intercom.

Fifteen minutes passed. Still no announcement. The air grew tense—quiet. People began looking around. A businessman stood up and asked a flight attendant what was happening. She smiled too quickly and said it was “just a routing adjustment.” But her voice shook.

Then came the moment I will never forget.

One of the pilots—First Officer Fariq Hamid—stepped out of the cockpit. He nodded to the flight crew, stretched his arms, and walked to the restroom. I remember him clearly. Young. Calm. Normal.

He never got back in.

Moments after he left, we all heard it—a sharp metallic click. The kind you hear when a deadbolt slides into place. One of the crew members looked up in confusion and walked briskly to the cockpit. She knocked. Once. Twice. Her expression changed.

She tried the intercom. Nothing.

The co-pilot came back and knocked hard. “Captain?” he said. “Open the door.” No answer.

“Zaharie,” he said again, this time more urgent. “Captain, it’s me. Open the door.”

He started pounding. “Let me in!”

No answer.

Panic started to ripple through the rows. People sat up. Whispered. Someone asked, “Is this a hijacking?” A man near the emergency exit unbuckled his belt and stood. “Why can’t the pilot get back in?”

I saw fear in the crew’s eyes. They whispered among themselves, one of them crying. They tried the emergency override. It didn’t work. The cockpit was locked tight.

And then… we began to descend.

Not sharply. Not like something was wrong with the plane. It was smooth. Intentional. Controlled. Like someone was bringing us down on purpose.

The co-pilot kept knocking. Begging. “Don’t do this, Zaharie. Please.” Then he shouted, “What are you doing?”

But the captain never spoke.

I watched the flight tracker glitch and vanish. The cabin lights flickered. The smell of panic rose—sweat, metal, fuel. Someone screamed. A mother clutched her child. I could hear people praying in a dozen languages.

The crew gave up trying to stop the truth. One finally said it out loud. Her voice was flat. “He’s locked him out. He’s flying the plane alone.”

Someone asked, “Why?”

She just shook her head. “We don’t know.”

But we did.

We were being taken. We weren’t crashing—not yet. We were vanishing. He turned off our communications. He changed course. He dropped altitude to avoid radar. He planned this.

We weren’t broken. The plane wasn’t failing.

This wasn’t an accident.

This was murder.

The sea appeared outside the windows. Too close. Too calm. The stars had vanished, swallowed by the black. No land. No lights. No rescue.

We were ghosts already.

People began to call loved ones, but there was no signal. Just the mocking glow of locked screens. A man sobbed into his hands. The co-pilot sat on the floor by the cockpit, slumped, defeated. He whispered something again and again.

“Please… not like this.”

I couldn’t cry. Not yet. I just kept thinking: How did we end up in the hands of someone who wanted to disappear with us? What kind of pain, what kind of madness, drives someone to bury 238 souls in the ocean?

We began to descend again. Lower. Slower. I could see the reflection of our own plane on the water.

I wanted to believe someone would find us. Intercept us. That a radar would ping. That a fighter jet would rise and say: “Come back. You’re not alone.”

But we were.

Totally, completely alone.

Then the engines changed tone. The hum shifted. The nose tilted.

We were going down.

I’m writing this now because there’s nothing left to do. The lights are flickering. The cabin is shaking. People are screaming now. Some are quiet. One woman is singing softly.

The water is so close.

If anyone ever finds this—please tell the world: this was not an accident.

He locked the door.

He silenced the radios.

He flew us into the dark.

On purpose.

Tell our families we loved them. Tell the world not to forget us. We were here. We were real.

We were taken by a man who should have taken us home.
