The beginning of the end of my life began when I got married and the boat was the last straw.

 

Isn’t it crazy that a man can do the bare minimum but everyone will praise him? For twenty years I tolerated Sandy’s mediocrity. His stupid jokes, his dumb hobbies, or how he’d leave his beard hair shavings all over the bathroom sink. I stayed for the kids and a part of me thought maybe things would get better. But one year turned into ten and then twenty.

 

We talked about honey mooning in Hawaii. But I was six months pregnant on our wedding day. There was always something happening, Sandy went through four job changes in the first ten years of our marriage which put a damper in our savings. We had two more kids, a dog, and a mortgage on a house that was a money pit. We were trapped here. I was trapped here, a slave to my home, my husband and my ungrateful kids.

 

Last year Sandy started talking about how special our twentieth anniversary was going to be, how much he was looking forward to it and how it was something we’ve been needing for a long long time.

 

Could it be true? Had years of unsatisfaction finally paid off? For our entire marriage I dreamt of myself on sandy beaches, cocktails at sunset, evenings at the Lahaina Luau and the kids out of sight out of mind. Hawaii was my last hope at reconnecting with myself. A break in the misery that was my life, a sliver of hope that the suffocating existence of my marriage could be something better.

 

But then, he brought home the boat.

 

It wasn’t even a nice boat. A second hand piece of shit. You know the kind that you see parked up on peoples drive way. Green algae and brown discoloration on the hull. Peeling paint and a faded name scribbled on the side: Second Wind.

 

“What a beauty!” Sandy grinned like the cheshire cat, his arms spread out and proud. I stood there in disbelief. “We’ve been needing this Sharon. We can spend more time as a family, create more memories. The kids aren’t getting any younger.”

 

I just stood there. His smile faltered for a moment. “It’s an investment Sharon, these things are still pulling big bucks”.

 

I felt the rage erupting inside of me, “You spent our … you spent our anniversary savings on this?”

 

“The kids will love it, trust me, the kids will be so excited …”

 

The kids. The kids. Always the fucking kids. They adored him, clung to him like white on rice, so unaware of how much a disappointment he was. Sandy was a hero and could do no wrong in their eyes. But me? I was just their mother, the help, the invisible ghost who only appeared when they needed something.

 

The weekends were no longer ours. He and the kids spent their days on the Second Wind while I faked some illness, a chore, another obligation, anything to avoid watching them laughing and hanging on to his every word.

 

I don’t know what bothered me more, the fact that the summer will soon be over and I’ll be stuck with them or that everyone was enjoying themselves on my whim.

 

Then, one night, I woke to the soft sounds of giggling and Sandys low baritone voice.

 

“Shh!  You’ll wake your mother.” He said.

 

I crept to the top of the stairs, peering into the dimly lit living room. There they were, my children, my husband and the dog huddled on the living room floor. Sandy with a flashlight under his chin, telling ghost stories. The kids sat there in awe, enchanted by his tales. Then Jessie looked up at me and screamed.

 

“See! I told you you’d wake mom up.” Amber scoffed as she brushed passed me. Even the dog looked unhappy to see me.

 

I don’t think I’d ever felt this pathetic. But I sat at the top of stairs, crying for only god knows how long and then it hit me. Something changed, the rational and composed side of me was gone. Replaced by something darker and sharper. My thoughts twisted into something unrecognizable, imbued with spite and vindictiveness. My vision blurred. Vengeance pounding my in my ears.

 

I became numb after that. All the days blended into one. I became a dark shadow in the house, literally shifting the energy of the room with my presence and for once Sandy noticed.

 

“You haven’t been the same babe.” He said. Gee I wonder why. “You know, the summer is coming to an end, why don’t you come out with us?”

 

I realised this was an opportunity to wear the bathing suits I bought for Hawaii. So I agreed.

 

 

We voyaged far out into the ocean, I watched as Sandy read the markers and navigated through the channels and anchored in a near by bay. I was surprised and even a little impressed. Who would of guessed that Sandy was a bit of a seafarer.

 

I sat on the bow and watched has the kids played in the water. Maybe he was right, maybe this is what we’ve been needing this entire time. I felt good in my Benihana tankini and glass of wine in hand. I laid there catching some sun, until darkness loamed over me.

 

“Sandy, quit it, I’m trying to get some colour.” I said playfully. No answer.

 

I opened my eyes and saw a nasty dark cloud over top of us, I called out to Sandy but got no response. He was busy pulling in the anchor. The kids in the cabin eating cheese strings and playing rock paper scissors to see who gets the last fruit roll up.

 

“Maybe we should stay here, until the storm passes.” I suggested. He just stands there focused on driving through the storm. I check the cabin for life jackets for the kids, but there are none.

 

“Sandy, where are the life jackets?” I asked.

 

“Don’t bother, the kids are asleep don’t pester them for some life jackets.” He says casually.

 

I’m livid at this point. My perfect day ruined again by this man child who could not bother to check the weather before taking us out on the water. The bow of the boat rising and failing with each wave, and the two of us drenched and shivering, we could barely see what a head of us was.

 

“Ok honestly Sandy, we need to put on life jackets.” I pleaded

 

He looks around the boat. “Doesn’t look like we have any.” He says clueless.

 

“Well, let’s call the coast guards?”

 

“Uh, what radio?” He replied, scratching his head.

 

It hit me. I guess this was it, I guess this was how things were going to end. The tension radiating inside of me, conflicting feelings of impending doom and a wrath so strong I could strangle him. How could he be so unprepared and careless? So I sat there, mascara running down my face and my body steaming with anger and resentment.

 

“What’s wrong?” He asked dumbfounded.

 

“What’s wrong, Sandy? For twenty years, it’s always been about you. Four career changes—four!—and all it got us was a mountain of debt and this rundown house. And now, a boat? A boat that isn’t even seaworthy?” I said so angrily that my saliva foamed at the corners of my mouth like a rabid dog.

That’s when he did it, his lips curled into that smile that I hated so much and looked at me with soft eyes.

 

“Gee Share, I had no idea you felt…”

 

And I hit him with a wrench. I watched as his body floated out into the sea, his eyes locked on mine. The kids heard the splash and scurried up to see me.

 

“What happened to dad.” They asked simultaneously, eyes wide with fear.

The coast guard ruled it an accident. A tragedy out on the sea. I played my part well. The weeping widow and inconsolable mother.

 

The kids clung to me now.

 

And me? I finally had my peace. Sandy’s insurance paid out a pretty penny and I finally got my dream. A beach vacation in Hawaii.

 

Every now and then, while the kids are asleep, I drive out to where the boat is docked to pay homage to my saviour.

 

A Second Wind indeed.
