My son has always loved to play games. Little things, guessing games, hide and seek, riddles. He’d draw pictures and hide them around the house.

But as he got older, the games started to change.

One he called Quiet Steps. I would have to sneak through the house without him hearing me. He would laugh when he popped out to scare me. Strange, but harmless.

One evening, he called me while I was out. His voice was bright, full of excitement.

“Mom, I made up a new game! You have to find what’s missing when you get home.”

I smiled and asked for a hint.

“What runs and hides but can’t escape? If you can’t find it, you lose!” he said, giggling.

When I got back, everything looked normal except the pet cage. The door was open. The hamster wasn’t inside.

“Seriously? The hamster?” I sighed.

I told him this wasn’t funny and demanded to know where it was. He didn’t answer — just shrugged, quietly smiling.

I kept pushing, louder this time.

“Don’t you like my game, Mommy?”

There was something cold in his tone. No anger, no sadness, just something off.

“No, not this one. Now put the hamster back,” I shouted.

He didn’t flinch. Just turned toward the kitchen, opened the oven door, and reached inside. He pulled the hamster out carefully, its tiny body trembling but alive.

“Fine,” he said flatly.

He stomped toward the stairs, holding it close. Just before reaching the top, he stopped.

Without turning around, he said softly,

“You lose, Mommy.”

Then he kept walking.

I didn’t bring up the hamster again. He’d put it back, unharmed. I checked. I told myself it was just a bad joke. That he didn’t understand how cruel it was.

A few days later came the next game. He’d been quiet all morning, cutting paper and scribbling.

“It’s a scavenger hunt,” he said. “I made it for you.”

The first note was on my pillow.

*Start where the house hums at night.*

The next was on the fridge.

*You’re getting hot.*

Somewhere hot? I moved down the hall to the kitchen.

The last note was taped to the oven door. I knelt and opened it.

Inside was the hamster. 

This time, it wasn’t breathing.

A note beside it, written in red crayon.

*You lost.*

I buried the hamster that night under the lilac bush. He watched from the window, his face half-hidden by the curtain.

After that, he stopped talking. No more drawings. No more games.

Until tonight.

The lights went out. The house fell into a heavy silence. Everything that made the house alive stopped breathing.

I waited, hoping it was just the fuse. Then I heard the floor below me — a slow step, then another.

I knew what it meant, really. He wanted to play.

The circuit breaker was in the basement. And so was he.

A small light glowed beside the basement door — a flashlight. I picked it up.

A note was taped to the handle.

*Turn on the power and you win.*

I opened the door and listened. Silence.

I slowly crept down. The stairs creaked like they were warning me not to go.

Halfway, something scraped along the concrete wall. My hand tightened on the railing.

At the bottom, the basement stretched out, black and endless. The breaker box was across the room, just a few steps away.

Then I saw him — standing there, back to me. Still. Perfectly still.

One hand on the breaker. Something long in the other.

He turned his head just enough for me to hear him whisper, almost kindly,

*“Don’t lose, Mommy.”*
