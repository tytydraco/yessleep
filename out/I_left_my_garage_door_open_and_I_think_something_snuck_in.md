Hello everyone. My name's Derrek. I'm 17 and live in the Suburbs in one of the States (keeping it anonymous for obvious reasons).

  
The best way I could describe my community is through the word retirement. To give you an idea, there's a park across my house that I used to play at with my friends growing up. Next to the park was a small little lot with a basketball hoop. After a couple years, the neighbors complained that the hoop was being used when they were trying to nap at 3:00 pm in the fucking afternoon (excuse the language, I have a bit of a temper), and the local security decided to relocate the hoop all the way across town.

  
Anyway, most of my neighborhood friends and I have stopped talking much for other reasons I can get into later if you want. But I want to focus on the reason I'm writing this.

  
My parents are away on a trip to Germany (my dad's business is Headquartered there and they had some kind of big event). In their absence, I have been doing mostly what I do everyday: watch movies and youtube videos, work out, go for walks or drives (my dad gave me his old Honda Accord when I got my license). I don't have that many friends and I'm not really the party type so that doesn't interest me. I more-so just enjoy the freedom of peace and quiet.

  
Anyway, last night I went for a walk after sundown. I remember opening my garage because I was doing a little workout with the pullup bar and dumbbells we have stashed there, then started the loop all the way round past the security station, water tower, tennis ball courts (where the basketball hoops is), and then along the main road back to home. I was listening to music with one earbud while walking, enjoying the mixture of dark academia music and dim scenery.

  
While I was walking back, I was thinking about a story I have been working on. Oh, I forgot to mention that, I'm really big into writing. I've been working on this big novel about consciousness. Actually, a lot of my ideas are inspired by my dad who works in the tech industry, but like my friend stories, I'll leave all that for another time.

  
I arrived back at my house and tunnel-visioned directly into the garage. I went to flip off the light and go inside, but when I hit the switch, the lights turned on. I'll admit that I was a bit surprised and kinda jumped a bit. I had been so caught up in this story that I didn't realize it was the motion lights that were on. You see, my garage has two kinds of lights. The motion lights turn on when something (like a car) enters and last a couple minutes for the person to get out and go inside. Then there's the actual lights that you switch on and off.

  
Thinking this over, I froze in place. Something other than me had entered the garage less than two minutes ago. Either that, or there was some kind of malfunction. Now my house isn't a mansion by any means, but our car is large enough to (just) squeeze three cars and we have a security system which can be accessed from inside and the garage. I clicked it and tried to see if any of the alarms had gone off. They were all still dormant.

  
At this point, the hairs were beginning to stand on the back of my neck. And then the lights went out. I yelped and ran outside, reactivating the motion lights as I moved past the threshold. My heart was pounding as I sprinted the six seconds to the end of the driveway. What was in there?

  
I pulled my phone out to text my dad and saw my battery was at 5%. *Damn. Why didn't I charge it earlier?* I sent both my dad and my mom a text explaining the situation in about three sentences: "Coming home I noticed the motion lights in garage were on. I think someone might have come in. What should I do?" After a few minutes of waiting (and my battery dropping to 3%), I decided to give my dad a call. The phone rang 6 times and at last he picked up. The conversation went like this:

  
Me: Hey, dad—

  
*Static*

  
Me: Dad? Can you hear me?

  
Dad: Son? you there?

  
Me: Yeah, I'm here. Did you get my message?

  
Dad: Your message? No. Did you get mine?

  
*I checked my texts.*

  
Me: No, nothing.

  
Dad: Look, son, your mom and I are back in the States. Something happened. I need you to—

  
*Cuts off.*

  
"Damn it!" I yell, cursing my dead battery. I considered what he had said. *his message, back in the States, something happened*. None of it was making any sense. Somehow the phone call had only added to my anxiety. I looked back over at the garage. The light was off. I considered calling 9-1-1, but I thought this situation wasn't serious enough for that. Maybe security? I considered it, but I really didn't like any of the security officers. They were snobby and standoffish and when I was young one of them yelled at me for kicking a soccer ball into a neighbor's bush.

  
I sighed and walked back over to the garage, sweeping my foot inside to reactivate the light. It went on immediately. Maybe it just went on by accident, I thought. I walked into the garage and scouted all the possible corners someone could be hiding, squeezing my phone against my chest the entire time. Alas, there was no one. Nothing. I was walking back to go inside when I heard something shift in the ceiling. At that exact moment, I saw a little rope dangling in front of me. I recalled immediately the rope which pulled open a trap door and a set of steps which led up to the attic which was situated above our garage. The rope was swaying as if hit by a breeze, and the trapdoor squeaked.

  
I froze again, staring at the rope, not daring to look up. The motion lights went out once again, and I still didn't move. I pictured eyes in the darkness, peering down at me. I must have stayed a statue for at least five minutes. Finally, after hearing no sound since the squeak, I tiptoed toward the house door, and when I was within a couple steps, I threw myself on it, twisting the handle, jumping inside, and thrusting it shut behind me. I clicked the lock, then turned on all of the lights on the main floor. My phone charger was upstairs in my room, but I was still too panicked to get it. It took me thirty minutes to build up the courage to go upstairs. Luckily, I didn't find anyone waiting for me. I grabbed the charger and went back downstairs. The TV had been on the entire time to some random news channel. I just needed the sound of someone else's voice to comfort me.

  
When I turned on my phone, I saw that I had 17 missed calls. 2 were from my dad. 1 was from my mom. The other 14 were from an unknown number. The unknown number had left 14 voicemails. I played the first one randomly. It was just 10 seconds of a low humming or staticy sound. I played another and it was the same. The third one also started off quiet. I was about to click out when I heard a sound in the voicemail. It wasn't super clear, but it sounded like... footsteps?

  
I gulped, feeling the same terror as before creeping back into my skin. At that moment a text notification came up. It was from my dad.

  
Dad: Something went wrong at the lab. We think something got out. Coming home early with mom to take care of it. If have any trouble, call Jen and have her pick you up. Be home a little after 1.

  
I am now sitting at the chair in my dining room, a few minutes after reading the text message, unsure of what to do. The news channel which has been on came through with a breaking alert. Apparently there have been strange sightings of distortions in the sky all over the country. I called Jen, my Aunt, but she didn't pick up. I left a voicemail asking her if she could come get me.

Update (2 minutes later): there is a knock at my front door. I haven't moved a muscle. And to make matters worse, I just realized I still haven't closed the garage door. I feel trapped, but I also don't feel comfortable going outside. What should I do? I'll keep you updated if I can.
