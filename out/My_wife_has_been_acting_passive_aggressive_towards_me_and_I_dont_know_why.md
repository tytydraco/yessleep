Lately, my wife has been acting passive aggressive towards me. And I don’t know why. Every time I arrive home from work, I’m greeted by her icy stare, followed by a “oh, it’s you.” Whenever I ask her out on weekends, she shrugs and says, “I’m busy,” or, “it’s always where you want to go.” I tell her it isn’t true. I say let’s go where you want. But she just shuts me down and says she’s not feeling it. She spends most of her time in her office (a room in the second floor of our home). She’s always typing on her laptop, click and clack, click and clack, all day every day. I’ve done my best to  give her space, but it’s starting to upset me and even hurt my feelings. I just don’t know what to say to her. 

Not sure what good this will do me. Just venting my marital issues in this subreddit. I’m thinking of setting up an appointment for couples therapy, but isn’t that extreme? I don’t even know what the problem is. 

I’ll try to talk to her today. I’ll update this when I can. 

Next update:

I spoke with my wife. I brought up what I felt were instances of her being passive aggressive. She responded with a dry laughter. 

“I’m not mad, Mark,” she said, “no, just been so wrapped up on the latest project. That’s all.”

My wife worked  remotely for this big advertisement firm. And despite it being work from home, it was still stressful. And I knew how hard she had it, being the only woman in a top level position, constantly proving herself that she was the right person for the job. 

In that moment, I felt like an utter goober. Selfish. I apologized. She just laughed and kissed me on the cheek and told me to make it up to her later in bed.

And I did.

Everything was going smoothly, and it really felt that things were going back to normal. My wife and I were spending a lot of time together. We were happy, I thought. There was less tension in the house. 

Then, one day, while at work, I get this call from an unknown phone number. I didn’t answer it, thinking it was just one of those scammers. But they called again, so I decided to answer.

“Hello?”

“Mark,” came a familiar voice. “Mark, oh sweetie, it’s so good to hear your voice.”

It was my wife. 

“Uh, hey, what’s up? Did something happen to your phone?”

“Mark, I need you to listen to me carefully. Whatever you do, don’t have sex with the other me.”

“Jessica, what are you talking about!”

“Mark, I haven’t been home in weeks. Just please tell me you didn’t have sex with the other me.”

I laughed.

“This is too much. Good one ho—“

Before I could finish my sentence, I saw my wife heading toward me without a phone in sight.

When she reached me, her expression changed.

“Are you okay?” She asked. “Who are you talking to?”

“Mark,” the voice on the phone pleaded, “who is that? Is it the other me?”
