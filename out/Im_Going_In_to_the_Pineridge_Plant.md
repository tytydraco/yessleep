Hey — Sam again.

This might be the last thing I post for a while. Not forever, but long enough that I wanted to get it down before I go.

I’ve been preparing. Dug out the welcome packet from when I first got hired at the plant — maps, safety booklets, the whole introductory package. But they don’t match my memory. Back then, I didn’t think much of it. Every plant has restricted zones, but normally they're marked on the map. So I took a pen and added them in from where I remember, marking every one of those mysterious doors.

The Board seems to have stopped breathing down my neck altogether. Seems they’re busy fighting investigators with paperwork and lawyers. That gives me space — not safety, just space. And in that space, I’ve been planning. Flashlight, spare batteries, notebook, pen. Mask, company cap, gloves. I’m not worried about sticking out—since this ‘flu’ started, more people have been wearing masks. Combined with the company hat and my uniform, I’m sure I’ll look like just another plant worker.

My access card is still suspended, but I know other ways in. Maintenance access and the like. More awkward to navigate and less clean than the hallways, but less likely to trigger any serious security systems. Mostly just number locks and passwords.

I’m not doing this for glory. Not for vindication. I’m doing it because I have to. Because there is no one else who seemingly will. The investigators move slowly, delayed by the Board’s obstruction, endless meetings, and bureaucracy. The government may eventually act, but every day they stall, the water continues to flow, and the town continues to get sick. If someone doesn’t go in and see for themselves, the truth will probably remain buried. And that someone has to be me. I’ve worked at that plant for years, know the hallways like the back of my hand.

I’ve got nothing left to lose. Friends won’t talk to me, the town sees me as a conspiracy nut, and my family is far away. I’m already infected — the tingling, the aches, the headaches — they’re a constant reminder. Every day I delay is a day the infection spreads further, and I can’t sit and wait for someone else to make a move. If I’m going down, I’ll at least know why, and I’ll at least try to stop it for the town.

I’ve gone over the routes a dozen times in my head. Every hallway I’ll avoid, every corner where someone could be watching. I don’t know what will happen if I’m caught, and I don’t care to think about it.

I don’t know what’s waiting for me, and I don’t want to. That unknown is exactly what I need to see. Because if the Board, the investigators, or anyone else won’t act, I will. Because I’m the only one left who can.

So if I go quiet after this, don’t initially assume the worst. I’ll be focused, keeping my head down, moving as carefully as I can. No one will stop me. No one even notices I’m gone. Friends won’t call. The town thinks I’m crazy. The Board is busy elsewhere. That’s all I need—freedom to walk straight into the unknown. Wish me luck. Next time I post, I’ll know more. Or I won’t.
