I’ve ALWAYS had dry scalp.

I’ve tried everything I can Google to take care of it: conditioners, oil treatments, apple cider rinses. Having fine, dark hair that shows every flake and dampens with any bit of extra oil has been so frustrating.  

When my girlfriend came home from the farmers market with a new treatment, I was skeptical. However, I agreed to try it.

When I say even massaging it into my scalp brought instant relief, I mean it. Obviously, I didn’t expect all the dry flakes to go away immediately, but the itching greatly subsided. Fewer white flakes greeted me every morning over the weeks I used it until they had completely disappeared.

I’ve been using it for three months now.

This morning when I woke up, I was surprised to find flakes on my nightgown. On closer inspection, my concern grew. They looked like lice eggs, but a strange golden color. My girlfriend had already left for work (I have a day off) and their mom was off on a trip with her sister. The more I’ve searched Google the less I’m convinced they’re lice eggs. I’ve been trying to get a good picture to send my girlfriend to get their input but my camera refuses to focus well enough. Does anyone have any idea what they could be? How concerned should I be?

Sooo the mods removed my post for not enough words. Which, turns out I should have read the rules before posting. Fair I guess.

I’ve tried posted on hair care subreddits but no one’s responded with anything helpful so far. All anyone can come up with is lice and food crumbs and . . . a few other things I’d rather not repeat here. I even messaged my doctor on MyChart to a much similar reply, minus the inappropriate trolling.

I decided to spend some more time studying them to see if I can figure out anything more about them. I’ve collected a few in a plastic bag. 

I tried washing my hair earlier but that didn’t seem to decrease the amount of them. If anything there’s just MORE of them. 

I laid them very still on the counter and watched. Maybe I’m seeing things but I swear I saw them squirming a little. Maybe even growing a bit? They look bigger than earlier. 

I have a brush with scratchy bristles so I was able to collect a fair portion. They’re very uniform so DEFINITELY not flakes or crumbs. 

I’m really not sure what to make of all of it. I haven’t been feeling any unusual symptoms besides my usual aches and pains from my arthritis.

My girlfriend said they’d take a look when they get home. We haven’t had any bug issues besides a few ants since we moved in with their mom and from what I can tell they don’t look like anything to do with ants.

Oh nooooooo. Before I posted this I decided to check on them one more time.

They’ve DEFINITELY grown. Not a whole lot, but enough I can tell it’s not just me seeing things. I’m almost certain they’ve doubled in size.

I’m not sure what to do. What if they keep growing and our cat eats them? I think I’m gonna keep her in my girlfriend’s mom’s room for now.

It’s gotta be some kind of parasite. What if it spreads? I almost want to tell my girlfriend not to come home tonight and stay in a hotel or maybe even their dad’s. I’m gonna start squashing as many as I can.

Does anyone know what else I could possible do? I really need advice.
