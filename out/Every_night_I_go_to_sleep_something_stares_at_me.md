
I think my obsession with horror started when I was a small boy. Back when blockbuster was a thing, I’d make my mom rent me the Star Wars trilogy every Friday night. It was our little bonding activity that got a little stale over the years. One night, my mom rented an extra movie she was particularly giddy over with the store clerk. “Mom, what other movie did you rent tonight?” I asked curiously on the passenger seat of my mom’s Durango. “It’s a movie for grown-ups, kiddo.” She said while not taking her eyes off the road. “Can I watch it with you?” I begged in the most innocent way I could without coming off annoying to mom. She just gave me the faintest smirk. “Alright, but you gotta promise to be brave if you wanna watch it.” I was anything but brave.

My mom had rented 1982’s the thing, and boy, was it something. I had never seen a horror film before, and this gave me nightmares I didn’t even think I could have for weeks. The strangest thing happened to me…I enjoyed that feeling of pure terror from watching the movie. I begged my mom to rent more movies just like the thing that would get me the thrills I was seeking. We went down a rabbit hole for years: a nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, the blob, the fly, jeepers creepers…if it had an iconic horror monster, we watched it together.

Eventually and inevitably, like a drug addict, I would need more to get the same highs. it didn’t help that by the time I moved out to go to college, they just didn’t do horror films like they used to. Sure, once in a blue moon a horror movie comes along that can put the fear of God in me, but Hollywood seems complacent to make low effort poltergeist movies that will guarantee money at the box office. It wasn’t until a few months ago I stumbled across reddit and found creepypastas. 

I was surprised at the collection of talented writers that could genuinely scare the shit out of me with their stories. I was starving for good frights, and for a while there, I was eating well. Unfortunately, this newfound bounty of great horror stories came with unintended consequences. Whenever I read or listened to a creepypasta, I could feel something…watching me. It didn’t help that I live alone and I would consume my content in the dark. Even after shutting off my phone and turning all the lights off, the overwhelming sense of dread and the shivers up my spine would still be there.

After a bit of time, the feeling would fade away, and after tiring myself out with homework, I would go to bed as usual. A few weeks ago, around 3am, I was woken up. It took me a few moments to be lucid enough to hear it, but I did. Something was moving in my room. I was under my blanket and couldn’t confirm it, but every being in my body screamed there was someone in my room. 

It took what felt like an eternity to build up the courage, but I quickly removed the blanket covering my face and scanned the room in darkness. It took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust, but just across my bed, in the corner of the room, there was a black silhouette of a tall, thin man just staring at me. I screamed as I took a tumble out of my bed, scrambling for my phone in pitch black darkness. I could feel whatever that thing in my room was coming closer as I desperately tried to find my phone. In a hail Mary moment, I felt the cold hard screen of my phone and quickly turned it on, illuminating my room. 

There was nothing. No one was in my room at all, other than me and my heart that was about to pound out of my chest. Didn’t sleep at all the rest of the night…or the next few days. It’s been affecting my life and college. I got kicked out of my anthropology class because I couldn’t stay awake.

My friend came to talk to me after class. She’s been a cornerstone through some tough times in my life, but I didn’t know how to explain what’s going on without sounding like a madman. “I’ve been watching too many horror movies lately…I’m not sleeping too well.” Was the only thing I could come up with when interrogated by her. “Well, I know you love that shit but try taking a break now and then? Sometimes, bad things can latch on to you when you open doors like that in your life.”

She came from a religious household and always tried to tie shit to the bible somehow… but what if she wasn’t wrong this time? What if I had let something in by exposing myself to all the horror movies and stories I read? I tried to get everything out of my mind, and at the end of the day, I drove home, which, in retrospect wasn’t a good idea. I was falling asleep on the wheel since I barely had any sleep in the past few days. I tried slapping myself and playing loud music just to keep my eyes open.

I lost consciousness for a few moments and only woke up when I heard the horn of an incoming car I was going to crash into. I swerved my car out of the way and back into my lane with only seconds to spare. The near-death experience had me wide awake and shaking. I adjusted my rearview mirror to check on the other car behind me, and to my horror, the same black figure was sitting in the back seat of my car.

I panicked and nearly crashed into a tree. After fully stopping at the side of the road, I checked the back seat…and it was gone. Between the lack of sleep and this thing following me everywhere now, I feel like I’m losing my mind. Last night, I decided to sleep with the lights on and a couple of candles around my room. I spent hours trying to relax enough to fall asleep but ended up collapsing of exhaustion. I slept for maybe 30 minutes before waking up in a panic and realizing my room was completely dark. The power had gone out, and my candles were blown out.

I forgot to put the blanket over my face before passing out, and now I was petrified with fear hearing the same movements somewhere in the dark in my room. I slowly turned my head to the edge of my bed and took a few moments to register that something was staring right back at me. I didn’t have enough time to scream as I felt something grab my t shirt and pull me out of the bed. I was dragged and slammed across my room until, somewhere in the darkness, I found the cracked screen light of my cellphone. I managed to grab on to it and turn on the flashlight, I pointed to my legs as I felt I was being dragged by them.

I was already knee-deep in the process of being pulled under my bed when the black shape disappeared again with the light of my phone screen. As if on cue, the power turned back on, and I just stayed on the floor until the morning sunrise. It's now almost night again, and I’m scared of what it's going to do to me. I’m too tired to think…too tired to care. After I post this, I think I’m going to rest my eyes for a second or two…just rest my eyes.
