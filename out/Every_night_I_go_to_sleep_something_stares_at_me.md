
I think my obsession with horror started when I was a small boy. Back when blockbuster was a thing, I’d make my mom rent me the Star Wars trilogy every Friday night. It was our little bonding activity that got a little stale over the years. One night, my mom rented an extra movie she was particularly giddy over with the store clerk. “Mom, what other movie did you rent tonight?” I asked curiously on the passenger seat of my mom’s Durango. “It’s a movie for grown-ups, kiddo.” She said while not taking her eyes off the road. “Can I watch it with you?” I begged in the most innocent way I could without coming off annoying to mom. She just gave me the faintest smirk. “Alright, but you gotta promise to be brave if you wanna watch it.” I was anything but brave.

My mom had rented 1982’s the thing, and boy, was it something. I had never seen a horror film before, and this gave me nightmares I didn’t even think I could have for weeks. The strangest thing happened to me…I enjoyed that feeling of pure terror from watching the movie. I begged my mom to rent more movies just like the thing that would get me the thrills I was seeking. We went down a rabbit hole for years: a nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, the blob, the fly, jeepers creepers…if it had an iconic horror monster, we watched it together.

Eventually and inevitably, like a drug addict, I would need more to get the same highs. it didn’t help that by the time I moved out to go to college, they just didn’t do horror films like they used to. Sure, once in a blue moon a horror movie comes along that can put the fear of God in me, but Hollywood seems complacent to make low effort poltergeist movies that will guarantee money at the box office. It wasn’t until a few months ago I stumbled across reddit and found r/nosleep.

I was surprised at the collection of talented writers that could genuinely scare the shit out of me with their stories. I was starving for good frights, and for a while there, I was eating well. Unfortunately, this newfound bounty of great horror stories came with unintended consequences. Whenever I read or listened to a creepypasta, I could feel something…watching me. It didn’t help that I live alone and I would consume my content in the dark. Even after shutting off my phone and turning all the lights off, the overwhelming sense of dread and the shivers up my spine would still be there.

After a bit of time, the feeling would fade away, and after tiring myself out with homework, I would go to bed as usual. A few weeks ago, around 3am, I was woken up. It took me a few moments to be lucid enough to hear it, but I did. Something was moving in my room. I was under my blanket and couldn’t confirm it, but every being in my body screamed there was someone in my room. 

It took what felt like an eternity to build up the courage, but I quickly removed the blanket covering my face and scanned the room in darkness. It took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust, but just across my bed, in the corner of the room, there was a black silhouette of a tall, thin man just staring at me. I screamed as I took a tumble out of my bed, scrambling for my phone in pitch black darkness. I could feel whatever that thing in my room was coming closer as I desperately tried to find my phone. In a hail Mary moment, I felt the cold hard screen of my phone and quickly turned it on, illuminating my room. 

There was nothing. No one was in my room at all, other than me and my heart that was about to pound out of my chest. Didn’t sleep at all the rest of the night…or the next few days. I don’t know what it is or what it wants. I just know that it’s been progressively getting closer every night I go to bed. 

Last night, I woke up from a nightmare, and it was standing over me…watching me sleep. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night but could still feel it there. I’m going to try and stay awake for as long as I can, but I’m afraid of what it’s going to do to me the next time I go to bed…
