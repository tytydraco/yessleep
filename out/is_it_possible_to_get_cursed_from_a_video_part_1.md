one day i had a party but with just a bit of my friends and my younger cousin. that day has already started bad cause that day was the same day i got sexually assaulted by the pizza delivery guy.

the party was amazing and going fun but at one point we all got bored. niky(which is my younger cousin) said that we should all watch scary videos in the dark. the moment she said that i did not have a very good gut feeling. but everyone started yelling that yeah we should blah blah blah. i wanted to tell them no but i felt like i would have been mean if i did and also i couldn’t calm them all down. so i had them pick a video so i can put it on the tv so everyone can see. my friend elissa picked the video, she tried to show us which one is what because she was too scared of the video to even look at the thumbnail. i ended choosing the wrong one. 

the first video was a woman. she look asian. i don’t remember much from the video but i think there was yelling or something and she was in a form of a train or something. since it was the wrong video, elissa showed us properly which video was the one she had watched.

the second video was a man who was tap dancing. we all thought the way that he was dancing was funny so we all started bursting out laughing and one of us had even mocked it.

after the video celeste realized the video was supposedly cursed. we didn’t know what to do so we went on to do something else. after a bit nataly said she saw something under my bed. i looked under bed there was nothing. and next to where i live there is a car shop and on top of the car shop was an owl. it was a statue but it was never there before. i don’t remeber who searched up the meaning of seeing an owl out of nowhere but it said death and witchcraft and stuff like that.

i don’t remember much from that day but the situation does escalate.

the day after the party around the same time of the party nataly’s turtle sadly passed away, it was weird to her because she said he was healthy the day before. the girls and i started to get visions. the only one who didn’t get visions or heard and saw stuff was paula. i feel like the main reason she didn’t experience any of those things is because she didn’t believe in those type of stuff. but the rest of us did.

the vision nataly had once which i belive was the first vision one of us ever had scared the fucking shit out of me. it was literally during school, we were in reading class. all of a sudden valentina( who knows about the situation but wasn’t there) called me over to her table because nataly had something to tell me. she told me she had a vision out of no where, she said that 3 of us had died. in very bad ways. she said one of us had burned to death. like a house fire or maybe arson. she said one of us had suffocated to death so maybe suicide. and she said the other person had been stabbed to death. i asked her if she saw who were those 3 people but she says she don’t really see faces on like the body. 

i’ll post a part 2 on the rest of the visions, dreams and all of that that happened to us.

fyi this isn’t fake or made up and i’m sorry if there’s grammar mer errors and please ask if anything doesn’t make sense
