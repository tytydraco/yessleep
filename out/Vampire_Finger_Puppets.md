The Midnight Minutes had been summoned.

My name is Andy and I live at a residential college of a university. In an effort to promote cross cultural and political exchange, the student body had formed a group called the Midnight Minutes.

A number of individuals from varying beliefs would come together at least once a month to discuss a matter over. The discussions would be then synopsised and put into the student newsletter. In tradition, these meetings would take place in the student common room late in the night. Usually starting at around ten in the evening, but as they would often continue for hours into the night, the name the Midnight Minutes stuck.

I belonged to the sixth generation of Midnight Minute members. I was the atheist of the group and politically sat somewhat left centre.

While there were our regularly scheduled meetings, there were also ad hoc, "emergency" meetings if one of us had a topic we really wanted to talk about. This would result in a summon.

Aleesha had summoned us.

I was the earliest. Chloe joined me next. With a plus sized figure, faded clothes that always looked starchy, frayed, and uncomfortable, Chloe was the Evangelical Christian. She was a right wing, pro life, anti lgbtiq marriage, New World Order conspiracist and young Earth creationist. But at least she wasn't a flat earther.

Needless to say, I found Chloe insufferable. Although she did always try to be nice to me. Prays for my salvation every night she tells me.

She greeted me with a chirp and I grunted in reply.

Before I was forced to endure any small talk, Jordan and Raj came in. Jordan and Raj are Hindus and gay. And yes, they were seeing each other. I found them amusing as it was easy to lure them into self conflicted arguments between their professed religion and Indian customs against their LGBTIQ identity causes. They weren't terribly religious to be fair.

No, what made Jordan and Raj interesting was their real passion: ghost hunting.

Here we got into serious debate. The paranormal to me is completely lacking in evidence. But they were true believers. I did follow them out to a couple of expeditions. An old factory and an abandoned house. And my conclusion was that ghost hunting is the most boring experience in the world. Sure the places are a bit creepy. But waiting in the dark for 10 hours, with no electricity, mobile service, or working plumbing, for nothing to show up is tedious work.

We waited for Aleesha. She was the Satanist. As vexing as I found Chloe, I found it difficult who was worse. Chloe was part of a religion that affected politics and therefore caused a lot of people to be mistreated. Satanism (unless you buy into Chloe's conspiracy theories that it controls the government) was actually more sensible, simply built around embracing the principle that human beings are selfish. However it had its creepy aspects and Aleesha seemed far more interested in the occult side of things than the life principles. One would have thought this often put Aleesha in league with Raj and Jordan belief wise. But the two always turned almost viciously sceptical with Aleesha. I think they were in truth scared of her. Everyone was.

While waiting I politely asked Raj and Jordan about their most recent ghost hunting venture.

Predictably, it had been an underwhelming affair. They were a bit bummed and were considering stopping their exploits as they were entering their final semesters. Chloe encouraged this by asking them to seek God and repentance. But although I don’t believe in ghosts, I was oddly disappointed they were giving up on their enterprise. It had made them interesting, and at least ghost hunting was not an organised religion.

Twenty minutes went by and I was just about to call Aleesha when my phone rang. It was Aleesha.

Speak of the devil. She wanted a video call.

I flipped the accept call button and Aleesha’s face filled the screen. Dark skinned and goth, Aleesha’s teeth gleamed white like a shark’s as her mouth pulled into a broad smile.

“Hello, everyone,” she greeted.

I put my phone down on a coffee table before us . Raj and Jordan craned over so they could be in the frame, but Chloe only moved a fraction closer with her forehead in the picture.

“What’s going on, Leesh?” I asked, “Thought you were joining us.”

"I’m… predisposed at the moment," she said smiling. “I have a challenge for you all. A test of faith, if you will.”

Raj chuckled. “Sorry, Leesh,” he said, “We already gave you a shot.”

Raj and Jordan had attended a seance with Aleesha and her coven before. Unfortunately, the powers of darkness had not chosen to reveal themselves then. The Hindu ghost hunters had never let her forget it at these meetings.

But tonight Aleesha did not seem discouraged by her previous failure.

“Oh but you’re really going to love this one,” Aleesha replied, her voice lowering into a hiss. “There’s a little house in the suburbs out here. I’ve just recently gotten to know the owner and stayed over myself. It’s the real deal.

She’s invited all of you over to spend a night this Saturday. If you can last a night that is.”

“One of your Satanist friends, Leesh?” I asked, “Getting ready a bit of a haunted house attraction for us? Bit early for Halloween.”

“Not at all,” Aleesha said undeterred, “Bring anything you want to investigate. Infrared cameras, ultraviolet torches, x-ray vision goggles, anything. You can even visit early if you like.”

Chloe piped up in a shrill voice. “I’m sorry but I come to these meetings to represent Jesus and share the Word of God. I wish you all would stop turning this group into a way to interact with Satan and his minions.”

Chloe had a point. This was meant to be a discussion group.

“Faith a little shaky, Jesus girl?” Aleesha sneered.

Chloe sighed and rolled her eyes. Then she got up and made to leave. Before she did though, she looked at us three boys solemnly, “The Holy Spirit is telling me you shouldn’t go ahead with this. I’ll be praying very hard for all of you. Good night.”

Raj and Jordan were thinking. Jordan shrugged and tapped his boyfriend on the shoulder. “How about one last one for the show?” he asked.

“Yeah sure. Why not?”

One last one, I thought. Well it’s not like I had a date or anything lined up.

“Alright, Leesh. I’m in too,” I said, “But if Satan doesn’t show up with a beer in hand, we are going to make a big post about this all over the student newsletter.”

“Deal,” she said, “I’ll send you the address.” And then the call went dead.

Well that was a fast meeting.

The weekend rolled round and I rocked up to the address that Aleesha had given us. It was around five thirty in the evening, but gathering clouds had blocked the remainder of sunlight and formed ugly bulbous shapes in the sky.

I saw Raj and Jordan had already arrived. Their car doors were open and there was a trail of ghost hunting camera equipment going into the ajar front door. From inside I could hear them moving around.

The house was located out in the suburbs. It was very plain to look at. The small patch of grass outside was brown and dry, and the facade needed a new coat of paint. Looked to be twenty years old.

I poked my head in and saw a girl seated on a couch flipping through her phone. She had bright purple wavy hair and wore a tight fitting leather outfit. She looked up at me with her bright pink contact lenses and flashed me a smile. Certainly looked like a Satanist friend Aleesha would hang out with. But she was also kinda hot.

“Hi!” she greeted me. “You must be, Andy. Welcome to my home. Name's [Ella](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEmptySpaces/comments/15b10mh/my_ex_left_her_reflection_behind/).” She grabbed my hand to shake it. I had an odd cognition that her fingers and hands were too smooth?

“Come on in,” she said. “Let me give you the tour before I leave for the night.”

“You’re not staying?” I asked.

“Oh, no,” she said laughing, “best to let you all experience the frights for yourself. As unlucky last, this here is going to be your bed.” She waved her hand at the long sofa in the living room. “Your friends get the guest room upstairs.”

“Eh, I’ll survive,” I said, putting down my overnight bag by the couch.

“Come on round then. It’s not too big a place. Back here’s the kitchen, you’re welcome to anything in the fridge or pantry. This is the [basement](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEmptySpaces/comments/157boqf/theres_something_in_my_basement/) door. Most haunted place in the house usually. That’s where she lives.”

“She?”

“Oh yes,” Ella replied with a wicked grin and glancing at me sideways.

“You're welcome to go down and say hi if you have the balls. But even if you don't, she’ll likely come up to visit at some point of time during the night. When she does I'd advise you to go upstairs. I don't think she goes upstairs. Or just make a new friend, right? I'm sure she's lonely. But she's never wanted to talk to me,” Ella ended giving a mock pout.

“Right…”

Ella laughed jovially, “You’re a tough one. I like you. You don’t believe in ghosts anyway, do you? Aleesha told me so. Come on upstairs.”

She led me up the stairs that were by the kitchen entrance. I saw Raj and Jordan fussing over a mess of equipment on the floor in a room. Jordan waved hi at me.

“This here is the guest bedroom your friends are in. And back over there is the spare bathroom. And to the front there is my bedroom. I’ve locked it and I hope I can trust you all to respect my privacy.”

“Sure, no problem,” I replied.

“Okay, then. Good luck guys,” our host said. Raj and Jordan yelled out their thanks and goodbyes. I followed Ella out to the front door where her bag was. She slung it over her shoulder and walked over to her car in the garage.

“Is Aleesha going to show up tonight?” I asked her before she got in. “She didn’t say.”

“Oh I’m pretty certain she’ll show up at some point,” Ella said smiling and starting up her car. “Alright, yes. One last thing. Told your friends this too. The challenge is you have to stay through the night. There will be a lot of scary things going down. But when morning comes you're all safe.

If it really really gets too much, just go. No judgement. But you look like a boy who knows how to handle himself.”

Was that a flirt? I decided it was now or never. “Hey, think I could get your number some time?”

She looked at me with a surprised smile and glinting pink eyes. Then she laughed and said, “Tell you what, tough boy. If you're still here when I get back in the morning I'll give you my number.”

She backed out of her driveway into the road and stopped. “And hey,” she yelled, “Don't go into my room. That's the only real rule.”

With that and a wink she revved off.

It started to drizzle.

I looked up at the sky. It felt like the start of a high school essay. It was a dark and stormy night… and three idiots were staying overnight in a stranger’s house looking for ghosts.

Lightning flashed in the distance, and for a moment I had a strange vision. Across the road was a small park with a few stunted trees in it. One of those trees in the lightning flash had appeared to be a very large hand sticking up from the ground. And on the tip of the forefinger I had seen Aleesha’s face smiling at me.

Then the vision was gone.

I stared into the growing gloom. I couldn’t make out anything as the low peal of the lightning’s thunder caught up and rumbled over the house. I glanced to my side and saw one of Raj and Jordan’s torches conveniently nearby. I grabbed it and shone it back into the darkness where the trees were.

Just some twisted trees.

I sniggered at myself. Could it be that I was getting spooked? My society would be disappointed at my lack of rational reasoning.

A burst of static made me jump and spin around. It was just Raj testing out his EVP machine. I sighed deeply. I hated those things.

Shaking my head, I shut the front door.

The air was humid and I was sticky from the day. So I thought perhaps I’d have a shower before ordering some pizza for dinner.

The shower was good. Nice pressure and hot. I stepped out and dried myself and went over to the mirror. It had steamed up and I was just about to wipe it to see my reflection when I saw the writing on the mirror. For a second I thought it was written in some foreign language. But instead it was only written in reverse:

“[1 for yes. 2 for no](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEmptySpaces/comments/154mun3/knocks/).”

I chuckled. Now this was some elaborate pranking. I was pretty sure no one had crept into the bathroom while I was showering to write that on the mirror. But it could be someone had written that on the mirror beforehand so that when the steam condensed the writing would be revealed. Satisfied with my rationalisation, I wiped the condensation off the mirror, but the writing would not come off. I looked closely at it and it seemed the steam and writing was on the other side of the mirror glass. Eventually the steam on that side faded and so did the writing. Weird. I thought about testing whether the writing would reappear with more steam. Or perhaps the mirror could be lifted?

Just as I placed my fingers under the mirror to see if I could pry it from the wall, two wooden creaks sounded from above my head and I smiled to myself in response.

Two for no eh? Well better listen to the mysterious writing then. See how spooky Aleesha really made this house.

Thunder came from outside. The storm was truly helping the atmosphere.

Looking around, Raj and Jordan appeared to have sorted out their equipment. I poked my head round the guest bedroom espying Jordan there.

“Pizza?” I asked.

“Way ahead of you, man. Already ordered. You owe us fifteen,” Jordan said.

“All good,” I said, giving him a thumbs up.

I walked down the stairs and there was a knocking on the front door. Was the pizza already here?

“Chloe?” I asked in surprise when I opened the door.

She stood there with her hair slightly damp and frizzled from the rain.

“Look,” she said holding up a hand, “I’m not here to stay and I’m here against the advice of my pastor.”

“Okay…”

“Could you please not stay overnight here?”

I gave her an incredulous look. “You came all the way here to ask us not to stay overnight?”

“Yes,” she said, sounding flustered, “I… I really like you. And I know you don’t like me. And that you will never like me. But I don’t want to see you get hurt.”

I honestly did not know how to respond to this sudden confession of affection. But she was right. I did not find Chloe attractive at all.

“Woah, woah, wooooaah…” I said, holding my hands up. “Let’s just calm down a bit, hey? It’s just a house alright. You don’t believe in Aleesha’s stuff and neither do I. It’s going to be a boring night and by tomorrow morning I’ll be laughing about it.”

Chloe nodded glumly. “Please?”

I actually considered it for a moment. But then remembered purple hair girl's phone number was on the on the line too now. “Nah, I'm good.”

“I’ll be praying for you," Chloe said.

Then she hurriedly took off into the rain as fast as her legs could take her back to her car. The rain was heavy now and I could only just make out the silhouette of her car at the main road and the beams of her headlights as it came on. They drove off into the night.

Two knocks sounded from the wood overhead. I sighed irritably. I was letting the house get to me. But it sounded like I should not have let Chloe drive off. Still what was I supposed to do?

As Chloe's car drove off a motorcycle came to take her place. It was the pizza delivery guy.

Raj, Jordan, and myself sat around the living room eating our pizza. I shared a six pack I had brought with them.

Raj explained to me the setup they had. The main attraction of the house was the shadow girl who lived in the basement. They had set up cameras in the kitchen trained at the door, both night vision and infrared. There were three other cameras. One viewing the kitchen from another angle, another viewing the hall and the front door, and one panning the exterior of the house. They asked me if I was cool being in the footage while I slept. I told them I didn’t mind.

After the pizza Raj and Jordan decided they would go back up to their room to view their cameras. I decided I did not want to be a third wheel and would just stay downstairs.

They left and very quickly the boredom set in.

I was scrolling my phone and social media for about an hour on the sofa.

“Knock, knock”

I jumped out of my chair in surprise. There in the window was a face with white teeth laughing in a strange mechanical way.

“Leesh? What the fuck?”

Rain had drenched her hair and while I couldn’t see much of her through the black pane, the skin on her face gleamed from the inside light.

“Enjoying yourselves?”

“Yeah. Uhh… you want to come inside?”

“Oh yes, we would love to. Could you open the door for us?”

“We?”

Chloe’s face popped up into view. She looked unwell and her head was at an angle. Her wet hair was strewn limply across her face

“Met her on the way here,” Aleesha explained. “Car had broken down.”

Chloe’s face made odd jerky movements as if to nod.

“Let us in.”

Then both their heads slid out of view towards the front door.

I stood up to get the door. Just as I put my hand on the handle two very loud creaks sounded from inside the house. I turned my head looking for where the sounds had come from. Two for no?

There was a screaming and commotion upstairs. I turned around to see Raj and Jordan tearing down the stairs. They jumped on me and dragged me back up the stairs. I was yelling but too shocked to put up much of a resistance.

They threw me into the guest room and slammed the door shut and locked it.

“What the fuck guys? Aleesha and Chloe are out there.”

Jordan looked at me. His face was an ashen grey and his eyes were wide. Raj stood to the side, hands on his knees and panting.

“That wasn’t Chloe or Aleesha,” Raj said between his breaths.

“What?”

“They - they looked like worms,” Jordan stammered.

“What the hell are you guys talking about?”

“Giant worms,” Jordan repeated, “with human faces. Aleesha and Chloe’s faces. And- and one more. Saw them on camera.”

I frowned trying to understand. A single knock sounded from somewhere in the room.

One for yes? Yes, there were giant worms with human faces trying to get me to let them in? Yes, I am seriously entertaining the notion a ghost is communicating with me through knocks on wood?

“Alright, alright,” I said standing up laughing, “Didn’t think you guys would all seriously get together to try to pull off such a prank on me. But you’re going to have to do a lot better than human faced worms to make me believe in the supernatural.”

Just at that moment there was a flash of lightning and the lights went out.

I could hear Jordan cursing away in the darkness. A couple of moments later he had switched on a flashlight. It darted over to me then over to Raj. Raj was staring at his laptop screen. I flipped the light switch beside me up and down but nothing happened. Then I realised the laptop was still working because it was battery operated.

Apparently the rest of the cameras were too. Raj was pointing at something on screen to Jordan.

Reluctantly I went over to look at the screens. The basement door was now wide open. The night vision camera showed nothing but an old dusty staircase heading downwards into gloom. But something started happening on the infrared camera. A cold spot was rising up from the stairs.

The blob took on a somewhat humanoid shape. A little girl? Then it moved off camera.

We all stared at the camera that was looking into the kitchen from another angle. That’s where the shape would have moved into from the first camera. It wasn't infrared so we couldn't tell where the cold spot was. The kitchen simply appeared empty.

There was nothing. Lightning flared upon the windows. I was expecting to see Aleehsa and Chloe’s heads against the window panes peering in. But the windows were blank.

Then slowly, the cupboard beneath the sink opened up by itself.

Despite the insanity of the situation, I couldn’t help the thought crossing my mind that the cupboard could have been opened with just some string by someone off camera. This must have been a prank cooked up by Aleesha. But how has she gotten the other three to play along?  Particularly Chloe?

“Hey, boys,” a metallic rasp came from the window.

We all stared Aleesha staring at us from the window.

“Aren't you going to let me in?”

Jordan gave a whimper, Raj just stared with his mouth agape. And I felt something in me take over.

“Aleesha!,” I heard my voice say, “Get down from there at once. You’re on the first floor and it’s raining. You’re going to slip, fall, and get hurt.”

Aleesha laughed and laughed, her head throwing itself back. Chloe’s face also came into view a little lower and to the right of Aleesha. It had a stupid look to it and her laughter was some sort of weird gurgle.

A third face suddenly slammed itself into the window pane right beside Aleesha. It was the pizza delivery person.

Another smash against the window and there was a crack in the glass. The delivery guy’s nose appeared to be bleeding and broken. There was a flash of lightning and the three people outside were silhouetted by it. They weren’t human faces on worms. They were heads on fingers, connected to a hand as large as a tree.

And then they were gone with the lightning flash.

Raj and Jordan were both crying now and unmoving. I was blinking like an Owl, trying to understand what I had just seen.

“We, we gotta go,” I heard Jordan say weakly.

I turned to look at him. He did look a blubbering mess

“WE’VE GOT TO GO!” he roared, grabbing Raj by the shoulders. “She said we could leave right? Let's get out of here. I don't know what the fuck that thing was but I'm not staying the night.

I tried to intervene but Jordan had kicked open the door and dragged Raj out through it. I groaned and had the sense to grab a torch following the two into the dark corridor. Well, this was more exciting than the other ghost hunting expeditions. I really would have to get Aleesha to tell me how she was achieving all these special effects.

We all stumbled into the landing and I swung my torch around back and forth. I’m about to lead us all down the stairs when two knocks come from overhead.

I pause for a moment. The night air was cold and clammy. But the air from the stairs was freezing. I shone the torch down the stairs and long shadows darted everywhere. Dust motes floated serenely in the light ignorant of the storm overhead. But although I could not see anything, I could feel something.

Something was waiting there in the darkness, daring us to trespass its territory.

Jordan gasped, “Wh… what… we… we need to get out of here.” But he did not get any closer to the stairs either.

This was the moment of truth. Did I believe in ghosts?

I decided not to venture down the stairs. I am not sure why but I didn’t go into the bathroom either. Instead I decided to try the master bedroom. I tried the handle and was surprised to find it was unlocked.

It was bare.

There was no bed. No furniture of any kind. And the closets were empty. A thin layer of dust lay over the carpet. The windows had their curtains drawn. There was a lock on the door but it could only be locked from inside.

Raj and Jordan shambled in after me like the walking dead. Jordan stared blankly at the stairs as he shut the door. Raj sank to the floor against a wall. Jordan took his place beside him.

This room felt strangely safe? Maybe Ella didn't want this part of the house to be involved in the ruse.

But why not? There really was not a thing in here. On the near wall was a door to an ensuite bathroom. Slowly I made over and peered in. The flashlight’s beam was reflected back at me by a mirror spanning the length of the wall.

And suddenly it wasn’t just the flashlight that was bright.

There was light coming from the mirror. In the mirror, where there should have been a reflection of me looking back from the open door, instead the reflection's door was partially closed and a hand had come through the door and flicked on the bathroom light. The mirror door opened and there stood a skinny bespectacled dude where I should have been.

He held up his hands as if to say he meant no harm, then dragged a stool into the reflection’s bathroom and sat upon it.

A knock sounded from over my head.

“Wh-what? Who the-? What the fuck is going on?” I heard Raj from behind me.

All three of us gathered into the bathroom, giving audience to the mirror.

“Hi,” the guy said solemnly.

“This is… this is some trick. Is this a screen? Or a two way mirror?” I said touching the glass surface.

The guy in the mirror shook his head. “I'm sorry. It's not. My name is Josh. And this is going to sound insane. But I need to start by saying I’m sorry. I didn’t know it would turn out this way.”

Raj came closer to the mirror. “Are… are you in the mirror?”

Josh grimaced. “I guess so. I’m Josh from a mirror world. I don’t know what happened to the Josh in your world. I don’t think I want to know.”

“I don’t understand.”

The skinny dude gave a sigh and adjusted his glasses.

“You've ran into the Hand?”

Raj, Jordan, and I looked at each other.

“Uhm… big hand with the heads of our friends on its fingers?” Raj said.

Josh nodded grimly.

“You guys seen the Basement Thing, yet?”

“Yeah. Just now.”

“Okay, then. Listen to me very carefully.

The Hand can't get into the house unless it's invited in. I don't know why. It just doesn't. I don't know what it is. I don't know where it comes from. But every new moon it hunts anyone who comes to this place.

As long as no one invites it in, you're safe. But if someone should invite it in, you need to find the tunnel.”

“Tunnel?”

“Yes. Tunnel. The basement thing, did you see if she interacted with anything?”

“Yeah… yeah,” Jordan said. “Kitchen sink drawers.”

Josh winced.

“That'd be right. If you look there you will find a black tunnel. It’s the only safe place from the Hand if it gets in to the house. If you go into that tunnel, only go as far as you need for safety. Don’t explore it. Wait to hear a knock from the house. It usually sounds like someone rapping on wood. Only come out if you hear a knock. One knock, not two.”

“Wh-why can't we just drive off?” Jordan asked haggard,  “The girl we met here said we could just leave.”

Josh gained an angry look. “Don't trust anything she told you. Anyone who comes to this house on a new moon night is marked. The Hand will hunt you wherever you go.”

“How do you know all this?” Raj asked.

“Again, I'm sorry. I was caught in a bad place. I made a deal with a devil. Maybe [The Devil](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEmptySpaces/comments/15gq7kk/a_passageway_opens_up_in_my_house_at_night/). In exchange for my life, I took his book and passed it to the mirror demon. She's the purple haired girl you met. I didn't know it would release her into your world.”

The lights in the mirror flickered.

“I don't have much longer to speak to you guys. Don't invite the Hand in. Go into the tunnel if you need to. Don't explore it. The Devil waits inside. Wait for the knock.

And please. If you find the book, burn it. I'm so sorry.”

Then the mirror went dark and the three of us were staring at our own reflections.

My incredulity kicked back in. Turning to Raj and Jordan I said, “Look, I don't know if you guys are in on this whole charade. My guess is you must be. That is some real cool makeup and special effects you guys needed to pour into making that Hand thing. Those film study classes at uni are really paying off guys. But all we got to do is not invite the freaky hand puppet thing in till morning eh?”

Raj and Jordan looked at each other.

“Y-you still think this is a prank?” Raj spluttered.

“Sorry dude. But I don't believe in ghosts.”

Raj looked like he was about to hit me when Jordan shushed both of us. He indicated we should listen.

There past the sounds of the rain, I could hear a car engine. Someone had come to the house?

Cautiously Jordan opened the bedroom door. It was still dark outside in the landing but the chilly air from the stairs was no longer present. The three of us tiptoed out and by the light of the torch made our way downstairs just to hear the front door open.

“Hey boys,” came the voice from a silhouette in the door frame.

“Ella?” I asked.

“Told you about not entering my room, didnt I?” I couldn't make out her features in the dark, but we could see her wagging her finger at us.

“Oh well. You break one rule. I break one rule. Oh, Handeee…,” Ella called out into the night behind her. There was an odd shuffling noise and disturbing shadows approached the door frame.

“Come on in.”

A long tubular shape with long hair attached to it, jutted from round the door frame looking at us. Ella stepped aside with a welcoming wave in to it. The other fingers joined it. Chloe's face upon the thumb, Aleesha on the index and the delivery guy on the middle. It was truly surreal watching the giant grey hand reach in through the door, the vacant faces of its first three fingers smiling eagerly and hungrily.

I had the wind knocked out of me as Raj pushed me into the kitchen. Raj, Jordan and I turned into a jumble of limbs hurtling towards the kitchen sink.

I got shoved into a small black hole in the wall under the sink. Raj was in too, practically on top of me. We both wriggled further in and I couldn't tell if Jordan was in because Raj was in the way. But there was this awful shriek and scuffle, a sudden “whoomph” like heavy curtains closing and it went properly dark in there.

Raj was screaming incoherently and kicking furiously against a wall. It dawned upon me there were only two of us in that tunnel and Raj was kicking a wall where the entrance had been.

He kept screaming Jordan’s name over and over for a good few minutes.

Further in, the tunnel increased in height letting me half stand. But I sat back on the floor, feet pressed against the opposing wall heedless of Raj’s agony. I felt sick and exhausted. And I think I fainted.

When I came to, I was alone in the dark. I called out for Raj but got no response.

On my hands and knees I started to feel my way around. By feeling the walls I made a guess as to which one the entrance had been at. It was still solid. Then I slowly felt my way down the passage. The tunnel ceiling was never high enough for me to stand up straight so I found myself crawling most of the time. I kept thinking I would bump my head against a wall. It was pitch black and it was all I could do not to piss myself. I do not recall being afraid of the dark. I guessed my genetic primordial memory was kicking in as much as my rational mind kept telling itself there must be a good explanation to everything that had happened tonight.

What was this place? We had entered the wall of the house right? Had we gone under the house? I had not noted any elevation changes but that was the only thing that would have made sense. Otherwise I should be on the outside of the house.

Somewhere along the corridor I felt a strange lump of dusty fabric that I instinctively recoiled from. And then I saw a faint light I recognised as torchlight. Raj!

I shuffled down the tunnel faster and entered a hall. The first thing that hit me was the smell of shit.

The torchlight was cast upon an empty wooden chair. It looked ornate with a high back. There was a nasty black stain on it as if something had rotted on it. The stain glistened slime like. There were distinct footprints in the dust upon the ground that led to an opening on the opposite side of the room.

Raj was kneeling before the empty chair, prostate and naked. He had soiled himself and was mumbling incoherently. Slowly I approached and picked up the torch beside him.

I don’t know why but I didn’t say a word. My brain had finally gone numb trying to understand things and was oddly quiet.

I grabbed Raj from under an armpit and somehow managed to drag him back into the tunnel. We passed by a disturbing lump of cloth I must have touched earlier. Struggling with Raj’s weight, and trying to hold on to the torch I incredibly made it back to where we had started. There, I dropped him on to the floor and sat myself back down trying to catch my breath. The stink of faeces was unbearable but I did not want to go any closer to the hall with the chair in it. I turned off my light to conserve battery.

I don’t know how long we waited there in the dark. It could have been minutes. It could have been hours. But suddenly, I became aware of the opening in the wall again. I could make out the kitchen.

There was orange sunlight coming in through a window lighting it up. I could hear the dawn birdsong coming from a distance and the cherrywood furniture were warm and welcome.

“Morning!” I heard Raj gasp. He got to his knees and stared to stiffly crawl for the exit.

“Morning, we're safe!” he spluttered crying.

That's when I heard two knocks of wood. I was going to grab Raj by the heel but it was too late. A giant grey finger with Jordan's head on it reached down into view. It's mouth was open impossibly wide and clamped down into Raj’s neck with a sickening crunch.

Screaming, Raj was dragged out of the tunnel and up out of view. There was the horrible sound of a pulpy fruit being squashed. And then nothing.

I stared at the tunnel entrance for a long time barely daring to breathe. When I made the slightest movement towards it, I heard two sharp raps. I froze in place.

A bizarre shadow blotted out the sunlight in the kitchen and very slowly five faces lowered into view, upside down. Raj’s face was on the pinkie, eyes rolling and tongue lolling out. The other faces looked at me with insane stares and wide smiles.

Aleesha spoke, “Seems that we've covered all five fingers. Lucky you.” And then they withdrew like snakes and the Hand I guess must have been coming in through the kitchen window, must have slithered out.

The morning returned to the kitchen eventually, and I could hear birdsong again. I didn't move till I heard a single knock from somewhere in the house.

Gingerly I got out of the tunnel. When I looked back the tunnel was gone.

The house appeared orderly and empty. I walked silently to the living room where my overnight bag sat beside the couch as if nothing had happened. I grabbed it and exited the front door.

I was just about to reach my car when I heard slow clapping from behind me. Ella was standing in the open door of her garage smiling sweetly.

“Andy, you made it,” she said in a girly voice. I backed up against my car, my skin covered in goosebumps. She came in close enough for me to realise she smelled like unscented candle wax. She pressed a piece of paper to my chest.

“My number. Just as I promised.”

“Uhh… yeah. Thanks,” I mumbled, then pathetically, I scrambled into my car taking in deep, sobbing breaths and sped off. Ella watched me go hands on her hips and still smiling.

I've been trying to tell myself it's all been some sort of nightmare. A hallucination. I've pored over the scenes again and again. But many defy any explanation.

I haven't seen the others all week at college. I haven't dared go to the police. I haven't dared tell anyone. I keep telling myself it was all a very, very elaborate prank and they'd show up one evening, laughing. And I'd laugh too and tell them, "Good one. "

But they haven't turned up.

Instead I just got a text this evening. It was from Ella. I didn't save her number, but I just knew it was from her.

It reads, “Your friends say they got rid of the pizza guy's head so there's room for you now. They say the Midnight Minutes have been summoned.”

There's a soft thudding from my window and I dare not turn around.
