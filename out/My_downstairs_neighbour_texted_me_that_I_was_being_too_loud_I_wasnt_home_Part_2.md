After the sock fell on my head, I held it tightly in my hand and noped the fuck out of my apartment. And I don’t mean just my suite, I mean my entire building. I kept running until I had crossed the road and made it to the grassy field. I sat down in the grass, mind racing, and examined the sock. Inside was more of the mysterious goo that I had found on my bed and couch. I ditched the sock on the grass and scrambled for my cell phone. My next call was to my landlord.

“Hello?” he said in a raspy voice.

“Hey,” I said, “I’m from suite 412. Something has happened in there while I was gone.”

“Like what?” he asked, his tone suggesting that he didn’t actually really care.

“Can you please come check it out?”

“Are you home now?”

“Uh, not technically,” I told him, “but I can get there pretty quickly. Meet me out front?”

“Sure, I’ll leave in a few.”

The landlord who looked after my apartment building didn’t live there with his tenants. As far as I knew, he actually owned his own house with his wife and family. I didn’t have the slightest clue where his house was located so I had no idea how long it would take him to get there. While I waited, I sat on the steps leading to the building’s front door. I didn’t dare go in alone.

When he arrived, about fifteen minutes had passed. He followed me up to the fourth floor and we went into my suite, which I hadn’t bothered to lock on my way out.

“There’s knives and goo,” I told him, “and someone has been rummaging around in my stuff.”

The first thing he did was walk up to the knives in the wall. He looked at the portrait which had been obviously drawn over.

“Nice family,” he said. I had no response.

Then, he pulled one of the knives out from the wall and I led him over to the goo in the living area. Using the blade of the knife, he carefully poked at the weird goo. He then sort of spread it around a bit and after a while of that, he touched it with his pointer finger. He raised his finger up to his eyes, only half an inch away from his thick glasses, and examined. Then, he tasted it.

“Mhhmm,” he said, “what else?”

“My bathroom and bedroom,” I said, “there’s more of that stuff on my bed plus someone went through my sock drawer, and, um, the bathroom sink is plugged with a sock.”

“Show me,” he instructed.

I took him into the bathroom. Without a moment of hesitation, he pulled the sock out from the sink and drained the remainder of the water. He turned the tap on and helped himself to my hand soap and washed the goo off of his finger.

I showed him the socks in the toilet. I showed him my bedroom.  I pointed out the goo on my bed and the sock drawer that looked disastrous.

“You shouldn’t stay here tonight,” he said. Yeah, tell me something I don’t know.

I called my friend, crying. She had just dropped me off not even a half hour ago and here I was, begging for her to come back. I wanted to be anywhere else but home.

My landlord put some yellow and black ‘caution’ tape over my door and promised that “the authorities” would look into it. I told him to call me with any news.

Two days later, he hadn’t called. One week later, he still hadn’t called. A week and a half later, still I waited to hear from him. I had called him numerous times but was unable to get through to him. Each call went straight to his voicemail, like either his phone was off or he just wouldn’t answer. At that point, I had been away from home for quite some time and though I was grateful my friend allowed me to stay with her, I was getting tired of mooching. All I had with me that was my own was my cellphone and the outfit I had been wearing that day. I missed my stuff. I wanted to cook in the kitchen with my own dishware. I wanted to sleep between my own sheets. I wanted to use the TV remote that I was familiar with. It all seemed like the most mundane stuff, but I wanted to go home. I decided the next best option was to go visit the apartment building in person and see if maybe I could catch him.

The following day, I borrowed my friend’s cruiser bike and rode over to my apartment. I perused the street for a while. Nothing exciting was happening. No neighbours out on their balconies and no sign of my landlord. But, I wasn’t ready to give up just that quickly. I ditched the bike underneath the giant oak tree in the front and walked around back.

At first glance, it seemed again that no neighbours were outside or on their balconies on the south side of the building either.

\*CLONK\*

The noise startled me and made me jump. I spun around a half circle to investigate the sound.

The shed.

On the south side of the apartment, right next to the back alley, there was a wooden shed where my landlord kept all his gardening supplies or snow removal gear, obviously depending on the season. One thing I knew about the shed is that it didn’t have a proper door. He kept it shut using a metal chain which he secured with a locked padlock. The sound had been the chain. So, either someone had just gone in or someone had just come out. There were no signs of anyone near the shed walking away which confirmed to me that no one had come out. They couldn’t come out and just disappear into thin air. Someone had just gone in.

I was desperate for some help. I approached the shed and every cell in my body screamed at me \*don’t do it!\* but I trooped on. My throat had become suddenly dry and my chest felt heavy. Once I reached the shed, I peeked through the slits in the old wooden wall. The gaps were just wide enough that if I stood with my face directly on the shed siding, I could take a look inside.

Inside was my landlord, my downstairs neighbour, and a few other tenants I recognized from the property. There were an abundance of paint cans which were filled with something that didn’t look quite like paint.

Oh my god. It was the goo.

My downstairs neighbour dipped her hand into one of the cans. She brought her hand to her face and sniffed like a hound dog. Then, she held her hand out in front of her and everyone else in the shed proceeded to lick the goo off her fingers.

Nope nope nope. Fuck that. I’m out.

I got back on that cruiser bike and high tailed it out of there. I got back to my friend’s house and tore the front door open, then immediately shut and locked it.

“What happened? What’s wrong with you?” my friend asked, concerned at my state.

“I don’t know. I really don’t know. But I’m not going back.”

Reassuringly she reached out to me and grabbed me gently by the shoulders. She led me to the couch and sat me down, where I collapsed into a weeping mess.

“Just try to calm down, I’ll go make you some tea and get some bandaids and polysporin for the blisters on your feet.”

The blisters on my feet? What?

I had been biking that day but I was wearing thick socks and pretty typical Vans skater shoes. I brought my left foot up onto the couch to see the blisters she was talking about.

I was no longer wearing socks. I had no memory of ever taking them off. I hadn’t even taken my shoes off. My Achilles tendon was raw from the shoe rubbing against the bare skin.

I ordered a team of professional movers to empty my apartment. I found a new place to rent downtown. Once I got semi set up in my new place, I began to unpack. I checked every box and couldn’t find a single sock in any of them.
