“Sir, I’ve been nothing but a good worker!” I said to my boss.

“I don’t give a flying fart!  You see that pile of trash all the way up there?” My boss said, pointing to the mountain of medical waste large enough to rival Pike’s Peak.  I swore I could have seen steam spray from his ears if I stared at him long enough.  “You are to clean up that ENTIRE pile of filth properly by the end of the day, or so help me, you’re getting the boot!”

I held my hands out defensively.  “That’s impossible!  Take your anger out on the lazy workers!  They were responsible for cleaning it up.  Besides, you’ve been discriminating against me ever since I started!  Cut me some slack!”

My hotheaded boss slams his hands on his desk.  “Do you want to get fired?”

Catching his drift, I lowered my head.  “No sir.  If you want me to figure something out, I’ll figure it out.”

I turned away from his mahogany office and headed past the broken plaster hallways with my tail tucked between my legs.

Me, I always wanted to help out the less fortunate.

Unfortunately, most of those people didn’t seem to like my help.  All of the staff at that stupid hillbilly hospital seemed to have I.Q levels in the negative digits.  I’d even say getting admitted to such a poorly run place was a worse fate than contracting the plague.

Not far from the rear parking lot was the pile, casting a shadow as large as Mount Rushmore.  Nitrile gloves, discarded colostomy bags, needles in containers, removed tumors with knotted vessels still attached, and piles of stringy clots stood high and mighty out in the baking sun.  Steam lines rose off from it at various spots, distorting sunlight.  The only thing that was missing was a flag that said “Kilroy was here” on the summit.

Upon smelling the heap, I plugged my nose and waved my hand away to disperse the smell.  I put on my hazmat suit and prepared to scoop up the first pile of waste.  With the grace of a lobotomized cat, I took the lump of plastic and bodily fluids, holding my breath so I would not puke over my visor.  I loaded it up into one of the cinnabar biohazard bins, turning my nose away from the putrid smell of feces, urine and blood.

There was no way in hell I could possibly load all this biowaste to the dump in one sitting, even with a forklift and garbage truck.  

There had to be another solution to this conundrum.  

I kicked the outside of the building in frustration.  If I was fired, I wouldn’t have any place else to work that paid as high.  My wife already had plenty of problems to deal with.  She already had a child along the way.  The last thing she needed was to fall on hard times.  Unless if the stars all aligned in my favor, I was done for.

Then, by sheer chance, my gaze focused on a book tossed by a dumpster.  Surprisingly, outside from a patch of slime on top, it was in rather good condition.  

Why would someone discard something in such good condition?

“Maybe a quick reading break will help clear my mind.”

I picked up its black leather cover, brushed my finger across its warm, sunbaked surface and cleaned off the gray muck covering the front.  Its front and back were stitched around the edges with crimson thread.  The stitching made it look ancient enough to be part of the Library of Alexandria.

Strangely, it was missing a title and an author on its cover.    As I flipped through the pages, hundreds of alchemic symbols and summoning circles were drawn on it in black ink.

I looked at the mountain of trash and scoffed.  My break had to end soon.  I needed the money.  It wasn’t easy dealing with one boss, but if I had to deal with an angry landlord at the same time, I’d have gone off the deep end.  Flipping through the pages, I came to a stop when the title of one of the pages caught my eye.

TELEPORTATION SPELL

I double blinked when I read those words.  

“Black magic isn’t real…Is it not?” I thought.  But since time was running out, I might as well give even the most unorthodox idea a try.

Maybe there was a way to get rid of this trash in an easy way, afterall.  I scanned my finger through the instructions, gathering the materials.  Right as I was about to pick up a discarded IV bag for the required blood sample, I paused.  

Should really go through with this?  I reread everything again, making sure I didn’t misinterpret anything. 

The spell simply said its used for teleporting objects to desired locations.  All I needed was blood for drawing the symbol.  I shrugged.  If it was the only way that I was able to keep my job, then I had no other options.

I took out the warm pile of blood from the IV and dipped my fingers in it.  Pressing my digits against the blistering pavement, I drew a circle around a meter wide followed by another towards the middle.  A vivid picture of a medical waste landfill shone in my mind’s eye.

Next, I placed my hand right in the center of the circle and said the required words for the spell.  

Right as I was about to say the last word, I slipped up.  “Dammit…”  I heard something clatter against the pavement and heard some of the trash settle a bit.  I opened up my eyes, wondering what the commotion was.  The pile of trash seemed to shrink ever so slightly.

When I couldn’t find an answer, I shrugged and removed the previous spell circle, replacing it with a new one, this time following the words to a T, shielding my eyes.

I gasped when mystic blue light penetrated my eyelids and shone brighter than a supernova.  The sound of crackling energy and whirling and churning wind spawned while the spell did its work.  Then, like a smoke cloud in a gale, the light had vanished.

Slowly uncovering my eyes, I started to laugh when I saw the result.  Just like that, the mountain of trash was no more.

The spell worked!  I ran over to where the pile once was and examined it for any extra trash with a smug grin on my face.  

My joy diminished slightly when I saw that there was still some trash left.

I didn’t think the spell would work AT ALL, so why was I so shocked when I saw that it wasn’t foolproof?  There were still bits of metal and glass from syringes and an occasional colostomy bag, which I disposed of without much problem.

Then came the last fragment of trash: a fragment of the lower part of a fetus.  I gagged at its horrid sight.  Most of its body was smooth as pudding and covered in swarms of loud, ebony flies.  Maggots begun to burrow into it, feasting on the fat and muscle.  By the pelvis, strands of intestines coiled around a single vertebra.  It still had its spinal cord imbedded inside and wove with the entrails to form some kind of sloppy, meaty crown. 

“Abortion remains?” I wondered, holding my breath away from the carrion. For a moment, I thought all of the trashes stink came from that one dead fetus.  The hospital policy was that stillborn babies and lifesaving abortions were to be given to the family of concern.  This would allow them to give them a proper funeral if desired.  What would something like this be doing in a trash heap?

Right before I could gather the remains, the pelvis began slithering around on its own and growling in a rage.  Its entrails dragged along behind and roasted on the pavement.  I put my hand back in bewilderment.

Quickly, I held whatever the hell that thing was out in front, and unceremoniously dropped it in the biohazard dumpster and sent the rest of the trash over to the landfill.  When I got back, I faced one of the hanging security cameras and stood with a thousand yard stare, pointing at what I just found in the biohazard trash.  

Could this have been one of the effects of saying the spell incorrectly that first time?  Not wanting to stay another minute at work, there could have been more of those abominations, I clocked out with one of those old-fashioned punch devices.

\---

Right as I entered my car, the stench of brine and iron punched my sinuses.  In the back seat, there were bits of needles across the upholstery, puncturing it and spilling puce fluid everywhere.  

And in the back, there was another worm-eaten fetus.  This time, it was a leg, pulsing around and moving like a caterpillar and flopping around the trash.  Alarmed, I took a nearby trash bag, stuffing the flotsam and jetsam inside.  Right as I took the leg to dispose of it, it thrashed around like an angry leash, moving and snapping in impossible ways.  The lower half of the leg, near the hip, fangs of syringes sticking out.  It went for my throat, puncturing my neck.  I growled in pain, eventually tearing the beast off and throwing it into a passing dump truck.

I clenched my neck, which only had superficial puncture wounds.  “THAT couldn’t have come from an abortion!” I said to myself.  “There had to have been some something wrong with the spell.  It had to have come from the spell!  But where did those parts come from?”

As I drove home, more and more piles of trash flew past me as I drove down the highway.  Their odors were powerful enough to penetrate my car’s windows.  Not even the wind could ventilate it.

Right when I reached a stoplight, I felt a vibration in my pocket.  My phone.

“I’M GOING INTO LABOR! TAKE ME TO THE HOSPITAL!” My wife screamed.  I dropped the phone in my seat, flooring it at full speed and bolting through the highway.

\---

Without turning the car off, I threw open the front door, guiding my wife into the front passenger’s seat.  Though I could only take a glimpse of the interior from outside, everything appeared to be perfectly fine.  No trash could be found.

“Honey? Is everything alright?” I asked, holding my hand out to comfort her.  All she could do was breathe rapidly and heavily, just the way she learned in parenting class.  I backed right out of the driveway, getting right back on the highway.  As I headed straight for my city’s hospital, fat chance I was taking her to the shithouse where I worked, another feral fetus creature crashed against the window.  It pummeled through the windshield and cracking the glass.  My wife and I both screamed.  Without a second thought, I put the car in park, pulling that bastard off and chucking it into a ditch.  It tried to burrow into my chest, leaving a superficial crater of gunk right in the middle.  I took my shirt and wrapped it around my chest before the wound could get any worse.

I noticed that my wife’s belly was bruised up and a nauseating color of purple and green.  When I reached another stoplight, there was something sticking out between her legs.  I asked her permission to investigate, to which she nodded.  Right in her birth canal was a floppy, stretchy object.

A nitrile glove.

I pulled out the mass from her womb, vomiting when I got a whiff of the pulsating, chunky, crimson gunk on it.  Its outside was caked with steaming yellow pus like gravy on a steak.  Black blood slid down from the wrist area down to the fingers. I tossed that thing right out the window like it was a dead rat.  The moment my hand left the car, my wife screamed in agony as glass shards continued to erupt from her belly.

Just by the skin of my teeth, we arrived at the hospital.  I beckoned a nurse to take my wife on a stretcher and bring her to the ER pronto.  Her stomach began to pulsate and undulate.  With each undulation, a slimy green and brown fluid would erupt from the lacerations in her thighs and crotch.  As it ran down her bruised and gangrenous skin, it stained the sheets.  I held my wife’s hand as they transferred her.

“Do you think our baby will be alright?” She asked.

My blood turned to acid.  I didn’t have the heart to tell her that something was terribly wrong.  “Listen, everything is going to be alright.  Just focus on breathing and the professionals will know what to do.  Now, relax.”

Right as the doctor placed her on the clean white sheets on the hospital bed, nurses came flooding like bees around honey.  Immediately, the doctor lifted her shirt from her stomach and wrapped a surgical mask around his mouth.  I could see him wince from his mask even though his teeth were not visible.

Her stomach was now tinted a jadeite green with red, purple and brown.  Glass shards and needles poked out of her stomach like pins in a cushion.  She screamed in agony trying to push out the baby.  The farther out the baby was pushed, the louder the sounds of gushing and splattering resonated through the maternity ward.  

The first thing that came out of her was a mass of nitrile gloves covered in stem cell gunk.  I could see the baby already coming out, headfirst.  Something wasn’t right, though.  Its head was a nauseating purple and it was gnashing and thrashing like a snake the instant its head was exposed to the world.  It turned its head towards the closest nurses, chomping at the air.

Ropy blood clots followed behind the gangrenous baby, reeled behind its arms and back which were malformed from syringes filled with black fluid.  It reached out a glass lacerated hand, scratching at the bed and ripping it apart.  Its broken jaw was held together by dental floss.  And then, I saw that its legs were missing and the spinal cord was just hanging behind the baby like a tail.  I held back vomit as I wondered what happened to my baby's lower half.

“What is that thing?!” The doctor exclaimed.

And then, it hit me.  Our hospital never disposed of stillborn babies.  Then I remembered how I made a mistake on the teleportation spell the first time I tried it.  The fetus creatures that were created consisted of two legs and a pelvis.  The trash heap seemed to shrink a bit afterwards, also.  Finally, trash ended up in my wife’s womb.

Those fetus creatures weren’t from an abortion.  They were from *my baby*. 

The nurses recoiled back at the hideous thing that just crawled out of my wife’s womb.  It stood up on its two remaining limbs and unhinged its jaw like a snake, exposing its onyx black gullet.

It quickly screeched like a hawk as it leapt towards one of the nurses, stabbing her with the needles and gnawing at her neck like a hunting dog with a captured pheasant.  The others tried to pull off the monster that once was my baby, only to come out with deep lacerations on their hands filled with jaundiced pus.  I backed off towards my wife, putting my hand in front of her to protect her.  She put her face in her hands and started sobbing.

The vicious beast calmed down and gave one last shriek at the nurses before it crumpled to the table like a sugar sculpture in water.

I continued to rub my distraught wife’s back while we both stood in reticence at what once was our baby.

\---

Despite all that happened, my wife did eventually recover from that situation.  They put her through hell and high water trying to repair her uterus, remove the remaining garbage in her body, and suck out the infectious gunk.  

Sadly, they couldn’t repair it and we were no longer able to have kids of our own.  My wife and I decided on just sticking with adoption.  And even if we could try again, who knows what horrific things would crawl out of my wife?
