Hello Reddit, call me Cassy. It isn’t my real name, but it seems appropriate, under the circumstances. I will be completely honest with you, since I have no reason not to be. I can see the future. Not all of it, of course, but I get detailed, accurate visions of specific events that haven’t yet occurred. Sounds like it could be useful, right? Unfortunately, all I ever see is tragedy, and I can never do anything to stop it. That’s kind of how it works. No one believes me when I try to tell them, and nothing I do affects the outcome. Trust me, I have tried. It’s a curse, of sorts. Don’t ask me how I got it, it’s a long story. Suffice it to say that there are a lot of powerful beings in the world, and they enjoy meting out punishments. Sometimes because people earned them, sometimes just because they are bored, and it amuses them. They especially like messing with assholes, I think they consider it a personal challenge, to prove they can outdo the biggest dickheads, but what do I know? Anyway, don’t think about them too much, they are usually fans of dramatic irony and if you worry too much about what they might do to you, it significantly increases the odds of them messing with you in some way. Better to stay ignorant. Trust me on that.   
That is why I am not here to talk about them, at least not directly. I am here to tell you about my latest vision. You won’t believe me, of course, but I don’t really care about that. See, what I need is to tell someone or else it kind of sticks in my head like an earworm, replaying over and over when I sleep, until I get it out there. The real problem is, if I keep telling my family and friends then they are going to have me committed. And frankly, that is the most charitable response I get. The people who don’t think I am simply delusional tend to believe that I am causing these tragedies, to prove my precognitive abilities. It's a mess. So, I decided to share here, with you kind internet strangers, and you can all write it off as a made-up story, then hopefully I can get a few weeks of peace before the next vision. Alright, with that out of the way, if you are Melvin Cartwrite, this is how the 7th of November is going to go:  
You wake up in your bed, and you are already irritated. You could have slept for at least 20 more minutes, according to the clock, but a loud bang from the kitchen has disturbed your sleep. You smell bacon cooking and realize your wife must be making breakfast. This doesn’t cheer you up. She knows you don’t like it when she wakes you up early, you’ve talked about this. She should have been more careful. Well, there is no point trying to get back to sleep now, so you roll out of bed with a grunt and dress for work. You have a meeting with your boss today and you aren’t really prepared for it, so you figure you should at least put on a tie, but your lucky tie has a mustard stain on it. You fling it across the room and pick another, but it isn’t as good. You emerge from the bedroom to find your wife plating pancakes in the kitchen. They are shaped like hearts, even though she knows you hate all that mushy garbage. She tries to give you a hug, but you push her away, yelling at her for waking you up early. You roll a pancake up and stuff it in your mouth, then grab two strips of bacon and head for the door. She asks where you are going, aren’t you going to eat breakfast with her? You tell her you have to be at work early, and you’ll probably be home late, too. You grab your gym bag by the door and leave before she can nag at you any further.   
Work drags. Your boss does not approve of your presentation, so you have to make a bunch of changes before you can leave for the day. You know this wouldn’t have happened if you had your favorite tie. By the time you are ready to leave, you are running late and already in a foul mood. You step out of the office and realize it is pouring rain. You curse to yourself. You were supposed to meet the guys for basketball after work, but the court is outdoors, and no one is going to want to play in this weather. You were really looking forward to blowing off some steam, too. You check your phone to find a bunch of missed texts in the group chat, like you thought, the game has been cancelled. You kick your gym bag to the other side of the car in frustration. Now you will have to go home early, and probably fight with Lisa about what happened at breakfast. You aren’t in the mood for that right now. You start your car and drive aimlessly for a while, avoiding going home. You turn down a random street and that is when you spot the bar on the corner. You look at the clock on the dash; it’s only 6pm, time enough for a quick drink to take the edge off, before you brave your wife. You park out front and head inside.   
The next time you notice a clock, it’s 5 minutes after 9. You hadn’t realized you had been here for so long. Now Lisa is only going to be angrier at you, for being late to dinner. Still, you can’t put off leaving forever. You sigh, you had better head home. As you rise, you stagger and have to grab the edge of the bar to steady yourself. Maybe driving isn’t such a good idea, you can’t afford to lose your license again. Of course, you also can’t afford an uber. You decide to call Lisa, after all, she is going to be pissed at you no matter what, so she might as well make herself useful. The phone goes to voicemail the first time, so you call again, twice more before someone finally picks up. It isn’t Lisa, it’s her sister, Dani. She hates you and it doesn’t seem like that has changed any since you last spoke. Before you can even say anything, she launches into a furious tirade, calling you a piece of shit and a pathetic excuse for a husband. Nothing new for her. Still, eventually you realize that she is ranting about the breakfast this morning. She demands to know what kind of husband treats his wife that way on their anniversary. Anniversary. You completely forgot. But really, how can she blame you? You have had a lot on your mind, lately. Still, you figure you can salvage this, you just need to think quickly. You tell Dani to put Lisa on the phone, this is all just a misunderstanding. She doesn’t really believe you, but she puts the phone on speaker, anyway.   
You hear Lisa crying and roll your eyes. She is always so dramatic. You tell her that of course you didn’t forget your anniversary, that is why you are calling her, because she wasn’t home for the special surprise party you had planned. She doesn’t believe you; she asks why you were so mean to her at breakfast, then? That’s easy, you explain that she is hard to surprise, and you were just trying to throw her off the scent, you didn’t think she would take it so hard. You ask her to come home, there is still time for her to join the party. She sniffles through the phone. You can hear Dani telling her not to listen, that you are a loser, and you can hear Lisa hesitate. You can tell that she doesn’t really believe you. So, you up your game; you swear to her, on your life, that you would never lie to her about something like this, that you aren’t that kind of man, that she can trust you, she knows that.   
As you finish your heartfelt pledge, you hear the old man next to you chuckle to himself, before he rises and leaves the bar. You figure that must have reminded him that he has to get back to his own ball-and-chain. You feel Lisa soften, she loves you, she wants to believe that you are better than her sister thinks you are, so she agrees to meet you at home, for the party. You know her sister’s place is about an hour away, so that should give you just enough time to stop by the Walmart, grab a sheet cake and some flowers and call a few of your friends to come over and pretend that was the plan all along. They will cover for you. They always do. You just have to get home before your wife, so you hurry out to the car, your plans to get a ride forgotten.  
You pull onto your street just under an hour later, with a bouquet of daisies and a cake that says: “Happy 6th birthday”. It was the only cake left and the guy who did the writing was already gone for the night, you plan to scrape it off before Lisa gets back. She’ll never even know the difference. As you pull onto the street, swerving slightly wide on the corner, you don’t even see the kid on the bike until you are almost on top of him. You curse him out for riding in the dark, as you swerve violently to the right, losing control of the car. You think must have hit your head, because the next thing you know, your car is in a ditch, hood smashed on a tree. You feel blood dripping down your face, and you wipe it with the sleeve of your coat. The kid with the bike is nowhere to be seen. The little punk didn’t even stick around to see if you survived. Whatever, it doesn’t matter. You can see your house from here, you can still make it. You can worry about how to explain the car to Lisa tomorrow.   
You grab the cake and the flowers from the back of the car and limp to the house. Dani’s car is already in the driveway when you get there, you realize that they must have arrived home while you were unconscious. It might still be fine. Steve was supposed to get her before you anyway, to set the place up. Surely, he made an excuse about where you were. As you move up the walk, you peer in the window to assess the situation and you see Steve and Tommy in the living room, drinking beer. The place looks nice, they did a good job decorating. Surprisingly good, considering the short notice. There are balloons, streamers, even a banner that says: ‘Happy 8th Anniversary’. That was impressive, since even you hadn’t remembered which anniversary this was. You see Lisa walk into the room, she is smiling, happier than you have seen her in years. You are feeling more confident about this plan. Then, you see another man enter the room, he wraps his arms around her and pulls her close, kissing her.   
Shocked, you drop the cake on the driveway, preparing to storm in and confront her, when the man turns around. He has your face. More than your face, he is wearing your favorite tie, but it doesn’t have a mustard stain. You look more closely and see other differences. This man is clean shaven, his hair is a bit shorter than yours, the way Lisa always liked it best, and his shoes are shined like a mirror. He strokes your wife’s hair fondly and pulls out a wrapped box from his pocket. Lisa squeals as she unwraps it, revealing a sapphire pendant, her birthstone. Your friend Steve slaps him on the back, clearly congratulating him on the excellent gift. Your head spins. You don’t know what is going on here. You don’t understand who is in there with your wife. It doesn't make sense. Flinging the flowers to the ground on top of the cake, you march to the door and burst in, demanding an explanation, but everyone in the room just stares at you, not even a flicker of recognition on their faces. Lisa screams and the stranger with your face shoves you out the door, locking it behind you. You pound on the door, but they don’t answer, instead you hear Steve shout that they don’t know who you are or why you are there, but they will call the cops if you don’t leave.   
Unsure of what else to do, you limp back to the car, resting your head on the steering wheel, hoping that maybe this is all just a bad dream, or concussion fueled hallucination. Suddenly, you feel a hand on your shoulder. You look up to see the old man from the bar. Did he follow you here? You ask what he wants, and he says he wants you to understand that this life isn’t yours, not anymore. You don’t know what he means, so he explains: you swore your life on a lie. Thus, your life is forfeit. It belongs to him now, the man with your face. He will make the oath you swore true. You ask what you are supposed to do? The old man shrugs and suggests that you will just have to find a new life, then he dissipates like smoke.   
You turn back to stare at the lights of the home in the distance, contemplating returning, attempting to prove your true identity to them. Even if they don’t recognize you, you should still be able to explain, to give examples of things only you could know. But as you try to think of those distinct memories, you notice that they are growing hazy, the harder you try to grasp them, the more they slip through your fingers. With rising panic, you realize that you barely remember anything about your life. Your old life. You know that you had one, that you had a home, a wife, friends, but it is blurry and indistinct. All you know clearly is the ache of losing something you can never get back. You get out of the car and turn to stare at it, wondering who left it in the ditch like this. You turn and wander off down the road on foot, unsure where you are going, but knowing that you don’t belong here.  
The vision ends there. If I could give you some advice, Melvin, it would be to never lie when you swear an oath. Oaths mean something to them, and you never really know when one is paying attention. But I would just be wasting my breath. Even if you see this, you won’t believe me anyway. So, I guess the only thing I can really say is enjoy the next two weeks, and better luck in your next life.
