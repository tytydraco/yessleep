I am currently typing this while trying to get as far away as I can from Teanaway River in Washington state. I don't know where I am going or where I am, all I know is that I have cell reception. I don't want anyone to get involved, I just want you to listen.

It all started about 4 days ago, driving east to go to our usual camping spot. Something we have done every year for as long as I can remember. Nothing was out of the ordinary, everything was nearly exactly as it had been every year.

I should probably specify exactly who I was going with. I was with my mom, dad, aunt, uncle, cousin and of course, myself. All 6 of us have gone many places before, we are kind of like a vacation group.

We had driven to the town near where we were camping, picked up groceries and supplies and set off up the mountain road. It was mostly uneventful. My cousin found a colorful bug or something which she got excited about but other than that, its was again, completely uneventful.

We started up the mountain road, enjoying the scenery, or at least 5 of us were. My cousin was hunched over next to me in the back of our minivan staring at her phone. After about 30 minutes we finally went out of cell reception right as our car drove over the section of road that transitioned from smooth concrete to rough gravel.

At this point we were extremely far up the long, winding mountain road. There is technically only one actual campground up the Teanaway road but there are plenty of pull-out spots and clearings that are way prettier and more private. (And most importantly, free). We usually have one pull-out spot that we always go to but there are other good once as well. The pull-out spot in question is a spot all the way down at the bottom of the river, with a long driveway leading down to it. This driveway is extremely difficult to navigate in a car.

We pulled up to the top of this driveway and parked. 3 of us stayed in the car and 3 of us walked down to check if anyone was camping in the spot. The people who walked down were me, my mom and my uncle. Thinking all the way back, I cannot remember a singular time someone had actually been camping at that spot, however, this time there was somebody.

A singular orange car was parked at the bottom of the driveway with one man, seemingly in his 40's to 50's sitting in the drivers seat. He was staring off as if he was in deep thought. We were standing on top of hill positioned next to the driveway, which allowed a full view of the campsite and driveway.

"Are you leaving soon?" My mom shouted, waving her hand.

In my head I had kind of thought that she would have to yell a few times to get his attention, but as soon as the words exited her mouth his head snapped towards us as if he had know we were there for the entire time.

He tilted his head down slightly and shook his head, he had a scowl on his face. It was pretty clear he did not want us there, so we all walked back up and got in the car. He was a little sketchy but we all assumed he was simply a grumpy old man who wanted his privacy, so we set off to find a different pull-out spot.

We were eventually able to find a large spot with room for all of our tents. There was also a nice swimming hole in the river. It was right on the road which wasn't optimal because whenever someone drives by you on that old dirt road, it brings up a hell of a lot of dust, but this wasn't a huge issue because besides the orange car guy, we hadn't seen a single other soul.

Everything went normal for until the second of 5 nights we were camping. Most of this "normal" time consisted of us doing normal camping things, walking around the woods, swimming in the river, hanging out. Everything, besides the orange car guy incident, had been completely unassuming.

It was the second night and we were all laughing and having fun. I should probably say that when you are camping, random noises coming from the outskirts of your campsite is almost never a cause for concern, after all, you are in the woods. There will be animals.

On our first night there had of course been the usual almost "ambient" noises around the campsite. A twig snapping, a owl hooting and of course the constant flow of water from the river. But the second night was different. There were footsteps. Not for long, but there were footsteps.

"Wait!" I said, holding my hand up.

"Have I watched The Blair Witch Project too many times or did I just hear footsteps." I said.

We all waited.

Nothing.

Everyone else resumed talking but I started thinking. I started to think the worst, something most people are prone to when out in the middle of the woods with nobody besides your family around. We still had not seen anybody besides the guy in the orange car. The first thing my mind wen too was the fact that we could be dealing with a stalker.

"Unlikely." I thought to myself, we haven't seen anybody else besides the guy in the orange car. However, that could just mean that they are really good at what they do.

"We would have heard their footsteps earlier." I thought.

Or maybe that was just the first time that they fumbled.

"No," I thought to myself. "I have been up here nearly 16 times before, and nothing has ever happened, we are in Washington, for god's sake, not Texas."

I calmed myself down and began conversing with the rest of my family again. Worrying will only make it worse, I thought.

After about 45 minutes we all stopped. Hearing the footsteps again, this time louder. Everybody could hear them this time, not just me. The footsteps started to speed up and get quieter as if they were running away. Everybody just sat in silence and listened, until finally, they were too quiet to hear.

They had clearly known that we had noticed them. Everybody stared it each other in horror. This had gone from 0 to 10 very quickly. Everybody was spooked but we eventually decided to just go to bed, hoping that they had realized that there was 6 people in the camp spot.

I know, it was a dumb decision but we had packed a lot for the trip and didn't want to give it up.

Eventually we decided to go to bed. By the time we were all in our tents it was about 12:30 in the morning, based off of our small watches. (We were using watched as we were trying to avoid using phones, it's a camping trip, not a glamping trip).

At about 4 am. (Again, based on my watch), I got up to "use the bathroom" or I guess "use the tree". I chose a tree right behind our tent in clearing of sorts. It was maybe 50 ft behind our tent so it wasn't like I was in the middle of the woods or anything. I had brought a flash light with me. I get to the tree and turn it on.

I point it at a large rock face and I of course see my shadow and the shadow of the tent. Just a second later, another shadow steps into view. I whip my head around faster than I ever had before and just barely see a old man in his 40's to 50's bolting into the woods at a suspiciously high speed. A point my flashlight in the direction he had ran in but he was already long gone.

I ran back to my tent so fast. I must have covered the whole 50 foot difference in about 2 - 3 seconds. I un-zipped the tent and jumped into my sleeping bag. I was shaking and breathing so hard that I am pretty sure I passed out instead of actually falling asleep.

I awoke and belted out the entire story to the 5 other people there and begged that we leave. Of. course, they didn't believe me.

"You sound like the main characters from a slasher flick!" I screamed in a fit of fury and fear.

I wanted to run back to town myself but of course that wasn't really a option considering what had happened the previous night.

"Can we at least go into town for a few hours to get more... um... supplies or something?" I begged, quite literally getting on my knees and pleading. It might sound like I was overreacting, but again, knowing someone is stalking you when you are in the middle of the woods by yourself is not a good feeling and any reasonable person would have a similar reaction to me.

"Yes, fine." My mom responded. We got in the car and drove to town. While we were in town I was able to calm down a little, but I was still dreading returning to the campsite. I was of course considering running now that we were in town but I couldn't leave my family to camp there and the man clearly had a car, a orange one. I wouldn't doubt he would follow me if I tried to run.

It is strange feeling, being in a town, out in the open, but not being able to ask for help or run out of fear of a person that you have never even fully seen. I was also forced to keep all these feelings to myself as there is no way in hell my family would ever believe me.

I was living in a state of paranoia, not sure if I could even call the cops or call anyone for that matter. They could have been watching me. It was a crazy feeling, a indescribable feeling. I was feeling more and more like I had hallucinated everything the previous night but also feeling more and more unsure about what I should do.

I though about this as we got back into the car and as we started driving back to the campsite. I was behaving normally on the outside but my mind was racing at a million miles per hour. I knew there had to be some way but I was just too scared to even do anything. Then it all started to go downhill.

At some point on our drive back my dad had taken a wrong turn and we ended up driving up a logging road. As we drove up the logging road we slowly realized that we had taken a series of wrong turns. There was a few dilapidated cabins and strange structures, such as wells. But that was normal for the area. Eventually we all realized that we had no idea where we were, and it was getting dark.

"What should we do?" My mom asked, sounding panicked.

"We have one more tent in the back of the car that we hadn't set up yet. We also have 2 air beds, we might have to inflate them with our mouths." She responded. At this point we were all freaked out, we hadn't even been driving for that long and it was already almost dark out. Nobody remembered taking a wrong turn anywhere either.

It was like we were just going back to our camp site, everything normal (well to everybody else, I was still very scared). And then the next moment, we have no idea where we are. It was so creepy.

We eventually pulled over and set up a small campsite that was really just a tent with airbeds we blew up by mouth.

I got into the tent before the rest of my family did, they were all trying to figure out what to do and I was just so done and wanted it to be day again. At some point I fell asleep and awoke at some point during the night. I could still hear the rest of family whispering, but then, out of nowhere, something absolutely horrifying happened.

I felt a blade scraping along my stomach. I was lying face down on the airbed.

There was somehow a man inside of my airbed.

I immediately jumped up and ran outside, screaming, not even wondering what I am wondering right now. How the hell did he fit in there, let alone get in there. I screamed and was at a loss for words. I just pointed at the tent as my uncle shined his flashlight at the tent. Of course, there was a silhouette.

"Get to the car." He said. We all ran to the car and tried to open the doors, they were locked. We then realized that we were not trying to open our car. Our car was gone. It was a orange car.

Everything from this point on is a blur. We just ran. Ran so far. All the way into town, somehow. We stopped at the store, there was nobody around, no cars driving on the streets, just a empty parking lot and nothing else.

The next thing I remember was waking up in a cabin, tied to a chair with the rest of my family around in a circle. I am sure there is more that happened like how we obviously somehow got kidnapped while hyperventilating in the SafeWay parking lot, but I don't remember any of that, it was all a blur. I also have a feeling that I would rather not remember any of that stuff.

Anyways, we were all tied to several chairs in what seemed to be a cabin with masked people all around us, they were holding a single orange. One eventually removed their mask. It was the man that was sitting in the orange car. It reminded me of a some cult scene from a movie.

"You came here at the wrong time." The man said in a monotone voice.

"We were hear at the right time." The rest responded, all in the same voice, all in unison.

"You cannot escape." The man said.

"We will always be free." The rest responded in the same way.

This went on for a very long time. I saw the sun rise and set, the phrases went from being somewhat cohesive sentences, to being completely random gibberish. I didn't sleep. I couldn't. Nobody else did either. We all just sat there, as if in some sort of trance, until finally. They untied me, and me only, and then left the cabin.

I whipped around to talk to the rest of family, well actually, I wasn't even sure if I could, my mouth was dry, I hadn't had a sip of water in so long. Again, I turned around.

They were all gone.

Instead, sitting in each chair was a super creepy sculpture with orange skin, a wide smile, and bloodshot eyes. This was it for me. I just ran again, through the dark. I eventually heard footsteps following me. I didn't dare to stop or look back. My lungs were drying out and I was about to collapse. I then jumped into the freezing cold river and ran downstream, through swimming holes, taking sips of water as I went.

It felt like nothing even mattered. I don't even remember what happened. In fact, past when we started heading back from town, I don't remember much at all. I have a small memory of somehow finding a bus stop, and getting on. I probably looked slightly deranged, but here I am now, typing this from my phone, which luckily has both a waterproof case and is waterproof itself.

I am sitting on a bus, I don't know where it is going, and I don't care. I am looking out over a hill as the sun is rising, and atop the hill is a lone orange tree.
