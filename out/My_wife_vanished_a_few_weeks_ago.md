I find this whole thing ridiculous. Medication should’ve been enough. But my doctor said writing would help me. As if keeping a stupid journal would bring my wife back. She disappeared not long ago. One night I had to leave urgently for work, and when I came back, she was gone. She didn’t answer my calls. There were no signs of struggle in the house. Lisa had simply vanished. The police are still searching, but as time goes on, I lose more and more hope. As if her disappearance wasn’t hard enough, I started having hallucinations. Some nights I would wake up to the sound of her voice. Not nightmares—the voice continued even when I was awake. I thought it would pass in a few days. Just trauma, nothing more. But it didn’t go away. So as a last resort, I went to a specialist. And what did he do? Handed me a piece of paper and told me to write whenever I saw her, whenever the visions came, and take my pills. I don’t know. Maybe it’ll work. I’ll try.

October 11, Tuesday

Last night it happened again. I had locked my bedroom door before bed. Around 3 AM, I woke to the sound of a vase shattering. Then came Lisa’s weak, whimpering cries. Right outside the door. But when I opened it, there was nothing—no wife, no broken vase. Just silence. I keep telling myself these are hallucinations, tricks my mind is playing on me. But they feel so real. I could swear the sound came from just behind the door. If I believed Lisa was here, I would’ve gone to her and asked if she was okay. The doctor told me to stay put and calm myself down when it happens. I took my pill and went back to bed. Thankfully, it relaxed me.

October 12, Wednesday

No voices last night. I woke up almost happy this morning. But when I went to take a shower, I saw her. Lisa. She was writing something on the bathroom mirror—with her own blood. It was pouring out of her. Her hair a tangled nest, her skin nearly green. Her face… it was my wife’s face, and yet not hers at all. She turned her head when she noticed me. Then she ran straight toward me, arms outstretched as if to grab me. I slammed the door shut before she reached it. But I never heard her body hit the door. Not a sound. I couldn’t bring myself to open it again. So I went to work this morning without showering.

October 13, Thursday

Last night was different. I heard footsteps pacing in front of my bedroom door. Heavy, like someone wearing military boots. Then Lisa started screaming.

“Stay away! Stay away! No! Don’t!”

Her cries of pain wouldn’t stop. And then suddenly, silence. As if someone had ripped her vocal cords out. That’s when the knocking started. Slow, rhythmic knocks on my door. This was him—her killer. Even in my hallucinations, he finds me. He knocked politely a few more times, then stopped. I don’t know what to think anymore. Are the pills failing? Is this getting worse? I’ve done everything the doctor told me. The only thing I know is that I can’t take much more of this.

October 14, Friday

I was standing in line at the office coffee machine today. Just as I turned to leave with my cup, I felt someone tap my shoulder. When I looked back, it was Lisa. Her eye sockets sunken, her hand leaving a bloody print on my shirt. And she was smiling. I could smell the stench of rot on her breath. I panicked and spilled my coffee. My coworker Marcus screamed—it was him who got burned. I rushed to help him, pretending it was just an accident, but inside I knew what had happened. After that, I took the rest of the day off. I don’t want to leave work—at least there, I can distract myself and Lisa stays away. But staying home feels more dangerous. Still, maybe it’s safer for my colleagues if I stay away.

October 15, Saturday

The boots were back. Pacing the corridor outside my room. Lisa’s cries followed. She was begging. Pleading. Then came the pounding on my door, so loud the walls shook.

“Carl! Please!”

My wife’s voice called my name from just inches away. I got up, heading for my pills.

“Carl!”

She screamed my name again. I forgot the pills. She needed me. I had to save her from him. My feet carried me to the door. I gripped the handle, ready to open it—until I heard her scream again. A scream no longer human. And then… silence. Frozen silence. The knocking returned. The killer knocking, calmly, politely. He knows I’m here. This time I forced myself to take the pills and breathe. I don’t think I’ll sleep tonight.

October 16, Sunday

I decided to go for a walk today. The thought that a killer waits for me inside this house is becoming too real. Maybe he’s hiding somewhere, waiting for the right moment to strike. I searched everywhere—drawers, closets, under the bed. No one. The fresh air helped clear my head. Back home, I picked up a book. Lisa’s favorite. She read it a thousand times and always begged me to read it once. I never did. Until today. I opened to the last page she had read. That’s when I noticed the stains. A drop of blood on the corner. Then two on the next page. Then smears along the margins. And then I saw it—words scrawled in blood across the printed text:

“Reading is pointless.”

I turned the page and vomited onto the carpet. The rest of the book had been hollowed out, its pages carved into a cavity holding… an eye. Hazel, vibrant, alive. Hers. Lisa’s. This can’t be a hallucination. I could feel the dried, sticky blood. And I had just taken my pills. I shouldn’t be seeing this. None of this should be happening.

October 18

She’s at my door every night now. Crying. Pounding. Begging me.

“Carl, please. Let me go. Please. Why… why?”

I want to help her. But I can’t open the door. I tried talking to her. She never answers, just repeats the same words.

“Carl… why? Why? Don’t… No… Let me go.”

And then the killer comes. He pounds on the door, harder every night. I bury my head under the pillow, but the sound never stops. He wants me.

Date unknown

I finished the pills. The whole bottle. There’s none left. What will I do tonight?

Date unknown

She’s begging again. My wife. I have to help her. This time I can save her. If I open the door, I can face him. I can protect her.

Date unknown

It’s a trap. The killer is using her voice to lure me. If I open the door, he’ll take me too. Lisa’s screams are worse than ever. She says new things now.

“My eyes… you took my eyes. It hurts.”

If I open the door, he’ll take mine too. I’ve barricaded it. He won’t get in. But God… he’s strong. So strong.

Date unknown

He’s going to break through. He’ll smash the door to pieces. I need to call the police. Where’s my phone?

Date unknown

She’s gone. No voice tonight. But the boots… I hear them again.

Date: Help me

He’s breaking it. He’ll get in tonight. He’s more insistent than ever. The barricade won’t hold. This is the end. I’m going to die. I shouldn’t have… I’m sorry, Lisa. I shouldn’t have.

Date:

The killer. I saw him. I saw his face.

October 26, Wednesday

The weather is beautiful today. It rained all night. The river down the road must be flooded. I heard the rain stop around dawn. Perfect morning for a walk. I love the smell of wet soil, the crisp chill of autumn air. The forest a few kilometers away will be stunning—birds singing, leaves glowing orange and red. I’ll drive there. I just hope the road isn’t too flooded, or the ground too muddy. I should wear boots. My only pair are military boots, but they’ll do. The sun is warm, almost apologetic for the storm. Maybe I’ll see a rainbow along the way. I shouldn’t waste time.

Wait. Is that the neighbor’s dog? It’s in my yard again, sniffing, digging under the tree. Lately, it keeps coming back. Always scratching at the same spot.

I guess I’ll have to bury Lisa’s body deeper.
