The Frequency That Shouldnâ€™t Exist

I never believed in the supernaturalâ€”until I heard it.

Like most people, I use background noise to help me sleep. The steady hum of brown noise has always been my go-to. It drowns out distractions, lulls my mind into calmness, and helps me drift off. Itâ€™s predictable, scientific, and completely safeâ€¦ or at least, thatâ€™s what I thought.

But last night, something changed.

I was scrolling through YouTube, looking for a new brown noise video to play in the background while I slept. One caught my eyeâ€”it had almost no views and had been uploaded just minutes ago. The title?

"Deep Brown Noise â€“ Sleep at Your Own Risk."

I hesitated. Something about it felt wrong. It wasnâ€™t just the titleâ€”it was the way it sat there, waiting, like it wanted me to click.

I should have ignored it. But curiosity won.

I pressed play.

At first, it sounded normalâ€”a deep, low hum, steady and rhythmic. Comforting, even. But within minutes, the air in my room changed. It feltâ€¦ heavier.

Like the walls were pressing inward.

Like something else was in the room with me.

I shook it off. Probably just exhaustion. Probably just my imagination.

Thenâ€¦ the whispers started.

At first, I thought it was just an audio illusionâ€”my brain trying to make patterns out of white noise. But no. These whispers were real. Faint, layered beneath the brown noise, like multiple voices speaking at once.

I couldn't understand the words, but the tone was unmistakable. Urgent. Commanding. Calling.

Then my screen flickered.

The video timestamp glitched, jumping forward and backward.

3:33 AM.

I frowned. That didnâ€™t make sense. I had only started the video a few minutes ago. Why was the time jumping?

Thenâ€”out of the corner of my eyeâ€”I saw it.

A shadow.

It flickered, just for a second, in the corner of my room. But there was nothing there. My breath caught in my throat.

I turned back to my screen. My reflection stared back at me from the darkened display.

But something was wrong.

I blinked.

It didnâ€™t.

I tilted my head slightly. My reflection stayed still.

My pulse pounded in my ears. I reached for the pause buttonâ€”but my hand wouldnâ€™t move.

My fingers hovered over the trackpad, but something held them there.

Then, in my ear, so close I felt the heat of breath that wasnâ€™t there, I heard it.

"Donâ€™t turn it off."

The lights flickered.

My laptop shut off.

The brown noise stopped.

And in the sudden, deafening silenceâ€¦ I heard breathing.

Not mine.

Not from outside.

From right next to me.

I launched myself out of bed, smacked my laptop shut, and turned on every single light in my apartment.

But the feeling didnâ€™t go away.

Even now, as I write this, I still feel it. Like something is watching. Like something is waiting.

I checked YouTube this morning. The video is still there. The channel? Still up.

I donâ€™t know if this was just some weird audio trick, a bizarre glitch, or something much, much worse.

But if youâ€™re brave enoughâ€¦ listen for yourself.

I donâ€™t know if it will affect you the same way it affected me.

But just in caseâ€¦

Donâ€™t listen alone.
