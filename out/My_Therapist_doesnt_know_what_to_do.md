I f17 have a boyfriend who’s m21. I’ll call him Jack. Yesterday evening I was getting ready to go to sleep. It was already dark outside so same as every day my dad turned on the lights in our garden. I was just done switching into my sleepwear when I saw a person standing in front of my window. At first I was really scared and didn’t know what to do but then I decided to maybe try to see who it was. When I was approaching my door, which was a big window at the same time, I saw that the person didn’t move, so I opened the door to talk to them. As I was trying to open my door I recognized the strange figure as my boyfriend. I asked Jack what he was doing in front of my house in the middle of the night and he stated he just wanted to see me, so I let him in. We were sitting at my bed for a moment and started talking but then I remembered some Reddit story i saw on TikTok about a man who wanted to let his neighbor in but he saw the neighbor somewhere else so he came to the conclusion that the person in front of his door was a skinwalker. In this moment it hit me. This person next to me wasn’t my boyfriend, it was a skinwalker. 

Unfortunately I had already let him in so I started screaming uncontrollably. My so called boyfriend was shocked to suddenly seeing me scream like this and it didn’t take long for my sibling 14, my mum 48 and my dad 51 to enter my room. Jack tried to explain them everything but I screamed my theory about the skinwalker. At first my parents got angry at Jack because they thought he did something to me but then he explained himself and they started to believe I was hallucinating because I was mentally unstable already. Jack and my mother then decided it was the best to immediately take me to the hospital. On the way there I didn’t ever stop screaming because I was so scared for my life. When we got to the hospital, the lady at the reception immediately sent us to an experienced therapist. They all thought I was schizophrenic. We were sent to the therapists office and the young woman started to slowly calm me down. She told me about how skinwalkers didn’t exist and how my boyfriend just looked like one by coincidence. My boyfriend even showed me his phone and ID as a proof it was actually him. As I was calming down I got to an idea tho. I told everyone we were leaving for my boyfriend’s apartment to prove it was actually empty. The Therapist agreed to this as long as she was allowed to come along. 

When we got there we were looking through my boyfriend’s window when in shock we all realized that he was standing inside his bedroom. Now it was my so called boyfriend who got a panic attack. The therapist couldn’t explain what happened so at that point we were all panicking. The therapist then decided to call 911. We separated so me and my mom were sitting on the other side of the street as my boyfriend and the therapist as we were waiting for the cops. When they finally arrived they immediately told me and my mom to leave and go home safely as this was a special emergency the population shouldn’t know about. As we walked back to our car I looked through my boyfriend’s window again a last time to check if he was ok but when I did I saw him grin at me. It wasn’t just a normal grin, it was wider and the teeth looked very strange. When we’re in the car I saw the police arrest who was the man with me and the hospital. 

We were driving home when I started rethinking the whole thing. What if my boyfriend was actually with me in the hospital and whoever was in his apartment was the fake Jack? Now I am sitting at my bed in the early hours shaking, hoping for some advice. I tried calling my boyfriend so many times and no answer, not even from the officers. I’m so scared something happened to him, someone please help me.
