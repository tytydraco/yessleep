Me and my wife loved hiking and spelunking. Every month or so we’d find a new trail or a new cave and go exploring to see what mother nature had in store. One day we find this old heavily wooded trail, overgrown with vegetation. I thought it would be a cool idea to explore it but my wife hesitated which is understandable, a bit disappointed but in agreement, we didn’t go. The next day however she wanted to go explore it, her reason being that she saw the disappointed look on my face and felt bad. I felt like a dick for making her feel bad but she strongly insisted we go and I’m not gonna miss out on any adventure and so we set off for the trail.



We made it back to the trail and got ourselves ready to go, grabbing out gear and other necessities and dousing ourselves in gallons of bug spray. The day was perfect as the trail wasn't as overgrown as I thought and my wife was having a nice time, cracking jokes between each other and having wonderous conversations. About 3 hours in we started getting tired and so we stopped in a nice, shady spot under a tree and put our stuff down. I sat down on a large rock that was off to the side and rummaged through my bag to find my granola bar, that's when I felt a sharp sting on my arm. I didn’t get a chance to see what bug it was but I slapped it off and it flew away. I took out the stinger and treated the wound and we decided to leave to go to the hospital to get it checked out.   
  


On the way to the hospital, the sting formed a large painful welt that began to itch. I knew scratching at it was a bad idea because it could cause potential infection but it was extremely unbearable. Seconds felt like minutes and the pain never subsided. It got worse with every wave of itchiness and every throb that felt like my whole arm was covered by hornets on fire. 



We got to the hospital and they examined the welt not seeing any potential threats, they gave me an anti-itch ointment to put on, prescribed me some pain meds and sent me and my wife home. As soon as we got home, I immediately went to the bathroom to put some of the ointment on for some relief and that's when I saw the welt in the mirror. It had gone from a bright red to a deep purple spot on my arm. Thinking it was only bruising up as a part of the healing process, I put the ointment on, took some of the pain relievers and went about the rest of the day.



The next few days were torture, on day two the area of bruising spread much farther up my arm. On day three, a mixture of pus and blood began seeping from the initial wound. That made us decide to go to the hospital again, to see what they could say about it. They began to worry themselves so they put me down for a CT scan to see anything but when the results came back everyone was a bit relieved. The CT scan showed nothing but the welt itself filled with pus. So we decided to get the welt drained, patched up my arm in gauze and were sent on our way. They said to continue with the antibiotics and everything would clear up in a few days.



Within said few days everything seemed to have gotten better. The bruising stuck around but the pain became less significant than before. For those few days, I felt the best I ever had in a long time. 



One morning as I woke up, I went to get out of bed but as I went to put pressure on my arm to push myself up, I collapsed and rolled off the bed. It hurt a bit but I laughed it off thinking I had a  dead arm. I got myself up and walked to the bathroom to freshen up then I noticed my arm in the mirror. My arm was a nasty shade of purple and my fingertips had gone near black and I couldn't feel a thing. I screamed for my wife and as she hurried in, she nearly fainted herself. My wife rushed me to the hospital and once they saw my arm, they immediately got me to a room for surgery. As the doctor came in to check my arm, she asked me the typical questions and felt my whole arm. I told her I can't feel anything. As she made her way to the spot where I was stung/bit there was a crunch. The doctor grabbed her scalpel and went to go make an incision. 



As soon as there was a cut, hundreds of insects began to squirm and crawl out. My wife ran out of the room, the doctor gagged behind her mask and I screamed in horror. The doctor cut more and pulled back the dead skin and revealed hundreds of maggots squirming around, eating their way out of my arm. I passed out from the sight being too much. Needless to say I lost my arm that day but luckily it didn’t affect anywhere else. I don’t remember much as the trauma of the incident really got to me, even to this day. I swore off hiking in the woods for a long time as I can't fathom the lingering fear of being bitten again, lest seeing a bug. Even with my arm amputated I can feel them squirming and crawling.
