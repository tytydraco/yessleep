I am, finally, brave enough to post this. I do not care about the consequences. I may be arrested and prosecuted for treason. I shall not use my real name.



You can call me Rareș. Sergeant Rareș Buzescu, of the Romanian Army. This is what happened to me in October 2022. I was in a military unit in the delta of the Danube, in the north of the Dobrogea region of Romania, under the border with Ukraine. A little bit of context, for those unfamiliar with the places: That region of Ukraine is southern Basarabia, sandwiched between Romania and the Republic of Moldova and it used to be Romanian theritory. It has had a turbulent past, belonging during the centuries to many states, being strategically important.



In those days, a lot of confusion and fear were present in Romania. Being close to war, rumors of incidents made things very tense. People were afraid, several Romanian military aircraft were brought down, the Ukrainian forces admitted they did it accidentally. Romania, being a NATO country, any incident like this could degenerate into a war with either Russia or Ukraine and Romania to be in the front line of destruction of World War III. 



That night we heard explosions before the alarm was set. It seems some missiles coming from the north of the border hit Romanian targets. It was a chilly, autumn evening. It would not be the last incident of this sort. We did not know if they were the Ukrainians or the Russians. The colonel summoned us to prepare for marching to the target.



The delta of the river Danube is split between Romania and Ukraine. It is one of the last true wild ecosystems in Europe, an official Biosphere Reservation. It is, basically, a huge marshland, where the Danube splits in smaller channels, until it flows into the Black Sea.



We followed orders, of course, in silence, in the thicket. The explosions stopped, some fires in the distance were visible, we could not make out if they were across the border or not. Suddenly, gunshots were heard not very far, we were ordered to be prepared for combat. Another military unit was pretty close, they were dispatched first. When we finally reached the location of the first flames, we could see that there was an explosion earlier in the evening on Romanian soil. On the other side of the border, things were burning as well.



Our comrades from the other unit have reached the location; some were already fallen, dead or wounded. In fact, most of them were down. It was here: War. For real, for the first time. It felt unreal. I was a soldier, I knew this was my purpose,  but it was not supposed to be like this. It felt unreal also, it did not expect it. I mean, in Romanian history, as we were taught in school, Romanians fought bravely against our enemies, against the Ottomans, the Hungarians, the Soviets, and the Nazi. But then at least it was clear *whom and why* we were fighting. Now we did not.



Finally, we found a living soldier. He was breathing heavily when the colonel shouted at him: ”Report! What has happened?”



The private answered: ”They attacked us. They fought each other, on the other side, then they came to us.” ”The Russians?”



”We don't know. We were bombarded and they came shooting. They looked insane and fired at us like they had rabies, honestly…”



At this point, he was breathing hard. The colonel left him, looked around in the silence and ordered us to cross the bridge into Ukrainian territory. We obeyed, we were soldiers, soldiers obey orders. But we knew what this meant. A part of me wanted to just flee. No, I was not afraid of death or physical injury. I was afraid of being part of this and suffering and dying sensely and shamefully. I would have preferred to have been dead, by some previous disease or something to have killed me before getting into this. 



I even hoped a loose bullet would take down now, before being engaged in the fight. I was not old, I was in my late twenties, but I wanted to die with a clean conscience then to get on with this. I thought of running and being put to trial like a deserter, perhaps I would have been executed. The thoughts rose up, one after the other, in my mind.



We crossed the bridge and the colonel brought us, as the last remains of daylight disappeared, in thicket. I didn't even know if the colonel knew what he wanted, it doesn't matter anyway. Trees formed like a small forest, on the other side of the border, almost complete darkness and chill. A shadow creeped upon my heart, it was something else, something different from what I felt before. A fear not just of death, a fear not just of dishonor, it was something else that engulfed all my previous fears, worked alongside them and made them stronger. 



Then, it started. They ran and fired. I could not make out if they shouted in Russian or Ukrainian, or both (I do not understand either.) and the uniforms were not clear. They fired at us, each other, in every direction. Colonel ordered to engage in fire. We complied. I fired at any non-Romanian soldier I could see holding the gun towards us. Some seem to have been Ukrainian, some Russian, I did not care, it did not matter. Some of them were hit, some of us were hit. I became numb, I desperately knew I had not just to protect myself, but my comrades. At least this was something I could do, something to hold on to and not just pointing the gun at me and finishing me off. It seems I already killed several people, the first time in my life. Were they allies, were they foes? I did not know.



Something was tearing inside my soul, a part of me. Yes, I have made a great mistake joining the military. I was not made for this, at least not in this situation. I think I could have been a war hero, but in World War II, not in War War III. This was my thought, as the Russians and/or Ukrainians mingled with us. I felt no physical pain, as they hit me chaotically and I responded as non-chaotical as I could. A warm liquid touched my hand gently. I realized it came from my shoulder: I was hit by a bullet and did not even realize it. The enemies looked, like the comrade said earlier, like being on rabies: their eyes wide in terror, mouths opened, they charged at us, but were also running from us. 



As we entered the woods, the clash became even more chaotic, as darkness engulfed us and little to no light was visible. My heart was beating hard, as we lost it and started running with no sense deeper inside the woods, like being driven. Incidents became fewer, the clash went cold and silence took over almost completely. I continued to run deeper, in the darkness. I heard callings in Romanian, I asked one of them, then decided not to, in order not to attract attention to myself. 



It was cold, bitter darkness. Suddenly, I hit something, in the dark. Something that blacked my way, like some kind of net, that held me fiercely. No, I was not tangled, more like glued to it. I tried to force my way out of it but, the more I forced it, the less I was able to release myself. My mind felt almost completely helpless of handling this new thing and it started to shut down. Yet, like a faint whisper, a thought came to my mind: ”Take the knife (combat knife) from your boot, while you still can, and cut it out. Fast!” I obeyed the thought and managed to get the knife. Fortunately, my right arm was almost completely free of the thing and I was able to grab it and started cutting.



It was hard to achieve this, at first, but I think it was good that it was hard. If it came to easy, my mind would not have calmed down, would have not settled down and I would have restarted running blindly. I was desperate at first, seeing that it was so hard to cut, especially since I clearly felt I needed to get out as fast as I could. As I struggled with the process, I started to become aware of my situation and surroundings and, even if I knew I had every reason to finish it as soon as possible, I was able to evaluate my situation and what was around me more calmly. Few people were around at this point, few gunshots, some screams from time to time. 



The darkness felt unreal and intoxicating. I tried to get rid of this thought, as was starting to get hold of myself, but I could not escape it. And something like whispered in my thoughts something very bad will happen to me soon, if I do not get out soon from there. Indeed, as I was getting close to cutting it completely, I heard a rumble in the trees behind this net, from up, towards me. For the last two seconds, before breaking free, I even caught a glimpse of something moving, but I escaped and went backwards.



This time, I was determined not to lose myself so easily and, although I was far from being safe, I walked slowly and, eventually, decided to stop and evaluate. The almost complete darkness felt unnatural, like some sort of black mist that, once entering the lungs, made my mind like being into some sort of drug. I thought this could be chemical weapons or something. I stood on the spot and opened a flashlight from my haversack. I was able to bring the light only for a few meters in front of me, like the light got lost into that mist. 



I was able to see the trees around, no person in sight. I went towards what seemed to me like the way out, slowly, looking around. Some small sounds were heard in the trees.



Suddenly, in front of me, in the upper branches of the tree, I saw something white, standing there. It was shaped like a Human, but engulfed like some sort of a  whitish or grayish shroud, with legs tied together, like an Egyptian mummy. It twitched a little and then I realized that the same matter the shroud was made from is the same as the leftovers of the net on my hands and uniform. The shape in the tree moved and I realized pretty fast it was not moving on its own. Something moved the shape from behind and I could see a dark thing, almost the size of the Human shape, covering it, and some dark, articulated arms taking over the white shape.

  


I could not bring myself to move and stop watching. The dark creature stabbed the white shape in the chest area and started some sort of sucking from it voraciously. Dark fluid came out to the ground and a striking, disgusting smell of blood mixed with something I did not know what it was. It was a spider eating its still living prey.



I turned my flashlight around me, around the trees and noticed that this tree was not the only one with victims wrapped in cocoons. My blood ran cold, when I realized that above me, in the canopy, the spiders were moving. How many of them there were, I do not know. I started to run towards what seemed to me like the exit of the woods. No living person was in sight, although I could see corpses all over the place. From time to time, some cocoon swung in the wind, or had fallen to the ground.



I stumbled into one, almost falling. I could feel that almost nothing but bones were left, engulfed into some goo that stuck to my boot, like a glue, sticking the tip of my foot with the cocoon and I had use the second boot, to let go, while I could hear clearly something above me coming down, pretty close. I managed not to lose myself and escape just before an unbearable stench almost touched me.



Less than a minute later, in front of me, on the trail, a thick web, with something really big moving on the other side. An insidious sensation of deep danger came over me, as I watched the thing from behind. I went backwards, looking behind and around me, for a way out, on another track, where I could see no web or creature. But this was a really bad idea,  as I stumbled more into the woods, especially since I was unfamiliar with the place. 



I stopped in my tracks, for a while, trying to figure out what to do. I listened around me, faint noises around me, scratches not very far, but not too close either. No living soldiers, only dead (or dying?) from time to time. Where was everybody? Has someone escaped? There was no way of knowing. I was trained to face difficult situations, but this was beyond all I ever imagined, as this new enemy was unlike any I prepared  to face. I needed to meet someone, anybody. I sat down, listened and sniffed. Yeah, I sniffed. Strange odors, marsh combined with weird, unpleasant smells. The darkness itself felt unnatural in itself, like it was absorbing light, so to say, the flashlight could not reach far, it was like it faded into some fluid. 



Was I afraid of death? Yes, I was. But that was not all. I would have preferred a death that I could understand, a death I could expect, if it makes sense, but not this. I did not understand what was going on and that made me feel that all my experiences, all my training was not just useless, but also senseless. I kneeled on one leg and looked at the ground, not knowing what to do. I listened, trying to calm myself even further so that my rational mind shall find a way. 



Then I heard a rustle in the tree next to me. I had the first impulse to just run, but something in mind told me it was a bad idea, I do not know why. I turned back slowly, towards the source of the sound, making sure not to point the light directly at it. I was clearly a Spider, it was almost two meters long, and it dropped something towards me. I snapped and jumped towards the place I came from, but another of those creatures was in there. Then, I heard gunshots from sideways, sounded like an AKM. Bullet flew above my head, like someone aimed at the creature behind me. It gave a shriek, and it seemed to stop. I dared not to move, waiting for a cease fire. And it did, I heard footsteps coming fast towards me.



I noticed my benefactor. It was a tall, muscular woman, with long, black hair. I noticed the Ukrainian flag on her uniform. She came fast towards me, grabbed my arm and pushed me towards some bushes I had not looked before. I let her guide me, it felt like she knew the place. I could not ask anything, we were silent. She gasped for air, as she pushed me. 



”I hope it is clear there. We shall see.” she said.



”What to be clear?” I asked.



”A small underground shed or refuge.” she replied. ”I think I can find it.” My flashlight was a clear advantage, being able to see it, even if at a short distance, the webs and we were able to avoid them. Those things were in the trees, mostly, not on soil, fortunately, even if, at some point, a pretty large one charged at us.



”I think we missed it. We need to go back.” she added and turned us around. I could hear a rustle behind us, but not too close. It felt like we moved in circles for about five minutes (I felt much longer, but I am sure it could not have been more.) until she knocked with her boot something almost completely covered in fallen autumn leaves. We stopped.



”Here it is.” she said, as she started to remove the leaves, showing a hatch, then going down to open it.



As I went down too, to help her, I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder, where the bullet hit me, but I did not care too much. She succeeded in opening the hatch, but something blocked the full opening. A few bullets burst from inside, as the rustle from behind came closer and I knew that, if there is to get in, we should do it fast. 



She shouted something in Russian or Ukrainian, a male voice responded from below. They argued a bit, until I said:  ”If he lets us in, do it in the next seconds. It is very close.”, as a spider about the size of a ten year old child was only a few meters away. She started to plead and it worked. The man managed to push the improvised barricade at the hatch to let us in.



The woman went first. As the creature came closer, I struggled to turn around, in order to keep my eyes on the spider, as it was inches from me. I placed, without realizing it, the flashlight towards the creature. 



Two things happened at the same time. First one, I saw a being that was deeply dark, so dark that it made shiver, emanating something like it wanted to consume me as fast as possible, something I could feel in its eyes that I could not distinguish, but that I could feel strongly they were there, in that giant black mass. The second one was that the creature stopped in its tracks when the beam of light hit where I felt the eyes were for a few seconds. Those seconds were enough for me to get through the hatch.



I tried to close it, but the pain in the shoulder made me unable to pull and a dark shape covered the little light coming from outside. Coldness took over my body and the stench made me nauseated. I could hear sounds of a mouth chewing nothing, in anticipation of chewing my flesh. A harsh, sticky, hairy, black articulated arm entered just for a few seconds, before a bullet from inside hit the arm. A shriek with splatter and the arm retreated, just enough as a thin man, wearing a Russian uniform came, pulled the hatch, then locked it. Fortunately, I did not drop the flash light, and a second flashlight, held by the man, made enough light to see [underneath.It](http://underneath.It) was a small underground structure, more like a refuge. I am not sure if this was to be a refuge or some storage place, since many provisions seemed to be deposited, mostly crates covered in dark green canvases. The man went towards the end of the corridor. There were a few rooms on the left and right, but he went to a larger one, at the end. Some chairs, a blanket, some food on the floor, guns. The two spoke in Russian and/or Ukrainian. 



”Sorry to interrupt, folks, could we speak English, please? I do not know either Russian or Ukrainian…” I said. They stopped and looked at me. He answered: ”Ok, then, it makes sense.” I looked at him. He appeared around the age of forty, pretty thin and short, but stocky, in a way. His almost complete shaved head was covered with a small military cap.



”What is going on?” I said. They stood silent for a few seconds, then the man started, not breathing to easily, like trying to remain calm:



”We fought for about two days before they came. We did not plan shooting into Romanian territory. But, as casualties arose in such a short time, weirdness started. As lack of sleep builded up, some of us start to act weird, not all in the same way. At first, they were only dreams and hallucinations, I do not think they were hallucinations now, of being attacked in their beds by some small creatures. Some showed small scars on their bodies, but they were dismissed, since we were in the middle of a battle.



Some started to turn on each other, the colonel ordered detention, then all who behaved aggressively were shot. The Ukrainians kept fighting, we had to fight back. Soon, we did not know how much we fought the enemy and how much we fought each other. I did not know who I could trust, if I could follow orders or not. Then those things started to appear. I did not pay much attention to them, trying to keep myself from being killed by my comrades. But I could not deny it when I first saw a black spider, near the edge of the camp, eating away from the still living body of our cook. I managed to get close to Yury, one of my comrades who felt still sane and we retreated in the center of the camp, until the order came to leave a large part of the equipment and get into the woods near the border and we were dragged alongside the rest.



In the fields, those creatures attacked us, some trying to fight back. But even from those who we still able to understand this is a new, non-Human enemy we had to deal against, seemed too confused and unable to fight back properly. I heard we were about to clash with the Ukrainian foe, that the Romanians seem to have crossed the border, as a response of the provocation, when me and Yuri managed to run away and get into the woods on our own. But the spiders were there, more of them and larger. Yury was caught by a very large one, just before I stumbled across the hatch. I found my way in and barricaded the entrance.”



The woman started: ”Pretty similar things happened to us as well. Small spiders were seen at first, biting people, who started acting weird. Unfortunately, our colonel was affected pretty early on and started just shooting people. The major shot the colonel and shouted he is the new commander, some protested, and someone I could not identify shot the major. The flood gates were open and my comrades started turning on each other. I hid myself up to a point, then, like in his case, I was taken with the flow, as the people started to head towards the woods.”



I gave a sigh and looked at them. ”You know, my country may be enemies with any of your countries, I understand not to talk about certain aspects. But right now, what matters is that those things are a common enemy and, in the end, all of us are Human. We need to work together to escape.” They looked at me, the woman smiled and nodded, the man gave a sigh and nodded as well. ”I think it is ok to introduce ourselves. I am Sergeant Rareș Buzescu, Romanian army.”



The woman said: ”Lieutenant Olena Kerkova, Ukrainian army”.



The man said: ”Private Dmitry Feodorov, Russian army”. We shook hands and started talking on a strategy. Olena tried to help me with my shoulder, some stinky goo was on my uniform. Fortunately it was barely more than a scratch and she managed to keep it covered from the goo. We ate a bit, took some vodka, then went to the entrance to listen.



I found out that Dmitry was from Yekaterinburg, that he lost his father when he was in primary school. He told us he used to be religious as a child, then he became colder into faith, but not atheist. He told us he prayed for the first time in a while tonight and he feels that only God can help us. Olena told us that she was from Kyiev, that she joined the army years ago, that she was always a competitive girl, as a child and teen, who loved female action heroes, that she was a convinced feminist. Then, after a while, being disappointed in real life military life, left it and became a hair stylist. She held a Youtube channel where she posted ASMR videos with haircuts, hair styling and massages, while being dressed sexy. The channel gained some following, she did some interventions, like pumping her lips, she planned breast augmentation, when war came she was called to arms, on the basis of her previous formation.



I told them that I was from Suceava, in the north, that I was not particularly religious, that I became a soldier due the wargames and RPGs I played as a teen and that I justified it to myself somewhat thinking of the patriotic literature I was taught in primary school. I told them I was never truly religious, that I went to the Easter service, to weddings and funerals and that was about it. Dmitry told me it makes a good idea to start praying now and he showed us the cross his late grandmother gave him that he never stopped wearing.



The surroundings were, mostly, silent, but we did not dare to come out, as we still felt their presence, like waiting for us to get out.  I started: ”Those flash lights shall not be out of battery soon. The night is still pretty long, so we need to decide quickly what to do. I hear them screeching on the outside. Is there any way for them to break in?”



Olena replied: ”There are some ventilation shafts, sideways, as far as I know, but they are pretty narrow. I don't know, if there are little ones, as they seem to change size, they may enter.”



”I say to secure them.” I answered. They agreed and we started searching each chamber for the vents. They were pretty narrow, they were not hard to cover with cloth, although the metal covers were kind of rusty. We have had enough supplies for a few days, and decided to put the flash lights off and stick them together near the entrance, and watch the clock from time to time. We allowed ourselves to sleep for about 90 minutes at a time, but never all at once.



As we sat, we felt like some force, let's say (I can not find a better term.) in the air, something that took away, slowly, my will to fight and live and I started not just feel, but also live like it was just a question of time before I shall become the meal of the creatures, like they spread something in the very air we breathed and it entered our tissues.



Neither of them seem to know if this was a weapon of either armies, they seemed sincere enough. Dmitry started praying, he said he felt like it, the Paraklesis of the Mother of God, then the Akatist of Saint Demetrios of Thessaloniki, who was his patron Saint. We felt a clear release from the shadow on our souls, although not totally. I dared to have a little sleep, then Olena fell asleep alongside me. Suddenly, Dmitry woke us up.



”There is something in the first room on the right,” he said. 



”We secured them. What can it be?” I asked.



”I do not know. Let's have a look.” he answered.



We managed to get up and open our flashlights and get into there. There was something screeching in there, behind a wooden box. Carefully, Dmitry removed it to discover a dead mouse and, behind it, a hole between the floor and the wall, probably made by mice. Olena gave a sigh of relief, probably thinking it was a mouse. Dmitry looked carefully around, pointing with the flashlight around. I felt dread, I knew that was not a mouse that made those sounds, even if it used, probably, the mouse hole to enter. With my flashlight I managed to get a glimpse of something larger than a rat, something black that ran away from my light, before jumping upon Dmitrys left leg and piercing the flesh through the pants. 



I hurried to help him and I saw a black spider, larger than a tarantula, firmly embedded in his leg. Pointing the light upon it, it gave some sort of screech, it was clearly uncomfortable with the light, but it held on. I grabbed my knife and tried to stab it, between the head and the abdomen. It was not easy, as I had to be careful not to get bitten myself. Dmitry fell to the ground, and I used his lack of balance to crush the neck of the spider with the knife and a black, sticky fluid came out of it. Dmitry  grabbed it with a piece of canvas and pulled it out fast, with a grimace of pain, breaking its head from the rest.



”No, you should not have done that.” said Olena, going down next to him. ”The mouth pieces will remain in the flesh.” Dmitry was panting, as the fluid started to stick to his clothes, and the clothes to the skin. ”Fast, we need to remove the head and the pants!” I was a bit confused, since I did not know what to do. ”We need to improvise. I shall try with a knife!”



What followed was a kind of brutish improvisation. I am not sure how much Olena knew what she was doing. She tried to pull out the mouthpieces from the wound with the knife, I think she kind of fumbled. I actually tried to call in Romania, since the border was close and I might have got some signal, but it did not work. Olena tried to wash the wound with some vodka. Dmitry endured pretty stoically, only with some moans. 



”We need to get him to a hospital as fast as we can. This could be lethal soon.” said Olena.



”Either death or losing my mind, like those before me.” replied Dmitry. ”No, I do not think there is any way to reach any hospital soon. I think this is it.”



”Stop it!” said Olena. ”With this attitude, you shall die surely. Without it, at least you have a chance.”



Dmitry started laughing bitterly. ”No, I know it, I feel. This is how it is supposed to happen. I prayed earlier, I am quite at peace now. You can either let me die or, if I get insane, like the others, you can either shoot me or send me out to eat me.” Olena looked at him with a mix of anger and frustrated desperation, but Dmitry continued:



”One of us needs to die in order for the rest to escape. They shall enter this place before dawn, one way or the other. They are really hungry and we know it. I prayed when you thought I was sleeping. I remember how Saint Demetrios, my patron Saint, the Christian military imprisoned for Christ, prayed in prison that Nestorius, the Christian fighter, would defeat the giant champion of the Pagans, Lyaios, like David defeated Goliath. I remembered how, when the Pagans discovered that the prayer of Saint Demetrios helped defeat Lyaios, they killed him, and he became a Martyr. Tonight is his night, the night between summer and winter. The choice is yours, mine if already taken.”



”No!” shouted Olena. ”Cut the crap, we shall all escape! We shall take you to the hospital! We shall escape this!” She started to make plans out loud, on how to leave. My heart felt something in the words of Dmitry, like some power was in him, like a little bit of the peace he had come to me as well. Earlier, when I fought outside, I never prayed a bit, but now I started to feel like doing it, just by looking at him. Nonetheless, I helped Olena, both in discussing tactics and in putting them in practice.



We improvised some torches from pieces of wooden box, with cloth and vodka, to keep them away. We also improvised some Molotov cocktails, from vodka bottles and cloth. Olena was very pushy about this and I really admired her for that, as I admired Dmitry for his attitude. In a way, both of them were completing each other.



”You know,” said Dmitry caughting, ”I have heard about things like that years ago. It is not the first time this has happened. They came where people fight and kill each other. It makes them stronger, they are greedy in suffering and death. They are terribly powerful, but they are not by far undefeatable. I never heard anyone escaping something like what we go through now, but I trust The Lord that you have a chance. And, in case you didn't escape, be ready to die. Ask for The Lord to forgive you for all your transgressions, say your sins to each other. It is not like confessing them to a priest, but it matters. I shall start myself, whatever I tell you now, tell a priest you trust, this is my final confession.”



And he started telling us his sins, as we prepared. We could not stop him. What he told us then I shall not disclose, but I told to a priest after I escaped. Olena refused to confess in front of us, and that made me reluctant to do it either. Dmitry gave a sigh, as all was ready.



”Forgive each other, love each other. Please forgive me for everything. Pray as much as you can: Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner! Be prepared for both life and death. Death will seem certain, but it is not.” By this time, he was already caughting bad, his face became bluish-grey, he could not walk on his own.



I took him and helped walk on the stairs. Olena held both a torch, and a gun, I held only a torch. She opened the hatch. A cold breeze that felt like it would have frozen my bones, if it weren't something else holding me, both me and Olena. The webs were all over the trees, the air was thick and difficult to breathe, like it intoxicating us with terror and hopelessness. One side of me realized all this, and the other side was tranquil. The result was like watching all this detached, somehow. We used the compass to determine where south was and the plan was to go south, as much as possible, to exit the woods.



We stepped out. No rain, only an autumn breeze. We felt them around, we felt the trees above us, but they did not move. I helped him walk a bit, then he signaled me I better let him walk on his own. I was reluctant to, but I complied. After a few meters, I realized he backed out a few steps. I turned to him, Olena turned as well. A spider the size of a large dog came out from the canopy and stabbed him in the back, but he was still standing. Olena opened her mouth in terror, I could not move.



Dmitry spoke (I don't know how he was able to speak, since he was stabbed in the back.): ”Christ Is Victorious already. You need to accept to be victorious in Him. Go now! The Mother of God is with you. The Lord Himself is with you! Go now! And always remember: Christ Is Victorious!” And with that, he fell to the ground and the spider started devouring him. Something like an iron claw passed through my soul.



Olena broke out crying. I don't know how, but something pushed me. I took the gun from her and grabbed her arm and started running towards the first clear path we could see. The air was really thick, hard to breathe, not like a city smog, but like something else. It was a clear night, not very cold, but I felt like I was in a frozen giant basement cage, surrounded by a crowd of predators that allow me to live for a few more seconds not for my sake, but because they compete with each other to have me. 



The webs were all over the place, we could not just feel them almost all around, not just hear them, but also see them in the trees. We needed to run, if we stayed in one place, their mere presence would build up some sort of poisonous fear that would take over soon, the building up being unavoidable, even if they do not grab us. I lost track of sense and direction, I went into any clear passage between the trees. The torches kept them at bay for a little, only for a few moments. I knew that, if we stopped, they would gain courage and strength to take us, but it was enough. Olena cried muffledly. I felt her strength going down.



”Do not let go, sister, now. You remember how you saved me earlier? Now is my turn.” I said. ”God is with us. We should rely on Him now, there is no other way.” The last phrase came out of my mouth half without realizing it. For a second of disbelief, I looked out into the front of us. On the path, there was a big spider, almost two meters long. I saw no immediate escape. Olena felt feeble, like she just wanted to kneel and give up. I shouted: ”Lord protect us! Mother of God, cover us! Saint Demetrious, help us!” I was quiet for a second, then said gently: ”Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us, the sinners!” I fired the gun into the creature. I gave a horrible shriek, backed up, Olena stood up, like something gave her a boost of energy, of life, we saw another clearing and we ran towards there. 



We stumbled upon webs several times, only barely touching them. At one point. Olena got stuck with her shoulder in one web. It was nothing serious, but a spider the size of a dog came pretty fast. I managed to set the web on fire, before breaking Olena free. The fire started to spread pretty fast. They feared fire, as even light from a flashlight was probably unpleasant for them. Less than three meters away, the darkness ate away the light, it was surely not a natural darkness. I could not stare at it too much, as it made me feel like I was sinking into something unreal. In a way, it was like quicksand for the mind.



I almost stumbled several times. On the forest floor we often stumbled upon Human bones or piles of goo that had some leftovers like pieces of clothing, showing that they were part of a Human body.



We circled around several times, because we found ourselves again in front of the flames. They were more widespread, it was clear they hated all the fire, their shrieks turned into some type of screams that could easily break someone who is faint of heart, it was like they went into my very bones. The fire was our only hope. Olena was breathing heavily, it was clear that she could not resist too much.



I stopped for a few seconds and looked into her eyes. She tried to be tough, but she was clearly pretty close to giving up. I said: ”Look, they are afraid of fire. I do not know if it is to exit from this, but at least we can take down as many as we can. We have several Molotov cocktails. I shall hang the gun on my shoulder and ask your help in getting them out of my haversack, and light them up, to throw them into more places in the woods, to get as many of them down as possible. Do you think you can do it?” Olena looked faint at me. I crossed myself then I crossed her. ”Indeed, as Dmitry said, the Jesus Prayer helps. At my signal, light them up and throw them. Please, at least try.”



Olena smiled and tried to settle herself in the new arrangement and we left just as a pretty big Spider got close to us. We moved into an area that was far from the fire. I asked Olena to light up one of the bottles. It was really hard to do it while we walked, but she managed to. We soon had the chance, since there was a big one, in a tree, wanting to jump at us. I took the bottle and sent it into the spider. The tree got on fire fast and we ran. Olena seemed into some new energy state, but it felt like it was something from outside. We repeated it several times, the fire took over different parts of the forest.



The fear in my mind not just got stronger, but it started to blow like a wind. It felt huge anger from the creatures  that turned into hatred. We prayed the Jesus Prayer almost ceaselessly, just to keep us standing. Mentally, it was like running a marathon on a very narrow path, with the mountain slope on one point, and a deep precipice on the other. We finished the bottles and I started firing the gun over and over, as those things came more and more towards us, and faster. At some point, we remained out of bullets.



We were held by something, or someone. No way we could have survived and not break. We could have lost it or died one hundred times. At some point, Olena stumbled and fell to the ground. Her torch fell to the ground, as she laid down, breathing heavily. I tried to wake her up, she was clearly at the end of her strength. She went to sleep on the leaves.



At that moment, two things happened one through the other. A dark shadow, greater than the darkness I was already accustomed with covered us, and with thuds giant articulated legs surrounded us, covering almost the entire clearing. It was good that Olena fell to sleep then, and she did not face the giant beast above us. I did not dare to look at it, as drops of unholy toxic saliva fell upon us. I heard the chattering of a giant mouth ready to chew us at once in such haste, that it would not take its time to cover us into a cocoon and suck us. Even the invisible dark eyes felt like wanting to devour us, to suck us in a second, before the mouth reached us. I do not know how the stench did not make me pass out at once.



And the second thing was that, for a moment, I looked at one side of the clearing and I could see the field and the clear night sky.



”Mother of God, help us! Lord have mercy on us!” Perhaps my heart would have just stopped before the mouth ever touched me, when I heard a voice, perhaps in my mind, I do not know, the voice of Dmitry, who said: 



”Get up and place the torch into its mouth, then take the small knife from your boot and push it inside the enemy now!”



Perhaps my heart stopped beating, I do not know, I was already almost gone, but a terrible, yet amazing force took me up and made me push the torch inside my mouth. That force felt like a shield that protected us from death or from having our minds blown by the scream, so that I was able to get the knife out of the boot and stab the being close to the mouth. The torch fell to the ground, the creature stood up in pain and that invisible force made me or helped me take Olena in my arms, rise and start running, inside the tornado I was in. 



I do not know how I found myself out in the fields, running with Olena in my arms, sleeping. Unearthly screams were heard behind us, from the woods, and I heard the creature coming towards us, at an immense speed. I was like skydiving at a huge speed. I heard one last huge scream and a blast.



I stopped and looked back. The being exploded out in the fields, as the forest was on fire. I grabbed Olena and continued running. As we moved away from danger  my strength diminished. I let her down in the grass and tried to wake her up. She opened her eyes and gave a sigh.



”It is over.” I said. ”The Lord saved us. He worked through Dmitry. Praise be The Lord!” She started crying. I gave her a hug.
