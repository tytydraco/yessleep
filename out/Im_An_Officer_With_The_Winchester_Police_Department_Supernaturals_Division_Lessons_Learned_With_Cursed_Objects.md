"We're looking for *what?*" Rudy questioned as he hopped into the passenger side of my truck.

"You heard me," I smirked.

If you're new, you can read what I've been covering in my therapy sessions: [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/comments/1gpe8cd/guide_to_im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police/)

“I did,” he affirmed. “You said dispatch told you that we’re looking for a snowman?”

“Yup.” The trucks engine roared to life. We remained stationary until warm air blasted through the vents, heating up the cabin nicely. “Specifically on the corner of Maple and Turner Street.”

The revenant furrowed his brows. “What does that have to do with cursed objects?!”

An offended gasp left my mouth as I clutched some imaginary pearls. “Have you never seen *Frosty The Snowman?!*”

Rudy frustratedly pointed to his head. “Uh, hello, retrograde amnesiac over here!”

A chuckle escaped me as I pulled out of my space and the precincts parking lot. “Oops, sorry, keep forgetting!”

Mockingly, Rudy replied, “Oops, sorry, can’t remember anything!”

That earned him a hard stare and slight smirk from me.

With a huff, he dragged his knees up to his chest and looked out the window. After being on the road for a minute, he asked,“Where are we going? To check out that snowman?”

“Nope,” I popped the p.

“Then where?”

“To interview our witness.”

We pulled into the Winchester Regional Hospital ER parking lot about ten minutes later. I could only image the injuries one would sustain from a snowman attack.

Rudy and I actually managed to catch the paramedics that responded to the call on their way out. And did they have some words to say about our boy.

They wished us luck and said the caller had to be a cracked out nut job. Apparently, the garbage he was spewing was absolutely bat shit.  And the injuries he’d been admitted with had to be self inflicted because the extent of damage was impossible for the reported amount of time the guy was out there. Not to mention it was thirty-five degrees higher than the temperature required to get such wounds.

The nurses station agreed with the prognosis that this guy was insane. Two nurses were gossiping about how they thought the snowman attack could have been brought on by some type of schizophrenic delusion when we approached them. Another couple theories that were tossed out were that he’s either one of those freaks who have a fetish for amputation or idiot that intentionally harms themselves for insurance money.

I’m being so for real these kinds of people exits. Google it if you don’t believe me.

I told them I’d keep all that in mind before they guided us to the victim’s trauma bay.

Turns out Milo, the vic, was suffering from what looked like to be a severe case of frostbite on his hands. He also had bruises all over, a busted lip, and a black eye. That snowman really did a number on this guy.

The beginning stages of treatment had begun right before we arrived. Both hands, shriveled up and a grape shade of purple, were being submerged in warm water. Because the painkillers hadn’t kicked in yet and he was in immense pain, Mr. Briggs wasn’t exactly in the greatest of moods.

“Who the hell is this guy?” He questioned immediately after clocking Rudy.

“I’m Officer Hale,” I stuck out my hand to introduce myself, but quickly retracted it remembering his situation. As my cheeks flushed in embarrassment, Mr. Briggs gave me an unamused stare. “That is my trainee.”

Milo gave Rudy a good once over, eyeing him skeptically. “He’s supposed to be a cop? *Really?*”

“Anyone can be a cop, asshole!” Rudy grumbled from behind me.

“He hasn’t gotten his uniform yet,” I laughed awkwardly, elbowing my counterpart, making a mental note to lecture him about professionalism in the workplace.

“Ya find the bastard that did this to me yet?” Milo tsk’d.

“No, not yet sir,” I took my notepad out and readied my pen, “can you provide a thorough description of your assailant?”

Mr. Briggs grumbled in a tone that suggested I was dumb as a rock, “I know how it sounds, but it was a fucking *snowman.* You know what one of those are, right?”

I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. He’s lucky anyone was giving this the time of day. Any other police department without a Supernatural’s Division wouldn’t have given his call a second thought.

“Respectfully sir,” I countered, keeping Rudy from jumping the guy, “it’s Michigan in the dead of winter. Yours could be any one out of a thousand in the tri-state area.”

Milo crinkled his nose as he recalled the features of his attacker. “He had a carrot nose, two coal eyes, three buttons, a wide brimmed top hat with a red ribbon, and a matching scarf. Its stick arms had two miss-matching oven mitts. Like in *The Polar Express.*”

Black ink filled the page as the ball of my pen scratched against the grain of the paper. “In detail, can you describe your encounter and the events leading up to it? Did you provoke it at all?”

“Provoke it?!” Mr. Briggs yelled audaciously, jerking forward. He took a sharp breath in and winced as the harsh movement caused a jolt of pain. “IT WAS A SNOWMAN.”

“You got jumped by a snowman, dude,” I scoffed continuing to write down my notes. “You must’ve done something!”

“Yeah, saving a kid from getting run over by a car!” Milo admitted. “Next thing I know a snowman comes barreling out of nowhere and I’m on the ground, my hands turned to ice cubes! Last I saw, it was ushering the kid off into the woods.”

I pinched the bridge of my nose and frustratedly groaned. “Woah, whoah, now there’s a kid involved? And they were abducted by the snowman?”

Milo scoffed. “Oh, yeah, sorry I was too busy  *fending for my life* calling for help to mention it!”

I wanted to facepalm so bad. Could this guy be an even worse piece of shit? Something just wasn’t adding up here.

“I don’t believe you,” Rudy said voicing my thoughts aloud, squinting at Milo suspiciously.

“You calling me a liar?” Mr. Briggs challenged.

Rudy crossed his arms into his chest. “I ain’t calling you a truther!”

“Get the hell out.”

“Mr. Briggs, please-“ I said, glaring behind me at Rudy.

With his hands incapacitated, Milo’s only option was to nod to the door with his chin. “Out!”

“He’s hiding something.” Rudy muttered, pushing past my shoulder and making his way over to Milo’s hospital bed.

“Welcome to planet Earth, where everyone is hiding something,” I sighed. “How can you even tell?”

“Wh- what are you doing?!” Briggs questioned wearily. As Rudy reached the man’s bedside, he gripped the sides so hard his knuckles turned white.

“I just can,” the revenant replied.

As he leaned down, Milo started to squirm and wriggle under my rookie’s suffocating gaze. “What is he doing?!”

Intrigued, I stepped back, wanting to see where this went.

“Stop! Are you just going to stand there? Stop him!! Nurse? Nurse!!! Get away from-“

“**Tell the truth.**” Rudy demanded.

“Okay, okay!” Milo conceded. After taking a closer look, Mr. Brigg’s irises seemed to glow a faint shade of red for a couple seconds before going back to normal. “There really was a kid. But there wasn’t a car. I- I made it up! I was trying to get the kid to come back with me. But- but, I had a really good reason for it. I swear! It’s not what you think! No, that’s a lie too. I wanted him. *Needed* him. Almost had him too, then… then that *thing* attacked me!”

My nose curled up as an icky feeling pooled in my stomach. I was repulsed by the man’s forced confession.

A guttural snarl left my partner’s mouth. “You disgust me.”

I could only imagine Rudy revealed his true self to the man as a nasty hiss filled the room.

Milo Briggs sat there for a moment. Then he blinked and something in his mind clicked.“Ahhhhh! Ahhhh! AHHHH!” The man started screaming, knocking the two tubs over, spraying water everywhere as he flailed in his bed. He tried using his hands to rip out the IV, but the effort was fruitless. His hands were completely useless.

Mr. Briggs’s heart monitor started beating rapidly as the man continued to freak out. “He’s going to kill me! He’s going to kill me!!!!! Someone help!”

Rudy and I took the team of nurses and doctors rushing in to take control of the situation as our que to leave, hightailing it out of there. “Yup,” I smiled, patting one of the nurses’s shoulder on the way out, “he’s crazy!”

“What did you do?!” I semi-scolded my partner after getting back in my truck.

Rudy let out a deep breath. “I- I dunno.”

***

The car ride to the corner of Maple and Turner street was a long one. To ease some of the built up tension, I tried to put on some good tunes, but every station had annoyingly been taken over by Christmas music. So it was a quiet one too.

As we slowly rolled up and down the surrounding area in search for this supposed sentient snowman, Rudy grew increasingly frustrated. He made a comment about finding a needle in a haystack considering there were at least six visible on Maple street alone.

“Only one has kitchen mitts,” I said with a Triumphant smile, pulling up to a house with a snowman that fit the description sitting on the front lawn. Carrot nose, two coal eyes, three buttons, a wide brimmed top hat with a red ribbon, and a matching scarf with two sticks arms wearing miss-matching oven mitt gloves. We had found our snowman.

As we got out of the car, Rudy mumbled something about me living up to my nickname, which garnered a laugh out of me. It wasn’t luck, but a good bit of patrolling experience. You develop an eye for spotting the things you’re looking for. Something he’d learn in time.

“So this is our Frosty, huh?” I half-heartedly questioned the snowman, playfully elbowing Rudy in the arm.

He put his hands on his hips, looking it up and down, sizing it up. “Doesn’t look very cursed to me.”

I scoffed. “Lesson number two, rookie: don’t judge a book by its cover.”

Rudy stepped closer and poked the snow persons rotund midsection. “Does it eat the children it takes?”

My shoulders shrugged. “Maybe, but it looks like it’s not doing anything right now. Let’s go ask the homeowner about it and see if we can find out how it ticks.”

“Well, cursed or not, that’s one fugly motherfucker,” he said, tugging on both ends on the scarf. He pat the snowman on the chest twice before turning to meet with me.

“Rudy,” I scolded. Taunting the supernatural was never a good idea. Even if he himself was one of them. Unfortunately, he brushed my warning off.

The two of us had barely made it halfway to the driveway before my scolding had proven its merit.

A heavy thud came from beside me, followed by Rudy yelling out, “Ack!”

I turned to see what had happened, only to find a light dusting of snow covering the back of his jacket. On the ground beneath him was half a snowball with an icy center.

Something had thrown it at Rudy, and it was pretty obvious to us who. Rather in this case, what.

My hand flew to my mouth as I failed to stifle a chuckle. He grunted and glared at the snowman for a solid ten seconds. Of course it didn’t do anything, just stood there with its crooked stick smile. This only seemed to pissed  my partner off even more. He stormed up to the snowman, eyes briefly flashing red. “Why don’t you try that again tough guy?!” He shouted, winding his leg back in an attempt to topple it. A snap heard round the world rang out as his foot connected with the bottom ball.

A noiseless cry left Rudy’s mouth as he furiously hopped away from the snowman, whose core was just as icy as its snowballs.

“Told you so!” I laughed, wiping a tear from my eye before reaching out and grabbing his hand to keep him stable. “For real though, are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” he grumbled as I helped him walk, Rudy already able to put some weight on it.“It’ll heal.”

With one last glance at the snowman, we started for the driveway again.

*Thunk!* It was like a snowy firework had gone off as another snowball was fired. This time I was the intended target.

The breath was knocked out of me as a sharp stinging pain radiated out from the middle of my back.  My shoulders tensed and my teeth ground against each other as I bore through the shock and panic. It was Rudy’s turn to laugh as I suffered at Frosty’s mercy.

Laugh I did not. “O-Kay! That’s it-“ I yelled spinning around, rolling up my sleeves to go full fight mode. The pain of the hit pissing me off even more. But, as I turned around something was missing. The snowman was *missing*.

“What the-?” Rudy furrowed his brows in confusion.

I just huffed, blowing a stray strand of hair out of my face as the sharp stinging pain dulled into an ache. “That cursed enough for ya, Rudy?”

He tried running off in the direction he thought the snowman fled in, but I grabbed his wrist. “I know you’re mad, but shake it off. He’ll be back. In the meantime, let’s try and make ourselves useful and learn everything we can about this thing.”

Rudy resigned himself as we turned to the front door that belonged to the house’s lawn we were standing in.

“He’s dead, isn’t he?”The homeowner questioned solemnly after opening the door.

“*What?*” I was taken aback. “Who?”

The man looked frustrated as he explained,“My son. Did you people find him yet or not?”

I took a slight step forward, “Sir-“

“Oh my god, my son is dead, isn’t he?!” The man cupped his hands around his mouth as his eyes went wide. His shaking knees suggested he might fall down on them depending on the next words that came out of my mouth.

“Respectfully sir,” I started sincerely, “we don’t know. My partner and I are here to gather information. Can you explain in detail what happened to your boy?”

“Do I really need to say it again?” The homeowner let out a heavily exasperated sigh. “I already told those other guys…” He paused, as if something seemed to click. “Oh, *I get it!* This is some kind of joke, isn’t it? Ha ha ha, come to laugh at the crazy guy who thinks a stupid hat is responsible for his bad luck?!”

Before either of us could respond, the man went to slam his front door in our faces, clearly having gotten the wrong impression of us.

Rudy shoved his foot in the doorway, preventing it from shutting all the way. The gesture demanding the homeowner hear us out. “We believe you,” Rudy said, pushing the door back open.

My heart sank at those three words and I fought the intense urge to facepalm.  Rudy received a death glare from me, but chose to ignore it as the man invited us inside.

Staying cordial and in desperate need of information, I entered the house, deciding to reprimand him about his mistake later. He had just violated rule numero uno: *never* say or do anything that confirms civilian’s suspicions about the supernatural.

Something he should’ve known as a former hunter. However, except for a few useless tidbits that pop up every now and then (the curious case of Rudy the revenant everybody), he *is* suffering from major memory loss, so the least I could do was give him the benefit of the doubt. He didn’t know. Which, was an oopsie on my part and something I should’ve clarified before we began his training.

Anyway, after some tea and biscuits, here’s what we learned:

Jeff, the homeowner, has had that top hat locked in a trunk in his attic for the past decade. It’s a family heirloom that’s been passed down for generations in his family that apparently belonged to his great-great-great-and a couple more great’s-grandfather. Family rumor suggests bad things happen whenever the top hat leaves the trunk (which is probably warded and nulls the curse).

David, Jeff’s son, knew about the top hat in the trunk but not the lore behind it, seeing as he was only ten years old. Jeff didn’t want to scare his kid and give him nightmares, so he never divulged that information- not really believing in the “bad luck curse” to begin with.

One week ago, after a storm passed through and brought four inches of snow along with it, The Danvers family made use of the snow day for some extra bonding time. The father, son, and wife trio played out in the snow, finishing off the day’s wintery activities by building a snowman. Which they affectionately named Frosty.

Jeff had gone inside to whip up some of his famous hot cocoa when his son had run in really quickly. Jeff made little note of it and went back to cooking, meanwhile David deemed the top hat in the locked trunk to be the perfect accessory for their snowman and raced to the attic to get it. The kid jimmied the lock, grabbed the hat, then booked it back outside to his mom where they crowned Frosty.

Nobody knows what happened next, but David and his mom, Gloria, were missing when Jeff went to bring them their cocoa. The snowman, however, was right where they left it.

That’s when Jeff noticed what David had gotten from inside the house. The top hat. The *cursed* top hat. At that point in time as Jeff scanned the deserted street, he started to think that maybe it really did bring bad luck.

Then we were told the woman on the news that had died from hypothermia and exposure was none other than Jeff’s wife. Finding out his spouse had died all but confirmed his suspicions that the top hat was responsible for his severe bout of misfortune.

Jeff fully believed that she died that way because she was out searching vigorously for their son and was unluckily claimed by the elements. Rudy and I however, knew better. Frosty had become Killer Frosty.

Needless to say, Jeff is terrified of the headwear and refuses the take the top hat off the snowman or tear it down. Another reason, the man confessed, that he doesn’t want to see the thing destroyed is because there’s a sentimental value there. Making Killer Frosty was the last thing Jeff had done with his family as a whole unit. Dismantling the snowman would be like acknowledging the fact that his wife and son were gone. A reality Jeff wasn’t ready to accept yet.

The conversation was pretty much over after that. After a brief moment of silence, Rudy and I excused ourselves from Mr. Danvers residence and thanked him for his time.

Just as I had predicted, our snowy friend was back in the front yard, as if it hadn’t moved at all.

This is where Rudy did another big no-no. He *promised* Jeff that we would bring his son back to him, *safe and sound*, glaring out at the snowman as he did so.

Brought to tears, Jeff encapsulated the both of us into a huge hug and expressed his eternal gratitude.

We safely made it past Killer Frosty and back to my car, where I slammed my door. I was pissed. Rudy damn well knew we couldn’t guarantee the safe return of that child. And I made sure to remind him of it while I drove.

One severe reprimanding and lecture later I’m pretty sure Rudy got the gist.

“Where are we?” He asked as I put the truck in park. Those were the first words he’d spoken to me in the fifteen minutes since I finished chiding him. “This isn’t the precinct.”

“Yeah,” I said, pulling my usual work bun out, letting my hair fall down my shoulders. “I know.”

Rudy furrowed his brows before a look of revelation showed on his face. “Wait, is this the place you’ve been staying at?”

I nodded, taking my key out of the ignition and grabbing my portable work computer. The two of us hopped out of my truck before I led him to the room I’d been staying in.

“Don’t look at me like that,” I grunted after unlocking and entering my hotel room, giving Rudy the side eye. The look on his face said it all as he took in the dingy surroundings. “It’s cheap, plus I get a discount since I’m a cop.”

Rudy put his hands up defensively. “Hey, I didn’t say anything.”

“No, but you thought it,” I clapped back, grabbing two glasses of water and setting them on the little dining table that came with the room. I ran my hands through my frizzy hair after gulping down a glass, trying to relaxing a bit.

Rudy took a seat next to me, but only stared at his water. I’m guessing the liquid would’ve been more to his liking if it were a bit more red in color. He crossed his arms into his chest and leaned back, causing the old rickety chair to creak under his body weight. “What I’m thinking is, why didn’t we go back to the precinct?”

I opened my portable computer and started typing away. “Easy answer, Rookie. We’re on our own on this one.”

“What? *Why?*” he questioned. “We could really use Jane’s help right about now.”

My eyes glanced away from the computer screen and over to Rudy. I tapped the tip of my fingernail against the table three times. “She is precisely why we’re on our own,” was all I had to say on the matter.

Rudy sat there for a minute, rubbing his thumb over the thick stubble that had grown on his chin, contemplating. Meanwhile, I started looking through the Danvers case files. “Ohhhhh,” he said aloud, coming to a realization. “So this is a pride thing.”

“What? Psht, no it’s not a pride thing!” I sputtered out suddenly. Where had that conclusion come from?

“Hmm,” he said furrowing his brows together, looking me up and down. “So, you’re just scared of Jane, then?”

I scoffed uneasily, “*No.*” Then, feeling like a broken record, I repeated, “I’m not talking about this.”

Rudy just waved his hands up in defeat and chugged his glass of water.

With a heavy sigh, I slumped my shoulders and rubbed my hands over my tired eyes. Figuring this would be a good teaching moment, I called Rudy over so he could look at the layout of these reports and figure out how to read them.

But, when I looked over the computer he was no longer in his seat. Then, I almost went into cardiac arrest as Rudy’s warm breath blew on my scalp. He’d been standing behind me, looking over my shoulder.

“Sorry,” he sheepishly apologized with a nervous fang-filled grin as I caught my breath, “still not used to this enhanced speed thing yet.”

“Well, ya better figure it out,” I grumbled before pointing out the different sections of some reports and what information went where.

My already spoiled mood soured even more. As Rudy and I analyzed the Danvers case file further, we discovered that our WPD counterparts are lazy pigs.

Yet again, they had neglected to add any of the peculiarities Jeff had mentioned to them in their report, simply because they didn’t deem it important. Our side could’ve come out and handled this already, way before it ever got to this point. Now, after some investigating, it turned out there wasn’t one, but five other missing children. The best part? All of them lived on or around the same street as David Danvers. In addition, we were able to plausibly connect three other cases of frostbite and hypothermia with these other missing persons- the victims either being immediate family to the children or good friends. Long story short, Killer Frosty had been very busy that past week.

This case was starting to snowball and fast. Rudy and I needed to deal with this snowman now, not only for the children’s sake, but because of the naive promise my partner had made. Lord knows the kind of hellfire that would rain down on the division if we couldn’t follow through on it.

The good thing was that we knew where our subject “lived” so to speak. Our only problems being this entities seemingly ability to teleport and the fact we didn’t know the location where it was taking the kids it abducted- or if it was taking them anywhere at all. There was still a good possibility Killer Frosty was, ya know, *killing* these kids.

My mind spun as I closed the computer, thinking of all the ways things could go wrong. For example, according to the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children, the first forty-eight hours a child is missing are the most crucial for finding them. Now imagine how good the probability of finding them is after a week. Yeah, basically, we didn’t have the best odds here.

I stood up and went to refill my glass of water, needing to do some type of repetitive task to keep my mind from spiraling.

“Jesus!” I yelped, startled, my glass dropping and shattering on the floor. Rudy had once again snuck up behind me. “Are you *trying* to kill me?”

He set the empty glass he was holding down in the sink- the reason he’d been standing behind me in the first place- carefully stepping around the shards on the floor.  “Sorry,” he apologized again, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.

“It’s okay,” I sighed, grabbing a broom and dustpan to clean up the mess. “If only you could be tracked so you can’t sneak up on me anymore,” I joked.

“Like a bell or Apple air tag or something,” Rudy chuckled.

My eyes went wide as an idea popped into my head. “Rudy, you’re a genius! I could kiss you right now!” I cheered, dropping everything to grab his face and squish it.

Our eyes met for one very long second and a weird feeling filled my chest.

After registering the words that had left my mouth, my hands fell to my side. Quickly, I backed away and cleared my throat. A wave of heat filled my cheeks and made them look flushed.

*As if I’d* ever *do that!* I thought to myself. In an attempt to cool down, I grabbed my hair and wrapped it back into a bun.

Rudy also cleared his throat and wiped his nose, hiding his own blush. After the two of us composed ourselves he managed to coyly look me in the eye and say, “so, you were saying I’m a genius?”
