I watched those gold eyes of the braided man look to a hallway behind me lined with doors. Then I looked back at the braided man. 

*He was gone.* I was twisting the knife into nothing, standing in the room by myself. 

I heard a scream come from where the braided man told me my friend’s were being tortured. I took a deep breath and did my best to get my brain to keep being brave for the first time ever in my life. 

I made it to the first door where the screaming was coming from. I could tell it was John. It motivated me to get in there as quickly as possible. 

Inside, the door I saw John on the ceiling, hanging face down, strapped to the top of the room with white rope. His eyes burned down at me with a pain and fear I had never seen in my entire life. 

I also saw a small golden crucifix in his hand, he was grating it against the straps, clearly trying to cut his lashings, but not making much progress. 

I also saw something in front of his head - a fuse, with a very slow flame heading down it, close to John’s face. I also noticed right above John’s head, some packaging, assumedly some kind of explosive. 

My brain jumped quickly - Larry’s knife. I jumped up and started cutting John down. 

I checked that fuse. It was getting damn close to John when I still had some more to cut. *Shit. Shit. Shit.* 

I started cutting as fast as I could and watched as John frantically used the crucifix as a cutting object. Together, we beat the fuse and John dropped off of the ceiling. 

John and I ran out of the room and were back in the hallway. John was asking how I knew what was going on. I didn’t answer. I just said we had to split up and go into the nearest rooms and get our other friends out as fast as we could. 

I went into the nearest room and found complete darkness. The door closed behind me before I could do anything and I could find the door handle. 

My search for the door was stopped when I heard a familiar voice cry out for help. It was my friend Steven. He was in pain somewhere in the room. 

I didn’t say anything. I was savvy enough at this point to know not to draw attention to myself and to avoid doing things which could alter the set up Steven was likely in the midst of. 

I had a third epiphany related to Larry though. He had me hold his lighter the night before while he was talking to someone and smoking. I cracked it and could see where I was. 

That crack of light from the lighter showed that I was in a dark room that seemed to go on forever. There was endless darkness all around me - no signs of walls. The only thing I could see was Steven in the middle of the room, blindfolded, with his arms tied behind his back.

I moved swiftly and reached Steven, going to work on the lashings on his wrists. Out of the corner of my eye, I immediately saw white walls appear all around us, off in the distance. 

They moved in on us quickly as I worked on the lashings, almost getting them off and ignoring Steven repeatedly asking me what was going on. 

I ignored him and just kept working on the lashings, getting them almost off, quickly, but also extremely stressed by how quickly the walls were coming in on us. I didn’t have some relief though in spotting where the door was on one of the walls. We at least had a shot to get out. 

I got the lashings off. I got Steven’s blindfold off just in time for us to see the walls about 10 feet away from us on each side, and slowly moving in on us. 

I grabbed Steven’s hand and rushed him for the door. I grabbed the door handle, praying it was unlocked…

It was. We spilled back out into the hallway. We ran right into John and my other friend, Darren - both of whom were covered from head to toe in blood. 

“Don’t ask,” John yelled. 

John ran for the exit to the outside of the boat and we all followed. We quickly found night had fallen and we were driving by the dock we boarded on at the banks of the French Quarter. 

Based on how fast the boat was going, we weren’t stopping at that dock. We only had one choice and John led the way again. He climbed up onto the railing of the boat and jumped off. 

The rest of us followed suit. 

I made it to the shore. John and the others were there - all looking back at the river. We all looked in amazement as *we didn’t see any boats on the water.*

The four of us started to try and make sense of what happened as we walked back toward the hotel and I explained the grave situation with the other guys. We discussed Larry. We were sure he had to have been killed at some point,.

We were very worried that while we escaped the situation we were in, it wouldn't be the end of it, but I had an idea. We went and found the ghost tour guide from the night before. 

I explained to the guide what happened. He had a solution. I took out a ton of cash, wrote a note, put it in an envelope with instructions to use it to rebuild the wrecked grave and slipped it underneath the door of the cemetery office. 

I also lit a candle and paid my respects at the grave site. 

The guide couldn’t guarantee that would do the trick, but it was the best option we had. 

We went back to the room drained, defeated, and ready to just go home, but figuring we were instead going to have to go on another odyssey, trying to figure out what happened to Larry. 

Much to our shock, Larry was in the room, sipping beer when we walked in.

“Where the fuck were all of you?” Larry asked as soon as we walked in. 

None of us answered. We just retreated to wherever we could sleep. 

“I don’t know about you, but I had a great time. Got fucked up, talked to this little blonde honey…

That was the last thing I heard before I drifted off to sleep.

Time has passed and nothing bad has happened since which seems connected to that time in New Orleans. I’ve never gone back and all of my friends are well, including Larry, who actually somehow got married and had kids. 

I’ve kept my side of the bargain though, maintaining one of the things the ghost tour guide told me to do for years now…

In the back of my closet in my bedroom, there’s a shrine, with a photo of the braided man sculpture I took at the remains of the grave when we went back there. Each night, I go back there and light a candle and say sorry into his golden eyes. 

*It’s seemed to work so far.*
