Often times, when you reflect back to your childhood, the memories blur. 

I mean I can recall some moments, here and there. Compared to most, I actually had an okay family...

It saddens me to think about it. 

There was a day, or rather a night that changed everything for me. I don't know why it happened or whatever the fuck it was. I just remember it, and no one believed me...

I mean of fucking course, right? Shit like that just isn't real. And if it is, well fuck me for not wanting to believe it Thomas, right!?!

*Sighs*

No one believed me. 

I wouldn't bother telling you, whoever you are, if I didn't feel like my days were numbered...

I've been seeing them, it. Again. I'm getting tired of running, avoiding it. I don't know anymore, I don't know if I'm crazy but, at this rate, I'll be getting there...

I want it to be known.

My name is Thomas Hidgkins, I was uh, six maybe seven at the time. The day had just been wrapping up. I got home from school, started some of my homework, and played with some of my action figures. 

*Chuckling*

Oh, and Milo was there too... It was no one special, just my teddy bear. Yeah... I'm just gonna say it, he was my best friend at the time. Well, one of them. There's just something about having someone, or well, something being there for you and listening to you... 

We had played for a time, all of the time really. We'd whip up a wide array of scenarios, all the way from robbing banks to saving princesses... Was never a dull moment then...

My Dad popped in, and he had gotten me the Xbox I had been asking for. Many of the other kids have something similar. They'd talk about how fun it was to play online, I never did get around to that part... 

Needless to say, I had dropped what I was doing and spent the rest of the afternoon playing on it. I was even allowed to eat dinner in my room for once. The time flew by, and before I knew it, it was bedtime. 

I turned off the Xbox and went to brush my teeth. Mom made sure of it, constantly reminding me of what my teeth could look like had I opted, not to care for them. She always made sure I was taking care myself, she'd practically engrained it in me. After having done that, I went back to my room and got in bed. 

Something was missing though, Milo. As I crawled atop my bed, I realized that...

I sometimes wish I hadn't turned around, I often wonder if it even would've made a difference. I mean, I doubt it but I still can't help but entertain that idea... 

There was a time, where I blamed myself. I still do to some extent though, well, it's not like it matters anymore...

When I turned around, Milo was right where I left him. Slumped over on the carpet surrounded by the toys we had setup. I never went to bed without him, so naturally, I got out of bed and reached for him. 

I had never felt such a sudden rush of fear before. There's something about seeing something or hearing something, so terribly wrong... 

Some thing else reached for him too...

In that moment, I hadn't payed any mind to the opened, closet door, just a few feet behind him. There was never any reason to, you know. I wasn't afraid of the dark, mainly because I didn't really have to deal with it. I always had a night light and never had a reason to leave the room. 

The light kept my room well lit, you'd think monsters only ever operate in the dark, except this one didn't. The light didn't stop it from grabbing Milo... I froze when I saw it.

That closet was darker than it was suppose to have been. Normally the night light's, light would've reached in, but it didn't, it couldn't. I didn't see it, I was in so much disbelief that, well, my mind must've blanked out for a second. 

I could only see Milo, just sliding into the closet, except I knew, he didn't just slide up in there, and even if he did... That's just not normal...

I recoiled back into my bed! I was scared shitless, so much so that I couldn't even call out to my parents. My heart was pounding so heavy that it felt like it was going to just pump right out of my chest, and I felt this suffocating feeling, I was stuck between wanting to act and just, freezing.

I was tempted to go under the blanket and hide away. To pretend it wasn't there, and that maybe, it'd just go away. And I would've if it wasn't for that strange feeling... I couldn't look away. And the longer I looked at it, I got a gut wrenching feeling telling me, not to look away.

Not to look away from the closet. And so, I didn't, and I didn't move. I watched and just, waited. I don't know what for, but that moment felt like forever, like it was never going to end. 

I guess it got tired of waiting, it must've figured that I wasn't going to go into that closet, that I wasn't getting off my bed, because the my closet's doors creeped further open. Milo sat upright and was gently pushed out of the closet. He slumped over right by the edge of the closet's entrance. 

Again, I believe I saw something, saw something coaxing Milo out of the dark. Maybe it was it's arms, hands, it was something! It was oddly quick and bent in unnatural ways, like it needed to! Like the closet's confines couldn't contain whatever was within. I can see it when I think about it, but when I try to remember it when I try to describe it, I just can't. It's almost as if I'm not allowed to...

With Milo sitting outside the closet, being placed there, it was clear to me. There was! Something in that fucking closet. It wasn't my imagination, it was really there! I figure that tipped me over the edge because despite that fear, despite being terrified enough not to, I managed to stuttered a scream for my parents. 

When I heard their steps racing against the wooden floors, I took a chance and leapt out of bed. Dashing for my bedroom door. As I opened it, I was met with the sight of my worried parents. Both of whom, frantically asked me what was wrong.

I wasted no time in telling them, I saw a monster in my closet and it took Milo. Despite me, remaining fearful, my parents nerves eased as they figured nothing serious, was wrong.

I had never done anything like that, screaming for them in the night... I'm guessing they were glad it was just some figment of my imagination, maybe just some, bad dream. It wasn't...

As my Dad picked me up, the two of them walked into my room. I hadn't noticed it, but the closet door had been closed and Milo was placed atop my bed, like he was there all along. When my mother grabbed my teddy bear, Milo. 

She told me, in a reassuring tone, as if I couldn't see it for myself, "Thomas, Milo's right here."

I was so fixed on what I had seen, I didn't recall going to sleep. It wasn't a dream, I know it wasn't and I sure as shit wasn't staying in that room and not with Milo. I don't remember why, I just knew I didn't want to be around him. 

Maybe it was because he'd be a constant reminder of what I saw, maybe... I didn't know...

I wasted no time in reaffirming what I saw. Recounting every detail as best I could...

*Sighs*

If only they'd believed and we'd have left right then and there. Maybe things would be different...

It was clear to them that I wasn't going to be able to sleep anytime soon, especially, by myself. My parents took me to there room and I opted to leave Milo behind. I didn't know what to think at the time, I just knew I felt safe. Protected. As we went back to their bedroom, they nestled me in-between them.

To reassure me, my Dad said, "Don't worry Thomas, you're not gonna see any monsters in here."

And Mom went on to tell me, "Goodnight Thomas."

For a few moments all seemed fine, Dad was soon off to snoring and so was Mom. Despite that, I couldn't help but stay up for a bit. I didn't dare move let alone look around, I didn't want to risk seeing it again. I closed my eyes, telling myself, it's okay and that I'll be fine, and that maybe, just maybe, it was, just in my imagination. I found comfort in the snores of my parents. My worries were eased by it. Knowing that they could sleep, I felt that maybe, I could too.

That moment of reprieve was short lived... I was woken up by the shuffling of my Dad, his movements led to him pinching the skin on my arm. We all sat up...

"Jacob! Look-Jacob!! Look!!" Shouted Mom, as she frantically pointed at the closet door.

My Dad switched the lamp on and rubbed his eyes.

As he looked at where Mom had pointed, their closet door was easing open. It was slow, so slow that you might've thought it was just your imagination. Except, after a while, it was clear that it wasn't. You'd be sure to notice the growing distance, at some point. We all watched in silence as it did. 

My Dad was quick to get his gun out of the night stand. He must've assumed it to be a burglar or something. He aimed at the closet door, and said, "You better come out slowly! If I gotta go in there It aint gonna be pretty!"

The door abruptly stopped and creaked loudly in response. 

Those pale mangled arms bared itself again and this time, it again, placed Milo just outside the closet door. My parents froze for a moment, I figure they couldn't believe it. I figure the thoughts racing in there mind led them to freeze...

After it placed that teddy bear down, I started to look toward my Mom. I could've swore I heard her whisper my name. I had thought she intended to question me, to confirm that this, was what I was talking about.

 Except, when I turned to my answer my Mom, she wasn't even looking at me, and her mouth was closed. With widened eyes, she stared at that closet... She didn't say my name. We all looked at one anther for a moment. 

After we all heard, loud shots rung in my ears. My Dad had emptied his gun into that closet. We didn't hear anything, or see anything happen. It was just eerily quiet, and it would've been for some time had it not been for my Mom.

"Jacob, wh-where's the window?"

My Dad was a bit dumbfounded by the question, he looked to where she pointed again. There was just a wall there. My Dad cautiously got out of bed, and stared at that barren wall.

He paused for a moment, no doubt wondering on what, just happened. It's like he expected that window to come back, or questioned if there was even a window to begin with. It was only when he had noticed the bathroom door vanished too, did he react. 

I'm not sure I would've done the same, I don't think I'd have been able to grasp and let alone accept what I was seeing. But they, did...

My mother had carried me, and together we all ran out of that room. I didn't catch on then, but later on in life, I realized it. Our exits were slowly disappearing...

As we navigated through our house as rooms were suddenly just, vanishing. When we dashed down the stairs, we all looked to the front door, just whisk itself out of reality. I mean, it's what I saw, I didn't blink. It was just there, like it should've been and in that same second, it was just gone. 

My Mom and Dad heard something on the stairs and looked back up. The sounds of multiple steps raced loudly down the stairs. I didn't get a chance to see it, my Dad had snatched me from Mom and ran toward the living room window. It hadn't disappeared like the rest yet. 

As we ran, I heard my Mom's rising scream get silenced by a few sickening, cracks. The sound of bones snapping echoed through out the darkness. Each break was louder, it had lingered in my ears and froze my blood.

When Dad brought me to that window, he threw me as hard as he could at it. I was confused and scared at the time. My Dad had this horrid look on his face, riddled with fear and desperation...

Did he know?

I mean, how did he know to do that? Could've been luck? 

I'm not sure if I should be thanking my Dad or cursing him...

When I flew out that window, I saw the darkness swallow my Dad. More crunches of bone followed his agonizing scream. His face was peeling and stretched in violent way. I had closed my eyes out of fear. When I hit the ground, I opened them and screamed. 

I was laying in the grass with a broken arm and a few cuts. I hadn't realized my injuries, I didn't really feel them... I mean, I felt the subtle stings from the cuts, but not the arm...

Maybe I was to fixed on the window I'd just been tossed through. I mean, I looked at the window and it was just, it wasn't broken. I looked for my any sign of my Dad.

He wasn't there. My Dad wasn't there.

It was dark but I could still, barely make out living room, I could see the shadowed silhouettes of the furniture, or at least, I thought I did. I'm sure I did, becausen not long after, there was a moment when I couldn't see them. 

It was there...

I realized it was still there, and that I needed to get away. When I tried to lift myself, it was then I realized that my arm had been broken. It was broken in multiple spots along my arm, bent and twisted into an odd ringed shape. 

My entire was disfigured, I grew uneasy just looking at it. It was like arm had twisted and looped like a clay noodle that had hardened...

I had stepped back and started running toward the street with tears running down my face. I would've ran further, to somewhere, if I hadn't heard my house's front door open, I couldn't help but slow and look back.

It too, was shadowed by an abyss-like darkness. The opening door triggered the motion light on the porch's overhang. I should have been able to see inside, to see what was there, but I couldn't. 

When I got ready to run on, it did something...

Terribly, disfigured versions of my Mom and Dad peaked from the front door's darkness and beckoned me to come closer. They'd been seriously fucked up and it, was using them...

You'd might've expected me to have been happy or to run toward them but I didn't. My parents swayed and called as though they were being puppeteered...

Those weren't my parents... It couldn't have been. Or maybe, through all that agony, they were there, calling for me...

I don't know what to do anymore, I've been in and out of foster care homes ever since, still dealing with the thing... Thing is, no else see's it. I mean, it can't just be me. Me and my parents saw it too. There's no way we all could've just imagined it together...

It keeps coming still, and every fucking time it shows, it's, what ever it is, arrives from darkness and is constantly reaching for me, calling me with their faces... their voices... 

And each time, it gets closer... 

I fear that soon, it wont be confined to the darkness it resides in...

I fear, that it'll reach a point where it doesn't matter where I am, or what I'm doing...

Know that I was here...
