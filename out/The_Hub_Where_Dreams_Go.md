Have any of you ever been to the hub where dreams go? If you know what I mean then you'll probably be writing a reply in your head right now, but please. Finish reading this first. I may not be able to explain it as accurately as I'd like, but I'll do my best. 

So for some background, my dreams haven't always been as vivid, or coherent as I've always heard other people describe theirs. After a good bit of time having extremely traumatic and persistent nightmares as a kid, sleeping became a scary thing honestly. However, as I grew up that slowly changed. 

My dreams usually consist of the kind of stuff you would see in a children's sketchbook. Impossible things happening in mundane places. Being treated by everyone as if it's normal. 

Or the occasional dream about being a kid again, and sitting on the kitchen counter with that indescribable feeling of dread and impending danger. 

Plus after that period of nightmares, I wasn't as much of a dreamer. Most of the time when I sleep it's like I've just shut my eyes for a fair bit of time, and then go about my day as normal. 

However, for the past few weeks I've been dreaming about a place that seems a lot more real than it should. So I decided to post it here to see if anyone else has experienced this, and might have some answers for me on how I can solve the issues I've seem to come across. 

So one night I go to sleep, and at first my dream starts out like they usually do when I actually do dream; with me just kinda being in a random place. Knowing why I'm there, and how I got there. This was much different though. 

It was insanely vivid. Not like the lucid dream sense that I was aware I was dreaming, but in the strange and nostalgic sense. Almost like I had gone back to the old playground I used to go to everyday as a kid, just now I'd be an adult. 

I was walking toward a building, and I was with two different people. A woman who seemed to be around my age, and a much older looking man. 

The woman was a bit pale, sporting a similar style like that of an old girlfriend of mine. She seemed incredibly excited, and gave off the whole "punk rock" vibes. She seemed so familiar, even if I was having trouble making out her face.

The old man would remind you of Vincent Price, but replace his iconic pencil moustache with a salt and pepper beard. He was leading us to this extremely tall, and wide building. 

It looked like an office building or a school almost. It's exterior was tan and above these huge glass doors were these blackened metal letters that spelled "Where Dreams Go" that reflected the moonlight off of them. 

The old man had a warm, and inviting smile on his face. He gestured to the glass doors and the young woman who accompanied me practically darted towards them. Flinging them open quickly, gesturing for me to follow behind her. 

The doors gave a quiet squeak after the loud clunk those weird push door handles make when you open them. With that sound I had suddenly realized just how quiet everything had been. 

On our way over there wasn't a sound to be heard, so the lound clunking noise seemed amplified a decent bit, but even still. The building seemed so vaguely familiar I couldn't resist following behind the girl.

As we stepped through the threshold the buildings inner lights came to life with a dull whirring sound, before it evened out and became unnoticeable, and I can't tell you just how awestruck I was. 

We had stepped into this large, round, and warm room. The floors were the same tan color as the outside, but made of tile that reflected the overhead lights. The walls were the same color, but appeared to be more like brick work, or even kinda like the ceilings I used to stare at as a kid; with that same pattern of bumps and ridges. 

I cannot overstate how big this room was. This one space seemed like it shouldn't have fit within the building. That's when I noticed different colors. 

Behind different sliding glass doors were lights that shined different colors, and right then a voice echoed off the walls over what sounded like a bad PA system. 

"Please refer to color index and maps located by each DreamSpace entrance" said the phantom voice. It sounded like another woman speaking, or more accurately; the robotic voice of an automated message. 

I noticed what it was referencing though. Not far from where we stood was what looked like an interactive map. Kinda like the ones you'd see in those fancy malls. 

It had a selection of color coded rooms, and each one themed around something different. The colors seemed to represent what kind of DreamSpace we'd be going to. 

Blue seemed to represent calm, and collected things. Each room associated with them had similar things in them. Collections of water with ocean life, little rooms filled with books. Old wooden mansions that were empty; perfect to be explored. 

Pink was nostalgia. Old arcades, or toy stores long abandoned. Some rooms on the map looked like indoor playgrounds or collections of brightly neon colored pipes and slides.  

Green was wealth. Which from that alone I'm sure you can make your own assumptions about what would be in the green spaces, and since I've yet to attend one of those rooms I couldn't tell you exactly. 

Purple seemed to be romance and love. Reconnecting with an old fling from years gone by, or meeting someone you'd feel incredibly safe with. Like you had known them all your life. 

Orange and yellow seemed to be very similar. Representing warm, and inviting places. Like having your head in your mom's lap on a calm night in July, or playing with your siblings in the back yard; before that childhood innocence was gone.

However, the color red wasn't on the map. Something I didn't pay much mind to then, and didn't even realize for a fair amount of time. 

The map had that vaporwave aesthetic to it, and it was a good indicator for how to get to where I wanted to go. I suppose it's also important to note here that a lot of this is incredibly difficult to explain because since this was a dream it followed the same kind of dream logic you'd expect. 

Like things being in different places than they were before, or touching certain sections on the map seemed to almost just make them appear there. Sometimes you could walk in a straight line, only to end up where you began. 

The woman I was with seemed to fixate on the blue sections, so that's where we went first. Neither of us spoke much, if at all. So once we got there and I heard her shout "Dude" incredibly loudly I knew it was going to be something to remember. 

There was a glass door. Similar to the entrance doors, but this one was sliding open as we approached. Inside were these huge walls of salt water. Underfoot was sand like at a beach. 

There were no barriers between the water, and the two of us. So we could literally reach out and put our hands into this suspended ocean. The smell of saltwater and fish filled my nose immediately. 

The woman reached out and felt the walls of cool liquid with the palm of her hand, drawing it back once she realized this wasn't your everyday aquarium. 

"This is so cool" she said as a school of fish passed by just a few inches away. Finding ourselves dumbstruck by the impossible sight, we made our way down this long stretched hallway kind of thing.

Giant whales were making noises I can't quite describe, and small octopi were scudding across the floor. Their colors changing as they roamed about, before re-entering the water and darting away. 

I reached out into the water and felt a small string ray as it came up to us. It seemed curious as it approached, and when my hand came into contact with it, it didn't flee away. It seemed like it was exposing it's underside so I could pet it. 

It's body was smooth, and felt similar to wet rubber, but much less rigid. As I rubbed the belly of this gorgeous little creature a larger shark seemed to come by; causing the ray to quickly swim back into the darkness of the distant water. 

The long hall sandwiched between these walls of sea water stretched for what seemed like forever, and as we explored we had to mind not to step on the other small lives beneath our feet. That of starfish, hermit crabs, and nudibranches. 

We could have explored for an eternity it seemed like, but we wanted to see what else this place had to offer so we found the nearest map, and decided to see where we could go from there. 

We ended up wanting to go to two different places. The young woman wanted to go to a room in the pink section, while I wanted to go to the orange section. We decided on splitting up, and meeting back up again before we left. Landing on that central hub we had first seen. 

As she walked away her features became more noticeable. She had messy hair, with bangs like you'd have as an emo kid in highschool, and she wore a band shirt. Until then I hadn't really been able to focus on her appearance, but now she seemed so much more familiar, but I still couldn't place my finger on it. 

Nevertheless, she walked away. Leaving me to explore on my own. It was about then I realized just how empty this place really was. Outside of the DreamSpaces the utter isolation almost felt surreal. Like I was somewhere I shouldn't be. 

As I walked to my decided room, I noticed this one didn't have a door. I followed the maps instructions, but I just kinda ended up there. I can't explain this right and I've sat and typed it out over a dozen times; only to delete what I've typed out and start over. So this is the closest approximation, just remember that even this isn't accurate whatsoever. 

It was like I was walking across the large hub room, and both slowly and suddenly somehow I was back in my old home. As if in both a few moments, and a few minutes the room shifted from the hub, to the place where I grew up. I shifted from being an adult, to being a child, and went from walking to somehow rolling over on the couch. 

My head was resting on the arm of the couch, and my feet where in my mom's lap. She was young again, and rubbing my feet the way she did when I'd get muscle spasms as a kid. Singing my lullaby to me like she did when I was sick. 

The feelings of these dreams will be the hardest to describe and convey usually, but this one is by far the simplest. I was content. Beyond content actually. 

Everything felt right again. The memories of my stressful life beyond that moment were gone, and everything was so comfortable. I was incredibly warm, wrapped in my old blanket. Watching the TV while my older brother cooked for us. 

I desperately didn't want to leave that spot. It was like the dream had taken one of my most inviting memories and brought it back to reality. I could smell the spaghetti sauce in the air, and almost taste the medicine that my memory at the time said I had taken a few minutes prior. 

My brother walked into the living room with a bowl of spaghetti, some slices of toast, and a big can of coke. I sat up, and I swear the taste of the food is something that if I think about now almost makes me emotional. It was like I was really back home. 

My brother sat with us on the couch and we talked about my day at school. He told me about how he was thinking about asking out the woman whom he is now married to. I slurped my spaghetti and gnawed at my bread while taking in everything he said. 

When I started to get that nostalgic feeling. That feeling you get when going through old photos, but this one was mixed with something else. I hugged my mom and brother both, coming to the understanding that I had to leave, yet still with a childlike mind I didn't want to go. I begged them to not make me go. They kept saying I didn't have to go anywhere, but in the end. I had made an agreement to meet up with that woman after we finished. So I had to snap back from this slice of heaven. 

Then just like before, I was back in the hub. Reaching into the air for my now missing family members. Letting out a soft sigh I looked around, not quite finding the person I was with. So I made my way back to that initial map. 

On my way back I got this strange feeling in the pit of my stomach. Like I was being watched from somewhere. I stopped and looked back to where I had been walking just a moment before. Noticing that far down the hall there seemed to be a small patch of the hub that was different. 

While up until this point everything was perfect and pristine. In a corner; for just a moment, I could have sworn I saw filth. Like the floor tiles and masonry had began to harbor mold, and started crumbling away. After a second glance I realized I was wrong, but it did shake me a bit. 

I brushed it off, and continued back to the hub map. She was waiting for me. Smiling a soft smile my way when she saw me approach. Waving to me with some eagerness. The old man sitting across from her gave me an almost depressing feeling. For some reason I knew him being there meant we had to leave before either of them spoke. 

"Did you find what you were looking for?" Asked the young woman who's name I still couldn't remember. 

I nodded in reply before asking "Yeah, what about you?" glancing over toward the older man that flashed me a smile and nod of his head. 

The woman nodded eagerly and bounced a bit, shouting "I did! It was awesome!" in an almost childish kinda way. 

We looked over at the old man, and he stood up. Walking stick in his hand, he tapped it on the floor quietly, and said "It's time to leave" in this strangely soft, but simultaneously powerful voice. 

The man; who's name I understood to be Keeper,  gestured toward the glass entrance. A neon exit sign flashed to life, and the young woman pouted. 

"Do we have to go? Keeper I really want to go to just one more room!" Like she was pleading her parents to stay up just a little longer on a school night. 

"Sadly, yes. However, you can always come back. This is the Hub where dreams go, and everytime you dream, they end up finding their homes here!" he replied almost excitedly. 

"Wait, I'm asleep right now?" I asked. Incredibly confused. I had yet to realize we were dreaming, and I know it's insane to think any of these things were normal, but keep in mind. Dream logic always wins. 

The old man nodded, and gestured to the doors once more. "Please, visit us again any time you'd like. We always welcome company" before the two of us practically hung our heads, and headed for the door. The sudden realization I was dreaming gave me that stirring feeling. 

I woke up, and recalled the dream. Which is even more unusual for me considering I always forget my dreams not long after starting my day. 

However, as I smoked my first cigarette of the day, and got some caffeine in me the thought couldn't seem to leave my mind. All throughout the day I keep seeing hazy images of the girl, the big hub, and the old man. 

It was so vivid to the point I could have sworn I still had grains of sand on my shoes. Chopping I up to just be a wild imagination from the combination of stress, too much weed, and the habit of staying up late to listen to horror channels on YouTube. 

The next few days were the same as usual, sleep, wake up with nothing notable happening, and rinse and repeat. That is until around the fourth night came along. I layed down for bed as usual. Instead of tossing and turning, however, I found myself drifting into sleep fairly quickly. 

Once again, I found myself approaching an all too familiar building with that same woman. As we approached I was getting excited. It was a feeling almost like the two of us knew a secret no one else did. It's crazy to say I was thinking with the same view I had about everything when I was six years old. 

This time she took my hand and ran towards the building once we saw the old man, shouting  "Keeper! Keeper! We're back!" with the same glee you'd have when you would be visiting your grandparents. 

He nodded, and smiled. "I knew you would be" coming from his lips in the same tone of voice as before. The girl let go of my hand and made her way to the door. Waving for me to follow her, and I did. Taking one last glance at the old man; only to find he had vanished. 

Once again, unaware I was dreaming I had that same excitement as before. It felt like I was with an old trusted friend, visiting a theme park made just for us. As we walked into the central hub room the girl grabbed my hand again. 

"Don't leave me this time!" she said sternly. Giving me this kind of mock grumpy look. 

I nodded, and held onto her hand. It was very warm, which is kind of odd for me. I don't know about you guys, but whenever I have a dream and touch stuff it feels kind of like I'm touching something with melted candle wax on my finger. 

However, this didn't feel artificial at all. Her hand was warm, and her palm was soft. Her fingernails weren't that long, but almost dug into the skin of my hand. 

We made our way to the map again; trying to decide where we wanted to go. She spoke up to say "let's go here!" pointing to a room in the pink section. I gave it a light tap to see how to get there and once again I made a realization. A pink strip on the floor that wasn't there before was leading across the room. 

It was like when I had gone to the Orange room, but different somehow. It appeared, but it didn't. It was there, but it wasn't. It faded in, but at the same time it just popped up. Like I've said. Dream logic. 

So we followed this pink strip. The girl being ahead of me just a bit while I followed behind like a lost duckling. As we approached the glass doors where the pink strip ended we both looked at eachother and asked in unison "isn't that where the ocean room was?" before she let out a quiet giggle. 

I looked back to the doors, and from behind them it looked like just an empty corridor. However, in this dream world, with dream logic, and dreamed memories in my head I somehow knew that when we'd go in that it would be an incredibly aesthetic and nostalgic place. 

The doors slid open with a quiet whir, and exactly like how the Orange room worked for me, we were in this old toy store. An all too familiar, yet all too foreign toy store that I felt like I had seen somewhere. Even now, I still feel like I've been there, and not in this dream world. 

So the walls were a purple color, with hints of neon blue lights shining off of them. The neon lights coming from a sign that at first I couldn't read or make out despite being right Infront of it. 

On one wall was a collection of toys that seemingly spanned just a few feet, but when I'd look back at where I'd just been the selection would be completely different. A never ending supply of toys that any ten year old would shit bricks for. 

On the wall opposite to this one was a selection of video games. With some kind of console I'd never heard of, and a TV to play them on. Games that filled my childhood too. Each shelf adorned with strips of more neon lights that buzzed quietly every now and then. 

There were shelves in the middle of the store with a selection of game magazines, old toy magazines where you could phone order stuff from, and my personal favorite being a huge statue of what at first looked like Optimus Prime. 

There was; for some reason a small pool in one of the corners. It's white tiles under the crystal clear water also being illuminated by these phantom blue lights. Something the girl I was with was incredibly excited about. 

She practically drug me with her to the pool. Asking me if I wanted to swim. I shook my head, and explained that I didn't know how to swim. She looked at me almost amazed.

"You do know how to swim though, silly!" before she grabbed my other hand. Turning to face me as she slowly backed up towards the pool.

For some reason her saying that just instantly unlocked this thing in my brain that told me I did. Which shouldn't have been possible since I've never learned how to swim, and I've honestly had an incredibly deep fear of water all of my life. 

To such a degree I'd make up lies and excuses to always avoid getting in pools, or going swimming at the lake. However, as she pulled me towards the little square body of chlorine scented water that fear just didn't exist. 

Despite desperately wanting to play my favorite childhood video games I followed her into the pool. Now I gotta tell you this is nothing like I expected. The water felt cool against my skin, and we didn't change clothes but I was suddenly in swim trunks. 

So far that's on brand for what I'd been experiencing, but this is what I didn't expect. I could fucking swim. I cannot explain how I was, but I was swimming, and this next part takes the cake. I could breathe. 

For some reason I could breathe under water. The girl smiled at me while bubbles floated out from her mouth, leading up to the surface. It was then we realized the bottom of the pool was so much deeper than it looked like it was. 

It looked from the outside like a five foot deep pool, but under the water we could tell it went down for miles. With chambering exits that lead to so many different places. 

We drifted down, and passed these underwater chambers. Seeing incredible things in them. Literal water parks under water, other rooms filled with more pools. We didn't need goggles to see which I'm sure you already gathered, but still. 

We didn't spend too long in the pool since we noticed another map down in the water. We decided to go back up to the store so we could take one last look around, and then find another place to visit.

When we got out, our regular clothes were back on, and we were as dry as we had been before getting into the underwater wonderland. However, I started to notice something off that just didn't sit right with me. 

The back wall of the toy store was another set of glass doors like we had seen before, but behind them were these dark tan bricks. With cob webs in-between the glass and the brick work. 

Which was strange. The toy store's walls and carpeted floor was incredibly inviting. The pattern on the carpet even more colorful than than the neon lights. 

The contrast just felt off. It gave me that similar feeling of dread I used to get when I'd be in trouble with my mom and hear her calling for me from another room. 

"Come on! I wanna see something else" said the girl. Her voiced seemed to snap me out of the fixation on the glass and bricks. "Brandon!" She shouted at me in a playful way to get my attention. 

"Yeah, I'm sorry" I said. Giving one last glance back to that far wall. It was suddenly another purple wall, with shelves full of toys. "Let's get going". 

"So where do you wanna go?" she asked, practically skipping to the map outside the toy store. Unable to shake that strange feeling I just shrugged and replied with "Wherever you want". 

While the girl tapped away on the map, I looked around. The sheer size of hub still amazed me. Even with dream logic in my head it was just insane. That's when I noticed a couple other doors that had been bricked off. 

However, the girl got my attention once again by saying "Oh you'll like this!" before grabbing my hand again and pulling me along. 

As she lead me across this rounded room the uneasy feeling faded. Something about her presence just seemed to keep me a bit grounded. Albeit maybe not grounded in reality, but grounded emotionally. 

"When entering this DreamSpace, trust your intuition" the familiar robotic voice said over the same bad PA system. Which confused me at first, but once the sliding glass doors opened I realized almost immediately what it meant. 

There was a mirror in this small room. It was a four by eight room with hardwood floors, and wood trim. The walls were that same cream white you'd find in schools or a doctor's office.

The girl had looked around, slightly confused as well. "What does she mean?" she asked. Looking to me with a puzzled expression on her face. 

Now not only was I beginning to recognize her face, I for once was also the one with a bit of knowledge for some reason. I gestured for her to follow me, and I placed my hand on the mirror. She placed hers on it as well, right next to mine. 

"Think hard about where you wanted to go" I explained to her. Feeling both crazy, yet like I'd never been more right before. We stared into the mirror, and almost in synchronized thoughts I began to see where she wanted to go too. 

Both in my mind, but also behind the mirror. For safety I grabbed her free hand with my own. Just Incase my intuition was correct. Then the mirror seemed to ripple. Almost like it was a sheet, and underneath it were these waves. Then in this impossibly wild moment, we were sucked through the fucking mirror. 

Yeah, you did read that correctly. I could hear the mirror shatter, and the two of us were both sucked through, and spat out of the mirror. Landing on the other side on our feet. 

"Holy shit' I mumbled to myself. Almost proud that for once I was the smart person. "You can say that again" she said, nudging me with her elbow. 

I turned around to see exactly where she had imagined. Now I'm sure you don't understand what I mean by this so let me try to explain it as best as I can. 

So, the girl who I was with thought that we were going to this old mansion which I'll describe soon, but we ended up in that room. The mirror being there felt like a doorway. Or more accurately a window. 

The phantom voice saying trust our intuition confirmed that feeling for me, and for some reason the deepest feeling in my gut said if we just made contact with the mirror,  and focused as hard as we possibly could, the barrier between the window would crack, and we could sort of travel through the mirror. 

Does that make sense? No? Well shit, I'm sorry, but that's the best I can do. Point is, we had somehow made our way to this mansion, by seeing it through the mirror. 

We explored this building for a fair bit of time. It was an old Victorian style with dark wood floors, railings for the stairs, and these huge doors. Adorned in carvings depicting angels and demons. 

It was like a more realistic version of Hogwarts castle from the inside, but instead of masonry and statues it was incredibly well crafted wood work, and suits of armor. Swords were hung on the walls, along with candles that dimly lit each hallway. The carpet on the stairs was this greenish color mixed with patterns of brown and  yellow. 

We found another set of mirrors, and the girl wanted to try that trick again. So we placed our hands on the mirror, and she looked at me before we figured out where to go. 

Once again, we focused on where we wanted to go, heard the mirror shatter and between a hazy fog of purple, green, and pink. We were put into a concert. 

It was loud. Strobe lights were waving around and the sound of heavily distorted guitars were playing. Practically overpowering the singer. The girl freaked out; in a good way. Quickly leading me deeper into the crowd. 

This is where I began to realize this place isn't all good all the time. Slowly, the music turned from one of my favorite bands playing a live show, to this screeching noise. Like that of metal breaks grinding against eachother on a bad car. 

Loud pops and bangs rang out, and the crowd started to scream. The lights began changing from strobing purple, and blue, to flashing bright white lights. Practically blinding us both. 

I couldn't hear myself think, and covering my ears did next to nothing to help. The girl grabbed my arms and was shouting something at me I couldn't hear, and that feeling in my gut became pure terror. We heard this loud roar that both literally, and metaphorically shook me to my core. 

I could feel my vary bones and insides vibrating as the sound grew louder and louder. When I looked in the direction it was coming from I noticed this impossibly large figure rising from behind the stage set. 

People started scattering and running away, their screams growing silent in comparison to the indescribable noises whatever this thing was making. The girl pulled my arms and drug me to a bathroom. We did that mirror trick again, and went back to that mansion. 

The noise died out after a few moments, the memory of it slowly fading, only to leave a ringing in my ears, and a headache like I had the hangover from hell. 

The girl hugged me, and apologized. I asked why she was apologizing. Incredibly confused by what she said. 

"I think I caused that to happen" she explained. "I started thinking about something huge in the clouds behind the stage, and the next thing I know that happened" she took brief pauses while she spoke. 

Looking off to the side as if trying to consider if what she was saying was accurate, or just a coincidence. However, considering how we got there it definitely wasn't out of the realm of possibility. 

"We should probably get back" I said, more than in a rush to just leave this place and find Keeper. She nodded, and followed behind me as we made our way around, looking for some way back to the hub. 

Again, just like with the orange room we just kinda appeared there. However, this time it didn't seem so inviting. I started noticing things that had changed drastically from how they were before. 

The lights had gone dim, and most of the glass doors were bricked off like the one in the toy store. The mold I had seen on my first visit was in places I hadn't noticed before, and even scarier was the map. 

We made our way over to that map; hoping to find a way to contact Keeper. However, all the colors had vanished. It no longer had the vaporwave aesthetic it had before. Instead it looked like an old dirty map. Now it simply had one color; red, and out of curiosity, we tapped it. 

Immediately an alarm started going off. This incredibly loud fire alarm sounding noise that practically shook the walls, and we noticed there was now a glass door that hadn't been bricked off. It was opening. 

Behind it was a deep red light, and after it opened that same red light became the one light source we had, the dim overhead lights all going dark. The phantom voice began speaking again. 

"Contamination in the DreamSpace separation protocol, Nightmare code X7B21. All attendees must exit immediately" repeating this phrase over and over again. 

The alarm started to hurt my ears, and the girl I was with clung to my arm. Shouting "Oh my God. Brandon look!" before pointing towards the glass doors that had opened up. Two figures were approaching us from the boundaries of the doors, and thankfully we didn't find out what they had wanted to do. 

Keeper suddenly appeared, and with a wave of his hand began closing these sliding glass doors. One after another Infront of these two shadowy figures; slowing them down, but not stopping them. They'd break through the glass and bolt towards us as another would close. 

The figure with a hat seemed to stretch it's arms out wide. Far wider than should even be possible in dreams. As it tried to reach toward us Keeper turned to us and said "I'm sorry, but I think you two should head home" in a surpringly calm, and soft tone. 

The girl jerked my arm and pleaded for me to follow her out of the exit doors. Once again the realization I was asleep began to stir me from my dream, but not before I took one last glance back at Keeper. Noticing him charging toward these figures in an attempt to contain the situation. 

Then just like that, I was awake again. The memory of this dream so fresh and vivid in my mind, and there was little I could do but write it down and start a sketch of what I'd seen. I've spent the last few weeks debating if I should post this, but since I've returned there after this experience I feel a need to reach out and see if anyone else has experienced this. 

I have so many questions about the nature of this place. I don't think it's meant to be harmful, but that last experience I described isn't the only time it's happened. However, I've been writing this after waking up from another visit, and have to go to work soon so I don't think I have the time to divulge even more than I already have. I hate nightshifts on occasion. 

I cannot convey properly the feeling of pure terror that fills me whenever I see those red lights come on. Each experience with them being different, and some of them more fear inducing than others. I know most of this post is describing pleasantries from a weird dream world, but please don't let that detract from just how horrific that last experience I described was. 

Has anyone else experienced this place? Do any of you know what it is or why I seem to keep going there? I feel batshit insane for asking this, but I'm honestly unsure if it really is just a dream, or if there's more to it. So again, if anyone has any answers or shared experiences I'd love to read them.

I know my description of this place might not be written as well as it could be, and it would make no sense unless you can put yourself in this dreamlike state of mind. Still, if you enjoyed reading this let me know. If it does well, who knows. Maybe I'll come back, and share more of my experiences in what I call The Hub. 

Until then I'll be taking notes in my dream journal, doodling some sketches, and trying to come to an understanding of how these situations are playing out the way they do, and why. Hopefully improving my poor grammar along the way. Good luck out there, dreamers. Thanks for listening.
