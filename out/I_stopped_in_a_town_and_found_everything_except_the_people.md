I wasn’t supposed to be here.

A detour, a missed exit, and my phone’s GPS throwing a tantrum had landed me in this little speck of a town. Just a few hours off course, I told myself. Besides, a small town diner’s greasy breakfast sounded more appealing than another gas station sandwich.

The sign read “Welcome to Willowbrook.” It had that quaint, old-fashioned charm, the kind you’d see in picture books about Americana—white picket fences, red-bricked sidewalks, and charming little shops with hand-painted signs.

The problem was, no one was there.

Not a single car on the street, no strollers or pedestrians. It was as if the whole town had decided to sleep in late. I parked by a coffee shop called Brew & Biscuits. Its windows were clean, polished even. But inside, the lights were off.

I pushed open the door, and it chimed with a cheerful jingle that seemed too loud against the town’s dead silence. Inside, everything was perfectly intact. Croissants lay arranged under a glass case, a pot of coffee still warm on the counter.

“Hello?” I called. My voice sounded so small. Nothing but my own echo replied.

I wandered through the town, my footsteps sounding too sharp against the deserted sidewalks. The supermarket’s automatic doors swished open as I approached. Its shelves were fully stocked, carts lined neatly at the entrance. But no customers. No cashiers.

It was like walking through a dollhouse frozen mid-play. Plates of half-eaten food sat on tables at a diner. Cars remained parked with doors left slightly ajar, the keys still in their ignitions. A baseball game paused mid-play in the park, the bat resting abandoned on the ground.

I called out a few more times, my voice growing weaker with each attempt. There was no sign of panic or struggle. Just… absence.

I should have left. Gotten back in my car and sped away until my tires hit familiar roads. But curiosity had its claws in me, dragging me deeper into this unsettling stillness.

I wandered into a house at the end of Harper Street. The door was unlocked, creaking as I pushed it open. Inside, family photos lined the walls, all smiles and summer vacations. The kitchen table was set for dinner, plates of steaming food that hadn’t cooled. I reached out to touch a roast potato; it was still warm.

How could this be possible?

I moved from house to house, shop to shop. Every place was the same. Lived in, but vacant. As if everyone had left in the middle of living.

By the time the sun began to dip below the horizon, I had circled back to my car. But something made me hesitate. A shape in the distance, near the center of town.

I squinted and saw it was a phone booth. Bright red, sticking out like a clown’s nose against the sleepy pastels of Willowbrook’s storefronts. I hadn’t noticed it earlier.

When I reached it, the door hung slightly ajar. A low, crackling sound seeped from the receiver dangling from its cord. Against all reason, I picked it up.

At first, there was nothing but static. And then, a voice.

“Why are you here?” it whispered.

The line went dead.
