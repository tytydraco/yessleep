So it seems like my advice followed 2 main lines of thought, rip and tear, and Home Alone. I've got to say, might seem like the obvious options, but that is only from the outside. The help was appreciated. I'll adress some of the things brought up to help you guys be my cutmen (and women). 

Yeah, I'm not really a brawler, I'm no teacup, but in a straight up fight , I don't know how well against â€¦demons I guess we will call them? 

As far as upgrades, well I'll get to that in a bit. But other than that, I'm not to sure that works. I don't know if I should be working out or finding an arc welder or what. Guess I'm going to have to do some experiments. 

Getting outside seems like a good idea, I'm going to be honest though, I have no idea what outside is like. Where I am is one of those things my creator did not feel the need to equip me with. But I guess it's obvious I'm in a residential neighbourhood. Maybe garages or something could work?

Which brings me to the next point, I do need to figure out more of what is going on. Truth be told I know a lot more than I can tell you , creator blocking me ruining her plan. 

I tried to put some of this to work. Some success, some failure. Here it goes. 

My first setback was lack of access to anything scarier than my teeth, and the 4 inch blades I can swap out my hands for. See,  the problem isn't that I wasn't well equiped this time, I actually have a regular sized chest , covered in a tarp in the attic where my creator assures me rests all kinds of implements of death tailor made for me. 

It's made of a dark splintered wood, secured  with a massive black iron lock with no keyhole. Faded (purposely antiqued would be a better word) paint trying to look jaunty and creepy all at the same time reads "Tickle Trunk" in large letters on the top. 

The problem is, that lock has no key. It won't open for me, nor anyone else until my mission begins. Leaving me in a rather sad situation offense wise. 

I rolled over every option I could think of. Reading the books downstairs? No idea if I'd even understand them. Contacting my creator? Not the killing demons type. Physical force? Tried and failed. These Are just a few of the ideas I had before I heard the door to the house smash inward a little after midnight. 

I scuttle into a vent to try and figure out what's going on , I find a good angle from a floor vent and see a new oddity. 

The door was indeed smashed to splinters inward, steel reinforcements and thick locks twisted and mangled , standing in the middle of this was a new person who I had no real right to judge based on weirdness  , as an evil doll, but I was going to anyway. 

He was a stoutly built guy , mid to late thirties , close to six feet. Square jaw and a dozen or so nasty scars across his face. His hair was cropped short and He had on a thick brown leather bomber jacket with several hooks and holsters holding various pieces of modified weaponry. A clean white t-shirt and a pair of faded jeans reinforced with bits of leather and steel completed his outfit. 

The strangest thing about this guy though, was his right leg. It clicked and whirred as he moved, and as I looked close I could see the hard edges of mechanical parts show through tears in the jeans. 

Casually across his left shoulder he held a massive pump action shotgun, the barrel welded and drilled into an agressive pointed muzzle. In his right he held a slab of sharpened steel reminiciant of an oversized cricket bat, a yellow and black 'danger' symbol painted on one side. 

He holds the shotgun one handed and fires into the ceiling, the shot makes almost no noise but the effect is immediate and cacaphonous.  A piece of the ceiling the size of a child's pool explodes upward raining down plaster and wood. 

He walks forward with confidence, his right leg gouging and cracking the hardwood floor as he walked. 

" Hey Padre! I'm here for midnight mass" the man says swinging the sword like object into a wall in a burst of plaster and sparks as a power line is severed. 

Faster than I can register, the bishop is at the top of the stairs. A smile that has no effect on his dead eyes spreading across his face. 

"I was wondering how long it would take the choir boy to find me. 2 decades, that's a little long to hold a grudge , don't you think?" The bishop says, slowly walking to the bottom of the stairs. 

"This is a long time coming old man. I've killed a lot of shit worse than you on my way here. I've became more than the result of your little party in the 90s. Choir boy? Asshole, the only thing I'm going to sing is 'raindrops keep falling on my head ' as I piss on your corpse." And with that the man aims and fires his gun at the bishop, the old man glides back up the stairs in a black blur. 

"You think your the first kid with a gun to come after me? You arnt even the funniest." I notice an accent from the bishop, Dutch maybe. From under his robes several thick white tentacles begin to snake forth. They are studded with what look to be giant jagged fingernails. 

He anchors them to the wall and raises his body, swaying and moving like a spider in its own Web.  

The man smiles for a second and throws his shotgun, somehow as it spins toward the bishop, it fires four times , blowing the four tentacles to pieces. He catches it as he charges, slamming it into the bishop's face , the gun, upgraded as it is, stays in tact, shattering one of the bishop's eye sockets, the dead orb flying across the hall. 

A fifth tentacle, easily twice the size of the previous ones slams into the man, he keeps his balance on the short flight down the stairs and lands , sword held at the ready. 

"First round to me there your worship. Don't worry though , I got plenty more for the collection plate. " the guy says with a swagger that gives me hope. 

"You got me there. Don't worry though, there won't be a round 4." The bishop says as he snaps a finger. 

One of the cherubic things stalks silently from the kitchen. A high pitched hollow noise I assume is laughter comes from deep within it. 

"Should have known you'd have something to fight your battles. Couldn't you afford legs for this thing?" The man, who I'm thinking of as 'the hero' says. 

I notice him flick a switch on the butt of his shotgun before tossing it to the ground. He draws out a bulky sub machine gun, a two foot chain anchors it to his wrist. The gun is spiked and studded , all its fragile parts scaled up and shielded. He spins it once like a flail and grabs it by the grip, drawing the monsters attention. 

He looks at the bishop "Thought you'd like this toy. " he says shifting his gaze to the monster " But I got something you are really going to get a kick out of big fella." 

He unleashes a kick that sprays shrapnel toward the beast, it shuts it's stretched massive eyes against the debris, making itself completely vulnerable to the  steel, piston-driven leg immediately behind the stinging cloud. 

It's jaw shatters, and it stumbles backward, but the hero keeps his momentum , firing a clip from his machine gun into its chest, then swinging the firearm in a devestating arc into the top of the creature's head. Pale grey blood sprays and rotted looking yellow bone is exposed as the monster slams into the kitchen wall. 

It screams and catches the sword that blurs at its neck, the hero reloads his gun single handed using an ingenious little rig and fires another clip , point blank into the creature.  

It's hurting, but it's not out of the fight. 

It rips the sword from the heroes hand and unleashes a massive headbutt that sends the man to the ground, his nose a pulped ruin. 

The monster picks him up single handed and tosses him back down the hallway, stomping toward him before he has a chance to rise. 

The man delivers a series of kicks from the ground that stun the beast. Bones deep inside it's twisted form breaking and splintering. 

He kips up with a spray of dust, and begins wildly beating the creature with his firearm. He dodges it's attacks, spinning and slamming the weapon into the thing. 

But out of no where the creature spins on one arm, catching the hero off guard with a massive backhanded strike. I can almost feel his arm shatter and his ribs break as the wet cracking noise echoes through the hallway. 

He screams and holds his right arm as he tries to rise. The monster stalks toward him , bloodied and looking on the verge of death itself. 

"Wait!" The hero says, defeated.  

The monster lets out a high pitched chuckle and shakes it's shredded head at the hero, expecting some kind of plea for mercy. 

Instead the man starts his own laugh. 

"Just needed a second , thanks for that." The hero says as a gyroscopic whining can be heard from the shotgun laying on the floor. It aims itself at the creature and fires off over two dozen rounds that make the effect of the first few seem petty. 

The monster explodes apart in wet chunks, defenseless against the torrent of lead and phosphorus. By the time the gun starts dry firing the demon is nothing more than an ankle deep pile of gore. 

The hero stands, he still seems hurt, he is breathing heavily but he is obviously running on endorphins and rage alone. 

"Looks like we get round three after all. I'm feeling it, but not enough to keep from breaking you until dawn." He starts to limp toward the bishop, picking up his custom sword along the way. 

"I said no round 4" the bishop says before whistling. 

As the second monster stalks from the basement , I realize the first must have been the smaller of the two. 

It casually bats aside the injured warriors blade , and to the heroes credit , he stayed conscious  for two roundhouse blows from the beast. 

"Take him down stairs , keep the eyes, I need a new one." The bishop says, following the monster , hero in tow downstairs. 

I have a moment of indecision, do I go back to the attic or follow them? I make my choice, scuttling my way to the vents downstairs. The hero is strapped to a thick wooden chair, and is in a groggy state of half consciousness. 

The massive demon walks over looking to kill the man, " leave him, we need to replace our losses tonight." The bishop says turning around with a device that looks too much like a grapefruit spoon. 

He walks toward the bound man and gets a face full of bloody saliva for the effort. Slowly the bishop wipes the fluid from his face, flicking it back toward the hero. 

The creature masquerading as a man says nothing, simply drops the serrated spoon and continues to walk toward the hero. 

The valiant man struggles and curses as the bishop slowly moves his face toward the man. His lips stretch out a little too far and seal around the hero's eye socket, with a tearing noise he sucks the man's eye from his head, seeming to savor it for a moment before spitting it into a pale claw like hand. 

"Just squaring us up fella." The bishop says, popping the eye into his empty socket. With a couple of slow blinks it synchs up with his remaining eye. 

"Now I get to the fun part." The bishop grins evil and motions for the demon to come over. 

It's holding a device that looks like a speculum that got into death metal. Two black iron rings attached to a thick screw with an oversized crank handle.  

The demon opens the rings and roughly clamps them closed just above the hero's knee. The man tries to struggle and receives a punch to the stomach from a fist half the size of his torso. 

The hero's screams vibrate the meat inside of my ceramic skull, the demon cranks the handle as bone splinters, muscle starts to tear, and with a sickening explosive noise the mechanical leg tears free of the man's body. 

"Dispose of that" the bishop says and immediately the demon begins to slam the leg against the cement floor. 

Chips of concrete and sparks fly, but there isn't so much as a scratch on the leg. The bishop sighs angrily "You are really a pain in the as arnt you? Where'd you get ahold of something like that? No matter, I've got just the thing." 

The bishop leaves, when he returns he is wheeling in what appears to be a large industrial microwave. Script and symbols are gouged into its fake oak surface and as he brings it into the room the air feels cold and sterile. The bishop plugs it into the wall with an electronic hum and the cold isolated feeling becomes a smothering blanket of negative emotion. 

"If your dumb ass doesn't kill me this time. You are fuckin dead old man." The hero says petulantly. 

"Such big words. No little boy, you get to stay around for a little longer. See, you showed me I need to go a little bigger with my help, and you are the only person that can help me." The bishop says this as he picks up the leg, opening the door of the microwave , it's much to large to fit in but does all the same. He closes the door and an eldritch green light begins to glow through the door. 

The hero looks shocked, though barely conscious. 

"Well that takes there of that then." The twisted old basted giggles as he removes the leg, now a twisted steaming stump, and drops it to the ground where it shatters like glass. 

I decide not to push my luck and quickly make my way back into the attic. 

I'm no genius, but if I'm right that machine kills magic. The tickle trunk is magic, but what's inside , to the best of my knowledge isn't.  

And without the stuff inside , my chances of solving this situation the way I was created to, with violence, is just about zero. If that one man army couldn't do it, I have no chance. 

And that is where we are. A little further than before, but what should I do now? 

Do I try and break that guy out? Seems like he'd be a good ally, even down an eye and a leg. Or should I find a way to go through those books? 

Chances are though,  it's going to be a while before I get the tickle trunk open, I think next thing I do will involve some supply gathering of a more mundane type. 

For anyone that wants to know what happens next
