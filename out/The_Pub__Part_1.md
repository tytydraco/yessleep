Music came from various spots in the bar. “Newbies” could always be seen as they always did the same thing. Safety in numbers, they believed. Rightly so, Chase remembered his earlier years. They always sat at the counter playing with the images they manifested, and quite a few it looks had recently figured it out.  The 21st century rode in the shadows of the past.

The Pub was a neutral area. Enemies sat and conversed with enemies as if they were friends. A two-headed cyber grew four arms and sat at the bar on a stool while slowly changing the arm's colors from green to purple. Another looked like a floating talking head above a barstool, blood dripping onto the stool. Brought a smile and a nod from Chase. And an abstract something or other, representing some unknown metaphor or idea. With eight arms, colored blood red, it waved beer steins around its head in all its hands. It's probably the most unique.

The man’s head slowly continued to melt and drip a red puddle, looking like blood onto his stool. He waved him towards the back. "Fuckin Raggo," Chase mumbled. "Still overthinking it. That kinda paranoia must be a bitch." He looked back into the bar room at its occupants.  Cybers, even the A.I., had programs to detect any abnormality concerning signature codes, viruses, decays, and “Veggies.” Veggies was a nickname given to, if not all, most of them working for corporations, governments, corporate governments, quasi-governments, or anything to do with a lack of trust.

Anyone new to the pub is checked out thoroughly. A righteous aspect once thought for themselves. That Veggies don't have. If you can't pass the safeguards.  - You are not Welcome –  and would ring loudly in those circuits sending mismatched bytes to their link, breaking the connection and hopefully frying the mainframe it came from. It takes a lot of accidental curiosity or skill to find the Pub. Much less be allowed to enter it.

He looked around and saw various familiar cybers. Some were jokingly covered in shit or camouflaged head to foot as soldiers in the past. Others constantly changed their appearance, and some stayed “themselves.” All can see and hear the same things as in a reality-based scenario. Similar to those realities, they, unfortunately, were also created by governments as well as corporations and used as traps.

Stymie looked like a medieval knight dressed in solid black armor, the color of cyberspace. He'd been cyber of long-standing and sat with his back against one of the walls at a round table, a rainbow aura of colors constantly changing its colors around him.

Chase walked up and created a chair, the size, the padding, colored black. As it formed he sat down at the table.

“There is a problem, we have a new virus,” Chase told them.

 Stymie laughed. “Having problems with one of your creations Chase?”

“This virus will attract newbies with its program-enhanced software. It affects both machine systems and organically created lives." Chase told him.

"It releases upon access to the medulla, a decay it sounds like.” Stymie said.

“A decay,” Chase agreed, repeating him.

“Who is responsible for this creation, you?” Stymie asked.

“Crocker. But I think being used by someone else, perhaps as a ruse. I don't know yet who programmed it. I hope not to be the only one still searching that out.” Chase said.

Stymie sat quietly for a second, very quiet. Accessing something from his physical database. Every one of the “independent” cybers had only a handful of people knowing their physical locations. Stymie, Chase, Raggo, and a few others had shared these programs. But Crocker had never shared his physical location with anyone. 

Some cyber-warriors were mentally scrubbed once done. Leaving only the memories they had before becoming soldiers. They remembered nothing about ever being a cyber.

Happy, content, serene memories of a job well done. Some, depending on the cyber, were scrubbed and terminated. Others were given a good, comfortable life with cyber software implanted into their minds unknown to them. With basic access, every person had. Most were cared for the remainder of their lives.

“Crocker has been gone for some time now. Are you sure?” Stymie asked, sitting up. “I haven't seen him in some time now, I'm going to say a year.” 

"It's been at least a year since I saw him, and I figured he'd gotten stuck in some cybers program in cyberspace," Chase said. There was no time in cyberspace, only in the realities, in essence, there was no time aside for what was made as well as in that reality.

“And if what you say is true, the Pub is definitely in danger, as well,” Stymie said.

“The reason we're talking now. Who could be trusted in here if someone hacked Crocker’s database.” Chase asked. “I need your help.”

Chase looked at some of the oldest cybers at the nearest tables. Friend and foe alike. "Who, where, and why?" He thought. 

The Pub or Headquarters, called by some, was created by a cyber named Crocker, a true quantum genius. Programming a new computer language and allowing freedom of creativity, the idea for it anyway.

Others helped build it, and it wasn’t shared with governments or corporations. When some cybers discovered the creative power they had at their fingertips. Realities began to emerge, and, like a diamond, the cybers began cutting the faucets in cyberspace into the new dimensions that emerged.
