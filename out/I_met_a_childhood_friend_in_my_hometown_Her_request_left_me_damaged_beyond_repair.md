 The rain had stopped when I arrived in town. Petrichor lifted in the air and traveled into my lungs. But, refreshing as it might have been, the aroma didn’t do much to change how I felt about the situation at hand. Desperate, alone, and knowing that this attempt could claim my life. I came back to the place where those devils ruined my childhood. 

Maybe it had to be like this. The task felt impossible. No one ever went to that place and came back the same. It was either in a box or with permanent mental scars like mine. And now I had to go there again. To that godless place where evil infested the soils, the trees, and the buildings altogether.

I arrived twenty minutes earlier at the bar. Cigarette smoke spread throughout the room, and a few lost pairs of inebriated eyes stared at me. It felt like a character study. People in various states of intoxication glanced at my weary face, greasy dark hair, and tired eyes to see if they held any secrets. They inspected my outfit and must have thought that I had to be an outsider. They probably asked themselves who would wear a suit and tie in such a place of human depravity.

A group of bikers stood in the back of the bar playing 8-ball pool for $20. I heard them babbling words about my shiny black leather shoes. I didn’t understand if they loved or hated them. So I averted their insistent gaze and sat at the bar until Samantha came.

“You just passing through?” the bartender asked.

“Yeah, something like that,” I replied, cracking my neck. The instant relief of tension felt like a gift from God.

“What you having?” he said, showing me a ‘fine’ selection of cheap whisky. The irony was that he looked pretty impressed with what he had.

“I’ll have the cheapest one you got. Make it double on the rocks, please,” I replied, sighing. A sharp pulsating pain took hold of my temples. I massaged them a bit and pulled out an Ibuprofen from my coat.

The jukebox in the corner came to life. One of the biker guys kicked it, put a coin in it, and a 1940s jazz tune began playing, the saxophone caressing the strings of my restless heart.

I took the pill with a gulp of whiskey. Then I lit a cigarette and saw the smoke shaping into faces of small grinning devils. They looked down at me, laughing at the cesspool of misery and despair into which I drowned a little more every day. Dark thoughts began forming inside my mind. Set to return to the place I dreaded most, where I would be subjected to the monsters from my childhood, I felt the blood boil inside my veins. 

“It will kill you, you know?” said the bartender while he wiped the wooden surface of the bar.

“What?” I said, coming back to my senses.

“That combo, man. Cigarettes, booze, and pills. That’s the perfect love letter to death itself,” he said.

“Yeah, and you must be the messenger, right?” I said, exhaling smoke.

“Guess so,” he said.

“Eh, we’re all gonna die someday. So I can, at least, enjoy life until the sands of time claim it,” I said, gulping the rest of my drink. He nodded and smiled. I guess he thought people like me find all kinds of excuses to give in to their demons.

I heard a car with a strong engine revving and pulling up in front of the joint. I couldn’t wait to see her. But, when she entered, the whole world stopped. Her dark red hair and bright blue eyes could cause a heart attack to any man on Earth.

“Hello, Mark. It’s been too long,” she said, smiling. She radiated like an angel in this hell of alcoholics and low-lives who wasted their life away. 

“Samantha. How are you holding up?” I asked, gently squeezing her left shoulder.

“I haven’t had a shut eye in three days. Not since they got my baby girl,” she said, her lower lip quivering.

“Don’t worry, Sam. I will get her out even if it’s the last thing I do. I did it for myself, and I know those assholes inside and out,” I reassured her after our previous phone talk.

Samantha and I went way back. We used to hang out a lot and were practically best friends. Luck was on her side, as she didn’t have to go through what I did. Well, this happened until a few days ago when the taking of her daughter occurred. Now I saw how much stress and fear grabbed her mind in their infernal sharp and poisonous claws. 

They were here long before the town. They took children no matter what. Their ruthlessness knew no boundaries. They got whomever they wanted. The parents knew better than to resist their claims. 

The people in town had a name for them. 

The Masks of Nothing. 

This sect or cult would wander throughout the town and randomly knock on the doors of families with children. They would never speak to anyone. Usually, they would sit in the doorway and point at the child. Then, they would signal the child to follow them. 

Once a family bravely denied their requests. They nodded, turned away, and left. The next day, that family went missing and has never been seen or heard from again. Vanished, like they weren’t even there in the first place. To add insult to injury, the Masks painted a large X on their door. Results came in for human blood.

The police were non-existent. They would always turn a blind eye to the sect’s diabolical behavior simply because the Masks had the cops in their pockets. Everyone was afraid to leave town and speak about them because the cult had private houses all around the country. At least, that’s what people said. 

Frequently, they had five kids for this. Then, for a few days, the children would go through a “change of consciousness” called “finding oneself through divination.” 

These terms meant that the children would be left alone for three days and three nights in the woods near the camp of the Masks. The kids would see and experience strange supernatural phenomena. They would see and talk to strange humanoid creatures with twisted appearances. They would meet devils. All the kids had to do was push forward, trying to escape. 

Many kids had vanished from that town due to these awful games the Masks of Nothing played. They sat in a dark, smoky room called The Sanctuary of Silence. They had CCTV cameras planted in the woods and looked on the monitors at the events unfolding.

I have thought it to be a stupid name with no divine aspect. Samantha and I called it The Ruination. As I said earlier, this experience forever changed those who endured it. The Masks took sadistic pleasure in watching the innocent kids fight for their lives with everything they got.

Tears welled in her haunting eyes. Her gaze fixated on me, and I felt like a stone statue. “Oh my God, Mark. What if she is going to die? What if those evil bastards do something to her?” she whimpered. Her lips trembled in unison with the dark thoughts that began flooding her.

“I promise you I will get her out of there,” I reassured her.

“They changed it,” she said, averting my gaze.

“Changed what?” I asked.

“The Ruination. The bastards got bored with it the way it was. Now they do extra sessions during Christmas and Easter. They want to feel closer to whatever sick version of God they’re worshipping,” she said. Her voice trembled; she felt unwell. The spark in her eyes succumbed to the darkness of whatever ideas took shape inside her mind.

“God dammit,” I replied.

“They start tomorrow. Word goes that the children will receive gifts for their willingness to participate in this demented challenge. Imagine how crazy the Masks are if they snatch children from their homes and then think they came by their own will?” Samantha said, shaking her head. “And that fucker Partridge doesn’t ever say anything. He collects the cash and doesn’t care about anything else. He’s just a blood-stained dirtbag. Just like his father.”

Joe Partridge was none the community sheriff. He struck fear in every person in town because of his bloodline. His great-grandfather, grandfather, and father had all been in the same position of town sheriff. People said the Masks got them involved in some nasty stuff. The word in town was that the Partridges were possessed. People said they sold their souls for money, and the Masks helped them in this endeavor. They had to ensure everything went according to plan during the Ruination.

“I’ll visit him to make him remember after ending this diabolical charade. This needs to end. They have hurt too many people. Let’s leave this cesspit of decay,” I said, standing up. “Wait, before we go, do you any of these people in here?” 

“Only Jim, the bartender. He’s one of the good guys. He can keep an eye out too. I’ll tell him,” Sam said, heading to the bar. They talked for a few minutes. Jim glanced at me and nodded in approval. 

When we got outside, thunder boomed in the dark clouds above us. From time to time, lightning struck, and it felt like impending doom was just around the corner. Samantha had a crimson Ford Mustang, a beauty and a beast of a car at the same time. My beat-up old Ford Mondeo paled in comparison. 

We arrived at her house, got inside, and had a cup of hot tea. I told her the plan to get little Madeleine out of the claws of those freaks. 

The plan I had devised with so much care involved me sneaking inside their camp, locating the children, and trying to get them all out, with Madeleine being my top priority. I had to get her back to her mom safe and sound. 

I would let the game begin so the kids could be alone in the woods. The CCTV cameras ran straight, precisely a hundred yards from each other. That gave me a lot of time to disable the ones I needed to be gone. I knew exactly how to take Madeleine out because I once got out of that haunting place. I never forgot that night and the events I experienced.

When I set foot in their camp, I immediately felt the godlessness of the place. It reeked of evil spirits and things that should not be present in this world. 

The camp had an ironic name for an average, sane person: Camp Divine Grace. I didn’t feel any grace because their god had horns. It didn’t feel divine, only the opposite —a small world of lies enshrouded in the veil of deceit and evil deeds. The lying tongue of the devil licked the Masks’ ears, whispering empty promises for this life. But they would soon learn: all that glitters isn’t gold.

Samantha liked to keep tabs on all things Masks of Nothing. She liked to gather info, so if trouble ever came to her doorstep, she would be ready. And she wanted this void of nothingness that smothered her heart and shrunk her soul to a speck of ash to be gone forever. In her restlessness, she knew she wouldn’t sleep, not even for a second, until the most important person in her life, her beautiful sweet daughter Madeleine, would be back in her arms, back with her in the warmth of their house where everything was safe and sound. A small world in which they were the sole inhabitants and that they had built to their own taste. It was a place that sheltered them from the other world, the one outside where dangers lurked at every corner. 

But that was all gone when the fateful knocking came. And with it, the silence that followed became unbearable in Samantha’s mind. Yet, she knew she had to be strong, to keep being strong as she always had been.

“Aside from doing the Ruination on Christmas and Easter, is there anything else they changed?” I asked her.

“As far as I know, no. The last time they did the ritual, they took Christopher Gerald, and he managed to finish it. He told me his father had trained him well. And it paid off. I talked to them both, and the ritual is the same as ever,” she assured me.

Timothy Gerald was seven years my senior. He escaped the Ruination, and due to shock, he remembered everything that had happened. He created a camp map, drew the route with all the checkpoints, and marked all the supernatural events he experienced and saw.

Fearful and not wanting anyone to find out he had such a good memory, Tim never told anyone about this. The burden became unbearable when many of the children didn’t come home. He would hear grief-stricken parents crying and screaming in anguish in their homes, longing for something they would never experience again. Only the lingering ghosts of their children in the form of memories.

He didn’t want to see any more unnecessary suffering. He went door to door to everyone with children and handed out copies of the camp and the Ruination route. If that was meant to be his end, then so be it. At least he didn’t hold out on any info that could have been helpful.

Even so, children vanished. Some got scared, and the pressure of the ritual got the best of them. Others didn’t pay attention to some details, and the things in the woods snatched them forever.

People had pale faces and dark bags under their eyes in this small, forgotten place. Some of them succumbed to the malevolence that had fogged all corners of the town. The most profound evil known to humankind extended its roots under the soil and poisoned the land.

The townsfolk gossiped that the land had a strange thing to it. It was old, which attracted the Masks in the first place. They sensed a massive potential in the area for doing their satanic black magic rituals here because of the power the land gave off. 

The fact is that no one had ever seen the Masks other than when they came for the children, except for Tim. He managed to see one of them go inside the Sanctuary of Silence. For a few seconds, he managed to peek through the cracks of the wooden walls. The Masks checked the CCTV feed and moved about like robots, lifeless forms of life only protected by their bony masks and black robes.

No one ever knew what was under those things. Many of us suspected we had been dealing with supernatural beings, with devils that had climbed up from hell onto earth to take over and drown us into an ocean of sour pain and eternal suffering.

I needed rest, but the adrenaline rush was too high. I didn’t have time for that, Madeleine was in dire straits in that place, and I was her only hope of salvation. 

I had always been fond of Madeleine. Samantha and I talked a lot over the years, and on numerous occasions, she would video call me or send me pictures of them both. When she was very little, her father passed away, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t be happy. Sometimes I thought I could be a fatherly figure or at least help with advice if needed. After all, her mom and I went way back.

Samantha insisted she should come with me. Strength in numbers, she said. I calmed her down, hugged her before leaving, and told her everything would be alright. 

“That place is not for you, Sam. Trust me on this one, please. The things that lurk in the dark woods are angry and ravenous. God forbid anything should happen to you. I couldn’t risk that. I know them and that awful place. I never forgot them. They’re like a ghost parasite, sucking on the energy of the mind forever,” I told her. I grabbed her by the shoulder and could feel the pressure and tension in her body. She shivered and let her head hang low.

“Please get her back safe, Mark. I’m begging you,” she said. Her eyes began to water, and her lower lip quivered.

“I will, I promise. Even if it’s the last thing I’ll do, you and Madeleine will spend Christmas together this year and for years to come. You will open presents, laugh, drink hot chocolate, and forget about everything bad. I could help you move out of this godforsaken place in a second. There’s no point in living here anymore.” I said, squeezing her hands.

“Mark, before you go… I need to tell you something. Do you remember that time, twelve years ago, when I came to visit you? That lovely evening where we had too much to drink, and we crashed at your place?” she said, tears rolling down her face. She sobbed, breathing hard, almost on the verge of a panic attack.

“Yes, I do. I’ll cherish that night forever. It’s one of the best things that ever happened to me,” I replied, wiping her tears with my thumbs and slowly pressing her cheeks.

“After we…” she burst out in tears. She crashed on her knees on the wooden floor. “Madeleine… She is your daughter, Mark!” she exclaimed, looking at them with bloodshot eyes. 

I felt the whole world crashing down around me, but not because of anger. It didn’t happen even because Sam lied to me for all these years. I felt small prickling sensations pressing on my skin. The realization that I had a daughter with whom I had been very close without even knowing the fact awoke in me feelings I had never felt before. An invisible force came to life inside my soul and set it ablaze with the gasoline of love and care.

Many questions arose from these words. This situation would have immense implications for my life. But I had to push these things aside and save Madeleine. All these future scenarios wouldn’t have come to fruition without Madeleine alive. 

“Samantha, I want to ask you many things, but time is short. So we will talk when I bring her back, ok? I promise I will get Madeleine back. I will save… our daughter,” I said, kissing her forehead gently and hugging her tight.

She felt lighter than ever before, not so tensed anymore. Whatever burden she held on her shoulders was gone now. But the pain remained. The angst too, and the anger. The love of a mother knows no boundaries.

I went back out in the empty, endless night and walked through the dense woods until I reached the Masks’ camp.

Prophets of Forever. That’s what they called themselves. 

I glanced around to see if the Ruination had started. Grave-like silence fell like a blanket of death on the accursed land. The mud was rotten, emanating a fetid miasma that would infect every healthy human set of lungs. 

I saw their twisted version of a Christmas tree from behind a church-like wooden building. Dark-red lights illuminated a black tree in which hung animal and human skulls as well as severed hands and claws. Atop the tree, there was a bigger skull. It had a wide grin, sharp teeth, and long horns. 

I had never seen the camp like that. They went the extra mile to satisfy their cravings by destroying every little thing we, the normal ones, held sacred. Our children, our holidays, everything they could.

A loud drum-like sound reverberated throughout camp. It had begun. I snuck behind a few of the wooden houses until I saw the fire burning bright before the main entrance. The five children stood petrified before the Masks. The tall, slender hooded figures were almost nine feet tall. These monsters were intimidating to look at, and a deep seething fear choked my heart to the point where I almost forgot to breathe.

When I saw Madeleine, my heart dropped even more. She was the spitting image of her mother. Red hair and a soul filled with things that should not be there. All because of these goddamn masked barbarians.

A creepy piano version of ‘Carol of the Bells” began playing. As soon as that happened, the three Masks retreated, making their way to the Sanctuary of Silence. Oh, how hungry they were to see the children suffer. I made sure to wait until they got inside. I followed the children on the dimly lit trail in the woods. 

An owl hooted somewhere to my right. A hungry wolf howled, the sound cutting through the dark veil of this cursed night. I stayed off the trail in places where I knew the cameras wouldn’t see me. 

I knew I could only save her, and the other kids had to manage on their own. That made me feel light-headed, but there wasn’t time for that. I had to save her no matter what. So, I waited until she was alone and threw a tiny rock at her feet to get her attention.

“Madeleine, do not turn around. It’s me, Mark. I’ve come to get you out here. Just keep walking until the crossroads. There you will see two arrows, one red and the other black. The red one will point to a seemingly happy place, while the black one will say you’ll meet monsters along the way. Don’t trust it; it’s the other way around,” I instructed her.

She trembled when hearing the whispered sound of my voice. She stopped for a moment, wanted to turn around, but kept her composure. She let out a sigh of relief and followed my instructions.

“When you reach the old oak tree, start running to your left. I’ll be there right beside you. I’ll get you out of this godless place,” I told her. So she walked, and I followed her from behind the trees where the dim light didn’t go. 

I felt something slithering at my feet. A black snake with red ruby eyes looked at me; its head tilted to the side. It looked as if it was being controlled remotely by someone else. Greenish saliva spewed from its mouth. It hissed at me as all predators do before attacking. 

I ducked the attack. Its fangs dripped more of the poison. It attacked me one more time, I slipped, and it hit a tree behind me. Rising rapidly, I crushed its head under the sole of my boot until it turned to mush. The imminence of danger breathed in the back of my neck. 

“Madeleine, come here. We’re getting out right now,” I screamed. “Give me your hand!” I said, reaching to her.

A loud metallic hum filled the woods and disturbed the silence. They were coming, and they were angry. Madeleine took my hand and squeezed it tight. She glanced at me, her eyes welling with tears. I hugged her and told her everything would be well.

“I can’t believe you are here, Mark. This wasn’t how I imagined our first meeting would be. But I’m thrilled that you are here. You’re like the dad I never had,” she said, hugging me. I could feel her tremble against me from her soft whimpering. 

The earth moved under us. Loud footsteps came toward us, violently hitting the ground in the distance. The trees moved to and fro as the leaves rattled as if scared by whatever beast plagued the lands.

From the darkness, a large silhouette took form in front of us. It roared, groaned, screamed, bellowed with hunger, rage, hate for the living, and profound, seething evil altogether. 

The beast wore a dark crimson fluffy suit with black oil stains. Its dirty long grey beard and hair dripped a substance that burned the soil when touching it. In his right bloodied hand, one with the nails plucked from the fingers, it dragged an old rusty axe. It swung it through the air, raging and screaming like the rabid beast that it was.

Its eyes, grey, ghastly and lifeless, fixated on Madeleine and me with hateful spite. Its unnatural long mouth revealed four sets of long, sharp teeth that resembled surgical suture needles. It grinned. It screamed. It charged towards us. Madeleine screamed in fright. Holding her hand tight, we turned around and ran as fast as we could. 

Again a dark, instrumental Christmas chant echoed throughout the woods, making even the earth shake. The beast ran fast despite its enormous girth, closing in on the distance between us and it. It gnawed through the trees and the bushes. It tried to speak, but the words came out as if this evil, twisted old man disguised as Santa Claus was choking on shattered glass.

I shot the creature three times, and it only made things worse. Its gangrenated skin absorbed the bullets like they were rubber. The ravenous old man shot a stream of hot, green liquid that burned through everything in its wake. Some landed on my boots, puncturing small holes in them. 

Madeleine shivered, her face all but drained of color. I reassured her everything would be alright. She would be back home with her mom. But where would I fit in this new picture? How was I supposed to play the father's role in this new chapter?

As evil Santa approached, we took a sharp turn to our left and found ourselves standing in front of a small wooden cabin. We got inside and sat in the darkness. The old man sniffed around the place. He screamed again, enraged that he couldn’t find us.

The black, oily pastel of fear plastered my face. I knew the Masks had tremendous power, and their deal with forces beyond the human veil of existence would be all against the innocent. 

Silence fell over the surroundings, both inside and outside. The creature, the beast that almost claimed our lives trailed off in the distance until its rage was swallowed whole by the stillness of the night.

I grabbed the phone from my front pocket and turned on the flashlight. Inspecting the room, I saw masks adorning the walls, each emanating a different kind of evil. Blood splattered the walls grotesquely. Moving the light on the floor, I saw a large hatch door in the middle of the room. 

“Should we go back outside or take the risk and dive inside that thing?” said Madeleine, fixating her eyes on the rusty hatch.

“I think the dangers are equal everywhere inside this place,” I asked. “This might be a secret passage that will guide us to safety. My gut tells me we should go in there,” I said, pointing to the hatch.

She nodded.

I grabbed the handle and pulled it open. A metallic ladder went all the way down. We descended it and found ourselves inside a long, cold, and dimly lit underground corridor.

As we walked with care, we could see a large red door taking shape in front of our eyes. I told Madeleine not to move and placed my ear on the door. Voices whispered behind it, and electrical whirring buzzed in a staccato fashion.

I pushed the door open, and in front of me, one Mask appeared. It looked startled, as if this room held the cult’s greatest secret locked inside.

It jumped on me with the speed of light, choking me with a brutal force. I tried to break free, but to no avail. I checked for my gun and finally found it on the right side of my waist. Grabbing the pistol, I placed it right in front of blue-lighted eyes. 

A loud thundering boom filled the room, the Mask dropping dead at my feet. Gasping for air, I looked at it with puzzlement. The thing wasn’t even human; all I could see was electrical wiring, the crackling circuits now visible from the gunshot. 

I looked around and saw a small green-horned goat statue placed on a shrine. The light pulsated in a mesmerizing fashion. As if pushed by a divine force, I grabbed it and smashed it on the ground, where it splintered to a thousand pieces.

The room began shaking. This wasn’t good.

“We have to go back to the surface. Something is happening!” Madeleine screamed, opening the red door to the tunnel. The tunnel was shaking too. If we didn’t go back up, we would die there, trapped under the rubble.

“One final run, Mads,” I said.

We reached the ladder in record time and climbed it up. We were back inside the cabin now. Going outside, we saw that everything was in flames. The children from the Ruination ran free toward us. I looked at the main campsite in the distance to see the wooden churches and buildings. Red flames swallowed them and their evil aura.

Madeleine hugged me. “I feel like the air will be healthy again here,” she said, smiling.

I took the kids back to town and saw Samantha bursting into tears of happiness when she saw Madeleine. I gave them each a kiss on the head. 

“Can you stay a little while longer, Mark?” Samantha asked. “I think you should stay a little while longer.

I smiled and nodded. The sun rose in the sky. Birds chirped a new song of hope and salvation. I closed my eyes, and we got inside the house.
