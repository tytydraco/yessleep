hey my name is Rob

I was always fascinated by reptiles, so when I saw a small anole for sale at the pet store, I knew I had to have it. I brought it home and set it up in a nice terrarium with all the necessary equipment. It seemed like a perfectly normal little anole at first. It ate its crickets and drank from its water dish like any other reptile.

But as the days went by, I began to notice some strange behavior from my new pet. It seemed to be constantly staring at me, its eyes following my every move. And when I tried to handle it, it would hiss and snap at me with its sharp teeth. I shrugged it off as just the natural behavior of a wild animal, but deep down I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right about this anole.

One night, I woke up to a strange noise coming from the direction of the terrarium. I got out of bed and stumbled over to see what was going on. As I peered inside, I was shocked to see that my anole had grown to an enormous size, easily the two times the size of a golden retriver, bigger then it had been when I bought it. Its skin was now a sickly green color, and its eyes glowed with an otherworldly intensity.

I tried to run, but the anole was too fast. It lunged at me, its razor-sharp teeth bared. I barely managed to escape its grasp and ran out of the room, slamming the door shut behind me. My heart was racing as I tried to think of what to do next. I couldn't just leave the creature in my house, but how could I possibly get rid of something like this?

I decided to call the pet store and explain the situation to them. They seemed skeptical at first, but when I described the anole's bizarre behavior and sudden growth spurt, they took me seriously. They told me to bring the anole back to the store as soon as possible, and they would take care of it.

I gathered up my courage and went back into the room where the anole was waiting for me. It hissed and snapped at me as I approached the terrarium, but I managed to grab it and place it in a sturdy carrying case. I locked the case and hurried out of the house, not looking back until I was safely in my car.

I drove as fast as I could to the pet store, my hands shaking on the steering wheel. When I arrived, I rushed inside and explained the situation to the store owner. He looked at me with a mixture of disbelief and fear in his eyes. "This is impossible," he said. "Anoles don't grow to that size and they certainly don't turn into monsters. Are you sure you didn't just imagine it?"

I knew I wasn't imagining things, but I couldn't explain what had happened either. The store owner promised to look into it and assured me that he would take care of the anole. I left the store feeling relieved, but also deeply disturbed by the events of the past few days.

I never found out what happened to the anole. I never went back to the pet store, and I never bought another reptile again. The memory of that terrifying night stayed with me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something truly evil lurking within that anole. I never knew what it was, but I knew that I never wanted to encounter anything like it again.
