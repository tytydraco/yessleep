\-----------------

  
It is strange. I expected that being able to let my name loose after so long would feel as if a great burden had been lifted off my shoulders, yet it has been so long since it began that it feels stranger to be rid of it than to bear it, as if I have to remember at every waking moment that I can speak it freely, and that someone else knows it as well.

If that has been a burden lifted, then there has been another burden put upon me to in its place. The burden of not remembering what I should. Of knowing that *she* remembers more of me than I do of her, and that though we could reunite in whatever way we may wish to, I still may never be able to fill the gap in my mind shaped like me and her. Though I may be able to fill it in small pieces through other ways, through *her* memories, if not my own.

Since that morning, I can also feel the grandmother’s presence, just as I had felt *her*’s before. But it is different. It is eerie and hostile, and I always try to leave it behind whenever it appears, but even then, it is as if it tries its utmost to follow me wherever I venture. It is like a flowing reminder of all that I would force myself to forget and lock behind in the bedroom above the library, all that I did not need to ever remember or recollect. The old anxieties and fears, the old woman’s piercing words which once she would not have meant; it all now trails me wherever I go, and taints moments which were just days ago so euphoric.

But those moments still linger, and I cherish them all the same, the voice and the words, the face and the form, I cherish it still all the same.

The night after I told her my name, we went again to the library, though it was stranger now to be there, while knowing what had just happened directly above us. That was the coldest day I had seen this winter, and all outside the manor was a milky void of mist, threatening to break in.

“I have few memories remaining from before my life here, yet I still get strange shivers when I encounter what I *should* know,”, I told *Eva*, “What was I to you? And what we to each other? I feel a sense of wholeness with you, but I do not know from where it comes.”

“All I know is that we were,”, she spoke slowly, “And then I was not. I did not know why I felt drawn here, after wandering aimless for so long, but when I reached my destination, I was sure that it was you, though it took long for me to regain my speech after so long lost.

“I am sure that we were important to each other, and though I remember warm memories and voices and faces which I know were yours, there is also present an abrupt void which ended it all, and then I was like this.”

“What was I like then?”, I asked.

“You are the same in spirit as I remember you from those days, but older and larger, for we were so young then, yet… there is something lacking there, as if you have grown tamer, perhaps it was just youthful hot-headedness, but it is different nonetheless. I do not know if it was age that is its cause, or something else that I was not there to see, but I wish to believe that no change could have made this reunion bitter either way.”

“Really? The company I have been in for years may have made me more timid. Can you tell me something you remember us doing together? Something warm, for there has been too much cold in recent days.”

She floated around me, her ethereal trail of misty hair swirling around her as she began.

 “This is one of the younger memories which I still remember clearly, around those days, I do not why, but you were often away by yourself, for hours or sometimes even days I did not see you, perhaps because you used to go here, and I felt strange for it. It was difficult to be alone in those circumstances, as I believe had been killer loose in the town then, and no one wished to be caught alone outside after dark.

“But whenever you returned, and though I did not wish you to leave in those moments at all, everything felt so much safer. No shadowy maniac was there to harm us, even in the dark, and to chase away the trickles of fear which still found us, we played around in the dark which we were told to fear. We pretended that you were the criminal, stalking me like prey in the dark, and though it was all a game, it was so natural for you to play that part then. I wonder if you could still manage to do that, after all this change, though which I am coming to believe has been for the better.”

I did not think that I could play that part anymore. The manor had changed me such that I did not remember that I was once like that. And that gave me a sense of unease; to not know parts of what once was me. All these ephemeral years I had not thought about the past, for I had little reason to, not remembering anything worthwhile which would have made me long for it.

There was a disturbance in my heartbeats.

“That must have been comforting, to make fun of something that made us afraid, though it seems out of taste to me now.”

The room began to feel strangely empty to me then, though *Eva* was still there with me, and that sense of unease only heightened as I stared around the room, my chest beginning to feel heavier. So much about myself I did not know; how many others would I have forgotten about who would have once been close?

 How many?

My heartbeats became faster and harsher, and almost by instinct I stood up from the chair and walked in frantic steps towards nothing, as my breaths became coarse and forced. I was not even half the person I had ought to be, and knew of what I had ought to be even less, having left behind so much

But something was wrong, even amidst the turmoil in my mind and agony in my heart, a part of me felt that this was not right, and then, alongside the agony and turmoil, I felt her cruel presence there as well, maybe I could have seen it, if my eyes had not been shut.

The words of that morning, and of all the days before she had passed, flashed in my mind. I should not have had the manor, nor this life, nor little else for how I abandoned all those who I did not remember anymore.

Was I even the same person anymore? After having abandoned so much?  What would I even do for the future of the manor, the one place where such miracles may occur?  Would it just go waste after I pass, as my predecessor had feared? Would I be its end?

I blindly took support of whatever wall was near as my balance collapsed on itself, I wheezed and almost gagged, clawing at the wall which I did not see in fear of my legs giving way. I struggled to breathe as my body ached and heart agonized me. But then a cold grasp pulled me.

My eyes remained shut and I could not even feel towards where I was being moved, all my senses were a painful blur. I had my hands covering my ears and eyes shut, trembling all over; I stayed like that for long before I slowly noticed that I was no longer doing it out of necessity. I opened my eyes.

I was lying almost curled up upon the ground, and *Eva* was beside me, in the hallway outside the library. My shoulders and arms felt cold, her grips on them still lingering in their senses. All the thoughts were still there as memories, but now they were faded and tucked behind the present moment.

“Are you alright? Speak to me!”

I looked around the hallway, the library door was closed. My breaths became calmer.

“Can you hear me?”

I stayed still, taking in the hall’s senses to see if I could still feel her presence.

“*Seliya!”*

Only then did I snap out of it, for that moment at least. For every waking moment afterwards, however, I would always have that lingering fear of feeling her presence again, and at times it felt so familiar to those earlier days when *Eva* first appeared, but with fear rather than excitement, that it was as if my memories were being distorted and mocked.

Not even when in the company which I had sacrificed it for could I escape her guile now.

\----------

Later on a different day, while lying sleepless in bed, unsure whether to submit to the morning or bide my time, I glanced out the window and saw a day clearer and brighter than any I had seen yet for months. The misty winds of winter had for long rendered my love for dawn vulnerable, and the sight of a sun unbarred by mist was too much to keep even me within those walls.

Once outside, I turned my eyes to the rare clear sky and then to grass and the stones and the trees, so rarely free of misty dew. I walked around the manor, observing the whole perimeter of the fence, and thinking of the birds which may soon arrive to a morning this clear. The grass made sharp noises under my feet, and a warm scent was brewing around me.

Then, as I turned a corner around the manor, I saw the Detective there in his usual spot, scrutinizing the fallen board as he always did. And he was not alone. Though it was harder to make her out in the light, I saw *Eva* staying close behind him, though he seemed fixated on the fallen board rather than her.

“Do you feel the morning’s warmth as well today?”, I asked after walking over to her, the Detective did not acknowledge my presence.

She continued staring at the detective, her expression almost blank, after several seconds she then spoke, “Why does he seem to not acknowledge me? I call to him, yet he looks through me even though I am certain that he can see me.”

I turned to the detective and called to him “How does the investigation go this morning, Detective?”

He turned towards me, holding the broken board close beside him, “Oh! I am sorry for not noticing you there ma’am, was a bit too focused on the investigation.”, he held up the loose board, “Though it’s going quite well; there was a break-in last night, I am certain, the culprit may be related to… all the other break-ins that have happened recently as well, though I do not wish to draw too many conclusions just yet.”

He looked at me as I spoke, and did not acknowledge her presence, though for a moment as his eyes were turning towards me, I could swear that I saw his eyes twitch for just a moment as they caught her; but he did not anything of her.

I decided to get him to talk more.

“Why do you still linger here, Detective?”, it was a bold question, “Why not move on? What binds you here still?”

The detective clasped his hands behind his back, and turned towards the side from where *Eva* was not in his sight, he looked forward towards nothing, a dreamy haze clouding his eyes.

“I… “, he stuttered, “I failed. Failed right when I was at the crux of setting things right. At the very crux of succeeding and letting people rest easy, I failed.”

“What happened? Who did you fail? How did you even die?”, *Eva* suddenly said, though whether he heard her or not, I did not know.

“Oh, but he didn’t get away with it, that’s for sure, though none of the innocent did either. But they could have, if I had been better, faster, more *competent*. I wish I had at least been the one to finally stop it all, but even that I could not manage; some of the victims were quite well off, you know? But others weren’t, some went unmourned, others were forgotten; and each of them was alone when it happened, how horrifying it must’ve been. All because of me.”, a needle pierced my heart as he spoke.

“The killings stopped, to be sure, but the fear lingered without the true culprit appearing, arrested or dead, he was just gone. I couldn’t take the brunt of the curses for that anymore; I wanted to stop it all. Yet after doing that, it appears I am just being mocked here again.”

He let out a long sigh.

“I wish I didn’t have to appear here- damn it all, I don’t even want to anymore. But I appear here every morning anyway, and so I guess I am not done, and as much as I wish I could forget, it is hard to do so when reminders of everything just appear beside me out of thin air.”

He was breathing heavily, and though he seemed pained, he tried his best to not show it. It took me a few seconds to realize that he was shivering.

“I-If you will excuse me, ma’am, it is getting quite cold here. I… would like to leave earlier today.”, he turned towards me a final time, and then I could swear that I saw him glance at *Eva* as well, though he did not acknowledge her still. He then resumed his previous position, and I watched as he slowly faded from sight before my eyes. He had never disappeared while in my sight ever before.

But even after he disappeared, the heavy breathing continued, and I noticed then that it was coming from both me and *Eva*. I took her hand in mine, but she did not return the gesture, instead staring at the spot where the detective had before been.

“Do you think I was…”, she began.

“No- we do not need to talk about that, it is too dark for such a beautiful morning.”, *And each of them was alone when it happened.*

“But that black-garbed figure! He may ha-”

“Please!”, I cried, “We can talk about that, but not right now, please. I have only so recently been with you again; I do not want to just yet go back to when I wronged you. Please.”

“You have not wronged me. I do not know where you have taken that from, but so be it, I will not push you to talk of this if you do not wish to.”

“No- I mean- we will talk about, just not now, please. I feel almost sick… I am sorry.”

She stayed there, continuing to stare towards where the detective had been, and towards the large gap in the fence which had not today been fixed. I hurried back inside, ignoring the breeze which ruffled my clothes and hair and would have been so pleasant mere minutes ago. I ignored it, and rushed back inside into the small entrance room, and there, I fell to the floor.

I lay there, shivering in cruel thought and despondency. I was breathless, though I breathed heavily and harshly, unable to calm any part of me for even a moment. I pushed myself to sit straight on the ground, reaching for a table to pull myself to my feet, and then I felt *her* presence again, and all fight dwindled in me as I waited for the worst of the anguish to come.

But I waited fruitlessly, for though I was sure that I felt *her* presence there, it soon faded away and I opened my eyes from the floor to a strange sense of peace that I had not expected. Perhaps she had just not been there then, and I only imagined her presence to add onto my own despair.

I thought of going back to *Eva*, to not delay what did not need to be. But I digressed, out of self-pity or just the simple desire to escape again, I did not know. I went upstairs, and fell asleep.

\----------

I did not dream.

I woke up at night, at what time, I could not tell. From the ethereal aura to which I awoke, I expected *Eva* to greet me when I stood up, yet she was not there. Confused, I stared out the window, to the yard ridden by the mist which had retaken its absence from the morning.

Amidst the darkness, my eyes caught a soft glow between the mist, I rubbed my eyes and looked deeper outside, to see that *Eva* was still standing there, beside the hole in the fence. At night.

I rushed downstairs and then outside, where no warmth was daring to linger from the morning anymore, as if it too was tired of everything happening around it. I was almost to the fence when I remembered that I should have brought something to defend myself with.

*Eva* was still standing by the fence, close to the tree under which she had stood all those days ago. I called to her.

“Why are you still out here? Please, you know what happened when you saw him the last time!”

She only noticed me then, and seemed distressed at doing so. “You should go back inside if you do not wish to face the *killer* again. I cannot let this go unanswered, but I understand if it you are still disturbed by it, I know that the past disturbs you greatly, and for that I am sorry.”

“This is too dangerous!”, I cried, “What else is even left for us to know? I abandoned you despite us being closer than anything else in the world, left you by yourself at times to pursue whatever I wanted here, *and that killed you*. That’s it, isn’t it?”

“You do not know any of that!”, she replied, her eyes seemed concerned, “Don’t blame yourself for that, neither of us know what exactly happened, though I have begun to remember more, recently. What was in the past must be left behind, we have each other, that is what matters most, is it not? I just want some final closure, to get rid of what made me fear the figure in black so.”

Footsteps on grass broke the seconds of ensuing silence then, and both our gazes turned towards the hole in the fence. I thought of heading back inside, but could not bear for even a moment to leave *Eva* there alone, though I was not sure how much she could even be harmed now.

His fingers first appeared from the gap in the fence, then his hands and arms, and then his face.

He looked just as he had several days ago, dressed entirely in black, though he had a larger knife. And just as he had done so before, he sprinted madly towards us, the movements of his libs were wrong, just slightly disjointed here, strangely pacing there.

*Eva* rushed in front of his path.

“Stop!”, she said, with the most contempt I had ever heard in her voice, “Do you recognize me?”

The Burglar- No, the *Killer,* paused his sprint, and titled his head like a confused animal as he looked at her glowing, ethereal figure, in the mist she looked divine in beauty unlike ever before, though it was an unfortunate moment for her to do so.

 There was an expression of confusion on his face, as if he could not fully understand what it was he was looking at, but that expression changed to a slight smile and glow, as if he had just uncovered some strange truth.

“Can’t quite recognize you anymore, but I believe I know which one you are. The last one, aren’t you? Oh how pleasant it is to be reunited here again! I was wondering for so long why that strange chill I felt before fleeing that day felt so vaguely familiar!”

I did not whether to speak or not; *Eva* did so before me.

“You did it then, you kil-”

“Yes, I did it, I did it very well!”, he interrupted, “You were so much smaller, it is almost impressive how much you have grown, especially while *dead*. I remember when I saw you first, someone else was there with you, I guess I know who that was now.”, he waved his knife around from his fingertips like a pendulum, “Ohhhhh, how scared you looked as I had pinned you down in that strange nook of yours! I had thought that you would be asleep, but it was so much finer when I saw that you were not, the name you screamed…”

“Stop it!”, I hissed at him, *Eva* was breathing heavily, just like I had often been reduced to, and that was too much to see, “Why are you even lingering here? Just move on to wherever you are awaited next, there is nothing here left for you.”

“No,”, he said as he turned towards me, “No, I can still more here yet. Perhaps you would like to be even closer to each other, hmm?”, he turned the knife and grasped in strongly. He took one large step towards me.

*Eva* was still between us, and she stood her ground as he took more steps. He then was right before her, as she breathed heavily and shivered from her own cold at his sight, then with a long step, he simply stepped through her, “You remember me too well to mean anything in this form.”

She screamed as he charged towards me, and I ran then as well, though I knew it would not be fast enough to avoid him. I hoped that if I could make it towards the porch, or make enough noise, another resident could aid us. No silver-tongued lies could work here as they had before. As I began my sprint however, a foot turned wrong on the ground and the world became slow as I fell.

I did not know what would happen then, my heart and mind nearly ablaze, but then I heard a loud thought clear in my mind, as if it was some noise for all to hear.

*You will not kill again.*

I tried to get up amidst the turmoil in my mind, though it scarcely succeeded as my foot twisted again.

*Be put in your place again, filth.*

I stood up again finally, but as I looked behind myself for why no knife had come to meet me, I saw the *killer* on the grass. Writhing and whimpering.

*You dared do so after what I did to you before?*

*Eva* was behind the writhing figure as well, looking at him with the same daze as I was. I cleared my mind for a moment as I looked around the dark, misty yard, and then I felt her presence, briefly.

*Begone from here. Begone!*

The killer writhed and whimpered on the ground, coughing and holding his hands over his ears, trying to cut away words which I could not hear. As we watched, he faded away as he had done so on that day, though he so now with cries and pain.

I felt her presence fade slowly as well, but this time it felt different, as if instead of fading it was only moving. I looked at *Eva,* who seemed as if she was about to ask something but now thought better.

“I am so sorry!”, she said, “You were only here because of me and could very well have been killed by him! Only because I wanted to talk sense with a fallen murderer!”

“No- No, it is alright. Neither of us must be alone anymore, at all.”, I looked at the spot where the *killer* had faded away at, “I do not know why, but he might be truly gone. Did you hear those words as he fell?”

“I did, though I was not sure where they were coming from.” she said.

“I do, and I need… a moment, if you are alright. I think I can get some closure on this matter. You can follow, if you wish.”, she nodded, though I did not know if she would follow.

I turned around and walked towards the stairs by the library wall, they creaked as they always did when I climbed them, as did the door as well.

The room was not pitch black as I had expected it to be, a single candle was doing its best to light up the bedside. I did not look at whether the bed was occupied as I walked over to the window beside it. Dust flew from the curtains as I opened them to let in the moon, though it had little light to give that night.

“Even now you open the curtains, while I have told you so much to not do so, hmm?”

She was on the bed, as she had been before, covered mostly by a large blanket long past its prime.

“All those times when I was there along with you, and you fell in anguish from the presence… those must have hurt,”, she said, “…I am sorry, *Seliya*.”

She took my full attention then.

“What do you know?”, I simply asked, “When I joined you… what about it do I not know?”

Her eyes stared directly towards the ceiling, strangely peaceful, “You just… wandered in once, I suppose. And I let you come again, and again, and again…

“I did not know how you lived when you were outside, but one day, you asked me if there was room was someone else as well. I was not that fond of the thought, but I did not tell you off anyway. But you did not return quickly then, as I had expected…”, her eyes seemed sadder.

“I was afraid that you would die from the grief.”

“So I took things in my own hands, the culprit could be dealt with. But you cannot bring the dead back to life, can you? You agreed to have those memories be eluded, but I was foolish. I should not have trusted the words of a grieving child. What would you have done in my stead, *Seliya?*”

I did not respond.

She sighed, “Well, the manor is yours now. Be it be reduced to dust or prosper to new heights, it belongs to only you, and *her* as well I suppose, I guess it *did* have room for someone else. I hope you are happy with her, for it doesn’t feel like she will move on until you do, so that’s a few decades to go I suppose.”

Her eyes closed.

“I wouldn’t have to close these if you hadn’t opened the curtains.”

Then she was gone, and the blanket fell to the bed.

I wonder how different things would have been if I had never wandered into her estate by chance, or if the *killer* had never found *Eva* alone by herself that day, if we both had grown up together as I had. I do not need these questions, though I ask them anyway.

I and *Eva* met in my chamber later, talking of the past and other things which I now no longer knew, though we moved then to the present as well, and even the future as we thought about us and enjoyed company which we had been robbed of for so long.

The next morning, the detective also did not appear. I hope he found peace, wherever he is.
