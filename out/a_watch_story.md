For starters, I've never done anything like this.  
I don't usually talk about this with anyone, because I'm afraid that my mental health and the social and mental perception that people close to me in my life have of me will change, but I don't know what else to do.  
  
This story is 100% true  
  
It was Thursday night, I had an appointment with a girl to go to a hotel, she's not just any girl, she's someone I've known for 8 years. My relationship with her is somewhat complicated, we were dating for a couple of times, we stopped being that way but we still had things between us.  
Eventually she met someone else, she got married and we didn't talk for two years, but she recently got divorced and we started talking again a couple of months ago.  
She's not a stranger, there are things I know she would do and things I know she wouldn't do.  
  
That night, we arrived at 9:pm, we got undressed and we both went to shower.  
She had a black bracelet and a black Casio watch on her left palm, which I found interesting, but didn't surprise me.  
  
In those two years that we didn't talk, I developed a special love for watches, a love that I told her about when she and I texted again, and I thought it was cute because she tends to do things like that.  
In the past, if I wore specific socks, she would buy similar ones, if I wore specific clothes she would wear them too, she even bought the same sneakers I had more than once, and I didn't find it strange that she started wearing watches after we talked again.  
  
We showered, and I took off my watch, since I couldn't bring it in the shower.  
In there we talked, I looked at the time on her Casio, we got out, dried ourselves off, and turned off the lights to start doing it.  
It was 9:50.  
  
I don't usually take my cell phone when I'm with people, so I didn't know what time it was, so I took her arm while we were together to see the time, it was 10:35.  
  
When we finished, we lay down a bit, everything was dark but her hand had the watch that glowed in the dark, so I could see the time.  
The tiredness made me fall asleep for a couple of minutes, but I got up to shower again.  
I talked to her, we went together and sleepily got back into the shower.  
We didn't bother to turn on the light, but the light from the bathroom window was enough to see what was going on.  
  
When we entered, I had her in front of me, she grabbed her hair and at that moment I noticed that she didn't have the watch, and our conversation was the following.  
  
"Did you take off your watch this time?"  
  
"No"  
  
"So?"  
  
"I don't know what you're talking about"  
  
"Your watch, why did you take it off this time to go in the shower?"  
  
"I don't wear a watch"  
  
"What are you talking about? I just checked the time"  
  
"I don't wear a watch, I've never worn one, just a smartwatch, but I didn't bring it today"  
  
"I saw you with a black Casio watch"  
  
"I would never wear a Casio... My love, you're dreaming"  
  
"I saw your arm twice today specifically to check the time, I know you had a watch"  
  
She just looked at me and said  
  
"Are you okay?"  
  
And, I didn't answer her.  
  
I looked down, I realized that while all this was happening, I felt really bad, like I was dizzy, like I didn't have the energy to stand up, so I told her that she could get out if she wanted, I was going to spend some more time in the shower.  
  
She saw me, understood that I felt bad and decided to leave.  
I stood there, looking down, going over every moment I had lived in the last three hours, vividly remembering her watch, the time, and even that I was going to take a picture to send to a friend who wanted a similar watch... And yet, I couldn't stop feeling bad, the feeling of emptiness, the feeling of dizziness, it didn't let me do anything, I froze and as much as I wanted to talk or move, I couldn't.  
  
I sat down in the bathroom and stayed there for a few more minutes, then I came out and she was lying there waiting for me.  
  
She asked me if everything was better, I told her yes, and we went to sleep.  
The next day I had to leave early, so I took my things and left.  
  
Since that day, I've been feeling really bad, I get constant headaches and the whole left side of my head feels wrong, my left eye is red, my nostril won't breathe, and I can't feel much in that whole part of my face  
  
And all that pain came from that night, last week.  
  
I don't know why it happened, and I can't find any answers either, the worst thing is that I really don't want to find them...  
It just makes me feel bad that I can't trust myself, what I see and what I feel.  
  
She would never do something like that, and the conditions we were in I don't think would have caused any reaction that would have made me hallucinate a clock either.  
  
It scares me to think about it, because I only have two answers... it happened, or it didn't happen, and either is just as scary. If it didn't happen, can I really trust myself? Can I trust my perception of time? What things are there in my life that aren't true?  
  
All I can do is cross my arms, and hope it never happens to me again.
