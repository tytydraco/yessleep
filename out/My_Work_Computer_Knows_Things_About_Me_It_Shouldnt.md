I’ve never been one for ghost stories or anything like that. I’m just a regular guy, 29, working a boring office job in a mid-sized city. But something’s been happening at work, and I can’t explain it. I’m posting here because I need to get this out, and maybe someone can tell me I’m not losing my mind. This started a month ago, and it’s getting worse.

I work in customer support for a tech company, one of those open-plan offices with glass walls and free coffee. My desk is in a corner, and I spend most of my day on my work computer, answering emails and troubleshooting software issues. It’s a standard Dell desktop, nothing fancy, locked down by IT so we can’t install anything or mess with settings. About a month ago, I noticed something weird. I’d left my computer on overnight by mistake, and when I came in the next morning, there was a Word document open on the screen. It was blank except for one line: “You forgot to call Mom last night.”

I stared at it for a good minute. I had forgotten to call my mom—she’d texted me asking why I didn’t pick up. But I hadn’t told anyone at work about it, and I definitely didn’t type that. I checked the document properties—created at 2:17 a.m., no author listed. My first thought was a prank, but my coworkers aren’t the type, and nobody else has my login password. IT confirmed the computer hadn’t been accessed remotely. I deleted the file, logged out, and tried to forget it.

A few days later, it happened again. Another Word doc, this time saying, “You’re out of milk.” I’d noticed that morning that my fridge was empty, but again, I hadn’t mentioned it to anyone. The file was created at 3:04 a.m. I started feeling uneasy, like someone was watching me. I checked my desk for hidden cameras, even looked under the keyboard. Nothing. I asked IT to run a malware scan, and they found nothing unusual. My manager, Karen, thought I was overreacting and told me to “stop leaving my computer unlocked,” even though I hadn’t.

Then things got weirder. One night, I was working late, catching up on emails. Around 8 p.m., my screen flickered, and a text file popped up. It read, “Why did you lie to Sarah about the party?” My stomach dropped. Sarah’s my girlfriend, and I’d told her I was too tired to go to her friend’s birthday party the previous weekend, when really I just didn’t like the crowd. I’d never told anyone, not even my best friend. The file was timestamped that exact moment. I shut the computer down, grabbed my stuff, and left. I barely slept that night.

I started keeping a log of these incidents, hoping to find a pattern. The messages kept coming, always at odd hours, always about something personal. “You shouldn’t have skipped the gym today.” “You left your keys on the counter again.” “You’re still thinking about that fight with Dad, aren’t you?” Each one hit harder, like the computer was digging into my thoughts. I stopped using it for anything personal—no emails, no browsing, nothing. But the messages didn’t stop.

Last week, I decided to test it. I thought about something specific, something I’d never said out loud: the time I cheated on a math test in high school and still feel guilty about it. I didn’t write it down or tell anyone, just held the thought in my head while sitting at my desk. That night, I stayed late on purpose. At 9:13 p.m., a new text file appeared: “You never told Mr. Jenkins about the test.” I swear I almost screamed. I yanked the power cord out of the wall and sat there shaking.

I’ve tried everything. IT reinstalled the operating system, but the messages came back the next day. I swapped computers with a coworker, but the new one started doing the same thing within hours. I even took a few days off, thinking maybe I was stressed, but when I came back, there was a file waiting: “Running away won’t help.” I’m scared to sit at my desk now. I keep my monitor turned off when I’m not using it, but I can still hear the hard drive whirring sometimes, like it’s working on something.

The worst part is last night. I was home, not even at work, and my phone buzzed with an email from my work account. I hadn’t logged in since leaving the office. The subject was blank, and the body just said, “I see you right now.” I live alone. I checked every room, every closet, even the damn crawlspace. Nothing. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me. I haven’t gone back to work since.

I don’t know what this is. A hacker? Some kind of AI glitch? Or… something else? I’m thinking about quitting, but I’m scared it’ll follow me. Has anyone dealt with something like this? I’m out of ideas, and I’m starting to think this thing knows more about me than I do. Please, if you have any advice, I’m all ears. I just want this to stop.
