In the early 2000s, I lived in a large New South city. Halloween 2001 came midweek which gave people an excuse to party both the weekend before and the weekend after All Hallows Eve. The weekend after Halloween, my girlfriend invited me to go camping with her and her friends while my best friend invited me to a party. I’m not a huge fan of camping so I decided to go with my best friend, who I’ll call Kyle. I’d known Kyle since college and I occasionally ran sound for various bands he played in.


Kyle’s band had been booked to play a college house party and he asked me to help him load the band gear in and out of his truck. He picked me up and my condo and he drove us to the edge of town. Kyle eventually drove across railroad tracks and parked his truck in front of a large victorian house surrounded by woods. The place looked like it had good bones but needed a facelift. The yard had obviously once been well manicured but had been allowed to slowly fall into shambles. We got out of Kyle’s truck and unloaded his gear to the rear of the house. There, we setup the band on a back porch overlooking a large wooded backyard. 


The house and yard were packed with college age people. A table had been setup with punch on one side and a keg on the other. Partiers would dip their solo cups in the punch or chug the beer. Others gathered around a bonfire. A couch was burning on one side while a couple made out on the other. 


I shook my head and laughed at myself. I was way too old for this party. I was in my late twenties. I’d grown up poor and determined that I’d never live hand to mouth as an adult. I’d put myself through college and gotten a corporate job. My friends from college, who probably thought I was becoming too square, kept roping me into their shenanigans. Like this party. I thankfully knew most of the band and their significant others pretty well so I just hung out with them at first. 


The band eventually started their set of rock covers. Much of the crowd from inside left the house and made their way to the backyard. I took that opportunity to wander into the house. The backdoor opened into the kitchen and as soon as I entered, the lights flickered. Maybe it was from the band sucking up all the electricity. Regardless, I immediately got a bad vibe from the place. A hallway led from the kitchen to the front living room. In the hallway there was a portrait of woman who’d reportedly had the house built in the early 20th Century. It was a large black and white photograph in an ornate frame. The eyes had been colored in dark blue. The original matron looked out us with an unhappy expression, clearly judging how we were treating her house. The lights flickered again. 


The living room was filled with cheap furniture and bad “avant-garde” art. I stood in the room, sipped a beer and chatted with some frat boys. They knew the tenants of the house. Each bedroom had been subleased to a different student. They all swore the place was haunted. Some of the people who lived there even had boyfriends who refused to sleep over. 


The band eventually ended their set and I made my way back outside to help put up the gear. Afterwards, I stood around with my friends, chatting. That’s when a member of the band announced his engagement to his long time girlfriend, who he presented as his new finance. I’d reached the age where that seemed to be happening to everyone in my friend group. We gave them a toast and settled into a night of drinking. At midnight, the newly engaged couple decided to leave. We wished them well and they walked around to the front of the house, out of our view. 


A few minutes later, we heard a train coming up from the south. As it got closer, it began to blare its airhorn. For those of us in the backyard, this felt innocent enough and we started to cheer. For no good reason, really. That’s when we heard an awfully crash from the other side of the house and the whine of a train throwing its breaks on. The crash produced a rhythmic thudding as, it would turn out, our friend’s truck went rolling through the front yard. 


We ran around to the front and saw the remains of the truck and the giant hulking mass of a mile’s long train. My newly engaged friends stood there in the front yard in shock. The guy shook his head and explained that his back wheel and gotten stuck on the tracks. The ramp over the rails had slowly worn away with age and he’d hit it at just the wrong angle. They’d bailed from the vehicle and watched as it got destroyed, helpless. He’d just paid it off. 


A secondary effect of the crash was that we were now trapped at the house. The only way in or out was blocked by a giant train. We took the couple around to the backyard and sat them down to calm their nerves. I wanted to go home but there was no way to leave the house. The vibe of the party turned dark. It would be a night to be remembered. I eventually made my way back inside to find a bathroom. 


The house somehow had an even worse vibe than it’d had before. From a back bedroom I heard someone counting. I went back to the living room and a partier shared that someone was struggling to breathe and they were counting her breaths. The tenants didn’t want to call for help because they were worried they’d get in trouble for the party. This didn’t sound good to me and I didn’t think these kids were mature enough to handle the situation. I hated being the adult in the room but I didn’t think I could not do anything. I made my back outside and found Kyle. I told him I needed the keys to his truck so I could get to my giant old school cellphone and call 911. Kyle, hearing my concerns, ran past his truck and crawled under the train. He came back a few minutes later with a young cop. 


The police, which filled the street on the other side of the train, had no idea that there was a party on this side. Kyle led the cop to the back bedroom and tried to open the door. It was locked. The cop looked at Kyle, unsure what to do. Kyle shrugged and told him to kick the door in. The cop kicked the door in and found a coed on the floor struggling to breathe. He immediately got on his radio and requested medical assistance. An ambulance arrived on the other side of the train and brought a stretcher under a train car and to the house. The medics loaded the young woman onto the stretcher and carried her back out the same way.


I went back to my friends and waited for the next victim. Who would be next to get off the island? I couldn’t know for sure but it sure felt like the old lady of the house was picking us off one at a time. I hoped she’d been sated already. We eventually heard that the young woman taken out on the stretcher would be okay. At 3 AM, the train finally left and we were able to leave. I piled into Kyle’s truck glad that no one had died. I should have gone camping.
