I don’t know why I’m posting this. I guess I just need to get it out. For the past two weeks, I haven’t been able to sleep without hearing footsteps behind me, without jumping at every car that pulls up next to me. There’s a part of me that wants to forget it, but the other part knows I can’t. Maybe writing this down will help me process it.

Two weeks ago, I was living my usual routine. I work from home, so my days blur together. That Friday evening, I had spent hours staring at a screen, replying to emails, and typing up reports. It wasn’t until around 8:30 PM that I realized I was out of coffee. I wasn’t planning on leaving the apartment, but there was nothing else to do, and I really needed coffee if I was going to survive the weekend.

I grabbed my keys, threw on my jacket, and headed out the door. It was the same five-minute walk I took every time I needed something from the corner shop. Nothing special. Just a normal evening, no different than any other.

The streets weren’t particularly busy, but they weren’t deserted either. A few cars were parked along the curb, and I passed a couple of people walking in the opposite direction. The air was crisp, and I could see my breath as I exhaled. I remember thinking how peaceful the evening felt—like one of those quiet moments before something happens that makes you realize you should have been paying more attention.

I didn’t even give the van a second thought when I saw it parked outside the store. It was white, unmarked, with the engine off. There was no one around it. Just an empty van. It wasn’t the first time I’d seen something like that. People park there all the time. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one who thought it was out of place, but I didn’t think much of it.

Inside the store, everything was normal. The aisles were dimly lit, the shelves stocked with the usual items. The cashier barely looked at me when I grabbed my coffee and paid. There were no other customers, and it was oddly quiet. The flickering overhead light gave the place a strange atmosphere, but nothing about it screamed danger. I grabbed my change, said a quick “thanks,” and turned to leave.

When I stepped outside, I saw the van again. The same one. But this time, there was a man standing by it, talking on a cell phone. I remember noticing how he looked like he didn’t fit in with the quiet street—like he was out of place. But again, I didn’t think much of it. People talk on their phones all the time.

I started walking back toward my apartment, my mind on the coffee I was about to make.

And then I heard footsteps.

It was subtle at first, just a soft echo of footsteps behind me. I told myself it was nothing—just someone walking at the same pace. But then it happened again. The footsteps matched mine. Whoever it was was keeping pace with me, walking just a little too close.

I glanced behind me, but didn’t see anyone. I kept walking, trying to push the unease aside. But then the footsteps grew louder. Someone was definitely behind me now. I could hear them clearly, just a step or two behind.

My heart started to race, but I told myself it was nothing. Maybe they were just walking in the same direction, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

I picked up my pace. The footsteps behind me quickened.

I turned the corner onto my street, walking faster now, almost breaking into a jog. The footsteps matched my every move. My breathing became shallow, and panic set in. I glanced over my shoulder again.

And there he was. The man from the van. He was standing just a few feet behind me now, staring straight ahead. I couldn’t make out his face in the dim streetlight, but something in his posture made my blood run cold. He wasn’t running after me, but he wasn’t walking casually either. He was just… there.

Before I could even process what was happening, he grabbed my arm, pulling me back toward the van. I didn’t scream. I couldn’t. I was frozen, like my body was too terrified to react. His grip tightened around my wrist, and I was dragged across the street, back to that damn van.

I tried to pull away, but I was too weak. He shoved me inside, into the dark, cramped backseat of the van.

I didn’t even have time to think. The man slammed the door shut, and I felt a sharp prick in my neck. My head spun. I didn’t lose consciousness completely, but everything started to blur. My thoughts felt foggy, like I wasn’t sure if what was happening was real or just some kind of nightmare.

The van drove for what felt like an eternity. The road was bumpy, and I could feel every turn. But I couldn’t focus on anything. I couldn’t process what was happening. I was too scared to even scream.

When the van finally stopped, I didn’t know where we were. The men didn’t say anything. They just pulled me out of the van and led me into a small, windowless room. My head was spinning, and I could barely stay upright. I was shoved into a chair, my arms restrained by zip ties. The room was bare—just concrete walls, a single light hanging from the ceiling, and a door that looked too solid to break through.

And then… silence.

It felt like I was in there for hours. No sounds. No voices. No movement. The only thing I could hear was my own heartbeat, thumping loudly in my ears. I kept expecting them to say something, to explain what was happening, but nothing.

No one came in. No one spoke to me. Not even a single question.

I kept thinking, “This can’t be real. They’ll let me go. This is just some mistake.” But the longer I sat there, the more I realized how wrong I was. I wasn’t going anywhere.

Hours passed. I don’t know how long, but it felt like days. I started to lose track of time, and I could feel myself slipping. My hands were numb from the restraints, my mind drifting in and out of clarity.

Finally, someone came into the room. A man in a suit. He didn’t say anything. He just looked at me for a moment, checked something off on a clipboard, and nodded. I wasn’t sure what was going on, but I had the overwhelming sense that I was being watched.

They cut the zip ties. Without a word, they forced me into the van again. I didn’t protest. I didn’t even try to ask questions. I just… followed. I was too exhausted.

The ride back felt shorter. This time, they didn’t stop anywhere. The van drove through quiet streets, and when it finally stopped, they shoved me out of the door and onto the sidewalk.

Just like that.

The door slammed shut behind me, and the van sped off into the night. I was left standing there, not knowing what had just happened, not knowing why.

I stood there for what felt like forever, too afraid to move.

I don’t know how I made it back to my apartment. I don’t remember walking there. My body moved on autopilot. When I got inside, I locked the door and just sat in the dark. I was too terrified to even turn on the lights.

I called the police, but when I told them what happened, they didn’t believe me. They took my statement, but they couldn’t find any evidence. No cameras. No witnesses. Nothing.

I haven’t felt safe since. Every time I leave my apartment, I feel like someone is watching me. Every time I hear a van in the distance, my heart races. I don’t know who those men were or why they took me. But the silence… that silence is the part that haunts me the most.

What were they waiting for? Why didn’t they say a word?

The silence felt deliberate. Like they were testing me. Watching me. Waiting for something.

I still don’t know if they’ll come back. I don’t know if I’m safe. And that uncertainty is the worst part.
