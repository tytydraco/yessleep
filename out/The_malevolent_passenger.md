There are certain rumors that cling to a place like the stench of stagnant water—unshakable, festering, retold until their edges blur. Our town has such a rumor, and it centers not on a house or a graveyard, but upon a lonely stretch of a county road, where the pines press inward like conspirators and the fog seems bred from the earth itself.

They say the road belongs to her, him, It—the hitchhiker. It takes many guises, yet its essence never alters: an intruder garbed in borrowed skin.

I began collecting these accounts not from idle curiosity, but from a gnawing hunger that no rational man should indulge. I sought out those who had seen the hitchhiker, spoken to them, ferried them through that black-boughed corridor of asphalt. Their words came haltingly, thick with reluctance, as though each syllable carved something irretrievable from their memory.

The first was a long-haul driver, one of those roughened men who seldom yield to superstition. He told me he picked up a girl in her twenties, backpack slung, smiling like she’d walked out of a roadside diner. They shared a cigarette. They joked about weather and wages. Then, mid-laughter, she leaned close and whispered in a voice not hers but something ancient and androgynous:
"You fat piece of shit. There's a reason your family left you! Now you will die choking, coughing black foam until what family you have left won't be able to look at you!"

He told me, he looked at her in anger and shock but she was just smiling, as though she’d said nothing.

He left her on the shoulder and drove until the sky bled dawn. He told me this while chain-smoking, his hands trembling so hard the ash scattered like snow. He died of emphysema less than a year after we had spoke.

Then came the farmer’s wife, a devout woman. Said she’d been driving home from Bible study when she saw a young boy on the roadside, clutching a teddy bear, so she stopped and opened her door to him.

He climbed in, the scent of mildew and iron hit her but she thought nothing of it other than she wanted to help the boy so she offered him water and asked where his parents were but he only stared. Then, with a sudden grin too broad for a child’s face, he said: "God doesn’t see you. He never did. When you kneel, you'd be better suited to be kneeling for cock rather than an empty throne."

The woman swore his face collapsed in on itself as she watched in awe, like clay melting in flame, before he simply stepped out while the car was still moving. She wrecked her Buick in the ditch. Since then, she hadn’t spoken the Lord’s name without trembling but then they found her dead inside the local church with the word slut written in blood across her forehead.

As if my curiosity wasn't already as piqued as it was, the sheriff himself—our so-called pillar of law—came to speak to me about how he’d once stopped on that same road as the others to offer aid to a middle-aged man in a suit, stranded and waving.

The man slid into the backseat, polite, well-spoken, until suddenly he spat vile epithets about the sheriff’s dead mother. Detailed things no stranger could know: the color of her coffin lining, the hymn she hated sung over her grave and then without missing a beat, started going into detail about the Sheriff's wife killing herself and his daughter being a dirty little whore.

The sheriff broke down into tears, then reacting on pure anger, he pulled over and hopped out of his patrol car with his gun drawn but he found the backseat empty. He retired two months after we had spoke and then they found him dead in a motel room with a shotgun in his hands and his brains splattered all over the walls.

So many stories, each wrapped in the same terror: the shifting of faces, the friendliness curdling into filth, the vulgarities that felt more like prophecies than insults. All ending in inevitable deaths, yet, for all the warnings, for all the trembling mouths that spoke them, my curiosity only grew. Some compulsion stronger than reason or faith gnawed at me.

I needed to see her. Him. It.

To know if the hitchhiker would choose a face for me.

To know what they would whisper in my ear before vanishing back into the fog.

No two witnesses agreed upon their features, save that all had felt a nauseous terror when in its company, as though some formless thing pressed against the membranes of their minds.

I had listened to these stories with the arrogant disbelief of one who thought himself immune to superstition and yet something in their fragmented accounts stirred me: not merely curiosity, but an urge—an almost perverse compulsion—to see for myself. Perhaps it was the same instinct that drives men to the edge of cliffs, the whisper urging them to step forward into nothingness.

So, one night, under a moon bruised with clouds, I set out. The roads were narrow and unlit, hemmed by skeletal pines that rattled in the wind. My headlights carved two pale corridors through the dark, yet could not penetrate the blackness beyond the roadside. The silence inside my car was oppressive; even the hum of the engine seemed swallowed by the night.

Then I saw her.

A figure, slender and still, standing at the gravel shoulder. The first thing that struck me was not her form but her composure—motionless, unbothered by the whipping wind, as if she had been waiting precisely for me. When my beams touched her, she raised her arm slowly, thumb out. My heart stuttered in my chest, for in that pale glow I could not tell her age or face. It seemed to shift as I watched: first youthful, then matronly, then something inhuman in its formlessness but when I blinked, she appeared merely as a woman of perhaps thirty years, with hair dark as pitch and eyes luminous, too luminous, in the cold light.

I stopped and then the door opened with a groan. She slid into the passenger seat with a grace that made no sound. Her scent was faint, metallic, like rusted iron.

“Kind of you,” she said, her voice warm at first, musical even. “Not many stop anymore.”

I nodded mutely and pulled back onto the road.

For a time, our conversation was unremarkable. She asked my name, and I told her. She asked where I was bound and I answered vaguely—anywhere, nowhere, I only wished to drive. Her laughter then was pleasant, almost girlish but then, without warning, her tone curdled.

“Your hands,” she remarked softly, “they look like the hands of a coward. Have you ever strangled a man? Or does your strength only reach as far as a woman’s throat?”

I glanced at her, startled. Her face appeared altered—the cheekbones sharper, the eyes sunken, her smile cruel. But when I blinked, she was again the benign stranger, gazing out at the forest with calm serenity.

“Forgive me,” she said sweetly, “I say such things without thinking. A bad habit.”

The road stretched on. My knuckles whitened on the wheel.

She slipped again, moments later. “Your mother never wanted you, did she? I can smell it on you. She prayed you’d be stillborn, but you clung, like a worm in her belly.”

I opened my mouth to speak, to protest even but the words shriveled in my throat. Her face in the dim light was now ancient, as though the decades had melted her skin. Her lips peeled back from teeth that seemed longer than before.

Then she laughed softly, as if the cruel words had never been uttered. “Oh, don’t be so cross. I tease.”

The air grew heavy. A stench of damp earth and rot filled the car, though no window was open. My ears rang faintly, like a great pressure weighed against my skull. I felt the sensation of eyes upon me, not hers alone but countless unseen gazes pressing from outside, beyond the glass, beyond the trees, as if the forest itself had leaned close to witness.

I drove faster and my breath came short. She hummed a tune beside me—low, droning, discordant.

“You’ll leave me soon,” she said after a while, her tone wistful. “But you’ll see me again. You all do. I wear many faces, many skins. Sometimes I am a daughter. Sometimes a bride. Sometimes I’m your own reflection, waiting at the bend in the road.”

Her head turned toward me then, slowly, impossibly far, until her chin nearly brushed her shoulder. Her eyes glowed faintly, like lanterns sunk deep in water.

“Do you know,” she whispered, voice thick with a guttural resonance, “what rides with you now?”

The headlights flickered. For an instant, I swear the road dissolved into a vast black plain, stars wheeling above and towering over all was a figure without form—wings, tendrils, limbs too many to count—its shadow falling across eternity.

And then in an instant, the road was back. The pines, the gravel shoulder, too. My car shuddered as though waking from a dream.

She was gone.

The seat beside me empty, though it was still warm, and the faint metallic stench lingered.

I did not stop driving until dawn broke.

I should have turned back. I should have left well enough alone but I tell you now, in the style of those ancient chroniclers of madness, that I know I will see her again. For in every reflective surface I have glimpsed since—in mirrors, in windows, in pools of rainwater—I have seen faces that are not my own. Some nights, when the wind is still, I hear her humming.

After some weeks since that first encounter, the days since had not been days at all but a disjointed succession of visions, interruptions and choked awakenings from half-sleep. The presence of that *woman* if such it is, had still yet to fully be departed.
Every road I drive, I search for her. Not willingly at first—God knows I swore never to tempt fate twice but rather as one whose wound festers despite his best efforts to bandage it. She does not merely haunt a single stretch of highway but rather, she haunts me.

It was a moonless night when I saw her again. My car, restless as my own mind, had carried me far beyond the town into the black reaches of county road where no lamp stands and where the forest presses close to the thin strip of asphalt. I had no intention of finding her, and yet—I saw her.

At first I thought it a trick of memory, merely a woman walking alone, thumb raised, the pale of her hand flashing in my headlights but as the beams struck her form I realized it was indeed her yet her face was not the same as before, nor was it different. It was a blasphemous compromise between the two, as though every feature were a composite of uncountable masks and yet no one mask stayed long enough to be trusted.

I slowed, though my heart implored me to keep going, my hands did not obey as they turned the wheel and then opened the passenger door.

She entered without ceremony. This time, her smile was wider, a thin wound of a mouth that curved too far.

“I knew you’d come back,” she said, her voice at once a purr and a hiss, at once the laughter of a girl and the groan of some oceanic beast in the deep.

My throat closed around words but I forced them out.
“I…don’t remember choosing to.”

“Oh, you chose. You always choose. That’s the curse of your kind—thinking choices are made in moments, when really they were made ages ago.”

I looked ahead, unwilling to meet her shifting face. “Where do you need to go?”

“Just drive.” she said quickly, then laughed like glass shattering.

I continued to drive as the silence stretched, broken only by her voice slithering in and out of moods. At times she was sweet, humming a tune that reminded me of childhood lullabies, only to stop mid-note and spit:

“Your mother hated you, you know. She told me. She told us.”

At other moments, she was vulgar—her every word dripping with obscenity, describing my own body in degrading detail, as though she could see through flesh and bone to all the ugly parts that even I dared not name.

“You’re rotting,” she whispered suddenly. “Right there—beneath the skin of your chest. You feel it, don’t you? A soft place. A wrong place.”

I did. God help me, I did. My hand rose to my sternum and pressed, and for a moment I swore the bone there gave.

She laughed again.

The forest outside grew thicker, the road narrower. I realized, with a coldness deeper than fear, that I no longer recognized where I was. The mile markers had ceased and the road signs vanished.

She leaned closer, her face flickering between girl, crone, and corpse. “Do you know what I am?” she breathed.

I tried to answer, but my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth.

“I am everybody’s last ride,” she said, grinning with teeth that multiplied the longer I looked. “Every lost man’s last companion. The hand they take when the road stops. The mouth that whispers before the long silence. Do you want to know where I’m really going?”

I shook my head, but she told me anyway.

“I am going home and you're coming with me!"

Her hand shot out, faster than thought and pressed flat against my chest. Fire and ice coursed through me at once. My vision blurred. I could see the forest bending away from us, trees contorting in terror as though they too feared her.

She leaned into my ear, voice a jagged rasp:
“Drive faster. Faster. Take me all the way in.”

My foot, traitor to my soul, pressed the accelerator. The car roared forward, the world outside dissolving into streaks of shadow and pale mist.

The last thing I recall clearly is her laughter—piercing, triumphant, unending. The road was gone, the car was gone and I was no longer sure where my body ended and hers began.

Now, as I scrawl this with what strength remains, I know she never truly left. She abides in the pulse of my veins, the tremor of my bones and in the black corners of every room. Perhaps she abides in these very words, so that when another pair of eyes trace them, they too shall see the haunting hitchhiker standing by the roadside.

Waiting.
