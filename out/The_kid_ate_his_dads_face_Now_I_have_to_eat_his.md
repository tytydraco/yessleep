[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kglhdg/the_kid_ate_his_dads_face_then_he_told_me_why/)

Jonah glares at me like he wants to strangle me. 

My pen taps against the clipboard. Impatient. Firm. 

“Talk,” I tell him.

“Why should I?” 

“Because if you don’t tell me what you know about Zipperjaw, we’re both dead.”

He folds his arms. Keeps glaring. “Whose fault is that? You manipulated me. Maybe this is your karma, prick.”

I nearly laugh. If karma exists, it’s not letting me off this easy.  

“You’re upset. I get it—I’d be pissed too. Maybe pissed enough to let a monster kill me just to get even with the prick that used me. So I’m not going to blame you if you don’t talk. But I also know you and I are different in fundamental ways.”

“Yeah,” he spits. “I’ve actually got a heart.”

“You sure do. And I wonder how that heart will feel knowing you didn’t just succeed in killing me, but all the people Zipperjaw kills after us, too.” 

That does the trick. 

His expression fractures, the anger crumbling to horror. “You... You can’t put their deaths on me. That's not fair.”

A smirk finds my lips. “Why not? I’m the only shot this town has at stopping this monster, so you can sit tight, keep quiet if you want. I’m a dead man regardless. But all the blood Zipperjaw spills next will be on your hands, kid.”

His lips start to move wordlessly, searching for some argument to defend himself, to justify why killing me is worth it. But then he heaves a sigh. Bows his head. The thing about people like Jonah is that they're so predictable. Tug on their heartstrings. Play with their shame.

It hardly takes anything at all to make them dance like puppets on strings. 

His shoulders slump with defeat. "Fine. What do you need to know to stop this thing?”

My pen clicks. “Let’s start with the name. Who handed you that curse?"

He takes a deep breath, cradling his bandaged throat. “This kid at school, Vishal. His cousins died in one of the cannibal-suicides, and the day after he went on livestream. That’s where I heard the name.”

My jaw tenses. 

If this Vishal kid sang Zipperjaw’s name all over the internet then—

“Don’t worry,” Jonah says, recognizing my building panic. “No one watched the stream. It was just 12 hours of Vishal walking in circles, crying silently in his grandmother’s living room. I dropped in to share my condolences, and he started mumbling something I couldn't make out."

Jonah reaches for his glass of water by his bed. Sucks it through a straw. 

“He was speaking too fast. Too quiet. It sounded like he’d lost his mind, but something told me to record the clip. I don't know. I guess I thought it might be some kinda cry for help.”

A shiver runs through him.

“The day after, Vishal didn't turn up to school. His grandfather found him dead, his grandmother's face in his teeth. That’s when I ran Vishal's mumbling through editing software, slowing it down and boosting the audio. I'd hoped to find some clue about the cannibal suicides, and what I found was..." 

"Zipperjaw," I mutter, a manic smirk tugging at my lips. 

He nods. "A few hours later, I heard a knock on my front door."

"A few hours, meaning midnight?"

Another nod. 

I check a handful of boxes on my clipboard. Flip the page. So far, everything seems consistent with the established lore. “The knock—describe it.”

Jonah hammers his fist against his bedside table. 

**BANGBANGBANG**

“It sounded like that. Heavy. Loud as all hell. Woke up my dad, I remember. He shouted at me from his bedroom, said if that was Ryan being a jackass again, then he’d call the cops and treat the kid to a night in jail. I told him I’d answer it, tell my buddy to beat it if he was out there. Meanwhile, the knocking got more frantic. Shook the entire house.”

**BANGBANGBANG**

“I booked it downstairs before my dad could make good on his promise, and that’s when I saw the silhouette through the fogged glass. It was standing on the doorstep with its back to me. I knew right away that wasn’t Ryan. Something was seriously wrong.”

I keep writing, not looking up from the clipboard. There has to be a detail in these words. A key to understanding Zipperjaw’s psychology, its behavior, and *rules*. A weapon I can use to defeat it. “Wrong in what way?” I ask. 

“For starters, the silhouette was tall. *Way* too tall.”

“Ballpark it.”

His face screws up in thought. “Seven feet, maybe. Could’ve been taller.” 

My stomach twists. I feel what might be goosebumps running down my arms, and I wonder how long it’s been since the last time I felt this kind of dread. “Did you call for your father?”

He shakes his head. “No, I was too shellshocked I think. That and…” He hesitates, shrinking into his bed. “There was a voice out there. A little girl’s. She said she was hurt and afraid, and that she needed help because a man was hurting her.”

I lower my pen, meet his eyes. “Tell me you didn’t open the door.”

“Of course I didn’t!” he snaps. 

His expression falls. “Or at least, I didn’t at first…”

You’ve gotta be kidding me.  

“I’d only meant to check on the little girl,” he says quietly. “To be honest, I didn’t think the silhouette was even a person—I mean, who in this town is over seven feet tall? Nobody. I thought maybe it was just a trick of the light or…”

He trails off, unable to buy his own excuses. But the truth is, I can’t blame the kid. 

We’re conditioned to believe there’s no such thing as monsters. If a giant shadow shows up on your doorstep in the dead of night, your first thought isn’t to grab the holy water; it’s to double-check if you took your meds. Add a crying child into the mix, and you’re liable to start behaving erratically. Impulsively. It's a tale as old as time. 

My grip tightens around my pen. 

*Is that how Zipperjaw tricked you, Adelaide? Did you think you were saving a frightened child, only to come face to face with a living nightmare?*

My pen snaps in my grip, ink exploding across the page like a bad Rorschach. 

Jonah gulps. “You... all good, man?”

I take a deep breath, burying Adelaide’s memory.

“You ever feel your purpose crawling back into your veins?” I ask him, snatching a fresh pen and page from the briefcase. “I feel better than I've felt in years. But let’s refocus. You opened the door—what did you see?”

Jonah’s mouth hangs open, the words struggling to form on his tongue. Slowly, the heart monitor begins to pick up the pace. That look on his face tells me everything I need to know.

It’s distant. Haunted.

It’s the look of a boy remembering the worst night of his life. 

“Jonah,” I press. “We really don’t have time for this. What. Did. You. See?”

His eyes scrunch shut. His body quakes with the sort of fear that carves itself into your bones. 

“I saw…”

The heart monitor starts to scream.

“... Zipperjaw.”

Now we’re getting somewhere. My new pen touches my fresh report, and I start to write like my life depends on it—like both of our lives depend on it. “What did it look like? Clothing. Anatomy. Give me everything you got.”

“It wore a dress,” he says, voice breaking under the weight of his trauma. “It was just scraps of clothing patched together, like it’d cut pieces from all its victims and then sewn them together. Denim. Plaid. There was a piece of a wedding veil. A rainbow scarf. And…” His voice putters out, hand shooting to his mouth to catch a sob. “And pajamas. The sort that only a kid would wear.”

That's new.

I’d been under the impression that Zipperjaw merely took lives, but its ritual went deeper. The monster took mementos, too. Souvenirs. That should have been clear in the police reports, but I’d missed those details somehow.

My hand balls into a fist, knuckles cracking.

What else have I missed, I wonder.

Jonah keeps talking, hands fretting on his lap. “It was facing away from me, standing backward on the front step, but I remember it had this jungle of hair that fell to its waist. Red. Dark. Not sure if that was cause it was stained with blood or…” 

His face pales, and he buries the thought, moves onto another detail.  “Its proportions were all fucked up too. Remember when I said it was tall?”

I frown. “Sure.”

“Well, it was—only parts of it weren’t.”

“Meaning?”

“Meaning its torso was like,” he spreads his arms outward. “Long. Like maybe six feet *long*. But its limbs were too short.” A shiver crawls through him. “Its arms and legs didn’t look like they belonged to it. They were too small. Too… young. It looked like it’d torn them off children and stapled them onto itself.”

There it is again, that anger boiling in my gut. My grip tightens around my pen. It takes everything I have not to snap this one in half, too. 

Adelaide.

Was that thing wearing my little sister’s limbs? Did it have her arms? Her legs? 

Was it—

The lights flicker. 

Die. 

Darkness floods into the room. 

Jonah shoots up in his bed, breath coming a mile a minute. “Was that you?” he gasps.

I slowly rise from my seat. “No.”

My ears strain against the empty silence. There should be ventilation. The beep of Jonah’s heart monitor. There should be that sickening ambience only a broken healthcare system can produce—but there’s nothing. 

“It’s here, isn’t it?” Jonah whimpers. 

Can’t be. According to my pocket watch, it’s just 11:31 PM, and  Zipperjaw’s legend is clear: the monster always arrives at midnight. 

Yet there's something in the outside corridor.

Footsteps. Bare feet slapping against linoleum. 

And a whimpering girl.

I tense. 

Jonah reaches out, grabs my shoulder. “Did you figure it out yet—how to kill it? Tell me you know how to kill it, man.”

“Haven't got a clue yet. Sorry.”

I leave Jonah slackjawed, drifting toward the door, bringing my pistol up on aim. The footsteps are getting closer. Heavier. 

**ZIP IT!**

The voice is titanic, deafening. It stops me cold. Gone is the whimpering girl. This is a man now, scolding and guttural and dripping with violence. 

***IF I’VE TOLD YOU ONCE I’VE TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES—ZIP IT YOU FUCKING BRAT!***

My chest tightens. The man. He almost sounds like—

The door shudders. 

**OPEN UP RIGHT NOW OR YOU’LL BE SORRY!**

Jonah yelps. I stagger back, heart ricocheting off my ribs.

*KNOCK.KNOCK.KNOCK.*

The whole hospital shakes.

My thumb pulls back on the safety. Finger on the trigger. This shouldn’t be happening. We had more time—we *needed* more time. 

“Just shoot it!” Jonah pleads. “Now! Before it comes in!”

No. It doesn’t work like that.

I grit my teeth. 

I’ve hunted enough of these nightmares to know that bullets might slow them down, but to kill them, you have to beat them at their own game. Use their own rules against them. 

The gun was never meant for Zipperjaw. 

It was meant for *us*. 

**BANG!**

The door splinters, a fist bursting through, followed by an arm. It’s decaying. Mottled. The hand starts feeling around, trying to find the door handle, trying to let itself in, but the arm isn’t long enough to reach. 

Jonah was right. This thing… It’s wearing the limbs of a child.

The monster wrenches its arm back through the hole. There’s a shift of shadow. A shuffle of fabric and then a creak like old bones bending down. It’s hard to see much with the lights dead—it’s just the faint shafts of moonlight I’m working with, but what appears next chills my blood.

It’s there, in the shattered hole: a zipper, curved upward like a smile stitched onto the face of a corpse. 

A small hand reaches up, begins to unzip the mouth. 

Then it speaks. 

It’s the voice of the man again, only this time it’s quiet and measured in a way that makes it all the worse. “I’ll be back at midnight,” Zipperjaw growls, “to teach you both a lesson you won’t soon forget.”

There’s a crack like a spine straightening. A violent snort. Then the footsteps begin to retreat; bare feet slapping across linoleum.

And somewhere, I hear a little girl crying.
