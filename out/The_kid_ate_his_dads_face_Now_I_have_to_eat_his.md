[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kglhdg/the_kid_ate_his_dads_face_then_he_told_me_why/)

The clock reads 11:13 PM.

My pen taps against the clipboard, impatient. Meanwhile, Jonah looks like he wants to strangle me.

"Talk," I tell him.

“Why should I?” he spits.

“Because if you don’t, we’re both dead.”

He folds his arms. Keeps glaring. “Maybe this is your karma, prick.”

I nearly laugh. If karma exists, it’s not letting me off this easy.  

“Look, kid. I get it. You’re upset that I used you.  I’d be pissed too, maybe pissed enough to let that monster kill me, so I’m not going to blame you if you don’t talk. But you and I aren't the same.”

“Yeah,” he says. “I’ve actually got a heart.”

“You sure do. And I wonder how that heart will feel knowing you didn’t just succeed in killing me, but all the people Zipperjaw kills after me, too.” 

His expression fractures, the anger crumbling to horror. It's the sweetest thing I've seen all night.

“You... You can’t put their deaths on me. That's not *fair*.”

A smirk finds my lips. “Sure it is. I’m the only shot this town has at stopping Zipperjaw. Take me outta the equation, and that thing's free to carve a bloody path through everyone you know. "

His lips start to move, searching for some argument to defend himself, to justify why killing me is worth it, but then his shoulders slump in defeat. He heaves a sigh.

That's the beautiful thing about people like Jonah—they're so predictable. Tug on their heartstrings. Play with their shame. It hardly takes anything at all to make them dance like puppets on strings. 

He grumbles something I don't catch. Folds his arms like the picture of teenage disdain. "Fine," he grunts, avoiding my eyes. "Tell me what you want to know."

Beautiful.

“Let’s start with the name. Who handed you that curse?"

“This kid at school."

"That's not a name."

His jaw clenches, and the next words are hissed through his teeth. "... Vishal."

"Better." I scribble it down. "What was the context? How'd it happen?"

"It was a livestream."

My heart pounds.

If this kid sang Zipperjaw’s name all over the internet, then—

Jonah waves a hand, recognizing the panic in my features. "Relax. The stream was a ghost town. Nobody else was watching. It was just 12 hours of Vishal walking in circles, crying silently in his grandmother’s living room."

"Why was he crying?"

"Why do you think?" Jonah asks. "His mom and dad were part of the string of cannibal suicides. He found his mother just before she bled out. I... I had dropped in to share my condolences, maybe tell him he could talk to me if he needed to...but then he started mumbling something I couldn't make out."

I frown.

“He was speaking too fast," Jonah explains, reaching for his glass of water. "Too quiet. It sounded like he’d lost his mind. The day after, Vishal didn't turn up at school. It didn't take long before the whole town knew why."

His body quakes enough to hit the Richter Scale. That means one thing. "Let me guess," I say. "Vishal killed Granny Dearest?"

The kid gives a slow nod.

"That's when my morbid curiosity hit a fever pitch," he says. "I ran Vishal's mumbling through some editing software. Slowed it down. Boosted the audio. I'd hoped to find some clue about the cannibal suicides, but instead I found..."

His eyes screw shut, voice puttering out into a stammering nothing. It's the sort of reaction that makes it easy to fill in the blanks.

Zipperjaw.

I check a handful of boxes on my clipboard, a manic smirk tugging at the edge of my lips. It's not that I find trauma amusing. Quite the opposite. But I do think there's a dark beauty when that same trauma can be leveraged for the greater good.

He swallows hard, knuckles cracking at his sides. Finds his voice again. "A few hours later, about midnight, I heard a knock on my front door."

“The knock," I say, not looking up from the report, "describe it.”

**BANGBANGBANG**

My heart jumps as Jonah hammers his fist against his bedside table. 

“It sounded like that," he says, staring at me. "Louder than all Hell. My dad told me to answer it, probably figured it was one of my buddies being a jackass. I practically ran down the stairs thinking I'd need to do damage control, and every second the knocking kept up. Got louder. More violent."

"How violent?" I ask.

Jonah holds my gaze. "It shook the whole house. Both floors. The windows were rattling like they might shatter in their frames, man."

A low whistle escapes my lips.

"I booked it downstairs, heard my dad fighting to get his pants on in his bedroom, cursing up a storm. That's when I saw it. Through the fogged glass of the front door. A silhouette."

Jonah pauses. Gnaws his lips. Eyes narrowing like he's trying to dissect a memory he'd rather bury. "It was standing on the doorstep," he says. "It had its back to me, and it was tall. Like, *way* too tall."

“Ballpark it for me.”

"Seven feet," he says, "or close to it."

Goosebumps run down my arms. It's beginning to occur to me just how little I know about this monster, and how little time I have before it comes knocking on our door.

“There was someone else out there, too," he says. "A little girl. Or at least I thought there was."

Now it's my turn to squirm. There's nothing in Zipperjaw's legend about a little girl, at least not as far as I've been able to put together.

"A little girl," I mutter, leaning forward. "Did you see her?"

He hesitates. Shakes his head. "No. But I heard her. She sounded hurt, man. Afraid. Kept saying her father was hurting her, begged me to open the door."

Christ. You don't need to be a detective to guess what the kid did next.

"So you opened the door, I'm guessing. Invited Zipperjaw inside?"

He shrinks in his bedsheets, shame written across his face.He grips his hair, tugs at it like he's trying to punish himself for his sins. "I thought I was helping a hurt kid. If I'd known what was waiting out there... what it would do to me and my father..."

He trails off, swiping a tear from his eye.

As much as I want to scold the kid, it's tough to blame him. Society doesn't exactly condition us for close encounters with bloodthirsty myths. If a giant shadow shows up on your doorstep in the dead of night, your first thought isn’t to grab the holy water; it’s to double-check if you took your meds. Add a crying child into the mix, and you’re liable to start behaving erratically. Impulsively. 

My mind wanders.

*Is that how Zipperjaw tricked you, Adelaide?*

*Did you think you were saving a frightened child, only to come face to face with a living nightmare? Did you suffer the same that*—

Ink explodes across the page like a bad Rorschach. I blink. It takes me a second to realize I snapped my pen, that I'm shaking with rage.

Jonah gulps. Looks at me like I might bite. “You good, man?”

My whole body is boiling, my veins flooded with the kind of red-hot purpose I haven't felt in decades. Grinning, I snatch a fresh pen from the briefcase. Crumple the ruined report in my fist. "Refocus. You opened the door. I'm guessing you saw Zipperjaw?"

Jonah's heart monitor begins to pick up the pace.

He nods.

“Describe it," I say quickly. "Did any features stand out?"

An entity's clothing can predict its psychology, while its anatomy can suggest weaknesses.

“It wore a dress,” he chokes out.

"A dress?"

"Yeah. Patchwork. Just scraps of clothing stitched together. Denim. Plaid. There was a piece of a wedding veil in there.  And…” His voice breaks, hand shooting to his mouth. “And pajamas. The sort that only a kid would wear.”

I grind my jaw. All this time, I thought Zipperjaw took lives, but it appears my boogeyman's ritual went deeper. The monster took mementos, too. Souvenirs.

Son of a bitch.

What else have I missed?

Jonah keeps talking. “It had this jungle of hair that fell to its waist. Wet and matted, almost like it was stained with blood.” His face turns a nauseous shade of green.  “And... And its proportions were all wrong. Remember when I said it was tall?”

“Sure.”

“Well, it was—only parts of it weren’t.”

I frown. "Explain."

"I mean its torso was long." Jonah spreads his arms outward for effect. “Like maybe six feet *long*. But its limbs? They were too short, man. Its arms and legs didn’t look like they even belonged to it. They looked like they'd be torn off children and stapled onto that... *thing*.”

There it is again, that anger boiling in my gut. My grip tightens around my pen. It takes everything I have not to snap this one, too. 

*Is that thing wearing my sister's limbs?*

*Did it have Adelaide's arms? Her legs?*

*Did it—*

The lights flicker. 

Die. 

Darkness fills the room like floodwater. Jonah shoots up in his bed. 

“Was that you?” he gasps.

I rise from my seat slowly. Shake my head. My ears strain against the empty silence. There should be ventilation here. The beep of Jonah’s heart monitor. There should be that sickening ambience only a broken healthcare system can produce—but all there is is nothing. 

“It’s here, isn’t it?” Jonah whimpers, eyes darting.

No, I think. Can't be. According to my watch, it’s 11:31 PM and Zipperjaw’s legend is clear: the monster arrives at midnight. Always. 

So why do I hear movement outside?

Footsteps. Bare feet slapping against linoleum. 

*Thump. Thump.* 

Jonah reaches out, grips my shoulder. “That's it. That's what I heard. Do you hear her?"

My throat tightens. The girl. It's faint, a whimpering so soft it might as well be a memory, but it's there. She's begging for our help, crying about her father. 

"Did you figure it out yet?" Jonah hisses. "Tell me you know how to kill it, man!"

I tense, slipping away from him. Jonah stares after me, slack-jawed as I drift toward the door, unholstering my Desert Eagle and bringing it up on aim.

The footsteps, they're getting closer.

Heavier. 

*Thump. Thump.*

A shadow appears beneath the door, soaked in moonlight. There's what sounds like a mechanical growl. A zipper coming unfastened. Then*—*

**A roar.** 

It stops me in my tracks. It's titanic. Deafening. Gone is the whimpering girl. This is the voice of a beast, scolding and guttural. 

***IF I’VE TOLD YOU ONCE I’VE TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES—ZIP IT YOU FUCKING BRAT!***

My eyes widen. The man. He almost sounds like...

The door shudders.  Something's pounding on it from the other side. 

**OPEN UP OR YOU’LL BE SORRY!**

Jonah yelps.

I stagger back, heart ricocheting off my ribcage.

***KNOCK.KNOCK.KNOCK.***

The whole hospital shakes. The whole world. This shouldn’t be happening. We had more time—we *needed* more time. 

“Just shoot it!” Jonah pleads. “Now! Before it comes in!”

No. 

It doesn’t work like that. 

I've hunted enough boogeymen to know how they work. Bullets might slow them down, but to kill them, you have to beat them at their own game. Use their rules against them. Turn their own twisted logic into a weapon. 

Unfortunately, I don't know enough about Zipperjaw to do that. 

My thumb pulls back on the safety. Finger on the trigger. A thread of regret plays inside of me. The truth is, this gun was never meant for Zipperjaw. 

It was meant for *us*. 

**BANG!**

The door splinters, a fist bursting through. It’s decaying. Mottled. The hand starts feeling around, trying to find the door handle, trying to let itself in, but the arm isn’t long enough to reach. 

Jonah was right. This thing… It’s wearing the limbs of a *child*.

The monster wrenches its arm back through the hole. There’s a shift of shadow. A shuffle of fabric and then a creak like old bones bending down. It’s hard to see much with the lights dead—it’s just the faint shafts of moonlight I’m working with, but what appears next chills my blood.

It’s there, in the shattered hole: a zipper, curved upward like a smile stitched onto the face of a corpse. 

A small hand reaches up, unzips the mouth. 

Then it speaks. Only this time, the voice is quieter, measured in a way that makes it all the worse: *“I’ll be back at midnight and teach you both a lesson you won’t soon forget.”*

**BANG!**

It hammers the door one last time.

There’s a crack like a spine straightening, followed by a vicious snort. Then the footsteps begin to retreat; bare feet slapping across linoleum, disappearing down the hallway.

And I'm left alone with Jonah.

Trembling.

Terrified.

I'm trying to think, trying to pull myself together, but I'm haunted by the same looping thought: that I recognize that monster's voice.

It belongs to my father.
