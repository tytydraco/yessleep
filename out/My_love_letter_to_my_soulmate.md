 

My love,

I am writing this to describe how much you mean to me.  How your very presence affects my life.  I don't have the courage to tell you in person, so this is the best way I can let you know.

The moment I first saw you; my world just stopped moving.  I felt like we were the only two people around.  Nobody else mattered, but you and me.  I only saw your image in my dreams, but I never thought you were real.  Seeing you sit there at the fountain and reading your book; is a memory I will cherish for the rest of our days.  I was only able to think of one word to describe you, perfection.

Your beautiful hair is the right color and shade.  I could just imagine what it would feel and smell like as I will run my fingers through that majestic mane.  I bet it will smell like lavender.  After all you have a Lavender scent perfume and hand lotion in your locker back in high school, so that would make it your favorite scent.  Which is why I gave you that Lavender body wash, on our anniversary.  Just picturing you scrubbing yourself with it makes me excited.

It was not easy figuring out where you were going after high school, but as soon as I found you, I immediately enrolled and got accepted to that same college.  It was so hard keeping my distance from you.  I could tell that you were not ready for a relationship. It was harder getting rid of those who wanted you for themselves.  I could tell that each one of them got on your nerves, and you hated the attention they gave you.  It is okay now; they will not be interfering with our love anymore.  

The way that they screamed and cried for their lives was pretty laughable.  I could not let them go free.  Even if they promised not to go near you again.  They might have told you about my feelings, and that would have been so humiliating.  I never want you to find out from someone else.  You deserve for me to let you know personally.  At least those bothersome people will not annoy us ever again.

Then after we graduated, you were able to get your dream job in that high end company.  I was so proud of you, that I had to send you those flowers and a diamond necklace.  I was so glad that you liked them since I saw the flowers on your living room coffee table.  I also saw that you wore the diamond necklace every day to work.  I knew that necklace would look perfect on you, but one day you just stopped wearing it.  I instantly thought you forgot about it, or even lost the necklace.  

I got you a new one to replace it, but you did not wear it.  That really hurt my feelings.  Why did you stop wearing the necklace?  You never even attempted to reach for it while getting dressed.  You truly are a sight to behold.  You are so perfect even when you look scared and paranoid, for some reason.  I was so worried when the light in your eyes was beginning to fade.  I wanted to know why you were feeling so fearful.

Then one day you just vanished.  I could not see you at your place anymore.  I was pretty sure the extra cash I slipped into your bank account would help you with rent, and any other bills you might have been behind on.  I was so worried something happened to you.  I nearly lost my mind.  Where did you go?  Why was your apartment empty?  You can't leave me.  You are not allowed to leave me.  

I had a hard time trying to find you.  It almost felt like you disappeared without a trace.  I was so close to ending myself, because without you there is no reason to keep on living.  I had to join you in the afterlife.  It was the only reason you were gone, right?  To lose you and your perfect being at such a young age.  

The perfect place for me to end it would be at your grave.  Looking for your grave was very difficult, for some reason you did not come up in the obituaries.  Why was your name not listed?  I searched in every state to see if you passed as a resident in that state, yet your name never came up.  If you were not with our maker, then where were you?

I had to find you.  After everything I did for you, and this is how you thank me.  Leaving me behind while you travel.  I bet you are cheating on me with someone else.  That is why you left me.  You did not want to be seen as a cheater.  It is okay; I never told anyone about us.  I knew you would want privacy about us, but I had to figure out where you went.  I never wanted you out of my life again.  You belong to me and only me, no one else deserves to be in your perfect presence.

It is a good thing that I swiped your phone while you were asleep.  It was a little hard to find you since you got a new phone with a new number.  I even tried to follow your bank records, but you closed that account and opened a new one.  Luckily you never changed your email address.  I did not want you to feel like I was stalking you, but I memorized your email and found out where you last opened it up.

You were just a few states away from me.  It was okay.  I just hopped on the next flight to your city.  It was really difficult to see you.  I was impressed by how much you changed your looks.  You looked stunning just the way you were before.  Why did you change your natural beauty?  And more importantly, who is that man you were with?

It just cannot be!  I am hurt that you would cheat on me.  He must have seduced you into changing everything about you.  He must be the catalyst for all that has happened, right?  I thought I got rid of all the rivals for your love, but it seems I had missed one.  I will make him rue the day he ever met you.  He is not worth your time, or for you to think about.  He will be someplace where no one can find him.  

By the time you finish reading this; I will be waiting outside your door.  It is time for us to cement our love for each other and be together forever.  All you have to do is open the door and we can finally become one.  After all, only I deserve to have your perfect being.

Love, Your one and only Soulmate.
