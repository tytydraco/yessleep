I, 13 F, have lived a life full of ups and downs. 
As a teenager, I’ve had some great friends and just some real assholes in my life. One of those assholes was my dad.

My dad cheated on my mom when I was 6 (March 2016), and I remember the night I found out. I slapped him across the face and then stormed out and cried with my mom. 

My parents are still married and living together for “the sake of my mental being”. 

Before I start, I must say that I don’t live in a rather big house, my family had always been ranged in the middle-high class yet we don’t want to buy a bigger house. I also share a room with my mom to sleep in, because my parents aren’t comfortable with sleeping in the same room as each other and we don’t have any other available rooms in the house except for the freezing guest bedroom.

The night where I found out about my dad’s horrid secret was the first night that I had sleep paralysis. 

I had a nightmare that there was a woman downstairs laughing like a maniac but I couldn’t tell where she was in the house. I knew she was somewhere in the kitchen because of how far it sounded, but I just remember trying my best to open my eyes, telling myself to wake up. I was also in the same exact position as where I was when I fell asleep.

I didn’t know what it was but it frightened me so much, as I was just a little kid.

I’ve always been skinny and weak, and these sleep paralysis dreams would drain me physically, even though I did nothing in those dreams.

My second sleep paralysis dream was when I was 10 (April 2020) The night before this nightmare was full of crying. My dad had threatened to leave and that I’d be sitting out on the streets. 

This nightmare was similar to my previous sleep paralysis dream, where I heard a woman laughing like crazy. But this time, I felt as if she was closer. It sounded like she was in the dining room now, because the sound of her laughter echoed throughout the house.

I woke up, paranoid. I couldn’t do anything but hug my mom a little tighter to fall back asleep. 

My next sleep paralysis dream(s) occured in March 2023. 

I wasn’t the happiest at the time, but there was certainly nothing in my life that really bothered me a whole bunch. 

I was on my bed, with my heated laptop on my lap with incompleted assignments and slideshows on it. I had earphones on, with various K-POP music blasting through my ears.

My next dream was me, still sitting on my bed with my hot laptop on my lap. I still had my earphones on but no music was actively playing. I heard the laughing, again. it got even closer. It felt like she was on the staircase now, climbing up getting ready to meet me. 

Again, I tried opening my eyes but it felt like as if someone had sewed them shut. 

I had another nightmare the next night. This time she was at the top of the staircase.

Next night, she was in the hall.

Next night, she was outside of my room.

The last time I had a sleep paralysis dream was two weeks ago, getting ready to open my door. 

I’m scared to have another nightmare as I don’t know what could happen. Is there any way to prevent it?
