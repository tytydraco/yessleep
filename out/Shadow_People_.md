I was young at the time but the memory of seeing the thing is still clear in my head, I was maybe 10 at the time and i have two older sisters one was 16 and the other was 12, the oldest was getting ready for school while me and my other sister were still sleeping as we started school later in the day.  

 I woke up before my alarm went off and just laid there til i fell back asleep, I turned on my side to get more comfortable but then i froze, seeing a black figure standing in the corner of the bedroom closet and bedroom door. What I was seeing couldn’t be real, I blinked a few times to see if it would go away but it didn’t, i took a sock that was laying on the bed and threw it at the thing and it made contact. 

My whole body felt cold but i was sweating, at the time we had a bunk bed and i was on top so i couldn’t wake my sister up as she was on the bottom, the eyes on the thing weren’t red but they were bright maybe yellow or white, it felt like it was staring into my soul i didn’t want to move, not even to pull the covers over my head so i laid there watching it as it watched me.

 I must’ve fallen asleep because i don’t remember much but waking up to my mom coming into the room to get us ready for school, i’m just glad the thing didn’t move towards or me anything, there wouldn’t have been anything i could do but let it get me or attack me but it didn’t so hopefully i won’t have to experience that again, i’m still in the same house and same room that i seen the shadow person in but both of my sister have long moved away into they’re own homes. My eldest sister now has a basement and she always see shadow people, she tells me they’re harmless as long as your polite to them, she’s very spiritual and into the whole crystal thing so i believe her. 


My mom who also moved away lives in her own house sees shadow people but hers seem more aggressive, she wakes up with scratches and bruises on her body and she doesn’t know how they got there, i spent the night at her house only a handful of times and never got a scratch thank goodness but i’m still wary of spending the night there, she always hears the floor creak and maybe it’s just the house settling because it’s old but a old house does have secrets. 

I can’t say for sure if i believe in ghost or shadow or anything related to the paranormal but I did have a first hand experience, people have always talked about they’re experience and what happened to them and of course i was skeptical some people are but that doesn’t mean they’re lying i can see that now. People might not even believe my story but it’s definitely good to get it out now that the memory came flooding back to me.
