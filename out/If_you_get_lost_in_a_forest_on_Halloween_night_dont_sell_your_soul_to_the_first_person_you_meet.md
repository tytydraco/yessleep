“Goddammit, I think he's lost us,” Vern said with a snarl. 

“I think we've lost us,” I replied, trying to get him to crack a smile. No budge. 

Everywhere I looked was like a mirror image of my previous view. Unending trees blurred together in the darkness, and neither of us had a flashlight. The moon barely pulled its weight, illuminating the area just enough that we could put one foot in front of the other. There was originally a group of six of us, who all sprinted after Eric, this weedy kid carrying a bag of candy larger than he was. He ran into the forest and we all tailed him, although the other four stopped their pursuit as soon as he dropped his trick-or-treat bag. Only Vern and I continued after the runt, eager for some more fun. Despite his usual aversion to physical activity, Eric managed to give us the slip. Personally, I blamed Vern. He was a big guy, and the skin tight spiderman costume “constricted his thighs”, or so he said. I didn't risk a glance to prove it. 

“Which way did we come from?” Vern bemoaned. 

I slowly rotated until I returned to the spot I began at. In truth, I had no idea, and had lost all sense of direction early in the chase. Despite this, I started walking confidently forward. Vern snorted in his usual way and followed. I had never really been through this forest, even though I only lived a five minute walk from it. I wasn't a fan of nature, and generally stuck to the neatly trimmed and well sign-posted park that lay next to the woods. I wasn't thrilled about finding myself lost in them on Halloween night, and had started to feel scared. I wouldn't show Vern that though. I didn't particularly like him, nor did anyone, but I knew I had to keep up my general masculine image while I was in his presence. I felt the chill of the wind hit me, and pulled up the zipper on my Michael Myers costume. The costume itself was just a grey mechanic's jumpsuit, one I'd borrowed from my older brother Mack. I wasn't able to source a good mask in time so had to make do. 

A primal fear comes from being lost in the woods at night. It must originate from our ancestors, those who misjudged the sun's position in the sky and were left in total darkness with no way to start a fire. Back then, they were sure to freeze. But in the modern day, people feel far removed from the threat of night. I no longer am, however, not after that night. I couldn't think of a worse person to get lost with. Vern was a hateful slob, who had not been given anything resembling an invite to spend the night with my friends and I. He simply latched onto our group while we were hanging around our school, trying and failing to toilet paper it. We'd spent the time since then trying to shake him off. I can remember when it dawned on me that I was just collateral damage when they finally did manage to abandon him. And it was just us two, alone, trying to find a paved road. 

“Hey Ernest, what the fuck is that?” Vern said, stopping me. 

From what I could see, we had just reached the top of a slight ridge. In front of us was a miniature valley which led into another incline, all covered in trees. It was too dark to make out any details of what was on the next hill other than the faint outline of yet more trees, and a light. A light which, by my best guesstimate, stood around six feet off the ground. It flickered in a low orange, and I became certain that it was a candle. I turned to Vern and told him that I didn't know. Before I could say anything more, he started to trudge towards it. Piles of leaves crashed underfoot and he made an unsteady descent. I stayed where I was, my eyes fixated on the light. It remained where it was, flicking back and forth gently, until Vern drew near. Suddenly, it moved to the side and disappeared behind a tree. Startled, I shouted down to Vern, whose eyes were fixated on the ground, searching for roots that might trip him up. It hit me what the source of the light may be. The realisation made my blood run cold. I ran down to Vern, grabbing his shoulder and beginning with my story. 

My older brother first told me it a few years before that night. As far as I can remember, it was nothing more than a local legend, one unknown outside our small town. It was Halloween of 1978. A group of teens were partying out in the woods, these woods. They had constructed a small tower of wooden pallets and branches, and had set it ablaze. The bonfire roared all through the night. One of the teens, whose name changes with every retelling, was forbidden by his parents from going to the party. He used the guise of taking his younger brother out trick or treating to sneak off to the party, a plan that went off without a hitch. There was a problem, however. The small child grew tired and anxious, and begged to be taken home. His older brother, drunk for the first time in his life, pushed him away. He went stumbling back, losing his footing and falling into the flames. Every Halloween night since, the burning ghost of this child has been spotted at least once, always wearing the clown costume he died in. I shuddered at the thought that the light I saw was the orange glow always said to accompany his spirit. 

I recited this verbatim to Vern, who laughed it off with a snort. 

“I'm thirteen, not three,” he said, "I don't believe in ghosts.”

Despite his outward lack of fear, he joined me in hurrying briskly away from where the light had stood. More aimless trudging followed. By this point, I could barely see the trees, which seemed like knotted, bony claws in the darkness. Our journey was guided by the small illuminated patches of waning moonlight that peeped through the canopy. 

Back then, barely any children owned phones at my age, and I wasn't one of those lucky few. If you were in our position nowadays, you'd have a flashlight and a way to call home at your disposal. We had neither, and our grand plan of getting out of the woods was walking in one direction until we hit a trail. In the now almost pitch blackness, it was impossible to tell if we were walking in one direction or if we were stumbling in an endless circle. The thought of spending the night sleeping out here terrified me, as my mind was flooded with stories of lost hikers succumbing to the elements. I wish I'd listened to my mother and brought my coat with me, instead of forgoing it for the sake of the costume. I couldn't imagine how Vern must've felt, wearing nothing but a thin layer of fabric. If he was struggling, he didn't show it. After another while of walking, it was he who broke the silence. 

“This is your fault,” he said coldly. 

I turned to him, my jaw slack in shock and annoyance. I could barely see him, but could tell he hadn't even bothered to look at me as he cast blame. 

“How is this my fault!?” I shouted back at him. 

For some reason, I didn't feel like raising my voice too much. There was a strange serenity in the forest, like an unspoken rule that silence was mandated, for anything other than the trees and the wildlife. 

“You led me here!” Vern replied. 

“Led you!?” I said, “you were running in front of me! How could I lead you anywhere?”

“You were pushing me on from behind,” Vern snorted, and then, “you're a bad influence.”

My brain hurt from the revision. I wasn't usually one to go chasing after a smaller kid, but there had been something in the air tonight. Maybe it was just the effect of the fistfulls of candy. Either way, Vern certainly wasn't a saint, and it took me two hands to list the amount of times I'd seen him make someone cry. I was about to protest, to argue, or just swear at him, but I restrained myself. Right now, Vern was the only other person in the world, and I didn't want to make enemies with him. Instead, I just took a deep breath out and kept walking in silence. When Vern didn't provoke the reaction he expected, he made more of a fool of himself. 

“Well I'm gonna find my own way out,” He said and turned around in a huff. 

I stopped and went to tell him that he was being an idiot, but noticed he was now frozen to the spot. I turned, following his gaze. Behind us, far off into the darkness, was a light. The same distant flame I saw earlier. Before I could say anything, Vern let out a high pitched scream and ran. I swore and bolted after him. My story must've gotten to him more than I thought. As I ran, careful not to fall over any of nature's debris, I repeatedly glanced over my shoulder. The light was following us, bobbing gently as whatever it was attached to sprinted with ease through the trees. I couldn't begin to make out its silhouette, and had no idea whether it was animal or man. I ducked and dived between low branches and creeping roots, but Vern wasn't as lucky. We tripped, landing on the carpet of fallen leaves with a hard thud. Unable to stop myself, I tripped over his crumpled body and we both went tumbling down a small slope. We landed in a heap, exhausted.

“I think I broke something,” Vern moaned. 

He hadn't. My knees were grazed, and my jacket was covered in decomposing foliage, but other than that I was fine. I stood and helped Vern to his feet, one of which was mildly sprained. We brushed ourselves off, then saw something terrifying. Standing at the top of the slope was a figure, dark and unrecognisable, wearing what I thought was a long cloak. The shred of moonlight behind him made his large top hat visible. I felt a pounding fear return before the man spoke. 

“Are you poor boys ok?” He asked in a British accent, “you took quite the fall.”

It suddenly occurred to me that not everyone you could bump into out here was an ax wielding maniac. I watched, still cautious, as the figure approached us. I studied him for a source of the light, but found none. He stopped directly in front of me, where a shred of moonlight was finally able to illuminate his features. His face was pale and detailed, with every wrinkle seeming like a small canyon. His grin was wide and his nose was hooked. His eyes were milk white, other than black pinpricks in the dead center of each. He had strange facial hair, a pencil thin beard that ran under his bony chin and up into his equally thin sideburns. The man's hair was a mystery, covered entirely by his Victorian top hat. In fact, every piece of his clothing seemed like that of a Dickensian factory owner. A dark, heavily buttoned and archaic overcoat covered his slender frame, and brushed against the forest's floor. 

“We're,” I glanced at Vern, “fine. I guess.”

“I see,” said the slender man, “well how rude of me, my name is Lanthorn. You boys can call me Mr Lanthorn. Now what are your names?”

“Vern,” said Vern. 

I elbowed him. Despite the strange calmness that radiated from him, I didn't trust this “Mr Lanthorn”. His appearance was one thing, but his presence in the woods, this deep and this late at night, was what really warped his image for me. After I refused a reply, he fixed his sickly eyes on me. 

“Michael,” I finally answered.

“Well Micheal, Vernon, it is lovely to me you,” Mr Lanthorn said, extending his arm. 

In an act of politeness, I, then Vern, shook his hand. It was sinewy and hard, and I retracted from his cold grip as soon as he let me. After the introduction, he did something I wish he did sooner. From somewhere with his coat, he produced a small gaslamp. Turning the nozzle, Mr Lanthorn lit up the clearing. For a second, I thought I had finally found an answer to the mystery of what had been following us. But I soon realised that the dull light that came from the lamp's coned lid was nothing like the pinprick flame I saw earlier. 

“Now,” Mr Lanthorn began, “do you boys need my help?”

I didn't reply, but saw Vern nod vigorously in my peripheral. Lanthorn grinned, and reached into his coat with his free hand. 

“Well you're in luck,” He said in a singsong tone and pulled two objects from about his person, and handed them to Vern and I. 

In my waiting hands, he deposited a small packet of seeds. The packaging was old and paper thin, but otherwise looked normal. There was a pulpy painting of pumpkins on the front, next to a grinning, youthful gardener. The style reminded me of that used in comics in the 1950s. The word “Pumpkin seeds” framed the image in a circus font. I turned the packet over in my hand to read the planting instructions. “Recently lost a loved one, or other treasured acquaintance?” began the header. Beneath, the short blurb read; “Plant with the forgone after rot has set in. Water regularly with the essence of man. Waiting time - three to four months. Harvest conditions - waxing crescent moon.” I looked confusedly at Vern, who was turning a rusting, silver dog whistle over in his hands. Moments before he blew into it, I put a cautious hand out to stop him. 

“How does this help us with being lost?” I asked Mr Lanthorn, who was watching us eagerly. 

“You boys are lost?” He asked rhetorically. “Well why didn't you say!?”

He quickly snatched both the seed packet and dog whistle from us, sliding them back into his coat. He handed the gas lamp to Vern as he rummaged around in his many pockets. Lanthorn's sickly hand had finally slipped into his back pocket, and he exclaimed “aha!” I watched as he took out a tightly rolled tube of paper. He gave it to me, and began to explain with the same singsong cadence as earlier. 

“It's a map, my dear boy, one that will help you find your way out of these woods.”

“Oh, thanks,” I said, taking it from him with unease. 

I looked at Vern, who now had a similar level of distrust.

“Well,” I began, “we should really get going. Thanks for all your help Mr Lanthorn.”

“I'm glad I could be of some assistance,” Lanthorn exclaimed. 

Slowly, as the strange interaction came to its natural end, Vern and I began to back away. Before we could turn and run, Mr Lanthorn spoke again. 

“Oh boys, one more thing,” He said as he wrapped his hand around his mouth and pulled. 

I realised that his strange facial hair was not a thin beard, but a seam. Mr Lanthorn's skeletal hand clutched his face, taking it off with a pop like a halloween mask. Hidden beneath was his hollowed-out head. Resting in the center was a candle. I recognised its hypnotic flicker, as it was one I had seen, and been tormented by, earlier. I let out a shrill scream, as did Vern, as we both turned and sprinted. Our way was now guided by the shine of the gas lamp. Trees and other matted foliage came in and out of the cone of light at an alarming rate. I soon overtook Vern, who ran with a limp, and saw my panicked shadow trail ahead of me. We did not stop until our lungs burned and our feet were sore. By the time we came to a halt and caught our breaths, we were confident that we were far enough away from Mr Lanthorn, although the fear that we could spring out from behind any corner remained. We stood bent double and panting, and I realised what I had in my hand. 

“What… what the fuck is going on!?” Vern asked between vacuous intakes of air. 

I ignored him, and as he continued to rant to himself, I unfurled the map. Its crumbling paper was the colour of milky tea. It lacked any real detail, being just a crudely drawn forest. Two-dimensional trees stood either side of a basic line that curved like a snake through the middle of the map. At the base, the words “You're here” were written in barely legible cursive. At the end of the squiggle, the single word “home” had been stamped. I examined every inch of the piece of paper, but found no more hint on how to get out. 

“Is it any help?” Vern asked once he realised I wasn't listening to him. 

“It might be,” I replied, looking up at the endless trees in front of me, “I think we should go straight ahead. 

And we did. Constantly looking around for any flicker of Lanthorn, we continue forward, following the vague directions of the map. Every foreign snap of a twig or cry of a bird made my hair stand on end, but at least we had a source of light now. The lamp meant safety. As we could now see where we were going, we began to move at twice the rate we had earlier. We traversed through a thick fog of fear, our steps still cautious despite the new pace. I would consult the useless map every so often, although the “You are here” sign never changed position. Not that I thought it would. The night was cold and I'd spent most of the aimless journey shivering.  The encounter with Mr Lanthorn was not exactly a distant memory, but our bizarre encounter felt less like the primary threat the more the wind set it. Vern's teeth were chattering, and I wasn't too far behind. Worse, the guiding light of the gaslamp started to wane. It was now just a dull shine, barely outdoing the moonlight. It felt like we'd been walking for hours, but I never really knew how long it was before we started to see the glow of the town. The gaslamp was almost out as we finally made it through once thought to be an endless patch of tree growth and out towards the suburban row of houses. 

“Finally!” Vern exclaimed as he ran the last stretch. 

I followed close behind, but my relief was muted. Something was wrong. I quickly realised the glow came not from the homes, but the sky. The sky was a dark orange and filled with black clouds like ash. The moon was full, fuller than I'd ever seen, and bore a strange, geometrical face like a skull. It shone a brilliant yellow, forgoing the need for the lamp. Vern and I exchanged profoundly confused glances, but continued walking. In the distance, we heard the hustle and bustle of a parade. People cheered and orchestral music blared, although it was only faint at our distance. We walked onto the nearest road, and continued up, away from the forest and the small park, between the houses. Each one seemed a mirror image of my neighbourhood, or something similar. Despite their similar suburban, white picket fence style, there was one main difference. Every front yard was littered with graves of chipped masonry amongst overgrown weeds. 

It reminded me of the home of my Sunday school teacher, Gary. He went all out every Halloween, taking home half the decoration section from Home Depot. But his devotion paled in comparison to the intensity of every single house down this street. Pumpkins infested the porches, or really any flat surface. I spotted them along steps, behind windows or even balancing on tree branches. The whole thing was bizarre, but I drank it up. For now, I was still under the fragile illusion that I was home and safe. Vern and I continued our walk up the deserted street, the distant ambience of the parade growing louder. Black shapes darted through the orange sky, and I quickly realised they were bats. With glowing green eyes, they hung from under rafters and shingles, and became worryingly more frequent the more we walked into town. We kept well away from them, afraid they might swoop at us at any moment. We moved from the  to the empty road, a gust blowing orange, red and yellow leaves in our wake. This gust didn't seem to stop, however, and the swirling mass of dry leaves followed us for the next block before ascending into the sky. Soon after, a thin fog set in, blanketing the next street we moved up.

“Hey, I think I recognise that house!” Vern said as he pointed at a two story Dutch Colonial style house. 

The white walls were covered in decorations, mainly skulls, ghosts and other frights made out of hay. Like with the rest, pumpkins were scattered all around and the yard was a miniature cemetery.

“That's Casey's house, isn't it?” Vern asked. 

It was. I was filled with a renewed hope and rushed up the stone path to his front door. First, I planned, I was going to ask him what the hell was going on, then chew him out for leaving me with Vern all night. But as soon as my knuckles rapped on the wooden door, I felt like death. An overwhelming sensation of dread began in the folds of my brain and was carried throughout my body, causing me to seize up. I staggered away, almost tripping over a pumpkin as I did. I couldn't tell what it was, or how I knew, but there was an unspeakable evil in front of me, separated only by some timber. I sheepishly ran back to the road, where Vern looked at me puzzled. 

“What was that about?” He asked in a condescending tone. 

“Forget about it,” I told him, “let's just try and find some help.”

One block later and the parade was on us. The brass band screamed, as did its followers. For now, I could only hear it, but knew from the volume that any corner we turned could lead us straight to it. The town was my town, certainly, but the layout had been changed just enough that I had become hopelessly lost in the town I spent my entire life in. The changes were few, just an extra street here or a few less houses there. There was also a corn maze on the grounds where my school usually stands. Other than that, and the sudden dedication to decorations, it was essentially the same. One more shortcut through a strange, empty slot where a house should have been and we had found the parade. 

Hundreds marched. All were dressed in old-fashioned Halloween costumes of varying eras, but nothing later than the 1930s. Most were comprised of bags, all sewn and painted into the visage of ghouls. People of all sizes were dressed in this way, and I could not see anyone with their faces showing. Homemade masks were the norm, most with just two large, dark eyeholes. Others were elaborate weaving of willow and hay, like in some ancient tradition. The music was a strange memory, one I swore I carried from childhood, and came from brass instruments all around. Some I'd never seen before, and were so large they took four people to carry and play. The melody was deafening at our proximity, and the only noise audible above it was the townsfolk's cheer. The whole spectacle was a wonder, one that seemed to hypnotise me. I could've stood and watched the unending parade go by for the rest of eternity. Vern was less enthralled. From the corner of my eye, I watched as we walked in the road and stood in front of a man. This man was tall, and wearing a white sheet, strapped to his form with numerous lengths of rope. His only two features were black, mournful ovals painted onto his mask. He walked past Vern, oblivious. Annoyed, Vern reached out and grabbed the man's shoulder. Then everything went silent. 

Every voice quieted, every instrument ceased. Slowly, every single person in the long procession turned and looked in the direction of Vern. Looking up at the tall, hooded man whose shoulder he was still grasping, Vern began to whimper. I made no attempt to come to his aid as the townsfolk closed in. In fact, I started stepping backwards. The crowd moved like grain spilling from a silo as they surrounded the kid. On either horizon of the wide street, more and more people appeared, walking in our direction. Shortly after I lost sight of Vern behind a wall of burlap and willow, he began to scream. It was drawn out and painful, and ceased just before the townsfolk began to cheer again. That's when I started to run. I turned and sprinted, heading back through the overgrown lot and into the street beyond. I cut through back yards, jumping over fences and dodging graves. I was now, paradoxically, trying to make my way back to the forest. While not real safety, it was safe at least from the evil I had stumbled into. The saturating orange glow seemed to pull out the colors from my surroundings, making the greens and reds more vibrant and bright. Yet as I ran, it all blended into one in my periphery. I managed to run by rows and rows of empty houses until I could run no more. I stopped, panting as my lungs desperately tried to catch my breath. 

I looked around. The first thing I noticed was the moon. Now no longer obscured behind a bank of black cloud, I could see it in full. It was no moon. Instead, an equally sized human skull rotated the night sky in its place, distant and yellow. I felt like it was staring at me. Then, I heard the roar. I looked up the street and saw dozens, then hundreds, of costumed townsfolk running towards me. They moved like a wave, and were so close I could see the seams of their paper machè masks. Exhausted, I turned and started to run again, making a desperate last stand to get to the treeline. The noise of their feet pounding the asphalt behind me, dulling as they hit the dirt, was deafening. I was almost in the forest now, and was too afraid to look behind me. I felt like I could make it, just a few more yards, to safety. I knew once I entered the woods, I couldn't be followed. Tears streamed down my cheeks, raised by my manic smile, as I took my first step past the treeline. Then a hand grabbed my collar. I stumbled backwards as whoever it belonged to yanked. I fell on my back, hard. I was surrounded. Standing around me were dozens of costumed figures, desperate to get a better look at me. They stared through painted on eyes. A child dressed as an owl, which was mainly just poorly woven black fabric and a mask with two bulbous, dinner plate sized white eyes and a small triangle for a beak, was the first to kneel. It watched me, puzzled. For a second, I thought I could avoid the same fate as Vern. Then, they all descended on me. 

I woke up surrounded by paramedics. By the time hypothermia set in, they told me, we were only thirty yards from the road. Thankfully, a passing driver had stopped to relieve himself in the bushes and saw us, curled up next to each other. My breathing was slow, as was my heartbeat. Vern wasn't as lucky. His body heat dropped to almost room temperature. Twelve hours we'd been out there, most of it unconscious, and he had been wearing nothing but spandex. He didn't stand a chance. I barely made it, and have been left with permanent nerve damage in my fingers. That's one of the reasons it's taken me so long to finally write out my account of that night. That, and the fogginess of it all. It was such a bizarre dream, and one born from my body shutting down. For a time, my last memory of that night was being loaded onto a stretcher and into the ambulance. I looked off into the forest and saw a familiar flicker of a candle behind a tree. For days, this detail destroyed my understanding of reality, until I realised it was likely just the headlight of the paramedic attending to Vern. This was 2008. I like to think I've moved past that terrible night, or at least until recently. See, at the tender age of twenty-nine, I was finally able to move out of my family home. A process of packing my childhood into boxes began, as well as searching the attic for anything I might like to take with me. It was at the very back of that cold and damp place that my mother retrieved a small, white box, just a few days ago. It was the things I had been wearing that Halloween night, packed neatly and given to my mother while I was still comatose. I opened it there and then, and found my blue-grey boiler suit folded inside. I lifted it out, and from the large pocket felt and old paper [map](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Ahtn3Fc2Ir).
