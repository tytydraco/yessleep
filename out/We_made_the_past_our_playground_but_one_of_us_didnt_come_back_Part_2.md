*CW: Self-harm*

It took us a while to return to the Valley after that. The memory of the blood on the bedroom floor kept us away. But after a week or so, unwilling to remain in mundane reality (and desperate to spend some time alone), we cautiously returned. The town had reset itself once again. The jewellery store window was stubbornly unsmashed and the sapphire pendant was back on display. Iris didn't bother stealing it a third time.

The initials she'd carved into the tree in the park had disappeared too.

“So much for forever,” she remarked, running her fingertips over the unbroken bark.

I put an arm around her. “Forever sounds pretty good to me.”

When you say that you'll love somebody forever, you're really saying it because it feels good in the present. You embrace each other on a day that feels like it's going to last an eternity, and you can easily imagine a lifetime of those days. Millions of shared moments. But ultimately, we have no way of knowing what the future will look like, or who will be in it. You can easily return to the past, apparently, but no-one is there any more. Perhaps there's no-one in the future either. Maybe all that really exists is the moment you're in right now.

We made love right there in the park. There was nobody to see us, or stop us.

“I wanna break something,” Iris announced, as we lay together on the grass. She dressed, stole a baseball bat from a sporting goods store, and began to smash every single window she could see. The harsh scream of breaking glass echoed through the silent streets. I watched from a distance, smiling, wanting to stop her. When she was finally satisfied, she sprinted over to me, her wolf eyes alert and alive. She had shallow cuts all over her hands and face.

“Feels so fucking good,” she hissed. “God, I love it here.”

We started visiting the Valley more and more after that. We never went back to the bedroom with the blood on the floor. But it felt like we explored every other inch of the town. We poked around dozens of houses, snooped around every store. We made love in countless places, growing bolder and bolder over time. The middle of streets. The main exhibit of the art museum. The school gym, the football field, the dairy aisle of the local supermarket.

Iris's appetite for destruction continued to grow. She left broken windows in her wake like a trail of glass breadcrumbs. She smashed entire houses to pieces. She would often cry. I wasn't brave enough to broach the subject with her. I'll never stop regretting that.

We tried to bring more things back with us, but it never worked. They would all just vanish. Even stolen clothes that we were wearing would disappear right off our bodies. Only the things that we took with us could come back through the window. After a while, we stopped trying.

One time, we took our bikes with us. Squeezing them through the window and getting them down to the ground was more trouble than it was worth. We rode for miles out of town, but there was nothing there. Just more empty world. It was like loading up a multiplayer video game by yourself. Wandering these huge spaces that should have been full of sound and action, but were just inert backdrops without the actors to create those scenes.

I visited my own house once, but it was awful. There was nobody there, of course, but it was clear from the layout that my dad had been alive at that point in time. My room had a baby's crib in it. Being in there felt like someone was standing right over my shoulder. I had a powerful mental image of me as a baby, looking up out of my crib and seeing me as a seventeen-year old, staring down at myself. It was so vivid that I wondered if it was a memory just now resurfacing. An infinite cycle of terrified eye contact. I ran out of the house and never went back.

In the present, things were bad with my mom. It was hard to keep track of time in the Valley, so I often ended up returning home in the early hours of the morning. None of her texts or phone calls ever went through, and she assumed I was turning off my phone to deliberately avoid her. And when she demanded to know where I'd been, I couldn't tell her. What was I supposed to say?

My grades at school slipped. I didn't really care. I just wanted to be with the girl I loved.

One day, Iris didn't show up at school. The teachers hadn't heard from her, and my texts didn't go through to her phone. There was only one place she could have gone. But she'd never been there without me, at least not to my knowledge. And I'd certainly never been there without her. The thought of walking those silent streets alone gave me shivers.

Of course, I did it anyway.

After the endless school day finally ended, I rode my bike to Somerville Street, hid it behind the house, entered through the back door we had left unlocked, and climbed the stairs to the second floor. I couldn't stop thinking about that pool of blood. It had looked so thick and warm, like spilled soup, steam rising from it as it cooled in the cold winter air.

I climbed through the diamond-shaped window. It felt like my head slowly rotated a hundred and eighty degrees. And then I emerged, blinking, into the flat light of a February afternoon. I slid down the ladder and set off for the center of town. If Iris was in the Valley as I suspected, I hoped to find some hint of her whereabouts there.

The utter silence and stillness of the past town were deeply unsettling without her chatting away beside me. The entire world seemed to be holding its breath. Any second now, there would be a scream. A thousand unmoving figures watched me as I walked, empty eyes staring from every window, from around every corner. I could feel the physical weight of their gaze on me. I could almost hear their running feet, see their reaching hands in the corners of my eyes. It had never been safe here. They'd just been waiting for me to be alone, all this time.

I pushed these paranoid thoughts out of my mind and kept moving. I had to find her.

It wasn't hard, once I reached town. I just followed the broken windows. Hundreds of them.

And I followed the blood.

I walked faster and faster. I started to run.

“HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY”, screamed every store that I passed. Pink balloons twisted noisily in the stale breeze. The blind black eyes of teddy bears watched me rush by, shoes crunching on shards of shattered glass.

I found her on the floor of a record store. The windows were all broken, and the albums had been swept from the shelves and strewn about the floor. All of the covers were blurred smears. Whatever force had created this place couldn't reproduce fine print or detailed images. I didn't know why. It didn't matter.

There was blood everywhere.

“Iris,” I said quietly, crouching beside her, touching her cheek. Her eyes slowly fell open, first one and then the other. She looked like a broken doll.

“Oh,” she said, smiling, blinking, as if she'd just woken up from a pleasant Sunday afternoon nap. “Hey, beautiful boy.”

“You're bleeding.” Her forearms were covered in fresh cuts. I'd seen the dense ladder of scar tissue on her arms and thighs many times before, of course. There wasn't anywhere on her body that I wasn't familiar with. But I'd never seen fresh ones. I'd hoped that she wouldn't need to do that any more, now that she had me.

Thinking back, I suppose I only knew her for a few months.

“Yeah,” she said, sheepishly. “I was hoping you wouldn't find me like this.”

“Come on,” I urged. I didn't care what she'd done. I just wanted to make sure she was okay. “We need to get back to the house, call an ambulance.”

“No.” She shook her head, slowly. She seemed dazed, still half-asleep. “I'm actually going to stay. I can't go home any more.” She tried to smile; failed miserably. The black pinpricks of her eyes had lost their sharp edge. “I'm going to stay here forever.”

“We can't stay, sweetie.” I was fighting to keep the rising panic out of my voice. There was blood everywhere. Where was it all coming from? What had she done to herself? “We don't have anything over here. There's no medical supplies or food or, like... social media. We need to get back, don't we?”

I didn't know what I was saying any more.

“Nah,” she said simply. “I love you, Joe, but fuck off.”

She closed her eyes again, and immediately dozed off. I called her name, shook her shoulders, even slapped her cheek, but she didn't stir. I crouched down, slid my arms under her shoulders and knees, and picked her up.

Carrying a girl is a lot harder than movies and TV make it look. Maybe it's because the guys carrying girls out of burning buildings in those movies are jacked, and I'm just a skinny teenager. But within seconds, my arms were burning with the strain.

It took a long time to get back to Somerville Street. I had to stop frequently, put her down, rest my arms. I tried to wake her every time. I couldn't. Her face was very pale. There was so much blood. Her blue hair was fading again, brown roots coming through. She'd need to dye it again soon.

There was so much blood.

I don't know how I hauled her up the ladder onto the house's gable. It's all a blur when I think back on it. They say mothers get the strength to lift cars if their baby is trapped underneath. It was probably something like that.

As I dragged her towards the diamond-shaped window, she started to shake. I let out a breath I'd been holding in for as long as I could remember. She was moving again. She was waking up. We were going to go through the window, and I'd lay her on the bed where she'd taken my virginity, and I'd call an ambulance, and it would arrive quickly because we were in a quiet part of town, and everything would be okay, everything would be okay, everything would be just like it was before, and we'd start making plans to move, to another town, far away from my mom and her dad, and we'd get jobs in fast food or something, make enough money to live on, and she'd dye her hair again, and we'd have good days and bad days.

We'd have years and years of days like that, and everything would be okay because we'd be together.

The closer we got to the window, the more her body trembled. I could barely hold on to her. I dragged her another step. Then another. We were so close now. We were almost there.

Her body vibrated violently.

“Hold on-” I started to say, and then she vanished, right out of my arms. Her empty, blood-spattered clothes fell onto the tiles like a pile of laundry.

If I'm being honest with myself, here and now, as I write this all down, I had noticed she was dead several minutes earlier, as we'd been turning the corner onto Somerville. I just hadn't allowed myself to acknowledge it at the time. All I'd been thinking about was getting back to the present, to the real world, to a hospital where I'd spend a sleepless night in a waiting room until they told me that she was going to be okay, and that the cuts to her wrists I'd been refusing to look at hadn't been as deep as they looked.

With calm and precise movements I climbed back through the diamond window and into the pitch-black present, like it was a dance I'd rehearsed. I waited for my phone to reconnect to the network and dialed 911. When the operator picked up, I hung up without saying anything.

I turned back to the window and started to climb through. I needed to go and look for her. The sapphire necklace had respawned back at the shop after it had disappeared. Maybe Iris had too. Maybe she was at her house, or at the little park. Unbroken, just like all the windows. She'd be carving our initials into a tree, pulling items out of a picnic basket, smiling at me with that little gap in her front teeth, picking out some outlandish place for us to make love. Maybe lying on the grass, next to the mausoleum. Like in the song. She really liked that kind of thing.

I couldn't wait to see her again.

On the other side of the pitch black window, it was a pitch black night.

I panicked, lost my balance, and fell head-first into the front garden.

That's where the police found me. They took me to the hospital, where I was treated for a broken shoulder. They had a lot of questions. They wanted to know where Iris was. I don't remember what I told them at the time. I was in a lot of pain, and my shoulder hurt too.

I saw her dad for the first and last time. He was standing outside my hospital room while the police spoke to me. He looked terrified. He left town a few days later. I don't know where he went.

“I love you, Joe,” she'd said, “but fuck off.”

I don't know if she intended those to be her last words, but they fit her well. If I imagine a gravestone for her, I imagine those words carved into it. I imagine visiting it often, leaving flowers before it, watching those final words grow faint as the years go by.

But of course, there is no grave. Officially, she's considered a runaway. A ridiculous idea, I know. They found me literally covered in her blood. At first, it was obvious they thought I'd killed her. I told them that she'd killed herself, that I'd found her body, that she should be in the house on Somerville Street. They didn't find her, of course. They didn't find anything. And when I went back there myself, as soon as I was able to, the diamond-shaped window was no longer a portal into the past. It was just an oddly-shaped window.

They're finally tearing the house down now, after all this. That's what I heard, anyway.

The cops didn't have enough evidence to charge me with her murder, and there was no body anyway. Based on her dad skipping town days later and her own violent history, they assumed there had been a domestic dispute that had led to her hurting herself and then running away. They put out a half-hearted missing persons report. And that was that.

“I'm so sorry, honey,” my mom said when I got home from the hospital, holding me tightly. Her voice was choked with emotion, but I could see the corners of her mouth turned up in a slight smile. When I went back to school a few days later, a missing-persons poster had been taped to my desk. A blurry photo of my dead girlfriend, taken before she'd started dying her hair, stared out of it. The other students seemed disappointed in my lack of reaction to it.

She'd have hated that photo.

And that's it. It's been a week, and I don't really know what to do with myself. Mostly, I hate myself. I spend a lot of time doing that. Entire days and nights. Especially the nights. Sleep cannot reach me through the thick fog of guilt that has enveloped my mind.

I should have paid more attention to the things Iris was saying to me. I should have understood her pain, engaged with it. Maybe it wouldn't have changed anything. There's no way of knowing now. But I wish I had tried.

I said I loved her, but what I loved were the good times we were having together.

Whoever is still reading this, please, pay attention to the people you claim to love. Listen to what they are telling you. Really listen. Don't push it back, because tonight is pizza and movies and sex and smiles, and tomorrow would be a much better time to broach such a difficult subject. There might never be a tomorrow.

And if, somehow, you find a window that goes into the past, a past with nobody in it, leave it alone. It was left behind for a good reason. The past is an empty shell. It is not a place to linger. It is not a place to escape to. And the past is not your playground.
