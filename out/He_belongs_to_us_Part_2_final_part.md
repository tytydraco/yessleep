She started to cry again, big tears staining her red cheeks. Her breaths coming in short bursts. That’s when the large man stepped forward.

“I’m sorry for the fear we caused you, but that.. precious little boy is my grandson. My daughter carried and nursed that baby, all by herself, and is a great Mama. We had our neighbor, who I believe is Mrs. Rosino to you, watch him a few times when everyone at the house was working, and she seemed like a trustworthy lady. But two months ago, my daughter went to pick him up after her shift and they were gone. Her, her husband, and Jonah. The police couldn’t help us, so we hired a PI. He tracked them all to here, I know we should have called the police here too.. but.. we were desperate. We didn’t want to cause you harm, but we thought you were in on it too. We just want our baby boy back..”, he nodded down at the baby in my hands. 

Jonah.

He was full on crying by this point, but I wasn’t letting him go yet.

I turned to the officer.

“Is this true?”, I asked, my voice cracking on the last word.

He nodded once, said they didn’t run when they walked in and handed them a folder of evidence they had gathered to support their claims. He said they still needed to run a DNA test to be sure, but they were waiting to talk to the Rosino’s first. To get their side of the story.

But I kept thinking to myself… where were they? They said they were coming straight home, they should have been here an hour ago.

The officer held his hands out to me again.

“I’m just taking him to get checked out by medics, we only want to make sure he’s okay. You can walk over with me.”

I took a deep inhale, nodded, and passed the fussing baby.. maybe Jonah.. over to the officer.

When we walked outside, my eyes widened at the mass amount of people outside the house. Police cars, an ambulance, a big crew of men and women on motorcycles, and my parents. My parents who were pushing past people to get to me.

Mom got to me first, crying and reaching towards me.

“My sweet girl! My darling girl! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Is the baby okay? Oh my god!”, she wailed as she held me tight to her chest and began to sob.

My dad wrapped us both in a hug, the stoic man fighting the tears in his eyes.

“She’s okay, Liz. She’s right here. We are together, we are all alright,” he sighed into my hair.

I squeezed them both before pulling back.

“Do you guys know the Rosino’s? Had you met them before you dropped me off tonight?”, I asked.

My parents looked at each other, then back at me with a contemplative expression.

“We don’t know them personally, no. Friend of a friend, mostly. They didn’t move here too long ago, I think maybe a month and a half, at most. But they joined Joe’s church group, brought that baby to the church daycare every week… Are they hurt? Are they inside? I should go see if they need anything.”, my dad said. Then stepped past me to go inside the house.

With my mom still holding on to me, I missed telling him they weren’t there. He would figure that out soon enough.

I glanced towards the group of men and women on motorcycles. I saw the older man moving his hands a lot while talking, and the teenage girl was staring at me. Her eyes almost glowing in the moonlight.

The officer from earlier appeared behind my mom, I read his badge as Officer Turner. He cleared his throat, which made my mom finally release me.

“The baby is okay, just hungry. One of the medics is giving him some formula in the meantime. Could I ask you a few more questions?”, he asked, pulling out a notepad from his pocket.

My mom gripped my hand.

“You don’t think my daughter had anything to do with this, correct? I don’t know what all occurred tonight, but I can assure you she hasn’t done anything wrong.”, she said, stepping towards Officer Turner.

He shook his head.

“No ma’am, we don’t think she’s involved. Just have some questions to do with her as a witness.”

“It’s okay, Mom. I’m okay,” I say, patting her arm. “I just need a minute, I’ll find you as soon as I’m done.”

Officer Turner and I step away from the chaos. As we are walking towards a quieter area, I see the teenage girl from the house by the ambulance. She is standing close to the medics, not encroaching, but close. Like she’s never letting the baby out of her sight again.

“Have you done the DNA test yet?”, I ask him.

“Oh, no. We won’t do that out here. They will do one at the hospital, to be sure..”, he flips through the pages of his notepad. He opens his mouth to speak again, but I cut him off.

“Have you gotten hold of the Rosino’s?”, I quickly say. The story I heard inside was tragic, but I wasn’t sure if I fully believed it at first. As time goes on, with the Rosino’s still not here, I’m starting to question my belief.

“No, we haven’t. We tried calling, and both phone numbers we have go straight to a generic voicemail. We tried looking up the numbers, but they were both prepaid phones. Did they mention where they were going tonight?”, he asked, glancing over at the ambulance.

“Um..”, I put both hands on my head, as if that will help me remember what already feels like a lifetime ago.

Think.. think.. Mr. Rosino did say something, but not to me, to his wife. As they were grabbing their keys, he said.. What did he say…

“A meeting..”, I whispered, half a question and half a statement.

“A meeting?”, Detective Turner asked, squinting at me, as if waiting for me to continue.

I look around, hoping for something to jog my memory.

“He.. He said they couldn’t miss this group meeting just because she’s grown attached. I don’t know what that means, but that’s what he said. I don’t think he meant for me to hear it, he was saying it as he was closing the front door..”, I inhaled deeply.

What would she be attached to?

“Hey! HEY! I need an officer over here!”

It was my dad’s voice.

He was coming out of their house, waving papers around frantically, a dishcloth separating his hand from the papers.

“I need someone in charge, NOW!”, his voice rang out over the chaos.

Suddenly everyone was silent, curious eyes looked at my dad. The teenage girl from the house looked right at me, a quizzical expression dancing in her eyes.

I saw an officer walk over to my dad and take the papers out of his hand. Once he started reading them, his expression turned to tightness. Fear. He looked at my dad and asked him something, my dad gestured over his shoulder to the house and they started to head inside.

Officer Turner was watching as well.

“Wait here, please”, he said, as he headed towards the house himself.

I stared after him, and took a deep inhale. I’ll admit, I don’t know the Rosino’s well. But could they have taken a baby, why would they have not come home? Why aren’t they here, defending themselves?

A few minutes later, my dad and Officer Turner walked outside. Both sharing a grim expression. They stopped to speak to another officer briefly, and my dad walked over to my mom. I saw him say something to her, and her expression was something I’ll never forget. Her hand went over her mouth, her eyes widened, and she began to shake.

Shaking from fear.

Officer Turner walked over to me, and for the first time that night, removed his hat.

My arms were crossed, and I waited for him to speak.

“We didn’t see your dad walk into the home, but he said he went in to see if the Rosino’s were anywhere in the house. He saw a folder, sticking out of a hutch in the kitchen. He said curiosity got the best of him, so he used a dish towel to grab it out to give to us when he dropped it. The pages that fell out…”, he shook his head.

“What did they say?”, I asked, almost a whisper. I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.

“Well.. for starters, their last name isn’t Rosino. Second.. not only is the baby not theirs, but they were getting ready to sell him.”, he said, looking me directly in the eye.

“Sell him?”, I stammered, “Sell him where? To who? Why would they sell him?”

“We are verifying the documents right now, but if they are true, he was going to be sold for.. to..”, he rubbed the back of his head. It seemed like he was contemplating what he was going to say to me.

“Just tell me, I deserve to know after tonight”, I said firmly. I had a feeling I would never be the same after what came next out of his mouth.

“Alright. There’s a black market ring, of very rich and powerful people, who buy humans of all sizes for.. consumption.”, his mouth turned grim, but he was still looking me in the eye.

“Consumption?”, I asked, “What do you mean-“

My stomach dropped.

Oh god.

Oh no.

I felt my dinner from hours ago come up, and I vomited in the dry grass to my left. Tears streaked down my face, and I was suddenly gasping for air. My parents came running over, and my mom held my hair back. Once everything was out of me, I wiped my mouth on my sleeve and turned back to Officer Turner. Shaking violently against my mom.

“It seems maybe she, the wife, changed her mind. She may have wanted to keep the baby for herself, but the husband was intending on going through with the deal.. We believe that’s what their meeting could have been about tonight. This house is also a rental, we got in contact with the owner and he admits he didn’t run a full background check, just a credit check.”, Officer Turner offered me a sad facial expression.

“I just.. I don’t understand. He’s just a baby. Why would anyone want to.. What kind of person would.. ”, I said between tears. If my mom wasn’t holding me up, my legs would have given out already.

Officer Turner nodded sympathetically, and what he said next sent chills down my spine.

“You may have thought the monsters tonight were the ones banging on the door, but the real monsters had already been in the house with you.”

I think back to the few moments I had shared with the couple, they seemed.. nice. Normal. I always thought monsters were under my bed, hiding in the shadows, but they’re not. They’re hidden in plain sight. They’re hiring you to babysit.

“The couple is in the wind, we put out alerts for their descriptions and their car already. But they’re gone. We are sending a team out to analyze the property right now, and we are going to get the baby to the hospital for that DNA test. The potential family will follow.”, he put his notepad away, and took a step backwards.

“You’re taking him again? But you said he isn’t the Rosino- or whoever they are, you said he wasn’t their baby. Can’t you give him back to her?”, I asked, pointing at the teenage girl. She was still at the ambulance, looking in.

“We have to perform a DNA test first, then he will go into foster care until the test comes back, then we will move forward depending on the results. I’m sorry.”, Officer Turned said.

“Can I go with him to the hospital?”, I asked, “He knows me more than anyone here, I just want to comfort him.”

“I’ll go with her too,” my dad chimed in, “We just want him safe. Liz, could you follow in the car?”

My mom nodded, she was still holding on to me.

Officer Turner sighed heavily, rubbing his temples.

“I would normally say no, but given the circumstances, we will make an exception.”, Officer Turner waved us towards the ambulance. Luckily there was room in the back for me and my dad if we squeezed, the paramedic stepped aside to speak with Officer Turner.

Once they stepped away, I saw the teenage girl. Standing alone, looking at me with pain-filled eyes.

I looked right at her.

“Don’t worry, I will make sure he’s okay. I promise.”, I said to her, looking her directly into her almost white eyes.

“Thank you.”, she said, a single tear fell down her face.

The paramedics closed up the back of the ambulance and we started our journey to the hospital. Followed by several police cars. 

The teenage girl didn’t move from her spot as she watched us drive out of sight, her dad came over and hugged her tightly, but she kept her eyes on the ambulance.

I looked down at the baby, he was fully awake now, and happily babbling while my dad talked to the paramedic. 

I realized for the first time tonight, that this is the first time I’m seeing him in any light at all.

The baby turned to me, and his eyes flared in recognition.

His eyes, so bright blue, they were almost white.

Jonah.
