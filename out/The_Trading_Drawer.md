So the end had come. A hundred bucks and a quarter, my cut of the tips for Thursday night. Not even close to what I needed to pay rent and get some food - actual food, not pretzels and chips - for Sam, my brother.

His care cost a lot. He needed to be watched at all times. Mrs. George from the lower apartment would have done it for free but she needed to survive too. Taking care of kids in the building, and Sam, was her income. 

“Need an advance, Charlie?” Jack, owner of The Cat and Cathedral, offered.

I smiled. “You've already advanced me a month.” I sighed and rested my chin on the bar. “It's just not enough these days. I can't keep up. Can you?”

He shrugged. “It's been slow. Times are tough all around.”

“Can you remember a time when they weren't? I asked.

“Early 90s maybe?”

“So, last century,” I observed.

He chuckled. “Guess so. Wanna drink?”

“Yes.”

He poured out two pints. Jack didn't know I had little taste for beer. I drank it for the calories. Without these nightly freebies, I'd waste away. 

“Cheers.”

We drank a few. It tasted like coppery piss, but the alcohol dulled the anxiety or at least delayed it a little. Sober me could deal with the crushing responsibilities of life later.

He indulged my prolonged loitering till just after three. 

“I'm off, Charlie,” he said.

“Mind if I stick around for one more? I can lock up.” Jack caught my straying glance toward the old office under the stairs. 

His eyes fixed on the locked door. By his order, no one was allowed in there. Only me and one other bartender had been told what it contained. And the other bartender - Tyler - was dead.

“You stay out of there,” Jack said.

“What? I know.”

“It's only trouble. Tyler-”

“Died from an overdose, Jack.”

“But if he hadn't messed with the drawer,” Jack said, still watching the forbidden door, his expression pained, “he never would have-”

“I don't buy that, Jack, which is why I would never bother putting anything in there. There'd be no point. I stopped believing in magic at ten.”

He nodded and looked a bit teary eyed. I wondered if I'd been too blunt. Tired and stressed 24/7, I rarely made good company. Jack had always been a friend.

“I won't go in there,” I said. “I promise. Now go home. Shannon's gotta be wondering where you are, and tell her to come by every once in a while. I haven't seen her in years.”

Jack smiled at the mention of his wife. “She's probably been asleep since nine.” He said one more goodbye, spared another uneasy check of the old office door before reluctantly leaving.

Like most days, this would be my only time alone. I loved Sam. He waa my heart and my world. But the energy of my youth had been spent on him. 

Our parents were old when they had us, and not healthy. They died within a year of one another. I was nineteen. Sam was twelve. Jack gave me a job and more than a decade flew by.

I helped myself to the house red, and ate a bag of chips in a dark booth. Mrs. George had texted that Sam had fallen asleep around eight. He'd be up by six am again. I had three hours. Sleep didn't call because it never did.

“I'm going to die if this goes on,” I said to the bar, and thought of the drawer in the old office. The Cat and Cathedral had the honour of being one of the oldest piles of bricks and mortar in Bridal Veil Lake. It predated the War of 1812. 

And had once served as an apothecary and barbershop. Dark iron brackets for lanterns were still embedded in the beams. The fireplace was original too, though rarely lit, except on Christmas Eve for the lonely, the lost.

Despite the heat of a mid September night, I wished to build a fire so I could smell the ashes, and think of better days. Tips were plentiful around the holidays. Sam and I ate well and the rent would be paid.

“I don't know if I can make it to Christmas,” I said. “I'm tired. God, I am tired.” While I cried, I poured out more wine and began to really feel the alcohol seize control. 

With so little food in my stomach, the beer alone had pushed me beyond a buzz. Wine gently guided me the resy of the way to totally fucked.

“Shit,” I said. “I'm drunk.” Then I laughed because it didn't matter. Drunk. Sober. Sleep deprived. I'd been so long past exhausted, it couldn't get worse. You can't kill what's dead.

“Oh, god, please help me.”

I thought he answered with the soft scraping of wood on wood. The noise came from the old office, and I could have convinced myself I'd imagined it if I weren't so desperate for something to go my way.

“Don’t mess with the old office,” Jack told Tyler and I years ago. I think I was twenty-two. Tyler and I had gone in there out of curiosity. The small room didn't hold much but a broken chair, and a drawer in the wall. Jack caught us as Tyler opened the drawer.

“Close that shit up!” Jack had yelled, and I'd never seen him so mad before. I didn't think he could get mad. He slammed shut the wide, shallow drawer, and physically dragged us from the room by our aprons.

Last call was hours ago that night. I remember a winter storm discouraged the trek home. Jack's hands were shaking as he struggled with an old key in the ancient lock of the office door.

“What’s the matter?” I asked.

“What’s the deal with that drawer?” Tyler ventured. “It's weird.”

Jack said nothing as he searched behind the bar for something strong. He came out with vodka and poured himself a shot. And then another. When he finally started to settle, he spoke quickly. 

“Never go in there. Don't open that drawer, and for the love of fucking Christ almighty, don't you dare put anything in there.” He stared hard at Tyler as if he knew the far younger man could only be tempted by a warning.

“The drawer goes into the wall,” I said, “but… there's only the outer lounge on the other side.” I thought of the low ceilings in what seemed like an annex to the main room, and recalled the strange cylindrical stonework tucked into the left corner. It looked like an old timey bread oven without an opening. I figured that's what it'd been, and that it'd been filled in at some point. “The drawer goes into that bulge in the annex. That's weird.”

“It's just big enough for a person to stand in,” Tyler said, “uncomfortably.”

“I don't know about any of that,” Jack said, rubbing the back of his hand across his mouth. “But there's something in there, and it isn't good.”

Tyler laughed. 

Jack looked embarrassed. 

“What are you saying, Jack?” I asked.

He glared at Tyler. “I won't talk about it anymore except to say whatever goes in that drawer comes back out times three.”

Obviously, we had no idea what he meant, and it took some persuasion and another shot to get an explanation. 

“So,” Tyler said, more interested, but no less skeptical, “If I put a loonie in there, when I open the drawer, there'll be three loonies?”

It felt like a set-up for more ridicule. Jack didn't take the bait. “You can't just put money in there. Part of you goes with it. It comes back at you three times as hard.” He leveled a finger at us both. “Promise me you'll stay out of there. Right now. Or you can pound sand.”

“Whoa, whoa, for real?” Tyler asked, grinning like a child. “You're gonna fire us? Sounds like a wrongful dismissal lawsuit. Should we get a lawyer?”

“I promise, Jack.” It was important to him, so it was important to me. “So does Tyler.”

“I do?”

I dug my fingernails into his forearm. “Ouch. Fuck,” he expressed calmly. “Fine. I promise not to play with your magic drawers.” 

Jack studied our faces before nodding and abruptly leaving for the night.

“That guy's fucked,” Tyler said.

“That guy,” I said, “is my friend.”

“Okay, okay,” Tyler said. “You heading out?”

“Yes,” I said, “and so are you?”

He grinned again. “Oh come on, I've got to check this shit out. It's a magic drawer? Did you see his face? Dude is scared shitless of it. I can't not check it out. I. Can't.”

“You promised him.”

“Under the duress of your finger knives.”

He had a point there. I didn't believe in superstitious bullshit. Plus, I didn't see a way into the old office. Jack had the key. Tyler lacked a brain and had zero skills outside of slinging pints and flirting with customers.

“Goodnight,” I told him for the last time. He died from a combination of drugs and exposure that night. On the way home, he passed out in a snowbank and froze to death. 

Jack found the old office and the drawer open. That was enough evidence for him. The “trading drawer” he called it, and it had killed Tyler, all of twenty-four. 

I'd like to say I felt sad about Tyler's death. But I didn't feel much at all. Deep in my own troubles, I had no energy to spare on fools. 

Jack took it much harder. He vowed to seal that room, and break the drawer. But he never did. He couldn't bring himself to go inside, and never stayed long near the old office door even. 

If he could have sold the bar or closed it, I think he would have. Instead, he kept his head down and drank more. And didn't talk about the drawer or Tyler except for this night, this very night I thought about it and nothing else.

I needed money. I had a hundred bucks and a quarter. Three hundred and seventy five cents would be much better. My promise to Jack and what I was about to do stung through the fatigue and withdrew guilt usually reserved for Sam. 

I could never do enough for my brother. I was failing him. Jack would be upset, but with a full stomach and a place to live. I owed it to Sam to try every damn thing to help us survive and more.

None of these thoughts of promises and loyalty mattered, however, because the old office would be locked. Jack had the only known key, and he either had it with him or had hidden it away a long time ago. 

Before my drunken brain could catch up, I found myself in front of the solid wood door with my hand over the brass knob. Only a slight effort worked the mechanism. 

The door swung open noiselessly, and the lack of sound seemed to mute everything but the pulse of blood in my ears.

The drawer across the room stood open from the wall. I had no doubt the subtle, gentle scraping I'd heard before had been its invitation. 

I don't believe it. I don't.

But I need it to work. I'm desperate.

Please don't kill me. Sam needs me alive.

I put all the money into the worn bottom of the drawer. I'm not sure what I expected but nothing happened. 

I closed it up, and waited. 

“Please,” I whispered. “Please.” It was a prayer though I don't believe in god. 

In the quiet of the cavity within the sealed wall, something whispered back. I couldn't hear much and what I could make out didn't sound like English. It didn't sound nice either.

The drawer shuddered as if heavy hands gripped it from the other side. Scratching noises were rapid and couldn't be denied. 

What was given was taken. 

When the scratches ended, the drawer shuddered once again before smoothly presenting the very thing I desired and feared: three-hundred dollars and seventy five cents.

Instead of the astonishment and fear you might expect someone to have when they see the vaguely sinister and utterly impossible occur, I experienced more of a “It's about damn time” moment.

It was about damn time Sam and I caught a break. 

It was about damn time the universe shed its casual indifference toward us.

And it was about damn time I decided to stop settling for the first offer and the meager existence only scraps could provide.

I shoved the drawer back in. 

Whispered chittering sounded like stifled laughter. The drawer returned, full of cash. Too drunk to do math, I dragged enough stacks onto the floor until I could do it all again. 

Each “trade” seemed to increase the elation of whatever thing existed in the wall. I don't know how much time went by - maybe an hour - but its laughter bellowed raucously as the money piled up around my knees. 

The sun would rise soon. I needed to get home to Sam. Or I could keep doing this and make an escape around nine when Jack would inevitably start thinking about coming in to ready the bar for lunch. A few more hours of “trading” and I'd never have to work or worry again.

So I kept going. More. More. More. How could I carry so much money home?. It didn't matter. I'd figure out a way. I always did. Sam and I could never have enough. 

With the fortune I had made, we'd be fine for groceries and a place to live. But what about his education? His protection? I wouldn't be around forever. What would become of Sam if I died? 

More. More. The drawer and I became rhythmic in our back and forth. More. 

And what about the zillion other threats that never crossed my wearied mind? I'm no genius. I only knew people with money never seemed to have problems they couldn't pay away. 

More.

I felt sick as the alcohol wore off and the inevitable hangover took hold. Sweat coated my body. My clothes were soaked through. I couldn't stop. I would never stop. For Sam.

There were evil things in the world. Evil people. Monsters. They'd hurt Sam for fun if they could. I'd read a story about a mentally ill man staked out on a hardwood floor and tortured for months - burned and made to eat feces - by drug addicts. They killed him and were caught tossing his cut up body in the gorge. 

It could so easily be Sam.

Back and forth and sweep the cash above the lip of the drawer. Jack could be in any second.

But there were horrors beyond imagination too. Darkness beyond human comprehension that nevertheless interacted and opposed human beings. It had to be true. One existed within the wall, laughing, always laughing every time I made another trade.

If one lived inside the wall, there could be others. There were likely others, and where were they? Not in the open, no, but in the dark, the shadows in the corners of the room. 

When I risked a glance, an indistinct shape, black as oil and huge, shifted enough to reveal two horns the same as a bull's but larger. 

I pulled the drawer out and finally hesitated to push it back in. 

What was this monster? What did it want? How could I kill it and others like it?

I'd need more money to know, to pay people to research and study and make new weapons or find holy relics. Yes, I decided, more money could solve even this demon.

I screamed against my growing apprehension and continued trading. Peals of laughter shattered my already fragile resolve and extracted a stream of tears that blurred my vision.

What happened next, I'm not entirely sure. Footsteps came from behind, shuffling through the mounds of bills. Screams and curses reached my ears but not my mind. 

It could have been the strange language of the entity pushing the drawer or another obfuscated monster, more daring than the rest, coming to end the seemingly endless task I had made for myself.

I collapsed under the impact of something heavy, crashing against the back of my neck. I felt awake. I could hear the laughter echoing, but I couldn't see. I had blacked out, I thought, until I saw one of those things stir just a little to prove it was there. Then they all did. Hundreds of them had collected on the ceiling and everywhere the light did not go.

But I knew. I was right. There were monsters everywhere and they hated me and Sam and every bit of life.

I needed more. 

I couldn't move. 

“Charlie! Charlie!” 

Another impact made a searing pain in my cheek.

“Charlie!” 

Whack!

Where was I? 

Pinpoints of light grew like the end of a train tunnel. I could see again. But I couldn't move.

He'd tied me to a chair with an apron. 

“Charlie!” Jack shouted. We were in the lounge. I tasted blood. My nose hurt and my head. 

“Jack? What are you-” I tried to wiggle against the apron strings. “What time is it? Sam. I have to get home.”

Jack stared and sucked on a cigarette, casually releasing plumes of smoke from his nostrils. He looked like a man on the cusp of some decision. “Why didn't you listen, Charlie? Why does no one listen?”

The hours spent in the old office, the money, felt like a nightmare. I would have liked to dismiss it as such but the currency behind Jack, organized neatly, confirmed the reality and something more. Something wrong. 

“Jack? Untie me.”

“It's tough times, Charlie,” he apologized. “Tougher than you know. Shannon-”

“Would kick your ass right now,” I seethed. The apron strings were tight. I had to get away.

“Shannon hasn't been well,” Jack continued. “That’s why she stopped coming around. I think you can guess how she got that way. It's crazy how alike you two are. You could be her daughter. My daughter. Hell, I wish you were.” He shook his head to rid himself of a pained expression.

“Shannon used the drawer,” I said, only to get him to keep talking while I strained. 

“She did,” he confirmed. “Used it the same way you did. Neither of us understood what the hell it was until… too late. You get back everything you put in. Three-fold. Every dollar. Every feeling. All the anxiety and worry attached to the false hope in that fucking thing in there.” He dropped his cigarette into a coffee cup, and wiped his hands on his shirt. “And now you'll never be the same.”

“Let me go, Jack,” I said. “I'm sorry I used the drawer but whatever you're thinking-”

His face scrunched up. “Let you go? I'm not keeping you here. You are.”

“What?” I didn't understand. “My hands are tied. You-”

Jack reached for the back of the chair and like a magician swept the apron away. I felt the loose strings glide against my skin. Yet my body still felt bound.

“What? What the hell? Why? What the fuck-”

“All of your exhaustion,” Jack said, “returned three-fold.” He hadn't tied me up. I'd been put into a chair with an apron slung over the back. I was weak, too weak to hold my body weight. 

“Oh, shit.”

“It's worse than you think,” Jack said. “Your mind is shot. Shannon's was. Is.”

“Oh god. Oh god.”

“I'm amazed you can talk. Shannon only started talking again last year. A little.” He rubbed his shoulder. “But then she did a bit afterwards… too, I guess.” 

His words were like a spell. My tongue became heavy, clumsy. “J…eck…” 

Jack nodded. “It's going to get worse. The good news is… I'll take care of you…”

“S…em…”

“Your brother… I'm sorry, Charlie. There's nothing I can do for him. You gave your anxiety over Sam, and it took it how many times? How many times did you use the drawer?”

Hundreds for sure.

“Unfortunately,” he said, trying to be gentle, “the thing in there deals with its concerns quite differently than you or I. Sam is… there's no hope. It'll only be a matter of time.”

I cried but could manage nothing more. Jack packed up the cash into hockey bags that seemed reserved for the opportunity. He'd done this before, maybe after Shannon. And what the hell had gone on with Tyler?

I never got the chance to ask. He carried me to his truck, and drove me to his place. 

That's where I am. That's where I type these words from a mattress on the floor in the basement. He never took my phone away. He's taken good care of me. Shannon lies beside me, and sings a few lullabies to us, the others Jack brought home. 

There's half a dozen here, emaciated by the weakness we thought we were alleviating.

I know a few of them. Waitresses I thought moved on to other jobs. A bouncer Jack said we didn't need from way back. No one can walk. Few can manage words at all. 

Only Shannon, the earliest victim of the drawer can get out of bed and use the bathroom on her own. She usually sleeps after. We all do. We sleep, and wait for Jack, and pray the lights stay on because they are there, all around us. 

Once, the power went out, and our soft, whispered screams were a tormented choir of panic and despair. 

The demons in the dark, Shannon named them. We don't know what they want or why they stay. Jack thinks our use of the drawer drew other malevolent entities that wait for us to die. 

“I think you belong to the one in the wall,” he said over a bowl of soup he was feeding me. “But maybe once you're gone… they can do something.”

I groaned my dissatisfaction with this observation. He apologized but explained - keeping nothing from us - that before I came to his basement, another user of the drawer had died in the bed I currently occupied. When she expired, Jack said he thought he saw something happening around her body.

“Like a subtle change in light,” he said, “nearly translucent smoke.” He shrugged. “Or maybe I imagined it. Maybe all our minds are cracked - or cracking in my case - in the same way, and there are no creatures in the dark at all. We've all gone mad with a kind of precision. Of course, I don't see them but the death of…” and he talked on and on to fill the constant silence in the room. 

I found out about Sam from Jack. The article said he disappeared from care, just walked out the door. His tortured and burned remains could only be identified by his clothing and eventual dental records. He was found in the gorge. No killer arrested.

“I'll let you know if there's more,” Jack told me.

I cried and cried and I cry every day for Sam. 

For what I did to him.

It's taken years to type this. I can manage a few words at a time. More recently, I gained the use of my left hand. 

So I posted because there's nothing more to do except exist, maybe, as a cautionary tale.

Don't be so quick to give in to fantasies of relief from your problems. At best, you'll only exchange your worries for new ones, and it won't be a fair trade in the end.

Or maybe I don't know anything, and you can figure out a way to make a deal with demons that won't destroy everything you love or kill you.

Jack says he's going to sell the Cat and Cathedral after [Christmas](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot/s/LMABL2xZVa).
