Part 1

It was new years eve 2017 and I was at a loss for what to do. All my friends had betrayed me, my girlfriend and I were still fighting. After that strange vision she wouldn’t talk to me anymore.

I sat alone in my parents basement and looked at my pile of video games. Xenoblade 2, a recent addition to my collection, was what I would play if it wasn’t a shell of a game that reminded me of that neptunia curse.

I heard Yahweh’s voice in my head. ‘If you play any more of Xenoblade 2 you are going to get a tick from the wendigo curse. It got you once before, remember that dream?’

‘What dream?’ I thought in response.

I then remembered a dream I had where my girlfriend at the time and I were screwing, and then her head spun around and looked at me with her eyes gouged out. In the dream I couldn’t stop and just kept going. Her head with the gouged out eyes just looked at me the whole time.

‘What game got me there?’ I thought.

Yahweh responded ‘It wasn’t a game, it was that fight club DVD commentary you watched. You don’t want to know what happens if you watch all 3 commentaries. Why don’t we watch Fight Club again, so I can show you all the red flags to watch out for.’

I thought why not, and popped my fight club DVD in. I saw the fake Drew Barrymore title screen it always started with and heard Yahweh’s voice.


‘Even the menus are in on these curses. The labels to.’ Yahweh said.

I started up the movie and it was blaring loud.

Yahweh spoke. ‘The beginning of this movie and at multiple other points it gets super loud. And there is a part of this movie about insomnia, with an anti truth about lack of sleep not being able to kill you. If you put this on while you're trying to sleep it can get you with a curse of outer darkness tick every time it wakes you up.’

I watched the part of the movie Yahweh mentioned and noticed that you couldn’t see anyone’s eyes.

Yahweh spoke up again. ‘When you can’t see someone's eyes and you should, that's a sign of a wendigo curse, particularly if they are gouged out. And this movie is actually worse than that. Almost every shot of this entire movie has someone looking into the camera. That is such a big red flag.’

I continued watching and realised he was right. Every shot of this movie with a crowd, or someone in the background had someone looking right into the camera.

Yahweh spoke up again. ‘Don’t watch the whole thing you idiot! Fast Forward it!’


I fast forwarded it for a bit then paused it, right on a still image of Tyler that was spliced in.



Yahweh monologued ‘Yeah I know it says that in the commentary but that’s not the point. These spliced in Tyler images are just the beginning. Evangelion has tons of dummy plug evas spliced in for another example. Tons of movies have crap like this in it. And it’s worse still! Don’t you dare buy a monitor with anymore than a 60hz refresh rate. The Caesareans are going to have a field day once the refresh rates are high enough that no one will notice.’


I was freaking out. ‘What, you mean they are going to splice images on my computer screen while I’m using it?’


Yahweh laughed ‘Yeah Sean. They have back doors built into everything from windows 95 forward. While you're plugged into the internet they have more power over your computer than you do if they want to use it. Remember that random snuff film where the cheerleader was drilling holes in her boyfriend's head? Yeah you didn’t download that, they put it there.’


I remembered that weird movie he was talking about. I watched like two minutes of it, then fast forwarded and realised the whole movie was just torture.


Yahweh laughed, ‘That’s not the only snuff film you’ve seen. Remember the changeling in Krull? Yeah he actually got bitten by a Brazilian wandering spider, that's why he made that face. Hell the part in Fight Club where Tyler beats that dude is actually real. They just deep faked the actors' faces over it.’


We got to that part in the movie next and I wanted to puke knowing it was real.


Just then my brother came down the stairs and looked at the TV.


He spoke in a mocking tone. “Why don’t you watch something cool like the marvel cinematic universe? Or better yet, come upstairs and drink with me and the old man.”


I looked at the TV and then responded. “I’ll be up in a minute”


He went back upstairs and Yahweh spoke to me
‘Your family is a bigger danger to you than that movie right now. You need to move out pronto! Turn this garbage off and never watch it again! Especially alone on your birthday.’



I turned it off and for some reason decided to head upstairs



My brother, Mother and father were all sitting at the dinner table drinking. They lured me in with small talk and then all started verbally assaulting me.

Scott shrieked “Liar! Mother never tried to get you circumcised!”

I had told him over Christmas about what had happened to me in third grade and he had not said he didn’t believe me until right now.

A screaming match ensued and my parents were both obviously backing him up

I wasn’t about to agree with them and grew tired of arguing. I tried to leave and head back downstairs and my brother roundhouse punched me in the face. I responded with a perfect hook and he reeled backwards.


I would have beat the shit out of him but my father grabbed me and held me back.


I went back into the basement afterwards and couldn’t believe how betrayed I felt.



Shortly after that I bought a car and moved to my very own bachelor apartment. It wasn’t much but I didn’t have a job and was just coasting off the ring for now. Just being away from my evil witch mother, and the rest of my family was enough.


Me and Clara were still off and on, she definitely didn’t want me moving in, so we had separate apartments. 

Not long after I moved into my apartment some strange men showed up to talk.

I went outside and before I knew it I was in the back of a squad car being taken against my will to the psych ward.

After I checked in a pure black african woman doctor came to check up on me.

“Have you been seeing the devil?” she asked with fervour.

I was worried about how long I would be held here. “I haven’t seen him very many times, it was only once!”


She looked at me “We need to know when you see him again.”


She left after that and I was stuck in the psych ward.


It was boring but at least the food was good.


I noticed a familiar face as I walked around, studying the other patients. It was a man from the vision god had shown me.


“Hey what's your name?” I asked.



He looked at me with rage in his eyes “Santa clause, dragon magic, we were all torn apart!” he screamed.


Another man came up to me “You must be insane if you will talk to Robert. I know who you are, mr black magic!”

I was confused. “Mr black magic? What are you talking about?”


He squinted at me “Oh you know.”



I tried to keep to myself after that and read most of the time. Every day the doctor would wake me up and give me my meds and ask. “Have you seen the devil?”


I always said no and was kept for another day.


After a few days they accused me of cheeking my meds and wanted me to sign a waiver so they could give me injections instead.

My black Doctor spoke softly “Sean I know you have trouble getting up in the morning. This way we don’t have to wake you up, we can just inject your meds while you sleep. This really is the easiest way.”

The nurse spoke up next “You can’t cheek a needle”



I refused to sign their waver. They would ask me all the time but I didn’t cave.



One night while the patients were sleeping and I was reading Yahweh spoke to me once more.


‘I let them abduct you for a reason. I have something I want to show you.’


Yahweh then activated my crown and I phased through the floor. I landed then phased through the next, and the next, until I was in the basement.


It was dark but I could still see thanks to the crown.



I looked around and saw a number of glass cages. I went up to one and saw a tsetse fly as big as a crow in one. The others had black wasps, centipedes and other monstrosities, all around the same size as crows.


I was grossed out and went up the stairs into the geriatric ward. I walked down the hall until I saw an old man limping. 


“Help me!” He begged before falling over.



He started screaming next and huge wasp larvae burrowed out of his skin.


I ran down the hall and phased through the door into the emergency ward.


A member of staff was sitting there reading a book and noticed me.


“Patient! You aren't allowed in here!” He said after recognising me.


I was escorted back to my room and Yahweh turned off the crown.


Yahweh said ‘One more thing you need to see then they will let you go. That's better because they will come after you again if you just leave.’


A few days later I had a really scary dream. I was at a table with my family and they were all talking about my different body parts, and who got to eat what. 


I got up and left the table, then went outside. Before I knew it a huge black dragon flew from the horizon to right beside me. 



I turned to run and felt the fabric of reality wrap around every part of me.


It said telepathically ‘I want you to be my martyr.’




I realised I was dreaming and chose to wake up.


I sat in the psych ward looking around the room in terror. That was the scariest dream I had had in a long time.


Before I knew it the room disappeared and I flew into the sky. Seconds later I was floating above the earth, looking down over it.


The black dragon floated next to me. “Come young Caesar! I have saved your life before! Let me remind you.”


The next thing I knew we were at xplornet, a company  I used to work at.


Me and Nibiru floated watching me and Angus work minutes before I left when my shift ended at 2am.


“This was the last time you ever saw angus. After you leave they abduct him, torture and then kill him. They would have done the same to you. If you didn’t get fired.”



We watched as I left, and then Angus, who worked overnights, was one of the only two people in the building. He did overnight tech support.



We watched him until his last break when he was going back to his desk.





He paused and a door that usually led to a server room was open. It led to a white room with a weird fleshy computer.


Angus looked at the computer for a second then walked in to inspect it. There was a monitor at the top and he watched it for a second before it spoke.


“Chances of being Julius Caesar. 0%. Value to DSG. 45%. Recommendation, termination 80%, Promotion 20%.” The computer said after checking Angus.


Another door opened and 4 armed men with body armour came in.


“You heard the quantum computer. We need 95% promotion for you to live.” One of them said.


They then all started pistol whipping angus. One of them took out a knife and skinned him while the other two held him down.


He screamed and the other overnight staff member came in with a smile. He watched for a minute before taking a picture of Angus’s tortured face.


They killed Angus shortly after and then started joking about how well I was going to do in a few days when they did the same thing to me.


We fast forwarded in time a few days and then it was me standing at the entrance looking at the quantum computer. I looked at it for a second, then went back to my desk and started taking calls.


“You would have gotten Angused if I let you go in there!” Nibiru said to me. “Instead they quietly fired you.”


I looked at the dragon, “what was the point of that?” I asked.


Nibiru cackled. “Because here I saved your life and now I’m going to save your soul. That evil harpy Clara is going to come back, she’s going to lure you in again. Make you feel loved and then push you, harder and harder. She’s going to try and make you kill her so you commit the unpardonable sin against her. But I’m going to watch over you in this 4D chess game. Me and you VS Clara and the Fuschia dragon. We’ll make her commit the unpardonable sin against you. Now tell the doctor you saw Saren instead of me and they will let you go.”


I woke up once he finished talking and the African doctor looked at me. “Have you been seeing the devil?”

I looked her in the eye and said “Yes”


I then recounted some of what had happened in the vision. She was delighted. “You are cured!” she said.


I was allowed to leave later that day and went home to my apartment.


A few days later Clara showed up and started being all cutesy and I couldn’t turn her away. I wondered, was the black dragon for real? Is this some awful chess game in the bedroom?
