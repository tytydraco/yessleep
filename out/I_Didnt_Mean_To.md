We all like to think of ourselves as good people… don’t we? I mean, I know I do, or at least I did. But that was before. Before I…

Well, I won’t tell you what I did — not just yet, anyway. We’ll get to that later. If I told you right now, you’d probably stop listening.

She’s so beautiful, you know? September Johnson; she’s so pretty, like an angel.

I used to watch her… every day, from a distance: at her locker, in the lunch line, from the back of the class. I’d follow her home, keeping my distance of course, always trying to avoid creeping her out. The last thing I wanted was to creep her out.

Occasionally we’d talk, but only in passing and not very often, far less than I wished anyway. And it was always about mundane things, things I didn’t really care about. Often, she would go on and on about herself. At first I’d follow along, but inevitably I’d catch myself, some time later in the conversation, staring at her lips, or her neck… her collar bone, or her waterfall like dangly hairs that draped down the sides of her face like ribbon framing her pillow like cheeks.

She moved into my neighborhood earlier this year, only two doors down, catty-corner across the street, just up the block. At first, I was like her only friend. She didn’t know anybody else. It didn’t take long for that to fade away.

She’s been here less than a year, but she is already running with The Clique. That’s what the top group of popular girls called themselves: The Clique. Hell, she was like their new leader, especially since Aubrey Aniston had fallen ill and was currently admitted to Saint Gertrude.

Now, me, as far as popularity goes, I like to think that I was in the middle somewhere, but the truth is — I was invisible. Honestly, I really didn’t mind it so much. Being popular seemed to require investing great effort into frivolous endeavors and the strategic handing out of sycophantic accolades.

My best friend, Rowan Atlas — now he was popular; not top-tier-super-popular or anything, but popular enough. He was our star linebacker. He even had a cool nickname. Everybody called him ‘Roman,’ like flipping the ‘w’ upside down into an ‘m,’ something that he used to do by accident when he was younger. So it just kinda stuck.

Roman and I had been friends since grade school. The Cave Crew, our group of D&D friends, wasn’t his only group, but it was the only group for the rest of us, and he was kinda like our fearless leader.

So anyway… They all knew how bad I’d fallen for September. Any typical night, I’d probably mention her at least once every five or ten minutes. I knew it was driving them all nuts, but I couldn’t help myself, and furthermore, I didn’t care. Yeppers, I had it really bad — which is what makes what happened all that much worse.

Roman and I actually got in a fight about it one game night, down in The Cave. That’s what we called Steve Stainer’s basement. It was perfect for D&D: gloomy, cold, and had a lone lightbulb on a wire in the middle of the room. The local train sounded like an underground monster every time it rattled the house on its way by. We thought it helped with the atmosphere.

Anyway, Roman left, angry and ashamed, after he’d let me loose from his headlock. I’m sure that I deserved it, though — it was my turn at game master, and I had annoyingly put September in as a character, a queen, and made my character her king. Tacky, I know, but again, I didn’t care. I had it bad.

She wasn’t even there. She didn’t play with us. She didn’t even know who most of us were.

But I’d broken a code, our code, the gentleman’s code of The Cave Crew.

At first the argument seemed lighthearted and goofy, but it didn’t end that way. It was my fault. I know that now.

Later that evening I walked down to Roman’s house to apologize. He just lived two doors down, catty-corner across the street, just down the block, the other way.

He wasn’t home, and his parents didn’t know where he was. They said he hadn’t come home from D&D yet, and they were a little surprised to see me.

They mentioned that the last time they had talked to Roman, he had told them that I was angry at him over some girl, which didn’t make sense at the time, considering that he hadn’t even been home yet. How would he know we were going to get in a fight? Anyway, so I was a little curious about when they might have had that conversation.

Anyway, I walked away a bit confused, but that didn’t last long.

I started into my regular, nightly routine and climbed up the tree across the street from September’s house. Either she didn’t realize just how sheer her curtains were, or she actually enjoyed the thought of someone spying on her. I liked to imagine that it was the latter… and that she knew it was me.

I even kept some supplies tucked away in a crevice, in an old abandoned squirrel’s nest between two of the larger branches.

The binoculars are why I hadn’t noticed him right away. Her window occupied my entire purview. So all that I could see was her and the dark inside walls of my long-range spectacles.

It wasn’t until I lowered my spyglasses, in a moment of weakness to scratch an itch, that I saw him.

He was walking up her steps with a box of chocolates in one hand and a large bouquet of flowers in the other, tucked behind his back. He was just about to ring the doorbell when I sneezed. Anger always makes me sneeze, and I was furious, so incredibly angry that my head felt like a water balloon about to run out of space.

In an instant, Roman spun around. “Who’s that? Who’s there?”

As mad as I was, I was still in a very unfortunate and embarrassing position. I held my breath. I could feel the heat of my face turning red as I was running out of air.

His eyes darted all around as he shouted again. “Who’s there? Show yourself, you coward!”

Suddenly, he stopped moving. His brow furrowed as his eyes focused on the base of the tree. I looked down. My backpack was lying folded over at the bottom of the tree trunk. His eyes slowly scaled up to where I was perched.

He opened his mouth to speak. I cut him off. I was like, “What the hell, Roman?”

That’s when I slipped.

I’m hanging from the tree about three stories up.

Roman gasps, drops the flowers and the box of chocolates down in September’s front yard, and runs out into the street underneath me — his arms held straight out, ready to try and break my fall.

I probably could have yelled or something. I don’t know why I didn’t warn him. Maybe it was my own sense of self-preservation. I didn’t want to get caught. Maybe it was sheer selfishness, or maybe it was cowardice. Doesn’t matter. I don’t know. I still can’t believe… I just… I didn’t know that I could be that cold.

I’m hanging there, in pure panic. I look to my left. I can’t believe Roman doesn’t hear them coming, probably because he’s yelling, “I gotcha. I gotcha, buddy. I’m here.”

One of the girls in the pickup truck has her hands over Scotty Adler’s eyes. He can’t see where he’s driving. Another girl is flipping the cab lights on and off like a dance club strobe light. Todd Kelly is laughing it up in the back while slamming a beer.

The music hits Roman before the truck does. He pivots just in time to fall on his butt and take it to the head on the front bumper. His body spins just enough for his legs to put a little bounce under the back driver’s side wheel. They tear off down the road, just laughing it up, with no clue what they’ve just done.

I look at my twisted friend lying in the middle of the street as my hands start to slip from around the branch. Ready to die, I close my eyes and hold my breath as my body falls, not down but sideways, diagonally into the tree trunk. The binocular strap has saved me. It’s lodged behind my neck and under one arm. I’m barely hanging on.

The popping sounds of leather slipping from the buckle make my celebration short-lived. Quick as I can, my arms fumble and grab at nearby branches on my way to the ground.

I come to, hearing the moans of my friend on the street behind me. Rolling over to crawl to him, my head aches like it’s caught in a vice — the higher I get up, the greater the pressure. I’m looking around, up and down the street. The streetlights burn a hole in my brain as my eyes struggle to adjust.

Nobody.

There’s nobody here.

There’s nobody anywhere to be seen, except for a few neighbors moseying around inside their houses. Their lights are on. They can’t see out.

I’m looking down at Roman.

“Hu… He… Heeeelp… me.” Sigh.

I’m looking deeply into his eyes, as he is at mine. I’ve never seen them so wide, so vibrant, so alive… so troubled.

We share a lifetime of conversations in that moment, without even speaking a single word, like a flash flood of telepathic knowledge being exchanged. I know what he knows. He knows my thoughts. For a time we are one.

His light slowly fades as I remove my hand and fingers from his nose and mouth.

His hands stop sliding around my forearms as his arms fall gently to his sides like the petals of a fading flower.

A voice calls out to me.

I look up. “September?”

Her voice shakes behind her trembling fingers. “I… I… came outside… and… Oh, my God. What happened?”

“There was an accident.” Says my face without a shred of permission from my brain. My ingrained selfishness and my callous lack of remorse are speaking for me now. I’m just along for the ride.

Her eyes switch from looking at Roman to looking at me. “Is he…?” Chokes underneath her crying.

I put my arms around her; one hand breaches the small of her back. The other cradles the back of her head. “Yes.”

I bend down, retrieve the chocolates and flowers, and hand them to September. “I brought these for you.” I look back over my shoulder. “Roman came along for support. I’ve always been… kinda shy.” Sniffle, hard swallow, as I wipe away a couple of tears with my wrist. “He never saw them coming…” My voice shakes. “And they just kept going.”

Trauma bonding can be a powerful thing in a relationship. So I’ve been doing my best to help September cope with the experience.

The problem isn’t the horribleness of what happened. The problem is… that I liked it.

A secret like this can weigh heavily on your soul. There’s only so long that a person can hold something like this in, even a strong-willed person, which I am most definitely not.

I’ve only ever told one person, one friend, one single other living soul the truth, the whole story. I told my friend, my best friend, Karl Burton.

Karl’s reply was so simple, but it sure did set my mind at ease. He just looked at me, smiled, shook his head, and said, “Well, huh, imagine that. I guess he shouldn’t’ve been rude to Robert.”
