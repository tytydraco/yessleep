I haven’t been able to sleep in days, and maybe I’m paranoid, but I think someone is watching me. I will start from the beginning; perhaps it’s all in my head. 



My boyfriend left on a work trip three days ago, and I have felt uneasy ever since. Granted, I hate being home alone. We live in an oversized house for two people. But my boyfriend said it was a great deal for four bedrooms and two full baths. His job pays for the home, so I didn’t have much to say. The house is old. It was probably built in the 1800s, or at least that’s what it seems like. Being alone feels eerie. The house takes a while to settle at night. The sounds keep me up at night, creeping, wind hitting the side of the house, and occasionally thuds like heavy footsteps. 



But that’s not why I have been feeling anxious. For the last three nights, I have felt like someone is staring at me

through the kitchen window before I go to bed. I usually do all the dishes from dinner before I get into bed. It’s one of my favorite windows in the house. It perfectly faces the mountains where no buildings, busy streets, or anything obstructs the view. One of the reasons why we moved to Utah. But lately, the window has just been giving me the creeps. As I look out into the darkness, I feel eyes staring right back. I’ve always hated that feeling. 



My boyfriend keeps telling me it’s nothing and that I’m just being paranoid. He says



 “Calm down, babe. You always get like this when I’m away.” 



He is correct, but this time it feels different, and last night was the worst one yet. As I said, I like to look at the mountains when I wash dishes, but last night it was darker than usual, and I could have sworn I saw a figure. It was the scariest thing. The figure was human-shaped, as I know it. It looked like a man’s figure, almost like his shoulders rolled forward. I couldn’t see a face because he was wearing a hood. Maybe a hoodie or jacket; it was too dark to tell. Anyhow it scared the crap out of me. I audibly yelped so loud that my cat Jinx jumped on the counter to see what was wrong. She took one look outside. She looked wide-eyed out the window as if staring at the figure. When I looked again, the figure was gone. But Jinx kept staring out the window wide-eyed and still as a statue. It freaked me out, and eventually, I had to snap her out of it. It always creeps me out when animals look at things that aren’t there. 





Anyway, I’m rambling now. The biggest thing is, am I crazy?? Is this all in my head, or did I really see someone out there? I can’t shake this feeling. My boyfriend will barely talk to me about this and keeps pushing the subject aside, uninterested in my paranoia. I feel so dumb. I’ll be alone for at least a month, maybe more. Has anyone ever experienced this? I need some peace of mind to help me get past this. 



If there are any updates, I’ll post them again. Hopefully, I won’t have anything more to post, though.
