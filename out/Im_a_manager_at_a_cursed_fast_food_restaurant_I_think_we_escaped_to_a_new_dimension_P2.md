Hello, and welcome all. To my shock and still disbelief, we have lived long enough for us to make a part two. Our situation ended with me running Mr Morbid off the road. Now, we’ve been driving for a while and we haven’t seen a sign of him. 

However, we did have to pull over and take a head count. Me, Emma, Skylar, Giovanni, Tyler, and Michael. We also double checked that the walkies we all had were working. During this time, I read the rules for the van. The rules are as follows:

Rule One: If you see Mr Morbid on the side of the road, RUN HIM OVER. Should you miss or notice him too late, refer to rule 3a

Rule two: If you hear the radio cutting on and off, turn it off and pop open the engine. Kill whatever is in the engine space.

Rule 3: If you see a dark hooded man with a sign, pull over and ask him for directions to Earth. If he says Up, pull out as fast as you can. If you see him again, run him over. If he says down, shoot him in the face. 

3a: Should you fail to do this in time, hit the gas and drive as fast and as far as you can. Ignore the figures running next to you. And NEVER answer the shadow figure that will appear in the empty seat. Do your best to ignore him.

4: Never sit in the seat with the blood stains on it. That belongs to Carcass, who is the shadow figured mentioned in rule 3a.

5: If at any point you hear tapping coming from inside the van, stop the van and open the spare tire compartment. If there’s a creature in there, kill it. If there’s a severed hand, RUN back to the drivers seat and FLOOR IT. It has escaped.

6: Once you reach the way back, a rift of light should be visible and the van radio should repeat whatever sentence it had previously been on. If the rift is black but the radio repeats, go around it. If the rift is light but the radio cuts out, DRIVE THE OTHER DIRECTION. 

7: If the road starts to turn blood red, then turn around and floor it. If it’s still red within 10 minutes, do not get out of the van for ANY reason. Even if you hear screaming or voices of loved ones, DO NOT.

8: DO NOT STOP AT ANY RESTAURANTS OR GAS STATIONS. Markets are the only safe place.

9: If one of the passengers start talking in the third person, shoot them and dump their body on the side of the road. The real one should appear in a little while.


If these rules didn’t already prove to be real, I would have thrown them out the window myself. But as we were driving and everyone was taking the time to set in our new situation, Gio asked:

“Hey, who’s that guy smiling on the road ahead?”

I looked, and to my dismay, Mr Morbid stood tall with his menacing grin, staring at the van. I immediately turned lanes and ran him over with all the force I could. He flew into a pile of bushes a solid 50 meters away. I drove  away fast and without missing a beat, Michael said:

“WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! You ran over someone!”

“It was Mr Morbid. The rules said to if I see him at any point.”

“Oh shit, the dude from Code Red?” Skylar said.

“Yes. I Saw his jackass outside in the trees out back before we left.”

“Oh, damn. They always said to evacuate but never why. He dangerous or something?” Said Emma

“Genuinely, what do you think? You work a job where your manager is provided a gun with infinite ammo for shooting monsters. Our cash registers are SENTIENT.” 

Now, she stared snickering as she took it in. The air started to lift as the gravity of the situation has already set in, since we were making jokes about our impending doom. 

We drove for at least another two hours before the radio started cutting out. I pulled over the van and prepared the hand gun. I popped open the front and a curled up lanky shadow was tinkering with the engine in a fetal position. I grabbed it and threw it out of the engine. It hissed and revealed the most terrifying eyes I have ever seen on a being.

They were almost placid, but I could FEEL all the anguish and terror behind those vomit yellow eyes. It made me step back in pure fear. It lunges to me, and I shot it in the soldier. It shrieked, and I shot it again in the stomach. It tripped on the road side and fell. It disappeared into the air, as it floated away into ashes. 

I hurriedly ran to the van and drove off.

“WHAT WAS THAT?!” Said Gio.

Without saying a word, I threw the rules manual into the back. 

“Read it.”

After about two minutes, he said:

“Great, because more damn rules are what we need to survive.” 

“Yeah, we kind of do, dumbass. I just shot a shadow creature that struck terror into me with its eyes. Would you have preferred it sabotaged the engine?” 

“I… fair.” 

“But I get what you’re saying. The bright side is, if the world isn’t on fire when we get back, We get a HUGE government payout.” I said.

“Wait, really?! I can live a comfortable life WITHOUT risking my life slinging burgers?!” Tyler said enthusiastically. 

“Maybe. I’ve only heard about it.”

“Still, I’ll hold you to that.”

“I’d expect no less.”

Another hour passes by, and I eventually see a market. It’s relatively medium sized and has stalled filled to the brim with food. A large red and white sign above it says market. We get out and enter, but it’s been abandoned. Only the products remain. The people seem to have never been here at all.

“Sweet, free food!” Emma says, excited.

“Is it safe to eat?” Asks Skylar.

“The rules seemed to have said so.”

“Okay, I’m not taking that chance.” She said

I walk around for a little while longer and grab some fruit and snacks, seeing as we have no heat to actually make anything. But as I walk towards a stall with chocolates and desserts, I noticed a figure standing by the entrance. A tall, lanky figure, who was smiling a deeply unnatural smile, which curved into his cheeks like it was breaking his jaw. Mr Morbid had returned.

But this time, he wore a black and white gentlemen’s suit with a brimmed bowlers hat, yet his eyes were still covered by some sort of shadow that was not coming from the bowlers cap. I ducked into the produce building and spoke into the walkie on my shoulder.

“Hide. Mr Morbid is guarding the entrance.”

I’ve been hiding behind a register counter for the past couple of hours. It only now occurred to me that I should update you all. I can hear his sickly and vile voice calling out to us. God only knows what will happen to us. Please, wish us luck. And I’ll hopefully see you all in another update.
