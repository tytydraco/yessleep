I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found a book detailing an expedition to Igloolic. After reading it I found this story particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

After Hugo died the Inquisition was different. There was an Immediate power struggle between me, Hugo's protege, and the former grand Inquisitor. We kept it civil, and since he had more support, he was titled Grand Inquisitor. It didn't really matter, he did a fine job and neither of us were Hugo.

After Hugo died, the light of god shone dimmer upon the Inquisition. The ceremony stayed the same, but the masters stopped receiving halos. Everyone seemed at a loss without Hugo to lead them.

There even seemed to be a brain disease floating around. Inquisitors would start acting strange, using torture while clearly still believing. They seemed no different than the witches we were hunting. I and those loyal to me said they had started using Samaelian logic.

It took years for the rot to really set in, but when it did it hit hard. The inquisition had become brutal, delighting in the torment of their captives. Samael's presence was small at first but grew and grew.He clearly had a base of operations from where his physical presence in our world was growing.

The inquisition searched for the Baronet, but without Hugo moral was low and it seemed like we would never find her.

Then at last in 1727, 24 years after Hugo had died we finally heard a tale from an Eskimo about her location. It was way up north, father north than we had been searching. But the problem was clearly getting out of hands. Fleeing Eskimos were telling tales of a White Witch, living in a ice palace tended by giants. The Eskimos said squadrons of bird sized wasps raid their villages. Sometimes they would abduct their victim afterwards; sometimes they would just leave them there, filled with eggs waiting to hatch.

It was thankfully midsummer when we found out. We could mount an expedition immediately, without waiting for the next year. Blynken was a master as well by this point, but he never got a halo. He had to be the one to kill the Baronet in order to permanently banish Samael. We took two other masters with us, master  *Maximillion* and master Trent.  *Maximillion* had a halo from the old times, master Trent did not.

So much of the inquisition had started using samaelian logic that we had a hard time finding inquisitors to go. We ended up leaving with 1 manowar and 1 icebreaker. We barely managed to find 29 inquisitors willing to go.

We left at the beginning of August, arriving at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy by the end of September.  As we sailed north along the coast adjacent to Baffin island the water started to ice over. It never really melted this far north and had only brought one ice breaker. The ice breaker would get us out if we needed it too, we weren't taking the ships any farther. We anchored the ships and set out on horseback

We eventually came up on a group of Eskimos ice fishing. We brought a translator thankfully.

"Where is the ice palace?"

The Eskimo responded "Igloolik"

The translator responded "There is a palace over there"

We walked in the direction the Eskimo pointed and before long we saw it on the horizon. It was large, made of large snow cubes.

The horses whinnied and I got a chill. I started hearing buzzing and saw manhawks coming towards us. Then inquisitors murmured of abandoning the mission as they got in formation. The wasps landed far away and started their dance. If you could over power the illusion it was the easiest way to kill them, so we dismounted and approached on foot.

The group of woman was roughly one for every inquisitor, and they sang like sirens. They danced back and forth towards us sings and moaning. I approached one and it shifted a little bit, looking like my favorite mistress. She scuttled forward, naked on her back walking like a crab.

"Its not too cold Jacob, you can get undressed." she said as she scuttled towards me.

I didn't respond. Giving into the illusion in any way was bad. I cut off her feet and she turned into a manhawk. Its head was removed.

I looked around and couldn't believe how many men were paralyzed. only 13 inquisitors still stood. The others lay paralyzed, being repeatedly stung and filled with eggs.

The remaining manhawks fled as we approached, leaving the inquisitors paralyzed.

Then we saw the giants, they were already almost upon us. They were monstrous, 14, maybe 15 feet tall. 4 of them wore polar bear hides, the largest wearing a walrus hide. They had hats made from the heads.

We didn't have time to mount our horses so I just braced for impact. The giant had a spear, but thankfully didn't seem very smart. He charged at me carelessly and I rolled between his legs. I turned around and his head was going back and forth looking for me. I slashed his stocky leg and my sword barely made it through. I ran along his back and slashed the neck only to be grabbed by another giant.

He held me, my arms pinned to my sides. He headbutted me and knocked me out.

I awoke in a prison cell in the ice palace. For the first two days we were fed little and beaten daily.

After a week we were taken into the throne room. I looked like the Baronet, all sluglike and gargantuan on her throne of lies. She looked us over with an ageless evil in her eyes. She looked surprised, then delighted when she recognized me and Blynken. She motioned and we were set aside. Without us there were 23 inquisitors there in that room, before the white witch.

"You will lay on backs and swear an oath to me or die" she giggled.

The inquisitors looked from one to another. then 13 of them dropped on their backs and said in unison "We are Samael's little playthings, and we will serve the white witch" they recited Samael on their faces. I noted Trent was among them. He should never have been made a master.

The ones who still stood started yelling, other than  *Maximillion* who remained stoic. The larvae burst from the standing inquisitors and  *Maximillion* laughed.

"When Yahweh is with me you can cause me no pain, witch" he said callously.

Ge grabbed two of the wasp larvae and ran to the Baronet. He dodge rolled between the guards and jumped on top of her. He stuck the stingers of the larvae into her eyes and she screamed in obvious agony.

The guards grabbed him and as they pulled him away he spat on her.

"I've seen how this ends witch. All three of you go to outer darkness." He said in triumph. He went limp as the life left his eyes.

"Bring the vessel, bring the vessel. I"m in pain!" the white witch screamed.

The guards looked from one to another then some of them ran out of the room. They came back with a woman dressed in a black robe, eerily similar to Samael's. She seemed comatose and they brought her before the white witch.

"Give me your soul!" She screamed

"Yes mother" The woman said.

I saw with my third eyes as their souls swapped bodies. The slug started crying like a child.

The woman said "Take them to their rooms." and the guards took me and Blynken away.

I was left in a nice room really, nothing like the cell in was in before. It had no windows but there was a polar bear skin bed framed with bones, and a little bone chest full of cloths. I did not approve of the decorations though. There was a dead manhawk in one of the corners and numerous heads on the walls. Some wasp, some polar bear some human.

I sat on the bed envying Hugo's ability to phase through walls. It would really help me out right now. I sat there in thought wondering what time it was.

Then a guard came to get me. "Come have dinner with your Grandmother" he said to me. I was taken off guard but had no choice but to comply.

He took me down the halls to a room with a large bone table where a man and the Baronet were sitting with Blynken. Blynked looked terrified. I sat down.

"Do you want your seal raw or cooked?" The Baronet asked me sweetly.

"I'm getting mined cooked" Blynken said with sarcasm.

"Cooked" I said in disbelief.

"You youngins and your cooked meat. All the flavor really just comes out when you have it raw" she said.

"We aren't going to wait" The man and Baronet said in unison, Samael on both of their face. The slaves brought in some a bowl of seal eyes for the Baronet and a slap of raw meat for the man. They ate with the demon of gluttony.

Me and Blynken looked at each other. Before long they brought in our cooked meat and we started eating.

"Won't you have some seagull wine deary?" she said sweetly as a slave poured her a glass.

"No thank you I'm good" I said, almost puking.

"More for us" The man chimed in before kissing the Baronet.

"Now if this is going to work we are going to have to role-play" She said, with Samael on her face.

"What?" me and Blynken said, out of harmony.

"Jacob, you are going to be Jackie, and Blynken you are going to be Dora." she said sweetly.

"No fucking way." I said.

Blynken looked at me and then at the Baronet, visibly disturbed.

"Master Jacob, I will choose death. And I hope you do the same." he said solemnly.

before I could respond the Baronet scream, full of venom and malice. "Is that any way to speak to your sister? Beat her until she accepts her new gender!"

The guards grabbed me and held me while they beat Blynken.

"What d you have too say to your misbehaving sister?" she belched at me.

"Go to outer darkness you awful witch!" I screamed in rage.

We were then taken back to the dungeon. We were fed little and beaten daily. After a week our bodies were destroyed. We were missing teeth, had multiple broken bones and were barely alive.

One day we were taken into a different chamber. This one filled with young men. The Baronet was in her slug body.

"Set them on the altar" she said with a menacing tone.

The guards put Blynken on one altar and a boy on the other. The Baronet started talking in some unknown, Samaelian language and a bucket of urine was thrown over both of them.

All of a sudden the young man started growing older and and Blynken started healing. The young man grew into an old man in the span of seconds and then died. Blynken was totally healed.

"Yours is the fate of Prometheus, until you submit to me!" She screamed in an unholy screech.

Blynken burst into tears. And started sobbing. He was removed on the altar and I was put there. The same process was performed. I was taken back to my 'room'.

The next day a guard showed up and told me to go have breakfast with my parents and sister. I went down to the room with a table to see Blynken, the Baronet, and that strange Eskimo man.

"Jackie how do you want your meat?" Blynken said, Samael on his face.

"Cooked" I said holding back tears. I was alone now.

"I know its breakfast but I could really go for glass of seagull wine right now" The strange Eskimo said.

The slaves brought in everyone's raw meat and they all started eating. "Mom said I'll get scurvy eventually if I don't eat my meat raw" Blynken said. "You should have it raw too Jackie, its not just the flavor, its also the nutrient content and texture that better." He said between mouthfuls.

I sat there starving, watching them eat. It felt like an eternity before my cooked meat came in. I wasn't partaking in the role-play, I just sat silent with everyone around me acting like I was Jackie.

When I went to my room I felt broken and betrayed. How could Blynken have given in so easily? Lunch was next and I sat there with my family and that strange Eskimo.

My 'Parents" gulped seagull wine. And Blynken looked at it longingly.

"Can Dora have some seagul wine?" Blynken pleaded.

"Alright have a small glass." she said snickering.

The slaves poured him a glass and he drank it in one gulp. The baronet looked cross and said pour Dora a bigger glass." She said with a snicker.

Blynken grabbed the glass and took a gulp  and put it down, most of it still left. The Baronet then grabbed the glass and gulped down the rest.

"That's all you get Dora." She giggled.

"But mommy!" Blynken cried.

The Baronet looked at Blynken "No buts with me Dora!" She giggled.

The strange Eskimo looked at me and said "I brought a present for you" and he handed me a huge glass of milk.

I looked around the room then grabbed the milk and chugged the who thing. When I put the glass down the Eskimo looked at me with Samael on his face.

"Prick" He said staring off into space.

"Jackie have you rejected your assigned gender yet?" the Baronet said to me plainly.

"Go to outer darkness." I responded.

Her eyes lit up with treachery, and then Samael. "Take Jackie to the dungeon"

I was fed little and beaten daily. Every week or so I was healed. The weeks stretched into months and I noticed that I was getting younger, as were the men that's life was being sucked.

I started to wonder If I would ever escape. There were no windows, so I could not count the days. After the first heal though, I was numb too all pain. I still acted like they were hurting me just because I didn't want them to know. Bu I felt no physical pain through those long month in the ice palace.

One day I awoke. And was taken outside. I hadn't been outside in so long I didn't even care that it as cold as a witches teat. It was clearly winter, we walked on a plateau of snow, the top frozen solid. I was taken in chains with a large party as we headed to some unknown location. There were  multiple giants around 14 or 15 feet tall, most wore polar bear coats, a few walrus coats. Then there was the giant the had been at the log fortress. IT was gigantic, maybe 25 feet tall. Did these things just keep growing? IT wore a coat made from a sperm hale, with a hat from its head.

The sun stayed low on the horizon and circled around the entire sky. It must be close to Christmas, I thought to myself.

"Hey Dora!", I called to Blynken.

"What is it Jackie?" Are you cold.

"IS it Christmas?" I asked puzzled.

"Christmas? We don't celebrate Christmas in these parts. It's the winter solstice, the most magical day of the whole year! Every year the Baronet brings an offer to Krampus to thank him for giving her a ride all the way here from New France!" he said delighted. "This is my first solstice here, I wonder what Krampus will get me? I brought him a jar of seagull wine and some seal milk. What did you get for Krampus?"

"This is the first I've heard of this" I said baffled.

"When don't Krampus a gift you get the gift of Beelzebub." he said sternly.

We got too the end of the land and started walking across the frozen ocean. The ice was thick, supporting the giants weight no problem. Eventually we came to an island and the sun went down.

'I have a halo and I am illuminated' I thought, toggling my darkvision.

The Baronet came up to me. "I just wanted you to know that me and your father made sure to spit in every glass of you've drunk in our household."

I almost puked absolutely disgusted. I sat there wishing I could phase through these people and run for anywhere else, when I heard the sound of bells.

Then I heard two voices, one sounded merry and happy, the other sounding like Beelzebub. I looked to the sky and saw two sleighs flying in the air. One was pulled by eight reindeer and had a fat man in a red suit. The other was pulled by 8 skeletal reindeer and had a demon looking thing in a red suit. 'I guess that's Krampus' I thought too myself.

As the two got closer they started firing rainbow lightning at each other. The display lit up the sky for hundreds of miles as the two sleighs fired lightning and occasionally sideswiped each other.

"Krampus and Father Christmas duke it out every year on the solstice. Father Christmas is powered by the good in people all across the world, and Krampus is powered by the evil. They are fighting all year round, but on the solstice its decided who has the upper hand for the next year. This is my 24th solstice, and I've never seen Father Christmas win." she said to Blynken.

Blynken was about to respond when his eyes glazed over. "Dora's back baby!" She cackled.

I was appalled. Dora was back again, and this time in hat looked like a young male body.

The two sleighs were getting closer and I could hear Father Christmas and Krampus talking as they fought.

"In the time between Christmas and new years more people commit suicide than any other time of year!" Krampus yelled.

"Eat these and feel alright, woeful ones!" Father Christmas said, throwing handfuls of amanita muscaria everywhere.

"Jesus was born in the summer, Constantine just masked the pagan holiday tthe winter solstice" Krampus yelled.

"Master Jacob, Nibiru has picked out a special gift for you!" He said throwing me a small metal sword hilt.

I pushed a button and a beam of charged energy came out of the hilt. I cut off my handcuffs and killed 12 slaves around me with one horizontal slash.

I was in the body of a young man, with the skills of a master Inquisitor. Full of an unquenchable blood-lust I surveyed my surroundings. Everyone was looking at me, waiting for me to make the first move. There were 16 giants it total, counting the Sperm Whale covered giant.

"I am the wrath of Nibiru!" I screamed and everything went red.

I moved with uncanny quickness at total random. I was so erratic that they had trouble following me with their eyes, let alone their hands. I shrieked as I effortlessly cut off a giants leg. I rolled sideways, dodging a spear from behind. I giants club came down, missing me by inches. I cut off its hands and rolled backwards, cutting off a giants leg as I came out of the roll. I was hardly consciously aware of what was going on around me in my perfect flow-state. I felt Nibiru guiding me as I fought killing half of the giants before they wouldn't approach me. They stood back puzzled on what to do. There were 8 left, including the biggest one.

I looked up to see Father Christmas and Krampus fighting. Krampus seemed to have the upper hand but Father Christmas was holding his own.

I then noticed a powerful presence from the spirit world, Samael.

"Well you got away did you? You little shit. How about this? You're so fond of Hugo, why not face my son Beelzebub in single combat, like Hugo faced me, all those years ago." Samael offered.

'Fine, challenge accepted' I thought.

The Sperm Whale covered giant had Beelzebub on his face as we both moved at an angle, circling each other. We went in spiral, both looks for an opening, then giant lunged at me with his spear.  I swung me beam saber vertically, cutting the spear right down the middle. The sides feel uselessly to the side. Beelzebub looked terrified as I charged towards him. He started running backwards and tripped, falling.

I jumped up on top of him and dragged my saber in a zigzag as I ran across its body. It was lifeless by the time I reached the head.

Just then father Christmas yelled jollily, "I guess I win this year!" and a bolt of lightning hit Krampus. His smoking sleigh crashed somewhere off in the distance.

The ground then started to shake as Ice giants rose up from the snow. Their eyes glowed gold and they sung bible verses as they marched towards us. The verses were different than in our current bible, uncorrupted and pure. They were oddly the exact same size and number of the remaining 7 giants.

"Can a man be profitable to god?" One said as he smashed a giants skull in.

"Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria"  another chimed as it clubbed a giant in the jaw.

Before long the ice giants had killed the flesh giants and I looked around for the Baronet and Dora. Both were riding reindeer away at full speed. Once everyone but me was dead the ice giants became inanimate, becoming statues.

I walked, following the reindeer and before long they were out of sight. Their footprints disappeared in drifting snow not long after. I wondered aimless for hours, getting colder and colder.

I knew freezing to death wasn't a particularly bad way to go, and I lamented not being able to kill Dora or the Baronet. Even if we couldn't banish Samael, it would still feel good to do it. I walked along looking at the northern lights. Now that I knew were they came from they seemed even more beautiful to me. Then I heard a voice in my head.

"I am Yahweh."

'My lord, am I dead?' I thought back.

"No. And I can get you out of this mess, for a price." he responded.

'What my lord?' I asked.

"That weapon has no business being in this world. I'll tell you what. I'm going to take it off your hands, and instead of dying in the snow I'll teleport you anywhere you want to go, deal?" God asked me.

I was ecstatic! 'Thank you for letting me use it my lord! Take it away and send me back to the monetary in Louisiana' I thought.

I then appeared in the monastery in Louisiana, laughing. The Beam saber was gone.

It is here that I write my story down, so that my contemporaries and future generations may have a true account of what happened on the Spanish Inquisition's first expedition to Igloolik.
