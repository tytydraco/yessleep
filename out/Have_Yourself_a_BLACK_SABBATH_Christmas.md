Hi. My name is Randall Huckabee, I’m a retired librarian. Mr. Excitement, that’s me. As a hobby, I’ve taken to assembling music box figurines. It’s easy, you can order them from Amazon. Since they come mostly assembled, I decided to spruce things up by replacing the music. Not an easy feat, let me tell you. They come equipped with tiny keyboards that only play certain notes. Good thing I learned to play piano.

I like jazz music. Not the over-the-top, can’t-tap-your-toes-to-it jazz, but Cool Jazz. Think: Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck – and if I’m feeling extra spicy – Thelonius Monk. 

My goal was to personalize some figurines and give them to my family. Sounds nice, right? It was a good idea. It truly was. But something went dreadfully wrong.

I made six in total. One for each of my three sisters (all younger), two for my kids (all grown up now), and one for my wife. She’s deceased, but don’t get choked up about that. Life, as they say, must go on. Still, I like to think she’s here with me in this rickety old house. Same house we raised our children many moons ago. 

For the kids (and their spouses), I chose Jack and what’s-her-name from the movie Titanic. You know, the scene where they’re at the bow of the ship, arms locked, gazing at the wondrous world of the ocean. And for music, I added ‘I Will Survive’. Looking back, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea, considering the Titanic sank. But hindsight is what it is, and the irony was lost on me.

For my sisters: tiny ballerinas. As children, they’d parade in their pink tutus, dancing along to the Nutcracker. So, for the music, I chose Carol of the Bells. Finding a music box with that many notes was strenuous. Plus, it’s a difficult tune to play, especially for an arthritic old fart like me. But I persevered. That’s what I do. 

For my darling wife, I wanted something special, seeing how this year would’ve been our wedding 50th anniversary, so I made her an angel who plays Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World. You see, this may be my last Christmas in this rickety old house. Doctors say my time left on earth is limited. But isn’t that true for all of us? Anyway, I’m sidetracking. “Get to the point, Randy!” my wife would say. “You’re procrastinating again!”

Last week, my family showed up for Christmas dinner. We chose to have it earlier in the month, to fit everyone’s hectic schedule. The dinner was nice. My sister Maybelle (the oldest of the bunch) cooked a turkey as plump as ol’ Saint Nick, with all the fixings. My youngest son Luke and his wife brought oven-baked apple pie. Mmm mmm, good.

Then there’s Eitan, my one-and-only grandchild. A real hell-raiser, he is. Damn kid nearly burned the house down, mucking about with the candles during dinner. Although looking back, maybe that would’ve done us all a favor. 

After the Christmas feast, we exchanged gifts. The sisters got me sweaters. Not the cheap ones either. The thick, woolly ones that can endure any winter hardship. The kids chipped in and bought me a TV as big as a movie screen. They even signed me up to all the latest streaming sites. If only I could get the stupid remotes to cooperate, maybe I’d catch a show or two. But I digress.

The trouble started in the wee hours of night. By then, most of the family was gone. The sisters left shortly after the gifts were exchanged (surprise, surprise), and Paul, my oldest, left later that evening; Luke, his wife Charla, and Eitan stayed the night. Eitan, the little brat, kept mucking about with my wife’s figurine, getting his filthy hands all over it. I damn-near skinned his hide, too. Would have, if that were allowed these days. 

The boy slept on the couch, Paul and Charla slept in the spare bedroom. Paul’s old room, in fact. Ralf, my dear ol’ Great Dane, slept with me on the bed, as he always does. Sometime during the night, a creature was stirring, but it wasn’t a mouse. Nor was it quiet. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM.

I shot out of bed like a firecracker. Where’s the banging coming from? And why so friggin’ loud? Figuring it was the neighbors having a party, I buried my head under the pillows.

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

I nearly fell off the bed, it was THAT loud. Greatly distorted, too, like heavy metal music played full volume. I didn’t like it. Neither did Ralf. He started barking, which he rarely does. By now, the entire household was awake, wondering where the hellish racket was coming from. 

We assembled in the living room, rubbing the sleep from our eyes. Paul was hungover, I could tell. Too much eggnog. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The nightmarish noise was ear-splitting. The bass pounded our eardrums into submission. I thought it was the TV, so I started screwing with it, but I inadvertently turned it full bast, adding to the mayhem. Paul was shouting at me, but I couldn’t hear him. I’m partially deaf. Meaning: if the noise was this loud to me, I can only imagine how loud it must’ve been for them.

Eitan, wearing Spider Man pajamas two sizes too small, was bawling, snot sliding down his fatty face. The kid looked like maple syrup was poured over him, and he was trying to lick it off. His mother was freaking. She stole the remote, turned off the TV, then threw the remote against the wall. Good thing it didn’t break.  

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The weight of the noise nearly knocked me over. I’d never heard anything so loud. So offensive. So rude.  

I AM IRON MAN.

The voice was sardonic and overtly cynical. A demon’s voice. And still, nobody knew where it was coming from. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The bass drum was rattling inside my brain. I was shaking all over. Simultaneously sweaty and cold. Hell, I thought I was suffering a stroke. A heart attack, perhaps. Then I recognized what I was hearing. It was that damned devil-worshiping group from England: Black Sabbath. 

I hate Black Sabbath. Amateur musicians, at best. But my wife loved them. Saw them in concert too. Many times. (We’d had several heated quarrels about this, but ultimately, I lost every one of them.)

What the heck was happening here? Why was Black Sabbath performing in my house? And must they play so loudly? Paul, slack-jawed, steam puffing from his cauliflower ears, was scanning every inch of the living room. He even checked outside. Just in case. No one knew where the God-awful noise was coming from. Ralf went sniffing, searching for clues. When he approached my wife’s music box, he started barking at it.

“The music box!” shouted Paul, loud enough for the neighbors to hear. 

“What?” 

“The music box!”

“Speak up!”

This was getting ridiculous. Eitan pissed himself, like the big baby he was, urine dripping down his plump little leg. Charla was livid, shouting orders at the top of her lungs, but the boy couldn’t hear her over the blasted heavy metal music.

I started crying. I hate to admit this, but I was overstimulated. And tired. It was 3 am, for Christ’s sake. I should be sleeping. Hell, we all should be. Nothing good ever happens at 3 am. 

Eitan grabbed the harp-tooting angel and stuck it inside his mouth. The sound lowered ever so slightly, proving the racket was indeed coming from inside the music box. Impossible as it may be.

The kid’s mother was furious. “Gimme that, Eaty. Or else!”

The boy refused to give it up; instead, he leapt off the couch like a guitar villain and started rocking out, snot charging down his chin. All the while, the little angel kept blaring that devil’s music. 

HAS HE LOST HIS MIND?

“Drop dthe box, Eaty!” Charla kept shouting. 

The boy farted, and some of it leaked out. (A shart, I’d later learn.) I could’ve killed him right then and there. Amidst the chaos, Eitan threw the figurine against the bookshelf. It knocked over some books, and teetered vicariously over the edge. 

IS HE ALIVE OR DEAD?

Everyone held their breath. The bookshelf was about to crash.

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

The teetering blue angel tumbled. 

NOW HE HAS HIS REVENGE

Down came the entire bookshelf, the angel toppled by a Holy Bible. Everyone gasped. Ralf, the cowardly ol’ pooch, disappeared into my bedroom, whimpering. We stood transfixed, reveling in the resounding silence. A platoon of hardcovers, mostly Harry Bosch, carpeted the living room floor. The lamp was broken, the light bulb shattered. None of that mattered. What mattered most was the bulky, black Bible. It belonged to my wife’s grandfather, who brought it over from Sicily, way back when. I was warned never to harm it.   

The leatherbound bible boasted a creepy golden cross. Surrounding it, heavenly words I didn’t understand. Something about Christ being the King. The bible was from the Gothic era, so it looked creepy. It weighed as much as Eitan, I’d wager.

All eyes were on me. Nobody knew what to do. Hell, I didn’t know what to do either. Truth be told, I was terrified. If I thought too deeply about this, I’d go bat-shit bonkers. So, instead of standing around like an idiot, I joined ol’ quivering Ralf on my bed, leaving Paul and his wife and their sulky boy to deal with it. 

Next came nightmares. While sleeping, I was assaulted by never-ending heavy metal music. Namely, Black Sabbath. Every damned song in their catalogue, as far as I could tell. Although they all sound the same. I couldn’t wake up soon enough.

They must’ve cleaned up the mess, because when I awoke, the books were in their rightful spot on the shelf, a bright new bulb lit the lamp. The Holy Bible was returned to its rightful spot on the bookshelf. Everything was hunky-dory. Except for one thing.

“Where’s the music box?”

Charla, looking twelve years older than she did the previous day, shot Paul a look. Paul gulped. They were sitting at the kitchen table, fully-dressed, sipping freshly-brewed coffee, wearing worried-sick faces. While waiting for a response, I poured myself a mug, praying last night was an elaborate hoax. Maybe they’d drugged me. Wouldn’t put it past them. 

“Um, Pop,” Paul stuttered. “The music boxes were a nice gesture…” Charla’s eyes never leaving his, “but...” Tomato-faced, he returned the gift.

I was stunned. “If you don’t want the damned thing, just say so!”  

Paul nodded. Charla squeezed his arm, then adjusted her glasses, which were too large for her thinly freckled face. 

“But…” pouted Eithen. “I want it!” 

I noticed he was wearing an Iron Man tee, which was covered in chocolate. Or at least, I hoped it was chocolate. Glued to his filthy little fingers was my wife’s music box. He pressed play. Then he farted. Overwhelmed by the abominable odour, the twirling blue angel sang. Oh, what a wonderful world indeed.  

Charla’s face matched Paul’s. What a bunch of nincompoops. After the most awkward breakfast in the history of the world, they decided to keep their gift, which was still in its box. Eitan wanted to reassemble it. The kid may be a jackass, but at least he was curious. 

After they left, I spent the day trying to figure out the new TV. Yeah, call me a stereotype-old-gaffer (which I am), but I couldn’t get the stupid thing to cooperate. Finally, after hours of mucking about, and several YouTube tutorials later, I got the stupid thing to work. I was set to retire for the night, when the phone buzzed. My sisters were calling. It was a group chat, which they’d never done. I didn’t like it. Figured someone must’ve died. 

“Hello?”

After an uncomfortable silence, Maybelle spoke up. 

“Um, Randy,” she coughed. “How are things?”

“Get to the point, May. I’m in bed.”

More coughing. I could hear a woman’s voice in the background. The voice didn’t sound pleasant. 

“That music box…” 

More muffled chatter. 

Melanie, the oldest, interrupted. “It’s possessed!”

Silence. 

“There,” her voice lowered, “I said it.”

I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, and once I started, I couldn’t stop. Even Ralph joined up, barking up a storm.

“Randy,” now Maybelle, “We’re serious.” 

“Unless,” back to Mel, “you triggered them to play Black FUCKING Sabbath, full volume.”

“Even when they’re shut off…”

“In the middle of the night!”

A chill dripped down my spine. I dropped the phone. What in blue-blazes were they gabbing about? Possessed? Black Sabbath? Then I remembered. It’s funny how the mind works. It tricks you. By dinner time, I’d forgotten about the mayhem from the previous night.  

“Hello?” Maybelle speaking, “Anybody home?”

“You two are off your rockers!”

I hung up. They could destroy the damned things for all I cared. I put my heart and soul into assembling those music boxes. Now this? I put my phone on silent and went to bed. Good riddance. 

…

BOOM BOOM BOOM.

I snapped awake. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

“What the?”

Ralf was trembling, his puppy-dog eyes all droopy. He stood up, shaking, then half-hid under the bed.   

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The Noise. Loud as a 747, rude and mean and raucous. This can’t be happening. I’m dreaming. Must be. 

I AM IRON MAN.

My blood turned icy cold, the hairs standing tall on my arms. My testicles disappeared. As the electric guitar soared, seventy-seven years of pent-up rage came coursing through my veins. I leapt out of bed, tripped over Ralf, and fell face-first. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The music was FULL VOLUME. Everywhere at once. I hated it. I stood up (slowly this time), and pinched myself. This is real, I reminded myself. As crazy as it may be.  

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

I checked the time: 3:33 am. Somehow, this made it worse. Like a war-weathered tank, I barged into the living room, fists clenched, ready for battle. 

“Where’s the wretched box?”

My voice was drowned out by the noise. Something caught my attention. My wife, in the prime of her youth, regarding me via her framed high school picture. In it, she’s wearing a Black Sabbath tee, smiling mischievously. Taunting me. 

I turned and stubbed my toe. Damn, it hurt. Cursing my existence, I stole another glance at my wife. She’s probably having herself a good chuckle. Heck, she probably knows all the words. I was livid. I’m surprised the police aren’t banging on the door, the noise was THAT loud.

NOBODY WANTS HIM. 

Where's the damned music box? Frantic, I scanned the living room. AHA! The bottom shelf. How in blue blazes did it get down there? And who repaired it? I knelt down and inspected it. The cracks it suffered were gone; it looked brand new. Still, something about the angel seemed wrong. Mostly, her eyes. They were callous and cold, impossibly red. The rest of her seemed fine. Heavenly pink heart-shaped wings cradling her Tiffany-blue body, tin whistle tucked between her ashen lips. But those eyes... 

PLANNING HIS VENGEANCE.

My heart, rickety as a wooden roller coaster, nearly exploded. I raced to the garage, sweating and shivering at the same time; and after a panicky search, I found my hammer. 

VENGEANCE FROM HIS GRAVE.

The blue angel tooted its whistle, fiery red eyes never leaving mine. 

KILL THE PEOPLE HE ONCE SAVED.

I swung the hammer. 

The angel exploded. 

And the music stopped. 

So did my heart. 

…

As the week passed, my health steadily improved. But not a day went by when I didn’t think about the damned music box; the cursed blue angel, who died not once, but twice. I thought about that dreadful band from Britain. And, of course, I thought about my wife.  

…

This morning, a package arrived. I wasn’t expecting anything. But then again, tis the season, right? The box was decently heavy and marked FRAGILE. When I opened the package, I gasped. 

The ballerinas. 

Not one, but all three. My good-for-nothing sisters sent them back to me! Not surprisingly, I suppose, since I’d been ignoring their texts and emails. Not just from them, but from Luke and his wife. Like I needed more stress. 

Disgruntled, I found a place for the ballerinas on the bookshelf. I wound up the little ballerinas, just in case, checking to see if they were jinxed. Carol of the Bells percolated from the tiny dancers as they twirled. Phew! Relief came instantaneously. 

After dinner, I retreated to the living room for some quality TV time before bed. I must’ve fallen asleep on the sofa, because around 3 am, I snapped awake. My heart sped up. Then it stopped. Then it started up again, twice as fast. I groaned. This can’t be happening. Please God. Not again.

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR.
