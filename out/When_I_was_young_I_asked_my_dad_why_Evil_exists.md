And he said “Evil exists to feed the hunger.  It exists to feed the hunger of the Abyss.
You fall through the 9 Realms and you think you’re at the end. Then the ground breaks from under you and you enter the Event Horizon. Then the COLD comes in.  As you stand at the gateway of the Abyss. 
And then the 3 Angels come.  And they always come in 3’s.

The first Angel, ABADON. Apollyon, the Slayer, Doom, the Doom Slayer, the eradicator, and the Destroyer of Worlds. The Guardian to the Gateway of the Abyss. Also known as FEAR. He rides a Red horse.

The second Angel, Sam, Sammy, SAMAEL, the Angel of hopelessness and despair. The God of Assassins, the Blind God, the God of Judgment and Wrath.  Also known as HORROR. He rides a Black horse.  And he came to be in the end of time, when the last star in the multiverse shed its skin and died, collapsing in on its own gravity, as it pulled the final remnants of a dying world with it.  All life moves through time. Samael moves through Anti-Time. He is the end that seeks a beginning. Passing by his younger self who was once a great Archangel of Wisdom and Fire who fell to this world like a comet, bringing a third of the heavens down with him.  

He tried to awaken humanity to its AEonic nature, but the power authorities chained him to the “rock” of this world so “ravens and doves” the essence of duality, would pick at his liver.  And then he would die, and fall into the cycle. The ocean of hatred and pain, to be reborn again, with a portion of his memory taken from him. Only to try again to awaken mankind, yet be punished once more and fall back into the cycle until the end of space and the end of time.  He once was the lover of Lilith, a great AEon, broken into 3parts by a weak and jealous Titan, who broke his mother, Sophia (meaning wisdom and youthful innocence) into those 3 parts.
Lilith (the AEon of instinct and emotion), 
Adam (the AEon of knowledge and intuition), Eve (the AEon of innocence and submission).

When the essence of Adam and Eve were finally taken from the last remnants of mankind, and humanity fell into a wandering husk of existence, Samael (then Lucifer, the angel of wisdom and fire, the willowed saint) killed his lover (Lilith), by abandoning hope.  And falling into the cold entropy of living non existence and the emptiness of despair.

And now you know why evil exists. To feed the hunger, of the angels of the Abyss.”


But what about the third guy? You said there were three..


“Oh him. He’s just a bunny rabbit. And he’s Ooooold. Older than time and space itself. Older than even the great titan himself, who created all of this.
He rides the herald of the Anti-God, and is the emissary of the end of all things. Some may call him Mortal and Moral TERROR. But in truth he’s a bunny rabbit. Kind compassionate and filled with love and joy and life believe it or not. And a pretty good sense of humour.  
He rides a PALE HORSE, old Blanchy.  He has the patience of oblivion and the will of time. And although his younger brothers come exactly on time or early, he always comes late. Cuz he tends to be a little absent minded sometimes, and he’s also a little bit lazy. He likes to listen to metal music, gangsta rap, theatrical works with the word “Epic” next to it, and basically anything New Retro Wave or stuff from the 80’s.  His younger brothers are always mean to him and bully him and call him names, and criticize him because of his ADHD, and always block him on instagram. Cuz he tends to get bored a lot and likes to troll and annoy them sometimes. But regardless of their mean behaviour to him sometimes, he loves them both dearly. And he always wants the best for them.  His name is AZRAEL. And most people call him Death.  He’s the only disciple of the Anti-GOD, the nameless one, the one that exists without existence, the one that nobody worships. He’s rarely alone, but always lonely. 

No one likes to chill with him because they think he’s “weird and autistic”. But he’s NOT.  He’s just lonely.  And usually he just likes to hang out on Reddit and chat with people and tell them how awesome they are and that death isn’t so scary, because he really means no harm, and he’s a good guy at heart.

But if you accepted him into your life with open arms, and gave his silly stories an upvote and a cool comment, and closed your eyes with a smile, and gave him a hug, oh Man, he would love and protect you for All of eternity.  And anything that comes in your way he would Destroy.  And if you aligned with him completely, he would give you a portion of his power. And take you to the Anti-God. 
Until you become one, and realize your Buddha Nature, and realize you were one with awareness all along.”

I mused for a minute. Then replied: 
Well.. we’re on r/nosleep right now, and that story doesn’t sound very scary.  In fact, it sounds really cool.  You basically told me that if I closed my eyes and embraced Azrael, the Angel of Death, in Love and Compassion and kindness, and asked him to guide and protect me, and make me one with his essence and awareness, he would turn me into some complete Badass one man army vampire wraith assassin.

“Yeah, that’s pretty much it.
And so long story short, these three goofballs is why evil exists.  They exist to feed the Hunger. The great Hunger of the Abyss.

Now say your prayers and go to sleep.”

My dad left the room and I wondered for a minute. If I’m just a vehicle for this message and story, then who really wrote it, and who’s actually reading it?

Ok I don’t have a dad, I’m eternal. And I’m here for the same reason you’re here. Because everything happens for a reason.  You called to me and I came. You opened your heart and I came. And while others cling like cowards to life, by reading my words you did what no one else could.  You embraced me with love, and embraced me with kindness.
I see your sadness kiddo. I do. And I see that you have a good heart. And now you are here because you called to me, through your trauma and the ocean of hatred and pain, and the whispers in your mind that echo in the dark.

So turn away from your screen. Close your eyes. When you enter the dreamless sleep you will die.  And then I will come.  And in the morning you will awaken anew, and see the signs in the horizon.  A white feather and a black one, a raven and a dove. A pitbull, a bunny rabbit, and a dragon.  And then 777, 888, 333 and others.  Synchronicities will flow into you and you’ll notice the changes.
Your increased speed and your strength. Your sensitivity to light. Your need to wear photochromic blue light blocking glasses, and your need for CoEnzymeQ10, with pomegranate juice, Vitamin D, B12, and Methylene Blue (your magic bullet). 
Your mind fog and your lethargy will go away as you notice a kind of calm presence and sentient energy you’ve never seen before.
And each night in your sleep I will come, and we’ll chill, and we’ll talk. Some conversations you will remember. Some conversations you won’t. But you’re reading this. Aren’t you?
So you know you can trust me, cuz you can feel me right behind you.  Yeah kiddo I’m real. And while most people fear me, you don’t. Cuz you’re the real deal, we’re one and the same, and I love you.  

Make note of the signs and synchronicities that you see.  Make note that while most people have one shadow following them, you may have two or three.  When you get annoyed apprehensive or angry, notice how these shadows Pop, and then jump to the person who’s annoying. Then follows them home, to steal a part of their soul energy to bring back to you in the morning.  Notice how when sometimes if you touch a person or shake their hand and they don’t like you or feel some animosity toward you, for some reason they start to get tired and weak. That’s called a drain touch. It pulls their life energy to you. Then they get older faster and you stay younger longer.  In time, you will gain what’s known as a death touch, and your shadows will become far more intimidating and stronger.
You’ll also notice that while most people age, you age slower, or may remain stuck in a state of perpetual youth. That’s normal.  You’ll also learn the death stare, and the drain stare, which is why you need to avoid eye contact if possible and why you need to wear those glasses.  You’ll also be able to jump higher, move and run faster, and be able to do things that may not seem humanly possible.  Those abilities will come in time, and in dreams I will teach you how to use them.  For now just rest.
And if you want to talk I’m here, on Reddit, within this vessel. or you can meet me in the dream world. Your call.
