Almost as soon as his footprint was left in the snow, it was filled in by the heavy flutter of more snow. It was as if the universe was showing Joel that just as soon as he had made any mark on this earth, he could just as soon be erased from ever existing. How futile our lives really are. It was a rather cruel thought as the whiteness of the snow symbolized to him just how pure it was. Untainted by pollution or his fellow man. He had always loved the snow when indoors with a mug of hot chocolate sitting across from a fire. It reminded him of home. 

The only sound louder than the violent howl of the wind was his thumping heartbeat. Joel could not remember the last time he had done any physical activity, let alone run like his life depended on it. Except in this case, his life really did depend on it. With each step his heart seemed to beat louder in protest, but Joel could not stop. Not even for a second to catch his breath. If he stopped, IT would get him. He thought of his daughter and wife back home. Waiting for him to return from his research mission. He HAD to get home to them. He grimaced as he felt a stabbing pain in his chest, heart feeling as if it was going to explode. But he pushed on. One foot in front of the other. He had to keep moving. He had no other choice. 

He had managed to keep a slight edge on it as he stumbled as quickly as he could across the vast white nothingness. He hadn’t managed to get a good look at it, but he knew it meant him harm. He hadn’t needed to see it, the fact it was able to force its way into the facility was testament enough that it was a formidable creature. Peter had also told him when he first arrived about the spectacle that was left when his previous colleague had been killed, and this drove home the fact that he was not very likely at all to survive this encounter. At the very best he would at least be able to be identified post mortem. 

As he ran, Joel cast quick glances over his shoulder, checking for the monster but also to see how far away from the lab he had gotten. He couldn’t but help wonder if Peter had escaped too, or IT had painted the spotless white lab with his scarlet life source. The tiny beam of the flashlight bounced steadily as Joel ran, short puffs of mist escaped his mouth as he huffed for breath. He knew he didn’t have much more left in him. He was going to have to stop and face IT. Maybe he could fight it. He had read stories of the unimaginable strength granted to people in danger by the influx of adrenaline. He figured with the adrenaline flowing through him coupled with his need to get home to his family, he could maybe stand a chance. 

There was nothing around for miles for him to hide behind or in - the only structure being the laboratory he had hurriedly left once Peter had seen the creature and warned Joel to run. Peter himself had barely survived an encounter with the monster shortly before Joel had been stationed at this outpost laboratory to help assist Peter once his previous partner had met his unfortunate end. There was mystery surrounding his death, but such were the risks when your team is in the middle of nowhere to investigate undocumented creatures in Antartica. 

Joel hadn’t particularly wanted to be moved from his comfortable desk job in a lab in Maine, but the financial enticement proved too much to turn down. His daughter was growing up, and soon enough he would need to pay for her College and University fees. It would also very soon be his 10th wedding anniversary, and he wanted to get his wife something nice. 
Now, he wondered if he would ever get to enjoy his money or the very creature he was recruited to study would ensure he turned out like his predecessor. Just another faceless casualty in the cause of trying to research a dangerous creature that humans really had no business looking into. 

As the lights of the laboratory appeared further and further, Joel’s pace dropped drastically. This was it. Time to face the music. Hopefully it would be a quick death if he was unable to fight it off. He looked around for a rock or big stick he could use to arm himself - to no avail. Or maybe, just MAYBE, the creature had grown tired of the chase and returned to where it came from. He hadn’t heard it snarl or crunch the snow behind him - but then again he couldn’t hear anything over the deafening sound of his struggling heart. Well, either way he couldn’t run any more. Joel slowed his pace completely, coming to a stop in the pure white abyss. The thought of his daughter once again crossed his mind. She would love this amount of snow. Imagine the snowmen she could build. 

The wind whipped his coat about as he stood exposed in the wind. The cold was like nothing he had ever experienced before in this moment. The adrenaline had numbed him all this time, but it had since worn off. The cold had returned with a vengeance, biting sharply at his exposed face. He glanced around in the darkness, shaking violently with fear and cold. His insufficient beam of light casting a glow on the smallest possible area of the snow, barely enough to see anything. It moved with such speed that Joel didn’t have time to train his light on whatever it was that moved at him, knocking him backwards onto the cold, hard ground. 

………………….

Joel felt a strange warm, quickly followed by a horrific feeling of cold. He slowly realized he had wet himself - the urine warming him up for the briefest moment before plunging him back into the cold. He moved his head around and could not see much. There was a fire a small distance away which cast a little bit of light - not nearly enough to show Joel wherever he was. From what he could tell, he seemed to be in a cave. Clearly he was far away from the laboratory. He thought about Peter, and hoped Peter was out in the cold looking for him. Hoping Peter had left what they thought was a safe space, clean and warm - to come and rescue him. 

His thoughts of Peter and the warmth of the laboratory were cut short when he tried to stand up and a sharp hot pain ran through both his legs. Joel stifled a cry and lowered his hands to touch his legs to try and assess what the issue was. His numb hands were met with a wet warmth. Unable to see the liquid, Joel decided to raise his hand and see if there was a small accompanying the wet. It was blood. Joel gently touched his legs and felt incisions running from his heel all the way up his calves. The beast had virtually paralyzed him so he could not leave its den. 

Joel felt tears building up in his eyes as he realized the severity of his situation. He could not see and he could not walk. He was at the mercy of whatever had done this to him. Joel had never been devoutly religious, but in his ever growing state of fear, he found himself calling on God. He had been raised Christian and remembered that no matter how far you had strayed from God, you could call on him in your time of need. 
And had there ever been a more desperate time of need than now? Definitely not. As he muttered the words of The Lord’s Prayer, Joel heard a rustle behind him as whatever had brought him here began to move towards him. Fear turned to anguish as Joel felt an incredible pressure on his cheek followed by an intense heat as his skin parted, something tearing through his flesh. Going deeper and deeper, allowing the hot red liquid within to warm his cold face. 

The cave looked like the set of an old school slasher film. Strips of skin were thrown in an almost nonchalant way all over the floors, as one would when scattering confetti in a room for a celebration. Blood seemed to cover every inch of visible space, dripping from the ceiling to the floor - soaking the ground in the very essence of what had once coursed through the veins of Joel. A more accurate description would be that it looked as though Joel had been fed through a gigantic shredding machine - completely tearing him apart and demolishing every part of him. Not a single morsel of the scientist had been eaten, his intestines and other innards strewn about to further decorate the place that would now be his final resting place.  The beast that did this seemed to take delight in simply tearing the poor man apart. His clothes lay in a pile, still occupied by bits of flesh and bone - completely drenched in blood and body fluids. The creature walked towards where Joel’s decapitated head lay, mouth agape in an eternal scream. Eyes bloodshot and protruding. It laughed, finally speaking. All it said was one sentence to mess that was once Joel. 
“I told you to run”. 

………………..

The emergency services picked up the call on the first ring. They had to tell the gentleman on the line to calm down numerous times before he finally listened. He was frantic and sounded scared, talking about a research facility about 100 miles out from the main camp which was home to the services currently on the line with him. 

“Sir, please slow down and tell us what happened. We can’t help you if we don’t know what’s wrong.” 

“My colleague. He’s missing. We’re based at the Lowkin Institute of Research Facility. We were attacked by something last night. I can’t find him. Please, it’s happened again. We need help right away. Hurry please!” Peter screamed into the phone. 

………………….

Placing the phone down, Peter walked calmly to his bench. He picked up the vial with the colourless liquid he had poured into Joel’s coffee the night before. A potent blend of lysergic acid diethylamide and dextromethorphan. It was his second test run using it, the first time it hadn’t worked nearly as well. This time around, he was certain Joel had envisioned some sort of terrifying monster while Peter chased him around in the snow. That fear and confusion is what made this all the more fun. Peter thought about how quickly the drug had affected Peter. 

He had barely finished his own cup of tea before he noticed Joel glancing nervously at the door, behind which he had placed a bluetooth speaker which he would play banging sounds once he was sure the drugs had fully kicked in. This would help the hallucinations along nicely. His first attempt was not quite a failure, but did not work as well as this time. He ended up beating his colleague to incapacitate him, followed up by a grotesque mimicry of a lion attack on a baby animal. The blood that day had been the first time Peter had ever seen that much. It had excited him somewhat. 

Hopefully the organization would send another scientist quickly so Peters “research” could continue. He knew it was only a matter of time until he had to stop. But until that time, he would continue to enjoy being both a literal and figurative monster. The look of terror in his colleagues eyes as they envisioned him as a monster was priceless. The blood and screams was merely a bonus.
