Behind Nikola was the only way back up.
As i was the one building the joint the other two where on the phones playing a game and talking, that resulted in light beeing cast on the walls.

Something caught my attention in the back left corner of the entrance as i looked up to finish the joint.
Something black, just a short glimpse but enough to give me a feeling of unease, as if somebosy peeked in through the doorway and bobbed right back behind the corner, like a kid not wanting to be caught.
I had a feeling, like the feeling that the blackness of the darkness and the blackness of the thing that caught my attention was somehow different, somehow more contured than just pure night shadows.

I said to Ellis" did you see that"? and he denied.
So of course Nikola, paranoid as he was asked me what i saw and where it was..
He said we should just rather go up and smoke and go home afterwards anyway.

We started to shift into an uneasy mood getting paranoid i turned on my flashlight on the phone and shined around the room.

Nothing.

But again something caught my attention, and this time we all saw it.
It was the blink of a second as we saw a dark shape the form of a head bob out behind the corner and  quickly bob back.
We thought it might be a hallucination for a second but not even 3 seconds into that thought it bobbed right back out this time only about 3 feet above the floor instead of chest high, peeking through the doorway, seemingly losing it's caution of us by the second.

I screamed for everybody to get the fuck out of here
 and as the only way was straight through that doorway we ran not caring about anything only getting out of there 

I was running for my life in that moment, surprisingly Ellis right behind me and Nikola last.
As i ran past the doorway i felt cold, very cold but only for a short second, running straight and to the left up the stairway i looked back and saw Nikola running through the doorway.

The moment he  came out of the room i saw a shadow merge with him.. i cant explain how or what, this is the closest i can get to explaining:
 something jumped into him.

Not really thinking much about it we keep running up the stairs.
I rolled the door up as fast as i could 
let Ellis roll under it and he held it open with his back long enough for me to get out,
turn and see Nikola crawling out under the door too.


We let the door fall with a BANG, not even thinking about putting jackets over the barb wire we climbed it 
cutting our hands pretty badly, not even feeling pain due to the adrenalin.

We ran all the way to the street we lived on and didnt look back not once.

As we got to the houses we where laughing and joking about how stupid that was but deep in my body i felt dread still.

I said goodnight and went home to sleep.
We stayed friends and forgot about what happened that night pretty quick thinking about other important stuff.

But as i look back alot changed after that night.

Nikolas parents broke up, he started taking hard drugs in the coming months and consuming all kinds of shit.

Still he was my friend we hung out alot still way beyond the event untill one night in february 2016.

3 years after what we saw in the basement of the abandoned store we where once again at our spot by the school house a couple friends me , Nikola and Ellis.

Somebody came up with the idea of taking some LSD because it was a boring evening so 4 of us said yes including me and Nikola.

Ellis did not take anything and went home later.

What happened that night chills me to the bone still today.

As you know LSD makes you feel and experience stuff alot more vivid.
You can imagine how this burned into my mind.

It all started off normal, we took our trips hung around smoking some dope for about 40 minutes or so and started to get high, at first it was funny and everything we walked around alot looking at shit even our hands..

Somewhen we started filming ourselfs and just like goof around with our shadows, and everytime i would like show Nikola my hand in the light he would have this demonic laugh.
Really loud and long and like i dont even know just demonic.

While i was high it started to freak me out his eyes started to sink in and look dark around the edges.

All in all ot was still a cool experience and my horror trip went away later on again.
Even though Nikola started talking about weird shit like "Stefan looks like walking death" (stefan was another friend of us)
Or " bro do you know i cant sleep some nights because my room feels dark"? 
Or " bro i cant feel my soul no more". 


We thought he was just high but as we where coming down off of the trip on that damp cold morning sitting on the bench at that school 
Me Nikola and two other dudes started looking at the videos we filmed that night while high.

In one video you can see Nikola standing next to the school doing some kind of dancemoves with his hands laughing his laugh 

And very close behind him,
peeking out behind the corner of the school was the dark faceless head before bobbing back behind the wall quickly like a playing child.


( i freaked out completely, ran all the way home) 

( we stopped hanging together )

(Yes i watched the video again and it was real, my friends that i sent it to saw it too)

We don't have contact anymore and the last i heard Nikola is a junky now..

I think that thing took his soul and is slowly eating away on it.. 

what do you think?
