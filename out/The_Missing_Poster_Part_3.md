As I read the words, they echoed in my mind.
She is perfect.

The handwriting was neat. Careful, almost gentle. That made it worse.
I kept staring until the letters blurred together. Each time I blinked, I saw the flash of the camera again, white and violent behind my eyes.

My sister was still asleep in the other bed, face pressed into the hotel pillow. I didn’t want to wake her. I just needed air. I know I wouldn’t be able to sleep.

The sun was barely up when I found myself back at the coffee shop. Habit dragged me there before reason could stop me. I needed fuel. I couldn’t rest and needed some sort of pick me up.

The bell above the door chimed the same way it always did. Same stale smell of beans and sugar. Same barista behind the counter. Mark, I think. The guy who always remembered my order, asked about my day, laughed at the dumb jokes I made. It was nice to see a friendly face. 

“Rough night?” he said, smiling. “Haven’t seen you this early in a while.”

I forced a grin, slid a few crumpled bills across the counter. “Yeah. Something like that.”

He wrote my name on the cup, like always. The pen scraped lightly against the cardboard. The sound piercing my ears as if I was hungover from emotions.

As he made his way over to the counter to hand me my coffee he slid the money back to me. 

“This one is on the house. Hopefully a nice start to a perfect day.”

That word. That god damn word. 

“She is PERFECT.” Those 3 words ringing in my head again.

I let out an uncomfortable laugh as I said “Thanks, man.”

He slid the coffee over to me. My name on the cup in red marker. 

The handwriting, it looked familiar. I had seen this before. Was I just being delusional? I’m not sure. But I FELT like I had seen it before.

“She misses you, you know.”

I slowly began to look up.

“What?”

“Your niece, I’m sure she misses you.”

What was happening? The news, he must have seen it on the news. The case was getting a lot of coverage over the last 24 hours. 


“Yeah,” I said, clearing my throat. “It’s… it’s been rough on everyone.”

Mark nodded, still smiling that same easy smile. But something about his eyes didn’t match. They were focused, like he was studying me.

“She came in here with you that one time.” He said softly. “Hot chocolate, extra whipped cream. Cute kid.”

My stomach tightened.

“You remember that?”

“Of course. I remember everyone who walks through that door.”

“Listen, I should…”

“You left this here last time.”

Mark reached under the counter and slid a small paper sleeve toward me. A corner of glossy paper peeked out.

My chest tightened. I pulled it free just enough to see the image and everything inside me went still.

It was my niece’s school photo. The same one that hung on my sister’s fridge. The same one I kept in my wallet, behind my badge.

“Where did you get this?”

Mark smiled, kind and unbothered, like we were talking about the weather. “Your sister should really lock her windows.”

The coffee shop noise seemed to fade, replaced by a dull ringing in my ears. My hand drifted instinctively toward my holster.

“Don’t” he said quietly. “If you pull that thing out, you’ll never see her again.”

My throat went dry.

“Where is she?” I managed.

He leaned forward, elbows on the counter. His voice softened, almost pitying.
“You told me all about her. Her name. Her school. The way she scrunches her nose when she laughs. You even showed me this picture yourself.”

I tried to remember. I didn’t want to believe it but I could hear myself doing it. Talking too much over coffee. Filling silence with small talk.

He slid the photo closer. My name was written on the back in red ink.

“She’s perfect” he whispered. “Just like you said.”

The bell over the door chimed behind me. Someone came in for their morning latte. I blinked and the photo was gone. Just my cup of coffee, cooling on the counter.

I looked to Mark. 
 

“If you don’t want her to end up like the others,” he said, barely above a whisper, “you’ll listen to exactly what I say.”

He didn’t blink. He didn’t raise his voice. He just stood there, calm, like we were still two regulars talking about the weather.

My pulse was hammering so hard I thought everyone in the shop could hear it.
“What did you do to her?”

Mark tilted his head slightly, almost disappointed.

“That’s not the question you should be asking.”

A woman behind me laughed at something on her phone. The milk steamer hissed. Life went on, like the world didn’t notice what was happening right in front of them.

“You’re going to go home” he continued. “You’re going to act normal. You’re not going to tell anyone about this conversation. Not your sister, not your detective friends. You’ll hear from me when it’s time. If you do anything stupid, she’ll end up like the others.”

He said it so simply, like it wasn’t a threat just a fact.

I stared at him, waiting for a tremor, a flinch, something. But he just smiled that same polite smile he gave every customer.

“Have a good day, Officer.”

He turned toward the next person in line.
And just like that, I wasn’t a customer anymore. I was a hostage.

I walked out before he could say anything else. The bell over the door chimed behind me, the same cheerful sound I’d heard a hundred times before, but it felt different now, hollow, mocking.

The air outside hit cold against my face. Morning rush hour had started and people were crossing the street with their coffees, laughing, living in a world that hadn’t been flipped upside down.

Mine had.

I stood there on the sidewalk, gripping the cup he’d handed me. The cardboard was warm against my skin, but my hands were shaking. I kept telling myself to breathe, to think, to do something. Call the precinct. Call anyone.

But his words kept replaying in my head.

“You’ll listen to exactly what I say.”

It wasn’t the threat that scared me, it was the certainty. He said it like he’d already won.
