"Oh MY GOD"! I shrieked in the most obnoxious tone imaginable.

The Security guard was taken aback; not even 10 minutes ago, he was enjoying a nice cup of tea when he was called in to deal with an "issue". Too bad he didn't know the issue was me.

"This "Kid" Is NOT Blind"! I tell the security guard while excessively pointing and making hand gestures at the hell-spawn that was currently on the ground, after I had pushed him.

"Ma'am, this is a kid who obviously is blind, they are wearing glasses-" The guard went to object but I was too quick for him to de-escalate the situation.

"No, Glasses don't make you "Blind", I could put on glasses RIGHT NOW and would I be "Blind""!? I Objected.

"I'm sorry but you're gonna need to leave" Another guard piped up while I was too busy yelling at the first guard.

"If I leave, you need to take that THING with you"! I yelled and made a grab for the supposed "Blind kid".

The Guards tugged at me, despite my morbid-obesity, they somehow were managing to actually bring me away from the demon.

"NOOOOOOO"!! I wailed. "You are going to get everyone here KILLED"!! I screeched at the top of my lungs to bring everyone's attention to me.

"Is that a threat"?! One Of the guards asked, clearly annoyed at me.

At this point, everyone nearby was looking at me as if I was insane, and it didn't help that I had a lot to drink last night.

"Get outta here Karen"! Some idiotic jock shouted from a couple feet away, most likely acting tough because he felt entitled to such.

"Use your Strength for something Actually USEFUL and get that HELL-SPAWN out of here instead of lifting weights to increase your infinite EGO"!!! I screamed in fury.

The Jock was taken aback by such an unhinged response and the guards decided to double down on their efforts; there were now 5 of them, pushing me away from the demon clearly standing in front of me.

The exit was getting ever so close and I knew I didn't have much time.

I pushed through the guards and grabbed the kid and with one meaty fist, I unleashed pure hell on the wretched demon-

The salt dropped out of my hand as a guard tackled me. I had Failed.

I screamed and screamed and screamed. I grabbed and pushed and punched but it was futile, they had won.

I Was dragged forcefully out of the mall and handed to the police.

I stared at the kid and to my surprise, the kid looked at me with a smirk and I watched as small red tendrils erupted from his body and started clinging to the walls and growing outward... but nobody reacted. Was this just a taunt? Or was I hallucinating again... No, I couldn't have made a fool of myself because of me being drunk, right?

I laughed as the cops put me in the back of their car and we began to speed off...

I glanced back out the window to amuse myself, thinking now that I had just done the stupidest thing possible. Honestly, why would I trust my own assumptions- I was clearly drunk... right?

As I glanced at the mall, I rubbed my eyes and my heart dropped... The mall suddenly disappeared and it was replaced with some kind of fake varient.

I turned back to the cops and tried to tell them but as I turned, I was greeted with 2 demonic faces staring back, laughing at my reaction.

Suddenly, Everything outside turned a dark shade of red and I realized we were entering the Underworld.

I quickly used my phone to type this out as the underworld glowed brighter and brighter, demons faces poking out of the shadows and laughing at me as I was led towards some kind of dungeon. Thank god the internet still exists but as I entered the dungeon, I saw people in front of me having their phones taken away.

With immense haste, while the demons weren't staring at me, I quickly shoved my phone in my purse.

Demons are stupid anyway, they won't bother actually looking for stuff since they expect everything handed to them, such idiots.

The searching went smoothly and I now found myself in the most HORRENDOUS room possible- A shabby hotel room that doesn't even have gold plating on the windows- which are blocked out by stupid metal pieces.

I thought back at that stupid kid from before and I realized;

I was right after all...
