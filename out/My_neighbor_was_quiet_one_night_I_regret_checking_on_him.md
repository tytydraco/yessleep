I don’t know when or even if this will ever be posted, let alone read, but my therapist says I have to get this out of my system in some way and journaling has always helped. I hope that maybe someone can learn from the signs that I neglected.

 I’d lived there for four years. A shabby apartment complex, the type with questionable stains in inexplicable places, funky smells that lacked a source, and maddening dripping that couldn’t be resolved. Regardless, rent was cheap and considering my situation it was a more than ample home. Far superior when compared to abandoned compounds in combat zones and the gaunt tents Uncle Sam offered us. While my time in Afghanistan left me with frequent night terrors and nervous breakdowns, events my neighbors had unfortunately become accustomed to, it ultimately led to me adopting Buddy, my slinky, ginger, therapist-recommended friend. Buddy saved my life, just taking care of him superseded my nasty drinking habits and less flowery vices. He really helped me stay on the straight and narrow for the most part.

 The gentle hum of my fridge and aggressive static of my relic of a TV was often interrupted by my neighbor across the hall, Frank. Frank served in Vietnam but lacked a Buddy to help him cope, with his whiskey-fueled ramblings and ravings piercing through the pale drywall that separated us. Asking him to keep the noise down was futile, often being met with dribbles and mutters, followed by a dismissive ‘fuck off’. Eventually I gave up, accepting his ruckus as white noise. Nevertheless, he was capable of kindness. I even trusted him with my spare key to feed Buddy while I was out, though that trust was never mutual. He’d often warn me if our landlord was in an unsavory mood or if anyone he deemed ‘suspicious’ entered the building. I like to think our shared service bred mutual respect.

 Getting used to his midnight antics made me notice silence for the first time since I had moved in. In hindsight I should’ve investigated sooner.

 While most would accept this as a victory, I knew it was too good to accept. What if Frank finally drank himself to death? What if he had fallen over and needed help? The next morning, I knocked on his door, expecting no answer but just hearing a groan or stumble would satisfy my concern. I stood in that hall waiting for a while, my gaze taking in the depressing wooden flooring and flickering lights. Frank and I were the only tenants on the first floor, maybe our isolation from the rest of the building fueled the companionship I felt towards him, subsequently fueling my next bangs on his door. Eventually I did hear something from behind his door. Not a groan or a stumble. Scuttling almost, like you ran on-the-spot as quickly as you could. The door swung open, restrained by the door chain. Frank pressed his face up to the opening, like a child’s face against glass separating them from candy. His pupils dilated and his notably saggy cheeks appeared fuller, almost taut, with a stench of rotten fruit emanating off him.

“What do you want?” he hissed at me, bright blue eyes almost popping out of their sockets with saliva spraying me before dripping down his now slacked jaw.

“Just making sure you were all good man, you were quiet last night” I half-chuckled, taking a step back, attempting to hide my discomfort, Frank’s breathing intensifying.

“I’m fine” he snapped as he slammed the door shut.

Just hearing a full, legible sentence from Frank was out of character. While his rare use of substances did tend to make him more wired and simultaneously understandable compared to alcohol, something was off. I was more off put by his sickly-sweet odor, which replaced his regular aroma of whiskey and cigarettes. Buddy’s hesitant meowing snapped me out of my train of thought. Gazing back into my apartment I noticed Buddy hunched up in the furthest corner, tail tucked between his legs, eyes locked on Frank’s door.

My familiarity with Frank and our shared hatred of our landlord hindered me from complaining about his pungent stench over the following days. A stench that began to fester throughout the hall and infiltrate my apartment, creeping under my front door and bypassing Walmart’s strongest air fresheners. I suppose my frequency with burn pits desensitized my sense of smell, allowing me to tolerate whatever Frank must have left to spoil.

 Warnings of eviction piled up outside Frank’s door. I supposed he was at that age where basic errands like paying rent and taking the trash out weren’t second nature to him anymore. I remember attempting to make a note to offer him my assistance the next morning, but my notepad had gone missing, misplaced I originally thought. It was only when my TV remote, landline, and even the cat food and meal prep went missing that I knew something was wrong. I’m not the type to be forgetful or misplace things that poorly, in fact I try to pride myself on my somewhat type A personality. I told myself raccoons had to be breaking in, a thief or squatter being the worse my mind could conjure. I was adamant about refusing to give my landlord the satisfaction of saving me from what could have just been a family of raccoons. This unspoken and one-sided conflict led to me ensuring all windows and doors were locked, as well as keeping my food in the mini-fridge I kept next to my bed, with the hopes that Buddy would hunt down some vermin while I slept.

 While Buddy was a great help, night terrors still plagued me. That night I was glad I had one. Shooting out of bed, drenched in a cold sweat. Eyes so wide nothing was out of view. Ears ringing despite the deathly silence. Sweeping my apartment always cured my residual paranoia, flashlight in hand rather than my preferred Beretta M9, again recommended by my therapist and support group. My room was empty, with the contents on my mini-fridge untouched. Midway through checking every article of clothing hanging in my closet, my head spun round to focus on a rustling from the kitchen. Like chewing. Almost. The noise you’d imagine a spider makes when injecting its venom into an unsuspecting fly. I crept towards the door leading to my hallway, my steps cushioned by my mangey carpet. The humming of the fridge drowned out any remaining nightmare-induced paranoia. The warm, flickering glow of the light that hung in the hall alerted me, temporarily directing my attention to my gaping front door. Sneaking through what felt like my labyrinth of an apartment in that moment I heard Buddy wake up, the jingle of the bell on his collar followed by commotion in my kitchen. Something dashed across my hallway and out the front door. An impossible speed I justified with my tired state. Immediately I blamed the break-in on a thief, until I heard Frank’s door shut with an unforgiving gusto. My kitchen was left in ruins, drawers thrown onto the ground, files and chairs slobbered on and fridge trays lying abandoned on the ground. The offensive scent of putrescence lingered. Invading my nostrils, making me feel dirty almost. The air was sticky. An unsettling humidity had descended upon my apartment.

 I knew this was serious. My panic in the moment coupled with my concern for Frank’s wellbeing led to me immediately dialing 911. The cops took a while to arrive; there was no immediate threat. After giving my statement I retreated into my apartment, ear pressed against the front door, hoping to hear Frank’s explanation or reasoning for his actions. The interaction between the officer and Frank was worryingly brief, but I’d never heard Frank that articulate. I impulsively opened my door after hearing Frank’s shut, interrogating the officer.

“So what’d he say? Is he alright?” I spat at him, coming off more intense than I intended

“Uh yeah, he’s completely fine, if anything a little shaken up since he just got home.”

 “What? I heard his door close as soon as he left my apartment, you have that written down right?” I instinctively lunged my arm at him, trying to grab his notepad

“Sir please keep your distance. Frank just got home, we’ve requested CCTV from all floors of the apartment, there’s nothing more I can do”

“Come on we both know-“ he cut me off

“Sir I’m aware of your service and history, I recommend you stay off the pills, maybe get in touch with your sponsor and leave the poor man alone”. Dumbfounded, I stood almost in shock as he walked away, shirt tucked up over his nose and mouth. I knew what had happened, did I seem that deranged? Investigating the hall my stomach dropped as I glared into the lens of the camera overseeing the floor, drenched in cat food.

I’m ashamed to admit that rather than marching into Frank’s nest, guns blazing and such, I retreated further into my own apartment. It was easy to fall into isolation. Buddy was more than enough company. I noticed myself scanning through my peephole at unreasonable hours prior to heading out for cat food, treading lightly in the hallway as though it was littered with mines. The lack of commotion from Frank’s apartment fooled me into an undeserved sense of complacency in the weeks following. It was when my first warning of eviction appeared on the front of my door that I attempted to pull myself out of self-induced seclusion.

 Over the next few days, I focused on myself. Getting back into routines, socializing with friends, paying rent, everything regular people do. I became quite good at avoiding Frank, the originally overpowering stench radiating from his apartment fading into the background, like the scent of home.

 My newfound sense of normalcy dulled something in me.

 It took me a full day to notice Buddy’s absence.

 I prayed that he had just jumped out of the window and was enjoying himself in the city. The surrounding area had become painted with his face and my phone number in hopes of some good Samaritan finding him. Night terrors intensified, the liquor store began to transform into an oasis in a desert Buddy kept me from crossing.

 Several sleepless nights later I began to venture out again, embarking on my rescue mission, right until my ears embraced the jingle of a familiar bell. Heeding my instincts, I crept to Frank’s apartment, ear firmly pressed against the warm, damp door.

 Jingle.

 Jingle.

 I knew Buddy had to be in there.

 It was 2100 hours. I knew what had to be done. Retreating into my apartment I prepared. A flashlight, KA-BAR knife, and my high school shoulder pads were all I had at my disposal. Any companionship or sympathy I felt towards Frank had been usurped by the need to save my best friend.

I had planned to kick down Frank’s door, though the damp and rot had left his chain lock redundant. Pushing it open I heard it squelch, the metal sliding free from the wall.

A musk swallowed the hallway, engulfing me with it. With the flickering light of the hallway warning me of what lay ahead, I flicked on my flashlight.

 Jingle.

 Jingle.

 The walls breathed, each exhale replacing my oxygen with a pervasive, viscous fume. My flashlight directed me to Frank’s bedroom. His bed moaned, spores sputtering out of the sickly green mattress, plaguing the sticky air. A drop of liquid pestered my shoulder, causing me to swivel before looking up. The humidity presented itself on the ceiling, berating me with its infrequent drizzle. Wading through the carpet I reached his closet, hoping the jingles would grow nearer.

 Buddy’s bell cut through my labored breathing. A haunting wind slithered down the hall that led to his kitchen. With my knife gripped firmly in one hand, my flashlight in the other, I slunk down, that unforgettable chewing re-emerging. I laid on the ground, my front absorbing the moisture that riddled the ground, slightly squeaking as I edged further.

 The wailing grew as I turned my head to face the kitchen. Frank’s foot came into view, his body obstructed by the fridge. It appeared gangrenous, pink flesh pulsed as swampish green flesh oozed like wet clay.

 Vomit crammed my esophagus, my eyes watered as I tucked my mouth into my elbow before giving up, allowing it to silently trickle down my jaw. Gunshots and the screams of men, far braver and stronger than me, echoed in my ears. Sand bit into my skin, pushing me back down the hall. Deep breaths in and out coupled with my therapist’s affirmations were my savior as I crouched into Frank’s den.

 Frank lay there, melting onto the floor as his head fused into the wall. His clothes, moist and tattered. His skin was patchy, revealing decayed muscle tissue beneath. Throbbing translucent growths bore into his tissue as his toothless jaw cracked open to release a gentle wail. This couldn’t have been the man that invaded my apartment only weeks ago.

 Jingle.

 Jingle.

 Opening the freezer, I saw the bundle of ginger that was Buddy. Thank God Frank’s power had been cut off. I put my knife down. Carefully, I ripped a swollen growth off his haunch before resting him on my shoulder, snatching my knife.

 “I’ll come back Frank, I swear” I stammered. As what little was left of Frank’s eyebrows raised, he elevated his arm. Liquified flesh sticking to the floor as his muscles and bones broke free. Following the gesture of his arm I turned, eyes flickering across the hallway and into his bathroom, a faint, mulchy chewing exuding from the corner.

 An elderly man, facing the ceiling’s corner, suspended by dark, bristled forceps that sprouted from its torso digging into the drywall. Its legs hung limp, the skin on its spine parting to reveal puss-filled sacks, pierced by thick, twitching hairs. The chewing maintained, its tone inconsistent.

 Slowly, ever so slowly, I turned back to Frank. His dog tags glistening. I turned towards the front door, edging closer to freedom. Buddy sprung to life. Diving off my shoulders and claiming sanctuary in my apartment across the hall, his bell substituting the persistent chewing.

 A scurry rapidly grew louder, marching across the ceiling behind me. I stumbled, using my arms to propel my sprint to join Buddy, a hot breath tickling my neck as I slammed my front door behind me. I immediately swept up Buddy, diving out the window and running into the city.

It’s been a few months. I moved the next day, far away, with my mom. I wish I had a sense of catharsis from writing this out. I have no idea what happened to Frank, all I saw were ambulances and the building being sectioned off from the city when I moved. Regardless, I’m safe now. Buddy is still shaken up. Cat’s behavior changes after traumatic events, I suppose it explains why he keeps chewing my bed frame and salivating over my mom’s kitchen.
