I own an apartment building. Around two weeks ago (I'm not sure exactly when) all 38 of my tenants disappeared into thin air. They stopped paying rent all at once, all stopped answering the phone. 

The police were already there when I made the 3 hour drive from my house to the complex; several of their family members had reported them missing, prompting the police to contact me. I did an interview over the phone, but they insisted I come to the local station for an in person interview. Figuring they'd get a warrant and come arrest me if I didn't, I complied. The interview went smoothly; I didn't know any more than they did about the situation, so they let me go pretty quickly. I go to the same bar every day at 7PM, and I'm on the cameras doing so. It being three hours from my home, even the police had to admit it was highly unlikely I had much to do with the incident. 

I never saw a news report about their disappearances. I think the authorities are ruling no foul play currently, since there's no evidence of violence. If anything, it looked like everyone simultaneously decided they were going to move into some compound out in the mountains. With no motive, no suspects, and no evidence, this couldn't be considered a crime yet. For all we knew, this was some elaborate prank. That's what the officers told me, at least.

I found my way to the apartment complex immediately after the interview. There were police everywhere, but given the fact that I owned the building, they allowed me to enter. They insisted I didn't touch anything unless absolutely necessary, however, and even sent me with a police escort. 

We never found anything. I led the police to the security room; every bit of the CCTV footage from the last ten years I'd owned this building was gone. We didn't back it up on a cloud service, figuring hard storage was enough. Apparently not. 

When it became clear they weren't going to find anything here, the police eventually left. I think the case was turned over to the FBI at some point; I get that idea because two suits showed up on my front porch yesterday, asking me to sign an NDA. I didn't even read it. If they're trying to cover something up, people have the right to know. If the news won't talk about it, I will.

It's been about a week since I first came to the building. I know I have to wait a month to technically evict everyone, but I don't think they're coming back at this point. I was cleaning one of the apartments when I found something inside the air vent. I took the vent cover off, reached inside, and pulled out a dusty book. It was a diary, from the looks of the entries inside. They were all dated, formatted like someone writing in it once a day. 

I'll transcribe the contents in this post.

It's snowing outside today. Since my apartment complex’s roof hasn't been replaced in over twenty years, and me being on the top floor, I can hear every unsettling creak of the heavy powder on top of the rusted steel and plaster that make up the only barrier between my bedroom and certain death. Last night was strange; it almost sounded like someone was walking around up there. They never do maintenance that late at night though, so I'm sure I was just imagining things. 

My plans for today are pretty light, given that I can't even catch the bus to the store right now. I could walk, but it'll be almost an hour round trip in the snow. I don't feel like making that trip today; I'll be okay with the box of cereal in my cabinet and the few microwave meals I have in the freezer. I think I'm just going to finish this entry, then have some breakfast and lounge around for most of the day. Maybe I'll get some work done on my novel.



04/03/2018

I had a rude awakening this morning. Not one, not two, but three birds rammed into my window at about 4AM. I think it was closer to 3:30, but by the time I was done freaking out about the noise and figuring out what had happened it was already 4. I heard three separate bangs against the glass; they hit it so hard cracks have splintered across the surface, catching the poor creatures’ blood in its newly fashioned grooves.

Looking out the window, I couldn't see the birds on the ground below. Not even blood, just pure white snow. 

There's no way they survived that, I thought as I placed my hands on the window’s latch. I froze as I did so, a sudden pang of dread coursing through my body like ice water. I wasn't sure why I felt so uneasy all of the sudden, but I could feel that hair-raising energy that alerts you to an unseen threat’s presence. It felt like someone was watching me, waiting for me to open the window and expose myself. 

I swore, reapplying my grip. Still, though, I didn't open the window. I sat there for several minutes, looking around. What was I so worried about? Why did it feel like opening the window was a mistake? Even if there was something out there, this flimsy pane of glass couldn't stop it. It could barely stop three birds. 

Deciding it wasn't worth the effort this early in the morning, I drew the curtains and returned to bed, telling myself I'd call a repair service later in the day.

Unfortunately, the day never came. When I awoke at 9AM, I thought my phone was broken. Even with the curtains drawn, the sun usually creeps through my window. 

Is it daylight savings already? I thought to myself, stepping out of bed and parting the curtains. My view was exactly as it was last night; blood-riddled cracks spider across the window’s surface, creating a macabre mosaic when overlaid with the dark night and pristine snow. It was as if nothing had changed at all. Worried, I began to examine other features of the world outside. The college campus across the road from me boasts a flag with their visage, proudly waving in the wind day and night. Except, this time, it wasn't. 

The flag stood stark still, as if dunked in water and then frozen in shape. I could hear the wind howling outside, yet the flag did not ripple as it should have. Nor did it sag under its own weight; it merely stood there, fast against the snow and wind. As my bleary, sleep-filled eyes began to adjust, I then noticed something even more uncanny. The flag could be explained away as a creative prank by one of the local frats. The fact that the snowflakes were suspended in midair, unmoving despite the sound of the weather conditions outside, was what really began to stir the panic within me. What was happening?

I checked my phone again, looking for any emergency alerts. I had exactly zero notifications, not even junk from social media. This, despite the much odder circumstances outside, struck me as incredibly strange. I hadn't woken up without having to swipe away some nonsense first thing in the morning in years. I opened my browser, and nothing happened. I sent texts, called people, left voicemails, anything I could do to reach someone outside of my unit. None of it worked. 

Whenever I went to the front door, the same uneasiness that overtook me at the window began to form. I pictured it in my mind as some repugnant, malignant beast lurking over the doorway to my apartment. Images flash through my mind as I touch the doorknob. I crack the door open, just enough to see outside. Red, fleshy nubs pry their way through the small opening almost immediately. I begin to scream, trying with all of my might and weight to force the door shut on these unnatural intruders. The nubs continue to force their way inside as I press my back against the door, continuing to try and repel the horrible appendages. They increase in size as they push their way through the slight opening, revealing themselves to be long tendrils with an appearance and smell similar to raw meat. It didn't smell putrid; it was fresh, metallic, and all too vividly real. The tendrils begin to slither across my skin as they explore the new space inside my apartment, causing my flesh to sizzle and pop. Boils and pustules form at their touch, immediately blistering and rupturing due to the sick heat emanating off of the creature’s flesh. I feel the horrible limbs wrap around my wrists, pulling me through the doorway and into the dark hall outside…

I stepped away from the door at this point, pulling my hand away from the doorknob like it was glowing red hot. I fell back onto the floor of my living room, tears welling in my eyes as I released the most desperate cry for help I've ever heard. It was over almost as soon as it began, but the experience left me reeling, panicking as if the beast’s tendrils were still pulling me out into the hall.

“That was not a hallucination. I'm not crazy, I'm not-” I began repeating something to this effect over and over as I entered my kitchen, searching out the largest knife I could find. With my weapon secured, I retreat to the bathroom, turning the water on immediately. Much to my surprise and relief, the water immediately responds, producing the heavenly warmth I sought. I sat in the shower for at least an hour, clutching the blade in my trembling hands. I don't remember much from the rest of the night, but at some point I must have eaten one of my freezer meals, because the box is still sitting on the counter. Only five left. The cereal would be a nice snack, but it wouldn't sustain me the way the freezer meals would. I was going to have to find food eventually.

And now we're all caught up. It's currently 9PM, around twelve hours after my ‘encounter’ with that thing in the hall. I still don't know what that was. It felt more real than any dream I've ever had, but my injuries were gone by the time I fell down on the floor. It must have just been some kind of panic attack. Maybe the internet is just down and I'm having some kind of schizophrenic meltdown.

I'm going to get some sleep. I'll write again in the morning. I'm not sure who will ever read this, seeing as I can't upload or publish it anywhere, but it makes me feel better to write about it while I'm cooped up in here. 



04/04/2018

My neighbors haven't made a sound in the last two days. With everything that's been going on, I didn't realize it, but they're usually pretty loud. I can always hear them stomping around in the morning getting ready or bumping uglies late at night. Since the sun stopped coming up, though, they haven't made a peep. I haven't heard or seen anything outside either. No cars passing by, no people walking to or from the local restaurants and bars, nothing. It was as if the entire town had all disappeared overnight. Why would I be the only one spared, though? Was everyone else bound to their room in the same way I was? If that was so, why couldn't I hear any of my neighbors?

I've taken to tapping on the walls, hoping I hear someone tap back. With nothing else to do, between bouts of tapping, I've made a schedule for rationing my remaining food. If I only eat one freezer meal every two days, I should be able to supplement with the cereal. I'm hoping that if I wait long enough, this will either blow over or it'll be safer to venture outside. Right now, whatever is out there is a lot scarier than starvation. 



04/07/2018

Today, I'm eating my third freezer meal. There will only be three left after this. I'm almost out of cereal too. The milk is long gone, so I've been eating it dry intermittently. I would love to stretch the food even further, but I have low blood sugar. Even with the pace I'm going at now, I feel light headed constantly. I can tell I've passed out a couple of times in the last few days based on the unaccounted for bruises on my hips and elbows, as well as the goose egg on the side of my head. I must have cracked it on my way down at some point.

I feel good now, having just finished my meal. I think I'm going to try to look outside again. Maybe this time I'll be able to open the door. 



04/08/2018

I was too tired to write more yesterday. I did end up leaving the apartment. When I touched the doorknob this time, nothing happened. No sense of dread, no visions of fiendish creatures attempting to invade my apartment. When I stepped out into the hall, however, I almost thought that would have been preferable. 

My apartment complex is relatively small. There are ten units on each floor, and there are five floors, making for a total of fifty units. Only around twenty of them are occupied, since the building is so damn old. Of the ten units on my floor (the fifth), nine of them had something awful attached to the wall just above their door. 

The best analog I can give for their appearance is a starfish. They suctioned to the wall above each door, their flesh the same angry red as the tendrils from my vision. They undulate and writhe as they rest above each doorway, creating some disgusting facsimile of breathing. I knew right away these creatures did not need oxygen, food, or water. They were not of this world, possibly not of our reality. When I looked upon that wretched mass of flesh, the only emotion that outweighed my disdain of it was my fear of the terrible thing. Wanting to shield my eyes from such an atrocity upon the senses, I turn my eyes back towards my door. There, just above the door frame, is the outline of one of these horrendous things. I could tell it had been there, adhered to the wall. What I couldn't tell was what they were doing. They just sat there, pulsing against the wall’s surface. Their movement reminded me of the way a dog twitches when it sleeps, almost as if they were dreaming. 

Every time I tried to count their many tentacles and appendages, I'd become lost in the horror of their form all over again. I don't know how long I stood in my open doorway, my eyes scanning the otherworldly sight before me. Eventually, I grew lightheaded, and stumbled into the hallway. I caught myself against the wall across the hall, looking down at the floor as my vision swam. I was panicking internally, afraid one of these things was going to reach down and scoop me up into its disgusting embrace. As I collected myself, however, I found that didn’t happen. The creatures didn’t bother me, instead continuing whatever they were doing. I didn’t see any eyes or other organs that appeared to be used for sensory purposes. 

Maybe they’re blind and deaf, I remember thinking to myself. It was possible- probable, even, given the fact that I was still alive, that these creatures only possessed a sense of touch. I walked to the end of my hall, eyes glued to the emergency stairwell. There was no way I was going to risk calling the elevator with everything going on in and around the building. I opened the creaking old door, cringing as it filled the air with what seemed like the loudest noise in all of creation. I slinked through the opening once it was just barely wide enough, not wanting to further risk exposure. The light inside of the emergency stairwell flickered in and out; it had always done that though, that wasn’t a part of… all this. I placed my hand on the rail as I began to walk down the stairs, peeking around each corner ahead of me before stepping around. I didn’t encounter anyone or anything in the stairwell, and reached the door to the fourth floor rather quickly. I cursed the engineers who planned this complex, the lack of a window in the door leading to the fourth floor hallway greatly vexing me. I stood in the stairwell for some time, contemplating the risk and the potential reward for exploring. Perhaps I’d see something far worse than what was on my floor; perhaps I’d see nothing, and I’d find more food. 

The decision was made for me when I heard the creaking of one of the doors further down. I couldn’t tell if it was the door to the third or second floor, but it was certainly one of them. I hurriedly opened the fourth floor door, thanking every god who would listen that it didn’t creak like the others. When I stepped in, I didn’t immediately look at the hallway, instead wedging the doorstop conveniently located on the floor next to me into the bottom of the door. I didn’t think it would even stop a person who was dedicated to getting into this floor, let alone one of those starfish-like creatures, but it helped ease my mind to some extent. I turned around just as I began to hear the sound of something coming up the stairs. I couldn’t tell if it was another person by the sound alone, and I wasn’t willing to wait around and find out. 

I turned to look at the fourth floor, stopping in place as I took in the scenery around me. Three of the apartments were like the nine above: one of those starfish lurked over each of their doorways. The other seven were in various states of disarray. The apartment closest to me on my left, #401, was the worst. The front door hung open, ripped free from the top and middle hinges. Only part of the bottom hinge still held fast, barely hanging onto the wood. Blood was splattered across the open doorway, a severed human arm laying there clutching a gleaming kitchen knife. I looked down to the knife in my own hand, suddenly feeling a lot less confident in its ability to protect me. I looked back up to the room before me as the noises from the emergency stairwell grew louder, indicating whatever came out from the floor below was coming up. It sounded like someone dragging a carpet up the stairs. I could hear their footsteps, but I could also hear the sound of something heavy and limp dragging across the floor. It thudded against each step, adding to the odd mixture of sounds. 

I began to panic as the noises grew nearer, unwilling to enter apartment #401. I tried not to look again once I saw the arm, but as I passed I received a glimpse of what lay inside. It appeared as though someone had been completely unspooled, every part of their body individually stripped away and neatly separated from the others. Intestines lay in meticulously crafted spirals on the floor, organs carefully arranged into the most devilish charcuterie board ever concocted. Before tearing my vision away, I could have sworn I saw the entire hollow skin of a man, draped over a kitchen chair as if it were a winter coat. 

I rush past the apartment as the noise stops at the door to the fourth floor, stepping into apartment #403. Like #401, the apartment door was wide open, but this one wasn’t totally clad in viscera. The apartment looked pretty clean. I wasted no time in closing the door behind me, hoping this would serve as an additional barrier between myself and the stairway dweller. No sooner than I’d found myself wedged into the utility closet, hiding just out of sight behind the water heater and some junk they’d piled against it, I heard the splintering of the emergency stairwell door. I didn’t hear any bashing, no struggling to crack it open, only the cries of splintering wood and the scream of metal as the door gave way. Something had simply pushed the door open in one fell movement, similar to a hydraulic-powered machine. I was convinced at this point; whatever was outside was not human. That wretched dragging noise grew louder and louder, and I just knew the creature was coming towards the unit I hid in. I kicked myself silently for closing the door. If I’d left it open, this thing probably wouldn’t have thought twice about it. I’d gone and closed it when it was open before, meaning it knew someone was in here. I had a feeling that thing was responsible for the empty apartments. Hopefully it wasn’t smart enough to remember.

That hope was unceremoniously shattered as I heard the front door of apartment #403 give way in the same fashion as the emergency stairway’s door. As that thing entered the apartment with me, that awful smell from my vision invaded my nostrils. It was like a slaughterhouse. The stench of freshly spilled organs and hot blood dowsed the entire apartment, making me feel as if I were drowning in liquified pennies. The smell was so overwhelming I had to fight myself not to audibly gag, what little food I had in my stomach roiling around uncomfortably. I could tell it was growing closer, because as the stench increased in power, I could begin to hear its god forsaken breathing. It rattled in the way a person does as they take their last breaths, its lungs presumably filled with fluid if the gurgling sounds it produced in tandem were any indication. As it drew nearer to my hiding place the air became noticeably more humid, almost like I was breathing recycled air. It felt as if I was a child again, hiding under the blankets from imaginary monsters. It passed by me slowly, stopping for what seemed like an eternity directly in front of the utility closet door. I sent up a silent prayer for the fact that this door, like the one in the hall, didn’t have a window. I didn’t want to view that thing; even if it was going to kill me, I would rather turn my back and close my eyes. The dread that consumed me in those moments as I sat in the closet, waiting for it to break the door down and pull me out, was the most sobering thing I’ve ever felt. I feel ten years older after that encounter. 

After some time, the thing slunk away, apparently satisfied with its mediocre search effort. I didn't know if it went into one of the other apartments on the fourth floor or if it went back to whatever floor it came from, but when I exited the utility closet I couldn’t smell it anymore. A trail of fresh blood was left in the thing’s wake, creating the most horrible snail trail I’ve ever seen in my life. I was careful not to slip on the crimson biohazard as I stepped into the kitchen of apartment #403, opening the cabinets with the highest degree of care. I managed to find some canned goods, but everything else these people had already went bad, or maybe it was taken by other people in the apartment like me. I hadn’t seen or heard anyone else yet, but somehow thinking that I wasn’t alone in the apartment building was a great comfort. I tied the cans up in an old shirt, not willing to risk the chance of them banging together or the potential sound created by a plastic or paper bag. I made it back to my apartment unharmed, and five canned goods richer. I got two cans of corn, one of green beans, and two cans of tomato soup. The vegetables are a huge score, but I’m not sure what I’ll do with the soup. I’ll update later. For now, I’m going to eat the last bit of the cereal and lay down for the night. I hope I don’t hear that thing break down the stairwell door on my floor too.

I don’t even know how to start this entry other than to just get started. I woke up last night for no apparent reason, and walked to the window. There was someone standing outside. I almost opened my window and shouted to them, and then I realized what the person was doing. They were throwing something at my neighbors’ windows. I stared for a minute, watching him pick up these almost basketball sized objects and throw them a good thirty feet in the air, smashing against someone’s window. I could hear the glass crumble. My neighborly instincts kicked in, and despite the situation of the past few days, I felt the need to tell him to stop vandalizing our building. That was when I saw what he was throwing. 

They were severed heads, presumably those of my downstairs neighbors. I backed away from the window before the mysterious figure had a chance to see me, hyperventilating from the realization that those weren’t birds hitting my window a few nights ago. Fuck.



04/10/2018

I’ve stopped carrying the knife. It won’t help against the things I’ve seen, it’s only going to get in my way when I need to run. I can feel their grip closing around me like a vice, so it's only a matter of time until I have to. They've started whatever weird phenomena keeps me inside this room again. I think it has something to do with those… things, the starfish, above our rooms. They're isolating us somehow, keeping us penned up like livestock. I just know if I could overcome the visions and step outside I'd see one of those terrible things over my doorway. I assume none of my neighbors on this floor had been taken yet, otherwise why would they have been waiting above the other doors? They would be broken open, like the rooms on the third floor. 

I've been thinking about this for days now, ever since I first stepped out into the hall. Writing it down makes it feel like I've gotten everything figured out, but there's still so much I don't know. I'm considering kicking down my door, since I can't force myself to open it normally. The only thing that's stopping me is the fact that I'll no longer have a functioning door. I doubt it would do much to stop them from coming in anyways, but it makes me feel better. 

It lets me know I'm not the next pig up for slaughter. Not yet, anyways.

  
OP again. I can't fit the rest of the journal into one post, so I'm going to continue transcribing it tomorrow. I'll upload the rest as soon as I'm done.
