Frozen by fear, all I could do was brace myself and listen. 



The longer I listened, the more certain I became that it wasn't a horn.



It sounded like a million voices, humming in perfect unison. Low and steady. Vibrating through the ground, through my body.



The tent rattled violently as another gust slammed into it—and then my worst fear became a reality. 



A guy line snapped. I flinched.



Another one followed, a harsh twang lost in the wind.



I couldn’t ignore it. I had to get outside. Had to fix it before the tent collapsed completely.



With trembling hands, I grabbed my coat, shoved on my boots, and crawled out into the storm.



The rain hit like needles. Wind roared around me, threatening to tear me from the mountainside. Lightning split the sky above the ridge—and for a moment, I saw movement behind the tent. 



Something other than wind. Other than rain. 



I turned. 



The symbols. They were wrong. 



Not just clearer, not just brighter—wrong. 



Rewritten.



Lines that used to fade into the stone were now jagged and sharp. Fresh. 



They twisted in ways I couldn't follow—as if spelling something out. As if they were watching back. 



Another flash of lightning—this time closer. 



The hum grew louder.



Whatever this was—it wasn't just a weather system. 



The guy lines were beyond saving, and I needed to get away from the tent. It was no longer a sanctuary—just a flapping sheet of fabric waiting to entangle or suffocate me. 



I left everything inside. Took only what I had on me—my bag, my jacket and my boots—and started moving back down the ridge. 



This was dangerous but not as dangerous as staying here. 



If I wanted to survive this, I had to keep moving. 



I moved as slowly and carefully as I could, my boots slipping on the rocks regardless. 



I kept my mind locked on the path—on each step—but the humming grew louder with every footfall.



Then, without warning, the hum had exploded into an ear-splitting yowl, and the wind that had only threatened to throw me from the mountain finally did. 



I was yanked off my feet like a ragdoll, tossed through the air—then slammed into the rocks below with the force of a car crash. 



I had never been in this much pain. It felt like my consciousness hovered above—my body battered and broken below. I was sure this was it. This was the end. 



At least in death, I’d be with Eilidh. 



I came to—just for a moment. A familiar voice was telling me everything would be okay—that I’d been found, that I was in the hospital.



Then I passed out again. 



I woke up in the hospital, surrounded by beeping machines. There was someone in the room next to me, but I couldn’t move my head to check who it was. 



I could hardly move at all. A groan escaped my throat as I tried to shift—just enough to get a better look.



The sound must’ve woken them.



The woman uncurled from her sleeping position in the chair, blinked her eyes open, and looked at me smiling.



“Bet ye wish ye’d waited fur me noo,” she said softly, laughing gently. 



It was Eilidh. 



My head spun and my hand shot out to grip the bed rail. 



I didn’t speak. I couldn't.



My mind wouldn’t accept what I was seeing. I just stared at her—at Eilidh. Alive. Smiling. Laughing. Looking at me with that same gentle stare. 



I felt the pull of the IV in my arm. Heard the machines. Smelled the sharp sting of disinfectant. 



But none of it made sense. Not with Eilidh sitting beside me. 



*Did I die?* 



*Is this heaven?* 



*Is it hell?* 



Eilidh didn’t notice my silence.



She kept talking—said they’d found me halfway up the mountain. That *she* had called mountain rescue when my Garmin had stopped sending out signals. 



I blinked hard. My Garmin? That was… right. I think. 



But she was here. Talking like it had been her watching me go, her waiting for updates, her calling for help. 



Not the other way around. 



She poured a glass of water and pressed it to my lips. Water dribbled down my chin and soaked into the sheets. 



Eilidh just smiled and set the glass down on the table beside me. “You gave us aw a right fright. Thought ye wurny coming back, ye shouldny huv gone yersel.”



I stared at her.



This wasn’t how it happened. 



I had stayed home. 



She had gone. 



She had never come back. 



But here she was. And none of this was right. 



Something was wrong. 



The door opened and two nurses stepped in, followed by a doctor holding a clipboard. 



Eilidh stood and stretched slightly.



“Ah’ll get oot yer road, been choking for a coffee anyway” she said before giving me a wink and slipping out the door.



I wanted to call her back, ask her what the hell was going on—but my throat was still raw, and my brain felt like it was still up there on the mountain. 



The doctor glanced at my chart, “You’ve got a long recovery ahead of you. How are you feeling?”



I croaked, “Where… where am I?”



“You’re at the Royal Infirmary. You were found alone near the summit two days ago. Severe exposure, concussion, a few cracked ribs. You’re lucky.”



I blinked, “Who found me?”



The doctor hesitated. “Mountain rescue. Your friend, Eilidh, called them. She saved your life.”

 

I stared at him. 



“She’s not listed as one of your emergency contacts,” he added, almost to himself. “But since she made the call, we thought it best to let her stay. Familiar faces can be grounding—especially after significant trauma.”



I swallowed. “What about my parents? Do they know I’m here?” 



A flicker of concern passed over his face. “With a concussion like yours, a little confusion is normal. Let’s focus on your recovery for now. We can talk more later, once you’ve rested.” 



That set off alarm bells in my head. 



*Wit did he mean confusion? A remember everything just fine.* 



But before I could press him, the nurses were already gone—and the doctor followed close behind, leaving me alone with a ringing in my ears and Eilidh’s voice still echoing in my mind. 



The more I thought about her, the more something felt off. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it—until she came back into the room. 



Eilidh's eyes were the wrong colour.
