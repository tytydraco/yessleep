A few weeks ago my uncle passed away. I didn’t really know him that well, he wasn’t really around when I was growing up even though we live relatively close by. But, I do have some fond memories with him.

In any case, I’ve been helping my mom get his stuff in order as he never married and had no kids. When we got to the cabin a couple days ago to clear out his stuff, we thought a bear had broken in. The front door was unlocked and the whole place was ransacked. I figured we might as well just rent a dumpster and call it good, Bigfoot or a hobo had already made off with the loot. Mom told me to stop being disrespectful of the dead. I told her the dead don’t care.

While I was cleaning, I found a big folder of paperwork underneath a file cabinet with a broken lock. I couldn’t help but find it weird to keep paperwork **underneath** a file cabinet. I put them in the car and kept cleaning, but my mind never left them.

**Unlocked front door. Ransacked house. Broken lock on a file cabinet.**

Someone might have been looking for something. Maybe I had found it.

I read through them. They made me worried.

So, I’m hoping that posting a bit of what I found here, and having you all make fun of me, will help quiet these fears, because right now, I feel like I’m being gangstalked. Maybe I’m just paranoid over a coincidence and some really good fiction.

I don’t feel safe posting an image of the raw documents, though, because there are company logos and *FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY* or *RESTRICTED ACCESS* printed on them. I looked up the company name and couldn’t find anything substantial. There were a few low engagement posts that popped up on r/conspiracy and a few links I was too afraid to click for fear of inviting a virus, so hopefully I’m being overly cautious. These are probably just fan fics, that’s what I keep telling myself.

On the slim chance I’m right, I’d rather not have these floating around the internet, so I’m just going to upload the transcript I ripped from them.

If you guys can help me out, and bring me back to planet earth, please do.

Hello, to… whomever will be reading these, I guess!

I have arrived safely! Hard to believe last month I was sitting in Florida, cultivating melanoma, and now here I am inside a bunker on top of a snow-covered mountain. Funny how life can flip for you just… out of nowhere. To think, I almost didn’t bother opening that email. Sorry, rambling. Excited!

You guys certainly take location security seriously, I have no idea where I am! I guess I’ll just have to take your word for it that I’m “somewhere in mountainous Canada", cause that’s what I packed for. I’m excited to get to exploring all of it in my down time.

I swear, it feels like I haven’t talked to anyone for three days, and it’s only been one! That’s why you only let people do six months at a time, I bet. I’m up for the challenge though. I brought *Endurance: Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage* for inspiration for when the going gets tough. This log will be a good way to record how I’m doing. I apologize to whoever you are in advance if these daily submissions get a little weird. Remember! You asked for them! HAHA

As specified in the manual (by the way… there are spelling errors haha I can help you fix that after I get back) I’ve inventoried and cataloged everything here at the outpost and will upload the info to another log. There seems to be more than enough food here to last me my contract, and I’ll be supplementing it with whatever I can hunt. I also appreciate you supplying the gear. Top of the line stuff back in 2005. They don’t even look like they’ve been used. It’ll be an honor to break them in and get back to my outdoor roots.

I have familiarized myself with the layout of the outpost, too. It’s less cramped than I had braced myself for. Figured I’d be in a concrete broom closet. Instead it’s more like a concrete apartment. Plus, I’ve got the great outdoors right outside when I feel the walls start to close in.

Overall, exciting first day. First ride in a helicopter! Too bad I couldn’t see anything HAHA

Think I’ll test out that kitchen and tear into the stack of books I brought with me. 

Till tomorrow... whomever you are! Definitely need to think of a name for my omniscient reader, wouldn’t want to spill my guts to a stranger… no matter how true it may be.

I completely forgot to do my one job… on the first day! Please forgive me haha. Like I said, it’s been a long day. 

I haven’t seen a computer terminal like that since I was a kid! Green text and everything. Reminds me of my first computer. Nice to see old tech still being useful. I input the question written in the manual. You guys were real deliberate in the instructions haha I promise not to deviate from the question.

By the way, the page with all of the instructions for the computer is covered in a weird, dried fluid of some sort. I doubt it’s blood, though I have to admit that was my first reaction. Between the typos and the overall grime on this thing, I’d suggest printing a new one for the next custodian. Should work for me though, I spent yeeeears trying to decipher student homework. These eyes have seen it all. 

The operation, or software… IDK, whatever it is, the computer says it’s doing fine. I typed in what it said to put. It said “Operations normal, no update” back.

Anyways, till tomorrow.

Hello.

Looks like a big storm blew in last night. I didn’t realize it until I tried to go outside to see the sunrise. Apparently I won’t be able to hear anything going on out there.

There was a literal wall of snow blocking the door. So today was a snow day! I got to sip coco and finish my first book.

Other than that, nothing to report. I created a schedule for myself to help with the upcoming monotony: casual workout routine, outdoor time, reading time, crafts etc. I feel like it will help keep my mind in order.

Felt a bit of a pang for the internet today. It’s been almost 48 hours since I secured my phone, and up till now I hadn’t really thought of it. Course, I had that herculean journey with a bag on my head to keep my mind occupied. 

The paycheck cleared though, so I guess I can’t be too mad at the treatment. I knew what I was getting into! 

Overall, good second day. 

All systems are normal with no updates.

Tomorrow hopefully I get outside a bit.

HELLO. GUYS THE DOOR IS LOCKED. I can’t get out. I tried this morning to see if the storm passed, but the handle just spins and the door won’t budge. I need you to send someone to fix it ASAP. 

**\~Log 003(b): 3/4/2015\~17:57\~**

Hello, sorry for freaking out earlier. I had a bit of a panic attack when I realized the door broke. Felt like a rat in a trap. The walls came closing in all at once when I realized I can’t get out. Everything is ok, though. I realized I have everything I need inside to keep monitoring your project, and in my spare time I can see about getting the door unjammed. Maybe it’s just frozen shut from the storm and I just need to wait till it thaws a bit. It would be terrible to be stuck in here the whole contract. The whole point of signing on was getting to be out in nature! 

Anyways, if you guys could send me a response of some kind that you’re getting these messages? I kinda feel like I’m just sending these off into the aether. 

Everything else is normal.
