Seven months ago was a nightmarish scene that plagued the lives of many here. In a single night, different & unique horror encounters were concluded to their their unfortunate endings. Those horror tales, they all came from uniquely different individuals from all across the map. And they all ended together in one moment -That deadly night.

The night of July 7th is perfect setting for a horror show. An unusual storm had been showering Jones-Town for a week and the night of the 7th is the storm's angriest. The storm seemed to shower an oceans worth of rain and the winds are violently swaying the entire forest in all directions. And underneath the darkness of night and within the chaos of the storm is where those stories ended.

All the stories, I have gathered them from the people who refused or are unable to tell their horrifying tales. And after months of hard work, today, I have finally acquired them all. Finding these individuals and managing to acquire their stories cost me a lot of money, time, research and skills but I thrived. Now, all the horrors that happened that night will finally be revealed, its time for me to share the stories, and let's begin with the first story that I've acquired.

My journey began at my first expedition. You can call this "The First Episode" since that I'm revealing it in a story form. This is the first of many horrors to come.

The First Episode: *Animal Snatcher*

Jones-Town is a large and populated area, a town that inhabits thousands of residents living their modern lives. Although the town is 80% modern structures, where I need to be is at the far southwest of the town. Instead of buildings and modern houses, the southwest edge of Jones-Town is mostly flat lands and trees. A massive land for nature to grow itself unsupervised. Forests, lakes, flat lands, it was a breath of fresh air away from noise pollution and the crowd. A kind of place where our first story teller resides, a place for his humble farm.

It's 5am in the morning when my long drive had finished. After 7 hours of searching and asking about, I have found the farm that I was looking for. I've been driving for four hours with nothing but my cars' AC to condition my body so and when I stepped outside the car, the wind hit me and I immediately felt the countryside's natural atmosphere.

The place is flat, green, enormous and is blooming of plant life. The sun is rising and its light combined with the breeze of the fields gave me the feel of natures' comfort. I thought I'd feel bliss as the breeze and morning light brushed through my skin but instead I felt eerie and heavy. Maybe that feeling is from knowing that something horrible happened here, an encounter to discover that led me here in the first place.

My research had led me here where our farmer had his strange story. According to some folks I spoke off, his farm had been attacked relentlessly for days but there were no records from the police somehow. I wish to know more on what happened and which better person to ask about it than the farmer himself.

I went straight into the farm and followed a dirt road that leads to a big house. I'm looking forward to having a cup of morning coffee and a little chat about his incident seven months ago. I'm willing to pay a huge amount of money if I had to.

I knock on the house's door multiple times but no one were inside. I checked and peeked on every window until I finally concluded to myself that the house is empty or there's a very heavy sleeper inside. I decided to give up and check the one building left to see within this huge land, and in that building is where I found him.

The farmer is at his barn, busy tinkering with his tractor engine. I approach the man cautiously. I didn't waste any second the moment he noticed my presence. I said my good morning and asked as directly and straight forward as I can, not hiding my intentions. As much as I wanted to take this interview as slow and tactful as I can, I'm unfortunately scheduled to interview and locate more story teller. Unlike this farmer that's easy to find, the rest of them are either at the other edge of the town or hiding somewhere. Time is of the essence. I asked the farmer and brought out my recorder, this is the audio of our talk.

"*Well good morning to you too mister. Pleasure seeing a different face in this place. That's a fancy suit you're wearin, it doesn't belong here on my farm. What's your business?*

...

*You've been sniffing around huh. You're askin me about that story? Seven months ago? Yeah, the story is true, my farm were attacked back then. My animals were disappearing, getting stolen. Damn thief took advantage of the storm to mess with my quiet living. And the worst part, there's no evidence throughout those crimes too. A set of clean robbery*.

**...**

*Yes, you're right. No trails, no footprints, no nothing. The storm had become that thiefs' accomplice. Even those city detectives couldn't make progress investigating cause I have no evidence to share, only my word saying that I have less animal on my farm every mornin.*

*It was all the birds that were stolen. Ducks and chickens were disappearing like magic every night while I slept. I would wake up with the door to my bird coop busted open and one of the cages will have a couple or more of my birds missing.*

***...***

*Yeah! That's true, you're right again. I have indeed decided to stop the thief from his stealing. I took it upon my own hands to take care of the thief since that the police wouldn't do what I wish them to.*

*On July 2nd, the rain is waving the trees violently cause there was a crazy storm. I hid at my bird coop with my wooden bat, ready to swing with full force. It was cold and dark. But with weapon in hand, I waited for that damn thief.*

*Gotta admit that I couraged myself up first with some beer. Just to get to the mindset of ambushing y'know. I was drunk that night. A drunk, pissed off, 47 years old, 6'3 man with a baseball bat.*

*I waited patiently in my barn like a gator, ready to snap its mouth to any perpetrator. The night is rainy and quiet, very quiet until the thief starts to make his move.*

***Squeeek. Squeeek.***

**It was the doorknob, the door handle being twisted, the keyhole being tampered with, being lockpicked. Whoever was outside, it's about to break in soon.**

*The squeaking of the door woke me up like a splash of cold water and I immediately stood firm behind it. I readied my stance as he gently opened the door. My chickens started getting aggravated as the stranger crept nearby them with his heavy breathing. Their peaceful slumber was interrupted by an unknown thief.*

*I slowly came out of my hiding spot and saw him slightly. The bastard is too busy opening one of the cage to notice me, that was my opportunity to sneak and strike. I jump at him and... KABAM! I hit him good! A good slam at his back. It was so strong that my wooden bat splits into two. I recoiled back from the force and the thief made a quick escape retreating to the woods.*

*I didn't bother chasing after him. Seeing the broken bat, I thought the message was sent. The message to not fuck with me. That was the last time my birds disappeared. He stopped and never came back, my plan worked.*

*...*

*Yes its just one guy.*

*...*

*Hmmm? You don't believe it's one guy? Well, up to you buddy. I can't tell you things that didn't happen. I'm telling the truth. My mother didn't raise a liar.*

*...*

*Sigh, Look, I did the job and it was done, alright. What else do you want, that's the whole damn thing. One deranged criminal messed with me.I understand why, it's cause I'm all alone in this farm. An easy target to those who don't have something better to do. I might be a one man army but I took care of it, end of story. Now, unless you know anything about tractor engines, you can leave my property. Your pushy attitude is getting on my nerves.*

*...*

*I said that's all of it. Stop bothering me or I'll call the cops on your ass.*"

End of recording.

\-------

The lone farmer didn't even bother to look at me throughout it all. He just kept his hand and eyes on his tractor as if he's talking to himself while telling me the summary of his story. But I know there's more to it than that, he's holding back so much more and I know it. I anticipated that he wouldn't cooperate immediately but I know what to do for him to take me seriously. What I did next, I told him (*???????*) and showed (*???????*), it startled him.

He made eye contact and I can see the fear on his eyes, a traumatic recall. My words along with the picture is definitely not what he's expecting. His grumpy and distracted attitude changed, he immediately got up and invited me into his house, prioritizing me before his farm works. He have me sat down to his living room couch as he prepare the two of us coffee.

His living room is a nicer place to converse than his barn earlier. As I sip my coffee, he sat down at the opposite couch, let out a huge sigh, and braced himself. I braced myself too, braced to hear what really happened on his farm. I take my camera and hit record.

This is the recording of our conversation:

farm(1).mov

*"Sigh...*

*I don't know who you are mister and I'm not interested to find out. I'm just a farmer livin his quiet life out here. I don't know what madness did my farm got mixed up to and I don't want anymore.*

*You're really planning to (???????). Well, I'm not going to help you with that, but the least I could do is to tell you the true story. It was a lot more brutal than what I cooked up to those nosey reporters. Here we go.*

*Firstly, I never really were alone in here, not a one man army at all. I always had homely company, Milo and Biscuit, my two companion dogs. I loved them very much. They've been with me since they were a puppy, both from their momma Moxy that died here in the farm, buried at the back. Oh I tell you, those two puppers kept my spirits alive throughout those days of being under attack. My daughter loved them both too, but when she died of cancer, they're the only family I had left.*

*Now those first 3 days of attack, chickens and ducks started vanishing with the door to my bird coop lockpicked open. That had become my morning surprise. I would feel annoyed about it. I see my animals as a family member since I'm raised that way. To think that someone is stealing my precious birds and doing who-knows-what is both infuriating and scary.*

*Whatever thief it was, it's clearly not some dumb animal getting some snacks. It was intelligent and it knew how to open locks. A strange thief that's not interested with the cash in my house but instead the animals in my farm.*

*No evidence meant no progress of knowing. The storm washed up all its traces pretty good. The third day of its theft, it stole a total of three birds including my favorite duck I named Dick. It was the straw at the back of the camel, I had enough. The police couldn't make a move so I decided to fight for my animals and be vigilant, I decided to ambush the thief myself.*

*That night of the ambush, I had my bat and beer towards the bird coop and positioned myself. I lay hidden at my bird coop that 2nd of July. The lights all over my house were open and the TV is very loud, all to make it look like I'm in the house y'know.*

*I waited patiently until 11pm when weirdness started happening. First weird thing I saw was my dogs, Milo and Biscuit. They were standing towards the window, scratching the glass while barking like they're trying to get out. They both saw something and wanted to chase after it, and they were looking at my direction, at the bird coop.*

***Squeeek. Squeeek.***

**It was the doorknob, the door handle being twisted, the keyhole being tampered with, being lockpicked. Whoever was outside, it's about to break in soon.**

*I control my breath and the beating of my heart in an attempt of stealth. The thief opens the door. It was a small boy with blonde hair, about 4'10, it were dark so I can't really see much of him except of that. He's determined though and is immediately heading towards a chicken cage.*

*But before he could open a cage, I jump at him and... KABAM! I hit him on the back, it was so hard that it broke my wooden bat into two. You may call that child abuse, I'll call it self defense. I lost my balance as I recoil from swaying my bat and dropped to the floor.*

*The kid on the other hand did something that I still argue to myself to this day, weather or not it really happened or its just my drunk brain.*

*The kid got knocked back towards the muddy floor and he did something off. He started shaking his head left & right, up & down as if he's continuously nodding and disagreeing very violently and quickly. I thought I got him in the head and gave him seizures, but I'm certain it was his back that I hit. He then regain balance but not just with his feet, he stood Immediately with all his limbs like a dog. He started crawling unbelievably quickly outside the bird coop, moving like a super spider where all his limbs bends and stampedes quickly for his escape.*

*I stood up and looked at the window, watch him crawl into the darkness behind the fence and deeper within the trees. He was so fast and it all happened in merely seconds. It's almost like he can race against my dogs crawling and he'd win, for him to cross my land with such speed on all fours. I thought it was weird but my focus got changed towards my birds. I felt relieved, nothing will hunt them anymore. I've won, my ambush succeeded and the boy never returned.*

*I came back to my house and took a warm bath thinking that nothing will bother me anymore, or so I thought. That night, I slept with satisfaction.*

*Now for the next part, I kept it a secret cause nobody believed me when I first shared. But knowing what you showed me earlier, that picture, I know you'll find my story very believable. Because the next four days, things had escalated from annoying to terrifying.*

*Af day after that ambush against the thief, I was watching the TV the next stormy night, July the 3rd. I remember laughing very loud on a joke from that funny sitcom. I were watching something hilarious with popcorn and booze beside my couch, my kind of perfect night. I feel happy and safe knowing that my bird coop won't be tampered with anymore.*

*But then.. amidst my loud laughter, a bizarre scream from the distance was picked up by my ears.*

*My laughter were immediately replaced by terror and my smile turned into a frown the moment I realize what my ears just picked up out of nowhere, a weird indistinguishable scream from outside.*

*Shivers ran all over my body. I immediately stood and muted the television by instinct. My hearing sharpened and my heart pounded quickly as I sharply stare at the direction of the scream. I stood there frozen, blankly staring with anticipation to hear any follow-up sounds or maybe "it" busting through my doors or windows, but there was only the sound of rain left. Its just one scream and nothing to follow.*

*That scream wasn't loud, but loud enough to be heard slightly from this living room. It sounded like a whispered scream hearing it here. The fact that it managed to be heard despite the storm, the walls, and the distance is bizarre enough. The worst part, it didn't sound like human... nor any animal.*

BARK! BARK! BARK!

*I nearly jumped when they started barking. Milo and Biscuit's delayed and aggressive barks confirmed it, that it wasn't my imagination. They heard it too and was aggravated. Too scared to bark right away until courage finally builds up within them.*

*I peeked on the window to scout a look. The bird coop can be viewed from here but I saw it was untouched. It didn't seem like someone broke-in unlike the past nights.I spent half an hour trying to keep an eye out to the outside, I observe the bird coop until drowsiness overtook the fear.*

*I decided to sleep for the night and brushed it off as "just something weird". There is no way I'm investigating, in the middle of a stormy night, on where and what is the source of that scream. I just took my hunting rifle beside my bed that night, the gun that I never used nor wished that a day would come that I will require to use it. Milo and Biscuit had to sleep in my room too, we all felt uneasy and needed each other to feel safe.*

"It's probably nothing" *I tell myself as I slowly fade into sleep.*

*The next morning, I woke up with slight rain at day. Milo and Biscuit were usually excited for the morning rain. They we're playful on the mud puddles like children enjoying the simplicity. But this morning was different, they didn't leave the house nor my room. Their behavior honestly weirded me out. I tried dragging Milo out but he would whimper and crawl back to the room with Biscuit.*

"Fine! I'll work by myself!" *I mutter to my dogs.*

*I headed outside and started the day grumpy yet cautious. Their behavior reminded me to be sharp. I investigated the farm with caution, thinking that whatever it was that screamed, it might still be around.*

*My searching didn't last long, I held my hunting rifle and looked inside one of my barns. I smelled something strong and inside of it was a horrifying surprise. One of my precious animals were killed. Not just stolen, but this time, killed. It wasn't from my bird coop too, not just a small bird this time. It was one of my barn pigs, the biggest pig in here I named Cobble.*

*I entered the barn and found Cobble nailed into the wall of my barn like a painting. All hands and feet were stretched and broken, each limbs are nailed to the wall forming an upside-down X-shaped pig corpse. His face is pointing to the floor with belly against the wall. His midsection was massacred, it was skinned off, exposing his rib-cage and insides. Some of Cobble's guts nearly fell off the ground after being exposed upside down all night. A gory display of one of my beloved animals. I couldn't help but vomit my breakfast at the sight.*

"What the fuck!?" *I shouted, as I wipe my mouth off of bile. I desperately ran outside the barn to get air. The smell of fresh open carcass was not good to my stomach. I look around for breakage, inspected the fences, eye out some footprints, but I found nothing. The rain washed-off all the possible prints before it could give me some clue. Any clue on how this happened to Cobble.*

*I decided to run back to the house and called the police immediately, but I had no response behind the phone, just static and a long beep. Out of all the times to be offline, they chose this day when things got dangerous and critical.*

*Instead of waiting for a response, I went back to the corpse with a thick mask and cleaned up the scene that was my precious Cobble. I scratched my head in confusion and disgust as I mop the pool of blood and guts.*

"What the hell happened to you Cobble? Was it that boy again? I thought I got him. Did he really ran off on fours like a monkey that night? I was drunk and might've misremembered... Did he also made that scream? or was this all from something new? argh! fuck all of these." *All these questions kept running on my mind as I buried what remains of Cobble. It was a lot of work.*

"This is the worst morning of my life" *is the only confirmed thought on my mind. The day had passed and I spent half of it cleaning up the gruesome murder. I wanted to visit the police myself but I need to tend on my farm. I can't spare 4 hours of travel and leave the farm.*

*The night approached and a lot has been done, I were so busy and it got dark without me noticing. That night in my bed, I was about to close my eyes to sleep off my fatigue. But again from the outside, I were disturbed by that horrifying scream. A little bit louder this time, a little bit closer. I jumped and froze and saw Milo and Biscuit below the bed. They didn't bark anymore, they just whimpered as they tuck themselves in a corner. My exhausted body couldn't be bothered, I fell asleep shortly after.*

*Whatever that thing is, it didn't stop after one pig. It just gave me a taste of what's about to come. The horror show has begun and my farm is the stage, my animals were the victim.*

*The next morning was my cow Shaina that were killed. Her body was skinned and she was hanged to the neck by a tight rope as if she committed suicide. Her intestines fell off the floor from being hanged and having no skin to cover her innards. The horrible sight made me vomit yet again. I fear on how the thing is committing such violence on high a degree. I called the police for the third time but was greeted by static yet again, there's something wrong going on.*

*De javu? Its like yesterday had repeated itself. The fact that I'm disposing a cow instead of a pig this time confirmed that I'm actually experiencing this twice. I sleep early out of fatigue but my slumber were interrupted by a scream yet again.*

*The third morning of attack is another mess, it was two pigs. Chaert and Chandle from different barns. All their limbs are torned off, two pairs of arms and legs were missing. And their limbless bodies were clawed with a hook by their jaw up the ceiling like a caught fish. Their torned off limbs made them bleed to death.*

*This killer loves to hang my animals and leave them to die slowly, either bleeding or with guts exposed. Cleaning the remains took me almost half a day and I nearly got nothing done afterwards. My body tires out from mopping out blood and burying pig carcass. My mind tires out as well from the stress and gore that I had to endure.*

"This is all just a nightmare, right?" *The night occurred quickly. I came back home with Milo and Biscuit acting very scared in my room, anticipating the scream. I slept at the sofa but can still hear the whimpering of my poor puppers upstairs. Sure enough, the scream that they've been fearing for happened and it made my dogs whimper louder.*

*Then the next morning, 7th of July, was three cows killed. Shishu, Shopping, and Sheck. They were all nailed into the wall forming a display of X-shaped massacre scene like of Cobble but in different orientations. Shishu is facing the ceiling with belly against the wall, Shopping is upside down facing the floor with his back against the wall, and Shelby is nailed facing the ceiling with belly exposed. All of them had their rib-cage opened like a cabinet, exposing their lungs and making them bleed to death.*

*Four days of massacre and my farm nearly emptied, it was torture. Hours of my morning became a disposal of gore from the killer's mess. My nights were then haunted with indistinguishable screams afar that gave me nightmares and terrorized my poor dogs.*

*The craziness was all to much and the help was out of reach, I had enough. I thought about heading to the station but it was a long drive. I thought about moving out but my father didn't raise a quitter. I made up my mind. No more loosing my livestock and sleeping in fear. I decided that I need to ambush again."*

end of recording.

July7th (Farm ambush).mov

"*That stormy night of the ambush is July 7th, Seven months ago. I didn't bother cleaning up the 3 dead cows that's nailed to the wall. I instead use my day to gather the remaining animals in one barn. This is my trap for the intruder, a part of my plan.*

*I lay on top of the barn, ready to strike. Again, I'm half drunk but armed with a rifle and dynamites this time, ready for round two.*

**...**

*Yes, a rifle and dynamites. I was drunk and fucked-up. After all the carnage that happened, I figure that a bat wouldn't cut it anymore. Bringing a bat to a massacre might get me killed. Even though I have never shoot a living being with a gun throughout my life, that night I'm determined, decisive and drunk.*

*The stormy night went on and the killer hadn't come by, no screams, no deaths. The barn is quiet. I thought that maybe the killer knew about the lunatic waiting for it or the strong storm made it back out of its normal killing. Waiting for the bastard nearly made me fall asleep. Nearly...*

*I slowly drift into sleep as my mind slowly prioritize my fatigue more than the ambush. My descent to a dream were interrupted by weird noises, it was sounds from my animals below. They were noisy and panicking. Loud moo's and oinks from below fired up my nerves and made me peek, below I saw it fresh. A recent crime.*

*One cow had its body crushed, my cow's torso is squished. Muscle and flesh are popping out of its skin as if a gigantic hand had grabbed it and squished it tight, or something enormous gave it a hug to death. Blood gushes out of its nearly exploded face and its guts and flesh were being trampled over by other animals that were panicking. The stampede of scared animals below was so loud.*

"Stop! Stop! Stop! STOP!!" *I yelled, suffering the noise of panicking animals. I couldn't take it. I ran outside to avoid the horror of chaos and let the storm's rain comfort my ears. My panic slowly dissolves as the sound of rain and thunder muffled the stampede within the barn.*

*Amidst of my panicking, I noticed something outside. A huge pool of blood leading somewhere, a fresh trail of blood that hasn't been wiped by the storm completely, my dead cow making a path towards the killer. It leads further out, over the fence.*

*It made chills ran down my neck to see the only lead I got towards confronting the perpetrator. Under the influence of alcohol, I followed the trail of blood. It goes outside my plot, further into the woods. I followed it confidently, I am determined.*

*It sounds crazy walking the woods alone under a stormy night, following blood. Normally I'd feel fear, but this time I didn't. Wielding a gun under the influence of beer can do magic to you. I'm ready for my first kill and I seek vengeance.*

*As I follow the blood, out of nowhere, in the darkness of the forest, it screamed. It was very loud and clear towards a direction. My eyes followed the outworldish sound and I aimed my rifle at the source of it. My hands suddenly became shaky as I hold the trigger with my finger, cowardly pointing at the scream.*

*I wanted to see what it was, but it was too dark. All I could do is point my weapon on where it came from. My heart pounds quickly as my finger hook the trigger. This is the gun that I never wanted to use ever in my life, not even for any animals. But somewhere in that direction is a monster that terrorized my life and massacred my farm.*

*It all happened in seconds, all in my head. My heart quickly debated my mind telling me to run while I still have the distance.. or my two legs intact and not massacred. But my mind protests telling me to fight, reminding me of the horrors that I endured and how I wanted this to end... I made quick a decision of fight or flight.*

***BANG! BANG!***

**A loud noise disturbed the forest.**

*I shoot at the direction twice! I think I successfully hit it! The monster immediately stampedes to the right after taking a bullet. I felt the adrenaline rushed through me as I shoot my gun at something for the first time. The thing ran for its life and two bullets didn't seem enough. It's the first time I heard its footsteps too. The speed of its steps almost sounded like two horses somehow rushing in one space. It seemed big based on the sound of its stampede, probably twice the size of a moose. I didn't waste time. I got it good but I need to finish it.*

*I immediately ran after a bleeding creature. My senses sharpened as I grip my gun tighter the moment I realized that its on, the hunt is on. I chased after its footsteps, running through the heart of forest until I ran out of breath. It was so fast, very fast, and sooner, I lost following its stampede. It kept running on weird zigzag directions until I lost my ear on where it ran off.*

*But I'm way too sharp that night, sharp enough to find a new trail to follow it. My senses saw more red blood from the bullet wound. Blood stained branches, blood stained leaves, and bloody dirt. I followed with my flashlight and it led me towards somewhere, an unknown landmark that I didn't knew existed. It was the mouth of an abandoned mine shaft deep within the woods.*

*That mine shaft, I lived here all my life but have never known it's here until the hunt led me to it. I flashed my light to the pitch black entrance and saw droplets of blood on the ground, it leads deeper into the darkness where my light couldn't reach.*

*Of course, I didn't enter the horrifying mine shaft that I discovered. I may have been drunk that time, but I already knew that I'm chasing after some monster. The monster that emptied a barns worth of animals and took two bullets but managed to ran away. No way I would enter its nest.*

*I Instead prepare the dynamites I had and planted them at the entrance, intending to blew it all, to close it up with debris of rocks. I ignited the dynamite and got some distance, then...*

***BOOM!***

**A large explosion at the entrance of the mine shaft.**

*It blocked the entrance with rocks. What I just did, the creature didn't like it. From somewhere close by, It screamed. It screamed so loud that it knock me back into my senses, It was louder than ever, clearer than ever and closer than ever. The scream sounded like a choir of humans and pigs screeching from one throat, it was out-worldly.*

*The courage from beer had drained all of a sudden. It made me feel fear and paranoia that I should've felt earlier within the hunt.I backed off instinctively as I regretted my decision.*

"Why the fuck would I chase after something that skins huge animals!?" *I backed instinctively until I tripped and fell on my back, hard against a tree. A bee hive hanging from the tree fell down on me, it must've lost its grip on the branch when my fall I shook the tree. Angry bees started coming out and I ran away from the swarm towards the open rain, exposed off of cover but free from angry insects.*

*I tried to point my flashlight at the scream but it won't open. The fall crushed my flashlight leaving everywhere unseen under the blanket of darkness. In an unfortunate set of accidents, I've become a blinded prey out in the open.*

*Then follows the sounds of sudden, sharp and quick movements along the trees. The creature is angry and closing in, circulating around nearby. I felt its intense killing intention creeping along the trees. Preparing to pounce on me.*

*The sounds of its footsteps... branches being past over... and bushes being rattled. Something out of this world is circling close here, something mad violent.*

*I quickly grab my hunting rifle and aimed and the noise...It made the sounds stop... All those rushing and violent noises had immediately silenced. Quieted itself the moment I aimed leaving only the sound of rain and thunder. It must've known that I had a chance of fighting back. The flavor of bullet wound earlier must've reminded it of what death tasted like.*

*What the monster didn't know is that my gun had somehow broken as well like my flashlight. I only realized it when I aimed. The cartridge is oozing with sticky honey from earlier accident, damaging the inside of my gun. I pull the trigger and heard a "click".*

*Nonetheless, I aimed. Wherever it moves slightly, I will pointed my gun at it and it will stop. I'm acting for life or death, pretending to be dangerous. There was a long silence that felt like a stand-off. It will move around me and I will follow its direction while pointing a broken gun at it.*

*It was long until the tension was broken. Broken by the sound of leaves being stepped on. I aimed my gun at it. It was footsteps walking away, backing up from me. It then quickened its retreat. Then started running away from me. The sound of its footsteps becomes farther and quieter until I'm alone again.*

*I've won. The creature wised up and decided to retreat. I ran as well. I ran as far as I could on the opposite direction. I ran until I see a familiar road. What just happened left me paralyzed. I dropped my rifle and sat down by a tree a the side of a concrete road, looking for comfort. I wanted to run back home already but I didn't want to give away my location, not under pitch darkness.*

*After waiting silently at the side of the road for hours, the sun started to rise turning the sky into a shade of light blue. The rain slowly stopped making a deafening quiet throughout the forest. The small presence of daylight gave me comfort and security. It was my cue to run along and go back, so I did. I ran as fast as I could, following the road back until I'm home.*

*I kept looking at my sides as I run at the middle of the large concrete road. Alert in case a monster happens to follow and show itself. Luckily it didn't, I made it back home safe. My ambush has ended.*

*That is my story.*

*My days became tame and I didn't get attack anymore after that ambush. Maybe it's because I managed to lure it away, or maybe because I decided to only grow crops after that mess. No more animals to be found in here anymore.*

*I didn't wanna look after to any kind of animals after that. When I got back from the ambush, it was traumatizing seeing the brutalized bodies of my dogs when I got back home. Milo's body, still sticking to the wall after the thing had slammed him there with great force. His guts splattered all over the wall. Biscuits' ravaged body on the floor, almost indistinguishable to a dogs' corpse apart from some brown fur along with the mush of his flesh.*

*Earlier when you showed me a picture of (the creature), I was shocked. I barely saw its silhouette and you manage to get a clear photograph. Glad to know that it really was a monster, no human could've done something like that.*

*I won't tag along on your (mission to hunt it) but I'll gladly mark on your map where that abandoned mine shaft is.*

*...*

*Here, somewhere on this part I've encircled. I Hope you got what you needed. Bring a shovel if you're gonna dig your way in the mine after I closed it up with dynamites. And firearm knowing that its vulnerable of taking a bullet. I'll advise against it though, hunt at your own risk."*
