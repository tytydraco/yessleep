I was just getting home from my 30 minute commute home after a long and grueling day at school. I was a senior in high school at the time, being privileged enough to be able to pick which school I'd go to. I ended up picking one that was about 30 minutes away from my house. I had only picked it because of it's outstanding reputation and the fact that it wasn't too big of a school, maybe about 300-400 students.

Anyway, I had just gotten home when I received a notification. The notification sound was unmistakable, it was from Snapchat. I pulled out my phone and saw it was from the senior group chat. We had set this group chat up a few months prior, but I had mostly ignored it as it was mostly filled with immature 17-18 year old boys who knew nothing other than causing havoc. At first I ignored the message, but more and more messages kept bothering me so I opened it, sure to be greeted by the usual spam that regularly plagued the chat. I was wrong - everyone was online planning the best day for senior skip day. For those unaware, senior skip day (sometimes known as ditch day) is a day where everyone is supposed to go to school, but instead seniors call out sick and hang with friends and go to parties. The date was set for April 24th.

Now I'm not the most popular guy, granted I do some technology work for the school when I have free time, so most people know who I am - but I rarely interact. I have a small group of 5-6 friends who I decided to plan out skip day with. We communicated and decided the night before we would sleep over at one of our friends, Jess's house, then spend all of skip day doing some fun things. Well needless to say some things didn't go according to plan.

On the 23rd, I arrived slightly later than everyone else, having to go to work that night. After arriving, I stepped out of my car and started walking towards my friend's house. I got to the front door and started to reach for the knob when I heard nearby rustling. Jolting my head towards the sound of the noise, I looked around only to see nothing. In my head I blamed it on the wind, and proceeded inside. I headed up to my friend's bedroom, where everyone was hanging out. They greeted me and I changed into my pajamas before we all sat down and started talking and having fun. Eventually one thing led to another and we ended up playing truth or dare, a classic game to pass the time during a sleepover.

It started out like a normal game, with many of our friends choosing truth in order to prevent having to do something stupid in front of everyone else. At some point in the game, our friend Sammy chose to do a dare. Being the mean friend I was, I dared Sammy to run downstairs, go outside, and yell as loud as he could. Now ordinarily this wouldn't be too bad, until you remember that we were still in high school and Jess still lived with her parents, who by this point were long asleep.

So Sammy ran down to the backyard, and let out a half-hearted yell. We were all watching him from the window, and weren't satisfied with this, so we told him to do it again. He sighed and prepared for another, when he abruptly stopped and peered over to his right. He had, from what I could tell through the dark, a confused look on his face. I looked over at where he was looking, but couldn't see anything from the window.

Sammy slowly walked over out of view as we all intently watched. Pretty soon, he was out of view. After a few seconds, we heard rustling, the sound of which felt somehow familiar to me. We waited and waited, and after a minute or two, Sammy emerged. He walked almost robotically, but no one thought anything of it. We watched him walk inside, and we waited for him to come back upstairs.

We waited for about 30 seconds when we heard a crash. It wasn't too loud, almost as if someone had knocked over a glass full of silverware. "Shit" I thought. "Could Jess's parent's have heard him and intercepted him downstairs?"

I looked around at everyone and they all seemed to have the same look on their face. Jess headed out the door to go investigate. I heard her slowly going down the steps, and then heard her yell out, "What the actual FUCK Sammy???" Everyone giggled assuming that Sammy must have accidentally knocked something over. We all ran downstairs to see the commotion, when Daniel, who was in front of us all, stopped dead at the bottom of the stairs. I peered past the wall and saw what could only be described as pure hell. The room was pitch dark, except for two glowing eyes which belonged to Sammy. He was on all fours, looming over Jess's dead body, which he appeared to have been viscously ripping apart.

Everyone froze. I felt his eyes gazing at us. I could hear raspy breathing coming from him, and after a few seconds of being too shocked to move, one of us, I still can't remember who, let out a blood curdling scream. This seemed to set off Sammy, as I saw him charge towards us, almost galloping like a horse. We tried to run up the stairs, and me, being the last one in line on the way down, made it up first. I ran through the 2nd floor as fast as I could. I could hear the gruesome noises of bones shattering and flesh being ripped apart. I got to the nearest window I could find and jumped. I landed on my left leg, which instantly broke. I limped as fast as I could to my car, then started the engine and threw it in drive.

As I started pulling out, I saw the front door of Jess's house fling open and Sammy, still galloping, ran out. He started towards me, and I stepped on the gas, driving faster than I've ever driven before. He chased me for about 150 feet, before realizing he wasn't catching up and stopped. Watching him in the rearview mirror, I saw him head back to Jess's house. I drove home without looking back and went straight to bed.

It is now April 24th, the day of senior skip day. I still don't know how I managed to fall asleep and barely remember when or how I got home. I haven't come out of my room yet, nor have I spoken to anyone. I am documenting this in the case of being interrogated by police. I have been stalking news sites all morning but strangely haven't seen anything. I am scared to talk to anyone, and even more scared to head to school tomorrow....
