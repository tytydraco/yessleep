West Hollow had always been a town of the forest. The trees surrounded it like sentinels, their thick canopies swallowing the sky. The townsfolk carved their lives from the land, felling timber, cutting deep into the flesh of the valley to feed the sawmills. It had been this way for as long as anyone could remember.

But the land remembers further back.

Then the company came. Big money, big machines. The old growth was worth more than the town had ever seen, and the promise of wealth was too sweet to refuse. The elders protested. Mabel Carter, the town doctor, warned them of what the land could do. Alice Whitmore, the schoolteacher, found warnings in the old records. But money drowned out caution, and West Hollow took the deal.

The machines cut deeper than any axe, felling whole swaths in days rather than weeks. The ancient trees, their roots thick with untold history, crashed to the ground, and the land wept black sap in their wake. The townsfolk did not burn the stumps as their ancestors had done. The company laughed at the old ways, and in the face of fortune, the town let tradition die.

The first to see it was Gideon Bell, the blacksmith, though he could not name what he saw. It was the silence, first thick as pitch, pressing in around him as he hammered iron late into the night. The wind, once constant through the trees, had gone still. His breath clouded before him in the forge’s glow, and a sound, low and crawling, hummed beneath his feet. The ground, the very bones of the valley, groaned like an ancient thing shifting in its sleep. He stepped outside, hammer in hand, and looked toward the woods.

The trees did not move, but the spaces between them did.

Gideon was not a fearful man. But he locked his doors that night and did not sleep.

The next day, a boy was found at the edge of the woods, his body twisted like wet rope. Mabel Carter examined him in silence, her fingers tracing the unnatural bends in his limbs. There were no wounds. No signs of struggle. Only his face, frozen in a final, rictus scream, his mouth stretched too wide, his eyes black as pitch.

No one spoke of it, not properly. They buried him before sundown, as was the custom. But the whispers started that night.

Alice heard them first from her students. Small voices murmuring old words in the back of her classroom, words she had only seen written in the town’s oldest records. A nursery rhyme, she thought at first, until she listened closer. The cadence was wrong. Too old, too knowing. It was the story of the valley’s hunger, passed down from the tribes who had lived here before, long before West Hollow was ever cut from the land.

"The roots drink deep of blood and bone,
The earth is fed, the debt is known.
When trees grow tall, their hunger wakes,
Feed them fire, lest they take."

But the trees were gone. And something else had woken in their place.

Jacob Greaves, the constable, had no patience for stories. He had been called to the woods three times that week. Cattle slaughtered in their pens, great rents torn through the flesh of the valley itself, gashes in the earth that bled black sap. He rode out at dawn, rifle across his back, tracking what he could not name. The trees were wrong. Their bark, once smooth and straight, curled like withered skin. And the stumps, dear God, the stumps.

They moved.

At night, they shifted like things unsettled in their sleep, twisting, stretching, groping for the sky. He found one near the old mill, its roots pulsing, thick with something too dark for sap. And in the hollow of its center, the shape of a child’s face. Mouth stretched. Eyes black as pitch.

Still, the company refused to stop. "Superstition," they called it, even as men went missing, as machines rusted overnight, as the sky turned the color of old bruises.

It spread faster than they realized. The stumps festered, their sickness creeping into the remaining trees, into the very earth. By the time they understood, it was too late. The infection could not be contained. Even one seed, carried by the wind, could spell the doom of another town, miles upon miles away. The only answer was fire.

The fire began at the valley’s edge. They felled what trees remained and built the pyres high. Oil soaked the stumps, thick and black, seeping into the ground. The priest, old and shaking, recited words none of them understood as the flames took hold. The valley screamed. Not the wind, not the trees, something deeper.

The ground split open. Roots groped like fingers from the soil, blackened and writhing. Faces formed in the bark, shifting, stretching, mouths opening in silent howls. The sky turned red with smoke. The town burned with the forest.

By dawn, West Hollow was gone. Nothing remained but charred earth and silence.

And the valley slept once more.

And so, where once stood the valley of West Hollow, there remains only blackened earth and whispers on the wind. Those few who fled the flames do not speak of it by its old name, for that place is no more. Now, it is known only as The Burn. A land sown with fire, reaped by death, and left to the silence of the void.
