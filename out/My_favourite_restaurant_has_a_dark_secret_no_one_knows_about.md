(!!!this whole story is fake!!!)

 My favourite restaurant is a relatively small diner only around a kilometer from my home,whenever I'm too lazy to cook food I always just eat there,one day I decided to search them up,what I found was horrifying.

One day after I went to the diner to eat lunch since I was running low on supplies to cook I decided to search up the diner out of curiosity,after I returned home I went up to my room and searched the diner,all I saw was other restaurants similar to it until I scrolled across a suspicious article.

"Local diner accused of serving human flesh to customers" I got petrified,I clicked the article. "Studies conducted in 2015 at *censored* diner concluded that the meat the diner was serving was extremely similar to human meat..." I kept reading,my eyes flickering back and forth, frantically reading the article, according to the article, according to the article,people got suspicious of what they were eating 10 years from 2015 at 2005.

I've been eating at the diner since 2006,I finished reading the article,the last paragraph of the article being a tutorial on how to detect human meat,I closed my laptop and went to take a nap,after I woke up I checked my phone to see "5 pm",I quickly jumped up, remembering to test out the meat at the diner.

I quickly went into my car and drove to the diner,once I arrived I ordered the same thing I always ordered,after the food arrived i looked up the article and tested the meal,almost every number was right.

I returned the food,my appetite quickly faded once I knew I was maybe eating my own kind,i quickly went to my car, resisting my urge to gag.

7 hours later I tried to sleep but I just couldn't,I decided to investigate,I quietly walked to the diner,I noticed that no one was inside yet the door was open,it must be a mistake,I went inside and walked inside,I saw the door with the sign "storage room" written on it,I went inside to see a long set of stairs going down.

After I went down the stairs I used my phone's flashlight to see because without it I couldn't see anything,I turned to the right to see a fence,I pointed my phones flashlight to the front of the fence,what I saw made me gag.

Grotesque, bulbous,human-like creatures were standing in a small area,almost like pigs,they cried and called for help,after I saw them I ran up the stairs as quietly as I could,I ran out of the diner and once I was near my house,I called the cops,after 30 minutes they arrived,I went into my house and slept,since i didnt know what to do.

I woke up the next morning later then I usually do,I checked the news to see the same human like creatures being put down,along with the diner being shut down,all the people responsible for making the human like creatures were promptly arrested and everyone I know that has eaten at the diner has been confirmed to have no diseases or illnesses.

The situation may be solved,but I still get nightmares from time to time about that night.
