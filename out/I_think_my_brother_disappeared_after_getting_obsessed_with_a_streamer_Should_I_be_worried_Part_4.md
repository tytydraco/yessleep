Haven't really been feeling myself, but I wanted to keep you guys updated. You can check out part 3 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/IZBYj6vmOH)

I began ending my days by flipping through my brother’s journal. The words were clear, but their meaning was elusive, like trying to grasp smoke. Each page felt heavier than the last, tangled in metaphors and poetic musings that hinted at something just out of reach. I read anyway. It felt like an obligation, a way to understand him. But the deeper I went, the more I felt the sting of guilt.

The signs had been there—his late-night calls, the silence when I asked about his work—but I ignored them. I told myself it was just his way of being distant, that it wasn’t my place to press. Now I couldn’t stop wondering: If I’d asked more questions, would he still be here? Or had I always been too late?

When Caitlin’s stream would start, I found a strange sort of escape. Her countdown timer would blink on the screen, and my heart would race. I’d sink into the couch, laptop on the coffee table, and watch as her stream lit up the night. It was a ritual—a way to unwind, though it came at the cost of sleep.

Her streams followed a familiar rhythm. She’d start with lighthearted chatter, calling out usernames, and I’d stay quiet, letting the initial banter wash over me. But every now and then, her gaze would shift, and I’d swear her eyes caught mine through the screen. My username would appear, playful words teasing me to join the conversation.

At first, I resisted. I wasn’t the type to seek attention, but Caitlin had a way of pulling me in. Her questions felt personal, her tone inviting. And for a brief moment, I felt like I mattered—like I was part of something bigger.

The riddles became my favorite part of her streams. I told myself I didn’t care about being clever, that I wasn’t there to impress anyone, but when she posed a challenge, I couldn’t help myself. Her teasing jabs, playful yet pointed, only fueled the desire to answer correctly. It wasn’t just about solving the riddle. It was about being seen by her.

Her voice lingered long after the streams ended, a quiet hum in the back of my mind. Her laugh, her smile—they followed me through my day, reshaping my thoughts without my permission.

At the workbench, surrounded by tools and wood shavings, my focus wavered. I found myself daydreaming of her, picturing her walking into my workshop, her eyes lighting up at the sight of something I’d built. I imagined her asking questions, wanting to learn more about what drove me to create. It was ridiculous, of course. But in those moments, the fatigue of the day felt a little lighter.

Eventually, those daydreams crept into my work. I started altering my signature—a small “C” carved after my name, a quiet acknowledgment that, if Caitlin ever noticed me, I’d be ready.

The long days began to blur. My mistakes piled up—improper cuts, wasted materials, and a workbench cluttered with frustration. I told myself I’d clean it once the job was done, but the mess grew with every project.

One day, while nailing a shelf into place, my hand slipped. The wood split, and the nail bent. I removed it and stuffed it into my pocket, promising to fix the damage later. But as I held the broken board in my hands, I felt a surge of disappointment that I couldn’t shake.

That night, I tried to read my brother’s journal, but my mind was too tired to make sense of it. Instead, I lay down for a quick nap, fighting the guilt of setting aside my responsibilities. I told myself I needed the rest, that watching Caitlin’s stream was still part of my search. Her presence in the journal made her a clue, one I couldn’t ignore.

I woke hours later, disoriented. The room was dark, and a wave of unease prickled through me. I checked the time—Caitlin’s stream was about to start. I hadn’t missed it.

The laptop glowed on the coffee table, her countdown timer flashing on the screen. My pulse quickened as I whispered the seconds down. But something felt... off.

When the stream began, Caitlin’s usual warmth was gone. Her smile, once so inviting, felt hollow. Her energy, always so infectious, was muted. She went through the motions, but her heart wasn’t in it.

The stream dragged on, and I couldn’t sit still. For the first time, I wondered how I’d ever been able to watch for so long. She must have had a bad day too, I thought. She wasn’t untouchable—she was just another person.

That realization stung. I’d turned her into an idol without even realizing it. My daydreams felt foolish now, even shameful. I forced myself to finish the stream, not out of desire, but as penance for putting her on a pedestal she didn’t belong on.

Then something changed.

As I rubbed my eyes, trying to stave off the fatigue, I noticed my other hand in my pocket. My fingertips brushed against the nail I’d stashed earlier. Its cool, solid presence was comforting, grounding me in a way I couldn’t explain.

The laptop’s hum pulled my attention back to the screen. Caitlin had slumped forward, her gaze fixed on the chat window. Her eyes were bloodshot, her expression hollow. She looked... broken.

The chat buzzed with demands for her attention, fans begging for recognition, oblivious to her pain. Without thinking, I typed: “Are you okay? Get some rest.”

Her eyes flicked to the screen, locking with mine. For a moment, she held my gaze. Then, in a quiet, almost defeated voice, she told us she was ending the stream.

The video cut off abruptly, leaving the screen dark.

In the silence, her final words echoed in my mind, sharp and cutting.

“Well, aren’t you a clever one?”
