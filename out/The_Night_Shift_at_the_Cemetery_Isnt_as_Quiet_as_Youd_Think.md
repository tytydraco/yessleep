I work the night shift at a small cemetery just outside of town. It’s not a job many people want, but I like the peace and quiet. My responsibilities are mostly maintenance—keeping an eye on the place, making sure the gates are locked, and occasionally guiding visitors who come to pay respects after hours.

Last week, I started noticing something strange. It was a little after midnight when I heard the first sound—faint at first, like a distant bell. I brushed it off, thinking it was just a car passing by or maybe some kids messing around. But when it happened again, I knew it was coming from inside the cemetery.

I grabbed my flashlight and started walking toward the sound, heart pounding in my chest. The noise grew louder as I approached the oldest part of the cemetery, where the tombstones are so worn you can barely make out the names. And then, just as suddenly as it started, the sound stopped.

I stood there for a moment, straining to hear anything else, but there was nothing—just the rustling of leaves and the occasional chirp of a cricket. I was about to head back to my office when I saw it: a light, dim and flickering, coming from the far corner of the cemetery.

I knew that area well. It was where the mausoleum stood, a crumbling structure that hadn’t been opened in decades. I made my way over, every step feeling heavier than the last. The light grew brighter as I got closer, and when I finally reached the mausoleum, I saw that the door, which had been sealed shut for as long as I’d worked there, was slightly ajar.

I pushed the door open with a creak, and the light immediately went out. My flashlight flickered, then died completely, leaving me in total darkness. That’s when I heard the voice—whispering, low and urgent, as if it were right beside me.

I couldn’t understand what it was saying, but the tone was unmistakable: it was pleading. I felt a cold hand brush against mine, and instinctively, I stepped back, tripping over a loose stone and falling hard onto the ground.

When I looked up, the door was shut tight again. I scrambled to my feet and ran back to the office, not stopping until I was safely inside with the door locked behind me.

I haven’t gone back to that part of the cemetery since, and I don’t plan to. But every night since then, just after midnight, I hear the bell. It’s getting louder, closer. And last night, when I turned to leave, I swear I saw the outline of a figure standing at the edge of the trees, watching me.

I don’t know what’s going on, but I have a bad feeling it’s not over yet.

If anyone has any idea what this could be, or if you’ve experienced something similar, please let me know. I’m starting to think this job isn’t worth the peace and quiet after all.
