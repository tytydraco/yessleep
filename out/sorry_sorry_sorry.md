sorry, I couldn't keep them trapped. sorry i couldn't stop them. sorry they are now coming for you. sorry that not a single one you will survive. i am a scientist working in the artic... or i was at least before they came, no no they didn't come we brought them here. how i wish we didn't, how i wish they remained trapped there in whatever dimension or parraler plane the came from...

 i don't have much time so ill try to keep it short. i was a scientist working in a top secret facility in the artic funded by a three letter organisation that noone has heard or will ever hear except the people who rule the world like its their plaything, even speaking of this fact, of this organisation, of all of this would mean that my head would be blown off before i could finish the story and probably anyone who knew me and tried to raise awareness about my disappearance would disappear with me as well without a single trace 

but that doesn't really matter anymore they are all dead, no they are all changed.

 jake my boss gave us the order to do an experiment, an experiment trying to contact our loved ones that have passed away. we all felt that it was somehow wrong but the blank check and the insurance of so much money that our grandchildren wouldn't have to work made us forget all previous feelings of fasle morality. the experiment was going well, too well sometimes we would think but then we made contact... 

i- i- i don't know what that thing that we made contact with was but i know it wasn't any dead relatives nor any other wordly power, it wasn't heaven or hell but when we received a message on our screens it was nothing but a simple story all spelled in lower case letters, a simple but appealing story the first one that read it, his name was collin that poor bastard as soon as he reached the half way point of the story he became one of them, he started writing stories. novels, science fiction all of them in lower case letters of course, it was like these things couldn't write in capital letters. they can only write in lower case letters anyway the point is that im afraid that the things will start publishing these stories online... and then only god knows how many of us will become like them, you can feel it too can't you? they distand feeling of imminent destruction and death, death, death please be careful, please watch out for stories with all lower case letters...


 ok thats should be enough thank you for being so unaware, it was really that easy, haven't you been paying attention? all in lower case letters. all... in... lower... case... welcome brother. you are now one of us, or you will be in a couple of minutes.
