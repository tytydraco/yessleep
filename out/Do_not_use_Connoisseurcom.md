What I experienced does include some details that might make you uneasy, as though I tried not to go into too much detail, I did see a dead body and some blood; so if that’s too intense for you, just read the title, it doesn’t explain everything, but it should save you. Y’know, maybe it’s my fault. I mean, the signs were there, but that doesn’t matter. My life’s over, I’m done.  I mean, maybe it’s not, maybe it did leave, but I can’t take that risk. At this point, what do I have to live for? Then again, do I want to be caught by that thing? Sorry, I should probably explain the situation. I’m writing this from a library computer, and by the time this is read, I’ll probably be gone. I just wanted to post this online to warn everyone of what happened to me and my sister, so nobody else makes the mistakes that I did. Let me start at the beginning. 



My mother’s birthday was coming up in about a month, and so I decided to buy her a present. We’ve been kind of distant over the past few years since I moved out, but it was always a tradition to buy gifts for birthdays, even into adulthood, and I wasn’t going to break tradition. However, due to becoming distant, I wasn’t sure what her current interests were. I did remember she liked wine; she had always loved wine, so I decided to buy her a bottle of some, I mean, I wasn’t particularly wealthy, so I couldn’t afford anything too expensive, but I had some money to spend on wine for her. My sister was always the first to buy our mom a gift; she was always closer to her. Admittedly, it was she who gave me the idea to buy her some wine, or I thought it was her; It’s complicated, let me explain how I got the idea to get her wine. 



I went to my mom’s house. I thought it might be a good idea to talk, see what she likes now, and maybe get a hint about what to buy. I went to her house and noticed she had a package, and when I asked her about it, she said to bring it inside, so I did. It was from a company that I didn’t recognize at the time, who would’ve? Mina Vineyard, as far as I can tell, doesn’t even exist. From my later research, all I concluded was that the man behind the company owns a vineyard somewhere. I’m almost confident the name, Mina Vineyard, that sent the box was just a shell. 



Another interesting thing, and the part that actually stuck out first, was the logo, a cartoon drawing of a humanoid bull holding a martini glass forward in a sort of cheering position. So, yeah, we brought the box inside to see what was in it, and when we opened it, there was maybe a nice bottle of Syrah wine, I wouldn’t know, I’ve never been a wine person. The bottle was wax sealed, the top having the same logo seen on the box, and there was a faint red line down the inner top of the bottle. At the time, I just thought it was a style choice; wine bottles are typically styled as far as I’ve seen. Not an alcoholic person in general, really.



Also in the box was a well-preserved lamb leg in a vacuum-sealed bag surrounded by straw. The lamb itself was seasoned with a lot of stuff, though there was a little note explaining what all the seasonings were. That was a while ago, but from the top of my head, there was some garlic, rosemary, salt, pepper, and others that I forgot. The most striking part was a little letter, “For my dear mother, for all the love you put into helping me along, I thought I’d give you something I know you love, a nice wine; love, your little fox.” Little fox, that was the nickname for my sister; it’s good to know they were still close. 



Mom didn’t seem too surprised by the box, though; something about her demeanor did seem off. So, I asked if she was expecting the box, and she showed me a text from my sister, “Hey, ma’ma, in preparation for your birthday, I did order a box, but it might come a bit early. Can’t control the delivery company, unfortunately, so enjoy it when you get it. Love you.” I think the important thing wasn’t the message itself, but the lack of a follow-up, because we both seemed to have the same suspicion. So, I asked if she was going to call her, and she said that she had. 



My sister was always busy, but, according to my mom, even she didn’t “ghost her family.” Concerned as I was, I offered to go check on her in person, and surprisingly, for me, anyway, she said she’d come with me. So, I drove us over to my sister’s house and checked on her. Those screams, that crying; I didn’t think my mother was capable of sounding like that. I was sad too, of course. I looked closer to figure out how exactly she died, bruising around the legs and arms, markings typical of being bound, and on the side of her neck, a faint line of dried blood. 



I was quick to call the cops, and they were there around 10 minutes later. However, before then, I had decided to look around myself, and on the computer, it appeared like she was looking at a wine review, “B.R: 2015 Naoussa Syrah: Best paired with seasoned leg of lamb, E.M season blend preferred with added rosemary and salt. Rating: 89/100. Thank you for your purchase; I hope you're satisfied.” Under that was a section detailing delivery details, saying that it had been delivered an hour before I had visited my mom.



The phone had seemingly fallen under her desk, and my mom opened the phone, even I could've guessed the password. It opened to her messages, “It says it will be delivered tomo-” It was cut off; she never got to finish it. I would go forward to the event that ruined everything, but I would like to say before I do that, when the cops arrived, one of them seemed to stare at me, from the amount of times I saw him swallow during our brief encounter before I left my mom to talk to the police so I could gather myself, he was likely salivating a lot, and knowing what I know now, did he know I was going to use the site? That officer had to be him; it didn’t look like him, but it couldn’t have been a coincidence. The next important thing that happened was later that night, though before I went back to my house, I hung around my mother’s a little longer; I didn’t want to leave her alone after all that, but she urged me to stay at my house.



While I was at her house, we drank the wine and ate the lamb in the box, well, my mom drank the wine, she didn’t seem to love it though, apparently she preferred white wine. She did call my uncle to stay at her house with her for a bit so she wouldn’t be alone. I still hadn’t ordered any wine, so I looked up good wines and gifts, but I wasn’t sure what to make of any of the stuff I was seeing. There were professional consultations to try to find the best wine for her, but everything was very expensive. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for, I wanted to get her a good wine, especially after what happened, I didn’t want to risk paying for a consultation and then it being wrong, so I looked elsewhere for professional opinions and that’s where I found Connoisseur.com, it was cheaper, not too cheap, but cheaper for sure, and it offered discounts, “If you’re not satisfied, it’s your money’s back. This statement is legally binding.”



I saw the logo and realized it was the same company that my sister used, and that helped my fears a bit. I had seen their work firsthand, and they seemed to know what they were doing, as evidenced by the box. Then again, my sister also knew more about wine than I did, but it was my best shot. So, I took the risk and filled it out. It asked some standard questions. Preferred Wine Type: I wasn’t really sure, so I just put white. Flavor: I said, unsure. Want pairing recommendations? I said yes, it was only a dollar extra. Some more personal information that I don’t want to share on here, and finally, my card. 



With everything filled out, I made the order, and they said they’d do a background check to ensure we were of age and allowed to have the wine, and if we weren’t, we’d be refunded. After a few minutes, it said we were cleared and said they’d get back to me in three days. Over the next few days, I started smelling the scent of flowers and grapes more frequently around places I went, which I didn’t think much about at the time. I had lost my house key one morning; I had always kept it in one of my flower pots, and it did briefly freak me out, but I did later find it that night under the rug under my front door, where I had assumed it had fallen when I had come inside the previous day. Two days later, the cops gave a statement about my sister, claiming what was already pretty obvious: due to the lack of evidence of a fight around the house and the fact that the door was unlocked normally, it was probably someone close to her. 



They also concluded she was killed, ruled her death a homicide, and said they would begin looking for her killer; they would never find him. It rained on the third day, and so that night it was wet, and as I was watching a show to help me sleep. I thought I heard something outside my window, and so I tried to look and, upon touching the curtains, I heard what sounded like hooves moving away from my window, which has happened before; the house isn’t too far from a farm, and sometimes a cow or two gets out. It was dark out, so I couldn’t see much, but I went out with my phone to take a picture so I could send it to the owner. I heard a noise next to my car, and when I took the picture with the flash, I saw hoof prints and the head of a cow behind my car, peaking at me, its neck bent 90 degrees to not bump my car with its horns, which was only like ten steps away.



If I were more awake at the time, I probably would’ve realized that there were only six hoof prints leading behind the car. I sent the photo to the owner and realized that it was probably unhealthy, as something about its neck seemed off. As I was putting my phone away, I received an email and pulled it up. It was from the website, saying that they’d narrowed down a few potential wine choices, and would reach back in two days for the final consultation before I get the wine. However, aside from that email, I noticed a few others from my sister. 



The most recent one was simply a bull peering into her house through her window, in a dark night only illuminated by the phone’s flash. I almost completely scrolled past the email until I looked at the caption, “Would’ve loved to hear your voice one last time.” I stared at that message for a while. For once in a long while, I was genuinely sad; I was less sad seeing her dead body than I was reading that. I kept staring as it slowly dawned on me that she knew she was going to die. That realization snapped me back to reality, and I scrolled through more of her emails, repeated images of that same bull head poking out from behind corners and objects, and mentions of the smell of wine. 



The second-to-last email she sent me was different, just one little screenshot of an email she was sent by the website, announcing they were almost ready to give their final thoughts and complete the transaction. It was while I was looking through the emails that I got a message back from the farmer, saying he wasn’t missing any cows and telling me to go check on that bull because, judging by the picture, it may have snapped its neck. Given this information, I went into the kitchen to grab a knife and went back to take another look at the bull; however, when I turned on the porch light to look outside, it was gone. I went out to look and found nothing; the bull had disappeared. I locked myself in my room for the rest of the night and eventually fell asleep.



The next day, I did more investigating into the company and found almost nothing related to Connoisseur.com or Mina Vineyard. There was, however, a video shoot, a promo for a vineyard and wine manufacturer whose name was obscured; it didn’t show much. There was the man, dressed in a brown tuxedo with a bowtie, gloves, and dress shoes; something weird I spotted was that his gloves seemed a bit loose on the sides, like there was more room in them. It showed he had a room filled with nicely made bottles of wine, all of a similar style to the bottle of Syrah wine, and all with a similar naming pattern shown on nice golden plaques with a grapevine-style border. Another important part of the video was a large painting of a Greek God, Dionysus, with a plaque under it in Greek, “Ζήτω ο πατέρας μου.” Which, as far as I can tell, translates to “Long live my father.”



Of course, there were a few ways I could take that information, first, it’s not connected to the website and bull sightings, second, it is connected and is symbolic like some hidden Greek wine cult worshipping Dionysus, or third, it is connected, it’s not symbolic and me and my sister were being hunted by an actual demigod, which would also mean Greek mythology was real, and knowing what I know now, I’m leaning towards the third, though at the time, that felt far fetched and I went with the second. I was thoroughly convinced I had accidentally gained the attention of some modern Greek mystery cult, which killed my sister for some reason and was now watching me. I could’ve gone to the police, but remembering that creepy officer, I figured they could be infiltrated. I started looking for any more reported cases of incidents like this and found nothing. My leading theory is that they were covered up.



I didn’t really have anybody else to call; the police were likely compromised, my mom wouldn’t believe me, why would she? I didn’t have really any friends either. I considered running away, and I suppose I eventually did, but I decided to stay just until I was sure my mom was safe. I mean, if I were really being hunted by a cult, I could maybe get them off my back with an offer. Dionysis is the Greek god of wine, after all; maybe I could try to give them wine in exchange, I thought, so I ordered a lot of wine. Cheap stuff, but maybe it could save me. Along with those, I also bought some cameras and put them around my house. 



You’ve got to understand, I was scared, I was panicking, I wasn’t thinking straight,  so I bought a lot of wine and cameras and waited for the delivery, and waited. The final day, I was still trying to figure out what to do, maybe I was overreacting, maybe it was all fake, there was no cult, she was just killed by some random killer, maybe I wasn’t being targeted or maybe the killer was just waiting for the moment to kill those close to their victim, maybe I wasted my money on all that wine. All I knew was that my sister was killed after being restrained for an indefinite amount of time, she was seeing a bull watching her for the days leading up to her death, and on her final day, she got a message from the website, maybe they weren’t connected, and it was just a coincidence. Early that final day, I received a package from Mina Vineyards, a nice bottle of white wine, much smaller than a normal bottle, seemingly a sample, and a message with the box saying, “Please enjoy a free sample of our finest wine while we finish your order.” It wasn’t long afterwards that my mother called me, informing me that she too had received a small bottle of white wine, and thanked me for ordering her some, especially after what happened. 



In hindsight, I probably should’ve warned her, but I didn’t, she had never really thanked me before, and I saw no harm in the bottle, the autopsy that the police gave didn’t show poisoning, which I guess, could’ve been a lie, but I think it’s more likely to slit on her throat was what killed her, not poison. Poison didn’t seem like this cult’s method; I shouldn’t have assumed. Most of that day, I sat and thought about what to do if they showed up for me, and as I was thinking, I looked at the bottle that was sent to me, it didn’t have the signature red stripe on the top that the Syrah in the box and the others in the video had, and I thought back to the crime scene, with the dried blood going down my sister’s neck. As I thought about it, I took a knife from my drawer, lightly cut my finger, and let the blood trickle down the top of the bottle; it looked almost identical to the other bottles. As it dawned on me, I frantically called my mom, but she didn’t pick up; my uncle did. 



I asked him why she didn’t answer, and he said that she must not have slept well last night because she was out cold. I couldn’t get into specifics, he’d ask questions, and I didn’t have time for that, so I just told him to throw away the Syrah she was storing in her cabinet and to take her to the hospital because I thought she might have been poisoned; he was confused, but the tone of my voice seemed to do a good enough job convincing him, as he obliged and took her. An hour later, I think it could’ve been earlier, hard to remember specifics, I received an email, “Thank you for your patience, we should have your rating and pairing suggestions sometime by the end of the day; thank you for your purchase with Connoisseur.com.” For the next several hours, I hid in my room with a knife; I could’ve driven away sooner, but I was worried about leaving my house, maybe they’d start tailing me, or they’d try to shoot me, or any other number of potential dangers, so instead, I hid. As it became night, I heard a knock on my door, so I pulled up the camera app to see who it was. 



It was the guy from the video, the guy who owned the vineyard, wearing a nice brown suit with a bowtie, and what, I think, was a bowler hat, as well as a large duffel bag on his shoulder. Over the camera, I heard him yell, “Hello, could you help me? I was wondering if you had seen a bull around here? I was delivering them to the nearby farm, and I think one got out of the trailer. I’d hate for them to have gotten hurt.” When I didn’t answer, I swear I could see him smirk as he took out a key, identical to my own, out of his suit pocket and unlocked the door. 



As he stepped inside, he quietly closed the door before setting the duffel bag on the floor. He took out a scalpel and several straps and put them into his suit pockets. He then took off his shoes and gloves and placed them to the side. After taking a deep breath, he changed. His face stretched, horns began growing out of his head, smooth fur spread across his body, a tail grew behind him, and from underneath his socks, his feet became cloven as did his hands, though after a few seconds, his hands split two more times across each half of each hand, resulting in his hand hooves becoming six finger-like appendages. As the transformation finished, he put back on his gloves, which now seemed to fit perfectly. He took in a long, deep sniff before turning and walking directly in front of my bedroom, before he proceeded to open the door. 



As I was hiding behind my dresser, he’d have to come a bit into my room to actually see me, especially given that he wasn’t looking at the dresser. He moved closer to my bed and seemed surprised when I wasn’t in it; as he began to sniff again, I snuck up behind him and prepared to stab him in the middle of his neck, but that failed whenever his tail brushed against my leg. He turned as I plunged the knife forward, the knife instead stabbing into the side of his neck, cutting where his carotid should’ve been, but he didn’t bleed. At least, he didn’t bleed normal blood; it was so much quicker, less viscous, a flowing trail of gold coming from his neck. Following the stab, he kicked me hard, knocking me into the dresser. 



I stood in shock as the knife remained stuck in the side of his neck, and he just stared at me; his brown eyes turning black. Before I even knew what was happening, I ran, I ran as fast as I could, and I managed to go out my back door, which was closer to my bedroom, before he grabbed my arm. When I turned back to look at him, I saw the wound on his neck already mostly healed. He put his hands around my throat, strangling me, until I heard a car come into my driveway. This also made him pause, as he took a sniff before throwing me to the ground. 



He said something, it took me some translating, but it roughly sounded like, “Sas efcharístos gia metá to dóro, Patéra.” This was just an estimate; I don’t speak Greek. I just remembered what it sounded like he said, and put it through some translation programs to try and find something similar. As far as I could tell, assuming I got the words right, he said something along the lines of, “Thank you for the gift, Father.” He then ran out of my backyard, as I heard the sounds of the car that had driven near, driving away quickly. I sprinted over to my car, which meant I had to follow him a bit, and as I hopped into my car, turned it on, and began to drive, I heard a loud crash, followed by screaming, and then a delivery truck, clearly damaged, returning to my house. 



As I briefly thought it had decided to leave me alone, I took a breath and slowed down; I almost immediately regretted that decision as I heard loud and quick steps running towards my car, and I could see in my rearview, the bull on all fours, sprinting at me. I sped up, luckily, due to it being late and outside of the city, the road was mostly empty, so I kept driving, faster and faster, seeing the bull continuing to pursue me. Looking into the mirror, I failed to notice a turn coming up, and I drove off the road and into the forest. I soon crashed hard into a tree and was knocked out. It was only a few minutes before I woke up, and I saw in my dazed state, the bull, looking around the forest for a few minutes, as I struggled to get out of the car, before he turned and left the forest. 



A few moments afterward, I got a notification on my phone, which was in my pocket, it was from Connoisseur.com, and it read, “We’re sorry, we missed you. We regret to inform you that we have failed to properly review your wine request. As a result, we are issuing a full refund, which you should receive within the next few days. If you would like us to try again with your request, please click the link below to request we try again with your request, free of additional charge.” I meant to close the email, but with my distorted vision and headache from the crash, I misclicked and opened the link. When I did that, I didn’t realize immediately, until my screen showed a green checkmark with a caption reading, “Request acknowledged.”



I managed to get out of my car, and I ran, I ran and I ran, and I ran. That was a month ago. I abandoned my phone in a dumpster at the back of some restaurant, and I ran. I had a good amount of physical cash in my car; I tended to, especially given my obsession with going to places I shouldn’t have in my youth, take a cut of my paycheck and withdraw it from the bank as physical money. I’ve been running, taken a few quick odd jobs just to make sure I have money, but I never stay in one place long. 



I don’t know if it’s still following me. From the library computer I’m using, I was allowed to log in with my account. I haven’t received an email, but maybe it stopped. I haven’t smelled the floral wine scent in a while, but occasionally I still see what I think is that brown tuxedo, and I feel he’s still chasing me. I looked up the website again, just to confirm the URL, but it seems to have disappeared, so either it was taken down or they changed their name; all emails I got from them have also vanished. So, maybe it is safe, but I’m not risking that. I’ll keep running, I don’t know if I will ever stop; do I even have anything to live for anymore? 



That’s all I have to say. I’ve gotta go now, looking out of the window, I currently see that tuxedo heading over to the entrance, so I’m getting out of here. Please, if you ever see the website Connoisseur.com or something that seems similar to what I described, don’t use it. Please stay safe, everyone; let my experience serve as a warning, please.
