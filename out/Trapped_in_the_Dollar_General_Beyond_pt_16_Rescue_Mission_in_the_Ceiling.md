Well, it has been an interesting little bit, but I finally made it back.


Sorry for not updating. My phone wouldn't work in the ceiling and I'm honestly not sure how long I was up there. Sometimes when I think about it, it seems like weeks. Sometimes it seems like it was only a few hours. Despite all that, it always seems like a long dark dream that I woke up from before it was over.


You know, that kind of hazy half-remembered way you remember things sometimes.


Anyway, you don't care about that. 


You wanna know what happened up there.


So Buddy and I went into the ceiling to try and find Gale. I had something of his from before we had separated, and a quick sniff sent Buddy on his way. He was eager to go, and I don't know whether he had done this sort of thing before or not. Maybe it was the dreams we had been sharing, and he was as desperate to find Gale as I was. 


It was exactly like my dreams, the whole place like a photo negative that just went on forever. It probably doesn't do it justice, but it was like a whole other Dollar General Store up there. It was and wasn't like the other stores I had been to. It was stocked with weird monochrome copies of things, but the shelves went on and on forever. It was this odd black-and-white liminal space that extended into oblivion, and it was even stranger than the Outside.


Buddy was on the trail from the moment we touched down. I was expecting that he would take on the same characteristics of the space, but he was a distinct contrast. He was a big black and white collie, I supposed, with a little brown mixed in for good measure. He stood out against the backdrop like easter grass in a Halloween Diorama. I suppose I must have as well, and I crouched a little as I went along. I didn't want to be seen by the Miasma that made this place their home, and the deeper in we went, the more I could feel their presence. 


It was like smog, and it seemed to waft around like a lingering presence. It hung in the air, smelling acrid, and it was a different color from the other dark neon. You wouldn't have thought there could be so many shades of black, but the presence left behind by the Miasma was velvety and slightly thicker than the flat black of the store. The closest I can come to explaining it is the puppet shows they would put on at the library when I was small, and they would put felt on the background. The felt stood out a little more, and it was something like that.


I know most of this probably isn't making sense to you guys, but the photo negative space isn't a spot that makes a whole lot of sense in the first place.


The Outside had plants, wildlife, and an ecosystem.


This place reminded me of a graphic novel drawn in pencil. Everything was hyper-realistic, everything was very detailed, but it ultimately looked flat, like your hand would bump it if you reached out to touch it. Buddy didn't seem to notice any of this, and he walked with his head down and his tail wagging as he followed a trail only he could see.


It was here that I began to think we might not be as alone as we thought we were. 


We rounded a corner, Buddy still moving following his trail, when I nearly ran into someone. They were like this place, a black and white copy of someone I had never met, but they were moving around the aisle and reaching for things on the shelf. It was an older woman, dressed in a shall and a floral print dress, and she was utterly ambivalent to me. I reached towards her, wanting to see if she was solid, and as my hand bumped against her, she shuddered and looked around as if someone had called her name. 


Buddy barked them, jumping a little as if telling me to hurry, and I was forced to move on as he led me deeper into the infinite store.


We encountered others as we went, men and women and even a few children who were moving up and down the rows of products. Some of them looked scared, others seemed to be thinking this was a temporary thing like I had, but all of them were the same flat black and white of the stores. How many Dollar Generals were there in the loop? How many people were stuck here, just trying to survive as they figured this place out? I had only seen Gale, the Hermit, and Celene since I arrived, but it was possible there could be any number of others here just trying to find their way. Buddy ignored all of them, moving toward his intended target with laser precision. 


We didn't meet our first Miasma for a little while, but the first one nearly ended our trip.


We had been moving between aisles, Buddy's enjoying his unhampered run, when he suddenly came up short. Some of his exuberance left him and as I moved up beside him I saw what had gotten his fur up. Lumbering between the aisles, its head far up where the ceiling should be, was a Miasma. It wasn't as large as the ones I had seen in the Outside, but it was bigger than either Buddy or I. It didn't seem to see us, making its way ponderously along, and as it disappeared down another shadowy row I decided it might be time to use the leash. I couldn't lose Buddy in here, Celene would never forgive me, and though he didn't want to be on leash, he seemed to understand the need.


I don't know how long we traveled, but it felt the same way that traveling the stores did. You could travel the stores as slowly or quickly as you wanted, but you never quite knew how much time had passed. Traveling the Ceiling didn't make me feel tired, it didn't make me hungry, and aside from needing to stop for a few minutes after a particularly long run I didn't get winded either. I felt like I could go for days, but I knew that there had to be an end in somewhere.


Buddy and I knew where we were going, and when we came to a small park in the middle of the infinite store, I knew we had found the spot.


It was beautiful, a park made of crystalline trees that stretched towards the sunless ceiling as they reached for whatever lay up there. Buddy went sniffing up the path, marking one of the trees before moving up the path toward the next. I wasn't sure what he was looking for, but I had a hunch that it had something to do with Gale. In my dreams, he had been floating off the ground. Maybe these crystals were keeping him aloft. It wouldn't be the oddest thing I had ever seen in here, and the more I looked at them, the more they made me think of a conversation I'd had with a friend once.


It was a conversation that seemed to have taken place a million years ago now, but I could still remember the light reflecting through the facets of the gem when I held it up to the light.


Her name had been Candace, and I would be lying if I said I hadn't been trying to sleep with her. She was into witchy stuff, crystals, and tarot cards and things, and she had been explaining how you could store energy in crystals. She always sat hers out in the sun to recharge, but she claimed that other people could put energy into them too, and you could pull it out later.


"Human beings are just big batteries at the end of the day, and their energy is unique."


These didn't look a lot like her crystals, but I supposed crystals were crystals at the end of the day. 


The way they reached towards the sky made me think about the infinite store that existed around them, and wonder what kind of energy they were drawing in. Could this be some sort of battery for the stores? Maybe it was one of many. Maybe it was just one more odd thing amongst a sea of odd things. My barometer was a little unreliable these days and looking at them made me realize how numb I had become to all of this. There was a time when I would have stared in awe at these things, but now they were just one more attraction on my road trip of strange.


If I did get out, how would I return to the world I had known after something like this?


I guess I would have to escape to find that out. 


Buddy must have found what he had been looking for because he suddenly jumped up onto one of the crystal trees and started barking frantically. His barks were deep, but confused as he butted his head against the surface hard enough to worry me that he would hurt himself. I tried to pull him off, but he came back to the spot right away. I squinted at it, thinking there might be something inside, and when I leaned in close, I saw what appeared to be half a person floating inside there.


Half may not be the right description, but it's the best I've got. There was a right arm, a left leg, some of a torso, and a whole head. It wore glasses, the face bristling with gray hair as it smiled warmly into the distance. It appeared to be dreaming, the face twitching now and again, and in its hand was clutched a red leash. It all floated within the crystal, and I wondered if this was the man who had written the message on the bulletin board that I had first seen in Gale's store.


Border Collie named Buddy. Black and white with some brown. Blue bandana around neck. Very sweet. Good service dog. Would love to see him again. 


"Come on, Buddy," I said, the dog still jumping up against the crystal, "I'm not sure there's anything we can do for him. Gale might still be salvageable, though, if we hurry."


Buddy whined as he looked back at the crystal, and before my eyes, I saw the hand holding the leash begin to disintegrate. It was like watching something slowly being dissolved, and when it was gone the leash floated off into the depths of the black rock. I thought Buddy was going to stick for a minute and I would have to drag him a little, but then he gave the crystal a single lick and headed off on Gale's trail again.


As we moved amongst them, I wondered if all of these crystals contained people. There were so many of them here, too many to inspect if we wanted to save Gale, and the deeper we went, the smaller they became. The crystals at the start towered to the ceiling, but the ones near the back were more like young spruces and pines. They had a few "limbs" on them, and when Buddy barked and put on a burst of speed, I saw the first of the seedlings. 


Seedlings was a nice way of saying people who were slowly being overtaken by rock. 


One of them was too far gone, his body mostly encased, and another had only an arm and a leg hanging out of the rock. They didn't move or acknowledge us, but I could see the fingers of one twitching as we came near. They were definitely alive in there, and I shuddered to think that something like that could happen to me.
On the ground, amidst a small collection of rocks, was Gale. He was lying on the ground, but the crystals had lifted him slightly as they grew. He was in the same pose I had seen in my dream, and his left calf and right arm were the only things covered in glass. I called his name, leaning down to open one of his eyes, and as the eyeball rolled to find me I knew he was still alive. His lips trembled like he was trying to say something, and as I set to work freeing him I told him to hold on and that we would talk once he was loose.


I hadn't been sure what to expect, but luckily I had thought to bring a hammer and a saw. The hammer made quick work of the half-formed crystals, sending jagged bits flying in all directions, and as his arm came free, I started on his leg. Buddy was standing by, cocking his head as he made a worried keening noise, and when Gale was finally free, I got under his arm and found only dead weight in response. 


Gale was in no shape to move himself, and after some deliberation, I left the backpack behind and pulled him up onto my back. I was a little bigger than Gale, thankfully, but he was solid and I wasn't sure how long I was going to be able to carry him like this. I took hold of Buddy's leash and told him to take us home, but that's when we got caught.


We had no sooner started moving when everything went dark.


Pitch black would be a better word for it, but all the light in the area suddenly went out and we were left in total darkness. Buddy was still pulling at my hand, his nose not blind, and I put a hand out in front of me as I moved without sight through the crystal garden. I had to be careful, any one of those trees could have stabbed me through by a jagged branch, but it was the darkness that scared me more than anything.


The darkness always meant Miasma were about, and though I couldn't see them, I was pretty certain they could see me. 


We came briskly to the shelves, me bumping my shin against one as we came out of the garden, and that was when I heard the scream of the beast. It was answered by another, and another, and suddenly the ground shook with their passage. They were looking for me, looking for their prize that I had stolen, and as I followed my four-legged guide, I kept my hand out and a firm grip on my passenger. 


Buddy came up short a second before there was a loud boom and I felt the air rush past as something fell in front of us. Buddy barked in fright, and when he pulled me forward, something passed over my head, catching on the hat I was wearing and taking it with it. I was never sure how close I came to getting my head swiped off by a Miasma, but it had to be pretty damn close. 


We kept moving, buddy taking us down one corridor after another, and the sound of loud footsteps was constantly behind us.  


When we stopped for a minute, two of them passing on the aisle behind us, I heard someone grunt and felt movement as Gale squirmed a little. 


"What's going on," he rasped, "Why can't I see?"


I breathed a sigh of relief as I put him shakily onto his feet.


He had been pretty heavy.


"It's me. I came to rescue you, but the lights went off after I got you out. We gotta be quiet, they're looking for us."


He made a sound somewhere between a chuckle and a sigh, "Just my luck."


As the thunderous footsteps passed, I grabbed his hand and told Buddy to lead us on. We daisy-chained our way through the aisles as we avoided the loudest of the footsteps, and after a while, the lights came on as suddenly as they had gone out. We were standing in the middle of the Home Decor section, and it was a mishmash of wall signs and those little shelves people use for knick-knacks. Buddy seemed a little lost, running in circles as he tried to find whatever he was looking for, and I had time to take a real look at Gale. He wasn't looking great, his skin pale as his muscles slack as he stood sagging beside me. He looked like he hadn't slept in days, or eaten a good meal, and he was utterly drained from whatever the crystal had been doing to him.


"I hope you know the way, he rasped out, "because your dog looks a little lost."


I looked at Buddy but was far from reassured. He was scratching at the floor and hopping around excitedly, and I started to get nervous. We had to get back. Gale needed a couple of meals and about a week of sleep, and until we got out of the ceiling we weren't likely to get either. I tried to get Buddy back on track, but he just kept barking and scratching at the floor.


I bent down to try and calm him a little, and that's when I saw it.  


There was light peeking up through a little slit on the floor.


It wasn't the weird lack of light here either, but a harsher, more real light. It was coming up from the floor, and when I poked a finger through it, I looked down into a familiar burnt-out store. It was near the front, where the ceiling tiles were broken up, and rubbed Buddy's head as I realized what he had been trying to tell us.


"Good dog," I whispered into his fur, "VERY good dog."


When I looked up from the petting, however, I saw that we had found the hole just in time.


Fifty feet down the aisle, looking at us as if not able to believe what it was seeing, was a huge Miasma.


It had taken three big steps, eating up the ground, when I scooped up Buddy and told Gale to follow me.


I jumped on the opening and grimaced as I landed badly on my ankle when I hit the tiles.
I was back in the Dollar General Beyond, and as Gale landed heavily beside me, I helped him up and we made a run for the bathroom.


The Miasma had jumped, missing us as it lunged by seconds, and as it tried to slide out of the ceiling and into the store, we were already booking it for the exit. I pushed the door open, grabbing Gales's hand as I thought about Celene's safe house. Buddy was whining against my shoulder, Gale staggering a little as we passed through, and we all fell in a heap inside the well-lit safety of Celene's home store.


We laughed as she came running over, realizing we had made it.


We had been in the ceiling and lived, and I had come back with Buddy and Gale.


Gales resting now. He ate enough food for five people and then promptly passed out. He hasn't said much about his time up there, but I'm sure he will. He was exhausted, and I watched him start to fall asleep into his dinner a few times as he ate. I gave him my pallet for the night and started building another one when Celene came up.


She had the Hermit's journal in her hand and looked a little unsure of how to start.


"I owe you an apology, kid." 


I told her it was fine, but she shook her head.


"No, really. I told you that there was no end to this place, belittled you for thinking there was, but I was wrong."


She opened to the part of the journal where he talked about the snowy store that came before the midnight store with all the Miasma in it.


"I've been here before. It was near where I found Buddy, and I remember stopping at that door like it was a physical barrier. I never went through it, but it sounds like Jasper did. Whatever is beyond that store is likely our ticket out of here, and I think it's where we should go to check."


I nodded, but when Gale's voice quavered up from behind us, I felt a cold chill run up me.


"I've seen it too, that place. It's where you rescued me from, and it's where the Miasma store the power source for this place. The people they take into the ceiling are being used to power the Dollar General Beyond.
