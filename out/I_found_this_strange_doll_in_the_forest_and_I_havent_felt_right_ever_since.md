To preface this story, I’m a plant biology student at my local college, so I like to take nature walks to keep my plant identification skills sharp. This morning, I was on one of my nature walks looking around a large oak tree when I noticed a strange object directly in the center of what seemed to be a red spray painted circle. Of course, me being the idiot I am I decide to investigate immediately.

I walked over to the object and noticed it seemed to be some sort of doll, made of tightly woven sticks and what looked to be hair. I backed away disgusted, and decided that was enough “investigating” for the day.
However, the closer I got back to home the more I couldn’t stop thinking about the doll, so foolishly I turned around to retrieve it. 
I got back to the doll, picked it up, and tossed it in my bag, and started to head back to my apartment. 

After finally making it back to my apartment, I pulled the doll out of my bag, and placed it on my kitchen table. The long walk through the forest absolutely demolished my energy, so I decided to pull a frozen pizza out of the freezer and heat it up. Not so patiently waiting for the pizza to be done, I wound up staring at the doll. There was something off about it, other than the fact it had what I assumed was human hair in it, and I found it in the middle of the forest. Just as I started to get lost in thought about the doll, the timer on my oven started to ring.

I waltzed over to the oven and pulled out the pizza, my mouth watering as the hunger started to overcome me. I sat down and pulled up a video on my phone, as I refuse to eat without entertainment. Just as fast as I took a bite out of the pizza, I spit it out. Something tasted awful about it, I mean sure it’s no gourmet meal, but I’ve had plenty of frozen pizzas and none that tasted this foul. I played it off as I just must’ve got an old pizza or something. I poured a glass of water from the tap and took a sip to wash the nasty taste from my mouth, but the water tasted just as vile. I started to panic, and grabbed anything that was half way edible from the pantries and fridge and all of it tasted horrid. Just as I started to vomit from the horrendous taste of the combinations of ‘food’ I had just eaten, I started to hear what seemed to be the sound of snapping twigs coming from the kitchen table. I looked over and gasped in fear as I noticed a mouth start to form on the face of the doll. As soon as the mouth on the doll seemed to complete, my mouth instantly seemed to dry out, it was so dry if I moved my tongue it started to crack and bleed. I sprinted to my bathroom to see if I could notice a difference in my mouth, I got to the mirror and fell on my knees in horror. My mouth has lost all color everything from my lips to my throat had turned a drab gray color. 

I started to cry at the sight of my mouth and the astronomical pain I was enduring, the tears streaming down my face started to get thicker and thicker, I wanted to stand up to look into the mirror but stayed down out of fear of what I would witness. 
After around 2-3 minutes I started to lose vision in my left eye, and my tears were the consistency of gravy. I had to stand and look just to soothe the feeling of curiosity and fear. I stood up and noticed what seemed to be mud pouring from my eyes, my heart sunk to the bottom of my stomach. I made my way back to the kitchen, and just as I had thought, the doll started to form “sockets” right above where the mouth had formed. 

I’ve decided to use what I think are my last few minutes of vision to write this out, and post it on whatever media platforms I can before I lose the ability to see. If you’re ever wandering through the forest and stumble upon a doll, I strongly advise you to head the other direction.
