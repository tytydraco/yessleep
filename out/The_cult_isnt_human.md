My name is Tracey Butser , I'm 33 years old and work as a private investigator. I've been in this business for 12 years and have solved countless cases of cheating partners and murders but.......This is different, Different than anything I've seen so far.


It all started when I took the case of Britney Ralts , A girl who's seemingly been missing for the past few months. Her parents seem to have contacted the government and police but it was of no help.


I started looking for clues with my assistant , Ray. First I asked Ray to get information on that girl.


Britney Ralts

17 years old

High school student

Doesn't have any friends

Spends most of her time studying and in parks

Last seen at home before leaving for the central park, Has been missing since.


It wasn't alot of information but enough to start looking. We first went to her school to ask her schoolmates about her possible whereabouts.


"She was an A-grade student, Always on top of class"


"She was a loner , Never talked to anyone and used to sit by herself in a corner"


"Who's that?"


Out of everyone we asked , One testimony stuck out from the rest.


"She was a weirdo , I once saw her reading a weird book with weird symbols inscribed on it"


"What book?" I asked


"As if I'd know"


Another dead lead. Well next up is the central park where she was last seen , We're sure to find some clues there.


We reached Central park and it was quite a normal park at first glance , Nothing weird going. That was until I noticed a poster with some weird rules written on it.


"The UDA?" I asked


"Do you not know?" Ray asked me


I replied with "no"


"Well it's supposed to be an organization fighting against some creepy supernatural creatures called unnaturals, They post rules like this" Ray said


"Do you actually believe in that crap?" I asked him


"Well , If it's a prank then it's quite a well done one considering it's scale. It being real isn't out of the realm of possibilities though" Ray replied


"They also have off-" 


"Shh , someone's watching us" I cut off Ray


A man seemingly in his 30s wearing a weird necklace with a red U was watching us from behind the tree.


"Let's leave" I said to Ray before heading towards the exit.


"Follow him" I whispered to Ray.


I went right and he went left , The man didn't follow us out. We went towards the other side of the park and went into the bushes , The man was still there as if he was waiting for something.


4 hours later , At around 7pm. Another guy seemingly in his 20s walked in , The man approached him. Their conversation was inaudible but they started going somewhere. We followed them.


They entered an abandoned building, We entered after them. They went right into a huge room , We went left to look for clues.


We found a room with a lot of documents. I told Ray to be a lookout outside the room and went in to look for clues. 


There were a bunch of documents about paranormal activities in the past , some fiction about supernatural beings and other occult things. One book stood out from the others , One titled "UNF Rituals".


I opened the book , It had a bunch of weird rituals. "Ritual to become a cultist" , "Ritual to worship the OU", etc. There was one extremely weird called "Ritual to form a pact". All of them had one thing in common , Human sacrifices.


"What kind of a pact? What is the OU? What is this cult?" All these thoughts were racing into my mind when I suddenly heard a scream.


I hurriedly put the book into my overcoat and rushed outside to see no trace of Ray. I silently went towards the huge room and hid behind a wall.


"Who else is with you here?" A strange voice asked


"I came here alone" replied Ray


It seems he was spotted and captured by them , If only I hadn't........


"Well it doesn't matter, You are being given the honour to play part in the beginning of the new world. We appreciate your co-operation" said the strange voice.


That was when a black tentacle emerged from the ground. The black tentacle.....It was in the documents I read in the previous book.....Does that mean every single one of those creatures in the documents are real? I still couldn't believe that something like that can exist but it was right in front of my eyes.


The tentacle grabbed Ray's leg and dragged him into a weird red circle and stabbed him while he screamed in pain. 


He's dead , Ray died......All because of me. If I hadn't taken the case , If I hadn't followed the man , If I hadn't told him to be a lookout then he'd still be alive.


"Now Jason , Step into the circle and join us!" exclaimed the strange voice.


"I don't feel so good- I feel like I need to vom-" said the man in his 20s who was appearently Jason before running out with his hands covering his mouth.


He saw me while running out and signalled me to follow him . I was still shook by Ray's death but wanted to live so I followed him out.


There were armed men outside waiting for us. One of them took us back to a vehicle and assured us we'd be safe. The rest entered the building and........Well I don't remember since all I could think about was how I was responsible for Ray's death.


We entered the vehicle and sat down. After 30 minutes of silence I asked Jason "How'd you know I wasn't one of them and why did you save me?".


"Well it seems like you've gone through something horrible and you definitely don't seem like one of those crazy fanatics" he replied.


"That black thing.... What was it?" I asked while inspecting the book I took.


"A monster"
