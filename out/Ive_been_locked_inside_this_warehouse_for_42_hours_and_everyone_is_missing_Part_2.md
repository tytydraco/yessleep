Let me start off by expressing how fucking relieved I am that somewhere outside of this hellhole the world is still spinning. Sure, I’m still stuck here wondering how I'm going to get out but at least I know that there’s a place I can escape to as opposed to the alternative. 

I think it’s been a few days since I first tried to reach out to people. I can’t be certain though. The flow of time has felt distorted and slow ever since the appearance of the fire exit and… well… 

Natalie. 

But I'll get to that soon. 

Even as I sit here under the dim hue of the computer screen, I can still see the sickly green glow of that sign creeping ever closer and spilling across the floor. 

I’ve spent the majority of my time having an internal battle on what my next moves are. I'm tired, hungry and quickly approaching my wits end. Yet the fear paralyses me all the same. The complete lack of understanding is throwing me through a loop and I can’t seem to get a handle on anything. 

One minute I’m stewing in my own pity, asking the empty space around me what I had done to deserve this. The next, I’m creating a game plan, scribbling messily on a stack of old envelopes I found wedged between two boxes at my feet. 

The problem is, there was a stubbornness in me that fought very hard to keep my feet pinned to the only place left that gave me any sort of comfort. After my trip down what felt like the rabbit hole Alice stumbled into, I was reluctant to venture anywhere outside of the vicinity of the low light emanating from my laptop screen. I didn't want to be in wonderland anymore. 

There was nothing wonderful about it. 

 Eventually the twist of unforgiving hunger had begun to gnaw at my insides like a ravenous animal that had been cornered for far too long. I had reached a point of no longer being able to ignore it. 

Glancing at the disarray that was my desk. Empty cereal boxes and crushed water bottles splayed out across the table. I knew that I had no choice in the matter, I couldn’t grovel in my own shit anymore. 

I looked toward the speaker, now laying on the floor by my feet. It had died and in a fit of rage and panic I had flung the item off the desk. The only charger that fit into the port was upstairs in the now locked office. I knew it was irrational to get so wound up but the music brought me some form of comfort, especially considering I had nothing else to drown out the sound of sorrowful moaning that still emanated down the aisle. 

My eyes bounced around the small space I had carved out for myself. Wondering what else around me would be useful. In my search I had stumbled upon our old radio that as a collective workforce agreed to retire when for some unknown reason the damn thing would only play a repeat of three songs. No matter the station we attuned it to. It was a freaky little detail about this place I had long since forgotten and had never put all that much stock into. It was weird, sure and it had done well to entertain us on occasion. Hazing the new employee with our spooky radio was always fun. But in time it lost its charm and the constant repeat of songs had us putting that little old radio to rest. 

In my peripheral I noticed that the light to the staffroom kitchen had flickered on. I squinted at the new development suspiciously. It was like this place knew I needed to get more supplies and in its own way it was fucking with me. 

Looking down at the dusty contraption in my hand I wasn't really sure how radio frequencies would work here as my trembling fingers fiddled with a slightly bent antenna. To be fair I didn't even know if it even worked at all anymore but my phone was no longer charging and the laptop in front of me refused to open any new tabs other than the one I am currently sitting on. 

I could feel my frustration rise when all that met my ears was the sound of biting static. I shook the radio defiantly for a few seconds before a tired sigh left my lips. All I was asking for was a little distraction from the constant barrage of crying that had stolen any form of restful sleep from me.  Thrusting the contraption down onto the desk harshly I ran a shaky hand through my hair. What good was this stupid radio anyway. It wouldn’t protect me. 

I found myself gazing between the door to the staff room and my desk periodically. I needed to grow a pair and get myself some kind of food and water. What if this place abstracts any further and I no longer have a kitchen to go to? I was being ridiculous and putting myself more at risk than I already was. 

So I stepped tentatively away from the soft glow of the screen, throwing a poisonous glare in the direction of the radio as I pressed closer to the door.  Happy with the fact it hadn't taken what felt like an eternity to get there unlike my previous adventure. When I approached the glass slat in the doorframe something glinted under the fluorescent lights from the room on the other side. I paused, hand hovering just a few inches from the wooden frame. 

The glass was wet, droplets of condensation lazily slid from a spot just about eye level. There was a quickly dissipating fog pressed to the glass. The kind of mark that gets left when hot breath meets a cold surface. 

I cringed at the thought that something could have been there only moments before and I had somehow missed it. The only thing that moved me forward was the throbbing deep within my stomach. Pushing the door open slowly I poked my head through the small gap, eyes tracing over the room, trying to decipher if there was anything noticeably different. 

The room was small and claustrophobic, walls pressing closer than before. There was a thick shroud of umbra creeping from the corners of the room. It told me in no uncertain terms that this room was disappearing. 

With this newfound knowledge I rushed into the space and made a beeline for the kitchen. Now was the time to grab any essentials I needed before I no longer had the chance. 

My frantic haul bore little fruit in the end but it would have to do. I spared not even a second glance as I pushed my way back into the open space of the warehouse. 

It was then that static filled my senses. I stopped dead in my tracks. Loose packets of crisps and other snacks from the cupboard pouring from my bloated pockets. The Radio was now upright on the desk, the tiny screen flickering in disarray as it bounced between frequencies. 

The cadence of a few different voices strung together a sentence. Words coming out in awkward stutters as the stations jumped from place to place but there was no denying what I had heard.

“I like your skin” 

And just like that I had lost my appetite. 


Something was definitely toying with me. 


I think deep down I knew that from the start, as much as I had tried to convince myself otherwise. Ultimately it was the push I needed to steel my nerves and make the decision to investigate the back door. 

There was a fire lit under my ass now, I wanted out. 


Pulling the bag from under my desk I emptied the sparse contents and began to stuff it with food and bottled water. The goal was to not end up back here, if I could manage it. If it was even possible. 

With the strap of the bag hiked on trembling shoulders I found myself staring at one of the forklifts. Maybe I could drive down the aisle considering it took me what felt like days to walk to the exit before. 

I pulled  myself up onto the forklift. The fabric of the seat was cold against my jeans and a small cloud of my own breath floated about my face with every nervous exhale as I got my bearings.  Stashing the bag behind me I swivelled back to the controls, fingers fumbling in the dark as I tried to find the key that usually sat in a small compartment to the left of the steering wheel. Movements growing ever impatient I glided my hands across random bits of crap that had accumulated there over the years of use and when I finally felt the bumpy ridges of metal buried under some old paperwork a small smile crept its way onto my face. 

The drive down was a slow slog of anticipation and unease. I was right in my assumption that it would be quicker. Though I have no idea how much of that is pure luck or due to the fact this place was a temperamental nightmare and wholly unpredictable. 

The outer cage of the vehicle provided me with some comfort nonetheless as I traveled down the impossibly long stretch of space. 

To my surprise the previously  towering heap of metal that had defied all reason was no longer a contorted mess. Instead a very ordinary looking build stood back in its place. Lone box still perched on the highest rung. 

Either way it had made no difference in my mind, opting to forgo my curiosity I ended up face to face with a large door that was so familiar and so alien all at once. I had been through it so many times  and yet now I stood before it with anxiety thrumming under my skin. Usually just behind it would sit an old crooked bench that bowed and hissed whenever anyone sat on it. The floor often littered in old cigarette butts and snails that would lazily travel towards the overgrown tufts of grass and brambles. Who knows what lay past it now. 

To my utter dismay the damn thing wouldn’t budge and I tried, oh boy did I try. At first with my shoulders, pushing all my weight against an unyielding force and when that didn't work I wound my leg back and with all the force I could muster I kicked the door. I don’t really know what I had expected to happen but when a loud clang of my steel toe caps met the thick metal of the door a sharp pang zapped through my ankle bone. 

I'm a fucking idiot but I had to give myself some grace. This whole situation was screwing with my head and at this point I was so wound up and desperate that I was just about ready to try anything to get the fuck out of here. Swivelling on my heel I marched back over to the truck. I flung myself atop the seat and wasted no time in putting my foot down hard against the pedal in a rash decision to ram into the fucker. 

And yet… unsurprisingly all it had amounted to was a mild case of whiplash as the truck's forks collided with the heavy door. The sound of metal on metal ricochetted around my skull momentarily as the truck all but jolted to a complete stop, nearly flinging me from my seat. 

Great. That had done sweet fuck all. 

It took me a few moments to register the fact the crying I had grown semi used to at this point had stopped. Which in a strange way unnerved me more. I sat there in a silence that had evaded me for days. Ears straining for any kind of movement. 

Nothing. 

I glanced back towards the racking, neck twisting uncomfortably as I weighed up my options. I didn't want to die here… but an intense sense of needing to know what was up there pushed against a more logical mind. If the forklift still worked after my crash course directly into the door I could use the forks to bring the pallet down. If I didn't like what I saw I could always drive the box into the racking and hopefully that will be enough to kill whatever it is. 

It didn't take long to reverse the now dented vehicle and align it with the box that was currently still and quiet. The suspense only growing as the mast of the reach slowly crept higher and higher. My free foot tapped against the floor in rapid succession in an attempt to calm my fraying nerves. My mind was reeling with the possibilities of what I was about to find and no matter how many times my thoughts spiralled I had no idea what I was about to find. 

The forks were mere inches from the underside of the pallet now. Hovering just in front of the box. I allowed the mast of the truck to extend until it was sitting atop the metal slates. 

I sat there for a lot longer than I would like to admit, eyes fixated on the top of the cardboard. The dim light coming from the truck was barely bright enough for me to see much of anything but I didn't need to move from my seat to be able to see dark splotches of moisture soaking in the thin layers of the box. It wasn’t blood. No, it looked more like grease or something akin to it. When the pallet was safely on the ground I slid reluctantly from my seat. Coming to a stiff stand still only a few feet from the one object in this place that had been a consistency and an enigma all wrapped up into one. 

I had nowhere else to go, no obvious signs of escape and the only thing that was left unchecked sat before me. So I took a few steps towards it, until my palm rested on one of the flaps. I allowed for another moment to collect myself before peeling back the veil slowly. 

There were a lot of things my mind had supplied to me during this whole ordeal, that there would be some deformed monster ready to pounce and eat my soul or some form of demon? Maybe even the devil himself. Far be it from a religious man, I had been questioning my reality and what lay beyond a lot more than I ever have before since being stuck here… slowly rotting away. What else was there to do? Except ponder one of life's greatest mysteries?.  So when my gaze flicked anxiously down to meet a thick head of brown hair I recoiled from the shock. It had been so far from what I had prepared myself to see. 

When whoever was inside made no effort to stand or acknowledge me, I found myself peering over the top of the box yet again, brows drawn in concern. It was a girl, hunched in the corner, folded uncomfortably within herself. Her thick tangled hair covered the majority of her slender face. 

The sound of me moving must have finally roused her because in a matter of seconds her eyes met mine and all sense of dread melted from me in an instant. It was Natalie. I don’t know how or why but here she was, looking up at me with a blank expression, pupils dilated and milky in their sockets. 

“What the fuck” I mumbled to myself before leaning further into the box “N-Natalie?” 

I think hearing her own name is what ultimately pulled her from whatever dissociative state she had been in. Her head jerked slightly in surprise before squinting up at me for a second time. Only this time, she could see me. There was a small part of my brain that was screaming at me to stay cautious. What if it wasn't actually her? What if this was a trap? 

“Was that you?... crying all that time?” I tried in a hushed tone. 

Natalie seemed to ponder this a moment, a look of confusion glazing over her taut features “.... Crying?” she asked, one hand coming up to rub and her forearm. Something about this particular action sent a wave of relief flooding through me. It was a habit I noticed Natalie had pretty early on in our friendship. When the girl was anxious she would often rub at her arms to keep herself present in the moment and that simple act humanised her before me. This wasn't some fucking demon. This was my friend. 

 She blinked a few more times before speaking again. Her voice sounding strained as it crackled deep in her throat  “... I don’t like it here Tyler” 

A moment of silence drifted between us before a crazed look flashed in her eyes, her slender hand coming to grab at my arm that was now dangling just slightly over the lip of the box. Her hands were ice cold as they curled around my exposed flesh “I want this to be over!” she wailed, her grip tightening as she did so “I’ve been here for fucking ages! I want it to stop.. Please god make it stop…” 

Her unsteady hold had me almost teething over the edge of the unstable cardboard, the shock of what she had just said sent jolts of burning hot terror down to my very core “I saw you at work yesterday" I muttered. 

We both stewed in the silence that followed for an indescribable amount of time, both staring into each other's eyes in some kind of unspoken horror that we now shared. I lightly tugged on her arm in a silent question to see if she wanted to get out of the box she had been stuck in for however fucking long it had been. 

She nodded her head and pulled her shaky legs underneath herself, coming to an unsteady stance. Using the knife I had stashed away in my pocket in case things had gotten hairy, I cut away the side of the box and gently hoisted Natalie away from the pallet until she was situated next to me. 

“How long have you been here? And how the fuck did you end up in that?” 

She shook her head, dislodging a few stray tears “I don’t know… I showed up to work one day and then I never left. No one ever came. Until you” 

“And the box?” I gently probed. 

“I don’t want to talk about it” 

And that was it. I didn't want to push her, she was frozen to the bone and barely standing upright on her own. None of this made any kind of sense. How had she survived up there without even a drop of water for god knows how long? 

I think the confusion had been evident on my face as we drove back towards the other end of the warehouse, she shrugged beside me, shoulder lightly brushing mine “.... I thought I was going to die up there…. But…. you get used to the hunger pains eventually and then it just stops… hurting. It’s not natural but nothing about this place is” 

We didn't speak much after that, so I pulled up the other chair and sat her close to the heater. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep and now here we are. Day whatever the fuck in this shithole. 

At least I’m not alone anymore.
