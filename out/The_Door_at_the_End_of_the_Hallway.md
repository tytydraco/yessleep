I grew up in a house with too many rooms.

It wasn’t a mansion or anything, just a two-story house my parents bought cheap back in the 90s. The previous owner had started renovations but abandoned them halfway through, leaving odd spaces unfinished—closets that led nowhere, a window that looked into another room, and a single hallway on the second floor that was always cold, no matter the season.

At the end of that hallway was a door we never opened.

Mom said it was just a storage space sealed shut. Dad said the foundation made it unsafe. But they never actually said what was behind it. As a kid, I didn’t question it much. I just avoided that hallway. It gave me the same feeling I got in dreams where I was being watched from the shadows.

We moved out when I was sixteen after Dad passed and Mom couldn’t handle the place on her own. I figured I’d never see that house again.

I was wrong.

⸻

Fifteen years later, I inherited the place when Mom died. No one had lived in it for over a decade. It was empty, crumbling in places, and it smelled like mildew and time. But it was mine now, and I thought maybe—stupidly—I could fix it up, flip it, and make some money.

The second day I was there, I walked down that hallway again.

It was just as cold as I remembered.

The door at the end hadn’t changed. Still white, still unmarked, still with that old-fashioned brass handle that never turned. I touched it.

It was warm.

Like someone had just closed it from the other side.

⸻

That night, I heard knocking.

I was sleeping in the downstairs living room on a cot. The upstairs still gave me the creeps, but around 3:12 AM, I was jolted awake by a sharp, rhythmic knock-knock-knock.

I sat up, heart in my throat.

It was coming from upstairs.

I didn’t move.

Another knock, louder this time.

Then silence.

The next morning, I found faint scratches on the inside of the living room door. Three parallel lines, no deeper than a fingernail’s width, running across the wood.

Like something had tried to get in.

⸻

By the third night, I stopped sleeping altogether. Every hour, the knocks came back—sometimes slow and steady, other times frenzied and desperate. And it always came from that hallway. Always from that door.

I decided to open it.

I don’t know why. Curiosity. Exhaustion. Madness. Whatever it was, I took a crowbar and forced that handle to turn. It didn’t resist.

It had never been locked.

It just didn’t want to be opened.

The door creaked inward, revealing a small, narrow room. Dust coated everything, and the walls were covered in a strange, repeating pattern—like black vines etched into the wood.

There was no window. No furniture. Just a mirror on the far wall.

Tall. Framed in iron. Covered in a dirty white sheet.

I pulled the sheet off.

And I saw myself.

Only… I didn’t move.

My reflection just stood there.

Staring.

Eyes wide.

Mouth slightly agape.

Frozen.

I backed away, and the reflection stayed put.

It was still staring at me, not with me.

Then it smiled.

⸻

I slammed the door shut and nailed it closed.

I left that same night. I didn’t pack. I just drove. I drove until the sky turned pink with sunrise and didn’t stop until I found a hotel five towns over.

I don’t care what was in that room. I don’t care why that door was warm or what those knocks really were.

I sold the house.

Cheap.

To an out-of-state couple who said they were looking for a fixer-upper.

Sometimes I check the property records.

The owners have changed three times in the past two years.

No one stays for long.

And lately—when I look in the mirror—I swear it’s lagging again.

Just by a second.

But enough to notice.

⸻

[UPDATE:]

I woke up this morning with three fresh scratches on the inside of my bedroom door.

I live in an apartment.

Third floor.

With no pets.

I haven’t looked in a mirror all day.

I don’t think I ever will again.
