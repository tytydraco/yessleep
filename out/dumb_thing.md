 (English is not my first language and I'm not very good at it so sorry if there are any mistakes)

I feel so worthless, I got fired for the third time in a month for a stupid reason that I don't even understand and this is my next job, I was introduced to this job by a friend, hm circus worker? Well, that's fine, at least for someone who is unemployed and about to be evicted if they can't pay their rent. I went to the circus that day, I found it quite strange because this circus was in a place with a lot of people passing by so it was quite crowded I hate crowded places, I guess I'll just have to get used to the fact that there are so many people here, it was also very large so it took me a while to get to the circus manager's place. Is the manager a cosplayer wth? he wears a suit decorated with a lot of colors but not too bright, red auburn hair tied back, what makes him weirdest is the clown mask, it's quite silly tbh mask white is painted over the clown's makeup. It's been a while and still no one is talking to each other, I sat looking at him and forgot that I need to apply for a job, he also saw that I was quite dull so he started a conversation.
"So let me guess, you're here to apply for a job, right?"

The manager ask, His voice can be guessed that he is quite young, around 27-30 his question reminded me of what I needed to do, I nodded, prepared for questions or whatever but he didn't ask me anything he just said

"okay, you are accepted, you can go to work tomorrow..."

the heck? Since when did getting a job become so easy? I thought, I was surprised, I don't know how to answer that

"So what is my-..."

I asked but the manager interrupted me, he said

"You don't need to do much, just learn all the rules and follow them."

rules? I wondered but the manager continue

"Ah, I forgot to introduce myself, I'm Isaac, you can call me IC, I don't mind, I'll talk about these rules in an easy to understand way."

isaac thought for a moment, even though the mask covered his expression, i still felt like he was thinking about something. After a while, he finally spoke up

"Do not break the rule, do not tell this to any employee because each person has their own rules."
 Isaac sighed and continued

1-you will be on night shift, you have to be on time , i don't care what happens when you get to work but you have to come at 20:00 , if you are late for more than a minute , Go home, pretend you didn't go to work that day. 
2- If you see any guests with their children asking about the business, take them to the ballroom area, the staff will take care of the rest, don't meddle in their business. The only one who suffers will be you. 
3- If you see a person with black and white hair with a little red tint, wearing a red and black hoodie, with black and white horns. STAY AWAY FROM HIM and tell me right away, don't believe anything he says, he can talk through the mind, be careful not to be seduced by him . 
4-If you meet a man dressed as a black-haired clown, stay away from them, this circus no longer has a black-haired clown. 
5-please trust Ryder 
5- Remember, the customer is king, do whatever they ask. 
6-get the fuck out of this place.
6- If you see an employee named Mike, stay away from him and notify me immediately

Isaac paused for a moment and then said  
"That's all  , you can go to work this afternoon"

I thanked him and left, that afternoon, as scheduled, I came to work at 20:00 by 23:24 hrs i'm already out of work but i don't know what to say , today was so bad i was approached by a guest and i was disgusted by it , at break time for my shift an employee came and talk to me, we talk a little bit about life and then suddenly he introduced his name, his name is Camaiel hm his appearance looks like someone named "Ryder" that my manager said but isaac I didn't mention that there will be someone who is an employee who looks like him so I don't care 

"so Oliver why did you work here?" he ask 

"because i don't know what to do."

" You better quit your job." 

I was surprised, why did he want me to quit, I was not happy so I left and didn't pay attention to him anymore. 
When I went back to work, I saw a female guest with her two children 
"Is there any trade here?" she ask she looked a bit worry like someone was watching her , i was about to say no then i remembered the rules here so i took her to the ballroom and let her wait there , i went back to work no I don't care anymore, but as far as I'm concerned, she came out with a bag of something later, coming out in a hurry like a thief. but idc That day at the funeral, I saw a black haired clown but he was gone and I didn't care anymore, I didn't have time to check it out because my shift was over. 

Next day , i went to work again , everything went very well when i had to do it in the circus this time not outside like yesterday , i saw Isaac as the main performer and a black haired clown,  he was not acting but just standing still near the entrance to the theater, I don't know if Isaac has seen them but I can't tell isaac when he is acting suddenly isaac's stir-fry broke and almost stabbed him , the performance staff also tried to turn it into a pity while taking him away , the black haired clown also disappeared . it's weird tho... 

.....


it's been a month, wtf isaac still hasn't returned to work, we got a new manager and the new manager is so rude. But after that incident, I didn't see anything strange happen until today I was sent to the ball house to work, I was simply assigned when someone talked about business and brought children to take them to a room under the corridor and leave them there, i always do that but i feel weird today for some reason... i thought i would go there, i was just curious, i got off work that night but i invited my cousin to join When I arrived, I also went to that room and waited for quite a while before I saw someone open the door, welcoming a strange looking guy.. they invited me in when I entered the HOLY SHIT I almost vomited, children's bodies everywhere. , all skinned and tongue cut off , the smell of decomposition hits my nose , I can still see .. the 2 kids I met at the beginning of the job ... they were the most decomposed , I'm still in shock . then the other guy knocked my nephew unconscious and threw me a bunch of money like he knew I sold my cousin, I was scared to notice and went out, dazed... I don't know how to stop, my cousin fainted the moment he stepped in...but.... the money for this is also a lot I don't know why, will I ever come to ask for my cousin again, he will kill me too? i don't know...i'm scared, when i went out i heard a call, it startled me and almost ran away, i was afraid it was the police.. afraid it was anyone who would arrest me for what i just did do  

"OLIVER! why tf did you run? is there anything?" 
That's Camaiel,  he ask.

I dodged him, got in the car and went home, I couldn't sleep that night, the image of the dead children kept in my head...I thought about...my cousin was the next victim?  i feel so guilty.. what should i do...i...
