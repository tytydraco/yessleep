 Tibradon is cursed. 

Back in the 17th century, people had a constant fear for witches which led to innocent or not people being tortured, hanged or even burnt alive. 

Tibradon was also known for its witches. 

It was the place the actual witches got away to in order to escape their brutal fate. 

The village could not easily be detected as it did not and still does not exist in any map and people who know about it are villagers who lived there. The witches were sure that sooner or later they would be found and tortured. So in case that happened they were prepared, they casted a spell if they ever were found then their souls would wander around seeking revenge. 

Their progeny were found eventually and they got tortured and burnt alive, or that's what the myth says. 

Today, Tibradon is an isolated village located on the mountains of Western Europe. People visit it to spend their summer there. It's hard to find so the location is known only if you have lived there and remember how to go there or if you have spent a lifetime searching for it. 

The myth is widely spread amongst the locals but no strange behaviour or phenomenon has been detected. 

Maybe the witches are roaming tibradon in winter time when hardly anyone is there, maybe they are harmless or maybe the whole witch-spell thing is fake and made just to scare people for whatever reason. 

I was of the opinion that the whole thing was fake, just a myth as its name suggests. 


But I was wrong. So wrong. 


I grew up in that village so I was well aware of the myth and as a kid I believed that witches were around the area. Whenever we'd hear a sound we would snap our heads at the direction fearing it was them. Getting ready to run but always turning out to be a cat stepping on a leaf or the cool breeze of the summer nights making the tree leaves brush against each other or the flames in the fireplace. Never them.

I believed in them until when I was like 13. 

We got used to such sounds and always being wrong about witches getting ready to harm us so we all (me and my friends and basically almost every kid our age) stopped believing in their existence.  

I was 16 when my life took a sudden twist.  

Us being teenagers fooling around had the fantastic idea to call the witches. 

We searched how to communicate with dead people and I found a method that seemed to be a good one. So what stopped us from doing such thing? Nothing. 

We did everything the method suggested and we later on sat down in a circle.

"Î‘re we sure about this?" I asked breaking the silence that took over the few of us these last five minutes.

"Of course, duh, what do you think will happen haha" Mark laughed but it did not seem like a genuine one. But we all brushed it off and went on with the rest of the method. 

"Why isn't it working?" Mary said with her eyes closed like the rest of us, her hands started sweating against my already sweaty hands. 

"Shut up Mary, just wait" that was Aaron who said that, the one who still believed in the witches. 

"I'm out of this, I feel weird" Ann was the most hesitant one about the whole thing. She started crying softly and tears fell down on the carpet. She almost got her hands out of Mary's and Aaron's grasp when the lights flickered open and the flame of the candles all disappeared. Except for one, the one candle in front of me. 

Ann started sobbing when she realised that only my candle was still lit. Mark embraced her telling her nothing happened and it's just a coincidence that only my flame was still there. 

But only it wasn't one.  

Everyone was all over Ann telling her not to worry and everything was alright and didn't realise I had passed out on the carpet, the flame putting out and only the smoke still being there. 

And that's where all my memory ends. 



After that I remember waking up to people being all over me telling me to hurry to get ready because we had to leave.

I couldn't process it, where was I? I had no idea. It all was still hazy. 

The village was a mess, people were running all over, families trying to escape. Others taking their lives. Bodies everywhere and the worst of all was the disgusting smell of something burning. 

The smell leading to the fire in the center of the village but that wasn't the worst.

It was the creature that was there. 

A grey silhouette, twice the height of a human but skinny to the point that its bones were showing. 

It had no mouth, just big white eyes that were terrifying. And yet it was making a haunting growling sound making people's ears bleed. 

Screaming and growling, the running steps and the scorching hot fire that was engulfing the people this creature throwed them in were the only sounds someone could hear. 

I still had no emotion. No panic. 

It felt fake yet so real. 

The grey creature was getting bigger. But it wasn't because of another supernatural power of its but because it was coming towards me.

The growling only got worse, it felt like I could hear it from inside of me, not from the actual source being the failed-to-be human like thing.

I was stuck, stuck watching it slowly destroying me without touching me. 

My eyes closing shut, my body giving in, my ears bleeding and all of a sudden all I could hear was the growling. Nothing else, not the faint sound of the fire, not the haunting screams, nothing. Just it. 

I felt something dragging me, so suddenly I had no time to react and yet my eyes still were closed. 

I couldn't hear anything other than it. The growling. 

I felt myself smile as I started realising what was happening. Out of the blue another source with bony fingers got me and dragged me somewhere else. 

The place was getting hotter and hotter by each passing second and then I got forced into a hot place.

I was burning, I was being burnt alive and I was laughing hysterically. I was screaming while laughing as I was watching the thing staring at me back. 

I could almost see a faint change in its failed face as if it was trying to smile back. 

I felt everything and nothing at the same time. The flames engulfing me and I was not reacting other than the laughing. 

I fell down and lost my senses, smiling as I let my soul get away from my burning body. 




I woke up in a hospital. I was alone in a white room for what seemed like a minute and then a nurse came in. 

"Oh my god, she's awake" she whisper-screamed. As soon as she came in she was out again and then more doctors came in and started checking on me until I lost my senses again. 




I saw a dream while I was unconscious. I dreamt of a few people, I don't remember the exact number but probably around 10 to 15, being sat down on the hard wood. A fire in the middle as they all, including me, were silently praying to something I wasn't aware of. 

I was looking around trying to process everything when the creature came out of the flames and suddenly all of us were falling back from where we were sitting down, dying as the last thing we saw was the thing smiling as its mouth disappeared into the 'face'. 




And once again I woke up in the hospital, though this time I wasn't alone but the same doctors were over me examining me. 

After a minute or two they were done and one of them started talking.

"You were in a coma for the last 4 months. It was almost certain you would die but you are miraculously alive. I know it is a lot to process so you can take your time. We will inform your parents about you waking up. The nurses will be here to take care of you. We wish you a fast recovery "

And with that, I was puzzled. I thanked them but I had a confused expression on my face. I was alone for a bit when the doctors left and the nurses came in but in that little while I saw the creature again in the far end of the room as it vanished into thin air once the nurses came inside. 

"It felt like one hour" I said staring blankly at the spot the creature was.

"It is like that for many, don't worry" the nurse close to me smiled at me. 

"You will be off to go home once we make sure you are okay, which will be in a week as the doctors said" 

"Okay...thank you" I finally turned to look at them and saw the faces of two of the women in the circle on the two nurses.

They smiled at me knowingly. 

"Don't you worry, it's all okay now" 

. 



My parents came to visit me and explained everything.  

I was in town now and not in the village. My friends freaked out when they saw me passed out and got my parents there and after that we left for a nearby town with a hospital until they figured out I was in a coma and was transferred to our town's hospital. 

My friends were all scared when that happened and the worried looks on their faces made my parents believe everything they said. 

The thing is that they all went back home and the next morning they were all gone. No traces of them leaving which upsetted the village and made most people leave. 

I was fine to leave after a week and my life after that continued smoothly.  

A month after that I received a phone call, it was from Mary. But it couldn't be, she was gone? I answered it and I heard running footsteps, many footsteps and screaming. 

"Help, please help us, this grey creature is chasing us again, it will throw us in the fire. There's a group of people praying and the thing is coming out of it. Please help us Ev-" 

The phone call was ended. And when I tried calling again it wasn't connecting. 

I fell asleep that night and saw it all happening.


My friends died in the very same fire I was burnt in. The creature threw them in after the phone call. 

I was turning back in time, different timelines. From the first spell to the fire. And they were turning back in time with me too. 

I never returned back and never received any call again. 

Someone I was in contact with once went to tibradon and never came back. 




The village was, is and will be cursed for the remaining of the time. The creature made from the witches will always wander around in there.

The witches were real and I was one of them. 



It wasn't a myth, The Witches Of Tibradon existed and are seeking revenge.
