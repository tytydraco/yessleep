I said this to my friend as we walked down the shitty worn path between the stretches of trees.

“You can find your mama at the public park.” My friend, who was some distance in front of me, stopped and slapped his own left buttcheek at me.

I made a rude gesture back to my friend. “Shut up. Your grandmama.”

“Your grandaddy.”

“Your great uncle.”

“Your ancient cousin twice removed.”

My best friend and I continued with our back and forth as we turned out of the main path and into the groves of dark trees. It was 1am, so there was almost no one around except for us anyway- definitely none in the shrouded area. Our cheap flashlights hardly illuminated a few feet in front of us. But some distance away a faint melody of a song floated through the air to us, a real dirty beat. 

“Think someone’s having a party in the woods?” I asked him.

“It’s gotta be our ghost.”

“Why would a ghost be having a party, dumbass? Aren’t they all dreary and haunting this life from regrets. You’re so stupid.”

“Don’t be prejudiced. Ghosts can party too. You fucking racist,” my friend said that last part in a ghostly tone.

We got nearer to the site the dirty beat was playing from, but there were no lights near there. Closer, the strings melody over the dirty beat became clearer. It was kinda melancholy. When we emerged to the small clearing in the gloom of trees, a lone speaker box sat on an outcropped rock from the ground playing the song. A candlestick next to it, unlit. The moon came out from the cover of the clouds above and streamed into the small clearing directly onto the abandoned speaker candle duo.

“Look at that, ghost party going down any moment now, I told you—” My friend cut off as his flashlight burst in an abrupt shatter, blowing the bulb. “Cheap piece of shit! It’s melted from the heat!” He hurled his flashlight away from himself in a rage.

“Bro, they were a dollar and we bought them from a homeless man. They’ve probably been used to shit.” Luckily, my own flashlight was still fine, but pretty weak in light.

“God I hate being broke,” my friend bitched. I had to call him a broke ass bitch after that. Another back and forth ensued in the clearing of the forest by the odd speaker, until the candlestick next to us rose in a warm glow.

The insults died in our throats as we looked at the candle. I went to take a closer look.

“Electric candle. Shit’s probably timed. This has to be bogus.” I pointed out the twistable knob at the base and sat next to the speaker. The candle switched off again, definitely out of batteries. “Song’s awesome though. Worth it to come just for it I think.”

“So you’re able to think,” my friend said as he crouched by one of the trees. He started inspecting the trunk with his hands shoved into the pocket of his hoodie, flashlight-less. “I still think the legend’s true. Everyone who came here posted in the online forum that they saw some weird shit.”

“I dunno. Ghosts aren’t real dude. Even if they were it’s just a stupid ass person, or was, whatever. Point is, they wouldn’t even be scary at all.” I paused for a moment as the speaker crackled. As if the frequency had triggered it, I was overcome with a jarring memory out of nowhere, which I had to bring up. “You know what was actually scary? Seeing your grandma sleepwalk. That actually creeped me the hell out bro I can’t even lie.”

My friend shuddered after he stood to lean against the tree trunk. “No I have to agree with you on that one. She keeps talking to someone called James when she does. She made him a sandwich even in the dead of the night. Saw it when I went down to the kitchen for a glass of water.” My friend grabbed the back of his neck as if something had brushed it. It was probably a leafy branch.

I frowned. “Was James her late husband or something?”

“Nope. I asked my dad about it once, he also has no clue. Far as he and I know, she’s never met anyone named James.”

My friend and I looked around over our shoulders to our blind spots in the dark forest. Always good to check. He let out a troubled sigh and spoke up again. “But… I asked her about him once. She said he’s a ‘fine young man’. Got the impression she sees him like a grandson or something, whatever he is.”

I looked down at the speaker next to me as the song ended. A sticker was stuck on the top of it.

“Hold on bro, look at this.” I gestured for him to come over, then angled my flashlight for him to see better. The sticker read: PROPERTY OF JAMES.

“What the actual fuck,” he said then slowly looked at me. “You don’t think…”

“Nah, no way dude. No way.” I shook my head several times.

“I don’t know man the coincidence is too freaky. I mean look at how weird this setup is anyway. I think I saw that speaker the other day too, retails for about 1000 dollars. Top of the line stuff. Why would anyone just leave out here, playing a song way past the middle of the night?”

At that moment, my faint flashlight flickered dead. I swore under my breath and tossed it to the side, seized by the sudden darkness we were pitched in. The half light of the moon hardly shone through the cover of clouds. A shroud of bushes not too far away rustled, followed by the sharp snap of a twig. Not a moment later, footsteps. My blood ran cold.
