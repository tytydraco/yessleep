Lately I’ve found myself wondering what lurks in the woods behind my house. 

We recently moved into a beautiful home surrounded by a wooded area. The perfect place for our perfect family. Most recently it has only been myself and our child at home, as my husband travels across the country for work. 

We have two large picture windows in our living room that just seem to encase the woods perfectly. I’ve found myself drawing the blinds more and more, because while I’m staring out the window, I don’t want to think of what could be staring in. 

As I was getting ready for bed, I realized I had forgotten to take pictures of our backyard for the new landscaper who was scheduled to arrive early the next morning. I grudgingly put my shoes on, cursing myself for not doing this in the daylight hours. 

I opened the curtains a crack and gazed out into the large backyard. I told myself not to let my mind wander. I’d just take the pictures and be done with it. I took a deep breath and opened the back door. I was met with nothing but the wind and the sound of crickets chirping. 

Feeling my nerves settle a little, I stepped into the yard and started taking my pictures. I had the sound off on my phone so the camera made no noise. 

I was ready to finish up, just a couple of pictures left, when I heard a rustle come from the tree line. I tried to put it out of my head and finish so I could get back inside to the safety of my home. 

I turned to walk the several steps back to my back door and heard a low growl. That was all it took for me to hit a full sprint. All I could think about was getting back inside. I HAD to get back inside. 

I made it to the door and went to slam it behind me, but something was pushing on the other side of the door. Growling, desperately scratching and pushing, trying to get into my home. 

I was no match strength wise for whatever this beast was, no matter how hard I tried. The beast shoved the door in and sent me to the floor. I immediately curled into a ball trying to protect myself, and whatever this thing was immediately started attacking me. 

Claws and teeth dug into my flesh. I wanted to scream out so badly, but I knew no one would hear me. All I could think about was letting it finish with me and be on its way. After all, I had a baby sleeping in the other room. 

The beast mutilated every inch of my body. I didn’t understand how I was possibly still alive. I could feel myself slipping further and further away every time my heart beat. 

The beast stood up on its hind legs. The only way I can describe it is something like an emaciated werewolf. It was missing patches of hair all over its body and it smelled like rotting flesh. He stood over me and it almost seemed like he was admiring his work. 

The beast turned toward the back door to leave, and at that very moment I heard a faint cry from the other room. My one year old. I begged with everything left in me for him to turn around and walk out the door. The beast gave what sounded like a slight chuckle and headed for my baby’s room. That’s when I lost consciousness.

Lately I’ve found myself wondering what lurks in the woods behind my house, and tonight I found out.
