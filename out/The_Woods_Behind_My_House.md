Have you ever heard of Wendigo? Probably not.  If you have, however, you possibly heard about them from your parents, telling you scary stories about the dark forests of East Coast Canada.  How you should never go too deep into the forest, especially at night.  How the farther it sounds, the closer it really is.  How its long, sharp claws draw from their paws into honed curls.  How it's rib cage stretches through their skin. Or how it's teeth were sharper than the blade of a dagger.  
To be honest, I never believed it. 
I was one of those skeptical types.  Never believed anything I couldn't see, and I liked it that way.  
I mean, there was no evidence of one .. just old "scary" stories I would hear from my Grandmother, whom I lived with at the time.  
Although I was skeptical, I no longer doubt what I saw that night..

The legend of the wendigo has been told for generations, (especially where I lived.) 
Said to be tall, up to twelve feet.  They looked of deers, or mangled dogs.  
It was said if a man were to be overwhelmed with hunger, and had resorted to cannibalism for survival, he would transform into a creature of the night forest as a punishment from the gods, forced to remain that way, feeding on human flesh and blood for survival.  
Others say a man who drowned in the sin of greed, would be transformed as punishment. 
And some believe they are simply a pawn of the devil, sent out to destroy us as humans.

I, like many in my community, have heard these stories from a very young age.  These tales and stories were made to inform us, keep us children away from where they may harm us.  
Some of us are wise, and listen to the stories, and some, like me, were stubborn to the idea, and ended with a life lost.  
Although I lost a lot to the incident, I consider myself to be lucky, because I was one of the few rare souls who escaped the grasp of a Wendigo.

"I'm 17! I should be able to stay out as long as please!"
I shouted, towering over my grandmother.  
"It doesn't matter how old you get!" She began,
"You know the stories! You know about THEM!"
My grandmother was always a worrier.  A frail old woman, who sat by the window and waited for me to come home every night.  
She was impossible.  Constantly reminding me "if you stay out too long, it will find you."

When my grandmother was a young teenager, her father worked as a coal miner, down far in South East Canada.  He would walk to work, a two hour long walk through the forest, there and back.  She always worried about him, after hearing the legends of the Wendigo by her mother and father.  
One blistering winter night, her father didn't return home.  He was found in the morning, under a blanket of fresh snowfall, was my great grandfather, mauled unrecognizable, without a single patch of flesh left untouched.  

"I know about them!" I replied.  "But there's been no reports since you were a child! I mean surely whatever was out there is long gone now!" 
My grandmother took off her glasses, wiping the tears that had accumulated under her eyes. 
The room was silent.
"I'm sorry." She said,  
"But you know what happened.."  She began to cry harder as she spoke, her words cracking and crumbling apart like dried clay.  
I let out a loud sigh.  
"I'm sorry, grandma, I know what happened." 
I handed her a tissue box on the table behind me, and went down the hall to my room.
"Ughhh" I moaned, my head smashed into my pillow.  

Another day, I missed my curfew, and came home two hours late. My grandmother couldn't drive, being 89, she lost her license long ago, and wouldn't let me take any drivers classes til I was 18, for my "safety," so I had to walk everywhere. 
I lived In a small cabin in the middle of the woods, where my grandmother had lived as a child.  There was a short path leading to the outside of the forest, and leading to the highway.  
Although I was told to stay on the path when leaving, I often cut through the other side of the forest, because it was a shorter path to my highschool.  Now my grandmother didn't know this, and to be honest with you I'd be bound to my bedroom for a week If she did know.  

All my friends were going to senior parties, drinking, smoking, and meeting girls, while I was stuck at home, studying and boarding the doors every night.  I thought it was ridiculous.  
I understand what had happened, but that was back in the early 1900's, it was 1982, and times had changed since she was a child.  
Hell we don't even know if it WAS a Wendigo, it could just as easily been a wolf or bear!
Nevertheless, until I was legally an adult, I had to listen to her, no matter how austure her rules were.

The next day, I stayed after school to get extra help in physics.  It was after 6pm in late November and my simple self didn't realize the sun was setting til I stepped outside the school.  
"Shit." I thought to myself.  "I'm gonna hear the business when I get home." 
My curfew was 7pm, although that was at the very latest, and I would definitely hear about it if I showed up exactly at seven.
I checked my watch. "6:47". 
I immediately knew I was in trouble, considering the walk home from school was over half an hour.  
I decided that skipping through the forest was my best chance of getting home a little bit earlier.

The sun had completely set, I followed the glow of the half-moon, radiating the dark sky. 
I was stepping on twigs, and old dried leaves that piled the ground.  I shivered, as the wintry breeze blew past my flushed cheeks.  My shoes were soaked, with a freezing liquid absorbed into the fabric.  
The day was long enough, being yelled at by teachers all day, I couldn't believe I'd have to deal with more shit from my grandmother. 
I knew it was coming.  I mean, it was obvious. 
I was nearly half way home, my feet were stuck in place, and my coat was soaking wet.
That's when I heard it.
*SNAP*
The snap of a twig, certain not from me walking.  A loud snap hit me, like the bang of a timpani. 
*SNAP* *SNAP*
I heard it again.  This time it was louder.. more distinct.  It no longer sounded like someone snapping twigs.  Someone was behind me.  
"Hello?" I shouted behind me. "Is anyone there?"
No response.
*SNAP* 
"Cmon stop messing around!" I spoke again. 
"Is someone there?!" 
*SNAP* *SNAP* *SNAP*
I started walking faster, trying to pick up the pace and get to my house.  I was still at least fifteen minutes away.
*SNAP*
They grew louder, more aggressive.  It no longer sounded like someone walking.  It was as if someone was crushing human bones beneath them.  
I started running.  Trying to get away from whatever was behind me.  
My area often frequented wolves, and even bears, so I knew whatever behind me wasn't there to make friends.
The snapping stopped.
"Evan?"
I heard a voice calling out my name.  But I recognized the voice.  It was so frail and quiet.. It was my grandmother! 
"Evan?!" She shouted once more.  
"Grandma?" I replied.
"Where are you? Come to me Evan!"
I started walking towards the sound, Which led away from my house.. but something felt wrong.. something felt..sinister.
It didn't sound like my grandmother, kind of faint, and crackly.  It definitely resembled her voice, with her quiet, stretched voice.  
I started to back away.. stepping back until I started to run.
"EVAN!" It screamed. It no longer sounded like my grandmother. It was booming, and ghastly. 
"COME HERE!" 
I ran faster than I ever had before.  I felt my heart beating out of my chest.  My feet were burning, and tingling from the wet snow I was running through.  

Suddenly, I dropped.
My body slammed into the ground with a hard thud.  My foot, tangled within the roots of a tree beneath me.  I tried to pull myself up, when my arms went limp.  My left arm had broken, and a sharp rock had pierced the flesh on my back.
I screamed in agony, I couldn't move my body, I couldn't run, nor speak. 
That's the moment I saw … IT 

It stood above me, staring down at my shivering body.  A running red liquid dripped from it's gaping snout, and it's eyes were darker than a black hole.  It's antlers were pointed, the tips coated in dried blood.  It's long limbs draped from Its body, and ended in curled claws.  Ribs like a starved man stretched through its chest.  
At that moment, I knew what this was.  
Regret started to flood through my brain.  "How could I have let this happen? Why didn't I listen?" 
It walked towards me, almost as if it knew I was no longer able to escape it's grasp.  I felt the embrace of death, as it started and towered over my weak, crying body. 
I saw it's eyes.  It's eyes showed nothing but death.
I tried to fight it, kicking my one moving leg, screaming, begging, praying for someone to hear me and find me.
I suddenly felt a pain, an agonizing, brutal pain.  This was a pain I have never felt in my life.  A splitting pain, like something was grabbing, pulling, scratching at my left leg.  
I screamed, I screamed so hard I felt blood seep from my throat. I tried to pull myself from the harrowing pain, it was no use.  
It was ready for a feast.  It was dinner.
I fell back, accepting my defeat.  
My leg went numb.  All I felt was a warm liquid spewing from it. 
I remember that moment.  I will never forget that moment.  How it held me down, grasping my leg, it's claws digging into me, it's fangs sinking into my cold, burning cold flesh.
I was no longer fighting then, I knew death was upon me.. until..
"EVAN!" 
I heard a voice, again, a familiar voice, but this time, I heard the concern in her voice.  I heard the trembling fear, and pain in the voice.  I heard the voice of someone who's seen this before. I heard, my grandmother.
Her voice lowered.
"Please.. forgive me for this, Evan."
Before I could move to see who was here, I was knocked back, a loud crash filled my ears.. then another, and another, then, a Hot, shooting pain filled my thigh, a pain worse than the creature's fangs. 
I had been shot. 

My eyes opened, just a crack.  I couldn't move.  I didn't know where I was.  
Then, Everything became very familiar as I saw, the blood bag standing next to me, the beeping monitor, the IV in my arm, and my poor, tiered grandmother, asleep in the chair next to my bed. 
I was in the hospital.
I raised my head up, it was spinning out of control, and I could barely move my neck.  
I didn't speak, I didn't move. 
I watched my grandmother, opened her eyes, and immediately began to tear up.
"Hello my dear.." she said.
I couldn't speak.  My body was too frail,I was too weak to speak.
"w..what-"
"Evan.." she cut me off. 
"Do you remember what happened?"
"I.." I began. 
"I remember some things.. w-hat happened." 
Her hopeful smile furrowed into a concerned frown.
"Evan.. do you remember what happened to your great grandfather?" She asked. 
Her eye contact pierced right through me.
I was silent for a moment.
"Yes.. I do"
"Evan… you escaped the grasp of a Wendigo.  But your stubbornness has cost you."
She lifted the sheets and blanket that played on top of me. 
I had lost a leg.  

I think about that day a lot. Whether I'm reminded about my prosthetic, or the nightmares.. or he screams, that I still hear. 
I've moved out since then, All the way down South.  It's been ten years since I lost my leg, and eventually my grandmother.  
So if you ever take a trip, down to east coast Canada, and hear the spine chilling calls of the beast, remember.. 
The farther it sounds..
The closer
He is ..
