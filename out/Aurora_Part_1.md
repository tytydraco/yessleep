Awakening, I lifted my head up from the lab table, the side of my face sticky with sweat. My fellow colleague, Dr. Raj, stopped shaking me as I slowly got up.

“What happened?”, I asked him while I blearily looked around the mess. Our items and equipment were strewn everywhere in what was once a pristine lab.

“Aurora’s missing! She isn’t anywhere in the labs!”, he frantically replied.

Firstly, introductions are in order. It’s important that you know this! Aurora is a project by the shadowy corporation that hired me and my fellow researchers, aiming to create a stronger, smarter artificial human. Three years ago, we finally found success and created a person: namely Aurora.

If you don’t get it, think of a normal human. Now, imagine we made the human ground up with various nanomaterials in a lab. Like their brains, guts, everything is like what’s in an actual human and functions as such, but made artificially. Oh, and it makes the human smarter and stronger. Can’t forget that. Well, that would be what we did with Aurora. Or something like that, I wasn’t employed there when they did all of that.

In the lab, we mostly carried out various activities and tests to evaluate her physical and mental capabilities. That is, until the day all of this unfolded. A couple hours before, we had just finished a physical test with Aurora (rock climbing, if that’s important). Returning to the lab, we were treated to a pleasant surprise.

Spending around half an hour in the kitchen, Aurora walked out with a tray full of cupcakes. Standing in front of me and my colleague, Dr Sam, she nervously muttered, “I- uh- wanted to do something for you, so I made some cupcakes. Can you please try them?”

Smiling widely at her, I responded,”Of course! Give me the tray, I’ll give it out.” before curiously asking, “Where did you learn to bake?”.

“Dr Diana lets me use her phone now and then”, she replied. While I had never seen this happen before, I accepted this little fact without any opposition. Given that it was lunchtime, I passed around the cupcakes and we all gorged ourselves on her cupcakes without caution.
