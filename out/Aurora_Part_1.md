Awakening, I lifted my head up from the lab table, the side of my face sticky with sweat. My fellow colleague, Dr Raj, stopped shaking me as I slowly got up. 

“What happened?”, I asked him while I blearily looked around the mess. Our items and equipment were strewn everywhere in what was once a pristine lab.

“Aurora’s missing! She isn’t anywhere in the labs!”, he frantically replied.

Firstly, introductions are in order. It’s important that you know this! Aurora is a project by the shadowy corporation that hired me and my fellow researchers, aiming to create a stronger, smarter artificial human. Three years ago, we finally found success and created a person: namely Aurora. 

If you don’t get it, think of a normal human. Now, imagine we made the human ground up with various nanomaterials in a lab. Like their brains, guts, everything is like what’s in an actual human and function as such, but made artificially. Oh, and it makes the human smarter and stronger. Can’t forget that. Well, that would be what we did with Aurora. Or something like that, I wasn’t employed there when we did all of that.

In the lab, we mostly carried out various activities and tests to evaluate her physical and mental capabilities. That is, until the day all of this unfolded. A couple hours before, we had just finished a physical test with Aurora (rock climbing, if that’s important). Returning to the lab, we were treated to a pleasant surprise. 

Spending around half an hour in the kitchen, Aurora walked out with a tray full of cupcakes. Standing in front of me and my colleague, Dr Sam, she nervously muttered, “I- uh- wanted to do something for you, so I made some cupcakes. Can you please try them?”

Smiling widely at her, I responded,”Of course! Give me the tray, I’ll give it out.” before curiously asking, “Where did you learn to bake?”.

“Dr Diana lets me use her phone now and then”, she replied. While I had never seen this happen before, I accepted this little fact without any opposition. Given that it was lunchtime, I passed around the cupcakes and we all gorged ourselves on her cupcakes without caution.

In hindsight, she must have drugged the cupcakes to render us unconscious, while she escaped.

As I slowly recollected the events leading up to this, Diana and Sam ran back into the lab with a shiny metal tablet, having come to the conclusion that she was not anywhere in the facilities.

“The location tracker shows she’s going to the docks. Get your equipment and go to the car now!” Diana hastily instructed as we made for the garage where the company car was. We quickly drove out of the nondescript corporate building that served as our headquarters and made for the docks.

In the meanwhile, Diana quickly briefed us on the next course of action. “She’ll probably take a boat or something and get into the ocean. We need to intercept and capture her with the company boat before she gets out too far. And we’ll shoot her with the tranquilisers here if she gets too rowdy. Got it?”

“And you, newbie. You do know to use the tranquiliser gun for her if we need to, right? No other weapon can affect her well enough.”, she asked, specifically turning to me.

“Of course I do!”, I replied. I never expected to use it, but I still hadn’t forgotten my onboarding training from the previous year.

Soon, we managed to reach the docks, only to see a lone mid-sized boat speed away from us. I didn’t know enough about boats to identify its type, but it appeared to be both fast and seaworthy, the perfect getaway boat.

And in one of the slips…

“Oh, god!”, I said as I stared at the pools of blood in the water. A few metres away, two bodies were floating, covered in bleeding stab wounds. They were young men, no older than 20. There was no doubt who did this… the brutality of their deaths still shocked me. Behind me, Sam stopped dead in his tracks, covering his mouth in shock as he took in the horrifying scene.

While we stood in horror, Diana quickly regained her composure. “Come on!”, she jolted us, “There’s no time for this!”.

“That’s her! The tracker says she’s there! We need to get her now!” Diana yelled as we navigated the concrete paths along the rows of boats. The scorching Miami heat had caused me to already be drenched in sweat as I ran.

A minute later, we stopped in front of a red and white boat not too different from the boat we were currently pursuing. 

“And there it is, our boat!”, Dr. Raj exclaimed. “All of you get in and figure out where she’s going, I’ll drive this thing!”

“You can pilot boats?”, I asked incredulously as I hurried onto the deck.

“Of course! Now tell me where I should pursue her!”

“She’s going out into the open sea! Hurry or we’ll miss her!”

The boat started with a deafening roar and turned its way out of the harbour into the open ocean, where Aurora was escaping to. 

A short while later, Sam shouted, “There it is! That’s the boat she took!”, while pointing a finger straight at a speeding blue boat. Glancing at the red dot denoting her location on the tracker, it was clear that the boat was indeed piloted by her. We continued speeding up to her to capture the boat, but she always outmanoeuvred us at every turn.

“Fuck this”, said Diana, “Sam pass me the loudspeaker!”

Sam reached into a large black bag and pulled out a loudspeaker.

“Aurora, it’s us! The researchers!”. Her voice softened. “Stop this and come back. I promise there won’t be any consequences. Just get here right now.”

The only response we got was a few bullets shot our way. “Duck!”, I yelled as they whizzed by our boat, almost as if they were intentionally shot to miss us. 

“Forgot to tell you”, started Sam, “but she seems to have taken our credit cards, a few guns, and- “

A grenade whizzed by just a hair’s length away, causing the boat to manoeuvre sharply to the right.

“And a grenade launcher!”, he finished.

“Aurora. End this now!”, Diana exclaimed calmly, but it didn’t seem that Aurora was listening, judging by the continued volley of bullets approaching us.

“Everyone on deck, fire! We need to stop her from speeding away!” Raj shouted as we continued trying to avoid the flying bullets the best we could. 

Immediately, I swiftly pulled out my gun and loaded the tranquilisers in, before taking aim and firing at her boat. The bullets flew across the blue sea and…

I wish I could say I got a clean shot straight at her, but of course, we ended up firing at the general vicinity of her boat. It was difficult to aim straight at her as her boat was quite far away and moving erratically.

As another projectile flew at us, I yelled, “Raj! Get us closer to her boat we need a better shot-”. But before I could complete, the boat lurched and shook with a bang, knocking us all off our feet.

“Aaaah! What happened?”

“One of our engines is down!” Raj yelled from the cabin. “We can’t chase her anymore! We need to get back on the other engine!”

As the boat tilted dangerously to its side, Diana yelled, “We’ll call this one off! Go back! We can’t get her like this!”. As our damaged boat hobbled back to the coast, the blue boat we were pursuing eventually became smaller and smaller until it faded out into the horizon. Somehow, we reached the docks while staying somewhat dry, and left the boat to hopefully be salvaged.

Back home at the lab, we swiftly cancelled our credit cards, but it seemed to be too late. Almost all the money had been withdrawn! I surmised that she had huge plans for herself. 

Afterwards, we sat dejectedly while monitoring the bright red dot. In particular, Diana seemed affected by our failure to bring her back. The deaths of those men, too, weighed heavily on her, as it did all of us. ,Wanting to distract her, I decided to scoot over to where she was sitting.

“Hey”, I said.

“Hey”, she replied, looking up from her screen for a moment.

“So, um, what’s the next plan?”

“Well, we can’t really engage her on the open water right now. So, we’ll wait until she’s going to reach land. She can’t be out forever right? Then, we’ll go wherever she is.”

“Sounds like a plan.”, I replied. Well, it was the best we had anyways.

A few days later, we got to put our plan in action.

Pointing to the location tracker, Diana announced, “She’s approaching Cancún.”.
