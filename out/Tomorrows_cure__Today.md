The streets had never been more divided. People shouted at each other from opposite sides of the barricades, their faces twisted with anger, fear, and confusion. Mia had never felt this on edge before. It wasn’t just the protests anymore; it was the tension in the air, the sense that something had broken, something that couldn’t be fixed.

It had been two years since President Trump had won his second term, and the country was teetering on the edge of collapse. The economy was in shambles. Inflation was out of control. Jobs had evaporated overnight, replaced by automation and mass layoffs. People were desperate, and the government had no real answers, only more promises, more distractions.

Mia tried to avoid the news. Every broadcast was the same: Trump’s latest rant on social media, his bizarre press conferences, the chaotic fallout from every decision. They said he was untouchable. The rule of law no longer seemed to matter. Political opponents disappeared, businesses were bulldozed, and the cities that once thrived were now a patchwork of abandoned buildings and surveillance drones overhead.

Her phone buzzed, breaking her from her thoughts. It was a message from a friend, a whisper in the digital night.

“They’re coming for the dissenters. You have to be careful.”

Mia had heard rumours about people being detained for speaking out against the administration. The camps had been set up on the outskirts of the city, hidden in plain sight. Some said they were “re-education centres,” but no one knew for sure. Those who went in never came back.

The doorbell rang, and Mia’s heart skipped. She didn’t expect anyone. There was a brief silence, followed by a knock. Her pulse quickened. They were too organised for it to be a neighbour.

“Who is it?” she asked, her voice hoarse.

A pause. Then, “Delivery.”

Her breath caught. The only deliveries were ration packages. Had they finally sent hers? She hadn’t expected it. She hadn’t expected anything.

She opened the door slowly, wary. A man in a dark, nondescript suit handed her a small, sealed envelope. No words, no explanation, just a stare that lingered too long.

She closed the door quickly, her hands trembling as she opened it. Inside was a single sheet of paper, folded neatly. Her breath hitched as she read the words:

“We are still watching. Don’t try to escape.”

The silence in her apartment felt suffocating, as if the walls were closing in. The knock at the door wasn’t just about the message, it was a reminder of everything that had changed. The whispers in the streets were louder now, people talking in hushed voices about disappearances, about the "loyalty tests" that had begun to surface. No one was safe anymore.

She grabbed her phone, hesitated, then locked the screen again. It had become a tool for surveillance, tracking every move, every conversation, but what was once a lifeline to the outside world now felt like a leash.

Her eyes scanned the room, the small, cluttered space she’d once felt at home in. Now, it felt like a cage. She had no family left, just a few distant friends who were also too scared to speak openly. The thought of running, of leaving everything behind, flickered through her mind. But where would she go? How could she escape when every corner was watched?

The truth of it gnawed at her—the truth that she could never fully escape who she was. Being gay in this regime was another strike against her, another thing to hide. The government didn’t just monitor loyalty; it hunted for "deviants," anyone who didn’t fit the narrow mould they had defined. She had to stay silent, stay hidden. She had to pretend she was straight, just like everyone else.

Another message came through. It was from the same friend: “They know. They always know. Stay quiet. Stay hidden.”

Mia let out a shaky breath. There was no escaping. She wasn’t sure how much longer she could keep pretending everything was normal. Or how long she could keep hiding a part of herself that was so essential to who she was.

Days passed in a blur of quiet dread. Mia stayed inside, the weight of her secret and the threat of discovery bearing down on her. She stopped leaving the apartment entirely. The walls, once familiar, now felt like they were closing in. The world outside had become a constant reminder of how fragile everything was.

Then it happened.

The knock on her door was louder this time—forceful. Mia’s heart dropped into her stomach. She didn’t even hesitate this time; she knew who it was. The officers had come before, asking questions, looking for dissenters, for "deviants." The threat had always been there, but now it felt real. The breath caught in her throat as she slowly moved towards the door, her palms slick with sweat.

She peeked through the peephole. There were two of them, both in black uniforms, faces hidden behind masks. They weren’t here to ask about rationing.

Mia turned, her pulse racing. Her mind screamed at her to run, but there was no way out. They had already seen her, already tracked her every move.

With a sudden crash, the door was kicked in. Strong hands grabbed her before she could react, dragging her out of the apartment. She could hear her own breath, frantic, shallow, as the world spun.

They had found her. And now, there would be no hiding.

The drugs made everything hazy. Mia drifted in and out of consciousness, her thoughts slow and tangled. At first, she fought it, tried to resist, to keep her mind sharp. But the chemicals dulled everything, made time stretch and twist. She wasn’t sure how long she had been in the facility. Days? Weeks? There were no windows, no clocks, just the constant, suffocating presence of her captors.

The sessions were relentless. Bright lights. Cold rooms. The voice of the doctor, always calm, always patient.

“This is for your own good, Mia,” she would say. “You’re confused, but we can help you.”

Then came the shocks. Strapped to a gurney, electrodes pressed against her temples, white-hot pain exploding behind her eyes. She screamed, but no one listened. The priest stood nearby, murmuring prayers as if that could cleanse her.

They made her watch propaganda filled with smiling couples, a man and a woman, hand in hand, their perfect nuclear families. “This is the natural order,” they told her. “This is what’s right.” She stopped responding. Stopped arguing. It didn’t matter. They weren’t here to debate. They were here to break her.

One day, they brought in a mirror. Forced her to look at herself. She barely recognised the reflection. Hollow cheeks. Sunken eyes. A body that no longer felt like hers.

“Say it,” the doctor urged.

Mia swallowed, her throat dry. “I am cured.”

The doctor smiled. The priest nodded approvingly.

But it wasn’t true. Mia wasn’t cured. She was just… gone.

That night, she lay on the thin cot in her cell, staring at the ceiling. The pain never stopped. The ache in her chest, the weight pressing down on her ribs, the feeling that she had already died long ago.

She closed her eyes.

In the morning, they found her cold. Another lost cause. A statistic.

And Mia, the girl who had once dared to love, was forgotten.
