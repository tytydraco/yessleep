Me and my parents had just moved to a small house on the outskirts of a remote town. It was a fairly old and cheap house. We live in 3 skeleton street. But now we live in 20 john street. We had moved in for a week as our old house had leaks and poor drainage. The house only had a few rooms, my room, my parents room, the bathroom and the kitchen. My room was in a corner between the kitchen and my parents room. The house was probably worse than our old one but we had to make do.

Once we arrived at the house I looked at the decrepit old shack we had to live in and my heart dropped. I went to my room. It was small and There was a window which looked into a forest. There was a small note on the table saying “John 3:20, everyone who does evil, hates the light. And will not come into the light for fear of being exposed.” I let out a sigh as I fell onto my bed. I texted my girlfriend Allyson. I told her how much of a mess my new place was but that it was only for a week. Suddenly, my parents called me into the kitchen for dinner so I put the phone down and left. 


I went into the kitchen and sat down as they ate their poor quality spaghetti. Their faces were mundane as usual. My mother said “I would ask how you are but I've been stuck with you guys all day.” my dad simply nodded and continued eating. We sat there awkwardly for a while. Once I had finished I said goodnight to them and went to bed. 


I woke up. I looked at my phone and it was past midnight. I was about to go back to sleep when I smelled a sickly smell coming from my closet. If smelled of rotten meat.  I got up and walked over to the closet and held my nose. I opened the closet and saw that it was larger than I expected. I reached through the clothes and cobwebs. I felt something warm and furry on my hand. Like I had touched a blood stained blanket. I pulled out a dead mangled corpse of a mouse. I heard the faint sound of a clock ticking. My stomach churned. I held it in my palm and walked out of the closet to the window. I chucked the mouse out of the window and held myself from vomiting. I wiped my bloody hand on a towel and tried to get back to sleep.


The next morning I woke up to my mother screaming in the kitchen. This was odd because it was only 3’20 in the morning. I walked tiredly into the kitchen. The lights were extremely dim and the room seemed dirtier than before. She had the song she hated most playing. Tiptoe through the tulips. I saw her with a blister on her hand and boiled water spilled everywhere. She popped the blister and blood spewed out. I winced and felt my insides move. She continued making the tea. Then she turned around to place tea on the table. She noticed me and I noticed her eyes look directly at me, not her face, just a small side eye. I froze. Something was wrong. She looked like my mother, but off. She seemed less human, like something that was trying to be human. Her eyelids were indented and her teeth were too straight. She smiled and looked at me. “Hey darling, I was just making us all some tea.” I stepped back and turned around. I Heard the door to my parents room slam open and I saw my dad’s eyes staring at me. He also looked off. He said “Did I hear you say tea dear?” He grabbed my shoulder, walked over to the table and sat down. I was petrified. I felt his dirty nails and rubbery fingers dig into my shoulder. My hands trembled and I looked up at him, he was facing his mother but I could see out of the corner of my eye that his eyes were locked on me. His grin giving the room a sense of eerie awkwardness. I shook him off me. Looked at him as he continued smiling at me. He said “Now boy, don't go into the light, for we cannot protect you there.” He slowly walked towards me but sprinted back into my room before he could catch up.


I locked the door. I was shaking all over. Swear beading down my forehead. I wonderd what happened to my parents, or if they even were my parents. I started texting my girlfriend about what happened. She didn't seem scared. She kept on asking for a selfie of me. I was confused but reluctantly sent her one. She sent a voice note of her laughing distortedly. She sent me a selfie of herself. As I looked at it my heart stopped. She herself was like my parents. But that's not what scared me. I was in the photo. On my bed through a window. I quickly looked left but saw nothing. I hid under my covers and tried to drift off.


I kept myself in that room for days. It had been more than a week, we should have left by now. I was starving but I didn't care. Sometimes I would hear knocking on my door with my parents' strange voices asking me to open the door. One night I was planning on going back out to get food. Maybe it was a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night smelling a stench again, maybe this was the way out. I slowly walked back into the closet. I stuck my head through the.Clothes and looked around, while my head was behind the clothes, I felt a breath on my neck. I shot my head around but I didn't see anything. Nothing was there but a ticking clock. I sprinted to my bed. I jumped in and pulled the covers over me. I waited for what felt like ages. I tried to get back to sleep but I couldn't. I didn't hear any noises. My hands shook as I pulled the covers off of me and opened a single eye.  I saw nothing. I looked left and right. Still nothing. I waited there, building confidence to sit up. They couldn't be here, it's not possible. I slowly got up and looked to the end of the bed. I froze.

 I saw my mother's smiling face staring at me from the end of my bed. That's when I knew this wasn't my mother.
