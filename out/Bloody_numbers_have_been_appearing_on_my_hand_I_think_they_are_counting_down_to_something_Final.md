I was moved into a well decorated sitting room and directed to wait in a comfortable looking chair. An attendant with an odd mask that looked like a mirror came in and gave me a small cup of tea. I was informed that I had to wait for the Master of Sanctity. That title referred to the leader of this group and the man in the ornate, gleaming mask I had met earlier.

After waiting for several minutes, I tried the tea. It smelled nice and tasted good as well. The paranoid part of my mind almost resisted the drink, but I figured that they had saved my life and wouldn't poison me now.

I felt exhausted and drained and nearly fell asleep in the chair, until the door swung open again. Their leader was there and he sat on the chair opposite my own. He dismissed his attendant and apparently wished to speak with me privately.

“I am relieved to see you are up and about. I must say it has been a while since we have been able to save someone like this. Most victims give in to the hunger and are beyond our salvation. You have a remarkable will.”

I nodded grimly and was not sure if I should thank him for the compliment or cut thru the distractions and ask about what they were going to do next. He continued before I could decide,

“Yes, you are an interesting case. Though now that you have survived.” He paused, considering his next words.

“I am afraid I must ask you something difficult. I must ask that you help us find those you have been in contact with and determine their.....wellbeing.” I knew he meant who might have been infected and when. I immediately thought of Cass. A pit in my stomach grew when I considered they might help her or kill her, depending on if she had succumbed to this horrible curse.

I did now want her to suffer for my mistake; I did not want to risk them hurting her. Yet I considered the horror of what she might do to others, being manipulated by those “Blood Phages” as they called them. I thought about how she would never hurt a fly, and how those things might have already convinced her to rip someone apart. To Cass, that might be a fate worse than death.

I made up my mind, I would cooperate. I would have to live with the consequences of whatever happened next.

After a long pause, I gave him my answer,

“Yes... yes I will help you find everyone I can, everyone I remember.” The Master of Sanctity nodded his head solemnly and stood up, gesturing me to follow him.

“Come then, we have much work to do. Now that you are here, you will need our help as well. Whatever you do next, you are a part of this world, and there are things you need to have and things you must know.”

We walked down an ornate hallway with gothic architecture. Many decorative gargoyles lined the walls, the faces and expression not unlike the masks of the order members.

We emerged into a large hall that looked like a medieval armory. Archaic weapons stood in lined shelves and were flanked by racks of more modern equipment. I saw what looked like a variety of firearms and even grenades and other ordinance. There were also shelves of glass containers with odd looking liquids gleaming in the dim torchlight.

I was shocked by the contents of the armory, but was pulled along into the room and as soon as we entered, several order members stood at attention as the Master of Sanctity approached.

He made some hand gestures in some sort of sign language and then spoke to the nearest order member.

“We need equipment for a new initiate.” I heard the word initiate and did a double take,

“Wait, what? I thought you just needed my help finding the people I came into contact with? I never said anything about joining this group.”

He held up a hand to silence me and titled his head,

“I know you had no intention of joining us. Days ago you never knew we existed, yet here we are. We never planned on having you, but the danger posed by the Blood Phages demands action. Those who know of their existence, also know the danger. Knowledge is power, use that power. You have a responsibility to deal with this threat, even if you were manipulated, you still helped spread the curse, for that you must sacrifice. You must relinquish the bliss of ignorance. You must sacrifice your freedom to be a bystander and put this behind you. Indeed, you must help us put a stop to this curse. Then when it is over, we may rest and our duties will be fulfilled. Until that day, you owe us your life and your service.”

My jaw nearly hit the floor. I could not believe I was being enlisted to fight in this cult like order, against a nightmarish, sentient blood disease. It was all too much, but I hated to admit, he was right. I would have been dead without their help and if joining them could help stop the spread of this curse, I had little leverage to decline.

I nodded my head and he returned the gesture and several masked attended went scrambling thru the armor grabbing items from the shelves. One of the attendants handed my one of the odd vials of liquid. I looked back at them dubiously but the Master of Sanctity just nodded his head and gestured for me to drink it.

"The Kykeon is a necessary protection. It helps us keep up with the unnatural speed and strength of the worst abominations that the Blood Phages can create. The effect is temporary and there is no lasting side effect beyond some mild halitosis." He chuckled and bid me to drink the liquid. I was unsure about it, but considering what I had put up with the last few days, I would take any edge I could get.

I drank the contents of the vial in one swig and the taste was awful. I almost gagged but I felt a hot surge in my muscles and an odd invigorating sensation. I couldn't believe it, but even though I had almost died yesterday, I suddenly felt like I could wrestle a grizzly bear.

After imbibing the strange potion I was ushered into a sort of changing room and was told to put on a strange transparent body suit, under my other clothes. At that point I was done questioning everything and just did as instructed.

I was surprised to find the strange suit tightened over my frame once I had it on and I realized it must be some sort of protective second skin. Then I was given a large coat, much like the other order members I had seen before. The coat was heavy and had a lot of small pockets and even a sort of inline, utility belt. Finally, I was given the last piece which I had half expected at that point.

The snarling visage of a wicked looking gargoyle stared back at me from the helmet that was set down on the table across from me. I looked down at it and then to the others in the room. I did not decline to wear it, but I asked one question before I moved to take it,

“Why gargoyles?”

The Master of Sanctity answered my question,

“Humans are weak and frail, they have often been subject to the whims of evil spirits, preyed on since time immemorial. The Blood Phages are as much a spiritual disease as a physical one. As such we have often sought our own monsters to protect us. Gargoyles and other monstrous figures have been used to ward off evil spirits. We may be just humans, but sometimes we must become monsters to protect humanity.”

The grim rationale made sense, especially in this very literal case of evil spirits and monsters. I reached for the mask and without further ceremony, placed it on my head. It was a bit stifling inside, but soon I realized that I could see surprisingly well out of it.

The others looked on in silent approval as I stood among them. I was a part of the order now, whether I wanted to be or not.

After I donned the mask and accepted the initiation into the order, I was taken over to the small armory and given a set of tools. I was doubtful about my ability to fight these things and wondered if there was supposed to be some sort of training program. As if reading my mind, the Master of Sanctity spoke,

“You survived, you made it this far. There is technique we can teach you, but the natural ability to survive is the most potent weapon against these monsters. They prey on fear, they infect the vulnerable. Your spirit is more important than any of these tools.” He reached to a shelf and secured short blade with a strange looking vent on the side of the edge.

“The tools however, will help you finish the job.” The dim room blazed into light as he pressed a button on the handle of the short sword and a gout of flame engulfed the surface and almost threatened to reach beyond and ignite the wooden furniture in the room. I almost fell back, but saw the other order members standing still as the flame leapt out. I steadied myself, slightly embarrassed by my initial fear and looked back at the Master of Sanctity.

He was handing the weapon to me, and I accepted it cautiously. I had not been trained to fight humans, let alone monsters made of blood, but this thing would help against either.

The other people in the room grabbed various tools and weapons and we departed shortly after.

“We are leaving now and you must return home. That is where they are likely waiting to recapture you. That may also be where anyone else who is waiting for you would look.” I paused at the implication and realized that if Cassandra had escaped she would be looking for me too. I prayed I was not too late and nodded my head in agreement.

Myself and four other order members embarked in the non descript van and I directed them to my house. The rest of the order was mobilizing to a different location. I asked why we were not staying together and found out this other location, had apparently been hollowed out and turned into a “Nest”. I did not like the sound of it. Especially since more of the order would not be able to accompany me back home.

We arrived at dusk and the lights were out. I was not surprised and part of me was glad it seemed empty. I was as afraid to see Cass, as I was hopeful. I did not know if this thing had consumed the woman I knew and replaced her with some living virus that only wished to infect me again with the monstrous plague I had unknowingly given her just a few days ago. I wondered if she had a bloody number on her own hand, counting down the days until she would become something monstrous. I tried to shake the morbid thoughts from my mind as we prepared to disembark.

The other order members stepped out and beckoned me to follow. We slowly approached the house and everything was still quiet.  It was not until we were nearly at the door that we saw something. Our flashlights shined upon a dark red stain on the floorboards of the patio and the door. There were also what appeared to be prodigious scratch marks all along the surface of the deck.

I felt pressure in my head and heard a familiar voice speaking to me again. It sounded distant, but still horribly, alive.

“Welcome.....home.....we missed you.”

I shouted out a warning to the others, but it was too late. Something burst from the deck, splintering wood and crashing over two of my comrades. They were enveloped in a horrifying mass of bloody flailing limbs. I heard the discharge of a firearm and the attempted lighting of a flame thrower, but both were snuffed out in short order.

I froze, unsure of how to help. I realize I was clutching the sword I had been given and had to help fight this atrocity somehow. The other order members fell back and I saw one of them throw of glass bottle on the monstrous, bleeding mass. A horrible, ear splitting screech was heard as the liquid inside connected with the creature and before it could recover, the other order member turned the nozzle on a flame weapon and doused the thing in waves of fire.

The monstrous bulk caught fire, but to my horror it surged forward and struck the other two order members off their feet with its bloody pseudopods.

I knew I had to help. I started to move forward, weapon raised. Then I heard the voice in my head again,

“She is with us, you can be with her again. Soon......so soon......Rejoin.....”

I shook my head, as if the act would make the voice go away. If Cass was in the house, one way or the other I would get to her. I charged forward and activated the flaming burst on the small sword and lunged at the monster. I struck the center of the things mass, but to my dismay it had little effect.

The thing wrapped a bloody appendage around me and hurled me into my own front door. The force was so great I knocked the already battered door down and off the hinges. I saw stars and almost passed out. I felt like I had broken some ribs and I looked up in a daze to see the horrid creature on my porch lumbering towards me. I felt like that should have killed me but I found the strength to rise to my feet and appreciated what the strange elixir had done to help.

I heard shouting and another plume of flame engulfed the monster followed by multiple glass bottle breaking. The screaming was intense and I covered my ears from the horrible agony of the abominations cries. I soon realized those cries had been its death throes and my companions had managed to neutralize the hideous thing.

They moved into the house with me, battered but alive. One of their masks had broken partly, revealing the bald surface of an older looking head underneath. I wondered again about this group of people I had found myself working with. They were very good at this and despite my initial fear and retreat from them days ago, I knew they were ruthlessly dedicated to their cause.

Before I could ask them how we should do this, I heard a cry upstairs that froze my heart. It was faint but I knew who it was when I heard it. It was a cry for help from Cass! I knew at that moment it was likely a trap but it didn't matter I had to find her.

I rushed upstairs, past disturbing tendrils of congealed blood that snaked across the walls. The place was corrupted by this disease and I dreaded what I would find when I reached the source. The two order members who were following me shouted in unison and ducked back as the stairwell was raked by automatic fire. I looked out the hall window as I was ascending and saw men in hazmat suits on the lawn. They were dousing the destroyed body of the blood monster with some sort of coolant and trying to secure the thing. Others in suits and body armor had spotted us and as soon as they saw our masks they had opened fire when our backs were turned.

My comrades stumbled back down the stairs, one of them clutching a bleeding shoulder. They waved me on and produced firearms of their own. I did not have time to help I had to move on. I rushed the rest of the way up the stairs and followed the eerie glow of the blood slicked tendrils. They looked like veins leading to the very heart of the evil that had blighted our lives.

I threw the door open to the master bedroom and I saw her. Cassandra was there laying on our bed. Despite the horrifying tendrils of blood and gore all around us, she was pristine, untouched. I held my breath and tried to determine if I was dreaming or not. The sight was surreal and I took a step forward into the room and blinked hard, hoping I was really seeing her.

I inched closer and her eyes opened. When I looked into them, my heart sank and my hope failed. Her eyes were blood red pools with no pupils, that reflected the stunned image of my own face back at me. I struggled for words and only managed to mumble,

“How?”

She grinned at me and the sight was hideous with her crimson gaze.

“I had to escape, I had to find you and bring you back. We can still be together; we can both live out our wildest dreams, free to do as we please. We can be connected forever. All we have to do is let them in and feed them.”

I looked around the room and saw the emaciated bodies of men in white lab coats and realized she must have escaped. She was not here waiting to trap me and bring me back to the scientists and Doctor Stillman, she had escaped with the help of the Blood Phages.

I knew at that point she had fed them. The human husks in the lab coats were evident to that. The revelation destroyed me as I understood that the process that had cured me was no use to her. I sank to my knees. I wanted to cry, to scream, to do something. But all I could do is sit dumbly as she moved closer.

She touched my face and her hand was warm, it reeked of fresh blood and I swear I could hear that voice speaking to me from within the confines of her own veins. She held my face in her hands and smiled, a genuine smile that reminded me of the real her.

“Come back to us, come back to me.” Her nails elongated and I saw the gleam of the sharp edges in my peripheral vision. I had made my choice, I knew what I had to do.

I leaned into her and she embraced me and raised her hand up. Then she gasped and screeched as the flaming edge of the burning blade emerged from her back. The cauterizing stench of hot blood was horrible. As I saw the writhing, possessed blood trying to escape its host, and the demonic face of Cassandra crying out. I knew that was already gone.

There was a terrific blast of heat and a sort of haze in the air moments before a bloody explosion annihilated the remains of the love of my life.

I thought I had died in that moment. Part of me wishes I had, to be with her again, the real her. But I was not so lucky. I was pulled out of the wreck of the burning house at some point by the order.



Since then I have been recovering here with the order. I was in pretty bad shape, but I am starting to feel better. The down time has made me restless, so I am sharing my story with you now. The order would likely not approve of my decision to do so, but perhaps those who read and believe my story will understand the threat that we face and if they see the signs, they can take action accordingly.

The order still has work to do and I am reminded every day that the job is not done. I have to find the others, the doctors, the pedestrians, anyone I came into contact with. I have to save them, or at least stop them from becoming what I nearly did and what Cass was condemned to.

I will never forgive myself for what I did, but I swear to her memory I will keep going. As long as those things are out there, preying on people, I will be out there hunting them. As long as the bloody numbers continue to count down others doom, my work will not be complete.
