In the Emerald Pine pub, the owner who worked the bar had a son. He put his son to work in the storeroom cleaning organizing and stocking things. He wasn’t older than eleven. One day, as the story goes, the boy had gotten into to liquor. After the father noticed his son was missing, he went down to investigate. Finding his inebriated son, the man began to beat him mercilessly. It's said that due to the alcohol the child didn’t react in the normal apologetic and fearful way, Causing the father to beat him harder. Afterwards the father left him on the cold stone floor, turning the light off before he left. The boy died on the floor that night, completely helpless.

Thats how to old story goes, after that the pub was renovated about 15 years ago into the Verdant Ridge Inn. Reports of an apparition started floating about. That there was a ghostly hand that would turn off lights around the hotel. It is even claimed that if you see this spirit multiple times it begins to follow you. I was extremely interested in this spirit, because unlike most local ghost stories it wasn’t malicious and its so well documented. Everyone I know accepts this as truth and here's what I’ve gathered from talking to the employees. They’re all infected. The hand will turn off any light It can reach. The employees usually develop a ritual of walking around in the dark and making sure never to leave a light on making this one of the most energy efficient hauntings ever recorded, Dads everywhere would be proud! Jokes aside, The claim is that it eventually leaves you alone if you’re diligent about not letting it turn off the light. Apparently this haunting to the staff has mostly been an annoyance/ occasionally helpful but guests of the inn have reported otherwise. According to those I’ve talked to speaking of the apparition is another way to lessen its activity. This is why i decided to post this, to reach as many of you as possible.

I arrived at my room. The inn was a fairly clean and new place despite its history and the part of town it was in. I unpacked my bags and took a look around my room. Everything seemed normal. I meandered around the halls taking photos and hunting for this spirit. I quickly realized my picture taking was probably lowering my chances of seeing the apparition and was definitely bothering some of the other guests. I decided to abandon my camera equipment in my room and go directly to the source. The basement. I probably could have asked the staff but instead I waited until night. I crept down through the lobby and slid my credit card between the door and doorframe, effectively jimmying the door to the old tavern area open. I began to feel uneasy walking through the darkened pub, all of the antiquated decor casting shadows in the moonlight outside. I pushed forward to behind the bar and then to the back room.

The stairs down to the storage room were narrow and steep making them appear far longer than they probably were. The light in the back only properly illuminated the first few steps making the landing appear as an inky blackness. There was a light in the stairway. A single incandescent caged bulb hanged in the center of the stairs. A simple switch at either end. The dim wavering light of the bulb made traversing the climb a considerable task. As I began my long descent, I began to feel this cold creeping dread, like this was a huge mistake. I foolishly persisted. Step by creaky step my fear grew, and I was frozen beneath the bulb. I squinted through the dark as I could barely see the exit to this claustrophobic corridor. I could see a sliver of the bare stone floor beneath me, this gave me chills thinking about the buildings supposed history. I looked up at the dangling light above me conjuring an image of the sword of Damocles. After an eternity I committed to taking the step and like clockwork Around the corner I saw a movement. When I had heard these stories, I had pictured a small, disembodied hand, ethereal and luminous. Instead of the pale blue appendage I witnessed something far worse.

Around the corner came an emaciated hand up to the wrist. It moved in quick snapping motions, stiff and inflexible. The hand itself was black with decay and the petrified skin was tight and cracking revealing decrepit muscle beneath. The fingers moved independently like the legs of an insect as the hand fingered the switch before finally pulling it into its off position. I struggled to turn around in the cramped passage. I fell to my hands and knees as I scrambled back up the stairs frantically trying to return to safety. After a long minute of trying to catch my breath, I peered down the staircase again. Flicking the light back on from my side I contemplated Making the journey again, but I couldn’t bring myself to do so. I sat there for a while regaining my composure before carefully creeping my way back to my room. I was in the hallway a few feet from my door when i heard the floorboards creak on the other end of the hall. A wave of embarrassment washed over me as I prepared to explain why I’m lurking around at night and how I’m not some pervert. I spun around to find my embarrassment replaced with terror. At the end of the hall around the door frame I saw the arm reaching again before the room turned pitch dark.

I practically dove into my room slamming the deadbolt into place. I turned on all the lights in my room and paced, making sure everything was locked and secure. I don't remember falling asleep but when I awoke it was because of a smell. An aged mildewy musk wafted towards me. I woke up slowly and stared bleary eyed at the thing in front of me, I was frozen in terror as my vision returned and I had fully awoken. Before me the long, blackened arm reached out from beneath my bed, barely able to grab the small pull chain of the lamp in front of me. Again, I found myself in the dark. I pulled my covers over my face and stayed motionless. The remained of the night I swear I could hear raspy, labored breathing beneath me.

The thing followed me home and became a daily occurrence. It still frightened me but keeping it away was simple enough. I grew to expect to see the mummified decomposed hand reaching around the corner whenever I left any light switch unattended. This brings us to tonight and why I need to tell as many people as possible. I'm hoping this works the same as word of mouth because I don’t think I have much time left... Last night after leaving the bathroom I realized I hadn’t closed the door, making the light switch accessible. I turned hoping to close the door before the ghost could get to the light, but I was too late. This wasn’t an unusual occurrence though but what was unusual is the position of the room.  From where I was standing, I could see the mirror above the sink in the bathroom. Against the opposite wall stood a tall, emaciated figure reaching around the corner with his elongated, twisted arm. His body was slender as if he was a boy stretched out to be the size of an adult. He was completely nude revealing his twisted hunched posture and cracked hardened skin. His face was round and nearly hairless. Permanent grin hardened tight over the boney cheeks and piercing eyes. The eyes were big and sad like a begging puppy, this contrasting with the bone white teeth and the locked smile was chilling. We made extended eye contact before the room fell into darkness. I bolted into the adjacent bedroom as I heard a new sound. Light uneven footsteps swiftly following me from out of the bathroom. I barricaded myself inside. I have all the lights on including flashlights and candles. I sit writing this as it gently scratches at the door breathing heavily. God, I hope this works.
