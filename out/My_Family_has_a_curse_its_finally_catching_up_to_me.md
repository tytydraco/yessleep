Growing up, my family was never like other families I had known..   I remember being six, no- seven, maybe six and a half? And noticing little things that made my father unlike other dads in our small cul-de-sac. 



My father’s skin was sallow and white to the bone; regardless of any sun put onto his skin, a trait passed onto me, not that we ever lived anywhere particularly hot to begin with, being from a small town in Upstate New York, but my dad and I managed to stick out like a sore thumb. Perhaps it has something to do with my father spending most of his time working at the local butchers' shop, which was a few short miles down the street from our house. Many nights he would spend in the shop, rarely leaving at all from seven to nine, preparing the pork, sausage, and beef in-house, cutting them down to shape to prepare for the next day of work. 



Often-times, his work kept him long enough in the day where I would hear the door unlock around midnight, head downstairs, and see a figure covered in bloody overalls and carrying a black bloodied bag of meat walk in through the dark hallways, breathing slowly and putting the black bag on the table and taking out whatever blooded remains had been left from that day for his dinner. Something about the smell of the dried meat always bothered me as a kid, but I got used to it as the years went on, like how a farmer's son gets used to the smell of cow shit on a farm, you live with it for a while, and it becomes almost normal. 

  
  
Every year on my birthday, I’d ask the same question, “Can we visit our home country? I’d like to see it for the first time.” My father would kneel beside me and tell me, speaking in his typical low voice with breath cold as ice. “Son, there are things that… are hard to explain. We are not welcome back home. But perhaps someday, it can be safe to go again.” I had hoped every year that one day it would change, that my father would come to me with the biggest smile I had ever seen and tell me, “Son, it is time to go home,” but that day never came; it stayed the same hopeless dream of a young boy who wanted more.



As I got into my late pre-teens, the kids in the neighborhood mocked me relentlessly for my parents from a young age, referring to me as the son of “The Slaughterer”, as if he were a killer in a shitty B-horror movie. Richie White, who lived across the street from my father's work, even spoke of hearing sounds from my Father’s shop, inhumane sounds of screaming and weird sounds that ran through the night, how he saw people who entered my father's shop with him who never came out. The rumors themselves brought back memories of the bloodied black bag and that awful meat stench that made me want to throw up everything I had inside of me. It was all just rumors- *Right?* My father wasn’t a killer, no- I knew him; he was a quiet man, a cold man, but he was never a killer. 



One night, I gathered up the courage to ask my father as he came in the kitchen, black bloody bag in hand “Dad- you aren’t… bad right? For killing animals?”, my father, cold and icy as ever, measured me with his deep blue eyes “All men have their demons son, a willingness inside to act in ways they perhaps should not. I do what I do to survive, to provide for us, to keep our family going. Do you understand?” I nodded firmly, “Good boy, now, tell me true, why do you ask me such things? Did someone say something?”  I looked from left to right. I didn’t want to get Richie in trouble. My father must have known something was up, as he grabbed my face, measuring me as he usually did with a firm gaze and his cold voice. “Tell me the truth, Denis, I need to know. Who was it?” I sighed. This was a fight I was never going to win. I bit my lip as the words tumbled out, “Richie White. He said he heard… noises from inside your shop, noises that sounded…Like screaming and crying.” Slowly, my father spoke one final time with a hint of… perhaps sorrow mixed with pride? “Ignore the man, son, he speaks lies. I run a proud business, as did your grandfather and his father before him. Do not let what others say affect you. You… you  have a history to be proud of, don’t ever forget that.” He said before quickly walking up to bed, before I had a chance to ask if I would inherit the shop one day.



It wasn’t one nightfall after that when Richie went missing after school. The police searched for him all over town, but found nothing. With a lack of evidence, the case got dropped, to the sadness of Richie’s parents, who fought tooth and nail to have their son found.  As the investigation concluded, my mind went back to Richie, and my heart sank- had I killed him? But I shook my head, no, no, my father was no killer, he could never be, would never be, not him, not the man who raised me. The idea made me sick to my stomach. My father wasn’t a killer, how could I even think that? But somehow… it all made sense, I thought of the bloodied black bag, the rumors of screams, of people disappearing….  I had to know the truth, the cold, disgusting truth I would regret knowing for years to come, so I decided to see for myself. I took my bike, and I sped over to the shop. My heart leapt out of my chest as I rode, and I wondered, what would I see? Perhaps I would arrive, open the door to the meat locker, and see nothing but regular hanging meat,  that’s all it would be, right? Just meat, regular meat, nothing more, I had only come to prove to myself that nothing was going on.



When I did make it to the store, I slowly walked through the front all the way to the back. The meat somehow smelled worse here than it did at home, almost smoky and slightly pungent, like someone had created possibly the worst-smelling stew in history and dipped it in shit for good measure. As I walked further, I heard something in the back, it was faint, a *clink, clonk* sound, “Shit!” I thought, “Of course- dad is here, he is going to kill me!”. I almost turned back when I realized what the sound was, it was the sound of slicing meat, I knew it well from all the nights Dad sliced the meat at home when he was too busy at work. “This is my moment,” I thought, “One quick look- he will never notice… and I’ll never have to think about it again.”



Slowly- I crept open the door, and inside I saw Richie lying on the table, his stomach had been cut open neatly from one end to the other in a straight line, all of his organs removed precisely from each and every section of his body, his eyes lay completely closed, his body still and white. And on the other side of the room, my father cut into a piece of organ… I was feeling much too ill by this point to even notice what part. Quickly, I ran, my heart beating out of my chest as I tried to hold back pure vomit in my throat, my mind raced- My dad… was he…. No… he couldn’t…. Was he a cannibal? And mom, oh god mom, did she know… what if I had to tell her? I almost threw up there and then at the thought when my father grabbed me by the shoulder roughly, eying me with a gaze I had never seen before, for once he looked sad, but…. happy? No, I was sure of it. It was the look of pleasure, a look of pure joy and pride hidden beneath sadness, as if he had just heard some fantastic news that would turn his life around, yet couldn't tell anyone. I couldn’t help but notice a stain of *blood* on his lip as he spoke, “My boy, I think it is time you learn who *you really are*…”  

  


Slowly, my father took a step closer. “We aren’t like most families, I am sure you have been aware of that by now. I should have had this conversation with you much sooner, but I was unsure if you were ready. But it is time, I know that now.”



 He took a deep breath in “A long time ago, my father was a Butcher, just like I am, same shop I own now, and I lived there too. We never had much money, but it was a simple life, the kind of life you accept because you have nothing else. In time, I became an assistant to my father, helping him in the butcher’s shop, about your age, running the front to keep the line busy while my father worked on the meat. He hoped I would take over his shop one day, and perhaps I would have… had I not met your mother when she came to pick up an order her father had placed. She was beautiful, blonde hair, dark blue eyes like the sea, and a wonderful smile that you couldn’t forget. We fell for each other head over heels that day and never looked back since. 



“It was around that time one day, your grandfather asked me on a particularly slow day to come down and help him in the back of the butcher's shop… and I saw what he had been hiding from me, inside he was keeping bodies, feasting on them. I walked in just as he drained one from the neck, taking in his blood. I almost ran away, but he saw me just out of the corner of his eye. “Don’t look away,” he told me. “You will have to do the same someday.” He finished his meal and explained to me that many years ago,  our family had come from a long line of vampires… that the meat shop was a front to keep…. Bodies inside, to use for meat and starve off the hunger, to prevent our secret from coming out. He explained to me that inside of us- our family, we had a hunger, a *deep*, uncontrollable *Hunger* for *Blood*… and that some day I would feel it too, “our curse” he called it, as if it was a disease. I think part of me knew, always knew that he had a secret, I just wasn’t sure, nor did I ever want to find out.

 

“I almost fled there and then, had I not realized that I had nowhere to run to, if I went to the police, they’d never believe me, I mean- vampires? I would have sounded like a loon, nor did I have any family outside of town I knew about. I bit my lip and I accepted…. I never told your mother; she would never understand. I love that woman with all my heart, and I couldn’t bear for her to find out what I was capable of, who she really married. Some day you’ll feel it too… deep inside you may already. I want you to help me as my father did, to keep our hunger at bay, so we can have a normal life.”

  


In disgust, I stepped back from my father. I held my throat, trying not to throw up. My father was a good man, a man who raised me and never hurt a fly; this was a good, honest, hardworking man. “*What the fuck is this? You want me to help you do this? Kill people and drink, and butcher them like animals? You are out of your fucking mind! This is disgusting! How could you ever do this!” The* words fell out of my mouth before I could even think about it; somehow, they just appeared as I spoke to the man I thought I knew. At that moment, all the respect I had I lost for my father, and I don’t think I knew it.



“I know you are upset, and I understand… but I have no other choice, we have a hunger, an unending hunger that we need to survive, it is this or die…. Some day, you will know it too, and you will be unable to control it. You can deny who you are, but it will catch up with you.



In that moment, I just ran, ran as fast as I could until I could run no more. Soon, I had lost my dad, and I was free from the horrors I had known. All I could think to do was cry and mourn the life I had once known.



It has been fifteen years since. I live on my own now, far away from my hometown.



 I’ve tried to forget the whole thing. I live a normal life now, engaged to my girlfriend, nice job in finance, probably wouldn’t even know anything was wrong with me.

  
  


But my father was right. *I feel the Hunger*, a few years after, I started to feel it, the intense hunger pains, the drive for blood and meat. Food started tasting less nourishing, more like nothingness, and more and more, *I crave b*lood. I don’t remember when it started; it just did, like something inside me awoke and is never going back to sleep. So far, I have survived off draining animal blood from nearby farms, things most people chaulk up to wild animals, but it is not enough, something inside me always tells me *I want more, fresh human blood.* I can only hope it won’t come to that.



Dad said I would understand one day that we are cursed with this, born into it, and die with it.

  


I think I get it, god, I finally get it.
