It was a quiet Friday evening, around 9:00 p.m., when the familiar tone of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) pierced the air, cutting through the sounds of my TV show. At first, I barely paid attention—EAS alerts were common enough, usually warnings about severe thunderstorms or flash floods. I muted the volume and leaned back on the couch, scrolling mindlessly on my phone, waiting for the high-pitched tones to finish.

I lived alone in a small suburban neighborhood just outside of Richmond, Virginia, far enough from the city to enjoy some peace, but close enough that any major emergency would probably affect us too. The alert didn’t concern me—at least, not right away. But then I saw the message on the screen.

**“EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT A TEST. PLEASE STAND BY FOR AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.”**

My stomach dropped. “This is not a test” were words you never wanted to hear. I grabbed the remote and unmuted the TV, heart beginning to race as I watched the screen flash with that iconic black-and-yellow warning. I put my phone down, suddenly fully alert, my mind racing with possibilities. What kind of emergency could be happening?

A robotic, computerized voice took over, calm and devoid of emotion.

**“This is an emergency broadcast from the Federal Government. At 8:47 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, a catastrophic event was detected. All residents of Virginia, Maryland, and the Washington, D.C. area are advised to remain indoors. Lock all doors and windows. Do not attempt to travel or evacuate. Do not use electronic devices to contact others outside of your immediate household. Await further instructions. Again, this is not a test.”**

A moment of eerie silence followed, the TV screen still displaying the warning text in blocky, ominous letters. My mind was spinning, trying to make sense of what I’d just heard. A “catastrophic event”? What the hell did that mean? An attack? A natural disaster? Why couldn’t we contact anyone?

As I sat there, stunned, I heard my phone buzz beside me. Instinctively, I reached for it and saw the notification from my news app: **“BREAKING NEWS: Reports of mass hysteria in the D.C. area following strange EAS broadcast.”**

I felt a chill run down my spine as I clicked on the notification, only to find the app was loading slowly, far slower than usual. I waited, watching the spinning circle, but nothing happened. I tried switching apps, but they wouldn’t load either. My internet was down. No signal.

“What the hell…” I muttered, now fully on edge.

I stood up, pacing the room, debating whether I should check the doors and windows as the broadcast had instructed. The thought of locking everything made me feel like I was sealing myself in, trapping myself, but that cold sense of dread was starting to creep into my chest.

I went to the front door first, locking it and peering out through the peephole. Everything outside was normal—or, at least, it seemed that way. My quiet neighborhood was bathed in the glow of streetlights, a few cars parked along the street, and houses just like mine, all dark and quiet. No sign of anything catastrophic or unusual.

Still, something was off. The air felt heavy, like the world itself was holding its breath.

I moved through the house, checking all the windows, locking them, and drawing the curtains closed. As I pulled the last curtain shut in the living room, I thought I saw something flicker outside in the distance, near the end of the street, but when I looked again, there was nothing there.

My phone buzzed again, but this time it wasn’t a news notification. It was from *Amber*, my coworker.

**Amber: Hey, did you see the EAS alert? What’s going on? My internet is down.**  
**Me: Yeah, I saw it. I have no idea. The broadcast was super vague. I think we’re supposed to stay inside.**  
**Amber: Do you think it’s like… a terrorist thing? Or worse?**  
**Me: Honestly, I don’t know. Just stay safe. Let me know if you hear anything.**

I put the phone down, my hands trembling slightly. The idea of something “worse” than a terrorist attack gnawed at me. Amber wasn’t the type to freak out, and if she was panicking, maybe I should be too. But what could it be? The broadcast had said a “catastrophic event,” but didn’t explain. And why tell us not to contact anyone? What could possibly be happening that would make that dangerous?

The minutes dragged on. I switched channels, looking for more information, but all I found were the same alerts on every station. No new details. No news. Just silence, broken by that repetitive tone. As the time ticked closer to 10:00 p.m., my anxiety was turning into something deeper—fear.

Then the lights in my house flickered and went out.

I stood there, frozen in place, as the house was plunged into complete darkness. The only sound was the soft hum of the wind outside and my own breathing. I fumbled for my phone and turned on the flashlight, casting an eerie, shaky beam of light through the living room.

The power going out wasn’t a surprise. It happened occasionally during storms, but tonight there was no storm—just that strange broadcast. My first thought was that it must be related, that whatever was happening outside had just reached my neighborhood.

I moved toward the hallway, planning to find some candles, when I heard it—a low, distant sound, almost like a hum. It was barely audible at first, but it grew louder, vibrating through the walls, making my skin prickle with unease. It wasn’t mechanical. It didn’t sound like anything I’d ever heard before.

I tried to ignore it, focusing on finding a flashlight or matches, but the hum continued to grow, rising to a faint, almost melodic tone. I realized it wasn’t coming from inside the house—it was outside, from somewhere in the distance.

I went back to the living room window and, against my better judgment, peeked out through the curtains. What I saw nearly made my heart stop.

At the end of the street, there was movement—figures, moving in a slow, deliberate fashion, coming toward the neighborhood. There were five, maybe six of them, walking in perfect unison. Even in the dim light, I could see they weren’t… normal. Their shapes were wrong—too tall, too thin. Their limbs moved in a way that defied human anatomy, jerky and almost mechanical, but with an unsettling fluidity.

Panic surged through me. I backed away from the window, heart pounding, struggling to breathe. What were they? Why were they here? And why did the EAS warn us to stay inside, to lock everything, to not contact anyone?

I could still hear the hum, now louder and vibrating through my entire body. It was coming from those things. I was sure of it.

I ran to the back of the house, grabbing my phone, trying desperately to call Amber, but the call wouldn’t connect. No service. I was completely cut off.

The figures were getting closer. I could hear them now—soft, rhythmic footsteps, almost in tune with the hum. They were at the end of my driveway.

I backed into the kitchen, gripping the counter, trying to stay calm. I grabbed a knife from the drawer, as if that would help. My mind was racing with what little options I had. I could barricade the doors, try to hide, but if they were coming into the house, I wasn’t sure what good it would do.

Then I heard the doorknob turn.

I froze, staring at the front door as it slowly creaked open, revealing nothing but darkness beyond the threshold. The hum was deafening now, filling the house, vibrating the floor beneath my feet. And then I saw them—those same tall, twisted figures, now standing in my doorway.

They didn’t speak. They didn’t move. They just stood there, humming, watching.

I backed away, my whole body trembling, every instinct screaming at me to run, to hide, but my legs wouldn’t move. I could only stand there, knife in hand, staring at them.

And then, without warning, they stepped inside.

I don’t know what happened next. I blacked out, or maybe I just blocked it from my memory. When I woke up, it was morning. The house was empty, the power was back on, and everything seemed normal. Except for one thing—the EAS message was still on my TV, but this time, there was a new line of text.

**“EVENT RESOLVED. YOU MAY NOW RESUME NORMAL ACTIVITY.”**

But nothing would ever feel normal again.
