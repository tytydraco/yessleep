I was mid-thrust when I saw it: my reflection in the bedroom mirror wasn’t mimicking me anymore.

I paused, staring at the glass as my girlfriend, Melanie, squirmed beneath me.

“What’s wrong?” she whispered, running her nails down my back, but I couldn’t answer.

My reflection was staring right at me. It wasn’t just standing there—its mouth twitched like it was trying to smile and waved.

I stumbled back, pulling out of her, and Melanie sat up, confused.

“What the hell, Daniel?” she snapped, turning to look in the mirror herself.

She didn’t see it.

That night, after Melanie had stormed out, I couldn’t stop staring at the mirrors in my apartment. Every time I moved, the reflection lagged just a little, like it was deciding whether or not to follow.

By midnight, I was brushing my teeth, zoning out like I always do. I spat out the toothpaste and wiped my mouth.

But the version of me in the mirror didn’t.

It just stood there, staring back, grinning wide.

I didn’t scream. I told myself I was tired, that I’d imagined it. But when I flicked the light off and walked away, I swear I heard it knock on the glass.

The next day, I covered every mirror in the house—bathroom, hallway, even the little makeup mirror Melanie left on my dresser. I wasn’t taking any chances.

But when I got home from work, all the covers were gone. The bedsheets I’d draped over the  mirrors were folded neatly on my bed.

I live alone.

I don’t think it likes being hidden.

I invited Melanie over the next night to make up for what happened. She was hesitant at first, but eventually, she caved.

I cleaned the apartment, ordered her favorite Thai takeout, and even put out candles like I was trying to recreate some cheesy romantic movie. Anything to make her forget.

I grabbed my shirt from the bed, tossing it on as I turned back toward the mirror to check myself.

The mirror still showed my bedroom—the bed, the dresser, the soft glow of the lamp in the corner—but I wasn’t in it.

I leaned forward, waving a hand in front of the glass like an idiot. Nothing.

I stepped closer. The mirror was perfectly clean, smooth and polished, but something was off about it—the angle, or the light. It didn’t look like glass anymore. I stopped a foot away, staring at the surface as a ripple spread across it, faint and slow, like a drop of water falling into a pond.

I didn’t touch it. I wanted to, but something in the back of my mind screamed not to.

That’s when I saw a hand.

It looked like mine—but twisted, with sagging skin like wet paper. I didn’t believe it was real until I felt the hand’s icy grip wrap around my wrist.

I screamed, trying to twist away, but its strength was impossible. The thing yanked, pulling me forward. The glass swallowed my arm, then my shoulder, my chest, and finally my head.

I fell hard, the air punched out of my lungs as I landed. The slick ground felt like ice, ready to shatter beneath me.

When I looked up, there was no light. Just endless, suffocating darkness stretching in every direction—except for a faint glow far above, like distant stars.

They weren’t stars.

They were mirrors—small windows peering into the real world. I staggered to my feet, staring at one directly in front of me. My bedroom.

My reflection was standing there, perfectly at ease. It wasn’t a mimic anymore—it was in control, leaning closer to the mirror, staring down at me like an insect trapped in a jar.

Its voice was like mine, but lower and colder, scraping through the air as I felt an unnatural pull to mouth the words in sync with it. I didn’t want to do it. Every muscle screamed to stop, but my body wasn’t mine anymore—it belonged to him.

*"My turn."*

Before I could even process the words, my doorbell rang, distant but unmistakable.

My reflection didn’t hesitate. It smoothed down my shirt, combed its fingers through my hair and I felt my own hands move against my will, mirroring the actions perfectly. I didn’t want to do it. Every muscle screamed to stop, but my body wasn’t mine anymore—it belonged to him.

The reflection turned toward the bedroom door, pausing just before it left. It looked over its shoulder, locking eyes with me through the mirror, and winked.

*Oh no,* I thought, my chest tightening. *Melanie!*

As soon as my reflection left the room, I felt it.
The pull was gone. I could move again, my limbs my own, no longer bound to copy his actions.

“Help,” I screamed,  *there has to be a way out of here.*

I ran deep into the darkness and began to see them—the mirror people.

They moved like puppets on invisible strings, jerking, every motion an imitation of the lives they mirrored. Their body's smooth and pale, like porcelain, cracked and splintered in places, with thin black veins writhing beneath the surface.

One of them turned toward me. Its head snapped unnaturally to the side, the veins crawling up its neck and pooling around its eyes, which weren’t eyes at all—just black, painted circles. Its grin wasn’t real either. The painted lips smeared and chipped at the edges.

I ran. I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

In the distance, a faint glow revealed a figure sitting cross-legged in the darkness, perfectly still. Unlike the others, it wasn’t a jerking marionette with strings pulled by some unseen force in the real world—*my* world.

“Help,” I gasped, staggering toward it. “Please.”

The figure didn’t move. It just tilted its head, watching me.

And then it spoke.

Not out loud. In my mind.

*Welcome to the mirror world, Daniel.*

“How do you know my name?”

*We know everything about you. You’re one of us now.*

“No.” I stepped back, shaking my head. “I’m not. I don’t belong here!”

The glow spread, and I realized we weren't alone. Others stepped out of the shadows—more mirror people. Surrounding me.

“Stay back,” I shouted. 

*We like games,* one said, low and playful. *Do you want to play with us?*

I shook my head. “No. I just want to go home.”

*You are home Daniel. Now, let's play*

The ground pulsed, sending a shiver up my spine. Theirvoices grew louder, sharp and commanding.

*Simon says run.*

My legs moved before I could think. I bolted into the dark, my feet slipping on the wet ground, the sound of their laughter chasing me.

“Stop!” I screamed, but my they didn’t listen.

*Simon didn’t say stop,* they chuckled.

I ran deeper into the darkness, and a pull began. It started as a faint tug in my chest, like a thread winding itself tight around my ribs. With every step, it grew stronger, pulling me backward, dragging me toward the fragments of light far above. Back to my reflection.

I could feel him waiting for me—beckoning me. It wasn’t just a sensation—it was a command, dragging me toward the bedroom mirror with a force I couldn’t fight.

My reflection stood in the bedroom, staring into the mirror with a calm, knowing smile. Melanie was there too. She sat on the edge of the bed, laughing softly at something he had said.

A tinny voice whispered beside me, *She doesn' know. She cannot see.*

I turned—and there she was. A porcelain version of Melanie, cracked like a shattered vase clumsily pieced back together.

*Daniel,* she said, her voice thin and tinny, *I'm looking forward to playing with you.*

“What are you talking about?” I gasped.

Her smile cracked further, *If they do it, we do it too.*

I looked into the mirror to see Melanie smiling as she slipped off her coat.

“You’ve been different lately,” she said, wrapping her arms around my reflection. “In a good way."

He leaned over Melanie, brushing her hair from her face as she laughed softly, oblivious.

*We follow them,* the porcelain Melanie whispered, her voice sweet and hollow, like a lullaby warped by static.

Her hand trailed up my arm, cold with black veins writhing as they curled around my wrist. 

*That’s the rule.*

“No,” I gasped, trying to pull away, but the darkness coiled tighter around me. My body didn’t listen. My limbs moved on their own, mirroring his every action.

Through the mirror, my reflection pressed his lips to Melanie’s.

And so did I.

The porcelain Melanie leaned in, her cold, painted lips brushing against mine. The cracks in her face widened as she smiled, her hands gripping my shoulders with an unnatural strength.

Melanie moaned softly, arching beneath him. The sound echoed faintly in the mirror world, distorted and distant. My reflection moved, his hands trailing down her body—and my hands followed, gripping the cold, brittle skin of the porcelain Melanie.

The mimicry was flawless, every motion perfectly synchronized. My reflection’s rhythm was my rhythm. His movements were my movements.

Through the fragment, I saw Melanie pulling him closer, her nails raking down his back. The porcelain Melanie mimicked her perfectly, her cold, cracked fingers digging into my flesh as her hollow, painted eyes stared into mine.

*You're learning,* She whispered.

Our reflections moved in perfect unison with their counterparts, their jerky, puppet-like motions smooth and deliberate in this moment of mimicry. A symphony of coordination, a grotesque orchestra of mimicry, and I was just another instrument.

The porcelain Melanie moved against me, her painted smile pleased as she whispered, *Isn’t it beautiful?*

My reflection glanced at the mirror, his  eyes locking onto mine for just a moment. He grinned as he said "I love you Melanie."

I fought against it, my mind screaming even as my body obeyed. Every touch, every movement, every sound—I had no control.

The porcelain Melanie tilted her head, her cracked face inches from mine.

*Say it,* she whispered, her voice cold and commanding.

“I won’t,” I choked, my throat tight.

Her smile split, her eyes now burning into mine.

*Simon says say it.*

The words tore from my lips, raw and broken.

“I love you Melanie.”

The porcelain Melanie continued to smile, her black veins pulsing as she pressed closer. 

*You’ll be perfect soon.*

Through the mirror, I saw Melanie collapse into my reflection’s arms.

The porcelain Melanie fell into me, mimicking the moment perfectly, her cold breath brushing against my neck. 

*You’re almost ready,* she whispered, her voice soft and cruel.

“For what?” I asked.

Her painted face gleamed.

*To reflect him.*
