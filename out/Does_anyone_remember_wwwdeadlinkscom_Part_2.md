I jolted awake, gasping for breath. My heart pounding against my ribs, my skin clammy with cold sweat.

I wasn’t in my room.

Blinding fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. The air smelled clinical—like antiseptic and metal. I sat up slowly, my muscles aching, my head heavy with disorientation. The room was small and uncomfortably bare. There was nothing but the stiff, narrow bed I had woken up on and a stainless steel toilet bolted to the corner—something straight out of a prison cell. Panic crept up my throat as I tried to piece together how I had gotten here. The last thing I remembered was—

The thing at my door.

But everything after that? 

Blank.

I forced myself to stand, my legs trembling beneath me as I staggered toward the only door in the room. There was no handle. I pressed my hands against the cold metal, pushing. It didn’t even budge. I started pounding but there was no response.

I was trapped.

With no other option, I sat back down on the bed, staring at the door, waiting. Hoping someone would open it. 

My sense of time had rotted away. 

Minutes bled into hours, hours into days, all devoured by the unrelenting hum of the white fluorescent light. It never flickered, never dimmed, just hung above me like a sterile sun, stretching time into something shapeless. Every time I slept it felt like a new day when I woke up. I eventually stopped trying to keep time. One day the door creaked open. "Finally! I can get out of here," I thought.

Two figures stood in the doorway.

Their masks—porcelain-white with gold trim—had no eye holes, just smooth, empty faces. Long, hooded red cloaks swallowed their bodies, the same gold trim tracing their edges like veins.

"Am I finally being let out?" My voice came out hoarse, unused.

No response.

One of them stepped forward, the air shifting as it moved, like the temperature dropped a few degrees. I swallowed. "Are you gonna let me out of this place?"

…

Before I could react, cold metal snapped around my neck—a collar, thick and unyielding. A leash made of chains trailed from it, disappearing into the folds of the figure’s cloak. My hands shot up instinctively to rip it off—

Agony.

Tiny, razor-sharp needles shot out of the collar, impaling every finger that touched it. I gasped, yanking my hands away. Blood dripped from my fingertips onto the pristine white floor, spreading in small, violent blooms. The figure yanked the leash forward, nearly pulling me off my feet. I staggered after them, the second figure following close behind.

The hallway stretched endlessly before me, identical white walls and white doors swallowing all sense of direction. The only thing breaking the monotony were the small chutes on each door—food slots, probably. My blood left a trail behind us, the only thing proving I had passed through this place at all. We walked for what felt like ten minutes until I noticed a door that was out of the ordinary.

Its chute was open.

I stopped. The figure ahead of me stopped as well. It didn’t pull me forward. I hesitated, watching to see if my escorts would stop me. 

They didn't. 

I crouched down, peering inside. The smell of decay hit me instantly. Instinctively, I wanted to pull back but fought against it. The dimly lit room beyond held something… wrong.

A creature sat inside, one leg tucked under another. Its frame was unnaturally thin, skin clinging to it so tightly I could count every vertebrae in its spine. It hunched over something, gnawing. Bone ground against bone with a sickening crunch—like wet gravel beneath heavy boots. Half an antler jutted from its clawed grip, the other half still attached to something covered in brown fur? A deer maybe?

"What in the world…?" I breathed.

The thing stopped chewing. Its head snapped all the way around, bones creaking like old wood. Blood and antler shards dripped from its jagged teeth. Its head was that of a deer’s skull. Empty sockets, boring straight into me. Antlers branched outward in chaotic, unnatural angles, as if they’d grown in the wrong direction.

My muscles locked.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

The thing saw me. Not just my body, but deeper—like it was peeling me apart layer by layer, sinking its gaze into my soul. Its eye sockets began to glow a sickly, unnatural green. A muffled sound cut through the tension—sharp, like a silenced gunshot. The creature crumpled to the floor.

Before I could process what had happened, a force shoved me forward. I stumbled, whipping my head around to glare at my masked escort. From beneath its cloak, a withered, translucent-gray arm slithered outward. It raised one long, bony finger and pointed down the hall. I swallowed my anger, turned away, and walked.

My heart still pounded against my ribs, my mind looping over what I had just seen. So many questions raced through my mind but one thing stood out from the rest. That creature wasn't eating a deer…

It was eating a person.

After what felt like an eternity of walking, we finally stopped at a door. The figure behind me stepped forward and pushed it open.

A heavy darkness loomed inside.

The only thing I could make out was an operating table. Its cold surface faintly glinting under the weak reflection of the hallway light. The figure gripping my leash took a step forward, yanking hard, urging me to follow. I resisted, planting my feet. My mind spiraled into panic. What were they going to do to me? Harvest my organs? Is this some kind of black market operation?

Before I could react further, the other figure shoved me forward. I stumbled into the room, my breath quick and shallow. Seizing my arms—their grip like iron—they forced  me onto the table. Straps coiled around my limbs, pinning me down. I thrashed, desperate to escape, but the restraints held firm. Terror clawed at my throat. A mask pressed over my nose and mouth. A sickly-sweet chemical filled my lungs. My thoughts blurred. My limbs grew heavy. The darkness swallowed me whole.

I blacked out.

I was in and out of consciousness. Blinding surgical lights overhead. Figures in masks, their faces blurred, their eyes hidden. The metallic scent of blood. A gloved hand reaching into me. A wet, sickening squelch. A pan beside me—filled with something.

I wanted to scream.

I jolted awake, gasping. I was back. Back in the small, suffocating room from before. My hands trembled as I clawed at my shirt, yanking it up. I was mentally preparing myself for what I was about to see.

Nothing.

No stitches. No pain. No sign that anything had been done to me. Was it a nightmare? A hallucination? Then I saw it. 

On my left wrist, just below my palm, was something that hadn’t been there before.

A tattoo. 

Thin, delicate lines forming a pair of butterfly—or maybe moth—wings? Between them was a number—267.

I kept being dragged back to that room with each passing moment a cruel reminder of what was happening to me. Sometimes, I caught more brief, disorienting flashes of the surgical procedures being done to my body. 

The more times they dragged me back, the more “food” they’d leave for me. At first, I couldn’t even bring myself to look at it. I’d sit in the corner, arms wrapped around my knees, trying to hold on to the sharp edge of my hunger. But hunger changes things.

I finally looked. 

It wasn’t like any food I’d ever seen. Just a grey, pulpy mass, like chewed meat spat out and left to fester. Thin, stringy veins crisscrossed the surface, some still pulsing faintly, like whatever it was hadn’t quite given up yet. Bits of cartilage jutted out from the mush, like teeth trapped in gum.

I held out for as long as I could, telling myself I wouldn’t—couldn’t—eat it. But the smell... it worked its way into my head. It didn’t smell rotten, not exactly. It smelled warm. Familiar. 

My stomach ached so bad it felt like something gnawing me from the inside. The moment it touched my tongue, the floodgates opened. My mind screamed at me to stop, but my body didn’t listen. Bite after bite, I devoured it, barely registering the wet snap of cartilage or the sponge-like texture soaking the inside of my mouth. The worst part wasn’t eating it.

The worst part was how good it tasted.

I kept eating the “food” they’d bring me but hunger wasn’t what drove me anymore. It was something else. Something worse. 

I wanted it.

The longer I stayed in this place, the more I could feel pieces of myself slipping away. When did my fingernails grow this long? When did I lose weight? The world outside started to feel like some distant, half-forgotten dream. My name, my voice, the sound of laughter—all of it eroding, like water slowly wearing down stone.

Hope became a foreign concept. I stopped wondering if I’d ever leave.

The only certainty was the cold fluorescent lights, the sting of anesthesia, and the endless cycle of being cut apart and sewn back together. Until one day, as I was being ushered through the long, sterile hallways, I saw something—a face I knew all too well. 

Ryan.

He was being escorted in the same way I was. And he looked rough. His long hair hung in tangled clumps, and his beard was rough, unkempt—at least a couple inches longer than I remembered. For a brief second, his eyes found mine. He shot me a look, it was the kind of look that says everything without speaking a word. "Let’s get the fuck out of here."

My heart started pounding. We were in this together now. It might take time, but I was determined—our next meeting wouldn’t be our last.

It felt like weeks had passed before I saw Ryan again. 

When I finally encountered him again, I noticed the tips of his fingers were scabbed over. He bumped into me—intentional, calculated. He slipped two small, folded pieces of cloth into my hand. One felt soft, almost like worn bedsheets; the other, rough and crusted. "Put the soft piece in the door bolt when you get back," he whispered, his voice barely audible. We were shoved forward by the guards, and I was escorted back to my room. 

One of the figures unlocked the door, and as soon as it creaked open, I slid the soft fabric into the bolt. The door slammed shut behind me, but this time there was no sharp click of the door locking. I quickly pulled the other piece of cloth from my pocket. Two words scrawled in blood sent a cold shiver through me:

“8 Hours.”
