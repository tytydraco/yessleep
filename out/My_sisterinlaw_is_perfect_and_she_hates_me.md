My sister-in-law Jennifer hates me. I avoid her like the plague but she goes out of her way to pull me into every conversation just to pick on every word I say. I stopped going to family gatherings at my in-law's because I couldn't take the abuse anymore.

The worst part is my husband Brian says it's my fault. He says I have to stop taking things so personally, and that this is just the way Jennifer is. But when I point out she's not like this to anybody else, he says I'm too sensitive. He says I'm jealous of her because she's attractive.

I couldn't help being hurt and annoyed by this and my face showed it. I'm not good at hiding emotions.

Brian knew he had hurt me and then went in for the kill. With a perfectly straight face, he looked me in the eye and said he couldn't stand perfect girls like Jennifer anyway because he couldn't relax around her at all.

"There's something off about her," he said, "you know what I mean?"

And the funny thing was, I knew exactly what he meant.

\*

Brian was right, Jennifer was perfect. She was genetically blessed, intelligent, successful and I have never seen her with so much as a hair out of place.

Brian's brother Billy (Jennifer's husband) on the other hand got mixed up with the wrong crowd when he was younger and barely finished high school. But he's been sober for five years and is the nicest guy I know. I like him a lot, but Brian says he has no ambition.

Anyway, after several months of not seeing my in-laws, I got a text one day from Billy asking me how I was doing.

Truth to tell, I was really flattered he thought of me. I texted him back that I was fine and he asked me if I was going to his mother's birthday party next week. He said I should come, and I was like I'll think about it.

It felt very high school but in a good way. Because I did miss seeing Billy. He was the only one in the family who defended me from Jennifer when my own husband couldn't be bothered.

Brian seemed pissed when I told him I wanted to go to his mom's birthday party. He said I was NOT INVITED because Jennifer refused to be in the same room as me. I asked him why and he was like you know why. I was genuinely confused and said I had no idea what he was talking about. And then he said Jennifer said I called her a bitch and that I told her she would never be able to have children because she worked out too much.

I was like WHAT? I would never say anything so cruel to her or to anybody. I never even saw her in at least two months and Brian knew this.

But of course Brian didn't believe me and said he would throw me out himself if I dared to show up at the party.

\*

Brian wouldn't tell me when the party was, but Billy let me know.

I got to Brian's mom's house just in time and Jennifer was so surprised when she saw me she almost dropped her food. She gave Brian a look and he shrugged as if to say he did all he could to keep me away.

The party was a nightmare. If Jennifer was a bitch before, now she was going for my jugular. I have rosacea and am very sensitive about my skin and Jennifer knew this. All throughout dinner she kept asking me why I was so red (I can't help it), what I had been drinking (I don't drink), and held up a cherry tomato next to my face and asked everybody which was redder.

When Billy told her to cut it out, Brian told him to shut up and that I deserved it. I had never seen Billy look so angry before and for a second I thought he was going to hit Brian.

Brian smirked all throughout dinner because the meaner Jennifer was to me, the sweeter she was to him.

I was on the verge of tears and I excused myself to go to the bathroom to wash my face. When I came out into the hall, Jennifer was waiting for me.

She looked extremely upset.

"What are you doing here?" she hissed, forcing me back into the bathroom.

She grabbed me by the hair and I could feel her wet smelly breath on my face. She might have been beautiful but her mouth stank like a sewer.

"Stay away!" she spat into my ear. "Do you hear me? Stay away!"

From behind her I saw Brian and he was watching us with a smile on his face.

Jennifer let go of me and walked past him and out of the bathroom.

"I told you not to come," Brian said.

\*

Billy texted me the next day to ask me if I was okay.

It's hard to know what to say to a man whose wife had just beat me up in his own mother's bathroom. And I was embarrassed because I liked Billy, a lot, and I hated that he saw me humiliated. So I left him on read. I ignored his text. And it was the biggest mistake of my life. Because who knows what might have happened if I had only talked to him.

Instead I went to stay with my new work friend Heidi who offered me her couch. I couldn't sleep and was stalking Jennifer's social media when Heidi looked over my shoulder and said Jennifer looks a lot like a woman who went missing from her hospital a few years ago.

Heidi said it was a car accident: rainy night, wet roads, a truck and SUV, head on collision. The people in the truck walked away with barely a bruise, but the driver of the SUV died on impact. The woman who was in the car with him was pregnant and ended up having a miscarriage in the ambulance. They brought her into the hospital where Heidi was working, and she told Heidi the man who had died was her fiance and that they were on their way to get married. When Heidi went back to check on her, she was gone.

The woman had, apparently, walked out of the hospital. Nobody knew where she went. Nobody even knew her name. When they figured out who the dead guy was, it turned out he was already married. His wife lived two states over and thought he was visiting his parents.

Anyway, Heidi said, it all happened years ago, and who even knows if it's the same woman?

\*

Brian had told me about the car accident. It was him, Billy and their parents in Billy's truck and Brian was driving. They walked away with minor injuries but the driver of the other car died. It happened before we were married and it was in fact how Brian and I met. But Brian had never mentioned the woman in the other car, and I had never connected her with Jennifer.

If Heidi was wrong, then I would look crazy if I confronted Jennifer about it, and Jennifer being Jennifer would never let me live it down. She would tell everybody what a nut job I am and I would never be able to show my face in front of Billy again.

But if Heidi was right?

And here, my mind ran into a brick wall.

I texted Billy and when he didn't reply I called him. I left him a message that I wanted to talk to him and waited.

And waited.

It had only been a day and I told myself that I was freaking out over nothing. And so I waited another day and obsessively scrolled through everybody's social media. There was going to be a BBQ at Brian's mom's house, and Brian, Billy and Jennifer were going to be there.

Jennifer had commented under the BBQ post that she was going to bring the meat, and Brian said it better be good meat, and they exchanged smiley faces.

Billy still hadn't replied to me.

\*

I had to work late and ended up not making it to the BBQ until evening. When I got to Brian's mom's house, the first thing I thought was that something smells delicious. Jennifer was going back and forth with plates, and Brian and his parents were sitting around looking happy and fed.

When I came in, Jennifer was just bringing in the last dish. It was big and round and covered with a silver dome. When she saw me her face fell and she said, "What the hell are you doing here?"

There was an awkward silence.

"Get out," she said, "leave, now."

But I wasn't going to leave until I talked to Billy.

"Where's Billy?" I said.

She said nothing.

"What's that dish?" Brian's mom said. "I can't eat another bite."

"Dessert," said Jennifer, still looking at me.

She put down the dish carefully and walked towards me. She went for my arm but I dodged her grasp.

Brian's mother said, "Let her stay, we're almost done."

"Get out!" Jennifer hissed at me as we played cat and mouse in a corner of the yard.

"Tell me where Billy is," I said.

"He's gone," she said.

I was stunned. "He left you?"

That didn't sound like something Billy would do.

Brian and his parents were standing around the big covered dish. From what I could hear, Brian's mother was trying to get everybody focused on the dish rather than on her two daughter-in-laws fighting in her yard.

Jennifer kept pushing me away from where the others were standing around the dish.

"Where's Billy?" I said. "Where did he go?"

But Jennifer only kept saying "Go away! Get out!" over and over again. She pushed and I pushed back, she was strong but I was strong too, as I was finding out.

Jennifer gave me a final hard shove, saying, "Run you fool."

She hit me hard on the face and I hit her back. I saw Brian lifting the dome covering the big dish.

There was a moment of dead silence and then Brian's mother screamed and fainted as Jennifer jumped on me and pushed me to the ground, covering my body with hers as I heard a loud explosion and the ground shook beneath me.

\*

The police said a piece of shrapnel went into the back of Jennifer's head, killing her on impact.

The others survived but all had serious injuries they would never completely recover from. Brian's mother had to be put into a straitjacket in the ICU.

At Billy and Jennifer's house, every inch of the floor and walls had been smeared with blood. She had dismembered him as expertly as a butcher, and the flesh had been chopped and grounded and brought to the family BBQ where it was cooked and eaten. The head was stuffed with explosives and put into the last dish with the wiring hooked up to the dome covering it.

As for me, I was completely unharmed thanks to Jennifer protecting me with her body. She had sacrificed herself to save me, believing me to be innocent.

\*

Grief makes a person do funny things.

Like the grief that comes from finding out your husband betrayed you. That when he said he was visiting his parents, he was really going on a road trip with his mistress.

When they came out of the motel room, it was already dark and all I could see of the woman were shiny stilettos under a big umbrella as they got into the SUV.

I was desperate to know what she looked like, and so I followed them in my rental car. The night was dark and it was raining and I stayed close so I didn't lose them. I saw the back of her head leaning on his shoulder as he drove, and then I saw, or I thought I saw, him putting an arm around her. And because grief makes a person do funny things, I gave the steering wheel a hard jerk, pulling my car right into the path of a truck coming the other way.

I remember the truck's headlights and then the screech of brakes behind me as I, seemingly miraculously, drove on untouched.

Nobody saw me, nobody even suspected there was another car there that night.

Or so I thought.

When the police came to the house and told me my husband died in a car accident, I couldn't even pretend to be surprised. But they were clearly just going through the steps and didn't take much notice. It was, as far as they were concerned, an open and shut case.

They told me there was a woman in the car with him and that she had disappeared after the accident. They asked me if I knew who she might be, and I told them truthfully I did not. The motel she and my husband stayed at were registered under my husband's name.

Not long afterwards, a man showed up on my doorstep. He said his name was Brian, and that he and his brother and parents had recently been in an accident, the accident that killed my husband.

At first I thought he had come to offer his condolences, but the expression on his face told me otherwise. He then told me he knew I was there that night, and made it clear that he knew it was my car that had caused the accident. He said he had a proposition for me: he wanted to marry me.

His sneering demeanor made it plain that this proposition had nothing to do with love.

I asked him if it was for my husband's life insurance, and he said the money was a part of it but it wasn't all.

I understood what he meant. Even the few minutes I had spent in Brian's company told me prison and even death would be preferable to a marriage with him. Later, after our marriage, the little that Billy let drop about his childhood told me he had been Brian's first victim until he got too big and strong for Brian to torture.

When Brian found me, he immediately realized that his initial plan to blackmail me into submission was redundant. My life ended when my husband died and every day since then had been a living hell and my face showed it. What Brian offered me was release, or at least distraction, in the form of pain and humiliation and I took it.

\*

The bomb had deprived Brian the use of his legs. He had despised physical weakness  and disability of every kind, and now he was disabled himself. He, who had always wanted to be the villain in his own story, had turned out to be nothing more than a victim of circumstance. And as strange as this might sound, I felt nothing but pity for him.

A few months after the accident, I received a visit from a man who said he was Jennifer's lawyer. He told me she had left me a letter to be opened after her death.

Her death?

"When did she give it to you?" I asked him.

He said, "I shouldn't really tell you but I suppose it can't matter much now. She gave it to me the day before she died."

"Shouldn't you give this to the police then?" I said.

"What makes you think I didn't?" he said. "Is your husband around?"

"He's sleeping," I said. "He sleeps a lot these days. He isn't....what he used to be."

I heard sirens in the distance coming closer. Ours were a quiet neighborhood and I wondered if there had been an accident somewhere.

\*

This is what Jennifer's letter to me said:

"I'm sorry. I loved him once too, so I know how you feel.

When I found out he was married and had been lying to me all along, I promised myself he would pay. When the accident with the truck happened I saw my chance and killed him with a rock. It was easy. The police didn't suspect me, but Billy knew. He saw me do it.

Billy found me and told me what he saw. He wanted to save me, not turn me in to police. I told him I didn't want to be saved, I wanted to burn in hell. I tell him I will kill him so fast if he go to the police, but he refused to be scared. I tell him all day long what I am but he only tell me I am really good inside. He would only see the best in people, even me.

And then Brian somehow figured out what Billy saw, and threatened to go to the police if I didn't do whatever he tells me. Billy married me so he couldn't be made to testify against me, but Brian still kept hinting he could get me sent to prison without Billy's help. I told Billy his brother is talking shit, but who knows maybe he did have something.

But I played along with Brian because he was amusing. He believed every stupid thing I tell him like a baby. He thinks I am his to do what he want. He is very wrong. I will fry him like a stick of butter.

I didn't kill Billy. When Brian come over to the house and tried to sleep with me, Billy pulled him off and Brian pushed him down the stairs. I told Brian I would take care of the body, but I didn't tell him how. I guess he will be surprised.

The baby monitor Billy had set up for our cats also recorded Brian pushing him down the stairs, and I'm having that sent to the police. So if Brian survives the bomb, I hope he has the taste for prison food.

About the birthday party of Brian's mother, I made a good plan. They were all going to be so blown away, Brian first. But you showed up and my work was wasted. I'm sorry I made you cry. You weren't supposed to be at the BBQ either, I tried my best to keep you away. None of this is your fault. Please don't feel sorry for me, I am so sick of this world. I regret nothing. Forgive me for everything. Jennifer."
