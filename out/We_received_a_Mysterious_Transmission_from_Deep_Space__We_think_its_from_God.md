Space to me, is simply put beautiful. No, I don’t mean the endless void that stretches far beyond the horizon into unfathomable depths. Rather, I find the existence of stars, planets, and cosmic phenomena—serene and pristine….that pave the way of finding millions of data in undiscovered science. 

When you’re floating aimlessly through the cosmos, the silence can weigh heavily upon you. For many, the solitude and boredom of space are haunting, and I would agree. In the vastness of the universe, you are but a whisper, insignificant against the backdrop of infinite obscurity. Being grounded on Earth could never compare to the exhilarating isolation of space.

My mission is anything but simple, and what it was no longer matters. To be honest, I’d rather spare you the details—for your own safety. Just know this: I wasn’t a man of faith, not before. But now... I’m not so sure anymore.

3 weeks ago, HQ intercepted a transmission from an unknown signal. While we’ve encountered similar communications before—often misidentified as echoes from nearby satellites—this one was……*quite different*. 

I emerged from my standard cryo-pod to the incessant beeping echoing through the command deck. A transmission from HQ… I tapped the console, bringing the message into clearer focus. The voice crackled through the comms, tense but steady.

'Captain Cross... We’ve received a transmission from Rosette Nebula... but something’s off. The signal is weak, distorted—barely holding. It's not on any known frequency. We can’t trace the source.'

I stared at the flickering display, confused and dazed….Rosette Nebula? That can’t be possible…

"‘Are we certain it's originating from the vessel and not a stray satellite?’ I asked, initializing the caffeine synth dispenser.

‘Confirmed, Captain,’ the comms officer responded, his voice steady. ‘The signal’s unique—it's being transmitted by a device specifically calibrated for Rosette Nebula. No other tech in the sector uses this frequency.’"

'Patch it through,' I ordered, my voice calm, though the air felt heavier around me.

There was a long pause, a static hiss, then the screen illuminated, revealing some sort of symbols

Δ ∅ | # | ⅃ Δ ⊤ | ∘ ∅

“Have we deciphered them yet?”

“Only the first 3 symbols….ANN….We’re currently working to decode the remaining characters…”

“‘HQ, I’ll remain on standby for the rest of the message. In the meantime, I’ll proceed with my scheduled tasks for the day…’ 

A brief silence followed, then came the crisp response: ‘Affirmative, Captain.’”

The Rosette Nebula, commanded by a brilliant man known as Benjamin Armitage. He had made numerous groundbreaking scientific discoveries that had reshaped our understanding of the cosmos. His research on exoplanetary atmospheres and the potential for habitability garnered widespread acclaim, and I had diligently followed his work, drawn to his innovative theories and relentless pursuit of knowledge. Months ago, Benjamin had taken the Rosette Nebula to find a planet that could sustain human life for centuries. Since then, it had simply vanished…. 

Benjamin Armitage had commanded a crew of about fifteen souls, each with families, each representing generations of bloodlines. They had simply vanished, forever lost among the stars, their existence and their findings swallowed by the obscure cosmic void. HQ was quick to label them as “Annihilation”, which was a term reserved for vessels that slipped beyond the boundaries of known space. However, this signal—it seemed to be emanating from it…

I immersed myself in my daily tasks, gathering atmospheric readings, carbon pressure levels, and scanning for any new star formations in the vicinity. *That’s when I heard it*—a slow, deliberate tapping through the metal hull. It was faint at first, almost like a whisper and I mostly ignored it. Until it cut through the tranquility of the ship. I paused….straining my ears against the silence that followed, only to be met with an unsettling stillness that felt almost oppressive. Then it came again, a gentle tapping, like fingers drumming on the surface of the universe itself. My pulse quickened as I stepped cautiously towards the command room. 

*Until the alarms rang…*.

"Status report!" I barked, my voice barely rising above the cacophony of sirens.

The ship's AI flickered to life, its voice steady but laced with urgency. "Warning: Unidentified object detected in proximity. Trajectory indicates potential collision course. Estimated time to impact: three minutes."

My heart raced as I glanced at the sensor readouts, a cluster of data scrolling rapidly across the screen. An unidentified object? My mind raced through possibilities, each more chilling than the last. What have I stumbled upon? I gripped the console, my knuckles white, as I focused on the blaring alerts.

“Divert all power to shields! Prepare for evasive maneuvers!” I commanded, the weight of command settling heavily on my shoulders.

Then, as abruptly as it had started, the alarms fell silent. The oppressive stillness enveloped me, leaving only the sound of my own heartbeat echoing in my ears. I was alone with my thoughts, the tension thick enough to slice.

Suddenly, HQ crackled to life over the comms, the voice of my superior cutting through the silence. “Captain Cross… it seems that a vessel is within your vicinity…”

I couldn't help but smirk, a bitter taste in my mouth. “I don’t suppose I’ll be assigned to find out what it is?”

“It is heavily damaged, and we need you to investigate,” the voice replied, lacking any trace of hesitation.

A heavy sigh escaped me. Of course, they would send me. After all, *I was an experiment gone wrong…*

As I prepared my spacesuit, the familiar routine grounded me amidst the chaos of uncertainty. The fabric of the suit felt reassuring against my skin. I meticulously checked the seals, ensuring they were airtight, and secured my helmet, the visor reflecting the dim lights of the command deck. Once I was ready, I took a deep breath and stepped into the airlock, my heart pounding in rhythm with the mechanical whir of the closing hatch. With a hiss, the chamber depressurized, and the door to the outer void slid open, revealing the damaged hull of the lost vessel. HQ had sent me to find it, and now I stood at the threshold of *obscurity*.

The journey across the void was eerie, my boots pushing off against the jagged remnants of the ship. As I glided toward the entrance, I felt the cold embrace of the void wrapping around me. Once inside, the carbon pressures surged, and to my astonishment, they stabilized. A miracle—the oxygen systems were still operational.

Inside of the vessel was dark…I flicked on the helmet’s night vision, illuminating the darkened interior with a spectral green glow. The sheer size of the ship was overwhelming; massive corridors stretched into the shadows, but a sinister stillness pervaded the air. Not a soul in sight. *The silence was deafening.*

I cautiously ventured deeper into the belly of the beast, my footsteps muffled by the thick silence. The walls, scarred and dented from external damage, seemed to whisper secrets of the lives that once thrived here. As I explored, remnants of humanity emerged from the darkness—personal effects scattered about, a half-finished meal.

*Then, I found the captain’s quarters.* 

The door hissed open, revealing a space cluttered with the echoes of its occupant. A cabinet caught my eye, its surface adorned with scratches and wear. I approached, my fingers trembling as I opened it, revealing a journal.

The initials "BA" were etched into the cover, along with the name of the vessel: *Rosette Nebula*.

“What?” I murmured, disbelief washing over me. Had I truly found the lost ship? It had come into my grasp, slipping through the fingers of fate.

But then, the helmet's night vision flickered and cut out, plunging me into an impenetrable darkness. I stood still, the absence of light amplifying my senses. Deep into the blackness, I peered, but all I found was a suffocating void filled with my own thoughts. The sound of my heartbeat echoed like a distant drum, reverberating through the forewalls of my mind. Here, in this forsaken vessel, the weight of isolation pressed down on me, mingling with the chilling realization that *I may not be alone*.

As I stood in the shadows of the captain’s quarters, the eerie stillness was shattered by the familiar crackle of the comms. HQ came online, their static-filled voices cutting through the suffocating silence.

“Captain Cross, report your findings,” the voice of Commander Hayes came through, clipped and professional.

“I’ve located the lost vessel,” I replied, forcing the words past the knot in my throat. “The Rosette Nebula is here, but… there’s not a soul present. It’s as if the crew vanished into thin air.” I felt a chill run down my spine as I refrained from mentioning the journal.

“Understood,” Hayes replied. “We’re analyzing the signal from the vessel. We’ve decoded the initials from the transmission… I-H-I.”

“I-H-I?” I echoed, brow furrowing. “Nothing further?”

“Negative. That’s all we have for now. We’ll keep you updated if anything changes,” Hayes said, and the transmission went quiet, leaving only the faint hum of the ship’s systems in my ears.

Then, as if the air itself thickened, a voice emerged from the darkness, thin and raspy. “You shouldn’t be here.”

I whirled around, my heart racing. A figure loomed in the corner, skeletal and ghostly, as if he had been plucked from the very fabric of time. The man looked as if he had died years ago, his skin stretched tight over bone, eyes sunken and hollow but his face, oh god his face was hollow…crisp and dark. “I found a star,” he rasped, “a habitable one. I wanted to bring it to Earth… but I found something else, I’ve found…*Annihilation*”

His gaze bore into me, a mix of madness and reverence. “A deity…” His voice trailed off, lost in the echo of his own despair. “ I wanted Immortality.....and he has given me.....”

My breath caught in my throat as the old man stepped closer, his frail hands reaching out. “*My ancestors foretold the prophecy*”

In a panic, I stumbled backward, but he lunged at me, hands tightening around my throat. A struggle erupted between us—his strength belied his frail appearance. I fought against his grip, adrenaline surging through my veins.

With a burst of energy, I broke free and bolted toward the exit, sprinting through the dark corridors of the Rosette Nebula. My mind raced as I navigated the wreckage, heart pounding in my chest. I could feel his presence hot on my heels, a specter of madness from the depths of the void.

Reaching my ship, I slammed the hatch behind me, heart pounding as I engaged the airlock mechanisms.

"Lock it down, lock it down!”

I urged myself, fingers flying over the controls as I sealed myself inside my vessel. The hiss of the airlock filled the cabin, a sound of safety—at least for now.

Just as I secured the hatch, HQ crackled back online. “Captain Cross, we’ve been monitoring your live feed. We need to discuss your situation.”

I took a deep breath, the air feeling heavy with dread. “I need to get out of here now,” I said, urgency lacing my voice. “There’s something aboard this ship—someone who should not be here.”

“Hold your position,” Hayes commanded. “We need to analyze the full situation. The transmission data suggests the I-H-I sequence is connected to protocols. It could be crucial.”

“I don’t care about protocols! I’m telling you, there’s a man here… he claims to have found Immortality!” I shouted, desperation clawing at my chest.

“Maintain control, Captain,” Hayes replied, but I could hear the tension in his voice. “We’ll assess your situation from here.”

As I sat in my ship, the weight of the encounter settled over me like a suffocating shroud. I locked my gaze on the dark viewport, heart racing, fully aware that I was no longer just a captain exploring the cosmos. I was now a witness to something far more terrifying—something that had stirred from the depths of the *Rosette Nebula*, and it hungered for attention.

Desperate for answers; I read through the journal entries. BA, Benjamin Armitage; inside, the ink was smudged, some pages worn and torn, but the words were still legible. They told a story.

His initial entries started hopeful. The same optimism I had, the same ambition, the same thirst for discovery. But as I flipped through the pages, the tone shifted. The words became darker, more erratic. Benjamin Armitage and his crew had discovered something. Something far out, deep in space, something ancient, buried beneath the surface of a rogue planet. At first, they thought it was a piece of alien technology. But it wasn’t. It was something alive.

The entries began to fragment. He spoke of voices in his head, of strange symbols appearing on the walls of the ship, symbols that hadn’t been there before. His crew began to change—mentally, then physically. He tried to explain it to Earth, to tell them what they had found, but they dismissed him. They called him delusional. A man driven mad by isolation.

But it was the last few entries that chilled me to my core. They weren’t written in ink anymore. They were scratched within the confines of the pages.

"*We are not meant for this. We are not meant to inherit the stars. We are not meant to understand them"*

*He watches. He waits. Do not follow.*

The more I read, the more I felt the same pull that the captain must have felt. That awful, magnetic tug that kept me turning the pages even though every fiber of my being screamed to stop. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to know the truth anymore. But I kept reading. I had to.

The final entry contained symbols. The same ones HQ had initially found; 

Δ ∅ | # | ⅃ Δ ⊤ | ∘ ∅

*“Annihilation”*

*The man I had found aboard the vessel. It was Benjamin Armitage….*

The silence in the vessel was deafening, broken only by the soft hum of the ship’s systems. Just as I began to steady my breath, the coms crackled to life. An ancient voice filtered through, its words jumbled and incoherent.

*“Annihilation.”*

The AI interface flickered to life, struggling to decipher the distorted sounds. As the words emerged clearer, a chill ran down my spine. 

“**Δ ∅ | # | ⅃ Δ ⊤ | ∘ ∅**,” 

it repeated, and then the single word followed, almost like a chant. 

*“Annihilation.”*

“What are you?” I called out into the void, my voice trembling against the oppressive darkness.

“Annihilation,” the voice returned, eerily echoing my own question. It felt as if the sound had seeped into my mind, wrapping around my thoughts like a vice. Panic surged through me. I stumbled backward, my legs giving way as I collapsed onto the cold metal floor.

In an instant, the world faded away, and I was swept into a universe of some sort—a singular celestial body: a radiant star encircled by a luminous moon, this world…..*it had bloody lakes.* 

“Captain Ethan Cross,” the voice resonated, deep and resonant like the rumbling of distant thunder. It filled the emptiness of space, reverberating within my very essence. 

“You have wandered far, yet you seek what should remain hidden.”

“Wha…What the fuck are you?” I stammered, the enormity of the being overwhelming me. It defied comprehension, its form shifting in a way that defied all logic, something that shouldn’t exist.

“I am he who dwells in the shadows between stars,” the entity replied. “I am the truth that dwells beyond the veil of your understanding. You see, Benjamin Armitage sought the stars, and in his arrogance, he attempted to claim them as his own. His sin was to reach for what was never meant for mortal hands. He lives, but his existence is now one of eternal servitude, chained by his ambition.”

“So... he’s not dead?” I gasped, the pieces beginning to fit together like fragments of a shattered mirror.

“No,” the voice echoed, its tone both melancholic and accusatory. “He is condemned, a shadow of what he once was, roaming the halls of his dreams, forever haunted by his failure. You tread the same path, Captain. Your mission is akin to his. You will meet the same fate if you continue.”

“But I have to find it!” I protested, desperation bubbling within me. “I need to know! Humanity needs to know!”

“Knowledge is a double-edged sword,” the voice cautioned, its voice shifting to a softer timbre. “Your desire blinds you, for the truth is a burden too heavy to bear. The stars you seek may yield answers, but they may also consume you. Do not follow in his footsteps. Turn back while you still can.”

As the cosmic deity’s words washed over me, a whisper broke through the ethereal conversation, indistinct yet insistent.

*“No... no... no...”*

“What is that?” I asked. The whisper grew louder, more frantic, reverberating in my mind. “Turn back... find rest...”

Suddenly, the celestial landscape began to dissolve, and darkness enveloped me.

I jolted awake, gasping for breath, finding myself confined within the cryptic pod of my ship. It had all been a dream? 

*“Being alone in the void for so long…has taken its effect on me. But nevertheless, space is beautiful to me…I am sending this final log before my next mission which is to find the remnants of a planet that contains elements of habitual substances. Wish me luck…..”*

As I recorded my final log….an incessant beeping echoed through the command deck. A transmission from HQ… I tapped the console, bringing the message into clearer focus. The voice crackled through the comms, tense but steady.

'Captain Cross... We’ve received a transmission from the lost Rosette Nebula….

*“Annihilation”*
