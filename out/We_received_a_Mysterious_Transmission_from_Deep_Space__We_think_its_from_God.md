I work for NASA. What my position is and what I do does not matter. I can be sent to jail for posting this here but I don't even care anymore. People have to know about this....The following log was received from the Nebula Explorer V2 on November 7th, 2022. It is the last log of the vessel and since communications from it have been lost.

*The following is the log from Captain Ethan Cross from the Nebula Explorer V2*....

*September 15th, 2022*

Deep space has always seemed beautiful to me. The endless void that stretches beyond the horizon into unfathomable depths, the existence of stars, planets, and cosmic phenomena offer a gateway to the unknown. It’s a place where the boundaries of science blur, paving the way for discoveries in regions untouched by human knowledge. 

When you’re floating aimlessly through the cosmos, the silence can often weigh heavily upon you and the solitude and boredom of space can be…. *haunting*, and I would agree. In the vastness of the Interstellar void, you are but a whisper, merely insignificant against the backdrop of infinite obscurity. Earth could never match the exhilarating isolation of space.                       

My mission was anything but simple, and what it was no longer matters. To be honest, I’d rather spare you the details—for your own safety. Just know this: I wasn’t a man of faith, not before. But now... I’m not so sure anymore. 

Three weeks ago, HQ had intercepted a transmission from an unknown signal. We’ve encountered similar transmissions before which are often misidentified as echoes from nearby satellites—this one was……quite different. 

When I emerged from my standard cryo-pod, there was an incessant beeping echoing through the command deck. A message from HQ… I tapped the console, bringing the message into clearer focus. The voice crackled through the comms, tense but steady.

"Captain Cross... We’ve received a transmission from the Rosette Nebula... but something’s off. The signal is weak, distorted—barely holding. It's not on any known frequency. We can’t trace the source."

I blinked at the flickering display, trying to wrap my head around it. The Rosette Nebula? That’s over 5,000 light-years away… *How is it reaching us now?*

"Are we certain that the signal is not from a stray satellite?" I asked, initializing the caffeine synth dispenser. It hummed to life, producing the liquid in seconds.

"Confirmed, Captain," the comms officer responded, his voice steady. "The signal’s unique—it’s being transmitted by a device specifically calibrated to penetrate the dense dust clouds of the Rosette Nebula. No other tech in this sector uses this frequency."

I stared at the monitor, unsettled. The nebula's gas clouds might be interfering... but a signal from that distance? It shouldn't even be possible.

“Patch it through,” I ordered, my voice calm, though the air felt heavier around me. There was a long pause, a static hiss, then the screen illuminated, revealing some sort of notations

Δ ∅ | # | ⅃ Δ ⊤ | ∘ ∅

“Have we deciphered them yet?”

“Only the first 3 notations”

…. A-N-N….

“We’re currently working to decode the remaining characters…”

“I'll maintain standby for any incoming transmission. Have we received any data bursts or signals from the Nebula Explorer V1?”

“Negative, Captain. We’ve isolated Connors in quarantine protocols. It appears he's gone into self-confinement for now, but we're working on extracting him.”

“It’s been four weeks since our last deployment and four days without contact. Are we certain he’s stable?”

“Affirmative, Captain. His biometrics are active and nominal.”

“Something’s off. I’ve got a bad feeling about this… Maybe I should initiate a manual inspection.”

“Negative, Captain. Protocol is clear—your directive is to remain on standby. We can’t authorize an EVA transfer to the other vessel. Resume your current assignments and await further instructions.”

“Understood, I’ll proceed with my scheduled tasks for the day” 

A brief silence followed, then came the crisp response: ‘Affirmative, Captain.’”

I’ve been running diagnostics on the ship’s propulsion systems for the past few days, ensuring all modules are functioning within optimal parameters. My next task was to recalibrate the oxygen filtration system, but honestly, that’s routine at this point. HQ had also assigned me to monitor deep space comms, the Nebula Explorer V1 was the vessel sent before me. Between that and the scheduled exterior hull inspection later this week, I’ve had my hands full. 

Still, none of these tasks were enough to distract me from the uneasy silence coming from Connors. Four days without contact—it’s gnawing at me….

“Connors, have you ever thought about what’s out there?” I asked him one evening, the low hum of the ship’s systems providing a backdrop to our conversation. We were in the common area, sipping recycled coffee as we stared out at the stars.

He leaned back in his chair, a distant look in his eyes. “You mean besides the endless void? Yeah, I’ve thought about it. But what’s really out there? It’s just… vast emptiness. It can get overwhelming.”

“I guess it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it’s beautiful. On the other, it’s suffocating. It’s hard to shake the feeling of isolation.”

Connors sighed, scratching his chin. “You know, when I signed up for this mission, I thought I’d be doing something monumental. Discovering new worlds, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. But sometimes, I wonder if it’s worth it. The solitude can feel like a weight pressing down on you.”

I chuckled softly, trying to lighten the mood. “You signed up for the trip, Connors. You knew what you were getting into”

“Right,” he replied, but I noticed a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. “Just promise me you won’t get lost out there, okay? I’d hate to have to send a search party after you.”

“Likewise, my friend,” I said, raising my coffee cup in a mock toast. “Let’s make a pact. If either of us goes quiet for too long, the other comes looking.”

*“Deal.”*

I immersed myself in my daily tasks, gathering atmospheric readings, carbon pressure levels, and scanning for any new star formations in the vicinity. *That’s when I heard it….*

A slow, deliberate tapping through the metal hull. It was faint at first, almost like a whisper and I mostly ignored it. Until it cut through the tranquility of the ship. I paused….straining my ears against the silence that followed, only to be met with an unsettling stillness that felt almost oppressive. Then it came again, a gentle tapping, like fingers drumming on the surface of the universe itself. My pulse quickened as I stepped cautiously towards the command room. 

*Until the alarms deafened me….*

"Status report!" I barked, my voice barely rising above the cacophony of sirens.

The ship's AI flickered to life, its voice steady but laced with urgency. "Warning: Unidentified object detected in proximity. Trajectory indicates potential collision course. Estimated time to impact: three minutes."

My heart raced as I glanced at the sensor readouts, a cluster of data scrolling rapidly across the screen. An unidentified object? My mind raced through possibilities, each more chilling than the last. What have I stumbled upon? an asteroid? No, the Ships AI must have identified it…

I gripped the console as I focused on the blaring alerts. “Divert all power to shields! Prepare for evasive maneuvers!” I commanded.

I couldn’t see outside; for some reason, it was dark and blurry. The vessel slammed into something. I hadn’t engaged my safety harness, and I was violently ejected from my command seat, my body tumbling against the bulkhead.

The AI hummed, its voice urgent, piercing through the chaos.

*WARNING... WARNING... WARNING...*

I couldn’t see outside. I didn’t know what I had hit—some unseen object in the void—until it became silent. The alarm ceased, leaving an eerie quiet in its wake. My heart raced as I pushed myself upright, the cold metal of the console digging into my back.

“Status report!” I shouted, forcing my voice to remain steady despite the dread that clawed at my insides.

“Systems compromised,” the AI replied, its tone dispassionate as ever. “Shields at fifty percent. Hull integrity fluctuating. Unknown entity detected—location: 030 mark 18.”

I blinked, struggling to comprehend. Unknown entity? “What do you mean, ‘unknown entity’? Can we identify it?”

“Insufficient data. Visual feeds are compromised. Recommend initiating external scan.”

I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling the tension knotting deeper. “Do it. Get me eyes on whatever we collided with.”

As the AI began its scanning process, I took a moment to gather my thoughts. The darkness outside my viewport felt oppressive, swallowing the starlight, as if the universe itself was watching me. I fought against the rising tide of panic.

“*Come on, come on…”* I muttered under my breath, staring at the flickering display as it struggled to process the input.

Suddenly, the screen cleared, revealing a shadowy silhouette drifting just beyond the hull. A massive structure, alien and unsettling, loomed ominously against the void. Its surface was textured, like a complex web of dark materials, pulsating with an eerie glow.

“What the hell is that?” I breathed, fear coursing through my veins. “AI, enhance the scan! Identify that structure!”

“Enhancing now,” it responded. The screen pulsed as the AI processed data, but the results were slow. A dread began to settle in my gut—a feeling that whatever lay before me was more than just an object in space.

“Captain,” the AI finally said, “I cannot identify the structure. Preliminary scans indicate it emits an unusual energy signature. Suggest caution in approaching.”

Caution? I was already too close. My heart raced as I tried to think clearly, weighing my options. Should I attempt to maneuver away? Or would it be better to try and communicate?

I hesitated, uncertainty gnawing at me. Just then, a series of faint vibrations reverberated through the ship. It felt like a heartbeat, rhythmic and steady, sending shivers down my spine.

“AI, did you detect that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Affirmative. The structure appears to be reacting to our presence. Energy levels are rising.”

With a sinking feeling, I realized the entity had noticed me. Whatever it was, it was alive—*and it was watching*\*\*.\*\*

“Prepare for any incoming transmissions,” I ordered, adrenaline pumping through me. “We need to know what we’re dealing with.”

But as I waited, the silence returned, heavier this time, as if the very fabric of space held its breath. I felt utterly exposed, trapped in a cocoon of darkness, with only the unknown entity before me.

“AI, keep the shields at maximum,” I commanded, feeling a knot of fear tighten in my stomach. “If it decides to attack, I want to be ready.”

Then, as abruptly as it had started, everything fell silent. The oppressive stillness enveloped me, leaving only the sound of my own heartbeat echoing in my ears. I was alone with my thoughts, the tension thick enough to slice.

The darkness outside the viewport pressed against the hull like a weight, a reminder of the vast, uncaring universe surrounding me. I could almost feel the cold expanse of space wrapping around my ship, isolating me further from any sense of normalcy. My mind raced, piecing together the fragments of what had just occurred. What had I hit?

I forced myself to take a deep breath, steadying my pulse. I had to assess the situation. I fumbled for the control panel, my fingers brushing against the cold metal as I reestablished my grip. The interface flickered to life, the dim glow illuminating the command deck like a distant star in the void.

“AI, status check!” I commanded, my voice steadier than I felt.

“Systems are nominal,” the AI replied, its synthesized voice echoing through the stillness. “However, navigational sensors are offline, and visual feeds remain compromised. Energy levels are fluctuating within normal parameters.”

Normal? The word felt almost absurd in this context. “What about external scans? Can you provide any data on what we collided with?”

“Analyzing… no significant anomalies detected in the immediate vicinity. The object is classified as an unknown entity. Energy readings indicate a strong electromagnetic field surrounding it.”

I squinted at the monitor, frustration gnawing at me. “Give me a visual feed if you can.”

The screen pulsed, and for a brief moment, static danced across the display before settling on an image—a vast, shadowy mass drifted silently beyond my hull, its contours indistinct in the darkness, yet undeniably present.

“Can you enhance that?” I asked, my breath catching in my throat.

“Enhancing image… completed,” the AI responded. The silhouette sharpened, revealing a complex structure, interwoven with what appeared to be organic-like tendrils that pulsated faintly, as if alive.

My heart raced; *“What the fuck is that?*”

“Unknown,” the AI repeated. “Further scans are required to ascertain its properties and intentions. Recommend maintaining a safe distance while attempting to establish communication protocols.”

I felt a chill run down my spine. Communication? I didn’t want to communicate with whatever the hell this thing was

“Can we initiate contact?”

“Attempting to establish contact,” the AI replied, the console lighting up with a series of beeps and whirs.

I gripped the edge of the control panel, anticipation thrumming in my veins. A moment passed, the silence wrapping around me like a shroud. Then came the response—a low-frequency hum, resonating through the ship, sending vibrations rattling through the hull.

Δ ∅ | # | ⅃ Δ ⊤ | ∘ ∅

“What is that?” I whispered, staring at the screen as it displayed a notation.

“Unidentified transmission detected,” the AI stated. “Frequency modulation is inconsistent with known communication methods.”

It sounded almost… organic, like the pulse of a heartbeat echoing in the stillness.

“Can you decode it?” I pressed, every instinct telling me to be cautious.

“Only three Initials; A-N-N....Insufficient data to decipher further intent or meaning. Recommend further analysis and monitoring.”

I swallowed hard, my mind racing. Here I was, a speck in the void, facing a phenomenon that defied everything I knew about the universe. I was on the edge of discovery—or *destruction*.

“Prepare to initiate a deep-space scan of that entity,” I ordered, forcing myself to maintain focus despite the rising tide of uncertainty. “And keep the shields at full power. I don’t want to find out what it can do.”

A small static came when the AI replied, “Affirmative, Captain.”

As I settled into my seat, the weight of isolation pressed down on me again. I was alone, drifting through the depths of space, waiting to uncover the secrets of an entity that seemed all too aware of my presence. Suddenly, HQ crackled to life over the comms, the voice of my superior cutting through the silence. “Captain Cross… Report your findings…”

I straightened in my seat, adrenaline coursing through me. “Commander Hayes, I—” My voice faltered for a moment as I glanced at the ominous mass on the screen. “I’ve encountered an unknown entity in the vicinity. The collision has compromised navigational sensors, but I’m attempting to assess its properties.”

“Unknown entity?” Hayes’s tone was sharp, laced with urgency. “Are you in danger?”

“I’m not sure,” I replied, trying to maintain my composure. “The entity appears to be… alive, or at least it has organic characteristics. It’s emitting a low-frequency signal that I’m currently analyzing. I recommend sending a probe to gather more data before we make any decisions.”

“Negative, Captain. We cannot risk losing another asset. Maintain distance and gather intel from your current position. Can you confirm the object’s stability?”

“Stability is unclear. It’s pulsating and—” My words caught in my throat as the entity shifted slightly on the screen. *It……What the fuck…. It seems to be reacting to my presence.”*

“Is it attempting communication?”

“I don’t know yet,” I admitted, my eyes narrowing at the screen. The pulsing intensified, the low hum deepening in tone, resonating in a way that felt almost—intentional. “It’s almost like it’s… trying to talk.”

“Captain, you’re to prioritize your safety above all else. Do not engage unless absolutely necessary,” Hayes warned, his voice steely. 

I clenched my fists, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. “Commander, if this entity poses a threat, we might not have the luxury of waiting. If we don’t act now, we could lose the opportunity to understand it.”

“Your priority is to ensure the safety of the mission,” he repeated firmly. “Maintain monitoring and keep me updated. HQ out.”

The comms went silent again, leaving me in the oppressive quiet of the command deck. I glanced at the console, the waveform still pulsing in front of me. The low-frequency hum began to shift again, its rhythm changing, more urgent now.

“AI, can you analyze that change in the signal?” I asked, my heart racing.

“Analyzing… The signal exhibits patterns reminiscent of communication methods unrecognizable,” the AI reported. “Possible attempts to convey a message. However, the modulation remains unique and indecipherable.”

“Can you approximate its intent?”

“Insufficient data. However, it may imply curiosity or caution.”

Curiosity or caution? In the cold embrace of space, either could spell destruction.

“Activate the external camera feed,” I ordered. The display flickered, and the viewport illuminated, revealing the entity in full view. It's dark mass loomed large against the backdrop of stars, its tendrils undulating slowly, almost as if they were breathing.

“AI, initiate a slow rotation of the ship. I want to get a full visual of this thing without moving too close,” I instructed, hoping to buy time while my mind raced through the possibilities.

“Affirmative,” the AI responded, and the vessel began to turn.

As I watched the entity shift and ripple in the starlight, an unshakable feeling of dread settled over me. I had ventured into the unknown, and now *I was staring into the abyss, waiting for it to gaze back.*

After what felt like an eternity, a rhythmic sound echoed through the metallic hull of the vessel.

*Tudd… Tudd… Tudd…*

I tried to ignore it, but the noise was relentless, like a heartbeat in the silence of space. There was something far more terrifying awaiting me beyond that sound—something that could lead the mission into…..*Annihilation*.

 

*Tudd… Tudd… Tudd…*

The sound grew louder, filling the empty corridors of the vessel

*Tudd… Tudd… Tudd…*

I tightened my grip on the control panel, feeling a chill creep up my spine despite the warmth of my suit.

I scanned the monitors, hoping to find something—anything—that might explain the noise. Yet, the screens showed nothing but the static hum of deep space. The vast darkness loomed beyond the hull, pressing against the ship as if something massive and unseen watched from the void.

*Tudd… Tudd… Tudd…*

I tried to focus on the entity…. *But this noise…* this endless, insistent drumming… was like a warning, echoing from some primal depth I couldn’t understand.

Suddenly, the lights flickered, casting strange shadows across the bridge. I forced myself to breathe, slow and steady, but my heart raced in time with that infernal beat. 

*Tudd… Tudd… Tudd…*

A faint voice crackled through the comm system. “*Ethan*…”

I froze. That voice—it sounded distorted, stretched by static, but familiar. *Impossible*. 

*Conners? My voice ached…..*

“*Ethan….”*

The lights dimmed entirely, and the darkness became suffocating. The sound now pounded in my ears.

I turned, but I was alone. Or so I thought. In the shadows at the edge of the bridge, a figure began to form, outlined by the faint emergency lights. The face came last—his face. *Conners*. He stared at me, hollow-eyed, as if peering from some eternal abyss.

*"Did you think it would end with me?”* he whispered, his voice barely more than a rasp against the drumming beat. 

*Tudd… Tudd… Tudd…*

Panic clawed at my mind as I took a step back, my boots heavy, rooted to the floor. I tried to speak, to explain, but words failed.

And then, as I watched, he stepped forward, his gaze burning with a fury that transcended death, his figure shifting and flickering like static on a broken screen.

“*Ethan*…..” he murmured, each syllable dripping with bitterness. "*You will face it too as I have faced*…..*Complete and utter….Annihilation*"
