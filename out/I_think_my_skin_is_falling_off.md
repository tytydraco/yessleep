I woke up yesterday feeling odd, odd and itchy. My skin was so itchy I laid in bed for 30 min violently scratching until I bled. I rushed to the bathroom to look at my skin and I was almost bluish all over. I hopped in the shower and it provided some relief. I thought maybe I had a rash or something but I was itchy everywhere…. Maybe I had spread it while scratching I don't know but I hopped out of the shower and got dressed and went to the store to get some ointment. I got multiple different kinds of lotions and practically lathered myself in it. I started looking up my conditions and I figured it was dry skin or eczema or something. It also mentioned bug bites which sort of makes sense because I have been spending a lot of time outside lately. Then I remembered the bug bite on my ankle. 

My girlfriend, who was away visiting family, and I have been picking random cemeteries around town and driving to them. The cemeteries are kind of just a direction for us to drive and we try to find fun places along the way, thrift stores, dive bars, trails and any other things that catch our eye. We made it to a new cemetery the other day in rural Kansas. This cemetery looked abandoned, ok maybe not the best way to describe it but it was not well kept at all. The grass was overgrown, about as high as my waist in some places and all the tombstones were dirty and wethered. We walked around looking at each grave and they were all from the early to mid 1900’s. We found one grave that was well kept which I thought was sweet. While walking around I got a painful bite on my ankle that made my knees buckle for a second. I figured it was a big ass mosquito but before I got a chance to look at it an old man with long greasy hair came running from the other side of the graveyard yelling “Get off the grass you idiots!!!”. He spooked us and we both just ran laughing. 

I had completely forgotten about the bite until now…I lifted my ankle to look at it and I saw two very bug bites with a bit of puss oozing out of them. Which I thought was weird because I only remember feeling the one bite but since that bite hurt so bad I am starting to think this is the root of my itching. What kind of bug could do this? I looked it up and it said it could be an allergic reaction. It says it can be life threatening but you know how it is when you look up your symptoms. “Hey Google, I have a headache.” “Oh that is unfortunate, you do indeed have a brain tumor.” So I kind of shook it off and hopefully it was mild besides the only condition I had was the itching. I did not have red or swollen skin or a rash or anything so I was hoping for the best. 

I stayed at home all day moving as little as possible. It was almost bearable if I stayed completely still. I continued to scratch though, mostly gently but sometimes violently making myself bleed a couple times. Even my face was itchy, especially near my mouth. I zoned out and scratched the same spot at the corner of my mouth for I think an hour before I felt a sharp pain. I went to the mirror and the corner of my mouth was bleeding profusely, blood pouring out of my mouth. I tried to stop the bleeding but the blood just soaked through the towel. I got in the shower again and the water burned my mouth but I just let the blood drip into the tub. I stared at the shower floor for far too long as the steady stream of blood faded into the drain. I got out and went back to the mirror and was horrified. The corner of my mouth was ripped open into my cheek. I scratched so hard that I gashed my mouth open.

 I was disturbed, I was hurting, I was itchy and was truly losing my mind at this point. I was in so much pain I knew I needed to go to the hospital but I didn’t have the energy or the insurance to do so. I told myself to sleep and that I would go tomorrow. I took some of my girlfriend's sleeping meds and collapsed into bed. I think I fell asleep almost immediately. I was drained.

Today I woke up… and I wish I hadn’t. My skin was no longer itchy, I was beyond relieved. I laid there in absolute comfort rubbing my skin gently. I put my hand to my mouth to see how my cut was doing only to find no cut in my skin. I frantically felt all over my face checking both sides of my mouth, I felt nothing. I sat up in my bed and when I did my foot touched something at the end of the bed. It almost felt like a grocery bag. I flipped over the blanket and saw a huge pile of something. It almost looked like the skin of an onion. I was confused quickly trying to think of what it could be. I felt my heart racing as I slowly leaned closer and closer until my eyes widened and I lunged backwards tumbling off the bed…. 

I think it’s a pile of skin. Human skin. My skin. 

I am scared and don’t know what to do. If anyone has any insight or ideas that would be much appreciated. I will give an update when I can.
