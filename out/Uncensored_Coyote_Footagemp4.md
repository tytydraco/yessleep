When I was in college, I worked for a fetish pornographer. I was a cameraman. The pay was good, the hours were reasonable, it was better than any mc-job I've ever worked at.

I'm an old man as I write this. Just turned 62. I look back on my life and reminisce. Nothing in particular, good times and bad. I think about the time I met my wife, the time we got married, and the exact moment our daughter was born. Precious memories. It seems that, as you age, all you have are memories. Depending on who you ask, that's either a good thing, or a bad, terrible ordeal that makes you lose sleep. 


That's why I'm writing all this down. I hope that by doing so will help me sleep at night again. Get back into the groove of life. This isn't the first time I've written to get something off my chest, I was a little shit as a kid. This one time, I was playing in the park with these kids, and one of them dared me to throw a baseball into the front window of what I thought was an abandoned house. I wanted them to think I was cool.



What I'm trying to say is, writing about my problems in the past has done a lot of good for me. I hope by doing it again, it'll do the same. The only difference is, unlike the formerly homeless man of my youth, the man I shall be writing about is somebody I don't want to be in the same breathing air with.


In my college days, I was a much different man than I am now. I was a peacock: every chance I got I'd be out showing off, hoping to get the opportunity to have a girl in my bed whenever one would look my way. 


College was the first time in my life where I was without any parental supervision. When it wasn't my parents, it was either my teachers or God on Sunday looking down on me. Watching my every move. College to me at least was the only time I ever had my own breathing room.


And boy did I take advantage of it. I must've bed probably 20 girls during my 4 year tour of duty. I was always a gentleman during my conquests. That timed little country boy never really left, even as I became a man. If the girl wasn't interested I wouldn't press the issue further, but of course that rarely ever happened. I always took care of myself. If you know me in real life, you'd be surprised. You'd think I was talking shit. I wasn't always a crotchety old guy, you know.



I used to have the body of Arnold once. Combined that with wit and a good sense of humor, and my bed was never empty. When I wasn't currently having sex, I was plotting new ways to achieve sex. That's how I ended up working for V.C.M in the first place.



It all started one Friday night. My friends and I were up to our usual ways, drinking and raising Hell. We had this little spot outside campus we'd go to get properly lubricated. This Irish place called O'Shiestys Bar and Grill. It was the cheapest place in the neighborhood and were the last to close.



We were at the bar, slamming back steins and pretzels looking at the TV. Steins seemed like an odd choice for an Irish bar. It might've been the beer talking, but those pretzels were ungodly delicious. I swear, I've never eaten anything as delicious. This is in no way a guerilla advertising for O'Shiestys Bar and Grill, I'm just saying, they must've put heroin in the dough or something. There's no way, honestly. I'm not exactly a bar food gordan Ramsey, but the food at O'Shiestys is divine.



I had a pint of beer in my bladder, and without divulging much, I had to hose down Paradise. In the bathroom, I hitched up at a urinal next to this tall guy. He had long black hair and a black cowboy hat. What was eye catching was the conversation we had.


"Hey buddy, want to make $500 bucks?" He asked.


Proper men's room etiquette says you should never respond when somebody asks you a question. Unless that question is asking if the stall is open, you never talk to people there. I wish I took my own advice, because I made the mistake of responding to this guy.



"Huh?"



"I'm serious, you can make 500 bucks American if you come work for me."



"Look pal, I'm flattered, but I don't swing that way." I replied, washing my hands. 



The man chuckled.



"Well, lucky for you I'm married."



"Heh, never stopped me before." I replied.



Mama, if you're looking down at me while I write this, please forgive me. I was a devil back then, I admit. I'm a changed man, I promise.



"I get all the ass I can handle, but this ain't that type of proposal."



"Whatever. Look pal, do you need something? I don't usually talk to dudes in the John, and I want to keep it that way."



"You caught me. I'm actually the bathroom stall rapist. Foiled at last." He joked.



I smirked, grabbing a paper towel and wiping my hands off. 



"What if I told you, you get to be around half naked chicks?"



My ears perked when he said that. Like offering meth to a tweaker, my little rat brain was starting to click.



"Now you're speaking my language, Cowboy."



"I know a little Americano: I run an online media business and I need a new cameraman. The old one, didn't stick around. Religious reasons or something."



"Online media business, huh? I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you don't shoot weddings."



"Guilty as charged. The name's VCM, proud father of Black Rabbit Entertainment. We cater to an older audience, if you know what I mean. I'm looking for someone to man the camera at the studio. Are you interested?"



"You know, you're awfully chatty for a stranger in a bathroom. That don't mean I ain't interested in what you have to say."



I paused, before speaking again.

"You ain't bullshitting when you say I'll make $500 an hour?"

The stranger flushes, washes his hands, and begins to reach into his pocket.

"I swear to God if you whip out your dick I'll kill ya."

He pulled out a black leather wallet and opened it, revealing a blotch of green that looked as thick as a brick.

"Right now I have 10 thousand dollars in my wallet I carry around everyday. This is pocket money to me. This is nothing, I use this when I run out of toilet paper to wipe my ass."



"How charming."



"The point is, I have money to burn. It's no concern of mine. How would you like to feel the same?" 



"You know, you could be a cult leader with that silver tongue of yours, Cowboy."

"Who said I'm not?"



With one flick of his wrist, he produced a black little rectangle and held it between two fingers encased in even blacker leather gloves.



"I don't bite, but the girls I work with do."



I snatched it out of his hand, the card felt smooth. Perhaps vinyl? Both sides were black, on the front of the card was the outline of what looked like the Playboy rabbit. Except this one had a floppy let ear, had beady eyes, and a red bow tie. In yellow font, it read "Black Rabbit Productions." On the card's backside, the phrase "We're all nasty" was written in quotations.



"If you're not doing anything important tomorrow, how about you give me a call? I gotta go, don't know about you but I got a game to watch. Adiòs."



With that, he left. I left the bathroom and returned to my friends, who were still drinking.



"Hey Paul, thought you fell in. Who was that? Your boyfriend?" My friend Pete asked, clearly drunk and slurring his words.



"Man, shut up. That guy offered me a job, actually."



"A job? About time, with your broke ass."



I like Pete, I really do, but he has a big mouth. I can't deal with him when he's drunk. With the remaining dignity I had, I paid for my drinks and left.



"Yeah, get back to your boyfriend. I always knew you were a homo."



I flipped him off before leaving the building. On my drive home I considered what that guy said. Was he actually telling the truth? Or telling me what I wanted to hear? 500 bucks for just pointing a camera? There had to be more to it. Nobody gets paid that much to do practically nothing. 



At the time, I was too buzzed to think straight. I was too busy thinking with my head that my brain was collecting dust. I'd have to sleep on it before I make any further decisions. 


I wish I never even spoke to that man. I should have told him to fuck off when I had the chance. I wish I threw that damn card out the window. But then, I wouldn't be writing all this if I made the right decision.



I went to bed that night and woke up at noon the next day. My mind all but blanked from the night before. It took me a second to register what exactly happened, but seeing VC's card on the nightstand jogged it all back.



I just stared at it for awhile. Should I or should I not call the number, If I don't call, it'll all be as if it were a dream. But, if I do, a whole new genre of pussy was within reach, assuming V was telling the truth. 


As the phone rang, I couldn't help but feel giggly. I felt like a little kid doing something naughty, like stealing a pack of gum from the store without getting noticed. It felt like I was doing something I wasn't supposed to, that rush of knowing you're not supposed to do it makes it so exciting.



Finally, they picked up.

I had a brief conversation with the receptionist, explaining what happened last night. She was nice enough, very understanding. I like that in customer service.


I hang up and look at the wall on the other side of the room. My roommate was sleeping off a hangover, a chainsaw revving couldn't wake him up. I didn't have to be too quiet. I was still tired from the night before, I could spend the day sleeping or I can actually be a good student and catch up on the ever growing stack of late work that was piling up.



I could do all that, or, I can take VC up on his offer.  I've always been up for adventure, taking this job would be right up my alley. Who knows, I might like it. I sure as Hell wasn't gonna be cooped up in here all day with my nose in books.



How bad could it be? Honestly? I took a shower, brushed my teeth, combed my hair, sprayed on deodorant, and grabbed my car keys. I knew where the Vanderbilt Garage was so I didn't have to look it up on Google maps. But while I was online, I thought I'd look up Black Rabbit Productions. I didn't find a whole lot, but I did find an article that caught my eye.



"Woman missing for 2 weeks found at the bottom of a ravine."



"24 year old Jennifer Nichols was found dead at Yosemite National Park after being missing for 2 weeks. Former Black Rabbit actress went missing just a week before Thanksgiving, a statewide missing persons search was led by her husband."



God, I can't imagine having someone you love vanish out of thin air like that. Only to be found dead, I suppose bad news is better than waiting up at night for a wife that's never coming home. 



As tragic and soul crushing as that is, and don't get me wrong that is a tragedy, I have the feeling there's more to the story than what the paper says. Nobody just vanishes like that, just out of the blue. Was she kidnapped? Did she go out for smokes and keep on driving? We're nowhere near Yosemite, did she drive all the way over there to become a hermit? Start a new life? It just doesn't make sense.



What gave me a weird feeling was her choice of career. Black Rabbit. Maybe I'm just jumping the gun. Is there a chance that VC's luring girls off the street and killing them? This whole thing is making my head spin. I don't know this guy, for all I know he could be a freak. I should bring a knife with me, just in case he tried something.



This was all happening so fast. I should get a hold of myself before I make a hasty decision. For all I know, this guy could not be some secret serial killer. Just because someone who worked for him died, doesn't mean he killed her. If some old lady working for Walmart was found dead in her home, does that mean the Walton Family themselves put a hit on her? No. For all I know, this could be a case of suicide. I mean, it makes sense. She drove all the way to Yosemite to see something pretty before she took her dirt nap. 



Seeing that article gave me a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. My drive to Vanderbilt was tense, I didn't have the radio on the entire trip. And I always have it on, it breaks the silence. I needed time to think. I thought to myself, "should I be doing this? I could turn around right now and be done with it.". I shrugged it off, chalked it up to jitters. I just thought I was getting inside my own head about it. 



All I know was at the end of this trip, I had the chance for some major boobage. And I wasn't gonna pass it up. In hindsight, I shouldn't have been so excited. I could go online and look up tits for free.



A half hour later, I pulled into the dirt parking lot that encircled the garage. I hate parking far away, especially if I had a wicked shit to take. But I did that on purpose, it allowed me to survey the area. Take in the sights. Locate possible exits. I've always passed by this place, but never took the time to look closely at it. It was always a background area, like Wyoming. A piece of the scenery. 



The Vanderbilt logo was long faded, only a blue V was left untouched by the cold hand of time. It looked like a super villain hideout, it was definitely being used by a monster. When I was younger, I used to be really into history, specifically local history. Vanderbilt was an oil man who set up shop here in the 50s. But thanks to the 2008 recession, they cashed out. The only living relic of the Vanderbilt Empire is the laboratory South side. 



The building itself was a warehouse with 3 large garage doors to the left side of the building. Fitting, oil trucks are massive. There was no other cars in the parking lot except mine and a polished 76' dodge charger. I'll give him credit, for a "potential" serial killer, VCM had good taste in cars. 



I crossed the road leading to the main building and walked inside. The receptionist on the phone was sitting at an oak desk in the middle of the room. She was attractive, in a bored housewife sort of way. No disrespect at all, I always had a thing for older women. That's why my wife's 72. Even before our kids had kids, I'd call her grandma. She doesn't seem to mind.


 The receptionist smiled at me as I introduced myself. "I'm Paul, from the phone. I'm here for the position."


"Oh yes, we've been expecting you. Please, down the hall to the right. VC is expecting you in his office. Welcome aboard Paul." She said in a cheery voice that seemed genuine.



I thanked her and made my way down the hall. Country music was playing on the speakers as I made the journ. I don't mind country, I honestly don't. If i'm in a car with someone and they have country on, I'm not gonna be a dick and have them change it. Sometimes I voluntarily put on country.



So does VC I see. On the walls, I see memorabilia from a time before me. In a glass case on the wall was an old, worn out flag. It looked burned on one side. On the bottom there was a little caption that read "Remember The 2nd". On another wall, in another glass case was a license plate from Tennessee. This caption read, "Nashville  was my Fort Sumter"



Was this guy in the 2nd? I mean, he had to be. The Nashville Hijacking started the war, and here he was with a Tennessee licence place. In case you're unaware, "The 2nd" is what we call the 2nd U.S. civil war. A terrorist attack in Nashville back in the day started the war. I read about this, it was my favorite subject in school.


VCM was a civil war veteran, from the looks of it. This guy was getting cooler by the second. I wonder how much pussy he gets?  Man fought for his country and he gets to spend the rest of his life surrounded by the finest babes this side of the Mason Dixon line. VC was starting to win me over that moment, I will admit. I wasn't overly patriotic, but I couldn't help but feel inspired by the guy. Going through hell in the Heartland can't be easy, my grandpa was a veteran of the 2nd and the poor guy had to be hospitalized. If he copes by looking at fat titties all day then God bless him.


I'm ashamed at how easy it was to be suckered in by him. He had the charisma of a TV preacher, just without the accent. VCM was a real life superman. Somebody to idolize and look up to. How foolish was I to believe him. I don't doubt the blood he sacrificed to protect this country tis of thee, but they say the most deadly of predators appear non threatening.



My daughter is big into animals, she's studying to be a veterinarian you see. She tells me all this stuff about animals and most of the time I can't understand a word she says. But the most interesting aspect about her field of study are the stories she tells. One time she told me about a friend of hers who lived on a farm. One day, she goes out to pasture and sees one of the prize bulls on it's back dead. She thought it had to be the work of coyotes or some other beast looking for a meal in the dead of night. An animal that strong doesn't just keel over for no reason.



To make a long story short, what killed the bull was this little parasitic wasp. Perhaps you're aware of the tarantula hawk? The nasty little critter that makes a nursery out of living spiders? This bug's similar. What it does is it lays eggs inside the cuts and open wounds of larger game. It's kids get a free ride and a free lunch, much to the expense of the host. Turned out there was a hive of those nasty little Devil bugs in an old hollow log out there in the grazing field. It's kinda impressive when you think about it, a little wasp taking down a huge bull like that. 



 The most dangerous enemy you'll face in this life are the ones who don't seem like a threat outwardly. The silent assassins of the world. The foulest creature has the prettiest smile.



VCM had me where he wanted me. I kept walking down the hallway, admiring the artifacts when I reached a windowless set of double doors. I opened them and honestly, I felt like I just stepped into a whole other world. The brightly lit lobby I just came from disappeared and was replaced with this dark corridor. The only lights were focused on these life sized photos of women with their mouths wide open and their bare torsos exposed. Some of these women had their tongues out, most of them had this longing gaze.



I recoiled physically upon entering this part of the building. I guess I got so preoccupied gazing at his war memorabilia that I must've forgotten for a minute that this was a porn studio I was in. I'll give VC credit though, these women were clearly grown ups. Nothing fishy happening in that direction.



I can only assume the women on those walls were past actresses. Women who worked for VC at one point in their lives. The song "Maneater" and "Hungry like the Wolf" were playing on loop in this section. I kept on walking, taking my time to carefully look at each and every girl he had. One photo that stuck out was that of a model by the stage name of "Zelda". Now, this particular photo didn't stand out in the way you'd think. It wasn't different from any of the other pictures in the gallery.



"Zelda" was the same woman from the article. The woman who was found dead in Yosemite. To this day, I still have no idea if VCM was responsible for that girl's death or not. If the man did kill her, he'd most likely try to cover his tracks. He wouldn't have a life sized photo of his victim just hung up out in the open like that, he'd burn that photo to ash. Wash his hands of the whole situation. You can't be acquitted if the victim never existed. On the other hand, there's the possibility that he really is some psycho maniac. Well, more than usual. He keeps photos of his victims around as some sort of sick souvenir. A reminder of all his wicked "adventures".



Either way, looking at her knowing that she was dead didn't sit right. As a matter of fact, that entire hallway was giving me the creeps. I didn't want to stick around longer than I had to. I quickened my pace, speeding down the black and red felt covered floors. At the end of the hall was a dead end, to the very left was a door labeled "studio" while the door on the right was labeled "management". I went right.



I knocked on the door. A gruff voice from the other side said to come in. I opened the door, inside two men were waiting to see me. VCM and this bald man with a beard wearing a tactical vest. Was he a cop? I had no idea. "Hey, broseph, long time no see. You know, I didn't exactly get your name last night. What was it again?"



"Paul." I replied.



"Well, Paul, are you ready to start your first day? I should say, I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist. I just expect pure, top tier excellence out of you and anything less is a fireable offense."



He was straight faced as he said it. Then he chuckled.



"Kid I'm fucking with ya. Relax, why so serious? In all seriousness, I'm sure you'll do fine."



"Yeah, it's just, who's he?" I asked, pointing to the other guy.



"Oh, he's Travis. He's the head of security around here. And my number 2. He's the eyes and ears of the business. I owe this guy my life honestly, he keeps all the creeps and weirdos out. I can't tell you how many times some freak tried to come up in here and try to cop a feel with the girls in the back. Good ole Travis here keeps order.



"Speaking of, Travis if you don't mind."



Travis walks over to me with a black metal detector.



"Could you keep your hands up for me for a second?" He instructed, an Irish inflection to his voice.



Up until that point, I completely forgot about the knife I brought with me. I was debating myself if I should tell them or not. They were gonna find out anyway, might as well tell them the truth.



"It's just a formality. We do this to everyone, I assure you. Never know if somebody has anthrax, am I right?" VC chuckled at his own joke while Travis rolled his eyes.



"I should tell you guys right now that I brought a knife with me. Just in case I were mugged on the way here. This side of town gets pretty crazy, especially during summer." I ad-libbed. I couldn't tell him the exact truth. It would've been embarrassing.



"I actually brought the knife on the off chance you might be a serial killer."



I couldn't say that. Thankfully the subject wasn't dwelled on too long.



"Tell me about it, I don't leave the house without my 38. Ain't getting jumped tonight, that's for sure."



"Alright, he's clean." Travis said, returning to parade rest at V's side.



"Goody. Come with me kid, allow me to show you an entirely different plane of existence."



V led the way, leading me out of the office and into the studio. Travis stayed behind, watching me through cracks in the drywall. That guy gives me the creeps, still to this day I have nightmares of him somehow finding me. Kicking my door down in the dead of night and pulling a bullet in my chest. As I write this, I live across the country. The thought of black rabbit tracking me down is slim to none. But not impossible. I live in a constant state of fear, not only for myself but for my family. If they come back, I'll be ready.



I accompanied VC to the studio. A large room filled with filming equipment opened up in front of me. "This is where the magic is made, my friend. Luckily for you, today's a rather easy first day. The only item on the agenda is a commission piece. Some rich guy from Japan paid us 20 grand for a birthday tribute video." VC explained.



From across the room, the sound of clicking high heels comes ever so close. A woman in glasses came marching over, she looked frazzled. She was holding a clipboard. She had red hair and the longest legs of any chick I've ever seen. She went right up to VC and whispered something to him. I couldn't help but overhear a little bit of their private conversation. 

"The girls are ready sir." 



"Wonderful, is *everything* ready?" He asked.



"I do believe so."



"Awesome. Dim the lights, get everything in order. It's about 2 minutes to Showtime."



I guess they must've caught onto the fact I was eavesdropping, because the woman in Red let out an audible "who's the new guy?"



Crap. Momma always said Jesus hates an eavesdropper. 



"Mrs. Nancy, this here is Paul. He's the new camera operator specialist." VC said in a tone that sounded a lot like sarcasm.



"New guy, huh? Nice to meet you."



To be polite, I stuck my hand out for a handshake. The woman in Red looks at me like I brought her a flaming bag of dog shit.



"Don't take this the wrong way, Paul, but I don't shake hands on the first day."



"Oh." I said, awkwardly putting my hand back down. 



"The last camera guy lasted a week. The one before just 2 days. Prove yourself around here and maybe, just maybe."



Did I do something wrong? I couldn't have been that noticeable listening in. I wasn't exactly doing that on purpose. It's like, I acknowledge I was doing it, but you don't have to be such a bitch about it. Is that such a controversial opinion to have?



Whatever, maybe I caught her on a bad day or something. Film sets can be pretty hectic. So much running around, trying to get everything 100% perfect. Set design, lighting, sound rigging. There's about a million and 1 things to do just to get everything just right. It's like war, no time for stupid questions. Keep your head down, do what you're told, and you might just survive.



It's a lot like trucking in a way. The yard can get crazy busy sometimes. I understand the rush of and hustle of the workload. Who knows, maybe Nancy and I will become the best of friends. Maybe even a little more.



I sucked it up and took my place on set. The "set" wasn't that complicated. There was a queen bed with one of those valentines heart headboards. There was a middle aged woman sitting at the foot of the bed. She was wearing lion face paint and ripped up clothes. The face paint didn't do much to hide her age, not that I minded. She actually looked nice. I gave her a half hearted wave and she waved back. At least she was a lot nicer than Sarah.



Next to the bed was a prop dresser and a prop wardrobe. There was a black chest on the dresser, it was the same velvet used in the portrait room. It had thumb sized holes all over, maybe a finger's length apart. It looked like one of those boxes they used to haul mice at petco. I didn't think anything about it, I was mainly focused on getting the camera set up. It didn't take too long, it was relatively new but manageable to operate.



"You the guy, huh?" The woman on the bed asked.



"Yeah, uh, my name's Paul."



"Nice to meet ya, Paul. I'm Nicole. How are you liking the place so far?"



"It's alright, I guess."



"Trust me, you'll love it. It takes a while, but you get used to it. It grows on you. You learn to love it."



"Whatever you say."



"Want some advice? Do everything Velvl tells you to, and everything will be fine. He's a genius."



"Uh huh."



"I can't say too much, I don't want to stress my throat out. But I will say this, don't piss him off."



Her last statement caught me off guard. 



"Okay?" I replied back.



"Relax, you'll do fine."  



Don't piss him off? What's that supposed to mean? To me, it sounded more like a threat than a friendly piece of advice. 



Should I even be here? Ever since I stepped foot into the building, I've been having this weird feeling. I've tried to ignore it, but I can't deny it anymore. It's honestly like the baseball incident all over again. It's a matter of "should I stay, should I go?" There's nothing stopping me from running if I really wanted to. Not like he knows where I live.



I sighed. I honestly don't know what to think. All I know is I'm here and while I'm here I might as well stick it out.



"Quiet on set please." VC announced.



"Good luck." Nicole whispered. 



I got into position and readied the camera. Nicole fixed her posture and stared at the camera with a longing gaze. I couldn't help but get an erection looking at her.



"We go live in 3, 2,"



He mouthed 1 and motioned me to press record. I did as he instructed.



"Mr. Miagi, this is your girl Cat-lin Jenner. We here at Black Rabbit wanted to wish you a very happy birthday. 57 is such a big number, you're mommy's big boy." Nicole said breathily.



"I think mommy's special boy should be rewarded on such a special day. What's a special birthday without a special birthday cake? You're in luck, because mommy is just soo hungry. I can hardly stand it, the hunger pangs. I should eat something. What do you think mommy should eat?"



So far so good. The footage was coming in nice, the audio was perfect, and my I was as hard as an oak tree. Maybe I got VC all wrong, Hell this was a dream job! 500 an hour just to point a camera? Hell I would've done it for free.



"I can hardly stand it anymore." Nicole moaned.



"I need something to eat, and bad. Luckily for you, I know exactly what."



Nicole stands up and walks over to the black chest. She opens it and smiles. 



"Oh hello, what do we have here?" She asks, licking her lips.



I was starting to get invested in the story, you see. I wanted to see where this was going more than anyone. 



Nicole grabs the chest and walks back to the bed.



"I found something that might just fill this big belly of mine."



She reaches into the chest and pulls out, I shit you not, a newborn coyote. Its eyes were closed and were no bigger than her palm. Must've been a premature birth.



My eyes widened. If I wasn't paying attention before, I sure as shit was now.



Was this some type of bit they were doing? Some injoke I wasn't aware of? Either way, I was wondering where they were going with this. I had pins and needles piercing into me like broken glass. Shit was getting sketchy.



"Not exactly a full course meal, but I think it should do the job just nicely. God, I can feel it throbbing inside me right now. Hell, I'm probably doing it a favor. Little guy can't make it in the wild anyway, I'm just putting it out of its misery."



Nicole grabbed the coyote pup and placed it on her bare stomach.



"Hear that little guy, you're gonna die inside the gut of a superior predator. Just like nature intended."



My boner I had before was nowhere to be found. I felt like a kid seeing a horror movie I was way too young for. Sweat was forming at the top of my forehead. I felt like I shouldn't see this. I shouldn't be anywhere near this. My stomach was starting to form a fist sized knot. This is starting to become uncomfortable.



The coyote pup started to squeal, which Nicole took as a sign to torment it further.



"Hear that? It can't wait to be eaten. It's entire life was leading up to this moment. To become my dinner. It knows its place at the bottom of the food chain. It can't wait to die."



Nicole picked it up and began to lick its twitching little body. 



"What the fuck?" I exclaimed. This was too much. This is turning into some fucked up fetish shit. 



I began to get nauseas. My mouth was watering and my stomach was lurching. I had to leave, I had to run. Get as far from this hell house as possible. Just drive, drive until I'm either out of gas or out of state.



A cold piece of metal pressed into the side of my head. A clicking sound stung my ear.



"Stop recording for any reason, and I will kill you." VC growled.



I knew the sound of a loaded revolver. It wasn't new. My grandpa used to take me hunting when I was little. His side arm was a dirty harry style 44 magnum. I learned to shoot with that gun. All my life I was taught what to do if I had a bear charge at me.



Never in my life had I ever had someone hold a gun to my head.



"Hey man, take it easy." I whimpered.



"Sssssh, the video's not over yet." He replied.



He dug through my pants, trying to find the knife I told him about. Like a jackass. 



He found it. He yanked it from out of my waistband, and I swear to God he was getting off to it. 



"You won't be needing this. Keep filming, Paulie."



I could feel this layer of ooze form the moment he called me Paulie. It felt like a greasy, oozing snake was wrapping around my throat, coiling ever so tightly around my windpipe. Hell, i'm sure that's something the mother fucker gets off too. I wouldn't put it past him.



Nicole was tormenting that poor creature with her tongue, leaving no inch without desecration. She giggled whenever the coyote struggled or whined. This was a sick game to them, it was clear by the sheer disregard for the coyote's very life. It wasn't a living, sentient creature. It was just a prop to these people. Nothing more nothing less. It makes me ill. 



For all I know, maybe VC did kill that woman. I'll bet money on it. He either killed that woman, or some of his little henchmen did the deed. Either way, he had something to do with it. 



At that moment, all I could think about was momma. I was all she had left. Dad died when I was just a boy, and my so-called brother skipped town the moment he came of age. If I were to die, she'd be all alone. I couldn't do that to her. I wouldn't do that to her. I refused to put her through all that. 



I have facial hair. I am a grown ass man. But at that moment, all I could think of was running back to the safety of momma. I started to cry. Never in my 62 years on this planet have I ever cried real tears before besides that moment. I've teared up during sad parts of movies, sure, but I'm talking about full on thumb sucking weeping. It was all I could do.



"What are you crying for, Paulie? This is the best part."



The gravely venom in this man's voice stung like a bullet. I was at an impasse. He took my only form of self defense besides my fists. I needed those to film his perverted little game. I was powerless. I couldn't do anything. I kept my hands on the camera, doing what he said. Praying he wouldn't shoot me. As long as I play along, I'll be fine. 



It was a pipe dream, I see that now. How did I know VC was gonna keep his word? To tell the truth, I didn't. I had no way of knowing. I was shitting myself, praying to the good Lord above that this lunatic doesn't kill me in cold blood. I was white knuckling that camera like a raft in a hurricane. Hanging on for dear life. It was my saving grace, my salvation. I was screwed without it.



Without thinking, I blurted out "You really gonna fucking shoot me?"



I wasn't even trying to hide how scared I was.  That might've been the stupidest thing I have ever said to another person. And I said some dozeys. 



VCM chuckled.



"You talk too much. Think about this logically for a moment, shall we? Why would I shoot you on video? The camera guy. You worry too much kid."



He pulled the barrel of the revolver away from my skull.


"That don't mean stop."



Although he wasn't holding it directly to the base of my head, he was still pointing a gun at me. It felt like a hundred years since I last took a breath. I exhaled like it was my first time doing so. I wasn't out of the woods just yet, but the hard part was over. 



Or so I thought.



Nicole sucked on the coyote pup's head like some fucked up lollipop. I was gagging at this point. The lunch I had earlier was about to make a comeback tour all over the concrete. All the while the fucker was cackling like it was the funniest thing in the world.



"Cat-lin is the best in the business. Doesn't complain, doesn't ask questions. She just does her job. And with more enthusiasm than any other chick I've worked with. God she's good."



Nicole spat the coyote out and smiled. "Hmm, yummy. Can't wait for you to go down. Oh what the hell?"



Back into her mouth it went, except this time the entire animal's body went along for the ride. The bitch thought she was being cute by closing her lips around its feet. There's nothing cute about this. This is sick and depraved. The fact there's a market for this makes me lose sleep at night. Honestly.



Nicole tilted her head back and made this God awful gulping. It was wet and guttural, it sounded like choking. I hope that bitch choked after all these years. Poetic justice if you ask me. 



Once her "meal" was finally down her throat, she rubbed her exposed belly and blew a kiss towards the camera. At least it's over now.



"Hope you enjoyed that, Miagi. I know I did. And thank you daddy V for the meal."



Nicole licked her lips and threw her head back moaning.



"And CUT!" VC yelled.



Nicole laughed.



"Not bad kid, I kinda expected you to pass out by now."



VC took the camera from my hands and manually stopped the recording. I was too stunned to react. I felt like I was flashbanged. I was dizzy and light headed. My whole world was foggy. For a moment I thought I was having a stroke.



"Once again, kitty Kat, you made me proud." VC replied, his basey voice echoing throughout the high walled room. It was as if for a moment, I had died and gone to hell and Satan himself was welcoming me. In a way, it was. Believe me when I say, that man's voice is demonic. As deep as the circles of hell itself.



"It was my pleasure, daddy." Nicole swooned.



VC turns to me and sighs.



"I'll have to edit out Paulie boy's pansy ass crying, but other than that the shot was great. Not bad kid."



I didn't respond. I was still too zoned out to notice anything. You know that feeling when your leg falls asleep? It's numb at first but once you move it around you have about maybe 10 seconds before it starts hurting like a mother? That's how my entire body felt.



"PAUL!"  VC shouted, pulling me out of my daze.



"A deal's a deal, here's a thousand bucks." 



He pulled out his wallet and pulled out 10 Ben Franklins. I looked at him like he threw me a severed head.



"What did you just say?"



"Your cut. Here. I'm a man of my word, not a lot of us left." He chuckled.



"What in the actual fuck IS WRONG WITH YOU?! I don't want your fucking money, you sicko, I want to get the fuck out of here!"



Before he could say anything else, I bolted. I ran back the way I entered, through the portrait gallery, through the lobby, and out the double doors. I say "out" even though "through" would be more accurate. Those shits were glass, I ran through like I was the mother fucking kool aide man. I still have the scar to this day. I tell folk I was stabbed, it's better than telling the truth. That I got it escaping a sex weirdo's lair.



It was just about sundown; my car was still there in the dirt lot, it never looked more beautiful. I managed to actually slide across the hood and hop inside. Key in ignition, I peeled out and hauled ass all the way home. In the car, I couldn't stop painting. It felt like it was raining sandpaper down in my lungs. It hurt to breathe.



A few blocks away from my dorm, at a stoplight, I had a meltdown. I was high off adrenaline, and once the weight of what just happened finally crashed down, I couldn't stop laughing. I was laughing like the joker after nuking Gotham; I was straight cackling. Why shouldn't I? I made it out of a dangerous situation alive, I have the right to laugh.



Then I started crying again. I cried like my oldest son died in my arms, that's how bad it was. I was inconsolable. My eyes ached along with the rest of my body. I looked out the window, seeing birds sitting in the trees and bees pollinating flowers. How I took it all for granted. I was too busy getting laid. I wasn't appreciating life. It's funny in a way; I didn't realize how good life was until I was inches away from losing it.



I called my mother at that stoplight. I've never felt more vulnerable and scared before in my life. I felt like a little boy: the only way a boy feels safe is in the arms of his momma.



I dialed. She picked up and I told her everything. I couldn't stop crying. 

Please. I implore you. Stay away from black rabbit. I don't care what they told you or how good it seems. Stay the fuck away, don't go down the rabbit hole like I did.
