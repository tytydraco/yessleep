I’ve been a mail carrier for almost ten years now.

This isn’t a city route. Not even a small town. I cover the scattered homesteads out in the steppe—places where maybe two or three houses are still standing. The people there are old, quiet. Some keep goats. Most barely leave the house. They just wait for the weekly delivery, because honestly, it’s the only thing still moving between these homes.

I liked the job. The steppe is silent. No one rushes. The road is straight, ancient, worn smooth and stripped of markings long ago. I follow it like a thread—doesn’t really matter if I’m awake or dreaming.

But three weeks ago, a new point appeared on my route.

A settlement called Harvest Hill.

I knew for a fact it hadn’t been there before. I’d never seen it on the schematics, never heard the name from other carriers. But the coordinates were there, clear as day.

“Give it a shot,” my supervisor said. “Someone’s subscribed to a paper out there. Just mark it by hand for now.”

So I went.

There was no road.

The coordinates pointed straight into a field—like an “off-ramp” from Route 27. I kept going, maybe five more miles, just riding through dry grass. And then I saw a stone. Big, flat, cracked like the spine of some ancient creature.

Carved into it were the words: “We are the Gathered.”

That was it. No signpost, no houses, no people. The silence was so deep, I could hear my handlebars creaking when I turned.

But about three hundred meters past the stone, something caught the light. Glass, I thought. Maybe an old car or a rusted water tank.

As I got closer—I saw a window.

A single house stood in the middle of the steppe. Like something out of a dream. Nothing around it. Not even a path.

But there was smoke coming from the chimney.

In the window, someone had hung a piece of cloth. Not a curtain—just a shirt, draped halfway across the glass.

I didn’t even have time to come to a full stop—someone was already standing at the gate.

He wore a simple gray shirt, the kind of thing you’d expect on a farmhand. But it was spotless, almost too clean. He smiled wide, with a kind of childlike warmth.

“You’re here for us?” he asked.

“Just delivering some mail,” I said.

He nodded like he already knew. He didn’t even glance at the envelope.

“You must be tired. Come in—Joyful Brother will get you something warm.”

“You’re… who, exactly?” I asked, before I could stop myself.

“I’m Joyful Brother,” he said, like that explained everything. “And you’re the Guest. That’s nice.”

A woman was already standing in the doorway. She didn’t speak. She just gave a small bow, then turned and walked back inside.

It was warm inside. The wooden floor shifted a little underfoot, and the walls smelled like dust—like the place had been around for decades.

Three people were already seated at the table. They were smiling. One of them tapped his fingers on a glass of water—not nervously, more like a rhythm. The other, an older man with sun-darkened skin, rocked gently back and forth.

I sat down. Someone placed a bowl of porridge in front of me. They called it harvest porridge. It was warm. Too warm, considering how quickly they’d brought it.

“A Guest from the road,” said Joyful Brother. “That’s always a joy. Right, Silent Sister?”

The woman sitting to my right smiled but said nothing. She didn’t blink. I only noticed that when she took a sip of water—and even then, her eyes stayed open.

I was about to ask how many people lived here, maybe make small talk—

But someone cut me off.

“We’re very grateful you came,” said the one tapping the glass. “Not many folks make it out here anymore. And mail… well, mail is important.”

“You knew I was coming?” I asked.

“Didn’t you?” Joyful Brother looked surprised. “Your letter arrived yesterday.”

I was about to thank them for the meal and ask how best to get back when Silent Sister stood up, walked to the cabinet, and took out an envelope.

She held it out with both hands—carefully, like it was something sacred.

“This is for you,” she said. It was the first time I’d heard her speak. Her voice was soft, but flat—like a radio announcer reading without emotion.

The envelope was thin. The paper yellowed.

My name was on it.

The handwriting…

It looked eerily familiar. Like mine. Not always neat, with that slight slant in the R’s and E’s.

I didn’t open it. Not right away.

“Who wrote this?” I asked.

“You did,” Joyful Brother said calmly. “But later.”

The silence changed. It grew heavier. Everyone was still smiling—but none of them met my eyes.

“We don’t keep names here,” he added. “Only letters.”

I held the envelope for a long time, turning it over in my hands. No one rushed me.

Even when I placed it on the table and said,

“Can I read it later?”

Joyful Brother nodded.

“Of course. You’re still on the road.”

The silence wasn’t empty. It felt… dense. Everyone around the table kept smiling, but I could feel something behind those smiles. Maybe it was just exhaustion. Or maybe… whatever they’d been waiting for had already happened.

That’s when the lightning flashed.

A low roll of thunder echoed behind the hills, and almost instantly, the rain started. Not summer rain. Not gentle.

Heavy. Autumn-heavy.

I walked over to the window. The steppe beyond the house had vanished—just a smear of gray grass thrashing against the earth.

“Quick, but strong,” someone behind me said. “The road’s useless now.”

I nodded without speaking.

“We have a room,” Joyful Brother offered. “You can stay the night. The sun will dry everything by morning, and you’ll ride home just fine.”

“I don’t want to impose…”

“A Guest doesn’t impose,” said Silent Sister.

And for the first time, I heard something in her voice.

Something like sincerity.

But strange—like someone who’s already said goodbye to you.

The room was simple: a bed, an old chair, a coarse wool blanket.

I lay down without undressing, just pulled the blanket over me and tried not to think. The letter was in my jacket—I’d tucked it away so I wouldn’t have to see it.

The sound of rain hitting the roof was dull and steady. Almost comforting.

I fell asleep almost immediately.

I woke up to silence.

Not to a sound—but to the lack of one.

The rain had stopped. No wind. No insects. I stared at the ceiling, waiting for my eyes to adjust.

Then, far off—right at the edge of my vision—I saw a light.

Through the window. Just over the grass, beyond the garden—one point of light.

Not a lantern. Not a car.

Something… flickered. Slowly. Like the flame of a candle.

I stepped toward the window. The glass was slightly fogged, but I could still see the figure clearly.

Someone was standing with their back to me.

And they were holding that light.

I don’t know why, but my first thought was: he’s waiting for me.

And then another, more disturbing thought followed: he knows I’ve woken up.

I took a step back.

And in that moment, the figure… turned to face me.

But I didn’t see a face.

Just darkness. A hollow space where the eyes and mouth should’ve been.

I ran out of the room—the house was empty.

The table was still set. The food was still there. But all the chairs were neatly pushed in.

“Hey?!” I shouted. “Joyful Brother?!”

No answer.

I rushed to the front door. The handle didn’t move. The wood was cold and… damp. Like the door had fogged up from the inside. I yanked harder. Nothing.

I ran to the window. It was shuttered from the inside with thick wooden planks. Latched.

I tore it open—and recoiled.

Outside was darkness. Not night—nothingness. Like the steppe wasn’t even there anymore.

Then I heard voices.

From outside. Soft, half-whispers. Several of them, overlapping. Like a song without music.

I leaned in, trying to catch the words.

They repeated:

“Guest. Letter. Back. Guest. Letter. Back.”

Then—crackling. The first scent of smoke.

The wall near the bed darkened. The fire didn’t start from below—it was like something had ignited inside the wood itself.

I threw myself at the door, slamming into it with my shoulder. I screamed. Tore my jacket. Searched for anything—no phone, nothing.

The air thickened fast. I coughed—and felt the oxygen thinning.

The floor creaked beneath me.

Then—a voice behind me.

“Why didn’t you read it?”

I woke up on the floor.

My throat burned. I was wheezing, like I’d been screaming for hours. My mouth was full of dust. My hands were covered in ash.

The house… it was the same.

But it wasn’t.

The ceiling had collapsed in one corner. The windows were shattered, the frames ripped out. On the table—cobwebs, dry leaves, the broken remains of a plate.

I stood up slowly, listening.

Nothing. Not a sound.

The front door was open now. Just ajar, like a forgotten cellar.

I stepped outside.

The sun hung low. The sky was overcast. But I could see it—this was the same settlement.

Only now… it was dead.

Three more houses. All rotting. Walls tilted. Roofs collapsed. No footprints. No smoke. No faces.

I walked a few steps.

At the edge of the yard—my bicycle. Still locked to an old fence post, coated in dust, but intact.

I looked back.

Nothing moved. Even the grass stood still.

I got on the bike and rode away.

Without looking back.

On the way back, I tried to make sense of it.

It all seemed… logical, in its own way.

I probably overheated. Got turned around. Found an old abandoned house, went in to rest. Maybe passed out—heat, fatigue, sunstroke.

Everything else… just a dream.

I mean, I haven’t lost my mind. Right?

When I got home, I checked the map. Harvest Hill wasn’t on it. Not even in the old printed archives.

I didn’t tell anyone. Just figured that route wasn’t for me anymore. I called the office and asked to be reassigned.

They didn’t ask questions.

That should’ve been the end of it.

But when I grabbed my jacket from the hallway—

I felt something in the pocket.

An envelope. Yellowed with age.

I opened it.

Inside was just two words, written in my own handwriting:

Come back.

And underneath it, the signature:

Joyful Brother.
