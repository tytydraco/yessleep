I wish I never came here, to the town of Fredericksburg. The roads are like ebony in the night, and the town doesn’t operate like it should.

Thankfully, I managed to obtain the book before the moon rose and became my world. It details dos and don’ts — what I need to do before the moon blinks and pitch blackness falls upon the town.

As I speed through the town, driving back home after paying to keep the town’s lights on, the town begins to grows in activity. Shadows dance, creatures lurk, and I can feel eyes boring holes into my body. Feeling my skin prick as if a pore is being stretched open is a horrible feeling, and I’ve learned my lesson from last time it happened — stitches aren’t cheap and hard to do yourself.

Even though the world may have ground to a halt, cops are still wandering around this town — or at least what the book calls “cops.” They come in two varieties: the normal ones that tell me to slow down, and another that will hang me from the closest tree the second it comes to my car window.

If the lights flicker red and blue, I’m safe. Any other color — I can’t stop under any circumstance.

If the cop gets out and has too many eyes, too many hands, too many feet — that’s a big no. If it refuses to share its name, pulls up to me from the side, or slowly begins to appear in my backseat, also good time to get the hell out of there.

Last time I was pulled over, it came out looking like a cop, though its body seemed to ripple in the lights of the cop car — between all of its joints. As it came closer, it became apparent why: its arms, legs, chest, and head were all separated from each other, hovering close together to appear like one body. If I wasn’t pulled over outside of town, I probably wouldn’t have noticed. But I’m always on edge between town and my home. The woods have their own laundry list of issues. Eyes stare at me hungrily, begging for me to get out of my car.

I hate it here, though the book does keep me safe with it’s wisdom, tips and tricks. I just hope when I sleep tonight, I’ll wake up to the sun shining through my window — rather than the lantern of a street wanderer, the light glaring from a ghost, or worst of all, the moon deciding to peek once again.

Last time that happened, I had to remain still for hours till it became bored and moved back to it’s place in the sky. Any movement I made burned the part of the body that moved.

I assume the moon takes great delight in watching me suffer — coming down personally to deliver it face to face. Though it doesn’t know that one day I'll escape, the book tells me it's possible, and I’m inclined to believe it. After all, the author handed it to me before I woke up here, with the moon looking down on me as a hunter would to it’s prey.
