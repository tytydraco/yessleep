My step mom's a monster and no one knows it. Every morning at 6 am sharp she slithers into a skin suit. Wriggling and stretching it in unnatural ways just to get it to sit right. It never does. The skin just hangs, swaying with every small movement she makes. I don't know how anyone can think it looks natural. Not when there is a disgusting beast underneath. To anyone who doesn't know her, she looks like a regular 44yro woman, with some loose skin one might assume is from weight loss. She Works for the state, has a husband, and takes yearly vacations. Someone other people are jealous of.

I learned she was a monster after knowing her for 6 months. We met at my 10th birthday party. My birthday is in January but because of how cold it was, my father and i decided to wait and have a big pool party over the summer. She had a son around my age and brought him to participate in my party. Apparently her and my father were friends years before I was born. When my mom was still alive and just settling down with my dad. I had never seen nor heard of her before and I was curious about the random kid that had shown up at my party, non stop talking about poop and diarrhea. I didn't get the chance to ask about him until the party started to wind down and people had left for the day, including him. 

Once everyone was gone my father finally introduced me to her. She seemed nice at first. She Explained the random boy was her son and after talking to her and showing off a new nail kit I had got they left. Little did I know this would be the biggest turning point in my life. 

Over the next few months she was around the house more. Staying the night every once in a while before she finally moved in. During that time I thought she was a wonderful person. She spoiled me with manicures and shopping trips. Acted like she was interested in everything I was doing. She wasn't. And it wouldn't be until 3 weeks after my 11th birthday that I would descover who she really was, or even start to notice the skin suit. 

I remember the first time I seen her true self. Her skin mask slipped just a little. Just enough for me to catch a glance at what was underneath. It looked like a pulsating gray flesh tumor that had sprung out the side of her neck. It pulsed in an unnatural rhythm. Nothing like a normal heart. It was fast and random. It only took her a second before she realized what was exposed and quickly hid it. I was scarred. I couldn't tear my gaze away from where the skin stuck out. Trying to find the seam between the mask and the rest of the suit. I had never seen anything like it and didn't know what to do or say. She had been lecturing me about something before her true skin showed. I knew it was important but after what I had seen I couldn't think of anything else.

After that she wasn't as worried about hidding it from me. She would get mad and a little gray blob would stick out. Sometimes more. One time I had an accident and didnt clean the poop out of my underwear properly before putting it with the rest of my dirty cloths. She was so livid that the unnatural movments of her mouth had lifted the mask, showing a band of the gray flesh that was underneath. Showing that skin still doing that unnatural pulse. This time I could see more. There were dark green veins intertwined with each other, crossing and splitting in random places. The veins pulsed a separate rhythm from the skin itself. It was more controlled. Still not like any normal human heart would beat, but resembled a heartbeat better than whatever the skin was doing. 

Right as she was in the middle of lecturing me, we heard my dad come out of his office. He worked from home doing a coding job. He had worked there for decades before I was born, and probably will work there until the day he dies. He loves his job. Waking up in the early hours of the morning just to get to work. His hours were 9-5 but he didn't care. Some days he would be in his office from 4 am till 10 pm just doing his work. Only leaving his office to take me to school and make dinner. 

She moved frantically to shove herself back into that skin suit, forgetting a little chunk on the side of her neck. My dad looked at it. I seen a slight look of disgust cross his face. I thought maybe now he would see what was underneath. I was waiting for this moment. Unsure of how to bring up the gray flesh blob that was my step mom, waiting for her to show her true self around him so I wouldn't have to explain anything. Knowing even if I tried to explain, no one would believe me. It didn't work. He quickly replaced that look of disgust with slight concern as he asked what was going on. My step mom gave him a story about all the back talk and disrespect I was giving her during her lecture. Told him I was getting shit all over the house and intentionally left a masive turd in my underwear befor throwing them down the laundry shoot to be washed, smearing shit all down the sides of it. I hadn't said one thing that entire time. I looked at him in that moment, a pleading glare trying to get him to look at that disgusting thing still pulsing from the side of her neck, and understand that what she was saying was complete bullshit. but he didn't. He believed every word she said, and left her to continue while he went back into his office to keep working. 

After that she didn't care about keeping the mask on at home. She would walk through the door after a long day of work and peel off her mask with the same satisfied look of someone who just took their bra off after wearing it for 12 hrs. She kept the mask in her pocket just incase someone showed up to the house and she needed to slip it on in a moments notice. My father pretended that she looked the same as when she wore the mask, ignoring the ugly underneath. 

Her true face was like nothing I had seen before. It was that same gray color as what I had seen pop out from the side of her neck, covered in thoes twisting green veins. It was absolutely terrifying. Her mouth was large and gaped at an odd angle, with small fangs lining the inside. Hundreds of rows, all leading back into the abyss that was her mouth. Almost like a sharks. Angled backwards so anything caught can't get out. She had 2 large horns sitting just above her temples, curling back into a spiral. Horns you would expect to see Satan wearing. Cracked and split in some places, with a yellow hue like Unwashed teeth. The left horn was missing the very tip, having broken off who know how long ago, revealing a black abyss inside, driping dark green goo. Now I know why she kept the hair of her skin mask so curly and large. Spending hours sometimes just to get it right. To hide the horns. 

And then her eyes. Her eyes were an abyss of their own but not quite. A weird deep unnatural green seeped out of them, the same as the horn, only to disappearinto one of her face wrinkles. Her face was not even shaped like a head. Resembling a bloob fish more than a preson, with countless skin folds running horizontally across her face.  towards the back of both holes was a reflection. Light was reflecting off of something back there. Maybe an eye, but I never got close enough to confirm it, and never will. 

Once the mask was off that ment my life was hell. Anything and everything that went wrong in her life got let out on me in a tiraid of insults and degrading comments. She framed me for things I didn't do so I would be in trouble with my father, making sure to ruin our relationship. She never beat me but I think that was a part of the mind games. Everything with her was a mind game. 

She would starve me. Giving me just a little bit of food to tell people I was being fed at home and that was it. She intentionally cooked enough for her and my father to have full plates while giving me what was left in the pot. Ensuring I couldn't get more food. 

She used her son in her mind games aswell. Her son wasn't always around, mostly on weekends and holidays, because of the split custody. She loaded his plate with food. Giving him more than what was on my father's plates sometimes. She always made sure he had everything he wanted and made sure i could see him getting it. Even if what he wanted was me. 

Her son and I got along alright at first. He was weird and obsessed with diarrhea. But then he started participating in her mind games too. There was one time where him and I made a plan.  He acted like he seen what she was doing to me and felt bad, so he wanted to make sure I got to play on my own Xbox I had been gifted that past Christmas. We waited for them to go to sleep and went down to the spare room in the basement that used to be my dad's office before he built a new one upstairs. We took turns playing roblox and minecraft until it got to about 3 am. I was exhausted at that point and wanted to get into my bed and go to sleep.  

I gave the controller to him for his turn and started saying goodnight. He didn't want me to go to my bed. He wanted me to sleep in the spare room where he was supposed to sleep. I told him no, starting to get uncomfortable as coed sleeping was never a thing allowed or even talked about much in my house. He started to get mad, trying to block the way up the stairs. I managed to get past him into the dining room where he continued to pleed with him to just sleep down there as it would be fine. I kept insisting I didn't want to. 

Finally he said "well I'll just go tell my mom that you were up playing on the xbox when you weren't supposed to. He thought that this would get me to do what he wanted but it didn't. 

As a last resort with no idea how to get out of the situation, I told him, "if you tell her I'm going to kill myself. Right here right now."

He gave me an odd look,  smirking slightly, "no you won't," he said as he started to walk towards the stairs to to go to her bedroom. 

I didn't budge. "Yes I will." I reached towards the kitchen drawer that kept the knives. "I will take one of these knives and stab myself if you take one step up thoes stairs. Right in the chest." I pulled a steak knife out of the drawer to prove my point. 

 I had no intentions of actually doing this, but I had to make him believe I would so he wouldt tell her. I was so scared of what my step mom would say, what she would say to my father, that I had no other choice. I couldn't handle another day of insults about how "fat" I was or how much of a manipulator and liar I supposedly was. Of her lecturing and screaming at me for hours. Of her making me out to be a terrible child that's disgusting for smearing shit everywhere. Even though I didn't do anything like that. It didn't matter. If she could convince my father it's something I could have done, she did. 

It worked. He believed me. He stopped going towards the stairs and didn't stop me from going to my room, giving me that same odd look, without the smirk this time. Of course I would still be punished for that night, but at least I knew I had a break before she turned on me again. He ended up telling his other family what happened and it got back to my step mom. 

Nothing would stop her son from getting what he wanted, and now he had my step mom on his side. He would get caught multiple times throughout the years trying to sneak into my room. If he was caught I got in trouble. More time added to my grounding that was supposed to end who knows when. Only she got to decide. 

One time he did manage to sneak into my room. I was asleep so I couldn't do anything. Just sit there while I experienced a weird dream with feeling I had never felt before or could describe at the time. I know now what it was, and who did it. He had taken something from me. Something that I could never get back. And no one cared. 

Once convincing my father that I was a terrible child wasn't enough, she started convincing everyone around me. Even making jokes about how I must be a monster in a skin suit because of how bad I was. The first person was my grandma.  It started with questions from her about how it's going with me and my step mom. I tried to tell her about what she did but it was no use. My step mom had already gotten to her. Told her everything I was going to say and that it would all be lies. That I just wanted to make my step mom out to be a bad person, not the other way around. And it broke me. It really did. Trying to tell someone the truth while they already have their own truth decided hurt. It hurt my soul in a way I had never felt pain before. And it was all my step monsters fault. 

After that most everyone would believe her if I didn't say something first, and even then once they talked to her it was like a spell was placed over them. They looked at me like I was discusting. That same hatred look that she would give me. 

I tried to tell people I really did. I told all my classmates at school. They believed me, but only because I didn't tell them about the skin suit. If I did no one would believe me. I told school counselors about my home life, how she barley fed me. Would put me on punishment for days for having an accident. Cps would get called but nothing would come of it. I assume she must have put a spell on them like she did the other people. 

I always had accidents, and it had convinced me that everything she said was true. At some point I was convinced she was right. That I was a terrible child. That I wasn't worthy of love. That I deserved to be ignored by my father for being a disgusting pig. That I deserved to be starved. That I deserved the mental abuse. That I deserved to be assaulted by her son. All of it started to become true. I must have been the one to do all thoes terrible things she claimed I did, even though I didn't remember doing it. 

But that's wrong. And I know now what she really is. Every morning at 6 am I hear the skin suit creaking and groaning and she shoves her non human body into it. I never seen her fully, and don't want to. I know I'm not the terrible child and yet, there is something there, in my subconscious telling me otherwise. A voice so convincing I have to challenge it every waking second lest I slip into the deep depression that comes with thoes thoughts.

 I think she did something to me too. Some kind of spell or other worldly magic to make me this way. The same she used on other people to get them to believe her unbelievable stories about me. I had woken one night to her hand slithering across my face. Apparently the skin suit had gloves and I had never seen them off. Until now. Her hands were a weird mass of withering tentacles. No wonder her fingers never looked right. It was the tentacles trying to fit into a human hand and work it like a human would. It couldn't do that so it made the excuses of arthritis. It screamed at me about dirty laundry and my shit. I had no idea what it was talking about. But after that night, After it touched me,  It's like I'm tainted. Like it now has some sort of control over my thoughts, trying to make me go crazy.

 I refuse to, and that's why I'm writing this out. Maybe someone will believe me. Maybe it will slip up with its skin suit and someone else will see, see that it isn't a mother but a monster. A step monster.
