[Cassie has been doing some soul-searching](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12c7d0f/how_to_survive_college_we_need_to_make_a/).  I know because she told me while we were trapped in the loft bed of a student from the floor above us that I had met only the day prior.  I’ll get to that.  But the important takeaway was that Cassie was giving up on pretending the inhuman didn’t exist.  This was her life now and she couldn’t ignore it one day and accept it the next.  Her roommate was gone.  Something was after her.  There were things on campus that preyed on students and there were things in the wider world as well.  There was no going back to her delusions of safety.

I’m lucky in that I was raised knowing this.  Cassie had a long, hard journey to get to this point.  She had to rewrite everything she knew about her world and her place in it.

 (if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/)) 

It doesn’t escape my notice that she might have never come to accept how things are if we hadn’t met.  She wasn’t alone anymore.  She had someone else that saw the things she’d seen.

Of course, being her resident expert on the inhuman meant that I was going to get pulled into anything going on with anyone else she knew.  And Cassie knows a *lot* of people.

She brought one of those people back to our dorm room.  It was a Wednesday, so that meant she was coming back from her club meeting. After she told me about her roommate that she maybe probably was in love with, I checked the club schedules and there was only one that matched the days and times Cassie was consistently gone.  I’m sure this will surprise literally no one, but it’s the LGBTQIA+ club.

I absently asked if it was a good meeting when the door swung open.  I didn’t look up, not until the door stayed open a few seconds longer than I expected.

“This is Josh,” she said, jabbing a thumb at the guy behind her.

He was a big dude.  Just someone that’s built like a brick wall and he fills the space he’s in.  I craned my head back to stare up at him and he gave me a big grin and waved awkwardly from the doorway.

“He’s got a problem I think you should talk to him about,” she continued, throwing herself onto the futon.

“It’s silly,” he said apologetically.  “Cassie insisted.”

“She’s kind of a force of nature sometimes,” I muttered.  “It’s fine.  Tell me what’s going on.”

Sometimes innocuous things can be signs of a bigger problem.  I think Cassie has realized that as well, for she was unusually tense on the futon.  She sat there like everything was normal, but I saw how tight her jaw was clenched and how her shoulders were hunched up around her neck.

Josh shuffled into the room and let the door fall shut behind him.  He was very soft-spoken as he explained his problem.  Their dorm room had a mouse in it, he said.  Neither him nor his roommate wanted to tell their RA because then the school would put traps out and they didn’t want to get the mouse killed.  It wasn’t bothering anyone, he said.  It just sometimes poked its head out from behind the radiator or they’d hear it scratching in the walls at night.

They got a live trap instead and set it out.  Then, once the mouse fell for the bait, they put it in a cage and hid it in his closet.  It was pretty easy to take care of, he said.  They got a battery powered light so it wouldn’t be shut up in darkness all the time, bought it some enrichment, and kept it fed.  It seemed quite content.  They were very careful to hide it so that no one would notice that they had a live animal in the dorms.  Josh wanted to take it home with him over the summer and make it his pet mouse.  

Then it got loose.  Except how it got loose was rather strange, and when Cassie heard the story from Josh it made her concerned enough to immediately invite him over to talk to me.

The case was found twisted and smashed.  Like someone had wrung it out like a wet rag.

At least the mouse wasn’t still inside, Josh said tearfully.  It had escaped.  It was okay.  He wouldn’t forgive himself if something bad had happened to it.

He was trying to recapture it, he explained.  He heard it scratching around inside his closet at night and he’d put another live trap in there with its favorite food.  It’d been almost a week now though and it was still eluding capture.  He was worried it’d figured out how to sneak in and out of the trap, because the food was vanishing, and now it sounded like there were multiple mice in there.  His roommate wasn’t happy about them attracting more mice to their room and was demanding that Josh stop his efforts before they get the attention of their RA.

“Have you looked in the closet when you hear the scratching yet?” I asked.

“No, I didn’t want to spook them.  I’m worried they won’t come back.”

“Look - I’m from the country,” I said, trying to sound confident.  “Trust me, mice will come back when there’s food.”

“Maybe he shouldn’t be taking a look by himself,” Cassie said from the futon.

The twisted wire cage.  Maybe it wasn’t a mouse taking the food.

“Yeah,” I said slowly.  “That’s a good idea.”

Josh lowered his voice conspiratorially, which was really unnecessary because a) we were in a room with the door closed and b) he’s pretty quiet already.  I struggled to make out what he was saying.

“Do you think… this is something… *weird*?”

Which I guess is the code word for “inhuman” around here now.

“I think we’d better not take chances,” Cassie replied.  “Right Ashley?”

“Yeah,” I replied.  “We should have a plan at the very least.”

Turned out that he lived on the floor above us.  That made it easy.  We gave him our numbers and he would text or call us when he heard the scratching.  We’d come up and take a peek inside the closet.  A very careful look.  My hope was that if someone else was looking and we had a small group, we’d get the advantages of not being the intended target and also strength in numbers.  Obviously that’s not a guarantee, I’ve seen things now that have directly contradicted both rules, but I wanted to give ourselves every possible precaution.

Best case scenario was I yanked the closet door open and saw some mice running away.

Worst-case scenario… well, I told Cassie and Josh that the backup plan was to run like hell.

“Josh stays by the door,” I said grimly.  “You’re going to be most at risk since it’s your room.  If anything weird happens, *anything at all*, you run.  We’ll be right behind you.  No heroics from anyone.”

Cassie at least waited until Josh was out of the room to ask if I had any theories.  No, I told her.  I didn’t.  The worm was loose somewhere on campus and seemed to have no inclination to return to its hallway, so that hopefully ruled it out.  And I didn’t grow up reading every book on fairytales I could get my hands on, so I don’t have a lot of knowledge off the top of my head on what creatures might live in a closet.  I only know themes and patterns and here, those don’t necessarily matter for much.

“Are you really okay getting involved in this?” I asked.

“Sort of.”  She took a deep breath.  “I’m scared.  But I also want to know what happened to my roommate… and make sure something doesn’t happen to me.”

She didn’t say it, but she glanced at the door.  We hadn’t seen that creature with the long fingers return, but that didn’t mean it had given up interest in her.

“Okay,” I said.  “We wait for Josh to call, then.”

It didn’t take long.  Just a day later, actually.  It was shortly after sunset, because of course everything happens after dark.  The dorms were still pretty active, obviously, which I felt was a good sign that it was legitimately just an escaped mouse and all their mousey friends.

Technically I was right.

But only very technically.

Josh was anxiously pacing outside of his dorm room when we arrived.  He didn’t say anything, just held the door open so that we could enter.  I heard the scratching as soon as we were inside.  It was a softer sound, more erratic than the scratching at Daniel’s door.  There was rustling, punctured by silent pauses, and the sound moved about inside the closet.

It certainly sounded like mice.  Quite a few mice, actually.  I eyed Cassie for a moment.

“How about I open it?” she suggested.

“Are you *sure*?”

She looked scared.  Her eyes were big and she was breathing fast.  She hesitated, then nodded firmly.  No more running from this, she whispered, and I’m not sure she was actually talking to me.  Then she stepped forward and slid the closet door open.

The closet swallowed the light.  We couldn’t see the edges of the sides or even the clothing inside.  There was only darkness and the faint reflection of countless beady eyes.

Cassie said nothing. She barely moved.  She just slid the closet door shut again.

“Nope,” she said, turning to face me, her face expressionless.  “Fucking *nope*.”

And Josh, who I’m sure is very nice and meant well, decided to step into the room to see what was going on.

The closet door slammed open.  I was still facing it, so I saw in the split second before it shot open a couple dozen tiny little paws squeezing through the crack at the edge.  Then they shoved in unison and the door was open and hundreds of tiny furry bodies were pouring out across the floor.  They ran across Cassie’s feet.

Cassie’s panic reaction is to flail.  I learned this when she threw herself backwards, arms waving wildly, and slammed straight into my face.  We went over backwards.  I felt sharp claws scrabbling at my jeans in an attempt to climb over.

Josh.  They were going for Josh.

“GET OUT!” I screamed.  “SHUT THE DOOR!”

I think if we hadn’t stressed over and over that there weren’t going to be any heroics, if we hadn’t explained to Josh that he was probably the person anything inhuman would go after since it was his room, if I hadn’t yelled explicit instructions, and if it wasn’t *very obvious* that the horde was ignoring us to make a beeline for him, he might have stayed right where he was.  

Remained there and died.

But he took one step back and slammed the door.  I had a brief glimpse of his face, pale and stricken with terror, before the heavy painted surface sealed us off from the hallway.

The mound of bodies slammed into the door like a wave breaking against a cliff.  They tumbled backwards over themselves in a roar of tiny claws scratching at the unyielding surface.

Cassie and I were picking ourselves up.  I felt Cassie’s hand in mine.  I wasn’t sure which of us had grabbed the other and when it had happened.  She tugged gently and silently, we backed away to the back of the room.  Then she let go and grabbed hold of the ladder leading into the loft bed instead.

The horde’s attention shifted.  The glossy shine of fur was suddenly broken by countless shining eyes, like beads of ink turning in my direction.  The mound went still… then it began to flow towards me.

“Climb faster!!” I shrieked.

Cassie hauled herself up and then I threw myself up onto the ladder.  I felt a tug at the hem of my jeans, the faint weight of tiny bodies trying to grab hold of my clothing.  I didn’t stop to throw them off.  Cassie was grabbing my shoulders and pulling me up and somehow I found myself at the top of the ladder, throwing myself onto the bed and then I kicked into the air, frantically, until I was convinced that the sensation of tiny claws against my skin was just my imagination.

I rolled over onto my knees and peered over the edge of the loft bed.  Cassie was beside me, also staring down at the floor.

It was covered with tiny bodies.  They surged back and forth like the tide, rocking against the door and then back towards the loft bed where we had taken refuge.  I felt it shudder and shift every time they broke against its legs.

“What now?” Cassie asked.

“I guess… we wait,” I said.

I sat back and got out my phone.  I texted Josh that we were okay, but we might be trapped in here for a little bit.

“I’m not sure why I’m here,” Cassie said.

She laughed a little and I heard a faint trace of hysteria in it.

“I just thought… maybe it was time I stop being a coward.”

I wanted to tell her that there’s nothing wrong with being a coward and that being brave didn’t necessarily involve putting yourself in danger.  That back home, we knew that not everyone could be saved and that trying just meant there were two funerals instead of one.  But I felt like a hypocrite saying any of this, so I said nothing instead, and Cassie kept talking.  I guess she was trying to distract herself from our predicament or maybe taking refuge in someone else’s bed while a horde of unnatural mice are trying to find a way up is the right time to work through some stuff, I don’t know.

After her roommate vanished, she went a little crazy, she felt.  She couldn't reconcile what she’d seen and what was happening so after it all settled down and everyone just moved on as if her roommate had never existed, she decided she wouldn't think about it anymore.  Everyone else was doing that.  If she played along then maybe she’d be safe.  She stayed out of the rain and pretended not to notice that there were things out in it, things that moved in ways that weren’t human.  

None of this had happened, she’d decided.  None of it existed.  Her roommate had left and that was all.

“It was a pretty poor coping mechanism,” she sniveled, wiping at her face with the back of her hand.

“I don’t know, I think it kept you safe.”

“Yeah.  Safe up until now.”

And we both stared down at the milling hoard covering the floor of the dorm.

“So do you want to get an apartment together for next year?” she asked.  “I know someone that’s got a place right across from campus and they’re graduating this year.  She can introduce us to the landlady.”

“That sounds great.”

We watched the mice for a moment more.  They’d stopped swarming from side to side and were now swirling in the middle of the room.  I felt a sense of dread grip my heart.  Their movements were turning uniform.  There was a circle, perfectly round, of spinning bodies and the mice trapped in the middle of it were blurring, their bodies seeming to meld together into one undulating wave of patchwork fur.

Then it split open.  

Two hollow eyes.

A mouth.

“Hello there,” it said.

My mouth was dry.  It was looking at us.  It was speaking to us.

“What’s the matter?” it chuckled.  “Cat got your tongue?”

Cassie reached over to me and her fingers wrapped around mine.  She squeezed.

“H-have you seen a mouse?” she managed to say.  “It was living in the closet.”

“It has joined us.  It is now one of the Millions.”

There was no difference in its inflection on the word “millions” but somehow, I knew that was a name.  And not one that anyone has given it, either.

I think it named itself.

I’m not sure how I know this.  I just feel it.

“Do you have any food?” they asked.  

Their tone was so polite.  Impeccably so.  Like it was a bother to be asking us and they hoped we’d be ever so kind to consider their request.  The nature of the question, however, made my skin prickle.

“There’s probably some in the mini fridge,” Cassie offered.  “You’re welcome to help yourself to it.”

“Is that yours to give?  I’m not yet desperate enough to *take* what isn’t *given*.”

Hospitality rules.  This creature was following hospitality rules.  And if we, the hosts by proxy, couldn’t supply it with what it was requesting, then there would be consequences.  I felt the loft bed sway as the mice surged around the legs of the bed and I saw their teeth and the starvation in their eyes.  They didn’t care where their next meal came from so long as they were fed in some way.

“Ah, but it is *so* hard to wait,” the Millions sighed.  “We are ever so hungry, you see.”

The mice were swarming around the base of the loft, climbing on top of each other.  A handful had reached the bottom rung of the ladder and the Millions continued to watch us with that obscene face, the empty eyes somehow conveying a spark of malicious cunning.  It knew what it was doing when it asked.  It knew hospitality requested *had* to be fulfilled… and if not, it could be *taken*.

I thought of all those tiny bodies swarming over me, dragging me down into their midst, and then beginning to *eat*.  It would be a horrible way to go.  Thrashing, *drowning*, in all those tiny, ravenous bodies.  I was frozen in place, my mouth dry with fear, at a loss for how we were going to get out of here without being devoured.

Then Cassie solved our problem.

“Hey Josh!” she yelled.  “Can we give your friend here something from the fridge?”

A pause.

“Sure?” he called back weakly from the other side of the door.  “Can I… come in?”

“Not yet!”

The Millions did not need further invitation.  A multitude of mice swarmed over the fridge, prying it open with their tiny paws.  As their bodies separated from the mass I could see more clearly that not all of them were mice.  There were some hamsters, a gerbil or two, and I thought I even saw a snake somewhere in the roiling mass.

Dorm pets.  Escaped or… *rescued*.

The fridge came open.  And the horde descended upon it, piling up on top of each other until we couldn’t see anything underneath the mass of their bodies.  Just a writhing, thrashing mound like a living anthill and all we could hear was the gnashing of tiny teeth.

Then they flowed away.  They returned to the closet and began to climb inside.  The floor was emptying rapidly and the face that had spoken to us so politely was stretching, splitting at the seams.

“Delicious,” it murmured, its voice losing cohesion, the word stuttering like a skipping record.  “We were growing so hungry in there.”

Then the mouth flowed up over the lip of the closet and vanished into the darkness.  The last few stragglers followed it up and the floor was empty.  It was just Cassie and I in the dorm room.

“Look,” she whispered, her voice shaking.

She was pointing in the direction of the mini fridge.  I looked.

The fridge was gone.  Just… *gone*.  They’d eaten the food, the packaging, and the fridge itself.

We climbed down from the bed and opened the door to let Josh in.  We had some bad news, I told him.  There were mice in his closet.  There were *all* the mice and every other pet that had been secretly kept in a dorm room closet throughout campus.  

And they were hungry.

The bait he was leaving in the traps wasn’t enough.  More food, I advised him.  Leave more food in the closet, every day, for the rest of the school year, and then get out and don’t room on campus again.  He nodded anxiously and then asked if we thought his mouse friend was okay.

Yeah, I said.  It was going to be just fine.

I told Cassie and Maria, later, when it was just the two of us, that we might need a new rule.  Cassie’s suggestion was boring so I vetoed it on the grounds that no one would be interested enough to read it and they certainly wouldn’t remember it (you kinda gotta trick people into learning these things, I feel, otherwise you wind up like my professor that makes dinosaurs boring).  Marie’s suggestion was like… an entire paragraph.  So we’re going with my version.

Rule #9 - As tempting as it is, don’t keep a pet hidden in your dorm.  The Millions are always looking for new recruits… and for a new source of meals.  And their appetite is insatiable. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
