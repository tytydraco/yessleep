I had finally purchased a ticket for the train to disco. It was hard. Nearly all of the town's residents want to be on the train, but the tickets cost a kidney (for the small-town residents). Because I had moved here from a hustling city, it only took me a couple of years' worth of savings to purchase this train ticket to disco. Regardless, it is hard to get a ticket because they only allow a dozen or so people every three months. This should have been my first warning. 

Excuse my bad storytelling, I forgot to tell you what disco is in the first place! You only hear about it from scattered conversations across the small town. From no one in particular and everyone at the same time. Conversations across the table in a coffee shop, the bookshop owner behind the counter, faceless voices in the cramped morning bus rides, or perhaps as alcohol-laced whispers in a bar. You have to piece together the information yourself. Whenever I had tried to directly inquire about it, I was always turned away with a pretend-to-not-know look. I even knew a family, an elderly couple, who have been to the disco. But I have never heard them speak about it. It felt like a mirage. Nevertheless, I took the chance and sent a stack of cash requesting a train ticket to disco in a letter to 'Disco 313XX09'. That was it. That was the address. After four months of no response, I had lost hope but then one morning there it was in my letter box! A simple looking envelope addressed to me, with a black ticket to the disco. There was an A4 sized paper of rules and regulations, but only one was listed: to not pack anything. 

Again, excuse my bad storytelling. I was going to describe what disco is. Not from personal experience, of course. This is from all the conversations I've put together to make a whole. Disco is a land of colors, not lights. Of flavors, not smells or tastes. Of amusement and fascination, not entertainment. It has big black and red metal gates, and once you step in, the feelings from what you experience will overpower your senses. But it also has a special train. Hundreds of town residents gather at the station every three months to see it stop and pass. But I'd never heard about what the train itself is like. Nor about how long this journey to and from disco takes. This should've been my second warning. 

The morning had finally come. I reached the station and saw a few lone travelers but mostly couples. We were a group of around fifteen I would say. People had started gathering around the station to see the train to disco. Although the entire train was specially on the tracks only to the disco and back, we never saw anyone enter or leave other compartments of the train. It was a very long train, and the new travelers always entered the last compartment. 

When I entered, I saw that each of us got a special cabin just for ourselves. Even the couples had to sleep separately in their own special cabins each. There was a dining area, and a small library room but all the books only had pictures, abstract graphics, and not one book contained any words in them. Another traveler made a comment about it; something along the lines of 'experiences above concepts journey has started'. The food was always delicious. 

The train to disco had been on the rails for roughly three days when I first felt a kind of restlessness. It wasn't unease. But now the excitement was scattering and giving way to logistical questions like: when exactly will we reach? This was the first time I noticed that there was no staff around: we did not see any chefs, servers, cleaners, or managers. The passageway to the other compartment was shut too. 

After a week, even the travelers started to come out of their cabins only rarely. The couples spent their time apart in their own cabins with a book from the library room. And so did I. These picture books (for lack of a better phrase) were consuming and mesmerizing. The only conversations that my thoughts were a part of was with the pages from these books. 

I was losing track of weeks. I could see the sun go up and down, but I'd stopped counting the days. Finally, I decided to open a small diary and pen they'd given me to write something down. Afterall I am a storyteller and an academic. This should make for an interesting write-up. And then chills went down my spine. I could not put certain things into words. I knew what I wanted to say but couldn't find words to express it. Nouns were a little less foggy, but adjectives were incredibly hard to figure out. But I did write two pages. And I promised myself that I would write at least a page or two every day. 

After watching the sun go up and down what felt like hundreds of times, I had filled up about 40 pages of the notebook. I did not see the other travelers anymore. We all knew that we were there, right next to each others' cabins. But we went out for meals and books only when we knew we wouldn't see each other. This wasn't planned, but we'd started acting in a clockwork. When I tried to look back and read what all I'd written since I began my scribbling ritual in the notebook, it filled me with dread. I could not understand most of what I'd written. I could read it, I knew the words, I understood what they meant. But it was impossible to make sense of them. I started flipping through the pages and I realized that as days passed, I had begun to use doodles and illustrations more than words. The past few pages were just shapes, colors, and abstractions. 

After what felt like forever, the train finally stopped. It was late at night. I don't know what I'd hoped for, but we weren't at disco. The train had stopped right outside the small coastal town we boarded from. I felt a sense of comfort seeing structures I thought I recognized. We all looked at each other when we got off the train; it must have been months since we'd seen each other, living right next to each other. None of us spoke. We just went our separate ways. 

It took me some time to go back to a normal life. It has been six years since I got off the train. Since then, I have not spoken to anyone, I have not written down anything, neither have I been able to sit through an entire novel or a movie. That is because, to me words just...don't make sense anymore. I have the two notebooks I'd filled during my train to disco. They chart out the progression: when concepts stopped translating into words for me. The only thing I live with now are experiences, thoughts, and feelings. But strangely, after fifty or so pages I started drawing disco itself as I'd heard about it: the big black and red gates, colors without lights, flavors without tastes or smells: these things could only happen on paper. Only when I drew things that couldn't be comprehended to mean something, but only felt. Perhaps I will put these notebooks off on auction or make a little museum-library. I don't know. Words are such a mystery.
