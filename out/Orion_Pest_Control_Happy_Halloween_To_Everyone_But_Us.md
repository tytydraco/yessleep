We had all the preparations in place, but I still didn't feel ready when the sun got low in the sky. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)


Crows had been stalking Wes all day, trailing him like a hungry, sentient shadow. Their calls were haunting. It sounded like they were mocking us. 

An hour before sunset, he joined us as we built up the bonfire. In the distance, excited barks could be heard in the woods. The only time Wes reacted to any of the Hunt’s scouts was to nonchalantly flip off one of the crows that got a little too close. The birds merely cackled. 

As someone that has seen what Hunters can do when they're angry, his brashness made me nervous. 

“I wouldn't have done that.” I told him. 

“I figure the more I annoy them, the less likely they are to come after the rest of you.” He explained, eyes shining menacingly at the remaining birds. 

Wes kept watching the sun’s progress in the sky, seemingly eager for it to disappear behind the horizon. Meanwhile, Reyna and Cerri were silent, Reyna's eyes shifting towards the crows surrounding us anxiously. Cerri just wordlessly watched as the lamb that had been donated for this Halloween burned. Victor was also watching the sun’s descent, but unlike Wes, he seemed tense. 

The last of our preparations were completed mere hours before the bonfire, one of them came from Wes, who had shown up with a cutlass. That was unexpected. I didn't realize he knew how to use a sword. 

“It’s not iron, unfortunately,” He informed us, producing a water bottle. “So the plan is to coat it in saltwater. As long as I can break some skin, it should still mess a few of ‘em up.”

Not a bad idea. Not a bad idea at all. 

The other last minute thing was that a few hours ago, the boss handed me a gold necklace, saying, “Don't ask how I got this.”

I stared at him, trying not to smile, “Did a cat wander into a jewelry store?”

I’m sure yinz can guess what face he made. “I told you not to ask. And I'll have it back before they ever realize it's gone, so please try not to lose it.”

I heard Cerri mutter under her breath, “*Cat burglar.*”

So that was that. Presumably, we had all that we needed. Just had to survive until sunrise.

The very moment that the last rays of the sun died, a chorus of howls arose from the woods, making my heart beat faster. That was our cue to part ways. Before doing so, we wished each other luck. I hoped it wouldn't be for the last time. 

Once Wes and Victor departed with their escort of crows following them, I pulled my mask over my face, securing it with the same spiked collar that I'd made for the viscera-eater. My costume was nothing special. Just a burlap scarecrow mask and a thick flannel. Admittedly, the mask was somewhat scratchy, but still more tolerable to me than cheap latex. At least I could breathe in it. And it would at least keep my face and hair covered. 

The next step was to find the Dullahan. Unfortunately, I had no information about where or who it intended to take. However, I did have an educated guess as to where to start. 

Generally speaking, the Neighbors all seem to have a chip on their shoulder when it comes to the ‘burbs, considering that it had been constructed right over where a decent chunk of the forest once stood. There were also more people there for it to hunt than out in farm country. To top it off, far too many of those suburbanites prefer to live in denial about our ‘small town superstitions,’ thus making them easier targets.  

As I drove towards the housing development, I also kept my eye out for any stray crows or dogs. I didn't see any, but with it being dark, spotting those birds would be harder than ever. To say I was becoming increasingly paranoid would be an understatement. 

What can I say? The mechanic cheerfully telling me that he knew my other fake name had shaken me up. Just as he knew it would. 

I reassured myself that I had my hagstone. I had Ratcatcher. And at the very least, I didn't have to worry about Iolo being the one to seek me out. Just had to pray and hope that the White Son of Mist wouldn't decide to wander off after me instead. On that note, I prayed for my coworkers as well. Hoping that they'd beat the odds and find some way to escape the Wild Hunt. 

And just for good measure, I prayed that Gwyn ap Nudd wouldn't be the god that answered me. 

The suburb was lively when I got there. Trick or treat was ending, the cul-de-sac bustling with tired kids following equally exhausted parents to get the last of what was in the homeowners’ candy bowls. Toilet paper hung from the trees of one house, flowing gently in the wind. Clearly, that person didn't get the memo about raisins.

I parked on one of the side streets; with how many people were walking around, I determined it would be quicker on foot. 

After a while, the crowds began to dwindle. Kids cried, some not wanting the night to end, others simply because it was way past their bedtime and every inconvenience felt like the end of the world to them. Soon, I noticed that only a few others were walking around.  

Hooves clopped on the payment. My heart began to beat faster. This was it. 

A little girl’s voice caught my attention, “Wow! Mom, look at that costume!” 

In response, a booming voice announced, “A costume, you say? ‘Tis no disguise, fair maiden!”

*What?!*

I whirled around to see exactly what I feared. What appeared to be a large man clad in shining black armor sat astride a massive black horse. This armor was lined with silver, a crest featuring a horse's head emblazoned on his chest. The rider had no head. Not where it should've been, anyway. 

The Dullahan's head was attached to the saddle by a thick chain, secured right at the bottom of what was left of the Dullahan's neck. To my horror, four more heads rested next to it, their eyes wide open in frozen terror, mouths agape. Blood dripped from their necks. 

The horse pawed at the ground impatiently, snorting and shaking its head as the little girl's excited parent gushed, “That looks so realistic, man! How did you do that?”

“Pon my word, good fellow!” The gargantuan rider replied as he raised the reins to guide the horse forward. “There is no trickery afoot!”

*No. Fucking. Way. It's got to be one of the equestrian people around here, right? There's no way this could be* __the__ *Dullahan. Right?!*

While the rider was distracted, I edged closer with the intent to get a closer look at the head. The skin was loose over its skull, looking as if it was waterlogged. As I got closer, a terrible smell could be detected. Like moldy cheese and rotten meat. 

The Dullahan's dark eyes turned to look at me. When it opened its mouth to speak, I could see that its black gums held sharp, brown teeth.

As the horse walked past me, the head smiled and politely said, “Good evening, scarecrow!” 

*Am I dreaming?* 

“Uh,” I stammered. “Good evening.”

The horse began to quicken its pace into a trot. 

“*Wait!*” I shouted before the Dullahan could disappear, then quickly added. “Please!”

The horse stopped, its rider guiding it to turn so that the side that the head was secured on was facing me. “Yes?”

I'd anticipated for this meeting to go completely differently. I'd thought that I'd be running for my life, at this point. I had no idea how to proceed at all. Despite his knightly mannerisms, there wasn't a doubt in my mind that the Dullahan was dangerous. Those poor souls it had taken could attest to that. 

The Dullahan waited patiently. 

Eventually, I asked, “May I accompany you? This is Wild Hunt territory, after all. I feel rather unsafe walking alone.”

“I could think of no greater dishonor than to leave a frightened thing such as yourself to your fate. Come along! Time is short!”

*What the fuck am I doing?*

I toddled along beside him and his horse, trying my best not to stare directly at the Dullahan’s head. I was only a few feet away, now. Strange. Neither the horse nor its headless rider were reacting to my hagstone. That wasn't promising. 

The sour smell of its head made me gag, though I tried to conceal it. Maggots squirmed around his wide eyes. He didn't seem to mind, only occasionally blinking when they got too obnoxious. They had appeared to have eaten away at his lips and cheeks as well, making his smile look much wider than it should've been. 

My eyes trailed up, noticing that at the rider's hip was a grotesque weapon. A whip appearing to be made out of someone's spine. I didn't want to imagine how it would feel to be flogged by that thing. 

Of course, I would know all too well soon enough. 

Naturally, I was shaking. My throat was tight, partially from fear, partially from trying to suppress nausea. What the *fuck* was I doing?! 

“Madam Scarecrow!” I don't think I've mentioned yet that he practically shouted every word he spoke in his thick Irish accent. I flinched when he addressed me again, “What brings you out at such an hour? And flying solo, no less!”

“I was… I got off of work late.”

The Dullahan then began to ramble about the dangers of traveling alone for a ‘lady such as myself,’ warning me about the desires of men and the even crueler desires of Huntsmen. Meanwhile, I was trying to figure out how to proceed. I had the necklace Vic gave me in my pocket. The head was within reach. 

So did I just… take it? Just like that? It couldn't be that easy. There was *no* way. 

It is said that if someone hears a Dullahan speak their name, they are doomed to be taken by the headless horseman into the underworld. Whatever I had to do, I had to figure it out soon, before he called his next victim’s name. 

“Ah! There we are!” The Dullahan crowed, halting his horse in front of a house. 

*Shit!*

Before he could utter another syllable, I fished the gold chain out of my pocket. 

The great horse shrieked, rearing up on its hind legs. The Dullahan held on, his collection of heads swinging around violently on the chain like a tetherball hit by some aggressive fourth graders. 

In the resources that I'd read about gold being a repellant for the Dullahan, they all made it sound like presenting the headless horseman with the precious metal would simply make him go *poof!* But of course, nothing can ever be that easy. 

His mount continued to rage as his head glared, shouting, **“What is the meaning of this?!”**

I drew Ratcatcher, bringing the blade down on the bit of neck left attached to the Dullahan's head. The head complained as it rolled onto the pavement. 

With only the necklace to separate me from the furious horse and its master, I snatched the Dullahan's head, grimacing as I felt the skin sliding against my fingers. It didn't just have the smell of moldy cheese; the texture of its skin was comparable to it as well. Loose, squishy, lumpy. 

A maggot fell onto my finger and began to wriggle. I yelped and reflexively shook the creepy crawly off. Somehow, I managed to keep a hold of the head, though he *definitely* did not appreciate it. 

 “Unhand me this instant!” he cried.

The now headless Dullahan reached down for the spinal whip, cracking it towards me not even a moment after he had the macabre weapon drawn. I flinched away just in time, even as the sound that weapon made made me tremble. 

If I had moved a millisecond slower, he would've blinded me. Even now, the thunderous *snap* of that whip is **still** ringing in my ears. 

With the head secured in my arms, I began to run, making a beeline towards where my Jeep was parked. Hooves beat on the ground behind me. While he had his steed and I was on foot, there was no way I could outrun him. I was going to have to try to get there first, preferably without joining the ones on his chain. 

Another harsh crack ripped through the air, and I lost my breath as the Dullahan's whip struck me across the back. Tears came to my eyes instantly. Blinking them back, I turned, sword raised just in time to block the whip as it came around again. I could feel blood running down my spine.

Thanks to the adrenaline, the pain was dulled to a moderate sting. Only a 6/10. It feels way worse, now that it's all over. 

With how much of a fight the rider was putting up, it was simply too difficult to try to defend myself and escape at the same time. Because of that, I ended up dropping the head, standing over it to keep the Dullahan from retrieving it. 

I ducked under the whip as it whizzed past me again. The bestial horse was just as involved as its rider, trying to kick or bite me when it could. It nearly got me a few times. Was there some way I could get him off of his mount? Or would the horse just pursue me on its own? It definitely seemed like it would. But it was something to consider. 

I held up the necklace to the Dullahan again. He and the horse shrank away from it. The head let out a tortured groan, apparently able to feel everything that affected the rest of his body. 

Okay. It backed off for a second. *Okay.* Just had to think. The gold worked, but not nearly as effectively as I was hoping. It was like using a squirt gun to put out a dumpster fire. Good Lord, what the fuck was I supposed to do with this thing? 

The whip lashed through the air again. I wasn't quick enough and felt it snap against my shoulder. Better than my chest. The impact made my arm go numb. 

*I'm way out of my league.* 

No. I couldn’t think that way. I had to take care of this. I thrust the chain at the rider and horse again, but more aggressively than last time, the necklace swaying just as violently as the Dullahan's whip. 

The steed, ears back, teeth bared in a snarl, began to take its rider in a circle around me. The Dullahan gathered the length of the whip beneath his arm. I kept the necklace between us, taking care not to stray too far from the head. I wouldn't get another chance to grab it. He couldn't get his head back under *any* circumstances. 

Slowly, I backed up, crouching to bring the necklace closer to the Dullahan's skull. The rider shuddered, the metal of his armor grinding together as he gripped his reins tighter with one hand. 

“If you come any closer, I'll put the chain in your mouth!” I warned, dangling the necklace above the Dullahan's wide, maggot-filled eyes. 

Wordlessly, the Dullahan tugged on the reins. His horse snorted, still showing its teeth to me as if it wanted to drive them into my throat. But thankfully, it obeyed its master's command, stopping, its tail lashing angrily. 

Cautiously, I picked up the head, the Dullahan hissing as the gold drew near to his disgustingly soft skin. I began to wish I'd brought gloves. The urge to wash my hands under scalding water came up quite a few times. 

As I did so, the Dullahan dismounted, the armor of his boots clanging loudly enough to make me jump. Now that he was off of his steed, I could see just how huge this Neighbor was. He towered over me, the armor across his broad shoulders reflecting the streetlights around us. The whip was still under his arm, ready for use. 

The head spoke to me, its voice still outraged as if our fight was just a mere annoyance to it. “There are souls that require harvesting, Madam Scarecrow. And the night will end soon enough. I haven't the time for this!”

For some reason, my customer service voice slipped out, “Sir, I cannot allow you to take anyone else in my operating area.”

I started backing up through the now deserted street, seeing curtains move out of the corner of my eye as people peeked out at us. Every once in a while, I'd hear either an excited or a confused voice from within. I wonder if they thought this was all some impromptu Halloween act. 

“It is peculiar,” The Dullahan mused, his body and vicious steed following me, keeping pace with me perfectly. “I’d recognize the make of that blade anywhere. Yet, you have neither the speed nor the strength befitting a rider of the Wild Hunt. One of their puppets, perhaps. Tell me, Madam Scarecrow, is whatever they've promised you worth the price you will pay?”

“This *is* my price.” I told him. “What I get in return is my life.”

“Ah. I see.” The Dullahan's voice had lightened somewhat. “I sympathize with your plight. Truly, I do. However, there are many that I seek on this night. And once again: time is short.”

Instinct told me to duck. I had no warning before the whip soared through the air, aiming for my chest. Quickly, I shoved the necklace into the Dullahan's mouth, hearing him begin to gag. His body doubled over, grasping at his chest. The horse rushed to him, kneeling low to allow him to pull himself into the saddle. 

I sprinted for the Jeep, not removing the necklace until I got the ignition started. It fell out of the Dullahan's mouth as I peeled out, the head sighing with relief as the golden gag was removed. 

*Okay.* I was moving and I had the head. All of that was well and good. But now what the hell do I do with it? Wait. The bonfire. Would the flames destroy it? Only one way to find out. 

That damn horse was *fast.* Its massive hooves were audible even over the roar of the Jeep's engine. As bizarre as it may sound, when I glanced at the beast in the rearview mirror, small flames had appeared in its flared nostrils. Each time its hooves landed, sparks appeared. 

*Good Lord.* How did Iolo expect me to fight this thing? Either he overestimated me, or he wanted the Dullahan to kill me. Or he's just an asshole. Yeah. That's probably it.  

Not wanting my coworkers to have a terrifying surprise, I called Reyna, “Hey, I got the Dullahan's head and I'm heading your way now.”

“You're coming *here?*” She balked. “Is it that bad?”

The horse and rider were not far behind me, the animal not seeming to tire out despite its death gallop. By that point, I was beginning to feel the damage that the Dullahan's whip had done to my back and shoulder. It made moving my left arm hard. Thankfully, he hadn't gone for my dominant one. To top it off, I hadn't seen anything in our records to indicate that the Dullahan was vulnerable to fire, so this was just a shot in the dark that I hoped would work out in our favor. 

In summary: yeah, it was bad. 

I told Reyna, “Not as terrible as it could be. I could be dead by now. And I did manage to stop him from taking someone else, so that's good. But also, I think it's gonna kick my ass.” 

The head simply watched me as I spoke, maggots squirming down its cheeks like living tears. How could it be so calm about that? I shuddered. 

“If I may, Madam Scarecrow,” The Dullahan began, his well-mannered way of speaking not lessening the chill of his words. “Wherever you intend to take me, I *will* follow. My steed is unrelenting and unfailing, much like myself. I do not say this as a boast, Scarecrow, but as a matter of fact. There is nowhere you may go that I cannot pursue you. Pon my word, if you simply allow me to rejoin my body now, I will give you a much kinder passing than the Huntsmen will.”

While the Dullahan was frightening, he also seemed to be noble, the key word being ‘seemed.’ A relic of the days of knights errant, doomed to ride the night in search of human souls. 

Upon reflection, that must've been why the mechanic wanted him gone so badly. The Dullahan was competition. Even if it was just for one night, Iolo wouldn't tolerate any other beings hunting in his territory. However, at the same time, Orion couldn't turn a blind eye to the Dullahan's business without at least trying to intervene in some regard. No matter what, we would've had to face the headless horseman. 

It's funny. Months ago, taking on a Dullahan would've been far outside of our scope, and to be clear, it still was a monumental task. One that we weren't really suited for. If it weren't for that necklace, I'm fairly confident that I wouldn't be here right now. But only a few short months ago, we wouldn't have been able to do anything more than just try to keep our heads down, stay out of the powerful Neighbor’s way, then do our best to pick up the pieces afterwards.

Yet there I was, using essentially the same tactics on the Dullahan as I do a transformed Housekeeper. Maybe that’s the secret, right there. Start small, work your way up.

After some time and consideration, I replied, “As much as I appreciate your offer, I can't sit idly by as you hurt the people here.”

The Dullahan sighed before saying, “That *is* a pity.”

I didn't like the way he said that. Growing anxious, I glanced back at the rearview mirror. The horse and rider had closed the distance somewhat. Crap. I needed to get at least a few miles on the Dullahan so that my coworkers and I could figure out how to proceed. Feeling the urgency tightening my chest, I put the pedal to the metal. 

In turn, I saw the horse begin to pick up its pace again, the sparks beneath its hooves growing into flames. That gave me a sinking feeling. Would the bonfire do anything to it? Or was I just leading the Dullahan to two more souls it could take?

Vaguely, I heard Reyna ask what was going on. In my nervousness, I’d forgotten that I’d called her.

“Maybe it’s not a good idea to take him there, after all.” I said apprehensively.

“So… what are you going to do then?”

Wait. Was the Dullahan even *closer* now?

No matter what course of action we chose to take, there was one thing that was certain: I had to slow the horse down. 

Bracing myself, I told Reyna to hold on a minute, then stomped on my breaks. 

Tires screeched. The Dullahan’s head flew off of the passenger's seat. A deafening *crunch* as the horse and rider slammed into the back of my vehicle. The horse's face collided with my back window, showering the back seat with broken glass. The rider was launched from his mount, tumbling over the top of my Jeep, bouncing off of the hood and onto the road in front of me. The impact jolted me forward, causing the seat belt to leave an instant bruise across my collarbone. 

I hit the gas again, swerving around the Dullahan's body as he began to stand up. In the mirror, I could see that the horse was having trouble getting off of the ground. It was hard to tell with only my brake lights illuminating the darkness, but one of its front legs looked crooked. The wind howled through my broken window. 

If that wouldn't slow it down, I didn't know what would. 

I could hear Reyna shouted from the other end of the phone, “What happened?! Are you okay?! *Please* say something!”

“Yeah, I'm fine.” I said numbly. “Jeep's another story, though.”

The Dullahan grumbled from the floor, “Interesting choice, Madam Scarecrow. An interesting choice, indeed.”

Meanwhile, Reyna was convincing me to come to the bonfire. She pointed out that with the sacrifice we'd provided, it wasn't an ordinary fire. It could be capable of destroying the head. Besides, my idea of it not being vulnerable to incineration was just a hunch. I didn't have anything concrete to go off of. 

There was no sign of that terrible horse or its rider yet. The Jeep's sacrifice had bought us some time. It couldn't hurt to at least give it a try. 

When I got to the bonfire, I didn't waste any time. I marched over and tossed the Dullahan's head in like a basketball, wiping my hands on my jeans afterwards. I truly can't stress enough how awful that thing felt to the touch. *Ugh.*

The flames merely surrounded him as if they were just as reluctant to touch his repugnant flesh as I was. The head didn't even blink, merely looking inconvenienced. 

No matter how long the Dullahan's head sat in the coals, it refused to burn. 

Cerri, wide-eyed, brows furrowed, whispered, “That's… not good.”

“No,” I agreed as the lump in my throat grew. “No, it is not.”

“Okay, so…” Reyna stammered, “Uh, now what?”

Cerri suggested uneasily, “Do we just kinda play Keep-Away with it until sunrise?”

I glanced at my poor Jeep. The thing was battered to hell and back. It was still driveable (for the moment), but I wasn't sure for how long. Something had begun to leak from it. There was always the company truck, since the Dead Duo had opted to walk in case Cerri or Reyna needed to make a quick getaway. 

Howls rose from the forest, followed by excited yipping. The Cŵn Annwn sounded triumphant. My blood ran cold. 

“That's the second time we've heard that.” Reyna informed me, eyes lowered in worry.  

“It might not be them,” I tried to reassure her, but I was equally as rattled. 

“Did the mechanic say how many others they were going after? Besides Wes?” Cerri asked. 

I shook my head. 

Before I spoke again, I took a deep breath, keeping my voice even for their sake, “We have to focus on the Dullahan. The Dead Duo can handle themselves. I'll take the truck and the head and just… I don't know, drive around town until sunrise and hope he doesn't catch up to me.”

When the Dullahan suddenly spoke, his voice was low and foreboding, “I'm afraid it's far too late for that, Madam Scarecrow.”

Metal clanking together. Reyna screamed. Miraculously, I managed to get between her and the Dullahan's bone whip in time, blocking it with Ratcatcher’s blade. I told them to take the head and start driving while I held off the Dullahan's body. Cerri seemed to be just as disgusted by the texture of the head as I had been, lips curled in revulsion as she carried it to the truck after fishing it out of the fire.

Even with the bonfire's light, it was hard to tell if that monstrous horse was nearby. I hadn't heard hooves. 

Reyna told Cerri to go, insisting that she wanted to stay behind in case I needed help. She had the Squelcher with her as well as a crowbar that she retrieved from the truck. I was about to protest, but had to dive away from the Dullahan's whip again, then roll as he brought it back the other way. Even without his mount, he had a lot of reach with that weapon. Far more than I had with Ratcatcher. 

The truck rumbled to life, then peeled out. I'd expected the Dullahan to react to losing his head once again, but he was entirely focused on trying to flog me to death. 

At first, Reyna and I remained on opposite sides of the horseman, just trying to stay out of reach of that brutal whip. He swung in wide circles as he slowly navigated around the bonfire, trying to locate us without either his horse or his eyes to guide him. 

Reyna let out a squeak as the whip lashed dangerously close to her, her eyes wide as she shakily held the crowbar in front of her. I got low, darting for the Dullahan's back. With a grunt, I drove the sword down into his stump of a neck, hoping it would do something. 

Spoiler alert: it didn't. The Dullahan turned and clocked me right in the temple with an armored fist. The world spun. My ears were ringing. 

**Great. *More* head trauma.**
 
Hands under my arms. Reyna was dragging me away, screaming as the whip missed us by only inches. 

Ratcatcher’s hilt stuck out from the stump of the Dullahan's neck like a bizarrely small, narrow head. I clumsily got to my feet, clutching Reyna's shoulder for balance as we avoided that damned whip once again. 

I'm not sure how long this dance lasted with the headless Neighbor. It felt like forever. 

At one point, Reyna choked out, “The sky.” 

I risked a glance towards the horizon. The sky was getting brighter, a green halo appearing in the east to announce the sun's impending arrival. 

We didn't have to kill the Dullahan. Hell, I don't think anyone at Orion was even capable of such a feat. We just had to survive until sunrise. This wasn't his world anymore. Once the sun came up, he'd have to return to the Mounds. 

I asked Reyna to hand me the crowbar. She obliged, keeping near me as the Dullahan took slow, menacing steps towards where he'd last approximated our location to be. 

One thing for sure was that I needed to get Ratcatcher back. For one it's *my* sword. For another, I'm pretty sure Iolo would rip me in two if anything ever happened to it. 

Unexpectedly, the Dullahan dropped into a kneel, rolling his whip up and placing it onto the loop in his belt, resting his metal-clad hands on his knee courteously.

Reyna and I both froze. What the hell was happening?

Hold on, was that ska music? I raised an eyebrow at Reyna. 

“Oh! That's my phone.” She said with a nervous chuckle, flushing with embarrassment as she then quietly added, “I forgot that I made that my ringtone.” 

The Dullahan didn't move, remaining on his knee. Reyna backed away as she answered it, announcing that it was ‘our coworker,’ not wanting to say Cerri's name in case something was listening. She put it on loudspeaker. 

Cerri said from the other line, “Hey, uh, the Dullahan wants to talk to you.”

*What?*

There was some rustling as she presumably set the phone next to his head. 

His booming voice was **way** too loud over the phone. Cerri, thankfully, must have moved it further away from him since the volume gradually became more tolerable, “I must admit that I underestimated you, Madam Scarecrow. You and your accomplices have put me through great pains on this night. But alas, the sun is nigh. I ask that you return my head so that I may make my journey homeward.”

Reyna and I glanced at each other. The Dullahan was surrendering? That seemed… off. 

Skeptical, I replied, “We will return your head on the condition that you do not harvest any more souls on your way back, including ours.” 

The Dullahan sighed, then begrudgingly agreed. “Very well. The ones I've taken already will suffice, for now.” 

As much as I didn't like the idea of turning him loose to wreak havoc somewhere else, I hadn't a clue what else to do with him. The necklace clearly bothered him, but it wasn't capable of stopping him completely. Would keeping the head and body separated kill him like it did the viscera-sucker? 

As I deliberated, the Dullahan interrupted my internal battle, “I fear that I know what you may be considering. Do not be foolish enough to believe that you would be the first to attempt it. If you allow the sun to rise, I will not perish. Merely, my steed and I will disappear, yet my head will remain. It shall be your responsibility until I come to collect it next Hallow’s Eve. Is that what you want?”

My mind conjured up images of that head sitting in the Orion office like a macabre paperweight, eternally shedding its maggot tears. No. That is not what I wanted at all. That is not what *anyone* wants. 

That being said, I still don't know if I made the right choice. God, I hope I did. 

Hesitantly, I answered, “Okay. My colleague will bring you.”

After taking the phone back, Cerri informed us that the horse had been chasing her most of the night, but thankfully, it had stopped trying to destroy the truck. It was just following her. That was a good sign. She told us that she was going to turn around and head back our way, then hung up. 

Carefully, I approached the Dullahan's kneeling form, crowbar in hand in case he tried anything. He let me get close, not moving a muscle. I reluctantly reached out to grasp Ratcatcher’s hilt. The Dullahan didn't even flinch. 

I tried to be gentle as I pulled, but the blade didn't budge. *Shit.* I tried again. The sword still didn't move. 

When the Dullahan's arm rose, I danced away, ready to defend myself, but he simply reached up and pulled the sword out of his neck with one effortless tug. He then set it on the ground beside him before resting his hands upon his knee once again. 

Gingerly, I picked Ratcatcher up, then slowly backed away from the headless Neighbor, reluctant to take my eyes off of him for even a second despite his apparent surrender. 

Reyna and I watched him while we waited for Cerri to return. For a long time, neither of us were able to find the words to speak. The Dullahan didn't move an inch the entire time. 

She eventually broke the silence, commenting, “It's been a while since I heard the hounds. I can't tell if that's a good or a bad thing.”

She was right. The forest had been quiet for hours. No dogs. No crows. And no word from the Dead Duo. 

“I think it's a good thing.” I eventually told her. “Means they haven't been caught.”

At least, I hoped that was the case.

Hooves. The horse trotted alongside the company truck, the sparks coming from its nostrils shrinking down to mere embers. It nodded at us, ears pricked, as if in greeting. Dreadful animal. 

The Dullahan rose slowly to his full height the instant I handed him back his head. 

He showed off his sharp teeth as he grinned, telling me, “A wise choice, Madam Scarecrow.”

Was he going to retaliate? I clutched the golden necklace tighter, ready to use it against him again if I had to. 

Instead, the Dullahan ambled past me, cradling his head in both hands. He gently screwed the chain back in to secure the head to his saddle before mounting the horse. He gave us another unnerving smile and a salute before riding off to race the sun. 

For a moment, the three of us stood in stunned silence. None of us could process what had just occurred. 

“We actually did it.” I whispered in disbelief. “We drove off the Dullahan.”

My body seemed to realize that it was safe at the same time as my mind did. I collapsed next to the fire, my adrenaline abruptly wearing off. My back and shoulders stung, the pain intensifying in time with my heartbeat. 

Reyna seized the first aid kit from the truck, telling me to stay sitting so that she could check my injuries out. The flogging cuts hurt more when exposed to the open air, making me clench my teeth as Reyna examined them. 

“They're not deep,” She assured me, then grimaced as she added, “*Oof,* they look like they hurt.”

As she tended to them, taking her time cleaning and dressing the wounds, we waited anxiously for the Dead Duo. Listened for hounds. Kept an eye out for crows. 

The sky is getting lighter. We're still waiting.
