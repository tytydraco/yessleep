I’ve worked here at reception for about 4 years now.

I was here through the pandemic and had the whole place to myself more or less. Now the students are back and the whole place feels alive again. 

It’s a design and business school so the people-watching is curated and impeccable.

The building inside is a bit sterile, very grey and white. 

The outside though is totally different. It’s an old brick building with jaunty gargoyles and flying buttresses. I always loved walking up from the train and pretending I’m going into some palace. 

It’s right on the water and it’s super secluded, except for the Nivea factory down the street. Sometimes it smells like lotion.   


Here are some weird things that have happened in the past, but it's starting to get weirder:

&#x200B;

1. A few years back, right before the lockdown, I came to work early around 8 am.   
My colleague David was standing outside which was odd. The school was unlocked and he could have gone right in. He’s a ginger like me was looking a little more green than usual. 

His hands were shoved in his pockets and he was white-eyed and staring at the water. His lids were peeled back and he looked like he was gonna hurl. I’ve never seen his mouth so thin or his face so sweaty. 

Apparently, they had just fished a body out of the canal across the street. 

He saw the whole thing. He also puked in the bushes. Poor guy, he’s a real sweetheart and also a gigantic man. I gave him a hug and poor thing was trembling so hard. 

Ok so that was weird and it was the talk of the school for a few days. I’m happy I didn’t arrive earlier…well that’s not entirely true.

 I love horror. I kinda wish I’d seen it.

2. We have a storage cellar in the basement. The school used to be a Harley Davidson factory and there are still some old artifacts left in there.

I have found:

\- An old motor glove that was really wet for some reason

\- Loose press on fingernails

A fishing rod 

\- A Taxidermied owl 

Apparently, the owl was a prank from a former student and it just lives down there now. It’s not cute, it’s mid-flight, too thin and the eyes are judgy.

&#x200B;

3. To get to the cellar you have to go through a super long basement hallway riddled with leaky pipes and dingy lighting. 

It’s always dirty but in a way, you can’t really pinpoint. Except for this one spot on the wall where the pipes leak out red gunk. It’s not blood but it’s also not-not creepy. 

It just kinda feels like if you’re down there without a purpose it might swallow you up.

I always run on my way back up to reception. 

&#x200B;

4. I heard whistling in the basement maze one time. It freaked me out so much. There are other storage units down there and it could have been someone else. 

But dang it made my pits sweat so quick.

&#x200B;

5. Things are left wide open or appear on my desk after I’ve put them away. This is not that weird because I’m forgetful but it’s like I’m extra forgetful here at work. Maybe it’s the early morning or long hours or horrible lighting but cabinets are left open that I swear I closed.

&#x200B;

6. There’s an interior door that leads from a shared hallway into the lobby. You need a key card to get in. 

Sometimes people get stuck on the other side and start to panic. 

They start knocking really fast and I have to get up and go open the door for them. 

Sometimes they’re really pale like the blood’s run out of them or they’ve been there for years. I’ve had to hug a student before. 

Their eyes were wild and kind of lifeless. 

They were sweaty like they were being chased but they just said that they felt like they’d never get back to the other side and freaked out. Students and guest lecturers alike are pretty shaken when I open the door for them, it’s sweet to see the relief on their face when I welcome them back inside.

Occasionally I hear what sounds like knocking and go to open the door but no one is on the other side. There are hundreds of explanations for this so I didn’t start to care about it until recently.

&#x200B;

**Current weird shit:**

I got into the school this morning and said hi to Cagan the handsy retired guy who locks and unlocks the school. He’s sweet he just needed some reinforced boundaries. And also to not flirt with his co-workers. 

I look young and am often mistaken for a student but I fully work here and am older than I seem. 

The school occasionally smells like lotion but today it smelled like pond water almost. Kind of seaweedy and boggy. 

Also a bit humid. 

I mentioned it to Cagan although I didn’t know how to say “pond ass stank” in German and just said it smells like old water and he kinda shrugged and said my outfit looked “hübsch”. 

I mean it does but ya’ll can’t a person just look cute without predatory compliments?

&#x200B;

The smell dissipated after a while. That’s around the time students started trickling in. I said “Morning!” about 50 times before students started using the bathroom down the hall on the other side of the door. 

They all knocked super frantically, as they do, so I usually open the door nice and slow to calm them a bit and let them back in. 

Sometimes a dropped chair or a bonked shoe sounds the same so I’ll walk over to the door to no one is there. 

For the last few hours, I thought I’d been hearing just one big knock that was for sure coming from the door. I’m sure it was that one because the door has a hollow echo to it. 

It just started getting cold out (early November) but this is an interior door so I have no idea why the handle is so icy. 

Every time I’ll open it a crack, see no one, and close it again but each time I leave it I get super dizzy. 

By the time I’m back to my desk I’m fine again but a few minutes later the knock is back. I’m getting annoyed and little sick. 

The pond smell is back also. It’s reminding me of this story by u/ViciousMock called Knock Kock and I’m a little nervous that I’ve kept answering to door so much. At least I didn’t open it all the way.

My co-worker just arrived and he doesn’t smell the pond smell. Not sure what’s going on but as I write this the Knock went off again. One big heavy one. I’m not going back over there, my hand is blue and there's a door handle imprint on it now. I’m getting really cold, too. 

Also a little damp.

I’ll update if there’s anything to share. For now I’m going to put on an album kinda quiet and read some nosleeps to calm me. Or…well maybe that’s a bad idea.
