I didn’t believe in rituals. I’d grown up with horror movies and sleepover dares and a healthy skepticism that made me roll my eyes at most things marketed as “ancient.” The Midnight Game sounded like the same tired recipe: rules, theatrics, a high chance of embarrassment. 

It was late, I was alone, and I wanted to prove something to myself—that I could stare at nonsense and not be scared. That’s how arrogance starts. That’s how mistakes are made.

I read the rules twice before I started, and then I read them again because they read like someone who expected you to die if you skimmed. 

Cover every reflective surface. 

No electronics. 

New candles only, and matches—only matches, no lighters. 

A wooden front door. Salt you can pour. 

Three thirty-three a.m. is the finish line. 

Don’t open the refrigerator. 

Don’t fall asleep. 

Don’t stand still. 

Don’t use someone else’s blood. 

If the candle goes out, you’ve got ten seconds to relight it, and if you fail, you pour a circle of salt around yourself while turning—you don’t set the circle and step into it. 

Everything was very specific and quietly terrifying in a way that made me take the checklist seriously for the first time in my life.

I did most of it right. I covered the bathroom mirror and the tiny hallway portrait with towels. I closed the curtains and pushed shiny bowls into the back of the pantry. I set out a sandwich and an apple on a paper plate so I wouldn’t have to open anything mid-game. 

My front door was wood—old, warbled, the kind of door that creaks in the wind—and I slid the paper with my full name behind it like the rules said. I pricked my finger with the tiny sterilized pin, wiped the red drop on the paper with a concentrated kind of ceremony that felt absurd and intimate, then held the match in a hand that was suddenly not steady.

Everything felt theatrical until the last knock. Twenty-two, counted out like a joke that suddenly wasn’t funny. The final rap landed exactly as the minute changed, and I was absurdly proud of myself for being precise, for not hesitating. 

I opened the door, blew the candle out the way the instructions said, closed the door, and relit the candle to “officially” start the game. The wick smoked a little like the breath of something waking. It smelled faintly of vanilla and something older underneath it, like dark wood.

I’d told myself I wasn’t going to keep checking the clock; the rules said nothing about looking at time in that phrasing, but the list was long and the notion of not tracking time felt like part of the dare. Still, it’s human to measure things. 

I paced. I walked. I kept the candle up, stubbornly moving from room to room, deciding not to stand in a place long enough to be comfortable. For the first hour it felt like a novelty. 

The house sounded the way it always did at midnight—the pipes, the heater, the settling of wood—except every small noise made my throat tighten like cold air was in my chest.

At 12:05 the candle went out.

It didn’t sputter. It just vanished. The matchbox I had leaned against the sugar jar was on the counter beside me, and my hand went to it before my brain remembered anything about rules and matches and how the book had been adamant about not using a lighter. I couldn’t find the matches. 

Panicked, I dug into the drawer and found one open pack but the striker was worn down and the matches barely sparked. 

For whatever reason—sleep, adrenaline, thoughtlessness—I reached for the small butane lighter buried beneath a stack of receipts. It was instant: a quick puff of blue, a flash, and the flame was in my hand. I relit the candle, and the room relaxed like a held breath released.

That was the rule I broke.

The rules had said matches only. They had said do not use any other light source in place of a candle. It wasn’t dramatic in the moment. It barely registered as a moral failing. 

It was a tiny pragmatic decision to get a candle back in the wick before ten seconds were up. But ritual rules don’t care about pragmatism. They care about form. They care about obedience. In my case, they wanted an offering performed the way it was written.

The rest of the night went sideways. The candle light was thinner, somehow—a thread of yellow stretched over a dark I hadn’t seen before. The hallway at the edge of my vision hummed with a presence that made the hairs under my collar stand up like a row of tiny soldiers. 

Footsteps walked in the other room, bare and slow, and something leaned close enough to feel like a person’s breath across the back of my neck. I moved like the rules told me to: keep walking, don’t panic, don’t run. The ten-second rule didn’t give me time to think. That lighter in my hand felt like a bargain I’d made without reading the fine print.

When 3:33 rolled around, if I’d hoped for reprieve, it was only a merciful absence—the pressure eased, the footsteps faltered, and the house felt momentarily mine again. 

I didn’t sleep that morning; I sat on the couch watching dawn like it was an arrival party. I told myself it didn’t mean anything. That I’d been dramatic. That superstition is a clever thing that feeds on your nerves and then tells you you were right all along.

By noon my hands were still shaking. I called Marcus because he’s never less than twenty minutes away with rational explanations and a ridiculous supply of confidence. 

He listened, skeptical but curious. Tom texted in a few minutes and said he was in if Marcus was. They were there by eight, two sober men with their own brand of bravado: Marcus with lists, Tom with comic relief that covers the places he doesn’t want to think about.

They stepped into my house and the air changed. You don’t notice a place going wrong so much as you feel it like a bruise—where everything is the same but deeper. 

Marcus stopped in the doorway and looked around with a journalist’s instinct, cataloguing offhand: towels over mirrors, curtains closed, the sandwich still slightly dewy on the plate. 

Tom walked the perimeter like he was checking for traps, making a joke about “home renovation chic,” but neither of them laughed properly. Marcus asked, carefully, if I’d used a lighter when the candle went out. I told him it had been a matchbox and that I’d found another pack and struck them, fingers fumbling the story as if smoothing fabric.

They decided to stay. Not because I’d convinced them, but because both of them had always been the kind to refuse to leave a friend alone when something felt off with them. The real kind of friends.

We fortified ourselves with coffee and tried to keep the joke going, played loud music, tried to anchor daylight. We turned our phones off as the rules suggested—again, for solidarity, not because we believed the specifics—and sat waiting as midnight edged closer.

At 12:00 we did a mock check: a cautious laugh, a poke at the antique clock in the hallway, a ridiculous pact that we would get through it. I kept a candle in my hand simply because the rules demanded motion, and because the little bit of wax at the base felt like a charm. 

At 12:05 the candle we’d lit together burst into flame on its own wick. Not a match, not a spark—like a muscle contracting without a brain. The flame bent, reached, and leaned toward the hallway as if being inhaled by something waiting there.

The house cooled so fast Marcus’s breath fogged. The three of us moved as one at first: keep moving, don’t stop. The footsteps started from the hall and multiplied, coming from corners that made no sense. They weren’t clumsy or careless. They were precise and curious and very much aware of our presence. 

We huddled, ridiculous and real. Tom’s hand found my shoulder without either of us choosing it. Marcus laughed once, a thin, incredulous sound, then began to whisper questions like a litany to keep his mind occupied—did we check the oven? Did we turn off the breaker? Did we cover the mirrors properly?

That’s when the lights in the kitchen buzzed and died, not just turned off but extinguished as if light itself had been shoved into a pocket. Our phones when we tried them showed static at first and then blank blackness. 

The matches in the pack I’d told Marcus I’d used earlier were all gone when he checked, swallowed like they’d never existed. In the darkness the candle bent away from the window and toward the shadowed hallway. The smell in the room changed—not rotten, not floral, something older that made each breath taste like pennies.

We didn’t see the Midnight Man. We never saw a face. We felt him like weather. Something brushed past Tom’s cheek with cold and wet fingers; he reeled and fell back into the sofa with a yell that turned into exasperated breaths. 

Marcus grabbed at air and staggered, swearing he felt teeth against his palm. I felt a pressure on my left shoulder, a cold handprint that blossomed beneath the skin into a rose of bruises, tendriled and impossibly precise.

The rules had warned about being touched; they’d said touch meant interest and interest meant escalation. We should have been prepared. We should have known what to do.

We did nothing perfectly.

Tom tried to stand and run—the rule against running was the one that felt the stupidest at the moment, a meaningless detail in the face of panic—and a force collapsed around his knees so hard he fell into the rug. 

Marcus, a man who always keeps lists, fumbled his pocket for something metallic, a necklace he never takes off. The book had said metal could be protective, but it also warned that carrying weapons was a terrible idea because you’d do something foolish with them. 

Marcus clutched his chain and a cut burned into the back of his hand as if something had dragged a blade without leaving a nick.

When the candle went out, which it did because rules are a dangerous joke to try to bend, the darkness wasn’t a lack of light. It was a thing that swallowed the space. We had ten seconds—the instruction said ten—and I felt those seconds as a rubber band snapping taut between the three of us. 

Panic made time slow or speed up; I couldn’t tell. I fumbled for the match pack, found one and struck it, but the flame was dim and cold. Tom, in a structure of instinct I’ll replay in my head forever, grabbed for salt. 

He’d raked it into a shaky perimeter with a coffee mug as we’d been told: pour, don’t set the line and step in. He poured and turned, but he whispered for me to give him an object to keep the circle contiguous. I handed him the candle because it was the only thing I could find and the one move felt like reason.

We were sloppy with the salt. We were slow. The Midnight Game is a ceremony for people who can hold their hands steady when everything in a room is trying to make them drop their matches. 

When the thing reached for the circle, it didn’t break skin or drag us into shadow. It did worse: it traced along the saltline without crossing it, like a predator tasting glass, and the sound it made wasn’t noise—it was a terrible, wet whisper that sounded like my mother’s voice folded into my own. 

Marcus’s eyes rolled back. His mouth foamed with red. Tom screamed and screamed in a voice that slowly died and started to sound like an animal more than a man. 

When it stopped, we were all shaking, all bleeding from tiny cuts that had not been there before, the salt dusted like snow across our shoes.

In the morning, with sunlight doing work the rules said it always does, we catalogued ourselves. Tom’s arms were lined with small, red grooves like something had traced along them with a wire. 

Marcus’s knuckles had turned a bruised black and purple in patterns that made my stomach drop; his left thumb had a crescent impression sunk into it as if somebody had pressed a ring too hard. My shoulder had that handprint, a perfect, ink-dark bruise with thin, long fingers. We had no pride, only the sensation of being used and left with the souvenir.

We tried to be reasonable. Marcus argued for the locksmith, for tape on the windows, for someone to come stay the night in shifts. Tom wanted to talk about leaving the house entirely, about selling it, about moving across the country. I wanted someone to say this was over and be believed, to have a man with a clipboard note my symptoms and tell me it was a mass hysteria event. 

But the marks didn’t fit any reasonable pattern. We had scars that looked ceremonial, not accidental. The pattern on my shoulder wasn’t random bruising. It was a hand with fingers like ribs, a spiral in the palm that seemed to dip deeper with every sunset.

Marcus stopped sleeping. Tom stopped answering texts most days. The three of us agreed to never speak of who had used the lighter. That omission became a fossil between us—something we all knew but could not touch without breaking. 

We played at normalcy and failed, because the house doesn’t care if you fix the lawn or repaint the trim. When the candlelight skittered on the mantle at 12:05 like breath finding a match, the house would remember.

Two months later, Marcus shows up at my door at three in the morning with a bag packed. He stood on the porch and tells me in a voice that’s gone brittle, “You have to destroy the paper.” In the book, burning the blooded name at 3:33 is how you end it, how you declare you are free. 

The paper had been behind the door. I’d burned it once, or so I thought, with the tiny wax-split matches that survived. Marcus insisted the marks had spread because I hadn’t burned it correctly. Tom called me from last place he’d slept and said he kept hearing feet pacing the hallway at night like someone waiting for a turn.

We tried to do it the way the rules said. We tried to be exact and humble and ceremonial. We gathered matches we’d never used and set the name on a saucer and held a candle above it while the house leaned in. 

The flame licked the paper and for a second there was an exhale like a voice leaving a room. Then the candle went out. The paper didn’t burn all the way. It blackened at the edges and curled like a moth wing. Tom’s hand shook so hard he spilled all the salt.

We failed again.

There’s a line in the rules that I only read properly the third time I opened the book with my knees knocking. 

It’s small and almost academic in phrasing, like a footnote left by a tired librarian: do not use a lighter. do not use someone else’s blood. do not step into salt. do not let the Midnight Man touch you. Under it, written in a different hand, someone had circled the last sentence and scrawled once acknowledged, it acknowledges back.

Acknowledged how? By thinking about it? By realizing you’d used the wrong flame? By whispering its name?

I don’t know. I only know that tonight, at 12:05, I woke up to the smell of pennies and old wood and the sound of slow, wet footsteps at the foot of my bed. Tom’s voice was a whisper in my ear like he was in the room; he’d hung up after the first ring and never answered again. 

Marcus’s messages come in at alarming hours: pictures of his hands, of spiraled bruises on his palms, notes that say it followed us and then nothing.

The lighter sits in my junk drawer where I left it. Sometimes I open the drawer because I’m stupid enough to believe that touching the thing will make me feel like I’m back in control. It never does. The flame never comes to my fingertips without consequence.

Three of us broke something. One of us used a lighter and let form be more important than instruction. One of us tried to protect the others. One of us called in the rational world and watched it fail to catch us. The Midnight Game is not about killing; it’s about bookkeeping. It records the ways you use light and how you hand over your name. We handed ours over.

The bruise on my shoulder has grown into a spiral that looks, at certain angles, like a mouth. When I shower I can feel the ridge of it under my palm, like a secret embedded in flesh. Marcus refuses to come inside and sends photographs that make me sick. Tom stopped sleeping in his own house and now answers at two in the morning with a voice like glass and says, “It sat in the kitchen all day. It watched me cook and then it watched me eat.”

I don’t know how to fix this. There may be nowhere to fix it. The rules are simple enough to copy, and they are mean enough that they expect to be followed exactly. They are brutal in their grace: the smallest deviation is the one that matters. The lighter was a tiny convenience and it became a contract I didn’t read.

If you find this and you feel clever and skeptical and tempted to test the edges of superstition, do not use a lighter. Do not take shortcuts. Follow the list like your life’s in the margins—because maybe that’s exactly what it is.

We learned our lesson too late. We learned it with bruises that bloom like ink and voices that fold into our sleep. Tonight, the hallway light hums even when it’s off, and sometimes I wake up to the feeling of something standing at the foot of my bed and breathing out the incandescent smell of matches.

If you play the Midnight Game at all, play with matches. If you don’t have matches, don’t play. If you play and the candle goes out, pour your salt correctly. If you fail any of that, don’t expect to be offered mercy.

And if you see a handprint forming on your skin like a shadow is taking shape, don’t call Marcus or Tom. Don’t let them see it. They won’t be the same afterward. Neither of us are.

We keep telling ourselves to leave. One of us left. One of us kept coming back. One of us called at three in the morning and said only, “It remembers my name.”

Sometimes I whisper it back because acknowledgment seems worse than silence. Sometimes I think that’s exactly how it wants it.
If you can, learn from our idiocy. If you can’t, may whatever you think protects you be better than our matches were.
