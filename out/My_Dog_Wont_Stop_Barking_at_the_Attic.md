I live alone in a house that I inherited from my grandmother. It’s an old place, a bit run-down, but it’s been in the family for generations. When I moved in a few months ago, I thought it would just need some updating—a fresh coat of paint, new furniture. I didn’t expect anything… strange.

I have a dog, a border collie named Michelle. She’s usually calm, smart, and well-behaved, but lately, she’s been acting weird. At first, I thought she was just adjusting to the new place. But then it started happening *every night*—Michelle would sit in the hallway, staring at the attic door, barking like crazy.

I brushed it off at first. Dogs bark at all sorts of things, right? Maybe she heard something outside or smelled a stray cat. But her barking… it’s different. It’s desperate, like she’s scared or trying to warn me about something.

A few weeks ago, I decided to check the attic myself. I figured there might be squirrels or raccoons nesting up there, making noise at night. I grabbed a flashlight, pulled down the attic ladder, and climbed up.

The air was thick with dust, and the wooden beams creaked under my weight. There were a few old boxes, some furniture covered in sheets, and cobwebs everywhere. Nothing out of the ordinary. I did a quick sweep with the flashlight and didn’t find anything unusual—no signs of animals, no noise, nothing.

Satisfied that it was just Michelle being paranoid, I climbed back down and closed the attic. But that didn’t stop her from barking.

Every night, like clockwork, she’d sit there, growling and barking at the attic door. She’d refuse to leave, no matter how much I tried to pull her away. Her eyes would stay fixed on the door, ears flat, body tense.

Then, about a week ago, something changed.

It was around 2 AM, and Michelle was at it again, barking like her life depended on it. I was exhausted, so I grabbed her leash and figured I’d take her outside for a walk, hoping it would calm her down. But as I got closer to the attic door, I noticed something strange.

There was a faint scratching sound. It was so soft that I almost didn’t hear it over Michelle’s barking, but it was there. I froze, my hand halfway to the leash. The scratching came again, this time a little louder, like something was scraping against the wood.

I backed away slowly, my heart racing, and took Michelle outside. The fresh air helped me clear my head, but I couldn’t shake the sound from my mind. When we got back inside, Michelle was calmer, but she kept glancing at the attic door.

That night, I didn’t sleep.

The scratching became a regular thing, every night around 2 AM. It would start softly, just a faint scraping noise, but over time it got louder. It didn’t sound like an animal anymore. It sounded like… something trying to get out.

Two nights ago, I decided to record it. I set up my phone in the hallway and hit record, then went back to bed, hoping to catch the sound. When I checked the footage the next morning, my heart dropped.

Michelle was sitting in front of the attic door, like usual, barking and growling. But as the scratching started, something else happened. The attic door began to shake—just slightly at first, then more violently. It was subtle, like someone was gently pushing against it from the other side. And then, just as quickly as it started, it stopped.

Michelle backed away, her barking turning into whines. Her tail was between her legs, and she was staring at the door, trembling. But what really got to me… what made my blood run cold… was the last few seconds of the video.

Just as Michelle turned to run, *something* moved.

It was hard to see at first—just a dark shape near the top of the door. But as I kept watching, I saw it more clearly. A hand—pale, too long, and wrong—slipped through the crack in the attic door. It wasn’t human.

It was just there for a moment, reaching out as if testing the air. Then, it slid back through the crack and disappeared.

I sat there, staring at the screen, trying to make sense of what I had just seen.

I haven’t been able to bring myself to look at the footage again. I don’t know what that thing was or what it wants. I don’t even know if I’m going to stay in this house much longer.

Michelle still won’t stop barking at the attic. And tonight… the scratching is louder than ever.
