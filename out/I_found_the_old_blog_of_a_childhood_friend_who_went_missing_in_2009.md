Jim was an aspiring writer. He often told me that every great storyteller opens with a setup and closes with a punchline. Well, I’m not a writer, so don’t expect big things from me. I’m going to tell this tale as simply as possible.

I read Jim’s blog, and it frightened me. Three posts from a best friend who went missing 15 years ago. I found them yesterday. It was the anniversary of his disappearance, which seemed like the perfect day on which to nostalgically peruse our old conversations. He used to send me flurries of memes and hyperlinks. I didn’t always read every message. And, somehow, I managed to overlook something essential from 2009. A link lost within Jim’s final manic influx of messages.

His private blog.

***Entry 1 – July 6******^(th)******, 2009***

*I just saw my next-door neighbour kill his wife.*

*That shouldn’t excite me, should it? But it does, and I’ll tell you why. Miss Benson frequently says that I’m a talented writer. But what use is a bright spark never seen? I need to make a mark on this fast-moving, forgetful world. And writers are remembered for stories, not words.*

*Now, I’m only 17 years old. I haven’t lived, so I haven’t had stories to tell. But I’ve written. Written prolifically. Written until my eyes and hands have hurt. I know how to write. I just haven’t known what to write.*

*Until today.*

*This blog may well be my magnum opus. My finest piece of literature. Don’t care for my pretension? I don’t care for your dismissal. You’ll soon see what I see. This tale is a masterpiece. Not for its prose, but its story. I finally have a story.*

*I would like to preface the tale by clarifying that I wasn’t snooping. I happened upon this bold scene. That’s all. I’m not interested, in the slightest, about the lives of Mr and Mrs Ackhurst. Well, I wasn’t interested. That changed four hours ago.*

*Isn’t it strange that the slightest happening can fundamentally alter the trajectory of human history? If Gareth weren’t so bad at GTA, maybe I wouldn’t have rage-quit. Maybe I wouldn’t have left my room to prepare a pre-midnight feast in the kitchen.*

*And maybe I wouldn’t have looked out of the window.*

*I wouldn’t have seen Mr Ackhurst standing in the upstairs bathroom, smiling as he feverishly fed the shower-head into his wife’s throat. With a spare hand, he spun the tap, increasing the water-flow. Rapidly pumping his wife full of liquid like a flesh balloon.*

*I am ashamed to confess that I didn’t save the woman. I could’ve done so. At any moment. But I didn’t. Fear may have driven me into cowardice, perhaps. May have frozen me.*

*By the time I woke from that terrible trance, it was all over. Mr Ackhurst sighed, unburdening himself of the tense knot in his stomach, before basking in his awful triumph. The imposing man reeled in the shower hose, removing the blood-stained shower head from his wife’s throat. He cradled her body, eyeing her discoloured skin and swollen, lifeless eyes. Then the spent man dragged her rag-doll form out of the room.*

*It would’ve been responsible to immediately call the police. I wasn’t frozen, after all. I could’ve moved. I could’ve picked up my phone and dialled 999. But if I’d done that, my story would’ve ended there. Mr Ackhurst’s story would’ve ended there. And I never would’ve become a writer. Not in the truest sense of the word. Not in any way that would cement my legacy, which is the only thing that matters, at the end of the day.*

*I did not alert the authorities, and I won’t until I’ve visited the house.*

I felt a little sick after reading that initial post. I thought back to 2009, remembering the unfortunate passing of Mrs Ackhurst. Remembering the ambulance that arrived in the night, stirring everybody in the neighbourhood. But I wasn’t aware of Jim’s involvement in the night’s horrible events, and I’ve barely begun to tell you about all of the awfulness that happened.

The first unsettling thing worth mentioning is that the ambulance arrived on July 8^(th), but Jim’s initial post was on July 6^(th). I’m reading the old conversation with my friend as I speak. July 8^(th). That was when we messaged each other about the ruckus on our street. Mrs Ackhurst was definitely found on that date, which means Jim knew of her murder two days before anyone else.

And there was more horror to come. Horror that he never thought to tell me in person. He never even asked whether I read the private blog.

After reading the other posts, I’m glad he didn’t.

***Entry 2 – July 7******^(th)******, 2009***

*It is three in the morning. Four hours after I first locked eyes with the maniacal man in the window across the road. It feels as if it has been an age since I uploaded the last post. I keep thinking about Gareth. Are you reading this, friend? How long has passed? You’re sleeping soundly in your bed right now, no doubt. Possibly ignoring my messages, as usual.*

*You’re only a five-minute walk away from this nightmare. Five minutes.*

*Sneaking out of the house, without detection, was no impressive feat. Not really. I didn’t even bother to cover my tracks. Mum and Dad are absent even when they’re home. I know my friends pity me. Pity my loveless makers. But I wouldn’t have it any other way. I would’ve never forgiven those monsters if they’d stopped me from crossing the road. Entering the Ackhurst house.*

*Allowing my greatest story to unfold.*

*As I approached the Ackhurst residence, I noticed that there were no lights in the property. My heart raced a little, as I considered the possibility that Mr Ackhurst had spotted me peeping, but I stilled myself. I knew that Mr Ackhurst hadn’t looked over at the property. Hadn’t seen me watching from the kitchen.*

*I decided that he must’ve turned off the lights to clean up without detection. He possibly realised that he’d been foolish for not drawing the curtains. Not turning off the lights in the first place. Perhaps he’d struck his wife in a fit of passion. Hadn’t taken the time to properly plan his kill.*

*Alternatively, I considered that he may have been sleeping soundly. He may have felt absolutely nothing about what he’s done. May have been sleeping like a baby.*

*I sailed around the edge of the property, moving on nimble feet with a gleeful grin on my face. Gleefully anticipating the my moment of heroism, I should clarify. There was nothing about the night’s events to be celebrated. I was simply dreaming sweet dreams of capturing Mr Ackhurst. Becoming known as the courageous young man who’d brought a killer to justice. A vigilante with not only a story to tell, but the capacity to tell it well.*

*I was relieved to find that the side door already had a shattered window. There was no need to find a stealthy route of entry. No need to worry about being detected. I slid the door open, toed a heavy rock off the mat, and entered the lightless home.*

*Fear gripped me as I heard panicked movement upstairs. Creaking floorboards and a muffled voice. The patter of frantic footsteps travelled along the upstairs corridor, and then came the descending thuds of stairs groaning under the weight of the homeowner.*

“*Mr Ackhurst!” I called. “It’s over.”*

*The monster and I met in the dark entryway of his home. He eyed me fearfully, wondering why he’d been disturbed. Wondering why the intruder was a 17-year-old boy, no doubt. Youth was the greatest mask I had. We’re verging on adulthood, Gareth. People will stop giving us leeway, sooner or later.*

“*Jim?” The man cried. “What are you doing in my house?”*

*I did not falter for a moment. Couldn’t afford to falter, when faced with a man taller and stronger than me. I had to focus on the plan. Had to beat him with the strength of my mind, not my body. I would walk out of that cursed graveyard with his decapitated head in my hands if necessary.*

*The upstairs tap was running. I remember that. It was the only sound in the lightless house. I’d caught the man off-guard, and that was the only advantage I had. With every passing second, that advantage was slipping away.*

*The sound of running water drowned the crime. A terrible truth with such awful weight that I prayed it would sink far from view. Though I could not resist, Gareth. Could not resist telling you. Such a legacy doesn’t deserve to be buried.*

*The man barrelled forwards, and I held firm, rigidly sticking to the plan. Whatever my fate, I was determined to be remembered.*

*I am no moron, of course. I did not enter the pitiful man’s hovel without a weapon to wield. I pulled the stainless steel from my pocket as Mr Ackhurst charged towards me, watery eyes emblazoned with something. A feeling I did not or, perhaps, could not place. For his mind was a mystery to me. The emotion may have been fury, perhaps. A fearful fury.*

*Those tears multiplied and cascaded when my blade punctured his abdomen. I barely even moved the blade. Mr Ackhurst did a fine job of moving into it. And the lobby was so dark that the man had clearly not detected any glint of a steel edge. No foreboding sign of his impending doom.*

*As his mouth opened, I twisted the knife, gutting him in a rushed attempt to prevent any retaliation. Repeated thrusts and turns of my blade quickly quelled any ideas he may have had. The man fought meekly, placing one hand on my neck in a meagre attempt to muster a loose grip as the life quickly fleeted his body.*

*And then the house was silent.*

*I could’ve been more meticulous. Could’ve chosen a better instrument. A better way to attack. But I survived.*

*It was over.*

The story was strange, and not in a way that intrigued me. That was my first thought. I was terrified for a reason that seemed just out of grasp. But after an hour or so of repeatedly reading the second entry, I finally came to a conclusion.

Jim, at the very least, wasn’t telling the *whole* truth.

And even after what I read in the final post, the whole truth is something I’m still trying to ascertain. I have more haunting questions than answers.

***Entry 3 – July 8******^(th)******, 2009***

*Hello, Gareth.*

*You should know, by now, that I made this blog for you. Only you. I hope that, upon finishing my disturbing tale, you put it in the hands of those who might know what to do with it. Some day. I really do pray you read it. I’m sure you will.*

*Today, I finally alerted the authorities. A moment that should’ve been exhilarating, ruined by a terrifying development.*

*It’s currently one in the morning, and I’m packing my bags. I must leave. It isn’t safe for me here.*

*You see, I failed. I didn’t cover my tracks. I didn’t eliminate the threat.*

*I was a little off at school yesterday. You noticed that. You may be awful at responding to messages, but you're a good friend, Gareth. A very good friend. I’ve always known that. And it’s why I’ll never forget you. I do wish I could stay. Wish I could explain everything. But he’s here. That’s my fault. I was incredibly sloppy, and my heroic antics may have all been for naught.*

*The man’s brother visited.*

*I came home from school, preparing to finally alert the police and tell them my brave story. But then I saw it. The car on the driveway. A blue Porsche that I didn’t recognise. I immediately panicked, of course, because I hadn’t finished the clean-up, and the scene in the house didn’t exactly look paint me in a favourable light.*

*I rushed across the road. Had to be quick. Had to tidy up my mess before Mum and Dad came home. I beelined towards the side door, which was still a broken mess, swinging in the breeze. And there was a wailing voice emanating from the main hallway.*

*I know. I know. Why did I leave the body there in the early hours of yesterday morning? Well, I was interrupted. Don’t think less of me for my stupidity, Gareth. Please. I was meticulous in every other regard. The Ackhursts didn’t have friends or visitors. I thought it’d be safe to leave them there until the following evening. It was a foolish decision, but that doesn’t make me a foolish man.*

*I realised, upon entering the home, that I had very few options. Few reasonable options, I mean. What could I have done? Killed Mr Ackhurst’s brother too? He was an innocent man. That wouldn’t have painted me in a heroic light. And I accepted that as his eyes met mine.*

*That was when I realised I had to run.*

*I’m on the road as I type, Gareth. Jotting down my final thoughts. The conclusion to my frustratingly brief tale. I had hoped for a satisfying conclusion, but life sought to rewrite my story. How rude of it.*

*The authorities have been notified, but I won’t be there to tell the tale in person. Still, a hero does not act for glory. A hero is altruistic. That is how legacies are formed, right?*

*And my legacy, whatever it may be, shall be eternal.*

You may think very little of those three posts. Without any context, I suppose the only horror to be gleaned from Jim’s writings would be the deaths of Mr and Mrs Ackhurst. But I think, even without context, that you likely feel what I feel.

*Something doesn’t add up.*

You'd be right.

Terror worked its way into my gut as I processed everything I’d read, comparing it with the events that I remembered from my childhood.

The bodies of Jeffrey Ackhurst and Patricia Ackhurst were found in their home on July 8^(th), 2009. Town gossip, thanks to a few blabbermouth police officers, brought the finer details to light. Jeffrey’s corpse was found in the entryway, as Jim had claimed. Patricia’s corpse was found in the bathroom, also as he claimed.

However, there is another piece of information worth noting. I thought it better for you to read Jim’s three posts first. The police have always suspected Jeffrey’s brother, Rudy Ackhurst, to be the killer of the couple. And what led them to this working explanation?

Jeffrey's time of death was estimated to be an hour *before* Patricia’s time of death.

I kept thinking about that as I read Jim’s disjointed account of events. Thought about how it didn’t make sense that my friend would've been able to describe how Jeffrey felt whilst killing his wife. Thought, more importantly, about how it didn't make sense that Jim would've been able to see Mr Ackhurst kill Mrs Ackhurst. Jim was telling the truth in his second entry. He did kill Mr Ackhurst. I have no doubt about that. But my friend couldn’t have seen Patricia die in the upstairs bathroom because her husband was already dead.

And if Jim weren’t avenging the woman, why on Earth did he savagely slaughter Jeffrey Ackhurst?

I think I know. We all know, don’t we? But I don’t want to accept it. Just as I don’t want to accept who really killed Patricia Ackhurst. For years, it was believed that Rudy Ackhurst had killed his brother and sister-in-law, before kidnapping or murdering Jim Harlow, for whatever reason. But it’s clear that we’ve been believing a lie.

I thought about the closing sentence in Entry 3. The punchline, as my friend would call it.

*And my legacy, whatever it may be, shall be eternal.*

Jim was right. Given what he’s done, he will be remembered.

I gave this evidence to the police, and they’ve reopened the case. The town is alive with talk of the Ackhursts once more. I thought that telling the authorities would have put an end to this nightmare, other than the thoughts which plague my mind, but I saw something this morning. A figure watching me from a local bus stop.

One who looked, to my eyes, like an older version of Jim Harlow.

That could be paranoia, but I’m not so sure. The more I think about my old childhood friend, the more I remember the oddities I overlooked for years, and the more ferocious the terror in my body becomes. I keep imagining awful scenarios. Him turning up at my door. Returning to silence me. And, given the man’s creativity, he would certainly fabricate another wonderful tale about how I’d met my end.
