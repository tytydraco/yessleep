This is the second part of me recounting my jobs I had to do for Horus. Check out part one. 
Thank you everyone for the support it helps a lot.

After the Necronomicon incident, the book was swiftly sealed away in a vault where Horus kept such dangerous artifacts. The black van sped away from the chaotic scene, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction. I barely registered the ride to the hospital, my thoughts clouded by the physical pain and the heavy weight of what I had just encountered.

The next few weeks were a blur of sterile hospital rooms, whispered conversations about my miraculous survival, and the lingering sting of cracked ribs and a fractured collarbone. Doctors prodded and poked, ensuring I hadn’t suffered any internal damage. As I lay in the hospital bed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been left unfinished, that the darkness I had fought was not entirely vanquished.

Eventually, I was cleared to leave, though the bruises and soreness served as constant reminders of my encounter with the Necronomicon. I was eager to get back to work, despite the warnings from my doctors. Small jobs began trickling in from Horus—mundane tasks that barely required my full attention. I was restless, craving something more significant, something that would challenge the skills I had honed over years of studying alchemy and the occult.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the world was bathed in the soft glow of twilight, I received a call from Horus. Another exorcism, they said, just another routine job. An old nun at a secluded convent had been possessed, and I was to handle it quickly and quietly. It seemed straightforward enough, the kind of job I could do in my sleep.

When I arrived at the convent, the atmosphere was thick with an unnatural stillness. The air was cold, biting, and the shadows seemed to stretch unnaturally long across the stone walls. The nun, Sister Agnes, was bound to her bed in a small, dimly lit room. Her frail body trembled under the weight of whatever malevolent force had taken hold of her. The candles flickered, casting eerie shadows that danced across her contorted face.

I prepared my tools—a collection of herbs, sigils, and alchemical concoctions—laying them out on a small wooden table beside her. The air grew heavier, and a sense of foreboding settled in my chest. As I began the exorcism, reciting the incantations that had been passed down through centuries of occult practice, the nun’s eyes snapped open. They were pitch black, voids of nothingness that seemed to swallow the light around them.

A low, guttural laugh echoed from her throat, a sound that reverberated off the stone walls and sent a shiver down my spine. It wasn’t Sister Agnes laughing—it was the demon within her, mocking me.

“Do you think you can banish me, little alchemist?” the voice rasped, dripping with malice.

I ignored the taunt, focusing on the ritual. But before I could finish the incantation, the nun’s body jerked violently, her muscles straining against the bindings. The laugh grew louder, more maniacal, as if the demon found my efforts amusing.

And then, in a moment of horrifying clarity, I felt it—a sudden, invisible force pulling tight, like a rope yanked taut. There was a sickening snap, and Sister Agnes’s head twisted sharply to the side, her neck broken in an instant. The life drained from her eyes, leaving only the hollow gaze of death. The room fell silent, save for the fading echo of the demon’s laughter as it departed from her lifeless body.

I stood there, frozen, the weight of what had just happened settling heavily on my shoulders. This was no ordinary demon, and this was no ordinary exorcism. Something dark and powerful had been at play, and it had just slipped through my fingers.

But as the nun’s broken body lay still, I couldn’t help but feel that this was only the beginning—a warning of something far more sinister lurking on the horizon. Little did I know that this seemingly insignificant job would tie into a much larger, darker tapestry of events, leading me deeper into the abyss than I had ever dared to venture.
