Guys I need help. I don't know what to do.

It started last week. I kept finding hair in my teeth. Yes, I know it's disgusting. I have a dog, so sometimes I get his fur in my mouth...this is not the same. At first I thought it was mine - but it's too long to be mine. It's also too dark.

On Thursday it was one hair. It was stuck in between my teeth. I painstakingly pulled it out (it was very long, and black). This was weird because I have no idea where it could have come from. I don't hang out with anyone that has long, black hair. (The only person I can think of is this homeless woman that bumped into me on my way to work that morning. She made me spill my coffee, so I was pretty pissed. I don't often raise my voice at strangers, but I think this was warranted. Now I didn't have a coffee for my morning at work, and I also had a huge stain on my pink dress that I had to sit with all day).

Friday there was more. I kept having to go to the bathroom at work to look at what was irritating my mouth. I ended up pulling 3 hairs out from between my teeth that day. I thought maybe it was something I ate. I don't know how that could explain this strange experience though. I sit by the window of my office building and I SWEAR I saw that same homeless woman (at least I think it was her). Whoever it was, they were looking up at me with a creepy smile. I can just picture her greasy, long hair and her crooked teeth. I wish my city would do something about the homeless population. Put them in a shelter out of sight or something.

This past weekend it got worse. I was pulling hair out of my THROAT. It felt like it was stuck back there. I had to use a tissue to get a good grip on it, and I had to tug fairly hard in order for it to dislodge. These were not just individual pieces of hair like the past few days...I haven't eaten anything since, I'm too grossed out. Where is this coming from??? 

It's getting worse. Today I pulled a big clump of long, black hair from my throat. It took me awhile to get a good grip on it as I had to reach pretty far back into my mouth. As I gagged repeatedly, it just kept coming in big, long, slimy chunks. This is the most I have gotten at once. I tried to get as much as I could, but I can't seem to get enough to stop the feeling of more in my throat.

This is getting really hard to handle. The clumps keep coming. At times I am choking and gagging with hair literally hanging out of my mouth in wet, goopy strands.

I didn't want to, but I just used my phone's flashlight and looked in my mouth in the mirror. I don't know how to explain what I saw. There is definitely more hair, but I also saw something else.

It looks like an eye.

What do I do?
