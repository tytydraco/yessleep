Coming to work after the attack on Rachel was difficult. The entire atmosphere of the clinic had changed. Wilson felt horrible about being unable to protect Rachel from the crazed patient, Rachel was inconsolable after the attack on her and took to wearing a face mask to cover most of it. And Dr. Harrison wasn’t much better after I had walked in on him muttering to himself and murdering the patient who had attacked Rachel. What was strange in all of this was that Dr. Harrison continued to act as if I hadn’t seen him doing it. 

I know that he does these things, and I willingly choose to forget them just so I can continue to collect my paycheck and go home, but actually to see him doing it and then just going on as if nothing happened was unsettling. The next day, he came up to my desk with a big bouquet of flowers. A giant one with roses, daisies, and other flowers. I thought that they might have been for Rachel, but then he told them they were for me. And he didn’t stop. Every day since then, he’s brought me more and more flowers. Some of them with boxes of chocolates or with teddy bears, some enclosed in glass to keep them forever fresh. 

“I’m going to develop a pollen allergy.” I sighed as I tried to find space for his latest bouquet. I usually took them home and just left them until they wilted, or even gave them to random couples I came across on my walk home from work. But during working hours, I had to suffer with them around me. I don’t hate flowers, but this many of them were an assault on my nostrils and my eyesight from how bright and vibrant they were. 

After finally finding space on my desk to place this latest bouquet, I looked up and noticed Wilson staring down at me with a little pout. He looked like a big dog after he had been scolded for peeing on the carpet or something. It was always hard to remind myself that Wilson wasn’t a real person. He was some strange creation that Dr. Harrison had created to be our security guard, and could easily at any time turn into a horrible blob monster. And yet it was impossible not to love him. After our first meeting and his reformation into a human shape, he’d taken on a more Security guard-like appearance. With muscles and a taller stance, it seemed like he could change his appearance whenever he wanted. 

“What’s the matter, Wilson? Are you still upset about not being able to protect Rachel?” I asked him, reaching a hand out to touch his face to comfort him. While he looked human and his skin looked like skin, once you touched it, it felt like pottery clay. I felt that if I pushed deep enough on his skin, I’d leave behind subtle impressions of my fingerprints. 

He nodded in response to my question and looked at me with his sad, greyish-green eyes. “I want to apologize to her, but she won’t talk to me.” He sighed and looked over at the flowers around me. “Maybe if I give her one of those?” he asked, lifting his head from my hand and looking at the flowers. “Do you know which ones she likes?” he asked me, carefully touching one of the roses with his hands. 

“Well, I can try and ask her,” I told him, smiling as I watched him interact with the flower. It reminded me that I don't think Wilson ever left the clinic. The time when he was keeping people outside from entering was the first time I’d ever seen him leave. So I was left to wonder where exactly he would even go to get whatever flower Rachel wanted. 

“Thank you, Maggie,” he said with a smile, and he gently patted the rose he had been touching like it was a dog and returned to his post by the door. As if on cue, after he’d returned to his post, Rachel came through the door. Watching her walk into work now was soul-crushing. She was hunched over and shuffling like some kind of zombie or undead corpse. Like she’d lost all the will to do anything at all. 

“Hey, Rachel?” I called out to her. She turned her head to look at me, a face mask firmly on her face. She shuffled over to my reception desk and pulled the mask down a little. Once she did, I was able to see that the stitches that had been there for the past few days had been removed by Dr. Harrison and that now only a long and angry scar remained. 

“What?” she asked me. Not even a comment on my weight or anything, this was serious. Her voice was defeated and beaten down. It was a miracle that she was even able to drag herself into work nowadays. I couldn’t imagine how Dr. Harrison could even be using her as his nurse. 

“Well, I was just wondering what your favorite flower is. All these flowers have me in that sort of headspace.” I told her with a smile, turning on the approachable charm that usually made people open up to me. Rachel looked at me before tearing her blue eyes off of me to look at the flowers around me. 

“Why? Not like he’s going to bring me any.” She sighed, turning to leave my desk. I looked over at Wilson and saw that he was panicking a little. I had to think of something quick. 

“He actually is. He just doesn’t know what flowers you enjoy, that’s all.” I figured that even if she didn’t fully believe me, if there was even a chance of Dr. Harrison giving her some flowers, she’d at least tell me. She stopped and looked back at me. She didn’t believe me, but finally she shrugged her shoulders. 

“White lilies.” Was her response before she left to join Dr. Harrison in the back of the clinic to begin work. I looked over at Wilson and gave him a thumbs-up. He gave me one, and I could tell he was happy with the outcome. The rest of the day continued as it usually did. Wilson took special care with the patients now, and even before any of them thought of laying a hand on me, they had Wilson practically breathing down their neck. 

Once lunch finally rolled around, I stretched in my chair and let out a soft yawn. The rush had died down, and as such, it was the perfect opportunity for me to go and get lunch. Standing up from my chair, I was about to go and tell Dr. Harrison that I was going to go to lunch. As I turned around, however, he was already standing behind me with a big tooth grin on his face. 

“Oh! Hello, Dr. Harrison. I was just about to tell you that I was leaving.” I told him, feeling my heart leap out of my chest in shock. “Do you want your usual?” 

“Yes, thank you so much, Maggie.” He told me, his smile wide and his eyes shining so bright I thought I’d go blind by staring at them for too long. I shielded myself with my hand before quickly grabbing my bag from behind me. As I turned to leave, though, he asked me something. “Are you going to meet Philip again?” 

“Most likely,” I told him, Philip was always working around this time, so it would be logical that I would see him again. I thought back to walking in on Dr. Harrison murdering the patient so violently and listening to his mutterings as he did so. He’d gotten upset upon learning that Philip and I enjoyed flirting with each other. “Is that a problem, sir?” I asked him. 

“No, not at all,” he said, “I was simply wondering, was all.” He laughed it off, his eye twitching like crazy as he did so. “Enjoy your lunch, Maggie!” He waved me goodbye as I left the reception area. Why did he care so much? We weren’t dating. I was practically forced to work here with him because he couldn’t handle me quitting on him. So why was he making such a big deal over me flirting with someone? 

I waited in my car for a moment, my eyes firmly towards the clinic, wondering if Dr. Harrison was staring back at me from behind one of the windows. After a few more minutes, I started up my car and drove to the coffee shop. Arriving there and entering the shop, I was immediately calmed by the smell of the freshly ground coffee and the lovely classical music that the shop played over its loudspeakers. 

“Hey, Mags,” Philip said with a smile as I approached the counter. He was already getting my order ready. I smiled back at him and started to fish through my bag for my wallet. And then I noticed that my wallet was missing. I started to panic slightly. Had I dropped it at the office? Or on the way here? But when I felt bread crumbs at the bottom of my purse again, I let out a deep and annoyed sigh. I had to stop leaving my bag on the floor. 

“I’m really sorry, Phil. I left my wallet at the clinic.” I told him, turning to go and exit the shop. I figured I was going to have to hurry back and try and bargain my wallet back from the lost and found bread thief. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that. This one's on the house.” He told me, still making my latte and smiling at me. I stopped and turned to look at him. “Just keep this between me and you.” He said with a wink and a smile as he turned to pour Dr. Harrison’s cup of black coffee. I smiled and walked back over to the counter, noticing that, for once, there was a muffin available among the options of pastries. 

“Can you also spot me that muffin? I never get to have one of those.” I pointed to the muffin that was tantalizingly sitting in the display case. Philip nodded and placed my drinks on the counter, before picking up his tongs and getting the muffin for me, and placing it in the bag. “Thank you so much, Phil. I owe you one.” I told him as I took my order from him. 

“I wouldn’t mind going to lunch sometime with you,” he told me as he leaned on the counter and smiled at me. I looked at him and felt my face get warmer. This was the first time a guy had ever asked me to go on a date with him. I thought back to what Dr. Harrison had asked me and what I had seen him doing to a patient. But this is my life, and I make the decisions. 

“I would love to, Philip,” I told him with a smile. Turning to leave, I was suddenly scared out of my shoes upon seeing Dr. Harrison standing outside the window of the coffee shop with his face pressed against the glass. The anger on his face was palpable, and I was worried that he’d break the glass with how hard he had his hands pressed against the glass. I quickly hurried outside of the shop and over to him. 

“What are you doing here?!” I asked him, pushing him away from the glass before Philip could notice him glaring into the coffee shop. “You have a surgery you’re supposed to be doing!” He stared at me with rage in his eyes as he looked down on me. 

“Is that him?” he asked, motioning towards the coffee shop. “What did he say to you?” He narrowed his eyes at me, and they began to shine brightly, and my head began to throb. He was trying to control me again. I shook my head and quickly shoved his drink into his chest, hoping that some of the scalding liquid would spill on him, 

“No, he doesn’t work today.” I lied to him, hoping to protect Philip. And glad that this time he hadn’t written on either of the cups. “And even if it was, why would you care if it was?” He took the coffee from me and stared at me. 

“Because you’re mine! You belong to me, Maggie!” he shouted. I looked back at the coffee shop and was glad that Philip was helping another customer. I scoffed at Dr. Harrison, wishing that both of my hands weren’t preoccupied with holding things so that I could smack him. 

“I don’t belong to you, James! Just because I agreed to continue working for you, does not mean that I belong to you.” I turned to leave, and as I did, I felt him reach out a grab my arm. He dug his nails into my soft skin, and I let out a pained yelp. “If you don’t let go of me, I swear to God I’ll call Mr. Sinclair,” I warned him. That got him to let go of me quickly. I didn’t bother turning around to look at him and just continued back to my car. I sat in it and slammed the door shut behind me. 

I didn’t want to go back to work, in fact, those same thoughts of quitting bubbled back to the surface. But one thing is keeping me working here. The money. And not because of how well it pays. The reason I’m staying for the money is to help my parents. My dad was in a car accident that left him quadriplegic and sent my parents into a spiraling amount of medical debt. I send them a vast majority of the money I earn from this hellhole. And for my family, I’ll do anything, even deal with Dr. Harrison. 

So after reminding myself of why I’m doing this in the first place, I started the drive back to the clinic. Arriving back at the clinic and finding it functioning normally, I sat back at my reception desk and quickly found my wallet on the floor. Looking through it, I was glad to see that everything was there. The bread creature must’ve been disappointed not to find anything shiny and had abandoned it. Dr. Harrison arrived soon after I got situated and wordlessly walked past me back to the surgery he’d abandoned. 

 

The rest of the day went by as normal. I finished the paperwork I had to do and looked over at Wilson, who smiled back at me and waved. I waved back at him and filed away the last of my paperwork. I looked up at the schedule and saw that Dr. Harrison and Rachel would be doing a facial reconstruction. Those usually took the rest of the day, and since closing time was quickly approaching, I decided to just head home early. The less time I had around Dr. Harrison, the better. 

I said goodbye to Wilson and went off to the parking lot, making sure that the bread creature hadn’t taken anything from my purse or my person. Once I confirmed that I had everything, I sat in my car and lay back in my chair. Just as I was about to leave and start my car, I heard my ringtone. I groaned, anticipating that it was probably Dr. Harrison again. But to my immense relief and joy, I saw that it was my mom calling me. 

“Hi, Momma!” I answered excitedly. I have always had a very close relationship with my parents and my mom in particular. I confided almost everything to her, except, of course, what was happening at the clinic, and she did the same with me. 

“Hey, Maggie! I just called to check on you, and to thank you again for helping out with your dad.” She sounded tired. It made sense, as she was my dad’s full-time caretaker now. But mom never complained about it, since she loved my dad more than anything on Earth. 

“Of course, Momma. It was never an option not to help you guys out.” I told her as I placed my phone on the dashboard mount and started the car up. “So you received that payment I sent?” I asked her, pulling out of the parking lot and starting on the route home. 

“We did! Thanks to you, we won’t have to decide between your dad’s therapy or eating.” She sounded like she was joking, but I knew full well that their finances were that bad. My parents never wanted me to worry about them, even after my dad’s accident, but I could tell just how deep in debt they were. From bills past due and in collections, to the fact that I had to stop people from repossessing their car. They’re stubborn and seldom ask for help even when they so desperately need it. 

“Oh, don’t joke like that, Momma. Otherwise, I’m gonna end my lease and move back in to help you guys.” I warned her, which quickly got her to apologize. We talked as I drove back to my apartment. As I was walking to my mailbox and inserting the key to open it, still talking with her, I noticed that the lock had been broken on it. 

“Maggie? Did you hear what I said, sweetheart?” My mom asked as I opened my mail locker and saw that someone had gone through it. Letters were opened and their contents were spilled out. Someone had gone through my mail. 

“Let me call you back, Momma. I love you.” I blew her some kisses from my end and received some from her end. Hanging up on her and placing my phone back in my purse, I quickly grabbed the letters and started looking through them. Most of them were just bills and junk mail, and I was glad that my bank hadn’t sent me anything that day. 

I grabbed all my open mail and closed my mailbox, determined to call my landlord, and if he didn’t answer, then the police. I don’t live in the nicest apartment complex but this was the first time that someone had gone through my mail, and it pissed me off. Walking up to my apartment and inserting the key into the lock, my heart froze in my chest when I saw that it wasn’t locked. And even worse, the door simply pushed open when I tested to see if the door was truly locked. 

Someone had been in my house. Without even thinking, I quickly entered it and pulled the pepper spray out of my bag. I only had one thing on my mind, barging into an apartment that might still have had an intruder in it. My dog. 

“Sonny?!” I called out to him, worried sick and praying that nothing had happened to him. And to my immense relief, my little corgi came waddling out to greet me in the pink sweater that I had knitted for him. “Oh, thank God.” I sighed, getting on my knees to scoop him up into my arms. He seemed perfectly fine and unaffected by whatever stranger had broken into my home. That wasn’t much of a surprise, unfortunately, as Sonny is the friendliest dog ever and makes for a terrible guard dog. 

As I examined my apartment, Sonny and pepper spray held firmly in both of my arms, it became apparent that nothing had been stolen. I didn’t exactly have many valuables, besides the many pictures of me and my family. After ensuring that nobody was there, I placed Sonny back on the floor and went about getting him and myself some food. 

After I poured out his food and refilled his water, I walked over to the fridge and opened it. I then let out a scream and quickly slammed it closed. I covered my mouth and ran to the toilet to quickly vomit up my lunch. After I had finished and washed my mouth out, I stared back at the fridge. I walked over to it and opened it again. 

There in the middle of my fridge were two bleeding masses of flesh left behind in my fridge. Along with that was an envelope leaning against them. I reached out and quickly took the envelope, thankful that I grabbed a corner with no blood on it. I opened the card and quickly read it. 

“You leave me breathless.” I stared at the card and then at my fridge. It was very clear what those two organs were. And even clearer who had sent them. I crumpled the card angrily in my hands and tossed it to the ground. Dr. James Harrison had messed with the wrong girl.
