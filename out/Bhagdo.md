What follows is the questioning and story of 8 year old Brian Kane regarding a girl called Marisa, and her friend Bhagdo. Detective Dunbar of the Yachats Oregon police department is in charge of the questioning, he says it may have some relation to another case he worked on.

Dunbar: Hi Brian, how are you today?

Brian: I’m doing good detective.

Dunbar: I hear you may have a story to tell us today? Is that right?

Brian: Yeah.

*long silence*

Dunbar: Okay, how about you start with Marisa. Who is she and how did you meet her? What does she look like?

Brian: We met Marisa at the playground in the commons park. She had bright clothes on and really dark hair. I don’t think she liked the Sun very much either. Her hair was always blocking her head from it.

Dunbar: Was she nice? Scary?

Brian: No. At first my friends were scared by her but she would always come play with us everyday after school. She always came out of the woods but mom said not to go into those woods because there are bears and wolves and things.

Dunbar: Wolves and bears are pretty scary huh? Alright now what about this Bhagdo? I hear he was Marisa’s friend?

Brian: Yeah but we didn’t meet him for a while.

Dunbar: How come?

Brian: Marisa says he is very shy.

Dunbar: What about the night you met Bhagdo? Can you tell me about that?

Brian: Last Friday me and my friends were playing in the playground later than our parents probably wanted. The Sun was about to go down and we were about to leave but Marisa came out of the woods. We stayed to play with her for a while and when it was really dark she asked if Bhagdo could come play. We were all having so much fun we all said yes. Marisa ran into the woods and looked very excited. She came back out after a while and was holding a hand whose arm went above her head. Bhagdo was crouching but still a couple of Marisas tall. He had a very fat body with a thin oval for a head. He had two big red eyes kind of like a fly. He looked at me, but not really at me. He was looking at something past me but through me. Then all of a sudden something grabbed me. A shadow man with one eye like a cyclops came out of the ground and was trying to take me away. Everyone started yelling. Bhagdo picked me up and put me away from the shadow and with his other hand, grabbed the shadow man and a big mouth on Bhagdo’s body opened up. He put the shadow man in the mouth and started trying to push everyone behind him. Other shadow men tried grabbing other kids but Bhagdo ate every last one of them. We all ran away before we saw what happened to Marisa and Bhagdo but now our parents won’t let us back to the park.

Dunbar: Alright thank you for telling us your story Brian, I know it must be pretty scary thinking about that.

Brian: Not really. I know Bhagdo will protect me if I’m ever in danger.

Dunbar: Yeah. Yeah maybe he will.
