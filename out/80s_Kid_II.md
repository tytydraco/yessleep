*Two weeks later*

Remember what I said about Blaine? It was all true.

He was so sweet. Always thinking about me. Telling me how beautiful I looked in Grandma's heirloom jade necklace. How it accented my black eyes, my languid and deep black pools that my strong, aquiline nose separated so elegantly. The same nose I was now looking down with what felt like a very disappointed and disgusted expression on my now wet face. And then? Then, I heard that voice again.

*"HANDS FILTHY!"*

I am not going to lie. I didn't like my makeup fucked with. Especially by errant shower water from tardy people. That's my face and only I get to decide when it goes on or comes off; not your wayward shower spray! Not some loser klutz whose ignorant about the perils of-

Sorry. I'm getting ahead of myself again.

Did you know that most accidents happen in the house? I think I heard that once before.

Anyway, when I discovered Blaine on the floor of the tub, barely breathing, with some kind of sputum bubbling up from his mouth and down his chin while the shower water made pink spirals around the drain; I knew something was wrong. Really wrong.

"You not wash, right!" I heard myself scold. Only the voice was not mine.

I turned off the shower and surveyed the situation. Blaine was still breathing though it was very shallow and raspy. I took a handful of his gorgeous locks and lifted his head off the slippery, with soap scum, porcelain surface. The claws feet in our ancient Brooklyn apartment's tub seemed to show off their talons, like an angry wolverine, before quickly retracting back into claws feet.

I shook my head. Fucking SSRIs were fucking with me again. Felt like little micro-explosions in my brain.

I said in a voice not my own, "Grandma told you! You don't need psychiatrist. You need money! You need power! You listen to Grandma. NOW!"

I suddenly felt the jade press into my larynx. I said, "GAK!"

The tightening of the necklace pressed on my throat. I let go of Blaine and his bloody head allowing gravity to thump and thud his apparently thick skull on the tub floor; the pink was growing darker now.

So much darker.

"Let Grandma in!" a voice in my head said.

I knew the voice. It had been a constant companion as of late. Was the same voice that had instructed me to remove the daisy shaped, anti-slip stickers, from the bathtub floor. Same voice told me about the best way to save soap scum until it was at maximum slipperiness. Same voice that wanted to keep playing 80s music day and night.

I had spent the morning ensuring there was just the right amount of soap scum. Then I spent the night drinking champagne with Blaine and sex bombing him. I knew he had a big meeting the next morning and I knew he had to be up at exactly 7am.

Which is why, at 7:15 am that hot Monday morning, the radio alarm went off playing, "I'll Tumble For Ya!" by Boy George.

Blaine was out cold. I went to the half-bathroom and found the pack of unfiltered Camels Grandma had requested. I shook one loose from the pack. I heard Grandma scold Camel Joe in my head for pandering to children.

"*So wronnnnnng!*" the voice scolded.

I pried open the old window to the back of the building. I got the cigarette lit with a strike anywhere and took a long drag. I looked at myself in the half-bathroom mirror. The jade was.... glowing, illuminating in the eddying curls of cigarette smoke that drifted around my scrunched-up face.

I heard myself say, "I'm tired of fucking you, Blaine," in Grandma's voice. I felt a wave of nausea come and go. I waited for the vertigo but it didn't come.

"*So wronnnnnng!*" the voice scolded again.

I would have objected but I was already choking on the blue cigarette smoke and really couldn't take anymore upset in my manic Monday morning.

I finished the cigarette and then flicked it out the window into the backyard. A tinge of guilt for littering and smoking passed across my person before;

***"Wash your hands!!!!!!! Filthy!!! Filthy like your net worth! You no 80s kid. You know nothing! Greed is good! Smoking good! Fucking good! Winning is best and winners keep their hands spotless! Spot! Less!"***

...

Back in the bedroom it was 7:28am. I gently whispered in Blaine's ear,  "Good morning, GLORY!"

Nothing.

I shook him gently.

Nothing.

I grabbed the speaker from the night table and gently put it on the pillow next to Blaine's head. I then left the room and gently closed the door. I pulled my iPhone from my pocket and within a few taps had some *James Brown* ready to play.

I turned the volume to make and tapped play.

***Get up (Get on up)***  
***Get up (Get on up)***  
***Stay on the scene (Get on up)***  
***Like a sex machine (Get on up)***

I heard Blaine utter a very clear and concise, "WHAT THE FUCK!?!" before I heard the hard thump of the speaker bouncing off the bedroom wall.

I heard Grandma say, "OH! You not like SOUL?!? Bad man! Bad taste! I give you authentic 80s!!"

I had no idea Grandma had such an extensive knowledge of 80s music! But, my hands quickly searched for, "Hear that voice again," by Peter Gabriel, and with one more tap the room exploded with sound....

***I want to be with you***  
***I want to be clear***  
***But each time I try***  
***It's the voice I hear***  
***I hear that voice again***

Another, "What the actual fucking-fuckity-fuck?!?!?!" and then the sound of commotion. Locomotion. And then the door opened fast and hard. I leaned against the hallway door. My foot flat against the wall, knee bent; the casual 80s look.

Blaine began to express his chagrin at his wake-up call, but before he could add punctuation I showed him my watch in a theatrical gesture that passively-agressively screamed, "I think you'll want to look at the time, big guy."

"Holy fucking shit! I'm late! I'm late! I'm so fucking late!!!! Can you call the office for me, babe! I gotta get in the shower!!!"

More locomotion. More hustle! Blaine had been fired from his last consulting job as a software developer and I knew how much he didn't want to lose this job. I also knew his manager was a toxic, narcissist with anti-social personality disorder who told Blaine over lunch his first day, out of the blue, "I once threw a cat out a window!"

The guy had been causing trouble for the company but no one more than Blaine. And I knew my husband. He was non-confrontational. He would just try to deliver such stellar work that it would speak for itself. Poor Blaine. He always saw the good in everyone.

So, I knew that when Blaine realized through his sleep deprived brain he was 30 minutes behind schedule it would create a panic. And it did! And with Peter Gabriel narrating no less.....

***Oh, I'm listening to the conversation***  
***Judge and jury in my head***

"YOU BETTER HURRY!" I admonished Blaine.

I heard the shower come on. Then, a flush, and then, then I heard the shower-curtain rings slide violently across the shower rod punctuated by a, "I'm so fucking late!"

***And still I hear that sharp tongue talking***  
***Talking tangled words***

Blaine was not having a good morning thus far.

I tapped the skip icon. And then, as if choreographed by God herself, Antoine "Fats" Domino came on the cylindrical speaker that lay abandoned on the bedroom floor. It was Blaine's favorite tune. I owed him *at least* that much. His dad had instilled a love in him for those oldies but goodies....

***Blue Monday, how I hate blue Monday - Got to work like a slave all day***

And then, then I heard a different kind of commotion. A short YELP? And then an unmistakeable sound.

***THUD-KEEEEERACCK***

Grandma said, "That called an onomatopoeia. It's when-"

I cut off Grandma. "I know what it means."

"Don't be disrespectful!" Grandma scolded and the jade necklace grew just snug enough to keep me in line.

I haven't apologized to anyone in a very long time and I didn't plan on starting now.

"OK," I replied and changed the song... I felt like a little *Bananarama* and I didn't care who knew it!

***Strange voices are sayin' (what did they say?)***  
***Things I can't understand***  
***It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand***

Grandma's voice said, "Good choice. You learning!"

"I *always* liked that song anyway." I said. Grandma was so annoying sometimes.

Anyway, like I already said, that's when I discovered Blaine on the floor of the tub, barely breathing, with some kind of sputum bubbling up from his mouth and down his chin while the shower water made pink spirals around the drain.

And now I was scrubbing my hands furiously wondering how to finish the job. And then it hit me like a sneak Russian attack right through my soul. And I thought, my God... the genius of that!

I finished washing my hands, flipped up the drain stopper and watched as the pink spirals lost their purpose in life. I turned back on the shower. The tub began to fill. I turned the water off again.

"Grandma impressed!" that fucking third person voice in my cranium echoed. "You better go leave house now and play dumb. So much life insurance!!!! Where we go first????"

Five minutes later I was finished dressing and putting on my face. On my way out for coffee I checked Blaine's pulse. I turned on the shower, harmonizing it with his pulse; strong.

***It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer***  
***Now you're gone - You're not the only one***

*Twenty minutes later*

I was washing down a second handful of antidepressants and sipping a mocha oat latte with three extra shots on one of the benches along Prospect Park West. I heard a siren and turned my head fast to see two firetrucks hauling ass and blowing that big horn. The necklace felt loose.

I began sobbing hysterically through sips of coffee. I closed my eyes and saw eddying pink swirls go down two drains that were my eyes. They swallowed the bloody water and when they were done Grandma said, "Good job. Let's go wash your hands and get insurance money!"

I cried some more. The necklace didn't grow any tighter. I could hear Grandma chuckling in the recesses of my mind.

I looked down at my palms. I saw red spots. I rubbed them together. I spit on my hands. Rubbed some more. Nothing.

The voice again: *"HANDS FILTHY!"*

I summoned all my courage and asked Grandma a question.

"Why?"

Grandma said in a shrugging voice as I felt the necklace slightly pinch; "Just another Manic Monday..."
