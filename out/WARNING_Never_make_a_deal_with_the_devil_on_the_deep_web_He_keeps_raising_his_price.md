It all started with me scrolling the web. I didn’t have a girlfriend or any real friends to be honest, so that’s how I spent most Sundays.

To be specific, it was the so-called “deep web”. Not because I was into anything shady, but because a bunch of YouTube videos had made me curious.

I followed all the tutorials, installed a VPN, and spent two hours hopping between random sites selling everything from drugs to guns to sex. It was all junk, until I stumbled on something truly strange.

*“Make your pact with the devil NOW.”*

That was the title of the post, and the description read:

*Stuck in your job? Can’t find a girlfriend? Your family thinks you’re a loser? Send an email now and get your own pact with the devil.*

At the bottom was an encrypted email address, standard for this kind of post.

I laughed at it. But honestly? I checked every box on that description. It was obviously a joke and I decided to see how it played out. So I sent the email.

To my surprise, I got a reply fifteen minutes later.

*Send address to receive tools.*

I started to wonder if it was some sort of scam. Still, curiosity won and I replied with my building address, leaving out the apartment number, and used a fake name.

Got no response after that. I figured that was the end of it.

Then a week later, the janitor knocked on my door holding a white box with my real name on it. Not the fake one.

The word *PACT* was written across it in large block letters.

I was creeped out by it and opened it carefully, not sure what to expect. Inside were three black candles and a ripped notebook page with text scribbled in pen.

On one side was a paragraph written in an unknown language. It used the Roman alphabet so I could read it but it didn’t make sense.

The other side had short instructions, in plain English:

*1 At midnight, with all lights out, light the candles in a triangle alignment on the floor.*

*2 Put this piece of paper in the middle and read the other side out loud.*

*3 Drop a single drop of blood from your finger onto the paper.*

It felt surreal. I tried to guess what the endgame of this was… maybe a prank to make people feel stupid?

Still, my dumb curiosity and boredom won. 

That night, I followed the steps, feeling like a complete idiot. I lit the candles, read the text, and made a little cut on my finger to get the drop of blood onto the page.

It didn’t take long for my curtains to sway violently like a strong wind had come.

A chill ran through my spine, and I heard footsteps coming from the shadows right in front of me. 

I froze as a human figure emerged slowly from it. Androgynous, thin, young and actually beautiful. Its skin was like silk and it wore a red cloak. On his face a calm, almost gentle expression.

I stood up and walked back, heart racing.

The figure extended its hand toward me.

“*Shake my hand to seal the pact,*” his voice was smooth and gentle.

“*What pact?*” I asked.

“*A pact with me. To give you everything you ever wanted.*”

*“What’s the price?”* I asked, my words trembling.

“*Just the blood you already gave. That drop buys you one year.*”

“*That’s it?”*

*“That’s it.”*

Part of me wanted to run. The other part whispered in my ear: *are you really going to risk being a loser forever?*

So I firmly shook its hand, and immediately everything went black.

I woke up in bed to my alarm blaring at 7 a.m., with no memory of getting there.

The paper and candles were completely gone from my living room. 

I got ready for work, stunned, and spent the whole commute replaying the night. Wondering if it was all an hallucination or something.

When I arrived at work, I noticed a group of coworkers whispering among themselves. They explained in shock to me my boss had died that morning of a sudden heart attack. 

At my cubicle, a deep anxiety grew. It just felt too strange that this happened right after last night.

And just as I was about to head out for lunch, one of the company’s executives called me into his office. I sat there, stunned, as he explained that they needed an immediate replacement for my boss and that I was their first choice. Naturally, it came with a generous raise. 

I accepted without hesitation.

I walked over to the taco truck where I usually had lunch, feeling a mix of excitement and guilt.

While I was paying it, I noticed the cashier, a beautiful brunette who had never noticed me before, suddenly staring at me. As I walked back to the office, she ran up to me, looking nervous, and asked if I wanted her number.

My life completely flipped in a single day.

\*\*\* 

The next few months were awesome. I got another promotion, and dated some of the most beautiful women I had ever seen.

At work, everyone seemed to love me. They constantly praised me and gave me awards. Even my father started talking to me again and said he was proud. That was a shocker.

As for dating, I eventually got tired of the bachelor life and settled down with a girl I used to have a crush on back in high school. We were planning to get married soon.

A week before the one-year pact expired, I sent another email to the same address and received a new box. I hid it in the basement of the new house I had bought.

That night, I opened the box, lit the three candles, and read the words out loud while letting another small drop of blood fall from my finger.

The figure appeared quickly from the shadows, and when I raised my hand to seal the pact again, it didn’t respond.

"*The price has changed,*" it said, expressionless.

"*What’s the price?*" I asked, eager to keep my new life.

"*Your finger. Two more years in exchange for one of your fingers. You must cut it off and place it on the paper.*"

"*What?*" My eyes widened. "*You can’t be serious. I’m supposed to cut it off?*"

"*Yes.*"

I tried to argue, to bargain for something else, but it wouldn’t budge.

"*What happens if I don’t pay?*"

"*You’ll just go back to being your old self.*"

And that, I couldn’t take. I rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of whiskey, some pills, and a sharp knife.

It took a while for me to get the courage to do it. I chose my left pinky and cut it off in one clean slice. It hurt like hell, but as soon as I shook its hand to renew the pact, I blacked out and woke up in my bed. 

My finger was missing, yet somehow, I didn’t feel any pain.

\*\*\*

The period following the second pact was the happiest time of my life.

I did well in business and decided to start my own company to make the most of my connections. I got married, and my wife gave birth to beautiful twins. We moved to the suburbs to give our children a better life.

I was so caught up in my joy that I completely forgot about the due date.

My clients, home life, and daily routine made me lose track of the exact day the pact was supposed to end, and I only realized it had expired when things started to change suddenly.

Overnight, my wife stopped looking at me with love and began to look at me with contempt, as if she wondered why she had married me.

At work, my employees listened to me explain things as if I were crazy, like I didn’t know what I was talking about. Like I was that dumb junior analyst again.

That’s when I remembered about the two years and panicked. I sent ten emails in a row to that same address and got the box for the third time a week later.

As I lit the three candles, I brought the sharpest knife I had and a rag to cover my mouth in case I screamed. I was prepared to give up the other pinky.

But that goddamn devil had other plans.

“*The price has changed. Now it’s your hand for five years,*” it said with the same blank look as before.

“*That’s not fair!*” I angrily shouted. “*You can’t keep raising the price. It’s* m*y life we are dealing with!*”

It didn’t answer or show any pity. “*That is the price,*” it repeated.

I sat on the floor, crying and cursing the day I sent the first email.

My mind kept going back to who I was before all this: a young, mediocre, lonely man who stayed up all night doing nothing and being nothing.

I gripped the knife firmly.

\*\*\*

It turns out living without one hand is manageable, especially if it’s not your dominant hand.

Of course, the pain was unbearable and nowhere near as easy to handle as losing the pinky.

It took a long time, a disturbingly long time, to get it all done. There was so much blood that I almost passed out before giving the devil his handshake with the only hand I had left.

At least, that’s what I remember. It was five years ago.

Yes, five.

That’s why I’m writing this. That’s why I need to vent a little about this deal and give you all a warning.

If you’re ever offered something like this, never accept it, because once you do, there’s no turning back.

As I finish my story (slowly, as you can imagine), the box is lying in my basement, and tonight I will light the three candles again.

I don’t know what it will demand this time. The other hand? A foot? My entire arm?

I’ve found it’s better not to dwell on it, mainly because it doesn’t matter.

I’ll pay it [anyway.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Accomplished_Low7889)
