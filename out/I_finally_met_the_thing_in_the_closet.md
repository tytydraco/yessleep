Starting from the time I was born, I grew up in a small room on the third floor of my family’s country estate. In most ways the room was ordinary, painted in a pale pink color that I loved (until I didn’t) and tastefully furnished with a double bed, a white writing desk and ample shelves to display my beloved collection of stuffed rabbits.

The only unusual feature of the room was the closet. Featuring a door of glass and painted concrete, the closet was locked at all times. The door itself was large, perhaps a foot taller than a standard one and twice as wide. Though the glass looked fairly new, parts of the door looked old. Perhaps they weren’t concrete at all but rather carved stone. Inset into the rock were strange symbols that looked like arrows and birds, the line all straight, chiseled. 

When I asked what was inside, my father told me it contained dangerous electrical wiring that would kill me in an instant if I ever touched it. 

For the first few years of my life, I supposed I believed all of that, just as I believed in Santa Claus and angels and other nonsense. Then, one day when I was four or five, trying to sleep at night, I heard something from the closet: a muffled cough. It almost sounded far away, though the closet was no more than five feet from my bed. At first, I dismissed it as my imagination. Then, more certainly this time, I heard it again. Two coughs in a row, muffled as if behind a very thick wall. 

My heart raced. My bladder emptied. I called for my mother as loud as I could. She and my father both ran up the stairs in an instant. Their movements were quick and methodical. My mother turned on the light, and my father edged toward the window. It was only after my eyes adjusted to the light that I realized he was carrying a gun.

“Not the window,” I said. “The closet.”

My parents exchanged a glance, and my mother gave an audible sigh of relief. 

“There’s nothing in the closet,” she said, stroking my hair. “Now, let’s change these sheets and pajamas and get you back to bed.”



As time went on, I noticed other strange things about the room. Once, when my parents refused to let me visit town for the 100th time, I angrily tossed a chair at my bedroom window, sure it would smash into a million pieces. It did not. Instead the chair bounced harmlessly off of the glass and ended up clocking me in the face, giving me a nasty cut.

Later, I looked more closely at the glass and realized it was thick. So was the glass on the windows downstairs and even the car (though we rarely traveled.) In fact, it was only on rare occasions that we left the estate. Instead of school, I was treated to a series of private tutors, who educated me in Latin, Greek, and mathematics. On every visit, my father searched these men thoroughly, turning out pockets and looking about their mouths with a tongue depressor and a flashlight.

Once, I asked my Latin tutor about the symbols on my closet. He spent a bit of time examining them, looking perplexed. 

“What are they?” I asked. “Hieroglyphics?”

“No,” he said. “I’d say Cuneiform… except that I only recognize about half of the symbols. The others are different than any I’ve seen.”

“How familiar are you with Cuneiform though?” I asked.

“Very.”

On the way out of the house that day, I saw the scholar talking with my father. My father kept his face stoney but glanced at me once or twice, nodding his head. 

The next week, a new tutor arrived.



I was allowed ample television time. I knew that my situation was different than most. Indeed, I was being treated more like a Renaissance princess than a modern day girl. 

“Am I sick,” I asked my father at dinner one day when I was nine, and he and my mother exchanged a look. “Are you worried the tutors are contagious?”

“Of course not,” said my father. 

“Am I a vampire then? A witch? A monster of some sort?”

“Not even a bit!” said my mother, laughing a bit now.

“Am I a princess?” I asked. “A countess? A lady of some sort.”

My parents exchanged a look.

“You are not,” my father finally said. “We just want to keep you safe.”

Beneath the table, my fists curled into balls.

“And am I meant to be kept as a prisoner forever?” I asked. 

I expected my father to roll his eyes, to dismiss my question as he always did. Instead, he simply said, “no,” and returned to cutting his pork chop into tiny pieces.



My parents were an unbreakable vault of secrets. My tutors refused to speak of anything but their assigned subjects. I had no playmates. And so I began to talk to whoever lived in my closet. I knew someone was there.

“I wonder if you’re a man or a woman,” I began to speak into the dark one day. “Or perhaps you’re not just one person. Perhaps there are many of you. Or perhaps you’re not a person at all. Perhaps you’re a pack of monsters trapped in there by a witch’s curse. Perhaps you’re a ghost haunting me.”

The closet did not respond. But I kept talking anyway. 

“It’s okay if you can’t say anything. I suppose we’re all bound by rules of some kind. But I know you’re there. I heard you cough. I think I heard a sneeze once too. My ears are pretty good, you know. Sometimes, I think I hear you breathing.”

I went on like that for hours, some nights, treating the thing in the closet like my personal diary. It was a good listener, after all. I suppose, over time, it became my closest friend.



Then one night I woke to the sound of an explosion, followed by my mother screaming from far away. Then came the rapid staccato of gunfire and en eerie silence. I looked outside to see three black vans parked outside and half a dozen men pointing guns at my window. 

Then came the thwack of bullets against the glass. At first, they had no effect. Then the first crack formed. 

I was about to scream when I turned to see my closet door opening. 

Something big came out. It might have been a person, except that it was three to four times the size of my father. Through the dark of the room, I could tell that it was dressed in some kind of skintight suit all made of black scales that seemed to shimmer in the moonlight. The suit seemed to cover every inch, even his face. He had no hair as far as I could tell, and above his eyebrows was a ring of protrusions that might have been horns.

“Get in the closet,” it said, its voice lower than any man’s. His hands began to tense, and his fingers seemed to lengthen into knives. “Don’t open the door for anyone but me.”

Just then, the window exploded, and quicker than I would have thought possible, the thing threw its body between me and the breaking glass. Without another word, it hoisted me into the closet as if I were a sack of flour and then slammed the door behind me.

The first thing I noticed from inside the closet was that the mirror was one-way. I could see out perfectly though the glass. It occurred to me that the thing had been watching me every night of my life since I was a baby. 

The second thing I noticed was a man–a normal-sized man–in some kind of military uniform running up the stairs, his gun already firing. A pair of bullets caught the creature in the gut, but it barely winced. 

“Paz on sight! Holy fuck I’ve never seen one this–”

Before the man could utter another word, the thing charged at the man, swinging its long fingers, slicing him in half at the waist. 

The man’s walkie talkie buzzed over his corpse: “Cowboy? You still there? What age Paz we talking? What size? Cowboy?”

More bullets cut through the room. The thing descended the stairs. I heard another scream. Whatever soundproofing existed in the room seemed to also work one way. Scream after scream carried their way to my ears along with bursts of gunfire. I watched bullets cut through my mattress, sending bursts of feathers into the air.

I’m not sure how long it went on like that. Perhaps ten minutes. Perhaps an hour. I shook with fear. I cried. At least I didn’t wet myself this time. 

Then, finally, it was over. I heard the heavy thud of footsteps coming up the stairs, and the creature appeared. It held its hand to the door, which opened automatically at its touch.

“More will come,” he said after a few minutes. A bit of blood was dripping from his sharp teeth. I wasn’t sure if it was his or someone else’s. “Come.”

Then it reached for me and I collapsed into its arms. The last thing I saw before I passed out were two black wings unfolding from its back.



I woke the next day in a bedroom that was completely unfamiliar. Odd sculptures of men with elongated faces lined an entire wall of the room, staring at me with contorted grins. Before long, a woman I recognized as a distant aunt entered holding a tray of dates and tea. I looked at them suspiciously, but I was starving, and I figured if she meant to kill me, I’d be dead.

“My parents–” 

“Your legal guardians will be missed,” she said.

“Why did this happen?”

“There are some things that you are better off not knowing. I suppose the most I can say is that we come from a very old family. Maybe the oldest family, one whose roots go back to the dawn of human history. From time to time, a question of succession arises. The rules are rather arcane, but it’s not strictly father to son, mother to daughter. More important are the number of surviving cousins, brothers and sisters, that sort of thing.” 

I was trying to take in everything she was saying, but in truth, I was nervously glancing around the room. There was no closet here. No protector. I had never felt so alone.

My aunt continued, “Often, there is bloodshed. Sometimes, a bloodbath. For years, the families lie in wait, knowing the moment of bloodletting will eventually arrive. And then everyone moves at once until things are sorted out. It’s the reason we employ certain protectors.”

My heart was beating fast again.

“For many years you were seventh in line. Then, for a moment, you were fifth. Then third. Then… well, something terrible happened to several families, and now, here we are, with a new queen already selected and a hundred people ahead of you to be next in line after her. Lucky you, I suppose.”

I couldn’t stop crying. Couldn’t stop shaking.

“Where is then closet?” I asked.

“Your protector has been reassigned,” she explained. “You don’t need him anymore.”



The years that followed were hard. I went to live with unfamiliar relatives who knew little of my previous life. My new room was smaller, with barely room for a small desk and a dresser. I had no closet. Suddenly, I was middle-class, treated like a normal child. 

My new family had been told that I’d been through some sort of trauma but struggled to understand why I shied away from windows. When I tried to speak with other children, I came off like an encyclopedia, spouting occasional phrases in dead languages and facts about the emperors of Rome.

I aged, growing into a teenager, getting swept up into the world. 

The adjustment was difficult at first but also thrilling. I still remember the first day I was allowed to walk on my own to school. I reached a major intersection and didn’t even cross when the signal came on. I was so enthralled looking in all four directions, knowing that I could walk any way I chose, off into the seemingly infinite world.



By the time I reached college, my early childhood had almost started to feel like a distant dream. I had adapted, or at least, learned to put on the facade of a normal person. I hadn’t had a boyfriend yet, and my friendships were awkward and surface-level, but it seemed I was on track to eventually integrate into the world. 

One day, my sophomore year, I borrowed a friend’s most revealing outfit and walked through the biting cold to a holiday party. The lightly falling snow immediately summoned goosebumps on my bare skin, but I pressed on, eager to be part of the world.

At the party, I drank far too much and ended up sharing my first kiss with an older guy, a senior with a bad reputation. I looked for my friends but couldn’t find them. The boy kept offering me drinks, and before too long, he was walking me home, his hand already playing with the backstraps of my dress.

We practically fell into my place–a little cottage my family had rented near campus. The boy had something upsetting by that point, and I wanted him to go, but he wasn’t really listening. 

“You owe me,” he kept saying. “You invited me here. Just a little something. Just a little.”

I tried to push him away, but he was twice my size. He had me on the floor, wrists pinned.

“Huh,” he said, suddenly noticing something in the corner of the room. “What’s that?”

I turned, and there it was. Just as I remembered it: the closet. It hadn’t been there that morning. Now, suddenly, it was back, just as if it had been there all along.

“You should go,” I said. I wasn’t afraid anymore. Suddenly, the boy seemed small. 

“I don’t think so,” he said, tightening his grip.

“You’re hurting me,” I said, but I wasn’t really talking to him anymore. 

“Only a little bit,” he said, smiling.

“Last chance,” I said, and he let one of my arms go, but it was only to start unbuckling his belt. I heard the clank of his buckle hitting the floor. 

Then the creak of a closet door.

It was the last sound he ever [heard](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).
