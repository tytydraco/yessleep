So, something weird happened at work on Friday.

It turns out that we have pigs. I had just clocked out and was about to buy a loaf of bread for my mother when the sound of the automatic doors opening alerted me to our next customer.

“Hey, Spike. We got some customers coming in.”

Spike was scrolling on his phone and decided to respond by… putting it away and being respectful. He got up and prepared himself to greet the customers.

I’m a bit desensitized to this stuff, so my socks weren’t blown off when a few pigs walked into the store. More pigs than we could realistically handle, but hey, what does that matter?

I walked up to one of the pigs and greeted them.

“Hello! How are you folks doing today?"

To my surprise, one of them actually started talking.

“*We are hungry*.”

I took a deep breath and prepared myself for the headache I knew was coming.

“Okay. A—are you thinking anything in particular? We’ve got lots of stuff.”

I then remembered that we had dumpsters out back.

“Oh!” I said, cutting myself and the pig off (potentially), “We’ve got some dumpsters out back! If the rumors are true, you guys’ll eat anything, right?”

The pig grunted, snorted, and responded to me.

“I guess so.”

“Great."

I led them out to the back where our dumpsters were. Spike and I worked together to tip one of them over, the contents of it spilling out into a disgusting, vomit inducing sludge pile.

The lead pig looked at me before directing his friends to the pile and lapping up the revolting swill.

When they finished, he looked back at me with hungry eyes.

“Sorry, folks. That’s all we got.” I said, shrugging my shoulders. The lead pig walked up to me.

“We are still hungry. We want more.”

“We don’t have any more, I already told you. I’m sorry.”

“Fine,” he responded, turning around and directing his attention back to the dumpster, “this vessel of trash shall suffice, then."

And to me and Spike’s complete surprise, the three pigs clamped onto different ends of the dumpster and each tore off a third of it.

As if our disbelief couldn’t suspend itself further, the pigs began to eat the thirds of the dumpster they took.

 In just a few short seconds, they had managed to chew the metal so that it was soft enough to not tear a hole in their throat as they swallowed it.

After swallowing the pieces of metal, the lead pig returned to me and uttered a simple “thank you” before turning and trotting away.

Spike and I stood looking at each other for a few minutes before we snapped out of our trance and went back inside. On one of the registers, scribbled in near illegible handwriting, was the message “***THANXS FOR THA FOODS***  

—***~~TEH~~*** ***THE PIGS”***

Suppose we’ve got something interesting to tell Lily about tomorrow.

\-EDIT-

They did say they could eat ANYTHING, huh?

—————————————————————————————

I suppose it isn’t every day that a knife wielding maniac comes your way. Believe it or not, that happened to Lily yesterday just after Spike and I clocked out, so I’ll let her tell you about it.

Even though I’m from Wales, I do not in-fact encounter knife-toting knob heads every day (only every other day). Anyways, a knife wielding maniac came into the store today.

Don’t worry about me. A person wielding a knife is pretty close to the bottom on the list of things I worry about encountering here.

Regardless, it still gave me a bit of a shock.

I was getting ready to close up the store, it being 11:47 PM and all, when I heard the sound of the automatic doors opening. Interesting. Who’d come in this late?

I found out pretty soon after who’d do that kind of thing.

He was about 5’10 and 180-ish pounds from what I could see (I don’t know, everything is big when you aren’t), and he held a machete in his left hand with mace in the right.

A wicked combo if you ask me.

Oh, right, he was covered in blood too. I really hoped it was his.

“Sir, it’s closing time. You need to leave.” I said, putting myself into a defensive stance. I suppose if he attacked me, then it wouldn’t really matter, but I had to try something.

He turned to me and began to creep slowly in the same direction. I didn’t have a reason to be afraid, not deathly so, anyways. So long as he didn’t sprint at me or anything, I’d be fine.

“Mister,” I said, trying to sound as sympathetic as possible, “it’s closing time, you gotta go.”

He broke his own silence.

“Hey, missy. You wanna know how many people I’ve killed with’is thing?”

He didn’t appear to be intoxicated or under the influence of anything, which made his disturbed look a lot scarier.

“I—I don’t. Why—you need to leave, sir.”

He began to wave the machete around.

“People’been goin’ missin’ lately. You’re prolly wonderin’ who’s been doin’ it.”

I suppose I was.

“Well, darlin’,” he said, pointing the machete at himself, “you’re *lookin’* at him.”

He was cackling by now.

Before I could do anything, he sprung up and launched himself at me. The whole “life flashing before your eyes” thing is really propped up. I just felt scared as he neared me.

Before he could hurt me, something came crashing down from the ceiling.

It was one of the Carpenter Goblins. He had struck the man on the head with a mallet.

After they incapacitated and brought the man outside, they returned to me and handed over a business card.

It said “CARPTENTER GOBLINS: WE BUILD STUFF. HIRE US.”

“We already have you guys on the payroll. Kent said so.” I replied.

Like that, they were gone.

Gone, but that was okay; they had done their job of helping Strange, huh?
—————————————————————————————
Being that I’m just a high school kid, letters from any “secret admirer” are not only few and far between, but also really fascinating and exciting (yeah, I’m a teenage male).

Over the past couple of days, though, it’s been really weird. I’ll write out the contents of all the letters I’ve received over the past two or so days.

**LETTER ONE**

“*To; Oliver Smith,*

*I’ve been watching you. I’ve been observing how you live, study, work, etc. And I must say, I like what I see ; )*

*If you want this to go somewhere, just write me back. I’ll know where to find the letter.*

*In fact, here’s my number*

\*(XXX) XXX-XXXX (\*I am censoring it because I’m not letting any of you goons go through what I went through).

*Again, if you want this to go somewhere, then you know how to find me, my little 5’7 king.*”

And that was the first letter, a bit weird if you ask me. Nothing of it really caught my eye except for the number and the whole “5’7 king” part. It’s average, okay?

I blotted out the number because again, I don’t want a single one of you goons calling it. IT WON’T WORK OUT! IT DIDN’T WORK OUT! Sorry, back to normal.

I decided to call it. For fun, you know.

After three rings, someone picked up. I made the first move.

“H—hello?”

“Oliver?” First name basis now, cool.

“Uh, yup, that’s me. What’s with the letter?”

“Is it not obvious? I’ve got kind of a… you know… *thing* for you. I’ve been sta—watching you and I’m not going to lie; I like what I see.”

“Oh,” I said, panicking, “uh, do you want to meet up somewhere, or something?”

“I was hoping you’d ask something like that. Oh man, what a relief!”

I decided to put on the charm and see if I could sting her with anything.

“Good thing I did. I can tell from your voice that you’re probably real pretty.”

“Well, I wouldn’t exactly say that.”

“Single, too?”

“Ready to mingle.”

“Okay, you wanna meet up somewhere?” Note, I was asking this because I wanted to catch a potential predator, nothing else.

“Coffee shop near the market? I hear it isn’t too busy today.”

“Sure.”

“Awesome! How does 3 PM sound?”

“Wonderful.”

“Great! See you then!” Jackpot.

I told Spike, Lily and Clyde about it and they agreed to my little sting operation.

We all walked to the coffee shop. I had them wait outside while I went in. The shop was empty… too empty.

Nobody was in there… at all. In addition to that, all of the windows were blacked out.

 At least the barista was still working, but as I looked closer, I could see that the barista was a woman.

“Oliver?” She said, interrupting my thoughts.

I walked up to her.

“Hey, you. How’s it going?” I said in my best suave voice. I had to bait her into saying something.

“Good,” she replied, “you want some coffee?”

“I’d prefer you, if that’s okay.” Please work, please work, please WORK.

“Ooh.” She said, walking out from behind the counter and leaning down in my face.

Now was the moment, all I had to do was not fuck it up.

“NOW!” I screamed, and the door burst open, drenching the shop in sunlight.

Before the woman could do anything, she burst into flames.

Her screeches were quickly reduced to nothing more than deathly rattles as the last of the flames consumed her.

Turns out she was a vampire, I guess. Wouldn’t have expected that, but nothing in this town makes sense.

I suppose I now know where those customers went, too.

Oh, another thing. There was a note on the doors that said “NO PRODUCTS WITH GARLIC TODAY.” Should’ve been a dead giveaway.

Well, I’m home now, relaxing and currently typing this out, actually. I’ve got work again tomorrow, so I’m conserving my energy for that.

We’ve got a new guy coming in tomorrow as well, and I’ve gotta train him, so I’ll let you folks know how that goes.

Until next time.

I hate it here :(
