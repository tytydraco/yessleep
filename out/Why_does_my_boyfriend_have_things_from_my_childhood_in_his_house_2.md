Hi all,

This is an update to the post I made a few hours ago, which you can find here: [Why does my boyfriend have things from my childhood in his house? : nosleep (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12y65o3/why_does_my_boyfriend_have_things_from_my/)

Thanks for all of your advice. It's been a great deal of comfort to me as I know for a fact that if I was left to my own thoughts I probably would have done something stupid. The gist of the advice given to me was to lay low for now - I was honestly on the brink of having a full breakdown in front of him after opening that desk lid, and glad I didn't. Tom is my ticket away from here.

I need some answers though, just something to put me at ease and stop the mental spiral that's been the past 24 hours. And I'm not sure how that's going to happen.

&#x200B;

He was knocking on the bathroom door, and I cowered from the sound. It was gradually growing impatient. 'What're you doing in there?' Tom's voice was riddled with a mixture of sleep and annoyance. 'Emma, open the door. I want to use the loo.'

I got out of the bathtub, my legs shaking. I couldn't bare to face him, not now. 'J-just a second!' I flushed the loo and stowed my phone in my pocket, leaving the tap on for a few seconds. 'Almost done.'

I opened the door, tentatively. He was glowering, arms crossed. 'Honestly Em, you need to learn how to hurry up sometimes. I just know that you were on your phone-'

I cut him off, a nervous laugh escaping before I had the chance to restrain it. 'Well I'm done now! Go on, you go. I'm gonna go back to bed.' Without giving him a chance to respond, I inched past him and immediately got under the covers, shielding his face from view. I hoped that in the seconds we brushed chests he couldn't feel my heartbeat. It was pounding. Beads of sweat had materialised on my hairline and I prayed to whatever higher power existed that the light was too dull for him to see it.

Tom yawned, shrugging. He entered the bathroom and locked the door. And that's when the tears started.

&#x200B;

Breakfast was a solemn affair.

I had spent the rest of the night awake, to afraid to fall asleep and let my guard down to whoever was lying next to me. I muffled my sobs in the pillow and eventually only dozed for a mere hour. Once I made my way downstairs - getting ready with my back to the damned thing - Tom and his parents were sat in the dining room.

I hung back, loitering on the staircase - and my running stream of thoughts almost made me not register that they were having a hushed conversation.

'Emma op-'

I caught my name and my breath hitched. Maybe it was benign, a light-hearted comment about my strange bathroom habits or something. I was too scared to interject and ask what he meant, instead quickly showing my face, unable to bear being alone with my thoughts anymore. 'Good morning.'

Three pairs of eyes stared back at me. Beryl was the first to break the tension. 'Morning, dear. Did you sleep well?' She rose as I sat down, filling my plate with eggs and bacon. I swallowed, giving her a taut smile.

'Yes, thanks. The room was lovely.' Tom's eyes, which were trained on his plate, fleetingly met mine. I broke the contact, trying not to shiver. George cleared his throat.

'I'm glad you liked it. Have the two of you got any plans today?' When he said this, he looked at me pointedly, and I recalled the conversation we had the night prior. He was trying to figure out if I was going to be alone with him, I understood.

Tom sat up, his back straightening. I didn't know why he was being so frosty with his parents in front of me, as if he was still annoyed with them. After all, they were in a fraught discussion before I came down. It was as if I had extinguished it all with my entrance.

'I thought I'd show Emma the grounds today. The weather is amazing and we need to take advantage of it.' He smiled but it didn't quite reach his eyes. Something inside of him was holding back.

Nausea was building. Was he going to do something? Did he know what I had done?

Then, as quickly as it came, his eyes softened, the smile reaching them.

&#x200B;

I excused myself halfway through, making up an excuse about needing to pick out some warmer clothes, and hurried up the spiral staircase. Once I got inside the room - still refusing to acknowledge or even look at the desk - I barricaded myself in the bathroom again. It turns out that it's the best place in the house in terms of reception.

She picked up on the second ring. 'Hi Emma! Didn't think you'd call so early. Are you coming home or something?'

My mum's voice was almost enough to bring the tears back, but I cleared my throat, blinking hard. 'Hi mum. No, still here and plans are as normal. I just wanted to ask you a quick question, if that's ok.'

'What is it? Are you alright? Did something happen?' Normally, this onslaught would have made me annoyed, but in this instance I wanted to crawl into her arms. *No, no mum I'm not alright please come and get me away from here.*

'Everything's ok, don't stress,' I managed, regulating my heavy breathing. 'Just wanted to ask where do you keep all of my baby stuff? Is it still in the boxes in the attic, or did you move them around?'

I could practically feel the waves of confusion radiate from the phone. 'They're still in the attic the last time I checked, which was a couple of weeks ago when I was doing some cleaning, d'you remember? Anyway, this is a bit of a random thing to ask. What happened?'

'Nothing, Tom's parents were showing me the cutest pictures of when he was like, four last night. I wanted to maybe do the same thing if he ever comes to ours.' The lie slipped off my tongue. I couldn't believe what she was saying. Then how was this whole situation possible?

'That's a nice thought, I haven't even met him yet. You can't evade me any longer!' She laughed, carelessly. I honestly didn't think she realised that *she* was the reason that she didn't meet him, not my 'busy' schedule - but I didn't want to say anything and break her bubble. I couldn't have her worrying endlessly about me either, and come across as worried or snappy - more so than usual. I had to keep pretenses neutral.

'Yeah I'll bring him around soon, I promise. I've got to go - we're going on a walk for a bit.'

We exchanged goodbyes, and I tried to push the feeling down that I wouldn't speak to her again.

&#x200B;

Despite my mood, and the fact that I was alone with Tom, the grounds were beautiful. He had looked at me quizzically when I didn't cling onto his arm, like we normally did on walks, and he instead grasped my hand tightly. I couldn't help but think that this was a sick metaphor or something.

I tried to block him out and observe my surroundings - the birds chirping, tree branches swaying - but felt as though I was weighed down by him. I grimaced.

'Are you ok?' His voice was low, something I would have found attractive in another situation. 'You've looked pale all morning. D'you want to go back inside?'

I tried not to make my own voice shake. 'Would that be alright? I think that I need to sit down for a little bit. Didn't sleep very well.' *Please just let go of my hand.*

He nodded, ushering me back the way we came. I resisted the urge to free myself from his touch, to run away to God knows where and not look back. I hoped that once we were inside, he would leave me alone, but he settled me in the living room where I met his parents for the first time and sat on the couch opposite.

I closed my eyes, not wanting to see his bore into mine. I needed some sort of plan - either to get away from here or make sense of the situation. I went with the latter. To be honest, I was terrified to spend three hours in a vehicle with him alone, and knew that he was the only ticket I had to leave.

I got up and stretched. Tom had stopped his staring at me - it was really starting to piss me off, more than just unnerve me - and was glued to the TV. 'I think I might find your mum, Tom. She said last night that she might need some help with the cooking and I feel better now I'm inside.' Again, the lies came to me easily, it was almost impressive.

He gave me a quick glance over. I realised that to an outsider, this looked like a caring boyfriend looking out for his partner.

I felt something else.

&#x200B;

Beryl was stood at the sink, washing vegetables. Through the kitchen window, I could make out George's outline as he collected herbs from their small patch in the garden. 'What are you doing over here, love? I thought you and Tom were out until midday?'

I went with an easy smile, and shrugged. 'I was feeling quite tired and was wondering if you needed any help with cooking? I would prefer doing this than going out now, anyway.' I hoped it was convincing enough. I hoped that she would let me stay, away from Tom's prying eyes. To my immense relief, her face brightened. 'Of course, I could always use some help. Could you do some chopping for me?'

We stood, side by side at the counter, facing the window. I chopped absent-mindedly, barely paying attention to what I was doing, building up the courage to do what I came for. After five minutes, I couldn't take anymore, and I crossed the room to shut the door that led to the living room, where Tom was still sat, the TV blaring.

Beryl looked at me and frowned. 'Everything alri-'

'I need to talk to you.' I was amazed at how confident I sounded.

She opened her mouth then closed it, nodding. 'Is this about Tom? I'm glad you came to me.'

'It is, but something else too.' I breathed in, choosing my next words carefully. 'Have you noticed the desk in Tom's room, the one we're both sleeping in?'

Something in her face changed, a brief falter. 'Yes, the old heirloom? Not really Tom's taste but we didn't know where else to put it. What about it?'

'Tom was being strange about it last night. Remember how you told me about his tendencies to be controlling? For some reason, that brought it out of him. Do you have any idea why?'

She moistened her lips, looking down. 'No. I didn't think he cared for it that much. If you're feeling uncomfortable we can move it to another ro-' I interjected. 'No, no that won't be necessary. I don't think it's that big of a deal. Just curious about his reaction to it, that's all.'

I rinsed my hands, wringing them. 'My side is done.' I was referring to my share of the vegetables, now all chopped. 'Shall I help George with the herbs? He looks tired.'

Beryl looked through the window, seeing her husband wince slightly as he stretched his back. I was somewhat right - the amount of bending and crouching for a man of his age surely wouldn't be good.

Plus, I needed another perspective. I was nowhere near some actual information yet.

&#x200B;

'What're you doing here? Weren't you and Tom going to be out until lunch?' George was sweating slightly, but otherwise composed.

'I thought I'd help out with the food. I'm a bit too tired to walk, as well.' He smiled, eyes crinkling. 'Well, I can't say no to extra help. Carry this basket for me, would you?'

It was laden with some herbs, and I noticed that we were near the small flowerbed in the corner of the garden, where George was in the midst of arranging some roses together. 'Just to spruce up indoors a little,' he explained, tying them together with some string. 'They look lovely this time of year.'

I nodded, making a non-committal *mmm* sound. 'Listen, George, I was wondering if I could talk to you.' I probably came across as rude, but at this point the combined stress and fear I was feeling overpowered everything else. 'It's about Tom, regarding our conversation last night.'

His face slackened, if only for a second, then became a visage of worry. I tried not to dwell on this too hard. 'What is it? Are you alright?'

I repeated to him what I had said to Beryl, his eyes narrowing slightly. 'And you haven't pushed the desk with him again? Not after the first time you saw it?'

'No. I put it to rest immediately. Didn't want to heighten things.' He nodded, then gave me a small smile, one of approval. 'That's good. You haven't tampered with it, or anything? He would notice if you had.'

I swallowed. 'N-no, of course not.'

'Good. That's good. I can have a chat with him, if you'd like?' His tone baffled me. If you remember, it was calm and controlled last night, but still deadly serious. After I had told him this, he sounded oddly relaxed - almost as if we were having a discussion about a TV show, some meaningless trivia. Despite myself, I thanked him, and we retreated to the house together, my arms full of herbs taken from the garden.

&#x200B;

I'm back in the bathroom again. It's around eleven. I wrote everything above after lunch. The rest of the day was listless - I spent some time on my laptop in the airy conservatory, recounting this whilst everyone sat in the garden. I made an excuse about work. Once I had finished I stayed there, not wanting to engage in anything with the others.

But something that George had said shook me. I only registered this a few minutes ago, once we came up for bed. Tom is already asleep, so it was easy to slip away and come back here.

*You haven't tampered with it, or anything?*

*He would notice if you had.*

I stammered that I hadn't, declining the idea that I had gone near it at all. But now, in the last few minutes, the second sentence sank in.

I hadn't closed the lid properly last night.

I didn't lock it, just haphazardly placed it back on and locked myself in the bathroom.

Once I came out, after Tom's knocking, I went straight to bed, hiding under the covers.

How could I have been so careless? That entire night this slipped my mind. I was awake for so long, that *thing* in my eye of vision, and I didn't comprehend how unnatural it looked. All I thought about were the contents inside.

Why, why, why didn't I realise it quicker?

Because - *shit shit shit* \- we came up for bed and it was placed perfectly straight. The lid was firmly placed, locked and immovable.

It was like some kind of cruel joke. I only realised my mistake after it had been corrected.

Someone knew it had been opened. Someone had closed it properly, taking the time to re-lock it. I don't know who or when.

This morning, when I got up, I couldn't bear to look at it, and faced away when getting ready - was it already corrected then and I didn't notice?

Was it done when I came back upstairs when I called my mum and I was too dumb to see it?

How long has someone in this house known that those *things* \- I'm gonna be sick if I have to type it out again - have been seen? That it's been unlocked?

Why would they fix it?

Please, please tell me what to do. I still don't know how my things got here. And now I no longer know who to trust in this place.
