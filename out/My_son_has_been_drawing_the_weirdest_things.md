I was at work when I received a call from my son’s school. Worried that the little guy had thrown up again I quickly dismissed myself from a meeting with the other partners and stepped into the hall. 

“Hello? Is everything alright?” I asked. 

“Good afternoon Jack, this is Amanda calling. Is now a good time?” 

I frowned. Why was the principal reaching out? “Um, sure. I’m sorry but is everything okay with Flynn? Is he sick again?”

There was a long pause before Amanda spoke. “I have some concerning…material…here that your son was working on during recess. We confiscated it because the other children were getting scared. Flynn was a bit upset about that and he isn’t calming down. I understand you’re at work but is it possible that you could come by?” 

I was already grabbing my keys and heading towards the elevator. “Of course but have you reached out to Rose? She’s closer by.” 

“We tried several times but she hasn’t picked up her phone.” 

I hissed through my teeth. I loved my wife but if there is any one thing that gets on my nerves about her it’s the fact she never picks up the phone. It’s like she has a special knack for never being by it, especially when there is an emergency. 

While I was speeding down the freeway Rose called. “Jack, please tell me you’re on the way to the school.”

“I am. Want to tell me what you were up to in the garden this time?”

“Look hun I already feel bad. I called the school as soon as I got back inside. I’m just turning the corner now.” 

I shook my head and let out a slow exhale. A healthy marriage really did come down to picking your battles wisely. “Sounds good Rosie. I’ll be there in ten.” 

I pulled into the school’s parking lot and power-walked over to the main entrance where two armed security guards chatted with one another. I ignored my buzzing phone and dabbed my brow with my favorite silk handkerchief. 

I greeted both men and handed over my ID. While I waited I checked my phone and saw several missed calls from my secretary in addition to one missed call from Bob, the managing partner. 

Oh well. Fuck Bob. My kid is more important. 

The security guard took his sweet time checking my ID. Normally I wouldn’t mind that. We paid good money to keep our son in a school that cared about the safety of its children. But I didn’t like the dark look one of the security guards shot me once I got my ID back. 

I flung open the door to the admin building and locked eyes with the secretary. She looked me up and down while her fingers danced across her keyboard. “Amanda is expecting you, she said go ahead and walk right in. I’ll let her know you’re on the way.” 

“Thank you,” I said. 

Unfortunately I knew how to get there by myself because like I alluded to earlier, my son has had a recent slew of health issues. The odd thing though is that these issues didn’t seem to have a physical cause, which led Rosie and I to suspecting some kind of psychological explanation. The school psychologist agreed with us and ever since we have all been trying to get Flynn to understand he can get our attention without forcing himself to vomit. 

It had been a while since he last threw up, which made me suspect at the moment these ‘drawings’ were his latest way of trying to get attention. 

Amanda looked up from her stack of papers and smiled when I stepped in. “Jack! Thank you for coming by,” she said. She reached out and took my hand in hers. 

I nodded and took a seat across from her. “I like the desk. You got an upgrade.” I rapped my knuckles against it. “Solid wood right there.” 

She chuckled and took off her glasses. Her honey brown eyes were soft, her voice soothing. “How are you?” 

I laughed and looked away. There was a cute picture of a kitten hanging onto a branch that caught my eye. “How do you think? This is what, the seventh time this month that he’s done this?” I massaged my temples. Reminded myself to breathe. “Then there’s work and…everything else.”

Amanda tapped a manicured finger against her lips. “How are things with Rose?” 

“Good. We are in a very good place now.” 

“I’m glad to hear that Jack. Really.” 

“Alright well enough of this,” I said. “Where’s Rose and Flynn?”

“They left a few minutes before you arrived. Flynn was getting a bit too…how do I put it…” 

“Speak plainly please. You know me Amanda, I don’t care for all that fake talk.” 

Amanda folded her arms and sighed. “He was getting…upset. He hit one of the nurses and nearly jumped across this table to get to his drawing. I’ve seen some pretty possessive children but I have never seen one get that upset over their art. How is he doing at home? Does he get protective over either one of you? Does he play well with any neighborhood kids or…?”

I rolled my eyes. The fucking schools these days man, I’ll tell ya. The way the administrators talk reminds me of corporate speak. Just a bunch of phony bullshit masquerading as politeness. 

“Good Lord. Let me see it already. I want to know what everyone is getting so upset about. It better be the worst damn scene imaginable to justify…” 

Amanda slid the paper across the desk and looked away, but not before I caught her grimace. 

I grabbed the paper and flipped it over. I stared at it for some time and tried to make sense of what I was seeing. Then my hands started to shake. I wanted to ask so many different questions after realizing what my boy had drawn. Questions that every father is afraid to ask when something like this happens. But my throat was so dry that any words would have came out as choked grunts. 

“Take your time,” Amanda whispered. 

I finally found my voice and said, “I don’t…I don’t understand? Could he have seen something like this in a video game or show?”

“Possibly. How well do you monitor his technology usage?” 

I placed the picture back on the table. Left it face down. I wanted it burned but I needed some questions answered first. “He doesn’t have internet access and the TV is limited to what, the animal channel and the history one? Forget what they are called.” 

She shrugged. “These days those channels have more than just animals or history. But either way, Cera is on vacation so she won’t be available to see Flynn anytime soon. In the meanwhile I suggest you look very closely at the media you allow him to consume.” 

“Tell me Amanda. What do you really think about this?”

“I really don’t know Jack. The throwing up was bad enough. This makes things worse. I know you so I’m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, but to others it looks bad. You told me to give it to you straight so I will — it’s not normal for a young kid to draw something so…violent. And we can’t control the other kids from going home and telling their parents what they saw.” 

I didn’t like that. “What are you trying to say?” 

She got up from her chair and walked around the desk, taking a seat on the edge. The late afternoon sunlight made her hair match the color of her eyes. 
“I’m saying that if this continues we may have to expel Flynn.” 

I sprang up and got closer than I should have. But I was so pissed over everything that I lost myself. “Are you serious? After all the fucking money I have sunk into this school? We have donated double, no triple, of what anyone else has!” I grabbed her arm and stared deep into her eyes. “You’re not kicking him out of here even if he draws the damn Devil, got that?”

Amanda didn’t move my hand away. I wasn’t grabbing her that hard either. Not any harder than I have before. I let go and sunk back into my chair. “I’m sorry…I shouldn’t have.” 

She came closer and before I knew it she was running her hands through my hair. The way she used to. “I wish…” she began. 

I took hold of her wrists and moved them away. “You’re lucky Rose didn’t see that.” 

Suddenly professional again, Amanda returned to her seat. She placed her glasses back on and shuffled through the documents on her desk before handing me one. “This is for you, it’s a record of today’s incident along with my approval to keep Flynn at home for the remainder of the week. Cera will be back by next Monday. Maybe she will be able to help or at least point us in a better direction.” 

I thanked her and started to leave. But then I stopped in the doorway. “Amanda I’m sorry.”

“I knew what I was getting into, Jack.” 

No. No she didn’t. 

I stopped by the local pizzeria on the way back home. Nothing made Flynn happier than a couple slices (don’t forget the extra olives) and an old western flick. 

When I got home Flynn ran and tried to snatch the pizza box from my hands. He chased me through the house and into the kitchen where Rose was drinking what appeared to be her third glass of wine judging by the blush on her face. 

I greeted her with a kiss and one of those looks that said ‘we have a lot to talk about.’ Then I started grabbing plates while Flynn got us some sodas from the fridge. 

Flynn talked to us about some new dinosaur he was obsessed with. He showed us pictures on his iPad and enthusiastically explained how it defended itself with its thumbs. In between bites I marveled at the resilience within the mind of a child. How was it that they could change emotions so quickly? Or forget so soon? 

Was that a blessing or a curse? 

Whichever it was, I envied my son for that. These days, I felt a growing weight that seemed to carry me further and further into a dull apathy. I tried to stay in the present. I felt more alive there. But at night when everything got quiet, those inner voices got really fucking loud. 

I noticed my wife glaring at me over her wineglass. I smiled at her tiredly, ignoring those cries in the back of my mind. The ones that repeated again and again: *SHE KNOWS*

Later that night, after we tucked Flynn into bed with his legion of protective stuffed animals and guardian war-tabby, we started to discuss the day. 

“I’m scared Jack.” 

“I know. So am I.” 

“I don’t want him in therapy,” she said softly. “Did I ever tell you about my grandma? How they put her in that one asylum because she kept having nightmares of a man watching her from the closet?” 

“They don’t do that anymore.” 

“But the other kids…if they find out they will rip him to shreds. I can’t take that…”

“He’s a strong boy. He can get through anything.” I traced her shoulder in the way I knew she liked. “We’ll look back at all of this and laugh someday. Nothing bad lasts forever. We have both been through worse.” 

I heard her sob. Tears started to wet my shirt. “I just want him to be okay…” 

I held her while she cried. Then after she cried herself out and drifted off I laid there and stared up at the ceiling fan as it spun. I couldn’t fall asleep so I checked on Flynn, who was sleeping safe and sound, then went to sit down in the living room. 

I don’t know when I fell asleep. 

But I do know it was my son’s screams that caused me to scramble off the sofa and race down the hall. 

I pushed the door open. Flynn was on the bed, knees drawn up to his chest. He was crying and looking back and forth between me and the window.

It was wide open. 

I leaned outside. We live on the outskirts of town, so there is a fairly wide range of view from the second floor of the house. There was no one on the lawn, nor were there any signs that someone climbed up or down the wall. I couldn’t see anything out by the trees either. 

“Daddy!” Flynn shouted. “It was in the closet! Not outside.” 

“What?” I said. That’s when I noticed the closet doors were wide open. Some of Flynn’s toys were scattered around. Plushies, for the most part. They were missing limbs, eyes, and heads. 

Rose ran into the room. “Jack? What the hell is going on?” 

“Mommy there was someone in the closet who said they wanted to take me into the woods,”  Flynn sobbed. 

The woods? The woods? I looked at Rose. “Stay with Flynn and call the police. I’m going to drive around. See if I find anyone.” 

“Are you stupid?” She shouted. “You’re not going anywhere if some freak is out there trying to snatch our kid! Stay right there. I will call the cops.” 

Rose left the room. I clung to Flynn until I was finally able to relax by reminding myself that he was here with me. Safe and sound. Not taken. “Flynn? Buddy?  Can you tell me what the person looked like?” 

Flynn trembled. “I…I couldn’t see them.” 

“What do you mean? I thought you said they were in your closet?”

He hugged the only stuffed animal that hadn’t been ripped apart to his chest. “It was skinny and had long hair…”

I paused, wondering if it would be too soon to ask him the question I was terrified to ask. But I knew I had to. “Did it hurt you?” 

Flynn shook his head. “No. But it told me that it doesn’t like you.” He started to cry and between deep breaths he said, “it said…it said…that it doesn’t like you or Amanda.”

An eerie silence settled over the room. I leaned away from my son and took him by the shoulders. “Are you sure it said that name?” 

Flynn nodded. 

I felt rather than sensed Rose enter the room. I didn’t look back at her, I don’t think I could have even if I tried. “Are the police on their way?” I finally managed to ask.

“No,” Rose said. “But I think I found out who the culprit is. Come see. Flynn, stay.” 

I hugged my son, and followed my wife out into the backyard. It was cold out. A low wind sent a haunting moan echoing into the night. We came to a stop before the garden shed. It was there that I realized the moans weren’t coming from the wind, but from inside the shed. 

“Rose, what’s going on?” I asked. 

She looked to the side. Her cheeks were stained red. “I caught the person who has been destroying our family.” 

I stayed planted. “Why didn’t you call the police?” 

Rose, my Rose, laughed into the night. “The police? How would they help with this?” Her voice rose in pitch. “*Come see what I planted*.”

From inside that damn shed I heard another moan. I looked at my wife and then at the shed. In that moment, I made a choice. Not one that I am particularly proud of, and had I not been a father, I may have chosen differently. 

I shoved Rose with all my strength. She hit the shed with little resistance and collapsed into a sobbing wreck on the ground. I called the police and waited there, watching Rose wilt, until they arrived.

She was taken into custody and I was questioned. I received little sympathy from the officers and later the detectives. I told the judge at Rose’s sentencing that I wished for some lenience and that Flynn would still need his mother once she was mentally well again. 

However, the nature of her crime against Amanda was so severe that she was made an example of. 

It was a little over a year later, while I was at work, that I received a call from my son’s school. 

They told me that he had started drawing again, and that I needed to see what he had drawn. I sighed. He had just started doing better. 

I was listening to the radio on my way to his school, and while I listened, I heard them start talking about an event that occurred last night. 

Apparently there had been a mass breakout from Levitt Asylum. The asylum where my wife was being treated.
