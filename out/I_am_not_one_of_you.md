I lived in the places you never looked. You wouldn’t have seen me even if you had.

I wormed my way through the soil beneath your feet, nesting between grains of dirt. I crept up through the roots of trees, settling in among the heartwood fibers. I buried myself beneath mountains, in sands deep in the sea, in all the deepest, darkest places you have no use for.

I am nothing, but I could be anything.

I was never born, and yet here I am.

I have always been and will continue to be.

You have never seen me.

No one ever had –

Until the day I chose to become *something*.

The day I heard the voices.

I had slithered up into cracks in a crumbling concrete slab, up and up and up, until I pushed through a plank of rotting wood and into a *space*.

Everything about this place screamed *left alone*. Dark and rotting and quiet and still.

To you, it would have seemed narrow, just inches from one side to the other. To me, it was vast beyond imagining.

And the light. It flooded through holes and cracks on either side of me. It was sharp and searing and unforgiving and it *hurt*.

I fled to a dark corner and cowered, squeezing myself as small as I could get. I tried to burrow back down into the earth but I couldn’t remember how, not with the light screaming at me like that.

I don’t know how long I sat huddled there, shrinking in on myself, before the light began to soften, then darken, then disappear altogether. The screaming inside of me stopped.

With the pain gone, I realized I felt strange. Heavy. For the first time I could remember, I had mass. Took up space. The air particles had to move to make room for me. I wasn't sure I liked it.

Slowly, I unfurled myself and crept up toward one of the holes. A big, open space loomed in front of me, silvery light floating in through a series of square holes along one side. The floor was strewn with splintering wood and shattered glass. The walls were covered with strange, looping symbols in between strips of peeling paper.

This place, I would later learn, was called a *room*, and it was inside a *house*. One where no one lived anymore. Though it wasn't abandoned – not completely.

If the light was pain, this room was terror–a yawning abyss waiting to draw me into its trap. I thought if I moved too far forward I would fall and fall and keep falling forever, so I drew back into my corner, drinking in the dark.

I ached to be back among the grains of dirt, the wood fibers, the rocks pressed together deep underground. Safe places.

I should have gone back into the earth. I wanted to. But I was so tired, so weak. So I slept.

The light came back. Even from my corner, I could feel the it burning at my back. I needed to escape somehow, even if I was too weak to push back through the concrete.

The material around me felt like trees, something familiar, so I tried to sink into it – but the instant I did I squirmed back out again. It was cold in there, so cold. Like the time I had crawled into a tree that had started to die. It felt horribly wrong, worse than space and mass, maybe even worse than light.

The light faded, and I felt a rush of relief as darkness poured in.

Just as I began to doze, a strange noise snatched me back to wakefulness.

Not one noise – many noises, sometimes one at a time and sometimes overlapping and getting louder and louder until there was a great CRASH that shook the wall I huddled against. That was the *door* opening – I know that now.

I fled again, to the far corner, as far as I could get.

The *voices* were close now, just inches from me, on the other side of the wood and plaster. I’d never heard anything like them. They were loud and shrill and deep and quiet and soft and rough, and I knew they could not all be coming from one source.

Slowly, silently, I slithered up to the nearest hole and peered out.

Figures moved in the dark, shadows upon shadows. The noises came from them.

They settled down onto some of the objects in the room, and the objects creaked and groaned beneath them.

I understood nothing, but I was mesmerized. They were louder and faster than anything I’d ever encountered in the deep places.

I watched and listened, absorbed what I could, and started to notice patterns, rhythms to their noises and movements. I started to understand, a little. I could tell when they were happy or angry or irritated. I knew when something one of them said had amused the others, or annoyed them. They took turns passing around a liquid-filled glass bottle and gulping it down and whatever that liquid was made them louder and happier and harder to understand.

They left, significantly wobblier than they’d arrived. I watched them for as long as I could, but by then the light had started to come back and I had to hide again.

I couldn’t settle. I felt like I was vibrating. I was exhilarated by my discovery, but also it somehow made me sad. I’d never had much use for feelings before, but I couldn’t stop them from bubbling up and spilling out of me then. 

I shook and shook and waited for dark.

They were back the next night, and the next, and I watched again and again, learning their ways. I started to gather up words and phrases. I crept closer so I could learn their body language and facial expressions. I began to learn their relationships, that some were closer friends than others, some maybe even loved each other, some secretly didn’t even like each other. They were young–a concept hard for me to grasp. Young had no meaning to me, for I had always been. But I came to understand that they were children on the cusp of maturity.

I began to understand them as unique parts that made a whole; they could split apart and reform as needed.

There was the tall, skinny one, who hunched and hid in layers and layers of fabric. The pale one with the crooked smile. The one with the long hair and the high voice. The shy one who wore glasses. Others. I would learn their names eventually, but I won’t share them here. There’s no point.

Night after night I watched and learned, felt like maybe I was becoming one of them, and then I began to understand the feelings I had when they were here and when they left. I had been alone my entire existence, but it was only after I watched them that I felt an aching, wrenching loneliness. I longed to be one of many, after eons of being one and alone. 

I wanted to sit among them, to laugh and shout and roll my eyes. But I have no eyes. I must be so different from anything they have ever encountered; they could never accept me.

Not as I was, anyway.

But I could be something else.

I had reshaped and reformed myself over and over, to fit myself between the grains and fibers and drops and cells. Surely I could reshape myself into something like them.

I already had their words, their emotions, their understanding of the world. I knew their faces and their shapes and their movements. I could bend myself into something like that.

I knew I could, if I tried. If I really focused. But I’d never purposefully shaped myself before. I’d let my environment guide me. This would take time and effort. I’d need to hold the image of what I wished to become in my mind at all times, never let it go.

Watching them even more closely, I started picking out the parts I liked most and folding them into myself. This one’s height, another one’s bright eyes, the messy curls, the bubbling laugh. I molded them together into something I liked. I hoped they’d like it, too.

I expected it to be hard. I didn’t expect it to *hurt*. I should have, I suppose. Ripping my own flesh apart and forcing it into shapes it didn’t recognize could only be agonizing. Every last cell of me fought, every step of the way, as I pushed out four limbs, ten toes, ten fingers, a head. Growing my own hair, stretching out a nose, ears, lips.

And the clothes. The clothes hurt the most. I almost wanted to skip them altogether, but I knew I couldn’t – they all wore them, they’d notice if I didn’t. I searched the abandoned rooms for things to borrow, but everything I found had holes or was too big or smelled of rot. So I had to make them out of myself. I thought the pushing and stretching had been a torment, but this? Completely ripping parts of me away, forming them into scraps of wavering cloth? It was torture.

I lost consciousness a few times. I nearly lost my mind. But I did it. I looked like one of them.

Almost.

I kept noticing things that were *off*. My eyes were out of alignment, ever so slightly, but enough to create an unsettling effect. My laugh was too high-pitched, almost a scream. I hadn’t quite figured out walking, making it look like a natural movement. I practiced and practiced, observed and observed, knowing I needed to make myself perfect if I wanted to join them, to be one of them.

I was too big now to stay inside the walls, peering out of cracks. I had to hide in the unused rooms, stealing glances through doorways, from the shadows of the upstairs hallway.

They started to notice me. They heard it when the upstairs floorboards creaked beneath my weight, when I tried to practice breathing. They joked, said the place must be haunted, but I could hear the uneasiness in their voices.

I think one of them might even have seen me, a split-second glimpse of the back of me before I managed to dart silently around a corner. I heard the scream when I was out of sight. None of them dared venture up that staircase to find me, though. The one with the glasses called it a *deathtrap*.

They started coming less often. Every three or four days instead of every one or two. I was scaring them, sneaking like this. I had to emerge soon, pretend I belonged, or they would stop coming here altogether.

Many flaws still plagued me. My nose was crooked. I still had a bit of a limp, no matter how much I practiced my walking. My eyes were a color that I knew wasn’t quite right, that didn’t match any of theirs exactly. But I would just have to hope they wouldn’t notice in the dark. Or that others of their kind had these traits, too.

It had to be done, and soon. I was barely holding myself together in this unnatural state. Every inch of me hurt, every second of this effort was agony, and I had to make sure it was worth it. I had to be part of their whole.

So one day, as they were streaming into the house and settling down in the room, I snuck out of an upstairs window and dropped to the grass outside. It was a strange sensation, standing on the granules of dirt I was used to sliding between. I wondered if I could sense others like me, if I stood here long enough. But I’d never encountered another one in my entire existence.

I looked up and felt terror seize me at the vastness around me. Outside was even bigger than the room, bigger than the house, bigger than anywhere I’d ever been. I nearly lost control of my form, had to fight to keep my fingers, toes, ears, nose where they were.

Breaking free of my thoughts, and keeping close to the house, my anchor in the abyss, I crept around to the front door, the place where they always entered. It was open a crack. Their voices spilled out into the open, vanishing into the night.

I was terrified to enter, but I couldn’t stand it out there one moment longer, scared I would simply crumble and be carried off, just like the voices.

So I stepped inside. After the vastness of outside, this once horrifyingly large space felt almost small, secure.

They didn’t see me at first. I was still in the shadows, and they were distracted by a story the one with the crooked smile was telling. He stood at the far end of the room, speaking loudly, waving his arms exuberantly.

Then, suddenly, he stopped.

He stood frozen, staring directly at me, a look of utter confusion on his face. The smile dropped from his lips.

The others, noticing his expression, turned to look at me as well.

For a long time, they were silent.

Then the hunched, skinny one spoke. “Can we…help you?”

I opened my mouth, then paused. I still wasn’t quite sure about my voice. I’d practiced and practiced but sometimes it just wouldn’t do what I wanted.

But I had to say something. They were waiting.

So I spoke the words I’d repeated to myself again and again for weeks. “Hi! Hello. I am here. Can I join?”

I knew it was wrong the moment I said it. My voice squeaked and dropped erratically. They scrunched up their faces, trying to understand me, not sure if they wanted to.

“Are you lost?” asked the one with the long hair and the high voice.

I almost dropped my form again. Every part of me wanted to fall apart, sink between the floorboards and disappear into the earth. I had done this all wrong, and now they would never accept me.

Just before I let it happen, the shy one with the glasses spoke. “Oh! You’re new, right? One of the exchange students?”

The others visibly relaxed, accepting this as a reason for my strangeness, though I did not know what it meant.

I smiled, ever so slightly, and nodded. Probably best not to speak when I could avoid it.

“Cool,” said the skinny, hunched one. “You live near here?”

I nodded again, sensing this was the answer he wanted.

“Where?”

I pointed vaguely in the direction of the wall.

They laughed. I smiled, hoped it looked normal.

“Not so great with the English yet. Got it,” said the long-haired one with the high voice.

They gestured for me to sit, so I shuffled forward in a way that I hoped suggested timidity rather than inexperience.

They asked me many questions. I tried to answer them by nodding or shaking my head, using few words when I couldn’t avoid speaking.

Eventually they fell back into their usual patterns of speaking and I faded into the background. I watched again, observing their habits closer up, noting things I should practice when they left. Crinkling my eyes when I smiled, leaning towards people when they spoke, when to speak up and when to stay quiet.

I could tell they were still wary of me. Their glances when they thought I wasn't looking, their attempts to draw more information out of me. I tried to answer their questions without saying too much, but still they were suspicious. I needed to gain their trust.

Suddenly they were standing, preparing to leave, and they were asking me where I live and whether they could walk me home and I realized I’d made a mistake. Just as they all arrived through the front door, they all left that way too. I had to follow, or they would know something was wrong. But out there was so, so big.

I had to try, or it would all be over.

I stood and followed. 

One by one, they walked out the door. I was last.

I stepped out and nearly lost control of myself again. It would have been so very easy to let myself fall apart, to sink into the dirt and wrap myself around the soft, familiar particles.

But I didn’t. I followed. One step, two, three.

At least it was still dark.

I fell behind, trailed them until I found a convenient moment to duck between trees and rush back to the house.

I stumbled and grasped at branches. It would have been so much easier to travel through one of my usual means, but I worried that if I let go of that form I wouldn’t be able to get it back. It hurt too much the first time, and I feared I wouldn’t be able to go through it again. Even if I managed, I might come back wrong in ways the others would notice.

So I walked and walked and crawled and crawled until I was back in the cool, comforting dark and could curl up in the darkest corner and let parts of me relax. Not all the way. Just enough that I could rest.

They would be back in a few nights. I needed to rest, and practice. I needed to make myself better, indistinguishable from them.

Two nights later, they returned. I would do better this time. I had to.

I had realized that my silence was off-putting to them, almost as much as saying strange things, so I vowed to speak more. Hopefully they would attribute anything odd I said to being an exchange student. Whatever that was.

It was working. I could feel it. They were warming to me. I mostly just smiled and agreed with what they said and it was working.

They sat closer to me. Asked more questions. This was dangerous, but it was also thrilling. I was almost one of them.

The one with the glasses passed me one of their liquid-filled bottles and they watched, waiting for me to put it to my lips and swallow, as they did.

But I couldn’t. My mouth was not like their mouths. I didn’t know exactly how their bodies worked, but they swallowed and then the liquid disappeared somewhere. I didn’t know how to do this.

Their eyes were on me, and I knew this was part of how I would become *normal*.

So I didn’t think. I put the bottle to my mouth, threw my head back, and drank.

Except the liquid had nowhere to go, and it *burned*. It took nearly all of my energy to keep from falling apart at the pain. I kept expanding and expanding the inside of my mouth because otherwise the liquid would have had nowhere to go. I wanted to spit it out, to crawl down to the deepest depths of the ocean to put out the fire, but I couldn’t. They would laugh. They would think I was strange again.

So I took the last of my strength that I was not using to hold myself together and I drew the liquid into me, away from my mouth, and let it disperse amongst my cells. The burning was everywhere, but it was less. It was bearable, just about.

It was only then, after my pain had eased, that I heard the noise. They were laughing, yelling, slapping their hands together. It took me a moment to realize that they were in awe of me. It seemed I had drunk nearly half of the liquid, and they found this impressive.

A feeling was surging through me, what I had imagined joy must feel like but stronger.

I struggled to hold myself together -- the liquid had made me weak and sleepy and stupid. I could feel my eyes slipping out of alignment, my fingers and toes shrinking back into my limbs. But they did not notice, because the liquid had made them stupid too. I laughed with them, though I did not know what we were laughing at anymore.

I was one of them now. They accepted me. They were at ease around me, no longer watching me with suspicion or probing with questions. They talked to me like they talked to each other. Included me in their games and jokes. When I said something wrong or did something odd, we all laughed about it together.

We.

I was relaxed. Sometimes I even forgot that it hurt to hold my form. I belonged.

I had to stop drinking the liquid, though. It made me want to let go, show them my true form. I couldn’t let it happen, not after I had worked so hard. So I put the bottle to my lips but I did not drink.

This went on for weeks, until I sometimes forgot I was still not quite like them.

Then, one day, the one with the glasses told me that some of them had decided to hold a *seance*.

They could see I was confused, and they took turns trying to explain it to me. Eventually, I gathered that they wanted to communicate with a spirit, one they believed lived in the house.

“We’ve seen some weird shit in this house,” said the one with the crooked smile. “Though--huh. I guess not really since you’ve been here.”

“Ooooh,” said the one with glasses. “Are *you* the ghost? Are *you* the one who’s been haunting us?”

They laughed. I was too scared to make a sound.

“Don’t worry,” said the hunched, skinny one. “It’s just a game, really. Nothing’s going to happen.”

But I saw the one with the long hair and the high voice glance at him nervously, in a way that told me she wasn’t so sure about that.

I tried to back out, told them I was too scared of ghosts. But they taunted me until I felt I had no choice. I hoped the one with the long hair would join me, but she just looked at her shoes, and then the others started pushing the furniture against the walls and the conversation was over.

They all put their phones in another room – something about not wanting to interfere with any signals. They set up and lit candles all around the place, giving it a foreboding glow. The light was like little pins poking at my skin. Painful, but I could manage.

The one with the crooked smile drew a big, white circle on the ground, then some odd symbols inside of it. Then they all sat around the circle, leaving a space for me.

Reluctantly, I sat.

Slowly, and to my rapidly growing horror, they all reached out to hold each others’ hands.

I held mine clenched in my lap. I had never touched any of them before. I had no idea what would happen if I did.

But they were waiting.

So I closed my eyes as the others had, and I clasped the hands on either side of me.

It BURNED, it burned like the light, there was something about their flesh that my flesh did not like, but I would hold on, I would –

Suddenly, the burning stopped. I opened my eyes, confused, and then realized what had happened. 

The hands had been yanked out of mine.

Shrieks of pain came from either side of me.

It had burned them too. Badly. Some of their flesh was now red and bubbling where I had touched them, and tears streamed down their faces.

Everyone stared, backed away from me and toward the exit.

It was worse than that first day, when they all looked at me like they weren’t sure what I was.

Now they *knew* I was something else. And they were terrified of it.

Almost as one being, they shot away from me, towards the door, and started yelling.

“What the *fuck*?”

“What did you DO?”

“I KNEW it, I knew there was something not right –”

I tried to explain, but they were so loud when they spoke together, and I was starting to lose form, had to fight to keep it from happening rapidly, and I was losing my ability to speak even a few words at a time.

I told them, I said I just wanted to be one of them, because I liked them, but the words wouldn’t come out right.

I crawled toward them, but they screamed and ran from the building. I stumbled after.

A wall of fire roared up in front of me, scorching me. One of them must have kicked over a candle in their rush to get out.

The flames lashed at my flesh and I reeled back, my form falling apart completely. 

There were no other options left. I sank between the floorboards, back through the foundation cracks, and into the waiting earth.

I stayed there, safe but hurt and achingly lonely, for a long time. I was so very tired, and the burning never stopped. I think maybe it never will.

When I had regained some of my strength, I crawled back up.

It was dark. Night again. The building was now a pile of cold ash and charred wood. I found a few remaining bits of furniture and broken glass and that was all. No one was around.

But then I saw a glint between the floorboards, deep into one of the foundation cracks. I crawled down and discovered a phone, cracked but still working.

I pushed it higher, toward the surface, hoping maybe its owner would return for it, and I waited.

It was several nights before I heard the sound of feet crunching through the debris. The voices were soft, but I knew them. 

I inched up to the surface, but it was not quite dark yet. I could not emerge.

I tried to call out, but I no longer had a mouth. I had to wait.

I realized they were speaking in unison, words I could not understand. It was different from the way they usually spoke.

They start sprinkling something on the ground. I could not see what it was. But suddenly it rained down on my flesh, like little specks of dirt or sand but it was sharp, ripping at me, digging down and tearing parts of me away.

It hurt so much, more than the light, more than taking my human form. I could feel my cells being torn apart, and I knew if I did nothing I would be killed.

Surely they would stop if they knew they were hurting me, if I could just make them understand that I meant them no harm.

I should have burrowed back down into the earth. I know that now. But I couldn't let them go yet. And the light had mostly gone.

With every shred of energy I had left, I pushed myself out of the wreckage and into my human form.

As best I could, anyway. I knew my body wasn’t right. My face was lopsided and drooping. My limbs were entirely different lengths. There was a long, unsightly burn scar stretching from my left ear down to my abdomen. And the pain – it was worse than it had ever been.

I saw my friends in a circle around me, cowering back in fear. I saw the one with the crooked smile and I stumbled toward him, arms outstretched, and tried to cry out, but my voice was wrong. It was harsh, and far too loud. Made me sound like a beast.

The one with the crooked smile thrust an object out in front of himself, one long, vertical stick with a shorter stick running perpendicular across its middle. I had never seen this before, didn’t know why he wanted me to have it, but I reached for it–

He stumbled backward, and the others screamed at me, told me to leave and never come back. They started throwing the sharp specks at me again and I HOWLED.

I did not know I could make that sound, it just came out of me, in part because of the pain. But also because I realized what was happening. It wasn’t just terror on their faces. It was hate. There was no chance for understanding there, for peace, because they did not see one of themselves. They saw a monster.

Whatever joy they once made me feel was gone. For the first time I felt despair, and it ripped and dug at me the way the specks did, shredding a part of me I did not know existed.

They wanted to kill me. Nothing would change their minds.

I tried to descend, but I couldn't. Not because I was tired or weak, but because parts of me were no longer capable of it. It was something to do with the specks. They were ingrained in me, creating tears in my flesh that could not be healed.

My home, my safe, dark places, were lost to me.

I was confused. Terrified. Devastated. Too many feelings all at once, overwhelming me. If I had known it was possible to feel this much, I never would have tried it.

I knew I couldn't stay there. They would not stop until I was destroyed.

If I could not sink into the earth, there was only one option.

I pushed my form up and out, groaning in agony, until I was a hulking beast twice their height. They gaped at me, unmoving.

I opened my mouth and ROARED, and then I charged as fast as I could out of the circle.

They leaped out of my way, their hate momentarily overwhelmed by fear. I ran.

It was not long before I was lost; I had never travelled over the surface before. Around me there were other houses, paved surfaces, strange metal structures – nothing familiar. So I kept going, trying not to think about the openness, the nothingness, around me.

And then I saw them: trees. Lots of them, growing close together and forming a thick canopy overhead. I ran for them.

Among the trees, it was dark. Calm. Quiet. They felt like a shield, a barrier between me and those who sought to destroy me. I couldn't bury myself among the fibers. But as the trees grew closer together and the undergrowth became thicker, I felt my fear begin to ebb away. I could think again. And I knew I needed somewhere to hide. I could hear their voices at the edge of the trees; they were deciding whether to come after me now or wait until daybreak. Like I was an evil to be rooted out of their lives, out of the earth.

I found a tree that had been partially upended, creating a deep hollow underneath, where it had once been rooted into the dirt. I shrank myself as small as I could and climbed far inside, curling up in the darkest corner. Finally, I could rest, regroup.

I thought about my errors, the ones that had brought me there. I had seen joy in these humans, and togetherness, but that was only what they chose to show on the surface. Underneath, they harbored hatred of anything not like them. They were unreasonable, volatile, violent. They had drawn me out of my old life and made it so I could never go back.

And that's when I decided. They thought that they hunted me, that I was their prey to find and snuff out. But that was not how this would go.

They decided I was a monster, so that was what I would be. I would find them where they felt safest and bring about their nightmares. I could no longer sink into the earth or the trees, but I could still change my form. I could squeeze into unlikely places, crawl out and assume a beastly form. I couldn't physically hurt them without scarring myself further, but I could drive them to madness, use the harm they caused me to bring them to ruin. I would not stop until they could no longer cause the kind of harm they visited upon me.

As for the rest of you – you are not my enemies. Not yet.

I am not so shallow as my one-time companions. I will not condemn all of you because of the ugliness I saw in them.

But I will be watching. Waiting to see if this brutal hatred resides in you too.

I will live in the dark places, the ones where you never look.

I will be the whispers you hear between walls, the creaking floorboards at the dark end of the hallway, the eyes you feel on you when you are alone, the snapping twigs and rustling leaves you hear when you are lost in the woods.

I will be watching to see which of you seek to make monsters out of others, and I will not be kind to those of you who do.

You will not see me. But I will see you.
