I’m not sure if this is the right place for this, but I need to get it off my chest.

I work in an office building in Denmark, and something happened to me last winter that I’ve never been able to explain. I’ve always been a skeptic — the kind of guy who rolls his eyes at ghost stories — but this experience left a mark on me.

Since then, I’ve heard whispers from others in the building. A few coworkers have mentioned strange sounds, unexplained power outages, and that feeling of being watched when no one else is around. I haven’t told them what I saw — not yet — but I’m considering asking around.

If this post gets any interest, I’ll try to collect their stories too. For now, here’s mine.

I’m Danish, and I’ve always considered myself rational — maybe *too* rational. I don’t believe in ghosts, spirits, or the supernatural. That stuff always felt childish to me. Scandinavian folklore, with all its trolls and forest spirits and shadow creatures? Interesting, sure, but fiction. Fairytales for long winters.

I’m writing this because something happened to me last year that I can’t explain. I’ve buried it deep, tried to forget, but it’s still there — like a splinter in the back of my brain. And after overhearing others in the building whispering about “weird sounds” and “feeling watched,” I figured maybe I’m not crazy after all. Or at least not alone.

Let me start from the beginning.

I work part-time as a student assistant for a small electronics firm based in Aarhus. It’s nothing fancy — just a couple of engineers and me, working on embedded systems and random prototypes. We rent one of many identical offices in a huge building just outside town. It’s one of those commercial complexes where a dozen unrelated companies lease rooms along one long, narrow hallway. There’s a shared kitchen, some bathrooms in the middle, but otherwise it’s all beige walls, gray carpet, and buzzing ceiling lights.

The first weird experience happened not long after I started. I had just gotten used to the place and was pulling my first weekend shift to catch up on some testing. It was a Saturday night, mid-November. Rainy, quiet. No one else in the building. Just me and the whir of a soldering iron.

I wrapped up sometime after 10 PM and stepped into the hallway to go home.

It was pitch black.

The motion sensors that normally turn the lights on didn’t react. I stood there, waving my hand like an idiot. Nothing. I checked my phone — battery at 12%. Great.

I turned on the flashlight and started walking. My footsteps were muffled by the thick carpet, and the air smelled… stale. Like old paper and something metallic. About halfway down the hallway, I heard something behind me.

*Tap… tap… tap.*

I turned around fast.

Nothing.

Just darkness.

I told myself it was probably the building settling. Old pipes. Maybe even a mouse. But something about it felt deliberate. Slow. Pacing.

Then I passed one of the unused offices. Door cracked open. Just a sliver.

I froze.

I was *sure* that door had been shut earlier. I would’ve noticed — it had a cracked frosted window, and the light from my phone hit it just right.

Then I heard it.

Inside the office. A scratching sound. Like nails on plastic. Repeated. Rhythmic. Almost like… clicking?

I leaned in, against every instinct, and whispered, “Hello?”

Silence.

Then a voice — a whisper so low I almost thought I imagined it — said:

*"Don’t come closer.*"

That voice stopped me cold. It wasn’t just the words — it was the tone. Flat. Almost mechanical. Like something trying to *imitate* a human, but not quite getting it right. There was no emotion in it. No urgency. Just cold instruction.

I took a step back.

And that’s when the scratching started again. Louder now. Faster. From inside the office.

Then something moved behind the frosted glass.

Just a shadow. Thin. Wrong.

Too tall. Shoulders bent forward, almost hunched, like it couldn’t stand upright. I could see the shape of its head — long, narrow — and something that looked like *antlers* sprouting from it. They scraped the top of the doorframe as it shifted.

I bolted.

No hesitation. I turned and ran down the hallway toward the elevator. I didn’t look back — not yet. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would burst. As I reached the elevator, I slammed the call button and — of course — nothing happened.

Dead.

I turned to take the stairs.

And that’s when I heard it. The footsteps again. But this time not behind me.

**Above me.**

Like something was crawling — no, *dragging itself* — along the ceiling.

Slow.

Scrape. Scrape. Tap.

I sprinted down the stairwell. Three floors. I don’t remember breathing. I didn’t stop until I was out of the building, standing in the freezing rain, shaking.

I told myself I was hallucinating. Sleep-deprived. Overworked. I didn’t even tell my coworkers. Just said I forgot my charger and left early.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about what I saw. That silhouette. The voice. The antlers.

It nagged at me.

So I started digging.

It took a while, but I found something strange.

There was an old article from the 70s about a man who worked night shifts at a printing office in the same building — back when it was owned by a Danish industrial group. He was found dead in the hallway. Cardiac arrest, they said.

But the article mentioned one odd detail:

“The man appeared to have been crawling when he collapsed. Scratch marks were found along the walls and ceiling nearby, which investigators attributed to the movement of office furniture during the incident.”

Except no furniture had been moved.

And the man’s last known words, heard over a crackly landline call with his wife?

*"There’s something here, and it has antlers."*

After reading that article, something clicked in the back of my mind. Not in a good way — more like a door unlocking inside a dark room. A door I didn’t know was there.

I started researching Scandinavian folklore. Not the pop culture stuff, but the older, stranger stories. The ones whispered in isolated villages. The ones people don’t put in children’s books.

That’s when I found it.

**The Gjenganger.**

In most accounts, it’s described as a restless spirit — a dead soul returning to punish the living. But in rare, more regional myths — especially from Jutland — it's said to *change*. To take a new form after years of wandering. Long limbs. Gaunt body. Twisted antlers. And worst of all, a voice that mimics speech, but has *no soul* behind it.

They’re not just ghosts. They’re *echoes* — hollow imitations of people who died in suffering, too violent or too sudden to move on. They don’t haunt because they want revenge. They haunt because they’ve *forgotten how to be anything else*.

And the hallway?

Long. Repetitive. Mirror-like. A perfect trap. A place you can walk for minutes and still feel like you're in the same spot. Just like the liminal woods described in those myths — but made from concrete and carpet instead of pine and moss.

I think whatever I saw that night… *used to be someone*. Maybe that printing office guy. Maybe someone even older. But now it’s *stuck*. Looping the same territory. Mimicking life. Whispering warnings it doesn’t understand itself.

I haven’t worked late since that night. Won’t even stay past sunset.

But a couple of weeks ago, I was leaving around 5 PM in the winter dusk, and I passed by that same office door again. The one that had been cracked open.

It was closed now. Locked tight.

But someone had scratched something into the wall just beside it.

Not in pen. Not with a knife.

With *fingernails*.

Six deep, desperate gouges…  
…next to a single word:

**“HØRER.”** *- “It listens.”*

Other people in the building have mentioned weird things too. Whispers. Lights flickering. That feeling like you’re being watched, even when you’re alone.

I haven’t shared this story with anyone there yet. I don’t want to sound insane.

But if anyone reading this has had something similar happen — in this building or another — I want to hear it.

Because whatever’s walking that hallway after dark?

It’s still there.

And I don’t think it’s done yet.
