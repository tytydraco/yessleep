Hello all, I am at my wit’s end and I’m not sure what to do anymore. I’ve been through countless Reddit threads and WebMD pages on ingrown hairs at this point, and seeing the doctor, as I suspected, didn’t help my situation either. Told me to just let it grow out. I thought I’d make my own post and hopefully get some new advice.



I’ll start from when I first noticed it. I work as a lifeguard so it’s socially mandatory that I keep myself clean shaven. Everyday in the shower I shave my legs, armpits and bikini area. Thorough exfoliation, sensitive skin shaving cream, and a liberal amount of lotion typically keep the ingrowns away. After two previous summers of this, I’ve got shaving down to a science. Though my hair is light, I get dark body hairs on my thighs and stomach occasionally, which I have had no issue plucking out, until about two weeks ago.



I woke up around 10 for my noon shift. I usually shower after my shift so I don’t sleep covered in disgusting lake water, so the shaving part had been completed the night before.I pulled my skimpy red uniform off the shower rod where it was drying and put it on. As I was pulling up the tight bottoms I noticed a dark hair growing out of my stomach right underneath my bellybutton. Nothing unusual, except it was about a centimeter long, and I was sure I had not noticed it before on my nightly body check. 



I grabbed the tweezers and I, slowly and methodically, pulled the hair out of my skin. Though only a centimeter stuck out, as I pulled it, it revealed about another two centimeters that was trapped underneath my skin. I held it in the tweezers and examined it in awe. I supposed it was ingrown and had just broken the skin overnight. I have a small obsession with skin extraction and pimple popping videos, so I was quite impressed with my personal extraction. I should’ve taken a video. Anyway, I put the hair in the trash and continued to get ready for my shift.



I thought about the hair again that night as I examined my naked, freshly hairless body in the foggy bathroom mirror. I made sure to check more thoroughly for other dark hairs but found none. It’s normal as you age, to get random, thick dark hairs. I figured as I was in the middle of my twenties, it was about that time. I went to bed with that self reassurance.



The next morning is when I started to worry. Most normal people wouldn’t even have given the hair a second thought just, “that’s weird.” they’d pluck it and move on. When I took my bed shirt off, my eyes went immediately to my stomach. And it was back. The same length, about a centimeter long. I ran my finger over it, the hair shaft was rigid and growing up towards my bellybutton, which was the opposite direction of the soft peach fuzz that surrounded it. I went at it with the tweezers again, but I was too hasty and didn’t pull the whole hair out. It snapped right at the surface of the skin. Fuck.



I spent my shift at the lake pacing the boardwalk, staring off into space. Every now and then I’d run my hand over my stomach to feel the small bump. I’d fruitlessly pick at it until it was sore, hoping I could maybe dig it out with my fingernail. Once it created a big red spot from irritation, I held my tube a bit higher up my body to hide the result of my obsession from the kids and other lifeguards. But it was mostly to block myself from picking further. I pinned the tube tight to my stomach with my elbows and paced, pretending to scan the water. Good thing no kids decided to try to drown that day. My thoughts were completely occupied.



There was nothing there when I looked over my abdomen after my shift. Just some light redness from my picking. That’s when my boyfriend noticed, we’ll call him Jay.



Jay is the rock in my hurricane of a life. He is quick to reassure me at any moment when he can sense my anxious obsessions taking control. He asked what I was doing.



“Nothing.” I replied, meeting his gaze in the mirror. He did not meet my eyes and instead were fixed on my hands that were pushing and prodding at my skin.



“What are you doing with your stomach?”



I hesitated. It was so silly. I always felt silly when he caught me spiraling over something menial.



“I’m— well I had an ingrown hair here. I tried to pull it this morning but it didn’t come all the way out. I guess I’ve just been messing with it all day.”



Jay grabbed my hands away from my stomach and pulled me into a hug. His comforting scent sent a wave of calmness through my body. I clung on to him and we stood there in the bathroom until I pulled away.



He walked over to the bed and threw me a clean shirt. “Put this on and stop messing with it. It’ll grow some more then you can pull it out again, right?”



I nodded and put the shirt on. My hands hovered over my stomach and Jay shot me a look. I wanted to believe his reassuring words, as I knew they were true. It will grow back. But that thought made my stomach drop. What if this is my new normal? What if it keeps growing back every day? I’ll have to pluck it every day. And if I keep picking at it? I surely will have a scar, then the hair will grow under the scar, then I can’t pluck it and then… and then…



And then I fell asleep, but sleep is not so peaceful for me. My anxious thoughts do not subside, instead they become more vivid, and my dream self is always convinced that what she’s going through is real. That night was the first hair nightmare (night-hair? hair-mare?) in a series of recurring dreams that plagued my sleeping mind.



They are mostly the same, but with slight differences each night. The hair would grow out of different places, and sometimes it would be the first time I noticed it, but other times I was already deep in obsession. I would lay down and grab the hair with my tweezers and pull. I would keep pulling at it until it came out or broke off. 



But one time it didn’t come out or break. I kept pulling, and pulling, and pulling. My skin lifted up into a peak as I tugged on the long, wiry strand. I started to wrap it around my hand as I pulled harder and faster. The pain was sharp, centered to that one follicle, but I kept pulling. I felt the blood rush from my face and I broke into a cold sweat. Suddenly, I couldn’t pull anymore. I tugged hard at it which sent a wave of pain through my body. My vision started to black out as my nervous system was shutting down. Just then, through the fluctuating blackness and the excruciating pain, I felt something give. I kept pulling and felt a wet warmth wash over my torso. Though my vision was blurry, I knew what I did. But that did not stop me. I continued to pull with a wet, red fist of hair, until I finally reached the warm, squishy texture of my small intestine.



Jay woke me up from that dream, saying I had been gasping for air and excessively sweating. I laid my hand over my stomach as the sharp pain my brain was telling me I was feeling washed away. I did not fall asleep again that night.



Over the next week after my first night-hair (sorry). I took Jay’s advice and did not touch it so I could let it grow. I even had to resort to putting a bandaid over the spot so I wouldn’t be tempted. People at work noticed that I was wearing the one-piece uniform and not my typical bikini. I lied and said I got a tattoo on my torso and I’m trying to protect it from the sun. Of course they asked for pictures, and of course I didn’t have any. Such a dumb lie. I distracted myself by looking at Pinterest for torso tattoo ideas. Stupid.



The hair grew. But it did not grow out, it grew up. I could see the thin grey line going up and curving to the left of my bellybutton. It had only been several days and it was already around three inches long. I show Jay.



“Goddamn!” He exclaimed, which did not ease my nerves. He doubled back quickly. “I’m really sorry, it’s just– I’ve never seen one that long before.”



“What do I do?” I whimpered. Tears started to form in my eyes.



“Have you tried… using a needle to pick it out?”



“You told me not to touch it!”



“Well, it seems like it’s stuck under there,” Jay said. My heart started fluttering as the panic built up in my chest. 



“-- which shouldn’t be cause for concern!” He added quickly. “You can clearly see it, so that means it’s only under a couple layers of skin. It shouldn’t even bleed.”



My thoughts were circling like a building storm. “What-if’s” clouded my head until the tears finally rained down my face.

  


“I can do it for you?” Jay suggested, desperately trying to find a solution to get me back to normal.



I shake my head hard and cover the hair with my hand, almost protecting it. 



“Why don’t you go to the doctor, then? They could get it out no problem.”



The doctor. I don’t go to the doctor. White rooms and cold fingers were the source of my childhood nightmares. My parents had to physically force me or trick me into going to the doctors for regular childhood things like shots and cold symptoms. The doctor’s caused a real rift between me and my parents because I refused to be seen for my anxiety. I’ve got it under control. I don’t go to the doctor’s. 



I was so sure I’d never go to the doctors that I refused the health care benefits my teaching job offered, and there’s no way the summer camp offered benefits to the minimum-wage, part-time lifeguards.



I swallow a lump in my throat. I softly say to Jay, “I don’t have health insurance.”



He looks at me bewildered. I guess my fear of seeing doctors never came up in our relationship before. He sighed and looked at me, who was a shirtless puddle on the bed.



“I think you have some options, let me do some research.” Jay did what he could to soothe my tears before opening his laptop and getting to work. I wept silently beside him for a bit until I drifted off to sleep.



It was the middle of the night, probably around 2 or 3, when a hair nightmare woke me up, which is typical at this point. I put a hand over my belly and felt around, I had picked the scab off already which left nice, smooth skin behind. But I knew it was under there. I had to get it out.



I creep silently out to the living room to gather my supplies: a sewing needle, a lighter, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol, then close myself in the bathroom.



I sat in the bathtub and placed my tools on the side of the tub. First cleaning off my stomach with the alcohol, then running the flame from the lighter over the needle, then lastly rubbing the needle down with more alcohol. I stare at the gray line that traced up my stomach. Where should I make the insertion?



 I chose the middle, closer to the follicle, so I don’t risk it breaking off somewhere. I can pull the end out first, then pull it out of the follicle. My plan made me feel confident, in control.



I move the needle so that it’s touching my skin, then I start to pick. I broke through two layers of skin, it started to lightly bleed. I felt a small wave of nausea, but I decided to push through. I moved the needle slightly parallel to my skin, until it intersected, and penetrated a layer, then pulled up. This did nothing but pick away the first few layers of skin until I had an incision about as long as the tip of my fingernail. There was a bit of blood but I would wipe it away with the paper towel soaked in alcohol. It stung, then I would go deeper.



Something about this sickened me, but the determination to rid my body of this disgusting hair trampled my building nausea. I kept picking and picking, wiping the blood away after each pick. There was more and more blood that gushed out of the self-inflicted wound as I went deeper. The towel was soaked heavier with my blood than the alcohol, it turned a pink-orange hue and stopped stinging when I wiped. I ditched the towel completely and let the blood flow down the left side of my torso, dripping softly on the bottom of the plastic bathtub.



Pick, pull, pick, pull, pick…my needle is met with resistance and I pull up a small loop of hard black hair. I felt a sense of euphoria as I finished my gruesome mission. Time to get it out, slowly. I didn’t bring my phone to record the extraction, dammit. Though this level of self mutilation may not be allowed on the internet. Besides, I was feeling pretty embarrassed at just how far I felt I had to go to rid myself of a little piece of hair.



I started to pull the end opposite of the starting point. It was much harder than I thought it would be. There was quite a bit of resistance, but it did not break. I followed the end of the gray line with my eyes as it slithered out of my bloody incision. I admired its length before I started to pull on the other end. So slowly. So carefully. I see its short gray line slide up my skin and out of the wound. 



Relief. I let myself relax for a second before studying the hair some more. Jay and I measured it later, 5 inches. I felt like I should frame it. Here it is everyone! The source of my anxiety: defeated, framed, and hung above my mantle. I ran my fingers along the hair shaft, wicking blood off it. It had a slight curl to it, like the start of a spiral. I guess that would explain why it got so ingrown. It grew and curled in on itself underneath my skin.



I turned my attention to the bloody mess I had made of myself and the tub. I soaked the off-orange paper towel with more alcohol and held it to the wound that ended up being around half my index finger in length. It stung as the chemical seeped into the cut and killed any evil bacteria in there, or whatever alcohol does. I stumbled to the medicine cabinet, made sure not to drip any blood on the floor and patched myself up with a couple of bandaids.



I wiped the bathtub down with water and a towel, making a mental note to bleach the shit out of it later. I changed my panties, of which the backside was soaked in blood, and shoved the evidence deep into the laundry basket. I put my bed shirt back on and drifted to sleep, hoping to have dreams of victory. Unfortunately that was not the case. It was this night I had that horrible, awful hair extraction dream I mentioned.



Jay got up before me and left for work. I woke up at my usual time with a horrible headache and feeling unusually hungry. I drank a glass of milk as my bagel toasted. I poured another glass of milk, drank that and ate my bagel in about 5 minutes.



I felt insatiable, but I continued with my pre-shift routine. I thought about wearing my bikini, but forgot about the band-aids and my lack of a torso tattoo. Ugh. I took the still slightly damp red once piece off the shower rod and started squeezing myself into it. I looked down at my stomach and I gasped in horror. A thin gray line began right where it always does and drew up my belly underneath the bandages. I ripped the bandaids off and tried to move the still fresh wound around to see how long this persistent hair had grown. The gray line seemed to stop under the wound, but appeared to fade away instead of a hard cut off like I was used to seeing. Did it grow deeper into my skin?



The waves of nausea flooded through my body viciously. I dropped to my knees in front of the toilet and threw up thick white liquid and chunks of bagel. The toilet reeked of spoiled milk which made me continue to throw up. Through the dizziness I flushed the toilet to get rid of the smell, then I sat on my knees as my world rotated around me.



I really thought about work at this moment. Should I still go in? I became aware of my state. Naked, except for the red one piece suit that only made it halfway up my thighs, chin and hair strung with milky vomit, and a two and a half inch long unhealed gash below my bellybutton. I remember finding this funny.



The next thing I remember is Jay shaking me awake in a panic. He was on the phone with, what I imagined was emergency services. 



“I don’t need an ambulance!” was the first thing I said. I probably did need one, but I most definitely could not foot the bill. My fear-fueled adrenaline kicked in and I sat up and grabbed Jay’s wrist that was holding the phone. “We can go to urgent care, tell them I don’t need an ambulance!”



Jay stared at me with wide eyes. Who knows how long I’ve been passed out here in front of him? “Did you hear that?” He said to the person on the phone.



The phone exchange lasted a bit longer before Jay hung up. “What the fuck is going on?” He said as calmly as his panicked body would allow. I knew he wasn’t angry with me, just scared.



I explained the botched surgery I performed on myself last night as Jay wrapped me in a towel and started trying to remove the dried vomit from my face with a warm washcloth. I explained my hunger, rapid eating, sudden realization, then the resulting throw up and pass out.



“Let me get you some clothes, we’re going to urgent care right now. Can you stand?” He helped me up and I leaned against the bathroom wall. I was able to dress myself but I had to hold onto him when walking to the car. 



I think I was too delusional in the car ride to throw a tantrum about being taken to the doctor, but once we walked into the bright white lobby packed with faceless patients, I became *very* aware of where I was.



I woke up on the exam table. Blinding light, quickly shadowed by three heads leaning over me. I met Jay’s eyes, then those of the two strangers, who turned out to be the doctor and the nurse. Jay put his hand on my face, which now I know was an attempt to block my vision of the IV drip in my arm. 



I breathed heavily as I searched the features on Jay’s face. I could feel the pressure in my arm but I pretended not to. My heart was racing, I was afraid. Jay was afraid. I was making him afraid.



“Your blood sugar was extremely low, but I imagine that’s from not eating.” The doctor turned her face to me as she stood at her computer. “We’re going to keep an eye on that ingrown hair, I’ll refer you to a dermatologist to take a look at it.”



“B-but– It’s growing. Inside me. You have to take it out.” I reply hoarsely.



“It’s a stubborn one, for sure. I see you already tried to.” She motioned towards my abdomen.



My hand instinctively went to the spot. I could feel it was covered with bandages.



“You did a number on yourself. Any deeper you would’ve needed some stitches.” She walked over to me with a folder full of papers. “So I’ll do a couple things here, I’ll refer you to a dermatologist, as well as a psychiatrist for your compulsions.”



My compulsions? I thought. My head was too foggy to comprehend what that really meant. I simply nodded and took the folder from her. She talked to me, but mostly Jay, through the next steps of treatment and what we can do at home in the meantime. Exfoliations, ointments, warm compresses, all the stuff I already saw on the internet.



I stared off into the vastness of the dashboard on the car ride home. I gripped the folder that was, apparently, the solution to my problem. How much was all of that shit? How much more would it be? I have to get on the school’s healthcare plan soon, then I can go see the dermatologist and the psychiatrist. But can I afford to wait? What if this thing is really digging inside me, penetrating my muscles, my organs, my bones…



Jay whipped quickly into McDonald’s drive thru line, snapping me out of my tunneling thoughts. “We need to get you a big, fat, juicy burger! No more passing out! I’ll get you whatever you want. Go nuts.”



I went nuts. I followed what my stomach was telling me it needed. It needed two big macs and a ten piece large mcnugget meal with a coke, light ice. Oh, and an apple pie. On a typical late night McD run, I'd barely finish my fries but this time there was not a crumb left for Jay to forage.



He observed me from across the kitchen as I feasted. When I finished, I finally looked up at him. He met my gaze with a kind smile. It reassured me. Maybe it’ll be okay.



I went ahead and called up my work the next morning to explain, but my manager had already heard the story from Jay. I have the next three days off.



So here we are, day two of my ingrown hair-induced sabbatical, and I decide to put into words my chaotic past two weeks. I’m looking for any solutions or home remedies to try in the week leading up to my dermatology appointment! If you all are interested I can make an update post after my appointment as well. 



Thanks!
