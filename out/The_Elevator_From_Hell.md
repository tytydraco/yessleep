My friend invited me to her wedding and I have known her since I was in 2nd grade. I was the maid of honor because her sister died from a brain tumor. The wedding was amazing and the groom I got to embarrass with my speech. I had a couple drinks. Hell what am I kidding I probably drank a whole bottle. I was very drunk and when I stumbled back to the hotel I could barely make my way to the elevator. 

Once I got in I drunkenly hit three numbers instead of one. 524. Those numbers have ruined my life. On one of the floors the elevator stopped. In my drunken state I didn’t notice. A woman walked in. Once I saw her I was instantly aware of my surroundings. I started panicking. The woman’s face made me want to vomit. She had no eyes and the eye sockets were bleeding. She flashed me a smile. Those pointy blood stained teeth showed. Her body was long and thin. She was wearing a wedding dress. Not just any wedding dress. My friends wedding dress.

She didn’t press any numbers. I tried not to look at her but sometimes I found my eyes wondering over there. She once caught me staring and told me it was very rude to stare at someone. Her voice was raspy as if she had smoked all her life. Her words were smooth though. I soon realized it had been 20 minutes since the elevator stopped. I looked at the buttons and they were all pressed. All of them were glowing a dark red. I looked up at the thing that tells me what floor we are on. Floor 78. I started freaking out. There are only 8 levels in the hotel how the hell am I on floor 78. All of a sudden the elevator lights started flickering and the woman said goodbye and stepped through the closed doors. 

Floor 99. The next floor a man walked on. I knew he was going to be just as hideous and disgusting. The man had no teeth and eyes so black I didn’t think he even had them. He greeted me and tipped his hat. I gave a weak smile and waved. He was wearing the grooms suit.

I looked at the floor, floor 186. If I was correct he would get off at floor 199. Then a new creature from hell would join me. 

I was correct and at floor 199 he gave me a nod and walked off. The next floor a woman joined and she was wearing one of the bridesmaids dress. She was as pale as a ghost and had blood dripping down her arms and legs and face. She gave me a look and rolled her eyes. She scoffed and looked away from me. 

I didn’t care but by now I was used to the monsters. I was getting hungry and felt a gnawing sensation in my stomach. The girl got off and another bridesmaid got on. This time she has food and drinks. She has a big cooler and she smiled and waved at me. I knew this might be my only chance to get food so I asked her if she could give me the cooler. She was hesitant at first but I somehow convinced her. She got off and waved a new bridesmaid got on.

This cycle continued with the groomsmen too. There was 5 bridesmaids and groomsmen and when I realized this was the 5th groomsmen I thought this hell was going to be over. On floor 1299 I was excited. He would get off and I could finally have my normal life back. He got off and the elevator hit floor 1300. The grooms mother joined me. I was shocked. That’s when I realized. I was going to see every single person at that wedding in this elevator. I started to cry. They invited 226 people. Not including babies.
