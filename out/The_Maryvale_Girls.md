Does a legend ever die?

I have heard it said none of us ever really die until we are forgotten. It is not when we breathe our last, but when we are completely forgotten—our faces, our names, our personalities—that we are truly gone.

No matter how long I live, I will never forget them. My guilt will not let me. It is because of that that the girls’ mission will be accomplished.

They will never be forgotten.

And they will live forever.

My story begins fifty years ago.

In early 1973, I moved with my family to Maryvale, a small suburb on the outskirts of Norwich, Connecticut, for my father’s new job. Although I was adamant I did not want to transfer to a new school in the middle of my senior year, I could do nothing about it. I said goodbye to my friends at St. Agnes’ in my hometown and enrolled in Resurrection Catholic High School in Maryvale shortly after the spring semester began in late March 1973.

It is never fun to be the new girl in school, and Resurrection High was no exception. I found the students aloof and rude and the nuns who taught us were strict, but dedicated. However, I did meet someone with whom I connected. Her name was Eleanor, but she went by “Nora.” We shared many of the same classes and interests, so Nora made it her duty to introduce me to Resurrection High, its teachers, students, and history.

Sister Mary Margaret was a recovering alcoholic who once sang a Peggy Lee ballad to her class during a relapse, Susan Reynolds was being transferred to an all–girls’ school because she was pregnant with John Willard’s baby, and Jim Miller once dropped acid and streaked through the gymnasium during a pep rally.

None of these stories even compared with those girls.

They were the ubiquitous group of popular girls, which probably exists in every school across the United States, but they seemed to be much more than that. They were like the Vestal Virgins of ancient Rome—popular, beautiful, almost mythical—and they seemed to leave the school in awe.

Watching them talk in a group around one of their lockers, I asked Nora, “Who are they?”

“Oh,” Nora rolled her eyes. “That’s Nancy Thomas and her friends.”

“Don’t you like them?”

“Not particularly,” Nora answered. “But I suppose my tour wouldn’t be complete without them.”

She pointed to each of the five girls individually: Nancy, the undisputed leader of the group, was blonde with dark brown eyes; Lisa, the second–in–command, wore her dark hair in a pageboy style; Kathy and Tricia each had red hair, but while Kathy’s was a dark red, Tricia’s hair was more of a strawberry blonde. Debra, the school gossip, rounded out the group with her shoulder–length blonde hair.

What made these girls so fascinating to the students and teachers of Resurrection High? Who were they? And why did I feel even myself drawn to them?

After the bell rang, Nancy and her friends began walking in the direction of the classroom, and I was brought back to reality by Nora, who was dragging me down the hallway toward our English class with Sister Agnes.

As Sister Agnes droned on, I glanced behind me, and I saw Nancy and her friends seated near the back of the classroom. Nancy was passing notes surreptitiously to Lisa while intermittently looking in my direction. *Are they talking about me?* Lisa read the note passed to her by Nancy, and she looked at me briefly before returning her attention to the class. *Why would they talk about me?* I did not know, but I was going to find out.

The bell rang, and Sister Agnes dismissed class for lunch. As we were walking out of the classroom, Nancy approached me from behind, and she asked, “Aren’t you new here?”

Nora and I exchanged a glance, but I chose to talk with Nancy while Nora continued walking out of the classroom and toward the cafeteria.

“Yes,” I answered. “My family and I just moved here. My name’s Marianne.”

“I’m Nancy,” she smiled. “This is Lisa, Kathy, Tricia, and Debra.”

“Hi,” I said. The girls waved at me before Nancy continued speaking.

“You should have lunch with us.”

I was surprised by her proposal, so I did not know what to say. *Should I?* Nora had told me stories about Nancy and her friends. They were not exactly bullies, but they were not particularly nice to everyone, especially Nora and her friends. What if they were playing an elaborate prank on me? I could see Nancy was starting to feel awkward standing there, so I hastily answered, “That’d be nice.”

“Cool,” Nancy said. With her entourage in tow, we walked to the cafeteria, and then to the table they designated as theirs. Nora looked at me from her table, her eyes wide in surprise, while I tried to mouth the words, “‘I don’t know.’”

After we sat down at their table, Debra said, “Did any of you see Tony Ribisi this morning? I heard he and Donna Corcoran are a ‘thing.’”

“Really?” Tricia asked.

“What about Caroline Lane? I thought they were going steady,” Kathy added.

“She’s easy,” Lisa interjected. “He wanted only one thing, and she gave it to him.”

“It’s not a surprise,” Nancy said. “We all know she’s a slut.”

The girls chittered and laughed as they talked about most of our classmates. I kept my piece, but I will admit I was appalled by how casually and cruelly they insulted other girls. The mystique was gone. These girls were not some goddesses to be worshiped in the Temple of Resurrection High. They were self–absorbed, vain snobs. Nothing more, nothing less. I decided then that I did not want to be associated with them.

After school was dismissed, I started walking home, but I was stopped by Nancy.

“Oh,” I said. “Do you need anything?”

“I talked with the girls about it, and we wanted to ask if you’ll join us everyday for lunch. What do you say?”

There was an awkward pause before I answered, “I’m sorry, but I don’t think I should.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m not a good fit for your group.”

“Why?”

“I don’t like gossiping about other people.”

“Oh,” Nancy laughed. “You don’t have to do that. Debra does enough of that for all of us.”

“I don’t think you understand.”

“How?”

“I don’t think we’re compatible.”

“So?. . . .” Nancy trailed off.

Exasperated, I said, “I don’t like you. I don’t want to be friends with you. You and your friends are nothing more than hateful, hurtful, mean girls.”

“Really?” Nancy scoffed. “Do you think you’re better than us?”

“No. . . .” I stammered, but Nancy interrupted me, “Eat dirt and die, trash.”

She shoved me out of her way, and after I took a breath, I continued walking home. Nora ran to catch up with me, and I told her about my run–in with Nancy.

“Good for you,” Nora said. “You’re better than them anyway.”

“No, I’m not,” I replied. “I shouldn’t have been so blunt. It wasn’t kind of me.”

“You stood up for yourself. That’s a good thing, Marianne.”

“Is it?”

As days bled into weeks, I was not surprised to discover I had become the subject of more than one rumor. Most of them had to do with my supposed reputation as an “easy girl.” Nothing makes a teenage girl more of a pariah in a Catholic school than to insinuate she is not a virgin. If the rumors were to be believed, I was nothing more than a wanton and shameless slut. As I was grabbing books from my locker—ignoring a note with **TRAMP** written on it—I was tapped on the shoulder.

It was Lisa.

“Marianne?”

Although I did not care to hear what she had to say, I replied, “Yes?”

“Can we talk?”

With a sigh, I closed my locker, and I asked, “About?”

“I feel terrible that all of this is happening to you,” Lisa said. “I can’t apologize for Nancy, but I’m sorry.”

Her apology sounded almost sincere.

“Thank you.”

“Now, I understand if you refuse, but I wanted to ask if you’d be kind enough to talk with Nancy, and sort all of this out with her,” Lisa continued. “We want to be your friend.”

Against my better judgment, I said, “I’ll talk with her.”

During lunch, I sat with Nancy and the girls at their designated table in the cafeteria.

“Hi,” Nancy said.

“Hi,” I replied.

We looked at each other for a couple of minutes, but neither of us said anything.

As I started to speak, Nancy interrupted, “I’m sorry.”

I was taken aback by her unexpected apology, so I stammered, “What?”

“I’m sorry,” Nancy repeated. “I shouldn’t have acted the way I did.”

I did not say anything.

“Do you accept my apology?”

“Oh. . . .” I trailed off. As I processed what sounded like a sincere apology, I said, “Yes, I do. I’m sorry, too. I shouldn’t have been so blunt. It wasn’t kind of me.”

“Thank you,” Nancy replied. “I can understand where you were coming from. I shouldn’t have started rumors about you. I was acting out in anger. Can you forgive me?”

Although I was hurt by her rumors about me and my reputation, I did not want to hold a grudge. A grudge would only hurt me more in the long run. I had to be the bigger person.

“It’ll take time,” I answered. “But I think I can.”

“Are we all friends now?” Debra joked.

“Yes,” I said. “Why not?”

Walking home from school, I told Nora about my one–on–five with Nancy and the girls.

“Nancy Thomas doesn’t even know the meaning of the word ‘apology,’” Nora exclaimed. “I don’t believe it.”

“Well, it’s true,” I replied. “We apologized to each other.”

“What did you have to apologize for?”

“I told you already,” I answered. “I was too blunt with her. It was rude, even if it was true.”

Nora scoffed.

“I don’t want to hold a grudge,” I said. “Can’t you understand that?”

“Yes,” Nora answered. “I believe *you*, but I don’t believe *her*, and you shouldn’t, either.”

“Why?”

“Nancy Thomas is a snake in the grass made up with feathered hair and lip gloss. She can’t be trusted. Don’t you remember the stories I told you?”

“People can change, Nora,” I said. “It isn’t fair to hold a person's past against them.”

“Well, I tried my best,” Nora sighed. “Promise me one thing.”

“What?”

“If you ever feel uncomfortable with her or any of the girls, try to tell someone, anyone, if you can,” she answered. “Be careful, Marianne.”

“I promise.”

A couple of weeks later, I was eating lunch with the girls while Lisa was discussing her upcoming birthday.

“Mom and Dad said we can have the basement to ourselves,” Lisa beamed. “It’s going to be so much fun.”

“Lisa,” Nancy interrupted. “Have you invited Marianne yet?”

“Oh,” Lisa exclaimed. “I haven’t. Are you able to come to my birthday party, Marianne? It’s on the 26th.”

“Who’ll be there?”

“It’ll just be us,” Lisa answered. “Can you come?”

“I’ll have to ask my parents, but I think I’ll be able to go.”

“Great,” Lisa said.

“You’ll have the time of your life,” Nancy added.

With a feigned smile, I continued lunch as normal with Nancy and the girls.

The party was a trap.

It had to be.

Sitting in my bedroom after school, Nora and I were talking about the party.

“‘The time of your life?’” Nora scoffed. “This reeks of one of Nancy’s cruel jokes. Don’t fall for it, Marianne.”

“I thought so, too,” I said. There was a beat before I continued, “But what if it isn’t?”

“Oh, Marianne. . . .” Nora trailed off as I continued speaking.

“I know it sounds naïve, but what if it’s just a birthday party?” I asked. “We made up with each other a month and a half ago. Why would they wait until now to do something to me?”

“Nancy Thomas doesn’t forgive, and she definitely doesn’t forget,” Nora countered. “She’s not some dumb blonde. She’s smart, cunning, and calculated. She would wait until now, because she knows you’ve got your guard down. Don’t go to the party.”

“What am I supposed to tell them?”

“Tell them your parents said, ‘No,’” Nora answered.

“I don’t want to lie, Nora.”

“Make other plans,” Nora suggested. “Tell them we’re going to see a movie, and then we’ll go and see a movie. You won’t be lying then.”

Before I was able to respond, we heard a knock at my bedroom door.

“Marianne,” Mom said. “You have a phone call.”

“Who is it?”

“Lisa Donovan.”

Excusing myself from my conversation with Nora, I walked downstairs to answer Lisa’s call.

“Yes?”

“Have you asked your parents yet?” Lisa asked. “I need to know, so we have enough food and drinks.”

“Hold on,” I said. Covering the phone with my hand, I asked, “Mom?”

Sitting at the kitchen table with a magazine, Mom said, “Yes?”

“May I go to Lisa Donovan’s birthday party?”

“When?”

“It’s on the 26th.”

“Who will be there?”

“Just Lisa and the girls,” I answered. “Nancy, Kathy, Tricia, Debra.”

“What time?” Mom asked. “I don’t want you driving home too late, especially since it’ll be the weekend.”

Removing my hand from the transmitter, I asked, “Could I stay over if it gets too late?”

“Yes.”

“She says I can stay over at her house if it gets too late.”

“OK,” Mom said. “You can go. Have fun.”

Returning to my telephone call with Lisa, I said, “I can go.”

“Great,” Lisa said. “8 P. M. We’ll have grass and wine and records. See you then!”

“See you then,” I repeated. “Goodbye.”

I returned the telephone to its cradle, and I walked back to my bedroom to tell Nora. Before I was even able to say anything, she interrupted me.

“You’re going. . . .” Nora guessed. “Aren’t you?”

“Yes,” I answered. “Please, don’t be mad.”

“I’m not mad,” Nora said. “But I’m worried. I don’t want anyone to get hurt.”

“What’s the worst they could do?”

“You don’t want to know, Mari.”

“Oh, Nora. . . .” I said. “You’re being a great friend right now, but I can’t live forever in fear of a possible attempt at retaliation by a group of teenage girls.”

“I know,” Nora conceded. “I don’t like it, but I know. Please, be careful.”

“Thank you,” I said. “I will.”

On the following Friday, May 25, 1973, I was eating lunch with the girls as Lisa was lavished with early birthday wishes by most of our classmates.

“I can’t believe I’m eighteen,” Lisa sighed. “You’re all still young. . . . I’m going to miss our lunches together most of all.”

I was confused by her choice of words, but I thought Lisa was merely feeling wistful about her eighteenth birthday and our imminent graduation from high school.

“We’ll always be friends, Lisa,” Kathy said.

“Always,” Tricia emphasized.

When I awoke the following day, Saturday, May 26, 1973, I made my bed, ate breakfast with my family, and around noon, I called Lisa on the telephone in the kitchen.

“Hello?”

“Hi, Lisa,” I said. “Happy birthday!”

“Thank you, Marianne.”

“I’m looking forward to your party,” I said. “8 P. M.?”

“Yes,” Lisa answered. “See you then!”

“See you then,” I said. “Goodbye.”

I returned the telephone to its cradle, and I went through my day as usual until it was time to get ready for Lisa’s party. As I was getting ready, I started to feel a gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach. Nora’s words from the day prior reverberated in my mind. *What if this party* is *nothing but a cruel joke?* I shook my head, and I continued getting ready. *I cannot live in fear,* especially *of a group of teenage girls.*

*Get a grip, Marianne.*

Looking at myself in my mirror, I was dressed in my favorite black chiffon dress, and I had made myself up with eyeshadow, lip gloss, and a touch of rouge on my cheeks. By the time I was done, it was 6 P. M. I went downstairs to have dinner with my family, and after I finished my meal, I was excused from the table, kissed Mom and Dad goodnight, and I said goodnight to my brothers and sisters before I left my house for Lisa’s party.

None of us knew it, but that was the last time we would know peace.

I drove to Lisa’s house with my mother’s car, which she allowed me to borrow for the evening. When I arrived at Lisa’s house, she was standing on her front porch with her parents and younger brothers, who were leaving for an evening in town to let us have the house to ourselves.

“We’ll be back around midnight,” Mr. Donovan said. “Have a fun time, girls, but remember the rules of the house, Lisa.”

“I will, Dad,” Lisa replied. “Goodbye.”

After Lisa’s family piled into their station wagon, she waved as they drove off, and Nancy almost immediately pulled into the empty parking space.

As she exited her car, Nancy grabbed a bottle of red wine from the passenger seat, and said, “Let’s go!”

In the Donovans’ basement, Lisa laid out a spread of food and drinks, along with tin cases of marijuana and her favorite albums — Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Jefferson Airplane. She placed *The Dark Side of the Moon* on the turntable, and we listened to the album as we lit our joints and poured ourselves disposable cups of wine. We drank, we smoked, we joked, we danced, we sang, and we started sharing stories with each other as we sat on the shag carpet. We replaced *The Dark Side of the Moon* with an older album from Jefferson Airplane as we continued talking with each other.

It was approximately 9:30 P. M.

As the girls and I started feeling the effects of the grass and wine, we sat and listened intently as Debra shared all of the gossip she recently obtained. After she finished, Kathy started speaking.

“You know what I’m thinking about?”

“What?” Tricia asked.

“Ancient Egypt,” Kathy answered.

We chittered and laughed, but Kathy continued speaking.

“No, I mean. . . . It’s sad when you think about it.”

“What do you mean?” Lisa asked.

“I learned more about them in history class on Wednesday. They spent their entire lives trying to make sure they’d be remembered after their deaths. Mummies. Pyramids. Sarcophaguses? Sarcophagi? I don’t remember. Anyway, it proves my point about how badly they wanted to be remembered. They knew that was the secret to eternal life.”

As Kathy trailed off, I laughed.

*How high was she?*

Looking around the room at the girls’ stony faces, I realized my faux pas.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “Were you serious?”

No one answered my question, but Lisa continued, “It wasn’t just ancient Egypt, either. Even today, people strive, and suffer, and work to make sure they won’t be forgotten.”

The gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach returned.

*Something is* not *right.*

Walking in from behind me, Nancy asked, “Why do we do it?”

*When had she left the room?*

She was holding an unopened bottle of wine.

*She must have went to get another bottle of wine. . . . Right?*

“Because we know, in one way or another, that you’re only ever really gone when you’re forgotten.”

A voice whispered within me.

*Get out of this house.*

The gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach had evolved into an all–encompassing feeling of dread.

The voice grew louder.

*Get out of this house.*

“I think I have to make a call,” I said. Grabbing my handbag, I arose from the floor, but the exit was blocked by Kathy and Tricia. “Please, excuse me.”

Approaching me from behind, Nancy said, “I’m sorry, Mari, but we’re not done with you yet.”

The whisper was now a scream.

*Get out of this house!*

With a key she retrieved from her pocket, Lisa closed and locked the basement door.

“What are you doing?”

“We want to be remembered,” Kathy said. “We don’t want to be forgotten after graduation.”

“After all, high school doesn’t mean anything,” Nancy shrugged. “Beauty fades. Popularity dips. People forget.”

“You know the stories of the early Christian virgin–martyrs? Saints Agatha and Agnes and Lucy and Cecilia. They were killed nearly two thousand years ago, but we still remember them. We celebrate them. Their names are enshrined in eternity,” Lisa said. “People won’t ever forget them.”

“Please, I just want to go home,” I begged, but Nancy snapped, “Shut up.”

“What are you going to do? Kill me?” I asked. Wiping tears from my eyes, I said, “Go ahead. Kill me.”

The girls laughed.

“*We* don’t want to kill *you*,” Nancy mocked. “*We* want *you* to kill *us*.”

My eyes widened in shock and horror.

As I stammered in confusion, Lisa added, “Or, at least, let people *think* you killed us.”

“A cup of wine and a handful of barbs should work,” Nancy said. “And when Lisa’s parents return home to an absolutely horrific scene—their daughter and her friends dead—they’ll have no one to blame but you.”

Tears trickling down my cheeks, I asked, “Why are you doing this to me?”

The girls approached me from all around.

“A new girl at school no one knows? Why wouldn’t we choose you? It shouldn’t be hard at all for people to believe you snapped and convinced all of us to join you in a suicide pact,” Nancy answered. “You aren’t special. You just came along at the right time.”

Nancy shoved me, and I landed on a bean bag chair. As I struggled to stand up, Nancy opened the wine, and Lisa produced three bottles of barbiturates. I held my hand to my mouth in abject horror as I watched each of the girls down half of a bottle of barbiturates and take a swig of wine. Petrified, I could not move, but I closed my eyes. The girls talked softly as they sat down. Within a few minutes, I heard Lisa start struggling to breathe. Kathy and Tricia kept coughing, while Lisa’s breaths began rattling in her throat as she desperately tried to take a full breath.

After several minutes, I could not hear Lisa, Kathy, or Debra anymore; Tricia cried out for her mother before she stopped audibly breathing. Keeping my eyes firmly closed, I could hear what sounded like someone walking unsteadily toward me.

It was Nancy.

I could smell her perfume.

Her breaths were shallow, her grip on my shoulders was weak, and her speech was slurred, but she whispered something to me. I could not hear what she said.

It was approximately 12 A. M.

I opened my eyes.

I screamed as loudly as I could.

My memories after that are like flashbulbs from a camera. Lisa’s parents and brothers returning home, Lisa’s father kicking in the basement door, their discovery of the girls’ bodies, the police, EMTs, my parents, the lights shining in my eyes, being interrogated, Nancy’s mother’s discovery of her hidden journals, and my family’s ultimate choice to stay in Maryvale after the close of the investigation.

Although I was cleared of any wrongdoing by the authorities due to Nancy’s journals and the girls’ method of suicide, I am still reviled by some in the community as a mass murderer. Urban legends sprung up alleging all sorts of vile things. One says that I murdered the girls, but instead of jail, I was sent to a psychiatric hospital, which apparently is not an adequate punishment. However, it is partially true, since my parents sent me to my grandparents in Norwich to receive inpatient mental health treatment after the trauma of the girls’ suicides.

As I look back on my experience with “The Maryvale Girls,” as they came to be known, I cannot help but wonder, “Why didn’t they kill me?” It would have spared me the pain of having to live with the trauma of their deaths. Yet I suppose I am in some ways more fortunate than others. As long as the girls are remembered, so will I be.
