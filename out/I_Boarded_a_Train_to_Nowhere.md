I've always been a night owl. I often take the last subway home and enjoy the solitude and the rhythmic clacking of the tracks. But what happened last night doesn't make me confident that I'll ever take the subway again.

It was a typical Thursday night. I stayed late at the office, working on a project that has been haunting me for weeks. When I left, the streets were almost empty and a strange silence enveloped the city. I quickly ran to the station and rode the lone escalator to the underground.

It's not unusual for the last ride of the day to be sparsely populated, especially when it's a typical weekday and most of the city's residents are in their homes by this point. The escalator ride is always a lengthy one, but luckily my headphones provided the entertainment I needed. A favorite playlist and solitude, what could be better?

This particular station is one of the newer ones in town and looks pretty modern. During the day, the platform is packed with people waiting for their connection, but at this late moment I'm alone. It always feels strange to be alone in such a public place, but this was so... different. The lights were classically on, the escalators were running and the wind could be heard from the tunnels heralding the arrival of the train.

The train arrived at its usual speed, the doors opened with a rush and I stepped into the old, familiar but empty carriage. I settled into my seat and was glad to be alone for a while. When the train started moving, I leaned my head against the window and watched the small lights pass by in the tunnel. It was soothing, almost hypnotic.

I must have fallen asleep for a while, lulled by the gentle rocking of the train. When I woke up, the train was still moving, but something was off. I looked at the digital display above the door:

*Next station:* >!\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!<

There was nothing else. It always shows the next station and then the final stop of the line, but not this time.

The clock showed **01:45**. I should have been at my destination ten minutes ago.

I sat down and tried to shake off the drowsiness. The train continued to move through the tunnel, but there was no sign of the station. This time, even the simple, faint lights that usually illuminated the tunnel were nowhere to be seen, leaving the scene outside shrouded in an impenetrable darkness.

Even the carriages in front and behind me were empty and no one was in them. It was as if I were alone in the whole train. But at that moment, an excellent thought occurred to me.

*"Someone must be driving the metro..."* I muttered quietly to myself. I walked to the front of my carriage and pressed the button to speak to the conductor.

But no one answered, just static electricity. I tried calling for help on the phone, but there was no signal.

In the last few years the city has started to bring the phone signal underground, but occasionally it would drop out between certain stations that were deeper. Apparently, one of those times was now.

Panic began to take hold of me. I walked through the car to the door at the end of it, hoping it would be unlocked. I lightly pushed the handle.

*\*click\**

The door opened with ease and I could step through to the next car.

But it too was empty. Every carriage I checked was abandoned. From the first to the last - 7 cars in total. The usually soothing hum of the train was oppressive, the shadows deeper and darker.

I returned to my seat and my mind raced with thoughts. The inside of the train, once familiar and comforting, now felt claustrophobic and alien. The flickering lights cast strange, incongruous shadows that seemed to stretch and twist as I moved. My pulse quickened and my breathing became labored. The realization that I was all alone on this endless journey hit me full force.

Minutes, or maybe even hours, have passed. However, looking at my watch, it showed **01:45** again.

Time seemed to be losing meaning in that tunnel. I tried to occupy my mind, counting seats, reading the safety instructions over and over again, studying the map of the entire subway system, or trying to catch a phone signal. But the monotony of the train and the unchanging environment drove me crazy.

I tried to explain rationally what was happening. Maybe there was a technical problem and the conductor had to go around several stations. But that didn't make any sense, as we hadn't passed a single station yet.

Why was there no announcement? Why is time seemingly not running out? Questions swirled around in my head, each more disturbing than the last.

I decided to search the train again, this time more slowly, more thoroughly. I checked every seat, every nook and cranny, looking for any sign of life. There was nothing - no bags, no discarded newspapers, nothing to indicate that there was anyone else on this train. Ironically, this was the cleanest subway I've ever been on.

Desperation made me try the emergency brake. I pulled it, expecting the train to stop...

...but nothing happened.

It was as if the system had been disabled and I had no way to stop the relentless movement of the rig.

Exhaustion, hunger and thirst began to set in. I slumped back in my seat, my body shaking with a mixture of fear and fatigue. I stared out the window, hoping for some hint of a station, some break in the monotony of the tunnel. But there was nothing - just an endless dark void.

My thoughts began to get stranger and stranger, and my mind replayed all the decisions that had led me to this moment. I thought about my family, my friends, the life I took for granted. Regret washed over me, an overwhelming weight that seemed to suffocate me.

As the hours dragged on, I began to question my sanity. Was this just a figment of my vivid imagination? Was I trapped in some nightmare? After all, I had fallen asleep for a while during the ride and could only dream.

The silence was deafening, punctuated only by the rhythmic clacking of the tracks, a sound that had once soothed me but now seemed like the relentless drumbeat of doom.

In a moment of epiphany, I remembered my phone again. Maybe, just maybe, I could find a way to get a signal. I moved to the middle of the rig, held the phone high, and hoped again that I could pick up even a bit of signal. Nothing. I tried again and again, moving back and forth, but it was futile. The signal was as elusive as the end of this tunnel.

My throat was dry and my stomach clenched with emptiness. I dug through my bag and found a half-eaten granola bar and a small bottle of water. It wasn't much, but it was better than nothing.

As I sat there munching on the bar, I couldn't shake the feeling that the train was a living being, a mechanical animal that had trapped me in its belly. The notion was absurd, but in my exhausted state it seemed frighteningly real.

More time passed. But my watch still read **01:45**. I couldn't sleep as anxiety coursed through my veins. I could feel my grip on reality slipping away, my thoughts becoming more fragmented and irrational. I needed to focus, I needed to find a way out.

I returned to the front of the train and banged on the door to the conductor's cabin.

*"Hello? Anyone there? Please help me!"*

My voice echoed through the empty carriages, but no one answered. I collapsed against the door, tears of despair streaming down my face.

I returned to my seat and felt the weight of despair bearing down on me. But just as I was about to give in to the rush of anxiety, the train began to slow down.

My heart leapt with hope. Is it possible? Could I finally reach a station?

The train began to slow slightly. I pressed my face against the window, trying to see out just a little. The tunnel was still dark, but a faint glow appeared in the distance.

The train gradually came to a stop and stopped.

*"End station, please disembark."* came over the speakers.

The doors opened with a mundane clang and I stepped out onto the platform, all shaken up.

The station was eerily quiet, as deserted as the train. I was still alone. I wasn't waiting for anything. Despite all my fatigue and exhaustion, I didn't hesitate and immediately began to run up the escalator towards the outside.

*One, two, three...*

At first I took them one at a time, then two at a time, and finally I found myself running up the escalator three steps at a time. My heart was pounding with exhaustion, but also with anticipation.

With each step I felt the oppressive weight of the underground disappear and the promise of freedom grow stronger. The end of the escalator loomed on the horizon and I forced myself to exert even more strength, even though my legs burned with exertion.

Finally, I reached the top. I stumbled out of the top of the station and out into the street, gasping for breath.

The cool night air hit me in the face, refreshing and invigorating. I took a moment to calm down and look around the usual yet somehow alien cityscape.

The streets were quiet, with only a few cars passing by and the occasional pedestrian here and there. I set off on my way home, my legs still shaking from the exertion and the events of the previous night swirling in my head. My watch read **01:55**.

When I finally arrived at my apartment, I fumbled for my keys, my hands shaking. I staggered inside and collapsed on the couch, too exhausted to get into bed.

In the days that followed, I avoided the subway altogether, preferring to take buses, trams, taxis, or rely on my own legs. My friends and colleagues at work noticed that I had somehow changed, but I couldn't explain it to them. How could I? It sounded crazy even to me.

For that reason, I'm writing this here, as a little confession for personal relief. I don't expect anyone to believe me, but at the very least this experience can serve as a little warning.
