It happened on New Year’s Eve, I spent it on the Internet like I always did, I’ve always had a lonely life and one of the ways to escape it & kill time was playing around with the “Text to Image” feature that got exceedingly improved last year as you all know it. I’ve tried a lot of prompts, think of anything and most likely I’ve already asked A.I to draw it, even the most absurd ideas. The day before I watched a horror movie that left quite a big impression on me because unlike others it was actually scary and somewhat had an original plot. Thinking about that movie, I began to type prompts to get a creepy image like “a ghost standing in front of a sleeping person” or “a smiling person under the bed”. Nothing, in particular, creeped me out. Sure, there were some creepy images (A.I. can sometimes mess up and turn any prompt into a creepy image) but I couldn't say that I was afraid to go to sleep after seeing them. Shortly after I decided to type “The scariest picture”, as I’d expected, no result scared me in any way. I also should point out that I’m pretty resistant to scary stuff and never believed in ghosts and whatnot. I got hungry, and before going to make a sandwich, I typed “The scariest picture that could kill you” and left my laptop to generate it.

As soon as I came back, I got fucking scared, I dropped the sandwich instantly, I’d never been that genuinely scared in my entire life. I’ll start with the fact that it only gave one single picture, not six as it should. The picture contained a smiling priest or a monk surrounded by the most depressing and darkest background you could ever conceive of, I couldn’t even discern much, but I think it contained a church or some sort of monastery. The scariest part was his face, it looked straight into my soul, straight into my eyes, with the most terrifying smile, even Jack The Killer’s smile was less scary than his. My eye contact with that picture lasted only for 3 seconds, but it felt like 3 hours. I never closed a browser tab so quickly and nervously, I was terrified, I felt like I was being watched, I felt like someone was behind me, I felt the sudden urge to run, my entire body was in a panic, every single self-preservation instinct was enabled. My body simply couldn't handle it and I passed out.

I woke up in a couple of hours, it was 4 a.m., it was still dark, and my laptop was on. The first thought that came into my mind was that image, it just stuck into my head, I saw it even when I closed my eyes. To drown out the panic I was experiencing I turned on a random entertaining YouTube video, I didn’t pay attention to it at all, I still had that image, that priest, that depressing, dark background and that church in my head, right in front of my eyes. After some time I heard something similar to a choir, the voices were straight from the hell I swear, they weren’t human voices! I couldn’t find the source of it, it wasn’t coming from any direction, as though it was inside my head. I was on the verge of passing out again, then I heard a silent laugh. The goosebumps went down my spine. Something definitely was under my bed, I could feel the presence of something out of this world from there, I heard the movements. It was the last straw after which I passed out.

I woke up, it was 8 a.m., no choir, but the image was still in my head, right in front of my eyes, I couldn't stop thinking about it, I wanted to, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t stand it, I grabbed my phone and fucking ran as fast as I could, outside, to the people, I just wanted to run away from the insanity I was experiencing. I had only my pants, shirt, and my slippers on, but I didn’t care. I made it to the bus stop and just sat there, everyone obviously looked at me with strange faces, but I was just delighted I was next to normal people, I didn’t even feel the cold. That terrifying image was still inside my head right in front of my eyes. After sitting there for about 10 minutes and calming myself down a bit despite the persistent image in my head I decided to look at the cameras in my house. At that point, I had already decided and promised myself that I would never in my life come back to that house, never. I opened my phone, and everything seemed normal until I got to my bedroom where my laptop was. Under my bed, I saw those fucking eyes, staring at the fucking camera, it somehow knew I was looking at it, it was a black thumb-shaped smiling face that was under my bed the entire time. It began to get out of the bed, I couldn't handle it, I blocked my phone, put it in my pocket, and after standing up and being petrified in utter shock for 10 seconds I passed out.

I woke up in my damn house, I have no idea how I got there, it was 1 a.m., my head hurt badly. The image was still in front of me, and it was as scary as it was for the first time I saw it. It makes me want to gouge out my eyes, but I know that even if I do so, I’ll still have it inside my mind and I will see nothing but this image. My phone was still in my pocket, I decided to look at the cameras again knowing damn well I was probably about to see something shocking. I skimmed through every camera, when I got to the bedroom I saw that fucking black thumb-shaped smiling face, it was under my bed, it’s right under me. Having realized it, having that cursed image inside my head, I made up my mind to write this story, in the middle of writing this I began to hear the choir again. The choir I'm hearing might be just in my head, but I'm sure the laugh of that creature under my bed I'm hearing as I'm typing this is real, it knocks at the drawer next to my bed right now. I've made up my mind that I will face that creature after I finish writing this, and even if it doesn’t result in my death, I’ll make it happen, my life will never be the same anymore, even if this image gets out of my head, I will still remember it, even if that creature stops following me, I will still know it exists somewhere and always be paranoid of it. My life will never be the same. I have no other choice.

For the love of God, never generate pictures with Artificial Intelligence, something not from this world got into the data it learned from.
