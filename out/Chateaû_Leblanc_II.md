[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/U7BWI6IFuj)

No point skirting around it. We arrived at the dig site just past eight. The road—if you could call it that—was unpaved and flanked by ash-colored trees and, beyond that, fields pocked with stone. We were somewhere in the French countryside, and we arrived in Juliette's dusty old military Jeep. I half expected another ostentatious presentation of wealth in the form of a chaffeur and a stagecoach, but it would seem Juliette had yet more surprises in store for me.

At this point I was a bit more calm. Calmer than I was yesterday, that is. Which is insane, because, what the fuck? I can't describe again what I saw. Words escape me. It was completely unimaginable and maybe that was why I couldn't conjure a reaction; it was out of place, this. It couldn't take hold in my mind. 

But.

I don't know. I guess I figured there was a rational explanation. I learned from records in the library that Chǎteau Leblanc was not administrated directly by Juliette; it was administered by Julien, her uncle. Monsiuer Leblanc, if you're classy. Monsiuer Leblanc also just so happened to be Lyon's prison warden (and the water department manager). Maybe that man was a prisoner. I am not a Frenchman. I was in no position to judge the institutions of the French. Maybe he did something truly horrid, to warrant his captivity in that nave instead of the penitentiary. 

I began to wonder. If Monsiuer Leblanc laid out before me a paper listing crimes from misdemeanors to true sins, how many would justify the state that man was in? And who's job was it to decide who received what punishment? I realized something, then, in the passenger seat of that Jeep, Juliette prattling on about the valley, Chevalier silent behind us. I realized either every crime justified the punishment, or none of them did. 

I decided to push it out of my mind. It seems foolish, the things your mind will do when faced with a situation of this magnitude. I tried to focus on the dig site. Ultimately, I was here for an internship. Ultimately, I belonged to the museum. If I played my cards right, it meant more revenue for the museum. And the museum was all I had. If I lost this, I lost everything. 

Before I was born, my grandmother said something to my mother. That her son would be a serial killer, and her daughter, a prostitute. It struck me as funny, once, how these two things were the worst professions either gender could enter, but now it just saddens me. All the women in my family were prostitutes; I would not be one, too.

It occured to me the gender of the person underneath the chateau. He was male. I saw his... his manhood, flaccid and lacerated. If I left, then I would be just another woman whos career was controlled by a man.

The road eventually grew bumpy. I held onto the handle above my door. I tried to listen to Juliette and Chevalier's conversation, but they were speaking French. I did not know French. Well, I did, but not enough to actively translate a fast-paced conversation. I looked out my window as the Jeep turned and swayed and we crested the edge of a large crater. It was the tawny color of sandstone, with men mining and carving and machines excavating. It looked indistinguishable from the many dig sites I had seen in my days at the university, but it harbored a distinct sense of dread.

The Jeep came to a smooth, practiced halt and Chevalier exited. I went to open my door, but Juliette tutted me.

"Wait for Chevalier to open our doors, Daisy," she said. 

I blinked in surprise. "It's fine, really, I don't mind—"

"Wait," she said, more firmly this time. So I waited. In seconds, Chevalier had opened Juliette's door, and then mine. She bowed as we exited. I felt uncomfortable. Out of my element, I guess, and maybe even a little bit hateful. I grew up poor. I am still poor. When you're poor, you never stop hating rich people. 

Chevalier trotted ahead of us and began speaking with who appeared to be the dig site's foreman. He had an orange hard hat and a reflective vest. He noticed Juliette, and then me, and waved us over. Stepping into this informal situation, I felt more at ease. I squinted at his nametag; Pascal. I committed it to memory. Juliete assumed a leisurely pace and Chevalier led us to the small pulley that would bring us to the bottom of the chasm.

On the pulley, Pascal and Juliette stood at the edge, discussing the status of the dig. Logistics, dull drudgery. I remained with Chevalier, at the back. 

"Do you not want to look at the site?" Chevalier said. "It is quite beautiful from this height."

"No, thank you," I politely declined. "I– I do not take well to heights, I suppose. Besides, its nothing special, is it?"

"Nothing special at all," she confirmed. "The real attraction is what lay inside."

"In that case, I suppose the site itself would be beautiful," I said, "assuming it implies beauty within."

"You are quick-witted, Mademoiselle— ah, Daisy. I wonder why you are in a place like this."

I stared at her, dumbfounded, for a moment. What a strange comment. I opened my mouth to speak but the pulley thudded to a halt, jostling us. The foreman loudly announced our arrival, and I tuned his voice out as Juliette sent him away. 

"Here we are," she said, leading us towards the center. The edges of her skirt collected dust, as did Chevalier's. I had chosen to switch into something more practical. That was, the only cohesive outfit I owned. And my coat. I told people it was my late father's but I just got it at a department store. And my dad was still alive. 

"So, Juliette," I said, catching up with her. "You made it out as though something—"

"Extraordinary?"

"Yes, something extraordinary, was found here. Am I to believe this is true?"

"I certainly did not take you for the skeptic, Daisy," she said.

"I cannot imagine why."

She laughed. It was an airy, sweet sound, that sort of reverberated in her throat. I found myself fixated on it. "Well, I'll have you know it most certainly is," she said. "Though your skepticism is not unfounded. It is my understanding that rival museums have experienced scandals regarding fabricated artifacts. Tell me, Daisy, do you have experience in verifying the validity of artifacts?"

I grinned. "I do."

"Good," she said. "You will get to prove it soon."

"Oh. And welcome to the Marrow."

The central chamber seemed to be teeming with life. Men guffawed and smacked each others shoulders, sweat-slick and glistening under the roaring sun. Tents were erected where I assumed people slept. Beyond those, a narrow corridor stretched into the limestone. Chevalier filled me in on the details while Juliette conversed with one of the miners. They were going to use this location as a quarry until miners accidentally dug up a false wall behind a buried reliquary. 

The Marrow was very cramped. I was reminded of my youth. My sisters and I slept in the same bed, packed like sardines, and even though our numbers eventually thinned as children moved out, we still always slept in the same bed. It was a comfort thing, I guess. 

Entering the corridor, the air seemed to drop several degrees. The shape was cylindrical and deliberate; this was here since before the construction of the quarry. How it became buried, I couldn't ascertain. 

Past the corridor lay a small, windowless chamber. In the center of the chamber sat a stone plinth. Upon it was the artifact. A yellow tag fluttered from the jar it was secured inside. *Ne pas toucher*. 

It was rather unassuming. 

The jar’s thick, leaded glass warped the view of the object within. It looked small enough to cradle in two hands, forged from a metal that was neither gold nor bronze but some deeper, oil-slick alloy that seemed to drink in the lamplight. The surface was engraved with intricate spirals and knotwork in the ancient Gaulish style, their lines so fine they seemed to have been cut by something sharper than steel.

Around its lip were set six inset stones, each a different hue; garnet, jet, amber, pearl, bloodstone, and one so pale and glassy I could not recognize it. They were not decorative. I could feel it, even from where I stood; the arrangement was deliberate, purposeful, as though each gem was a number in some equation. The air inside the chamber felt warmer here, as if the thing radiated its own faint heat. 

"This is the Crucible," Juliette said. "Cleverly named after its shape. I believe it was used by ancient Gauls to melt metals. Can you confirm this?" 

I approached it. Inspected it as well as I could without being able to touch it. No, that couldn't be true. If it were, heat scarring would be visible, or there would be trace amounts of metal residue, but it seemed to just be a clay crucible.

"Not at first glance," I said. "I mean— it doesn't look like it right away, no. Do we have permission to—"

"Of course," she cut me off. "I am Mademoiselle Leblanc, and you, my protégé. You may do whatever you like."

We carefully transported the crucible back to the manor, and it rested unceremoniously in my chambers. A few days of leisure and I finally analyzed its mineral composition, Juliette lingering behind me.

"A common ceramics technique would temper clay with quartz and bone ash to handle rapid temperature fluctuations," I said after several minutes of analysis. "This was extremely common in the valley during this time. Natural selection says it should, by all accounts, possess this makeup."

Juliette's mouth twitched. "And I take it it does not?"

"No, ma'am. Though that does not immediately mean it was not Gaulish, or not a crucible."

"Well, what can you tell us about it?"

I looked back at it and considered my findings, flipping through a green spiral-bound notebook. I found microscopic traces of synthetic mullite and lead-tin solder, but...

"The alloys used were not invented until the early 20th century," I said slowly. "If I had to pin it down, I'd say... the 40's, maybe."

Juliette hummed. "The war."

I shrugged. "You said it, not me."

"So the crucible had to be created no later than the second World War?"

"It is most likely."

"Hm." She grinned. "No."

It was so... matter of fact. *No*, she proclaimed. Like it was some fundamental truth. I was a bit dumbfounded. 

"Um." I blinked. "I— I don't—"

"The crucible was analyzed by top analysts and it is, indeed, a Gaul artifact. These alloys must have been placed after the fact, somebody must have discovered it before us," she said, voice a bit tight.

That was impossible. "Lady Juliette, I must—"

"What did you even come here for?" She bit out. "If you can't— can't even—"

Just then, the door swung open and in walked Chevalier. She placed a hand on Juliette's shoulder. Muttered something in French. Juliette looked back at me, teary-eyed, and then was whisked away. 

I sat there confused for a moment. Had I offended her? Had I disappointed her? A pit grew in my stomach and I found myself unable to combat the leaden weight. I had disappointed Juliette. I had disappointed the museum. Was I ruined?

For somewhere between thirty minutes and an hour I sat there, dazed. I tried to make sense of the whole thing in my head; we had a Gaulish artifact. Okay. I analyzed it. It couldn't have been Gaulish, those alloys didn't exist back then. And this— this upset Juliette massively. Maybe her intelligence felt threatened. Maybe I embarrassed her. Was that it? It seemed likely. Lyon had been tumultuous in recent years, perhaps she was just wound up. With this in mind, I couldn't luxuriate in my chambers. It would be disingenuous. I set out to find Juliette in the expansive manor, and a few hallways and corridors later, I did.

She was in the downstairs dining room, sitting alone at the table. Her elbows were on the table, her head in her hands, and she was too tall for the chair, so she had to fold her body awkwardly just to fit. I lingered in the threshold of the room, watching her fingers occasionally drift up to scratch her scalp. She was beautiful, in an awkward, gangly way. Like Shelley Duvall. God, she was beautiful. 

"Mademoiselle," I said, my voice thin. I cleared my throat but did not bother repeating myself. "I, uh— can I sit with you?"

She was still for a few moments, head buried in her hands. Then, slowly, she looked up at me. Her eyes were red and puffy. 

"Of course, Daisy," she said. She patted the seat beside her. "You are always welcome to sit with me."

And so I did, taking my seat beside her. She sat upright and despondent. Her face was vacant and pale. It seemed like a complete overreaction to perhaps being incorrect about the origins of an object, but I suspected something deeper. Very rarely was anything ever just one thing.

"I... am sorry, Juliette," I began nervously. I tentatively reached out my hand to drape it across hers. "I could run the tests again, perhaps my equipment was defective, or contaminated, if—"

"No," she interrupted. Her fingers curled, but she did not remove her hand from under mine. "No, I... I overreacted. Ah, this is embarrassing, isn't it?" Fat tears welled in her eyes, a thin line of water. "Making a fool of herself, Lady Leblanc is."

"No, my lady, n—"

"I suppose... I suppose I was so certain, that I was a bit embarrassed to be... to be wrong," she explained. Her words came out as though she was figuring them out as she went. "You are very intelligent, Daisy. You are clever and... and I suppose I feel upstaged. But! In a good way, maybe. It is... it is refreshing. Ah, am I being too forward? I, uhm..."

The room fell silent. Forgetting myself, my hand tightened around hers. Her hand was pale and dainty; her fingers, long and knobby. I found myself tracing her knuckle with my thumb. 

"It is alright," I said. "It is still a very intriguing artifact. Crucibles like that were well past their time during the second world war," I said. "That somebody would have any business using one..." 

I thought for a moment. Was it possible the alloys I detected were not part of the object, but rather remnants from melted metal? I saw the dig site myself; the chamber was deep and freshly discovered. No matter how long it had been since 1945, it would have been impossible to implant an object that deep underground.

Unless.

"Has any terraforming been done in or around the dig site?"

Juliette looked up, blinking through bleary eyes. "What?"

"It is possible... that the object was recovered, used, and then transplanted," I explained. "If it was included in soil, like when filling in the dig site," I said. I knew that wasn't possible, the artifact was carefully placed within the chamber. But I wanted to comfort Juliette. I wanted her tears to stop. 

Juliette stared at me for a while, considering the implications of my words. Her mouth opened and closed repeatedly like a beheaded snake, still moving. Her makeup was smudged and smeared and I resisted the urge to reach out and thumb it away. Then her eyes trembled, like thunder. And then she let out a horrible, resounding wail, and collapsed onto the table, fingers digging into her scalp.

I acted fast. I had no choice but to. I stood, and all but flung myself at her, draping my body across hers, consoling her. I coaxed her to stand, and then the height difference made itself known, but I guided her shriveling, weeping form back to her chambers, which I passed on my way here. She was like a willow tree, tall and drooping. I pushed the ajar door open with my hip, and laid her down on her queen sized mattress. She immediately rolled over, sobbing, grabbing handfuls of the duvet. Rounding the bed, I crouched down beside her.

"Mademoiselle Leblanc," I said, pushing hair out of her reddened face. "Juliette. It's okay. Hey, it's okay. Please don't cry."

It was weird, but in the mere week or so I had been here, Juliette became some sort of a friend to me. I kept having the strangest dreams, ones of the two of us sharing intimate lives together, sitting on the patio of an unfamiliar home, and I often woke with a familiar warmth in my chest. I crouched there for a while, carressing her warm cheek until it cooled and dried, and she finally stopped crying. She tried to sit up, but I beseeched her not to. 

"I am sorry," she said quietly. "It has been a difficult day. I am..."

"Don't apologize, miss."

Silence.

"Will you stay here for the night, Daisy?"

"What?

"Here, in bed with me. For the night. Like you did with your sisters when you were young."

I stiffened. Her eyes, half-lidded, peered up at me like tiny moons. Tentatively I stood, and removed my soiled jacket, and laid next to her, atop the covers like an uncomfortable husband.

"Thank you."

Eventually her breathing slowed. She took a breath maybe thrice a minute, or perhaps her breaths were just quiet. This mystery seemed increasingly improbable. The deep location of the Crucible, juxtaposed with its modern implements, then coupled with Juliette's theatrics over it all. I did not for a second believe she was simply suffering a wounded ego. Then a thought hit me, poignant enough to make my body seize:

How did she know my sisters and I slept in the same bed as children?
