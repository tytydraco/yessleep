"Come on, Penny," The swaying oaks cast a rain of leaves around me as I climbed the forest incline. "Trust me, the view is amazing!" I reached a hand out, waiting for Penny to take it. She stood at the bottom, arms wrapped around herself, freckled face pinched in hesitation. Her lips pursed softly, face partially obscured through her clothes. A few gold strands framed her face, the rest tucked under her hat. "I know you're going to love it. I promise," I added, trying to reassure her.

"I don't know..." She murmured, eyeing the off-shoot path I'd led her on. Penny was, and always had, been a strict follower of rules, and one of those being that you didn't stray from the trail. "I just... Maybe we should head back." I frowned, lowering my hand as she started to turn around. "It's starting to get cold out, a-and we've already been out long enough. I'm sure there are better views that aren't so, uh... dangerous?"

"Penny," I called, catching her attention. She turned to look at me like a dog that had just heard a whistle, eyes curious yet guarded. "Can you at least try to trust me on this?" I watched her eyes flick away for a second, her gloved hands curling together as she weighed her options, and finally she looked back at me with a nod.

"Okay. But just for a little bit," Penny finally relented, and I smiled as she finally slipped her hand into mine, and I hoisted her up with ease.

"See? No cops coming after us," Her already-red face flushed deeper. Her blue eyes narrowed in a glare, and she huffed, adjusting her hat. "Kidding, kidding!" I grinned. "Come on. It's not far at all from where we parked." With that, I let go of her hand and began to climb the rest of the incline.

"Aaaaaand, here we are!" I proudly announced, hands at my hips as I stepped on the top of the hill. Though not the most impressive thing, the relatively flat nature of the forest made it a bit more special. Penny joined me a second later, brushing the raging strands of hair away from her face. She looked up, and her face lit up in awe. I grinned, following her gaze to the small clearing we now stood in. A small pond sat in the centre, reflecting the surrounding trees in a perfect mirror image. Leaves drifted down, sending ripples across the surface—colliding, then calming again.

"Wow," Penny breathed. "It's... it's beautiful."

"Isn't it?" I grinned, looking at her. She turned to look at me, returning a smile. "Told you it'd be worth it." She blushed, nodding. "Let's go down and see the pond!" A slope of wet leaves and pebbles stood between the edge and the clearing. Though a bit risky in terms of slipping, it wasn't anything to worry about, and I descended without an issue. "Your turn!" Her eyes swept the slope, calculating each pebble and patch of wet leaves as if they were traps. A shallow breath left her lips before she finally gave a small, reluctant nod.

"Okay," Penny carefully slid herself down the wet and muddy slope, taking meagre step after meagre step, legs practically shaking with the strain.

"See? Nothing to-"

A quiet gasp escaped her as her foot slid on loose soil. Her arms shot out, grasping for anything, but nothing stopped her fall.

The sickening crunch that followed rang through the forest, a cacophony of flapping wings and startled animals fleeing the scene. Her body lay still, limbs splayed haphazardly where they’d fallen. Her head rested against a jagged rock, neck bent at an angle no living person could survive. Blood trickled down the slope in winding streams, painting the rocks red like a river in miniature.

I froze, breath caught in my throat. I stumbled forward, crumbling to my knees. My lips parted, and an unbidden sound escaped, barely a whisper of what I had been hoping for. I swallowed and tried again. "Penny?"

The burbling sound of water running through a nearby stream filled my ears. Birds chattered as they returned to their homes in the trees overhead, unaware and uninterested in what had happened. The world narrowed on her form as blood continued to seep out, painting the leaves like ink in water.

She wasn’t breathing.

The caw of a crow echoed overhead, tearing through the fog settling over my thoughts. I stumbled up and scooped her into my arms. "Penny?" I repeated, shaking her. She was weightless in my arms, any tension present mere seconds before gone. I pressed her against my chest, blood seeping through my coat. I’d dreamed of holding her before, but not like this.

"Oh, god..." The pounding grew stronger and louder, the world spinning faster than I could process it. "Fuck, fuck fuck..." I looked her over with blurry eyes, chest tight with suppressed anguish. "Y-you're going to be okay, Penny. I'll get you some help." I bundled her against my chest, arms trembling as I carried her back the way we came. Every step up that hill felt steeper than the last, the ground dragging me down like it knew what I’d done.

I clutched her tighter as I climbed. Her blood soaked through my shirt, already cooling.

Adrenaline dragged me through the woods until the car was in sight. I threw open the door and laid Penny in the passenger seat, hands shaking as I fumbled for the keys.

"Please..." I whispered, slamming the door and peeling onto the road. "Hospital, hospital, hos—"

As I typed the word into the search bar, I stopped right before my finger could hit the 'L.' She was... Dead. Not by my hands, but close enough. The town would hate me—and I couldn’t blame them.

I glanced over. Penny’s head leaned limp against the window, the seat beneath her already dark with blood. She wouldn't have wanted that for me. I knew her, and she would've already forgiven me. I couldn’t throw everything away—not after all this. My hands gripped the wheel, knuckles bone white from the strain.

And so, I drove home.

I took residence in my late grandfather’s house, which he left for my family after his passing. It was close to town, but far enough away that I could live peacefully, without fear of noisy neighbours or people prying on what went on within it. As long as no one found out where I had taken her, then nobody would suspect I had anything to do with it.

The door opened and slammed shut behind me. "Hold on, I'm going to get something to fix you up, okay, Penny? You're going to be okay." I whispered to the corpse I carried. Kicking the door open, I hobbled to a couch and slowly lowered her on it. I fluffed the pillow beneath her head, combed her hair from her eyes with trembling fingers, and brushed my thumb against her cheek. She looked like Sleeping Beauty, her body perfectly intact and at ease. As long as I ignored her neck and the dark, purple bruises marring the once porcelain flesh around it, I could almost imagine that she was merely resting peacefully.

I left her side and began pacing the floor, trying to gather my thoughts. But the pounding in my chest made it hard to think. Still, one thought managed to persevere amongst a sea of static; I needed to get rid of the body. At the very least, I should bury it. It was the least I could do for her.

After retrieving a shovel from the basement, I ventured off into the thick grove of trees behind the house. It took me a few minutes to find the right place, a location far away enough that I could barely see my house, yet close enough that I could make it back in less time if I needed to.

As I thrust the shovel into the ground and lifted the first pile of dirt from the earth, I paused.

This was where she would rest for the rest of eternity.

I shook my head. No, it had to be more than this. It had to be more special, more fitting for such a beautiful girl. My head scanned the surrounding area, eyes landing on a bed of flowers. Red, yellow, white, and purple flowers littered the ground, swaying in the breeze. I smiled, the beauty of it reminding me of her. Raising the shovel high, I brought it down, expecting the familiar crunch of dirt beneath the metal.

Instead, I flinched as the shovel flew from my hands, knocked loose by the jarring clang of metal on metal. My brows furrowed in confusion, and I bent down to investigate. I clawed into the loosened earth until I uncovered the edge of something solid. Buried beneath was a small, black cube, no bigger than an orange. I pulled it out, wiping away the dirt.

Some of Penny's blood, which I neglected to wipe off of my fingers, had rubbed off on the surface. The crimson liquid seeped into the strange divots that covered every side of the box. I blinked, watching as the bloody droplets disappeared into the grooves. After waiting a moment, expecting for something else to happen, I was met with nothing.

A broken music box or some weird radio thing? Now it had Penny's blood on it, too. Another thing I'd need to dispose of. Pocketing the item, I kept digging until the hole felt deep enough. I stood over the grave for a few moments longer, my grip tightening on the shovel. Then, my fingers went slack, and the tool fell to the ground with a soft thud. Without another glance at the hole I'd made, I turned and headed home.

The moment I turned the handle on the back door and pushed it open, my heart stopped.

“Ghhhuuh...”

From across the kitchen, a faint gurgling noise escaped from the couch. I nearly tore the door off of its hinges as I slammed my body against it, sprinting towards the couch.

"Penny! Penny, can you hear me?" She answered with a low, broken groan. As I rounded the corner to see her, my breath caught in my throat.

Penny's chest, which lay so deathly still just moments ago, now quaked and moved with laboured breathing, every gasping inhalation followed by a shuddering exhalation. And yet, they were the most hauntingly beautiful sounds I'd ever heard. She writhed, back arching and falling in a slow, rhythmic motion, her eyes fluttering open. One was hazy, looking past me with wistful, glossy look.

The other, however, was frozen, locked upward in a grotesque, unnatural gaze. It didn’t blink. Didn’t shift. Just stared skyward with no purpose or control.

"Penny?" I dropped beside her, cupping her cheek. It emanated no warmth, but she was moving, and that was enough. "Are you okay? Do you need some water?"

The sound that escaped her lips was raw, like her voice was clawing its way past a wall of thorns. A pitiful whimper, a broken moan.

I nodded, standing up and heading back into the kitchen to fetch her a cup of water and hoping, praying, that it would help her. As soon as it filled up halfway, I ran back, nearly slipping on my own feet. I sank beside her, setting the glass down for a moment as I brushed her hair from her face, letting my fingers linger just a little too long. Her lips were parted slightly, cracked and still.

Gently, I tilted her chin toward me, thumb resting on her lower lip. I picked up the glass of water and brought it to her mouth, letting the edge of the cup kiss her lips.

"Take as long as you need," I murmured, brushing aside the golden hair that obscured her face, the same ones I had watched her adjust and playfully fuss with not an hour ago. She choked, a horrific sound reverberating from her throat before a spray of liquid burst through the corners of her lips. The water came back wine-red, muddled by dirt and congealing blood. "It's okay, it's okay... take it easy," I said, wiping the corner of her cold lips.

"It's okay. We're gonna get through this. We're okay. We'll figure something out, I promise." She was breathing. Barely, with stilted gasps, but breathing. That meant there was hope. I just wished she wasn't so... Unresponsive. "I promise," I repeated, almost to convince myself of her recovery more than to comfort Penny. It proved to be futile either way.

The ticks of the grandfather clock bore into my head, minutes passing with no change in her state. Penny just continued to take those constant gasping breaths of air, one eye peering at the ceiling and the other, forever unmoving. She made no move of her volition to sit upright, instead laying in the exact same position that I left her in.

I must've sat there for hours, listening to her faint, choking breaths. The sun had long dipped below the horizon, casting darkness over my living room and covering her face in a dark shroud. She looked... Stunning. Like an angel. A fallen one.

As the moon peaked above the trees, my eyelids grew heavy. Eventually, I forced myself to stand, legs numb and tingling from sitting so long. I carried Penny up the stairs and caught sight of the wound at the base of her neck. It hadn’t closed, but it also hadn't worsened. Just... Stagnant. I didn’t question it, as it was one less mess to clean.

"Here..." My voice sounded foreign to me, worn and tired from the day's events. I pushed open the door to my room, carrying her to the bed and setting her down on it. She sank into the soft fabric, limbs limp and pliant, her head lolling to the side as it rested on the pillow. I pulled out the extra blankets and threw them on top of her. Maybe she was cold? Maybe that's what it was? Did the dead feel cold?

No, that was a stupid question. After all, she wasn’t dead anymore.

"All warm now?" I brushed her hair from her face, and her eyes followed the movement, or... tried to. Only the one managed to meet my gaze. The other stayed trained on the ceiling. "Good night, Penny. You’re safe now." I whispered, bringing my lips to the cold surface of her forehead. Her lips twitched, parting for the slightest second to utter another choked groan.

I firmly closed the door behind me, fingers remaining on the brass knob until the coolness of the metal numbed my hand entirely. I pressed my head against the door and sighed. She was back. That was all that mattered, right?

The outside world became noise—search parties, missing person reports, her parents' grief. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was taking care of her. And that was what I did. I would be a liar if I said it wasn't rewarding. I’d wake up, check on her, clean the sheets, try to feed her soup she couldn’t swallow, watch the sun go down, whisper goodnight, and then start again.

Day in, and day out, until the cycle became routine.

It was Friday when something changed.

I got home late, the fluorescent hum of the supermarket still buzzing behind my eyes. Despite being away from Penny for eight hours, it felt like I never left her side. I saw her face on every telephone pole, heard her name whispered by every customer, and felt the pity in everyone's gaze.

But they didn’t know her like I did. They didn’t know where she really was.

She was here. Safe. With me.

I flicked on the lights, dropped my keys, and headed up the stairs. The house was still and silent, but not in the way that it used to be. Now there was another presence in it. A second body to care for. I pushed open the bedroom door and stepped inside, a smile already tugging at my lips.

"Hi, Penny. Sorry I'm so late." My voice was a whisper, as she didn't respond well to loud noises. Either with a scowl or a whimper, both of which I hated hearing from her. I told her about my day at work, knowing this was a one-sided conversation at best. Still, it was nice to have someone to talk to. "You're a great listener, you know that?" I joked once I finished, and she blinked, her lips twitching at the corner.

Then, she opened her mouth.

My heart stopped. She was speaking, trying to speak. Something was clawing its way up her throat, scraping against the silence. "Penny? What is it?" I leaned closer, her cold breath fanning over my cheek as I hovered over her face. But then it stopped. Whatever sound she'd been about to utter died in her throat, and the moment was gone.

She went silent, staring at the ceiling once again.

I cursed silently, sitting on the side of the bed and running my hands through my hair. I'd been so close, so close to hearing her again. I looked to her, the dim lamplight casting a golden hue across her skin, the soft shadows accentuating the curve of her face, the softness in her cheeks.

"Goodnight, Penny," I relented, brushing my fingers against her cheek. Flicking the lamp beside her off, I turned and headed out the door. Then came the whisper of shifting fabric. Then a click. Then light.

I whirled around. Her hand fell limp, dangling over the side of the bed, and her eyes closed, serene. I, however, felt no such peace. She... Moved. I should have felt relief, but a knot of dread formed in my stomach. I closed the door and looked at the cabinet down the hall. That would definitely be enough to hold the door. Maybe I should...

I immediately shot the idea down, chastising myself for daring to think something so barbaric. I had to trust her just as she trusted me now.

And so I forced the thought away and turned on the television to help lull my sleep-addled brain into submission.

When I woke up, the door to her bedroom was ajar, the blankets tossed haphazardly over to the other side of the bed. I shot to my feet, legs stiff from sleep, and nearly fell trying to get downstairs. My eyes scanned the room—left, right—then caught her. Penny was halfway out the front door, a hand clutching the frame to keep herself upright. Her steps were clumsy, the result of her head drooping to the side and throwing off her balance.

Panic gripped me, and I ran.

Before she could reach the threshold, I grabbed her by the waist and hauled her up. She resisted for just a moment before collapsing in my arms like a marionette with its strings cut. The sudden weight nearly dropped us both. I kicked the door shut behind me and staggered back into the house, dragging her into the living room. I eased her onto the couch as gently as I could.

Her one good eye wandered aimlessly around the room, examining her surroundings in silence as if it was her first time here.

"Penny?" I asked, gauging her level of consciousness. Her gentle swaying stopped, like a deer hearing a twig snap, but nothing followed. Still not a word in response. She could move, but lacked any sense of awareness. It would be... Dangerous, to leave her on her own, without someone to guide her away from danger, or from wandering off. "Penny, we're gonna go downstairs, alright?"

A quiet, strangled breath escaped her throat in response, and I moved beside the couch.

"Up we go..." I scooped my arms beneath her and cradled her like a bride as I descended into the basement. She didn't resist, sagging against me with unnerving pliancy. Although, this time she made an effort of keeping her head upright, unlike the last time I carried her. What I was about to do wasn’t moral. It wasn’t humane. But it was the only thing I could think of to keep her safe.

Her discomfort was a necessary price, one I would repay when the time was right.

I set her down on the most comfortable sofa, which, admittedly, wasn't much. "Sorry," I mumbled, grabbing a length of rope from one of the nearby shelves. I wrapped it carefully around her waist and the back of the couch, threading it through the frame before tying it off with a loose knot. Loose enough that any true effort could undo it. That she could escape, if she ever fully came back to me.

My hands lingered near hers for a moment before I pulled back. She sat still, blank-eyed, arms resting in her lap like a porcelain doll. I exhaled, tension bleeding from my shoulders. This was fine. She was safe. We both were.

The moment she gained enough awareness to recognize the atrocity I've committed against her, I'll free her from her restraints. I would beg her forgiveness and allow her all the time she needed to recover and accept whatever fate she chose for me.

But for now, I was the only one who could keep her safe. I left the lights on, the door ajar, and even moved the television in the living room downstairs. It was a process that took a little less than an hour, but the grateful expression Penny made—one I had to partially fill in myself—made it worth it.

I rarely slept in my own room after that, electing instead to sleep on another sofa in the basement. It was hard, dusty, and short enough that my feet hung off the edge. But I wanted to be near her. Every night, I watched the faint blue flicker of the television reflect off her face, casting shadows in the hollows of her cheeks.

During that time, she started to change. Imperceptibly, at first; a grimace when static buzzed on the screen or a small sigh at a particularly happy scene in the romcom. I was elated. My patience, and the time I spent with her, had been rewarded.

But progress was too... Fast. I couldn’t keep up.

The changes became more noticeable as the days passed. Her eye movements became more purposeful, scanning the room instead of wandering about like a drunkard. No longer did they look past me, or through me. Instead, they looked at me. Right at me.

It would only be a matter of weeks, maybe less, before she had the strength to untie herself. And then she could go... Anywhere.

Anywhere but here. Away from me.

The fear that once felt like a pinprick, a slight worry in the back of my mind, was now a gaping hole in my chest. I couldn't face it. The possibility that her first step might be towards the door instead of me.

I couldn’t imagine my life without her. The thought caused bile to rise in my throat. My legs moved before I could stop myself. I walked upstairs, into the garage, and found the old sliding bolt I’d never gotten around to using. The small, insignificant piece of metal felt heavy in my palm, rust flaking off the edges. It would have to do.

I screwed it into the door before taking a step back to admire my handiwork. It was the only thing keeping the world from her.

Just for now, I promised her in my thoughts. Just until I was sure. If she ever needed to go, I’d open it. I’d let her go.

I just… needed more time.

My stomach churned as I stepped into the basement, and the flickering light of the TV washed over my face. I sat beside her, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder. She leaned into the touch, her head rolling to the side to meet my gaze. Her eyes, though unfocused, looked brighter, more alive, than they had in weeks.

"You're getting better," I murmured, brushing a stray lock of hair from her forehead. She opened her mouth, and I waited for the gurgling, raspy breath that always followed.

"J..."

The world stood still. Her lips moved, and I held my breath. Just as I convinced myself it was all in my head, she continued.

"...Ohn."

She spoke. My Penny spoke.

It was the most haunting, beautiful sound I had ever heard. My heart swelled with ecstasy and hope. But when I saw her arms straining against the ropes, reality crashed back down. Her eyes met mine, and a soft whimper slipped from her throat.

“H…” she rasped. “Help. Me.” Her voice was broken, hoarse with disuse. Each word sounded like she was choking, each syllable dragged across gravel. Her arms strained, fingers curling against the fabric of the couch. But they were weak, and no matter how much she struggled, the ropes were too tight. "Help," she whispered again, staring at me with a single, pleading eye.

"I-I know, Penny." I stammered, forcing a smile. "I... I can't, not yet. So... Here. Here, watch this. It's your favourite show, remember?" I scrambled for the remote, turning on the television. Anything to distract her. But her remaining working eye never left my face. I swallowed hard, avoiding her gaze and fiddling with the remote in my hands.

"...Please." It was so quiet that I almost couldn't hear it. And yet, the weight of that word, of the pain behind it, was enough to make my chest ache. "John, please."

"It'll... It'll only be for a little while. Promise." I assured her, though the way she stared at me now was utterly unreadable. I couldn’t stand it. The desperation in her voice was unbearable, and a part of me wanted to set her free right then and there. Crimson tears spilled from the corners of her eyes, painting her lifeless cheeks red. "Please, Penny, don't... Don't look at me like that. I can't let you leave." I begged, desperately wiping away the seemingly endless waterfall of blood. Her gaze softened somewhat and she tilted her head slightly. Then, finally, the silence was broken by the quietest of words I had to strain myself to hear.

"K...kill me."

"Kill-..." I reeled back from shock and horror at the very thought, my feet stumbling over themselves. "Kill...? Kill you?" The mere idea felt sacrilegious. I had spent so long caring for her, hoping and praying she'd get better, and now... And now she wanted me to destroy everything I had worked towards? "No. No, no... Penny, please... Just... Get better, and I promise I can explain everything when you get bett-" She let a gurgling, keening wail, the loudest sound she had ever made in the last few weeks. I felt my heart drop to the pit of my stomach, and I fell silent. She just kept repeating those words.

"Kill me. Kill me. Kill me."

I couldn't take it anymore. I shot up, slammed the door behind me, and slid the bolt shut. My head hung low, tears stinging at the corners of my eyes. I pressed my forehead against the wood. Her cry echoed in my head, worming into my ears, my skull, until they were all I could hear.

"Please..." I whispered to no one, my nails scraping against the wood grain. "Don't hate me." My breath rattled in my throat, and the silence that followed was deafening. I didn't hear her again, even when I pressed my ear against the door. "Please..." I begged, a sob wracking through me. "I'm sorry. I love you. Please... Don't hate me." My words died in my throat, and I collapsed against the door, knees buckling and hitting the floor.

I couldn't go downstairs for the next 2 days, spending the most time away from her since she arrived in my home. At first it was the guilt. Then it was the fear. But finally, it was the dread that she would never forgive me for what I did. I didn’t want to see it—her face twisted in hatred, her eyes narrowed in disgust. It made it harder to imagine a smile tugging at her cold, dead lips.

When the third day rolled around, however, I found the will to enter the basement again. I pushed open the door and stepped inside, the dimly-lit room illuminated by the faint light of the television. The moment I turned the corner and entered her line of sight, her whole body stiffened, and her head snapped towards me. The movement was so sharp, so sudden, that I flinched.

"...Hey, Penny," I said, offering her a weak smile. "It's been a while, huh?" Silence. I expected that. "How are you feeling today?"

Her eye narrowed into a scowl, but she didn't make a sound. That alone was already a blessing.

"I know you're probably mad at me. A-and you have every right to be," I added quickly, sitting on the ground in front of her. "But, I promise, I'm going to make it up to you. Just... Give it some time. Get better, stronger, and then you can decide where you go." She stared at me, the blue of her iris overtaken by a sea of white. I could barely make out the rise and fall of her chest, and the occasional twitch of her fingers.

"Hurts." The word came like a punch to the gut, knocking the wind out of me. "Hurts." She repeated, more urgently this time. My eyes fell upon where the rope was wrapped, digging into the skin hard enough to bruise.

"I-I thought I was being careful..." I muttered to myself, kneeling in front of her and reaching for the rope. "Sorry, I'm so sorry." I loosened the knot, just enough for her to have some wiggle room, and she let out a soft whimper of relief. "There, better now?"

Nothing.

"You'll be out of these soon. I promise." My fingers reached out to tuck a strand of hair behind hear ear, but she turned her head away impudently, and my hand retracted. "Okay. Okay. I'll... I'll see you later."

I wanted to do something for her. So, the next day I went out and bought a bouquet of her favourite flowers, sunflowers, and a small stuffed animal.

"Hey, Penny." I called out. "Look what I got you." Again, I was met with little more than a scowl and a glare. I smiled weakly, setting the bear in her lap and the flowers on the coffee table. "Do you remember these? They’re your favourites." I brushed a hand over one of the yellow petals. "And I know you've been a little lonely lately, so I got you a friend." I lifted the stuffed animal and held it up to her face. The brown, plush fur brushed against her cheek, and her eye widened. "What do you think?"

Her head tilted to the side, her gaze fixated on the toy. She seemed entranced by the toy, the first sign of emotion I had seen from her since the other day. Finally, I did something right, and she would be happy.

"John..." But the tone in her voice wasn't one of delight or appreciation, but something else. Something that sent chills down my spine. "John..." Her lips parted, and a choked noise escaped her lips. Her gaze left the bear, trailing upwards with agonizing slowness until it landed upon jacket. "John... What's in your pocket?"

My blood ran cold. I froze, my grip tightening around the bear. "I... I don't know what you're talking about," I lied, too quickly. My right hand slid into my jacket, fingers curling instinctively around the cube. How she knew about it was beyond me. I had kept it hidden ever since I found it, and I was the only one who knew where it was. I was the only one who knew what it could do. So how did she know where to look? Could she... Sense it?

Her eye flickered across my features, as if absorbing every detail of my expression. "Okay, John." She said, her tone soft, almost disappointed. Her words were broken, each syllable pronounced with the utmost care. I stood there like a fool, the plush still clutched in my hands, unable to move. Her gaze fell back to the stuffed animal, and a faint smile graced her features. The sight made my chest tighten, but not in the way it usually did. "Thank you."

I swallowed, nodding stiffly before setting the bear back on her lap. "Of course."

It wasn't much, but it was progress. It was progress. I sheepishly left the room, the feeling of her gaze lingering on me long after I closed the door.

That night, I couldn't sleep. Every creak of the floorboards reminded me of her footsteps, and every passing gust of air sounded like her voice. She plagued my mind even when I tried to force her out, my thoughts returning to her no matter how hard I tried to resist. I tried everything, from reading to watching TV, but nothing could distract me. Soon, the sun crept over the horizon-line, and I had gone without so much as a wink of rest.

Unable to spend another second not by her side, I dragged my half-awake self to the first floor. As I reached for the handle of the basement door, a voice stopped me in my tracks. This time, without any hint of the despair that had wracked it prior.

"John?"

It was a sweet salve on my wounded mind and aching heart, and I melted at the sound. I opened the door, in order to bask in the dulcet tones of that beautiful, haunting voice. "Y-yes?" I asked, leaning against the frame.

"I..." Her words were careful, measured with a practiced calmness that made my hair stand on end. But her tone was warm, at least, and the first words she spoke didn't fill me with the dread of her prior requests. "I'm hungry."

Hungry? The mere word made my eyes widen and I couldn't help the smile that formed across my lips. She was hungry, she wanted to eat. It was a miracle! "Yes! Yes, of course!" I answered, not bothering to contain the excitement in my voice.

"Just a sandwich, please." Before she could finish speaking, I was already swinging the fridge door wide open, grabbing everything I needed to craft her the perfect sandwich. I assembled the ingredients in between two pieces of toast, cooked it, and rushed down the basement stairs holding the plate. Penny still remained tied to her chair and watched the doorway I walked through. She looked tired, and remnants of those bloody tears remained as a mark of the torment I caused, but she smiled the second she laid eyes on me.

"I hope this is good," I chuckled nervously, gently lifting the first half to her lips. She leaned forward, ever so slightly. Her lips parted just enough to accept the edge of the toast. And then—

A sharp jolt of pain shot up my leg.

"Ah-!" I yelped as my knee buckled beneath me. The plate slipped from my hand, crashing to the floor in a clatter of porcelain and scattered food. I fell forward, catching myself on the armrest beside her. "Penny?" Her eye was wide with a mix of shock and regret, and I realized that it was an accident.

"I-I tried to lean in, but my leg... I-I didn't," The bashful tone in her voice made my cheeks burn, and she stared at the sandwich, a pout on her lips. "I'm sorry."

"It's... Okay, no harm done. I'll get started on another one," I peeked at the mess of broken porcelain beneath her. "As soon as I clean that up." I stepped out briefly to fetch the broom and dustpan. The sweeping of the shards didn't take too long, although I made careful work to not cut her. She watched me silently the whole time. Once I was done, I excused myself and rushed to dispose of the broken plate. But before I could dump the remains into the trash, I noticed something. It didn't seem like the shards accounted for the entire plate.

I gently spread the fragments on the counter and got to work trying to piece them back together. Each puzzle piece fit perfectly, one after the other, until I was left with the near-complete plate.

Except for a large, jagged triangle that was missing from its centre.

The realization set in immediately, and I dropped the porcelain back onto the counter. My heart hammered in my chest as I sprinted back downstairs, praying to whatever god would listen that I was wrong. That she was better than that.

I was wrong.

The ropes lay in a heap on the floor, loose and limp, like shed skin. A few strands clung to the frame, the knots unravelled, their purpose lost. The cushions still bore the shape of her body, the only sign that she was ever there at all.

"Penny?" I cried out, scanning the room for her in the darkness. "Penny, please, what's going on?" My heart was in a panic and I peeked behind one of the shelves. Nothing. "Penny, talk to me. Where are you? Just... Just calm down." She had to be in here, somewhere. She wouldn't leave, right? She couldn't leave, not again. Not like this. "Penny, please, don't do this. Don't leave me. We can work this out!"

Then came a creak from behind. I turned around and, for a moment, saw a blur of gold and blue before a searing pain exploded in my side. A sharp gasp escaped my lips as I fell to the ground, desperately clamping my hand over the location of the searing pain. My palm burned, the warm liquid seeping between my fingers and onto the floor. I staggered backwards, holding my wound shut, only to see Penny's form looming over me.

The shard gripped in her hand leaked a steady trickle of red, but from how hard she was gripping it, I wasn't sure if it was mine or hers.

Worst of all was her expression; pity. It was as if I was some wounded animal, ready to be put out of its misery.

"Penny..." I rasped, clutching at my side. The blood stained my fingers red, warm and sticky. I felt sick. "Please, please, don't do this." Her eyes were empty, devoid of any emotion or remorse. She took a slow, calculated step forward, no longer encumbered by stiff joints, and her grip on the shard tightened. I tried to move away, to escape, but the pain in my side flared up, causing me to collapse to the ground with a pathetic thud.

I slammed my eyes shut and awaited for her to plunge that blade deep into my skull.

However, she instead knelt beside me and fished the object from my pocket. I didn't even try to stop her. I just watched with wide, fearful eyes as she held the cube in front of her face, her thumb hovering above the divot.

"It... It's what brought you back," I explained, despite knowing deep down she already figured it out. "It's what gave you a second chance. To... To live, again. You don't deserve to have your life taken away from you just because I..." I gritted my teeth, a fresh wave of pain shooting through my side. "I was an idiot and kept asking more of you, even though you were scared and hurt. I should have seen it, that I was being cruel and controlling and that... You died because of me. B-but I'm trying to make things right, Penny. I just want to keep you safe."

Her pale-blue eye left the cube for just a moment to lock with my gaze, and this time, both eyes were focused on me. There was a softness in her gaze, a hint of sorrow, that made me think that she understood. That she forgave me. That she would accept this second chance.

"You don't believe a single word of that."

The sharp end of the shard plunged into the centre of the cube. Over. And over. And over again. Crimson droplets splattered across her face and stained her pale skin red. A faint glow emanated from the cracks, and I felt the same energy from that day, With a loud snap and an inhuman screech that echoed throughout the entire room, it crumbled into bloody ashes that trickled from between Penny's fingers.

Her body was next, dropping like a discarded doll, limbs folding in on themselves. Her breathing, her twitching, and her heartbeat, all of it ceased in an instant. The light from her eyes dimmed, and her body slumped to the floor, as dead and unmoving as it had been that day.

With my consciousness rapidly fleeing me, I could do little but lay there on my back, clutching at my bleeding wounds and letting the pain take over.

I had failed her.

I don't know how long I was unconscious for. The exhaustion from no sleep probably caused me to black out for a few hours, at least. When I finally came to, I found myself in the same spot as before. It was noticeably quieter, and the chill that hung in the air was palpable. I tried to push myself upright, but a sudden numbing pain shot through my side, and I fell back to the floor. The wound was shallow, and I wasn't sure if that was because of Penny's mercy or my own luck. Either way, I was alive, for better or for worse.

Penny.

Ignoring the pain, I shot up and looked around the room. She still lay in a crumpled heap, the same spot I'd last seen her before she…

My breath hitched, and I slowly made my way to her. A wave of nausea passed through me as the subtle signs of decay made themselves clear. With the artifact no longer present to keep her with me, the process was quick and merciless. I flinched away, tears pricking my eyes. Muttering a silent apology, I wrapped her body up with the sheet I used during the first night.

The hole I dug from before was still intact, and still large enough to fit her in. I placed the body inside, grabbed the shovel from where I had abandoned it, and began filling the hole. I could only dump one pile of dirt on her before I stopped, my fingers unable to hold the tool any longer.

I couldn't.

The shovel fell from my fingers, and I collapsed beside the half-filled hole, burying my head in my hands. It was too much. Too much. This aching pain in my chest that tore my heart to pieces. This agonizing, crushing weight of guilt that pressed down on my shoulders, threatening to crush me. And that loneliness. That unbearable loneliness.

I didn't want to live in a world without her. I couldn't.

I didn't bother filling the hole up. Instead, I left it as it was and dragged my aching body back into the house. The house felt impossibly empty now. Every room echoed with her absence, every shadow reminded me of what I'd lost. No one would ever be able to replace her. Nothing would ever seal the hole she'd left in my heart.

No, not ever.

I know what I have to do now, what I should've done from the beginning. To make amends, to take responsibility.

I'll join you soon, Penny.
