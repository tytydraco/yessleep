The floor used to shake when the looms lined up just right. They were rapier looms, with one long spear of metal on either side that met in the middle and passed the yarn between them. There were fifty in total, all lined up along the second floor of the warehouse, and the noise when they ran together was an almost physical force. When I opened the door at the top of the dingy stairs at the start of every day, the sound grabbed me by the throat and pressed ragged fingernails into my eardrums. 

The looms exclusively made carpets, of every kind. They produced dainty lace that were meant to be admired but not walked on, and thick geometric rugs, and shaggy carpets that were piled with plush wool. On the ground level, underneath the looms, the rugs were sold in a huge warehouse-like store. They covered every floor and draped in heaps over display cases, each labeled with a neat price. It was an advertising gimmick more than anything; most of the profits came from contracts with department stores and furniture shops. It was a gimmick that worked, though. By the time that I came to work for the factory, it was well into the ‘80s, and most weaving operations had already shifted overseas. Kindling Carpets, on the other hand, enjoyed a brisk business. Something about shopping alongside the clamor echoing from upstairs, knowing that production was happening even as they loaded up their baskets, drew in customers. Tours of the upstairs were also offered for free, down carefully partitioned-off walkways, of course. 

I was the all-purpose handyman for the facility. It was my job to make sure that the weaving kept happening as it should, and to patch up anything that got broken in general. It was a cushy job, most of the time; if nothing was wrong, I went home early, and I got paid a good bit more than the grunts manning the looms. 

The only issue was Loom Four. 

“Well, I have to wonder where it goes, all that fabric rolling endlessly off the loom. Sometimes it seems like the world is adrift in it, like I’m stranded in an ocean of cloth that shifts beneath my feet and cradles me while I sleep,” Michael said. 

Michael said cryptic shit like that all the time. He’d wanted to go to school to be a philosophy professor, but his mama had been paralyzed in an accident, so he had to drop out of school to care for her. He never failed to mention that he had been through almost a full year of college, though, which was more than the rest of us combined. He had hair down to his waist that he only sometimes kept up in the bun that was required for long hair, and glasses that perched owlishly on the end of his nose. 

“Sure,” I said, not really listening to him. 

Loom Four held a certain notoriety for the workers. It broke down at least once a month, and was responsible for dozens of pinched fingers and bruised arms. The factory was as safe as it could be; everyone allowed near the machines was well-educated on how to operate them safely, and there were metal guards in front of the rapiers that did the weaving. But somehow, Loom Four always managed to leave sore spots littered over whoever got too close. The loom was worth more than our lives to the managers though, so we had no choice but to deal with it. It was an unofficial policy at that point to send people to it in pairs, one to operate the loom and the other to watch for any dangers. 

Loom Four had started emitting a rasping, rumbling, metal-on-metal scream that dwarfed the ambient noise in the rest of the room. I was sent to figure out what was wrong, and Michael was meant to watch the machine for anything that seemed wrong. 

The sound was coming from the back, where the vertical yarn of the warp was anchored. I turned the machine off, waiting until the clacking of the rapiers came to a complete stop, and knelt down on the floor. I shone a flashlight so that I could see into the shadowed corners. The other looms were adequately lit by the overhead lights, but Loom Four always seemed to gather darkness around it, like cobwebs collecting in the corners of an attic. 

“You know, Nietzsche believed that overcoming meaningless suffering is a measure of human endurance,” Michael mused. “That’s sort of like weaving, if you think about it.”

I mumbled something vaguely agreeable and kept focusing on the problem in front of me. I had spotted the issue. The frame had split in one spot, with one curl of steel pulling away from the rest like the peel of a banana. Every time the rapiers sent a new piece of yarn across, they would rub against the protruding piece of metal. 

“Hey, do you hear me?” Michael asked. He bent towards me, his hair falling gently into the weave, flush against the vertical strings that would become the basis of the carpet. 

“Hey, careful—” I said, sitting back on my heels. 

I didn’t press anything. I was asked, afterwards, if I was sure. If, maybe, I could have slipped, and jostled the loom into motion without noticing it. I was assured that I wouldn’t be in trouble, that accidents were a regrettable reality of the business, and they just wanted to understand what happened. But I didn’t touch anything. My hands were in my lap, and I was leaning away from the machine to look at Michael. 

I’ll swear it on my mother’s grave until my lips turn blue. Loom Four turned on by itself. It groaned to life all at once, without the slow startup that was typical. The first rapier went slicing across the base warp, grabbing Michael's hair as it went. The second rapier met the other in the middle and took up the yarn, pulling his hair with it. Michael jerked forward, falling towards the weave. He caught himself with his cheek inches from the yarn. The first rapier ratcheted forward again, catching his hair at the roots this time, and pulling it in great hunks to the right, where it was yanked away from his head in a fraction of an instant. 

Have you ever seen someone be scalped? I imagine that you haven’t. It’s a sight that I wouldn’t wish on anyone.

It didn’t happen instantaneously. Michael was fighting the whole time, trying to heave himself away, becoming more and more entangled with each swipe of the rapiers. His hair was wrenched from his head in sections, and his skin went with it, leaving only blood spilling in a waterfall down the bridge of his nose and over his lips. The hardness of his skull was just barely visible through all the red. 

I took a month off, after that. I seriously considered never going back. But as my savings started to dwindle, I found myself walking back up the stairs to the factory floor. Mostly I went back because the money was the best I was likely to get. A tiny part of me, though, was curious. There was something wrong with Loom Four, steeped in the rusted components and bloodstains, and I wanted to know what it was. 

I refused to do any repair on it when I got back. Instead, I sent the new workers, the ones who hadn’t learned to fear the loom yet, to do repairs, while I stood several feet back and offered instructions. If anyone asked, most days I would say that repairs went faster when I could observe from a distance and offer direction. When I was feeling especially honest, I might admit that I had never been a brave man.

I suppose that it had always been just a matter of time until Loom Four killed someone. 

There was yellow tape down the center of the weaving room, marking out the places where the tours were allowed to go. The groups were always small; there was never more than five people, and they were monitored at all times. The tours started at the beginning of every hour and lasted for about twenty minutes, and spots often had to be reserved weeks in advance. There was a sort of showmanship to it that made it appealing, I think. It was marketed as a peek behind the curtains, as an unveiling that few others got to witness. 

Most of the time, everyone behaved themselves. They listened well, they followed directions, they stayed behind the yellow line and didn’t go anywhere dangerous. But of course, we got the occasional asshole. 

I heard the man before I saw him. He was complaining to the tour guide, Amelia, claiming that since he paid, he should be able to go wherever he wanted in the factory. 

“I’m going to need you to speak more respectfully to me, sir,” Amelia said as they came into view.

He laughed, obnoxiously loud. “I’ll speak however I want, little girl.”

Amelia looked to be about two seconds away from punching his face in. “That is not acceptable. You can either apologize, or be removed from the building.” 

“You’re going to stop me?” he taunted, stepping backwards over the yellow line that marked off the tour area. 

I noticed, with a spike of foreboding, that he was standing closest to Loom Four. 

“Please return to the approved area,” Amelia said, obviously reaching the end of her patience. 

At the base of the loom, there were two spinning wooden dowels, pressed up close together, that stored the finished carpet. As the weaving continued, fabric was wound in a loop around and between the dowels. At its largest, the gap between the two was just barely big enough to stick a hand into, but it wasn’t truly dangerous. The most I’d ever seen anyone receive was a pinch to the finger.

He raised a finger to wave in Amelia’s face, his cheeks blooming red with anger. Amelia took a quick step to the side, and he pivoted to follow her, his shoes squeaking on the floor. As he did, he stumbled, and his feet crossed over each other. He wavered for a moment, trying desperately to steady himself. When he finally fell, he did it dramatically, windmilling his arms out to either side as he tipped towards the loom. He caught himself right before he hit the ground, his hands wrapping around the bottom dowel just in time to stop his knees from slamming into concrete. 

He turned to glare at Amelia, his expression promising accusations of criminal negligence and threats to sue, and the loom started moving faster. The rapiers fairly flew over the yarn, and the finished cloth grew with it, the dowels shaking as they tried to keep up with everything that was suddenly being deposited on them. The loom shook, violently, and the dowels came crashing together, his hands crushed between them.

He was stunned silent, his throat working but no sound coming out. One leg weakly kicked out behind him, but he seemed to be in shock. That lasted until the loom jolted again, and the dowels started reeling him in with the carpet, slowly mangling his arms. Then he screamed, babbling brokenly and hunching over his bashed and broken hands. He was an animal caught in a trap, trying to claw his way free. 

Almost as soon as he fell, Amelia had scrambled to turn the loom off, but it continued despite her efforts. Two of the others from the tour group were holding him by the shoulders, trying to yank him away while he sobbed.

Loom Four jolted one final time, and then he was gone. It happened too fast for me to track, like some giant hand had reached out from the darkness underneath the loom and yanked him between the dowels, crushing his bones to dust in the process. 

The sudden silence after all the screaming was stark. 

Most of the loom was made up of solid pieces of metal or wood, and the enclosed areas were completely filled with machinery. There was, quite simply, no feasible place for a fully-grown adult to go. I searched around the edges, up underneath the frame, and I even went downstairs to check if he had somehow fallen through the floor without leaving a visible hole. He was nowhere, and that startling absence was worse than if I had just found his corpse. 

He came out of the loom in pieces, over the course of weeks. His skin was first, woven into the carpets. Each piece of skin had been stretched into a long, yarnlike strand, and woven in with the regular yarn. It appeared as a pale thread zigzagging across the carpet that was squishy to the touch and slowly liquefied over time, oozing outwards like a fungus. The blood was next. Carpets would come out dyed a dark red when no red yarn had ever been added, and the scent of copper filled the air. Teeth started appearing after that, tied into the weave like decoration. 

At that point, finally, we were given permission to dismantle Loom Four. The first crew that was sent in ended up with broken bones, and at least two of them had to go to the hospital. The second crew all collapsed on the spot, instantly unconscious. When they woke up, they said that their nightmares had been inconceivably horrific. 

There were no more attempts after that. Instead, we stopped giving it yarn, and cut it off from electricity. It didn’t matter. Without yarn, Loom Four made carpets out of the only thing that it had available. 

It made tapestries out of skin and muscle, with thin spurs of bone around the edges. Broken bits of fingernail were stuck in the middle, or bundles of hair stuck out of the sides like tassels. Sometimes a piece of intestine wrapped around as a border, or a disfigured yellow glob of fat wobbled in the shape of a flower. The loom was perpetually stained with viscera, and a thick black curtain was soon put around it to hide it from view. That didn’t stop the smell, though. 

Exactly a month later, I quit for good. I had tried to forget about Loom Four and keep working, but I could feel its presence, even when I was on the other side of the room. It had no eyes but I could sense it staring at me, looming over my shoulder and breathing heavily on the back of my neck. I could feel its attention on me wherever I went, waiting with the trembling patience of a feral cat for me to step too close or pull back the curtain. I knew that if I stayed, eventually I would make a mistake. 

It’s been decades, but I still have nightmares about being torn apart and then woven back together.
