**(10:40 AM - 11:03 AM)**

I only sent out my last post just a short while ago; it feels odd, to be starting again this soon, but it’s important that I keep documenting everything — not even just for the sake of you all anymore, but for Clay, too. The more we both document our lives and the things that have happened, the easier it will be for him to “recover” his lost memories.

That got me thinking: repetition seems to create a stable memory, right? That *should* mean that eventually, he won’t forget that the resets happen. He won’t *forget* that he’s forgetting. He should eventually become used to the idea of coming to me for information, and maybe, if he rereads these memories every time, he’ll at least be able to retain everything that’s older than a few resets.

I can break him out of this cycle, little by little. I know I can. I just have to be persistent.

I know I should be thinking about that email from my father right now, but I still just don’t know what to do with it. For now, I want to stay focused on the things I already know what to do with, and then, once I’ve done all of that, I can sit back down and try to decide how to respond.

We’re going to head out to the City Archives here and see if we can get in without scheduling anything; it’s a long shot, but I don’t see the harm in trying. If that doesn’t work, we’ll go about it the usual way and hope for the best. As it is, the reset could happen today, if we’re unlucky; I just hope it at least doesn’t happen until I can get permission to be there down on paper.

**(3:08 PM - 3:39 PM)**

Yeah, so no entry even with a head Archivist from their neighboring city in tow, but on the upside, Clay knew exactly where to go to get the request handled, along with showing me to a pretty fantastic place to eat. *And*, we managed to secure entry for 9:00 PM tonight! Apparently, they don’t officially close their doors until 11:00 each night, and the same is true in Myosotia; I guess if any place is going to break curfew, the City Archive is a pretty good one to do it, but it does make me wonder why that is.

When I asked him, Clay just shrugged and said it’s a good question, but it’s been like that for as long as he can remember and no one’s ever made any fuss over it.

Well, whatever that reason is or isn’t, in the meantime, I guess we’re just going to be killing time. There are a few places he said are worth seeing while we’re here, so I’m just going to let him lead the way some more and see what comes out of it. I don’t know if where we’re going is mostly tourist sites or if it’s actually helpful to the cause in some way, but it’s not like I have anything better to do right now, so why not?

After we make a few stops, I might start finally going through all of the comments here that have been made since I last replied, respond to them, and then address them in this post if the need arises for it. I just want to spend a little bit of time looking around here before the possible reset time starts, since it’ll be at least another day before we can get back if that happens.

**(6:33 PM - 8:42 PM)**

I have to admit, as irritating as it is that we couldn’t get in the Archive before we were at any risk of a reset, it’s been kind of nice, to just live a normal life for a little while and only think about where we’re going to eat and what unimportant thing we’re going to do next.

It’s been a long time since I’ve stopped for a minute to actually just enjoy something in a pure and simple way, without worrying that I’m wasting precious time I could be using for something more productive to my goal. We looked around at some local monuments, shopped at a few stores for supplies, and just walked along the streets, taking note of the different buildings and talking.

For a little while, just a very small while, I almost forgot about the resets entirely.

I’ve been reading comments for a little bit now as we walk, though, as all of the shops have closed, and I’m reminded again like a swift kick to the gut that there is no real safety in this world, not really – not for the people like us who know too much. That semblance of normalcy I felt a moment ago is just the result of a well-maintained facade that likely exists solely for the purpose of not driving everyone into total madness — a state, one of you reminds me, that isn’t a far leap from where Clayton will inevitably end up if I fail to safeguard him, or maybe even if I do. 

For some reason, that thought terrifies me almost as much as the thought of never being able to go home again.

One of you mentioned the idea of taking him to see the family cabin and showing him the basement where I found this basement; I admit, the thought had crossed my mind back when I was arranging for the carriage that would take us here, but I decided that between the two options, this would be more likely to yield us some results in figuring out the history of this place and of “my” family. Still, I’m not against the idea. If we have the time once this is all over — and we *should*, if it’s really as simple as visiting the Archive tonight and preparing to head out tomorrow — I don’t see why I couldn’t take him there, as well.

Oh, and speaking of travel, another one of you wanted to know how exactly that works, how the carriage is designed, and how it is that the coachman and the horses don't lose their sanity during the night as all the rest of us would if we were to see anywhere outside the city walls. 

I’ve answered part of that question directly already, but for the sake of anyone else who might be curious, after doing a bit of research, it seems the most similar thing to what they call carriages here is what’s been considered a [steam bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_bus) in my (and, by extension, your) world; I couldn’t find an exact match to how the ones here look, but the first and third pictures linked in that article are probably the closest I can point you towards right now. It’s a lot like what you’d expect of a stereotypical horse-drawn carriage, but without any outdoor seating, as the coachman instead sits inside and steers with a wheel, pedals, and other such equipment, not too unlike a modern car.

As to how they don’t lose their sanity at night, that answer is very simple — I just don’t have any explanation for the numerous *other*, much more massive questions it raises; that is to say, the curtains are closed at night, and somehow the people assigned to these jobs seem to be able to *stay directly on the dirt path and steer the carriage without even looking*. No, I don’t understand how that’s possible in the slightest; during our last ride, Clayton explained to me that before any coachmen are ever allowed to travel at night, they are said to go through rigorous training until they know the path completely blind, and that very few make actually ever make that cut. People’s lives entirely depend on their unique talent, so selection for the job is hypercritical in every way.

“There’s a long-enduring gag in Myosotia that night coachmen are born, not made.” I remember him stating clearly, a smile on his face and an unsteady laugh escaping from his lips that I couldn’t help reading into as wondering if it actually somehow might not have been a joke, with how much his world had already been steadily turned upside down.

I felt terrible for him.

And now, *I’ve* been the one staring down the possibility that everything could be one massive lie, too. One of the comments I’ll probably respond to last has posed the possibility that all of this could be some kind of twisted show, using us all as puppets, built from the ground up as entertainment for some group of twisted individuals, or some sort of sick entity, or God only knows what else — that the whole reason we have so many curfews and wait times and rules is just to prevent us from peering behind the metaphorical curtains while our latest stage is being prepared. And the worst part is that I can’t really deny the logic behind that suggestion.

It’s actually been well over a day since I first read that comment, but I still can’t stop thinking about it anytime I’m faced with anything that seems even slightly odd. I know I shouldn’t overthink it — just bear it in mind and remain open to the idea, so that I’m prepared but don’t entirely lose my sanity in the process of running through all of these scenarios, just like the commenter who left it said, but really, I think that’s far easier to say than to actually have to contend with.

Helpful as it is for calculating the time my family and I are now separated by (by my calculations, it would be about 2:23 PM for them, as I write this at 7:23 PM here, though math has never been my strong suit), knowing that I’m not even occupying the same time zone as my family anymore doesn’t help that feeling.

I know that it’s wrong and illogical, but somewhere in the back of my head, I find myself making up these crazy conspiracy theories that I’m not even really in some other world, I’ve just been kidnapped and left trapped in a fabricated, walled-off city just as some sick experiment to see what I and others will do with that scenario.

But then I remember the resets. They couldn’t just fabricate those easily, could they? Indoors, maybe, with some sort of gas or drug, but out in the open air, all at once? And besides, I have one commenter who assured me I am in another world, because they’ve been able to visit it from my normal reality, briefly body-hopping to another version of themselves that lives here and has some sort of awareness of this world.

Normally, I’d have been skeptical of that, but after going through all of this, I don’t see any particular reason to doubt it.

I was told by them that I might find some important answers by seeking out someone who had lost their sanity from seeing too much, but who was nonviolent — that allegedly if I could find such a person, they would hold cryptic but helpful answers I might able to parse out in a particular way.

Meanwhile, the person who suggested to me that this entire city and its surrounding locations could be a fabrication offered me a few other ideas to try: I should either attempt to break in to one of the places that close after nightfall and see what’s actually going on in there after those times, or I could find someone I deemed morally evil in every book possible and throw them outside the city walls at night while filming it with my camera.

Well, as I stated there, there unfortunately isn’t a camera on this device, so that option would be out of the running even if I was down to be complicit some morally bankrupt person’s death – which, let’s make it perfectly clear that I’m not, since I don’t know anyone here who truly fits that irredeemable description, and I wouldn’t want to risk the jail time I might face for breaking more than my share of laws in the process even if I did.

So that leaves me with finding someone who’s seen too much and trying to get information out of them, and trying to get inside one of the buildings after lockdown, to see what’s going on inside. I *can* do both of those things; I just don’t know if I want to involve Clay in the latter one.

It’s not just a matter of possibly getting him in trouble with some kind of authorities; it’s a matter of worrying what we find in there might further driving his mind to break. We don’t know what we’re going to find. What if it’s something unspeakable? I know I was told by one of you that I’ll *have* to risk my life eventually for something, if I ever want to be free, but do I have to sacrifice someone else’s well-being, too?

Well, I’ll think it over. It doesn’t have to be tonight. There may not even be a tonight, soon enough, if there’s a reset.

…Speaking of which, we’d better be on our way back to the Archive, since it’s almost time for us to go in, and we need to get as much information as we possibly can before that happens.

There are still a few comments I wanted to address in here, but, they’ll have to wait for another time. I’m sorry.

**(12:51 AM -  1:26 AM)**

We’re back at the hotel. I’m going to make the dangerous assumption that we’re safe from the reset for now, and take the time to update you, because there’s only an hour left that it could happen, and I don’t think all of this should wait until tomorrow’s post. It’s not the smartest plan in the world, I know, but we already had the room reserved for several days just in case we needed it, or in case the reset was to happen, so no one would get our room before we could get back to it. 

And honestly, right now, I just really need some rest and down time from all of this as soon as I can get it. I need to get away from all of the stress again for a little while, even if it’s just for the night. I think we both do, honestly.

I’ll talk more about the details in tomorrow’s post, but you know how there was supposed to be record of my family here? More than in Myosotia? Well, there is, but it isn’t much. I was able to find out where my grandparents used to live in the city, and a few more details about the company they had, but that was it. Before them, just like with Clay’s family, the records just seemed to end. So we started searching further back, assuming maybe their parents just weren’t notable enough, and we *did* manage to find mention of at least *one* other distant member of my family eventually, but that search to keep finding my family members also led us to something else.

At least a third of the books in that archive are completely blank. Maybe even more than that. I mean *completely* blank. They have absolutely nothing in them – just empty page after empty page with years and numbers and letters slapped on the outside like every other book, like they contain something. Like they’re a part of the records. But they aren’t.

We put them back as quickly as we could after checking them, so they wouldn’t find out that we knew, but we documented which rows it was that were like that, and what years it covered. We checked every single book on each shelf in those areas, and not a single one had anything. It was so many of them. 

I think Clayton was even more affected by this realization than I am. Now, he’s starting to wonder if even all of the books in his Archives are really full like they’re supposed to be, or if all this time he’s been so close to evidence that something was terribly wrong here. 

I can hardly blame him. Right now, it really does feel like the whole world’s gone mad, and then some. Even my father seems to be acting strange, and he isn’t even here. You don’t just say “I miss you” when you get a message from your child who’s been missing for over a month and then call it a day, do you? I’m honestly surprised none of you seemed to be as disturbed by that as I am. Maybe I‘m just overthinking it. Maybe we both are. Maybe we’re overthinking everything. 

This thing with the books has to be related to the amnesia, right? But why would there be so many years of complete gaps? Is it just that nothing remarkable happened then? Is it that people forgot to record at all? Or is it something more sinister?

I don’t have any answers tonight. Only questions.

I’m going to try to convince Clay to rest, and then I’m going to bed too. I got us a few drinks. Might not wake up on time to post this when I normally would, but that’s fine. All that matters is I get it out there.

Tomorrow, I hope I’ll have a clearer head. I’ll figure out what to do then. Or maybe I’ll take the day off from everything, try to make sure neither of us slips a groove from all the insanity we’ve been facing. I don’t know. I’ll figure it out.
