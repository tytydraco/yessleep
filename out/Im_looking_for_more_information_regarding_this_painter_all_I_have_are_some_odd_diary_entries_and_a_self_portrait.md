Ok everyone, most of you might not know me, and you probably never will, but in my spear time I started researching about this French painter named W.J Megries. 
I found an old self portrait of them as I was browsing on Pinterest and from then on I kinda fell down a rabbit hole. 
At first I thought it was Al generated, but looking at it closer something felt off about it. It didn't had that Al uncanniness to it you know? It was just... weird, not off or disturbing, but oddly alien. 

I started researching on some art books and even went on to recover an old Treccani Enciclopedia, since those old boxes of dust and paper had almost any possible information in them, but nothing. 

Wikipedia didn't help either surprisingly enough, so I just started browsing old forums in search of answers. 

This is what I found: Apparently this guy has gone MIA around the beginning of the 20th century, alongside all of his belongings, yes even that painting I found on Pinterest. 

The guy was also some weird traveling hermit, he wore this odd respiratory mask and traveled around the world just because. 

Apparently he had an apartment in London and was presumably a friend of a bunch of high class oddballs. 

I'm kind of baffled that such a peculiar character was just forgotten as if they never existed.

Apparently many people had already tried to piece together his disappearance and some have even discovered some notes he scribbled in his diary. 

These entries are kind of odd though, and since I've only managed to find blog posts containing the text and no real pictures of the pages, I originally took them with a grain of mistrust, but they gave very specific descriptions of where they were found, so I'm starting to doubt that a bunch of people started putting together such a well orchestrated lie on various forums.

So here's one of the entries that I was able to find alongside the circumstances in which they where found, again, if you have anything that can help me uncover more about this man, feel free to write it in the comments, much appreciated.

Entry I

This page from W.J Megries' diary was found in one of the buildings of the immense estate of the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, on Lake Garda in Northern Italy, known as the Vittoriale. Although D'Annunzio was an eccentric collector, it is still unclear how he came into possession of this page, however it is clear why this piece entered his collection, since it speaks precisely of his country of which he was so proud. However, the contents must have disturbed him greatly considering how hard he had worked to hide it.

During the summer I was invited by some nobleman whose name I struggle to remember to his estate in Sicily. This man was one of little importance, proud and haughty, who had made his lineage his personality.

However, it had been a long time since I visited Italy and so, despite the nauseating company, I decided to depart. I didn't stay long in the nobleman's villa, I preferred to spend my days walking and listening to the stories of the locals, putting to good use what little Sicilian I had managed to study. 

One evening I was late painting and it was getting dark, a local family offered to host me for the night and I willingly accepted. When I was about to fall asleep, however, one of the children, the youngest,started walking out of the house, evervone was sleeping soundly and onlv I noticed the child's movement. Trying to be as quiet as possible I decided to follow him outside, using a candle to illuminate the road in front of me. 

The child walked slowly, lolling like a sleepwalker. I tried to shake him to wake him up, but he didn't respond, he just kept walking. 

Intrigued by this strange behavior I decided to follow him, we walked for about half an hour until we arrived in front of an old well. 

Around us there was only an ocean of shadows, not even the stars were shining that night, and to accompany this, a silence so profound that it clogged my throat, it was like being a castaway at the mercy of the waves supported only by that raft which in my case was the light of the candle.

Suddenly I heard a buzz coming from the well, and the child started walking again. Instinctively I grabbed his shoulder begging him to stop, but it was as if the surrounding silence had stolen my voice, I wanted to scream, but I couldn't speak, I wanted to cry but my eyes weren't watering. 

As I sank into my own terror, something in the shadows tightened around my ankles, fell to the ground, and whatever had attacked me began to drag me into the well. 

Then suddenly I heard a little voice calling me in Sicilian dialect, and I woke up near the same place I was in the dream, drenched in sweat, the child was next to me together with the rest of the family, everyone was staring with a relieved expression. 

I looked at the sky, the stars were illuminating the night once more, and the crickets animated the silence of the countryside. 

I screamed, I bursted into tears.
