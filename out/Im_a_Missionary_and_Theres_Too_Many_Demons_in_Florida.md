*“She’s not pulling punches no more!”* It was a much more chilling phrase than most would realize.

Cassara wasn’t your average person, and while I hadn’t seen her fight before, I had seen her kill.

The man she dumped into the ocean didn’t even have time to react to Cassara snuffing him out.

I rushed to Reginald to help him to his feet, “She’s got a blade on her somewhere,” I warned.

“Oh, Terrific.  Good to know,” Reginald grunted as Cassara moved towards us.  Reginald grabbed my backpack off me, tossing it at Cassara.

Cassara growled, catching the backpack in her fiery hand, pausing briefly to do so.  

Her firsts ignited in flames, though a different color now.  They were blue before, but now the fire was red.  It also didn’t appear nearly as hot, as my backpack wasn't engulfed in flames. 

“The hell did that do?!” I shouted as Reginald grabbed my shoulder and pulled me down a hallway.

“Bought some time,” Reginald turned to see Cassara charging towards us, “not much.”

Cassara’s face was emotionless as she rushed Reginald, and she jumped with shocking speed, lifting her knee up to hit Reginald in the chest.

He barely blocked her knee with his meaty hands, only for Cassara to bring her right forearm down hard on his shoulder, knocking him back.  As she struck him, the flames around her fists flickered before reigniting.

Reginald coughed, cracking his neck, “Fuck,” he grumbled, “She hits hard.”

Cassara wasn’t letting up, rushing Reginald again.

Reginald put his fist up, and dodged her next swing, sending a huge fist flying to Cassara’s face.

Cassara ducked, and thrust her palm heel up, knocking Reginald directly in the armpit.

Reginald staggered back, and my eyes went wide as Reginald’s cool demeanor cracked.  

I looked to the hulking ‘fixer’ Reginald in shock.

Cassara was a tall, and obviously a physically fit woman, but Reginald was built like a brick shithouse.

“Dude, don’t hold back, she can take it!” I shouted.

Reginald jumped to the side, taking a few steps to try and get distance between Cassara and him, “I ain’t!” He growled.

“Get her in a headlock or something!” I shouted, “You’re stronger than her!”

“My fists ain’t on fire!” Reginald growled as Cassara rushed him again, and by the time he got his distance, he had put on his knuckle rings.  He swung a huge and wide open handed strike, going for Cassara’s throat.

Cassara ducked, instead catching his open hand on her cheek.  

I flinched as Reginald got his first hit in on Cassara.

Cassara dropped to one knee, and for a moment I thought she was down.  But she shook her head, adjusted her jaw, and fixed Reginald with a withering gaze as she pulled out her knife.  The hand that held her knife no longer wreathed in flames.

“Fuck,” Reginald tightened up his fists, his eyes focused on her knife wielding hand.

I looked around, spotting Brittney in the center of the foyer, a wide grin on her face, “Get him baby!  He’s tryin’ to hurt me!  I love you sweetie!” She shouted as if to encourage Cassara.

I tried to think of some way to attack Brittney again, I knew full well that she was controlling Cassara.  I was also certain that if she saw me running for my backpack, she’d be quick to stop me.

As I tried to think of some way to help, Cassara had advanced on Reginald again.

She pulled her knife back to her right, and swung it in a wide arc at Reginald.

Reginald barely managed to block with his left hand, the knife sparking at it glanced off his metal rings.  The rings, sadly, didn’t completely protect him.

The glancing blow definitely struck one of his knuckles, blood trickling over his fingers and revealing one of the rings had broken.

Despite this, either through will or just not realizing he was hit, Reginald gave a sharp upper cut to Cassara’s jaw, sending her backwards.

Reginald didn’t let up, hopefully taking my advice that Cassara could take whatever he threw at her, and he gave her a firm kick to the chest, sending her down.

As Cassara hit the ground, Reginald whipped out his second set of collapsible knuckles, and slipped his right fingers through the four rings.

I tried to slowly move around Brittney, to see if I could avoid the fight and get behind her.

Brittney’s eyes flicked to me quickly, however, as she walked over to my backpack, “Oh no, tiger.  No more funny business from your bag of tricks!” She said as she hefted the bag, struggling slightly as she did so, “Woah, what’s in here, dumbbells?!”

I lifted an eyebrow.  

Brittney was a demon but it seemed her power wasn’t physical, rather she used others to do her dirty work with her succubi powers.

Brittney also kept her distance from me, which reminded me that when she first saw me, she ran.

I tried to piece together some way to get my bag away from her, or free Cassara by attacking Brittney, while not ending up like Cassara: bent to the Succubus Brittney’s will.

My attention was grabbed as Cassara gave a grunt of effort.  I turned to see her kick flip to her feet, and she rushed Reginald, starding low.

Reginald threw a vicious punch, only for sparks to fly as Cassara swung her blade at Reignald, his knuckles deflecting the blow.

Cassara spun from the force of his deflection, but didn’t waste the energy.

She grabbed the knife in both hands and leapt into the air.  She was intent on driving her knife directly into Reginald’s head.

Reginald brought both of his meaty fists up, and glared at Cassara as he moved to block her strike with his steel knuckles.

Sparks flew, and while I saw the blade of Cassara’s knife break, and go flying in my direction, my hope was short-lived.

The knife was covered in blood, and I heard the sound of more metal clattering to the ground as Reginald staggered back, more rings of his steel knuckles falling to pieces.

As Cassara advanced on him, however, Reginald flung the remaining bits of his broken knuckles at Cassara’s face.

Cassara was a skilled fighter, that much I could easily tell just from watching her attack.

But Reginald was a street fighter, of sorts.  He clearly had little issue with using whatever means he had to survive a fight, and dirty tricks weren’t out of his skill-set, that much was certain.

As Cassara lifted her arms up to block the bits of metal, Reginald took full advantage of the opening.

With his massive arms opened, he rushed Cassara, and grappled her with a crushing bear hug, pulling her arms against her chest.

Cassara’s teeth were gritted as her yellow tinted eyes glared at Reginald.

“Sleep, bitch,” Reginald growled as he started to close his grip on Cassara.

I heard joints popping as Cassara seemed focused on holding her breath for some reason.

“Don’t let up babe!” Brittney shouted, shaking my backpack, “We’re gonna celebrate with a drink later…” Brittney fixed me with a mischievous grin, “And if you’re lucky there, feather brain, I’ll keep you around for dessert.” 

I glared at Brittney, “Let her go!  Reginald isn’t going to kill her but he’s got her locked down!”

Brittney giggled, “Oh, you think so?”

A loud grunt from Reginald drew my attention back to the brutal brawl happening in the foyer.

Cassara’s head was against Reginald’s for a moment, as I realized that she had just delivered a vicious headbutt.

Reginald, for the most part, was unfazed.

Cassara was even less so as she reared her head back further and slammed her forehead against Reginald’s again.

Reginald, for his part, did his best to block her strike with his forehead, both of them bleeding from the strikes. 

Reginald, however, appeared dazed now.

Cassara pulled her head back faster this time, thrusting her head forward and smashing Reginald’s nose.

Reginald’s grip must have loosened just enough, because Cassara was able to get her arms free.

With that she wrapped her arms around Reginald's chest, dropped her knees slightly, and hefted the large man up.

My eyes went wide as I watched Cassara throw her weight, and his, backwards, launching Reginald into the air, and crashing him to the floor behind her.

“Wooo! German Suplex!!” Brittney shouted, like a WWE ring announcer, “Outta now-where!  Baby I’m gonna make you feel *so* good later!”

“That’s an RKO!” I growled, agitated, hoping to distract Brittney somehow.

“What?” Brittney turned to me, “The fuck are you chattering about mid-night snack?”

“They say ‘RKO, Outta nowhere,’ not German Suplex!” I corrected.

“Well, excuse me Mister ‘fighting expert,” Brittney grinned, motioning with her thumb at Cassara, “By the way, we’re arguing semantics and big-buff-and-bitchy over there’s about to put the Coup de grâce on your buddy boy!” 

I turned, my eyes wide as I saw Cassara about to stomp down on Reginald’s throat.

I shut my eyes tight, my heart hammering in my ears.

That’s when something felt like it cracked inside of my head.  Not a painful crack, more like a crack of relief you get when you bend your fingers back.

I opened my eyes after a few moments, looking up to see Cassara’s spirit glaring down at Reginald’s.  Everything moved in slow motion, almost as if being viewed through a high speed camera.

Her hair was wreathed in flame, and the fire around her aura was roiling all around her.  Her spirit, as a note, was smaller, but more concentrated.

It pulsed tightly through her body, as if she was channeling it.  Swirling around her fists were the red sprites I had seen earlier, the blue ones were still there, but much further away.

That’s when I spotted a bright gold chain wreathed in yellow energy, thin like a strand of jewelry, leading from the back of Cassara’s neck towards Brittney.  

The chain coiled around Cassara, leaving pulsing veins of energy crawling across her skin, wrapping around her fists, and even her eyes.

It looked down-right painful.

Reginald’s aura was concentrated entirely around his body, appearing faint.

If I could reach the chains, I knew I could break them.  But I feared leaving my body again.

The last time I did, I had a heart attack, and there’s no way I could move physically fast enough (or with enough force), to stop Cassara.

I stepped out regardless, determined to do something.

As I stepped away from my body, something was different.

I turned to see my body encased in a light blue shield of some sort, arcs of my white essences swirled over it.  Connecting at the small of my back was a blue tube of sorts, with my white essence swirling within. 

I looked to Cassara and Reginald, and flew towards her.

I lifted my wing up, and went to swing it down at the golden chain on the back of Cassara’s neck.

Before I could, a glowing whip wrapped around my neck, pulling me off center, forcing me to face Brittney.

“Ah-Ah-Ah,” Brittney said, “That’s *my* toy, buddy!”

“Release my friend!” I shouted as I was pulled off balance.

I reached my feathers to the whip, but before I could it uncoiled, flying back to Brittney’s other hand.  

She held the handle in one hand, the end of the whip in the other.  

I was shocked that unlike everyone else, Brittney was moving at normal speed for her and I.

Without much else to do, I decided to rush her.

Brittney spun, swinging her hoof foot towards me in a spinning kick.

I ducked down, her hoof flying over my head.  “How are you doing this?!  Everyone else is frozen in place! Or… something.”

“You mean: ‘How can I view the spirit world as well as you do’?  Wow you’re fresh from the patch ain’t yah kiddo?” Brittney laughed, her hoof slamming down near me, “I’m a fucking demon!” She grinned, she snapped her whip taunt between her hands, ready to lash out again, “We Succubi have fought off you angels before!  Hell, my best friend Sara probably kicked your boss’s ass in the Vatican!” 

I dodged the whip as best I could.

I could tell that, in this world, I didn’t seem to have the same weight I did normally.  

Though that might have been the fact I didn’t have arms.  “I’m not an angel!” I snapped.

“Well you could have fooled me,” Brittney hissed as she pulled the whip back for another crack.  

I could see the golden chain that was attached to Cassara.  It was growing out of Brittney’s chest, as if her heart was directly controlling Cassara’s.

Without thinking, I lunged for it.

Brittney sidestepped me, “You do realize that while stuff moves differently on this side of the veil, my new Girlie over there is still about to crush your big brute’s windpipe like a party-popper?”

I paused, spotting that, while it was at a snail's pace, Cassara was slowly moving her boot down to do just that on Reginald’s prone body.  

“After your buddy goes *squish* I’m going to have fun with your *friend*,” Brittney taunted as she swung the whip once more, “I’m gonna drain her of every ounce of strength and be the strongest succubus on earth!” She cackled as the whip snapped in front of my face as I tried to once more get near the chain linking Cassara and Brittney.  

I glared at Brittney, “Why are you doing this?”

“Uh, duh, so you don’t send me back to Hell?” Brittney scoffed, “Man you must be new at this whole ‘Angel of God’ thing, huh?”

“Yes!” I snapped, glaring at her, “You’re a demon, you belong in Hell!”

“And you’re gonna go to Heaven, so all things considered, I think you’re getting the better end of the deal if you ask me!” Brittney sneered as she moved to cut me off from the chain connecting her and Cassara, “So just be a good servant of God, and go see Him, Okay?!”

I growled, shouting loudly to Cassara as I saw her foot starting to come down closer towards Reginald’s throat, “Cassara!  It’s David!  Snap out of it!  I know you’re stronger than this. She's just some Blond Bimbo!”

I watched as the chain pulled taut between Brittney’s chest and Cassara’s neck.  The metal began to glow near Cassara as her foot stopped.

I watched as the blue sprites floating near her head started to grow closer to her.

“Cheater!” Brittney hissed as she turned and kissed the chain, a new wave of yellow energy ran down the chain and against Cassara’s neck.

The chain thickened slightly, and Cassara’s foot started to move once more.

“You’re calling *me* a cheater?!” I snapped.

“I’m a demon,” Brittney said, “I’m supposed to cheat?  Wowsers, you *are* new.”

“Wowsers?!  Where the hell are you from?!” I growled.

“Wisconsin!” Brittney laughed, “Like… I dunno, 1950 something?  I forget, it’s been almost a century, alright?” 

I screamed and went to slap Brittney across the face. Normally, I would never hit a woman, but as Brittney had said repeatedly: She’s a demon.

Brittney stepped to the side, but the edge of my feather grazed her cheek.

To my shock, it sliced her cheek open.  A burst of yellow mist shot from her face as she leapt back.  

I paused, glancing at the edge of my wing.  I saw bits of Brittney’s aura boiling against my black feather.

I might not have been an Angel, per say, but I had the wings of one.

The thought clicked in my head as I realized that: Brittney hadn’t touched my wings directly, not once.  Only her whip had touched them, and she was keeping me at a distance the entire time.  

I flexed my feather, feeling it was still soft as I looked up to Brittney, whose face fell as she saw the gears turning in my head.

“Oh fuck,” Brittney winced.

The angel feathers didn’t need to do anything more than merely touch Brittney, and her demonic power would fail against them.

To add, I doubted Cassara would suffer any damage from them.

I crossed my wings over my chest, and imagined several feathers letting loose as I whipped both of my wings forward.

Brittney’s eyes went wide as three feathers from each of my wings flew in her direction, “Eek!” she ducked, and as she did one of the feathers grazed the chain, causing a few of the links to weaken and tarnish, the yellow energy vanishing.

“Cassara!  She’s using you, wake up! Do you really want to kill Reginald?!”  I shouted, “You still need to find out where he got those knuckledusters!”

Cassara’s red aura rushed down the chain, clashing with Brittney’s yellow energy around the weakened links.

As their energies clashed, the chain snapped.  Each link then disintegrated and fell apart one by one in either direction.

With that, the blue spirits that had kept their distance from Cassara rushed towards her, and began to swirl around her arms and fists.

“Oh,” Brittney watched as the chain in her chest disintegrated, “Buttons!”

I grinned at her, “No one is going *squish* after all.”

Brittney frowned as I rushed back to my body, shutting my eyes tightly.

When I opened them, Cassara had her foot hovering over Reginald’s face, the yellow vanishing from her eyes.

“Cass!” I shouted.

Reginald coughed, looking listlessly up to Cassara, “You hit hard for a broad.”

Cassara’s lip lifted in a sneer as the flames shifted from red to blue around her hands and she turned her rage toward Brittney, “How fucking dare you fuck with my head!” Cassara charged at Brittney with a renewed anger, “You bleach blond bitch!”

Brittney pulled back, grabbing her whip and letting it fly at Cassara.

Cassara lifted up one of her burning blue fists, Brittney’s whip wrapping around it as Cassara’s blue flames rushed up the leathery whip and to Brittney’s hand.

Brittney gasped in pain, dropping the whip as she staggered back, “L-Listen I just was trying to defend myself and-”

“You kissed me,” Cassara snapped, as she closed the distance between her and Brittney, and grabbed Brittney’s wrist with her other burning hand.

Brittney cried out and fell to her knees as her hand was writhed in blue fire.

“*Without* my consent!” Cassara tugged Brittney towards her, kneeing the succubus in the stomach, sending Brittney down to the floor. As she landed she coughed up a mixture of black and yellow sulfurous liquids. 

“That’s for making me fight someone who didn’t deserve it, by the way,” Cassara snapped.

I helped Reginald get to his feet, glancing at Cassara's burning fists, “So, the blue ones are like, your ‘in control’ flames?” I asked.

Cassara’s eyes moved to me, narrowing, the normal dark maroon of her eyes far more pronounced, “You tell me, fly boy.”

I winced.

“The two of you need to quit yer bitchin’,” Reginald growled, “I’m the one that got my ass beat.  By a chick no less.”

“Yeah well, you’re no pushover Reggie,” Cassara quipped.

Brittney’s hooves scraped against the floor as we saw her attempting to crawl away.

“Table this for later?” I asked.

“You better spill everything later David, got it?” Cassara threatened as she moved to Brittney and pressed her heel down on the end of Brittney’s tail.

Brittney screamed in pain, “Fuck fuck, that’s sensitive!”

Cassara ground her foot on Brittney’s tail harshly, causing Brittney to cry out again, “Talk, Succubus:  What are you up to you?”

“Ow!” Brittney whined, “That really hurts, Butchy!”

Cassara sneered, “you want your nose busted too, whore?”

Brittney winced, “Well what the fuck am I supposed to call you lady? You came on kind of strong, okay?!”

I walked over to Brittney, “Why are you just wandering around here?  Feeding on men? Turning them into Zombies?”

“I mean, I was feeling snackish so I took a little stroll while I was on my mission, okay?” Brittney confessed, “And, they’re technically a kind of Ghoul.  Vampires make them too, yah know.  What do you think happens to the corpses when we’re done draining them?”

“And they can suck the life out of people, too?” Cassara growled, pushing harder on Brittney’s tail.

“OW!” Brittney cried, “Yeah!  If they drain enough they become an incubus under my direct control!  I just wanted some minions, okay?!  Would help on the Mission.”

“Mission?” Cassara asked, “what mission?  From the Devil or something?”

Brittney groaned, “*the* Devil?  You gotta be specific, there’s like twenty devils down in Hell, okay?  Though you’re probably talking about Lucifer,” Brittney shuddered. 

“Bet your boss ain’t keen on you fucking up, huh?” Reginald said, twisting a few of the broken rings of his steel knuckles off and sliding them onto individual fingers, “You afraid of him?”

Brittney looked up to Reginald, genuine fear in her eyes, “Do I fear the dude who has a thing for hanging people for all eternity from the ceiling of his throne room for funsies?  Well let me think? Uh, Yeah, duh!” 

“Then why listen to him?” Cassara asked.

“You think I have a choice?” Brittney sneered.

I remembered the chains around Brittney's neck, hands and feet, “You’re a slave.”

“Ding Ding Ding!  Tell the dreamboat what he won, Johnny!” Brittney announced.

I paused, “Where the Hell are you from?”

“Wisconsin,” Brittney informed.

“From when, the 1940s?” Cassara quipped.

“Like I told yah before, 1954 last I remember,” Brittney admitted.

Reginald lit a cigarette, taking a deep inhale, “Bitch is stalling for something,” he informed, “We shouldn’t hang around.”

“Stalling?” I paused as I felt a strange sense of dread fill the room, “For what?”

My arms tingled as the air felt cold and unsafe.

I turned around to see the violet glowing sigil that Brittney left on the floor of the foyer. Violet steam rising up from it. 

In a flash, violet smoke poured from the sigil.

After a few seconds, standing over the seal was a black haired and violet-eyed woman in a very proper gown, almost as if she walked out of a Victorian era fantasy.

Atop the normal dress, which was violet with throne-like etchings throughout the fabric, was a tarnished bronze chest piece, she wore gloves with similar bronze cladding along the fingers forming to sharp pointed claws.  

She stepped forward, her body moving and the sound of her heels clicking against the floor, though her shoulders and midsection appeared to be floating.

As she stepped away from the violet seal, I could see several symbols along concentric rings, with an Omega symbol at its center.

The voice that came from her lips was a very posh British accent, her flawless lips, covered in purple lipstick, her face expertly made-up, “Brittney, I see that you can’t handle even the most simple of tasks.”

My heart hammered in my chest as Brittney chuckled, “Oh you two are gonna get the royal shaft now!”

Cassara rushed to get in front of me, I took a step back, grabbing Brittney’s tail, watching her wince as my hand touched her, “No funny business from you,” I threatened, “Who’s this bitch?”

“My boss,” Brittney hissed as her tail wriggled in my grip, “The one I was stalling for sweet-cheeks,” Brittney winked at me.

I was about to ask for more details before the posh accent caught my attention.

I spun around, looking at the demure woman before me who somehow made my stomach churn.

“I am Esmeralda Blanche, Great Demon under the Charge of her Royal Highness and Heir to the throne of Hellfire, Ranga Misho,” Esmeralda said as she introduced herself.

“You can take your demon bitch back,” Cassara snapped.

Esmeralda looked Cassara over suspiciously, “You’re called upon, aren’t you Valkyrie?” 

Reginald pushed his way in front of Cassara, “You two beat feet, take that bitch with you.  The client might be dead, but tell the cops you got his killer.”

With that Reginald picked up his fists and cracked his neck.

Esmeralda looked Reginald over briefly, “You were once a minion of a patron of Lord Mammon. How droll.”

“Yeah, well,” Reginald spit out some blood as he wiped more blood from his brow, “Had a change of heart.  Went into the protection business.  How about you?  What's your deal?”

“My *deal* is that I have arrived to clean up a mess that my dear subordinate has created,” Esmeralda quipped, “Now do please stand aside or there will be violence.”

“Yeah, well,” Reginald said as he flicked his cigarette between his meaty fingers, sending the half smoked cigarette flipping through the air and directly into Esmeralda's face, “I choose violence.” 

Reginald was clearly trying to stall for us, “Cass, come on!” I shouted.

Cassara was about to turn before I saw Esmeralda directly in front of Reginald. 

Reginald’s mouth opened like a gaping fish, and I watched blood drip down from his chest.

“A surprise choice, to be sure, but a welcomed one,” Esmeralda quipped as she placed her hand on his shoulder.  With a smooth motion she pushed him backwards.

Her other hand, which apparently she had thrust up into Reginald’s rib-cage from his belly, effortlessly tore through his body.  In her hand was Reginald’s still beating heart.

“Odd,” Esmeralda said as she turned Reginald’s heart around in her hand as if appraising an antique for its value, “He said he had a change of heart,” Esmeralda's gaze fixed on Cassara and I, “Yet this appears the same as any other mortal.”  

She dropped his heart unceremoniously on the floor, as it tumbled to the ground, it finally stopped beating.

I froze in terror.

“Now,” Esmeralda began with a vicious grin slowly crossing her porcelain face, “What to do with the two of [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/)?”
