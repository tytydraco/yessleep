I wish I never came here, to the town of Fredericksburg. The roads are like ebony in the night, and the town doesn’t operate like a town should.

Thankfully, I managed to obtain the book before the moon rose and became my world. It details dos and don’ts — what I need to do before the moon blinks and pitch blackness falls upon the town.

Heading through town has always unnerved me. Maybe it was the slender creatures wandering throughout town, vanishing into the nearest shadow. Perhaps it was despite it being dark, every building was lit up, the outlines of the building’s occupants dancing in the windows. Though today’s was my gas meter edging on empty, and the knowledge I just filled my tank yesterday. Knowing the gas station the book has told me to go use was too far, I decided to risk it with a new one.

Turning right, I made my way onto the darkness of the side streets. Darkness began to envelop me and my vehicle as the side streets of Fredericksburg lack the illumination main street has, though thankfully the gas station was fairly illuminated in the distance, a white beacon in the darkness. Strands of white string flowed away from the gas station, like hair in water, as if attempting to ensnare passing birds.

Driving up to a pump, I hopped out and quickly made my way towards the convenience store, proudly labeling itself Dripe’s Gas Station. While I wish I could pay at the pump, my debit cards are out and the town unfortunately doesn’t accept lines of credit. I am thankful about that though. I would hate to see what demonic entity would be in charge of extending credit, and how many pounds of flesh it’ll take for it to be satisfied. My mind preoccupied by the possible hellish interest a creature here would collect, I didn’t notice the spiderweb draped over the front of door, running directly through it.

I gag as I go inside, the store bell ringing loudly, gripping and wiping the sticky spiderweb on my jeans. Looking up I was immediately taken aback, the place was covered in cobwebs. On the floor, on the shelves, on the...gas station attendant? An obese human male approximately 6 ft 5 wearing a Dripes uniform, mouth agape, eyes gone, and bodily hunched over the cash register, his obsidian like tongue glinting in the gas station lights. His body was a deep blue and has a large white cast on his lower leg. “Hello there Mr” I stop to read his name tag “terry, I would like to buy some gas?” I utter, waiting to see if maybe the corpse would spring to life and start doing it’s job.

Instead I was met with silence, though the tongue slowly moved, as if responding to my request. “Just need enough to fill my tank” I say, a bit louder, hoping I could elicit a reaction from the corpse. Still silence, but the tongue moved again. That’s when I felt a bite on my neck, which I met with a slap from my hand. Pulling my hand in front of me, a squashed spider stained my hand red with it’s blood. The station erupted in sound after that, skittering, scraping, as if thousands of feet were skittering underneath the tiles below me.

Knowing that was my cue to leave, jumping the counter, I push over the Dripes attendant, his body making a loud crashing sound against the floor as if his body was filled with bricks. I began working the cash register and started approving pump 5 for 40 in gas, thankfully before this I did a summer job as a gas attendant. While the menu’s weren’t the same, the principle was still there. Approved, but maybe I can max out the pump, leave with a full tank. If only my foot wasn’t itching so much I could concentr….

Looking down I saw tens, hundreds, thousands of tiny spiders running towards my body, climbing on it and spinning their tiny webs around my legs. They never tell you how it feels to be crawling with 8 legged insects, the pricks of their sharp legs, the burning feeling of their venom injecting into your leg, the itchiness as they climb up your leg, trying to make it to your face.

Screaming I started stomping and shaking to get the spiders off of me only to see a much bigger issue, Terry was up, his mouth agape past what was normal, and 8 red eyes staring at me from deep within his body. A sickening “shlrrrkkk” rang out from Terry’s mouth, bones popping as what appeared to be an enormous spider was making it’s way out of his body. Jumping the counter, exiting the store, I sprinted back to my car, already covered with cobwebs. “fuck this” I say, jumping into the driver’s seat, turned the key, only to be met with a big ol E on the gas, and car shaking attempting to start.

I grab the car handle with a loud *click-chunk*, throwing out my door, I run over to the side, select my gas, and start pumping. 0.2 gallons, 0.4 gallons, 0.5 gallons, the meter was moving so slow. I heard a bell ringing noise, and to my horror, the spiders had already started making their way out of the store and towards me, eyes filled with hunger. My leg began to itch again, I stared down in horror, seeing the spiders that traveled with me had started spinning a cocoon around my leg. Back to the pump, 1.6 gallons, 1.8 gallons. Using one hand, I start tearing at the cocoon being built around my leg, only resulting in my hand sticking to my leg. I could see the spiders lacing my hand with new webs attempting to cocoon it with my leg. I pull once, no luck, I pull twice, no luck, I look at the gas pump, 2 gallons, 2.2 gallons, 2.3 gallons, and that gives me an idea. Grabbing the gas pump, I pour the gasoline on my leg and trapped hand, the webs loosening and melting away from the introduction of a liquid. I start spewing the gasoline on the floor, keeping the approaching spiders at bay as they shot strands of webs at me. I slammed the pump back into my car, 2.6 gallons, 2.8 gallons. That’s when I hear the sound of 8 large legs, and a loud ringing noise from the gas station.

The spider made it out, body an obsidian black, was still wearing terry’s body on the back of it’s body like a snail to it’s shell. Terry turned out to be a lot thinner than I imagined, I guessing having a 500 pound spider inside of you would make you a bit fat. It immediately starting walking towards me, perhaps looking for a new shell for it’s growing body.

Though unfortunately for it, I already had removed the gas pump and made my way back into the driver’s seat, slamming on the gas to pull out of that fucking gas station. My leg is itching, burning, and feeling like it’s swelling, tiny spiders running around the inside of my car, but I didn’t care. 3 gallons should be enough, and I’ll take these small spiders over that large one any day. I’m making it to the church in town today, no matter what.
