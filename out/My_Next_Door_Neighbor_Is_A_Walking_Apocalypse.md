Over a year ago, a new neighbor moved into the apartment next to mine. I soon found out he wasn’t normal. Since then, I haven’t tried to figure out what sort of person he was. His past and origin are a complete mystery to me. Some people may find it odd that I not only decided to remain friends with a person I knew to be an inhuman killer but to not try and find answers. If Dimitri wanted me to know anything about him, he would tell me.   

Almost every night, I would cook for us. I went over food in hand to tell him about my day while we ate. There were times that Dimitri would go missing for a week or so, refusing to elaborate on what he was doing. He was the silent, silent type who didn’t speak often. He still had a thick accent, but I found his English had improved a lot since we met.   

Despite living near a man-eating monster, my life had never been so stable. I was getting enough hours at work to put away some money. I was eating decent meals and spending time with a friend. I swore to myself that once I got settled, I would adopt a pet. However, that didn’t seem like it would happen with my neighbor around.  

A few times Dimitri would come to the grocery store nearby. On one of those trips, we came across a stray cat that wanted nothing to do with him. It took one look in his direction and spat before racing down the street. Dogs with their owners avoided him as well. He was a stoic person. His stern expression rarely changed. And yet, I could tell he very much wanted to be able to pet some animals or at least be around one without it fleeing.   

I decided to get a fish. An easy pet to take care of. I picked up a bowl and supplies on the way home from work one day. Dimitri had just been walking into the apartment building when I arrived with the fish supplies. I had wanted it to be a surprise. He noticed the bags in my hands and silently offered to carry them upstairs to help. I didn’t know if he saw me as weak or just liked to carry things for people. He glanced inside the bags and then pulled out the fish bowl. His face changed slightly as if he was disgusted over what he saw.  

“I was thinking of asking you to come along to pick out a goldfish or two.” I admitted wondering why his expression changed.   

He sorted through the bags as if on a mission.  

“No. They are too much work. This bowl is not for fish. Follow, we’ll get the right home.”  

I nodded unaware I had bought all the wrong things for the new fish. We went to a small store that specialized in just aquariums. I was in awe over the thousands of different kinds of fish and the requirements for each one. I learned a lot that day. We brought home a five-gallon tank, some plants, and a lot of other equipment Dimitri paid for.  I felt bad that he spent so much on something that had been my idea. I offered to set up the tank in his apartment. He refused saying due to his job he may not be able to care for the future fish every day.  

I didn’t press and ask him what kind of work he did nowadays. I hadn’t seen any new blood stains in his apartment or saw him with anyone with him. I assumed if he was still killing people, he decided to not take work home.   

It took two weeks before he was comfortable enough to get a betta fish for the tank. We needed to wait for the water to cycle and stabilize as well as the plants to take root. I was impressed with the small tank we put so much work into. There were a lot of choices of the different colors of fish. I must have stood in front of the wall of small tanks for nearly an hour trying to decide. Finally, I picked out a somewhat plain red one that had been tucked into the very bottom corner of the row. Sure, he wasn’t as fancy as the others.  He had looked a bit lonely and we have a good home ready for him.  

“What should we name him?” I asked Dimitri after we got the small fish home and adjusted to the tank.  

He darted around excited to be in a new place with lots to see.  

“Fsh.” Dimitri said with a straight face.  

I thought I heard him wrong and raised an eyebrow.  

“Without the I. Like the joke.” He explained.  

I wasn’t expecting that from him. I laughed and saw a rare smile from my friend. He bent over, his grey eyes following our new pet’s movements. Fsh didn’t seem to care he was there which was nice.  

“You seem to know a lot about fish care. Have you had some before?” I asked him.  

I rarely asked anything about his interests feeling as if everything about him was off-limits. To my surprise, he answered.  

“No. Someone I knew enjoyed them. We could relate to being in a small place, always watched.”  

A chill ran through my stomach. He had never talked about where he had been before he moved here. I knew he wasn’t human, but I never would have figured out what kind of life he lived. Who else knew about him? Had he ever been caught before? The regular police couldn’t handle whatever he was. Did that mean he had been held by some sort of organization against his will? Or did he still work for one taking care of troublesome people before they caused problems? His words led to a thousand more questions.  

“Is that person still around?” I asked and then mentally kicked myself for it.  

He didn’t turn to answer. He kept his eyes on the planted tank. The sound of the water filter felt louder than normal.  

“He is gone. Only fragments left.” Dimitri spoke so softly that I barely heard him.  

“Are you...” I started and let my words trail off.  

He was looking over his shoulder his eyes so intense it threw me off for a second. I had a feeling that if I asked him about himself at that moment, he would answer. Was I ready for that? There would be no going back after I heard that information. In the end, I was too much of a coward.  

“Are you hungry? I can make something.” I finally offered regretting that I took the easy road out of the conversation.  

He nodded and stayed to help make dinner that night.  

I had been telling my co-workers a little bit about my next-door neighbor. The next day I mentioned the new fish, explaining how much Dimitri helped get the tank ready. One of the girls commented on how he sounded like boyfriend material and soon the day devolved into them all pressuring me to just start dating my strange neighbor.  

After that long horrible day at work, I arrived home to find out Dimitri was out for the day and I was on my own for dinner. I didn’t mind that. Sometimes it was nice to have take out.  

I couldn’t sleep that night. I kept thinking over the past few months. Had it already been over a year? How many meals had we shared? I felt my face starting to get hot as the questions came to mind. What kind of relationship did I actually have with Dimitri? For the first time in my life, I wanted to scream from embarrassment. I had been trying to avoid thinking about this for so long. Sure, for the first six months, I had been oblivious to the idea that I liked him in any way other than a friend. We were both guys and he didn’t give me any kind of impression he had any interest in me.  

I didn’t want to sleep with him, I was certain about that. Then again, I couldn’t think of a lot of girls I had wanted to sleep with over the years. Yes, I had a girlfriend in high school and we had done the deed. I just never had too much interest in that sort of thing afterward. Was there something wrong with me? Did I just not feel attraction the same way others did? I went in circles for hours that night trying to figure it out and getting nowhere. I firmly decided that even if whatever I felt towards my neighbor was little bit of a romantic interest, I didn’t want to cross that line. I knew if I ever talked to him about this, he would pull away and I would lose my only real friend.  

The next day was rough from not getting a lot of sleep that night. My co-workers kept on teasing me but I wasn’t too upset over it. At least someone was having fun. I was so tired I didn’t notice a dark car following me on the way home that day. It turned away when I pulled into the apartment parking lot so I assumed it was nothing.  

Dimitri wasn’t back yet. Normally he would give me a heads-up if he was going to be gone for more than a day. I sent him a text but didn’t call him. I wasn’t his partner. He didn’t need to make me aware of what was going on. I was a bit worried when he didn’t reply that night. That went on for two more days. He was missing without any answers to the few texts I sent. While glancing at the Fsh tank, I saw a black car outside. One with a small dent in the front bumper. I could have sworn it had been parked in front of my work when I left that day. And now it was in front of my apartment? Surely, I was just tired and overthinking things.   

My phone started to ring causing me to jump. I silently swore to myself glad no one saw my reaction. I smiled when I saw Dimitri’s number. I bet he could help me calm down and assure me I was just overreacting. Instead, his next statement made my body turn cold. He didn’t greet me but got right down to business.  

“You are followed. Answer the door.” His tone was even and calm which didn’t help me not freak out.  

A knock came to the door. I almost didn’t answer it. If Dimitri hadn’t called ahead I would have considered calling the police. A person was outside that I didn’t recognize. He was tall with broad shoulders. His eyes were as cold as Dimitri’s making me think they might be related in some way.  

“That is Comrade. Stay with him.” Dimitri ordered and hung up.  

My mouth was dry. I didn’t even have time to grab my wallet or anything important. The man grabbed my wrist and easily pulled my body down the hallway. I was on the shorter side but I bet he could drag anyone regardless of size.  

“I need my keys.” I protested but we were already at the stairs.  

“No time.” He spoke with a slight accent.   

Comrade almost dragged me down the stairs. My heart was racing as I tried to figure out what was going on. His eyes were always moving as if he expected to see someone jump out at us any second. We raced to his car and I was practically tossed in the backseat.  

I should have been more weary of getting kidnapped. My main worry was my neighbor and what trouble he may be in. Before I could ask anything. Comrade tossed a small ring box over his shoulder nearly taking out my eye.  

“Open it. From Dimitri. A luck charm.” He said and quickly drove off so fast I was jostled around in the back.  

It felt like I had whiplash. Why was I being dragged away? Why on Earth would Dimitri ever want to give me something in a box like that? It took me a moment to recover enough to collect the box that had fallen on the seat. Inside was a small silver feather on a delicate chain. The feather looked to be made of a thin metal and yet it felt soft. No matter how confused I felt, I put on the necklace with some issues getting the small clasp closed in the racing car.  

I caught Comrade’s eye. He almost looked upset for some reason.  

“Sorry, you are here.” He commented then kept his eyes on the road.  

“Is Dimitri in trouble?” I asked him.  

To my relief, he shook his head.  

“No one can reach him now. They are using different methods to draw him out.” The driver explained.  

I knew what that meant. Someone must have seen me with him at some point. They wanted to use me to get to him. But would that really work? Wasn’t I just his neighbor? The necklace was an odd gift and yet I refused to believe it meant much aside from a good luck charm. He did carve small dogs for me over the year. They were just fun little gifts, nothing more.  

I wasn’t able to ask anything else. Comrade suddenly jolted the car to the right but not fast enough. Sounds of grinding metal and glass exploded around us. We had been hit from behind and then on the left. My body was thrown around, hitting the door hard. My head smashed against the window cracking it. The car rolled and the pain was replaced by darkness.  

I slowly started to wake up. My body was stiff. Everything hurt but my head pounded. Sticky blood coated the side of my face matting my hair. I wanted to keep my eyes closed forever. I forced my head up because I needed to see if Comrade was alright. I saw him bloody with his head limp. Someone had tied us both to hard wooden chairs. The zip ties dug painfully into my wrists.  

I opened my mouth to call out to Comrade instead I just coughed. Each moment made my head pound harder until my vision spun for a few seconds. Someone walked in front of me and waited until I looked up.   

He wore a well-tailored suit that looked out of place in the run-down warehouse we were inside. Orange light came through the dirty windows showing I had been out for a few hours. My eyes adjusted enough for me to see at least six more men around us. They weren’t dressed as nice as their leader. I spotted a face I knew in the crowd. It had been over a year since I last saw him but I wouldn’t forget what he looked like. Dimitri had been seconds away from eating his face off when I stumbled into his apartment saving that man from a gruesome fate. Since it was the reason I found out my next-door neighbor wasn’t human, the memory had been burned into my brain. The man caught my gaze and looked away appearing guilty. He had held out for a year, and yet in the end told the people looking for Dimitri his weak spot.  

“Call him.” The man in front of me ordered.  

He held out my phone which had a new crack over the screen. I shook my head. He grabbed my hand to force my thumb over the screen to unlock the phone, I struggled in vain. He easily found Dimitri’s number. His finger hovered over the screen ready to call when Comrade woke up.   

He recovered better than I did. It took him three seconds to understand what was going on and fight past the pain. He ripped his arms free of the chair, blood flying as the bindings tore at his flesh. To my horror, his face distorted and half opened revealing a bloody skull with countless teeth underneath. His small transformation wasn’t as graceful as Dimitri’s had been. For some reason, I assumed it hurt him to show off such a monstrous face. For a moment I really thought he would be able to fight his way through the men holding us captive.  

He raced around on all fours letting out a bone-chilling cry. Two men were knocked aside, bodies crashing hard against the stone floor. The man in the suit pulled out a pistol and calmly fired. It took two bullets to take down my new friend. He fell to the ground, screaming as the small wounds poured smoke.  

“I’m shocked the silver didn’t kill you.” He commented watching Comrade twist in agony on the ground.  

One of the henchmen carefully walked over with a long wooden rod with a silver blade taped to the end. He stabbed it down hard into Comrade's back appearing to pin him to the ground. His face turned back into a human expression. He gave me a silent apology for not being strong enough to save us.  

I fought back tears. Comrade might die all because he went out of his way to try and save me.  

The man put away his weapon. He held out my phone with Dimitri’s number on the screen. A cruel expression appeared on his face.  

“Call him and we’ll let that one go. He's not what we’re after.” He explained.  

I almost fell for it.  

“No, you won’t.” I corrected him.  

He smiled knowing he was caught. In a flash, he pulled out a small blade to stab it down into the back of my hand. My body jolted in the chair and I bit down hard to hold back a scream of pain. Amused, he removed the knife letting a wave of fresh blood pour over my hand. I stopped breathing when I felt the tip of the knife be placed between my fingernail and my skin. He pressed the dial button on my phone and waited. The phone rang three times. The moment the call was answered, he skillfully pushed the knife inwards and flicked off the nail.   

I was in so much shock I only made a croaking noise of pain. The smile never left his face as he went to the next nail.  

“Richie?” Dimitri asked his voice low from the phone. 

I shut my eyes tight preparing for the next wave of pain. Another nail came off and I tried to stomp my bound feet.  

“You should come and get little Richie. Or we can bring you some pieces if you prefer.” The man suggested clearly enjoying the situation.  

“He won't...” I struggled to say through ragged breathing. “He’s just my neighbor. He doesn’t care about me.”   

The man narrowed his eyes not believing the lie. He admired I was still struggling after the third nail came off.  

“I’ll be nice and give you an hour.” The man in the suit commented.  

“Connie alive?” Dimitri asked.  

I glanced over at Comrade. He was struggling through the pain and his wounds didn’t appear as bad as before. Given enough time he may recover enough to maybe get us out of here. But these men would notice that and beat him down before that happened.   

I was sweating. The only thing that scared me more than death was someone else getting hurt because I was too weak to save myself.  

“Just get it over with! He won’t save me! We’re not even friends!” I shouted feeling hot tears in my eyes.  

Somehow those words hurt more than anything else. He paused, the knife hovering over a fourth nail debating on what to do. We were all silent for a minute that dragged on forever. Finally, Dimitri spoke again.  

“Address.” He demanded.  

I screamed at him praying my voice drowned out what the other man was saying. After he told my friend our location, he hung up the phone and kicked it clear across the large room. He put away his weapon and took a step away from me.  

“I won’t kill you until he gets here. I want to see the expression on his face when I do. Since we have time, tell me, how could you throw away your humanity for a monster like that? You didn’t react when the other one showed its real face so you already know that thing living next door isn’t human. You know once he’s done with you, he’ll devour you like the rest.”  

I shook my head trying to make the headache override the pain in my left hand. Yes, I knew Dimitri could turn on me at any moment. Having a friend until that happened felt like it had been worth it. I had been alone for so damn long I didn’t care who I was with. I didn’t care what kind of person that made me.  

The man roughly grabbed my chin to force my head upwards. I lashed out trying to bite his hand. That only got me a punch in the face as a reward.  

“You remind me so much of my little brother. So small and weak. He ate him too. Your type is his favorite meal.”  

It felt like the wind had been knocked from my lungs. Silently I had hoped Dimitri only ate the people who deserved it. But did anyone really deserve something like that?  

He was going to torment me for a bit longer. He was expecting Dimitri to arrive to try and save me. But he hadn’t been expecting him to come crashing through one of the windows so soon.   

The man hadn’t even finished turning in the direction of the broken glass raining down before Dimitri landed. His boots were on the ground for half a second as he darted forward to the first person in the room. He took down the six henchmen in six seconds. He didn’t kill them, just knocked them aside and gave each one a broken nose. He turned his attention to us ready to take care of the leader.  

The man in the suit had taken out his pistol but it wasn’t directed at the biggest threat in the room. Instead, I stared directly at it. With a wide grin, he pulled the trigger not breaking eye contact with Dimitri. I heard the gun go off, then a ringing in my ears. I was blown back, crashing so hard on the ground that the wooden chair broke underneath. I thought I heard someone yell but I wasn’t sure what they said.  

I should have been dead. In the same moment the gun went off a cold feeling came from my chest. The feather on the silver chain exploded in a burst of energy that knocked me back. Somehow it had saved me from the bullet, but the blowback nearly killed me. I got knocked out for at least a minute. I must have looked dead on the cold ground. The cut on my head I’d gotten in the car crash started to bleed a little. The warmness of the injury made my eyes open. I wanted to stay down until I recovered. Instead, a large hand grabbed the front of my shirt to get me back on my feet. I stood unsteady using a taller person for balance.  

“Comrade...?” I asked looking up at him.  

“We need to leave. This is bad.” He said, face pale staring forward.  

I followed his gaze only to be blinded for a second by a white light. I raised a hand to shield my eyes trying to get a better look at what was going on in the warehouse.  

Where I last saw Dimitri was a crackling light slowly spreading outwards. When the light touched the stone floor, it cracked and then crumbled. The pierces floated upwards dissolving into the light. Small feathers made of the same light floated out from the brightness. They burned anything they landed on. It was as if the world was being eaten away.  

I saw a man on the ground the light creeping closer. I ran to grab him trying to drag him away. Sure, these people wanted to kill me. I simply couldn’t stomach seeing someone burned away by some weird supernatural means.  

Comrade ran over and easily lifted the man off the ground and onto his shoulder. He took my wrist to drag me toward the door. A person I recognized shouted at us to hurry up. Three of the men had already gotten out. Another limped along and I went over to help him.  

“This world is done for. Get inside the doorway.”  

Dr. Fillow I had met before came over to take over helping the injured away. The open warehouse door didn’t appear to lead to the outside, but instead inside a clinic. I looked between the Doctor and the light creeping towards us. An odd wind had picked up the sound roaring inside the space.  

“What are you talking about?” I demanded shouting over the wind.  

“That light is going to consume everything. There is nothing we can do. We’re using magic to evacuate others to a different world but I don’t know how many we can save. Come on. You can’t die here.” Dr. Fillow said, his normally calm face filled with pity.  

I shook my head. This was all too much. What was he talking about? How could this be the end of the world? I thought of all my friends at work. About the regulars. About my boss. And even about little Fsh waiting at home. How could all of that just be gone?  I could accept monsters next door but not all this. 

“Is Dimitri in there?” I asked refusing to move.  

Comrade looked over his shoulder distraught. His expression was enough of an answer.  

“He’s not himself anymore.” Dr. Fillow said and gave my wrist one more pull.  

I took a step back making him let go of my arm. Somehow, I had caused all of this. How was it fair I got to live? He hated letting me go, but he didn’t stop me as I turned around to start running into that light. I heard Comrade shouting for me to come back. I half expected to die the moment I stepped into the all-consuming whiteness. Dying would have been easier than what came next.  

I didn’t have a plan. I just wanted to reach my friend. It hurt. The brightness burned at my eyes. Each step was a struggle. My body wanted to float upward and yet it felt as if I weighed ten thousand pounds. The wind sounded louder than a plane taking off. I gritted my teeth so hard I chipped one but I pressed on.  

In the light, I saw the source. Thousands of feathers made of light explode up in a flurry surrounding a standing figure. I saw him through the swarm but his eyes remained covered by them. No, above his mouth had turned into a pair of wings spouting from his face. The closer I got, the stronger the wind grew. I shouted his name only to have my voice get drowned out by other sounds.  

A stupid idea came to mind. This worked in movies and I would be dead anyway. I might as well try it. I walked into the burst of feathers, each one of them leaving red burns on my exposed skin. My body was lifted and I needed to grab hold of his shoulders to not get blown away. Touching him burned more than the feathers. If I held on for more than a few seconds, I would lose my hands. I let go long enough to place my burned hands on the side of his face. Quickly I closed the distance between the two of us. 

The heat was nothing like I’ve ever experienced. No words could properly explain the pain of my face being burned away. I had never been so scared before. Fear of death felt mild compared to the kind of fear that came to me in that light. And yet, deep down I didn’t regret my actions.  

My vision had been taken over by the light. A pair of hands grabbed a hold of my shoulders. The pain overtook the rest of my senses and I finally fell into a long deep darkness.  

I should have died. Everyone expected that. Instead, I woke up three months later in a clinic bed. My fingers curled inward. I flexed them feeling jolts of pain shooting up my arms. It took me a very long time to finally sit up looking over the bare empty room.  

There had been a pitcher of water next to my bed. I couldn’t use my hands well enough to pick it up to get a drink. Thankfully Dr.Fillow somehow knew I’d woke up. He rushed inside to look me over. Then he helped me drink at least a liter of water before he let me start asking questions.  

“What...?” I said unsure of what to even start asking.  

He sighed and pulled out a small pocket mirror but didn’t let me see it just yet.  

“I did the best I could rebuilding the burned away parts. Because I have access to magic, I can do better things than normal medical practices. But you’ll need to have repairs done over the next few years. Your hands will get better with excises however they’ll never be back at one hundred percent.” He explained and let me look in the mirror when I was ready.  

My hair had turned pure white. I had different skin tones around my mouth and in spots on my face that I assumed to be the new flesh the Doctor repaired. My hands were also a different pale skin tone. I bet the new appearance would shock most people. But I didn’t care too much about it.  

“Is Dimitri...?” I started and shook my head. “Did he stop destroying the world?”   

Dr. Follow nodded and sat down in a chair next to my bed. He pulled out a small pink cookie he unwrapped to force me to eat while he spoke.  

“Dimitri is considered a Walking Apocalypse. I don’t know much about what it really is. I’ve heard he was a creature that slept for a long time before he was found by some humans and was bound to them. There was a worldwide agreement to never use his power. But they used him to create living weapons. It was all... just a mess. I’m glad he got away. It doesn’t stop the wrong kind of people looking for him.”  

The treat tasted bitter. I had assumed he had that sort of past. And yet it still hurt hearing about it.  

“I don’t know of any way to stop his powers once they’re activated. How did you save the world?” Fillow questioned with a raised eyebrow as if he actually knew the answer.  

I kept my mouth shut. Not even ripping off any nail I had could get that information out of me. A knock came to the door. Dr. Fillow said the person could come inside. I felt my chest get tighter when Dimitri took a few steps into the room. Stress is clear on his face. I’ve never seen him so concerned.  

“Are you alright?” I asked him.   

He slowly walked over. He leaned down to be on my level, his hand reached out to his fingertips and gently brushed against the pale flesh of my cheek. I slightly jumped as a burst of fear and pain shot through my body as I struggled to keep it down. I remembered how much it hurt when I had been in that light. Fear stayed in my chest no matter how hard I tried to shake it off.  

“I’ll leave.” He said turning away.  

My hand grabbed his keeping him still. My grip wasn’t strong and it hurt like a bitch straining my injured fingers so much however I refused to let go.  

“No. I need a friend right now.” I sternly told him.  

Relief came over his face. He had been worried the entire time I was sleeping that I would never forgive him for the pain he caused. Regardless of my feelings, I wasn’t going to let him take the easy way out. We could work through the new fear I had of him.  

“Since you’re awake, I need to kick you out. We need the bed. I’ll write out your new schedule and when to come in again for a checkup. You’ll need to take it easy. It’ll be hard to use your hands properly for a while.” Dr. Fillow explained as he stood up.  

I got up, my legs screaming in pain from standing. I wasn’t standing for very long. Dimitri bent down to scoop me into his arms. I grabbed around his neck in shock thinking he might drop me.   

“I get Richie home.” He said with a small nod.  

Carefully studying his face, I realized something. There was no way in hell I was straight. It only took being held bridal style for my dense brain to get the hint. Even if we would never end up together, I liked a monster that had the power to end the world.  

“Hey, do you know what caused your powers to stop?” Dr. Follow asked Dimitri.  

I wanted to kill the doctor and gave him a glare that clearly expressed that.  

“Do not remember.” Dimitri said unaware of what was going on.  

Thank God for that. I was not ready to admit to him what I did in that light.  

I was literally carried home and forced into bed rest for the next week. I watched a lot of movies then.. After a while, I found it easier to use my hands but they were still very weak. I wondered if we would need to move soon. The wrong people had found Dimitri once, who’s to say when they would again.  

Every day is a bit of a struggle now with the new pains and adjusting to the injuries I suffered from trying to save the world. I’m not overly complaining. It's still here. Who knows for how long?  

I do have a hunch that if I admit how I feel about Dimitri there is a very, very small possibility he would accept it. I assume he snapped when he saw I had been shot. We were just friends at that point. If we were something more and something happened to me, then what? Would this relationship bring a real apocalypse and would I be able to stop it?   

There was no rush to find these answers. The future scared the hell out of me. Dimitri scared me some days as well. I kept being reminded of what was hidden underneath his human mask. And I’m scared of what kind of person I am that I’m able to care about him regardless of that.  

I’m going to suggest he move in. He’s over all the time either way. This suggestion might bring the end of the world. I’ll just take things a day at a time hoping horrors don’t happen based on my selfish actions.
