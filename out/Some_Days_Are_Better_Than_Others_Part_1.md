*October, 1936*



You ever been in a place where time just froze? That was what it was like in the holler. I didn’t mind it, mostly. The woods were deep and cool, filled with nooks and crannies of wonder, like the little crick full of sparkling darter fish and croaking frogs, the clearing that held the broken-down remains of an old farmhouse, gone now except for the thousands of daffodils that sprung up every spring, having escaped the confines of the gardens and crept up into the hills. There was the pond with the rope swing, the water shimmering in the sun and crystal clear, and the well house that was always cold, even in the heights of summer. A rutted dirt road led up to the old coal mine in Buford’s Pass, and down to the red-brick town of Lilydale, where the Cuyamoga River carried flat barges of coal towards the city.



Jesse and Clovis, they were the oldest still at home, at 17 and 19. Duffy and Coker were my oldest brothers, but they were away working for the CCC, building big parks out west. Jesse and Clovis worked with Pa down at the mill in Miskataway. It was quite a drive there on the dirt roads, so sometimes they stayed in town with Pa’s brother Lew. Ma didn’t ask what they got up to there. Pa didn’t like it when she asked questions. Wasn’t her business, as long as he brought home a paycheck. Wiley was just old enough to work. He’d got a job at the filling station in Lilydale, but insisted on staying in school, too. Then there was me, Abel. There’d been other babies in between, but Ma had a run of bad luck. Three girls who were in the churchyard, and then me and Sadie. She was born with a twisted leg. Little Abilene followed, a quiet girl who clung to Ma’s hem like a barnacle.



So Pa had been drinking. Jesse and Clovis, too. Wiley, he didn’t like to drink. He was cleaning out his hunting gear, checking his guns and making sure his bag was all nice and orderly. Deer season was coming up. A good hunt could keep us in venison for the rest of the year. Wiley’d bought a new rifle this year, spent most of the money he hadn’t given to Ma. “Meat’ll make her feel better,” he told me. “I’m gonna bag a big buck and we’ll all have steaks for dinner.”



Clovis laughed. “Boy, you know you can’t shoot. You ain’t even bagged a rabbit all year.”



Wiley frowned and tucked his ammunition in its little bag. “I ain’t tried. Been too busy working and going to school.”



Jesse just shook his head. “It’s cause you don’t like shooting, and you know it.”



“Shut the hell up!” Pa bellowed, slamming his fist on the arm of his tattered armchair, then leaning over to fuss with the radio dials. “I’m trying to hear the damn game!” Cursing and huffing, he tried to find a strong signal through all the static. Out in the mountains, it was a matter of luck and prayer if you got a signal or not. Sometimes Pa and the boys would fire up the Tin Lizzy and drive into town to listen to the games at Old Man Higgins’ bar by the old bank. Sometimes he just threw stuff around until he got winded and went to bed. Sometimes he’d give up and pull out his fiddle. And sometimes, like tonight, he found the signal and settled back to drink and curse at every play. 



We’d finally got a radio a year ago, a giant box with a tiny speaker in front. Jesse was a whiz with the wireless, and he’d saved every penny to buy the newest model. It was real modern, you didn’t even need headphones to listen to it. Ma liked turning it to swing station when Pa wasn’t home, playing music and dancing around with Abilene and Sadie.



With Pa fussing, I just took Sadie and Abilene and put them to bed. Our house had started off as an old log cabin more than a hundred years ago, just one tiny room. Then someone built another room, and someone else built another, and on and on until it turned into a ramshackle collection of different kinds of wood and stone all piled up together on spindly stilts and chunks of log. We did have a root cellar, under the hatch in the kitchen, but mostly there was nothing underneath us but pebbles and the occasional raccoon. I slept up in the attic, where the rafters were low and the flooring rough. It wasn’t so bad. Least I had my own room, and a little round window that looked out towards the road.



Have you ever heard the rules in Appalachia? “If you hear something call your name and no one is around, no you didn’t.” “If you’re in the woods, don’t whistle.” Well, some of them may be true, but most of them are bull. The real rules are more like “don’t eat too many pawpaws or you’ll get a belly-ache” and “don’t mouth off to your elders.” One that is true is that if you hear something screaming in the woods, don’t go looking. We weren’t worried about demons. We were more worried about the state asylum ten miles away, bears, bobcats and mountain lions.



So I didn’t go looking when I heard a yowling in the woods that night. It woke me up long after the house had gone silent and dark. Bright slits of moonlight shone through the gaps in the siding, where the paper had peeled off, and the wind made dust devils stir on the floor. The air smelled of wet dirt and fresh water. Must have rained. I got up and crept over to the window, peeking out as another yowling sound came out of the woods, a little closer this time.



I hoped it would go away. I didn’t want to have to go and check on the chickens.



From my window, I could just see the road, a shining ribbon in the dark woods, and on that road there was a man. There was just enough moonlight to see his shape, but not enough to see anything else. He was walking with a cane, hunched over, a sack on his back. Old Mr. Danning, looked like. Someone told me once he used to be rich, but he lost all that was left after the markets crash to gambling. Now he stayed in town until late, drinking away what little was left, moaning about his wife and kids who left him behind. Ma said he lost his car on a game of poker. I’d feel bad for him, but he was a mean old snake, throwing rocks at us if we so much as looked at his land. He hit Sadie with his cane, once, and that was when I decided he deserved all the bad things in his life. Also that old men hit the ground hard when you whacked them in the back of their knees with a stick.



Pa didn’t even cuff me for that one.



I was up at dawn to take care of the hens and check on the garden. Pa was up early too, checking on the hog fence. Said he heard them squealing last night. He’d pulled out a couple weak timbers and was working on shoring them up.



“I seen Mr. Danning walking home last night, must have been past midnight.” I said, holding the post steady so he could brace it up and wire it in place. We’d fix it proper that night.



“What were you doing up past midnight, boy?”



“Thought I heard something in the woods. I was looking to see if I saw anything.”



Pa nodded, gave the wire a pull with a grunt. “You wake me up next time. I’ll give ‘em a hello with some buckshot.”



It wasn’t until after school that I found out old Mr. Danning had disappeared. The sheriff even came by and talked to me, kept asking if I was sure it was him. Sure I was sure, he was all hunched up and cobbling along, all wobbly like he had drunk too much. I don’t think the sheriff believed me, kept talking about kids and their imaginations and dark nights.  But I wasn’t a liar. Nope. I’d tell the truth even if I got dragged for it.



I think that was how Wiley and me ended up heading towards Danning’s old house, just before sunset.



“How’d I let you talk me into this?” Wiley asked, his shotgun barrel laid over his shoulder.



“I said I would go alone,” I replied, swinging a stick at the tall weeds by the roadside.



“You’re ten,” Wiley said, like that explained everything.



I shrugged, and we walked on in silence. 



Mr. Danning’s place used to be fine. Six bedrooms, two barns, a chicken coop, a big hog pen with a brick sty, even its own garage. Wiley was telling me that it was one of the finest in the county when Ma and Pa were little, the first to have electric. Now the windows were cracked and some of the panes had fallen out. The porch sagged in the middle, and the roof had been patched by tarps for so long that fresh tarps had been laid on top of the old ones.  Something about it just felt... musty, like opening up a closet a week after putting away a blanket wet.



I shifted my grip on the bundle I was carrying. Ma had been making persimmon butter all that week (I helped), and I had grabbed the smallest jar as my excuse. Who doesn’t like persimmon butter? Mr. Danning was our oldest neighbor, it would just be mannerly to bring him over a jar. Maybe it wasn’t the best plan, but it was all I could come up with. Wiley and I carefully climbed the front steps, which bent a little too much under our weight. Taking a deep breath, I had raised my hand to knock when Wiley put his hand on my shoulder.



“You hear that?”



I cocked my ears, then shook my head. “Hear what?”



“That’s what I mean. Listen. There ain’t no sound.”



I listened, and it was true. The crickets had stopped chirping, the wind dead still. Nothing rustled in the leaves or bustled through the undergrowth. It made my nerves jangle.



“We ought to go back,” Wiley said, but I had already raised my fist up and brought it down on the peeling paint of the front door. A dull thud echoed through the halls, and the door swung open, creaking on rusty hinges. Somewhere in the house, I heard footsteps, just for a moment. Then it was still.



“Mr. Danning?” I poked my head in. The furniture in the room to my right was all covered in dust cloths. Old wooden toys were scattered around the room, dull and dirty. A heavy sledgehammer stood next to a shattered hobby horse, one split by what must have been a dozen blows. Only the head was intact, lying on its side, staring at us. Three porcelain dolls were arranged around, their faces smashed in. “Mr. Danning, it’s Abel and Wiley Eaves. Ma sent us with a gift.”



Outside, the wind sprung up again. Just like last night, it felt thick and heavy. More rain? But even though the wind was blowing, it didn’t sound right. It was like when you stuff cotton wool in your ears - muffled and muted.



“Mr. Danning?” I stepped inside, scanning the dark rooms. Dust laid on the floors, and the old grand stairs were missing a couple of steps. There were more toys in the dining room, an old school book laid out on the table. The kitchen table was set for a meal, but the food looked like it had been there for a decade. I couldn’t even tell what it was, except for the bones of a rabbit.



That was when I heard the crying.



It was coming from behind a door in the wet room right off the kitchen, a door peppered with dozens of tiny holes and secured with a heavy sliding bolt. I won’t pretend I wasn’t scared. Truth was, I was so scared I thought my heart might explode right out of my chest. I could hear Wiley breathing fast, one hand on my shoulder, gripping hard to keep from shaking.



“Hello?” I called out. The crying continued, and I crept a little closer to the door. The wind outside was picking up, and a few heavy drops of rain smacked against the dirty window glass. “Someone there?”



Wiley bent down and whispered to me. “Might could be a cat or some other critter.”



I nodded, but that just didn’t fit to me. I cautiously stretched out my hand, hesitated again, then tapped my knuckles on the old door.



The crying stopped, then a soft voice, so quiet I could barely hear it above the rain, cried, “someone there?”



It sounded like someone young, like Sadie’s age. Mr. Danning, his wife and kids had left years ago. Shouldn’t be any kids there. “Yeah. You okay?”



“Okay?” The thin, wavering voice replied.



“Uh... you need help?”



“Help.” the voice seemed to gain a little strength. “Help. I need help... the door.” I looked up at the thick bolt holding the door shut. “Please, open the door.”



I reached up to the lock, and was surprised when Wiley slapped his hand over it. “Who are you?” Wiley asked, giving me a fierce frown.



“He left us here,” the voice said, before breaking into cries again. “Please, let us out.”



“Us?” Wiley pushed me to the side, leaning down to try to peer through the larger holes. Why were there so many holes?



“He’ll be back soon!” Whoever was talking was close to the door now. It was a girl’s voice for sure. I could hear her sniffling, hear the rustling of her moving on creaking wood. Something about her voice was strange, like it was far away but close by at the same time. “He can’t find you here. It ain’t safe.”



“Mr. Danning?” I said. “Wiley, we should let her out. Ain’t right talking through a door.”



Wiley frowned at me again. “Who are you?  Who’s down there with you? You answer me that, and I’ll open the door.”



“I’m Maybelle.” The girl tapped on the door, rapping lightly. “It’s me and my mama and my sisters. They’re sleeping. They been sleeping a while..”



Bang! A great gust of wind hit the house, blowing open the front door with a resounding crash. I just about leapt out of my skin, and ran to close it.



And saw a hunched figure coming down the path, leaning heavy on his walking stick, the sack on his back bigger than it was the night before. I sprinted back to where Wiley was talking, grabbing his arm.



“He’s back!” I whispered, hissing through clenched teeth. 



“Hide!” Maybelle said, her voice hushed and strained. “Get *away* from here!”



Wasn’t no way Mr. Danning was gonna be happy finding us in his house, persimmon butter or none. The man had girls locked up in his cellar, and I couldn’t even begin to think about a decent explanation for that. There was a counter next to us that had the front covered with a gingham cloth - we pulled that aside and ducked underneath, jamming ourselves between baskets and old cans. I could just barely see the room and hall through a hole in the fabric.



Mr. Danning slammed the front door shut behind him. His steps were slow, shuffling, one foot falling heavier than the other. The air began to smell of moss and wet soil. He took off his hat and coat and shook the rain off, right onto the hall floor, before turning on the hall light.



I swallowed hard to keep from shouting. Mr. Danning was a shade of gray that didn’t look right for any living being. His skin looked like it was peeled from a candle, and both eyes were cloudy white. Even in the sickly yellow electric light, his lips and all the skin around his eyes looked blue, the veins in his crepe-skinned neck standing out dark in a way I had never seen before. He hobbled over to the table and shoved the plates aside, then slung his sack onto it with a heavy thud, and reached out for the rope that held it shut. For a long moment, he seemed to hesitate, his hand hanging an inch from the knot, before he quickly pulled it and yanked the bag open.



The smell of loam and muck spilled out, like the dank stench of a river bottom. The old man upended the bag, spilling out clods of clay, rotting leaves, chunks of mud, mushrooms, stones and small bones. Dropping to his knees, he scooped up the litter and began searching through it frantically. At first, he panted, then got louder and cried in distress, and then screamed, filling the rooms with the desperate yowling sounds I had heard the night before. 



“Where is it? Where is it?” He cried, between howls. “Damn you, you promised me!”



Beside us, fists began pounding on the locked door, shrieks of anger and despair echoing from many voices. The doors blew open and the windows flew up, billowing rains blasting in from the dark void outside. The whole building shuddered and groaned, shivering like a fever. Wiley snatched my hand and dragged me out, not even letting me find my feet before hauling me at a dead sprint through the sheeting rain in the black woods. I couldn’t see a thing, but Wiley’s grip was like a vise, and we didn’t stop running until we made it home.



Pa called the sheriff that night. They said there wasn’t a soul at the old place. They found the pile of dirt and grunge but only our footsteps. That, and the shotgun holes in the walls. But down in the cellar, they found something else.



Old bones, buried in a shallow grave in the cold room. One woman and three children. Lula, Maybelle, Lurlene and Doris - Old man Danning’s wife and children, who left so long ago. I didn’t know what was meant to be in that sack, what he searched for so desperately. I do know this - if I hear yowling out in the woods, I’m staying inside.



Because it wouldn’t be the last strange thing I would come to know in those woods.

  
And it wouldn't be the last time I'd meet up with the Dannings.
