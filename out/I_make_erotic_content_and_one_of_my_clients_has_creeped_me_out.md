I have an interest in kinks. Full blown sexual fetishes are fun, and I'm interested in them, but I'm more interested in not-inherently-sexual kinks that don't involve sexual body parts. As fun as they are, I also consider the psychology behind them. Kinks are born out of us being bothered by certain things to any extent. Whether those things bothered us in the past or now doesn't matter, although the stuff that bothers you as a kid usually becomes your biggest kinks. You were eight and your sister took your snack cake, dropped it onto the floor, then crushed it. You probably have a food crush kink now. When you were 10, somebody told you they knew someone who stole money in some context, now you have a money theft kink (which is safer to fantasize about or act out with props.) You were always bothered by the idea of girls destroying their ex boyfriend's stuff. Now you have a kink for girls being dominant and taking revenge. Kinks are a way for the brain to cope with the things you're bothered by, and when anything serious becomes a kink, that's something I like to help out with.


I had a client with a rather interesting kink. No, I don't judge or shame. All I'm saying is, this kink was not only a rare one I had never heard of, but one I couldn't understand the existence of. I could understand kinks along the lines of the destruction of personal stuff as a form of dominance (props were used, rather than actual stuff owned by the client,) specific kinks like suit soaking on a Friday, and stuff like intense back scratching… but this one had me stumped… and it was very minimalistic, so I shouldn't have been as confused as I was.


This began when the client emailed me with a custom video request. This is what the request read:


“I would like a video of you standing in a grey void. It doesn't need to be longer than 10 minutes, and don't explicitly say anywhere how you filmed it.”


At first, I assumed this was inspired by a movie he had watched before. I even asked him, but he told me no. I asked if it was maybe inspired by something that was said to him. Maybe a creative girl told him she wished she could scare him that way. He told me it wasn't, then he told me he couldn't explain the inspiration. Curiosity aside, I was ready to fulfill this one.


Going through with the request, I went into my studio, then set up the camera and green screen. I set the green screen to a grey background resembling a vast grey void of nothingness, then stood still for as long as I could. To pass the time, I counted the amount of time the video was being filmed. Once I got to seven minutes and three seconds, I decided that was enough. I walked over to the camera, then stopped recording. It turned out the recording was actually six minutes and forty five seconds, but I wasn't far off. I made edits to the video, which included cutting any point at which I moved, then called it a night.


I woke to the sound of two or more people arguing outside my bedroom. Confused and half-asleep, I looked at the door. I couldn't make out a single word they were saying, just that it was two or three male voices. I was about to move when the voices went silent. My room got darker than it already was. Colder too. I shivered. At first, I was convinced I was dreaming.


A grey figure materialized where my door should be. I couldn't make out any of its facial features, but I felt it staring at me with malicious intent. Dread filled my gut. The thing started walking towards me. I hopped off my bed, attempting to avoid it at all costs. I felt around for the window, but, somehow, all I felt was a cold brick wall. I was gripped by my shoulders and turned around. The thing's face was nearly touching my nose. This was too weird. I wanted to be dreaming, but I could tell when I was awake. I was frozen. “Wh-what do you want?”


The thing just stared at me. Eventually, it vanished. The air started heating up again. I took me a while to get back to sleep, but I managed to drift away at some point. The next morning, I found a note on my desk. Here's what it read:


“Please fulfill the request made by [I'm not revealing my client's name] you agreed to fulfill.”


Who gave me this? Why would they give it to me in the first place? I was going to send the video over to him after double checking things. I decided I must have written it as a reminder to myself, then forgot I was responsible for it. That's all I could think of at the time. Anyway, I did some double checking to make sure my client's video was ready, then I sent it to him. Within a few hours, he messaged me back.


“Thank you so much! I'm so happy you could do this for me! I've never been able to find any videos of this fetish, so this is great!”


Me: “You're welcome! If you want, I can write you a short story about a kink of yours too.”


Him: “Sure! I think something like a faux report about girls vandalizing my car would be good. When I know for sure what I want, I'll send it to you! In the meantime, can I open up about something? You're the first girl I've requested something from with payment, so I want to get something off my chest.”


Me: “Sure, what's up?”


Him: “I had a very perverted past. I used to get so angsty about my fetish being rare, I went to ASMR videos with little to know views to ask for a video of what I wanted. The way I acted, I pretty much thought I was an undercover spy. I complimented their videos, then told them to do what I wanted in as much detail as I could. What to do and how not to do it. I would comment on multiple videos at a time in case my requested video wouldn't be made, or worst of all, my request was done the wrong way. Unfortunately, nobody would ever do it the right way. Nobody could follow instructions.


At some point, I found a Reddit post about a thing called ‘fetish mining.’ The post itself, along with all the comments, talked about the common things fetish miners do… give compliments, write a paragraph, tell the creator what not to do… and my jaw dropped. I found an image of a public YouTube comment history, which also made my jaw drop. I had no idea one could see your recent comments… people would be able to spot a pattern!”


I squinted in disgust. How would you even have the guts to admit to something like that? Obviously, you're going to be caught if you're going into detail. His email ended with this:


“I stopped doing that stuff when I found out it was wrong. I'm changed now and I'm grateful for that.”


I had a hard time processing that. He had to realize it was wrong to involve people in his fetish without consent? He thought it was okay? I asked him about it. He told me his idea was to make sure no one knew he was pushing his fetish onto them, because if no one knew, they wouldn't feel awkward. Right… because tricking someone into doing something lewd without their consent is okay, even though it's not. It's predatory, actually! It's something pedophiles probably do with children… when I told him how predatory it was, he told me he understood. He then requested another video, but I declined on the grounds of being disgusted. I'm sure others could forgive him for changing, but I was too disgusted.


I declined every one of his requests. A recurring one was bug crushing, which is literally illegal. He also repeatedly asked me to roast images of his appearance in his Instagram dms, send him messages pretending I'm an angry girl and detail all my acts of revenge, and write a short story about the grey void. I'd happily fulfill these requests, aside from the bug crush one, had he not grossed me out. Roasting and rping are great ideas!


At one point, I got fed up with his requests. I grabbed my camera and went to a secluded area. I filmed myself walking, wearing lingerie and heeled boots, holding a can of cockroaches. In an empty area, I spilled the roaches onto the pavement. Then, I held my foot above one of the roaches for a couple seconds before placing it back down by the roach. I smirked at the camera, hoping he'd be frustrated. Hoping he'd scream at his screen. There are videos by other models he could watch, so why pester me? I did it again with another roach, then again with another. After having done it five times, that's when I decided I had done enough. I posted the video to my Instagram, then blocked his email. I knew he'd leave some comments, and that's what I wanted him to do. I wanted him to show to the internet how demanding and gross he is. These are his comments:


“Just fucking crush them.”


“This can't be the only video of you doing this, if you didn't crush them.”


“Please make a video of you crushing bugs.”


That third one was a comment he'd leave under my next two posts as well, both of which had nothing to do with kinks. The first one was about plants, the second was about dogs. I was expecting more on my follow-up posts, but I didn't get any. He'd given up after two posts, which was surprising, but welcome.


I thought it was over, but over the next three nights, I kept seeing the grey figure. The first night, I was entering my bathroom when I saw it sitting on the toilet for a split second. I jumped out of my body at it. The second night, I woke up to see it standing beside my bed. It vanished seconds later, but chills were running down my spine. On the third night, I got hungry and went into my kitchen for a snack. When I switched the light on, the grey figure was standing in the center of the room, holding a USB in its right hand. It put the USB on the counter, then vanished. I don't remember owning a USB, and I wasn't sure a non-physical entity could carry one like a human could. My brow was raised, then a bone-chilling baritone voice spoke to me.


“Fulfill the requests by [client's name] before the filmed events happen.”


I didn't think I was dreaming, and I was only seeing this stuff at night. It had to be that I wasn't getting enough sleep, right? Well, I went into my kitchen the next morning to find the USB was still sitting on the counter. I took a picture of it and sent it to people, to make sure I wasn't delusional. Nobody had put it there nor visited me that night. Out of pure curiosity, I plugged it into my PC. A bunch of video files popped up. I had no idea what to expect, but what I saw was gut-wrenching.


People being dragged through a forest by abnormal monstrosities, cages full of girls who looked to be in their late teens/twenties with cuts all over their faces, my home burning to the ground in the middle of the night. The most disturbing thing was that after some analysis, I found these videos weren't AI generated. What the hell was all of this? I sent the videos to the police, hoping they can get to the bottom of whatever this is.


And just 10 minutes ago, I got mail from the entitled client. Here's what it read:


“Back when I was an entitled creep ((you're still one, you gross client,)) I made a deal with someone who promised I'd have all my kinks fulfilled no matter what. I hope they don't end up harming you. They need to stop harming people. I'm sorry. If they meet you, you'll probably believe you're delusional. You aren't.”


Well, this is something… isn't it? At least most of my clients aren't like this. Well, most of them aren't entitled. 99.99% of them have never pulled a stunt like this out of entitlement... or for any reason at all before. There is no way this is common.
