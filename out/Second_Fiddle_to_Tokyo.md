“Now, they’re not doing job interviews at the career fair,” said the girl volunteering at my school’s career center. “But talking with the right people and filling out applications always leads to an interview.” 

She sat up straight and folded her hands neatly on the table between us. I mimicked her. She nodded approvingly. “Good! And never cross your legs at the knees. It looks unprofessional.” I leaned around the table to see that she had crossed her legs delicately at the ankles. I did the same.

“Perfect!” she said, smiling. “Always smile and be sure to ask lots of questions. That way, they’ll know you’re interested in their company. No one will talk to you if they think you aren’t interested.”

I nodded. “How did my résumé look?”

“It’s good.” She slid it across the table. She had underlined the name of our college at the top of the page. “But Ithaca College should be in bold font. You want people to see it right away.”

She glanced over at the clock. “The career fair starts in an hour,” she said. “You’ll have time to fix that font and put on a nice pair of slacks and a blouse.”

I nodded. “Is there anything else I can do for my résumé?” I asked.

She tapped the words “Ithaca College” at the top of the page. “Just make sure this is in bold,” she reiterated. “You want people to know that you’re proud of your alma mater.” 

“Right.” I took my résumé and headed back to my dorm. I had borrowed an iron from a neighbor the day before and my outfit - slacks, blouse, blazer, and uncomfortable black pumps - was hanging up neatly in my closet. I had taken the bus to the mall and gotten myself a couple of snazzy interview/career fair outfits from a department store that was going out of business. In spite of the sale, the clothes had been pricier than I was really comfortable with, but I figured I’d earn it all back once I got a job. The career fair was the first step.

\~x\~

I waited for my boyfriend, Ian, outside the career fair, but only for fifteen minutes. I tried calling his cell phone, but as usual, it went straight to voicemail. The career fair was set up in one of the larger lecture halls on campus; it wouldn’t be hard for Ian and I to find each other.

The first booth I approached had a large Japanese flag on its banner. “The experience of a lifetime! Discover Japan teaching English with CommuniCo!” the banner read in large red letters. The man behind the booth was leaning against the table, focused on a crossword puzzle. I gave a small wave and smiled as I approached.

“Hi!” My voice was high and chirpy, matching my enthusiastic smile. “Tell me about CommuniCo.”

The man didn’t bother looking up. “We’re hiring people to teach English in Japan,” he said.

I paused, waiting for him to say more. The girl at the career center had said that it was important to ask questions; it would let prospective employers know that I was interested. She had also said that smiling would let them know I was friendly and approachable. I kept smiling. “That’s so fascinating,” I said, “do I need to know any Japanese in order to apply?”

The man rolled his eyes. “No,” he said, “why would you?”

Well, I felt like saying, it would probably help to know the native language before I move there. I bit back the urge to be sarcastic. There were plenty of other booths at the career fair. There was no need for me to be rude just because this one was a dud. Too bad, I thought, teaching English in Japan could probably be interesting, but this guy clearly doesn’t care about finding potential employees here. Maybe there weren’t any open positions at CommuniCo; maybe it was his way of preventing people from applying and then being disappointed. 

“Well, thanks anyway.” I turned and left. There were other booths to investigate, after all. They couldn’t all be duds.

\~x\~

I met up with Ian after my third lap around the room. The career fair was much smaller than I had anticipated, and the booths weren’t much better than CommuniCo’s. Most of the companies were local to Ithaca and were only offering unpaid internships. I didn’t plan on sticking around after graduating; I didn’t have anywhere to live, and the local newspaper wasn’t about to provide room and board or pay enough for an apartment. At least it had been mildly amusing to see the Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses next to each other, competing for new converts willing to do charity work in third world countries.

“Have you checked out that Japan booth?” asked Ian, “it seems so cool!”

I arched an eyebrow. “The guy was super rude to me,” I said. “I didn’t really stick around.”

“Really?” Ian glanced over his shoulder at the CommuniCo booth, where the man behind it was still bent over his crossword puzzle. “He seemed really nice.” Ian pulled a pile of pamphlets out of his messenger bag. “He gave me a whole bunch of stuff and we talked about Japan. He’s been teaching over there for five years! He’s only stateside for a big conference and got stuck doing this.”

I shrugged, mildly disappointed that the man at the CommuniCo booth hadn’t seemed interested in me. He hadn’t even offered me a pamphlet. “Do you wanna grab lunch?” I asked Ian.

“Sure. It’s too bad they don’t have sushi on campus.”

“The best we can do is takeout Chinese food,” I said, “and I’m a little broke right now. How about sandwiches?”

Ian shrugged. “Sounds good.”

\~x\~

“Guess who got a job with CommuniCo?” Ian’s grin lit up his entire face. 

“You got a job? Ian, that’s fantastic!” I hugged him. “Tell me everything!”

“I’m going to Japan for two years.”

It felt like everything around me had suddenly stopped, like I had been plunged headfirst into icy water and was being held down. Was I hearing this right? Ian was going to move halfway around the world and stay there for two whole years? 

He frowned at me. “You know, you could be a little more excited for me,” he said.

“I - I am,” I stuttered. “It’s just - it’s such a big move.”

“I know. I’m leaving in a month.”

“But what about us?”

Ian tilted his head to the side like a confused puppy. “I’m not staying forever,” he said, “I’m only going for two years. It’s so I’ll be able to learn the language. Isn’t it cool?”

“But...I mean...” It felt like my brain was on fire, like every single cell devoted to words and language was burning up. My mouth felt like it was stuffed with cotton, like I was choking on it. I couldn’t talk, couldn’t articulate, couldn’t express. Ian kissed my forehead, oblivious to my distress.

“You can come and visit me,” he said.

“I just thought that we’d get a place together after graduating,” I said.

“We will when I get home,” said Ian. He patted my shoulder. “I’m not going away forever. I’ll be home before you know it.” 

“I didn’t even know you had applied.”

Ian frowned again. “I thought I told you.”

I shook my head. “No. This is the first you’ve mentioned CommuniCo since the career fair.”

“Yeah, I told you I was thinking about applying when we were eating sandwiches.”

I struggled to remember. We had both talked about how useless that career fair had been and how it was disappointing that the Mormons and the Jehovah’s Witnesses hadn’t actually fought each other. Ian had mentioned that it would be cool to teach in Japan and live there, but had never said anything about applying to CommuniCo. He’d never said that he’d actually do it or that he even wanted to, just that it seemed like a fun idea. 

“Look, I thought I brought it up,” said Ian, “but maybe I didn’t. It was over a week ago.”

“Yeah, but, we’ve been together for over three years, and I thought we’d, you know, stay together after we graduated.”

“And we are gonna stay together. We’re not breaking up or anything,” said Ian. He pouted. “I thought you’d be happy that I managed to get a job.”

“I am!” I used my chipper voice, trying more to convince myself than to convince Ian. “I am happy, but it’s...it’s so far away and you never talked to me about it - ”

“I did,” insisted Ian. “You said I should apply and you said you’d come and visit me.”

I shook my head. “No,” I said, “you never mentioned applying to CommuniCo or anything like that - ”

“Are you calling me a liar?”

“No! Of course not!” I wanted to keep going, to tell him that he hadn’t discussed CommuniCo with me at all and that this was the first I was even hearing about his desire to go to Japan. But I also didn’t want to argue. He was so happy about the new job and I didn’t want to spoil it by arguing. Maybe he did mention it, I told myself, even though I knew he hadn’t.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m just stressed out. I didn’t find anything good at the career fair.”

I waited, wondering if he’d hand me a CommuniCo brochure and suggest applying. He only smiled and nodded. “That’s OK,” he said, putting his arm around me, “there weren’t many good options. Too bad the Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses never had that fight.”

\~x\~

“That career fair wasn’t super great,” I told the girl at the career center. She nodded in agreement.

“Yeah, they weren’t exactly on their A game,” she agreed.

“Is there an employment agency or something I can apply to?” I asked. She frowned, tilting her head in confusion. “Like, somewhere I can send my résumé, and they’ll keep it on file and then contact me if something matches it?”

“I don’t know if such a place exists,” said the girl after thinking it over. She tapped her fingers on the desk nervously. “The Ithaca paper is hiring.”

“I know, but I can’t really apply,” I said. “I don’t live here. Unless there’s a way I can work from Massachusetts or something.”

She shook her head. “No, they need someone who can come into the office.” She shrugged. “I’m sure something will come up. Just keep looking when you get back home.”

“OK. Do you know of any companies in Massachusetts that are hiring? Like, do you have a database or something? That way, I can send my résumé now and then schedule an interview for when I get back.”

The girl shook her head again. “No,” she said. “We don’t have anything like that. Sorry.”

“That’s OK,” I said, even as my heart began to sink. “I’m sure I’ll find something when I get back home.”

\~x\~

“Are you really going to be cooped up in your room all day?” My mother stood in the bedroom doorway, her hands on her hips. I looked over at the clock. It was a little after ten in the morning.

“I’m just waiting for Ian to call me,” I said. “It’s nighttime in Tokyo. He promised he’d call every night before bed.”

I hadn’t cried in front of Ian when I dropped him off at the airport. I hadn’t begged him to reconsider or stay home or take me with him. I had smiled stoically while he kissed me and assured me that two years would fly by.

“Just you wait and see,” he had said while we waited for his gate to open, “in two years, we’ll be renting an apartment together and saving up to go back to Japan for our first vacation!”

I had cried the entire way home. My mother had comforted me a little, but had reminded me that I needed to get a job before Ian and I could move in together. 

Now she was tapping her foot impatiently, her lips pursed as she looked me up and down. “You haven’t even showered!” she admonished. 

“Ian might call,” I said. “I don’t want to miss him.”

“What time is it in Tokyo anyway?” asked my mother. 

“Around eleven at night,” I said.

“He’s probably gone to bed.”

I sighed. “He promised he would call.”

“He probably went out with friends after a long day of work,” said my mother, emphasizing the word ‘work.’ “That’s what people do when they’re employed. They go out afterwards. They don’t sit around on the computer for hours and hours.”

I looked down at the screen. The Skype logo filled my computer screen. No missed calls. No calls at all. In the month that Ian had been gone, he’d only called me twice. “Look, I’m still getting settled in,” he had told me a few days ago, “my apartment doesn’t have internet yet.” 

My mother huffed. “You’d be more productive if you showered, got dressed, and got out of this room,” she said. “Maybe you can take the bus into town and ask for job applications.”

She had a point. I wasn’t accomplishing anything by sitting around and waiting for Ian to call. So I showered, got dressed, and printed out a dozen copies of my résumé to hand out. Maybe someone would be impressed by my initiative. Or maybe there was a job opening that I didn’t know about. It couldn’t hurt to try. I was eating breakfast when my mother came into the kitchen.

“I’m going into town,” I told her, smiling. “I’ve got a stack of résumés here, and I’m not coming home until I’ve passed them all out!”

She looked at me and frowned. “Is that what you’re wearing?”

I looked down at my clothes. I was wearing jeans and sneakers with a nice sweater. It would all be pretty much hidden under a coat anyway. “I’m going to be walking around all day,” I said, “I want to be comfortable.”

My mother rolled her eyes. “No one is going to hire you if you walk in there looking like a homeless person. Don’t you have any nice clothes?”

I changed into my slacks, blazer, and pumps. 

\~x\~

“Can I help you?” the receptionist looked up at me over the top of her trashy romance novel.

“Yes.” I beamed and offered her my résumé. “My name is Kylie Upton, and I’m looking for a job.”

The receptionist blinked. She stared at my résumé, but didn’t take it. “Who do you have an interview with?”

“Oh, I don’t have an interview,” I explained. I tapped the corner of my résumé. “I just wanted to drop my résumé off, in case you had any openings.”

The receptionist frowned. “This isn’t how we hire people,” she said.

I wasn’t sure what to do. I had expected her to thank me and take my résumé, probably place it in a folder to give to someone more important later. I clenched my teeth, struggling to maintain my smile. “I know it’s unusual, but I just thought - ”

Relief flooded through me when the receptionist finally took my résumé. “This is not how anyone does their hiring,” she said. “This is highly unprofessional and you will never get a job doing this.” I felt the smile finally slip away as she tossed my résumé into the trash can by her desk.

“I - I didn’t - I was told - ”

“This may be how your grandpa got his first job down at the steel mill after the war, but times have changed,” said the receptionist. “If you want a job, go online and apply like everyone else.”

Embarrassment shot through me as I turned and left. Why had my mother suggested this? Had she known that this would happen? Had she set me up to fail on purpose? Was this some kind of demented joke or a lame attempt at a life lesson? Ever since I’d come home, she’d been grumbling about how I didn’t have a job yet, implying that she had wasted money on my education because I wasn’t immediately employed. She’d been stomping around the house, glowering and tut-tutting every time she saw me waiting for a call from Ian. She’d been making passive-aggressive comments about my clothes and my weight since high school, and now that I was living at home again, she’d added my joblessness to her list. 

I walked back to the bus stop, trying not to cry. My feet ached. Thunder rumbled overhead as raindrops began to pitter-patter around me. I ducked under the awning, grateful that at least the bus stop had a shelter. I tried to stop replaying the whole embarrassing event in my mind. It wouldn’t be a funny story to tell Ian about later, I thought, it was a humiliation that I’d never live down, even if I never told anyone.

And would it have killed the receptionist to be a little nicer? Clearly I was way out of my depth on this one and she was acting like I’d stormed in and taken a shit on the carpet. And I had put in actual effort; she didn’t have to be impressed, but at least she had to know that I genuinely wanted a job if I was willing to show up and hand over my résumé in person. Did she really have to be so mean? She was probably telling everyone in the office about it, laughing behind my back as she recounted what an utter idiot I was.

The rain was coming down in full force when the bus finally arrived. I got on, thinking about the other résumés in my bag. Obviously, I couldn’t hand them out. I’d only be ridiculed if I did that. What if the receptionist was calling up other companies and telling them about me? Would she do that? Would she sabotage my job hunt like that just because I’d broken some unknown rule about office etiquette? 

“You’re home so early. Is something wrong?” My mother was standing in the kitchen, as if she had been waiting for me to come home so she could call me a failure for not returning with a full-time job.

I set my bag down on the counter and reached for a dish towel to dry my hair. “I’m not supposed to just go into offices and hand them my résumé,” I said.

My mother frowned. “What do you mean?”

I told her what had happened. Her frown deepened. “So, just because one secretary tells you not to hand her a résumé, you give up and come home? Is that what you’re saying? You just gave up?”

“Mom, this isn’t how people get jobs anymore,” I said. “I’m supposed to apply online like everyone else.”

My mother rolled her eyes. “Which is why showing up in person makes you stand out.”

“But Mom, that’s not what companies want!”

“How would you know?”

“Because that’s what the receptionist told me!” 

My mother signed. “If you’re this easily discouraged, then it’s no wonder you can’t get a job!” She glared at me, “sending you to college was such a waste of money.” 

\~x\~

“Are you still in your pajamas?! It’s eleven A.M.!”

My mother was standing in my bedroom doorway, droplets of rain rolling off of her raincoat and pooling on the floor by her feet. I looked back at the clock. It was just after eleven. I had been so preoccupied with waiting for Ian to call, I hadn’t moved since I’d turned on my computer. 

“I was waiting for Ian,” I explained.

My mother rolled her eyes. “Well, he obviously isn’t going to call you, is he? Unlike you, he’s busy at work.”

“It’s...” my heart sank as I counted on my fingers. “It’s midnight in Tokyo, Mom. Ian’s probably asleep.”

I hadn’t realized it was so late in Tokyo until I calculated the time. I’d been waiting since I’d gotten up at seven - had I really been sitting at my desk in my pajamas for four hours? I checked Skype one last time to be sure Ian hadn’t tried to call. Nothing.

“Well, I guess you can get off your ass and do something productive instead of moping around.” My mother stomped off and I heard her bedroom door slam. 

I got up and showered, wondering what had kept Ian. He’d been in Japan for three months and we’d only spoken four times. When he wasn’t telling me all about his adventures, he complained about the lack of internet connection in his apartment and how hard it was to find an internet cafe. Maybe he had gone out with his friends and lost track of time. Or maybe he realized that it was late but decided to skip the phone call because he needed his sleep for work. Or maybe he was having too much fun without me. I waved the thought away. He misses me, I told myself, he has to miss me.

\~x\~

The newspaper landed in my lap with a wet thump. Beads of water clinging to the plastic bag soaked into my pants as I stared dumbly down at the bag. Beside me, my mother folded her arms across her chest and cleared her throat.

“You know, I’ve never been unemployed, but I still read the Want Ads every single day,” she said. 

“Oh.” I fumbled with the slick plastic bag before tearing it open with my nails to get at the newspaper inside. The edges were soaked, the newsprint spongy and squishy beneath my fingertips. I tried to ignore the words “IS THE NEXT GREAT DEPRESSION HAPPENING?” written in gigantic type across the front page. There isn’t a depression, I told myself, there can’t be. There has to be a job out there for me.

I laid the paper out on the table in front of me and began rifling through the sections, searching for the Want Ads. My mother was tapping her foot impatiently, like she was waiting for me to open a gift and thank her for it.

“Did you even go to the career center?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said. “I told you.”

She pursed her lips and shook her head. “If you’d gone like you said you did, they would’ve given you a job. That’s what they’re supposed to do.”

“Well, they didn’t.”

She rolled her eyes. “I don’t know why I wasted all that money on your college tuition if you didn’t even bother visiting their career center.”

“But Mom, I did!” I felt hot tears stinging at my eyes and blinked them back. “Why won’t you believe me?”

“When I was in college, the career center helped get me my very first job,” my mother continued. “They helped me put together a résumé and they got me a job.”

I imagined my mother standing in front of the girl who’d looked over my résumé with her hands on her hips, shouting and stomping her foot until the girl conjured a job out of thin air for her. “Well, they don’t do that anymore,” I said.

My mother rolled her eyes again. “You know what I think?” she asked. “I don’t think you went to the career center. I think you took my hard-earned money and flushed it down the toilet with your worthless BA in English!”

I turned away from her, looking back down at the newspaper. If I kept arguing with her, I’d break down into tears and then she’d just keep going, berating and belittling me until I was sobbing. She had been the one to encourage me to get my degree in English in the first place, but if I pointed this out, she’d deny it and accuse me of tricking her. It would be just like in middle school, when she had badgered me because I wasn’t interested in seeing *Titanic*, telling me that all the normal popular girls were flocking to it and that everyone thought she was raising a weird little nerd because I didn’t care. Then, after I gave in and went to see it, she found out that Kate Winslet had appeared topless and accused me of tricking her into letting me watch a dirty movie. I could never win with her, so my best strategy was to just try and ignore her while she stood over me, squawking and calling me a liar. 	I finally found the Want Ads and bent closer to the paper, partly to get away from her incessant nagging and partly to make it look like I was actually interested in them. Maybe I would find a job and she’d finally stop shrieking about how worthless I was. My heart sank as I ran my finger along the smudgy black type. All the jobs advertised in the Want Ads were for construction companies. They were looking for forklift operators, welders, and bricklayers, not English majors. There weren’t even any secretarial positions advertised, just manual labor that I was woefully unqualified for.

“Have you even been listening to me?” my mother demanded. “When I was your age, your grandfather handed me a bill and told me that if I wanted to live in his house, I needed to pull my weight. And I did so without complaint and without tears!” My vision blurred as I bit my lip, struggling not to break down and cry. 

\~x\~

What’s the point in any of this? I wondered. I wasn’t sure how long I’d been standing in front of the medicine cabinet. I had zoned out while staring at my mother’s neatly organized collection of painkillers. Excedrin. Tylenol. Advil. Motrin. Midol. The bottles were solid white. I wondered what the pills looked like, how they would feel gliding down my throat and settling in my stomach. I shook the thought off. Just because things were a little hard now didn’t mean they’d stay that way forever, I told myself. There’s a job out there somewhere. Ian will come home. Or at least remember to call. 

“What are you doing?” my mother’s voice jolted me out of my thoughts. I grabbed the Tylenol without thinking.

“I have a headache,” I lied as I opened it and shook two pills into the palm of my hand. They were red and blue. I wondered briefly what they would look like dissolving in my stomach. Would the colors bleed together and turn purple? I popped the two pills into my mouth and placed the bottle back on the shelf.

\~x\~

I glanced at the clock. It was nearly ten a.m. I started counting on my fingers, trying to figure out what time it was in Tokyo. It was probably too late for Ian to call me. I sighed heavily, wishing that I had a better way to call him. It was almost eleven at night in Tokyo. Where was Ian? It wasn’t like him to stay out late. He was probably sleeping. I groaned with frustration; he’d gone to bed without calling me again. There has got to be a better way to reach him, I thought. He’d been in Japan for six months by now. Surely he’d have gotten his internet sorted out. Or at least found a reliable internet cafe.

I wondered if he was ignoring me on purpose, if he was biding his time and waiting for me to dump him out of frustration. I pushed the thought away. He would never want me to dump him. And, of course, he’d never dump me. He loved me. He was just busy. He was out with friends. His guy friends, I told myself. There was no way he’d ever cheat. If he had wanted to see other women, he would’ve broken things off before he went to Japan. 

I was about to close the laptop and take a shower when the Skype ringtone filled my headset. I grinned, clicking the icon harder than I really needed to in my excitement. Ian hadn’t forgotten! I brushed my hair out of my face, smiling as the call connected and Ian’s face filled the screen.

“Hey, babe!” he called, practically shouting. “Sorry I’m calling so late.”

“It’s OK,” I said. “It’s not late here.” I noticed a group of people pass behind Ian. They were holding styrofoam coffee cups and talking animatedly. “Where are you?”

Ian gestured broadly, as if I could see where he was. “This is an authentic Tokyo Internet Cafe!” He waved at someone off-screen. “Guys, come and meet Kylie!”

A man leaned in and waved at me before lifting his head to call to someone standing behind the computer.

“See! I told you she was real!” The man had a British accent, and he pointed at me as he addressed someone who wasn’t in the frame. “Pay up! You owe me!”

Ian rolled his eyes. “Knock it off, guys.” He smiled sheepishly at me. “How’ve you been? How’s the job hunt going?”

“Come on!” someone with an Australian accent called from off-screen. “This is boring! Let’s hit the karaoke bar!”

“Did your friend think I wasn’t real?” I asked. The words sounded stupid as soon as they’d left my mouth. My voice sounded high-pitched and whiny, and I forced a smile. I didn’t want Ian thinking that I was being babyish. Chances are his friends were just playing around, being silly. If I got offended by it, I’d look like a total nag. 

Ian laughed. “He thought I was doing the whole ‘I have a hot girlfriend who lives in Canada’ thing.”

“Kylie, I never doubted you were real.” The man with the British accent leaned into the frame again. I smiled, wishing that I wasn’t in my bathrobe. At least they couldn’t see my fluffy bunny slippers. 

“OK, fine, you win! She’s real!” the Australian called from off-screen again. “And I will buy the first round of drinks, but we need to get to the karaoke bar first!”

“Sorry,” said Ian. He glanced up, clearly addressing the Australian. “Dude, just give me a minute to say hi to my girlfriend.”

“You can talk to Hachiko later,” whined the Australian. Ian rolled his eyes in obvious confusion, but the British man’s eyes went wide, as if the Australian had insulted me. “It’s Friday night and I’m still sober!”

“What’s Hachiko?” I asked.

“Anime princess!” blurted the British man. “She’s this cute little anime princess - you look just like her.” He nudged Ian’s arm. “Come on, Jeff’s getting restless.”

“I’ll catch you later, babe!” called Ian.

“I love you!”

Ian was shouting something at the off-camera Australian as he hung up. I stared at the blank screen. I figured that I could watch the Hachiko anime show that the Australian had been talking about while I job-hunted, but when I tried to look it up, all I found were pictures of a dog statue at a Japanese train station. I sighed as I got up to take a shower. Maybe it was just too obscure for American audiences. 

\~x\~

The man sitting in front of me was about my age. He was wearing ripped jeans, a backwards baseball cap, a hoodie, and dirty converse sneakers. I crossed my legs at the ankles like the career coach had instructed, hoping that my pumps hadn’t gotten too scuffed on the walk over from the bus station. Surely this guy wouldn’t be paying too much attention to my clothes, given the state of his own wardrobe. I brushed the snarky thought away; at least this workplace was casual. If I got a job here, I could wear comfortable clothes.

“So I didn’t have time to read over your résumé,” said the man. 

He glanced at me, obviously expecting a response. I forced a smile and swallowed the urge to tell him that was unprofessional. “Well, that’s OK,” I managed to squeak out. I cleared my throat. “We could go over it together.”

He brushed the papers aside. “I’d rather hear directly from you,” he said, “what makes Kelly Upton good enough to work here?”

“Kylie,” I corrected.

“What?”

“My name is Kylie,” I said, “not Kelly.”

“Oh. Sorry.” He shrugged. “So, why do you want to work here?”

I wished I could scream at him, to tell him that I was willing to work anywhere - even with a jackass who couldn’t be bothered to read my résumé or get my name right - if it would get my mother off my back for five minutes. I clenched my fists, more to prevent myself from fidgeting than anything else, then took a deep breath. I can salvage this, I thought, and this will be a funny story to tell on my first work-anniversary. 

\~x\~

It was raining when I left the interview. I stood at the bus stop, wishing that there was a shelter or an overhang or something I could stand under. My feet ached from the too-tight shoes, and I could feel a blister forming on one of my heels. I was soaked and shivering when the bus finally came. I scrambled on, paid my fare, and took the last seat beside a heavily pregnant woman. She smiled wanly and scooted over, pulling her plump belly away from my soaked business suit as the bus rumbled along to the next stop.

“Excuse me.” I looked up to see a heavyset man wearing a tattered raincoat. He stared down at me, his eyes bleary and unfocused. “I’m disabled.”

I stared back at him, wondering what he wanted. The pregnant woman elbowed me, then nodded at the sign above our seats indicating that they were reserved for individuals who were pregnant, elderly, or disabled. I sighed and stood up. I limped away from the seats, giving the man space to sit down. He plopped down without acknowledging me. I held the strap, swaying as the bus continued to slosh through puddles.

The cold had seeped under my skin and was settling into my bones when I finally got off the bus and walked home. My body felt heavy, as if I had somehow absorbed the rain. My feet were waterlogged and sluggish, my uncomfortable black pumps completely soaked through, as I plodded up the steps, unlocked the front door, and trudged into the house. 

My mother was still at work. I was too tired to decide if I was disappointed or relieved. Maybe she would’ve comforted me over the crappy job interview. The interviewer had called me ‘Kelly’ two more times before telling me about the company’s occasional Saturday hours. He had promised to email me within two weeks. I changed into dry clothes before booting up my laptop and sending a thank-you email. 

The job sounded terrible, but I wanted it anyway. Working the occasional Saturday would at least get me away from my mother for a bit. And maybe Saturday hours meant more pay. I lay down on the couch, hoping that the soft corduroy cushions would provide some warmth.

\~x\~

“Are you sleeping?” My mother’s voice cut through the fog of sleep. I forced my eyes open and sat up. My mother rolled her eyes at me and shook her head. “The utter laziness!” she muttered just loud enough for me to hear.

“I had a job interview,” I said. 

“And? Have you followed up?”

“Yes,” I said. “I send a thank-you email - ”

“I meant with a phone call,” snapped my mother. She rubbed her temples. “You’re supposed to follow up with a phone call thanking them and telling them that you want to work for them.”

“And that’s what I said in the email,” I said. “Nobody wants phone calls anymore, Mom.”

“How would you know?” demanded my mother, “are you suddenly an expert?”

“Mom, I’ve had a really tough day,” I said, hating the whine in my voice almost as much as I hate the harshness in hers.

“You know, I saw Becky Wilson’s mother today,” said my mother, ignoring me. The name struck a familiar nerve, and I scrambled through my memories, trying to figure out exactly who Becky Wilson was and how I knew her. The incessant pattering of rain outside was distracting me, making me feel sluggish and out-of-sorts. 

“Becky’s mother says that she has two jobs,” she continued. “I, of course, had to tell her that you’re still looking for work.”

“Well, maybe I’d have a job if Becky Wilson wasn’t hogging them!” I shouted. The rain was so loud I could hardly hear myself. My mother blinked, flinching slightly. Despite the fact that I could barely conjure Becky’s face in my mind, I was filled with a sudden seething anger for her. How dare she hog all the jobs? How dare she not share? How dare she take something from me? That worthless greedy-guts, I thought.

“I - I just meant - ”

For the first time in my life, I interrupted my mother. “Can Kylie have a job? No, Becky Wilson just has to have two of them!” My mother flinched again, wiping at her face, and took a step back. I pressed forward, my hands flapping angrily as I shouted. “Does it matter that Kylie is doing her fucking best? Does it matter that she’s trying her hardest? No, Kylie’s a worthless piece of shit because Becky Wilson has two jobs!”

“Sweetheart, I never - ”

“I’ve never been unemployed, but I still read the Want Ads every day!” I mimicked. “I can’t do any of those jobs! I’m not qualified! I have a BA in English - do you honestly think I can just apply to be a construction worker?! ‘Can you work a forklift?’ ‘No, but I can write a ten-page paper about *Pride and Prejudice*.’ ‘Oh, of course you can have this job, let’s get you fitted for a hard hat.’ I’m not fucking qualified!”

My hands reached out and slapped my mother’s shoulders, shoving her back. My mother stumbled, her eyes wide, but managed to right herself. Her mouth opened in an O-shape. I wasn’t sure if she said anything. The rain was too loud. I stepped closer, forcing her back. My anger bubbled in my chest, boiling over and spreading out into the rest of my body. 

“I can’t get a job because Becky-fucking-Wilson stole them all!” I screamed, shoving her again. Becky’s face finally clicked in my brain; an image of a blonde girl in one of the school plays floated briefly before my mind’s eye before vanishing. I screamed, unable to articulate my rage. The world was suddenly hazy and red, my ears filled with the steady, relentless drone of the rain on the roof.

I was suddenly pressing down hard on one of the couch cushions. The grooved corduroy fabric dug into my hands, leaving lines on my palms. I stared down at the pillow, trying to figure out how it had gotten off the couch. I was sitting on something soft. When had I sat down? What was I sitting on? Where was my mother?

I looked down. It took me a moment to realize that I had been sitting on my mother’s stomach, straddling her with my legs and locking her arms to her sides. I didn’t bother lifting the pillow from her face. I stood up, swaying slightly, absently wondering when I had last eaten. Outside, the rain began to slacken. I wandered into the kitchen. Maybe once I had eaten and slept, I’d be able to figure out what to do.

My mother’s purse was on the kitchen table. I stared at it for a moment, then dumped its contents onto my placemat. I picked up my mother’s wallet with numb fingers and opened it. There wasn’t any cash, but her credit cards were neatly arrayed in little vinyl pockets. I closed the wallet and stuffed it into my pocket.

I can probably get a cheap flight to Japan, I thought as I picked up the car keys. The rain had eased into a drizzle, as if it somehow knew that I would need to drive to the airport. The whole Skype thing was too unreliable. I really needed to talk to Ian in person.
