I live in a condo. Very comfy and cozy but there has always been a eerie vibe to the place. In my time living here my family has experienced a few odd events but nothing major. A few spoons and plates would go missing. Maybe some clothes. We have even heard what sounds like foot steps in places we know somebody else isn’t. Happens to everyone. The house is old and settling has always been the explanation. But recently, more noticeable things have been happening. 

We have a green stool in our living room that we use to set cups and plates on when we are eating in the living room. It’s been in about the same spot for years. And a week ago, It disappeared. Without a trace. And while this is strange it’s still not hard evidence that anything is wrong. But a certain situation has stuck with me. When quarantine went on, I feel like most people had a DIY stage. My mom sure did. So we have a bunch of paint, and tools and wood in our basement from when she would make random things to keep her busy. One day, my family walked into the house after a busy day and everything seemed normal. I looked down at the stairs to my basement and realized something. Their was paint footprints going up the stairs from the basement. But not shoe prints. bare feet, you could make out the toes. 

So I mentioned it to my mom. Hoping she would have a reasonable explanation as to why they were there. But like I assumed. She had no idea where they came from and was just about as confused as I was. But after a little bit of confusion and shock we just brushed it off and she ended up wiping the paint off the stairs. Yesterday, I saw him. My mother had been at work and I was coming home from school. I knew nobody would be home so when I came into the house I didn’t announce my presence. As I took off my shoes and backpack I heard a noise unlike any I’ve ever heard. I froze to listen. there’s always random noises happening while I’m hanging out that I just ignore, as I have loud neighbors. But as I approached the couch, the sound happened again. This time I could clearly hear it. It came from my room, which is Directly above the living room. I paused the tv. It went silent. Way to silent. 

As I’m laying on the couch listening for another sound, even a squeak. I get a text. From my mom. She is working late and won’t be home till later that night. I put down my phone and unpaused my show. It’s about 7pm and my stomach is killing me. I get up and sluggishly walk to the kitchen, Opening the fridge to see it’s completely empty. Except for a microwaveable chicken and rice. My stomach was eating itself so I settled and just decided I was gunna deal with it and eat the chicken. I put the chicken in the microwave and start it. I plop back down onto the couch, hoping to pass the time so I can just eat. While I sit through a bogus flashlight commercial, I take a glance out the window. thick snowflakes fall quickly and fill the yard. While the snow is fascinating and all. The microwave goes off. I get off the couch and go to get my food. I reach to the microwave and just as my flesh touches the handle of the microwave. The power goes out. 

Luckily my phone still has enough battery to use the flashlight so I click it on. With everything in the house off It’s eerily silent. I grab my food and decide to finally go into my room and relax. As I take my first step up the stairs. I hear a pounding. louder than anything I’ve ever heard. As if it was inside my head. I turn on the lights over the stairs and start going up the stairs. As I get closer to my room. The pounding is getting louder, faster. I step to my door. Not knowing what will be behind the door, I swing it open. As I step into my room. The pounding stops. I feel the temperature drop. It felt like a meat locker. As I approach my bed I can hear something. From behind me, breathing heavily. I froze. My phone flashlight now flickering.

 I stood frozen for almost a minute, after about 30 seconds I finally muster the courage. I turn around. It becomes pitch black in my room and I now hear muffled whispering. I can’t make out what they are saying. Suddenly, after what felt like forever. Everything stops. it gets impossibly quiet. somehow through all the darkness. I could make out a figure, it was a tall. Faceless man. He leans down and whispers in my ear. “Should’ve ordered the flashlight”.
