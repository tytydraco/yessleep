This isn’t a metaphor. This isn’t poetic. This is **a warning**.

I’m writing this from a motel two towns over, and I don’t know how long I have before it finds me again. But if you ever grew up in a house that doesn’t exist anymore, if a part of your childhood feels surgically removed — maybe this will make some kind of awful sense to you.

My mom passed last week. Cancer. Quiet, painful, expected. My older brother and I met back at the old family house to settle the estate. I hadn’t been back in over a decade. The place is weirdly well-kept, like someone had been maintaining it obsessively even after she got sick.

Walking in felt like a gut-punch of nostalgia. Same brown carpet. Same crooked light fixture in the kitchen. Same scent of lemon cleaner mixed with something older… sweeter… rotting.

But then I noticed the hallway.

It was **too short**.

I remember that hallway like I remember my own name. I used to race down it in socks, sliding into the doorframe of my bedroom at the end. Mom used to hang up my drawings there. It was narrow and long and comforting.

Now? It stops early. Right before the linen closet. No bedroom. Just a solid, blank wall.

I said something to my brother — made a dumb joke like, “Did they just delete my childhood bedroom?” — and he gave me this look. Like I’d just confessed to a crime.

“What are you talking about?” he asked. “You always slept on the pull-out in the den. You never had your own room.”

I thought he was messing with me. But he was dead serious.

I laughed it off, but my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

That night, after he left, I went looking. Knocked along the wall where my door should’ve been. It sounded **hollow.** The kind of hollow that tells your bones something *used* to be there. Something **was buried**.

In the attic, I found a box of old photos. Family vacations, holidays, birthdays. And I’m in some — but never *inside* the house. Always in the yard, or the driveway, or *cropped awkwardly* into the frame. My face is often blurred, like I moved during the shot, but the blur is wrong. Too sharp. Too…deliberate. Like a smudge that’s trying to move **on its own**.

Then I found a photo of the hallway.

Four doors.

One of them has a sticky note on it. In blocky handwriting:  
**“DON’T OPEN UNLESS HE ASKS.”**

And then I remembered the door.  
The one my mom said I wasn’t allowed to lock.  
The one with no light switch inside.  
The one where I’d sometimes wake up **outside of**, curled up like I’d been sleepwalking — or moved.

I checked the blueprints the next day. The city has them on file. Three bedrooms. Always three. The hallway? Ends right where it does now. No renovations. No demolition permits. Nothing.

And yet… that night, I dreamed of the fourth room. And it wasn’t empty.

It was *watching me*.

There was something in the corner. Not a person. Not even a shape. Just a **feeling** — like a spider’s nest made of thoughts you’re not supposed to have. It whispered to me, using my mother’s voice.

I woke up on the floor in the hallway, my cheek against the carpet, right where the door used to be.

There were four shadows cast on the wall.  
I was alone.

I left the house before sunrise. Haven’t gone back. I don’t know if I was ever supposed to leave. I don’t know if I *actually* did. The motel lights flicker when I close my eyes. The air smells like lemon. And I keep waking up with carpet fibers on my skin.

If you’re reading this, check your hallway. Count the doors.  
Count them **twice**.  
And if you ever hear something scratching from the **inside** of a wall that shouldn’t be there?

**Don’t open it.**  
**That’s not where you live anymore.**
