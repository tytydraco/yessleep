I first saw it driving home from work about 2 months ago. It was late, around 10:30-11PM. It was dark, the sky full of clouds. I live outside of town, about 30 minutes from my job. 
The drive home can be unsettling, considering the few cars I’ll see. 
Deer aren’t rare, but it’s pretty uncommon to see them so close to the road. That’s what I thought I saw. Darting across the road and nearly causing me to crash. I remember pulling over and trying to catch my breath as my heart raced. 
I could see something moving in the faint red shine of my rear lights. I had stepped out and turned on my phone light. 

I should’ve stayed in my car. 
It wasn’t a deer. 

It was large and looked like its limbs were broken. I couldn’t see its head, only its backside. It almost looked like a dog and I remember feeling horrible, thinking I’d hit someone’s livestock guard. 
Its breathing was wet and raspy. 

As I stepped closer it jerked and shuddered, a sick cracking sound filling the air as its limbs twisted and moved. 

I still feel dread thinking of its face. 
Too dark to see anything but its eyes. And teeth. 
A limb with too many joints had extended to me. The sound was nauseating.

(“…..A…Aud-drey…”)

It choked the word out. 
My name. 
I ran to my car and sped off. I didn’t look in my rear view. I just finished my drive home. 

I didn’t tell my parents what I saw. 
I didn’t tell anyone. 
I tried to forget it. 
But it followed me home.

For the last month and a half it was there, with me. In my home. 
My parents didn’t see it, my brother did not see it. 
I alone was the witness to this humanoid thing. 
At first I thought I was suffering from the stress of my job and the long hours I work. 
I had mentioned strange dreams to my mother and she’d said the same.
 “You just need more rest, Audrey.” She’d scolded me.

Sleep was the last thing I needed. When I closed my eyes all I could see was its face. Changing and morphing with only its eyes and pale smile remaining constant. 
Its hands were large and its fingers long.
Its skin was cold to the touch. 
But the worst thing. Was its voice. 
It used the voices of people I know. 

My family. 
My friends. 
My coworkers.

(“Audrey, we are here Audrey.”)

Even when I was awake I could hear it calling to me. 
Whispering to me at my work desk. 
Humming to me in my car. 
Talking to me like an old friend, but much more unsettling.

(“Audrey, come to us, Audrey.”) 

I moved from my home one week ago. 
I thought a change of environment would put an end to the nightmares and paranoia.

I was wrong. 
It only got worse. 
I am not alone. 
And I don’t know what it is they want from me.
