It’s been two weeks since my van got totalled.


I’m not gonna lie, that set me back; I’d been sleeping in the rear compartment. Don’t feel sorry for me, I’m the idiot who crashed it.


After the accident, I had nowhere to sleep. Motel rates were double what I could afford, so I bought a cheap tent from BFC and hitched back to the lot where I used to park.


I ended up in a flat section of woods by the Tookie River, past the McDonald’s on Ambridge Street.


It felt private without being secluded. There were public restrooms a short walk away, a 24-hour 7-Eleven, and just enough light from the nearby car park to make me feel like I wasn’t completely alone.


Two days in, dead in the middle of the night, I heard a shrill scream—like a hunter gutting a deer, only to find that it survived the initial buckshot.


I wound up my hand-charged flashlight and exited the tent, aiming it from bushes to branches, and to the endless black that swallowed the gaps between the trees. The woods stayed silent after that—even the buzz of mosquitoes disappeared—but I stayed awake in my tent for an hour or so, straining my ears to hear what sounded like leaves crackling underfoot.


The next morning, as I was washing my work shirts in the Tookie River, a pink and grey sneaker washed ashore, caught in the reeds that lined the bank. I retrieved it and read the tag on the inside of the tongue: Woman's size 9.


Lots of things washed up in the river. Shoes, clothes, cardboard boxes and cartons of milk. I tossed the shoe back thinking it was another piece of junk.


Later that night I was eating a Big Mac from the Ambridge Street McDonald's, hugging my knees to my chest and trying to keep warm. Outside, the leaves began crunching again. I thought maybe a deer had smelt my food or noticed my camping light and came to investigate.


I unzipped my tent and went walking into the woods, following the sound. Whatever made the sound wasn't disturbed by my movement and kept creeping from tree to tree. My torch light started to stutter, and I stopped to wind the lever and boost the charge.


The light turned back on.


Ahead of me, something ducked behind a tree.


I froze, aiming the flashlight where I'd seen the face.


An animal would have scurried away. Dashed off into the thickets to escape the human presence.


The light started flicking again. I tilted it down to wind the lever—


Footsteps.


Disguising themselves amongst the *click-click-click* of the wind-up torch.


I turned on my feet, sliding on the loose leaves—the torch tumbling from my grip, and I zig-zagged between trees and rocks, sprinting back to the tent.


I zipped myself inside and waited.


I had no tools—no bear spray, no torch. Nothing to defend myself with.


I switched off the camping light and sat in the darkness, letting my ears work to their full breadth. The night went silent again—as still as the surface of water.


No bugs. Not even the crunch of leaves.


Nothing.


Except for one sound.


Wind, blowing gently against my tent.


Breathing.
