I am the last of the original group. It’s a strange thing to say, one that may be more bewildering to me than to you, dear readers.

I remember our youth- how naïve we were, full of untainted enthusiasm and ready to dive into the world’s mysteries with reckless abandon. With our raw intelligence and passion, we built connections and friendships, knowing little about each other beyond our names and talents.

I can barely recall the day we faced the so-called ‘powerful’ men of our world, trying every trick and theory we had to secure their funding. We gazed up at them, seated behind their mahogany desks, ivory tipped chairs, surrounded by crystal tumblers and old, mysterious whiskies, all of us filled with a mix of awe and envy. They had seemed more amused by our far-fetched theories than genuinely interested in our work. They cared only about the weapons and drugs we promised to create for their profit.

Now, after decades of heartache and adventures, I sit at my own beautiful leather and wood desk, a glass of brandy beside me as I write. And here I am, old- nearly 130, if you can believe it!- with white hair, wrinkled hands, and a back that aches in ways I can scarcely believe.

The stories I could tell! The titles and honors I’ve earned by uncovering the world’s secrets!

I am the last of the Soot Whisperers, the first of the Lyar Guards, and the Keeper of Secrets for the Last Prophet!

I’ve walked the delicate branches of Yggdrasil, crossed the Root Bridge to the land of Shade Trees, and stared into the eyes of the Abyssal King!

I’ve made gods flinch and men cheer; I’ve woven the Aurora Borealis from the chords of a lost child’s lament and commanded the Clay Armies for their final march!

I am Doctor Kayden Midler, former head researcher at the now-defunct LPS3. Creator of both atrocities and miracles alike.

**And I have a story for you, dear reader.**

It would take years for me to recount everything I wish you could hear, and I’m sorry to say that this isn’t one of the truly wondrous tales I long to share. Some stories, however, must be told- have to be told- before my time runs out.

This story dates back nearly 70 years. Providing all the context about the people involved, the background, and what exactly we were doing would make this tale nearly unreadable. But don’t worry, dear reader; I’ll have a chance to explain more another time.

It was myself, along with my dear colleagues Sarah, Peter, and our close friend Winston, who stood atop the Statrus Wall. Each of us was wrapped in layers of thick wool as the clouds swirled around us, threatening to snatch the breath from our lungs. The Wall- hundreds of meters high- was made of polished granite, etched deep with countless lines, grooves, and notches. These patterns twisted and intertwined in a dizzying display that made each step perilous. I remember that very feature being the cause of dear Natale’s tragic fall. Her screams, as she plummeted over the edge, reached our ears for what couldn’t have been more than ten seconds- but in our panic and sorrow, it felt like hours. Peter swore for years that her screams were swallowed by the wind, only to be whispered back into his ears whenever he tried to sleep.

We had been sent to this cursed place by the Wandering One, a man shrouded in silk robes so elusive I never managed to get a proper sample. His attire concealed every inch of his skin, casting a shadow over his face from beneath his hood. Only his eyes- an unsettling purple- met our gaze, making us feel defiled just by looking into them. His hands, with their short, twisted fingers, seemed ready to crush anything they touched with an unseen force. Despite his unsettling appearance, he was a man of his word- provided you met his price. He had promised us a magnificent temple on the Wall. Just as the Wall had been built to shield the remnants of life in this world, the temple was hidden in such an inhospitable location that its knowledge would remain untouched by prying eyes for eternity. And what better place? No other part of the world was as secure as a wall that seemed to kiss the stratosphere, a place those dreadful, crawling creatures below would never dare approach.

It was that temple we sought to plunder, driven by the hope of uncovering hidden knowledge. We yearned to decipher forgotten tongues and peel back another layer of the world’s mysteries. Our goal was to delve deeper, to break through yet another boundary- one even grander and purer than the wall we barely managed to stand upon.

As we trudged across the top of the Statrus Wall, struggling to maintain conversation to stave off madness and prevent ourselves from being driven off the edge by the dizzying carvings, I recalled the simple warning he had given us: “Do not go.” No amount of questioning had coaxed any further explanation from him about what awaited us at the temple. Despite our years of experience, we were driven by an insatiable curiosity. We needed to know more, to uncover every secret reality held within its depths. Our thirst for knowledge pushed us forward, even as we had already lost so much.

Forgive me, dear reader. I find myself now an old man, weeping over my paper, rather than the composed elder I once was. I realize you may not fully grasp the context or the urgency of my tale, and my time to clarify is short. I will move on.

I won’t dwell on the arduous journey it took to descend the miles- perhaps even hundreds- required to reach the temple nestled on the stone road atop the Wall. It was long, cold, exhausting, and painful. The warning we had so easily forgotten returned to us the moment we finally saw it. As a cloud drifted lazily away, revealing the object that blocked the sun, we beheld the temple. A grand edifice, blending elements of Japanese, Hindu, Nordic, and Roman architecture, it extended dramatically over the edges of the Wall by what must have been a hundred feet in each direction. The sight filled us with such exhilaration that we sprinted forward and burst through the massive wooden doors, which swung open with surprising ease despite their immense weight.

Our wind-chapped faces and aching eyes were met with the dank, musty interior of a building so solid it felt as though it rested on the ground below. The transition from the narrow, treacherous top of the Wall to this wide-open space was jarring. Poor Winston was so shaken by the change that he collapsed, and we laughed- oh lord, how we laughed! For the first time in days, we laughed until I nearly lost control, and Sarah threatened to be sick from the sheer relief and joy of it all.

Once we began to regain our composure, we looked around the welcoming chamber we had burst into. The room, decorated according to this land's standards, featured tapestries hanging on the walls and three well-carved stone benches of an unknown type. Another door appeared to lead deeper into the temple. But it was the tapestry above this door that caught our attention. It was adorned with elegant, swirling script, interrupted by sporadic notches similar to those on the wall. Peter, the youngest of our group at just forty, moved quickly to examine it. His sharp mind had made him adept at understanding the written word of this world, and after a quick glance at the fabric, he swore loudly. We all quickly turned our attention to him, abandoning our own explorations.

“It speaks of someone who’s name I can’t decipher, who guards these halls,” Peter said. “It warns us to find refuge in this room if necessary and to travel straight through the temple if we must continue down the Wall. But it advises against stopping or searching the temple itself.”

I recall Winston, my dear friend with lips that were quite memorable, scoffing loudly, and Sarah rolling her eyes. I must admit, I joined them in this reaction. After nearly four decades in the field, we had encountered our share of cryptic warnings, most of which had led to nothing more than a restless night. What harm would ignoring this warning bring? This was long before we had peeled back so many layers of space and time that every warning took on the weight of life-or-death advice.

And so we pushed open the door and entered the main chamber of the temple.

We spent days inside that immense structure. Floor to ceiling, it was filled with shelves of carved stone, laden with more scrolls and bound books than we could ever count. Sarah was captivated, running her fingers along a shelf with the far-away gaze she always got when she found something fascinating. “This is where I stop, my friends.” she declared. We didn’t bother asking for clarification; it had happened before, and we expected it to happen again. Members of our team would often find their purpose, their end mission, and then dedicate the remainder of their lives to unraveling the secrets of that one place.

Later that night, Winston and I laughed together, huddled close as we speculated on how deep reality’s layers might go. We joked about how far we would push ourselves, certain that we would continue until our bones gave out and our muscles atrophied.

Yet, the next day, we obeyed Sarah’s wishes. We set up an LPS3 Standard Team Beacon alongside the End of Chapter Beacon, marking the way for future explorers. The Team Beacon would signal for another research team to descend with additional equipment to support Sarah’s long-term mission, whilst the EOC Beacon would mark this as the way down, we were certain the answer was in this temple, could feel it in our bones and marrow. And so Sarah began to settle in for an extended stay, Winston, Peter, and I focused on finding a way to break through the next wall of space to the layer below.

I vividly remember our last day there. The night before, we had discovered several books with passages hinting at a path to the next world. Peter had carefully set these aside for further study in the morning while Winston and I prepared supplies for our journey. As Myself and Winston walked from our makeshift sleeping area, Sarah- who had grown increasingly quiet over the days- interrupted us. She nearly ordered us, two of the original founders of the LPS3, to the upper floors where she had set up an office. She claimed she had found something we absolutely needed to see.

We climbed the nearly dozen sets of stairs to Sarah’s quarters, pressing her for an explanation of what she needed to show us. She remained silent. It wasn’t until we reached the door to her room that she stopped, her hands splayed on the wood, her neck twisting unnaturally. A shiver ran up my spine as Winston’s hand gripped my arm, and we both watched her in uneasy silence. Her mouth moved slowly as she said, “Come in.” Despite our better judgment, we followed her into the office she had claimed.

The sight inside was chilling. Fear gripped my heart and soul as we took in our surroundings. None of us had ventured into Sarah’s personal space since we had dedicated ourselves to finding a way to the next layer. We had been captivated by the wonders we had seen, but this—this was different. This was our first encounter with true madness. The walls were covered in her drawings—wild, frantic, almost carved into the stone. They were in a language my mind could barely grasp, let alone translate.

Sarah, seemingly oblivious to the chaos she had created, strode over to her research notes, clutching them tightly. She turned to us with a grim smile. “The name. I found it,” she said, her voice ragged, her eyes wide with a disturbing excitement. Her smile, twisted and unsettling, spoke of her descent into madness.

“The Tapestry—the one outside the main temple,” she continued breathlessly, “I found what it means!” Her words seemed to reach Winston first. He blinked rapidly, struggling to process the situation, before finding his voice. “Yes, yes, I’m sure you have, my friend. Please, show me your notes?” He offered, his smile as forced as it was uncomfortable.

But Sarah’s reaction was anything but reassuring. With a sudden, wild shriek, she threw the book out the open window behind her. The paper fluttered away, destined to fall to the same fate as our colleague Natale.

Winston recoiled as Sarah shrieked, “Forgotten! The Forgotten Woman it reads! You fools, you damnable fools!” Her words seemed to distort reality itself. Everything around us warped and shrieked before snapping into focus, revealing the figure that now stood between us and Sarah. It was a woman, draped in fabric strikingly similar to the Wandering One’s. Her head was bowed, and wild, moss-like hair obscured her face. Her hands, ending in bloody stubs, were equally unsettling.

Her head snapped back with a sickening crunch, and she let out a shriek that I’ll never shake from my mind, despite downing nearly an entire bottle of brandy. Damnit it all! We fled, racing down the stone stairs, feeling as though the creature’s breath was hot on our necks. We abandoned Sarah to her fate, that awful face a nightmarish vision I’ll never forget- lips torn off, eyes gouged out, a jaw impossibly wide, and a mouth that was nothing but a black void.

We collided with a bewildered Peter, dragging him into the main chamber. We screamed at him to start whatever ancient ritual was needed to send us to the next realm. Peter stumbled, tried to speak, and confusedly explained why he couldn’t begin something he knew nothing about, all while questioning the madness unfolding around him.

Winston grabbed Peter’s shoulders, shouting into his face, shaking him and ranting about the horrific witch. Peter’s eyes were wide with confusion, clearly thinking us mad, until that terrible shriek echoed through the temple once more. Instantly, Peter sprang into action, frantically gathering pencils, chalk, paper, and other objects, creating a makeshift effigy between us.

I watched in terror as the door burst open and the creature crawled into the room from the darkened hall. Her head was twisted at an unnatural angle as she moved across the ceiling, jaw gaping to reveal the void within, eyes leaking purple awfulness. Winston grabbed me, pulling me away as I was transfixed by the sight. I hadn’t noticed the fire Peter had ignited behind me until Winston and Peter dragged me back.

The creature lunged from her perch, seizing Peter’s arm. Her mouth engulfed his fingers, and the most horrid sizzling noise filled the room as her throat consumed them. Peter bellowed in pain. I remember how I kicked at her jaw, sending her sprawling backwards as Winston, Peter, and I stumbled into the fire which had turned a putrid black after consuming the books. We were hurled into another world, unnamed and unknown to us.

Peter’s survival at the time remains a mystery to me. The corruption had gnawed at his bone and marrow up to his elbow by the time we finished vomiting upon our arrival. Winston, pale and sweating, his beard stained with vomit, swung his machete and severed the damaged arm. I frantically patched the wound with my clothing, fighting to stay conscious as darkness swam before my eyes.

I share this story with you, whoever you are, to remember it well. This creature seeks to be forgotten. We brought with us some books, one of which revealed more than I ever thought possible. The creature’s desire to remain forgotten means it can keep climbing, striving to reach our world. I don’t know what would happen if it succeeds, but I will be damned if I don’t do everything in my power to ensure it never gets that chance. So, with my last LPS3 Emergency Information buoy, I send this message to someone, anyone, in the world above.

Do not forget her! There is only so much Data this ancient relic can send at one time, so let this message go through! Do. Not. Forg-
