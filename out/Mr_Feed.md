Our eight-year-old daughter Kayla was obese and had no friends.  As one of the teachers at her school, it broke my heart seeing her at recess sitting against the building while her classmates played together.  I was helpless.  I tried repeatedly to introduce her to other kids, but they always shunned her off.  I kind of blamed myself.  I was large and all the unhealthy habits she picked up were a result of my parenting. 

But even when I turned my lifestyle around and started eating healthier and working out more, Kayla had no interest in following suit.  Her confidence was so low that she continued to comfort eat junk food.  Kids picked on her and called her names, and I had to intervene several times when a few of the kids shoved her to the ground.

Kayla’s mother had passed unexpectedly, so I was on my own when it came to watching over her.  A tough gig for a father who also took on a share of insults for his weight.  It was on a Tuesday morning though when I noticed a shift in Kayla’s behavior.  I looked through the classroom blinds and noticed Kayla laughing hysterically out in the play area.  What was concerning though was that she was still by herself.  She was chatting away and making silly faces, but there was no one on the receiving end.  I confronted her about it when I drove her home after school.

“It looks like you were having fun earlier during recess.  What were you doing?  Did you make any new friends?”

“Uh-huh.  That was Mr. Feed.  He’s my new friend.  He’s so funny daddy.”

“Mr. Feed?” My heart dropped.  An imaginary friend was the last thing she needed.  “Where did you meet him?

“He saw me eating my chips and came over to eat with me.”

To be nice, I played along.  “Does he live around here?”

“Oh.  I don’t know.  We were having so much fun.  I don’t think I asked him where he was from.”

“The next time you see him, you should ask—”

“He’s going to visit me real soon.  He promised!”

Two days later, one of the students in Kayla’s class went missing.  And later that week, what I found in Kayla’s room disturbed me deeply.  Sitting atop her desk was a yearbook photo of the missing girl Heather.  The word ‘Yum’ was written across the picture in black marker.

During dinner, I slid the photo across the table.  “Kayla, what is this all about?  Do you know where Heather is?”

“Mr. Feed took her.”

It was hard to take her seriously.  I was more worried that she may have been directly involved with the disappearance of Heather.

“Kayla.  If you know where Heather is, please tell me.  Her parents really miss her.”

“I’m telling you the truth daddy.  Mr. Feed is always hungry.”

“Is it okay if I meet this Mr. Feed and talk to him tonight?  Maybe he can give Heather back to us.”

Kayla looked to her right and whispered something unintelligible.  “He will come out later tonight,” she said.

Around midnight—as Kayla slept in her room—I rested on my bed and stared at the ceiling, sick to my stomach at the thought of Kayla having done something awful to Heather.  The house rumbled like an earthquake was erupting.  I ran to Kayla’s room.  Her door was jammed.

“Daddy, help!” she screamed.

There was a small crack maybe two inches wide giving a glimpse into the chaos unfolding.  Kayla was horizontal but floating in the air two feet above her bed.  Hoisting her in the air was a giant, pulsating blob of flesh.  Chunky fingers wrapped around the edge of the door and met my gaze.  I pushed harder until the hand retreated.

When I entered the room, my body shuddered.  I gasped and shook uncontrollably.  A monstrous being filled almost the entire space, leaving little room for me to even step forward.  A stomach bigger than the bed.  I looked up at the ceiling.  A mouth widened to the point that the entire ceiling was just a dark pit of black surrounded by glistening, blood-stained teeth.

CRUNCH

The sounds of Kayla wailing while her bones snapped will haunt me the rest of my days.  I fell to the floor in anguish as chunks of Kayla exploded across the room.  Mr. Feed catapulted me across the room, sending me crashing through the door and into the hallway.  The sea of flesh seeped into the floor and disappeared. 

The authorities never found Heather and Kayla.  But I know what happened to them.  Mr. Feed took them.  I don’t know what he is, but Mr. Feed is real.  He’s not imaginary.
