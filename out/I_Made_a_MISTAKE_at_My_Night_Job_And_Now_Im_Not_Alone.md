"We have strange rules at the resort," I say, glancing around to make sure no one else is listening. "But they're the only thing keeping me alive."

When I first came to the U.S., it felt like a dream. The cities, the opportunities—it was everything I hoped for. But dreams come at a price.

I was a broke student from Eastern Europe, struggling with rent, tuition, and food. Then, I found a job listing online: *"Night Lifeguard Wanted – Beach Resort."* The pay was better than anything I could find. So, I applied.

The resort was isolated—creepy, even—but I didn’t have many choices. Mr. Thompson, the manager, was straight to the point: *"You’ll be the night lifeguard. Just follow the rules."*

He handed me an envelope with the rules inside, told me to read them before my first shift, and sent me off. I needed the money, so I didn’t question it.

When I got home, I opened the envelope and found a single sheet of paper with a list of instructions typed neatly:

1. **Always start your shift at exactly 10:00 PM.**
2. **Make sure the lifeguard tower light is turned on by 10:05 PM.**
3. **If you hear footsteps behind you after midnight, do not turn around.**
4. **Never leave your post until your shift ends at 6:00 AM.**
5. **If you see someone in the water after dark, do not attempt a rescue. Report it immediately.**
6. **Keep a flashlight with you at all times, but never shine it directly at the water.**

The rules seemed strange, especially the one about the footsteps. It almost felt like a joke. But Mr. Thompson didn’t seem like the joking type. 

My first night was quiet. Too quiet.

I turned on the lifeguard tower light, settled into my post, and waited. The ocean was calm, the beach empty, and I tried to relax.

Hours passed, and nothing happened. I started to think this would be easy money. But, the rules stuck with me: *“If you hear footsteps behind you after midnight, don’t turn around.”* It sounded ridiculous.

It was just past midnight when I first heard it.

Footsteps.

They were faint but unmistakable, coming from behind me. My pulse quickened, and I fought the urge to turn around. My mind raced—*“It’s just a prank, right?”*

But the footsteps kept getting closer, and closer… until they stopped. Right behind me.

I stayed still, not daring to turn. The rules were clear. The rest of the night passed in silence, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something had been there.

The next night, things got worse.

I was halfway through my shift when I saw it—something in the water. It was dark, but the moonlight reflected off of a figure struggling far out at sea.

*“If you see someone in the water after dark, do not attempt a rescue. Report it immediately.”* That was the rule.

But instinct kicked in. *What if someone’s drowning?* I grabbed the binoculars, my heart racing, and that’s when I saw… it wasn’t a person.

The figure was still, floating unnaturally. But then…

*"Help me…"*

It was my brother’s voice, clear as day, calling out to me from the water. My brother, who was thousands of miles away. I knew I wasn’t supposed to shine the flashlight at the water, but in that moment, I didn’t care.

I pointed the flashlight at the water, heart pounding. And then, I saw it… a pale face, smiling at me. Not my brother. Something else entirely.

The smile was wrong—too wide, too sharp. My stomach dropped.

And then… I heard it again. The footsteps. Behind me.

Two threats. One behind me, and one in the water. My heart was racing. The footsteps grew louder, almost mocking me.

5:45 AM.

I kept my eyes forward, counting down the minutes, desperate for the shift to end. The footsteps were still behind me, pacing, waiting for me to break. Every second felt like an eternity.

Finally, I heard the distant sound of a bell—a signal that my shift was over. 6:00 AM.

I grabbed my things and bolted. I didn’t care what was in the water, or who—or what—was behind me.

I made it to the bus stop as the sun started to rise. Safe, for now. But I have to go back tonight.

My student loans aren’t going to pay themselves, and this job… it’s the only way I can stay afloat.

"We have strange rules at the resort," I say, glancing around to make sure no one else is listening. "But they’re the only thing keeping me alive."
