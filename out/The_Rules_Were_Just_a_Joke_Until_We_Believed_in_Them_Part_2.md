It’s been six nights since Jason vanished.

Or... whatever the hell happened to him.

No one talks about it. The manager hasn’t mentioned his name, and the other employees avoid eye contact when I bring him up. But I saw what happened. I saw Jason’s reflection grin and drag him through the glass like it was water. I know what I saw.

I should have quit. Every part of me screamed to walk away, pretend none of it happened. But I didn’t. Because I need to know what’s going on in this place. And because I think it’s already too late for me. Sometimes, when I look into the freezer doors by accident, I think I see something watching me. Not my reflection—something behind it.

So I stayed. And I started digging.

There was no official record of Jason ever working here. I checked the employee logs—gone. His badge disappeared. No one remembered hiring him. Even the manager shrugged and said, “Must’ve been temp.”

But Rae remembered. Rae had worked with him once before and saw what happened. She came back, just once, to talk to me. Told me she couldn’t sleep. Told me about the dreams. Told me about the reflection that sometimes smiles back.

That’s when I found the key.

A small, rusted thing taped to the underside of a drawer in the manager’s office. The manager was out sick—first time he ever missed a shift—so I took the chance and used it.

It opened a door I didn’t know existed, behind the employee lockers. A storage room filled with boxes of old files, VHS tapes, and incident reports. Most of them were water-damaged or chewed through by mice. But one box sat pristine. Almost... preserved.

Labeled: **"Rule Origin – 1997"**

Inside were hand-written notes. A yellowed memo titled "Employee Morale Initiative: SCPR (Satirical Company Policy Recreation)."

And then it hit me.

The rules were a joke.

It started with a guy named Dean. A night manager back in '97. Apparently, he thought it'd be funny to spook the new hires with a fake list of horror-movie-style rules. He wrote it with his buddy—a guy named Frank.

The two of them laughed about it for weeks. They even acted out some of the scenarios—Jason-style mannequins in the aisles, spooky whispers over the intercom. Cheap thrills.

Then Frank disappeared.

The incident report was chilling. The employee who found his locker said there was blood smeared on the inside. But no body. Just a pair of glasses folded neatly on the break room table.

Dean filed a second report later. In shaking handwriting, he wrote: "I think we made it real."

The joke became belief.

And belief, in this place, is a dangerous thing.

The rules weren’t just followed—they were *fed.* Every terrified new hire, every trembling employee who read that list and believed it... they gave it power. Dean theorized that the repetition, the fear, the ritual of the rules, created something. Like urban legend meets tulpa. A nightmare you summon by treating it like it’s already true.

He tried to destroy the list.

The store burned down two nights later.

They rebuilt it. Renamed it. And quietly kept the rules alive.

Not because they wanted to.

Because they had to.

The manager was Dean’s replacement. I found a photo buried at the bottom of the box—fresh-faced, young, and smiling with a clipboard in hand. I think that job aged him thirty years in five.

So here I am.

The rules aren’t growing.

They’re *multiplying.*

Every time someone breaks one, a new rule forms in its place. Every time someone dies, the rules get stronger.

I think the store is hungry.

And I think it knows my name now.

There’s no list tonight.

There’s only a mirror. And my reflection isn’t smiling anymore.

It’s watching me.

Waiting.

And I don’t think I’ll be leaving at sunrise.
