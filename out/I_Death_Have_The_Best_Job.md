So my Grandma Edna passed away, and I noticed something in her old typewriter. It's a few pages typed out with the title I have on this post and wanted to share it. What do you guys make of this? 


Hello, let me be up front. I am Death. The Grim Reaper. The Big Sleep. Whatever you want to call me. Many cultures have many names for me and many different depictions. It's fascinating really, if you have some time, do yourself a favour and research the stories Indigenous tribes tell about me and look up some artistic depictions of death. Honestly, there are no bad ones. They all capture unique aspects of me in various flattering ways and almost all of them get something right. It's fascinating how I can be portrayed in so many different ways and yet none of them are really wrong.

Anyways enough about the flattering art of me. I, Death had to make a house call tonight to a 94 year old lady who went peacefully surrounded by her 5 children, 8 grand children, and one great grandchild. After I was done escorting her away, I noticed in the bedroom which she passed that there was an old typewriter. I wanted to hammer out my side of things for you humans. I guess if you're reading this, then that means someone found it and either gave you a printed copy or they posted on that fancy internet thing which seems to be connected to those screens that you humans are obsessed with. To whichever human did this I thank you greatly, I hope to meet you some day when it is your time and thank you in person.

So you might be wondering what death has to say to the humans that was so important that it had to type out a whole manifesto in what it does. Well I wanted to set your minds at ease and clear up some misconceptions. You see I love my job, and while earlier I did say nearly every depiction of me got something right, there are some misconceptions. People are often downright afraid of me, or portray me as a bad guy. And you might be thinking I said I love my job earlier because I'm some sort of psychopath who gets off on seeing people's final breaths.

You see, this isn't true, and my job is far more peaceful, important, and full of honour than anyone realizes. Let me start with the 94 year old lady who passed away this evening. Her name was Edna. I got the sense that it was her time- you see I don't kill, I am simply dispatched when someone's time draws near- and I got to greet her, wrap her up and keep her warm. I'm not sure why but you humans always find it extremely cold when you first come over to this side. I introduced myself and asked if she was ready she said that she was and with my arms around her we crossed over.

Now comes the best part when she came over I managed to get her late husband, Walter, who I also brought over about six years ago now. She took his death extremely hard at the time and wouldn't get out of bed for a month. The pure elation that was on her face was beautiful. Then you should have seen her shock and elation when Walter turned around and had a baby in his arms. I stepped away at this point to let them have a private moment. This isn't my story to tell in full and I'll keep that extremely private and emotional moment between them. You see, Edna and Walter had a sixth child who passed shortly after giving birth. They called him Peter Walter, wrapped him in a blanket and I unfortunately had to come and take him way too soon. 

Child deaths are the worst you guys. When you have to come and take someone who hasn't even had a chance to live, even for Death that's a heavy burden. We keep them warm, we keep them comfortable and ultimately give them all they could want once here.

You should have seen the look on Walter Sr.'s face when he came over. At last this child that we had been looking after here on the other side was with his family again, and then Edna coming over was the absolute best moment. I look forward to they day when hopefully many years from now the other five adult children crossover and the whole family can be together.

This is just one example. Every day, family members are reunited and I get to be a part of that. You might ask if this is heaven, and not really. None of the religions people came up with really got it all that right other than the fact that it's an after life where you get to be with your loved ones. This brings up another detail that I love.

You see, not everyone dies and eventually has a family to meet. Some people unfortunately die alone with no one, or people die as children like Peter from earlier and have to wait decades before anyone comes over. We have what we call The Comforters. These Comforters look into these people's souls and see what their greatest needs were in life. They do their absolute best to meet those needs, and tend to them until some family can come over. In some cases these lonely souls make friends with each other and become each other's Comforter. Which is one of the most beautiful things you have ever seen.
The absolute best comforters tho are the pets from the Rainbow Bridge. 

The Rainbow Bridge. I Don't know how but you humans got the idea of your beloved pets passing absolutely right. Your beloved pets go across the rainbow bridge, and they also get the privelege of comforting our more lonely souls. And then when it is your time to pass you will also get to meet them and get all the time in that you so desperately missed when they pass. Your humans say that your animals lives are much too short, but don't worry, they are comforting the lonely, and when your time eventually comes they will be there right by your side again. 

I hope this clears up some misconceptions and I wanted to give you humans a bit of hope. I will be seeing you when your time comes, and when it does we here on the Other side look forward to reuniting you with those who went before you. Or perhaps finding you some new joy or friends so that this existence will be much more comfortable for you. 

I will be seeing you when I do

Sincerely, 

Death


I don't know what to make of this note. No one has been in my grandma's house since that night. I slept at her place that night because mine is too far away. I thought I heard a typewriter in my dream that night. But I thought a dream is all it was. Now I'm not so sure.
