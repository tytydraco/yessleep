So, I'll just start this off by saying I'm not a particularly religious person nor do I believe in animal whisperers, but I figured someone here on the internet might have some kind of answers. Over the past few weeks something strange has been happening to me that I can't quite come to terms with.

Let me preface what I'm about to tell you by saying; I live alone. No pets, no people. I have for a long time.

SECTION 1: Background info

Okay so I should probably go back to the beginning. As a kid I never had the best living situation, both of my parents were, and probably still are extreme hoarders. Our house consisted of mounds of essentially trash, though neither of them would agree with that view. Despite this, my parents got a pet dog which only added to the foul mess, they never properly cleaned up after the poor thing so the trash soon became damp and clumped with animal feces. This has led me to have a sort of cynic view of owning pets, never wanting to experience what I had to when I was young.

The dog itself, I faintly remember being named Max, was a beautiful husky breed with those majestic light blue eyes that feel like they can see into your soul. Me and Max were quite close and I always felt like he was watching over me like I was a pup and he had to protect me from something that, I think we both knew wouldn't ever be there. He would always stare off vacantly into another room or back me into a safe corner in the trash piles and sit there like he was standing guard. When we would go on walks with him he would be completely different, happy and free, sniffing everything curiously as dogs do. Maybe the environment inside the house affected him just as much as me.

These are the only major memories I have of Max. We had him for a few years, maybe 3 before he just disappeared one day. My mom said he probably ran off and didn't come back, but that was completely unlike him. He was always keen on being near one of us at all times like didn't like being alone. My parents loved him, and so did I.

SECTION 2: The find

Skipping ahead to more recently, I'm 24 now. I had long forgotten Max, and a lot of my childhood memories here through the stress of adulthood. All through last year me and some of my friends have been cleaning out and restoring my parent's old house since they're moving out to a different state. It's hard, payless work but I feel it's really coming together, and I convinced my mom to let me live here instead of selling, because I'm so tired of apartment living. We had to have cleared out at least a metric ton of trash and waste, and we had to completely replace a few of the wood floors, let alone the lingering smell that still persists in a few spots a year later.

Anyway, about 9 months in (There's only 3 of us, and we have jobs) We had gotten to what was essentially the bottom layer or trash. An awful smell none of us have encountered before begin emanating from one of the bigger piles over a few weeks. We all had gas masks, nothing fancy just the type for painting from Walmart. None of the smells of the house really phased us with the masks on but this newly uncovered rotten, sickly smell seemed to spill through the mask like fluid fingers of pure putridity touching your senses in just the right way to make you lose your stomach. Which I almost did when we were close to fully bagging up the pile to be taken out.

This is when I noticed an odd shape in the litter. Brown, one or two shades off from dirt, in the shape of a dog's paw.

I was the first to notice it, my two friends who I will keep anonymous, had left the room to get a breather. I stood there in stunned, confused shock as I stared at it, sticking out under discarded packaging, desecrated brown and yellow paper and cans of soda. My brain processing at double speed as I start feeling queasy and out of it, staring blankly. 'Had my parents owned a dog? Yes... Yes they had. I think'. I looked away for a moment, breathing in with my mouth, which I immediately regretted, the smell I was wanting to avoid was equally potent in taste, I dry heaved a few times and regained composure, bending down and pressing the mask tightly to my face as I started peeling away trash with a thankfully, gloved hand.

Revealing more only showed me more of what I didn't want to see. A sunken, leathery frame. The skin just a thin but firm canvas over dry bone. I started uncovering the rest, the midsection forward until I got to the head. Immediately, a beetle crawled out of its wide open mouth, which did less to scare me and more so make me feel even more sick and uneasy. It's expression was... It looked like it was in absolute agony before it died, maw gaping, eye sockets squinted, petrified muscles pulled in a permanent last yelp of pain that nobody ever heard.

I stared, now at its face, still as just stunned but now my brain silenced itself with a dark final realization. Max. He wasn't missing.

That was probably the hardest thing for me to clean, mentally and physically... And the first floor we had to replace. I just wanted to get it over with, forget about it and move on with this house. It never stopped the thoughts from coming though, whenever I had time to think. 'How did it die?', 'How didn't anyone notice?'. It didn't make sense for it to be on the bottom layer. That section of the trash was old, possibly older than me. This haunted me, my childhood pet dead, hidden under mounds of trash in a house I lived in, with it there for years without us noticing.

SECTION 3: The start of my problems

Over the last few months we have gotten the rest of the trash out, finally. Some of the floors are completely done and replaced, mostly in the first rooms of the house. The nauseating smells masked and overtaken by the smell of fresh paint on the walls. My friends felt like they were finished here, which I agree with. We've made more progress than I felt was possible for this old house. Now that they aren't here anymore it feels kind of lonely, but at the very least I've moved some furniture in; A decent twin size bed, which I am too tall for so I have to curl my legs in at night. I also brought my desk and PC, all of my clothes, and my collection of tactical gear. I was never in the army or anything, I just like owning the stuff, vests, helmets, GPNVGs... of which I'm still feeling and regretting the purchase of, on top of this house, was a bad decision. Never used the things except once when I was out camping. God bless America, right?

I also own a few replica guns for display which I didn't bring, and one real one. A simple Beretta M9 gifted to me by my grandfather (Who served in the army through the 80's) which I keep in a lockable drawer in my nightstand. For obvious reasons, I'm not going to say where I keep the key. I've heard of stalkers finding where people live on the internet and I don't want to deal with that on top of everything else happening.

Things have been calm and I felt fairly safe in the house, albeit with some recurring stress dreams. That aside I had been feeling fully ready to move in and live here. Until I just... wasn't, it's an odd feeling I can't really explain that started about 2 weeks ago, before anything happened. Feeling watched, in broad daylight, in an empty room is a feeling I think nobody wants to feel. It persisted however, in my room, in the kitchen, the empty living room, which ironically feels lifeless now. I had taken to watching youtube videos on my monitor to distract myself, but my tendency (and the popularity of) watching horror game playthroughs had a negative effect. Constantly looking over my shoulder catching imaginary glimpses of animalistic reflective eyes.

Wait, why that specifically, why was I thinking about animal-like eyes? I can't seem to get that damn poor dog out of my mind. It's been months since I found it, it's still affecting me. I've seen similar and worse in my life but this is sticking with me differently, I can't be callous to the fact that it was my childhood pet I found like that. It keeps playing out in my mind, similar, but different variations of how it died... Getting crushed? why else would it be so deep, there was nothing in this house that could hurt it other than that. The sounds of it dying muffled by the heaps of waste around it, suffocating.

Needless to say, I had trouble sleeping, not really from fear, but I don't really know what, I guess I don't quite need an excuse, I'm not the best at sleeping on time. I was laying there scrolling social media on my phone late into the night when I felt a shift in my blanket, like when it gets clumped up and falls off the bed in one place, so I didn't think much of it but I did look. After looking at the screen for so long even on the darkest setting I couldn't see anything but a wall of black. I figured I'd pause the video I was on and turn off my phone, setting it aside. A few minutes later I started to hear this distinct 'tacking' noise in what I think was the living room and kitchen. *Tac tac tac tac...* Moving along the ground, stopping, moving. A set of 2. "I left the door open didn't I... Strays." I speak to only comfort myself as I sit up on my bed.

Whatever it was heard me and I heard the same set skitter off, quickly. I walked into the living room, looking at the windows, the streetlights pouring in through them, a dim blue-white haze. Different from the orange I grew up with. I used the bit of reality to ground myself mentally but that was immediately undone when I saw the door was still closed, as were the windows. I checked if it was locked, it was. I then looked around, the house looked unchanged, I glanced in a few rooms, not noticing much in the darkness. I then headed back to my room, thinking I just realty need sleep. I stopped at my door, on the bottom something on it looked darker than the rest of it near the corner. I knelt down and felt it with my fingers, frayed exposed wood like an animal was trying to scratch through the door and get into my room.

This must not have been very recent, I closed my door when I slept only on the first few nights, trying to limit the smell of the place however I could. I was exhausted on those days so I probably could have slept through anything. Great. Some stray or something is living in here, I'm not surprised. I've got to stop eating in my room.

SECTION 4: Unwanted friend

Over the next few days I looked through the house top and bottom, not finding any unwanted pets or pests and for a few nights nothing happened. On the 6th of this month, however... I was lying in bed, this time not on my phone, just thinking. I heard my door open slightly, no creak or groan, just the soft slip of something brushing between the door and its frame, into my room. I stayed silent and looked to see what it was, intentionally not moving much. The figure came to the end of my bed on my side and sat down, my eyes adjusted a bit and it looked like... A dog. The darkness like a fog of black making it hard to tell for sure. I grabbed my phone and sat up, turning on its flashlight and pointing it just below the figure so I could see it. Immediately I saw its light blue eyes staring back at me behind that familiar animalistic glaze.  
  
“Woah, hey now uh…” I removed my covers and got out of bed, kneeling down in front of it, its fur pattern calling back distant memories that have yet to surface. “What the.. Fuck”. My hand went to search for a collar, one wasn’t visible. In response it got up from it’s sitting position and backed away slowly. “How long have you been here buddy?”. I didn't expect a response, this time it walked off out of my room, slipping through the mostly closed door again. I followed it out and through the house to the kitchen, where it sat down, looking up at me, then down at the floor where… I remember that’s where we kept Max’s food bowl years ago, it was still there till we threw it away while cleaning the place. “Huh.. Were they feeding you?” … “hffh..” I sigh and walk back to my room, dialing my mom’s phone number, not really expecting her to pick up at this hour.   
  
To my surprise she actually answered after a few rings. “Hello? Dear It’s quite late here”. It was a bit of a relief to hear her voice, I replied “Hey mom uh, did you guys keep another dog here, did you leave it here?”. There was a pause, only for a confused response from my mother after “No? What do you mean? We didn't own another after Max. I still miss that pup you know.”. I was a bit un-relieved to hear this. “Right, but I think another dog’s been living here, eating from Max’s bowl or something, did you guys feed it? Like it was a stray or something”. There was another pause before her response. “Ohh you know, your father, he would always fill up that bowl like Max was gonna come around and eat it up. With his mind not being what it used to, I figure he thought Max was still about and came to his senses in the mornings and threw it out, but it was always empty in the morning. Why, did he leave some in it and forget?”. I thought for a moment. “Oh, no actually. The dog came to my room and brought me to the kitchen like it was asking for food.”. I heard her laugh a bit “Well dear i think you have yourself a pet, must have moved in with you. Don’t know anything about another dog being around. You best take care of it. I’m going to catch some sleep now, let’s catch up again sometime hon.”. I sighed “Sounds good, bye mom.”  
  
I put my phone in my pocket and walked back into the kitchen, the dog was gone and my fridge was open, various food products on the floor. “Eugh, smart bastard.”. I Noticed all of my hotdogs were gone, the plastic wrapping shredded all over the floor. I chuckled a bit and started packing everything back into the fridge. I got back into bed expecting to see the dog somewhere but I didn't, and I didn’t in the morning either. It’s like the thing crawls out of the house or something, or worse, deeper into the walls of the house meaning I'd have some holes to patch somewhere. I waited all day to see the thing but it never came to see me. And since it didn't come back I didn't make an effort to attempt to feed it.  
  
I didn't consider that it would make an effort itself.  
  
SECTION 5: This isn't normal, I think I need help  
  
Last night was different. I had another stress dream. I woke up and… You know those dreams where it fakes you waking up and it feels real, but you soon realize you’re in another nightmare? It was like that. I sat straight up staring into the darkness, I see the dog looking at me, its head hung unnaturally low, mouth open. I stared at it in confusion, but it felt like it was looking past me blankly. “What are you doing? Stop that.” I said firmly, like I was telling it off just for unnerving me. It’s head swaying side to side slowly, maintaining that same blank stare, completely silent. “Seriously, what the fuck.”. Talking entirely to myself to stop myself from freaking out. I take off my covers and sit up straighter, hoping this will end and I might wake up again as if I'm still dreaming.   
  
I heard a hoarse, dry, almost whisper. “You will feed me.”. The voice sounded like it was coming from just behind the dog, like the dog was some kind of puppet to something I couldn't see in the darkness.  
  
It’s not that i couldn't scream, i could, but it only came out in a short, forced yell like i was a primitive human paces away from a predator i couldn't comprehend. I fumbled quickly for the keys to my nightstand drawer, my mind blank, or perhaps moving too fast for it to comprehend itself, my hands becoming miles away from my perception as they act on their own accord and plunge the key into the slot, fiddling with it, not being able to fully turn it. I look back at the dog, it’s blank eyes now piercing knives to my own, focused on me like i just killed its entire family and it’s last will in life was to hunt me unto my death, the kind of singular purpose death stare you would think only a human could give another human. I froze, likely shaking violently, as it started to copy this movement, getting on all fours and shaking, it’s eyes never leaving mine. I watched as its skin sunk in on itself to the bone, the skin around its eyes retracting leaving blue orbs amid bone and fur, fur that is now shedding off. More accurately being pushed out of its skin.   
  
It stopped shaking entirely, became completely still, and in one foul motion, an instant, it collapsed itself to the floor, bony legs contorting. As soon as it did this it began rapidly and with purpose, crawling like a demonic insect. It’s claws not finding any traction on the wood floor but with still remarkable speed finding its way to space below my bed. This is when I finally let out a real scream, my body spasming instinctually like it’s already on me. I reach back to my nightstand and force the key with strength that only comes when a human knows they are in their last moment, the key bent, the key mechanism snaps inside and i open the drawer. It flies out of the nightstand and skids across the floor, the gun inside falling to the floor, sliding, and hitting the wall across the room. Without even questioning I leap out of bed and run to the wall, bumping into it with a bit of force and scrambling for the gun. I pick it up, rack the slide two too many times in desperation and put three purposeful shots where I think the “dog” is.  
  
BANG, BANG, BANG  
  
I felt the shots reverberate in the mostly empty room, coming back to my sensitive ears like a hammer-stricken chisel. I groaned and winced as I heard only my unrelenting heartbeat for a moment, then the pained ringing that follows. Taken out of the situation by this new pain I reach for my door handle, pushing my body through the doorway and into the wall of the hallway. I kicked my bedroom door shut and single-mindedly headed towards my front door, when I was only an arms reach away I heard the bedroom door slam open. What walked out was anything but what it wanted me to think it was days ago. Standing on two, shaking legs. It picks up its pace, *tac tac tac tac*… A set of 2.  
  
Without a semblance of method I aimed the pistol with one hand, pulling the cold metal trigger as fast as my locking tendons could allow, emptying the entire magazine with prejudice. Each shot a hammer blow to an anvil that my brain rests upon, yelling in the hopes it would lessen the pain to no avail, this moment was a prison my mind wouldn't move past until internal decades have passed, mere seconds in time. I had awoken from the protective trance my mind placed itself in to the repeated clicking of the trigger, in a newly formed panic I threw the gun in the direction of the dog only for it to land with an inaudible but felt thud to the floor as it slides down the hall, slide locked back, casings still rolling. But no "dog".  
  
A noticeable trail of blood splayed in a frantic escape of smears, spurts, and one long leak leading into a back room of the house, I stared down the hall for what was likely much too long before getting up and running out of the house. I think the gun has my prints on it, the blood, what if they don't find the dog, or the dog just looks like a regular dog, I’m not going back in there but I don’t know what to do. I’m standing outside right now, the sun is rising. Should I call the police and try to make some kind of sense out of this to them? Maybe they will have to finish it off. I don’t know maybe someone already called. It’s so hard to think clearly right now, please someone. I need advice.
