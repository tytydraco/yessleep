I just want to sleep. 

I lay in bed, listening to the mechanical whir of the space heater keeping the bedroom at a somewhat livable temperature. Snow sleepily drifted past the window in large white clumps. I shifted my gaze over to my wife, her face shrouded by her dark hair, who was fast asleep. I watched her eyes twitch underneath her eyelids. Jealousy.

I have not slept it what feels like days. Every night I twist and turn, get up, piss, take a melatonin gummy, lie in bed, and wait. Sometimes I give up and end up watching Star Trek reruns in the living room until morning. Again and again. I am so tired.

Tonight felt different. Tonight, I thought to myself, that the stars will align and the asshole sleep god who decided to torment me with his sick jokes will finally leave me alone. I take a determined breath, get up, and do my insomniac routine. I close my eyes and try to allow myself to fade away, even if it's just for a few minutes...

I jolt awake, clutching my sweat-soaked T-shirt. My chest heaves before I cough, my tongue scraping against my throat like sandpaper. I turn to reach for water on the nightstand, then stop. My wife is sitting up in bed, completely still. She is staring out into the hallway, her hair draped around her like a black curtain.

"Cassie?" No response. "What is it?" I creep up next to her to maybe catch a glimpse at what she saw. I turn to look at her face and I'm met with dark, unblinking eyes. Her pupils are huge. They stare right past me, into the void that looms from the doorway. "What's wrong?"

Her eyes meet mine, and I feel panic skitter up my spine like little spiders. She smiles. A stupid, horrible, lifeless grin. One that I have never seen before. A black substance pours from her lips and onto the bed in a small pile.

Sand.

I backpedal away from her and onto the floor with a thud. Pain rockets through my shoulders as I slam into the doorframe and into the dark of the hallway. She still sits on our bed, unmoving.

Something moves in the darkness ahead of me. It travels low, with a swushswushswush as it scampers across the hardwood floor. I watch it stoop in the the corner adjacent to the stairwell, emitting a low, raucous moan.

"Dexter?" I called out to our Labrador Retriever, a senior and on his way out, but still beloved in our household. I was able to make out his silhouette against the bannister, shuddering where he stands. I slowly make my way up to him, my feet crunching on something gravelly along the floor. Slowly, I approach the sad little thing hunched by the stairwell, my arms outstretched in front of me. "Hey, buddy. What's goin' on?"

Dexter turns around, his sad eyes meeting mine. He lets out another slow whine, but it stops abruptly as he begins to sink into the floor, his features melting with him. My stomach lurches and I scramble forward, trying to pick up what's left of him, but his body just crumbles in my hands and sifting through my fingers. 

I cry out, but I'm stopped by another heaving, dry cough. I can feel that same horrible sandpaper move along my esophagus and into my lungs. I retch, and more black sand spews from my mouth. I crumple onto the floor, unable to stop disgorging the horrid stuff. I can't stop. I can't breathe. I can feel my vision darkening around the edges oh god I can'tbreatheIcan'tbre-

------------------------

I jolt awake, clutching my sweat-soaked T-shirt. My head snaps to my wife, sound asleep beside me, Dexter cuddled up in her arms. The dark void of the hallway is grinning at me.

I will not be sleeping again anytime soon.
