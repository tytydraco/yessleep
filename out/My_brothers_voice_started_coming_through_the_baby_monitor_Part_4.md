Dad’s smile was too wide—a mask barely hiding the tension beneath.

We didn’t respond. Just stepped inside.

Sam went in first, clutching Ellie. I followed, eyes locked on him.

He stood like he was waiting for a cue. An actor hoping the scene would end before everything falls apart.

Sam didn’t give him one.

“Carl,” she said, cool and direct. “We need to talk.”

He blinked, then forced a chuckle. “You guys look like hell. What’s going on?”

“When we moved in,” I said, “we found a wooden horse in the attic. Hand-carved. Worn smooth. We gave it to Ellie.”

Sam’s voice was steady. “But when we left the house and came back—it was waiting for us. On the front step. We never put it there.”

Carl didn’t blink. “Old houses stir things up. Maybe you dropped it. Or the wind caught it. These things happen.”

“There’s something in that house,” I said. “And it’s not the wind.”

He gave a slow, sympathetic nod. “You’re new parents. Worn out. Trauma messes with the brain—it sees patterns that aren’t there...”

Sam stepped forward. “Caleb warned us, said Ellie was in danger.”

The smile vanished.

I pressed. “He said you blamed him. For what’s happening to us.”

Carl looked down, then shook his head slowly. “You’re remembering grief. Not a conversation. Sometimes echoes sound like meaning.”

He didn’t look up.

I said, quietly, “Frank always wanted a brother too.”

He shattered.

Carl dropped into the chair like his knees gave out, face gone pale. His hand reached for the table but missed, hovering uselessly midair before falling to his lap.

“They never said his name,” he murmured. “Not once. But I found it—scratched on the back of a photo buried deep in a drawer. I was six. I asked Mom. She was drunk. Stared into her glass for a long time before she said, ‘He didn’t cry. Not even when they came for him. Just stared at me, like he knew.’ Then she started sobbing—ugly, choking sobs—and she never spoke his name again.”

His hands clenched. “They cut him out of time itself. Not just gone—like he’d never taken a breath.”

He looked up, voice raw. “I didn’t know him. I wasn’t even born. But I missed him anyway. I needed him. When it got bad with my father, I used to talk to him—pretend he never left. He was the brother who protected me. Who understood. Who sat next to me in the dark and said, ‘We’ll get out of here.’ I thought I made him up just to survive.”

He looked up at us, voice thick.

“Our father wasn’t loud. Just exact. He didn’t hit us in anger. Only when things were... misaligned. He’d pull you into that basement and not say a word the whole time. Just wait. And then it started.”

He looked toward Ellie, then away.

“I thought I made Frank up. A protector in my head. Someone to talk to when no one else listened. Turns out, I’d been talking to a ghost.”

Sam’s arms tightened around Ellie.

Carl went on. “The horse isn’t just a toy. It’s a marker. It’s how they start the ritual. The child bonds with it. That bond creates an opening. Something starts to listen.”

“You put it there,” I said. “In the attic. Before we moved in.”

Carl nodded, slowly. “Before the sale closed. I told myself it was tradition. That I wasn’t really doing anything. But I was. I knew what it meant.”

“You blamed Caleb,” I said. “Why?”

“Because when he died, the curse passed to you,” Carl said. “The pact only targets the youngest living child—a blood-etched tether, passed down like a curse older than memory. When he died, that became you. And that meant Ellie.”

He trailed off.

Sam’s voice was quiet but cutting. “You blamed your son for dying because you couldn’t face the truth that you’re just as evil as your father. That you are the one who set this in motion.”

Carl didn’t answer.

The silence stretched.

Then he exhaled, voice smaller.

“Staring into the abyss of death changes you. Not just the act. The absence. The closer I got to it, the more I thought about the ritual. About what it promised. A way back. I kept telling myself it wasn’t real. Just superstition. A story passed down. But even as I said it, part of me knew—I was lying. I knew what I was doing. I wanted to come back. Even if it meant stealing her future.”  

He looked at Ellie again, and this time his face was raw.

“I held her in the hospital. Her fingers curled around mine, and I felt something break in me. Not guilt. Not dread. Just this aching, fragile hope—like maybe this was it. My second chance.”

He wiped his eyes.

“But it’s not a second chance. It’s theft. It’s what my father did to Frank. It’s what I almost did to her. The pact allows members of our bloodline to live again, if the price is payed. My father is hungry for his turn."

“What do we do?” I asked.

“You burn the house,” he said. “With the horse inside. It has to be on that land. If the horse survives, so does the door.”

We turned to leave.

Carl didn’t follow.

Just as I reached the door, he spoke again.

“Jake.”

I stopped.

He didn’t rise—just lifted his eyes slowly, like the weight of them hurt.

“Are you sure?” he asked. “You can always have more kids.”

I walked out.

Didn’t look back.
