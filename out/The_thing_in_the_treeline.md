This happened in 2019. I haven’t told anyone. I almost convinced myself it didn’t happen at all.

I was camping alone on the edge of the Mount Hood National Forest in Oregon. I’d been doing solo overnights for about a year. It helped with stress. Gave me space. I knew the area, had all the gear, and logged my location with my roommate before I left.

The spot I picked was about four miles off the nearest trail. It was deep in, but not unfamiliar. A small clearing surrounded by dense pine. Quiet. No signs of recent campers. I set up before dusk, cooked, hung my bear bag, and turned in just after dark.

Sometime after midnight, I woke up with that *feeling*. Not to pee, not from a sound - just that weird stillness that makes your body go rigid before your brain knows why.

I lay there, breathing shallow, straining to hear anything outside the nylon wall of my tent. Nothing. No wind. No insects. No forest noise at all.

And then I heard breathing.

Not mine. Not close. It was steady and low, coming from outside, maybe twenty feet away.

I didn’t move. I didn’t even open my eyes at first. Just listened.

It wasn’t panting. Not animal-like. It sounded *controlled*, like someone was intentionally breathing slowly through their nose. Like they were trying to listen, too.

Eventually, I opened my eyes and looked at the roof of the tent. Moonlight made everything slightly visible.

Then I heard a footstep.

Not a heavy stomp. A careful step, in pine needles.

I reached for my knife. I didn’t unzip the sleeping bag or turn on my headlamp. I just lay there holding it.

Ten minutes passed. Maybe more. No more movement. No more sound. Eventually, I talked myself down and drifted back off.

When I woke up at dawn, I found footprints.

They circled my tent. Once. Carefully. No signs of running, or panic, or boots from a ranger. They were barefoot.

I wanted to believe it was a prank. Maybe a transient. Maybe a hunter messing with me.

But the tracks didn’t leave in any direction. They circled the tent - and **stopped**. Mid-stride. Like whoever made them had just disappeared.

I packed up and left. Fast.

A week later, I went through my photos. I take pictures of all my campsites - standard wide shots, for memory and location tracking. I hadn’t looked at the last one until then.

In the far background, deep in the tree line, there’s a figure.

It’s not moving. It’s not waving. It’s just **standing**.

Tall. Thin. Barefoot. Facing the camera. Perfectly still. Like it had been there the whole time.

But the worst part isn’t the picture. The worst part is what I realized last night.

I went back to look at the tent footprints again, just to prove to myself they were real. I zoomed in on the track closest to my tent - about a foot from where my head was while I slept.

There was a second set of prints.

Smaller.

Like a hand.
