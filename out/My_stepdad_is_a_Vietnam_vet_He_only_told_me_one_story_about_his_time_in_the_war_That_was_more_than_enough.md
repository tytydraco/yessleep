Given that Memorial Day is near, I've decided to share the one story my stepfather has told me about his time in Vietnam.  


First, you need to understand who my stepfather is. I won't give his name, of course, but suffice to say that he is the definition of hard on the outside, soft on the inside. He's a loving husband to my mom and he's been a better dad to me and my brother than he ever had to be, but to look at him you'd swear he had no sense of humor at all. For the record, though, he has an amazing sense of humor.  


He definitely has the thousand-yard stare, like most men of his generation. He was drafted into the Army and sent to Vietnam when he was only sixteen years old. Before he could even drink, he had seen things that would drive most people to alcoholism. As ambivalent as I am about war, I have to give my respect to people like him who sacrificed so much of themselves in those jungles.  


As a strict rule, I've never asked him directly about his wartime experiences. I have no interest in making him relive those horrible memories. One time, however, I didn't even have to ask.  


My stepdad spends most of his time in his recliner, watching old Westerns and the news while drinking Bud Lite. He lives for simple pleasures like that.   


This particular day he was already a few beers into his quota and the news was talking all about the war in the Ukraine, which was just starting back then. I remember consciously thinking we should change the channel because of all the talk about bombing and shooting and I was scared it would trigger something in him.   


It's worth noting that despite his time in Vietnam, my stepdad's never shown any extreme symptoms of PTSD. He has the stare, sure, but I've never known him to have night terrors or violent mood swings at all. The man I've always known is mild-mannered and quiet.  


The suits on TV were talking all about what was going on in the Ukraine when my stepdad said, "those fools don't have a damn clue what they're talking about." I know that sounds cliched, but it's what he said. Nothing irks him quite like people talking about stuff they clearly know nothing about.  


He took another sip of beer and before I could get a grip on what he was saying, he started to tell a story. I'll try to relate it as best I can, but trust me when I say it's not easy.  


To hear my stepdad tell it, Vietnam was the first war where we realized we were facing an enemy that would do literally anything to win. Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, many Japanese officials wanted to warn the USA a half hour beforehand because they were concerned that the bombing would be "dishonorable" if it was totally unexpected. That doesn't make much sense to me, but the point is at that time there were unsaid rules for warfare. In Vietnam, all rules were thrown to the wind and soldiers were faced with, as stepdad put it, "an enemy more savage than we'd ever thought they would be."  


My stepdad's platoon was near Hue when it happened.   


They were several miles out from the nearest military outpost. They were supposed to be making their way to the nearest rendez-vous when they found a village, quiet as a mausoleum. Of course, the first thing they were all expecting was an ambush. They readied their weapons and prepared as best they could, but it wasn't long before they realized that every building was empty. The entire village was deserted. Their next thought was that they'd stumbled into a mine field, but that couldn't be true because the engineers hadn't found any beforehand. They figured there might even be a sniper, but that was ruled out when they finished searching the place. The platoon leader ordered them all to slowly make their way through the village, never once letting themselves come out from behind cover.  


They were about halfway through when the quiet was pierced by a horrible, high-pitched screaming.   


The entire platoon immediately readied for combat, steadying their weapons in the direction the screams had come from. I don't think any amount of training would've prepared them for what they saw next.  


Out of the trees ran about a dozen children. The oldest wasn't more than twelve and the youngest couldn't have been older than seven. They were all screaming like maniacs, their eyes wide open and unblinking like they were about to bulge out of their skulls. Each of them had an automatic weapon in their hands, firing wildly in the direction of the platoon.  


It was the only time my stepdad ever saw his squad leader pause before giving an order. The guy had been in Vietnam for a while, and even he couldn't believe his eyes. Once he snapped out of it, he gave the only order he could to protect his men. My stepdad said it was the only time he'd ever aimed and fired his weapon with his eyes closed. He couldn't bring himself to watch as he did what he had to do to survive.  


It wasn't until much later that they got the whole story: the Viet Cong had gotten to the village about a week before they had. They'd abducted all the children from the village and killed anybody who protested. They spent that next week doing whatever they could to brainwash the children into joining the VC, including torture. To hear the higher-ups tell it, the village originally had a lot more than just about a dozen children.   


They'd pumped the kids full of drugs like LSD and PCP and given them guns, sending them out on suicide missions on the chance that they might kill any soldiers they could. The children were pretty much completely insane by the time they'd been sent out to attack my stepdad's platoon.  


"There ain't no basic training can prepare you for the moment you have to gun down a bunch of kids to stay alive," my stepdad said, "ain't nothing in life can prepare you for that. The only way I've ever been able to live with it is knowing what those kids had gone through, death was probably the best thing anybody could do for them."  


I honestly couldn't speak after he finished his story. I could hardly even breathe.  


To this day, it's the only talk we've ever had about his time in Vietnam. I think you can appreciate why I say it's more than enough.   


I know this is stupid for me to say, but even though I've never seen a war or been anywhere near Vietnam, I feel like I lost a bit of innocence after I heard that story.   


If I'm completely honest, I still have nightmares when I'm in those jungles myself, and I don't know what's worse; the screaming or the insane look in their eyes.
