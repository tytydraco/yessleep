When I was a baby, my mother was in an abusive relationship with my father. He was a bad man and when I say bad I mean really bad. He did horrible things to women and girls. He loved vulnerable people and loved to dominate them. My mother and I were vulnerable and everyone knew it. Sometimes I wonder if that is why my mother and I were "chosen."


They lived in a small apartment building in the city. It wasn't the best neighborhood but no one was breaking in or anything.  Honestly, my father was probably the most dangerous person on the block despite his "charming" personality.

My mom always believed in co-sleeping as she never wanted me to sleep alone. This is probably because of the superstition that you should never leave a baby alone until they have teeth, because they are pure souls and something or someone... might try to take them. Also, she knew my father could not be trusted.

Anyway, this is how my mother tells the story and she has NEVER been a liar. One night, my father is out and my mother and I are sleeping in the bedroom. 

She wakes up and sees three people standing over my crib. One woman, and two men. She said they looked strange, like human but felt different. She said their clothes were ripped and old. They looked out of place in the early 2000s which is when I was born. 

 My mother grew up in a very old country one of the oldest and while she's not religious, she remembered her mother telling her, if you ever see something at night, or someone who shouldn't be there, you should pray and pretend you don't see them. My mother pretended she did not see them and prayed but she saw them and they saw her. She says she opened her eyes and they were gone. When she walked over to me, I was wide awake but quiet. I was NOT a quiet baby.

A couple weeks later, she's speaking to the landlord and some other tenants that have lived in the building for years. They landlord tells them a story about 3 people who died horrifically in the building. It was a husband, his wife and his brother. The brother lost it one day and killed his brother. He hid him in the apartment until the wife came home, drugged her, raped her and then killed her. Then he killed himself. According to the landlord, the police really did not know why the brother would do such a thing. Apparently he was a good man who just seemed to snap randomly.

No one found them for a couple weeks until someone smelt something.

 They lived right next door to the apartment that we lived in.

My mother is 100% sure that this is what happened and obviously brought it up to my father. As I said before, my father was a bad man. He was deeply disturbed. He hated women and girls. He never believed my mother. 

One day when I was 22, I asked my father about it. He looked at me with the most serious expression I've ever seen on his face and said, "I knew they were coming for me but I didn't think they'd come for you."

I asked him what the hell he meant by that but he never answered me. He just kept implying that it was his fault or that he knew somehow that they were going to be there that night.

Looking back, I’m less disturbed by the possibility that there were ghosts in the room than by the sense that my father understood why they were there. Or worse, the thought that maybe he wanted them there.

RIP to my daddy... aka the man in the dark.
