My throat grew dry as I watched the bus vanish into the distance, why had it abandoned me? I tried to shake the idea that it was purposeful, that Gary had anything to do with it but of course it had to be, why else would it blow past my stop?

  I gently lowered myself back onto the bench and attempted to make out the next coming bus, the one fiftyfive, in twenty minutes. I lifted and tapped the heel of my shoe into the concrete beneath the bench. My eyes darted around, as if I would spot the answer to the odd situation in my surroundings, instead I saw a man. He was older than me, by a hefty margin, early fifties. He stood with his back against a tree, a stained wife beater tightly clung to his obese body. He had pale white skin, long blonde hair that drooped down to his shoulders, a beard with years of crust engrained just below his drooping lips. 

  My eyes drifted, seeing something swaying in his hand, a brown bottle, the label torn away by his picking thumb, liquid sloshed around inside. He lifted the bottle to greet me, cheersing me from across the road. He had a wicked smile, something you only see in horror movies, long and filled with teeth. Drool slowly rolled down his bottom lip and hanged briefly from his chin before plopping to the dirt. I waved back by raising my hand from my lap and he turned away. As he wandered off he swigged the last of his bottle before tossing it over his shoulder, smashing against the roots of the tree.

  He had an awful limp, like a lumbering beast, at points he just dragged his bad leg behind himself, leaving a deep divot in the earth. My phone began to buzz.

  I looked at it and saw Kayden calling, I answered and brought it to my face, “Hey man, what’s up?”

  “Bus not good enough for ya?” He responded quicker than I expected.

  “No, I’m getting flown to work in my private jet.”

  I heard his warm laugh through the phone, and then a moment of brief silence, “Serious though man, where are ya? Gary ain’t much for conversation today, bored as fuck.”

  “Bus didn’t stop, gotta catch the next one.”

  “Ya missed the bus?”

  “No, the bus literally didn’t stop, it just went past me.”

  “The fuck? Hold up, gonna ask Grant.” I heard the thud of his phone landing on the bus seat and a muffled conversation in the distance. After a solid two minutes I heard the phone get noisily picked up, “He didn’t see you, which is odd because your ugly ass is hard to miss.”

  “Thanks Kayden, always a treat.”



The one fiftyfive was ten minutes late and I ended up being late for work. It didn’t matter though, I wouldn’t have gotten much done anyway, my mind was racing. I needed to work out my next step, I needed to decide if Gary was a guilty party and what to do about it. The idea of calling the police bounced around my mind, maybe this new odd comment would drum up enough suspicion and get the investigation back together. I could ambush him on the bus and get Kayden on my side, pry it out of him, threaten to tell his grandson what his old man was doing in his free time.

  Then it hit me, it may have meant nothing, just another odd comment from a man infested with them, if it meant nothing and I harassed him it would only set everything back more, Kayden may abandon our friendship. If I called the police they may stop taking me seriously, they might just throw the entire investigation out or worse think I was shifting blame.

  Kayden swung open the door to the back and I nearly dived out of my seat, I was so distracted I forgot where I was.

  “Sorry Freddy, I was knocking!” He paced up to my desk and looked down at my empty work station, “Jeez, Bev ain’t gonna be happy ‘bout this. Shuffle over, I’ll help ya get more done before she comes back in.”

  I started to cry, tears flowed down my face and I pushed my face deep into my hands, I could feel the tears pooling in my cupped palms.

  “Fred, Fred, mate, what’s wrong?” He rubbed his hand on my back and I looked at him.

  “I want my son to come home, whether he’s alive or in a fucking coffin I don’t care, I need to know.” Hearing the words escape my lips was the first time I accepted the fact that Leroy may be dead. I slammed my moist fist into the table and slung my head back, letting out a frustrated yell, “Gary the bastard.”

  Kayden narrowed his eyes and I felt his hand ball into a fist, “What the fuck did Gary do?” I felt embarrassed and paused, I didn’t know if I wanted to tell him but Kayden snapped, “Oi, Fred, what did the old prick do?”

  “Just made a weird comment, scared the fuck out of me. Told me that Leroy would be alive if he had heeded his warnings, if he found the correct message in his rambling stories.” I looked to Kayden and his face was growing red in anger so I continued, “Then he makes me lean in, beckons me like a creep and whispers that he’s the Grim Reaper. Made me feel sick.”

  Kayden turned and took a couple of steps before turning back, “What a fuckin’ shithead, actual cunt.” He ran his fingers through his hair, “Tomorrow, we give him a piece of our mind. What kind of sick fuck says that to a grieving father?”

  I let him pace around, his fury made me feel at least a little more respected. At least I was justified in feeling so panicked. “Kayden,” I got his attention and he looked at me with moist eyes, he was so angry, “do you think Gary is involved?”

  His head bobbed up and down in a slow nod and my heart sank.



Kayden and I finished as much work as we could, leaving the office door open so he could peer at the counter in case a customer came in. We devised a plan, when Kayden got on the bus we would both surround Gary, demanding answers and if anything shot up warning signs we’d stay on until his stop and hold him there until police arrived.

  I stepped off the bus to walk down the roads to head home and I saw him again. The bloated man, looking into a lone house’s wheelie bin, staring like there was something so magnificent in there that he couldn’t fathom it. Slack jawed and wide eyed before suddenly snapping out of it and slamming the lid shut, wandering off the opposite way I needed to go. I hesitantly approached the bin, wanting to know what the freak could have been so enamoured by.

  I lifted the green lid and peered inside, nothing but rotting muck and old cardboard. I heard his wet gurgled laugh from behind me, turning I saw him paused staring at me. His laugh sounded like a slow wheeze but it had joy behind it and you could hear the clots of phlegm rising up his throat between breaths. He started to cough and spat a solid mass of gunk onto the road, the ground greedily sucked up the liquids and left the jellied blob.

  “Nice.” I mumbled and waited until he started walking off again before I turned and started to jog away. When I reached my house I saw the patio, I had left it a mess, cigarette butts littered the wood, three bottles were strewn around the chair I rested in and a half eaten microwave meal laid abandoned, devoured by flies. I scooped up the mess and brought it to my bin, thinking to myself, *Leroy won’t want to see this, he won’t come back if he sees this shit!*

  I went to bed early and managed to get some sleep. I was so worn down from crying and the dreadful sleep on the patio the previous night. My night was filled with heinous dreams, most of them consisted of my entire family laughing at me for losing Leroy, calling me the same awful names my wife did on the last day. 

  Then I had one that felt so real, I was standing at the bus stop with Leroy and we stood staring ahead. I so desperately wanted to speak to him but I felt frozen in place. I tried to lift my arm and it remained attached to my side. The bus pulled up, the doors grinded open and Leroy walked aboard, finally my legs let me move so I ran in. I looked around for my son and saw him sitting where Gary’s grandson usually sits, smiling to me, his freckled cheeks so chubby and filled with life. Gary also smiled at me but his mouth was filled with teeth and malice. He reached down and grabbed something off the floor, a mighty wood splitting axe, much too heavy for his frail arms to hold. I walked towards them against my will, I tried to call for Leroy to run but my mouth wouldn’t open, I tried to wake myself up but my eyes wouldn’t close. I took the axe and raised it high above my head, staring down at my small boy, his eyes looking with interest and his head cocked to the side with curiosity. The axe split his head open, the impact didn’t even require the axe to be sharp it just brutalised his skull. A mess of blood and brains plopped into his lap and slopped down his legs. The axe was lodged deep in his torso and finally I regained control, stumbling backwards and screaming as Gary laughed so loudly it shook the bus and woke me from the nightmare.

  Sweat tumbled down my forehead and my alarm was blaring in my ear. My fingers were tense and my knuckles sore, I must have been clenching them in my sleep. I reached for my alarm and I couldn’t stop it. I slowly curled into a ball and cried softly into my folded arms, letting the gnarly beeps coming from my phone shred my psyche. *I couldn’t do that, I didn’t kill him, I didn’t,* I thought to myself as I sobbed, deep, long cries into my bed.

  I often had to remind myself I didn’t hurt Leroy, my wife accused me of it, even seeing the footage of him walking she still accused me of tracking my own son down and murdering him. *I didn’t kill him, I didn’t kill him,* “I didn’t kill him,” I began to speak it outloud, dispelling all doubt, yet some remained. It wouldn’t have been the first time someone snapped, slaughtered a loved one and then just, forget.

  I rose from the covers and trudged through my house, it was warm, all the windows shut. On the kitchen table sat my son’s handwritten note, more stained than it originally was but unmoved. 

  After I showered and got ready I started my walk to the  bus stop, tapping away at my notes app on my phone, a list of questions to ask Gary. I passed the tree the drunk behemoth leaned against and once again he was there. This time he was sitting, eyes closed and jaw left slack. He snored loudly, three bottles of beer strewn at his feet and a trail leading northwards of other drinks, a half filled whisky bottle was limply sitting in his hand.

  I sat down at the stop, clenched my fist and waited. I assumed the bus would stop, a simple error is what occurred last time, but doubt clouded my head and I started getting scared. I bounced my leg up and down and began to breathe heavily. It had to stop, it had to.

  It didn’t. The fiftyfive drove right past, Gary smiled at me and his grandson stared wide eyed out the window. It blew right by again. I clenched my phone tightly in my hand as rage, confusion and anxiety caused me to shudder in my seat. I dialed Kayden, only after two rings did he answer.

  “You on?” He spoke immediately and quickly, desperate for an answer.

  “No,” as I spoke I saw the drunk slowly rise to his feet, “it fucking drove off.”

  “No, fucking, way, I’m gonna give Gary the talkin’ to, alright?”

  “Yeah, of course.” I spoke hesitantly as the man began to wave at me, a slimy grin on his mouth.

  “Will let you know if I think he hurt Leroy, or whatever.” I could hear a slight fear trembling in Kayden’s voice, he expected me to be there with him.

  “I’ll take the next bus to the police station if anything happens, I reckon it’ll take me there.”

  The man began to approach, shouting gibberish as he closed the distance, his lame leg dragged so deeply in the dirt under his weight. Kayden responded in my ear and I couldn’t make out a word, deeply worried about the drunk. As he got closer, I noticed the grin hadn’t faded but he sounded angry, he was yelling with aggression through a genuine smile.

  “Took…took the boy…” Is the small amount I began to make out, “bus…won’t stop…the bus doesn’t fucking stop!” He bellowed, halfway across the road, so close I could smell him.

  I jumped up and started to back away, trying to speak but nothing came out but a pathetic, “Fuck off, man, please.”

  He began to laugh, a thick, disgusting, slowly drawn out laugh. He was nearly seven feet tall, his shadow swallowed me, even with the anchor slowing him down a good swing from his fists would kill me. I tucked my phone away and kept my hands free, his march onwards didn’t stop and I turned to run. 

  Effortlessly he grabbed the collar of my shirt, yanking me briefly off my feet and tossing me down onto the concrete beneath the bench, he leaned over me, drool leaving his lips. Most of the spit was caught in his beard but some slowly oozed down and splashed against me and he spoke, so softly I almost couldn’t hear him, his smile remained through it all, “The bus won’t stop for you anymore, your kid’s fucking dead, leave it alone. Don’t make a mistake, don’t make your life worse.” 

  I stared at the creature that resembled a man, his heavy skin dragged his face down, drooping towards me. His fat lips failed to hide his jagged teeth or catch the gunk that flung from his maw. I stared too long and he yelled, “You hear me?!”

  “Did you take him?!” I yelled back, my voice cracking. His only response was to laugh, he laughed so loudly it hurt my ears.

  “Fuck you,” he responded, “fuck you and your fucking kid.”

  I went to grab at him and a sudden pain shot through my spine where I had slammed into the concrete, I winced and closed my eyes. It felt awful, like I had been stabbed and I forgot for a single moment what was just happening, giving the freak time to begin dragging himself away. 

  Each time I tried to move more pain would thunder through my back and down my legs, so I just laid there, listening as the man walked away. I cocked my head and saw a frown had finally taken his face, a frown of sorrow or regret, he was miserable.

   “Freddy? You there?” I heard quietly from my pocket. I slowly withdrew my phone and put it to my ear.

  “I don’t think Gary did it,” I mumbled, “I think some drunk fucker did.”

  “Was that who was yelling, you okay?”

  “Yes and yes, I can’t move, I think he fucked my back up good.”

  I heard a soft sigh from Kayden, “Was he like, the biggest guy you’ve ever seen?”

  “Yeah, he was fucking huge.”

  “I think I broke his leg when he attacked Gary,” he paused and sucked air in, “I reckon he was trying to grab the kid with him.”

  “He knew about the bus not stopping, told me it wouldn’t stop for me ever again. Check with Gary and the driver. They might know why.”



After that I hung up the call and slowly, gently pulled myself to a sitting position, leaning my back against the pole with the bus times on it. From there I waited another couple of minutes before using it to haul myself to my feet, my back begging me to stop. I looked out for the man but all that was left was the trench that followed him. I turned to face the sign, a giant 2014 was in the corner, updated nearly ten years before I was reading it.

  The one fiftyfive arrived shortly after, scooping me up and taking me away. The seats weren’t comfortable but they were cushioned, slowly the pain in my back faded. As the shock wore away too, I realised I hadn’t called the police.

  I pulled my phone and dialed. I explained the drunken man, what he did and said. I started telling them about the bus and Gary but they seemed less interested, saying, “We already looked into him, he’s just an old weirdo.”

  They promised to send some officers over to find the man, see what he knows and arrest him for the assault if they could.

  I arrived at work late again and saw my boss Beverly waiting at my desk. She was a heavy woman, tan skin from long hours in the sun from a young age that now clung to her flesh in her older years. “Fred, Freddy, Fred,” she spoke in a sing-songy way, “why are we late every other day, bud?”

  I dipped my head low and sighed, “The bus keeps missing me, I will take an earlier one.”

  “Yes you will, and you will make sure that one stops or you’ll be looking for new work!”

  “Sorry Bev, I’ll do better.”

  She nodded a single annoying nod and grabbed a box off the floor, inside were old, dirty, faded newspapers, “These lovely little things were donated this morning, you’re going to sort them and put them NEATLY on display out front. They won’t be for sale but just a small hunk of history.”

  I took the box and she waddled away, past Kayden and out the front door. A beat passed and he swiftly moved into the back room with me, “Freddy, how’s the back?”

  I grunted in response and plopped the box down on the desk, “What’d you learn?”

  He ran his fingers through themselves and smiled nervously, “Gary don’t know nothing, I think he was just bein’ a prick the other day.”

  “How could you know that?” I snapped at him, immediately regretting it as I saw him flinch a tiny amount.

  “Cause he seemed shocked when I brought it up, saying it wasn’t meant to be malicious, that it was meant to make you more cautious but also understanding,” he paused, “or some shit like that.”

  “Shocked doesn’t mean shit, understanding what? Understanding that my kid is dead and gone, that if he was just a little bit more fucking cautious that he’d be alive?” I was yelling, tears running down my face, “What kind of fucking bullshit is that?”

  “I don’t agree with him, but I don’t think he’s involved, I think he’s just more of a bastard than we gave him credit for.” Kayden seemed so upset for me, looking at me like I was a hurt puppy, “I’m sorry Fred, but the Gary stuff is a dead end.”

  “What, what about the Grim Reaper comment?” I spat out, desperate.

  “Oh yeah,” Kayden sighed, “don’t shoot the messenger here but he said it was just a cool thing to call himself. Cause the Grim Reaper gives advice to the damned, I think.”

  I slammed my fist into the box and it tumbled to the floor, newspapers fluttered around everywhere. I groaned and started to scoop everything back up, Kayden dropped too and continued, “Oh and the bus just misses ya stop now apparently, they needa update the sign Grant said.”

  I didn’t know what to say, it was all so annoying. I thought I was on the track of my son’s kidnapper and it fell apart right in front of me. Gary was a dead end and the bus had nothing to do with it. I hoped in my heart the drunk was it, the end of the story but I was doubting myself. If I was wrong about Gary, who is to say I wouldn’t be wrong about this random giant? I shook it off and told myself that he had to have known something, he spoke too specifically and attacked me. He *had* to have been connected.

  While thinking to myself an article caught my attention, one from 2015. I bundled the mixed pages back together and brought the article to my face to read. It wasn't the front page, it was buried away on page seven, “Missing boy causes bus to close its route for good.” I read the small paragraph, a young man named Jack Angel went missing and all signs pointed to him going missing on the fiftyfive. The bus had to be retired due to complaints and was replaced by the one fiftyfive. I looked at the photo and there it was, a little cleaner and less dented, the fiftyfive I rode every single day. 

  My hands trembled as I turned it over and saw that it was a local newspaper, from a year I didn’t even live in the town, a story I never should have known, a missing child no younger than Leroy.
