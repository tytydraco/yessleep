My grandfather has always been into knickknacks and outdated trinkets, at least they seemed that way to me. For him, they were small windows into a past that most of my generation have forgotten.



He’d take me out to all manner of car boot sales, antique shops and second-hand stores on the odd weekends my parents would drop me off at his place.



In my youth I hated it, but as time has worn me down and those trips slowly faded, it was the only way I could reconnect with the memory of him.



Though I have a fondness for the objects that would have caught his eye, old toys and such, my search had always been for books.



Using them as a way to pass the time initially, soon they became the object of my meticulous scouring, developing that drive to write my own.



He always told me that those broken, worn and all together unloved pieces would have undoubtably bore witness to decades of their owners’ lives. With a little bit of elbow grease, as he put it, they could be revitalised, being useful once again.



I really liked that sentiment, though the novels seemed to speak to me on a different level. Windows into the mind of authors only remembered through their names.



It gave me some semblance of satisfaction that I could be transported to whatever world they scribed, seeing it through their eyes.



On that early Sunday morning, I’d already got my hands on two novels, eagerly raring to return home and bathe in the summer glow as I indulged in their dusty pages. However, something within, maybe my grandfathers’ words, pushed me to at least walk the full circuit, just in case.



Reaching the end of the line, my eyes fell on a small, worn metal wined-up car. It looked fairly similar to those in my office, as I never had the heart to throw away any of the things he left me.



Palming it, satisfied that those feelings had been put at ease, another item practically jumped out at me.



Laying besides the sun damaged red tub which contained the mishmash selection of toy cars, was a dark brown leather-bound book.



Entranced by the well-aged tome, I flipped it over, reading the indented title that had been meticulously calved into the slightly damp cover.



‘A life story’.



Not recognising it, or the scrawled authors name, far too small for even my glasses to magnify, I attempted to grab the attention of its seller. The heavy-set women, far too engrossed in her scrolling, waved her hand and repeated a tired phrase, pointing at the price label on the tub.



Dropping my coins, I returned home with far more choice than usual. Contemplating which of my new selection to partake in first, my gaze always seemed to fall on that book.



I don’t know what I really expected from a title like that, maybe a retrospective autobiography or comprehensive guide to living one’s life to the fullest, regardless that wasn’t what I got.



Before I’d even finished the first page, the authors writing style stumped me. Each sentence was a methodical description, even relaying the senses that the main character would have been experiencing.



Their descriptions were apt, more so from the point of view of a person removed from the situation unfolding yet present enough to be experiencing them in tandem.



However, the more concerning issue, was that each detail almost perfectly matched up to my own early childhood.



My place of birth, the hospital and exact time, all the way up to my first home and parents’ full name.



I admit, I had no solid memories of those years for obvious reasons, but the descriptions of my room and family were far too accurate.



I couldn’t read anymore, whoever’s sick idea of a joke this was must have been following me for a while, that or they got my information online.



For the next couple of days, I was incredibly cautious, checking my shoulder at every available chance, prepared to meet some shady pursuer.



Though it never happened, I did show a friend the book, partly to justify my current delusion and equally, to remedy a curiosity I had.



Libby quite rightly freaked once she read that first page, her eyes widening and brow furrowing as I watched her eyes trace each line.



Already starting my speal the moment her gaze lifted to meet mine, her first question quietened my concerns, if only for a moment, the next line that trickled from her lips, stunned me, in a mirror of her figure.



“How in the world does someone know that much about me?”



I collapsed in my preconceived jump, finding an altogether alien conclusion. Flipping the book and scanning the first couple of lines, they still detailed my early life, though according to Libby, the words on that page were directed at her.



Panicking and cutting our conversation short, I had to do some more research. Using my break to scour the internet for as much information as possible, there was nothing.



No fables of an item, no paranormal occurrences, nothing. Not even the identity of that woman was known, though I asked all the usual sellers who were active on that day.



Resigned to my fate, slumping down in my armchair that evening, a stupid, reckless idea popped into my head.



If that books author knew so much about me, to the point where even I couldn’t fully recall some of the details, then I wanted to put it to the test. Crazy I know, but how much could I really gleam from a book on my own life.



Without the aid of my parents, I’d have to dig deep and attempt to match each beat of this story, with the days I’d lived, all those yesterdays ago.  



It started out fairly tame, using some old photo albums and stories I’d been told as a kid, most of those early events seemed to match up. I’d not made any meaningful memories, so those descriptions didn’t draw out much.



That cafeteria slip dragged back a wave of embarrassment, that at the time killed me inside, though now only elicited a quiet chuckle.



My first goal for my youth team and the pizza I had after definitely hit that nostalgic ich. Back in those early years, when I wasn’t focused on my adult responsibilities, everything seemed so much more relaxed.



The more detailed the accounts became the more vivid memories I was able to claw back from oblivion.



At times I was reliving whole days of my past, the sounds smells and sights perfectly articulated on each page, some even more tangible than my own recollection.



Cool summer days in my grandparents back garden, picking blackberries for my nanna’s famous blackberry and apple crumble, rushed back. A quieter, stress free time.



Without experiencing it first hand, those feelings were intoxicating enough to keep anyone glued to the page, able to relive those high notes as if you were there.



Sadly, other visions were a miss match of emotions I was too young to process, simply mirroring the misery of my raven clad family.



Those passings hitting with a tectonic force. Across those pages they were as real and physical as the book they spilled from. Savagely ripped away, leaving as much devastation as the day I lost them.



Before long the tantalising alure of reaching back into the past relegated everything else mute.



Wrestling with the draw to skip work felt like holding up an unfathomably large boulder, though no sooner had I indulged that addictive flip of another page, my dream job no longer carried any weight.



Eight years working my way to that point did nothing for me. Even at the point of cresting that hill, finally toiling away enough to publish my own work, didn’t move me an inch from the armchair I glued myself to.



Texts, calls and even an occasional knock on my front door couldn’t break my laser like focus on the narrative I once lived.



The bare minimum was all I did. Eating once a day felt like a torture, glancing back at those perfectly pressed pages in every miniscule moment possible.



My insomnia rose its ugly head, working overtime to force me back from my periodic, unintended lapses on the lounge floor. In my heyday, most of my best work flowed during the twilight hours, finding new inspiration as my thoughts were unrestricted.



In a twisted façade of my own thoughts, all that mattered was the next line, next prefect recreation of a long since discarded day. At the time deemed nothing more than filler for my next major life event, now mulled over like that gospel text of a priest at their alter.



Before long, my phone died, I eat everything I could stomach with as little prep as possible and those knocks grew more frequent.



A voice echoed from that rotting oak door, merging with the brisk breeze, nothing more than an ambient whisper as I ploughed on through my own memories.



Ready to flip the page, my eyes hungrily devoured each word, stopping for the first time, of my own volition. Like an out of body experience, that final sentence described each and every minor detail of the forgotten room I lay in, centring on my weary body, flicking to the same page.



Before I could even process the threshold, I stood at the precipice of, voices blared and wood splintered as that biblical tome was cleaved from my saturated grip.



Amongst the chaos and commotion, that window into every conceivable moment disappeared, nothing more than breath on a mirror.



I’d have liked to say I was stable enough to live without it, not tethered so tightly, but my emaciated visage was enough for the two officers to understand. For who knows how long, I’d been overdosing on my drug of choice, nostalgia.



Being restrained in my feral state, more so for my own wellbeing, I was carted off to the hospital. Those memories were foggy, though the disgust for my own mental deterioration has left a sour taste in my mouth.



I had visitors, people worried about me, concerned with my lack of interaction, but as sad as it is to say, I missed the people I could go back to for more. Those boundless pages, still able to transport me to those quiet summer days, where they still called my name.



Given the time to recuperate, I wasn’t back to my best, though as close as I could be, however scrolling through my phone after being discharged, it was evident Libby wasn’t.



In the months I’d been glued to its pages, she’d snapped.



The pandoras box I’d opened to her had caused a major break in her psyche. With only those first couple of pages, a question had risen up, practically swallowing her whole.



It was plastered all over her room, on every available surface.



I’d have willingly taken the abuse for that ill-conceived action, but it never came. Watching her silently curled up in that corner chair, as she had through my window, finally put into prospective how far I’d been sucked into its offer.



I know it was stupid, reckless, all of the above, but I’d reached the crest of that curve.



In my time apart, I’d allowed my mind to wander, though I think that conclusion was always present, niggling in the back of my mind. What would happen if I read ahead?



Would I actively etch my future into being, or has it, like those descriptions of the past, already been set in stone.



Maybe that information will send me on another spiral, contemplating my destiny and my own sense of free will.



Those descriptions, so perfect it was as if the author saw each and every event through my eyes.



Unless I turn that page and carve those words into being, I’ll never know.



But that just it, am I prepared to become the author of my own story.
