There's nothing worse than buying a house, only to discover a wall covered in mold for some unknown reason.

Often the reason is related to a plumbing or ventilation problem, and finding the source, as well as repairs, are always expensive.

Getting rid of this mold didn't cost me much. And yet, I wish it had.

It all started a week after I bought my new house in a remote corner on the edge of town.

The owner passed away and left the house to his son, who immediately put it on the market as is. 
Desperately looking for a property in the area myself, I jumped at the chance, and in just a very short time, the house was mine.

The reason I jumped at the chance was that it was perfectly located so that I could continue to commute to work, while being closer to my daughter, whom I had custody every weekend. 

She even had her own bedroom on the ground floor, while I slept in the master bedroom on the 1st floor.

The first week, it was weird living here with all the furniture from the previous owner. 

There was that particular smell â€“ you know, the one you notice when you enter someone else's house, instantly reminding you that you're not at home.

I continued to get used to the place as the days went by, and I also took stock of an unused room to find out what I was going to do with it.

It was in this ground-floor room that I discovered the mold. 

Night was approaching and I wanted to a have a look at it before going to bed.

When I walked in, I immediately smelled the characteristic odor indicating the presence of mold.

I frowned and tried to remember if I'd smelled the same thing when I visited the house.

It seemed incredible that I missed it, and that the real estate agent had managed to hide such a strong smell.

I took several steps forward and looked at every angle.

The only wall I couldn't see in its entirety was the one in front of me, since it was entirely hidden behind a gigantic painting. 

I remembered perfectly the surprise of seeing this painting. 

The real estate agent had told me that I was under no obligation to keep it and that they could get rid of it for me. But it looked like it had been painted by the previous owner himself, judging by the paint marks on the floor and walls around it. So I thought it would be disrespectful of me.

It wasn't lacking in charm. It showed a woman of perfect beauty, blonde, with delicate pink skin, raising her hand to the hand of an unknown man at the edge of the frame.

But when I approached the frame and looked behind it, I was immediately horrified by the sight of a significant amount of black mold.

Clearly the source of the mold was coming from the floor, where it was darkest, and it was several feet up the wall.

I began emptying the room of all the cardboard it contained, so I could see if I could find any other clues on another surface.

After a while, I realized that they were all the same large, brick-shaped boxes.

They were all empty, but I could still smell an unpleasant odor in some of them.

But what really disturbed me was when I tried to lift one of them close to the wall and realized that it, and the other 2 boxes next to it, were each connected to a plastic pipe that ran into a hole in the wall.

What was in these boxes, and why were they connected to plastic pipes that went into who knows where?

I felt icy air blowing from the hole in the wall, and I gagged.

The smell of mold was particularly strong there, to the point of making me nauseous.

I was ready to call the estate agent to complain and question the sale at that point. They'd definitely been holding out on me.

But before I did, I thought I'd better have as much ammunition as possible. So I decided to continue emptying the room to see if any other areas had mold.

I emptied the whole room, and could now see the whole of the musty carpet that had been laid on the floor under the yellow light from the bulb on the ceiling.

I decided to go all out and use the UV light stick I'd bought to detect the moisture problems I'd had in my old house.

Not many people know this, but this type of light detects more than just blood and other marks on surfaces. They can also detect mold and moisture.

I turned off the room light, plunging myself into total darkness, and lit the stick in my hand.

I expected to see puddle-like marks on the walls, but what I noticed instead froze me in place.

There were marks everywhere.

But not on the walls. On the floor.

And the droplet and squirt marks I could see starting from the center toward the door were definitely not mold or moisture marks. 

In fact, they reminded me of blood spurt marks.

I frowned, focusing my attention on the center of the room where the marks were coming from.

I crouched down, and passed the light over every inch of the area.

The light from the stick was seeping into gaps. And before long, I realized that there was probably a hatch hidden underneath.

I felt around with my fingers, and finally found what looked like a handle hidden into the ground.

I pulled up, and the hatch opened.

I looked into the darkness below me, which was dimly lit by the light in my hand. 

Everything had happened so fast. It was hard to believe that just this morning I'd been quietly drinking my coffee in the kitchen next door, with no idea that this room was hiding a trapdoor in the basement of the house.

I didn't know why the trapdoor was there, or what the previous owner was hiding. But one thing was certain: the source of the mold on the wall came from there. I could smell the stench of rotting water from here.

I admit it, my curiosity got the better of me.

For years I'd seen photos on reddit of people finding traps, doors, chests and the like in their homes. And each time, I was fascinated by these discoveries. And like everyone else in the comments, all I wanted to do was find out what was behind them.

I turned the room light back on and took a picture of the hatch, thinking that I too would post the picture online and make people drool.

Don't ask me if you can see this photo. I deleted it, with the memory of what I discovered underneath it.

At that moment though, I was all excited, I was going to be able to play explorer and discover the hidden secrets of the house.

I took my cell phone and switched on the flashlight, which was much more effective than the UV light stick.

I climbed down the few steps of the wooden ladder, and when I reached the ground, I looked around with the light in my hand.

The walls were concrete and looked solid.

There was only a corridor leading to an iron door 6 or 7 feet away.

I advanced cautiously towards the door.

I pushed it open with my fingertips, and it slowly but surely opened under the simple pressure of my hand.

And that's when I discovered the most horrifying scene of my life.

In front of me was a room containing three iron cages lined up and hung horizontally from the ceiling, with a bucket under each one.

Inside each cage was, what I assumed to be, a human corpse.

Each cage barely had room for the bodies inside, so they were all lying inside, with the ceiling only inches from their faces and the rest of their bodies, unable to make any movement.

The disgusting smell and the nightmarish vision got the better of my stomach, and I threw up on the floor to my right.

Eventually I managed to pull myself together, still shaking, and look ahead again.

The bodies were still damp, and looked to be in a recent state of decomposition. I managed to recognize that all three were women. Each had long blond hair, now dull, that protruded from the cages.

Outside the cages, there was only a small table with an open notebook on it. Glancing at it quickly I could see it was filled with dates, notes and numbers.

I turned my attention back to the cages. And as I took a closer look at one of them, the sleeve of my sweater tucked under my nostrils to keep out the stench, I noticed something protruding from the ceiling into the cage.

I frowned and pointed the light of my cell phone at the area as I got closer.

There was a plastic pipe, the end of which reached right in front of her face.

And that's when I decided it was time to get the hell out of there before I called the police.

-

When I told what I'd found hidden under my house, the operator seemed to understand the magnitude of the case it was going to be, and immediately sent several police cars and ambulances.

When he asked if I could check to see if any of them still had a pulse, I saw each of the bodies flashback before my eyes, and felt chills throughout my body at the thought of going back there and touching the bodies. I obviously refused to go back down there, knowing full well that in such a state of decomposition, there was no chance that any of them would still be alive.

Help finally arrived to put an end to this nightmare.

-

I was quickly ruled out as a suspect, considering that I'd only moved in a week before, and no one could have set up such an operation in such a short space of time, let alone come forward afterwards.

So it was the former owner who was named as the prime suspect.

As he was already dead, it would be impossible to find out why he had done it, and to bring justice to these poor women.

All I could learn about him was that he was the average Joe. A kind, smiling neighbor who had lost his wife when his only son was born and had finally died of cancer at the age of 45.

I'm currently negotiating with the real estate agency to find a new place to live, but in the meantime, I'm obliged to live there.

However, I refuse to let my daughter sleep in the ground floor bedroom when she comes for the weekend.

It's not just because I want to keep her as far away from the basement as possible.

I didn't tell the police, I don't know if I did it unconsciously or if it's because of some kind of shame I can't shake, but... 
The first day my daughter slept in the house, she told me the next morning that she thought she heard screams in the silence of the night.

Of course, I had told her that it must have been her imagination.

But now, I think that it probably wasn't her imagination in the [end.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGWoodhouse/)
