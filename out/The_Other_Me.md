They say that everyone has a doppelganger, but meeting one will mean your doom. I used to believe that was just some stupid urban legend until that horrific day.

It happened after a long day of working at a crappy fast food place with an equally abysmal salary. The customers were acting belligerent as usual and the manager barked orders at all the workers like we were his slaves. I hated every second of working there, but I had to put up with it because I had bills to pay. The end of my shift couldn’t come fast enough that day. I marched out of that dump and headed to the nearest train station to return home.

I live in a major city so just about everywhere is packed with people, especially in a train station late in the afternoon. That wasn’t the case this time. The station was quiet to the point of being uncanny. There was always some ambient noise of chaotic city life blaring at all times, but at that moment, not a soul could be heard or seen.

" Where the hell is everyone?" I muttered out loud. No commuters were in sight despite this being one of the busiest times of the day. To make things even more bewildering, the entire station was immaculately clean. It was pristine to perfection. Anyone who has been to New York knows that place is practically one huge cesspool of filth, rats, and bad attitudes. This was like an entirely different world. Taking full advantage of the lack of booth workers and security guards, I hopped the turnstile and made my way to the platform.  I usually get a jolt of adrenaline from fare evading without getting caught, but that feeling was gone for obvious reasons.



Once I boarded my train after it arrived, my eyebags felt like they were made of lead. Dealing with rudeass customers all day must've really drained all my energy. It's not like I had anything better to do so I sat down and nodded off for a bit. I remember having this weird feeling before going to sleep. The train was just as barren as everything else but I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. I tried searching around for someone but the sweet embrace of sleep had me hooked.

I remember jerking up awake to the loud hum of static blaring in my ears. It was the same kind of static you would hear from a broken TV. I thought the train speakers must've been malfunctioning until I heard a strange voice come to life.


 " We are currently receiving countless reports of an unidentified hostile organism that we'll refer to as "Alternates".
Until we have a complete understanding of the threat, it's important to stay home, lock all doors and windows, and have access to a loaded firearm or any ranged weapon at all times.
You will know if an alternate exists solely based on their physical characteristics:

If you see another person that looks identical to you, run away and hide.

If you see a person that has a biologically impossible characteristic, run away and hide.

If one manages to break into your home, refrain from any kind of communication or contact with the threat.

 These intelligent lifeforms utilize elements of psychological warfare to take advantage of their victims.
While we heavily discourage any form of contact or communication with an Alternate, we make exceptions at attempts to executing them yourself."


What the hell was that? Hostile organisms? Alternates? Whatever that announcement was sounded more like a sci-fi movie plot rather than something you'd hear on the train. I almost passed it off as a prank, which would help explain why the station was so deserted, but I thought better of it. There was no way anyone could convince a bunch of New Yorkers to miss their train just for some stupid prank. This was the city where everyone was in a rush to head absolutely nowhere at any given moment. It also didn’t make sense for the MTA workers to leave their positions unattended. What exactly was going on here?

" Hello Eric."

My blood turned into ice at that moment. I heard it. I heard... my own voice call out to me. I jerked my head to the left and saw a hooded man towering over me. For a brief second I was relieved that there was finally someone else here. Then I realized that this stranger knew my name. Even more important than that, he looked just like me.

The same red hoodie.

Battered blue jeans.

Black Converse shoes.

It was the exact outfit I was wearing and though the raised hood obscured his face, I could see we shared the same looks as well. It was like staring into a mirror.

" W-Who are you?" I stammered.

No response. The man silently stood there while locking his gaze with mine. His cold, soulless eyes bore into me like he was a doll. I got up from my seat and tried distancing myself from him, but he had other plans.

" Please don't run, Eric. I miss you." 

This time it was my grandmother's voice. She was the closest thing I had to mom up until she passed away a few years ago. Hearing her voice after so long, coming from a creature like that, broke something inside me.  I began crying without even realizing it. Heavy streams of tears poured down my terrified face. 

Despite the train coming to a stop, none of the doors would open. I tried in vain to pry them open. 

" Please don't leave me. I've missed you for so long. Don't you love me? Let me love you." The creature spoke in my grandmother's voice again and it was edging closer to me. Its facial features distorted heavily with each passing second. I could see the bastard's eyes narrow and its neck elongate like it was made of rubber. It charged right at me, and with nowhere to go, I had to brace myself for a fight.

Once it tackled me to the ground, we began trading punches and kicks as we fought for our survival. It was strong, but I refused to die there. I battled against the pain and used its long neck to my advantage. It made for a major weak point, so I jammed my housekeys right into its throat, letting the blood splash everywhere.  The creature grabbed at its would and took that as an opportunity to go for the kill. I bashed that thing's head against the floor until my knees rested in a pool of blood. I felt the creature go limp in my hands, a sign of victory. 

Eventually, the train doors opened, allowing me to haul it out of there. Once I got out of the station the familiar sounds of the city back to me. The streets were littered with crowds of people walking in every direction as  impatient drivers burned rubber on the asphalt. The city had returned back to its normal self. I caught a glimpse of myself in a store window and saw that all of my wounds were gone. There wasn’t even any blood on my clothes.

To this day, I haven't told anyone about what happened in that train station. I like to pretend it never happened even though it still haunts me. I've heard internet legends of people who supposedly slipped into alternate realities. These realities allegedly mirror ours but have enough differences to create an uncanny effect. I don't know what triggered my trip to that other world and I'm not sure I want to find out. Riding the train doesn't feel the same anymore. There's always this unsettling feeling in the back of my mind that I'll slip into that other world again. I don't know what I'll do if I have to meet another doppelganger.
