The night was so black, so hollow, I wondered if there would even be a tomorrow. Stupid thought, and yet… Sitting there, at the foot of the porch, cigarette in hand, I stared at the sky as if its emptiness could offer me answers. For a long time now, I’ve been asking myself questions—about existence, meaning, the usual bullshit. Thoughts that do nothing but rob me of sleep. For example: If my actions define me, if my motivations are so important, then why does reality feel so far removed from who I think I am?

I am what I am. And yet, when I see how others perceive me, it feels like everything I believe about myself is a lie. The gap between the me I’ve constructed and the me that looks back at me in the mirror is too wide, too unnatural.

I don’t remember who said it, but supposedly, *“the other is the origin of the self.”* If that’s true, I’m screwed. Nothing makes sense. I’m just a character in a game, controlled by some unseen user with intentions I’ll never understand. He makes me act like a fool, pushes me to say things I don’t want to, don’t mean. There, hidden in the dark, he watches me smoke, biding his time, waiting for the moment he’ll seize control again. He observes me, and no matter how hard I try, I don’t understand him. His smile is cryptic, his tears are staged, his laughter is deafening. Everything about him feels fake. I hate him as much as he must hate me. He has never left me, and he never will.

A long time ago, I tried to kill him. I thought I succeeded. Imagine my surprise when I saw him the next day—in the reflection of a window. I had wounded him, but he couldn't die, no matter how many times I tried. In my dreams, he haunts me, he takes his revenge, and there’s nothing I can do. When I wake, he’s still there. I thought I could control him, but when I least expect it, he takes over, then leaves me to deal with the aftermath.

Tonight, he’s mocking me again, reveling in my despair. Another battle lost in an endless war. But I have one more plan. Tonight, I’m going to kill him again.

I stand up, flick my cigarette into the void, light another one, and take a long drag before meeting his gaze. His expression shifts. He’s not laughing anymore. His eyes look… sad. I don’t care.

Without warning, I lunge at him, both hands wrapping around his throat. I squeeze with everything I have, cigarette still burning between my lips. I have never hated anything more in my life. My nails dig into his flesh, ashes falling onto his cheek. Time bends, distorts, liquefies around us. The silence is so deep, I can hear his heart pounding. His cries are pathetic, his agony only fuels my rage. When he falls to his knees, I don’t stop. My mind is gone. My body acts on something raw, something primal.

And then… he stops moving. His weight collapses against the ground. This time, he didn’t fight back.

I finish my cigarette, watching his still-warm body. My hands are trembling. I have rarely seen him wear such an expression before. It usually means I’m in for a bad night. He will return my violence a hundredfold. But if it ever changed anything, I wouldn’t keep doing it.

Tonight, I will sleep late. Maybe, if I’m lucky, exhaustion will keep the nightmares away.

Of course, I wasn’t getting off that easy.

As soon as I fell asleep, my mind dragged me into a cold, concrete corridor. There were screams, wails echoing through the void. I walked forward against my will, drawn toward a door blacker than the night itself. I could feel dread slithering through my veins like a serpent. I didn’t want to be here. I wanted to run. But my body refused to obey.

After only a few steps, I reached the door. For a moment, I thought I might reclaim control—but my right hand moved on its own, twisting the handle.

A red-lit room unfolded before me. In its center, a creature wailed, chained to the floor. It seemed… unable to harm me. It took me several minutes to realize I could move freely again.

Any sane person would have run. But I didn’t.

Instead, something in my chest tightened, an unfamiliar weight pressing down on me. Every time I looked at the creature, I felt a sting in my heart. A faint, aching pull that kept me rooted in place.

The thing whimpered softly, as if it had only just realized I was there—even though it had no eyes to see me. I wasn’t sure it had ever been human. Its skin was ashen, like melted burial cloth. It had a head, but no neck, no chin, no nose. A torso, but no arms, no legs. A mouth with plump, red lips on a body that was eerily smooth. Its empty sockets stared at me. Chains pierced its flesh, binding it to the floor. Why restrain something that was already incapable of moving?

I stood there, paralyzed, breath unsteady.

Then, without warning, spotlights flooded the room, illuminating the creature. It fell silent. The air between us grew unbearably still.

And then… it took a breath.

And it began to sing.

I had never heard anything so haunting, so laced with agony. Every note cut through me, burrowing into my bones. The melody reached into the core of my soul, as if it knew *exactly* how to break me. Tears slid from its empty sockets—and, to my horror, I found myself crying too.

I felt lost. More lost than ever before. Overwhelmed by emotions I couldn’t even begin to name.

Was this what we were? Just two broken things, paralyzed by fear and pain?

When the song ended with a final, shuddering sigh, rage surged back into me.

Another trick. Another lie. More feelings I never asked for, forced upon me like a curse.

The injustice of it all consumed me. I had never wanted this. Never wanted *any* of this.

This thing needed to die.

I reached into my pocket and felt something cold, heavy.

A blade. No handle. Just sharpened steel, honed over years of hate.

I moved without hesitation.

I plunged the knife into its flesh. Again. Again. Again.

The sound of steel piercing flesh was sickening, but I didn’t stop. Each strike was more violent than the last.

When it finally went still, I stepped back, staring at my work—a mutilated, bleeding mass.

The lights flickered.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

When my vision adjusted, my stomach dropped.

It wasn’t the creature’s body lying before me.

It was mine.

Its vacant eyes stared at me, lifeless.

Then, pain—searing, violent—tore through my chest. I collapsed. My breath choked in my throat.

And then—*it* moved.

My corpse stood up.

It reached for me, its hands wrapping around my neck.

It spoke.

But I heard nothing.

Darkness consumed me.

# Morning

I jolted awake, gasping for air. My throat still felt the ghost of its grip. My heart pounded in my skull.

Before I could recover, a hand touched my arm.

I turned—and locked eyes with myself.

His face twisted, riddled with something unreadable. Hate. Grief. Love?

I couldn’t tell.

But when he pulled me into an embrace, I broke.

I sobbed.

I had spent my entire life hating myself, never once stopping to see myself.

Had I ever wanted peace between the me that guided my steps and the me I never learned to love?

Or had I always been too consumed by my own misery to even consider it?

My fingers brushed against his cheek, a tenderness I had never known toward myself.

But before I could speak, he crumbled—disintegrating into ash.

Whatever love I had grasped, whatever fleeting warmth, vanished with him.

I was alone.

The pain was unbearable.

I climbed out of bed and walked to the window. Morning had long since arrived. My reflection smirked.

I had no doubt now.

*He hates me.*

The cycle would never end.

As if in a trance, I made my way to the kitchen, retrieved a knife, and stood before the mirror.

I raised the blade to my throat.

Was this how it was meant to end?

My hands shook. My eyes met mine.

I waited for an answer.

But nothing came.

Nothing… except a melody.

The creature’s song.

I lowered the knife.

My reflection parted its lips.

*"Maybe it’s time to change."*
