He sat there, perched atop the curtain rod of my shower head cocked downwards, watching me. As I sat in the tub naked with water falling over me, I wanted to scream. I wanted to weep; I wanted to fold into a ball and crumble. But under his watchful gaze I found every scream pummeled into a whisper, every cry choked into muffled sobs, and every attempt to cover my face thwarted.

As steam curled around my skin and rose to the ceiling, I turned my gaze towards him, as I often did, and found the same haunting figure I had seen for months. His face poked out over the top of the shower curtain, angled down towards me. It was odd as always. Where eyes should be sat only sunken holes. Where a mouth should’ve been was a flat bare surface. He was covered in something that seemed like skin at a glance, but upon further inspection seemed to be nothing like skin at all. All that made a face recognizable was absent and yet his gaze was unmistakable.

I wasn’t quite sure how I knew he was a man. There were certainly no characteristics about him that would lead me to believe he was. And yet, in my inner being I knew that this was not the presence of a woman. It was unmistakably malicious, condescending, evil; in a way that only man can be. There was no warmth to be felt from him, no love, no joy. He was cold, unflinching, and hollow. I didn’t get the sense that he enjoyed the agony he inflicted upon me. I felt as though it was simply what he did; or rather perhaps what he was made to do.

His face wasn’t the only thing about him that I found strange. His fingers sat just below his chin, wrapped in a queer way around the curtain rod. They folded and bent at impossible angles with joints in the wrong places and edges where there should be none.

I had once dared to peer behind the shower curtain at his body and found it to be much the same. His shoulders twisted and contorted into geometrically unthinkable positions. His knees were a mess of twists and corners. His feet were contorted into shapes I couldn’t describe if I wanted to. He was a towering figure of at least 7 or 8 feet, and yet his weight never seemed to crush the thin metal rod he leaned against.

Nothing about this horror made sense to me, and yet everything did. He had arrived one day, quietly, and without a word. I hadn’t questioned it. His presence made sense. He had arrived when I was at my lowest, like a shark chasing blood in the water. I didn’t know why he was there, I didn’t know what he wanted, but I never dared to suggest to myself that he didn’t belong. To suggest he had no place here would be no different than suggesting that a fox has no place in the forest, and an eagle no place in the air. He belonged here, though I wanted him not. He remained here, though I desperately wished he would leave.

I sensed no greed or desire in him, and yet I knew that slowly, ever so slowly, he consumed me. He did not speak a word to me. The only noise I could ever hear was the hiss of steam and the draining of water. He simply fed. I could feel my strength wane day to day as I sat in that shower staring up at him. I slept less; I was disgusted by foods I had once loved. Music lost its beauty and color its vividity. I no longer laughed, I no longer cried, I simply was. All of the beauty of life was replaced with dread.

I could sense my death coming, spurred on by this stranger in my bathroom. At times I would even tell others of its coming, begging for them to see him with me; pleading with them to believe in the horror that had so tightly gripped me. But perhaps he followed me in the daytime, leaving his perch on my shower rod to follow me. Perhaps he changed my words as they flowed from my tongue. Perhaps he warped my cries for help into platitudes and small talk. I begged and I begged in desperation for someone to help free me of this monster, yet it seemed my pleading fell on unconcerned ears. So, to death I resigned myself, and every day to the shower would I go.

He stands at his perch even now, silent as ever, watching as the water pours over me. I don’t know if my mind will go first or my body. I cannot take his glare any longer, but I haven’t the strength to move. I’m sure one day someone will find me, will look upon my body. Perhaps it will be fresh. Perhaps I will be rotting, consumed by the maggots. Perhaps I will be nothing but bone. Whatever the case may be, I pray that when they find me, when they look upon me, that their gaze is kinder than his.
