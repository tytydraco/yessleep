I don’t remember much of my childhood (nothing before the age of 12 really). 

All that I can manage to recall is the daycare I went to at the time and the fact that my parents were still together, but recently, after moving back into the house I grew up in, memories have started to resurface, and I’m starting to get worried.

When I walked into my bedroom for the first time in what felt like decades, the space seemed so distant, so foreign. The only thing that truly felt familiar was this thin book I found lying on my bed.

It was titled:

"Piper the Exterminator"

Piper was this old, very niche kids' book series that followed a lady exterminator named Piper and her adventures where she saves kids from nasty infestations like ants and even mold. The plot was always simple like that with each edition showcasing a different infestation.

I would have never remembered its existence if I hadn’t found it lying on top of my old comforter. 

For nostalgia purposes, I decided to sit down and thumb my way through the book’s pages. Hoping to re-spark the child-like fascinations I once had when reading the series.

But what I read was nothing like what I remembered.

Before I keep rambling, I wanted to give you a chance to read the book for yourself. Not just because I wanted to share the awful taste it left in my mouth or to provide a reason for my current distress, but because maybe one of you remembers the book too.

This is "Piper the Exterminator"

. . .

There once was a little girl who lived all alone in a big, beautiful home. 

She had been there her entire life.

The mother and the father lived right next to her a few roads down. 

They made sure to visit their daughter frequently.

On her first day alone, the father decided to visit. 

He would help take care of her.

On the day after that, the little girl would then be visited by the mother. 

She would then take care of her little girl too.

On the third day, there were no visitors.

It repeated like this for years and years.

Until one day, a knock awakened the little girl.

She was, of course, a bit confused. 

It was a day where no one should be visiting.

“Who could it be?” She questioned.

As she walked downstairs, she carefully approached the door and put her eye up to the peephole to see.

“Who could this possibly be?”

An unfamiliar woman was standing on the other side. 

She smiled expectantly, waiting to be let in.

The little girl opened the door.

And there, the strange lady stood. 

Her tall shadow engulfed her and the warm smile the woman wore melted its way into the little girl's heart.

"Hello, sweetie!”

“Are your parents home?" Asked the lady.

The little girl shook her head. 

Her voice squeaked a bit as she began to speak.

"N-no. I live here by myself."

The woman's eyes widened. 

A corner of her lips twitched.

"Oh no!” she gasped.

“How could a little girl like you live here all by yourself?”

When the little girl didn't respond, the stranger asked:

“Where are your parents?”

The little girl shrugged her shoulders, and the woman went silent.

For a moment, a wave of disdain washed across her face. 

All except for that smile of hers. 

It still remained.

"But they come by to visit you every day right?" 

The girl nodded.

"Every day but today?"

The woman's eyes seemed to light up as they locked on to the little girl. 

"Well then,"

A sharp crack echoed as the woman twisted her neck, successfully popping tension. 

She then pulled out a business card from her shirt pocket and handed it to the little girl. 

"Here, take this."

The little girl looked closely at the white words sprawled out on the black matted card that had just been handed to her.

It read:

'Piper the Exterminator'

"What do I do with this?" She asked as she glossed her eyes over the phone number on the back.

"Have you ever seen something in your house? Ever seen a spider crawl across your hand as you lay in bed, or see a cockroach scatter into a crack in your wall?”

The little girl looked at her doe-eyed. 

She slowly bobbed her head forward.

“That's a little scary, isn't it? To know a pesky bug is inside your home, but you have no clue where it came from, where it went, what it wants?”

“Like when you hear the sound of rat feet rummaging around in the kitchen. Where did it come from? Where will it go?”

“How do I keep it from coming back?"

Piper motions towards the business card.

"That's when you call me.”

“I keep things from coming back." 

Her smile widens.

The lady took a long breath in and as she exhaled, a low whistle rang from her nose.

"Now, you enjoy the rest of your beautiful day little one."

With that, the woman left.

The next day, the little girl woke up to the sound of knocking once again. 

Though this time it was the father.

When she peaked through the peephole, she gleamed with excitement to once again see the father who she loved dearly.

She opened the door as fast as she could. 

But, before she could even say a word.

The father struck the little girl's face, instantly causing her left eye to swell. 

Its force propelled her backward onto the cold, rough floor.

She smiled dearly as her eyes fluttered closed.

Then, she drifted off to blissful sleep.

. . . 

I also wanted to note that on the inside of the back cover, there was an ad for the next book in the series titled:

“Piper the Exterminator: Arach-no-moria!”

So, like any sensible 20-something-year-old, I immediately went to the internet for answers. First, I looked up “Piper the Exterminator.” I tried to find any explanation or reference to Piper, but there was nothing.

All I found was information regarding The Pied Piper and Terminator. Which respectfully, are great stories on their own, but not the ones I was looking for. Though, after reading the book, It seems like the pied piper might have some sort of connection.

And after reading that I’m not sure I want to try and find the next book, or look any deeper into it at all. Every time I do, I start to get these terrible migraines that make it incredibly hard to focus. It kinda feels as if my mind is actively trying to block out whatever the hell this book series is and whatever impact it had on my childhood.

If I do end up finding the next book (or if someone else does before me please send it my way!), I’ll post it here for you all to see.

Please let me know if you have any information or questions about the book or any of this.

And for those of you who remember Piper, please contact me personally.
