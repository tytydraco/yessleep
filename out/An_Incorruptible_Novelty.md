To Be Viewed by Authorized Agents Only/ Discovered on April 4, 2023

My name is Raleigh Partain. I am 22 years old. My address is 324 Forlane Ct. I’m writing this document to explain what happened to me and hoping that this testament is found by the grace of God so as to bring relief to my family. I am a prisoner, but I do not know the name of my captor. I rarely see him, and I am constantly drugged. I can only describe him as an average white male, maybe 5’8” with short brown hair and blue eyes. There are no outstanding features or tattoos I know of that would be recognizable to the public, except that he has a mole under his left eye. Most disturbing though is his occupation. He is a paramedic. I wish that I had gotten his name when I had the chance, but who thinks of these things. I have accepted that I am not escaping alive, but I shudder at the thought that this man is free to pursue more victims. I write this in hopes that he is captured before he causes anymore harm and to help secure justice for the families of his victims. It will be a miracle if this note is found, but a miracle is all I can hope for now. 

I’m enrolled in Avalon College majoring in Chemistry. I don’t live on campus but commute about 23 miles from home. I’m still living with my parents, but after this semester I had planned on moving out of the house. I need about 34 hours to graduate. I had met my girlfriend Lisa in freshman English, and we were ready to take the next step. She was close to graduating herself. It’s her I think about the most while I waste away in the darkness. I daydream about the apartment we would have rented and the weekends we would have spent on the lake. 

One Friday we were leaving campus. I want to say it was the 23rd of October. She usually would just ride with me, but her SUV was acting up and she was going to drop it off with a mechanic that was a family friend. I was following her in my car. There was a cold misty rain ponding on the road. We were merging onto the interstate from the on ramp. As Lisa started to move into the nearest lane a car barely missed her, and I could hear the muffled blast of angry honking. She jerked the SUV back to the right, hydroplaned, with the left side of the car lifting up into the air and then tumbled onto the roof. The vehicle slid on its roof and into the shoulder of the road crashing into the guard rail.  

I pulled off to the side of the road behind her vehicle. I jumped out of my car and ran to the side of her window. When I bent down, I was shocked to see her sitting on the roof with her back to me. It just struck me as odd that she wasn’t thrown out of the windshield. I could hear her crying. 

“Bunny, are you alright?” That’s what I called her. Bunny, yeah, I know. 

With her legs she scooted around to face me. She was holding her right arm and I could see that her wrist or something was broken. Her hand was dangling in an unnatural position. There was no rigidity to it. It looked as if you could have easily pushed the palm of her hand to her forearm. There was a deep gash across her forehead and right eye. I was about to vomit but I had to pull it together for her. 

“No, I’m not alright.”

“Hey, is everything ok. Do you need me to call 911?” I heard someone yell from behind me. 

“Yes, please. I haven’t called. Bunny, can you come on out? I’ll help you.”

“I’m so sorry.” She started to say as she was sobbing. 

I kind of chuckled. “What are you apologizing for?”

“I almost hit that woman. It was my fault.”

“Bunny, that wasn’t your fault. I saw the whole thing. Every bit of it. That woman was an asshole. You were nowhere near hitting her. It’s her fault. She scared you and made you react.” 

Really it was her fault. That woman did a good job avoiding a collision, but I didn’t need my girlfriend worrying about any additional bullshit. With slow and methodical precision, I got her out through the shards of glass and broken window. I gave her my jacket and started to walk her back to my car. The man that had called 911 came over and gave her his jacket to stop the bleeding from her forehead. 

“Oh no, I don’t want to ruin your jacket.” 

“Don’t worry about it ma’am. I can always get another jacket.”

I told the man thank you. I noticed that another car had pulled over and I waved at that guy to let him know that everything was alright. I put Lisa in the passenger side, started the car and cranked up the heater so she would be warm. 

“Well, I guess I gave the mechanic a little more work to do.” We laughed, but she writhed in pain as she did so. Finally, we heard the sirens approaching. It was a fire engine and an ambulance. I got out of the car and waved them over to Lisa. The paramedics came over to check on her and did their thing. They bandaged up her head, but they didn’t do anything with her wrist. They put her on a stretcher and wheeled her to the ambulance. I was following behind when she motioned to me. 

“Could you grab my purse?”

“Sure. What hospital are you guys taking her to?”

‘St. Vincent.”

“Ok. Thanks!”

As I was walking back to Lisa’s vehicle, I saw a paramedic picking up a necklace from the ground and putting it into his pocket. I was sure it was the necklace I had bought Lisa last year for her birthday.

“Hey, what in the hell are you doing! Give me that necklace.”

“Oh yeah sure. I was bringing it to her.”

He took the necklace out of his pocket, spilling other valuables to the ground. 

“Are you fucking kidding me! Get out of here. I’m going to report you. Lousy son of a bitch!

“I wasn’t stealing anything. I was gathering all her stuff together.”

“You could have just brought her purse with everything in it.”

He walked off without saying anything else. In addition to her necklace, I picked up a ring and her flash drive. I went and grabbed her purse and some other items. I put everything in the purse. I stood up only to see that same paramedic behind my car, writing on a pad of paper. He was writing down my license plate number. I thought that was odd. I was now jogging towards him, but he jumped into the back of the ambulance before I could catch him. I thought well I won’t make a big deal out of it. I was trying to do better. I have been accused of exaggerating things and maybe I was doing the same in this situation. I don’t know. I just wanted to get to the hospital and be with Lisa. 

I stayed the whole night with her, sleeping on the chair next to her bed. She had some major injuries, but nothing that was going to be permanent- a limp wrist and some stitches in her head. I was worried about her, yet I felt a little guilty because I was more worried about that paramedic. Why was he looking at my license plate and worse, writing it down?

The next morning, I went home and took a shower. I was exhausted. I didn’t sleep too well in that hospital chair, but I was still too agitated to go to sleep, so took a shot of cold medicine and drank a six pack. I went to my bedroom window and looked outside at the sunrise. It was a picture-perfect setting, with orange, pink, and purple splashed up against a blue background. I noticed a red truck with a camper over the bed. I had never seen that truck before, and I was sure it was not any of my neighbor’s. I could see on the back window a medical type of sticker, that signifies that whoever owned the truck worked in the medical industry. I heard a shuffle and caught a glimpse of a person’s reflection in the window, but not before I could turn around. I felt a sharp point in my neck, and I could see in the window that behind me was that paramedic and he had just shoved a syringe into my neck. My legs went limp, and I slumped to the ground and lost consciousness. 

I woke up in a wheelchair with my legs and arms handcuffed together. I was in a room with shelving units full of glass jars. There were also glass display cases. There were a variety of trinkets and novelties. Most had jewelry but some were a little more macabre. I noticed a finger in one, a toe in another. There was a particularly large jar with a heart in it. Each jar had a label attached with a name, date, and a small description. I only knew this because my wheelchair was close to a shelf that had a collection of rings. One display had a finger with a golden ring on it. The label attached to it read:

Carl Harrison, 10/2/2002, Wife cut off finger after finding out he cheated. Wedding band included.

“Welcome to my collection. It’s beautiful isn’t it. I’ve taken something from every call I’ve ever been on.”

“Why do you have me here? Please let me go…. I”

He interrupted me before I could say anything else. “You know this is my most ambitious project yet. I was just going to take the necklace and a few other items. There was not much to this call. Not a lot of gore or mess…. No story behind the trinkets, or at least not a good one, but then I thought this is my chance to try something I’ve always thought of. I wasn’t ready to try it just yet, but you pissed me off. I’m going to make you an incorruptible. Have you ever heard of that? No, I doubt you have. In Catholicism there are supposed saints that have died, but their bodies have not decayed. I think its bullshit, but I like the idea of having an incorruptible body in my collection. It's no miracle. You just got to have the appropriate conditions. It can’t be that hard. Stalin under the Soviet Union did it to Lenin and now I’m going to do it to you.”

He pushed me around his collection of jewelry and body parts. He made me listen to the stories about each of his calls and what they meant to him spiritually and why he decided to take what he took. There was an art to it. There was nothing random about it. Each item he collected was the most significant symbol he could use to represent that particular instance of human suffering. It took about an hour. It was an extensive collection. I admit I was amazed and horrified by his creativity. 

“But you, yes you, are going to be my most prized possession. You represent, or should I say will represent the frozen aspirations of a life that never will be. A living statue frozen in time. A novelty representing more than one moment, but an entire wasted life.”

After the tour he wheeled me into a room with a mattress and a bucket. He turned to walk out the room and gave me the most heartfelt look I had ever seen. From that stare, I knew he loved me, not as a person, but as a thing, a possession to be worked on and manipulated. 

“Go to sleep. I will be back later to knock you out and take you out of that uncomfortable chair.”

He turned out the light and walked out the door. I could hear the dead-bolt snap into place. 

He feeds me once a day, but it’s a very low-calorie diet consisting of nothing but chicken broth. He wants me skinnier than I am. He has shaved off all of my body hair. I know that my end is approaching. I don’t know how he is going to do it, but I know I can’t escape. He never lets me out. Sometimes he brings in a gurney, knocks me out with a concoction of drugs fed through an intravenous line. He’s doing something when I’m under. I’m slowly becoming something other than alive. I’m becoming incorruptible.
