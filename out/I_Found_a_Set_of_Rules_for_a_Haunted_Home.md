I couldn’t believe my luck when I found a two-story, two-bedroom house for sale for almost half of its market value. I prepared myself to face the worst on the way to my hastily booked viewing, I imagined leaky floors hidden under carefully placed rugs, a horrible stench on a certain time of day that you can’t seem to remove no matter what, a crime ridden neighborhood not shown in the advertisement photos, or frequent pest infestations due to the house’s location. To my surprise, none of these are the reason why the house is being sold for a huge discount.

It was after the tour of the house that the realtor told me the previous owners have died in it and the living relatives just wanted to sell the house as fast as they can. I felt bad about leaping in like a greedy vulture to benefit from others’ misery, but no one can let this one go right? Ignoring this deal in this market is insanity. I was about to tell the realtor that I would love to make the purchase when her phone rang, it seemed important, so she gave me some time to explore the house on my own while she went out front to take the call.

I decided to go back to one of the bedrooms with a large ornate mirror hanging on the wall. I thought about how I’m going to get rid of the clearly out of place mirror, how heavy it’s going to be, and how I’m going to dispose of it without hurting the garbage collectors. That’s when I noticed a piece of paper sticking out from behind the mirror. It was a note that read:

**I write these rules to whoever will live in this house next. If you follow these rules, then there might be hope that you can make it out here.  Good luck or God bless, you are going to need both of it.**

1.    At exactly 5:00 PM, go to your room and do anything to make yourself busy or at least look like it. You’ll know it’s five from the foul smell at the front door will fill up the house. Then you’ll hear stomping and metal clanking roaming around the house, something will open your bedroom door. DO NOT look at whatever it is, just continue with what you’re doing.

2.    DO NOT lock any doors. You might get the idea of locking the doors to keep the stench from entering the house or your room. Don’t, it’s a bad idea. You’ll just make The Stench angry, and you’ll end up hurt. Badly.   

3.    DO NOT use the kitchen between 6:00 – 8:00 AM, 11:00 AM – 12:00NN, and 5:00 – 6:00 PM. You will hear singing and smell something good cooking during these times. No matter what, do not enter the kitchen. If you see food, don’t touch it, none of it is for you.

4.    DO NOT leave anything in the living room. I mean anything, not even a skid mark or dirt from your shoes. It would be better to not step on the living room ever but if you must, make sure you do not leave anything behind.

5.    DO NOT make any loud noises, especially at night to early morning from 8:00 PM – 5:00 AM. Examples of loud noises are watching the TV, listening to music, walking, arranging stuff, and closing doors or windows.  

6.    DO NOT talk about the rules outside of the house. Not even a phone call, a post, or anything that could tip people off that something is happening.

7.    There are times at night, when you are sleeping, The Stench will enter your room, no matter what it does, don’t make a sound. Pretend that you’re asleep.

8.    Always come home before 4:30 PM. You can’t escape this by not coming back or running away. Each time you try to run, things will get worse and worse.

I finished reading the list when I noticed something fell from behind the mirror. Polaroid photos of what looks like a teenage girl. Nine photos in total showing bruises, wounds, broken bones, and what appears to be skin from her back flaking off like paint. I dropped the note on top of the photos as if it’s heavier than it is. I thought about how this must be some kind of prank done to scare away other potential buyers by someone who is also interested in the house. I felt dizzy so I sat on the bed. After a few breaths, I took my phone out to research the house, something that I should’ve done before coming here. What I saw made my heart sank, a news headline that said, “Abuse led to Murder-Suicide by a Teenage Girl” and showed the picture of the same girl in the polaroid photos. The article talked about the girl's injuries suffered from abuse at the hands of her own parents. Descriptions of the injuries that matched the photos on the floor. My body tensed, I felt dizzy and speechless having seen proof of the suffering someone so young had to live through. I left the house thinking how never in my life had I believed so much in the existence of monsters.
