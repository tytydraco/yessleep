Hi my name is Kaitlyn (27f) and I'm in dire need right now. I really need some advice guys because at this point I'm at my wits end! But before you understand, I guess I'll have to tell you a story.

I had a pretty traumatic upbringing. I will not go into details about it today, but I do think that plays a part as to why I'm so "sensitive", or why I'm batshit crazy. I can't make up my mind on which I am, but I guess it depends on your own beliefs.

Ever since I can remember, I have seen and heard things that others don't. The WAY I see things is weird as well. Have you ever put your hand a few inches away from your face to look "through" it? That's how these things show up. An image on an image. Anyway....

It has been nine years since my step-dad, aunt, and my little brothers (Jon and Jackson) decided to move a few towns away, and after they settled in they invited me and my close friend to stay with them for a weekend. Friday was great! My friend and I spent the entire day looking around the huge farmhouse and playing with all the animals in the barn.  That night we stayed up late watching movies like usual until we passed out together in the living room. I had bad nightmares, but that's normal for me.

Saturday during the day my friend and I were sitting and talking. We thought it would be really cool to go to the barn and record ourselves talking to spirits. We get dressed, I turn the recorder on my phone and we walk to the barn. 

Once we get in I asked tons of questions. I gave a bout a minute in between each question just like those ghost shows do. I went upstairs to ask more questions, but Mel decided she would rather stay with the horses. That was fine.

I go up, ask the same questions I asked earlier, then come back down. This was all very boring. Once I get down, I just kinda wander the barn some more. I looked down, and saw two tiny but different hand prints. Suddenly I had a terrible feeling in my stomach. So of course I asked more questions!

When I finally calmed down I realized that Mel wasn't in the barn with me. I left the barn to look for her. The yard was a big open space with one fenced in pasture. Across the road was a cornfield. Mel scared easily though. There was no way she could be in there. I ran around the outside of the house. No. I checked with everyone in the house. They didn't see her either. As a last ditch effort, I checked the barn again. There she was petting the horse again!

I was furious. "Where the hell did you go?!" I demanded.

She gave me a confused look. "Um, here? I've been petting Chip."

"I've been looking everywhere for you. You definitely weren't here earlier." I said this a lot more calmly. I was just glad I found her. Maybe she was playing some prank on me but whatever. I decided to let it go and asked if she wanted to go listen to the recording.

We went into the guest room and started replaying my phone recording. I listen to myself ask two or three questions. Nothing answers. Then the recording goes completely silent. 20 minutes of not a word. Not even my own voice.

Then I hear it again. "What happened to these little girls?" My voice asks.

"Sshhhsshh's boys" is the response.

The whole thing was weird. How could my phone be running for that long and not even pick up my own voice? I held it the whole time! What was the name the other voice tried to say? Why was Mel impossible to find? The combination had us both a little freaked out, but we kept it to ourselves.

I don't remember the rest of the day. But that night we watched more movies. This time in the guest room. We go out to the living room in the middle of the night to get some snacks.

THUMP. THUMP! THUMP.

We both jumped. It sounded like something heavy was being dragged down the stairs. Of course there was nothing there when I checked. We kept the snacks in our hands and ran into the guest room.

We watched another movie trying to forget about the day. But then we heard voices over the tv. I paused it to listen. Maybe my brothers are trying to be sneaky or maybe we accidentally woke my aunt and step dad up.

The voices don't sound familiar. They're definitely children, but they're boys AND girls. As one, they chant "get out, go away, get out, go away.". It started calm, getting louder and louder until they were shrieking.

So, I know for a fact that my step dad is terrified of "scary" stuff. I turned on a horror movie with him once and he hid under the blanket and yelled until I turned it off. There are no little girls here. We were too scared to sleep and too scared to investigate. At least it was our last night. 

The next morning is Sunday. We will finally be able to go home! We spent the morning throwing around the football with Jon and Jackson. We played for about an hour before we all go in for a little bit. We walked up to the porch, the boys in front of me and Mel. I know I asked them something, but I can't remember what. They turned around to answer me.

Then they stopped. They both had faraway stares and just...stood there. Okay, so something obviously got their attention. I turned around. 

There was a girl right at the edge of the road in front of the cornfield. She had long black hair, ripped up clothes. And she just stood there staring at us. I looked back at my brothers to tell them to go inside, but the words died in my mouth. They both started walking towards her!

I looked at her again. She was now in the middle of the cornfield jumping up and down. I yelled at Jon. Shook him. Slapped him. No effect. Mel stared at us in shocked horror. I asked her to grab Jackson, and we drug the boys inside by their arms. Thankfully once they were inside, they were back to normal. But they didnt remember anything that happened. Then I found my aunt and told her all of the weird shit that had been happening. I think she dismissed the rest as kids being kids, but she did have us all pile into the car to see if we could find the girl. We drove around nearby dirt roads for an hour before she decided to take me and my friend home. 

I asked Mel later if she had ever seen the girl. She said no, but she was very freaked out about the boys' behavior. So we said we would never go back and we tried to forget about it. Two weeks later, I started noticing something following me. All I could ever see was a face. The rest of his....sorry ITS body was always hidden behind something and it was all very far away.

I'm sorry, but I am starting to get weak again. I need to forget about him for a while. But as soon as I have the energy I will tell you the rest. He has been a problem for too long. I can't take it anymore. I just pray that when I am finished someone can offer me help. And I pray that if I can't make it, at least I can help one of you.
