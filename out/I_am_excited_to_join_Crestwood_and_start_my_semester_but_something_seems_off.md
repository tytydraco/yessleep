Freshman year of college and the excitement to start a new chapter of my life has also been that of anticipation as meeting new people in a whole new place while also working towards studying for my dream career has finally placed me in front of this pinboard which has the list for my dorm placement. My first thought was why not use email to convey the same but as I looked around most of my campus did seem to be based in the 1900s from its neo-gothic architecture to the attendants who seemed old, not in a sense that would seem to be described as senior citizens but rather in a way that would just give off the vibes of having been in this place for ages.

I read my dorm number, 1D, which was on the first floor as I walked up the stairs. The staircase whirled around a single pillar smack in the middle, leading up to the doors to the lobbies that housed the rooms. As I glanced up at the ceiling, trying to figure out how far the stairs led, I noticed something peculiar: there was no end in sight; the staircase seemed endless. I marveled at the design, thinking to myself how the architecture of the olden times would be one of the most creative ones to ever exist.

Entering the lobby of my floor, I began the search for my dorm room. I had read that along with me there would be another person living there. Nervously, I read 1A, 1B, 1C... 1D. There were only four rooms on this lobby and a communal washroom. As I walked towards my room, my nervousness started to increase, my anticipation regarding how my new roommate would be, if we would get along, etc., started to seep into my mind. I opened my dorm door and was greeted with a friendly-looking face, with a smile on her face.

“I am Pamela,” she said, “but you can call me Pam.”

“Anna,” I said, shaking her hand, “so I finally met my roommate.”

“Exciting, right?” she said with general excitement, while I glanced around the room. It was a moderately-sized dorm room, with enough space to fit two single beds, a table-chair, and a closet touching the beds, indicating respective individual spaces. I looked at my watch; it said 3:00 pm. Pam interjected, "The dorm meeting is going to be held at 6:00 PM, so be ready and make sure to unpack all your stuff before leaving this room." This struck me as odd, but I didn’t think much of it. I assumed it was just something that Pam liked or just another initiation ritual that I had heard was the norm in college.

As I finished unpacking my stuff, I took one look at my watch; it said 5:45, just in time, I thought. Pam voiced it, “Good thing you’re punctual; this is really important here,” she said with a slight seriousness in her voice.

“So when did you move in?” I asked, a little curious.

“I came in two days ago,” she replied, “have you met our neighbors? Are they pleasant?” I wanted to know more.

“You’ll find out in about 7 minutes,” she said.

As we walked down the endless stairs to the common area, I saw new faces which I assumed were my neighbors. As we reached the common room, the RA who was standing right at the end of the staircase handed me a piece of pamphlet, which I assumed was an induction pamphlet. I saw more people all gathered around sitting on the couch and the chairs kept around the room. Pam tugged my arm slightly, letting me know that she found us a place to sit. I meekly followed my new roommate to where she led me.

The RA, who was doing the explaining, seemed to be around 22 and had a round face with not many discernible features. He seemed to be a postgrad and new at his job, much contrary to most of the staff I had encountered so far. It started with Ron the RA introducing himself as a History major and then leading on to the rest of the people in the room introducing themselves. I didn’t pay much attention to the rest of the floors but kept an eye on people whom I might share a floor with. Amongst all the people around, Nate and Ryan were roommates and lived in 1A, Jessica and Courtney were in 1B, while Amelia and Sherin were in 1C, the room adjacent to ours. Excited to get to know my floormates, I decided to personally introduce myself later.

As it was on each floor of our dorm, each floor had one room of freshmen, two of upperclassmen, and one of postgrad studies students. I was planning an appropriate introduction in my head when Ron's indifferent tone turned serious, almost grave, as if he was issuing a warning of sorts.

“Now that the introductions are in order, it's time for the rules,” he said, stopping in front of me and handing me a paper listed out with an amazingly long number of lines, each imprinted with its adjacent sentence, some marked in bold. 'DO NOT MISS OUT ON THE DEADLINE,' only to be followed by a list of sub-rules indicating either the penalties or what to do in case of a breach in the rules. “Since we have new members amongst us and our dorm is now at capacity, I will repeat and explain each rule out,” Ron continued. “I would expect all the members present with us at the moment to pay utmost attention and understand and respect these rules thoroughly. If any of you are in breach of either of the rules or your compatriots are, I am to be immediately informed, regardless of the time of day or night..."

He took a deep breath before diving into the explanation of the rules, his voice carrying a weight of responsibility that seemed to settle heavily upon us all.

"Rule number one: DO NOT MISS CURFEW," Ron began, his eyes scanning the room to ensure our undivided attention. "The curfew for each floor is different and based on a schedule posted on the notice board every morning. Each floor is expected to be on time for the curfew regardless of where they are or what they are doing. Failure to do so would result in immediate expulsion and other consequences to the responsible student."

Ron paused briefly before continuing with the next rule.

"Rule number two: IF YOU SEE THE STAIRCASE OF YOUR DORM MOVE WHILE YOU’RE ON IT, THEN STAY SILENT FOR EXACTLY A MINUTE. IF IT DOESN’T STOP AFTER THE MINUTE AND LEADS YOU TO A LOBBY, THEN WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT MOVE, EVEN IF YOU SEE SOMEONE YOU KNOW CALLING OUT TO YOU OR STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU AND ASKING YOU TO JOIN THEM. If this happens to you, it’s absolutely imperative that you do not get off the staircase, as whatever place those stairs may lead you won’t be our world. In case you’re stuck and the stairs may not move for another 3-5 minutes, it’s important that you immediately give me a call. Now, it’s also important to note that if I don’t pick up and you ring me again, I won’t be the one answering the call, even though it might seem like my voice, it’s not me."

With this, Ron's explanation continued, delving into the intricacies of each rule, leaving us all with a sense of unease and uncertainty. As he finished, he reiterated the seriousness of the rules and the consequences of breaking them. The atmosphere in the room was tense, with whispers breaking the silence until Ron called for attention once more.

"Rule number three," he continued, "DO NOT MISS THE FLOOR CURFEW. There will be an individual floor curfew listed on the notice board each morning, and it's imperative that it's followed. These rules have been put in place for your safety, as the campus is isolated from the nearest town. In case of any serious accidents, it would take at least 30 minutes to reach the campus, let alone our dorm, which is almost 10 minutes inside."

Stairs moving, serious accidents, floor curfews? What is all this, I thought to myself.

Ron continued, “4. IF YOU SUSPECT THAT YOUR ROOMMATE ISN’T YOUR ROOMMATE THEN CALL THE RA AND IF THE RA DOESN’T PICK UP, ASK THE ROOMMATE ‘THE QUESTION’. IF THE PERSON DOESN’T GIVE THE APPROPRIATE ANSWER, THEN IMMEDIATELY GET YOURSELF OUT OF THE SITUATION AND INTO THE LOBBY OF THE DORM AND CALL THE SECURITY.” Ron explained, “The rule is pretty much clear in itself. If I don’t pick up, then it’s important that you run and call security, and ‘RUN’, don’t walk. The question would be common for everyone living in the dorms, so it may just not be your roommate; it could be anyone you’re interacting with in this dorm building, including me. So it’s important that all of us are on the same page on this. The question is ‘how is the water blue and not purple,’ to which the answer is ‘it's not, it's cranberry.’ Along with this, check whether or not the person is showing their eyes to you. If they're hiding or refusing to show their eyes to you, then it's on good authority that you ask them the question. And if they do not answer correctly, call me and get away as far as possible from them, possibly to the lobby, as they cannot come into the lobby.”

“5. DO NOT ROAM AROUND THE CAMPUS AT NIGHT ALONE AND WITHOUT PROPER PERMISSION TO DO SO. IF THIS RULE IS BROKEN, THEN IT COULD LEAD TO EXPULSION OF THE STUDENT,” Ron continued. “As you can read, the important rule which most of the students feel the need to break is this one, although on good authority, as these may be our years to enjoy. But you've decided to come to Crestwood, and this isn’t the place to enjoy, hence only the most successful people make it out of here.”

With that, Ron concluded the meeting, leaving a lingering sense of unease among us. As the freshmen reacted with confusion or skepticism, I glanced at Pam, noticing her serious expression mirroring that of the seniors. The atmosphere was eerie, devoid of the typical college life I had expected.

Me and Pam returned to our room, and I finally voiced my concerns, “What the hell was all that? Are they trying to make a joke out of this, or what? Do they think we're so naïve that we would believe all this without question?”

Pam replied with a serious but confused tone, “Do you not know the Crestwood history?” 

“No,” I admitted.

She continued, “The reason Crestwood is so sought after, albeit not many students attend, is because of the things or the numerous occurrences that have happened here. When I researched this place, all I saw were pictures of the campus and the rating for the course I wanted. It was my backup option after, of course, Oxford.”

“It was mine as well, but the history behind this school is not openly found. There are only rumors, and they say that Principal Hornington has done a great job hiding most of the things that happen around here.”

“Like what?” I asked.

“Like the disappearances or the—” Before she could finish her sentence, there was a knock on the door. I moved to open it, but Pam stopped me with a whisper, “Don’t open.” She shut off the lights and pointed towards the clock and the brochure I was holding, indicating the unspoken sub-rule of not opening the door if the corridor lights were out after the floor curfew.

Confused, I asked, “Why are we supposed to follow these rules? Couldn’t these just be gags planted by the seniors to rag on the freshmen?”

“You don’t know, do you? Crestwood is known to be the epicenter of the most paranormal things. This rule is to prevent whatever is outside from coming in and attaching itself to us.”

“Paranormal?” I exclaimed. “What are you talking about?”

“You should seriously visit the library and understand what's going on here. And before that, you ‘need to’ learn all the rules by heart if you want to survive this school,” Pam insisted.

I sighed and agreed to visit the library as it was important for me to understand what the hell was going on in  this place and what was the reason behind all these weird occurrences and the rules, the weird rules.
