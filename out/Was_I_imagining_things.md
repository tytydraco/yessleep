I want to start this off by telling you that these stories were when I was three, eight and nine years old. The first story was my brother’s.

This was when my brother was 4 and I was three, we lived in Keokuk, Iowa at the time. During the first few nights in the house that we had just bought my brother would wake up at 12am going batshit crazy, screaming “WHY IS SHE HERE, GET HER OUT!” Of course, my parents weren’t seeing anything, but it was the same corner every time. He described “her” as an old lady who wore a white dress. Eventually me and my brother switched rooms because we wanted to see if that would change anything, and it did. He stopped waking up in the middle of the night. Now this is going to sound crazy, but the owner of the house prior to us had a little boy who died when he was three years old and she lived in that house up until her death, but I think that was the owner of the house checking on my brother making sure he was okay. But either way being in this situation would freak anyone out.

During the years 2013 and 2014, my family was living in a small town in Iowa. We used to have a little farm that wasn’t on our house property, we would drive less than 10 minutes to get there. For context when you first got on to the property there was a small hill that led down into a small wood, there was a hidden river down there with an old bridge that I would go on, we also had goats, chickens and bees, this is also important later. But let’s get back on track.

The bridge that was in the woods was a bit old and my family decided to fix it. After it was fixed I was able to play in the river without thinking about how I was going to get out. One day when I was down there, I was picking some wild moleberries (They are like the Blackberries' smaller cousin but more sweet). Now even though this was a small wooded area this led to a larger area that was off the property so me and my brother weren’t allowed to go into that part of the forest. But that day after hearing a twig snap close by, I looked around to see if one of the goats had followed me but I didn’t see them. So I went back to picking the berries and then I heard what sounded like heavy breathing almost like someone had been running for their life, however when I noticed the breathing was coming from the deeper part of the woods. That made me very nervous, being eight years old and not very large was not necessarily ideal if I had to defend myself, that’s when I saw whatever it was started to stand. I recall that it was almost as tall as the small tree that separated the property from the larger area, there was also a foul odor accompanying the creature, then it did some weird knock on the tree it was next to with its hand. That was about the time I dropped my bucket of berries and ran uphill (this is important for later) back to the barn and got in the car. Later that night I was watching TV with my dad and what he was watching just happened to be about Bigfoot and how they will knock on trees as signs of communication. I’m not saying that it was a Bigfoot, but the thing that I saw was tall.

By mid-summer of 2014 my family was planning to move away. So, a month prior to moving we were getting things ready to not only sell our house but also our farm. One night we came on to the property and nothing seemed off or weird until we passed where the beehives were. I told my dad that there were two lights on the other side of the river. Remember when I said that there was a hill by the woods? Well, there were two hills on both sides, one led to the barn the other led to the entrance. The hill that led to the entrance was very visible from where we were, so my dad pointed the headlights towards that hill. But nothing was there, he turned them all the way off and then there were the two lights again. He once again turned on the headlights on full blast but we didn’t see anything there. This concerned my parents because if they were people they would’ve been standing in the middle where we could see them if we turned the headlights on all the way, this wasn’t fireflies either because their lights are not white like the ones we were seeing, these weren’t animals either because there we would have seen them. We continued doing our night chores on the farm but we were very careful that night when we did, then by the next morning when we went to do our morning chores we found out that we were robbed, which was odd because we didn’t see anyone on the property the night before. We did get the police involved but they said they were unable to help due to us getting ready to move and only having the story, yes, we did have a no trespassing sign but when did anyone ever listen to those?

I still think of these things even though I am older now, but I can't help but feel that I wasn't Imagining the things I saw because my parents also experienced these events with me.
