When I was twelve, I experienced something that still haunts me. It was around 3:00 AM when I suddenly woke up, unable to move. I was pinned to my bed, my eyes wide open but my body completely paralyzed. My room was cloaked in darkness, except for the faint glow of the nightlight in the corner.

I tried to move, to scream, but I was frozen in place. My heart pounded in my chest as I noticed something moving at the edge of my vision. A grotesque centipede, unnaturally large, slithered up the side of my bed. It was as thick as my arm, its hundreds of legs clicking against the wooden frame. The creature's body shimmered in the dim light, an oily black with a sheen that made my stomach turn.

The centipede’s antennae twitched, sensing me. It crawled onto my bed and inched closer, its segmented body undulating with every movement. I could see its mandibles, sharp and menacing, as it approached my face. My breath hitched as it crawled onto my chest, its legs pricking my skin through my shirt.

I felt a sharp sting as it bit down on my shoulder, but oddly, there was no pain—only an eerie numbness spreading from the bite. Then, just as suddenly, the pressure lifted. The centipede scuttled away, disappearing into the shadows as my body finally released from its paralysis. I shot up, gasping for breath, my room now silent. The clock still read 3:00 AM, as if time had frozen during my ordeal. I flicked on the light and hurried to the mirror.

There, on my shoulder, were two distinct puncture marks. My heart raced, and I quickly threw on a long-sleeved shirt, not wanting to look at the marks any longer. I barely slept for the rest of the night, the memory of those clicking legs and the creature’s cold, unfeeling eyes burned into my mind.

The next morning, my mom noticed the bite marks. Her eyes widened with concern as she asked, “David, what happened to your shoulder?”

I hesitated, my mind racing. There was no way she’d believe what really happened. “Oh, uh, it’s nothing, Mom,” I stammered. “Skittles scratched me last night. You know how she gets sometimes.”

Her expression softened, but I could tell she wasn’t entirely convinced. “You need to be more careful, okay? Maybe keep Skittles out of your room at night.”

I nodded, relieved she hadn’t pressed further. As the years passed, I never told anyone the truth. I’m sixteen now, and every time I look at the faint scars on my shoulder, I’m reminded of that night. I never felt pain after that initial moment, but the terror remains. Sometimes, in the dead of night, I wake up and think I see that centipede lurking in the shadows again. I know it’s just my mind playing tricks, but the fear is all too real. I still can’t explain what happened that night, but the marks on my body are proof enough that something did.
