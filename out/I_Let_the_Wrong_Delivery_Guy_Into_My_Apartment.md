I was starving for that pizza.
Lately, I’d become completely hooked on junk food. Every afternoon played out the same way: I’d finish work, rush home, and order something greasy and disgusting. As soon as it arrived, I’d devour the whole thing while playing CS:GO or COD with the guys, depending on what we felt like that night.

For an average Friday evening, this was pure heaven: a double pepperoni, extra-cheese, 32-inch pizza and a chill CS:GO session. A twenty-eight-year-old overweight guy couldn’t ask for anything better. I had just placed the order, and I was already craving it. It was from my favorite place, I always ordered from there, and it was always perfect. The only downside was that they weren’t on Uber Eats. The place was old-school; you still had to order by phone or through their clunky website. But I didn’t care,  that pepperoni was worth the hassle.

They said it would take about thirty minutes. I figured I had time for a few rounds with the boys, I was feeling pretty sharp that night.  But just as we finished our first match, someone rang the doorbell.

I frowned and turned toward the door. I hated when someone showed up unannounced. Honestly, I didn’t even feel like opening it.

Then the bell rang again, followed by a soft knock.
What the hell? I thought.

Who could be that impatient? I wasn’t expecting anyone. It couldn’t be the pizza, I’d ordered it barely ten minutes ago.

Another quiet knock came, and then a damp, muffled voice:


“Pizza… I brought the pizza,” it groaned, the words punctuated by a wet, sucking sound. “I brought your pizza.”


Suspicious but curious, I crept toward the door. Peering through the peephole, I really did see a pizza delivery guy standing there.
 
The pizza guy greeted me with a twitching, distorted face. He was smiling in this unnatural, strained way, and his baseball cap was pulled so tightly onto his head it looked like something was pressing it down. The weirdest part, though, was how much he was sweating. At first, I thought he’d gotten caught in the rain, but it wasn’t raining. The guy’s skin was ghostly pale, and he was drenched in sweat.
 
The smell hit me next,  rancid and foul, like he’d fetched the pizza straight out of a sewer pit.
 

“Pizza. For Mark,” he gurgled, his voice wet and bubbly, like his mouth was half full of water.
 

He swallowed hard, as if trying to choke down all the saliva collecting in his mouth, but he didn’t hand over the pizza box.
 

“Uh… yeah, I’m Mark,” I said awkwardly. “I think it’s already paid for…”


“Yes.” The man swallowed again, loudly. “Paid.”


“Right… okay,” I stammered. “So, uh… can I have it?”

 
He looked at me. His eyes were glassy, like he’d been crying all night. That same smile stayed plastered across his face, while sweat poured off him so badly there was already a puddle forming beneath his feet.
Then his face twitched again, a painful spasm , but the grin didn’t fade. It only stretched wider as beads of sweat ran down his temples and dripped onto the floor.

 
“Uh… man, are you okay?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.


“No. Not okay,” he replied, and a thin string of clear liquid dripped from the corner of his mouth. “Can I… use your bathroom?”

 
I glanced around, uneasy. What the hell was wrong with this guy? Something about him felt off, but I couldn’t just turn away someone who looked that sick.
 

“Uh… sure,” I muttered after a moment. “It’s down the hall, to the left. Sorry, it’s a bit messy.”
 

That strange grin somehow stretched even wider,  impossibly wide. He gave a small, jerky nod, almost like a bow of thanks, and started shuffling forward into my apartment.
I stepped aside, thinking maybe I was blocking his way, but his pace didn’t change. He still moved slowly, awkwardly,  almost like someone who’d wet himself. Maybe that explained the smell.
 

“Uh…” I stammered. “Can I get the pizza, though?”

 
He stopped in the entryway. With a single stiff motion, he thrust the box toward me.
The motion stirred the air around him,  and the stench hit me like a punch. I gagged and nearly lost it.
Holding my breath, I snatched the box from his hands. The next thing I felt was pure disgust: the box was slimy, damp,  the edges soggy, as if it had been soaked in some sticky water. His sweaty palms had left it wet to the touch.
 

“The bathroom’s at the end of the hall,” I managed to say weakly, barely getting the words out.
 

I set the disgusting box down on the table behind me.
Then I heard it,  a wet, slippery noise, like something crawling rapidly across the floor.
 
By the time I turned around, the delivery guy was gone. A second later, a door slammed shut.
 
Someone had just run into my bathroom, and locked themselves inside.
 

“Sir, are you okay?” I asked nervously through the bathroom door.


No answer. Only the sound of running water , nothing else.
 

“Hello? Everything all right in there?” I called out, a little louder this time.
 

“Uh… ugh…” came that same wet, sloshing voice, like someone trying to speak with a mouth full of saliva. “My stomach… it hurts… hurts so bad… uh…”
 

I rolled my eyes, still standing there in front of the bathroom. He sounded less like a man in pain and more like a kid faking a stomachache to skip school. The water kept running, but there were no other sounds.
 
Then I heard a ping from my PC — Discord.
Clumsily, I hurried back to the desk. My friends were already getting impatient, asking when I’d be back to finish the match.
I quickly typed that something weird was going on with the pizza guy. Of course, they just laughed, saying it was “so me” to have something like that happen. I couldn’t just leave it there,  I fired back messages, arguing with them, completely losing track of time.
 
I don’t know how long it was before the doorbell rang again.
 
What the hell now? Who could that be? I grumbled, dragging myself back to the door and peeking through the peephole.
 
It was the pizza delivery guy.
A young, thin dude with long hair, nervously fixing it while shifting from foot to foot on my doorstep.
 
That’s when it hit me like a punch to the gut. The pizza guy is in my bathroom.
 
So who the hell was this standing at my door?
 
Slowly, carefully, I cracked the door open, just enough that I could slam it shut again if something went wrong.
 

“Evening,” the young delivery guy said. “Double pepperoni, extra cheese, for Mark?”


“Y-yeah…” I stammered, pale as a sheet. “That’s me.”
 

The kid gave me a wary look but handed over the pizza. At first, I couldn’t even bring myself to take it,  I just stared at the box in shock.
 

“Uh… you okay, man?” the delivery guy asked.


“You’re… you’re the pizza guy?” I muttered, my voice trembling.


“Uh, yeah,” he said, glancing around, like he expected this to be some kind of prank show. 


“But… then who the hell is in my bathroom?” I asked, horrified.
 

The kid’s eyes widened. He didn’t answer, but the panic on his face said it all.
He looked ready to bolt.
 

“Uh… I don’t know, man,” he said finally, hesitating. “But I’ve got a bunch more deliveries to make, so… I’m out.”
 

Before I could react, he shoved the box into my hands and started backing away down the hall.
 

“Wait!” I shouted after him, my voice cracking. “Please, help me! Come see who’s in my place!”


“Hell no, man! Not falling for that, fatty!” he yelled back. “I’ve seen enough horror movies,  I’m gone!”

 
And with that, he sprinted for the stairwell door, leaving me completely alone…with whatever the hell I’d let into my apartment.
 

My first instinct was to just leave the apartment.
But where would I even go?
 
Instead, I messaged the guys on Discord: something’s wrong. I told them if I didn’t reply within ten minutes, they should call the cops. I was going to try to throw the intruder out myself.
 I hurried to the bathroom door,  and was instantly hit by a wave of nausea.
The stench coming from inside was indescribable, like someone hadn’t flushed the toilet for weeks.
And if that wasn’t bad enough, a trail of slimy water was seeping out from under the door.
Of course, I stepped right in it,  I hadn’t noticed the puddle in the dim light.
 

“What the hell is this?” I muttered angrily, looking down at my soaked, sticky socks.
 

The slime was like a mix of water and saliva,  thick, mucusy, like snail slime.
 

“Hey! Hey, man!” I yelled through the door. “Who the hell are you? Open up right now and get the hell out of my apartment!”
 

As tough as I tried to sound, I was terrified. No answer. Just the constant sound of running water.
 

“What the fuck are you doing in there?!” I shouted, pounding on the door. “Get out now, or I’m calling the cops!”
 

Then — click.
The lock turned. And I swear, my heart stopped.
 
Not only did the stench explode out into the hallway, but the slimy water burst through as well, flooding my pants and the floor of the living room. Gagging, I covered my mouth and nose, stumbling backward until my back hit the wall.
 What I saw next made my stomach drop.
 
The pizza delivery guy was standing in the middle of my bathroom. Completely naked. His skin shimmered with slime, and from almost every opening in his body poured some thick, translucent fluid.
 

“What the fuck is this?!” I yelled at him, my voice shaking.
 

The figure turned toward me, then lunged, like some kind of squid-like creature.
It felt like something wet and heavy latched onto me. His hands weren’t hands anymore, but slimy tentacles. His body looked like it was made of sewer water, reeking of waste and rot.
 

“I’m going to feed you,” the thing gurgled beside my ear, “you fat pig.”
 

I tried to shove it off me, but my hands just sank into its body. It was like trying to push away a pool of filthy, swirling water,  there was nothing solid to grab.
Then it forced one of its disgusting, slick tentacles down my throat.
 
I could feel the liquid pouring inside me, it was like swallowing the runoff from a sewer drain. The thick, slimy ooze slid down my throat, chunks of god-knows-what scraping past my tongue. I clawed at the tentacle, trying to rip it out, but it just pushed deeper, tilting my head back, filling me.
 I felt like I was going to vomit and suffocate at the same time.
 
I’d never been that lucky before, but as I let go of one of the creature’s tentacles, my hand brushed against the floor lamp beside me.
Without thinking, I grabbed it and swung as hard as I could.
 
The slimy thing took the hit and flew backward into the bathroom.
 
I barely had a moment to breathe,  I was still gagging on the foul, sour stench that filled my throat. Then the thing launched itself straight at my head. It splattered over me, covering my face entirely. It was like being trapped inside a balloon made of rancid, dirty water.
 
I couldn’t take it anymore. I collapsed to my knees in the narrow hallway, gasping for air.
But no help came.
Everything went dark.
 
When I opened my eyes again, there was light,  a harsh, white light shining directly into my face.


“Ah, stop it!” I yelled, panicked, sitting up fast.
 

“Sir! Please, lie back down!” a voice ordered somewhere above me.
 

As my vision cleared, I realized the apartment was full of people. Cops. Paramedics. And a few of my neighbors staring from the doorway.
I was lying there, drenched, soaked in the filthy water that covered my floor between the living room and the bathroom.
Everything was wet,  sticky, grimy, chaotic. The whole place looked like it had been hit by a flood of garbage.
 

“Sir,” one of the officers said, “can you tell us what happened here?”
 

I told them everything. Every detail. Of course, nobody believed me.
 The downstairs neighbor blamed me,  said I was lazy, careless, probably broke a pipe or something.
The cops weren’t buying it either, even after they found the pizza delivery guy’s baseball cap in my bathroom.
I was the crazy one. The joke.
 
But one thing I knew for sure , what happened here was real.
And I was done ordering takeout.
