It’s difficult to find the starting point. No one is around anymore. Just me in here, and him out there. Hopefully I can finish this in time, because every passing moment he’s making progress on my barricade. And that hissing, it’s overwhelming and makes it hard to think. It shakes the house like an isolated earthquake, and it sounds like static on the television turned up way past capacity.

 

I can’t start there, there’s too much. All you need to know is that my whole life I knew there was something wrong with my house. A normal house in a normal neighbourhood, but things happened, and as the years went by these things became more sinister, more violent. More frequent.

 

I lived a happy life, I think. If not happy, then at least normal. I had two loving parents, an older brother that protected me from the hardships of childhood, and a wonderful little yapper named Bambo. My family was Italian, and so it spread beyond these boundaries of immediates to include cousins and aunts and uncles, and they were all to me like more siblings and more parents. My nonna and nonno didn’t speak a lick of English, so I was never very good at communicating with them, but I never felt love like that from anyone else. Sometimes communication, especially emotional communication, can be told strictly from a look. When they looked at me I felt loved; love that hit me invisible, like microwaves radiating from their smiles to soothe me in a warm and comfortable embrace.

 

So I guess that’s what I meant by a happy life. To love and be loved. Who could ask for more?

But something else lived among us. Something that took the sum of all that love and matched it with hatred. It lived in my parents’ room.

 

I can’t make this too long, I don’t have time. Growing up in that house was strange. Things happened sometimes, insignificant things like a box falling over in the basement for no reason at all, or a voice, barely heard, behind you when you sat reading at the kitchen table all alone. A voice that said, “Hello.” Stuff like that. And often you could forget about it, or explain it as a trick of the mind, those tricky things, you know? Imagination. Could be I didn’t hear anything. But deep down, I knew. And no matter where in the house I experienced these things, I felt this intrinsic knowledge that the source of it all came from my parents’ room. Like there was some master puppeteer up there holding all these strings, each of them attached to some object or button in our house, and whenever this thing entered a whimsical mood it would pull on one to try to frighten us.

 

Bambo died when I was thirteen. I loved that dog so much. He still appears in my dreams, and I say, “Bambo? Is it really you?” And he would yap and wag his tail and I would lift him up and hold him close and keep him that way until I would wake up with tears drying on my cheeks. Boy, did I ever love that dog. Well, that’s important, because Bambo is kind of the reason we left that house. Not because of his death, no, we lived there long afterwards. We still live there, technically. We left because of the hissing.

 

A few months ago I was sitting at the kitchen table studying some Robert Frost poem on my laptop when suddenly the house filled up with a sound. It did not accelerate in decibels, it simply came full throttle and without warning, like a hurricane crashing all around; this static, this hiss, so loud and debilitating that there was nothing you could do but put your hands to your ears, shut your eyes, and clench your teeth against it. Then it stopped. Nothing in the house had shifted. I really heard that, I thought to myself. No imagination there, that was real, and I swear it brewed in my parents’ room.

 

I told my brother about it later and he kind of paled and made some laconic reply and we didn’t talk about it again.

 

I’ll get on with it, because that hissing is here right now, shaking the entire house, and it’s not stopping anymore. I don’t think it’s ever going to stop. I think it’s here for good.

 

It happened a few more times after that, never when my parents were home, but my brother was around once, and during the maelstrom things were crashing off shelves. It was really bad that time, and I said, “Stan!” and I charged up the stairs and tried the door to my parents’ room, but it was locked. The handle would not give. “Stan!” And he came up the stairs with his hands over his ears and fear in his eyes, and I said, “It’s coming from in here. We have to get in there.” He shook his head at me and ran back down the stairs.

 

It stopped. I tried the handle and it opened without resistance. Everything was in perfect order. I checked the bathroom that was an appendage of the room, and even there, all seemed okay.

 

Well, my parents had a freak out when they got home. They saw the disaster of the place and went berserk on us. We explained to them what happened and they got real quiet and there was no punishment that ensued. They believed us. Their silence confirmed it.

 

The next time it happened, I was in the basement playing a video game. My brother was out with a friend, but my parents were home. The sound hit me like a. . . like a wall of water. Like one moment I was just sitting there, and the next I was hit with something hard but fluid; it went through me and all around me and it hurt in its volume and velocity. Boxes fell from behind the curtain that separated the living area of the basement from the storage area, and I stood up and ran, mounting the steps two at a time, and my parents had already vacated the house in their panic, because when I reached the landing and turned to the front door, I saw them through the window standing at the end of the driveway looking terrified. But something stopped me in my tracks. A shrill yapping. The hissing was still all around me, deafening, but that shrill yapping was undeniable. I turned around and saw Bambo at the top of the stairs.

 

“Bambo?” I said. “Is it really you?”

 

My fear was vacant. It didn’t matter anymore. The sound was still there, but my brain had dulled it down to an ambient, minor inconvenience. It no longer had power over me.

 

I climbed the stairs and picked Bambo up in my arms and felt his breath against my neck.

 

“Bambo, what is happening? Do you know?”

 

He licked my face and I held him tight. The hissing did not subside. I carried him down the hall like a protective shield before me, and I tried the handle. It was locked.

 

“Time to go, Bambo. You don’t have to protect us any longer.”

 

That same day we all moved in with my Aunt Sofia. We were all distraught and traumatized, and there was nothing my aunt could do to placate the worry my parents felt, nor did she understand what it was they were worried about.

 

“We’re in danger!” my Mom shrieked and cried into my father’s shoulder.

 

It was my cousin’s birthday a few days later. Today actually. Today.

 

The doorknob is wiggling. He got through the barrier it seems. The only thing between me and him now is the durability of the lock. Not much.

 

Well, everyone was there but we hadn’t heard from my nonno all night. He wouldn’t answer his phone. The party started at noon. My nonna stayed home sick, she had a fever.

 

Well anyway, eventually, around nine o’clock, a knock came at the door and my uncle went to answer it.

 

“Papa!” he shouted, and in came my nonno. “Cosa indossi?” my uncle said. What are you wearing?

 

My nonno walked into the house without a word and he came right over and looked at me. He was shorter than me. Bald, with glasses, and an incredibly kind face. But that look was not the look of love, which is the look I was used to.

 

And he had a t-shirt on, this baby blue t-shirt with a ribbon attached to it like he came first place in some competition, and in black font on the front of the shirt it read, “I SURVIVED A PARANORMAL EXPERIENCE. FUCK 802.”

 

Below that were two long paragraphs written in sharpie, but they weren’t of a language I understood. I read the font again, and I realized what must have happened.

 

He must have thought that the party was at our house and went there alone, entered the house, and then fell victim to the thing that controlled that house. He must have been severely traumatized, right? He must have been taken to a hospital for the trauma, and the doctors must have given him this shirt to show just how brave he was.

 

This was an illogical thought, but it was the only explanation that came to me in such short notice. It made sense to me for a moment. But then all sense ceased when he spoke to me. He spoke not in Italian, but in English, and he said in this unusual voice, “Hello. I finally made it out of there.”

 

Again, at first I misunderstood him. I thought, yeah, I’m glad you made it out of there too, nonno.

 

But then I looked in those eyes again and the hiss came crashing through the house, and in those eyes, those same eyes that are looking at me now from the open doorway, I saw nothing but pure, senseless hatred.

 

And that’s when I really understood what he meant.
