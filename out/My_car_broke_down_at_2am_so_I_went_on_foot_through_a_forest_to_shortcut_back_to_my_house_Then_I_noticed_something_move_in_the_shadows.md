I’d just finished cleanup in the restaurant I work at in the village. It was me and another girl, we said our goodbyes as I closed up shop. I made sure everything was locked up and my way to the deserted car park behind the restaurant. My car sat alone in the middle of it. I sat in, attempted to turn on the engine only to hear it sputter and die out. I tried again but this time it barely even made a noise before dying off. 

Dammit.

I considered what I could do. It was 2am, so going round peoples houses at this hour looking for a spin probably wasn’t the best idea. My friends who lived near would also be asleep. A walk on the road I drive would take me 40 minutes during the day, who knows how much longer at night. But at the edge of the village is a forest. I know the path well enough from my youth, it’s rough but it’s a straight walk through to my house and should only take me 15 minutes max, even at night. 

I got out my car, locked it with the keys and started to make my way into the forest. I was sure I could get a friend to give me a lift into the village the morning after to pick up my car when we could jumpstart it.

Despite how well I know the path, at night it just made everything much creepier. The trees appeared larger, more ominous. The shadows deeper, the darkness threatening to hide something within it. Each sound sent a little shiver through me. 

I had to purge my mind and just trudge through the forest. No point getting in a panic. I thought the worst I’d come across is a badger. 

So that’s why when I initially saw the shadow move in the corner of my eye i didn’t panic. 

I just told myself it was my mind playing tricks on me. There obviously wasn’t something there, and if there was it was probably just an animal. But after another minute or so I noticed the shadow again. Was something stalking me?

Couldn’t be, I thought. No way. But then I heard something.

Crack.

I stopped dead in my tracks. I heard that for sure. To my right, maybe 20 meters away at a guess. I looked over there and saw a shadow approach me. A definite shape even in the darkness. Then I heard a cackle break through the night. A laugh that made my heart rise to my mouth in an instant. 

I started sprinting like my life depended on it. Adrenaline surged through me as I ran harder than I have ever in my life. I stumbled over roots and branches as I made my way through as quickly as possible, but I made sure to get up swiftly each time. I didn’t dare look back at whoever was chasing me. I just needed to get back as quickly as I could. 

After what felt like an eternity, I could see the forest open up and just ahead was my house. I hopped the wall in a swift but inelegant motion, falling over, then getting up and with unsteady hands slotting my key into the front door. 

I burst through when it came unlocked, then once inside, slammed it shut and quickly locked it. I ran around my house, making sure all the windows and doors were locked. Then went upstairs into my bedroom and looked outside the house into the darkness that lay beyond. 

Nothing. As far as I could make out there was nobody out there. Had I lost them? Or had I just imagined it? No way. That laugh was far too real. Someone had been there.

Then I heard a window smash. Downstairs, presumably one of the ones at the back of the house. I moved as quickly as I could, slamming the door to my room shut, locking it. Then I pulled my dresser over and put it in front of the door. Anything I thought would hold a person back i put against it. Then I slid against the wall opposite my door and called the police. 

“Miss, we need you to stay on call while we send someone. They’ll be there in a few minutes, just remain calm.” 

I heard the footsteps creep upstairs, the stairs creaking as they moved. They were slow, deliberate. I heard them carefully make their way across the landing to the room I was in. I’d dropped my phone to the ground, my hands trembling. My whole body had seemed to shake uncontrollably. 

Then the person knocked.

“I know you’re in there Lisa, come out to your lover.” 

A man’s voice, strangely familiar. Who was this? I started to cry. In that moment I felt a fear unlike anything else I’ve felt in my life. What did this they want with me? Why were they calling themselves my “lover”?

Then he started to hit the door. I watched as it physically reverberated with each hit. Then eventually it broke through partially, revealing a man in a clown costume. 

Just then I heard sirens sound, which started to louden and a flashing blue light illuminated the room. The clown sprinted down the stairs as I curled into a ball, unwilling to move.

“We got him miss. He tried sprinting away but we sent officers round the back when we arrived who managed to catch him. One uh… Henry Nichols. You know him?”

Henry? 

“He’s my ex-boyfriend. We broke up a couple months ago.”

“Had he interacted with you in those two months? Did you notice any strange behaviour if he did?”

“We didn’t interact in person, he lives a couple hours away from here now, but… I did hear some people say they’d seen him show up round here suddenly a few days ago.”

“Mhm. Well, we are fairly sure he ran the batteries out in your car. He knew you were going to walk through the forest after and tried to catch you there. We can only assume his intentions weren’t good. You needn’t worry now, I have no doubt he’ll be locked away for a long time.”
