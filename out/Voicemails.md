The Voicemails

Lately, I’ve been receiving strange voicemails from someone who sounds like me…
I don’t know how to explain it, but it goes as follows:

I recently moved into a new apartment a couple of months back after a bad breakup. I didn’t have much money left from the move, so I managed to get myself a cheap cell phone and one of those prepaid providers. The service was decent enough for the price, so I didn’t complain.

It wasn’t until I started receiving voicemails from an unknown number that things began to feel off. At first, they were faint — full of static and muffled whispers that cut in and out. I figured it was just a recycled number, maybe someone trying to reach whoever had this phone before me.

As the days went by, the voicemails continued to pile up, all about the same length, all ending in a burst of static. I stopped checking them altogether — they all sounded the same… or so I thought.

One night, I was out with a buddy when I got another notification. Another voicemail.
He laughed when I told him about it, so I put it on speaker to show him.

What we heard sent chills down my spine.

It was my voice on the other end — screaming, crying, begging for help.
The background was filled with strange metallic sounds, like something scraping against concrete.

My friend stopped laughing. He looked pale, and after a moment, muttered something about needing to get home. He didn’t even finish his drink before he left.

The next morning, I called my provider and told them everything. They said they’d look into it and call me back with more information.

Days went by. No callback. No new voicemails. Not even a text from my buddy.

Then, late last night, my phone buzzed — one new voicemail.

I just sat there staring blankly at my screen. Fear flooded my mind as I watched the notification appear. I couldn’t bring myself to open it. Instead, I dismissed it, crawled into bed, and told myself I’d deal with it in the morning — maybe I’d wake up and realize it was all just a dream.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

I jolted awake to the sound of someone at my front door.
Heart pounding, I slipped on my house shoes and shuffled toward the door.

“Who’s there?” I called out.

A familiar voice answered.
“My bad, man. It’s me — I just wanted to apologize for not keeping in touch.”

It was my buddy.

Relieved, I reached for the doorknob… but something inside me hesitated.
A quiet voice in my head whispered, Check your phone.

I unlocked it — and froze.

That same voicemail notification had appeared again. Only this time, the app had automatically generated a transcript of the message.

It read:

“Please don’t open the door. He’s here to take you.”
