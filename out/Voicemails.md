Hi everyone. this post was initially posted in the subreddit of my home state of Iowa. But, as the situation got worse, I decided to post it somewhere else.   
recap of the story.   
Hi, has anybody within Polk, Webster, Warren, and Story County gotten these weird voicemails? It started maybe, idk last year. It was a call from a blocked number. It was just incoherent beeping. Not even morse code, it was just a low hum, followed by beeping. Summer of 22, I got a phone call. This time I answered, it was a man with a British accent asking for a Boris. I told him he had the wrong number. He apologized, and then muttered something in a language I'm not sure of, but I think I was Russian. A few weeks later, I got another voicemail. This time, it had dialogue, and it said something about NORAD.  
  
  
  
Fast forward to May 22nd, 2023. I was at work, and a few of me and my buddies were in the breakroom, my coworker got a phone call. Again, from a British man looking for a Boris. I told him I got the same phone call. He just brushed it off. Later to call me in March, to tell me he got a voicemail directly at midnight. Again, about NORAD. Same happened with a few other friends but explaining it would probably just waste time. I'm just not sure what to do about this. It's even been sent to people in Ames, and Des Moines, Ankeny, Fort Dodge, Davenport. I have friends and family there; I don't live in any of those cities. I've noticed phone calls I don't remember making, contacts that are just several numbers and dashes, and a phone number I don't recognize. I'm not sure what to do here folks. if this has happened to anybody, I would very appreciate it if they'd say something. If not, I think it's literally just people I know.

Recap over.   
This originally started in the Spring of 2021. Stopped, started again in 22. Stopped once more, then went on again in 2023. As of 2024 nothing has happened. Yet.   
 I listened to the NORAD Voicemail pretty closely, and I believe it said something along the lines of:  
"NORAD, AWX, STATION ZULU FOXTROT 77. ZULU FOXTROT 77. STATUS ALERT CON 4." and then it ended. I think. Something might have been lost or misconstrued, but here we go.   
Spring of 2021.   
I was up late after work with some of my friends. I had gotten a call from a random 1-800 number.   
A man with a heavy accent had ask if I was Roger. I very politely responded, "No. You have the wrong number." and he hung up. Then, my friend, who I'll call Zack. Asked me for the number. I gave it to him. He muted on the Xbox Party, came back laughing to himself.   
"What'd you say?" I asked him.   
"Don't worry about it" he replied with a laugh.   
The next day, I had gotten a phone call from a blocked number. I sent it to voicemail. And here is a rough transcript of the voicemail from my memory.   
"Hey motherfucker. I got your little voicemail from last night. You're going to be getting a lot of calls soon motherfucker."   
I tried to ask Zack what he said to him. But he claims he was drunk that night, and he doesn't remember.   
later down the line, I won't get into detail simply because I don't remember that far back, (2021-2022)   
But regardless. I had gotten excess of maybe, 30-40 voicemails within 2021-2022. Usually the same thing, Incoherent beeping. NORAD, Words in other languages, but a few voicemails I received in the Summer of 2023, August specifically has stuck with me.   
Voicemail One: August 22nd, 2023.  2:37 am. Blocked Number.   
"Hey Rodger. We got it. That, thing you needed. Alex has it for you. You know where to find him."   
Voicemail 2: August 29th, 2023, midnight.   
"Oy dickhead. You didn't meet with Alex. I'm gonna leave it outside your house. I don't care about tracing anymore. I'm tired of holding onto it. I can't protect you for much longer, especially with Viktor around now. You know how he gets. Especially with, your situation. You fucked up. And this is the last time we're doing something for you. You still owe us. Cunt.   
Voicemail 3: July 19th, 11:54 am.   
801. 365. 192, 389. 100. Nikolai, 709.   
Francis, 297, 192.   
In December 2023, I was at work, I work the graveyard shift as an armed security guard, for my safety concerning this situation I won't specify where. But the daytime guard arrived within the hour of 5 am. not sure what specific time of course but. He came into the office, as I was clocking out me and him were talking, and right before I went to leave, he asked.  
"Oh, yeah I almost forgot. There's like a black SUV parked diagonal from the lot windows fully blacked out. Noticed him once I left my house. (He lives 2 streets away from our workplace) and my wife said it's been there since midnight, when she got home. Figured I'd just warn you. So, be ready, just in case bud."   
"Should I call the sheriff's office?"   
"No, probably not. I'm sure it's nothing. But Figured I'd warn you since, from the sounds of it it's been here since you clocked in. And I know about your little, harassing situation so."  
I thanked him, grabbed my bag, keys, and coat. And started walking to my car. I saw the SUV; I got in my car. And the SUVs lights flicked on. I locked my car doors, my ears were ringing, I started my car. And left the lot. I took the longer way back to my house. The SUV waited a bit before I left. But after a while I noticed it. A black, maybe mid 2010s Cadillac Escalade. Blacked out windows. I didn't know what to do. I was near my county sheriff's office, so I drove to the office, pulled my car up in front of the office. And the SUV sped away. I went home after. I couldn't sleep. I called in the next night.   
Nothing's happened since. I hope it's over. I don't know what they want from me. I dont want to know either. I think I'm going to change my number, move out of town. Hell move out of my county even. But. I'm not sure yet.
