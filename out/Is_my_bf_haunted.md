I wish this story wasn't true and I also wish I had the imagination to create something like this. I met my current boyfriend online almost three years ago, he is such a sweet funny guy. We started having a long-distance relationship in 2022 and I was head over heels for him. He is caring, intelligent, and very charismatic. I visited him on our second anniversary it was the first time seeing him in person ( I know it was a long time but at that time I just graduated high school and was working full-time, so I finally had money for a visit). 

The visit was amazing with no issues, it went so well that we decided to plan to move in together in the future. When I was back in my home state after our first visit together that was when the experiences started. I have always been sensitive to things such as the paranormal before, my family can recall times when I was a toddler I would say I could see recently deceased family members.

 My boyfriend on the other hand believes in spirits but doesn't believe he would ever fall victim to one. The stress of moving across the country had put a strain on me a lot, I had a wicked case of insomnia from anxiety. Every night my boyfriend and I would video chat, as always he was quick to fall asleep as I would stay up thinking about the endless task list with packing. 

That night I felt a rush of panic, not from my normal worrying and excessive thinking but I felt as if I was in immediate danger. I tried my best to close my eyes and relax as the night went on it surely reached around 2 am, when I heard the rustle of shifting around from my phone. My boyfriend was rustling around but not the normal he happened to be awake noises.

 I could hear him still softly snoring as it sounded from the other end of his room was rummaging noises. I picked up my phone to turn the volume up as I did my boyfriend spoke very loudly and clearly. "SOMETHING IS WRONG" then it was silence again. I was so scared I thought my heart was gonna pound out of my chest. I too scared to speak messaged him "Hey, are you awake? What's wrong???" Thinking a thousand thoughts of the possible danger he was in. Eventually built the courage to yell into my phone to get a response out of him, and he started lecturing me. He went quiet when I told him what he said. He said he was asleep the whole time, and he laughed it off. I would mention stories to mutual friends to get the same reaction as if it were a funny story. 

Eventually, I made the move this May, and from the first night, I noticed things. I would have vivid nightmares almost every night since the move. Some as small as worries about my new job to some as brutal and horrific as being trapped with dead bodies in a room. I didn't tell him about these nightmares as I summed it up to being anxious. I was hoping the summer vacation trip would ease some of my anxieties about my new life.

 As you would imagine this trip hasn't stopped my experiences but intensified them. The other night we were in bed and he was fast asleep as usual I had a terrifying nightmare. To put this into perspective the closet doors are just for length mirrors that can show the reflection of the whole room we were staying in. I was sleeping towards this mirror on the side closest to the mirror doors. My boyfriend was asleep on the other side closest to the wall. Between the wall and the bed, there was a decent gap that was easily walkable. This particular night I shot awake from fear of a dream I can't remember. As my eyes adjusted I looked into the mirror there I saw a white glowing figure standing tall hovering over my boyfriend.

 I swear what I saw looked like wings behind it all white with no facial features just a beam of pure light behind was almost an aura of blue and purple waves gushing out of it. As fast as I saw it faded away until there was nothing but pure darkness again. This entity didn't feel like this evil or fear I felt before, but light. Sense then a few times at night waking up from a nightmare I can never remember I have seen glimpses of this pure white being.

 It never stays longer than a few seconds, till it is pure darkness again. As well as this light, I felt another presence something like looming over me, like it was waiting and watching. This presence scares me, before this trip and before the light presence.

 I have seen the dark presence and caught it on video. I don't think I am going to share the video here because even watching it scares me. Within the first week of my moving there, my boyfriend got very sick. He was snoring horribly as he slept which caused me to get no sleep. In context, we are staying in a furnished basement room back at the home of his father's and stepmom's house till we find a place of our own.

 In this basement was a bed and a living room set. For some more background, his stepsister has warned me they have seen shadows of things and had nightmares before, and right after she told me about it the power went out and took hours to turn back on. That night I was lying on the couch hoping to get away from his snoring, he previously asked me to record his snoring for proof since he doesn't believe he snores. I was doing just that with the lens pointed towards the bed, the TV light illuminated some of the basement but not all of it.

 After recording him snoring I shortly fell asleep. The next morning I watched the video and right where should be just a blank white wall was a shadow figure hovering over my bf, I ideally stopped playing it and never watched the video again. I haven't told my boyfriend about any of these experiences I have had, and I hope the rest of this trip goes without any more beings. Shortly we plan to stay with my grandparents in the following week. Do any of you know what to do?? and he has never seen anything paranormal of sorts or had any experiences?
