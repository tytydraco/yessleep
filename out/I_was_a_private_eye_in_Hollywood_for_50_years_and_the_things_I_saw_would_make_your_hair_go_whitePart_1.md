Hello. My grandson told me this was a good place to tell my stories. Says I can't tell him anymore because they keep giving him nightmares. Can you believe that? 13 and still getting nightmares. We should’ve seen it coming when we stopped disciplining them right. Now they’re rotten and the world gets more rotten as they get more control of it. I love the kid though, gets straight A’s,leads the football team, he’s better than I ever was. 

Anyway, I shouldn’t ramble. Doc says if I do, I may finally lose the plot for good. Don’t really know what that means, I think it's a joke, but I was never the comedic type. Guess that’s why I got into the private eye game in the first place. Most of my peers went out to the big city to be famous actors or to marry one, but not me. I saw through all that bullshit. Saw the city for what it really was. A big bundle of secrets and horrors, waiting to be unwrapped. 

I was right of course. I saw it all. Still do. Made certain sacrifices to make sure of that. The beasts of hedonism that rise from those parties in the hills, the sickening demons that haunt those people you worship so deeply, that you wish to be. Don’t say you don’t worship them, I know you do. I see deep into your heart, I can grip your dreams and squeeze the juices of your wants from them. Once I reveal my truth, you’ll come to me begging for me to rip it from you mind, for me to free you of this unholy truth and I won’t. You’ll have to live with these horrors, like I have too.

I must’ve been in the business for 50 years before I finally retired. I think my first case got turned into a TV episode. Some writer probably pulled the strings for it all to happen, to see his story in real life so he’d know exactly how to turn it into fiction. Happens more than you’d think, which I guess for most people would be at all. I don’t know, I just remember my first phone call and how excited I was cause not only was it a famous actress, but she was calling me to help catch and handle some creeper fan of hers. Beating down creeps is a bit of a passion of mine, alongside watching jeopardy with my lovely wife and gardening down at the church's green house. 

So I went to her house and she gave me some details on the guy, enough to get a good picture of his look anyway, and I began my first stake out. It was boring, but I expected that. Takes a lot out of a young man sitting in the dark and having to ignore all the more interesting noises calling his name. I waited the whole night, the whole next night too, and eventually I gathered that whoever this guy was probably has an idea that I’m here. I guess a stalker would learn how to avoid being stalked. With the success rate of the stake outs seeming bust, I pitch this lady the idea that I look out from a location farther from the house to help coax out our friend, which of course she hated cause she though I was trying to cheat her out her money or something of that nature, so she decides that we should end our business partnership.

The next time I see her face, she’s in the paper. “Bumpkin lucks out!” was the headline if I recall correctly. Turns out she ended up marrying this no name from out of town. I don’t know what came over me to do what I did next, but I ended up bringing them a wedding present. A thanks for giving me my first gig I guess. The nicest champagne I could afford, wrapped in the cheapest paper I could find. I walked over to her estate, hopped the new gate which was not easy because it was larger than any home gate ought to be, and knocked on the door. 

Lucky for me, the actress opens the door. If it had been anyone else, I’d likely have been shot, stuffed, and paraded at every annual Hollywood Hunters Gala till the end of time. I go to hand her the bottle, but something off. Her eyes were hazy, and this kind of sugary scent seemed to pour out of her mouth, so potent was the smell it almost seemed to take physical form like in the cartoons. It’s like she’s been caught in a smoke of subservience, as if marriage hand sanded all her edges turning the firecracker who’d first hired me into just another housewife. That was the first and last time I ever felt anything for a client. Pity for this trapped woman and rage towards the “bumpkin” who’d done it to her. So, like a moron I ask to come inside. I knew something was wrong, but I wasn’t looking for answers, rather a fight. Don’t know how that’d solve anything, but it’d make me feel better.

The inside of the house was the portrait of perfection, beautiful yet 2 dimensional. Sure, this looked like the kind of place where you could start a family, but there was no real love, only someone's perverse idea of it. They had everything you’d need and even more stuff that you wouldn’t. A jukebox sat in one of the corners, blasting this some quartet's love song about how deep in the dark your kiss would thrill me. Creepy lyrics in the modern day and even back then, they unsettled me. 

“Can I get you a drink, detective?”

“No, I brought my own.” I used to have this flask I took everywhere, lost it when some prude cultists tossed me into the pacific. Real shame too. That flask helped to comfort me through many late night drives through the city. “Could I ask you a few questions actually?”

“Oh heavens, whatever could they be about?”  I could ask about that funny way she was talking, but I thought if I got to the bottom of the whole case, I'd figure that out.

“This husband of yours, he make you happy?”

“As a clam!”

“Nice, nice. I think I read about it in the paper, but jog my memory, how’d you two meet? Seems awfully lucky for some country kid to find love with a woman like yourself.”

“You must understand, I’m the lucky one. He’s simply a dream!” Her voice was giddy.

“And that’s good and all, but please tell me how you met.”

“At a restaurant, he was my waiter and I don’t know, it was simply love at first sight, or love after appetizers may be a more fitting title.”

“Waiter?” I was dismissive, as anyone would be I like to think.

“You sound like my mother.”

“I don’t mean to be rude, It’s just such a tale.”

“Maybe, but aren't all the best love stories.” As she spoke, I walked around the living room, scanning everything I could. I looked for some kind of wedding photo, strange for a newly wed couple to not litter them all over the house. “Why are you doing that?”

“What?” 

“You’re snooping.”

“Apoloigies, it’s just my nature. I noticed you don’t have any photos of your husband anywhere?”

“Yes, he doesn’t like them kept around the house. Says it’s vain.”

“Humble guy.”

“He does let me keep one.” She touched the heart shaped locket around her neck. How did I not notice that? A novice mistake, but I was a novice, so I guess it makes sense. Still it’s no excuse. 

“May I see?” She nods, opens the heart, and hands it to me. My blood ran cold. The man in this photo was my guy. Every detail matched her description. Somehow that stalker had achieved his final goal. He’d won. The thundering of the gates opening broke the silence. I was soon to be trapped and exposed, losing anyway to save this woman. I had to think quickly. “Where is your restroom?”

“Upstairs.”

“Thank you.” I burst into a sprint towards the stairs.

“You must really have to go!”

“Been holding it all day.”

“But don’t you want to meet Fred?” I didn’t have time to answer. I rushed down the hall and locked myself in the bathroom the minute I found it. I lucked out too, because there was a window. Certainly wouldn’t be a comfortable time getting out, but I was grateful for any escape at all. I heard the door open downstairs and some muffled conversation. Against my better judgement, I decided to see if there was anything in the bathroom that could help me piece together what was going on. Unfortunately, it was practically shining, it was so clean.  The only mess was a pair of pants lying in the corner. I went to pick them up and a small perfume bottle slipped out of the pocket. I didn’t get a great look at the thing before it shattered, but I certainly smelt whatever was inside after the fact. More sweetness, the same sweetness in fact. 

“WHAT WAS THAT?” Shit. I scooped up the glass, shoved it in my pocket, popped open the window, and began to shimmy out. More muffled conversation, now angry and panicked, served as the soundtrack to my escape. When I was able to pop myself out, I surveyed the property from the roof. The yard was torn up, like someone had been trying to find treasure, and the gate was luckily close enough that I could hop it if I got a running start. The door knob in the bathroom began to rattle violently and I moved to make my leap. I’ve never been much of an athlete, but in that moment I transformed into Jesse Owens, catching enough speed to float over the gate. My landing was not so graceful. I hit the asphalt like a sack of bricks and had to attempt to recover from having the wind knocked out of me as I ran from the house. 

I expected some kind of car to chase me down in the street, but it was silent. I was home free. The only damage to me would be done to my ears as the unmistakable sound of gunshots rang out from the actress’ house. I knew I had to go back, but I couldn't go alone. I looked for houses, but for the first time I saw just how secluded we really were. The sounds of Hollywood surrounded us, but the people making them must’ve been miles away. There was nothing I could do. So, like a coward, I ran.

She was dead, or he was. Those were the only two outcomes I decided. I drank myself into a stupor, trying to drown the guilt, but only giving myself a horrible hangover, which I figured I deserved. I woke up the next morning to the sound of the TV blaring some re-run of the previous night's programs. It was a talk show and who should be sitting on the couch, but the actress and her stalker, both wholly alive. 

Alright, the old lady says I got to get off the computer so she can use it for scrabble with friends. It’s a fun game. I’ll finish this some other time. I think this is good to do, what’d those old pulp writers used to call it? A cliffhanger. Alright, goodbye.

From,

Norman B. Hayes
