People say I’m sick. Psychotic. That I might harm people.  
That’s not true. I don’t harm anyone. I never do such things.

It’s just… people have never really understood me. I always tell them there’s something inside me, something that eats me from within. This sensation began a few months ago.

My elder sister and I share a very close bond. We tell each other every detail of our lives, never keeping secrets. She often told me about her boyfriend—a guy in his twenties, smart, with a good job, apparently cute—every time we spoke. It was obvious she was in love with him.

One night, she called with the good news: she wanted to marry him. I was thrilled. It felt like one of the best moments of my life.

A few days later, my sister and her boyfriend met my parents. Everything seemed fine—until he mentioned his caste. They couldn’t believe it. He belonged to a different caste than ours. My parents didn’t approve. They insisted it wasn’t right for them to be together. My sister tried her best to convince them, but nothing worked.

During our calls, she often cried, saying how my parents couldn’t understand the love she shared with her boyfriend. Then one day, my mother called me. All I could hear was sobbing. I couldn’t understand what had happened until she explained: my sister had eloped and gotten married.

I was happy for her but sad for my parents. They were miserable. Eventually, they kicked her out of the family. I tried to mend the family dynamic, but it couldn’t be sustained. They forced me to cut ties with my sister. I was shattered, devastated that I couldn’t talk to her anymore—all because of caste. That’s when things began to go downhill.

A few days after the commotion, I began to feel abdominal pain. I couldn’t understand the reason. I took some painkillers and tried to move on, but the pain lingered. I researched online and tried home remedies, but nothing worked. I even went to the doctor—he told me I was fine and prescribed some medicines, but they never helped.

Two weeks passed, and still there was no relief. At night, I often stood naked before the mirror, searching for the cause. I looked for bruises or wounds but never found anything.

One evening, my mother insisted we go out for dinner. It was me, my mom, and my dad. Dinners felt empty now; none of us spoke. My dad called over the waitress and we gave our order. It was her first day, so naturally she stumbled a little. After she left, my mother remarked, “A mountain girl—probably from a tribal caste.”

My dad added, “They don’t know anything, so it makes sense she couldn’t serve properly.”

Suddenly, I felt a stabbing pain in my abdomen, as if someone were punching me. I ran to the bathroom and began vomiting violently—first food, then blood. A lot of blood. The entire bathroom floor was soaked. I looked into the mirror: pale, miserable. I removed my shirt and saw a rash spreading across my stomach, one I had never seen before.

In the following days, I visited multiple doctors about the rash. Each one told me the same thing: there was no rash. My mind filled with questions. I tried to ignore the pain, distracting myself however I could.

I even found a date on Tinder. She was sweet, and we agreed to meet at a bar. We chatted about our lives, our interests, our work. For a moment, the pain disappeared. But then she told me she couldn’t get into her dream university because of caste reservations—many people with lower scores had been admitted instead. The air grew awkward. I felt a tingling in my stomach but ignored it.

A musician began to play and people danced. I joined with my date. As I moved, the visions began: a man denying resources to another because of caste, a maid beaten for touching food, a priest setting a lower-caste man on fire. Each person looked like they belonged to a different era. Still, I kept dancing, watching atrocities unfold in countless variations—an old woman dropping food into a maid’s hands, a father allowing his son to date only within their caste.

Suddenly, an excruciating pain tore through me. I ran to the washroom. The rash had spread across my abdomen. Then I heard it: something chewing the flesh inside me. I collapsed.

When I awoke, I was in my room. My mother told me I had fainted and been brought home. I brushed my teeth and checked the mirror. The rash was still there—in fact, it had spread.

Later, I overheard my mother talking to her sister about a WhatsApp group for people of our caste in the city. I felt sick. The chewing inside me continued, gnawing through my body. The pain was unbearable. I wanted to kill myself. I visited the doctor again. Same response. He suggested I see a psychiatrist. But I’m not psychotic.

Over the next few days, the chewing grew louder. At first, there was only pain—now there was sound as well. I tried cotton buds, headphones. Nothing worked.

One evening, despite my agony, my family decided to watch a film about casteism and honour killings. Everyone loved it. On the way home, my father said, “I don’t get it. Almost everyone is educated. Why do they follow casteism? Isn’t everyone equal?”

My mother added, “Those who follow caste are educated idiots. They don’t deserve to be called human.”

My stomach twisted in agony. I asked my parents to stop at McDonald’s so I could use the washroom. Inside, I checked myself. My torso was infected. Pus oozed from multiple places. My skin had turned grey. The pain and chewing intensified. A foul stench filled the air. I vomited and stared at myself in the mirror with disgust.

I regained control, returned to the car, and went home. I applied ointments and creams, but nothing worked. Then I overheard my parents again:

“We have our house, right? Give it to someone of our caste. Outsiders will ruin everything.”

I couldn’t take it anymore.

I went to the balcony, ready to throw myself off, but what I saw froze me: countless people below, zombie-like, muttering, segregated into groups—some higher, some lower, each clinging to their caste. My mother called my name. I turned. She looked like a zombie.

Without thinking, I grabbed a kitchen knife and drove it into her throat. My father screamed—he was a zombie too. I pulled the knife out of my mother and stabbed him again and again, twenty or thirty times, until everything went still.

But the pain didn’t stop. It grew worse, unbearable. I ran into the bathroom and began hacking off chunks of my flesh, screaming as blood covered the floor. Eventually, people burst in and dragged me away.

The next thing I remember, I was in a shabby room, dimly lit, alone. I think it’s a psychiatric ward. A man comes sometimes and tells me to write things like this down.

But I’m not psychotic.

The worst part is—it hurts, it still fucking hurts.
