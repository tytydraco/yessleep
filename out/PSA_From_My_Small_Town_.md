 Wow! I really didn’t expect you guys to take such an interest in my weird little town. Truthfully, I thought I was just shootin the shit, blowing smoke into the infinite internet. Regardless, thank you for the kind words. I was reading your comments while having yet another egg sandwich at the gas n’ munch. Funny enough, someone pointed out something I hadn’t paid no mind to before now. How DID the radio know about the horse being returned so soon? Something to think about for sure. I’d assume Mrs. Weller saw her equine pal running past the window and gave the sheriff’s station a call. I do have a little bit of an update on Mrs. Weller, though. Nothing tragic, I promise. After I’d gotten done cutting my hay for the day, I went back out to her place and knocked on the door. She invited me in and I asked her how the horse was doing. What she said confused me a little but I didn’t want to pry. She told me he was “back to center” if that rings a bell for any of you guys. I was just happy to hear it was (most likely) doing well. 

 Of course, I asked for her permission first but, here’s a little bit about Mrs. Weller. Being a gentleman, I’d never dare to ask a lady her age, but she seems to be no older than 35, and I truly mean this with no disrespect, but that woman is probably the only person I’ve ever met that I could call a hippie.I never knew the circumstances behind her becoming a widow, but through the grapevine I’d heard that she always wore her wedding bands because her husband had passed overseas fighting the good fight, and that was why she’d devoted her life to the “Peace and love” variety. But I wouldn’t take much of that too seriously. The folks that claim to know more than most about her also say this had happened back when the Vietnam war was still raging on and I can’t imagine she’s old enough to have been married to someone who’d fought in that war. 

 When I entered her home, I noticed the pleasant flowery smell with an undertone of wood-smoke. A while back I’d heard someone at the gas n’ much ask her what kind of “incense” she uses, referring to how pleasant it smelled on her clothes. Whatever that is, I’m assuming it’s where the scent was coming from. She’s a very sweet lady, very long pitch black hair, probably only standing around 5 '2". She’s always wearing flowy, floor-length skirts and absolutely never wearing shoes. Her home is covered floor to ceiling in tapestries and what I can only assume are drawings she’d done herself. Again, a kind woman indeed. 

 So, I’ve been thinking about more stories I could tell related to the PSA’s. I don’t think I’ve ever been quite as close to the content of the announcements as I was with the whole horse incident, but there is one I remember from way back that definitely stuck with me. I was just a kid, probably only 13 or so. My momma had allowed me to play outside on my own as long as I kept the handheld radio I’d gotten for Christmas with me. I was an only child, so playing pretend outside was very common for me. The soft sounds of Garth Brook’s “If Tomorrow Never Comes” trickled from the speakers. Great song, by the way. But, anyway. For whatever reason, no matter how low the volume is, the PSA’s are always loud and clear when they come through. I remember it vividly, I was making little plates and silverware with whatever clay I could dig out of the mud hole at the edge of the yard when the announcement tones abruptly cut off Brook’s words. 

 “Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a PSA for … county residents. GET INSIDE YOUR HOME NOW. GET INSIDE YOUR HOME NOW. GET INSIDE YOUR HOME NOW.” The voice was incredibly loud, almost sounding distorted against the soft hum of the cicadas. By that point, I knew to take the broadcasts very seriously, and by the first sentence, I was sprinting back up to the porch. Just before I’d reached the steps, my mother opened the slamming door, grabbed my arm and yanked me inside. She turned the deadbolt as soon as the door shut behind me and began dragging me into the kitchen where the trapdoor for the root cellar lay hidden under a rug. I remember the fear in my momma's eyes as she yanked the rug away, lifted the door, and shoved me down so hard I’d completely missed the ladder and fell the 6’ down onto the hard dirt floor at the bottom, radio screaming and warbling in my hand all the while.

 Our root cellar was pretty typical, I think. Shelves filled with fruit preserves and canned veggies. Momma had stored a couple cases of water and a spare radio down there as well. At the time, I’d figured it was set up that way for the fairly common tornadoes that came through the area. Looking back now, I don’t think that’s the kind of disaster she was planning for. Momma reached down and shut off my radio, suddenly filling the cellar with an eerie silence. This only lasted for a few seconds, though, before the buzzing started. At first, it was only a small vibration, barely audible through the dirt walls. It was a deep, electrical kind of humming that you can feel in your chest before hearing with your ears. Nothing like the humming of mosquitoes or cicadas I was used to in the summer months. I would almost say it was more like a groan, or growl. Soon, the noise grew to the point that it was shaking dirt from the walls. Momma was sharp as a tack, though. Before the settling silt had the chance to fill our little shelter with dust, she’d poured some water on a couple stray tea towels left on the shelves and pressed it against my nose and mouth. God bless that woman, because while I could hardly bear the sound, hands pressed tightly against my ears, she used both hands to hold the rags against our faces while the worst of it passed. 

 It had been hours before the noises had settled. After the worst of it died down a bit, she turned the radio back on and allowed the soothing sounds of George Strait and Merle Haggard to fill the little room we sat in. I didn’t dare bombard my mother with questions at the time, as I could tell she was already very stressed out. It was the first time I’d ever seen an adult show fear and uncertainty. For days we stayed in that cellar, a dull hum providing constant background noise behind the four hour loop of country songs that played on the radio. I could feel the weight of the situation weighing down on me, unsure of how long we’d have to stay there. Momma held me nearly the whole time, clearly and heavily burdened by this turn of events. I worried for our goats out by the septic pond, meant to eat the grass around the swampy parts we couldn’t mow without getting the mower stuck. But, after the three days that felt like months, a new broadcast finally came across the radio. 

 “Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a PSA for … county residents. The storm has passed. It is now safe to leave your homes. God bless.” The announcer almost sounded out of breath, exhausted at least. When we exited the cellar, our home was the same on the inside. I had fixated on the health of our poor goats outside, and as we climbed the ladder out onto the floor of the kitchen, I made my way to the back door, undid the deadbolt and made my way out to their pen. We had five at the time, but I only saw two from afar as I ran towards them. My favorite goat, one I’d named Mr. Hooves, was still standing as he bleated loudly at me. I pet his rough fur, not yet noticing the grass around them that had turned completely black. Not like a fire had come through our land, but like someone had poured black dye onto the blades. I remember hearing murmurs of how the harvest was completely ruined. But the next year, the land provided a bountiful harvest. Apparently enough to make up for the lost profits of the year before. 

 The one thing I will never forget, though, as momma drove us through town, was the little mountains of ash that lay on the sidewalk beside the roads, bright white bones protruding from their centers. I couldn’t help but notice the lack of homeless folks around afterwards. 

 Scuse’ me folks, I’m starting to hear a scratching noise above me and I’m getting worried the squirrels have found their way back into the attic. I’m sure I’ll be back, but for now I spose I need to grab the broom and get back to my simple little life.
