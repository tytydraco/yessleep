Being estranged from my family, I wasn’t sure how to feel after the passing of who I knew as my maternal grandmother. She was the only grandmother I had ever met. I have never met or known anything of my paternal extended family and my father never spoke of them. For the duration of this, I will be calling him “Alex” instead of “my father”, as I have done since I was 16. I always assumed Alex was estranged from his family himself in a long passed and messy way that he never cared to linger on. That was strange, especially given his erratic temperament that at times led him to manically confide information to my child self that I’m not quite sure I wanted to know at my young age. More on this later. But he never spoke of his family. This was always a bizarre mystery, and one of the many gnawing things left without closure that seemed to always bother me years past our separation. 

Six months ago, I got a call from my grandmother’s friend. She informed me with no softening words that my grandmother had died and that my mother was too sick now to come and deal with the house and the animals. I did not know my mother was sick. I hadn’t spoken a word to her in three years. I was too stunned to ask any further questions, and also not sure if I cared to know the answers. I hung up and soon decided I would fly down to my old home state of Mississippi to go through her possessions. I thought I could plan an estate sale. I recall as a kid, she had a lot of nice and expensive looking things in her two-story country side home, and as a remote freelance artist, I needed the money. I booked a flight from my small but open world in Woodstock, New York to the dim and confusing town I grew up in. After a foul red-eye, I found myself again in a dissociated landscape of gravel roads and muddy creeks and ditches, a sweltering mountainside where every structure, from the thick oaks of the woods to the white paneled rotting houses amongst them, was utterly colonized by slithering kudzu vines. 

My ride pulled up to my grandmother’s house soon enough. It was like a white, pristine statue compared to many of the rundown homes we’d driven past. This area had only gotten worse since I’d left, but her house stood tall nonetheless, with its old-fashioned porch swing and its window boxes looking out on the gravel driveway that severely reflected the hot sun in its whiteness. I got out and walked to the porch mat as the Uber turned around over the crunching rocks. The window in the door was dark and I couldn’t see anything. I went to open the door, but the knob halted itself. The door was locked. I stood for a moment with my hands in my pockets, bounding on my heels a little with a slight anxiety, until I remembered that she always kept a key under the mat. I bent down to uncover the concrete porch and I found a little key laying there. I used it to unlock the door and I went inside.

The first thing I registered after the specks of dust caught in the filtering light from the doorway against the golden wood of the illuminated floors was a horrible smell, a sickening smell. I immediately hunched over, covered my mouth and nearly gagged. It was cat shit… and something else. It smelled of death. It’s something you know when you smell it, a smell you never forget. I remember it when Alex made me go hunting with him and I was forced to kill a deer. I remember his hurried whispers in the trees to “shoot, now! Before it goes away!” I was just a boy, eight or so. It was a “bad kill”, as he called it. As we approached, the animal was whimpering in agony and blood was tricking from its side into a pool on the dirt that stuck and smudged on its brown fur as it struggled to stand up again and again until that whimper turned into a shriek that is still one of the most horrific noises I have ever heard and could never be so fortunate as to forget. Alex had me shoot it in the head after that. When he had me try to skin the deer, despite me being inconsolable, I remembered how it smelled. No, it’s not just like the smell of a corpse, or the smell of blood. It is the distinct smell of a life that has been lost from a body that was clinging to it for a time. I smelled that in the house. I composed myself as I had to do when I skinned that deer and I walked in the kitchen. 

I stepped into a scene of terror. Feces and urine were all about the room. And flies were swarming around two dead cat corpses in the corner. There was one other grey cat on the other side of the kitchen still alive, weakly dragging itself across the floor and meowing dreadfully. It was starving. I was appalled as I had never been before in my entire life. The flies swarmed on the two corpses of the orange cats in nauseating clusters of squirming black. I looked away in horror and my mind turned to the dying cat scraping itself forward on its stomach. I quickly opened the fridge and found lunch meat and started giving it to the cat, which it gladly fed on ravenously (Sorry cat people if they can’t eat lunch meat or something). I had to portion it in bits at a time to keep it from choking itself from eating so fast. I grabbed a bowl and filled it with water from the faucet. I had no idea what to do, but I got the hell out of that room as fast as I could. I was on the porch again. No one had come to take care of the cats? Surely it would’ve arranged for them to be taken care of if someone came over to clean up my grandmother’s body. I supposed she could’ve died elsewhere, I didn’t know, but at least her friend that called knew she had animals. 

There was a Dollar General I noticed around the corner on the way here, which was a new thing. I walked down there in the sweltering heat, absolutely drenching my shirt in sweat, and picked up some cheap cat food, cleaning supplies, and fly traps. I was exhausted, and walking long distances is something that has always been extremely hard for me. I am very flat footed and I was born with a malformation where my toes have thick webbing between them. I was exempt from gym class for it. I have some minor webbing between my fingers too, but it’s not super noticeable. When I came back, I put on a mask and, denying every instinct in my body, stepped back into the house. I put on gloves and used the broom to get the two corpses into a trash bag and took them to the dumpster. I set out traps for the flies, and fed the gray cat a can of dollar store cat food. He didn’t have a name tag and I still don’t know what sex he is, but I call him Rat.

I tried to wash away my disturb with a long shower and a quiet two days that I spent deeply scrubbing the kitchen and cleaning and dusting the house. My feet were howling with pain at the end of the days. It was hard to keep my balance. The house was full of fine things I could sell: china cabinets, paintings from well-known artists, nice jewelry. Maybe it sounds odd or offensive to some of you that I was so eager to sell everything and take the money. The truth is that no one else cared or could do anything else with it, and if you knew– and you will– the context of my family and I, you wouldn’t give a shit either. I went back to the store and got poster board, wire, etc. to make estate sale signs I would put around the area. I got color coded tags and stickers to price the belongings with. I figured I’d just set everything up nicely and have people come in and browse the rooms. 

It was strange to unlimitedly search another’s home and know all of their possessions. She had a lot of family heirlooms and classic American literature. I was actually surprised by the lack of anything incriminating. Most people have something in their closets they’d loathe others to find after their passing, but she was squeaky clean as you’d expect an old woman with a flowery home to be from the surface. I tried hard to find family photos. I had never seen any besides my parents’ old yearbook pictures and some wedding pictures. There was nothing, no stale photo album books or famed portraits. I tried to find any journals my grandmother may have had within her collections of books to clue me in on a personal life beneath her pure, caring facade she always had. She sounds lovely from that sparse description which is distorted with simplicity. In reality, the truth was reminded to me again and again in intrusive memories as I went through her house and smelled the rooms. It just didn’t make any sense. I found no dirt anywhere or skeletons in her closets when I knew full well there were, though the exact nature of them I did not know.

I said those days I spent cleaning were quiet, but they weren’t rejuvenating as I had hoped. In the shower, as I washed myself and stared at her shampoo bottles she always used, I heard her in my ear telling me I was so grown now, a beautiful man, that I shouldn't have left the family and regarded the sacredness of bloodlines with such disrespect. I was too old to believe in ghosts, it’s just a figure of my thoughts. I closed my eyes and clutched my wet body to find peace. But I was transported into a memory of me in my teenage body, starving, and my grandmother beckoning me to her chair. She was undoing her blouse as she took out her breast. I looked away and cringed. *It’s natural*, I heard. *My hungry boy*—

I ripped open the shower curtain and got out as fast as I could. 

It is hard to type this. It’s even harder to say just that. But I need to get this out there. While I still can. Especially what happened last summer at that house, what happens next.

I needed to do one last thing: clean out the attic. Oddly, I was not expecting anything interesting to come of it. I just thought I’d find Christmas decor and travel supplies or something normal. I unsurely climbed up its unstable, haphazardous ladder. Rat stood at the base and meowed for me over and over. “I fed you! What do you want?” I said, but he kept meowing until I picked him up and had to make a second trip up that rickety ladder. I was afraid with my lack of balance that came with my webbed feet that were flat as a board. It was a high ceiling and the drop was a twelve foot drop from the top at least. The Rat Cat had followed me around sometimes since we became acquainted after he was nourished, but he was strangely clingy when I went into the attic. I reached into the darkness and found a chain that switched on the lights when I tugged it. I was prepared to see a mess of cobwebs, dust, and trash bags, but I was taken aback. It was spotlessly clean in there, and I saw no dust, not even any floating in the illumination of the crescent window. 

The attic was a pristine haven. Its hardwood floor was clear of debris, and to the side of the room were small horizontal shelves of books– books unmarked on the spines. There was a large leather chest next to each of the two shelves that sat parallel to each other. There was then, at the center of the room underneath the window, a large black safe with a silver rotating handle and a set of four spinning numbers that sat at ‘0-0-0-0’. When I saw this safe, I thought first to myself that there was no way I wasn’t going to find a way to get this thing open. But before that, I had to explore this excellent new collection of information. This could be very promising. On one of the shelves, to the left, there were many of what looked like binders with spines of pastel fabric. And then on the other shelf, to the right, there were several unlabeled hardcovers and leather-bound books– journals. I crouched on the floor next to the shelf on the left and pulled out the first binder. This one, unlike the others, was made of a decaying black fabric. There was nothing on its rugged cover, but when I opened it, numbers were gracefully jotted down in pen: ‘1935-1939’. Turning the cover, on its thick pages photos were taped. It was a photo album, at last! Though older than I thought was relevant to me at the time. But it was all too relevant. 1935 was a long time ago. I didn’t even know what these could contain. Was it just a sort of history project, I thought. 

But the first photo I saw confirmed interest. It was a black and white photo, a portrait. Of a man. It was a little disturbing actually. He had a long face, and though some people might say it had something handsome about it, it had these bushy black eyebrows that couldn’t help but remind of that ‘HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN IN YOUR DREAMS?’ photo that was going viral a few years ago. He was wearing what was probably a grey suit. Underneath the photo, in pretty eloquent handwriting which I identified as my grandmother’s, it read 'Father. 1935 (?)'

Her father, my great-grandfather. I didn’t know anything about him, so this was quite a surprise. I was already overstimulated almost at this, but then the photo album kept going. On the next page was a photo of a city street. It looked like the older parts of a downtown area, with tall, factory-like, stone and brick buildings with lots of windows. There were buggies, streetcars, and a lot of people walking around in suits and sometimes pale trench coats, some with briefcases and some on bicycles. There were plenty of signs, giant letters installed near the top on a building or flat signs above the slanted awnings of the lower businesses. Some of these signs were just names of businesses, maybe last names, but others seemed to be in a different Germanic language. And it was pretty obvious what that language was when I saw the thing in the image that stuck out like a sore thumb, truthfully the first thing that I saw: a banner of the Nazi flag hanging vertically from the side of a shop, clear as the sky, the only thing in the visual of the bustling city that wasn’t complicated. 

The caption read, 'Father, bottom left. 1930s Berlin.' Surely, as my eyes traveled to the bottom left of the photograph, there was a sleek tall man in a suit, staring forward with the same thick brow furrowed at the sunlight. This was insane to me. Was he from Germany? From then? Why had she never mentioned this? I turned the page, out of my mind, nervous for the next layer of shock. 

It was not a photograph this time. It was a letter. It was written in lengthy cursive writing, grand with swooping lines, yet the actual letters were almost too dainty to read. I read the caption first this time. 'Letter to my mother from my father. 1936.' On the page next to it was a clipping from an envelope, which had the address of the sender and the destination. It was from Berlin to Stockholm, Sweden.

I began to read the letter. 

“Dear Esmeralda,

Your presence, though far from me, I sense often and greatly ache to be near to. Every evening I place your letters under my pillow so that I can smell the perfume you spray them with as I fall asleep. Then I hope for sweet dreams of you when I close my eyes. Sometimes they do come, like a gift from the essence of love. Though many nights, I am not so fortunate, and instead I have nightmares of the growing attitudes against my people prevailing, and the taking of my family, the peril they would suffer, and lastly, my own imprisonment. The Nuremberg laws are in full-swing to say the least, and if you were a resident of Germany yourself, with your gorgeous pale hair and eyes, I would be subjected to God knows what for loving you as the 'mixed-breed’ that I am. I thank God often for your safety. But I can tell where this goes. Regardless of the present, if I stay here, I will die. But I am not afraid, no. You and I will be together soon, my darling. I am arranging a plan with others whom I used to worship with. Sweden will be our refuge. We will have our own home! In our new little world, I will hold you at last, and we shall mingle our warmth together amidst the white snow of the mountains!

Your longing lover,

Theodor Berkowitz”

I closed the book. I sat in silence for a long while, trying to process what I had read. The Rat was scratching at the chest on the right side. I assumed he was just doing that thing cats do where they scratch stuff, I guess. The shock came in waves for sometime before I was overtaken with confusion, which then culminated into an immediate drive to know more. I gently placed the binder back, ready to explore the next one. 

The white silk cover was yellowed with age. From a paper inserted through a window in the cover, it read '1948-1953'. I opened it, bursting with curiosity. The pages were thick off-white plastic with flimsy clear pockets that were often torn on one side or two, allowing the photos to slip out and between the pages freely. From 1948. My grandmother was 75 when I was 15, and I'm 25 now, so she died at 85. 85 years ago was 1940. So she was born then, and this album was from when she was ages 8 to 13. 

The first photo was a picture of a family. The tallest standing was the father again, Theodor, the bushy eyebrowed man now delicately graced with age, a pair of silver wired glasses, and a delightful smile that wrinkled his cheeks. It was one that almost made him unrecognizable if it weren’t for the eyebrows. Next to him was a small, soft woman with a small nose and lips and straight white hair. She had white eyelashes rimming her round but sharp eyes. Esmeralda. And below them both, she had her hand upon the shoulder of a bright-eyed young girl with silky loose curls. The caption simply read, 'Family portrait. 1948.' It was fascinating to see her so young, my grandma, her face smooth and small, her little nose, her eyelids open and unconcealed by wrinkles. I turned to the next page and another family portrait, where they were in the same clothes, but there were many more people to the right of Esmeralda. Two men, and a solemn old woman. The caption was the same, but I supposed from the gentlemens’ light, maybe golden hair, that they must be the extended family of the mother. There was no one on the left side of the father.

The next photo that was revealed was of just two people. This one was outside. The trees were full of leaves, and I saw the girl that was my grandmother but she looked slightly older. There was a man next to her and they were sitting on a bench. I quickly recognized this man as one of the men from the second family portrait. His face was serious and his eyes were disengaged and devoid of emotion. They were dead eyes. But what was extremely disturbing about this photo was that as my grandmother sat in her summer dress, the man’s hand was far up her inner leg in a manner that was too intimate to be a simple display of familial affection. The caption read, “Uncle Gunnar and I. 1950.” 

I was absolutely disgusted and I closed the book. I sat in silence again. Rat scratched at the right chest still and meowed. I softly hushed it. 

I was a little set off by it, and almost annoyed at myself that I wanted to keep going. But I couldn’t help it. All of the things I had always wanted to know were coming clear now, and there was so much more to discover. Maybe that was the worst of it, I thought. Now, as I type this part, I am having to return to the keyboard between hysterical bits of laughter at myself. Especially that last sentence. 

I decided I didn’t want to see anymore of that album, and I slid out and looked at the covers down the shelf one by one. I skipped quite a few of the albums before I found the years '1975-1985'. My mother was born in 1976.

I flipped through this one more. Lots of maternity photos and the handsome man who was my grandpa I never got to meet. He was blonde-headed like my grandmother, and he looked quite a bit younger than her. See, she must have been 35 when she had my mother, and this man looked to be in his early to mid twenties. He was the one person my grandma did let me see when I was a kid. I even thought then that he looked a lot younger than her in their wedding photos. My grandmother was a pretty woman then and she looked very happy to be pregnant, with a big, white, glossy smile. A great contrast to her depressing expression that flashed in my mind from the photo of her with her uncle. I shivered and kept going. I saw a photo of a young boy clutching her pregnant stomach, the back of his glistening bowl cut. I couldn’t see his face, but he may have been five years old from the height. I assumed this was a cousin or something. But then there was another family portrait, actually the first photo I had seen so far that was in color. 

'Family Portrait. 1981.' The image was bursting with primary colors and almost overstimulated my eyes that had become accustomed to the greyscale photos. Crimped golden hair and blue-tinted eyeshadow, that big smile colored with a rosy lip gloss. My grandmother stood next to my grinning, fresh-faced grandfather. Two children were below them. A young boy with a golden bowl cut in blue suspenders that lined his red and yellow vertically striped shirt, and at his side, he held the hand of a girl who looked five years old, probably five years younger than him. She was my mother, but she looked so innocent and small in her pale blue dress. Her eyes squinted with an awkward and clearly forced smile and I think I almost laughed. But I remembered how I was broken about her, or at least I used to be, and I was serious again. 

But this boy… he was not a cousin. It was a brother. I knew it. My grandmother had her arms gently clasped around his shoulders. My mother didn’t have a brother. I didn’t understand. I studied this boy’s face because something was interesting about it, and I knew it was because his features resembled someone I knew, and it kind of bothered me. But I couldn’t figure out who it was, because it was more than just him looking like my grandma or mother. I was weirdly disturbed by it. Then I looked at the next photo, from years later, and the worst terror I had ever experienced in my life thus far came to me. 

The boy and my own mother were standing next to each other in front of a Christmas tree. They both looked much older, the boy a teenager now. At once his face was frighteningly familiar, and my mind was jumping through several revolting trains of thought that were so plentiful and erratic not one coherent sentiment came of them but the feeling of fear and a churning nausea. And all was horrifically confirmed when I read that caption. 

'Alex and Pearl. Christmas 1985.'

I closed the album and threw it across the room, startling Rat. No... Brother and sister. My dad and my mom. My dad and my mom are brother and sister. And I…

Rat walked over to me gently and meowed. He started licking my arm. I started sobbing. And I got this fucking memory. Alex… he was running around the house painting the rooms bright red. He bent down and stared at me with a look of crazy in his eyes and demanded I help. It was late at night and my mom stood in the doorway of the dining room in her robe, begging him to come to bed. But he was in one of his episodes, and he would not. He told her to shut up. I cried and he yelled at me to start painting like he asked. He shoved a brush in my hand. I sobbed as I painted. He laughed and said that I had no idea how important this was that we paint. He said I would find out soon. My mom didn’t ‘shut up’. and she pleaded with him to stop this. He screamed at her to leave the house until she was sobbing just like me. I think I asked him why he was being so mean to Mommy. 

“Because she’s a slut! A lying one! She has crabs, you know! She gave me crabs! She fucked somebody else and sacrileged this family!” My mother sobbed even louder.

“What are crabs?” I asked. Dad screamed at me that I had stopped painting, and why did I stop painting. I would’ve followed this corporeal image deeper into its mad darkness and hopelessness. If it weren’t for Rat meowing and meowing, louder and louder and I inhaled sharply, breaking up the shattered breaths I was taking. I opened my eyes and recoiled at the light. 

Now this time I was really done. I grabbed the cat and went down the ladder, careful as I was before but halfway not wanting to be. I went to the pantry off of the kitchen and I sat against the wall inside the small, dark room. I closed the door. I hugged myself like I used to do when I hid in my old closet. Soon, after a while of rocking back and forth, I stood up carefully, and felt for the bottle of whisky I had seen on the shelf. I brought it down to me. I started taking many big gulps at once, and I dissociated while doing so, so that when I was done I had no idea how many gulps I could have taken or how long I was chugging. I just tasted the noxious flavor in my whole mouth and felt the fire warming my throat and filling my empty stomach. I sat for a little longer and ruminated on the general sensation of disbelief and bodily terror before I started laughing. Big, gluttonous loads of laughter from my stomach, and I fell to the side, my head hit the canned goods on the floor and I turned to face the ceiling that I could not see in the dark. Maybe the ceiling wasn’t even there. Maybe it was the sky, and the sky was not a sky, but it was actually nothing. And I realized that the only thing I could be certain of at this moment was that I existed. Anything else could be an illusion, and every memory could be a false one. The only thing I know for certain is that I am thinking, and I can feel my body as the limp, heavy thing that it is, and the unnatural feeling of having four limbs. I jolted up suddenly. I leaned over in a movement that felt abhorrently unnatural and took off my socks.

I ran my fingers over the webbing in my feet, the little bones trapped in a suffocating binding of thick skin and I started laughing even harder. I started stomping the wall with my feet. And then I stopped. As though my emotions shut off except a dull, self-destructive fascination. I found the bottle again with my spidery hands and drank some more. Then I opened the door. I was stricken by the dim kitchen light, but the window behind it was dark. I don't know what time it was when I went in, but it was light outside, and now it was pitch black. I couldn't even see the stars in the blackness against the kitchen light. I crawled out, smiling, and then I went into the living room, where the ladder was. A disturbingly, curiously long, brittle ladder. I walked towards it and started climbing. On the third or fourth step, I fell down onto my back on the hardwood floor. I felt nothing and I got back up to try again. And then Rat was at my feet meowing. I stopped. I smiled and bent down, petting and doting over him. “Sweet one, you don’t even know that none of it matters,” I said something like that.

I must admit to you now, that I started drinking at some point into writing this, because it was becoming too much to bear within the coldness of my sober mind. I couldn’t stop wincing and my stomach wouldn’t stop churning, so here I am. 

I was wearing a hoodie, so I tucked the hoodie into my jeans and I slipped the cat into my hoodie but in front of my shirt. He was oddly okay with this ridiculous arrangement. I walked up the steps more carefully this time, actually experiencing a slight fear, but much less than I would have if I was sober. When I got into the attic, I unleashed the cat through the top of my hoodie onto the floor before I was in, nearly falling backwards and surely cracking my head on the stone fireplace in the process.

I crawled in and cased the room, as eerily clean as before, with the binder I threw strewn open on the floor at the far wall. I stationed myself at the shelf on the right and pulled out one of those leather-back journals. Between its pages was actually one of those orange manilla folders. I pulled that out first and haphazardly dumped its contents on the floor. Papers sprang out and hit the ground, falling on top of themselves. I picked them up, and identified them as medical records, which had my mother’s name in the top right-hand corner: Pearl Eaten. I decided then I should try to put them back in order, which I managed to do. Much of the first two pages were mundane, until the year 2000, when I was born. This was detailed, and then in 2001, I found something that shocked me. I scanned a particular visit that was documented and glanced at the phrase “cancerous tumors”. I tried to jump back and find it, but my head was starting to spin, and the page kept whirling around my vision in taunting circles that threatened to sicken me. But in the simply labeled 'Diagnostic Impressions:' I read next to a code, 'Malignant Neoplasm of Bilateral Ovaries'. Cancer!

This was made all the more wild when after the pages of chemotherapy documentation, there was at last surgical papers of a prescribed procedure. She had a hysterectomy. I had always wondered why I never had any brothers and sisters, and now I knew. When I had pestered her about it as a kid, she always shrunk into herself with a look of shame, and so I stopped asking. I never knew about this. Why did she never tell me? Why?

I started reading the journal now. I didn’t start at the beginning though, I started at the page the manilla folder had been bookmarking. It was an entry from 2003. I have no clue what the date was. I couldn’t begin to tell you precisely what it said because I can’t remember the wording and I was too drunk to do more than skimming it. But I can tell you the gist. She said that she was devastated that my Mom opted for the hysterectomy. I swear she may have said she'd rather the illness "take its course than for her to have done such a betrayal to her womanhood”. She lamented the fact she herself didn’t have more children. She cursed herself for it. My mother should’ve had another child, it said. A girl. My mother should have allowed the blood of our family to extend another generation. My stomach twisted in sudden nausea and I dropped the journal. I think I started laughing again. And gagging.

She wanted me to have a sister. She wanted me to have a sister so that we could… She wanted to continue this incestuous tradition into a fucked up inbred family line. Intrusive images flashed in me as I writhed with intense sickness and deep disgust. I won’t describe most of the images here, but you can imagine. I pictured me holding a small child with webbed hands and webbed feet and a tail. It had my face on it, except a repulsive, reddened cyclops eye that spewed malignant acid when it sobbed from the pain it was in from just existing.

And then I projectile vomited clear, acidic bile onto the floor, it splattered in every direction, even specks hitting my cheeks and my eye. It stung. I layed back now. My hair fell and hung down from the entrance of the attic. I think I heard Rat licking up some of the bile, which for some reason I appreciated, but I did lean back up and grab him. I felt strangely peaceful. But also strangely self-destructive, well, not necessarily. Rather, I didn’t care if self-destruction was the byproduct of knowing. I wanted to know the full extent. I wanted to know how deep it goes. I picked the journal back up and read the next entry. My head was no longer spinning. 

“I wish it were a myth, the menopause. I am no longer a woman. But I am the last hope. My daughter cannot bear another child. If I was still young, I could have the boy myself when he grows up. Instead he will one day come to muddy the purity of what two generations passionately built by fertilizing another woman. Outside of the family. Love is not supposed to be this way. Love is within the family. Family is all that is true.”

 I stopped reading and closed the book, my hands lingering on the cover, expressionless. Feeling not much. I am very drunk now, writing this. You’ll forgive me, right. I’ll edit it later. Rat was scratching at that chest again, so I crawled over, avoiding the massive sprawling puddle of viscous, translucent vomit. I unbuckled its brown leather straps. An immense sticky, moldy smell hit me in the face like a cloud of invisible gas. I could fucking taste it. I looked in there and I saw a bunch of mason jars, some with this sticky looking substance dripping down the sides. There were also these stones in there with these arrangements of lines on each one. They were all unique line arrangements on each one, and when I saw them, they plucked out a memory I hadn't thought of in years and years! When I was 16, after my grandma’s nurturing came to an unnerving extreme, I stopped going over. She grossed me out. She kept sending me letter upon letter, and I never opened a single one. I returned them all until she stopped sending them. But I felt very uneasy after that, like I was being watched sometimes. I heard motion in the bushes outside of my window sometimes and found things moved around slightly in my room, even objects that I had never seen before like new stuffed animals or digital alarm clocks placed on my dresser. Then one day I found one of those stones at my bedside. I think I took it to the lake and threw it as far as I could. These were the exact kind of stones! 

I lifted up one of those loathsome jars without as much reluctance as I should’ve had, and it was full of honey. That’s what this stickiness was, and from the smell and the brown speckles of powder I saw inside, I knew there was cinnamon. A fuzzy white colony of mold built up on the surface of the concoction in a thick cylinder. There was a browned decaying apple slice inside, and a tiny piece of paper, a picture. I quickly turned the jar to show the light in the ceiling, and I was horrified to find that it was a picture of me, my senior year yearbook picture. And there I was! Smiling my stupid smile as I had no idea I was in an old lady’s molding witch jar! An old lady who was my grandma, and a witch jar she was probably using to– 

I dropped the jar, which I probably meant to set it down but was too immobilized to do so, and it fell on top of a couple other jars, and some of them broke. The smell was unbearable now as it wafted from the jars and infringed on my nostrils. I leaned back. Rat was standing and smelling into the chest, about to leap in, and I sprang forward to grab him. On the inside of the top of the chest that hung above it, there were many symbols carved which I did not recognize. And then carved was a sort of incantation:

“With all the power bestowed in me

Make my lover come to me

By the blessings of divinity

It will be so, so mote it be”

I just closed the chest after that. I hugged myself and squinted my eyes. I protected my stomach with my legs and my neck with my knees. I rocked back and forth. Then I layed down on the hard floor in a fetal position. After awhile of laying like this, I fell asleep. And everything was gone. And thoughts are not not thoughts and there was no knowledge, only dark, and I was not afraid.

Then I woke up. It was either two hours later or twenty-four hours later, I couldn’t tell, but it was just as black and cold though the window. I knew where I was immediately and I knew what I was. I was something more vile than I could describe to you. The description I would’ve given myself then, and still would now to be honest, is more heartbreaking to type than any of this has been thus far. I didn’t want to exist after this. My existence was disgusting. It is horrifying. And I’ll just leave it all that, because the extent this is true is unimaginable, even by myself. 

The cat was curled next to me and I stoked its fur. Soon I sat up and scanned the dreadful state of the room. Books and medical records were strewn about the floor and there was a big puddle of vomit with horrid tendrils of splatter around it. And the chest was still open, with the rotting contents of the shattered jars mingling at the bottom. At least one picture of me was floating in it as well. I turned to the other chest that I knew was in there, on the left side. It looked just like the other one. My mind wandered to what might be in there and my stomach knotted. Was it more jars? Nothing could surprise me now, I thought, or actually was just trying to convince myself. So I crept towards it, and then as if to prove to myself that I wasn’t afraid, I came to it quicker and undid the latches without reluctance. As I swung open the lid, I saw that it was full of photographs. Full nearly to the brim. All of the ones that I could see on top were of none other than me.

My mouth dropped as if to scream but I made no sound. I placed my hand inside and I drew up a photograph of me. Only this was not just any photograph. This was a yearbook picture or vacation photo or anything like that. This was a photo of me in my bedroom that I had never seen before. It was obviously taken through the blinds of my window. I looked like I was fifteen. I was resting on my bed in a t-shirt and boxers on my phone. Now I shrieked and sprang back as if it were now and someone had been filming me through the attic window. But then I went back and looked through picture after picture of me, many in my bedroom. Somewhere through the window and some were clearly taken from the inside, only these were moments when I was alone. They were from cameras in my room! Those random objects I would find that would appear, they had cameras in them! 

Then there were photos of me hanging out with friends at their houses through the window. Me at the library doing the homeschool work my mom assigned to me, thinking I was getting away from the madness when it was really lurking right outside in the trees. I felt so sorry for myself. I could feel myself fixing to try and grab the Me in the photograph’s attention. To save him from what he was oblivious to. The worst thing in that fucking chest was a photo that has made me feel more violated than any of all of this thus far. It was a photo of me in my car with my first girlfriend at night. Our naked silhouettes undressed and against each other. Her hair, her body. My head tilted down watching her, my mouth open. My world shattered. One of the most prized memories I have, now crushed by disgust. 

I screamed now. But this time it wasn’t one of terror but of anger. There was a fire burning in my body that had nothing to destroy but my own insides and I clawed at myself and my clothes trying to release it but all that happened was scorching pain inside and then the tearing of my fingernails into my skin until I broke down sobbing a furious, messy, screaming sob onto the floor. 

I ripped up the photo and tossed it to scatter its fragments around the room. I slammed the chest shut and and then hugged my knees in an upright fetal position as I stared at the last thing in that attic. The safe.

I wasn’t even thinking about money now. I was thinking about the last of it. The last thing. Finishing what I had started. My body’s will to stop this was unfathomably strong and it came fighting with my waves of nausea, my tears, and my fierce fits of screaming and laughter. But my prideful will to know and drive for completion was far stronger. And I stood up on both my feet and faced the lock on that hefty tank of a safe. I had no idea what the code would be.

But I did find what I was after soon enough. I am exceeding the character limit now, so I will write the rest tomorrow. Thanks to those who have read this far. I am going to go.
