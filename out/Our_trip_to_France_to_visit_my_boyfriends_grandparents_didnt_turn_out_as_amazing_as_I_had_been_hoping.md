I had been looking forward to it so much- the French countryside! French food! Visiting a real French farm! I had started practising French- well, since I started dating Nicholas, but as our long-promised trip grew nearer, with renewed fervour.

And finally, we were here! Everything so far had been up to expectation- the two nights in Paris, the sightseeing, the train rides, and now, at the farm. It was my first trip to Europe, and I drank everything in with delight. Nicholas had been more restrained, putting on a worldly look which rather annoyed me. But as the train got closer to the little town closest to his grandparents' place, he seemed to mellow out.

As indeed he should have been. The fields were like postcards. We arrived late afternoon, and Grandpere, took us out on a little tour of his land. The setting sun hit the lush green vegetable gardens just right, and the frothy leaves lit up in jade and emerald.

Grand-père grunted. “You’re not going to get flavours like these in America! Only MacDonalds there!” His pastoral accent was heavier than what I had noticed from a few videocalls we had and I smiled politely- despite my valiant efforts to learn French before our trip, I could pick up only the rough sense of what he was saying. I stole a glance at Nicholas- he was suppressing the urge to roll his eyes, and correct his grandfather that he lived in Canada.

It was a timeless dance, as he had described to me, since his childhood, when he used to spend summers at the farm with them. Grandfather bashed Americans and waxed lyrical about French fruits and vegetables, and Nicholas nodded, counting the days he could leave. He had decided at an early age that he refused to make the superiority of French turnips his identity.

But the food was amazing. Right? Holding my hand, we followed Grand-père into the ancient stone farmhouse, where the French feast of *pot-au-feu* with those amazing farm-grown vegetables, crusty baguettes, and red wine awaited us, just as their ancestors would have it.

But Grand-père was angry. As we spread bone marrow on the torn bread, flavoured only with salt and just a touch of horseradish, he ranted about government subsidies. I could see from Nicholas’s slight frown that even he had difficulty following his grandfather’s French, filled with farming jargon.

“… we will show them- our tractors blocked the country last year - we need more fertilizer- *du sang noire*\- traitors in Paris telling us how much should be using -what do they know about our vegetables - only 100 kilos this year- are you fucking kidding me I said to the Association- just my leeks need 45 kilos *d’engrais noire*\- I can’t miss the season, already too late-

My brain twitched.

In careful English Grand-mère asked me, “Are you sure you drink wine?”

I nodded. Grand-mère looked at Nicholas “She drinks wine?” she asked in French

Nicholas grabbed the wine bottle and poured for me, and I gratefully took a huge sip. Grand-mère looked scandalised. I reminded myself there was a good reason why Nicholas had insisted we only stay for a night.

Grand-père stopped ranting, and turned to me. Unable to bear his blue gaze, I cast my eyes down on my plate of boiled vegetables.

He reached out his thick workworn hand, and lightly touched my cheek. I flinched – it felt as though he had struck me.

 “*Assez noire.*” He smiled.

My eyes grew wide, as uncertainty, offense and fear filled my heart. Assez *what* now? I turned to Nicolas, telegraphing a little panic. He looked at Grand-mère, who was loudly chewing a bit of gristle.

 “Can we go to our room?” he asked in English.

Grand-mère jolted out of her chewing reverie. “Of course, *mes petits*! Come, come! All that travel!”

After she showed us the room- the same room Nicholas had spent his summers in, she left us, smiling and saying Bon soir. We sat side by side on the bed, not saying anything. I felt discombobulated by the travel, the language, and the comments.

After a while we got up. It was dark, his grandparents would have gone to bed, we were sure. We slowly went back downstairs to fetch our suitcases.

A scraping sound wafted up the stairs- his grandparents weren’t in bed?

*Scrape scrape.*

A dim light spilled from the kitchen. And we both saw - Grand-père sharpening a knife.

Without needing to say a word, we turned, dashed back upstairs. We grabbed our backpacks, and slid out into the hallway.

He was waiting at the bottom of the stairs.

“Leave her Nicholas. We need the blood. For the farm, it needs dark blood.” It seemed like suddenly a switch had turned on in my brain and I could perfectly understand what he said.

He took a step up. Nicholas stepped in front of me and we both clattered down towards him. I screamed as a pair of hands shoved me from behind, and I started falling towards Grand-père’s sharp knife.

Twisting my neck, I saw Grand-père above me.

She didn’t follow us down.

Nicholas swung his backpack as I fell against him. Grand-père grunted as it caught the side of his head. As he stumbled and fell off balance, Nicholas swung again, and we were able to dash by him, and run to the door.

Fiddling with the heavy locked door took seemed to take an eternity. Grand-père stood up and lunged towards. I deflected him with another swing of the backpack, and finally Nicholas was able to shove the door open. We ran out into the warm dark, heavily scented with the smell of flourishing vegetables, running, running towards the road.  

I looked back. The silhouettes of Grand-père and Grand-mère stood backlit in the doorway, as still as a painting. They made no attempt to chase us, just stood there watching as we ran, ran down, away, and towards the town.
