Hello again, r/nosleep. My coworkers and I were glad to have a decent amount of you respond to the initial post, [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ilpqrk/my_manager_had_a_spinal_infection_that_spread_to/), with some sound advice. Thank you to all who gave it to us. 

It's been about a month since I posted and a lot has happened. I kept notes and journal entries throughout that time so I wouldn't forget anything. I will try not to leave any details out as I recount them to you now.

Two days after I posted here, I followed the advice of some of the commenters and called Helen’s bosses when I went into work. Their response was for me to get Helen to go to the hospital, and if she didn’t she would get fired. I checked her schedule and she was supposed to work that whole week, but she never showed. The higher ups were starting to get pissed and wanted to cover their asses in the case of a lawsuit. They told me to call the local police department, as one of you recommended, for them to do a wellness check on Helen. 

The day after the wellness check, the police called my work and asked me to come to the station. Once I got there, they sat me down in a small room with a reflective window on the wall.

A beefy police officer walked in and stood in the corner of the room with his hands clasped together in front of him. Following him was a middle aged woman in a suit with a leather briefcase. 

She sat down across from me, “Hello Jack, my name is Sasha \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Thank you for coming down to see us. Don’t worry, we just want to ask you some questions about your boss Helen.”

“Ok, shoot.” I said, heart beat getting just a little faster. 

“Well, after you called and explained the situation, a couple of our officers went to Helen’s house to perform the welfare check as you requested. They didn’t find her there. And after some concerning evidence at her residence, this has now moved into a missing person investigation. I need you to tell me every detail you can remember.” She had placed a yellow legal pad down in front of her while she talked and pulled a fancy pen out of her bag. She looked across the table at me expectantly. 

Of course, I told her everything. From the weird cake, the bug snack and vomit, her red eyes, her message written on the underside of her desk. I started getting a terrible headache from the recollection. I didn’t realize how stressful this had been for me. 

“Tell me more about the messages. Under her desk and what she said to…” she checked her notes, “Scott, and what she wrote on the cake.”

“Uhh, the cake said ‘we are grateful for your prayers’, I think she told Scott ‘we dreamed of you’ or something, and on the underside of her desk was written, ‘we have awaited your arrival.’” My head was pounding now. I put my elbows on my knees and my head into my hands. 

“Are you ok?” The investigator asked.

“I’m fine. I think I’m just getting a migraine.” I winced, pushing my thumbs into the corners of my eyes, “I haven't had one this bad since I was a kid. Do you have any extra strength pain killers?” I said, glancing up at her.

The investigator looked back at the officer and gestured to him. He nodded his head and left the room. 

“In her office, Jack, what was the message written with?” I looked up to see the investigator looking at me, pleadingly. Her eyes said to speak quickly. 

“I don't know but it stank in there. Maybe garbage, or, Jesus, maybe even puke?” I put my head back down and tried to breathe through the pain. This headache was getting unbearable. 

“Well the reason I ask is because the police found more messages like it in Helen’s home. In fact, we ran some tests on them and…” She reached into her bag and brought out pictures of Helen’s home. I looked up as she slid them across the table to me and I almost fainted, from my headache waxing in pressure and the terrible gruesomeness of the photographs. Messages similar to the ones she had been saying or writing the past week were plastered all over Helen’s apartment. The original wall color was barely seen through the reddish brown messages hastily, angrily, scrawled upon the walls. There must have been thirty photographs, each one a different wall or ceiling of her house with messages “we have waited for your arrival”, “we have dreamed of your presence”, “we have prayed implicitly”, “we hope to heaven, we bow to hell”, “we have listened to your call”.

“The tests came back positive for Helen’s DNA,” She said quickly, “These messages are written in her blood and feces.” 

“How…”

“There is one DNA sample, though, that came back that isn't hers. We are still waiting for a match. Jack, this amount of blood is concerning. If your friend Helen is still alive, she is in a very weak state. What you’ve told us today, is everything you can remember?” 

My waxing migraine made it hard to recollect, but in that moment I was sure of everything I had told the investigator. I was inexorably worried about my friend and coworker. This was such a tragic, horrible, unforgiving accident. I hoped that Helen could get the care she needed and soon.

“Yes.” I answered. 

The beefcake officer came in with a bottle of pills and a white plastic cup of water. I swallowed three greedily. The officer resumed his place in the corner. 

“We have already contacted your coworkers and are going to speak to them as well regarding all of this.” She took a card out of her bag and placed it down in front of me on the desk, “If you see or hear or remember *anything*, please call me.” 

They dismissed me as the painkillers started to take the edge off my migraine. I walked out to my car like I had just been beaten up. All of this was so hazy and scary. My boss’s blood and shit was smattered on her walls in messages like a cultist. How could I be expected to keep my cool, or be rational about this? I couldn't make sense of it. I sat in my car as the headache waned and I gained my composure. I put it in reverse and was about to leave when the investigator ran up to my window. I rolled it down, “Yeah?”

“I forgot one thing, I'm sorry. We couldn't get Scott’s contact information as he isn't your employee anymore. Could you possibly reach out to him and convince him to come talk to us? Him and your coworker, Stacy, are the only other people who had close contact with Helen while she was in these fugue states.” 

“Sure thing.” I managed a smile and drove away, stunned.

When I got home that night, my migraine had already come back in full force. I took more pain meds and when they finally took effect, I decided to call Scott. I was looking for a pen and pad when the ringing cut and it went to voicemail, “What's up…you’ve reached Scott \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* If this is about a potential gig I do *not* do children's birthday parties. Leave a message and I'll call you back.” 

Underprepared, stressed, and under the influence of probably too many painkillers I said, “Scott. Helen is missing. Call me back.” I hung up and sat down on my couch. 

I woke up in the same spot the next morning. After a coffee, more pain killers and a piece of bread, I got dressed and was out the door for work. It's ethereal going to work a regular job when such strangeness is whipping around you like a storm. It's bad enough having to fake a smile for a customer, to pretend to be pleasant and interested in their consumerism. But after something like this? How are you supposed to act? I felt aloof in my own skin. I was on autopilot for the drive and most of the morning. Still, I had bills to pay so I pushed on. My headache was already coming back by lunch. Was I getting sick too? I didn’t have any other symptoms, just a headache. I used to get them all the time when I was a kid. My parents told me it was a part of growing up and ‘becoming who I was meant to be.’ They turned it into some moral lesson about sticking it through tough situations and never quitting until the job is done. 

I went into my office for my lunch. I had hoped I could be left undisturbed. But before long Jeff was knocking on the door. I popped another Excedrin, “Open.” I called. 

He came in swiftly, leaving the door open, “Jack you gotta come back out here, Helen is outside the store.” I bolted up, ran around my desk and out to the sales floor, Jeff following behind at my heels. I hoped Jeff had mistaken a stranger for Helen but as I looked out the giant glass windows of the front wall of our store, there she stood, naked, covered in brown bile-like fluid. It created an unsightly shimmer in the blazing noon sun. She stood with her back to the windows, arms at her side with her palms facing upwards. Her neck was bent sharply backward, lifted at the star of our solar system. 

“Jeff,” I said, unable to blink or look away, “call an ambulance.” Once he pulled out his phone, I walked as steadily as I could, outside our store. A small group of shoppers had gathered nearby, videoing the spectacle. 

“Helen…?” I tried to use the same voice I use to talk to scared children, hoping to hide my terror, “Hi Helen. It's me, Jack. Can I give you a shirt?” I took meek steps towards her. Her eyes were open, unblinking. They must’ve been so dry. She didn’t seem to notice my presence so I inched closer. I unbuttoned my dress shirt and took it off. I was right next to her, “Helen, I’m just gonna cover you up ok?” I cautiously placed the shirt over her shoulders and drew the sleeves over her breasts, trying to preserve some decency. It wasn’t until I had gotten that close that I smelled her. Acrid filth, fresh sewage cooked in the sun like an egg in a pan, punched my throat and nostrils. I gagged. 

That's when she noticed me and snapped her head in my direction. Her eyes were filled with rage, they gleamed with uncanny wrath, but her teeth. Her mouth was pulled into a smile, like fish hooks had been stabbed through her cheeks and yanked. I fell back onto the burning pavement, heaving from the stench and fright. 

She jumped on top of me. 

I covered my neck and head as best I could but her punches and hits were veracious and exacting. My ears and my kidneys taking the brunt of her force. She beat me silently, the only voices were the concerned cries and gasps of the onlookers. Followed by rushing footsteps of some good Samaritans coming to my aid. As they grabbed her, we locked eyes once more and she coughed, spitting blood and bile onto my face. My mouth had been open. 

As they dragged her off me, I turned on my side and vomited onto the pavement. Once I recovered I saw Helen fending off three large men, spitting, coughing, slapping at them like a living biological grenade. As these poor men backed away, the police and ambulance showed up. The cops got out of their cruisers and ran to the sorry scene, drawing their tasers. They attempted a consensual arrest with pleas of surrender, but to no avail. They stunned her with the taser long enough for one of the officers to handcuff her. They escorted her to one of the ambulances, frothing at the mouth and fighting every step. Some of the EMTs addressed the scratches on my face and abdomen and saw to it that my saviors were looked after as well. 

I was so shaken I had downed five extra strength Excedrin migraines and they still didn’t help. I got home and sat in the shower for over an hour. I’m not going to lie, I sobbed. I wept for how stressful this had been, for how terrified I was at that moment and how fucking badly my head hurt. I had never been in a fight before, not like that. I didn’t know what to do! I couldn’t hit her back! What if I damaged her brain more? Thankfully, there is a silver lining. Helen was now in the care of medical professionals and the worry could be passed onto them. After my shower I remembered the meeting with the investigator. I gave her a call and left a message briefly explaining the day’s events and what hospital Helen was in. 

I had contacted the higher ups at my company to update them on the situation the next day. I also informed them I would be taking a three week vacation, for all that I have been through. They obliged and mentioned something about the possibility of promoting me and one of my sales team members. I didn’t care, I just wanted to stay home, play video games, and relax. Maybe see a doctor about my recurring migraines.

Before my lovely leave of absence, I had to train a couple of the sales team members to be able to perform some responsibilities in my stead. My bosses at corporate said they would send over a couple extra people from a nearby branch to help out. One thing did concern me, however: I hadn’t heard from Stacy in a long time, not since the conversation we had about what she had seen Helen doing in her office. She would have made this training easier, not to mention she could have helped me out with Helen. She had seen her like that before. 

I called Jeff into my office, “Hey do you know if Stacy took some time off this week?” 

“Yeah?” He said, “You didn’t notice? She’s been out sick for like a week and a half.” He saw the shock on my face, “Why? Is she ok?” 

“She should be,” I gathered myself, “I just didn’t know she had been out that long. I’ll give her a call and see how she is feeling. Thank you Jeff.” 

I called Stacy on my way home that night. The phone rang for eternity before she picked up. I heard static on the other line. 

“Hello Stacy? It's me Jack…are you ok?” 

Nothing answered back to me. “Stacy?” 

I pressed my phone hard to my face hoping I could pick up something I couldn't hear before. All I heard was static…and wind?. It got a little louder, then a little louder, with each passing minute. “Stacy, are you okay? Please, talk to me. It’s about Helen.” I wondered if she had been outside but as the noise grew, I realized it was her breathing. It was staccato, punctuated. Was she trying to speak? “Stacy, you need to speak a little louder, I can't hear you. Do I need to call an ambulance?” My panicked voice sounded shrill in contrast to her breathy puffs. I listened as closely as I could, closing my eyes and focusing on the sound of her breathing. As her phone was getting closer to her mouth, the fluctuations of her breath became clear. After a moment, through the softest of whispers, I swear I heard her breathe, “We have awaited your arrival.” 

I froze. The phrase flowing from Stacy’s mouth like smoke from hell, came through the receivers and choked me with fear. This seemed beyond any of us. I didn’t know what to do so I hung up and called the police as I ran inside my apartment.

When you want a wellness check done on somebody, you can call the police station’s non-emergency number. Not thinking clearly, I called that one first, but I didn't get an answer, not even a voice message. I tried their non-emergency number one more time and after not getting any answer, realized my mistake and called 911. 

“9-1-1, for what city?”

“Uh, \*\*\*\*\*\*.”

“Do you require the police, fire or ambulance?” 

“Am-police and ambulance.” 

“What address is the emergency?”

“Uh, it's my friend and coworker Stacy. Hold on.” I put the phone on speaker and found Stacy's contact. I read her address to the operator. 

“Thank you sir. Now can I have your name?”

“Jack”

“Ok sir, can you tell me what happened?”

“Well, nothing yet. I wanted to see if you could send officers and possibly an ambulance for a wellness check. I think my friend is really sick. I just called her on the phone and she sounded like she was having a really hard time breathing.”

The microphone crackled as she heavily exhaled, “Sir, this is the emergency line. Not for wellness checks.”

“I know, I know. I tried to call the non-emergency number but nobody answered.” the operator was silent, “Hello?” I asked after a minute of no response.

“I’m sorry sir. We don’t have enough officers available to check on your friend right now. But we will send one as soon as we can. ”

“Seriously? This is an emergency though? You can’t send an ambulance or some firefighters?”

“I’m sorry sir, all our first responders are on calls as we speak. Please hold.” 

Her line went silent for a few moments. I started tapping my foot, rattling the pills in my pocket, “God dammit. Pick up the fucking phone.” 

“Hello, Sir?” 

“Yes, do you have anybody that can go check on her?”

“I contacted the police department from \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* (The nearest city, almost 50 miles away). They said they can send an ambulance to check on your friend.”

“Thank god. Okay, thank you so much Ma’am.” I said. 

“Stay safe tonight.” She hung up. 

What the fuck? What did she mean by that? 

I opened my bottle of painkillers and saw there were only three left. I swallowed them dry and grabbed some melatonin from my medicine cabinet. After my dosage, I laid on my bed and flipped the TV on. Switching through channels, a news broadcast caught my attention. I switched on to the channel and felt a surge of pain in my head, followed by high pitched ringing in my ears.

16 DEAD, 3 MISSING IN VIOLENT MOB ATTACK AT LOCAL HOSPITAL, the headline read. I was bewildered. It was the same hospital Helen was admitted to. My head felt like it was banging against a wall but my vision was glued to the TV.

They warned the video footage was disturbing but, Jesus Christ. It was far worse than I imagined. It showed shitty phone footage of people, in the same state as Helen, ripping through medical staff, police officers and random pedestrians. These…rabid humans ran so quickly, so determined, eviscerating any person in their path. It was carnage marketed as news. The video ended as the cameraman was tackled. You could hear his screams. 

They paused the video there and the newscaster said, “We are warning everyone in the downtown \*\*\*\*\*\* area to stay indoors and lock all your doors and windows. Investigators and law enforcement are working fervently to establish control of the situation.” My mouth hung open, disbelief hollowed my bones and dried my vessels of blood, yet the ringing in my head turned raucous. As all other noises drowned in the ringing, I noticed something about the last frame they stopped the video on. I quickly grabbed the remote and paused the TV. Somehow the phone camera ended up on its side. It showed the aftermath of the mob attack at the hospital: burning ambulances, corpses strewn like dirty socks, folded and crumpled. In the far left hand corner of the frame, barely noticeable, to anyone who didn’t know her, was Stacy. She stood stiff, neck craned backwards with her face pointed to the sky. She was filthy, just like Helen was. 

I don’t know what is going on but my doors and windows are locked. I’m considering building a barricade in front of my sliding glass doors. I am so scared. Please, I don’t know what to do.
