Went to a military veteran PTSD facility for treatment for my PTSD.

First day I arrived, they let me tour the facility and the counselor immediately warned me about my future roommate in the sketchiest way possible. 

Offhandedly stating - as we're walking around the peaceful horse stable area that was meant as a form of treatment for PTSD there - that there was something really off with her, she whispered to herself, that they would hear scratches and weird noises coming from her room and that she freaked some of the other counselors out.. so to just be, careful. 

I asked her very plainly why she would be warning me and if she was potentially dangerous as I previously worked in mental health and experienced my fair share of interesting situations.

She said we don't really know. She should be? Just be careful. 

So we finish our tour and I go back to the main facility get my stuff and head to the room, I walk in and meet this girl and she looks like something straight out of the exorcist or Carrie maybe - short frayed curly blonde hair, pale skin as if she hadn't seen sunlight her whole life, disheveled clothes, a Bible, and a strange hauntingly absent stare - nothing much else. I try to introduce myself and she just sits there on the bed, criss cross staring at me, laughs to herself and goes to turn on the TV. 

I was like okay maybe I'm overthinking this, so whatever cool just continued to put my things away.

She starts blasting music about satanic murder stuff - music videos and all for 5 hours straight - keep in mind at this time I had just arrived and hadn't been assigned to a counselor yet so I was just supposed to hang out in the room - all the while this girl is blasting crazy murder music staring at me and occasionally talking to herself.

Then she pulls out a notebook and starts drawing for another few hours.

I tried to be friendly and ask what she was drawing, she moves her head abrubtly stares at me coldly turns the notebook around and it was just a series of pages scribbled in black all the way through the paper, essentially the was pile driving the pen into the notebook all that time. 

She laughs again and says that she's so much smarter than people realize and then flip changes and goes back to staring at the wall and being silent and cold. 

At this point I'm like you know all of the details make me feel kind of unsafe sleeping in this room but I can't go anywhere else right now so I'm just going to try to sleep and maybe it'll be better tomorrow. 

The next day, nothing changed so I just decided to go see my counselors and play with the horses and that I'd just go workout or something until I had to go to sleep I was there to get therapy after all not be freaked out so I kind of just kept my distance.

When I went to see my counselor I found out that my roommate had her appointment right before mine and she walks out and gives me the same cold creepy stare as she passes and says nothing  - and the counselor runs into the hallway to ask me if I could shadow this girl for just in case and to just make sure she gets to where she needs to get to. I said sure although internally I was both confused why she'd need monitoring and also kind of freaked out by her and mostly not wanting to be around her at all - so I was like great. And I was there for my own therapy not to work so I was like... double great. 

But I did as she asked, spent more time with her and it seemed clear to me at this point she was likely schizophrenic which is disconcerting but not always dangerous so I relaxed and tried to just keep going about that routine make sure she gets to her appointments, go to mine, workout and go back to my room and go to sleep. 

One day she says she wants to watch a show with me because I'm wearing an anime shirt that she likes and reminds her of a show she likes, "The Girl from Nowhere". I'm always down for a good show and this was probably our most normal interaction up until this point so I was like heck yeah let's do it - I just have to go workout first and when I get back we can watch. 

I come back to my room after working out to have my room swarmed with guards and counselors and they tell me to walk away that I won't be able to come back to my room for a little bit.

I figured something broke, or something was going on with the roommate so I didn't ask too many questions I was just kind of like oh, okay I'll  be back in a bit then.

I come back an hour later and there are more guards than before and someone comes up to me and asks if any conflict happened between me and that girl and I was like no we were just about to watch a show I thought everything was okay? 

They go okay thanks, and tell me I still can't enter and I ask if I can at least grab a change of clothes and my mp3 player and then I'd head out they said okay yeah sure go ahead but you need to have someone in there with you.

I still had no idea what was going on.

I come in there and the girl is yelling at the counselor like I had never seen her do claiming everything was a lie and to not trust the doctors there that they'd keep me trapped 

I figured she might just be having an episode of paranoia so I just spoke calmly and proceeded to get my clothes and stuff so I could exit.

She starts yelling more so they remove her to go see the doctor.

I come back to the room later and they tell me she's gone, but that she'd be back-  all of her stuff is left behind and I'm still very confused about what had gone on. 

I wake up the next day and all 50 people on the property are talking about it, people start coming up to me asking if I'm okay or injured - I still have no idea what happened so I start asking around because it seems like everyone knows something I don't know. 

Two girls pull me over and tell me she had sat down with them at lunch and told them with a demonic giggle that she hated me.

And that she had a plan for her day. That she was going to kill me. And had been planning on killing me by choking or stabbing me with a fork in my sleep. They both thought she was kidding until they realized she wasn't.

They both got a really bad feeling about it and told another friend who wound up telling the counselors, and they found wire and a metal fork (which we weren't allowed to have at the facility because of suicide risk for vets), intentionally stowed.

The counselor called her to the room to verify the risk, and she proceeded to attack the counselor. The doctor who intervened as previously mentioned when I went back to the room also got attacked - the cops were called and I had no idea any of that had happened. 

I went back to my room and out of curiosity opened the Bible that she had left on the desk - she had insane scribblings and edits where she highlighted specifically disturbing pieces of the scripture and had edited them to signify a date and time she would do certain destructive acts to people. She had a list of names she had crossed off for each piece like a code. 

Just

I could have been murdered that night and somehow made it out alive. 

Trust your gut instincts should you ever come across the same.
