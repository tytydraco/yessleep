For many years, I was a contractor that worked on homes that had been foreclosed on or passed down to someone and the heir wanted it shaped up to be put on the market or donate it to a local historical society. It usually went well, and I didn’t have any issues besides the usual trivial inconveniences until the Howard job.

Henry Howard IV was the heir to an old money fortune. Steel primarily if I recall correctly, but I’m sure the family’s investments extended far beyond that. His family was always in the social pages of the local paper and the name had been associated with philanthropic efforts across the country. A hospital wing here, a library there, and educational endowments galore. By the time of Henry’s death in 1982, his family had been part of the upper echelon for a long time. But strangely enough, he didn’t share his family’s predilection for social prominence. Quite the opposite, as he was known as a bit of a recluse, but not one with a reputation. Or more exactly, he didn’t have a reputation for a specific thing, but that didn’t stop people from gossiping or speculating. Not openly of course, because back then open rumors were not exactly encouraged.

So while people didn’t exactly talk, they certainly whispered. And as was to be expected, the rumors varied. Especially when the whisperers were doing it after having a few drinks. Gossip about why he’d never been married, no one ever saw him, what he spent his time on, and so on. A particular subject of gossip was the various professorships or endowments he personally funded. Most of it had to do with stuff related to folklore, mysticism, and the occult, so that also earned more than its fair share of gossip. When he died at the ripe old age of 96 and the estate went to the closest surviving relative, who was a distant cousin by then, I was brought in to get the place in good shape to be put on the market.

And when I arrived, I saw it wasn’t a moment too soon. Because the place looked grand on the outside but was a complete mess on the inside. Outside the façade was a grand Tudor style mansion with sweeping grounds overlooking the local woods with a wrought iron gate surrounding the property. But inside, it was clear that it was all a state of grandeur gone sour.

The magnificent marble floors and winding wooden staircase that looked like something out of a movie were covered with dust, debris, and a jumbled mess of junk clearly acquired over decades without anyone having bothered to tidy up. The scent of dust and mildew was stifling, and I quickly brought in a few more local guys I occasionally hired for backup. And so the slow process of cleaning up the Howard mansion began.

And I do mean slow, because the same state applied for the rest of the mansion’s numerous rooms. There were 12 bedrooms, 15 bathrooms, three dining rooms, two kitchens, a ballroom, a solarium, four sitting rooms, a massive library with two stories, and an attic that seemed endless. The solarium windows were covered with grime on the outside and plants long since dead on the inside, the curtains in the library were torn to shreds from something, the once grand chandelier had fallen and crashed onto the floor of the ballroom, and we found an entire family of racoons in the attic. Several of the bedrooms had broken windows, and in two of the bathrooms the pipes had burst with clear traces of water damage that had led to mold growing steadily.

The outside wasn’t nearly as bad, but the in-ground swimming pool was filled with so much dirt and debris it took days to clean it out. But Henry’s cousin Millicent wanted the place in as good as shape as possible and had no problem with paying us accordingly, so we went right to work. And it kept us busy for weeks, because it always seemed like once we fixed something it revealed two more things that the first problem had been hiding.

But we eventually made progress, and the mansion began looking inhabitable by humans. Then it started looking like exactly the impressive house it was. And after enough time, it looked like something out of a magazine spread. The layers of dust had been removed from the portraits in the front hall, so now you could see all the Howard family portraits as you walked through the entrance. The moth eaten velvet curtains had been replaced and new ones elegantly lined the detailed wooden bannisters as had been intended. And that was all good because once you got past all the mess and chaos the house actually contained a lot of intriguing things. We stumbled across everything from ancient maps of the world to some priceless treasures from Egypt. Apparently that was an area of particular interest for Henry because we found numerous things in the house dedicated to the Egyptian god Anubis. A tiny statue here, an impressive stone carving there. The most notable was the library, where a giant portrait of Anubis hung over the fireplace. He might have had a reputation of being interested in unusual things, but it was more interesting and original then being interested in the usual things old money people tend to like.  

In many ways every day was like an adventure and there was no telling what we’d find. Which was something Millicent appreciated because we also had an antiques appraiser on hand to tell us what was important and could put on auction. Millicent was big into philanthropy too and if the stuff she had placed on auction sold, the proceeds were sent to one cause or another. We all felt enormous pride in our work, Millicent was a dream client and couldn’t be more gracious, but I wasn’t sorry to see the job end, and I wasn’t alone. Something about the place had always seemed off to me.  At first glance it now seemed like a brand-new house, but as I knew well, looking like a brand-new house and feeling like an inviting home are two completely different things. Because we had done all we could, but something just quite couldn’t be fixed. Some sense of decay and coldness that had nothing to do with appearances. But there was nothing we could do about that.

It was the final day on the job, my crew had gone home, and I was doing one last look around when it happened. I was in the library, and I noticed a subtle breeze coming from somewhere. So naturally, I tried to find it. After a few minutes of carefully walking around while trying to sense the source, I arrived at one of the bookshelves on the library’s first floor and the draft was unmistakable. I could clearly feel it flowing through the floor somewhere, and knowing how often there could be hidden doors in houses, I started looking for this one by pressing on the wooden bookshelf. Eventually, I pressed a knot in the left side and the bookshelf came off the wall like a door and I was staring down a pitch-black passageway. Fortunately I had a flashlight on me as always, so I switched it on and started walking down the roughhewn stone steps that I could now see were descending from the entrance in the library.

It was cooler but dry here, and I took care not to fall as I walked down the stone steps and arrived at a short passageway that opened up to a much wider space and I found myself staring at a graveyard. Most of the cemeteries I’d been in had seen better days, as everything from the wrought iron fence and gate to most of the various crypts were crumbling and fading. This one was in seemingly flawless condition, with all of the tombs looking practically brand new. But that made sense, as this was hidden underneath a vast bit of earth and rock. But that stirred up another question. Had this place been concealed from the world via an earthquake, a disaster, or some kind of cave in, it would be obvious, as there would be debris everywhere and heavy rocks would’ve fallen on the tombs and caused damage. So that led to the inevitable conclusion that this place was deliberately build underground like a catacomb, but on a far more elaborate level. Why was that? I had been part of numerous projects with a mausoleum on a property before, but why the hidden entrance?

The only possible way to figure that out was to look around, so I carefully stepped forward and took my first tentative steps into the elaborate graveyard. But there was no doubt it was beautiful. All of the carvings on the stone were flawless and elaborate, with features carefully sketched into the smooth headstones. But my attention was quickly drawn to the centerpiece of the cemetery, which was a mausoleum that seemed to loom out of the earth.

I carefully approached it, and for some reason I still cannot understand, I felt I should open it. The mausoleum doors were stuck, so it took some doing for me to tug them open. They eventually did, and when they opened it was with a shriek and a cloud of dust.  Once my eyes adjusted and I was able to look around properly, it was clear as impressive as the exterior was, it was nothing compared to the interior. Because while the outside façade was impressive in terms of craftsmanship and design, the inside was gargantuan. It was less like a private crypt and more like the giant mausoleums at cemeteries where hundreds of people are buried.

Adding to the impressive effect was the fact that every inch of the mausoleum’s interior was hewn from a thick black stone that gleamed as my flashlight illuminated it. I had never seen anything like it before. And it wasn’t marble either. The result was that the darkness felt particularly suffocating.

The interior was coated so thick with dust it was probably at least an inch thick, and the bodies of numerous insects were scattered everywhere. My flashlight highlighted the many centipedes and spiders in various shapes and sizes, and I took care to avoid stepping on them. As I did, my footsteps echoed faintly in the closed space.

But there was something else. Some smell lurking beneath all the dust and mildew. So I sniffed the air and paused. Then I realized what it was. Smoke. And as the old saying goes, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. We were deep in the earth by now, and any source of fire had to be coming from somewhere nearby. So I carefully maneuvered around until I found a wall that seemed off. After standing there for a minute, I felt both air and a thicker smell of smoke, so I began to look around. I noticed there was an elaborate metal candleholder in a wall nearby, and I carefully tugged on it. When I did that, the crypt wall I was facing instantly fell away to reveal another passage that spiraled down deeper into the earth as I kept following it.

Many steps later, the passage evened out and I found myself walking on a flat bit of earth that opened up into a large cavern. And the smell of fire was much stronger here. But by far the most notable thing was the hushed sound of voices that came from the far end of the cavern. That sent a shiver down my spine. Short of people going spelunking experiencing a cave in and being trapped, there was no logical reason people should be down here. And no logical reason typically means someone is up to something.

I carefully walked along and noticed there were a few gaps in a rock wall that went almost to the ceiling of the cavern and shielded me from view. Through it, I was just able to peer out and glimpse what lay on the other side. When I looked, I saw a vast open space. It was filled with people, all gathered around something in a circle. I didn’t need to be told this was some sort of gathering. Also at the far end of the room was a crackling fire, but it was also burning something thick and pungent like incense. A series of torches lining the space added to the sense of flickering menace. I had no idea what exactly was going on, but it didn’t feel right. And it certainly didn’t come across as anything good. The people were only shadows from my vantage point, but that was enough for me to sense their presence, and I didn’t like it.

Also troubling was the layout of this passage. I’d restored numerous houses in all areas of the country. Many of them were huge mansions and often times, especially if they were older, they had secret rooms. Sometimes an old house belonged to a bootlegger during the Prohibition era and there was a secret escape route that no one knew about. Sometimes a house belonged to a wealthy businessman or a diplomat of some sort and their old house had a secret panic room. Sometimes an old property in the south used to belong to a pirate or a prominent landowner during the Civil War and there was a hidden passageway used to escape should the occasion arrive. Or there were even the instances where some houses had belonged to someone involved in crime and as you worked on the house you found a hidden room containing anything from guns to cash to possible evidence of a crime that had long gone unsolved, a hidden passageway, a panic room, or maybe even all three.

But this? I had never encountered anything remotely like this before, not the least of which was how inherently ominous it felt. Despite all the dust and cobwebs, this place didn’t feel remotely abandoned or neglected like all the other hidden passages I’d been in before did. There was a tangible presence in the air that felt like it had never been abandoned.

But then an additional scent managed to cut through the heady mix of incense, smoke, and earth. The coppery scent of blood. And from my vantage point I couldn’t see any, so that meant not only was it out of my view, but there had to be a lot of it for me to smell it all the way over here despite the presence of smoke and incense. And then I heard something. A loud snap that was followed by what sounded like an animal chewing and eating. I had no logical reason to think that, but I knew it was what I heard.

Just when I thought it couldn’t get any creepier, it did. Because something moved at the far end, and I could just see the outline of a giant shadow. It wasn’t human, and it let out a roar that was anything but. I had no idea what it was, but the closest thing I could compare it to was a wolf or dog howling.

And that was when I booked it out of there. The rest of the run through the passage was a blur. My chest was heaving and my legs felt like they were on fire as I ran for what felt like an eternity. Every moment I thought someone was going to jump out of the shadows and grab me, but after a painfully long time I was back in the mausoleum. I quickly hit the candleholder on the wall and the passage closed again.

I was just about to keep running when I noticed something. At the far end of the room was a golden statue of a large dog. But the weird thing was that it was facing the corner like someone tried to hide it or something. Don’t ask me why, but I felt that it wasn’t happy in that position and wasn’t meant to be there, so I quickly walked over and turned it towards me. I found myself facing magnificent diamonds for eyes. Then, with the only possible explanation being I’d spent enough time in houses to pick up on things, I dragged the gold statue across the room and set it so that it was facing the hidden passage I’d just come through.

The instant that was done, I felt slightly less like I was running for my life, but I still made my way out of the mausoleum as fast as I could. When I was back in the library I was out of breath, but I only briefly stopped to slam the hidden door closed shut again before I kept on running until I was outside in the fresh air and sunshine. But even then I didn’t stop until I got in my truck, started it up, and roared out of the driveway. My work was done, so I had no cause to be there. I was soaked with sweat and I wasted no time in blasting the AC. While I did that I also tried to calm down and steer my way out of the driveway. Which was no mean feat considering how the driveway wound around the property, and once I finally reached the end of it, I had to take care not to run straight into the stone wall lining the property.

The next few days passed without incident, but I was beyond paranoid. Because I could swear I was being watched when I was out in public. I didn’t see anything and everything seemed as it should, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that there were eyes on me. But much like gossip about Henry, I didn’t know anything for certain. All I could do was speculate, and what’s a little more gossip about a rich eccentric? Especially since the mansion sold quickly and that was the last I heard of it. But that didn’t mean nothing happened, just that no one said anything.
