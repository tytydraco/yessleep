My relationship with my mother had never been anything good. She would always nag and mock me for everything i do, be it forgetting to do a chore or even simply passing by. I don't remember a single compliment I've gotten from her, as the 'good times' are only when she keeps her mouth shut.  
Ever since i was little, she had criticized how i look. My nose, my bushy eyebrows, my flat ass and how hairy my body is.. Telling me how i ruined her youth and her beauty. Telling me she could've been so much more if she hadn't met my cursed father (whom r\*ped her then left).  
But i don't believe i am as ugly and pathetic as she paints me to be.. I've had people outside of home tell me im beautiful. My mom's just jealous. She just envies me because i have the beauty she wishes she still does.  
I can't remember the last time we passed a day without arguing. She would comment on my hairy arms and i would fight back with commenting on her saggy tits and her old body that would make any man go soft. She used to hit me when i was little, but now that I'm 16, being taller and physically stronger than her, she knows not to.  
I don't believe in that 'shes still your mother' crap. She didn't want to be my mother. She didn't even want to be a mother. I am nothing to her but the memory of her trauma. The devil born daughter with the face of her r\*pist. The cut that always bleed.  
I never expected a change until i got home from school to my mom sitting at the dinner table with a... Man. My first impression was, *"did she lose her job? Is she a prostitute now?"*. I didn't question it at all, as i just passed by and went to my room.  
But then the same man is there.. almost everyday. I know he looks at me, even when cuddling on the couch with mom or having dinner. With him around, mom mocks me less. In front of me, at least. I know that wrecked cow would talk sh\*t about me every chance she gets.  
Soon, they get engaged. A few days pass by and my brand new dad began talking to me. When mom isn't around, he would attempt to small talk, asking how things are at school or how i am feeling. And as much as i would love to flirt and ruin mom's life even more by stealing her boyfriend, step-dad is the ugliest man I've ever seen.   
Let two rats be together to fill in the emptiness inside of them.   
but.. stepdad wasn't that bad. His taste in women may be awful, but he lets me use his debit card at times and cooks well. For once... It's nice to have an older figure care for me. He was so nice, without making me feel uncomfortable or creeped out. Like, sincerely nice.. Is this what its like to have a father figure?  
As much as it's disgusting to see him and mom be all lovey dovey together, a small part in me felt.. I don't even know how to describe it. Comfort? Is this a chance for me to finally feel like i have a normal family?  
Months go by, and i noticed mom had been.. less angry than usual. It's like she finally has color in her. Other than her usual angry, raging face even when she's quiet she's just more calm now. Everything escalated.. quite nicely.. i guess. Although interactions with my stepdad is a little awkward, he doesn't creep me out. The house had been less distorted and numb when he's there.. hes like a soothing breeze that calms down the rage both me and my mother has inside.  
As disgusting as it is to say, mom and stepdad had been having sex with the bedroom door slightly open. I could hear the grunts and moan and bed creakings, but i just ignored it. whatever floats their boat i guess.  
I thought mom was happier, but it's really just sadness that numbed her anger. Now she's just depressed. She would cry in her bedroom, sometimes with stepdad comforting her. I never felt pity for her.. until once when i was secretly listening in on her, i hear her cry 'mom.. mommy..'. I never knew neither of my grandparents.  
One day, as they were doing the usual love making with the door slightly open, i was at the kitchen grabbing something to drink. Until i heard a moan. Stepdad, moaning MY name. MY name! I stood there confused. Numb. I rushed to their room. Ive seen a lot of disturbing things, seeing my unsightly stepdad pound on my equally unsightly mom couldnt have been worse.

i peeked, and the sight has never left my mind. He was hitting her from the back, but.. mom's wearing my clothes. My school uniform.. as stepdad whispers my name under his breath when he continues further. I stepped back with my hands covering my mouth. I gag, i feel like throwing up.. So thats why mom had been stealing my clothes.. thats why she had been copying my hairstyle.. thats why shes using my perfume.

i feel the rage building inside of me. this is f\*cking disgusting! i push open the door, as they gasp and stops, trying to cover themselves. i lash out at them, calling them out for the disgusting pigs they are. how dare they! stepdad was quiet. i could sense a part of him likes seeing me degrading him. I step back, then stomped to my room. I grabbed my things. I had no hesitation. i didnt think of where im going, i just wanted to get out of here as fast as i could. Thankfully i had saved up money since elementary just in case of something..

As i was ready to leave, mom catches up to me before i got to the front door. Shes asking me where im going, what am i doing. But i ignored, walking past her as she then grabbed my hand. Shes still wearing my uniform, the skirt's waist folded so that its shorter than supposed. Its nauseating. She pulled my arm, as i fight back and pushes her away until she hugs me.

She hugged me. I froze for a moment, as she cried into my shoulder. I couldnt even describe what i felt in that moment. A mix of disgust, rage, sadness.. She hugged me tight, grasping on the fabric of my shirt, wetting my shoulder. Why do i feel warm inside? I hate her.. shes the reason why im unhappy, she ruined my life.. so why do i feel this way?

i quickly pushed her away, avoiding looking at her face. I exit the door, and i never saw her or my stepdad again.
