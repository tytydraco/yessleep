My therapist told me to write down my thoughts, so that’s what I am doing.

“You have quite the nose, young woman,” a man calls as he passes. I take note, oddly honored he noticed me.

Part of me got offended. It enrages me when men feel the need to critique a woman’s natural beauty. Men make up 50.4% of the population — and all of them seem to objectify women. I have grown to despise their snarky remarks. Part of me gets flattered, it’s instinctual. 

Sure, my nose is wonderful. But what about my brunette, matted hair with blonde highlights? Or my silky, yet shaggy, pink princess dress? What about my crooked, crescent smile with shiny yellow pearls? 

I do like my nose quite a bit. Its perky edges and button-like features make it stand out. I think my brown eyes, gleaming with a partial sparkle, would have been a more suitable compliment.

My small nose sits atop my face like decoration, useless, but pretty. The woody and fresh scent of a newly cracked book; the strange, chemical tang of a freshly unsealed can of tennis balls; the smoky-sweet perfume of firewood curling through a summer night — all of them drift past me, untouched.

At least I don’t smell the bad: the mildew’s damp, suffocating sensation; the sour stench of my wet dogs after a bath; the metallic, soul-spilling scent rising as I impale someone with a long, rusted rod in the rotting shed behind my house — the dogs watching, silent, mortified.

Unfortunately, I can’t smell fear — that and the glue. At least I have a nice, smooth nose. And when I look into the mirror I remember every person and honor their contribution.

I am happy that so many people comment on my nose. Their compliments give me purpose. A reason to keep doing what I am doing.

I’m happy the guy likes my nose. I’m sure he’ll be the perfect addition.

Looks like I’m back to this! Hopefully I don’t forget about this thing again.

The summer heat really made me clear out most of my closet in search of some gorilla glue. I’m sweating more and more and am unsure how much longer my nose will stay on my face. Hopefully I will find it soon.

I found the glue yesterday!

This journal really makes me reminisce about Dr. Gordon. Every now and then I miss our meetings and wonder how he’s doing.

Every thought that started that way leaves me chuckling. How could I forget? He’s on my face — he’s a part of me now.

The gorilla glue is too strong. My nose is rubbing against my skin, burning it. I need to take my nose off, I hope it doesn’t hurt. 

It’s now peeling off like string cheese — soft, stretchy, and wrong. Parts are clumping together and, well, I think this nose may now be part of me. 

I’ve spent hours pulling off pieces of flesh, not my flesh; it finally came off. Some of my skin between my mouth and eyes got ripped off, though, in the process. At least I can finally smell. I smell the rotting flesh that grafted on top of my real nose for months, maybe even years. 

I smell the metallic blood pouring down my face, even getting a small taste of the blood dripping over my lips. 

Standing on the opposite side of my mirror was now a creature. Eyes, bloodshot from all of my crying — a few veins must’ve popped — and a distorted, yet real nose. 

Picking up the knife I originally used, I jammed it into my real nose, vowing to make a new one and truly have the perfect nose. Agonizing, tearful, but determined, I sawed through my nose. 

Now, I have a fresh canvas. I don’t know who I am without my nose, but it’s nothing, a bit of sculpting, and new flesh, can’t fix.
