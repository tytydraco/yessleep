They say only thirty to fifty percent of people have an inner monologue. That half the world walks around with nothing but silence in their skulls. Empty. Quiet. I pity them.

My inner voice isn’t just some background noise—it’s everything. It’s sharper than my instincts, smarter than my decisions. It’s the reason I’ve gotten this far in life. The quiet ones? They’re animals. Reacting, not thinking. Me? I’m a symphony. Always in motion, always calculating. I love it. I Love *me.*

That’s what I was thinking as I tied up my skates that day. The rink was alive with noise: blades scraping, laughter bouncing off the boards, cold air licking my skin.

I was there with Hannah, this girl I’d been seeing for a few weeks. She was sweet, steady on her feet, better on the ice than me but too kind to show it. My voice kept pace with every moment. *Don’t trip. Smile when she talks. Hold her hand, but let her lead the rhythm.* It’s like having a coach and a confidant rolled into one. Who needs God when you’ve got your own mind?

And then it happened.

A stray kid tore across the ice, cutting too close, and I stumbled to dodge him. My legs went out from under me, my head snapping against the frozen floor like a broken spring. For a moment, there was only impact, sharp and hot. Then silence. Not just around me, but inside.

When I came back to myself, Hannah was helping me to my feet, asking if I was okay. I nodded, and the voice returned. But it wasn’t the same.

*Get up, you useless prick,* it said.

I froze. My voice—*my* voice—didn’t talk like that. It never had. It had always been calm, measured. Not this... barking, snarling thing. I wanted to brush it off, blame the fall, but the words stuck to me like tar. I skated the rest of the evening in a fog, the voice muttering in the back of my skull. Cruel things. Ugly things.

*You’re boring her. Say something, or she’ll leave. Not that it matters—she’s out of your league anyway.*

When I argued back, it laughed. Not a kind laugh. A raw, raspy one.

Over the next few days, the voice grew louder. It stopped offering advice and started barking orders. My body and brain felt like a house with a new tenant—a violent, unwelcome one. Standing in line at the deli, it whispered in my mind: *Take the knife from the counter. Hold it. Feel its weight.* While walking down the street, it suggested: *Push that man into traffic. See what happens.*

I didn’t obey, but I couldn’t ignore it. Every time I refused, it grew angrier. *You’re pathetic. A worm. A waste of flesh.*

I decided to see a doctor. Hannah suggested it after I told her I’d been “off” since the fall. I didn’t tell her about the voice—just enough to make it seem like I wasn’t losing my mind. The voice hated the idea.

*You think they’ll help you? You think pills or therapy will make me go away? I’m not going anywhere, you fucking idiot. I’m you.*

I kept the appointment. I had to. But on the day, as I walked to the clinic, the voice became relentless. Screaming now, its words twisting in my head like jagged metal.

*Turn around. Don’t do this. If you walk in there, I’ll make you pay.*

I pushed on, teeth gritted, until I reached the street outside the office. I saw the doctor through the window, her waiting room calm and sterile. For a moment, I thought I’d made it. That I could finally get this thing out of me.

Then the voice snapped.

*If you won’t listen, I’ll find another way.*

And suddenly, my body wasn’t mine. I felt my feet moving, my hands reaching. There was a man passing by, an older guy with a briefcase and a distracted look on his face. The voice roared. My hands latched onto his throat. His eyes went wide, bloodshot, panicked. I felt the cartilage in his neck shift under my grip. A primal, sickening crunch.

The body hit the pavement with a dull thud. For a moment, everything was still.

And then the voice chuckled, low and satisfied. 

*Good boy. That’s more like it.*

Sirens wailed in the distance. I didn’t run. I couldn’t. The voice wasn’t worried. It whispered, soft and smug: 

*I told you. You can’t get rid of me. Now we’ll have plenty of time together. Just you, me, and a cage. Doesn’t that sound cozy?*
