I recently saw your post on behalf of a teacher concerning a student at Buchner Collegiate. His name is [Roy Vine](https://youtu.be/EDMd-lX8Zrc?si=qXzVD_hyKSqOmcE-). 


The account - [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18fh4p5/the_perfect_student_doesnt_exist/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) - concerns me deeply because I believe it comes from a new custodian at the school, posing as a teacher. 


I am the head custodian and only got the job last summer myself. In fact, a lot of the staff is new, including the principals and some of the teaching staff. 


Apparently, there was an incident last year, around this time, in fact, involving missing students and the previous vice principal. There isn't much more than gossip, however, as a judge instituted a media ban concerning whatever happened. 


Must have been really bad, though. Half the staff is gone, retired, quit, or transfered. Those that remain don't talk about it. 


But I digress. 


This is about Charlotte. And Roy.


She's in her early twenties and never graduated high school. I didn’t hold that against her. Neither did the new principal. Charlotte is quiet, polite, and completes her work without complaint. 


That's what's so surprising about her standing at the head of a darkened classroom, on our night shift, teaching grammar to no one. Or, almost no one.


I watched her through the wire laced window at the side of the door. She looked as anxious as usual, angry even. I couldn't make out what she was saying as she strode around the room, handing out sheets of blank paper. 


It was kind of cute at first. Charlotte was living out some fantasy; she wanted to be a teacher. Cool. 


But then she returned to the head of the class and dropped a pile of papers on the student desk at the front.


"Enough!" Charlotte shrieked. It was loud enough to make me flinch. "There’s nobody there!"


I didn’t move. She looked sweaty, and angry enough to make me afraid to be noticed. 


That's when I realized Charlotte wasn't alone. A shadow so dark and small sat in the desk I'd thought empty. 


Its head turned, revealing red cinder eyes suggesting an undersized child's head. Any thought of this being a real kid vanished within the void that split its face, a grin that would agonize any real person, so dark the interior it drank the light cast by its eyes. 


I'm not ashamed to let you know, I walked away and fast. It's not like horror movies. My brain checked out, and I went right back to sweeping the floor along the hallways. The shock of the experience didn't hit me until I tried to sleep and found that thing behind my eyelids, smiling at the despair it caused. 


I didn't sleep then, and haven't had better than a narcoleptic flop in weeks. I can't get that thing - Roy - out of my head. 


Charlotte doesn't seem overly bothered. She doesn't talk but never did much, so that isn't new. The only odd thing I noticed on dayshift is her worrying over papers, marking them up, and muttering under her breath. She's subtle about it; I think I'm the only one to notice because I saw her "teaching."


Most nightshift cleanings, I glimpsed in the same classroom and saw her but didn’t stop to look in. Once was enough. 


I did find a phone number on one of the pages she left in our breakroom. At the time, I hadn't seen the email Charlotte had written to you, [Mr. Cleriot](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). I didn’t know. 


Charlotte's behaviour obviously bothered me. When I saw the number, I thought I could call it and get a clue about the kind of person she was or, I admit, find something that might result in her firing. No Charlotte, no Roy, right? I know now what I didn’t know then. 


I dialed. 


A torrent of static and interference answered, as described in the previous email. There was a voice beneath it all too, a woman's, I think. She only said one thing clearly, however: My name. Over and over, my name, first and last.


Charlotte wrote that misfortune befell those whose names were spoken. 


So now I wait for my tragedy, and Charlotte continues to "teach" on the night shift. 


Any suggestions would be appreciated.


Hell, I'll take thought and prayers and ambiens in the mail at this point.
