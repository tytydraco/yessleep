I was in my house sleeping until there was a big earthquake from which I got up, I went to a window but there was nothing, the earthquake stopped out of nowhere, however it was normal sometimes for this type of thing to happen, then I went another go to sleep, then I got ready to go to work, which was a bit far from my home, but the distance didn't matter much to me, besides that I lived alone and my family had an accident where only I survived, well, when I went to my work I observed how a man was hiding in the trees, obviously I did not give it much importance since I thought he was looking for something although his look at me was trying to tell me something very important, I continued on my way to my work

After finishing I was going back to my house but oh, I found the same man in the same place and he was still hiding in the trees with his gaze fixed on me, I felt uncomfortable and I walked a little faster to my house, the man began to chase me hidden behind the trees, then I noticed that one of his hands was shining and the other too, which I ran faster since I thought it was some kind of weapon like a sharp knife or something like that, my imagination wasn't very aware of that, then Upon arriving at my house, I immediately closed all the doors, windows and everything that has an escape or entrance to the outside with the suspicion that the man was still there, luckily it seems that he did. The day after it was Sunday and I had free time, I was afraid because my mind wouldn't stop thinking about that man and I stayed at home, luckily I didn't have much to do so I started watching movies with the doors closed so that absolutely no one entered, but the man appeared again, I don't know how he did it or if he got a key the same as mine since I had the original ones and he apparently had new ones, the man took off the cloak that hid it and from there A completely white being came out, I did not know how to react to the fact that a presence was in my house, the being put his right hand on my head and grabbed my right hand with his left and told me;

"Hello, do not be afraid, my son, I am your creator"

I did not know how to react and I was paralyzed, although I managed to calm down since I deduced, if it has not attacked me, then apparently it is, the being presented itself as God, I was left stunned. that he had the being that created everything in my own and same house, then he told me that he will no longer be able to fulfill his deeds and that I must possess his powers and make reality more perfect indicating that I am the new god, He told me that he had enough courage to control Heaven, Reality and, more likely, Hell, I told him that i could not do it and that I am alone without anyone, God exclaimed that it did not matter since he was alone since his creation and from to see what he did now not to be besides that I would be with my family who all died long ago already as I said, I kept denying him since it was too much to ask for but God said that

"there is never enough to have it all son"

Finally he told me that simply I could leave things as they are now, there was no need to worry if there were bigger problems, I would just solve them and everything will be fun for me, and then he gave his essence to me, falling his arms in my arms saying
"you can!"
already like this leaving control of everything in my hands

I spent a while processing what had happened and at the end of the day I went to a ravine to see if what happened was real and when I closed my eyes and jumped in, I said; I can't believe it, I had landed on my feet and without any problem, after understanding what I had to protect from now on, I looked towards the sun observing one of the biggest stars of life and thus I began to take care of reality and the sky creating new human systems and improving them a little with more physical capacities in which they cannot harm many people, and thus I obtained the knowledge of the concepts of my essence and discovered the infinite and great universes which God had mentioned before that I should take care of , so I decided and thus improve the entire existence of these universes by adding what a single being needs, friends and family, thus eliminating bad tastes and that the poor were no longer like this, creating a perfect existence, thus being a new god.
