Hello fellow friends here at nosleep,

I am not usually someone who posts often, mostly I enjoy reading others' experiences. However, being a student, recently, with all the college ed decisions coming out and stuff, I was kinda stressed out. So I have decided to post here the procedures of a ritual I found called the Meditation Ritual, a ritual that will help one find peace. The ritual was documented to have been first practiced in the early 19th century but sadly got lost in time as people moved on, only a few people familiar with this field knows about it these days.

But if you, too, have been troubled by your life currently, not being able to find peace, then you might want to consider performing this ritual. Here I provide the procedures of the said ritual, in case you ever feel the need to get your mind back on track, to meditate yourself.

&#x200B;

*Before we begin, here is the list of supplies that you will need, lack any of these and the ritual would not begin, nothing will happen.*

* The most important object that you will need is a large cardboard box, firm with no damages on it. Originally, the boxes people have used to perform this ritual in the 1800s were made of wood, but it has been proved that the material of the box doesn’t matter, as long as it’s an ordinary box. The box needs to be big enough that one could squeeze themselves completely in it with its lid closed, but not big enough for one to stretch inside or feel comfortable, just barely able to fit if you curl up. This box will serve as your mind during the ritual, and it is your job to explore your mind, to find inner peace. 
* A body-sized mirror able to stand on its own, a common dressing mirror will do. 
* Eight candles, the candles have to be scentless and made of wax, any color is okay.
* And lastly, a personal object that’s of strong emotional values, this would be your support object. (You don’t necessarily need this one for the ritual itself, but rather for your own safety. The ritual can still be performed without it, but it’s highly recommended against.) Common support objects are childhood toys and relics from deceased loved ones. Something that’s small enough that you could fit alongside you in the box, best if you can hold it during the ritual. It will come in handy if anything goes wrong.

*Now that you’ve gathered the objects needed to perform the ritual, it’s time to talk about the setting where the ritual will take place in.*

* In order to find inner peace, you must be completely alone during the entirety of the ritual, if anyone were to aid you or be in your presence, it will not begin and nothing will happen.
* To ensure the comfortness of the participant’s mind, it would be best if the ritual is performed in the place you feel most familiar and relaxed in, my recommendation would be one’s bedroom. **DO NOT** attempt to perform it in unfamiliar territories, failure is almost guaranteed.
* The ritual has to be performed at midnight, with the moon visible through the room’s windows and moonlight slightly illuminating the room, so much so that one can see clearly the mirror and get a grasp of the room they are in. You will have candles during the ritual, but they won’t help illuminate the room. If moonlight cannot be seen during the ritual, **DO NOT** attempt to perform, failure is almost guaranteed.

&#x200B;

*If all of the above requirements are met, one may initiate the ritual.*

* First, pick a day where you feel confident enough to explore your mind, that you feel calm and relaxed. From what I've seen from most successful attempts documented, this would preferably be a summer’s day, since the sun rises early in the morning, making the ritual shorter and easier to finish.
* Then, before nightfall, place the box in the middle of your selected room, then poke a hole through one of the vertical walls of the box, in alignment to where you think your eyes are going to be. The next step is crucial, the participant must then put the mirror 2 meters away from the box, to the northwest angle of the hole, and moonlight from the window must be able to illuminate the mirror. Change where the box is facing if necessary. The hole should be big enough for one to see the mirror in their peripheral vision, but not big to a point where more than the your eyes are exposed. The mirror should be placed in a way that is barely visible if looking directly out of the hole, the participant should only be able to see it in their peripheral vision. **NEVER**, should you directly look at the mirror during the ritual.
* Finally, to ensure that the ritual can be successfully initiated, one must put all eight candles in a circle around the box. The candles have to be around 5 to 10 inches away from the box, not so close that the box could risk catching on fire, but not so far apart that things could easily pass through.

With all of the preparation in place, ready yourself. When the clock is one minute away from striking midnight (11:59 PM), light all the eight candles and climb into the box with your support object, then close the lid. These must be finished within one minute; the ritual would start right at 12 AM. Make sure that no light can shine into the box, that is, no one can see you, apart from your eyes, outside the box. If you can’t see the moon when lighting the candles, or the room being slightly illuminated by moonlight after climbing into the box, immediately exit the box and leave the house, the ritual has failed. If there are pets inside the house at that point, don’t expect to see them ever again. **DO NOT** come back until at least 24 hours have passed. Once you’ve returned, immediately burn the box and smash the mirror.

But suppose the conditions are right, and you can see the mirror in your peripheral vision, then the ritual has begun. Although the candles are lit, you won’t be able to see candle lights inside the box, the room would look dark, as if the candles aren’t lit at all. The only light source present would be the moonlight. But you will know that the candles are lit, you will *feel* it.

Once you’ve climbed into the box and closed the lid, the ritual has officially begun. Your mind is now the box, and it is your job to meditate it, to find peace. You will now begin exploring your mind. To successfully learn yourself, you must undertake another perspective, that’s what the mirror is for. You must now imagine yourself being inside the mirror, looking out at the box, seeing only the eyes of the person inside it. What do they look like? What do they sound like? And most importantly, what are they thinking? Now, you mustn’t be too honest when imagining your own thoughts: Think only positive thoughts. It has been proved that thinking about happy memories and self-motivating ideas work the best. You must imagine yourself as the happiest person on Earth; the more negative your thoughts are, the more likely the ritual will fail. After all, it can be very dangerous for one to hate themselves.

Throughout the ritual, you must only look ahead of you, **NEVER** directly at the mirror. And as you examine your mind ‘outside the box,’ the room will feel more and more unfamiliar, one would start developing a feeling of uneasiness: many have said that they would start doubting everything they see, and they would not be able to identify some objects in their room. One to two hours into the process, and one might not recognize their room at all. Then, as you continue your exploration, you could almost see the box’s lid in the mirror slowly opening, with something crawling out, you won’t be able to see it clearly, but you will *feel* it: feel its presence, feel it coming closer, examining and exploring you. That thing is you, exploring your own mind, searching for meditation. Remember: think positively and don’t look at it.

If at any moment during the ritual, you feel the candles going out, or you’ve accidentally looked at the mirror, immediately close your eyes, hold tightly onto your support object and say internally (never out-loud), “I have explored my mind sufficiently; now I only wish for a normal life.” Repeat until you feel a sense of calmness, with your support object slightly radiating heat in your hands. The ritual has failed, and this is your only chance of ending the ritual. Afterwards, leave the house at once, don’t come back for another 24 hours; once you’ve returned, burn the box and smash the mirror.

As of currently, no one knows what will happen if the ritual has failed with one also failing to end it. There has been instances documented of people informing their family members that they will attempt the ritual, only for their family to return the next day finding only the mirror in the room. The box, with the person inside, has completely vanished without a trace. To this day, no one knows where these people went.

But if one upheld the rules, thinking only positively of their mind and never looking at the mirror directly, then the ritual would likely be successfully performed. It would end as soon as the sun rises and one can see their room clearly. The length of the ritual depends on the time of the year and the region one is in, but as soon as one can see all the details of their room, and the room has again felt familiar and friendly, they may exit the box. The ritual has now ended, you don’t need to leave the house, but remember to burn the box and smash the mirror just in case.

If the ritual has been successful, then you would never again in your life feel confused, disoriented, or saddened. Your life will be illuminated with happiness and calmness. You have successfully meditated your mind and found peace.

Congratulations
