I used to run a food truck in East Los Angeles. I won't tell where or what it was, but I had decent business for a very short time before the likes of Food Porn on Instagram began to take over. I remember going to markets when food influencers were the make-or-break for your business. If you had something big and juicy with a catchy phrase like "Hummingbird Cake" or "Firecracker Chicken," you might go viral, and business would be good.

For me, someone who comes from a background of 'grande cuisine,' I was never good with social media. Maybe it was because I was born in the early 1980s and I just couldn't click with the charisma needed for the eyes of a doom-scrolling teen with the attention span of a fruit fly.

The truth is, my food truck never really picked up, and I remember the guilt I had when my mom was the only customer at one market. I felt like crying and giving up then and there. I was in my early 30s and was soon to be out of money. It was either take out a loan and try to survive for another few months or throw in the towel.

I sold the truck a week later with everything inside of it. It went to a Korean Fried Chicken franchise that was branching out their operations to sell food outside of financial-tech companies in West LA.

Mom got me a job cleaning with her for the next three months, which wasn't as bad as everyone thinks. I preferred the night shifts as no one would see me carrying a vacuum cleaner and bucket in the middle of the day. LA can be cruel like that; if anyone from my high school saw this, no doubt gossip would kick off—maybe even a photo taken of me and shared in their group chat.

It was here that I craved the night shift. My sleep adjusted, and I preferred the silence of the city when there was no traffic and no crowds. It also brings out other loners, who feel more comfortable without others seeing them—and it's here that I met Terry (that's not his real name, but you get the picture), who was a delivery driver dropping off the next day's groceries into these buildings.

Terry was a musician from Flagstaff, Arizona, and had tried to make it in LA as a folk musician, but that was years ago, and he was now doing nightly food deliveries. When I would finish up a floor and see Terry stacking the fridge, we would sit in these empty offices and chat about the struggles and hopes we still had in ‘making it’ with our respective crafts.

Terry was friendly. In fact, he became the only friend I had for a while. We encouraged each other to get back to doing what we love, and sure enough, we did. I would cook for him, and he would play me music. Our only guests were my mom and sometimes Terry’s roommate, who would join us in those early dawn mornings after work. It was a special time for us, and it did give me some confidence being able to whip together a meal that was appreciated. It reminded me of why I got into cooking in the first place: to see the joy and delight in someone enjoying your creation.

Call it manifesting or fate, or whatever you want, but after a few weeks of this, I got a phone call out of the blue from an agent, asking me if I wanted to work as a chef for a private client. I thought it was a joke at first; my food truck had been out of action for nearly six months, and I had no visibility anywhere. The caller's name was Heather (and yes, this is her real name), and after my queries on the legitimacy of this, she made it clear that this was an opportunity I couldn’t say no to - her client was a famous actor who wanted me to be his private chef. 

Without much to go on, I decided to meet Heather, who was late and only gave me ten minutes of time. She told me her client was an actor who was preparing for a role and needed an in-house chef for three weeks while he got ready. I asked, “Why me?” To be honest, I didn’t really get an answer—all she said was that this actor had requested me and only me.

When she offered $15,000 for three weeks of work, I said yes. When I told Terry who the actor was, he was shocked—it was someone that he’d been a fan of for years, an actor that started in television in the late 90s and became a household name in the early 2000s. Terry begged me to get face-to-face with him; he was inspired that if he could share his songs with this actor, he might have a second shot at his music career. I said I’d do my best.

I was driven up by Heather to the actor’s home, which was one of his many, and immediately struck by the sheer size of the property. It was really established as a sanctuary that didn’t remind you that you were still within the greater Los Angeles region.

I had my own sleep-out and was told explicitly by Heather that I would need to return to my cabin at specific hours and not look the actor in the eyes as he prepared for his role. I had a full schedule of what food needed to be cooked and by what time, which I found strange as any chef could pull together what was on this menu. It was basic and easy, but that’s what they wanted.

My first meal cooking for the actor was as to be expected. The kitchen was the size you’d find in a commercial restaurant, and the actor had a dog that would often come inside and sit at my legs. I didn’t get to see the actor at all for the first day; I could just hear him in a lounge room reciting lines for a film that sounded like it was a Holocaust story. I left the meal as prescribed, on the table with a glass of red wine, and went back to the sleep-out.

I woke up that night to the dog outside my door, scratching on it. The dog came in, sniffed the floorboards for a moment, and sat down. When I took the dog back into the main house, I finally saw the actor—but not as I hoped to. He was bare naked, standing in the dark hallway, totally frozen. When I entered, I apologized, but the actor didn’t say a word; he just stood there with his back facing me. I thought it must’ve been his method acting at play here, so I quickly went back to the sleep-out and stayed there.

That entire first week, the actor didn’t talk to me. He would come in while I was preparing meals, talking on his phone to his lawyer, agent, or publicist. I overheard his conversations were mostly about contractual questions or disagreements, but he was also dealing with a scandal that was stressing him out. One night, after I served his meal on the dining table while he was in another room, I put my ear to the door where the actor was attempting to see his ex-girlfriend and was paranoid she could ruin his career from a recent falling out they had. It sounded like he had hit her and was trying to ensure she remained quiet.

Now, I know I shouldn’t have done this, but I suppose I felt a little bummed that the actor never said thanks for the meals or even acknowledged that I existed—but I told Terry what I had heard on the phone. I knew it could get me in trouble, but I was bored and needed someone to talk to. Terry promised he wouldn’t say anything, and I believed him.

The next morning, I woke to the actor inside the sleep-out watching me. I was stunned to see him there; it was the first time he spoke to me directly. He wanted me to cook that evening for him and a guest, and he wanted the entire menu from my food truck to be available. I said sure. He then left immediately without saying any more.

That day, I cooked everything from my food truck menu with a sense of melancholy. Here I was, after failing with my cooking career, now working for an actor who actively asked for the very food that made me quit my food truck for good. I did what was asked, to serve the meals in their second dining room at a set period of time.

When I first saw her, I didn’t know how to respond—the actor’s ex-girlfriend was seated opposite him with her hair dangling over her face. I served the meal and heard a faint “thank you” from her. She looked up to me, and I could see her eye socket and lip had a series of thick stitches across them. I remember her wiping her mouth, which seemed to be wet with saliva. I didn’t look at her again when I was serving food, but I did hear the actor proclaim his deep love for her and how he wished her back in his home.

When I was washing up, I turned to see the ex-girlfriend now standing in the kitchen looking at me. Her face had been disfigured; I could see she was once probably a model and now what some would call a freak. She thanked me and then asked me if anyone else had been staying in the house lately, to which I said no. Then, she tried to smile, but it made her look worse, and she left.

That night, I heard crying come from inside the house that went on for hours. I didn’t go and check on her, which I now regret. When I woke up the next day, the actor was a totally different person. He was engaged, interested, and wanted to get to know me. He thanked me for the meal and told me it was his ex-girlfriend's favorite food, which she tried months ago, hence him wanting to hire me. I thanked him for his words and asked where she was, to which he claimed she went home early that morning.

She was reported missing in the news later that week, when I saw her face on a TV headline when I was picking up groceries. Back at the actor’s house, there was no mention of her. The actor said he was going to be away for the night to see friends and would be back early in the morning. He didn’t seem flustered or worried or upset - which I found worrying, he just asked me to watch over his dog while he was gone. When he left, I went looking around the house - most doors had been locked. There was nothing to be found. 

When I walked around the estate, the dog led me around the edges toward a cellar door which it sniffed curiously at. It too was locked, but I peered through the cracks of the door to see something - something fleshy on the inside. I used my phone flashlight to illuminate what was there, and I was convinced it was human skin beyond. The dog began scratching at the door as I too tried opening it. I used a hammer that I found in a garden-shed to bust the lock and pull the door open. 

The smell hit me first, at the bottom of the cellar were several dead piglets laying in a pool of blood. I walked down further to see some kind of strange shrine was in the middle of the space. It was about 5 foot tall, a statue in marble with 3 women standing back-to-back facing different directions. 

I looked closer at the statue, their eyes downcast, one held a torch, the other a key and the final figure held a dagger. The dog was licking the pigs blood as I scanned around the entire room - I could see at the feet of the statue were locks of hair and golden rings. I pulled the hair up to see it looked like his ex-girlfriends, but I couldn’t be sure. 

I went back outside, flustered, unsure of what to do. I got my phone and punched in the numbers for 9-11, but I stopped and called Terry instead. He told me he was coming over. 

I’ll let you know what happened when Terry finally got there.
