How we got involved with “The Deans"

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/chSDDteEVw


"We barricade the main entrances and make the hallways as cluttered as possible. Then cut the lights and make them have to find us. 

Mike, Demi, we're going to hit and run. Do some damage, get away, wash, rinse, repeat. 

Punch, you take Sveta and find those horses Herman was talking about.", Leo says. 

I can't say he's panicked, but the man is frantic. 

Mike and Demi seem to embrace his plan fully. Which makes sense. When you're a hammer and all that. 

But, it's certain death. And it takes someone a lot less brave to see that. 

"Fuck no." I say.  I look out the window at the throng of once-heroes, lit by dozens of slowly falling flares. 

"Excuse me?", Leo asks incredulously. 

"Your plan, it sucks. We'll die.", I reply, turning to face him. 

It feels like those killer's eyes of his are close to setting me on fire, but I don't back down. 

"Must have missed when you got educated on small squad tactics.", Leo states, dismissively. 

I sigh, taking a moment to collect my thoughts. 

"I don't think violence is the answer here. 

And even if it was, I don't think we have a snowball's chance in Hell of winning. 

You said my people were diplomats, negotiators? Maybe this is why I'm here.", I say. 

Leo shakes his head waving a hand dismissively, "Not like that. And we're talking people born and trained. You've barely had a body for a month. "

"I know, we're using a butter-knife for a screwdriver, but isn't it worth a shot?", I plead. 

"You watched them unload god knows what into a bar full of civilians. Sound like the kind of people that are up for a spirited debate?", Leo asks. 

"You understand the irony in saying that, right?

I guarantee you, Travis is down there right now saying some variant of the same thing. 

If this comes to a fight, I'm not much use anyway. Can you show me a molecule of trust, and let me try to get us out of here?", I ask.

"It's not you I don't trust Punch. I'm sorry , but I can't let you throw your life away for nothing.", Leo replies. 

There's silence between us and tension in the room. 

"Who's our leader?", I say aggressively. 

Leo stays silent for a moment, thinking it a loaded question. 

"It's you, dumbass. And for good reason. 

But you can't lead people you have no faith in. You end up doing exactly what you've been doing since we've got here, taking all the burden, and then making shitty decisions.", I continue. 

"Fuck you.", Leo replies. 

"I noticed you didn't say I was wrong. 

Keep staring me down, it's not going to shut me up.

The latest shitty decision was getting into a pissing match with the people outside. Back home, you'd never have done that. You'd have thought things through, made nice, maybe lied. 

I've got plenty more examples, and I should have been calling them out as I saw them. Instead I banked on you knowing what you're doing, and look at how that turned out.", I rant.

"So I suppose you think you should be giving the orders?", Leo says. 

"No, for the love of god. 

You’re our leader. Not me, not Mike, or Sveta, you. 

But you have to shake off the tunnel-vision this place is giving you.", I plead. 

Leo growls, turning away and beginning to walk around the room. 

"They already have one hostage, you want to give them two?", Leo asks. 

He's mad, but I think I might be getting through. 

"Probably happen once they get in anyway. 

I'm down an arm, and even if I wasn't, I’m nowhere near the soldier any of you are. 

Don't let them use me. If I'm taken, I'm taken. 

You aren't the only person that can make a sacrifice, Leo.", I say.

Leo's face is the human equivalent of a loading screen. He's not used to being questioned, and all things being equal, I wouldn't be second guessing him. But something about this place brings out the worst in Leo. 

"I don't think you're right. But you never signed on to serve under me either. 

Do what you want, I’m not going to stop you.", Leo sounds disappointed. 

It makes me feel like shit, Leo has done everything in his power to keep all of us as safe as possible. But I’d rather him be alive and pissed off, than happy and dead. 

" If things start going south, hit the ground. We’ll nail the freaks around you with everything we have.", Mike says. The look he gives me is respect. Maybe not confidence, but respect. 

"They won't give him the chance, it's the oldest trick in the book.", Leo says, fiddling with one of his firearms.

"Cheer up. Punch will probably fail, and you'll get to die bloody.", Mike jokes. 

"That’s not what I want.", Leo replies. 

"Could have fooled me.", Mike begins, walking over to Leo, "You're worried about catching up to the bishop, aren't you?"

To my surprize, Leo doesn't rage, doesn't balk. 

"If I am?", Leo asks. 

"Then I'm relieved, and so are the rest of us. It means you’re still sane.
But, take a step back and look at things. You keep the details under wraps, but we all know you've sacrificed a lot to get here. 

It wasn't for nothing. You saw something in this pastoral prick that no one else did. You called it out decades ago. 

Then, you rounded up the strangest group of abominations in the universe in order to stop him. 

Was it luck? Skill? Intuition? Who gives a shit. You saw a problem and devoted your life to fixing it. 

Maybe we take down the Bishop, maybe we don't. But from where I'm standing, I don't think anyone else would have stood a chance.", Mike explains. 

A flash of  a smile makes it's way onto Leo's face.

"You're full of shit.", he says, good-naturedly. 

"It's called crowd work, and I'm great at it. Doesn't mean what I said isn't true though. 

Now, let Punch get going and we'll discuss plan B.", Mike replies. 

I think about going armed, but I don't see the point. I carry half of a white tablecloth tied to a broom handle. I feel like a god-damned cartoon character, but I want my intentions to be clear. 

I open a side door, wanting to give myself some time to size up the situation. The smell of phosphorus, booze, and unwashed bodies hits me. 

I walk toward the crowd, trying not to draw attention till necessary. I work up the courage to raise the flag, and a patch of lawn to my right explodes. 

The crowd laughs, more flares shoot up into the sky. The group of paranormally enhanced lunatics scares the hell out of me. 

"I come in peace, for fuck sakes. I just want to talk.", I scream. 

I lift up my arms, turning slowly to try and show I'm unarmed. 

A sharp crack and I feel something hot fly by my cheek. It leaves me with a small, ragged gash. 

The crowd laughs as I hit the ground.

But I'm undeterred. The closer I get to the milling, bloodthirsty mass of hellbound Heroes and their enslaved beasts, the more I understand how outmatched we are.

I rise, trying to clear my head. 

As I do so Travis breaks from the crowd seeming to study me as I close the distance. 

I catch that edge of acceptance and calm, my mind trying to make sense of the throng of people and things in front of me. 

I find myself face to face with Travis. He's a head shorter than I am, but with an air of power and menace that’s undeniable. 

"Sorry, don't accept turncoats. Never know when they’re going to turn on you.", He says, aggressively drawing his strange weapon. 

I step back, hands held in front of me. 

"Wait! God-damn it, do people ever talk things out around here?", I say, shaken. 

Travis' eyebrows raise, he seems to think something over for a second. 

"You came out to surrender? I wouldn't mind going home early. 

Unconditional, quick, and we get to keep whatever the fuck you had that killed our Hellhound.", Travis states. 

My heart sinks, I start to sweat. I lose that intuition in my mind. 

"Well, yes and no. We don't want to surrender, I'm here to negotiate.", I clarify. 

My voice feels small, lost in the crowd. 

Travis chuckles. 

"Negotiate? 

You hear that everyone, he wants to negotiate!", Travis says. 

As he addresses the crowd, it explodes into laughter, jeers, taunts and threats. 

I close my eyes and breathe. 

"Also, what you have bound over there, is a ten year old girl. 

I mean, she was anyway. And I'm hoping when we get back home, she still is. If not, we're going to turn over every rock till we find a way to help her. 

You really cruel enough to keep her in a cage somewhere?", I ask. 

I get a reaction. Travis looks to me, then Alex, then back to me. 

"Horse shit.", He states. 

"I wish. 

She was trying to help us, and ended up catching a stray tragedy. 

Level with me here, is there any point in trying to work things out?", I question. 

Travis is thinking, my mind is slowly clearing. I get a small glimpse into who he is. 

"You think you know who I am, don't you?

I mean, what kind of guy fills a bar with bullets over an argument, right?

You get things are hard here. But for us, it's ten times worse. We exist with targets on our back. 

Your friend made me look like a bitch. I'm not the kind of guy to have an ego, but letting that go, it'd have been death. 

Word would spread some passer-through told me to go fuck myself. It'd give some of the dark shit around here ideas, and in a week we'd be getting hit from all sides.", Travis explains.

"Are you saying that he had no reason to?

You called out his family, dismissed his mission in life and demanded he help you out. 

You’re offended he stepped on your toes , but you were wearing big-ass boots too. 

You guys are butting heads because you’re similar. I don't know shit about how your people are set up, but clearly, you both have issues with authority.", I reply. 

"The therapy session is great, but things have picked up a little too much steam to just let bygones be bygones. 

Jesus though, are you serious about the monstrosity?", Travis asks. 

"I'd say, 'on my life' but that's kind of implied at the moment, isn't it?

Seems like you're asking for something.", I state. 

"I'm not asking for shit. I'm mulling over if it's worth bothering to acknowledge you. 

What we do here keeps the worst of the things that go bump in the night exactly where they should be. 

I'm not cruel, or twisted.

I've seen the plots and schemes that brew here. The world ending shit that's walking up humanity's driveway. 

I got away from management because I knew there was something bigger than stray demons, or cursed television sets. 

Would I like to do things bloodlessly? Of course, but that’s not where we are, Lefty.", Travis rant sends a chill down my spine.

It doesn't feel like things are going well. I scramble to think of something to prevent a diplomatic trainwreck. 

"What if I did understand what it was like for you here?

Or, could, at least.", I blurt, instantly regretting the decision. 

Stupid or not, it gets a reaction from Travis. 

"What are you saying?", He inquires. 

I think about retracting the comment, but decide against it, "I'm not saying anything.

But, hypothetically, if I was the kind of person to have a lot of insight, could we maybe actually negotiate?"

Travis smirks. 

"Sure.", he says. 

At the same time he pulls a sleek, black pistol faster than I can track and presses it against my forehead. 

Any connection to him or his people is squashed as the very real fear of having my brains painting the cobblestones takes over. 

"That being said, I want you keeping your 'insight' to yourself. 

Now, stop beating around the bush, stop wasting my time, and give me half a reason to not do what I really want to do.", Travis snarls. 

The crowd has gone silent. Flares start to extinguish one by one. Everyone knows the next gunshot will set off an avalanche of death and chaos. 

"The way I see things is you were damaged in two ways. Your ego, and your Hellhound. 

In regards to the first, you're just going to have to agree to disagree with Leo. If we had the time, we could all hash things out, but we don't. 

The second though, I think I have a way to make you and your people more than whole.", I say. 

"I'm listening.", Travis says, punctuating his sentence by cocking the slide on his pistol. 

"That house behind me, it's alive. It's not haunted, or cursed, it's ,it's own unique horror. 

It's been used as a glorified torture implement for god knows how long. There's power in that place, not just blunt strength and rage, but the power to warp space, and who knows what else. 

I could talk to it, get it to let you and yours in. 

But I need some assurances, I’m not selling you an attack dog. I'm taking you at your word that you aren't the villains Leo thinks. 

I want to know she'll be safe, that you will treat her like one of your own, not a caged animal."

"Cards on the table, if you are what you’re implying , you're a lot more valuable than any living house.", Travis says. 

"Not the first time I've been told that. 

But, is that who you are? The kind of person that just takes people?", I ask. 

The back and forth is as anxiety inducing as any fight I’ve been in. But as this thought hits me, I realise, this is a fight. More than that, it's my fight. 

"You'd be surprized at the kinds of things I can justify for the greater good.", Travis lets the comment hang, gauging my reaction, "But no, kidnapping isn't my jam. 

How do you know I’m not going to just tear down the place for paranormal bits and pieces?"

"I'm going to have to trust you. Assuming you don't put your gun back in it's holster that is.", I reply.

With a flourish, he holsters his pistol. Behind him the crowd is in stunned silence. 

“Better?”, Travis asks. 

“Moderately.”, I reply with a smirk. 

“The only fly in the ointment is the fact that me and Lenny need to clear the air.”, Travis says. 

“Between you and me, trying to change Leo’s mind is a fool’s errand.”, I reply. 

“Not looking for a new best friend. But if I’m going to be doing business with you people, I need to know there’s mutual respect.”, Travis states. 

“This a deal breaker?”, I inquire. 

“Sure is.”, Travis replies. 

“Well, here goes nothing.”, I say, pulling out my newest burner phone. 

"It's weird when you stop and think about it.", Travis postulates. 

"What is?", I ask. 

"How in the hell do cell phones work  here? No towers, no Wi-Fi.", Travis says. 

The thought never really occurred to me before. But now that he's mentioned it, the implication starts digging around in the back of my mind. 

"Hello?", Leo says as if anyone other than me would be calling. 

"So, I've almost got things worked out. But Travis wants to talk with you.", I reply. 

"Sure, put the piece of shit on.", Leo says. 

I hold the phone out to Travis, he shakes his head. 

"In person.", he states bluntly. 

"Did you hear that?", I say, nervously. 

"Yep. And I'd rather go bobbing for apples in a bus station toilet.", is Leo's answer. 

"He says he's concerned about safety.", I translate. 

"Things are tough all over. 

Are we making a deal here or no?", Travis replies. 

"Travis says he had the same concern. And he feels that if everyone does things quickly there will be less chance of any kind of betrayal.", I pass on. 

"I don't like where this is going. See if he'll let you leave.", Leo orders. 

I roll my eyes and cover the speaker. 

"He's getting cold feet.  Wants me to leave. 

Could you give an inch here? We both know if this comes to a war, you win.", I say. 

"No, but I’ll do the next best thing.", Travis begins snatching the phone from my hand, "Leo, buddy I'm getting real tired of wasting my time here. And at this point my kill-rection is starting to go away. 

You're safe coming down here, you have my word. If you don't feel like taking that, let’s discuss option 2. 

I pluck another three limbs from your unique friend here. We have a few people that'll sow him up quick enough he won't die. 

The best part is, there’s no way you let this schmuck retire after that. Then you can spend the next twenty years....", Travis is interrupted by Leo shouting loud enough I can clearly make out the words. 

"Okay! You've made your point, this is your town, good for you. 

Give me a minute before you go mutilating my friends. Or is that too much to ask?"

Travis doesn't reply, simply closes the phone and tosses it back to me. 

"That makes me feel a lot safer.", I say sarcastically. 

"Calm down. Even if I did, you'd be fine once you got back home.", Travis replies in a flippant tone. 

"I'm not so sure about that. But that's it's own story.", I state. 

Sweat is pouring off of me, too much to even think about hiding. The night is humid, and my nerves are shot. Everything hinges on these two hashing something out. 

The way Leo walks up to the group is the complete opposite of how I did things. He's not just armed, but he's armed for show. He strides up, fearless, replying to the odd one of Travis' people brave enough to level a threat or insult. 

I shake my head as he joins us, mumbling, "Fucking Christ, Leo."

Flanked by two men taller and wider than himself, Travis is still feels like the biggest person on the street. 

"Talk.", Leo says.

"You're the one who sent a negotiator.", Travis replies. 

"I didn't send anyone.", Leo clarifies. 

"Leo, use your words man.", I plead. 

"Yeah Lenny, listen to your friend.", Travis taunts, unhelpfully. 

"I hear a lot of things about what it takes for one of us to get here. Now, I'm not one to believe in every bit of scuttlebutt I hear, but when I get here and the first group of Deans I meet go scorched earth because I can't drop everything to help? 

Makes me wary.", Leo says. 

It's not how I'd have started, but for Leo, it's an amazing show of manners. 

Travis mulls things over before speaking, "I'm never going to convince you in a night, that what I did was necessary. 

How about this though. 

Legend has it, the Deans stop hearing the call because we strayed from the path. 

God, Allah, the universe, whatever you believe just cuts off the utilities. 

That's not how it goes though. See, there is more than what we know. More forces out there than the ones we fight for or against. 

Places that make the void seem like a well mapped suburb. Thankfully they are all far, far away. But here is the closest they get. The void may be a buffer, but even it can't tune out all of the interference. 

So our connection to the call fades, becomes finite. 

Being here is torture Len. Every one of us is being slowly bled, and we're doing it to make sure humanity at least get's a warning if something comes down the pipe we've never seen before. 

I liked Aggie, and a lot of those people in her bar were good folks. I know, back home no one would consider what I did right. 

But I’m thinking about the billions of Aggies back home. I'm thinking of every human, every Fae, spirit, alternate reality, everything. 

It's twisted me, but that's what I signed up for."

I'm actually stunned at the eloquence. For a second I nearly forget this man has our lives in his hands. 

"You've got a ten year old bound in chains.", Leo replies, his tone stoic. 

"You think I knew that going in?

Leo, you're enough of an odd duck, I didn't really get a chance to look into your friends. 

The kid gets to walk away no matter what. 

Your friend promised me the house, but my people are going to need some kind of show of respect on your part.", Travis says, tossing an old looking handheld tape recorder to Leo, " We haven't been able to contact management in about 6 months. I need you to take that to them."

Leo looks the device over, "I'm not on the best terms with management.". 

"That's what makes it a show of respect. 

I know what's waiting for you if you make it back. You either die, and whatever wave of shit the Bishop has planned hits the world, or you stop him and get punished for going AWOL for a few decades. No evidence you just averted a world ending event. 

We have a deal?", Travis asks. 

I expect rage, or defiance from Leo, but I see an unfamiliar look on his face. Acceptance. 

"It's a big ask, but we've both caught a whiff of what's beyond the void, and I think the Bishop has too. I'll take your message.", is Leo's reply.

"You absolutely sure you don't want to end this with a scrap? We've got a mimic I was dying to see go up against that clown of yours.", Travis replies. 

"As interesting as that sounds, we need to get back on our own path.", Leo says, with a small chuckle. 

The two embrace each other with a gesture that is half hug , half handshake. 

"Lucky you had lefty here though. This was shaping up to be a real shitstorm. ", Travis says, giving a subtle 'stand down' hand-signal to his people. 

"My name's Punch.", I interject. 

"Lateral move really. 

So, Punch, you care to make some introductions?", Travis asks. 

We make it back to Page. It takes me a few minutes, but while she is wary of  Travis and his people, she trusts me. 

"You pulled it off?", Mike says, slapping me on the shoulder. 

"Good show.", Demi adds. 

"What about Alex?", Sveta asks. 

"They're letting her go. 

But now that we've put out the latest fire, we need to talk about how we’re going to take care of the bishop.", I say. 

Leo is walking around the room, it's interesting to see him interacting with people more like himself. I wave him over. 

"What's the plan for when we catch up with the bishop?", Sveta asks. 

"Hit him with everything we have.", Leo replies simply. 

"Is that going to be enough?", Mike inquires. 

"It's going to have to be. We’ve been chasing our own tails and trying to survive so much, we haven't really had time to research.", Leo answers. 

The reality of the statement hits us all at once. It's demoralizing, and beyond that, terrifying. 

"Whoa, what's with the depression cloud?", Travis says, joining us. 

"Just realizing that we're going into things pretty much blind.", Mike answers flippantly. 

Travis raises an eyebrow, "You came all the way here without a plan? A for effort I guess.

I've got you covered though.", Travis whistles, from his crowd of people, a man who looks to be pushing 80 comes forward. 

His hair is thin and white, one eye is clouded, and the other seems well on it's way. 

"Ashton here, he had a run in with your Bishop once upon a time. I'll be the first to admit, he never lets the truth get in the way of a good story, but I think there’s plenty of steak with his sizzle on this one..", Travis explains as the old man joins us. 

"That thing, he was the reason I came down here. He's had a lot of names, and a lot of faces, but he ain't from this world. Not a demon, or void touched. He's something else entirely. 

Thought he'd died till we got tangled up with you. 

We didn't managed to stop him back then, but we found out a lot about him. Maybe some of it could be of use to you.", Ashton says. 

The old man takes us to an old, dust covered table. He cracks open a beer, and lights a cigarette his rattling lungs protest against. 

And that's where we will leave things this week. What Ashton is telling us is giving us insight, I need to process it, and relate it to you folks.

Till then, keep watching the shadows. 

Punch.
