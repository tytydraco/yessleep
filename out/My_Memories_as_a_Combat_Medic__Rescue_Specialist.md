The scream of the turboprop engines is a physical thing, vibrating in my teeth as we descend into a chaos of black and white. Below, the Ocean’s Resolve is a dying beast, her stern sucked under the hungry, slate-grey maw of the Bering Sea. My world narrows to the open jump door, the howl of the storm, and the distant, frantic orange dots of survival suits on the water.

“One minute!” The pilot yells!!!

I see them as we start to hover. Men, clinging to a life raft that’s already half-submerged, their forms stiffening in the spray that flash-freezes in the -20°F air. The water is 38 degrees. A death sentence measured in minutes.

I jump, the shock of the plunge driving the air from my lungs. It’s not cold at first; it’s a white-hot burn, a million needles spearing through my dry suit, followed instantly by a muscled deep ache. I fight to the surface, my training overriding the primal scream in my skull.

The first fisherman I reach is already gone. His eyes, wide open behind a glaze of ice, stareing through me. His fingers are locked around a safety line, a statue cast in salt rime and frost. I have to pry his grip loose, the finality of it a cold stone in my gut.

I hear the children before I see them. Not screams, but a choked, terrified whimper. Two small, oversized survival suits are tethered to a frozen body—their father, maybe. He’s hunched over them, a final, futile shield, his back a sheet of ice.

“Look at me!” I roar, swiping ice from their faces. Two pairs of terrified eyes, blue-tinged, find mine.  “Let’s get you outta here” I yelled

The hoist cable descends from the circling HC-130. I work fast, my own fingers becoming clumsy clubs. I clip the first child into the rescue basket. I hand signal to the pilot, and they’re whisked up into the roar, a tiny bundle against the infinite grey.

Turning back is a nightmare framed in ice. The remaining fishermen are silent now. Their movements, just minutes ago frantic, have slowed to nothing. One man is trying to pray, his lips moving soundlessly, each exhale a puff of steam that crystals on his frozen beard. Another simply stares at the sinking bow of his ship, his expression one of profound, accepting defeat. The sea isn’t just drowning them; it’s sculpting them, encasing them in a second, glittering skin.

I grab the second child, the smaller one. “Your turn, buddy. Look at the plane. See the plane?” He’s shivering violently, a good sign. The bad sign is the quiet one. The still one.

As I secure him, my eyes sweep the scene. A man five yards away lifts a hand, a final, weak gesture. Then the hand stops. It doesn’t fall; it just stops, held aloft by the ice forming in the fabric of his sleeve. He becomes a grotesque monument, a piece of the sea itself.

The cable returns. I hook the boy, send him skyward. My mission is a brutal math: two saved. The rest, a gallery of frozen ghosts.

The hoist pulls me up last. Dangling, spinning slowly, I have a panoramic view of my failure. The Ocean’s Resolve gives a final, gurgling sigh and slides under. The men around the raft are no longer men. They are white shapes, merged with the seafoam and floating ice, their postures etched in a final, desperate ballet.

Back in the thunderous heat of the cabin, a medic wraps the boys in blankets. They’re crying, a beautiful, awful sound. I peel my helmet off, my own face numb. I look at my hands, red and raw, and I don’t see the two I pulled from the abyss. I see the five I left behind, their frozen, pleading eyes already haunting the empty space between heartbeats, their silent, icy forms forever adrift in the churning, black water of my mind. The Bering Sea didn’t just take them; it printed their final moments onto the back of my eyelids, a cold, permanent negative. The warmth of the cabin can’t touch it. Nothing ever will.
