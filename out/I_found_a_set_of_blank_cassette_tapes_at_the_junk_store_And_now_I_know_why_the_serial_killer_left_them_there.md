What [began](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/rNJGCHHomx) as an innocent adventure, had ended in the [loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/kGvzdj80TC) of our innocence.

But the journey wasn't over yet. Somewhere... out there in the fog, were five more bodies and a killer. A killer that, according to the tapes that I'd found in the junk store, was responsible for eight deaths, and now a ninth...

...My friend Mike.

"If you're listening to this, you've found the first three bodies. To find the fourth, fifth, and sixth, look for the island in the marsh, and proceed to the dock on its easternmost side. Not far from it, you'll see a pile of stones. Remove the stones, and beneath them, you'll find the next three bodies. Once you find them, switch to tape six."

CLICK.

I took the headphones from around my ears, placed them back around my neck, and began to relay the instructions to Jess.

But before I could even finish what I was saying, the fog had cleared, and my friend had already spotted the very location of the next burial site.

"The island!" Jess called out, pointing to a forested mass of land that stood out in the distance from the marsh's otherwise flat horizon.

—

After traversing another hundred yards or so of muddy terrain, something that, by now, Jess and I had both become quite accustomed to, we finally reached the dock.

We had spent most of the walk in silence, still unable to comprehend what we'd seen back at the wrecked boat, and still unsure who exactly to blame for Mike's death.

But after climbing up onto the dock and following it to the very mound of stones described on the tape, Jess finally spoke.

"The faster we move these rocks, the faster we find the clue, and the faster we wake up from this nightmare."

I didn't know what to say, so I just started grabbing stones and tossing them to the wayside as fast as I could, as my friend joined in and did the same.

We'd cleared out all but two of the rocks, when suddenly, Jess stopped what she was doing, and simply stared at one of them.

"What's wrong?" I asked, before she proceeded to turn the stone around and reveal the letter "N" carved into it.

"It's one of the clues." Jess said, as I found the letter "E" carved into the other.

Remembering the first two clues we'd found, I spelled out each of the four letters that we'd discovered.

""J" "A" "N" E"" I said, throwing the rock away.

"But who could that be?" Jess asked, doing the same with hers and revealing the spot on the ground where the next three bodies were buried.

"I don't know, but we'd better keep going." I said, as I began to dig in the dirt, already huffing and puffing from exhaustion.

But Jess put her hand on my shoulder and urged me to stop.

"Wait. What's the point?" She began, "You already know that they're down there. Why dig them up? Haven't you seen enough dead bodies for one day? And we already have the clues. Just play the next tape."

She had a point, and I was much too tired to argue, so I switched tape "5" for tape "6", called Jess over to share my headphones, and pressed play.

CLICK.

"If you're listening to this, it means you've found the fourth, fifth, and sixth bodies. That of a family. A mother. A father. And their child. Guilty of perpetuating the myth of familial love, and instilling in their offspring, the very values that keep that myth alive. Should the child have gone on to live to old age, it too, would either have become like the widow, or left one behind. To find the seventh and eighth bodies, switch to tape seven."

CLICK.

I did as the narrator suggested, and switched tape "6" for tape "7."

CLICK.

"If you're listening to this, you've found six out of the eight bodies, and are ready to search for the last two. To find them, simply follow the path into the woods, until you reach the old cottage with no windows, and knock on the front door. The man who lives inside will welcome you in, and take you to the last two graves."

CLICK.

—

We'd been following the path through the woods for some time, when we finally arrived at the old cottage, its exterior windowless, exactly as the tape had described.

Jess and I walked up to its front door and stood there for a moment, both shaking in fear.

*These tapes found their way to you, not us. They chose you. You were the one who was meant to get us into this mess, and you are the one who's meant to get us out of it.* Reminding myself of what Jess had told me after we'd met the old fisherman, I worked up the courage to go on, knowing that something terrible was very likely waiting for us inside the cottage...

...And knocked on the door.

After less than a minute of waiting...

...Someone opened it.

Contrary to my expectations, he was a rather short man with a bald head and a boyish face.

"Welcome. Come in, come in." He said, gesturing for us to enter, his high-pitched voice counterpoint to the ominous one that I'd heard on the tapes.

*It can't be him.* I thought to myself. *Plus the tapes referred to the man who lived in the house in third person, not first.*

—

A few minutes later, Jess and I were sitting inside the home, warming our ironically cold bodies by a fireplace that our host had started for us.

"Are you the killer?" I asked, wasting no time.

"A killer of what?" The man squeaked, answering my question with one of his own.

"People!" Jess added, "The ones buried out there in the marsh."

"There's people buried out there?" He replied, "That's news to me."

"Then why'd you ask... of what?" Jess asked.

"Well, a man has to kill all sorts of creatures to survive out here. Birds, squirrels, even mice. Speaking of which, you must be hungry."

He stood up, walked over to a door in the back of the room, and began to open it.

"Wait!" Jess called out, "What's in there?"

"Dinner." He replied.

"Let us come with you then." I insisted.

"Very well."

—

Upon stepping inside, the man reached for an old string light switch.

I gripped Jess' hand, fearing the worst, but when the dim bulb turned on, hardly emanating any light into the dark room, I could see that he wasn't lying...

...Hanging there on hooks, were all sorts of creatures. Birds, squirrels, and even mice, just as he described.

Jess and I both took a step back, clearly disgusted by the dinner options, when the man laughed.

"Oh, come on. Meat is meat, and you said you were starving. Now, I'll cook them up, just take a seat over there in the corner." He said, pointing to the shadowy corner of the room.

Despite her better judgment, Jess looked into the darkness, and did as he suggested.

That's when I heard her fall to the ground, and start screaming.

"Jess!" I called out, as the man laughed.

He simply smiled at me and pointed to the darkness. "Go on, take a look."

I backed away from him, took a step into the shadows, and looked down, to find a pair of side by side graves, each dug deep into the dirt, and one currently occupied by Jess.

"You said you weren't the killer!" I cried out to him.

"I lied," He replied.

"But the voice on the tapes?"

"Oh him? He was just a guy I hired to record them. Told him the tapes were for a game."

"Our friend died because of those tapes!"

"Did I kill him? Or did curiosity?"

"He said he saw you, and you left him there to die."

"Indeed I did, but only because he wasn't supposed to be there. None of you were supposed to be there. Or find the tapes in the first place."

*But wait, Jess said I was chosen to find them. But if not me, then who?*

"Jane!" I called out, remembering the clues. "Who's Jane?"

"She was the one who was supposed to find the tapes. I would tell you to listen to the last cassette, to hear the full story, but I'm afraid you won't have a chance to do that. Anyways, as I was saying, the tapes were meant for Jane, as was the grave your friend is standing in. But..." The man continued with a smile, "...You two will do."

That's when suddenly...

...He lunged at me, in an attempt to tackle me into the other grave.

What transpired next happened too fast to comprehend, but the next thing I knew...

...The man was lying there at the bottom of the other grave, his eyes wide in disbelief...

...As the broken, rusty tooth from the bear trap that I'd taken with me to remember Mike's death, protruded from the killer's neck.

And as he lay there dying, his body writhing, blood pouring out of it, I reached down into the second grave and helped pull Jess up to safety.

She gave me a great big hug, and we both stood there shaking for a minute, before I removed my headphones, held them up for us both to share, switched tape "7" for tape "8," and pressed play.

CLICK.

"If you're listening to this, you've found the last two bodies in the marsh. That of myself, and my dear Jane. A pair of lovers guilty of the most tragic love of all... unrequited love. Myself, with nothing but love to give, and Jane, having given all her love away to another. And if you must know how I lured her out here, you have to understand our bond over the macabre. Our fascination with disappearances, cold cases, and unsolved mysteries. Surely if Jane made it this far, she found the tapes that I'd left for her in the store, and couldn't resist the call to find the bodies in the marsh. And after making her way all the way out to me, here we'll lie, unrequited lovers meant to die apart... united in death for all eternity."

CLICK.

"What the-" Jess said.

"Um." I replied, gripping Jess even tighter, my wounded arm, wrapped in my plaid shirt, draped around her shoulder.

Now that the journey had ended, and after all we had gone through, the thought of finally kissing Jess right then and there crossed my mind, but before I could...

...She called out. "Hey, Tyler."

"Yeah?" I replied.

"Is that what I think it is?"

"What?"

I turned around to find, of all things, another wooden box, resembling the ones we'd found at the first couple burial sites, just lying there on the floor.

And after crouching down to pick it up, I opened it to find, not another clue, but instead...

...Eight more tapes, wrapped in a flimsy old rubber band, just like the ones that I'd found in the junk store.

"Let's not listen to those." Jess said.

"Definitely not." I replied.

A few days later, as news of Clinton's reelection flooded news headlines, my town did their best to keep what happened under wraps, and held a private funeral for Mike.

As a reward for us finding the serial killer, and his eight bodies, the police withdrew any charges associated with the meddling that Jess and I had done, out there in the marsh, and kept the first set of tapes for themselves.

Unbeknownst to anyone else, Jess and I kept the second set, and ironically, buried it behind our house, in the town where the marshland is so expansive that it was named for it. A town that we got married in, had kids in, and still live in to this day, making humble livings, and keeping as far away from the marsh as we can.

To this day, whenever we pass the spot on 139, where the bend of the road meets the sharp turn sign, we think of Mike, and keep our eyes on the road, careful not to look out into the marsh, towards the scarecrow, or the boat, or the island.

Oh, and that basketball season that Jess had a good feeling about on the night that we set out on our adventure... is still the worst season on record for the boys in green. I still tease her about it daily.
