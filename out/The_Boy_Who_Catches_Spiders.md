My flashlight is ready. Fresh batteries. Reliable little thing — silver in color, with a tiger-head logo on the handle.

The moon is full, lighting up the entire town of Hilaga — a small town in the north of the Philippines. The weather is perfect too: warm and quiet. Spiders love warm nights.

I’m just waiting for my Lola to fall asleep before I sneak out. I know her routine — she checks on me three times before bed.

First check: A loud, “Iho, are you still awake?”
I don’t respond. Just close my eyes and pretend to sleep.

Second check: Ten minutes later, her voice is softer: “Iho, are you still awake?”
Still pretending. A little fake snoring helps sell it.

Third check: This one’s the hardest. She comes to the foot of my bed. “Iho…” she says softly, then pulls the blanket over my back, tucking me in.
That part always makes me sleepy. But not tonight. Tonight, I need to stay awake.

There’s a fourth check, but that won’t come until morning — before the rooster crows.

I wait. My bedroom door creaks as it closes — not all the way, just enough to leave a sliver of light. That’s my sign: Lola is in bed.

Now’s the time.
I move slowly. Open the window. Sneak out. My small body makes it easy.

The moon is so round, so bright. I almost don’t need my flashlight, but I carry it anyway — just in case. I’ve brought empty matchboxes too — my spider containers.

It’s spider derby season in Hilaga. People bet good money on spider fights. My plan: catch the best spiders and sell them.

Old legends say the strongest spiders come out during full moons — fast, smart, aggressive. And vulnerable, too. The moonlight exposes them on their webs in the bushes.

The trick:
Open your palm.
Move slowly.
Close your hand over the spider.
Blow gently — they’ll get sleepy.
Then into the matchbox they go.

I reach the bushes. Something feels… off.
I ignore it. Focus.

I don’t know how long I’m out there, but I already have four spiders in a matchbox. Just four more, and I can go home.

The moon feels brighter now — like it’s watching. And I feel something else watching too.

I spot a spider between two bushes… but something moves in the corner of my eye.

Fast. Big. Dark.
Doglike.
My flashlight can’t catch it. It vanishes, leaping from one bush to another.

I don’t believe in ghosts.
But something’s out there.

I back away slowly. Too late.

It’s in front of me now, hiding badly.

My flashlight hits it — a massive dog, crouched low.
Black eyes locked on me.
Teeth sharp.
Ears pointed.
Fur shiny and black.
The size of a carabao.

I don’t blink. I know if I run, it’ll chase me.

Then it steps out.

I turn and run. Trip. My slipper flies off, but I don’t care.
It’s fast — in seconds, it’s right behind me.
Hot breath on my neck.

Then it leaps. Not on me — in front of me.

I fall, sliding in the dirt.

It towers over me. Growls — deep, horrible. Then… stops.

It sniffs the air. Turns. Runs back into the bushes.

I don’t wait. I sprint home, barefoot, lungs burning.

I climb through my bedroom window. Somehow, I make it.

My spiders are still in my pocket. Relief floods me.

I jump into bed as Lola stirs. I stay quiet until I drift off.

When I wake, she’s at the table sipping coffee.
I sit down, still aching from the run.

She nods toward my plate. “Eat,” she says. Then adds:
“Your slippers are under the table.”

My blood runs cold.

Under the table — my slippers. Covered in dirt. Exactly the way I lost them.

I look at her. She’s not looking at me. But for a second… I see a glint in her eyes.

Like moonlight.
Reflecting off a predator.

She smiles — too gently.

I look down at my food.
And eat in silence.
