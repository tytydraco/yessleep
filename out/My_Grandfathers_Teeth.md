The holidays are always an emotionally very confusing time for me. I love the decorations, the festive mood, but I also feel a melancholy nostalgia that lingers in the back of my mind. Not a yearning for younger times, but vague childhood trauma and family inadequacies bubbling to the surface. My sister and I individually still live in our hometown. My parents do too, and so did my grandparents. I have no desire to move, I do really like it here. That doesn’t mean though that I’m not affected by the proximity of parts of my past.

I practice Wicca in a modern, cultural sense. I was raised loosely Catholic, and I still celebrate Christmas. But I also celebrate the Wiccan sabbat of Yule which overlaps with Christmas. It’s nice to be able to have something to share while also having something for “yourself” to enjoy and experience. This year’s holidays were different though. Surprising, but not shocking, my grandfather died.

He was ninety-two, so his passing was not unexpected. Active and mentally alert up until the very end, but still, ninety-two. Just the timing of being so close to the holidays was not foreseen in the brief overview of planning for his passing that my parents, sister, and I happened to discuss earlier in the year. Getting funeral arrangements made for December 20th was a pain, but we got it done. We made it simple. A public wake and a private funeral. Of my family, I was the closest to my grandfather and I felt treating his death arrangements in a more logical, left brain matter just made sense and wasn’t insensitive at all. He would have wanted people to move on quickly and continue with their lives.

I learned of Wicca from my grandfather. Many people are surprised to hear that being Wiccan, or a witch, is not just some New Age fade. My grandmother was Wiccan too. My mother, their daughter, decided not to practice which is of course totally fine and her decision. I decided though that Wicca really aligned with my values and felt best for me. Cooking, especially baking is a main aspect of my practice. Since I was a kid my grandfather and I would bake together in his big kitchen. Savory or sweet galettes (depending on the season), witch’s bread pudding using buttery brioche bread, and much more. Nine out of ten times, we made perfect creations.

Wicca is very much individual-centered. While my grandfather and I practiced together, he also encouraged me to develop my own practice for myself as he did his own. When my grandmother died three years ago, it was nice to see that he had a “system” in place for himself to process the grief in a healthy way. What exactly that system was when he was alone, I’m unsure. But it worked for him.

Speaking of speedy death arrangements, I happened to get a call from my grandfather’s lawyer maybe 10 minutes after the funeral. He wanted to go over my grandfather’s will. He was able to arrange a meeting for my family and I to come into his office the following day. The convenience was very nice.

We all sat down in front of the attorney’s desk. “It’s honestly one of the most simplified wills I’ve ever been designated to carry out,” the lawyer said.

“As he stated in his will, you are already aware he is donating most of his money to charities and causes he cared deeply about. However, he left $10,000 total to divide amongst the four of you equally.” Thankfully, we all understood and acknowledged that we knew this well in advance. No one contested it. The lawyer handed each of us a check for $2,500. The lawyer proceeded.

“The only thing left is this.” The lawyer lifted up onto his desk a small, old wooden chest that was maybe a foot wide and half a foot tall. The dark brown of the wood was almost black, which matched the black metal of the hinges, lock, and corner edge plating.

“This is for you Zack.” The lawyer handed me the chest. My family looked at me inquisitively but said nothing. Right then and there I tried to open the chest, but it was locked.

“Is there a key?” I asked.

“No” the lawyer replied firmly. The lawyer then stated that my mother was designated as the executor of his “estate” or what would happen with the rest of his belongings like his home. That concluded the will distribution and the lawyer ushered us out the door because he assumingly had other things to do.

The plan was we would all get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at my parents’ house, which was normal for us, unfortunately. I drove back to my place. I put my keys down in the bowl by the door and took the chest into the kitchen where I placed it on the dining room table. I made myself a mug of herbal tea and then sat in front of the chest, thinking. Should I try to pick the lock? Do I try and pry it open?

I gently shook the chest. I couldn’t hear anything inside. Was it just decorative? That doesn’t seem like something my grandfather would leave in a will. Wicca tends to be utilitarian, and that’s how my grandfather was. Practical, but not in an emotionally detached way at all. He didn’t like giving or receiving gifts. He liked to show his care by providing experiences, acts of service, words of affection. Baking was a clear example of giving an experience of the senses.

I left the chest on the table and decided to light a fire in the fireplace. Some find it contradictory, or a dichotomy? I don’t know. Anyway, people find it weird that I use natural kindling from the woods but put one of those packaged logs you light on top of it. To continue the theme of Wicca, I think it’s a perfect representation of the practice. “Old” and “new” together. I lit the fire, and it immediately went up in a roar and then settled down. It’s a traditional fireplace, it doesn’t use major flammables like gas. The wood must have been really… dry? A moment after the fire settled, I heard a thud come from the kitchen. I got a little scared. Just in case, I grabbed the fire poker hanging near the fireplace and slowly walked to the kitchen.

Stepping into the kitchen I looked around. Nothing was there. The door that connected the garage to the kitchen that I normally walk through was closed, and so were the windows. I looked over at the dining room table and saw the chest. That, was open. I walked over to it and looked inside. I had to blink a few times to make sure nothing was in my eyes, and that what I was seeing was actually what I was seeing. There were eleven teeth scattered within the chest.

A shiver shot up my spine. Teeth? Real human teeth? How did I not hear at least a rattling when I shook the chest? The question in itself made me uncomfortable. Whose teeth were they? I had to assume they were my grandfather’s. Where else would he get human teeth? I thought of the worst possible scenario. Did he hurt someone to get these? I was just being paranoid in the moment. I never saw my grandfather get even remotely angry at anything. I don’t think I ever even saw him slightly irritated. Is that a good trait, or the trait of a psychopath?

I needed to calm down. I know my grandfather. Horribly, these had to be his teeth, and the coroner or funeral people didn’t notify us because, for some odd reason, they didn’t see his missing teeth as abnormal. Maybe they just thought he had poor dental hygiene? There was a part of me that wanted to pick them up and inspect them, but the shock was still subsiding in me, so I didn’t. 

It’s an old chest. It must have been spring-loaded and broken open. I left the open chest there and decided to bring my tea over to the couch near the fireplace and just relax. I would try reading a book I was almost done with and organize my thoughts about this discovery after. I decided not to tell my parents and sister. At least not so close to Christmas. Again, I already feel weird around my family this time of year. It’s not an emergency, and I wouldn’t want to sour their Christmas and create more tension just like I wouldn’t want my Yule shaken up like that. If I was going to tell them what Grandpa left me, I would wait until after the holidays.

Only three to five pages into reading, I started to smell a really pungent odor. It wasn’t bad-smelling, just really strong. It was cinnamon. I didn’t add anything to my tea. I thought maybe some of the wood I was burning could be producing a smell? I went over to the fireplace, but it wasn’t that. I remembered I had mini cinnamon brooms hanging outside each of my house’s doors. I thought that was ridiculous, because how could they suddenly become that strong in smell, but I checked anyway. 

I opened the front door and the cinnamon smell hit me like a wave. Yes, it was ever so clear that it was coming from the cinnamon brooms. When I bought them, you literally had to put your nose up to them to smell the slight scent they held. Now, it was as though the scent radiated off them like a nuclear reactor. I checked the one outside the connecting garage door, and it too was overwhelming.

For those that don’t know, in Wicca, it’s tradition to hang a cinnamon or spiced broom outside your door during the colder seasons’ sabbats, especially Samhain/Halloween and Yule. It’s a very contemplative time of the year. The brooms protect your home from “bad energy” and ground you in the physical realm while the veil between life and death is… thin. They’re symbolic. The same concept applied to lighting fires in the fireplace.

Whether you notice it or not, air circulates through homes constantly. Air pressure changes dramatically simply by opening and closing doors. My home is on the older side so I thought there must have been a particular draft where a wind was strongly wafting in the scent of the brooms toward my house and then through tight spaces even though the doors and windows were closed. I really couldn’t think of any other way. I went back to reading.

I finished my book. Albert Camus’ “The Fall.” I liked “The Stranger” better, but overall this was a good read too. It was around 9:00pm. The glowing fire had relaxed me with its light flickering within the room. However, that feeling left. My heart sank a little. I remembered I needed to do something with the chest of teeth. I turned and saw it on the table. With the lights off it mainly just looked like a darker black spot within an already dark room. I finished my tea which was cold at this point. I decided to just leave the chest there. I’ll get a good night’s sleep and figure out what to do with it tomorrow. I put out the fire with cold ashes, showered, and went to bed.

I jolted up, leaning forward in bed. I had woken up feeling panic. I checked my phone, it was 3:00am. There was silence. Did I have a nightmare? I took a few deep breaths. As I was going to lay back down, I heard a faint sound. It went away after a few seconds. I heard it again. I was certain it was the sound of children giggling. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from outside or somewhere inside the house.

I checked my phone again. I didn’t accidentally have any audio playing. I thought it must be the Alexa playing something downstairs. I got out of bed and the immediate feel of the cold wood floors on the bottoms of my feet added to the tension in the air. I have a semi-auto shotgun in my room’s gun locker but I felt getting it out would be excessive. I slowly made my way down the stereotypically creaky stairs.

Not even fully down the stairs I saw the red light from the Alexa which means I indeed did not forget to turn it off before bed. No sound was playing. The on-and-off sound of children giggling had stopped. The pungent smell of cinnamon still filled the air downstairs. I turned the living room and kitchen lights on and began to look around. On the kitchen counter next to the stove, my bag of baking flour was sitting there, open. The windows and doors were still closed and locked. I looked outside the front and back windows. No one was out there. Nothing was disturbed or out of place, minus the bag of flour being out. I then saw the chest on the counter, of course still sitting there.

I went over to it. I felt a desire to see its contents again, still not believing what the chest held. Looking inside, I saw it was completely empty. The teeth were gone. The doors and windows began to shake violently. I could hear the hinges rattling, but they stood strong. The child laughter came back loud. I realized the laughter was coming from outside the house, all around. It was utter chaos. It felt like a fever dream. Clearly, it was now not excessive to go get my shotgun. I ran upstairs, got it out of the safe, and ran back downstairs. I didn’t know where to look. The laughter was coming from the doors, the windows, the roof, everywhere, but I could see nothing. Then, as quickly as it came, it was silent. The doors and windows stopped shaking. The laughter stopped. The cinnamon smell dissipated. I stood there, in a sweat, holding my shotgun. I felt scared yet relieved at the same time. 

I don’t like the police. People roll their eyes at me when I say it, but I believe in community self-defense. I did not call them to report this, nor was I in the mood to go outside and investigate. Maybe this was a deranged, elaborate prank from neighborhood kids… who I didn’t know lived on this street. Maybe I was hallucinating. I went to the kitchen where I keep my medication to check that I hadn’t missed any doses, or taken more than I should have by accident. I happened to see the bottle of melatonin I recently bought. 10mg. Of course. I usually take 3mg tablets and only take melatonin occasionally. I must have not been paying attention when I bought it, and forgotten that I took some melatonin before bed and my body was reacting strangely negatively. I’m always sensitive like that. I literally have to stop drinking coffee at least eight to nine hours before bed because of the caffeine.

I double-checked the doors just to soothe my mind. They were still locked. So were the windows. I even checked the chimney shoot. That was closed too. I left everything as it was. The lights on, the flour bag, the chest, I just left it as is. I went back upstairs and put my gun away. I laid my head to rest. It took me about an hour to go back to bed, but I eventually fell asleep.

When I woke up in the morning, I showered, got dressed, and went downstairs. Everything was fine. The lights were off and the flour bag was in the kitchen cupboard. The doors and windows were still closed and locked. I made some coffee and went to head out to run some errands. Right as I was leaving, a thought entered my mind. The missing teeth. I went over to the chest and looked inside. The teeth were back where they were. Well, I figured they were always there. I figured everything was what and where it normally was. The melatonin just messed me up last night. I brushed it off and left the house.

I came back home about an hour and a half later. There were still some leaves falling from the trees from Fall, so I went outside and did some raking. The crisp, cold air was refreshing and cleared my lungs. I paused for a moment. It was a nice feeling, but the air had a tension to it. No, more so a very slight vibration. A presence. An anticipation lingering in the background. I chopped it up to the weird seasonal imbalance. Fall holding on tight, not letting Winter fully sink in. Climate destruction making every year warmer. I finished raking, put the paper bags of leaves on the curb, and went inside.

I made another fire in the fireplace and got cozy with a new book. It got dark quickly. Shortly into reading, the fire did a roar. It was the same quick blaze that occurred when I lit it the day before but now just on its own, not right when I lit it. I thought that I needed to be more careful with the wood I chose because it was getting dangerous. Maybe 30 seconds after that, the giggling started. The children’s laughter slowly began to surround the house. I quickly accepted that this wasn’t last night’s excuse I told myself. This wasn’t me. This was real.

I got up and headed toward the front door to investigate when my grandfather’s box on the table, which I continued to not do something about, began to shake in its place. I slowly walked up to it. It shook violently. The teeth, again, were gone. The doors and windows began to shake again. The children’s laughter grew and got louder. The scent of the cinnamon brooms became overwhelming. I ran upstairs and grabbed my gun. When I came back downstairs, rushed to the door, and almost turned the doorknob, something stopped me. I felt a sudden feeling that stopped me in my place “telling” me not to open the door. A part of me wanted to proceed, but I continued to feel the sudden emotion guiding me to stay inside. Do not open the door.

I walked backward to the center of the room and just stood there. I let everything just occur. The fire roared again but continued blazing instead of the one-quick burst it had done twice before. The chest shook even more violently, and so did the doors and windows. The stench of the cinnamon stung my nostrils. The children’s laughter increasingly became deeper and deeper until it sounded purely demonic. It was booming all throughout the outside of the house. I just stood there. I stood in my place and protected my home. If it, whatever it was, came inside, I would defend myself. I had no other choice.

Amongst the cacophony, another sound did manage to make itself known. The short, clear ding of my oven’s timer. As it did its single ring, everything stopped. The fire went back to normal. The chest, doors, and windows stopped shaking. The cinnamon scent died off. The laughter was gone. I went back over to the chest, and the teeth had returned. It was all over. What was also there was the bag of flour, back on the kitchen counter.

For the rest of the Yule season, I left the chest open on the table. The day Yule ended, I closed the chest and put it on the shelf in the living room closet. My grandfather taught me when I was younger of the Yule children. Some Wiccan cultures like witches in Iceland call them the “Yule Lads.” I was always taught of them as strictly a symbolic tale to uplift the idea of protective energy in your home. I was told the group of at least thirteen “mischievous” children were from a witch couple that practiced “dark magic.” They were supposedly the souls of children who did not pass over due to random accidents or unexplained reasons, from parents of those in a nearby village of the witches who lived in the woods or mountains (depending on which recollection). The witches would call to the spirits to stay with them, and these thirteen did. Eventually, the witch couple suddenly died. It is said they sacrificed themselves to some entity, unknown.

I had Christmas with my family and went back to my normal life. What else could I do? Call the police? What I experienced was what I experienced. It was real. People experience supernatural events all the time. Some true, and some fake or misinterpreted. This was no Wiccan myth. Instead, I saw it as a positive and profound event that, if anything, confirmed for myself my spiritual practice even more. It was a miracle. Months passed, and Halloween season came around. My favorite sabbat, Samhain.

I was in the kitchen baking to really bring a warm feeling to the home on a chilly Fall night. I could hear the wind rustling the leaves outside. It was really nice. I put the dish into the oven and set the timer. Then, the sound of slight shaking occurred. I walked into the living room to see where the sound was coming from. I listened, it was coming from the closet. I walked over to the closed closet door. Yes, it was coming from inside. I knew it was the chest. It had to be.

I just stood there. I didn’t know what to do. Do I bring the chest back out on the table? Do I leave it where it is and let whatever happens, happen? I just really didn't know what to do. I still don’t know what to do with my Grandfather’s teeth.
