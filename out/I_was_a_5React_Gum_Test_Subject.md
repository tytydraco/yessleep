Most people probably remember those 5 React gum commercials that came out in the mid-2000s. They somehow made chewing gum look like the coolest thing in the world. It was a cinematic experience that put other commercials at the time to shame. 

I remember back a few months before the commercials first came out, the Wrigley company was doing a casting call for the actors. I figured it would be an easy gig since it was just a simple gum commercial. How hard could it be? Being a broke college student, opportunities like this were way too good to pass up on. 

The casting call went way differently from anything I expected. Me and a group of actors stood outside a local mall where we had to wait for business execs from Wrigley to pick us up. Shortly after we all arrived, a large black van pulled up and a guy in shades welcomed us inside. I found the whole thing kinda sketchy, but I had bills to pay so I was willing to put up with almost anything at that point. The six of us all got in and chatted with each other to pass the time until we got to our destination. It turned out that all of us came from a similar background. We were all just college students trying to scrape together whatever money we could before inevitably falling into debt. It was reassuring yet incredibly unnerving that poverty was such an ingrained part of the college experience. Maybe I should've gotten a major in education because it was clear that the college board had perfected the art of legal racketeering.

It wasn't until about 40 minutes into the drive did I noticed that the trip felt oddly long. I lived in a major Californian city at the time so there were commercial studios literally everywhere. The van eventually parked in front of a high-rise building in a quiet part of town. We exited the vehicle to step inside and were immediately floored by a burst of cold air. It was a much-needed relief from the summer heat.

The men in suits led us to a small room where we were given a change of clothes. It was a bunch of grungy-looking tank tops and jackets that looked like they came from a sci-fi movie. It was definitely an odd choice for a gum commercial, but I wasn't complaining. We were then handed a stick of blue gum and told that it was mint flavored. I was surprised when they didn't hand us a script. Apparently, they just wanted to film our natural reaction to the gum. Like I said earlier,  it was going to be an easy paycheck.

I took a bite of the gum and as I began chewing, my senses went absolutely wild. My surroundings were replaced by an Arctic tundra being buffeted by intense snowfall. The freezing winds chilled my entire body over to the point that my teeth began to chatter. The other participants and I were all freaking the hell out. What kind of drugs did they lace this gum with? We all shared the same hallucination and could even touch the snow as if it were real. The snow even loudly crunched as we walked around. I've experimented with drugs here and there, but I've never experienced a high that felt so lucid. Getting high usually feels like stepping into a dream, where everything is ethereal and nothing has any weight to it. 

The snowfall began picking up at an extreme rate. We were soon getting buried by an endless blizzard that spawned out of nowhere. We all ran around like headless chickens until the trenches of snow made it impossible to move. I felt my blood turn to ice and my heart beating against my chest like it was trying to break free. Was I about to die?

We jolted back to reality, sweat profusely racing down our heads. The Wrigley executives smiled widely at us while writing down notes on their clipboards. They told us that the Wrigley company was developing a brand of gum completely unlike anything else. The gum was made with special chemicals that could induce realistic hallucinations in the brain. The experience only lasted for a few minutes, but the high I got from it had me hooked. I needed more of that rush.


Each stick of gum they handed us was a new sublime experience. I was sent to tropical getaways, rainforests, the middle of the ocean, and just about anywhere in nature. The commercials everyone else is familiar with are just a mockup of the real experience. Nothing could ever compare to the real thing. My mind was completely taken over by the need for more stimulation. Nothing else in the world mattered to me anymore. I needed another quick fix.

I was so elated when they handed us a new mystery flavor. My mind raced at the idea of getting to experience another burst of euphoria. I excitedly bit into it and was transported to yet another world.

This world was different, however. I fell into an endless white void, my shrill screams being the only source of sound. We all looked at each other in shock as our bodies fluttered through the air. My body plummeted for what felt like eons until we crash-landed in the middle of the ocean. I tried to rise to the surface, but that water engulfed me whole and submerged me deeper. I watched a woman next to me drown before she was dragged to the bottom of the sea by a cluster of tentacles. 

The rest of us managed to swim to the surface, but it hardly did any good. A bolt of lightning struck down on the water and zapped us to a crisp. The funny thing is that it wasn't just the pain I felt. Fear, excitement, and even pleasure coursed through me. My mind was shifting through every emotion I ever experienced. The emotional whiplash of it made me feel like my mind was being ripped apart. The water then turned to ice, encasing me in an artic coffin. Scents of peppermint and citrus tickled my nose while the rest of my senses faded into nothing. 

I woke up in a hospital three days later. My Doctor told me some guy in a suit dropped me off here and left without saying a word. I looked over at my drawer and saw an envelope that was stuffed with money, more than enough to cover my college costs. Attached to it was a note that made it explicitly clear not to reveal what happened that day or there would be dire consequences. 

That day still plays in my head all these years later. It's just crazy to believe that I almost lost my life over some gum. I tried getting in touch with my costars from the commercial but they went completely off the grid. Their social media accounts were left vacant with the only activity being their friends and family asking them on their wall where they went. I imagine they had an even worse experience with the mystery flavor than I did. I wonder if they're even still alive. Even when I write everything down in this diary, I can still hardly believe what happened to me. My life has never been the same since then. I've tried in vain for several years to chase after that high. No amount of narcotics could ever compare to how that experiment made me feel. I've been in and out of the hospital for overdosing more times than I can count, but it doesn't matter. I'm willing to try anything to recapture that feeling. My bank account is currently on its last legs and most of my friends won't talk to me It's almost funny, really.  Who would've guessed that a simple pack of gum could've led to such a downward spiral?
