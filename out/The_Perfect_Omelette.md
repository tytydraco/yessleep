*Start by cracking two eggs into a jug, whisk and add 2 teaspoons of milk and a tablespoon of warm butter then HELLO? HELLO?*

I started at the screen in disbelief, butter still in hand, was i reading it right? was the next instruction Hello? I placed the butter down and picked up my phone scrolling further down the page, I continued reading…

*If you can read this it’s not too late! I’ve hacked the servers, THE GOVERNMENT ARE LYING TO YOU*

This is when i became skeptical, i’ve seen things like this a lot lately, everyone thought the government was lying about the new virus going around, Lurocia30, it attacks the immune system then goes for the nervous, unless treated practically immediately your dead within 20 days. Everyone who’s died from it has been found without skin, still muscles, veins bones and all that, just no skin, the public put it down to the fact the virus was flesh eating and moved on, but a group of anti-government activists started saying the government was doing this, they are called “Speak Up and Shut it Down”, SUSD for short, they hacked the local news channel once but they have never gone as far as this, hacking websites! I rolled my eyes and continued reading.
 
*you might think this is some part of the stupid SUSD movement but it’s not! please please believe me, it’s not a virus! it’s a monster, and we created it. I am sorry i don’t know why we did what we did, but it’s done now and there is nothing i can do expect warn you, and beg you do not go outside! it’s been set loose, it escaped, that family found without skin yesterday, was it’s first meal, it’s claimed over 250 more victims during the night that we, the government, hid from the public. the monster we created, Creation876, is to cut down the human population, it was made to kill off the weaklings, it knows who to go for, from the tracker we can see it’s in the Summer-field area, LA, so i’ve hacked the servers in that area.*

I gulped, starting to get nervous, whoever this was, did hack the SF area, and he was right about the family who go skinned, i was beginning to think this wasn’t just some SUSD prank, i felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up so i sat myself down at the breakfast bar and slid the kitchen knife into my reach and continued reading 

*Creation876 is highly intelligent and has the ability to shape-shift, it can mimic loved ones voices etc so BE AWARE OF WHO IS AT YOUR DOOR it knows your weak spots, there is no known way to kill it but all i can tell you is that if you don’t let it in, it cannot get in, do not invite the beast into your home in any way, carry holy water and a cross with you, that will offer some protection, and pray, morning and night  pray for yourself, pray for us, pray for the world. I don’t have long before my boss sees that I have typed this and removes it, he will probably feed me to the beast afterwards but i will die happy knowing i have saved some people, please take this seriously and do not let it in, do not go outside! to temporarily paralyse the beast, strike it on the make sure the ingredients are whisked evenly then pour into the pan, cook for 7 minutes at gas mark 7 then serve with salt and pepper garnished on top.*

No! NO! I felt my blood run cold as the message disappeared, i grabbed the knife and scanned my tear filled eyes around the apartment waiting for the beast to claw through my window, i turned the stove off and began to tidy the ingredients away, knife still in hand, i swung the fridge door open frantically and screamed and i heard a loud knock on the door 

“WHOS THERE!”
I tried to sound intimidating but the tremble in my voice gave me away

“Jenny, Jenny it’s Daniel! Did you get that warning!?” 

I sighed a sigh of relief, Daniel was my brother, i’d recognised that squeaky voice anywhere 

“Danny thank god, are you okay?”

“Jenny i’m fine just shitting myself please let me in sis”

“Doors open, come in, lock it behind you”

“Got you”

I froze… i realised as it was too late what the website said… it mimics people! i just invited it in… i raised the kitchen knife and watched the handle slowly turn, squeaking, almost screaming like it knew what was about to happen. I saw it’s mangled arm reach in the door and claw at my wall, it’s deformed face peered through the crack smiling at me, taunting me like a cat playing with its prey before snapping its neck, i dropped the knife covering my mouth as i screamed at it, no words could describe how foul this beast was, it looked like a human, but inside out, blood dripped from the veins hanging from its mangled face it’s teeth like razors lined up in its unhumanly grin, as i stood there mouth agape i watched it sprint and me tackling me to the ground as it began ripping the skin off my stomach feasting on the raw flesh, it’s making its way down to my legs as i’m typing this… it’s too late for me but it’s not too late for you, it can multiply, it’s not all over the world the government no longer control it, it has free reign and is killing anyone it sees. DONT LET IT IN! ITS NOT YOUR FAMILY ITS NOT THE ONES YOU LOVE ITS THE BEAST. I FOUND IT THOUGH I FOUND THE WEAK SPORT! To kill the foul thing strike it as hard as you can on the
