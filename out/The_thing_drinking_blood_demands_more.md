It started maybe 20 years ago. My house had been emptied by the passage of time, leaving only an old man in his rocker, counting the days. The knocks on the door started so soft, innocent. That day, had I known what it would become, I’d never have helped, but how could I not? When I opened that door and saw it before me, I couldn’t turn it away. 

At first, it was scared to ask. It would make itself known with its desires, only visible in its eyes. I’d reach my hand out, and it’d bite softly. Its small hands grasp onto mine as it suckles my essence. I wouldn’t even realize what it had done. Sometimes, I’d even set aside some, just in case it chose to appear. I liked feeling wanted, the sensation unmatched, and as it grew, I knew I had a part to play in it. 

Each year that passed, it would double in size. Its teeth grew as well, but at this point, I was so used to giving that I didn’t notice the larger holes present on my arms. Each visit drained me, and as my health declined, its appetite grew. It was starved of access, so whenever the opportunity came, it struck. It became a habit for both of us, void of its initial intent.

After I had retired from work, the visits became more frequent. Soon, I wasn’t able to sustain the being any longer. Now it could walk on its own, understand me, and the few times I rejected it, it knew how to mock emotion and make me feel guilty. I would tell it to wait till Friday, and I’ll be good to go, and like clockwork, it would appear again as if dying. I knew it was fine on its own. The being would go months at a time without me and survive. Yet in a matter of days, it would latch onto me like a starved animal all the same. It didn’t care about the nutrition; it could attain it elsewhere. 

I lost my house a few years after retirement. I didn’t have much money for myself. Whilst I prepared to move myself out, unsure of where to go, I heard a knock at my door that was familiar yet foreign. The knocks were hard, distinct, and intentional. I opened the door, and blackness enveloped my view. I looked up and saw the being’s face staring down at me. 

“Not today, I don’t have anything for you.” It stood motionless, as if coaxing me into submission. “I said no.” My frail body began to quiver before its imposing nature. It never showed an inkling of violence in the past, but I’ve also never outright denied it. After a few moments, its mouth began to open. Crackling between each movement, a face elongating down its body. Its rows of jagged, stained teeth presented themselves as it began to breathe. A sharp, raspy breath concludes with the sound of deathly thralls emitting from its throat. 

It spoke, reaching its hand out to me, “Come.” Its voice sounded hollow yet deep, breaking yet decisive. I had no reason to feel like I was in danger, and so I took its hand. 

We traveled for hours till we approached a clearing in the deep forest. The soft green grass intersected with the entrance of a cave, large in size. The being gestured for me to enter as I was met at the opening by another being. One which looked similar, yet distinct from the black abyss I’ve fed all these years. They grabbed my things and ushered me deeper into the cave, further from the bleak moonlight. As I traveled, two small beings ran around the cave, resembling it from its earlier years. I looked at the being, and he looked back. His eyes creased as his expression feigned humanity. I felt pride for the first time in decades. Why is it that I felt happy for this horror’s success? Was there beauty in its ability to carve a life for itself? A life carved from my sacrifice? 

I didn’t know what to feel; I didn’t have time as a crevice was prepared for me. A small desk, a bed, and a rocker lit by candles. It was here that I spent the rest of my days. Each passing moment, another memory is lost. The only reminder of my existence was the entity and its family.

First, they came to me together. The little ones are learning how to feed. Before long, they grew and grew, resembling their father. They didn’t need the guidance; they knew the source. But even then, their hunger only grew. They drained me of everything, each time greeting me with a smile.

I can’t leave this chair. My health won’t allow it; I think they wish to keep it that way. And as I write this, I see the silhouette of the youngest in the doorway. It approaches sheepishly; it’s the first time she’s come alone. She comes to me, climbs atop my lap, and smiles before digging her teeth into my arm as they always have. And when she’s done, she hops down with the money in her hands and says, “Thanks, Grandpa.”
