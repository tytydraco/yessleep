So for this, I'd rather not tell you my real name, or any of my friends. So I'm going to make up fake names.

It was a couple of months ago, and me and my buddies decided to go out on a camping trip. Wanted to hunt some deer and fish. Normal things people would do during camping. We live in Texas so we are pretty big on guns around here, and we brought pistols for the 4 of us and 2 Rifles. Anyways, Devin, messaged me saying, 

"Hey, you got everything for the trip?"  
"Yeah everythings good."  
"K, meet us at Jim's."

Jim's was a famous bar around here, and we often go there to just get filthy drunk. Not one of my best habits, but everyone has their flaws, right? Anyways, we meet up there and everyone talked about what we were going to do when we got there. We decided to drive in "Davids" Van, and we got everything put in there and went on our way. It was about a 45-minute drive before we got there, and we had a little bit of beer. Not enough to make us too tipsy. 

We got out and chatted outside for a while, looking at the forest around us. The smell of pine trees was incredibly strong. Everything was overgrown, but one thing was strange, trees had claw marks, and it wasn't just one or two. Dozens had these claw marks. They varied in size and the number of fingers. We kind of brushed it off and didn't really care. After a while, we got done setting up the tent and decided to go ahead and start fishing. 

Hours passed and we all were pretty tired and didn't catch anything. I needed to go take a leak and I told the others to head back to the tent and get ready for bed.

I felt anxious going out, and the area around us was pretty open and I had to go far for some privacy. As  I got further away and was about to unzip my zipper, something caught the corner of my eye. It just stared at me. My heart started beating and I thought, "Am I just going crazy or something?" 

I just looked at it out of the corner of my eye. Watching it. Sometimes it twitched and got a little closer, but most of the time it stayed still. I yelled out, "Hello?" 

It responded. "Come here." Its voice sounded exactly like Devins.

"Devin, is that you? The hell are you watching me, man? Get back to the tent I'll be right there."

"Come here."

At this point, I knew something was wrong. I slowly started to back up, my eyes stayed wide, and looked directly at the shadowy figure. Due to that, I tripped on a rock and hit my head. It started to sprint after me, going on all fours, an adrenaline rush hit my head and I ran into the darkness. I screamed at the tent, "Get the guns!" Everyone looked outside the tent and wondered what the hell I was talking about. I sprinted to the tent and closed the door as fast as I could. Everyone calmed me down and asked what I saw.

"There was something watching me. It ran after me! It sounded like you, Devin."

Devin looked at me like I was batshit crazy, "Okay, you're messing with us. Jesus man you really had to do that?"

"Somethings out there! I'm not ly-" A loud scream made the tent silent.

'The fuck was that?" Will said, shaking.

We all sat still, looking at each other. Devin picked up a pistol and told us he was heading outside to find out what was going on.

"Hey man, just be careful." I closed the tent up behind him, I was ready to open it at any time.

Hours passed. He never came back. We three of us stayed inside the tent until the sun came up. We called the police and they searched for days but never found him. 

Man, this was hard to write and think about again, but I had a feeling that I needed to tell others about this. If you have any information on what this was, respond in the comments. Thank you.
