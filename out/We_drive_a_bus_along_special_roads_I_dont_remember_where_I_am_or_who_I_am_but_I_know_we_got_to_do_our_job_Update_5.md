They went into the tunnels. Security, that is. They told me they didn’t know how to find them. They told me the tunnels seemed to rewrite their pathways, sometimes. When I looked back towards the town, I felt the hidden road move a little higher. They told me that someone was willing to take over the shelter, and that security would watch the town a while and see if they could snag the fiend when it emerged.

I held the paper swan in my hand while one of the officers was filling me in on details. It was the same one who’d been on my bus just a couple weeks ago. I think, maybe, she felt responsible. Second time she couldn’t do much to help me, even though she’d done her diligence and at least tried to go in. I think she was shaken, too. She breathed a little strangely, and I’d seen her stop to eye my bus lights like they were eyes waiting to blink.

“It’s not your fault.” I can’t tell you if I was talking to her or me.

“I wish it were. Would mean I could’ve done something.” She hesitated. Shifted in her armor. “Did he come around again?”

“I’ve seen his car bend back into place like it was putting on a fresh coat of paint. I’ve seen him walk off fire. Just kept. Going, till it went out. Tallying up the things it burned so he could count up infractions later. It’s not your fault.” I was mumbling, then. I think I confused her. “Sorry, not the… The new whatsit. The Policeman.”

She looked at the little paper bird in my hands. “I don’t think it’s worth trying to remember.” I must’ve made a face, since she went quiet for a second. “We’ll get them, eventually, I mean. It can trip us up, but we can do the same with it.” Then she got on my bus. She put a book in my box, of all things. When I looked down at it, picked it up, I found it titled *Feline Care Manual for Dummies*.

Safe to say, it counted. She told me she’d ride with me to the next stop. She was on general patrol anyways, she said. I can’t really remember if that’s an actual thing, or not, but nobody stops her or calls her to go back.

I feel something trying to dig its hands into my scalp on the drive. I think I slipped up for a moment, realize that her helmet isn’t clear like they’re supposed to be. But I’m a bit drained beyond caring, and it felt like I was being looked in the eye when I checked my rear view, so I let it slide.

My Trainee sits in the bus seat just to my right and behind. Watches me work. “I’m headed to Goldsquare.” I tell her.

“Where?” She asks, eyes glued to the old highway we were driving on. The world was consistent around us. There were mountains in the distance, a lake. I could see, at the far end of the lake on the shore, an old town. Wasn’t sure if it was abandoned or not. But I think there was a post there. Benches. Maybe someone waiting. I think she can see some of the roads, but not all of them. Not all the strange folk can see the roads, or even see the whole breadth.

I park the bus for a bit. I look at her, then I stand up. “You want to drive for a bit?”

She seems startled, almost. But she doesn’t hesitate at all, taking up the driver’s seat. I coach her on getting it into ignition. Plop my hat on her head, and it kinda sits at a tilted angle cause of her one ear, propping itself on the bad one. I take it off. “We need to get you a proper uniform.”

“They’ve got outdated-” I hear the suiter pause. “-Appropriate clothing in that town by the lake.” She points. “I was there recently, it’s fine.”

“Alright then. Oh. Goldsquare’s a mall. An… Old one. Like they used to be. I go there when I need to clear my head, or I need something that’s hard to get around the between. Though I don’t remember a lot of what goes on inside. It follows…” I kind of search for words, then give up. “...Human rules. Wall rules. Don’t think we’d find what I need there for you, though. It’s. Newfangled.”

We go to the Community. Sign calls it ‘Fish’. Just that word. Someone’s clearly spray painted a picture of a fish over the old population count and directions and whatnot part of the sign, just in case you didn’t know what that word referenced. Honestly, some people don’t. Some people come from real strange places. It’s only got one town rule.

**DON’T FEED THE FISH.**

Under the big capital letters there’s a second sentence. *Unless you ask first.* It's pointedly underlined, three times.

I look over my shoulder at the suiter. Kind of cock my brow. “You got any idea what that’s about?”

“Animals get hungry and follow you if you feed them when you’re not supposed to. Kinda the same no matter where you go. Just uh. If you get tunnel vision looking at any of the fishermen, stray away from them. They’re… Not regular.”

I didn’t pry into why, but I made the note.

I drive past red, white, and blue buildings, with some splashes of dark gray and green. Lot of the roofs are visibly patched up. A few buildings no one really wanted have holes. Or maybe it was just too risky to try to inhabit them. Easy to breach someone’s privacy or take something you’re not supposed to if a place looks unused. The docks are long, old and weathered, and frame a sandy beach. I can’t quite remember if they’ve always been like that, but when I look up at the mountains they remind me of a severed spine. They just. Stop, even though it’s clear they should’ve risen up into another peak.

I park the bus at the stop. I see Copyhat’s face on the postings, and I get a nasty turn to my lips. I force it off, though. No need to growl in front of potential passengers. I put a sign on the door, and I watch the green circle on my poster turn into a yellow hand palm out to halt.

The suiter gets up and nods at me before walking out towards the docks. I kind of tilt my head and furrow my brow as I notice there’s a little bit of water dripping off her. I’m real curious, but I keep it to myself. It’s bright out, I started late morning and had driven into early afternoon. Kind of warm, the sun beats my brow. I go with my Trainee and find a stall selling clothes, manned by one of the river folk. A wave of cold, grabbing guilt washes over me, but I push it back down.

All their clothes are old style. I pick out what I need, get some replacements for myself for later on. I find some gloves that were just like my old pair, and that puts a little pep into my step. I end up trading a few things here and there next, nothing all that remarkable. I… I’m sorry. I don’t got that pep in me right now. I just-

**Trainee:** Would you like me to take over for a bit?

**Small pause. Driver:** You know what? Sure. You’ll have to be doing them all yourself eventually, anyway.

The Driver goes with me to the pier. I’ve put on my new clothes. We found someone who put holes in the top for me. I think I look nice. There are river people tending lines. I see dark water and darker shapes slithering and swimming in them, stretching out to the other side of the lake, but the sun reflects on the water anyways. It feels like a good place. As I stood there in the light, the sun’s rays glittered off my neck.

“...Huh.” The Driver looks like he really wants to ask me something.

“Go ahead.” I give him permission, gesture at my neck so he knows what I’m talking about.

“...Is that not your head? Those’re… Stitches, aren’t they?”

“They’re on my legs, too.” My collar is lower than it was before. But I didn’t care that he could see it. It was part of me. He doesn’t say anything else, just sits down with a wince and watches the water. He looks at the places where the black water manages to reflect shining light, and I think he was pondering something.

**The Driver:** Can I…

**Trainee:** Yes.

**Creaking of seat.**

He’s holding my hand, now. He’s old, but his grip is firm even when it shakes.

**The Driver:** Not gonna argue that.

I sit with him. “You can ask about me.” I tell him. “I’m surprised you didn’t earlier. You’ve called me friend but don’t really know me, do you?”

“You could’ve hopped right on off the bus any time. Gone for any other shelter. And you stayed with me. Expressed interest in my job, like it really did mean something. It’s… I don’t think you need to know someone for long to care about them. I’ve known people who presented as decent folk for a long time, then just. Changed. Or it turned out they were never really all that great in the first place. Or, hell, someone took their skin a while ago, I just failed to notice.”

“This isn’t my original body. Someone fixed me. At a place called Angelvale. I fell from somewhere very high, and I broke. So they put me back together.”

“Why do you want to drive the bus, anyway? You just… Jumped on the idea.”

“I want to see what this place looks like before I go home. And maybe show the people up high, and the people down low, what the other places look like, too.”

**Driver:** I think… I think I’m good, now.

I’m sitting there with her, watching the fish. I think I’ve fished before, but if I’ve done it it hasn’t been in quite some time. I can feel that digging sensation again, like someone’s trying to squeeze my head but only gently enough for me to notice. I briefly feel like I left something behind in the last town. But I know what it’s doing. That thing in the tunnels. When something claims you like that, it dangles you. Like bait on a hook. It wants you to know something’s left, make you wonder. Maybe get you thinking it’s as simple as finding lost keys.

But it’s not.

I think I see the suiter take their helmet off at the far end of the docks. I think I see water run out of it like she fished it out from the lake and hadn’t been wearing it the whole time. I see things in the water swim up to me, wondering if I have something for them.

“Who do you think we ask about fish feedin’?”

My Trainee just shrugs.

I straighten my glasses, and I see the Policeman plop down onto the road like it’s nobody’s business on the horizon, back on the highway I’d been following that skirts the other side of the lake. He drives real slow, like he’s watching me. But I know he’s not. He just makes the pass, vanishes. I’d heard he’s been watching the bus stops lately. Probably after Copyface. My other me sure as hell hasn’t been following all the rules recently.

I get a nasty thought in my head. I pull something out from my bag, a sandwich. I take a piece and toss it into the water.

It plops down, sinks halfway, almost makes the dip after bobbing back up, then is pulled under.

**Rabbit grinding teeth.**

Nothing happens. I don’t see any strange fishermen. Nothing comes up to grab me and drown me. The Lodge doesn’t appear on the horizon, line up a shot and put a hole in my hat. No sirens, no long, endless roads I wasn’t supposed to drive on. No gaps, no fuzzy memories or secret turns. We just sit there, and it’s quiet. Eventually, a flock of things that look like Ori, but with no pretense at being person-shaped, come around and glide on the water like cranes. They do some kind of dance, like an organized ballet group.

I wonder what happened, to make them not want to be a part of that. If they ever had been. I wonder if back in town, right behind me, someone’s getting asked to make a strange trade, and not knowing someone who just went out isn’t coming back. I wonder who makes up all these rules, tightens their fine print until they break the people they’re supposed to fix.

I know that someone’s got to drive the bus. And that’s what matters, no matter what the answers might be.

I go back, and get the people I’d kept waiting, get em’ on board. I make the checks, ask the questions, figure out where I’m going. Not for me, but for them. I make sure nobody touched anything they should’ve have, tried to get on without permission. I wasn’t in the mood for following rules, but I also wasn’t in the mood for losing passengers to semantics. Near the end point of the day’s runs, I let my Trainee take the wheel, let her make a small and quick stop, and everything goes just alright.

I start to take the wheel again. I double check everything had been done right. I’d watched her work, of course. So nothing slipped by. Mistakes are too dangerous to make these days. Everything was in order, but there was someone in the back who still hadn’t gotten off. I think for a bit. No, I’d seen them get on. But they’d acted a tad strange. They’d been antsy making the eye contact, seemed uncomfortable around the other passengers. They hadn’t really had a particular destination in mind, just asked if they could ‘ride with us a few hours’. Put a few bucks in the box.

We’re at a gas station. No matter where I drive, my bus still needs something to fuel it. Somewhere to shack up for a bit, get any parts replaced. I’m particular about my bus, so I usually ask for parts people keep tellin’ me are outdated, but they sure as certain work the same. The only thing I’ve really changed out is painting that wolf over the silver cat running along the side, gotten small tune ups to make sure I can keep up with or outpace a few of the local troublemakers.

I see my trainee filling up the gas. See her eyeing the last passenger. She looks a bit tired, going by her posture. I think maybe it was stressful, putting practice to execution. I’m kinda looking out past her, at the station. Wondering if it matches the ones I used to stop at, drive by.

I feel something cold and metallic touch the back of my head. I look in the rear view, and I see a small, mousy fellow shakin’ real bad as he puts a firearm he clearly doesn’t know how to handle to the back of my head.

Somehow, this feels easier. Less difficult. I don’t grab my wheel particularly hard, or squirm much. I look at the road ahead of me. “Son, do you know what it is you’re doing right now?”

He gives me the name of a specific town. I have to think for a bit, check the map, feel the road stretch out ahead of me. It’s out there, somewhere, but I know it by a different name now. “You’re going there. You got it?”

“Can I let my trainee back on? I don’t think it’ll be very kind to leave her behind.”

“You mean the freak? The *monster*?” **Disdainful lagomorphic snort.** “No way.”

I think that my Trainee can handle herself. I think that this particular spot, I know it’s safe, and I know the way back. So I focus on making sure that’ll happen. I still need to show her the mall. I still got to wait till I hear back about my lost passenger, see if they drag them out of those dark tunnels. And I’ve still got to drive the bus.

I start driving. My passenger sits down, and points the little pistol he’s got at me at an awkward angle. “If you’d be so kind, this is a new exchange. So if you don’t mind, put something else in the box.”

“You don’t get to make demands to me. You see what I got?” He waves the gun.

I size him up. It doesn’t take long to do. I know people. I know humans. The thing about us humans, is that no matter what, we’re predictable even when we aren’t. We’re always scared. We’re always not understanding. We’re always forgetting. I know what’s what, so it’s easy to decide.

“You don’t belong out here, do you? So you don’t know.”

“Know what?” He’s tensing up. I’ve stopped the bus.

“Fees have to be paid. There’s wolves out there, great fast ones. Giants. Deer that don’t quite bend right, lights in dark spaces that want everything you got and more. They take notice when things aren’t right. And they won’t be gettin’ fussy with the ones who aren’t makin’ a fuss.” I keep my tone measured and neutral. I know damn well what I’m saying might just get me shot. But I need to say what needs sayin’, else he won’t be getting where he needs to go.

“What do you need?” His voice cracks a little.

“Anything. It all matters the same to me.” I tip my hat at him, give him a weaker smile than I usually might so I don’t seem too pleased, put the bus in motion again. I’d started seeing something creeping up, something curious and eager. I let the little bits of tension that were building out of my shoulders. I look down, see he put a piece of paper in my box.

“Might I pry a bit?”

“Why?”

“Just curious, is all.” I see him relax, just a little, though he’s still pretty wound up. I get the feelin’ he’s pretty lost. I get the feelin’ he’s looking for answers, for something to hold onto, so I try to give it to him. He nods, slowly, eyes flickering all around.

“You from around here? The between.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” He frowns, winces and squirms. “I’m from-”

He says the name of some place or other, something with a W. It slides off my head like rain on a sloped roof. He’s got an accent that sounds real familiar. I recognize most accents, even ones from the bright spot at the end of the road. But I only place a handful for longer than a few minutes. I think, maybe, it just hasn’t mattered for a long time.

“Have you traveled much before?” As I speak, I watch the terrain. I notice how my bus goes further and faster than it might on a normal path. If I let my head wander a bit, I imagine horizons that are far longer, far more organized despite being just as varied. I remember the ocean, and that something is supposed to lie beyond. I can’t remember if there’s still anything across that lonely sea.

I wonder how many times I’ve told a story that didn’t line up, and how often it was because things slipped in and out of my foggy mind like ghosts. I wonder how many of these places out at the far end of my vision I know, deep in my heart and soul, but I just can’t quite grasp anymore. Do people out there belong where they are? Is everything still in order? Am I helping things be just a little straighter?

“...You okay, old man?” My passenger asks. I realize my hands are hurting as I’m grabbing the wheel. I notice his guard is slipping. But he’s not relaxing. As I follow his eyes out where I’m looking, I see recognition flash through his gaze. Recognition, and something quite the opposite. Like his whole world has been cut up and patched together in ways that don’t square up.

“I don’t think so. Haven’t been for a while. But don’t worry. I’ll keep driving till we get there. I don’t know if it’ll make much sense, what we see, but we’ll get there. And I know places. Good places, good people, who will give you a hand if you let them if you don’t like what you see.”

He’s quiet. Just watches the world skip by, takes in everything that’s changed, everything that hasn’t. Then he speaks. “I traveled a lot. I wanted to see the world. And so I did. All fifty states, I wanted to go somewhere special. Had a big old map, I drew something I thought was cool in every square. Do you mind if-”

“Go ahead.” And he puts down the gun. He didn’t seem like he knew what to do with it anyways. And he unrolls a map, shows it to me. I park by a small stop. A bus stop, of course. It’s in the middle of the desert, an absolute nowhere zone, but there’s still a handful of people sitting on the benches. He eyes them over his shoulder, breathes real hard, but I put a hand on his shoulder.

I unroll one of my maps. Compare it with his. I see sweat dribbling down his forehead. He’s interested in mine, I’m more confused by his. I trace my finger along the names. Along the roads. I shut my eyes for a bit, run my finger along them again. I feel like the roads used to be different. Very different. And they were straight. They didn’t go through rivers, or buildings, or secret tunnels. They were always more straightforward in the cityscapes, the rural areas that were inhabited.

Something strange clicks. An odd little thought. The thought that, even way back when his map made more sense than mine, there were roads others couldn’t see.

“I walked down a tunnel. A tunnel that smelled like… Like… Flowers. I saw a bunch of foxgloves. I’d heard some… Stories about it, so I’d wanted to check it out.” I think my passenger is doing his best to keep his voice straight. But he’s struggling. “Old man, where the hell are we? Is this like… Like…” I think he’s grasping for particular words. Special places, old betweens.

“I don’t know. I just drive the bus. I don’t remember many stories but ones like yours.”

He goes quiet. I think he starts concocting some plan or other. When you push someone into a corner, they get brave in the worst ways. Like he had just a bit ago. I’d seen it in myself. I’d seen it in the Policeman - especially him - and I’d seen people change because of it. Everyone but me. Everyone adapted but me.

“Huh.” I think I started muttering something to myself, then, since he looks at me odd before sitting down. Puts his face in his hands.

Other people get on. People that he tenses in front of the moment they get on. He doesn’t look any of them in the eye. Mutters a hello here and there, but he mostly just stays tense and silent. I do all the usual things, ask all the questions. And I drive the bus.

Eventually, we get to this town of his. I think it used to be where the square with the W in front was on his map. I see the Deer here and there on the way, and I don’t quite know why, but I think they reassure him. I think, maybe, just maybe, them being all curious and goofy was the one thing that made sense to him.

We’re back at Fish. If I look at the sign, under the scratched out old name, I can see some letters that sound like the word he’d called it by. But that place is gone.

I park the bus. I watch him get out, watch him wander around. I see a bit of hope in his face. A small spring in his step that gets a bit more tense with every few steps. I slowly watch the smile turn to confusion. I watch his eyes lose their light. He goes down to a house by the docks, and I see him stand in front of it for a while before his legs give out.

When I check the map, his map, and compare, I see that the mountains in the distance aren’t near so close to the place this used to be, in the world it used to be in. I wonder, if I looked at these maps long enough, would all the old roads override the ones I know now? Would I get lost, or find something important? I wonder where the Office is on here. But I think about it, long and hard, and I remember the important bit. That’s not where I’m drivin’ no more.

My bus is here. In this moment, in this place, and it's these people that I drove for. And this world is the one they know.

I pause. I reach down, pull out that little paper slip, and find it’s laminated. I look at it, and see it’s a photo. In the photo I see my passenger, and a very strange fish. It stands on two legs, and he looks like the whole world is ahead of him as he poses with it. Like he knows a secret just for him, something that makes him special.

Old gears turn in my head. But they belong to a machine that don’t matter none now.

When I start pulling out, I see my last passenger of the day talking to a strange fisherman. When I look at him, my vision narrows to a pinprick, and my world becomes his alone. And I watch him share a secret with the kid. Fishes something out of that water that gets tears running down his face, but in a way that makes me think he’s going to be okay.

I pick up my Trainee, and find I’ve been gone at least a whole day. I don’t remember when I’d slept. There’s a package on the gas station counter, one that’s a little wet around the edges, brown leather with drying stains and taut string tying it shut. It makes me nostalgic. When I ring up the Mailman, ask him if it’s one of those strange packages he talked about, he tells me that no, that’s for me.

But I don’t open it yet. I don’t know if I’m ready.

When I wake up the next morning, I tend the paper slips again. Nobody sends me any secrets that open my eyes or warm my heart, and I’m left a little disappointed. There’s something sopping wet and green standing outside my bus door, and when I let it in it spits up a bit of half-digested sandwich. I think it’s trying to tell me it wants something. Not everything that follows you home is bad. Sometimes, it’s just strays who need to find where they belong.

I had a nightmare. I haven’t had one in a while, not even during the worst driving bouts in my recent memory. Not even after the tunnels. But I had one. I dreamed that I was in a place that was very dark, with people in the distance I both knew and didn’t know. The dark place went on forever, and it was between all that ever had been and ever would be.

I never got closer to anyone. I walked. Or maybe I drove. Same thing, these days. At the far end of this secret, dark, lonely road, I saw a bus in blue and silver, with a cat leaping across the side, kept for me to return to. Everyone around me went to where they needed to be long before I did, and I walked in the great black alone for far longer than I ever had while eyes on the horizon had watched me.

I think I’m not going to be around too much longer. I think the one thing about me I wish had changed didn’t. I don’t know if it’s for the best or for the worst. But we all have to reach the end of the road eventually, and I think it’s more important I know people are where I need them to be when I leave them behind.

We’re driving to the mall today. I might need to have my Trainee record about it. No idea if I’ll remember so much as a lick beyond what I went in for and came out with. I’m sorry if this one was a bit lonely and rambly. My head is clearer than it should be, in a way I don’t quite like. But I’ll get back to you soon.

**New recording. Driver’s voice.**

I found where the other recorder went. Don’t tell her I found out, though. I goofed a few words, but I think I would’ve given it to her later on anyways. But if you know something, something you can tell me specifically, about these stars and the moon or whatever it is she’s on about, could you let me know? It sounds… Familiar. Something’s scratching at the back of my mind. I heard the click of a flashlight last night, here and there, thought I heard creaking timber, but I’ve never seen anything on the moon.

She’s my friend. I can’t quite remember right now if I’ve said it to her face, but I will when she comes back. I don’t know why, but I feel the need to leave a warning. Don’t watch the stars or the moon too closely at night. Not out here. Something… Something… I can’t remember, I’m sorry. I won’t look at her recordings anymore, though. Now that I know they’re private. But I have to watch for. For something.

Do you think I should call security? I’m going to hide this one, I think. I don’t know what to-

Oh, she’s coming back.

**New recording. Trainee’s voice.**

He grows bolder. I think he’s frustrated, or sad, or scared. When I watched him pull away, I thought he’d left me too. That he’d cast me out. But he came back. She didn’t. Do you think, maybe, I don’t need to go back? That the moon is not my home? There’s a lot of things in this world, a lot of things that change.

I don’t think I have a choice. Everything is excitement, everything is unease, all at the same time. Call my name, please. Help me remember. My name is \[static\]. My name is \[static\]. My name is-

**New recording. Staticky, crackling voice overlaid on jittery, frail voice.**

Things went well with the clowder. I have made many friends. The shadows enjoy my presence. The tunnels are quiet. I do not know why they are afraid of them. I feel something weak within, that does not have a heart. **Repetitive reciting of same phrases.** 

Something is listening to me. I’ll gather the cats and move them to the shelter soon. I will go back and forth until it is full. The Driver’s bus is strange now. I do not understand why there are two posters. **Repetitive reciting of same phrases.**

**New recording. Male, concerned voice. Gurgly and wet.**

Call security. It’s not supposed to be out this far. Board it up. It won’t come out. Not where everything’s all bright or all dark. Too much shit going on around here. All the heat with that missing-
