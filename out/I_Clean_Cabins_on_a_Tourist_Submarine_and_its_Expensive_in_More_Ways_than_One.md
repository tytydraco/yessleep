Trigger Warning: Gore.

Working on a tourist submarine has been... an experience. 

I'm in charge of cleaning fifteen floors of mostly empty cabins, and as it turns out, it's pretty dang expensive to book a casual trip on the ocean floor. Go figure. 

Something you might not expect, though, is the sounds. Whales, water pressure, the whine of the engine, and sometimes the unexplainable. 

To give a little context, as I'm sure you're confused--let's put it this way: Have you ever felt like you're being watched?

Down here, it's not only the cameras keeping an eye on our distinguished patrons. I heard it call my name, it knew things about me, and it watches them too.

In the lowest section, where the steam generators relentlessly churn away and the high pressure pipes hiss at you as you walk by, something dwells in the shadows; its eyes always calculate, always studying.

It all started months ago, right here on the Seabed Continental. I was doing my nightly rounds, having just finished cleaning the guest cabins, and making my way down to the crew deck. 

That's the first time I heard it.

I checked my watch, walking down the creaky stairs: 2:56 AM. For days, every time I checked, it always hovered around three in the morning.

The red light they use on the lower decks is great for night vision and more than a little eerie, especially the way it played with the steam and made the already dark corners look like something might just reach out and grab you as you walk by.

I turned the corner leading to the generator room, the smell of Terrance's burnt chili still stuck in the air, and that's when I heard its voice: a chorus of everyone I ever knew and infinitely more than I could recognize.

"Christopher," it said, matter-of-factly.

I stumbled back, smacking my head on a low hanging pipe. As much as it hurt, I was too scared to scream. As I rubbed the back of my head, my ears strained against the usual white noise.

Nothing. Not even Jerry, who's usually singing sea shanties around that time. Just silence. 

But I felt it--ahead, behind the steam generators, just out of sight. The shadows stretched there, searching, feeling. 

That was it for me.

I scrambled back towards my dorm, determined to call it a night. The captain would have my ass in the morning, but I didn't care.

"Three days," it said as I barged through the door.

I was going crazy, I thought. 

But, it was right.

The next night was when things started getting weird. It seemed like every time I turned the corner, I could see its eyes--like red marbles surrounded by glowing blue light, unmoving, and all seeing.

In the men's washroom, they stared at me from a crack in one of the stalls as I wiped the mirror. In the kitchen, from the vents as Kenneth said something about how his wife might be cheating. I told him that it's part of the job. 

After the long night, I retired to my dorm. As I laid down to catch some shut-eye--they bore into me, from the cracks... the shadows, everywhere they might have hidden, they were there. I buried my head under my pillow, trying to ignore it. 

It didn't care.

"Bring them to me," it said, directly into my mind this time, and for some reason, I knew exactly what it meant. It wanted the patrons, their ring fingers specifically.

Now, as much as I wanted to please the supernatural entity plaguing my every waking hour, I couldn't go around chopping off fingers... for obvious reasons. 

So, I knew I needed to talk to someone about all this, and the only person who might've believed me came to mind--Jerry.

On the second night, I found Jerry singing about mermaids and those unfortunate enough to stumble close enough to hear their wails. He was peeling potatoes, one finger missing, his brown and gray beard stained yellow at the sides. 

His eyes crinkled into a familiar, welcoming smile as I approached; a missing tooth winking from his grin.

"Hey there, swabbie, what can I do ya for?" He said in his usual upbeat tone.

I leaned against the counter and took a deep breath. The words blurted out of me.

"You ever feel like you're being watched?" 

My cheeks grew hot when he didn't speak straight away. Jerry placed the peeler on his lap and stroked his beard.

"Now, ain't that a question. What do ya reckon is watching you, lad?"

I tapped my fingers against the stainless steel. It wasn't like I had anything to lose, I thought.

"There's a... entity on the ship. It's watching me and everyone else here."  The words felt stupid leaving my lips, I couldn't look him in the eye.

Jerry hummed, his smile gone. He stared at the bucket of peeled potatoes for a long moment. He had never spoken so seriously before.

"It don't like to wait. It won't wait."

I was frozen, speechless. Jerry knew what it was, and he must have dealt with it in the past. I went to speak, but he started back up with the potatoes.

"Do what you gotta do, lad... and do it fast." 

I felt like there was nothing more to say. I backed away and made for the generator--there I would find my answers.

The steam generators seemed to cry out as I neared the door. I twisted the handle. It screeched as metal scraped against metal, then clicked. I pushed it open. The red light wasn't quite bright enough to see far into the back. 

I clenched my fists and took that first step. 

Nothing could have prepared me for what happened next.

Pipes spat out steam as I skulked towards the hulking generators, light shifted and bent the closer I got to the rear. Inky shadows swallowed the back of the room, a blob of wriggling mass that pulled me in like it had its own gravitational pull. Sweat burned my eyes and dripped down my nose, my calves knotted as my body tensed.

It shot out like vines, wrapping itself around the hanging lights, inside the turbines, and around my legs. When it touched me, I felt the whole ship, I could see everything it saw.

Married women with married men, expensive champagne, photos of vacationing children. It wanted things to be right, its version of right. My legs grew weak and I fell to the floor. 

"Why!?" I demanded.

"This is what you want. Your ex-wife found out first... hand."

"No... I didn't--"

Then the shadows erupted into a waterfall.

My wife's muffled cries filled my head. I remembered the feeling of her cheek under my foot and the weight of the garden shears in my hand.

I savored the sick crunch when the sharp steel cut through bone, and the warm sticky blood that covered my digits as I picked up hers from the floor.

I buried her ring finger in the back yard--under the tree we had planted after reciting our vows.

A searching tentacle swam towards my forehead, and at the same time its voice grew the size of the ocean. 

"Bring them to me... one finger for each year--an unbroken vow."

It slithered its way into my eyes, wrapping its claws around the soft meat inside.

It tore itself free, taking a part of me with it. Profound emptiness settled in my gut. A deep cold washed over my emotions--I became less.

When I opened my eyes, everything was clear.

I pushed myself up and made for the utility closet, clamping the large pair of bolt cutters. I gave it a few snips, admiring the way the rubber grip felt in my palms, then hoisted it over my shoulder.

"Some people don't know what's important anymore," I said, the words drawn out of me.

The creature's joy settled in my ribs, it's purpose seemingly fulfilled. 

I smiled, but it felt forced. 

Jerry stood at the entrance, ankles crossed, nursing a cigarette. He nodded at me.

"Ya don't have to embrace it fully, lad."

He took a long puff, then threw the butt onto the grated floor in an explosion of embers.

"This is what freedom costs." 

His eyes hardened. My stomach dropped as he pointed towards his ring finger.

"Pay the price or join the others."

I looked down at my left hand. Thinking about all those cabins I'd have to clean tomorrow.

"It'll be harder with nine fingers," I said.

"You get used to it, Lad."
