I knew I wasn't going to be out of there alive. But I had to keep working. Burton, Pierce and Dylan searched for the thing that was hidden and scuttling around, and I was there figuring out what has happened to my Comms Array. I needed to fix it, I needed to figure it out. Something wanted us there. Wanted us to stay. And this, I could not allow. This was impossible to fix though. The steel was bent out of shape. I'd have need the welder and my iron mongery tools. These were displaced on impact. Location could be somewhere in a 30 mile radius of the crash, or possibly in space. The infinite vacuum that I stare at, no matter how beautiful, terrified me. All I could think of, even now sometimes, is Briggs. Was he still floating out there? Was he closer to Pluto or Earth? Was he crystallised or is he just jelly still? I know, he should have been an ice block by now, but that isn't what happened.

Mors Non est Finis, our ship, was close. I had to try and find it. And if I couldn't find it, we'd be all dead by now. I went out, soon as I could. Out to see what it was. What was this thing out there? As I felt the texture of the Spandex like suit, from head to toe with the cut out for my face, i needed to piss. Zippers, unfortunately are not allowed on the under suit. I needed to take it all off to piss. And as I sat there, I felt tension build in my body like never before. I hadn't heard the crew shout, cry, or laugh with joy. My whole body tensed. Maybe I realised in that moment because I could hear it, or maybe I just got lucky. I turned around to look at the vent, this spider like creature of stone was covered in blood. And for a moment, I looked in it's eyes - solid stone eyes. Green, purples, blues, orange. I saw the cosmos in it's eyes as it scuttled away. Our uninvited guest was staying here with us, I knew that now. Burton crashed through, with me awkwardly hiding myself on the toilet. Like a Lady hiding her parts, I froze in place. "Cachowsky, do you know anything about advanced medicine?" I frowned, dropping my arms because of the question. "No. Why?" Burton stared at me with his sad puppy eyes and gestured me to come with him. I put the suit back on and ran towards him and the crew. And that's when I saw him. Briggs. He was there. And he was perfectly fine. I looked at him stunned, I could only remember his face as he left the vacuum of space. I didn't know what to do. Burton looked towards me. "Check his stats. There's something not right about this." Me, Pierce and Dylan picked up Briggs and walked with him as Burton tried to plan for something, something to do to help. He never got the chance.

Briggs was below cold. He should have been frozen. -10 degree Celsius. I didn't know a human could look alive in that condition, but he was. There was nothing wrong with him either. Biologically, mentally, physically. Only problem was the rocks and the cold. One was lodged in his throat. It was down there bad. Briggs was breathing, but not talkative or responsive. But when I touched his throat - just at his Adams apple, he grabbed my forearm and brought me next to his face. His blood shot eyes, like pin needles, were staring through me. "Don't. Don't touch it." He fell back to unconsciousness. His gruff voice sent a shiver down my spine, as Dylan, Pierce and me shot concerned glances at eachother. "We need to get Burton on this, right?" Dylan spoke up, his weak nature suddenly growing some much needed oomph. "Yes, we do Dylan." I remember what I said next to them in there, and I don't know why I said it. "Pierce, Dylan, you will always be in my heart. Remember that, okay?" They all scrunched their faces and walked off. I wish they'd listen.

Burton wasn't responding to his radio, so we tracked him. He was in the main hall. We looked, searched every nook and crannie, but he wasn't there. No where to be seen. He vanished. I heard the crunch before I could understand what it was. When I looked, I pissed myself again. I forgotten that detail until now. The thing I stepped on was a rock, and what came out was small and carnivorous. It ate through Burton before I had a chance to know what was going on. And then the rest of him started dripping down on me. I never thought to look up. As I did, I saw his mouth filled with stones, he was screaming when it happened. His body was in multiple pieces strung across the ceiling. I screamed at everyone to look up, but that's when I heard the cracking. I looked to them, dumbfounded and confused. I had one choice. I ran. They screamed after me. "Cachowsky, no! What are you doing?" I kept running when I heard their death screams. Like a child having a tantrum, I rubbed the tears off my face as I ran and ran. Nothing was going to stop me. Even hearing them being stuffed and ripped apart like a Christmas chicken. At least that was what I thought.

I was outside the med bay when I saw Briggs standing. He was wheezing, gurgling, and blood was coming from his mouth. His eyes, still that rage filled red, stared me down on the other side of the glass. He reached up one of his arms, and opened the grate. Even through the glass I could hear his bones snap and crack and move in unnatural ways. He was climbing into the vent. Oh fuck. And that's when I saw the creature staring me down, it's cosmic aura demanding a sacrifice. I started to run again, going the opposite way when I ran into Pierce. He hushed me and dragged us both into a storage facility. He put a finger on my mouth and nose as he said. "Don't talk, don't over breathe. They don't ventilate this area well." He held me close as the shadow passed the window of the door. It creaked and groaned and moaned as it sauntered by. Pierce just held me closer to him, his hand over my mouth. "Just, stay right here. Right here." I could hear the base warp under each of his footsteps. Briggs was always light footed, but now he walked with weight and heft, a new confidence brought by an alien infestation. When we heard the thing - I should say Briggs, walk away, Pierce let me go and spoke in a hushed tone. "Cachowsky, we have about -" He looked at his watch. "5 minutes before we run out of air and die. I need to know something." I was sobbing and nodding, ready for the scolding. "Cachowsky, will you stick with me?" I froze in space, no longer terrified. More distraught. "We're all scared, I think even the thing that came in here is. I don't want to die, and I don't think you do either. Please, stick by me." As his hand touched my shoulder, I recoiled. I couldn't trust him after I trusted him so little. I betrayed him. 

He understood my feelings, I think. When I reflect now, I wonder if he really did. And then we heard the creak again. I glanced at the window. I saw nothing. No shadow. Nothing. And when I looked back at Pierce, he was staring above me. Past me. Beyond me. He slowly opened the door, grabbed my hand and slammed the door behind me. Before I had even a second to comprehend, we were running. I don't remember much from this part. Sweat. Red lights. Cold. Warmth. Fear. Release. But when I was conscious of my own thoughts again, we were outside the base. I looked to Pierce, but he only stared at the base. The rest of Titan was ignored, only the reality of our base that stood like a mausoleum. And when I looked to see what he was staring at, I saw him. To this day, I don't think anything has made me more sick in my life. Burton, his floating head frozen still with thousands of tiny legs crawling to a halt as it stood on top of the base. His mouth was opened ajar, the blood that popped out before was frozen. His eye lids were stretched as we saw more legs crawling in an out. And finally, to signal us, Burton smiled. It wasn't a normal smile, it was horrendous. His loose skin sagged in his eyes, and his smile stretched from cheek to cheek. And then, he scuttled away like nothing had happened. It was a farewell from Burton from the grave, no matter how sick and twisted the form was now. I think Pierce and I knew what this thing was doing for a fact...

We were being taunted.
