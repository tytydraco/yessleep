Young men, attention! Don't enroll for that course from that influencer. Don't join the army. Don't take that plunge off the highest bridge just yet. Do not "crash out" as you all like to say. You don't have to kill yourself; I have hope for you. 

Capitalism, Communism, Feminism, the rise of Andrew Tate: the cause does not matter. The fate of young men today is misery, and it's plastered on every youth's face. And no one has a solution for it. No one cares. 

Except me.



Young man, I offer you the chance to work for me. I will treat you even better than my previous employer treated me, for not too long ago I was just like you. 

Poor.

Lonely.

Lost.

Now, I have my hands full of

Money.

Women.

Purpose.

I just had to accept a job from someone named Mogvaz Main.



I grew up in the foster care system after my parents abandoned me at ten. No warning. No last goodbyes. They just left. 



There were eight of us in the home, and that day at 14, I enjoyed some rare alone time in my room, which I shared with four other boys. There were only two beds in the room, small things that we were too old for, with Finding Nemo bed sheets none of us wanted. 



DJ barged into our room, ruining my rare alone time. I didn't bother looking up from the game on my PSP. I didn't care for the game; it was just a free demo I played again and again. I couldn't afford anything new.



The indentations on my fingers grew past painful over the hours I played and went into numbness. A numbness that I didn't mind because I was numb as well. I played the same game for the same reason I woke up in the morning. What else was there to do? I clicked and shuffled my fingers across the analog stick and listened to the game's music, which rotated between cheap imitations of Lil Wayne or cheap imitations of Linkin Park.

The game was boring, impossible to advance in, and hurt to the point of banality; that was my life.

Until DJ put a gun to my head.



"Sup, Darren," he said with a grin of poorly brushed teeth, only his dead mother could love.

I froze but it was odd; before that, I paused the game, even in my panicked state. The game was dumb, but it was normality; some part of me wanted to return to it.

"DJ, dude, get that out of my face," I said. He did. Flashing grins the whole time and then going into several gun-shooting poses.

"DJ, where did you get a gun?"

"Frank." He spit out the words; he always talked fast when he was excited. "He doesn't know it though. It'll be back tonight though after we use it."

I put my PSP down on the bed and stood up to get out of the gun's range.

"For what?" I asked.

"We're about to rob one of those rich Wall Street pricks."

DJ hated everyone on Wall Street, well, and everyone on every other street, I suppose. DJ's dad blamed Wall Street for all his woes and also beat DJ before he was taken from his dad and placed into foster care, where beatings continued by our foster dad: Frank. Violence begat violence fear begat fear and hatred begat hatred.

"If he's from Wall Street, what's he doing here?" I asked. 

"I don't know, but look at this flyer." He showed me a flyer made of thick, expensive-looking paper and shook it in front of me, then read me its content. " 'Looking for Young Entrepreneurial men willing to work hard to achieve goals'; that's a whole bunch of nothing. He's about to scam everyone there."

I held the flyer in my hand. That was my future in my hand, in one way or another. I would either rob the man with DJ or be one of these young men. It was exciting. It was like the indentations in my thumbs popped away. My hand cramps left.

Finally, there would be change.

I looked to DJ standing above me. He was furious and muttered something about Wall Street scum. 

I sighed and hugged him. Only here would my brother accept my love for him. Only here was he free to cry and admit he didn't know where Wall Street was, or wasn't even truly upset at them but he hated how weak his father, Frank, and the rest of the world made him feel.

My brother put his cheek on my shoulder, wetting my sleeve, and with only slight disappointment did I know my decision that night would be to rob the host of the party. Where DJ would go, I would go.

The procedure to get there was strange and lengthy. We each called in and answered about twenty or so questions about goals and experience.

"Bull, I'm telling you...," DJ said after the call. "If you had real experience, you wouldn't be applying for something this sketchy. They want to make you think you're special but you're not. You're another hustle." 

Perhaps he was right. Both DJ and I were called back. We were told to meet outside of the local high school at 6 pm that fall night. That scared me. I was always afraid of the dark as a child. When my parents abandoned me in my house, the light bill hadn't been paid for days, so I sat in the dark just waiting for them to come back. Every noise at night made me shiver. Every gust of wind that beat against the window made me leap. Even all those years later, just a simple walk in the dark would give me goosebumps. I didn't want to go anymore. I hoped our foster dad would deny us permission to go, but he didn't care once he heard there was potential we could be getting paid.

Once there, the atmosphere was of subdued mockery. There were perhaps about sixteen boys from all years of high school to a few who just graduated. Like DJ, about a quarter of the boys felt that the whole thing was a joke and mocked those who put on their best suits.

DJ did wear a black suit though, as did I. Certainly, not good enough; both were ill-fitting, ill-stitched, and the coloration on the jacket and pants was off. However, we hoped wearing suits would help us blend in for the robbery.

A long, black, limo with tinted windows pulled in front of us. We waited for words from the driver or some sort of acknowledgment. It did not come. DJ, set on his mission, went into the limo first, and we followed.

Luxury never rolled into my town. We didn't know about seats you could melt into. Seats that were heated and cars with enough space to stretch your legs without having to feel the sticky hairy legs of your companion. The limo had all of that.

Once all were in, the door closed, and the driver we couldn't see pulled away. We were anxious, excited, and rambunctious but somehow all 16 of us fell asleep in only a couple of minutes by magic or science.

My eyes fluttered awake from sleep so good the Sandman had already left his crumbs around me. I awoke to a quarter-moon night.

The limo's headlights flashed on a fluttering gate-sized red curtain as if we were about to enter a Broadway play too exquisite, too pristine for the rest of us. I rubbed my waking eyes and every boy sat in reversed silence.

Men in suits much greater than ours stood in the center of the curtain. They were mountainous and built like bodybuilders. With all the strength required of their bulk, they pulled apart the curtains and the car rolled in. Behind the curtain were suburban houses more valuable than any in our town.

Without a word, the limo came to a stop.

"Excuse me, Sir. Do we get out here?" A skittish boy named Reggie asked. His resume flapped in his shaky hand and his voice cracked.

No one answered.

"I think we should," said one of the older boys, Jerry, who graduated high school already. I knew he was going deaf because of his job at the factory. Jerry only came in a collared shirt and khakis, and I could tell he was regretting it. He had the disposition of a man who had fumbled an opportunity; sighs of disappointment, downtrodden shoulders, and constant curses under his breath.

He led us out, putting on a brave face because every boy in there was frightened.

The neighborhood was lit like a bizarre and beautiful Halloween night. Outside of each home stood a man in a suit or a beautiful woman in black. They stood, still at attention, and held candles in front of their faces.

It was repeated down and down the numerous rows and houses. Orange light was the only light, for each house was pitch black.

As a group, we went to the house closest to us. It was manned by another strong man. He was perhaps just under seven feet, had dark hair to his shoulders, and dark caramel skin.

"Hello, Sir," said our leader, the oldest and worst dressed of us. "We're here for the meeting." 

"I know," the tall man said with disdain and a judging gaze. "Each of you take a bag." He said and stepped aside to reveal a pile of brown-leather handbags with markings of LV, LV, and LV on them.

"I ain't grabbing a purse," said Tim, a rough kid, short, red-haired, and anxious to prove himself. However, he hadn't quite hopped on to current trends and didn't see what we saw in rock and rap music videos. The superstars all had these bags and they were worth $11,000 each. 

"Then go sit in the car," the man barked back.

This stunned Tim and he stuttered a dumb reply. "N--n-no, I was just joking."

Tim stood at the back of the crowd and the big man waved through it. We scattered out of fear. He didn't lay a hand on us and we parted. The man grabbed Tim by his throat. The smack of a hand on a throat pushed timidity out of the night and fear entered. Tim's gasp for air sounded like a dying coyote's final howls. This man raised Tim -crying, flailing, and wetting himself- with only that quarter moon in the background. I got the impression that we were well and truly alone.

The laws of the U. S. did not apply here.

The police and their sirens would not whir to his aid.

His daddy's sawed-off shotgun couldn't shoot far enough to harm this man. We were somewhere too distant.

And none of us boys would dare help him.

The man roared. Well and truly a savage tribute to what a man can be. It shook me to my core.

"Do I look like I make demands twice?!" the man said.

And with that, he dropped him. The ground thudded with the new arrival and it shocked me back to consciousness. I noted my position on the ground, all of our positions on the ground; it was like we were bowing to this man. This put a deeper fear in me and jealousy.

To be bowed down to...

To have no one look down on you... 

Tim rose with a neck with a slight bend and ran to the car.

"The bags..." the giant said and we followed his orders, rushing to grab one.

"You are to receive a gift at each house and at each house, there's the possibility you may go home."

We huddled together and moved like sheep. 

"Split up!" he demanded. "Two-by-two." 

We burst from the scene; DJ and I found one another and headed to the house furthest from him. 

"Little prick," DJ whispered to me out of breath. "He'll kill us all if he gets the chance." 

"I don't know about that, DJ. I really think we ought to see how this goes before we make any wrong moves." 

"When you've got the gun, you can't make a wrong move," DJ said through gritted teeth. 

Our arrival at a new house paused the conversation. This was manned by a woman who held that same orange candle with one hand and beckoned us with the other.

We obeyed and I begged myself to look bold, older, and more confident. We left the street for the sidewalk and I saw more of her beauty. My heart raced, my palms sweated, and I realized I'd do anything to be around this woman. She was that beautiful.

"Hey," she said, her black lipstick matched her hair. "How are you all tonight?" 

"We're good," DJ said. I couldn't find my voice yet. 

"Really?" she said as if surprised. "Everyone's treated you well?" She squatted to our height and poked her lip out to speak to us in a nurturing manner, so much more electrifying than a mother ever could.

This could be a conversation topic. Couldn't she see what just happened? She heard the screams. She heard the howls. I'll help report him and--

"No, ma'am," DJ said. I was pissed and I was ready to argue until I saw the change in her face from the care-taker to gleeful grave-digger. 

"Good boys," she said and then pointed at me. "This one almost spilled though." She laughed. I blushed and swayed, confused and self-conscious. She laughed hard and the candle's flame shook with her body. "Make sure you stay with him if you want to make it to the end. Now, how about some iPhones? Careful with these; they won't hit the market for a year." 

We took her advice and she dropped the latest iPhones in our bags ( a thing so rare in our town I had never seen them in person). Trick or treat, I guess. 

"Goodbye," I said. My first and last words to the woman that night. We would meet again another day. 

She mouthed the words goodbye and my heart fluttered in confusion and young lust at first sight.

"You see that?" DJ said. "They want us to lie; that means something fishy is going on here. We need to rob this guy, steal a car, and get out of here GTA style. I got the ski mask."

"Yes, but we could make it to the end."

"How?" he said. "When have we been picked for anything? You couldn't even graduate 7th grade on the first try; why would we get picked for this?" 

"Maybe, it wasn't all smart stuff. Maybe some of it was normal guy stuff," I said; my voice trailed off as I saw a woman just as beautiful at the next table. My young mind already imagining my future with this one if I could just find the right words. 

"They don't have normal guy stuff here," DJ said. Then our attention turned to our left. The older boy in the collared shirt, Jerry, was making a ruckus.

He begged at one of the tables of the beautiful women.

"Please," he said. "I understand I am not wearing a suit. I might not be exactly up to code... but please let me stay."

"The instructions were business attire, not business casual," the model said. 

"I have better clothes."

"We want the best. Now, can I please get your bag and all of its supplies?" the model asked in a childish voice that would be seductive to some men if not for the occasion.

"I-i-i don't have a job. You don't understand; I could really use this money."

The model was stunned, his objection an impossible rebellion to her. 

"Can I come back?" he asked.

"I said, 'give it back'. Why isn't it in my hand?"

The oldest boy dropped to his knees and put his hands together for prayer. 

Disturbed by his lack of acquiescence, a large suited man charged him. 

"Jerry!" I cried out! 

"Jerry!" 

"Jerry!" 

So many of us warned, but like I said earlier, he was going deaf. The suite

So many of us warned, but like I said earlier, he was going deaf. The suited man stomped, boomed, and tore through the night. He struck Jerry like lightning meets the ground, and Jerry's body folded over.

His skull split open. I didn't know such a small thing could be so loud. The sound reverberated in my chest and my heart dropped. I wanted my world to go still but it erupted instead.

Boys who watched Al-Qaeda beheadings for fun now screamed for God like they were the religious ones.

Blood pooled out from his skull.

Candle-lit women sucked their teeth and rolled their eyes.

Witnesses vomited.

The murderer rose. No blood touched his clothes.

"You told him to leave," he said defensively.

"You killed him!" one boy cried.

"Yeah?" the murderer roared. "And I'll do worse to you if you don't go to the car."

DJ pulled me by my collar and dragged me behind a bush. I let him take the lead; my consciousness was drowning in that pool of blood. He pulled off my jacket, put a ski mask over himself and me, then placed a gun in my hand.

"Follow me," he said and we raced through the neighborhood while dead Jerry held the neighborhood's attention. We found where DJ assumed riches must lie.

It was a cul-de-sac and the end of it was another red curtain.

"You ready?" DJ asked.

"Yeah..."

"Man, get ready. You don't have to feel bad for these guys. They're scum. They killed, Jerry, and I've got an odd feeling they'll kill us tonight if we let 'em."

"Okay..." I realized that night I did not want to die at all.

We entered through the final red curtain.

It was a drainage pool of black sewer water. A massive intimidating thing as large as a basketball court. Outlining this pool was freshly manicured grass, and as still as statues stood, again, the beautiful, the perfect, lit only by orange candlelight.

The pool water stirred. Something in it swam in a circle. My heart raced, I was not a thief; I couldn't do this but I acted out of fear-wretched self-preservation. I waved my gun and begged:

"Wallets, jewelry, now!" I said.

They ignored me. Something in the pool swam toward us. I swear my hand was uneasy on the trigger. "Now!" I demanded.

Eyes rose from the pool, yellow eyes, the eyes of a crocodile.

A tail rose next with a mighty splash. It was long as an anaconda but bent like a cobra. It slammed on the grass and from it came words, for the tail had 5 mouths with hairy tongues.

It should have been funny. I should have been laughing, not crying, but I wanted to go home because I was so afraid. I pissed myself then and there. Warm liquid dribbled down my leg. It reeked and I couldn't stop it.

"A robbery?” The thing in the pool said. Each word came out from one mouth at a time like a note from a demonic clarinet.  “Now, that's innovation," the witnesses around us laughed at the joke. "I'm Mograz Main. I run this organization. I like your style you’re hired. What's your name?"

"I'm not giving names; I'm robbing you!"

"Kid," Mogvaz said. "I like you. You won, put the gun down, you and your buddy will work for me."

"No! I don't want a job. I want your money."

"Kid, I'll show you more money than you'll ever believe. The money, the cars, the clothes; it's here if you put the gun down and listen."

I didn't speak. I didn't want to speak. My mouth was so dry and I was becoming aware of my shame. And I was remembering. I remembered how I was so alone and so scared as a child in that cold dark house. I was more confused at that moment than then. It was horrible. I was small, cold, and defenseless.

"No, more talking," DJ bellowed. "Start tossing your wallets and jewelry or I shoot!"

"Kid!" Mogvaz said. "You shoot me, I kill you and your friend."

"You can't fool me. You're killing me anyway."

"Awww, you're a nut case; you're going to get you and your friend killed."

"Money now!"

"Go to hell!"

Then DJ made the worst decision of his life. He shot three times into the skull of the yellow-eyed creature.

Splash

Splash

Splash

The water settled. Mogvaz only blinked.

Flick.

Flick.

Flick.

The first time the lights went off and I was all alone, I stood by the light for half an hour trying to get it to work. It was so futile, like fighting against Mogvaz.

As I said before, violence begat violence, fear begat fear. Just as DJ struck out against everything because his dad beat him, I would abandon my friend because I was afraid of being alone and defenseless.

I shot my best friend, my brother, in the back of his head. He plopped down first, landing on his knees and then his face met the grass.

I didn't say anything. My gun was hot and smoke leaked from it. I tossed it aside, disgusted with my choice but I didn't leave; I wanted my prize.

"Finally, someone who's smart," the mouths said. "What do you want?"

"All of it. Everything you were offering him."

"And you'll do anything for it, won't you?"

"Yes."

"Get on your knees and roll his body forward into the river and stay on your knees."

I rolled his body forward. His bloody head left a trail in the grass. I tried to separate myself from what I did. I tried to let my thoughts leave my body. I focused on the task and not that I was throwing the hands that I shook, the arms that hugged me, the body of my brother into the water.

It did not work. I moved to the sewer water's edge and rolled the body in the water. 

The body plopped in the water and floated toward Mogvaz.

Using whatever mouth that lay beneath those eyes, Mogvaz tore through the body of my brother and made the black water red. He was efficient. More controlled than a beast; there were no brilliant splashes or writhing. I didn't even get splashed with sewer water.

And yet I was still filthy.

After fifteen minutes of eating, the body disappeared and only clothes were left.

"What's your name?" Mogvaz asked.

"Darren."

"You will do whatever I want? No matter what I ask? Because this is the job. You will feed us the bodies of men and women. You will betray many more, Darren."

"You'll give me whatever I want, Mogvaz?"

"Yes."

"Then I agree, but first I need to know... There's always a cost. Will you want to eat me by the end of this?"

"Yes."

"How long? How long will I have?"

"Ten years. A decade."

"I'll have a decade to do whatever I want."

"Yes."

"Then I accept."

And for ten years, I got everything I wanted.

I had so much fun I had to tell someone. So, I hired a therapist. That therapist quit so I hired another. That one quit so I went to a priest. Then the priest quit and wanted to work for me. He wanted some of the diamonds, the blondes, the Bugattis, the power, the freedom, the Latinas, the boats, the affairs, the islands, the wars, and wins.

However, I kept the world at arm's length. It's hard to form bonds as a human trafficker. I saw my fellow men as cattle. Everyone I got close to I ended up betraying to feed Mograz and his friends.

And they would take their time on a human. They had perfected limb-by-limb surgery. Men and women would die for days, first stripped of feet or merely toes for the younger members who were learning to eat their fellow men. They were all humans though, other than Mogvaz.

Anyway, they had perfected the process of preventing a body from ever bleeding out. A human would be severed and alive until only the torso, neck, and head were left. The first couple of years, part of my job was to make sure they remained conscious and lucid and that they did not go insane but stayed in reality. Some cried for death, some cried for mercy with each chopped limb. In a way, it was granted.

On the last day of my service, I delivered a human baby to Mogvaz Main. It was something he had never had before. The other members felt that it was too cruel and argued the taste would be poor in quality, so he asked me to do this.

It was my child. The mother, Lena, was one of the models with the candles I met on that first night. Over the years, we had grown close, both of us coming to the end of our contracts and wanting something more, something that money couldn't buy; each other. Mogvaz saw this and requested we go on another grand adventure...pregnancy. It was business. What's one more human life to give to Mogvaz?

Something changed once our baby popped out, quiet and beautiful with his mother's nose and father's eyes. When Lena held him, she had never been so euphoric. Name your drug, name your vice, we've done it and this for her was better than all of that, just sitting in her robe and holding her baby to her chest.

For a moment, I felt it too - but I knew to push that down. I knew eventually both that baby and Lena would abandon me and I would be alone again, so what was the point of stalling?

The next day, I tried to take the baby from her.

What followed was a blur of screams and tears. We fought, she was animalistic, driven by desperation. She forgot what we were. She forgot we were all just meat puppets and none of it mattered!

In our struggle, the god of irony mocked us. Our son, less than a week old, slipped from our grasp.

The thud-like sound he made when he hit the ground did make me sick. It echoed in my ears so much louder than Lena's anguished wails.

I stood there, frozen, a smile cracking across my icy grimace. Our son lay still, silent. In trying to save him, we'd become his executioners.

With my dead child cradled in my arms, I entered Mogvaz's office. Each step tormented me and I was ready for this to be over. I was ready to die. But as I crossed the threshold, I was met with an emptiness that broke me. Mogvaz was gone.

I stood there, in disbelief, my eyes darted around the room for any sign of his presence. But there was nothing. No trace of my master for over a decade. Mogvaz Main had gone home, wherever that may be.

"Mogvaz?" I called out, my voice echoed in the empty space. "MOGVAZ!" I screamed, desperation clawing at my throat.

But I knew, with a sickening certainty, that I would never find him again. Mogvaz Main had abandoned me.

I screamed. This wasn't fair. I needed to be eaten. I needed to be eaten by him. I needed someone cruel, and ruthless, who saw me as the worthless cattle I was. None of those other frauds could eat me as I desired, as I needed.

It all came back to me, all the guilt I pushed down. I pushed down the vomit and let out the tears and in the freedom, the vomit came and my legs collapsed to the floor. The lies, the loneliness, the knives, the blood, the drownings, the broken homes, the fires, the slaves, it all came back to me.

DJ, my brother. I still hadn't met anyone like him. You can't replace a brother.

My son. I sacrificed my son for what?

For nothing. I needed penance and it dawned on me there was a way.

'I could eat myself,' I whispered, the words tasting of madness and despair. 'Why not?'

I recalled the meticulous process Mogvaz and his kind had perfected - the surgical precision with which they kept their victims alive and conscious as they devoured them piece by piece. I had watched it countless times, had even assisted in the gruesome act. Now, it seemed fitting that I should experience it firsthand.

I could eat myself. Why not? They had perfected the process of chopping a body and keeping it alive. If I wanted a monster to eat my flesh, why could I not do it?

After the first surgery, I felt a perverse sense of justice and purpose. This was my punishment, my atonement. And unlike my victims, I had chosen this fate. I was better than them. I wasn't a victim alone in the dark scrambling for the lights to turn on. I was in control.

I pen my tale with one hand, a torso, and a head. I'll stop here.

Young man, I ask you if you want to travel the world and experience everything good in life. If you don't want to be a victim and take control over your life, come apply for a position with me. I promise you I won't abandon you as Mogvaz Main abandoned [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/comments/1f3gxsu/what_happened_to_mogvaz_main/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
