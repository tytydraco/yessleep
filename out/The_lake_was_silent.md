It started like any other weekend getaway—one of those impromptu plans that sound better in a group chat than they feel when you're six hours deep into the woods with no cell signal and one bar of hope left in your GPS. There were five of us: me, Ishaan, Varun, Rhea, and Anika. We weren’t exactly tight-knit anymore—college and jobs had pulled us in different directions—but nostalgia has a way of tricking you into thinking you still belong.

We found the lake just before sunset. No signs, no maps—just a clear, still stretch of water hidden behind the trees like it was trying not to be found. Rhea called it glasswater. It didn’t even ripple when we threw a stone in. It just sank.
No birds. No frogs. No sound.
But it was beautiful. Unreal. The kind of place you’d swear you saw in a dream once and forgot until now.

We pitched tents, gathered some wood, and started a fire. Ishaan brought his Bluetooth speaker, which crackled more than it played, but it was enough to distract us from how quiet the forest was. It wasn’t creepy yet. Just peaceful. A silence that felt earned after months of deadlines and deadlines and more deadlines.

Later that night, after the others had passed out in sleeping bags, I couldn’t sleep. Something about the lake... it kept pulling at my thoughts. I walked down to the water’s edge with a flashlight. Just to look. Just to feel that stillness again.

That’s when I saw it.

At first I thought it was driftwood. A dark shape near the center of the lake, barely visible under the surface. But as I focused, I realized it had edges. Sharp, clean ones. Corners. Lines. It was a door. A wooden one, set flat beneath the water, with a metal handle worn green from time.

It didn’t make sense. It looked like it was just... floating there. Or resting on something I couldn’t see.
And worse—it looked openable.

The air shifted. A breeze that didn’t touch the trees brushed my face, carrying the faint smell of old wood and rain. Not the forest. Not the lake.

Basement air.

I should have left right then. Woken the others. Burned the tents. Something. Anything.

Instead, I whispered to myself, like a reflex:
“Why is there a door?”
And the lake whispered back.  


I don’t remember walking into the water.

One second, I was at the edge—flashlight in one hand, sanity in the other—and the next, I was waist-deep. The water was cold, but not freezing. It didn’t sting. It was... dense. Like moving through syrup or something half-dreamed. Each step took effort, but not resistance. Like the lake wanted me closer.

I didn’t hear the others call out. Didn’t hear the forest. Just my breathing and the soft sound of water folding over itself.

When I reached the door, I stood above it. It was clearer now—made of dark wood with long vertical grains, the kind used in temples or crypts. There were carvings along the top edge—symbols I didn’t recognize, like a language that never got spoken aloud. The handle was a black iron ring, still just visible below the surface.

And then I did the dumbest thing I’ve ever done.
I reached down and pulled.

No resistance. No effort. Just a slow, smooth creak as the door swung open into darkness. Not water—darkness. Like the lake stopped existing past that frame. The door didn’t lead down. It led in. Like the lake was just a skin stretched over a mouth.

I remember blinking—and then suddenly I was lying on the shore, soaked to the bone, my flashlight dead beside me. The sky was gray. The fire was out. The air felt heavier.
And I was alone.

I called their names until my throat hurt. Walked the perimeter, checked the tents, retraced our trail, screamed into the trees. Nothing. No footprints. No bags. No bodies.
No door.
Only the lake. Still as ever.

And when I looked into it again, it wasn’t still. Not really. I saw... things. For a split second, I swear I saw us—me and the others—sitting around the fire, laughing. Frozen in time, like a reflection caught between moments. Then they were gone.

I left the woods. I don’t know how long it took. Days maybe. A ranger found me on the side of the highway, shivering and mumbling. They ran some tests. Told me I was dehydrated, probably hallucinating. No record of the lake. No signs of my friends. The trail we took? Doesn’t exist on any official maps.
But I know what I saw.

It’s been weeks now. I haven’t slept through the night since. I keep hearing sounds around 3AM—wet footsteps, door hinges, distant voices. Sometimes, when I pass by puddles or still water, I see things that don’t belong.

Not reflections.
Memories that aren’t mine.
And sometimes... I see the door.

Not in water. On walls. In dreams. In shadows cast the wrong way. Always closed. Always waiting.

I think I left something behind that night.
Or maybe... I brought something back.
