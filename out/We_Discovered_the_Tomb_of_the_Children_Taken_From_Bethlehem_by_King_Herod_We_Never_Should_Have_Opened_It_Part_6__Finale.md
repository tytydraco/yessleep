>!Content Warning: Mentions of Self Harm.!<



Instinctively, I dropped to the ground, dragging Mia down with me. Stones fell around us and a stale smelling dust filled the chamber. When the brief barrage ended, we stood back up, covering our mouth and nose with the collar of our shirts as the dust settled. Suffian and the security team were unharmed.

My immediate fear was that the entrance had just collapsed in on itself and we were now all trapped within this dreadful place.

I coughed and hawked out a dirty gobbet of phlegm. It landed next to one of the children’s sarcophagi.

 My heart suddenly jolted to my throat.

The lid of that sarcophagus was absent. Inside, was the tiny skeleton of a baby. My eyes flicked to the adjacent one, and it too was suddenly lidless. True terror seized my chest and my breathing became rapid. I shone the torch towards the entrance. All the illuminated sarcophagi were opened, the remains of their lids scattered about the floor in tiny fragments.

Then, Mia began to tug on my sleeve. With great effort I turned to her, but she was not looking at what I had been. Rather, her eyes were once again fixed upon the wall. “It’s moving, Corey.”

I looked at the wall, and sure enough, the face of the infant that had been a part of it had become animated. It was crying, water droplets running down the wall from their source at the eyes.

The face on the wall suddenly cried out, “*HE RESTS!”*

It spoke with the eerie voice of a baby granted the ability to speak fluently. Somehow, I heard it in English. Later, Mia would claim she heard it speak in her native Assyrian language.

More similar sounding voices began to cry out in answer, until the entire tomb was filled with them. *“HE RESTS! HE RESTS!”* they screamed in unison.

The entire length of wall, ceiling and floor had come alive with the crying animations of the faces that had been imprinted upon them.

“*He is freed! Life taken from him! It was meant to be eternal! Eternal suffering for what he did to us! Robbed! We have been robbed of justice! THAT WHICH LIVES STOLE HE WHO SHOULD HAVE  BEEN OURS FOREVER! LIFE TOOK HIM FROM US, NOW WE TAKE LIFE FROM THEM!”*

The screaming voices gradually became more and more incoherent, until a bone chilling wailing replaced it.

Suffian and the others did little more than tremble where they stood.

In what I wished had just been an optical illusion, the wailing faces began to come forth out of the rock. The earthy colours upon their features became more and more pallid. I watched, feet plastered to the floor, as the faces transitioned into cloud-like apparitions that hovered in the air.

Up to that moment, they had not noticed the nine living individuals standing around Herod’s corpse, for they had seemed too lost in their own emotions. But now, all at once, they turned their crying faces and pinned us with their ghostly eyes. More of these crying clouds began to enter the illuminated area from the front of the tomb, until I knew without counting that all 76 of them were present.

 Their faces began to merge together, until one giant eldritch cloud formed. Its edges were comprised of screaming mouths, while its body was a sea of accusing eyes scattered about in no particular order.

It slowly floated towards us.

Then, like a sudden gust of wind had struck, it dissipated, and we were blasted by a cold fog. The wailing screams filled the air about us, until it became more concentrated near one of the security staff. The man raised an arm and I saw several small smoky tendrils latching to his pores. The fog was seemingly being drained into him. He swatted and tried to brush it away, but his hand merely went straight through, coming out with tendrils now entering the pores on his wrist. Eventually, the entire fog vanished into the terrified man, and the screaming that filled the chamber died with the last tendril drying up.

“They’re inside me!” he screamed as he began clawing at his own face. He rushed to the wall and began smashing his head against it. By the fourth strike he was dead.

Out of the gaping wound in his forehead, the eldritch fog began to pour back out and the wailing screams returned. Tendrils began to latch onto another unfortunate. Like the first victim, he too tried to swat it away with no avail.

Sense happened to strike Mia before anyone else. She jerked on my arm and before long, we were both fleeing back to the entrance.  The rest of the surviving crew followed close behind as the current victim began shrieking in his own torment. Suffian, no longer caring for the great prize of his nation that had all but allured him to this horror, overtook us.

But he did not get far.

Constantly looking back as he fled, he did not see that his path of escape had been blocked. The abomination that Hamza had pushed over, was no longer a dead weight on the floor. It was standing back up where it had been. Mia and I skidded to a halt, as Suffian ran straight into it.

Instead of falling over, the abomination grabbed Suffian with the two arms that protruded from its neck. There was a tangle of limbs as Suffian struggled with it. Eventually, the abomination had him trapped in a vice like embrace, using its two upper arms to hold him up horizontally against its chest. Suffian screamed and writhed within its grasp but the elbows that pinned him were like uncompromising iron bars. The hands on its two crude half arms began to open and close. The neck arms tightened, drawing Suffian closer to those snapping hands, until his face and groin were within range. One hand squeezed at the place where Suffian’s testicles were, the other began tearing at his face.

At the same time, the screaming of the current victim of the cloud died off, and the chorus of ghostly wailing returned, rapidly approaching from the rear.

Unwilling to accept his trapped status, one of the crew took a chance and vaulted over a sarcophagus that lay between two of the standing abominations. Neither of them moved. But instead of continuing his flight unmolested, something at his feet made him scream. Within seconds he had fallen over and was lost to view, his screams quickly matching the agonized frequency of Suffian’s.

Two of the crew began to shoot at the three motionless abominations, but they would not fall. The cloud latched its tendrils onto one of them. In his panic he began shooting blindly at the cloud, paying no heed to any of us in the way. A stray bullet struck the other shooter in the arm. Another, blew my left foot to pieces.

I collapsed to the floor as the gun fired four more times until it was out of bullets. Even as the pain seared up my leg, my immediate attention was on Mia. I was certain that she too had been shot, but, to my relief, she crouched beside me, completely unharmed. Her hands fell straight to the ruin of my foot, her face a mask of despair.

From the corner of my eye, the other man who had been shot was writhing against the wall, subdued by his wound. One of the abominations shuffled forward and grabbed him by the neck with its upper arms. In a matter of seconds, it tore his head off.

In that moment, I was too fixated on the tiny window of opportunity that had just presented itself.

Mia had just torn a strip off her shirt and was trying to stifle my bleeding when I slapped at her hand, startling her. I grabbed her by the ear and yanked her towards me. “Get the fuck out of here!” I demanded. I gestured to the small gap that had just been made by the head-ripping abomination. “Go, Mia, leave me, now’s your only chance!” I gave her a sharp shove to emphasise my point.

She stared at me, her face aghast. “I’m not leaving you, Corey!”

My heart sank as I watched the abomination slowly make its way back to its original position, again blocking that path of escape.

I began to cry. Not for myself, but for this beautiful girl whom I had only recently met, yet knew to be my soulmate. Death was moments away for both of us and the thought of her perfect face being torn apart by the horrors of that accursed tomb made my heart shatter.

She held my hand and kissed me on the mouth. She looked me fiercely in the eye. “Corey, we endure this together. I love you.”

In those last moments, I refused to look away from her lovely gaze. In my peripheral I could see the cloud latching onto its next victim, whilst Suffian’s mangled remains were tossed aside by his killer.

Suddenly, a muscled arm wrapped itself around Mia’s chest and yanked her to her feet. Hamza, his sweaty face, pale and wreathed in desperation, dragged her against her will towards the path blocking abominations. I knew exactly what he was doing.

“Hamza you bastard! Let go of her!” I roared.

He halted within 6 feet of an abomination, holding Mia out in front. Then, he pushed her.

“NOOOOOOO!” I screamed, as I watched the abomination grab and lift up my soulmate. She was quickly brought to the same position that Suffian had been in. Wasting no time, Hamza darted past the distracted abomination.

Words cannot describe my helpless agony as I watched the abomination begin to tear at her crotch and pretty face with it’s horrible snapping hands. Yet, unlike Suffian, she did not struggle. Even as it began pinching her nose and cheeks, she managed to turn her eyes to me. They were filled with tears. Her mouth moved in a short, “I love you,” before she closed her eyes, resigned to her fate.

Despite everything, a floodgate suddenly released in my chest, allowing the river of my veins to run rapid with a primal rage.

 I managed to bring myself to my knees, picked up a piece of stone and threw it at the abomination. “DROP HER!!” I roared like a rabid bear.

The tearing hands paused. The abomination did no more than continue holding Mia up with its two neck protruding arms.  A lightness enveloped my chest as tiny rays of hope began to shine through my despair.

“I SAID DROP HER YOU PIECE OF SHIT!” I pegged another stone to stress my point, its sharp edge burying itself in one of the abominations legs.

It seemed to flinch, but I doubted that it was in response to the its new wound.

Abruptly, it released Mia. She landed with a hard thud on the floor. The abomination remained standing above her, but was as motionless as our first encounter with it.

 I crawled as fast as I could to her, dragging behind the excess baggage of my ruined foot. 

As I approached, I could make out the silhouette of a man moving about frantically a few paces behind the abomination. Hamza had not gone far in his opportunistic flight. He was seemingly struggling with what looked like a deformed soccer ball that had somehow attached itself to his leg. Even as I noticed this, another ball seemingly rolled towards him and latched itself to his foot. He fell down and within moments, scores of balls rolled and attached themselves to him, until his writhing form was all but smothered by them. 

Eyeing the abomination standing over Mia, I grabbed her and pulled her a few paces away from it. I brushed the tangle of hair off her face, ready to see a disfigured mess below. To my upmost relief, other than a few bleeding gouges, a purple nose, and a very fat lip, her face was relatively whole. The jeans she was wearing had been an efficient shield for her crotch. She opened her eyes and a river of tears flowed out. I kissed her on the forehead.

I wrapped my arms around her and held her head against my chest. “I won’t let go of you,” I whispered in her ear. “No matter what.” I closed my eyes, buried my face in her hair and waited for what horror would come next.

The screams of the last members of Suffian’s team gradually died down, Hamza’s muffled shrieks being the last. The ghostly wailing of the eldrich cloud returned and began to approach us. We clung together, continually expressing our love to one another as we braced ourselves for the coming attack. We stayed like that for what felt like an eternity as the cloud hovered directly above us.

Gradually, the intensity of the wailing began to soften, until the tomb was once again as silent as every tomb should be.

Having waited for the death blow for ages, I began to realise that perhaps it wasn’t to come. I drew in a deep breath and slowly opened my eyes. The four abominations were no longer blocking our path. Instead, they were standing to the rear of the tomb, directly beneath the cloud. The pool of eyes within that glowing mass seemed to stare at us cautiously, the mouths along its edges all opened wide. It looked as though it was keeping a safe distance from us.

“Mia,” I whispered. “Open your eyes.”

She saw the watchful cloud and her face lit up. “It’s just watching us. Why?”

“I don’t know. But this may be our only chance.”

I had all but forgotten my ruined foot and fell over when I placed my weight on it as I stood up. I thought I’d be the one helping her out of this place, but it turned out I was the worse for wear. Mia wrapped an arm around me, supporting my weight, and with excruciating slow speed, we made our way to the entrance.

We passed the mangled remains of Hamza and the other man who had vaulted over the sarcophagus. I gasped when I saw what those “balls” really were: The mummified heads that had lined the catacomb slots. Most of them lay scattered about the place, their dried-out eyes staring vacantly. But a handful were still attached via their mouths to Hamza’s corpse. A red mush constantly oozed out from underneath the heads, like processed meat through a grinder. When I realised that they were mindlessly chewing and swallowing meat that would never sustain them, it took a lot of effort to not throw up.

We continued on, the light from the entrance growing brighter and brighter and making it easier to see ahead. We constantly looked back, keeping track of the cloud that was cautiously following us. Every time we looked, it seemed to recoil a few paces.

We reached the rubble of the collapsed seal, climbed through, and were finally blessed with beautiful daylight.

Immediately we were received by the eagerly awaiting crew who had remained outside. When they saw the extent of our injuries, their faces grew pale. I noticed several of them taking sneaky glances into the tomb.

“Get away from here!” I roared at them. “There is a great evil in there. Leave while you still can!”

“A fucking deserter just like those archaeologists,” one of them muttered. But the majority were giving the tomb uneasy glances.

We were swiftly tended to by medical staff who had been present ever since the drilling had commenced. They wasted no time in dragging the two of us up the ladder of the cage and up into the man bucket of the crane.

As the crane began to raise us up, dismay struck me as I looked down and saw that the crew had not heeded my warning and yet remained gathered outside the tomb. Something from within the tomb caught their attention, and they all shuffled away from it.

The eldritch cloud that had formed from the merging of all those crying faces that had been etched into the very walls, entered the daylight.

 It neither scurried back into its dark abode, nor began to attack the onlookers as it did to us. It simply rose into the sky. When it reached the same level we were dangling at, through the glare I could just make out all those eyes within looking upwards, and the mouths on its edge smiling. The higher it got, the fainter it became. At last, it merged with the clouds already in the sky and disappeared. 

When we landed on the plateau, the medical staff brought Mia and I to my quarters where our wounds were tended to. When they were done, we were left alone and told to rest. That was the last time we would ever see someone who worked at that site again, save for Joseph and Farah.

It was the morning of the following day when we were startled by their frantic knocking. We had slept little that night, tormented by the memories of what we had endured, and expecting to be interrogated by furious Palestinian officials over Suffian’s sudden absence. When Mia opened the door to the two cooks, they stared at her like it was the first time they’d ever seen another human. We received them and quickly learned what had prompted their surprise.

Everyone. Literally everyone who worked there, had committed suicide overnight.

We couldn’t believe what we were hearing.

 Joseph and Farah - a married couple who had met whilst working at the same restaurant - had been in the kitchen preparing the evening meal, having a nice conversation with two other colleagues whilst they worked. Joseph had asked one of them a question but there was an unexpected delay in a response. Confused, he and Farah had turned to see that their colleagues had halted what they were doing and were staring blankly at the closest wall. Deaf to their questions, the two walked casually to the wall and began slamming their heads against it.

 In shock at the unprecedented turn of events, Joseph and Farah had rushed out of the kitchen to get help. What they saw was a silent scene of death. People were walking to the cliff and jumping off, while others knelt and dashed their heads on the ground. There were no screams, no cries. Just swift and definite ends. They had tried speaking reason to many of them, but like the two in the kitchen, all were deaf to their words. Horrified out of their minds they locked themselves in their accommodations for the rest of that blood filled afternoon and through the night. When they came out in the morning, they searched all over the site for survivors. We were the only ones they had found.

Mia refused to believe their story, and hurried outside to see the aftermath for herself. She had only been absent for a minute when she returned, her eyes watery, face ashen. She sat beside me, and rested her head on my shoulder, lost in her own tormented thoughts. I held her hand. I needed no explanation of what she saw.

I recalled several key moments from Salome’s account, two particulars that stood out to me the most: The Spirits of the murdered children being vengeful, not only to their killers but to all who live. And the Herald’s warning to Salome, that “there is no knowing what position God would be in to counter them.”

The realisation of what had unfolded shook me to my core.

When the eldritch cloud of merged “spirits” left the tomb and rose to the sky, it was finally free from its two-thousand-year prison. With vengeance to all the living driving it, heightened by the unwarranted and unplanned killing of Herod - their primary focus over the last two millennia - their first target had been all workers at the base. I had thought the cloud had vanished when it merged with the natural clouds, but it had not gone far.  I wondered if those same ghostly tendrils had latched onto the suicide driven as it did to those within the tomb.

I shuddered to think of where that cloud had gone, and who would next fall victim to it.

We would find out later that day, when the four of us piled into one of the security SUV’s and drove back to Fasayil a few km away. We didn’t need to exit the vehicle to see that the Spirits had already been. Seeing three bodies resting against a bloodied wall was enough.

We drove until we reached a major city, where Joseph and Farah took us into a hospital. When the staff saw the damage to my foot, and the swelling in Mia’s face, we were swiftly received.

Joseph and Farah had remained with us for the first two days, that was, until Joseph decided to return to their village to tell their relatives that he and Farah were both safe. He was convinced that word of the disaster at Suffian’s excavation would spread rapidly, and his mother would not take the news lightly. It would be the last time Farah ever saw her husband again.

 That was three days ago.

It is here where we come to the present. Yesterday, Mia and I awoke to find the window of our fourth-floor room smashed, and Farah, who had remained with us this whole time, absent. How we had slept through the sound of shattering glass, I have no idea. As we approached the window, I couldn’t help noticing the utter silence coming out from the city below. We had grown used to the humming of vehicles and tooting of horns. Today, there was nothing.

When we reached the window and looked down, my heart lurched. There, Farah lay in a pool of her own blood, surrounded by shards of glass.

Mia - the runner of the two of us - rushed out of our room to seek help. I didn’t bother following her. Just as had happened at the base, and the neighbouring town, all the staff and patients of the hospital were dead. Like Farah, they had either jumped, or dashed their brains against the wall.

The outside silence was enough to tell me the same occurred throughout the entire city.

The cloud of the Spirits had come and gone, draining an entire city of millions of human lives in a single night.

It immediately prompted me to sit my ass down in front of this doctor’s computer, and record everything in which I have experienced up to this point. Seeing firsthand the exponential rise in the death’s dealt by the Spirits since they left the tomb a week ago, I know that the only way anyone can be prepared for them, is if I get my key observation out on the internet.

It may be the one thing that’ll be able to help the rest of the world, when the Spirits eventually come for them.

You may be wondering why the hell Mia and I were the only survivors of the expedition, the base, and this city. I had been wondering the same thing, that was, until Farah killed herself.

See, back at the base, Mia and I, and Farah and Joseph, were the only romantically bound pairs. Everyone else who had been prompted to take their own lives, shared one thing in common. They did not have a loved one nearby.

As I was halfway through writing this account, Mia and I were distracted when a group of 50 people alerted us to their presence out in the city. We hurried outside to meet them, and learned that they too were survivors of the mass suicide that had taken place in this city. The group turned out to contain 11 individual families. Families, bound by love.

It was then that our unexpected escape and survival from the horrors of the tomb made sense.

The Spirits are weak against the power of love. Love, at its strongest when those in union to it are together. I think that it may provide some sort of shield against the efforts of the Spirits, one that they cannot penetrate. That is, until those bounded by it are separated. Joseph and Farah had been able to survive the suicides at the base because they had been *together.* But with Joseph no longer present, Farah became an easy victim of the Spirits. If Joseph was still alive, his time would be very short.

Yet, even as I write this, I feel that there may be more behind the reasoning for the Spirits sparing of those bound by love. It’s a rather optimistic and hopeful theory, but one that actually makes a lot of sense. Despite being two thousand years old, they are ultimately the spirits of children. Children; who had been taken away from a potential lifetime of love. Perhaps their one redeeming feature may be that their vengeance overlooks love. What if, when love is playing out before them, they are given glimpses of their brief lives. Memories filled only with the unconditional love of their parents.

It is a somewhat comforting thought, despite all that compels them to kill.

All of the Herald’s and Salome’s efforts in containing those spirits had been for nothing. Suffian’s mad drive ultimately led to the place being unearthed and the spirits being released.

But whilst they are now running rampant about the world, prompting millions to suicide, let these words, like Salome’s, be my warning to you:

Keep you loved ones close. Do not go far without your spouse, parent, sibling, or child. But if duties compel you to do so, then, before you leave, hold them close and cover them with kisses, telling them just how much you love them. For it *may just be* the last time you’ll ever see them again.

It is out only weapon against them, until divine intervention can come.

Whatever is keeping God occupied, I pray that it be important. For if it keeps Him much longer, I fear He will return to a rather empty planet.
