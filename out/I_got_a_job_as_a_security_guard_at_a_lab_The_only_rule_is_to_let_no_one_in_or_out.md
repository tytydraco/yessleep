I was anxious about my first day on the job. I didn’t want to screw things up again like I did at the last one.

Dr. Mary had hired me for a simple position with good pay. I’d be the night security guard for her private lab.

It was located just outside town, in an area full of abandoned buildings, the kind of place where you’d expect no one to ask questions. I figured she valued discretion.

I arrived at 7 p.m. sharp, and she was expecting me in front of the door. 

“The rules are simple,” she said, her tone strict. “And I suggest you write them down, because we’ve had issues with the previous guard. No one enters the lab unless I’m here. And no one leaves either.”

That last part caught my attention, but before I could ask why, she continued.

“I hired you because I know you’ll do what’s necessary to follow my instructions. Right?”

There was something in her eyes that made me understand why I’d been given this chance. No one in their right mind hires an ex-convict as a guard unless the job requires... special care.

“Understood,” I said quickly. “No one in or out without you here.”

Dr. Mary gave a faint, satisfied smile and went on to show me the rest of the facility.

It reminded me of the infirmary back in prison. The lab had a main hall, with three side doors besides the exit. One led to a small break room, another to the security office where I’d spend most of my shift, and the last — protected by a badge reader — opened to the experiment chamber, where she and her two assistants went in and out during the day.

Before leaving, she told me that room was the most important one. I wasn’t allowed inside, but I was to guard it at all costs.

The first few hours of my shift passed quietly. I watched the exterior cameras, checking the empty streets outside, trying to figure out why she was so strict. But there was nothing unusual. That neighborhood was practically dead, and the only vehicle I saw all night was a garbage truck.

Once I relaxed, I spent the rest of my shift playing some stupid phone game, just like I used to do in my last job.

It wasn’t until around four in the morning that something strange happened.

I left the security room to grab a snack from the break room, but as I crossed the main hall, right in front of the experiment chamber door, I heard a sound.

A low, wet grunt. It paused, then started again, slow and irregular. It went on for several minutes before fading away completely.

At seven sharp, Dr. Mary’s car pulled up. I grabbed my stuff and met her by the entrance.

She asked if anything unusual had happened. I told her no. Whatever sound came from that room wasn’t my problem.

As I got into my car to finally head home, another vehicle arrived. Not the assistants, but a large man came out of it, clothes covered in dirt. Dr. Mary opened the door for him, and he went inside carrying several black plastic bags.

The next few days followed the same routine, except I started paying closer attention to the sounds coming from that room. There were two or maybe three voices, not talking exactly, more like moaning in pain.

It got under my skin. I even started wondering what had happened to the last guard. I found a small notebook under one of the monitors in the security room with his name on it. Adam. 

“How was your night?” Mary asked every morning, same cold tone.

“Nothing unusual,” I’d reply, never mentioning the voices.

Each morning ended the same way: me leaving, and that dirt-covered man arriving, always with more black bags. I kept wondering what kind of “research” required deliveries like that.

But two weeks later, something finally happened.

That night, like always, I pressed my ear against the metal door, trying to make out the voices. But between the groans, I heard a full sentence for the first time, like a whisper from someone in agony.

“*Kill me.*”

It repeated again and again.

“*Kill me.*”

I went home and couldn’t sleep. Something was very wrong inside that place, but I didn’t know what.

The name of the previous guard, Adam something, stuck in my mind. So I decided to look him up. It didn’t take long before I found a Facebook profile that matched: same city, same line of work, private security.

I clicked on his page to see more, but what caught my eye were the last few posts tagging him, all from a woman with his last name.

"*MISSING
Father of two. Last seen heading to the Walmart near the highway. If you have any information, please contact the number below.*"

I leaned back from the screen, a chill running down my arms. Could his disappearance have anything to do with the lab?

I spent the rest of the day digging through whatever I could find about both Adam and Dr. Mary. She had once been a tenured professor of medicine at an Ivy League university, with dozens of publications in experimental medicine, but after a certain year her name vanished from every record I could find.

By the time I drove back to the lab that night my mind was racing. I was still turning those thoughts over when my phone started vibrating.

“Are you on your way?” Dr. Mary’s voice sounded strained. “There’s been an emergency.”

“I’m one block away,” I told her.

When I pulled up to the lab she was standing outside, furious, yelling at her two assistants.

“One of them ran,” she said sharply as soon as she saw me.

“Who ran?” I asked.

“One of the subjects,” she snapped. “Just go. Bring it back.”

She pointed toward the alley behind the lab,  a narrow path that led into a stretch of abandoned lots.

I followed that way, flashlight in hand, noticing a trail on the ground: red, brown, yellow. Streaks of something that looked halfway between blood and chemical residue.

My steps quickened, though part of me wanted to turn back.

Near the edge of the property, I saw the subject lying on the ground, trembling. When I got closer my eyes struggled to make sense of it. It was shaped like a man, thick legs, a narrow torso, and arms that didn’t match in color or texture. 

The skin was a patchwork of tones. His head, pale and swollen, was attached to the neck with a mess of stitches and wire.

One eye was milky white. The other turned toward me.

I froze.

The face, gray and slack, was Adam’s.

For a few seconds he just stared, his mouth twitching, trying to form words.
And then they came.

“*Kill me. [Kill me](https://www.reddit.com/u/Accomplished_Low7889/s/xAPoxArSge).*”
