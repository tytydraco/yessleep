I knew something was off the moment I stepped through the door. The house was dead quiet—too quiet. Normally, Titan would be there instantly, his heavy Rottweiler paws pounding the floor, barking to welcome me home. But tonight, nothing. Just an eerie stillness that gnawed at the back of my mind.

“Titan?” I called out, stepping cautiously into the entryway. Still nothing.

A knot formed in my stomach as I made my way toward the living room. Titan’s growl, deep and wet, made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I rushed in, heart pounding, and saw him hunched over in the corner. His massive body trembled, and a low, guttural choking sound rattled from his throat.

“T-Titan?” I whispered, terrified. When I got closer, I saw it—his mouth was clamped around something. Something fleshy. He was gagging, trying to bite down, but his teeth kept slipping on… fingers.

My blood ran cold.

There, wedged between his teeth, were three severed human fingers—slick with blood and grime. My stomach lurched, and I stumbled back, gagging. Titan’s eyes were wide with panic, foam spilling from his mouth as he struggled to dislodge them. I couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I grabbed his snout, prying it open with trembling hands. The fingers, slippery with blood, fell free and hit the floor with a sickening *plop*. Titan whined, retreating to the corner, shaking off the nightmare lodged in his throat.

I stared at the fingers on the floor, my brain refusing to process what I was seeing. Pale, bloody, and jagged at the knuckles, like they'd been ripped off. My heart was pounding so hard it hurt. This couldn’t be real. And then, from the hallway, I heard it.

A soft creak.

My body stiffened, every nerve screaming at me to *run*. The hallway was shrouded in darkness, but there was movement—just a glimpse of a shadow shifting. Titan growled low, the sound vibrating through the air like a warning. He moved to stand between me and whatever was in the house, his muscles rippling with tension. “Hello?” I barely managed to whisper, my voice trembling.

Silence. Then, slow, deliberate footsteps.

From the shadows at the end of the hallway, something emerged—a tall, gaunt figure. My blood turned to ice. The thing—no, the *person*—stood there, half cloaked in the dim light. Their skin was a pale, sickly gray, and cradled against their chest was a bloody stump where their hand should’ve been. The missing fingers. Their eyes… their eyes were dark, hollow pits, like voids that seemed to drink in the light. But it was the smile—thin and twisted—that sent a surge of pure terror through me.

The intruder stepped forward, slowly, deliberately, with that sickening grin plastered on their face. I backed up, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. Titan growled louder, his teeth bared, but even he hesitated, unsure of what this thing was. The figure’s remaining hand flexed, long fingers twitching, as if itching to reach for me.

“You… shouldn’t have…” The voice was low, rasping, like a whisper dragged from the bottom of a grave.

Before I could move, the figure lunged.

I screamed, scrambling backward, but my feet slipped on the slick, bloody floor. I hit the ground hard, pain shooting up my spine. The intruder was on me in an instant, their cold, clammy hand clamping around my wrist, nails digging into my skin. I thrashed, trying to kick them off, but they were too strong—unnaturally strong. My vision blurred with panic as they leaned closer, their breath hot and rancid on my face. I was paralyzed, helpless as their empty eyes stared into mine, that twisted grin still stretching across their face.

“You’ll… replace… them…”

But before they could tighten their grip, a roar erupted from behind us.

Titan.

He lunged, his powerful jaws snapping at the intruder’s throat. They screamed—a horrible, shrill sound—as Titan’s teeth sank deep into their neck. Blood spurted, and the intruder thrashed wildly, but Titan didn’t let go. His growl was fierce, feral, as he dragged them away from me, shaking them like a rag doll.

I gasped for breath, scrambling to my feet. Titan was relentless, his jaws crushing down on the intruder’s throat until the air was filled with the sound of wet gurgling. The figure’s limbs flailed, but their strength was fading, their hollow eyes wide with something that almost looked like fear. I stumbled back, watching in horror as Titan finished the job. With one final, vicious shake, the intruder went limp, collapsing into a heap on the floor.

For a long moment, the house was filled with nothing but the sound of Titan’s panting and the heavy thudding of my own heartbeat. The silence was deafening. Titan, his fur matted with blood, stood over the lifeless body, growling low in his throat. He looked up at me, his dark eyes searching mine, as if waiting for some kind of reassurance.

I swallowed hard, my hands shaking uncontrollably. “Good boy, Titan. Good boy…”

But my words felt hollow. My mind was still reeling from what had just happened. I stumbled toward the door, needing air—needing *out*. As I fumbled with the lock, I glanced back one last time. The intruder’s body lay crumpled on the floor, the empty sockets where their eyes should have been staring up at the ceiling.

And then, just for a moment, I thought I saw them smile again.
