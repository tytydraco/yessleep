Closing shift at the daycare has always unsettled me. During the day, the building is alive with shrieks and laughter, paint-stained smocks, and the constant clatter of toys hitting the floor. But once the last parent signs their child out, the noise drains away, leaving a hollow stillness.

The place feels wrong when it’s quiet. Too big. Too empty. The murals on the walls—smiling animals and dancing cartoon fruit—always seem brighter, sharper, when the lights dim for the night.

That night, I was alone on closing. I went through my checklist, like always: tidy the art room, wipe down the snack tables, stack the miniature chairs. I hummed to myself as I worked. Not because I wanted to, but because silence here has weight to it. It presses on your chest.

By the time I reached the baby room, the rest of the building was dark. Only the hallway night-lights glowed, leaving faint pools of orange against the linoleum. I flicked on the switch and stepped in. The smell of baby powder and disinfectant hit me. Cribs lined the walls, each one stripped bare, blankets folded at the ends.

That’s when I heard it.

A giggle.

It was faint, high-pitched, and quick, like a child trying to stifle laughter. I froze, one hand still on the light switch. I knew for a fact every child had gone home. I had checked them all out myself.

“Hello?” I called, voice shaking.

No answer. The giggle stopped.

I stepped further in, checking behind rocking chairs, peering into empty cribs. Nothing. Just silence, thick and heavy. Then—movement. Something small rolled out from under one of the cribs and bumped into my shoe. A block. Bright red, worn at the corners.

I hadn’t left any toys in here.

My throat tightened. I bent slowly, picked it up, and set it on the changing table. My hand shook as I turned back toward the door.

Another giggle. This time behind me.

I spun around. The room was empty. The block I’d set down was gone.

That’s when the lights flickered. Once. Twice. Then steadied. My skin prickled. Every instinct screamed at me to leave.

I backed out into the hall, fumbling with the keys. My hands were sweaty, slipping against the metal as I tried to lock the baby room door. That’s when I glanced at the reflection in the glass.

And I saw them.

Lined up in the hallway behind me, shoulder to shoulder. Small figures. Dozens of them. Their outlines faint but unmistakable—children. Standing perfectly still, too still.

I couldn’t breathe. I turned, but the hallway was empty. Just shadows and the low hum of the exit sign. My pulse pounded in my ears.

I forced the key into the lock and twisted hard, sealing the door. When I looked back at the glass, the reflections were closer. Their faces were pale smudges, eyes like dark pits.

Then, in a whisper that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once, I heard it:

“You forgot to say goodbye.”

The night-lights went out all at once, leaving me in absolute black.

And something small, cold, and damp slipped its hand into mine.
