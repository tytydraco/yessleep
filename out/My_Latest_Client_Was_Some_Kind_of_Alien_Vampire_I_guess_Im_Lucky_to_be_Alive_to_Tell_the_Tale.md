“Hi- Jared, is it? Would you like a glass of cucumber water as I get the room ready?” I smiled at him. 

Jared seemed a bit nervous, but I was used to that. Massages are slightly weird things, after all.

And he was a first-timer, it was on the Client Info form. He smiled at me, and I noticed, in the flickering electric candlelight, how sharp and white his teeth were.

“Thanks- don’t need anything.”

“Very well- You can strip to the waist behind the screen there, perfect. Any particular areas you’d like me to focus on- or keep clear from? No- just a standard back massage, gotcha. Now I’ll get you to settle face down on the bed. Are you ok if I slide a heated pad just here? Lovely.”

I couldn’t help noticing his beautiful skin. As a professional massage therapist, I’m used to handling human skin in all sorts of conditions, and barely notice it any more than you notice the type of paper your office uses, if, that is, you still work in an office that uses paper.

And if you do, once in a while, you’ll come across an exceptionally smooth glossy flawless piece of paper that you can’t help but notice. That was Jared’s skin.

As I laid my hands on his back, even before I heard his thoughts, I realised I had never touched human skin like this – this cool, metallic, sliding texture.

And then I heard his first thought.

*“I am so hungry”*

It was jarring to say the least. Not the content of the thought, obviously, but the fact that I heard it. Nobody had said anything.

By whatever mechanism, the mere act of massage was releasing his thoughts to me.

But not vice versa.

*“I could suck her empty right now”*

My hands froze. Again, it wasn’t the content, although that was terrifying enough. I have to acknowledge that sadly in my line, we get all sorts of innuendoes, and it really is up to each professional to draw that line about what they will and will not tolerate.

Obviously if that last sentence had been said out loud, I would have been out of there like a bat of hell. But it hadn’t been. And yet I heard it clearly. I pressed my hands deep into the lovely shimmery skin and he grunted mildly.

“*I shouldn’t spoil my appetite. I can feed later”*

I circled the knotty areas, and the skin moved- differently somehow. I couldn’t help peering closer, and as I pressed and rolled the skin, it seemed like tiny scales opened up, and I glimpsed a bright flash of different colour beneath the skin.*“There’s plenty to choose from. And this feels so good. I should let her finish.”*

I usually don’t chat with clients, but I couldn’t help it. “Um, so what line of work are you in?”

“I work in the meat industry” came his muffled reply.

“Oh” I couldn’t think of anything to respond, and I just dug my hands in deeper than I had so far.

He grunted. *“Ow- that hurts. Oh if only she knew the pain I could give her. Ow”*

Quickly I adjusted the pressure. “Was that too painful?” I asked kindly.

“No of course not!” he snapped. I couldn’t resist smiling- it was good to know toxic masculinity was alive and well even among non-humans.

I felt morbidly curious about the way his skin moved. Incautiously, I pressed hard again, into the side of his neck.

“Ah!” This time he couldn’t help grunting out loud. I heard his exclaimed thought *“Mother of God-“*

“Let me know if that’s too much pressure!” I said brightly.

“No” he cried out, louder than necessary, but involuntarily he moved his neck so his mouth and teeth were almost touching my busy hands. I felt an ice-cold breath on my hands, and in a moment of pure terror, I stayed completely still, my hands still on his neck.

We both almost stopped breathing. “*I should take her right now*” I heard. He moved his face slightly closer to my hands, and a razor-sharp tooth grazed my thumb.

I heard a faint whimper.

It took me a moment to realise the whimper was coming from me.

The moment passed. *“I cannot deal with the blood here. I will hunt elsewhere. I just need this to be over”*

I busily moved my hands away from his neck, down to his lower back. “Let’s concentrate on this part!”

Once again I was entranced by how the shimmery skin moved. I was happy to hear a sigh of relief. “*Oh that feels so good!”*

A true professional, I concentrated on making my client feel good, taking care to stay away from his sore neck. He seemed to drift into a zen state, at least I didn’t hear any further thoughts. The massage finished in silence, and he left me great tip when he left.
