During the December winter break, when I was studying at Oxford, my friends dared me: Spend twelve hours in Galloway Forest Park, in nothing but your underwear, and we’ll pay you £200\*.\* I loved challenges, so of course I agreed.

When the day finally arrived, at 10 p.m. I was driven in my friends’ car to Galloway Forest Park, where I removed my clothes, leaving just my blue Calvin Klein briefs on.  Stepping barefoot onto the road in the heavier-than-expected torrential rain, my friends watched as I disappeared into the black void of the forest before driving off, promising to return in the morning.

As the unrelenting rain continued to attack the forest mercilessly, I was soaked within seconds, like a sponge left overnight in a pail. Still, I pressed on, determined to get about 200 footsteps away from the road as I had promised.

When I reached the 195th step, my teeth gritted in pain as I suffered cuts on my bare soles from the rocks and leaves, temporarily affecting my already-diminished ability to navigate the darkness of the forest, which was barely illuminated by the moonlight. All of a sudden, the straight route disappeared and I tumbled painfully down an unseen rocky slope. As I did, the extremely sharp rocks assaulted my body  scraping against my skin and  cutting open many wounds.

When I finally staggered to my feet after much effort, shivering I noticed the many cuts and bruises on my torso. Blood flowed down, but the rain quickly washed them away within seconds. My soaked briefs were almost fully ripped at the seam, with thin fabric clinging useless to my freezing skin, barely covering anything anymore. The cold rain slid straight through the tear, leaving me exposed and shivering in the dark. With the storm showing no signs of stopping, I tried to climb back up, but my legs hurt way too much for me to even climb a step. Having no choice, I quickly glanced around for any shelter I could find. My vision was a bit blurry as my head was hurt, but in the distance, by luck stood a cottage. It was an ancient Scottish-style house with stone walls. Knowing it would be a perfect place to shelter, I decided to see if I could stay there for the night.

I approached and knocked on the wooden door, which swung open after just a single knock. From the outside I could see nobody inside, and the furniture was caked in dust. Desperate for shelter, I stepped onto the dust-covered floor and searched the house, managing to find a bed in a bedroom. It was as dusty as the rest of the house, but it would provide a place for me to sleep until morning. Taking a precaution, I returned to the main door and locked it. As I staggered back to the bedroom, I decided that in the unlikely chance the owner showed up, I would explain myself.

After a failed attempt to take a shower in the bathroom as there was no running water, I flopped down on the single bed. I kept my wet tore briefs on, believing it was more decent in case the owner arrived.

Looking around the room, I noticed the walls were adorned with many portraits painted in incredibly realistic detail. They looked so lifelike that you could not easily tell them apart from actual humans. Some wore medieval Scottish garb, while others were dressed more contemporarily. All had one thing in common, though: their eyes appeared to be staring directly at me. Their features showed either grins that would make a cat sick or expressions of pure hatred.

Staring back, my discomfort peaked. Nonetheless, I made a concerted effort to ignore the creepy faces. I turned to face the wall and, as sleep crept in, I fell into a restless slumber.

The next morning, my friends returned to the spot where they had dropped me off. This time, however, they were accompanied by my parents and the police. My parents demanded an explanation from the friends as to why I hadn’t been answering their calls. When the friends confessed, they were made to contact the authorities, as it was known the forest could be very dangerous at night much less during a storm, and with someone wearing almost nothing.

As the search party combed the woods, a couple of my friends came across the cottage. Knowing I would most likely have sheltered there, they pushed open the door and, to their relief, saw bare footprints in the dust. They called out my name multiple times.

No answer.

Entering the cottage, the friends noted how dusty everything was and how antiquated the furniture looked.

As they stepped into the bedroom, they came across the same creepy paintings I had seen on the walls. There they found me, in a deep sleep on the bed.

And above the bed hung a portrait, its paint still wet, of a terrified and angry young man wearing a familiar pair of blue Calvin Klein briefs.
