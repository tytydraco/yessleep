It happened around the age of twelve.

Maybe thirteen. I stopped really caring about my birthday around then. My parents were terrible about waiting to give me presents, so the day was mostly just cake and hanging out. Not to say we were rich—my dad just worked hard and liked to provide.

I miss that about him. He was the kind of man who’d pull double shifts just to make his wife and kid smile. I didn’t really understand why he was out so late back then.

I was on my bike. They’d bought it for me about a month earlier, and I was riding it down to a little lakeside community where a nice older man my mother knew let us play on his dock. People weren’t as worried about lawsuits back then, and I’d already learned how to swim.

The bike was shiny and red. Not the highest-end thing in the world, but perfect for my little solo adventures down country roads. I’d spent the hot summer day splashing in the shallows, collecting stray shells, rocks, and other waterlogged tokens of my time by the water when I noticed how low the sun was getting.

I didn’t have a smartphone back then. Cell phones existed, but they were expensive, and I’ll admit it—I didn’t really know how to read a watch. I just guessed the time by the sun. Thought it made me cool. Outdoorsy.

I pulled myself up the water-worn wooden blocks lining the edge of the lake near the docks, picked my bike up from where it lay in the grass (yeah, yeah—try using a kickstand on gravel), and walked it to the edge of the sleepy little community.

It was gated. Supposed to be, anyway. At some point it had been private, but once everyone started aging out and passing homes down to their grandkids they stopped bothering to close the gate. I wasn’t going to complain. It meant access to the only real entertainment the place had, aside from walking the woods.

We were hours away from any real town. The small one we went to school in was still a forty-five-minute car ride. Real middle-of-nowhere type of place.

I didn’t really think about how dangerous that was back then.

Not until this incident.

After this, I stopped going out alone. Started staying indoors more.

I was maybe ten minutes into the ride when I heard a rustle in the treeline to my left. No big deal—probably a deer or a local dog. I glanced over casually, expecting to see something bolt.

The only thing around there that could really cause trouble was a wild pig, but they generally avoided people. At least back then. Nowadays, I hear they’re more aggressive.

Instead, all I saw was the brush settling. Like whatever had been moving froze when I turned my head.

Weird. But again—probably a dog or maybe a hare. The woods were always moving with something.

I kept pedaling at a leisurely pace. Enjoying my little bit of freedom.

But I kept hearing it.

A rustle to my left, a snap of a twig, something keeping pace with me.

It was probably stupid, but I slowed down. Figured maybe some friendly pooch followed me from the lake and wanted attention. When I came to a stop, I heard the rustling continue for another second.

Whatever it was, it was close enough behind me that the rustling continued for a few seconds after I stopped.

Just enough for me to see a snippet of it.

A long tail. Brown hind legs.

Not a dog’s tail — sleek and rounded, brown fading to black. I recognized it from the movies. A small voice in the back of my head — calm, not panicked yet — went:

“Oh. A cougar.”

I don’t know why I was so nonchalant about it. It took a full minute for it to really sink in.

They weren’t supposed to be in the area. Hell, not even in the state.

My uncle always said they were out there. He lived about an hour away, and we’d heard them screaming at night — that sound that’s supposed to resemble a woman dying. I just assumed it was one or two in his neck of the woods.

Back then, it was all just observation.

Harmless.

They couldn’t get me when I was surrounded by adult men who loved guns more than beer.

But I wasn’t around adults.

I wasn’t around my uncle and his shotgun, or my dad and his revolver.

I was a kid—maybe twenty or thirty feet from a predator that had probably already pegged me as something worth stalking.

I started to pedal.

In hindsight, that was probably stupid. There’s probably some study out there that says make yourself big, maintain eye contact, back away slowly. But you try being thirteen and alone near a mountain lion and tell me you’re thinking rationally.

Adrenaline’s a hell of a drug.

I was pedaling faster than I ever had before. The bike began to wobble as I hit my first downhill slope with too much speed, fear driving my legs harder as I fought to keep control.

I looked to my left and couldn’t see it, but I just knew it was there—following me, waiting for me to mess up. Every time I looked ahead and realized how far I still was from home, the panic got worse.

When I looked back from the treeline to the road, I remembered the pothole I had avoided on my way in.

Too late.

The front wheel sank in and I felt a sudden jerk as I went flying. I skidded hands-first down the road, belly scraping the asphalt..

I still have the scar on my knee from the road rash. Tore my jeans and shirt and left my palms looking like they’d been hit with a gravel-filled cheese grater.

It hurt. Bad.

As a kid, you don’t really know the difference between pain that’s bad and pain that’s *really bad*. I pulled myself into a kneeling position, briefly forgetting where I was as I looked down at my torn skin and tried to get my bearings.

Then I heard the sound of something moving through the heavy leaf litter. 

All thoughts of broken bones vanished and pain was pushed to the back of my mind.

I should’ve turned around and grabbed my bike.

But I ran.

I ran into the treeline, away from the rustling.

I don’t know what I was thinking. I don’t know what the cougar was thinking either.

Maybe it was playing. Cats play with their food, right?

I moved through the brush, not caring about the blackberry bushes whipping and tearing into my exposed leg. I stumbled into a clearing torn up by what looked like wild hogs—thick muddy divots, upturned earth.

I only stopped when I found an old shed. Or maybe it was a tiny house at some point. The window was busted and the roof was half-collapsed. But to me, it was a miracle.

The rotten wood door hung open, crooked on its hinges.

I grabbed the door by its edge and yanked it behind me, letting it slam unevenly against the frame. I scrambled, my fingers jammed into the empty hole where the doorknob used to be, and I pulled.

Thank God the old door seemed to suck into the frame.

I leaned back, throwing my weight into it, fingers digging into the rotten wood as I waited.

I half expected the cat would grab the door. Like it would somehow know to open it.

I heard crashing through the woods. Leaves shuffling. Branches snapping.

Then a hard thump against the doorframe that sent me jolting.

Then the soft pad of something heavy.

Close enough that I could hear breathing—slow, controlled—and once, just once, a low sound that might’ve been a growl. Or maybe just air forced through something too big to be quiet.

Something was circling.

Something was deciding what to do.

There was no way I’d just outrun it.

My hand started to slip. Sweat soaked the wood. I tightened my grip until it hurt.

That’s when I heard it.

I still don’t know what it was.

A loud crack. Or maybe a crunch. Like someone snapping a tree trunk in half. Then a half-second of rustling.

And nothing.

I held my breath, waiting for something else.

Another sound. Another attempt at the door.

Nothing.

I don’t know how long it was before I let myself breathe again. Every time I thought about opening that door, all I could imagine was a large brown cat forcing its way inside.

I didn’t dare open it.

Not until my fingers went numb and my stomach ached.

Not until I heard nothing but crickets.

I didn’t leave all at once. I cracked the door and peered out.

It was a full moon—bright enough to see. The woods looked clear.

The walk back to the road was almost worse than the run. Every snapped twig made me flinch, waiting for something to leap out of the dark.

But nothing did.

I limped back to my bike, feeling the pain from my barely scabbed over wounds pulling with each step. The adrenaline had long worn off, replaced by a deep ache in my arms and a dull throb in my leg.

Eventually, headlights found me.

My dad’s old yellow headlights. His beat-up red work truck. I’d wanted the bike to match.

He pulled over fast, hazards flashing. The door flew open.

“WHERE THE **HELL** HAVE Y—”

He stopped when he saw me.

That night was spent with my mom cleaning cuts and bruises while my usually stoic dad stomped around, getting his hunting gear together and talking about trying to find the thing while my mom tried to talk him out of it.

It was only later we noticed something strange.

All my cuts were above the knee.

But the soles of my shoes were soaked with blood.

Weeks passed. No sign of the cougar.

We went back to the shed, armed and ready. My mom relented when my uncle said he’d come. We found blood spatter—mostly around one tree about ten feet away, smeared with old, dried blood. My dad took that as proof it was still hunting nearby.

There was an animal attack. Supposedly the cougar. Jack—the guy who ran the gas station and burger joint—was mauled.

After that, local dogs started vanishing.

The wild pigs, though, seemed to be doing fine. Bigger wallows showed up. More of them.

No livestock ever went missing.

If anything, the number of snakes and coyotes dropped.

I’m bringing this up because I came back.

Came back to visit the lake.

The fry cook at the steak joint by the water was attacked last night.

It’s been over fifteen years.

Do cougars live that long?
