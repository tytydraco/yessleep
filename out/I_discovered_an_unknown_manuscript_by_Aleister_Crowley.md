The Ordo Templi Orientis or O.T.O; was a hermetic Freemason organization associated with Aleister Crowley, L. Ron Hubbard, and other 19th century occultists. Their underground society was closely connected with the rich and powerful academic elite. In the early 1900’s, the Los Angeles chapter was quite active and caused frequent controversy in the news. This brief history lesson is highly pertinent to what I’m about to reveal. 

I became interested in secret societies  as a teenager after reading a number of compelling tales about Crowley’s infamous adventures and lurid sex debauchery. As a non-believer, I was never interested in the occult or black magic myself. What did fascinate me were the unusual characters through history who intentionally involved themselves with arcane mysticism and the supernatural. What drew them to that lifestyle? 

News stories from the era speculated wildly about O.T.O necromancy and paranormal rites conducted behind their closed doors. It was engrossing but I took most of it with a grain of salt. It seemed like fanciful fodder to sell newspapers. While not believing the extreme, fanciful hype, I rabidly consumed numerous biographies about the man’s legendary antics and the wide assortment of underground organizations he was associated with.  One thing was clear. Aleister Crowley unapologetically courted controversy and wore it like a badge of honor. 

As the years passed, my overall interest in the subject dissipated. I started a family and crafted a career as a graphic artist and digital image manipulator. Those old fascinations were all but lost until one day, several decades later, when I found myself on a working vacation in Los Angeles. It was my first time visiting the fabled ‘city of angels’. Fearing it might be my only chance to sightsee and explore the region, I decided to explore as many places of interest as I could. 

I visited the intersection of 39th and Norton where the ‘Black Dahlia’ was found bisected in 1947. That was a bit anticlimactic, seeing the sanitized site so many years after the events, but it was still something I could mark off my quirky bucket list of true crime. Then I toured various other infamous locations of mysteries and historical events. After knocking out my entire itinerary, I realized I had almost a full day of sightseeing time left. It was then I remembered the tantalizing headlines from the L.A. newspapers and tabloids about the secretive O.T.O. Headquarters. 

I decided to look up the address. 

Good or bad, depending on your perspective and the circumstances, you can find anything if you search the right way. The address was only a few miles from my current location. With that serendipity, it seemed like an obvious ‘yes’. I figured the building itself would be long gone, but to my surprise it was dilapidated, but still there. I matched the location with old photos in the city archives.

Initially I was going to take a selfie in front of the crumbling walls for my social media profile, then move on to the next adventure. Being fueled by risk-taking and adrenaline-charged stupidity, I had the incredibly poor idea to walk around to the back and ‘explore’ a little more. By the look of things, the forgotten place hadn’t been occupied for a long time. It was fully abandoned and boarded up. I’ll admit, those lascivious stories about sex orgies and sacrificial black magic got the better of me. 

I had to know what was inside. 

I looked around nervously before crossing the line from ‘harmless but morbid’; to actually breaking the law. All of those legal concerns however, were unnecessary. The property was definitely abandoned. There were no ‘caution’ warnings or ‘no trespassing’ signs. No one was around to protest, and no one cared. Still, I felt like a robber on a thrilling bank heist, as I pulled back one of the barricade planks to creep inside. 

I used my phone’s flashlight to guide my way. The old stories didn’t offer any inside photos because the O.T.O. was so private and secretive. I was touring the hidden premises of what very few others ever witnessed. The remaining decor was elegant, but perhaps a little bit mundane. The building was basically empty with mostly bare walls. I was genuinely disappointed there weren’t lascivious nude statues and goat-headed altars all around to confirm the diabolical motif I expected.

I figured the mystique about what they did behind closed doors was shameless self-promotion to attract attention and money for their coffers. By appearances, it was an ordinary office building. I realized the human imagination can produce far more of a mysterious legacy than reality does. Regardless, I took lots of pictures and video to document my findings. 

Just when I was about to wrap up my titillating little foray into ‘cat-burgling’, I realized a thin sliver of light was shining under an empty bookshelf along the back wall! If the windows hadn’t been boarded up and lights were on inside, it would be easy to see. The building had no source of power, so it had to be coming from BEHIND the bookcase. That really piqued my curiosity. 

Could there be a secret room? 

My imagination went full ‘nuclear’. I set my phone down and pulled hard on the shelf. Nothing. It was as if it was anchored to the wall with heavy duty bolts. It made no sense. I tried the other side. It felt equally secure. I was stumped. Then it occurred to me to try the opposite of what I’d been doing. I pushed firmly on both sides and something audibly clicked. The entire shelving unit pushed forward past a threshold into the wall, and then it glided on a roller track, back out of the way. I was breathless! Before me was a hidden staircase leading down to a subterranean room. 

I don’t mind admitting I was afraid. My initial perception of the upstairs was underwhelming to say the least, and downright dull. I realized that sterile facade was by design, in case they were raided by the authorities. For that clever level of misdirection and security, it meant they genuinely had something significant to hide down below. Holy Hell! I was perched upon the stairway to the dark legacy of whatever those secrets were. 

With shaky knees, I descended the dusty steps. The secret lair of this infamous O.T.O. black lodge had been unvisited for perhaps 70 years. Let me tell you folks, their sinister reputation was deserved and real! Whatever you might’ve expected me to find wouldn’t even come close to the terrifying things I actually discovered there. It looked like an exaggerated Hollywood movie set of what a film studio would expect from an hidden occult temple. 

There was a menacing-looking altar, a large pentagram marked on the floor, black candles still in the wall sconces, and cryptic, indecipherable inscriptions graced the dark walls. I couldn’t be sure what the arcane sigils themselves said, but I assumed they were written in Enocian or other secret languages. It was the whole nine yards of occult clichés.

It truly was a devilish, satanic ‘haven’. 

I was a fly on the wall in a brooding abyss never meant to be seen by unauthorized spectators. I was so stunned and creeped out by the pervasive aura of evil, that I committed THE cardinal sin. I failed to document it! Honestly, it’s all I could do to not immediately tear out of that creepy den in murderous iniquity and run for my life. The more I surveyed the forbidden surroundings, the more I desperately needed to ‘scram’. I feared the upstairs bookcase might snap shut like a boobytrap inside a Pharaoh’s protective tomb, and seal my fate forever. 

As a foolhardy parting gesture to doom us all, I impulsively grabbed a large leather-bound volume laying on the sacrificial altar on the way out. At the time, I figured there would be no harm in taking an old book which no one alive even knew was there, in the long-abandoned derelict building. In lieu of photographic evidence, that book was going to be my ‘proof of the existence’ of the hidden room. That is, if I summoned the courage to admit my ‘unauthorized exploration’ of the shuttered location in the first place. 

Back outside in the relative safety of my rental car, I could finally breathe again. I’d escaped the horrid temple where God knows what transpired! It really seemed like a vivid nightmare, but the hand-bound leather tome felt real enough in the soothing light of the southern California sunshine. My fear and trepidation rapidly dissipated. I actually felt silly being so spooked exploring the defunct lodge’s hidden room. It had been literally abandoned for decades, for heaven’s sake. I let my imagination run wild over a long-abandoned room and superstitions I didn’t believe in. 

Depending on what the manuscript contained, I might be able to convince others of its authenticity and historic importance. I didn’t look inside the cover until I drove back to my hotel. There, I discovered two significant details. 

First of all, it was actually handwritten by ‘Frater Perdurabo’, which I knew to be Aleister Crowley’s pseudonym! I could hardly believe my stroke of luck. It had an incredible pedigree and was probably worth a pretty penny to book collectors. The second fact, however was less engrossing. Almost all the text had been manually redacted until it was virtually unreadable. 

For what reason, I couldn’t imagine at the time. 

Everything afterward was a blur. I flew home the next day and told my family about my other California adventures, while carefully omitting the part about my unlawful entry and ‘innocent little souvenir’ taken from the O.T.O ruins. There was nothing wise to gain by mentioning that illicit detail. I kept his handwritten lodge journal a closely-guarded secret and studied it after my family went to bed each night. 

It occurred to me I could scan the pages and isolate the redaction ink from Crowley’s own handwriting since they were slightly different shades. My photo editing software could separate and ‘erase’ the redaction overlay. Once I programmed the correct isolation threshold, it was like digital magic. Poof. I was able to read the eccentric man’s elegant, ornate writing perfectly. As a gentleman who existed long before computers, he obviously learned the importance of a steady hand and carefully formed letters. 

As soon as I removed the redaction from each page scan, I ‘saved as’ and curated the adjusted versions in my database. In just a few days I had all 127 pages cleaned up and organized. A careful cross-examination of his published works confirmed what I had in my greedy hands was a completely unknown and unprinted composition! Considering the incredible rarity of such an unbelievable find by a person who many consider to be the father of the modern new age of the occult, I was shocked and thrilled. This ‘lost volume’ could be worth millions to the right bidder through auction; and later, publishing rights. 

The honest truth was, I spent so much time manipulating the scanned pages deciphering them, I completely failed to pay any attention to the substance of his words themselves. Remember, I wasn’t a believer, or enthusiast of the occult or dark arts. That aspect of his well documented life was just hocus-pocus and mumbo-jumbo. It was his charismatic personality and colorful antics I found fascinating. Once I started paying closer attention to what he wrote in the unpublished manuscript however, I couldn’t stop reading. It was his personal ‘how to’ journal or ‘grand grimoire’, on the secret rituals necessary to summon the mythical supernatural beings he’d often spoke of. 

The book was going to be my ‘golden ticket’, as soon as I proved official provenance. I couldn’t stop dreaming of the pile of money it would bring me. Never once did I believe a word of it. Acknowledge that huge failure in judgment, I know my most deadly mistake in the spiraling series of bad decisions was in obtaining it. The second was to render it readable again. As I ignorantly quoted the diabolical incantations aloud, it was purely from curiosity. I might as well have been reading Shakespearean prose. I felt it was goofy, spell-casting nonsense and demonology fiction. 

Without meaning to, or even realizing it was actually possible, I have freed the trapped (and intensely angry) supernatural deities Crowley referred to as ‘Aiwass’ and ‘Choronzon’. This unholy work has taught a disbelieving fool like me how to release two hellish demons from their long-held bonds, deep within the abyss. It is a horrible tragedy I’ve brought upon myself and the entire world through misguided greed. Sadly, I lack the knowledge or ritual understanding of how to defend myself, or to send them back to the netherworld from whence they came. 

The moment I rattled off the detailed invocations, my entire home began to shake and vibrate. My wife pounded on the door, thinking I’d fallen asleep during a persistent earthquake. I was too startled to answer for several moments. Two ethereal wraiths materialized at opposite ends of my office and cast a malevolent aura of pure dread. The potent stench they brought with them reminded me of a festering slaughterhouse. 

All I can say about their appearance is, it was beyond human articulation to adequately describe. It was as if I was trapped between two billowing storm clouds. They were ‘electrified genies’ hoping to escape to a slightly larger ‘bottle’ than the one they’d been trapped inside. They violently bounced around my office like feral, rampaging beasts trying to breach the tiny enclosure. Their obvious contempt for human beings paled in comparison to their polarized distain for each other.

While I fear my life will become collateral damage in their ferocious rampage to escape, I worry infinitely more they will be successful! I alone bear full responsibility for my stupidity if they ever get out of here but we will all pay the price! I believe they are spiritually bound to the walls of the temple where they were summoned. In this case, my office is ‘the temple’. As a lowly human of no interest to them, I was initially ignored, but that changed as their frustration grew. 

Frequently they mock and pummel me with fierce blows I don’t see coming, nor can I defend myself against. I shouted through the door for my wife to take our children and flee. She protested briefly, but heard the urgency in my voice and thankfully complied. I was relieved. At least they were able to escape the unholy mess l’ve made. I haven’t dared open my door to follow them to safety, for fear the charnel devils I’d unwittingly unleashed will use that clear opening to bypass the invocation field. 

Only after carelessly summoning two prater-human spirits have I finally comprehended the reason for the redaction of his powerful words. I thought the manuscript was simply bogeyman nonsense and witchcraft posturing to intimidate and impress the impressionable. Why didn’t they just burn the damn tome and spare the world this plague? Were they too greedy to fully destroy the master’s work? Did they really believe it could be controlled and harnessed? 

I’m definitely a true believer now, but the damage is done. I’m desperately hoping a sympathetic soul reading this testimony will come forward and help me re-cage the wrathful, furious spirits I’ve set free. Does anyone know how to send them back to Hell?
