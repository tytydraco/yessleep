Esmeralda stood there, Reginald’s blood dripping off of her bronze clad gloves, her face calm, her violet eyes were glaring into mine.

I closed my eyes and tried to view her spirit.

To this day, I regret this decision. 

Towering over this demure woman were a pair of twin vortexes of violet and black ether which tinged the entire shadow world in an even deeper darkness.  As if she were the opposite of a light-source, robbing the surrounding world blind of any glow that it previously had. 

Suspended in the void was her central aura, torrents of energy swirled at her feet, which appeared as if they were massive cloven hooves, and over her head. Upon her head were a pair of mighty horns, appearing as if they were carved from stone that grew directly from her head.

Her eyes were empty, sans for the burning flames of violet that pulsated through the torrents of energy that surrounded her in rivers of chaos and calamity.

Within these swirling torrents of smoke, steam, or mist of darkness, I could see lids form.  Moments later, hundreds of violet eyes, identical to Esmeralda's flaming sockets, opened up all around me.

The power that exuded from her penetrated into every facet of the foyer as I felt the ground beneath my feet quiver and shake.

Esmeralda's voice filled the room as her many eyes fixed upon me.  “**You are her guide?**  **How curious that you can see before your charge**.  **All the more reason to rid us of your presence first and foremost before we dispatch** ***her***.”  

I opened my physical eyes, seeing the apparently demure woman now, with the dark energy super-imposed behind her.  

It was as if I could not unsee what I had just seen. In a panic I grabbed Cassara by the shoulder, “We gotta go!”

“I can take her down,” Cassara assured.

“No, you can’t!” I shouted as I pulled at Cassara, attempting to get her to run from the front door and search for another way out.  

Any way out.

Esmeralda raised her hand, and I watched something horrific rip out and seize Brittney’s throat, dragging her from under me, directly in front of Esmeralda .

“Your mission was simple, Brittney: Observe, and report to our Mistress.  This was your first task and already, you’re as useful as you were when we were confined to the depths below.”

“Hey!  I was doing fine until the angel boy and the Valkyrie showed up!” Brittney defended.

Esmeralda’s dark violet eyes glared at me, “That is *no* angel, Brittney.”

My stomach sank as Esmeralda moved Brittney to her right, dropping the succubus on her within the violet seal that she had arrived in, before she slowly approached Cassara and I.

“Run!” I screamed, turning to try and find a way out of the mansion.

Before we could even turn to the hallway, a wall of black energy rose up, smacking me in the face.

Cassara swung her fist at it, which only resulted in the blue flames from her fist rippling outwards, showing the full extent of the massive barrier preventing us from escaping. 

It’s from floor to ceiling and wall to wall, an impenetrable yet translucent black barrier. 

“Intelligent decision,” Esmeralda informed as I spun around to see her eyes glowing violet, “Poor execution.”

Cassara glared at Esmeralda, the flames around her fists growing larger.  She reared her fist back and punched forward, a ball of blue and red flames heading towards Esmeralda.

Esmeralda didn’t budge, but stood firm as the flames crashed against her, the fire spreading over her body as she locked eyes with Cassara.

I paused, looking at Cassara as she looked to her hands.

“Did you just-”

“Throw a Hadoken? Yeah… Kinda?” Cassara said with a confused shrug.

I turned to Esmeralda, seeing her begin to chuckle.

“Ah, flames!” Esmeralda chortled, “I nearly forgot: The one weakness of demon kind! Fire!” Esmeralda’s lips turned up into an agitated half smile, “If this is all the great Christian *God* can muster against us the end times are to be short lived indeed.”

Cassara turned to me, “Hey David, if you were to suddenly unlock some Godly power, now would be a good time to start!”

“Afraid I’m not the sort to give that kind of leeway,” Esmeralda announced as I saw her aura flexing around her body in a way that made my stomach sink and my arms tingle.

I closed my eyes quickly, shifting my vision to the spirit world, in an effort to slow things down.

As I did I saw the ground crackling with violet energy as Esmeralda’s spirit had sunken down and was rapidly shifting through the floor.

I saw her arm reaching up from the ground, and even in the spirit world, the movement was so fast I barely had time to react, leaping backwards and pushing Cassara out of the way.

I watched Esmeralda’s hand miss me by a few hairs as I fell out of the spirit world and back to the real one.

I got back just in time to watch Esmeralda’s body whip out of the floor so fast, if I hadn’t just seen her in the floor, I wouldn’t have even been able to tell how she appeared.

Cassara reared back from my push, looking wide eyed at Esmeralda as she appeared out of the floor, her hand up, ready to do to one of us what she did to Reginald.

Cassara glared at Esmeralda and swung her fist.  

A wicked leathery wing appeared out of nowhere, the bony segment blocking Cassara’s flame covered fist.

Cassara’s eyes went wide as Esmeralda’s violet eyes shifted to Cassara, the rest of her remaining perfectly still.

“Did you expect me to be as weak as that one?” Esmeralda said, her head ticking towards Brittney.

Brittney, for her part, was sitting in the violet sigil, her hands held down by glowing violet chains.

I looked to Esmeralda, “What the fuck are you?!”

Esmeralda’s eyes now moved to me, and I was incredibly disturbed as they did, “The fact Brittney found the two of you so troublesome is beyond me,” she chortled, “I’m afraid you’re all rather doomed.  Once upon a time I was not just any Succubus, I was their Queen, chosen by the Prince of Flesh, Lord Belial,” she grinned, “But I have ascended from my lowly station then.  Now, I am a direct servant to the Daughter of the Mourning Star,” she grinned, “You face Esmeralda- Great Demon and Right Hand the of Daughter of Lucifer: Ragnarök Misho!”

“Her name is actually *Ragnarök*!?” Cassara laughed.

Esmeralda whipped her wing up, spreading it quickly as she grabbed Cassara’s face in her hand, “Do not laugh at the destroyer of all!” Esmeralda’s eyes narrowed as her purple eyes burned, smoke rising from her as she was consumed by rage.

Cassara struggled, attempting to punch Esmeralda’s forearm, she hammered Esmeralda with multiple swift strikes.  Each fist smashed down on Esmeralda’s arm with a powerful *thud*.

But Esmeralda didn’t move, her rage set on Cassara as she spoke through gritted teeth, “How *dare* you make a mockery of *my* **Mistress**!” Esmeralda’s other hand shook in anger as she hissed.

“The fuck did she do for you?!” Cassara shouted against Esmeralda's palm, “The succubus is clearly enslaved!  You sound like you love this cunt!”

Esmeralda’s dress shifted as a massive violet clubbed tail smashed to the floor, shaking the room as it did so.  “My **Mistress,”** Esmeralda’s voice echoed through the foyer as she said the word *Mistress*, “Pulled me from the flames of Hellfire, released me from my contract with her Father, in exchange for my unwavering support.  In return, she gave unto me legions of clandestine Valkyrie from which I may lay my own stake upon this world when it is destroyed and remade in *her* image!” 

Cassara kept trying to stall Esmeralda, her eyes moving to me for a moment before she continued, “Oh, you make her sound *so* benevolent!”

I took the hint and I closed my eyes, as I shifted my attention to the spirit world.  I started trying to move around Esmeralda.   Here, as I saw Esmeralda speaking, I heard her voice, perhaps her thoughts?  Or rather, the meaning behind the words, radiating around her.  I’m a hundred percent certain.  Lets just say, I could feel the intent of her words in their purest forms.

“She wishes for us to be benevolent?! HA! The *Men* were not benevolent to us, so why should we return the favor to them?  As much as Mistress Ragna has taken me in and given me power, the true reason I will forever love that woman, why I will follow her until the end of all creation, is I hate them!” Esmeralda’s voice growled.

I paused as I readied my wings.  I expected her to say ‘Mortals’ or ‘Humans’ but it seemed her ire was a bit more (or less?) generalized.

“Those **Men!”** Esmeralda roared.  

I could see the rage echoing out around her aura.  It was a hatred so pure, I could somehow smell it.  It smelled like roasting flesh and sulfur.  

“Those bastards who enslaved us!  Treated us like cattle or trinkets to be traded for favors of power!” Esmeralda’s aura roiled, “My *father* remitted me to the servitude of a duchess to pay off a Gambling debt!” 

Through all of this, Cassara stopped hitting Esmeralda in the physical world.  I could see her spirit was still strong, but she was listening to Esmeralda.

Esmeralda’s voice only grew in anger. “Yet they call *me* a monster for usurping the duchess and devouring the nobility in their own bed chambers?!”  

I froze, feeling strangely sympathetic.

“How many daughters were sacrificed in the name of a family’s good name?!  How many had to wed to horrid men of even more horrid upbringing all to trade land, money, riches?!” 

Esmeralda’s form seemed to grow, “Empress Ragna shall turn it all on its head!  The men will suffer every indignity, every stolen moment that our sisters faced!” Esmeralda’s anger began to mix with joy, and she laughed, “They’ll face it all!  Sold to honor their families!  Told whom to wed and how!  Demand them their physical labors for hours upon hours and never to find yourself compensated as the opposite sex!” 

I didn’t expect a demon to be a misandrist, but I guess that’s what Esmeralda, and perhaps Empress Ragna, was.

I let my feathers fly at Esmeralda, hoping they would cause some kind of damage.

One of them struck her shoulder.

Esmeralda let loose a scream which was echoed by a horrific roar as a blast of her chaotic aura spurt from where my wing had made contact with her.

She released Cassara, her form turning to me, her eyes wide in wrath.

“***You!”*** She roared in rage.

I flew into the air, as I did I saw Esmeralda didn’t follow me, but rather spun on her heel, sending her massive clubbed tail towards my body, where my soul was anchored.

As her clubbed tail smashed into my body, the blue aura around me vibrated.

I felt it deep inside of my heart, the vibration rushing through me, and as it hit me, I let something go.

It was like a reflex.  Like when you lash out after you’re pinched.

The blue tube that tethered me to my body burst like glass.

Shards of it flew through the air, some hitting the ground, others striking Esmeralda.

She screamed and roared in distress, the room shaking as I rushed back to my body.

I gasped as I turned to see Esmeralda’s shoulder bursting with violet steam as she grabbed at her eyes, smaller spurts of steam erupting here and there from her body.

Cassara took the opportunity and punched Esmeralda in her jaw.

In her weakened state, the hit knocked Esmeralda to the ground as she shook in pain.

I ran to Cassara, panting, my eyes wide and my heart in my throat.

Purple blood dripped from Esmeralda’s eyes as she looked at the two of us with a fixation of pure hatred.  Her eyes burned a hole through mine as she screamed, “What sort of little angel *are* you?!” Esmeralda demanded.

“Hey, you said he wasn’t an angel!” Brittney shouted out from her make-shift prison.

“He’s not a *full* angel!  Merely his spirit has some kind of angelic gift, but other than that he’s a perfectly average,” Esmeralda sneered, “perhaps *below* average mortal!”

.“That ‘Gift’ came from the Angel Sofia, the Sword of Samael,” I announced.

“The Sword of…” Esmeralda’s eyes widened in fear, “Brittney! To me!” 

Brittney’s bonds were broken and she flew to Esmeralda.

“Take us home!” Esmeralda shouted, “Our Mistress must be informed of what we have seen!”

Brittney nodded, her cloven hoof striking the floor as a yellow sigil burned around them. 

In an instant, the pair were gone.

I fell to my knees, looking at the chaos all around us.  

Desiccated corpses surrounded me, and I turned to see blood pooling still under Reginald’s barely cold corpse.

Cassara sank down in front of me, blocking my view, “It took a Greater fucking Demon to kill Reggie,” Cassara said, her hand on my shoulder, “Pretty sure he’s going to have the most bad-assed story in Heaven.”

I swallowed down my fear and concerns, “I should read him his last rites.”

“Yeah,” Cassara sighed, “And you can also tell me about this ‘*Sword of Samael*’ shit.”

I nodded, “Yeah, and you can explain the Valkyrie thing,” I said in exchange as I walked to Reginald’s heart, doing my best not to touch it or the blood.

I held my hands out of it, reading the last rites for him.  I pulled out one more bottle of Rum.

Before I did anything to it, I turned to Cassara, “You should probably have a drink before I fuck with another bottle.”

Cassara nodded and took the rum from me, grabbing the cork with her teeth and pulling it free.  She began to drink it, gulping down several large swings.

“Uh, I need some-” Before I could finish Cassara held up her finger as if to say ‘Just a sec’.

She finished, leaving only a fifth of the bottle remaining, offering it back to me, “That shit is fucking great.  No wonder everyone keeps trying to steal my fucking rum.”

I took the bottle, my eyes wide.  I shook my head, squeezing more sweat from my kerchief into the bottle, and blessed the rum again.

I splashed a small bit onto Reginald’s corpse, standing and heaving a sigh, “We should get out of here.”

“Yeah,” Cassara sighed, opening her phone to dial something.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“911 is the real emergency number in the states, right?” Cassara asked.

I nodded.

“Good,” Cassara paused as she heard someone on the line, “Yeah, hello?  There’s some kind of crazy shit happening over at…” Cassara gave the address to where we were at, after a few more identifiers, she hung up, “The cops should be here soon, and we should be gone sooner.”

I frowned, “Yeah, I have no idea how to explain what happened here,” I paused, “Or anything that I’ve been through since I ran into you.”

Cassara was about to say something.

But before she could, the door was kicked open and many officers and a few suits rushed in with guns drawn.

I put my hands up, staring in shock, “That was fast.”

One of the men with a suit walked over to us, his dark skin held two bright blue eyes as he came upon us, his accent African, “Detective Inspector Angelo, Interpol, Down on the ground, the both of you!”

…

After a few hours, we were outside near an ambulance.  

The EMTs had a blanket over me, and Cassara was fussing about hers.

“The only way you’re getting me under a blanket, sweetie, is after dinner!” Cassara growled.

The EMT rolled her eyes and walked away.

“Smooth,” I informed.

“Fuck off,” Cassara growled, crossing her arms. 

The Inspector approached me again, “Normally I would take you in,” he said rather simply, “However, this obviously is not a normal situation.”

“Yeah, no shit,” Cassara shouted.

“Detective, what are your thoughts on the matter?”  The Inspector asked someone.

To my left I heard a north-eastern accent chime in, “I’m thinkin’ these two were in the wrong place, wrong time.  Seen their sorta, yah know?”

I turned to see a man with dark brown hair, and rather bright blue eyes, walking towards me.  He wore the most stereotypical brown ‘Gum Shoe’ coat I had ever seen.  

Which made no sense, this was Florida.  It was hot, humid, and the absolute last place I could imagine someone wearing a trench-coat comfortably.  

“Uh, who the fuck are you?” I asked.

“Miller,” the Detective said, “Detective Miller.  We can leave it at that,” he looked to Cassara and then to me, “You two got more important places to be.  Beat it.”

I gave Det. Miller an odd look, and closed my eyes.

Standing before me, in the spirit world, was the exact opposite of Esmeralda.

Glowing throughout the area, as if he were a light-source, was Det. Miller.  However behind him, shimmering in a bright white and gold, were a pair of huge angelic wings. 

His blue eyes moved to mine, and I felt a sort of calmness overwhelm, “You have a mission, yeah mortal?”

I nodded dumbly.

“Then get off yer ass and get to it,” Detective Miller said as he snapped his fingers.

I opened my eyes, back in the real world, looking at Det. Miller.

“Did I shudder?” Det. Miller announced.  

I got to my feet, turning to Cassara.

Cassara looked at me oddly as she did the same, heading out. 

“What was that about?” Cassara asked.

“The Boston guy?  He was an Angel,” I said simply.

“Yeah, he was a real peach,” Cassara sighed, “But what… wait…”

“Yeah, no, a real actual Angel,” I said, turning to see Det. Miller was still waving us off before he turned to the Interpol Inspector, “I think they have everything covered from here.”

 Cassara shook her head, “Good.  Then we can talk about your little escapade with another angel, in the hotel room?”

I sighed, “Yeah, sure.  Wait, hotel room?”

“Yeah, and a decent one this time,” Cassara said as she laced her fingers behind her head and waltzed ahead of me, “So, spill it.”

…

As we walked, I told Cassara everything about the Guardian Temple Door that appeared in my room.  I told her about the challenge I had with Sofia.  How she held me hostage, telling me that if I couldn’t wrestle free of her grip that I would die.

That did lead to a possible theory about what happened to me when I ventured too far from my body.

Cassara heaved a sigh, “Astral projection’s a bitch I guess,” she turned to me, “So, you can see some kind of other world?  Can you interact with it?”

“Yeah,” I said with a heavy sigh.

“Do you have any insight into what Lydia was talking about?” Cassara asked.

“No,” I said with a heavy sigh, “I saw blue spirits around you, and red ones.  I don’t know what they mean.”

“Of course you wouldn’t,” Cassara sighed as we neared a small hotel which appeared mostly clean from the outside.

“How did you afford this place?” I asked, “Can’t buy this for $20,” I remarked.  

“I had my sister wire me some cash,” Cassara admitted.

“Your sister?” I frowned, “Can she be trusted?”

Cassara nodded, “Yes. I’ve saved her ass plenty of times, and it’s my money she wired me.  I just needed a way to get it so, you know,” she frowned, “Guessing you want to hear my side of things?  They’re far less dramatic.”

“This isn’t a competition,” I said as I looked up to Cassara, “But lay it on me.”

Cassara heaved a sigh, “I was found by a General of Penthasil, named Rhea. She raised me along with her blood daughter Launa,” she continued.

“So you’re not Penthasilian?” I asked.

“Penthasil is weird when it comes to citizenship,” Cassara explained, “You see, anyone who’s female can be a citizen if they either become a warrior, the Valkyrie, or someone who raises warrior’s kids, like the Hesties.”

“Valkyries are Norse,” I frowned, “How’d that get lumped into a Greek Amazon Village?”

“Penthasil is not a village,” Cassara rolled her eyes, “It’s a city-state smack-dab in the middle of the Darien Gap.  Where no one looks and no one lives,” Cassara admitted, “Sans us.  As for the mixing, Penthasil traces its roots back to the Trojan Wars.  After the war, the remaining Amazon Greeks left and searched for a new land.  They found one, with a rather friendly folk in North America.  For the most part, they didn’t do much sans farm, work, and so forth alongside the Natives… Then the Vikings showed up.”

I winced, “And there was a massacre?”

“Yeah,” Cassara grinned, “We kicked their asses… and uh…” Cassara winced, “Integrated some of the defeated Vikings.  Cultures mixed a bit but as the best warriors seemed to have Norse fathers, the name ‘Valkyrie’ stuck.”

“And a Hestie?  When we first met you said they were housewives,” I probed.

“Yeah,” Cassara admitted, “Like my sister.  To be fair, I feel bad I used the term in a negative way.  Hesties kind of hold the social fabric of Penthasil together, keeping the hearth and home.  They raise the kids of the Valkyrie, most of us are followers of Artemis, some Hera, a few nutjobs follow…” Cassara winced, “Well we don’t speak *her* name.”

I frowned, trying to think of what Goddess she could be mentioning, “Well… Adopted daughter must have been a tough gig regardless, right?”

“Nah,” Cassara admitted, “I felt worse for Launa.  She’s older than me but, well, she had the build of a Hestie.  Mom wasn’t pleased, but, well…” Cassara sighed heavily, “At least her adoptive daughter made a fantastic Valkyrie.”

“Sounds like there was some rivalry there,” I thought out loud as we walked into the, thankfully, air conditioned hotel lobby.

“Nah, Launa is the head of the House of Hestia.  She runs the whole thing,” Cassara chuckled as we walked down the hallway, “I’ve helped her here and there when there were physical altercations she couldn’t handle, but she still grew up under my mom, the Brigadier General, and with me as her little sister.  She’s tough,” Cassara smiled, “I miss her to be honest.  It was nice talking to her but, you know, obviously I couldn’t tell her where I was.”

“Yeah,” I said as we turned down the hallway, “Why didn’t she come with you?”

“She said she had to protect the House of Hestia, and the other Hesties.  I get it, they’re probably even more vulnerable now than they were before,” Cassara lamented, “But even still, I didn’t tell her where I was going, in case the Empress was listening in.  Bitch is… Crafty…” Cassara’s face fell as she looked down the hallway.

I turned to see a woman wearing a red flowing dress.  Over the red was a shawl of golden fabric, and a golden pin with ornate flowers holding ruby gems for the pedals.  Her face was pale, her hair long and white.

At least, I thought it was white, it had a tendency to shimmer as she turned to see us.

Cassara’s face was mixed in confusion and concern. 

I glanced at her, seeing her emotions stirred up.  She was in a panic of sorts, and had a mixture of her worry, and a bit of joy.

I turned to the woman before us.  

She stood near a hotel doorway which, oddly, I could see nothing emanating from.  The other doors I could see spirits and auras of people, but within this one, nothing.

The strange woman’s aura pulsed with a silvery hew, mixed with streaks of red and hints of violet.  

I opened my eyes as the woman, whose light hazel eyes were fixed on Cassara, spoke, “I have to say, I expected you to have some kind of company to help you along, but I did not expect to see a man by your side,” she said as she heaved a sigh, “So, it seems we need to have a heart to heart, Cassara.” 

I turned to Cassara, “S-Should I be on guard?”

“No,” Cassara said as she crossed her arms under her bust, “David, this is the Head of the House of Hestia of Penthasil, my sister,” she cracked a half smile, “Launa.”

Launa nodded to the two of us, “Pleasure to meet you, David.”

“Uh, same?” I said, unsure how to greet her, “Uh, your sister is a tough cookie.”

Launa chuckled as she looked at Cassara, “I’m well aware.”

“Nice of you to drop by, but,” Cassara’s face fell, “I do have at least two questions.”

“Why am I here, and how did I know where you were?” Launa asked preemptively. 

Cassara nodded.

“I’m here because this seemed to be the sort of place you would want to stay and that was within your budget,” Launa said, “Also I lied to the front desk, gave your name, and said I was your sister.  So they gave me your room number.”

“Right,” Cassara said, almost dreading the next answer, “and the second bit?”

“I am here, Cass,” Launa said with a heavy sigh, “To try and convince you to return home of your own free [will](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/).”
