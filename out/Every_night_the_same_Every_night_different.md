As I turn over and look at the time, it takes my eyes a moment to adjust. Not that they need to. I already know what time it is. 3:38. Every night. Without fail. It’s a miracle I ever manage to fall asleep in the first place. In truth, the only reason I’m able to fall asleep at all is an unhealthy mixture of wine and muscle relaxers. Not ideal, as it also means my reactions are slowed, time moves strangely, and my heartbeat is already erratic.

I know what’s coming. The slow whisper I hear ushers in a new night of horror.

I’m not a brave person. I’m not like the heroines in the movies. I don’t move. I don’t get up, cry out, ask why this is happening. Instead, I do what I always do. I screw my eyes shut tight, like a child. I begin to sweat and the comforter over me is both too hot, too clammy and not enough. All at once.

The scraping and whispers always come first. But what comes next is always different. I don’t know why. I think it knows that the unknown fuels the dread. The sweat.

The whispers are childlike. But too full of burgeoning intent to be a child. The words crawl up my spine and the back of my neck. The croaking sounds engulfing my scalp in freezing flames.

“I’m cold”

I ignore the voice. I pretend not to hear. It doesn’t help.

I flinch as the whispers move to my ear. Creeping through, cold ivy weaving into my consciousness.
“I’m cold”.

The edges of the comforter tug. I try to squeeze it between my knees to keep hold of it.

The comforter slowly lifts over my feet. Ragged breath that’s able to cause my skin to prickle and twitch. Like maggots have been dropped onto my feet from that rancid, rotting mouth.

The comforter drops again.

I feel a weight drop itself onto the edge of the bed.
This is new.

It’s becoming bolder, braver. It consumes my dread, drawing strength from every bead of sweat currently running down my back.

My breath stops. Why isn’t the thing moving? It’s still there on the bed. I can feel the soft indent where it sits next to my back. It’s behind me, watching and breathing with a sound like dry leaves being dragged along tarmac.

I feel its weight shift. I feel the mattress sag even closer to the small of my back. My face is aching from having my eyelids crushed together and my teeth gritted so hard my jaw feels like a vice.

“I’m cold”

Another tug

And then another sound. One I haven’t heard before. Unlike the arid, dry whisper, this is a gurgling, bubbling sound. Like the last gasp of air as a bottle sinks into cement. Thick, cloying and utterly putrid.
I feel a chill of air as the comforter is lifted behind my back. The weight shifts again. Another monstrous gurgle.

I cannot move. I feel panic clutch at my heart.

3:47

The weight lifts. My heart threatens to pound itself out of my chest entirely.

The paralysis slowly retreats and I lay in my sweat drenched sheets until I am no longer imprisoned in my own body.

I just want an end to this nightmare. To escape from the incessant torture. I will not be driven out of my home, though. I’d never find another property with a walk in freezer
