The last time I committed suicide was... well, it’s hard to say anymore. Maybe it was minutes ago, maybe days, maybe years. Time doesn’t seem to work the same here. I remember the act—the razor, the blood, the coldness—but I never died. At least, not in the way I expected.



I didn’t feel relief, or an end to pain. There wasn’t some flash of my life before my eyes. It was just like everything collapsed into silence and stillness. And then, I woke up, not in the living world but here. A place that feels like limbo. 



Everything’s muted, hazy. People exist, but they don’t seem to notice me. It’s like I’m here, but not really \*here\*. I can move through spaces, walk among crowds, but no one looks my way. I can scream, cry, lash out, but I don’t think they can hear me. I’m just a shadow to them. Or maybe they’re the shadows, drifting in a world that I don’t belong to anymore. I certainly don’t remember much of my life before this... limbo. It’s like trying to grasp at fog—pieces slipping through my fingers before I can even understand what they are.



I’ve been stuck here, struggling to adjust, haunted by this relentless, suffocating emptiness. But it’s not just the silence. There’s something else. A presence. A \*figure\*.



It follows me, always. A black figure, darker than shadows, darker than night itself. It has no face, no features, just a silhouette of pure darkness, like it’s carved out of the absence of light. I first noticed it not long after I arrived in this place. I thought it was a trick of my mind, something my brain made up to cope with the strange new reality. But it’s real. It’s always there, watching, lurking, waiting.



It doesn’t speak, doesn’t move much, but I feel it. It’s like it knows everything about me, even the parts I’ve forgotten or tried to erase. And its presence... it’s not passive. It’s active, tormenting, gnawing at my mind. Every time I think I’ve gotten used to this place, that I can handle the endless gray, the figure does something to remind me that I’m not in control. That I’m trapped, powerless.



It shows me things—horrors that defy all sense. Things that no human mind should have to witness. They aren’t just visions. They’re experiences, so vivid and real that I can smell the rot, feel the unbearable pain, hear the screams of things that aren’t human, things that shouldn’t exist.



Once, I was forced to watch an endless parade of disfigured bodies writhing in agony, their eyes wide open, their mouths locked in silent screams. They were begging for mercy, but none came. The figure stood beside me, unmoving, as if it were drinking in the suffering like some kind of perverse joy. Another time, I found myself trapped in a room that kept shrinking, the walls closing in, the air growing thinner until I could barely breathe. But the figure? It never blinked, never shifted. It just stood there, as if it were testing me, breaking me, piece by piece.



I don’t sleep here. I don’t eat. I don’t need to. But I still feel pain. I feel fear. And the figure knows that. It thrives on it.



I’ve tried to escape, to find some way out of this limbo. But every path leads me back to the same places—gray streets, empty rooms, unfamiliar faces who don’t know I exist. And always, always, that figure is there. Watching. Waiting. 



There’s no way out. At least, not for me.



Once, I stumbled upon a mirror in an old, forgotten building. The kind with dusty windows and peeling walls, where time seems to have stopped. I looked into the mirror, desperate to see myself, to remember who I was before all this. But what stared back wasn’t me.



The figure was there, inside the mirror, standing right behind me. Its darkness oozed from the glass, seeping out into the room like an ink blot spreading over the surface of my reality. I couldn’t move, couldn’t scream. I could only watch as it crept closer and closer until it consumed everything, even my reflection. When I blinked, I was standing alone again, the mirror cracked and broken. I haven’t dared look into another one since.



Maybe I’ve been dead all along. Maybe this is hell, or some kind of purgatory. Maybe the figure is some twisted version of myself, the parts I’ve buried, the darkness I carried with me in life. I don’t know anymore. What I do know is that there’s no point in fighting it. It won’t leave me. It’s my shadow, my tormentor.



The worst came not long ago—or maybe it was a long time ago. I can’t tell. I was walking through the empty streets, trying to clear my head, though there’s no real escape here. The buildings loomed over me, oppressive and cold, like a city built on nothing but despair. I turned a corner, and there it was—something I hadn’t seen before. A small room, tucked away between two towering structures, the kind of place you wouldn’t notice unless you were looking for it.



I don’t know why, but I was drawn to it. Inside, the room was dimly lit, filled with a suffocating silence. And in the center of the room, I saw it—\*him\*.



A man. He looked as lost as I felt, his face twisted in confusion and fear. But what horrified me wasn’t him. It was the figure, standing behind him, its darkness swallowing the light. The man didn’t see it. He couldn’t. But I could. And I knew what was about to happen.



The figure raised one of its shadowy hands, and with a slow, deliberate motion, it placed it on the man’s shoulder. I watched in frozen terror as the man’s expression shifted, his fear turning into something darker, something primal. His body convulsed, his eyes widening in panic, and then... there was silence.



The man collapsed, lifeless, crumpling to the ground like a puppet whose strings had been cut. The figure turned to face me, its empty gaze boring into my soul. I realized then what it wanted.



It had been toying with me, breaking me down, torturing me, because it knew that eventually, I would understand. I would accept my fate. 



And I did. Watching that man die, I finally understood. This was my reality now. The figure wasn’t just a tormentor. It was my shadow, my constant companion, my curse. I had become part of this cycle, this endless loop of suffering and death. 



I wasn’t human anymore. I hadn’t been for a long time.



I’m still haunted by the thought of who I used to be. Was I a good person? Did I deserve this? Or was this some form of twisted justice? The memories of my life before are still just out of reach, but it doesn’t matter anymore. I know what I am now.



I’ve been through enough pain, enough terror, to know that there’s no escaping it. But there’s something else I’ve come to realize. Something darker.



I’m not the only one trapped here. There are others, just like the man in the room. Lost souls, wandering this gray, forgotten place, waiting for the figure to come for them. I’ve seen them, drifting through the streets, their eyes hollow, their faces blank. They don’t know what’s coming. 



But I do.



I watch them now, from the shadows. I follow them, just like the figure followed me. It’s not out of malice. It’s just the way things are. The figure taught me that. I’ve learned how to live with it, how to endure the horrors, how to embrace the darkness. 



And now, it’s my turn to pass it on.



I certainly wasn’t a monster, or maybe I was. But Nietzsche was right: *look into the abyss, and the abyss stares back at you\** 



I have been tormented for quite a while now, but I’ve gotten the hang of it. The fear, the suffering—it’s familiar now, comforting in its own way. 



And soon, it’ll be someone else’s turn.
