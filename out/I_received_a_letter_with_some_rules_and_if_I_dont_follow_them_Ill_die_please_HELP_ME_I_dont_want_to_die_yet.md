I have always been a bit naïve. I cried at ghost stories, tried to forget superstitions, and always believed in luck and other magical forces, so you’ll have to excuse me if I made any questionable choices, thank you.    
  
It all began when that accursed letter arrived at my doorstep.   
  
The envelope was plain and unremarkable, bearing no return address. Inside, I found a single sheet of aged paper, its edges yellowed with time. The writing was also very odd; I had never seen those characters before, yet I could understand everything.   
   
"David," it began, "You have been chosen to play a dangerous game, one that defies all reason. Your life depends on following these rules:   
  
**-Never look back. Once you start, there is no turning around.**   
  
**-Always trust your instincts. They are your only guide.**   
  
**-Avoid mirrors after sunset. Reflections can be deceiving.**   
  
**-Whisper your deepest fear to the wind at midnight. It may offer protection.**   
  
**-Beware the clock that strikes thirteen. It is not what it seems.**   
  
**-Keep the door to your past locked. Do not let it open.**   
  
**-Embrace the darkness but fear the shadows. They are watching.**   
  
**-Never speak the name of the one who waits in the attic. He listens."**   


  
I stared at the letter, a cold sweat forming on my brow.   
  
I knew immediately it wasn’t a joke, mainly because I don’t know anyone who would do that, or anyone at all on that matter...   
  
I tried to calm down. “Ok, this apartment complex isn’t very big, but there is still a considerable amount of people who live here, surely a serial killer would never try to kill me in front everybody, right?”   
  
I ignored every response my brain had to that statement, and that seemed to relax me a bit.    
  
I immediately took my phone, ready to call the police, but then I suddenly stopped. Wasn’t I overreacting? What if it was just a kid’s prank. Calling the police just for that could even result in ME being arrested if the officer was in a bad mood.   
  
So, I thought to myself “Well, it’s impossible this guy will kill me on the first day! He spent so much time making this look so old and doing some kind of optical illusion with the letters, it would be such a waste to kill me immediately.”   
  
I again ignored every single warning from the voice in my head, except one: there is a camera installed in every hallway. The landlord bought them last year, after someone’s apartment was broken into, and the owner was able to make him pay for all the stolen stuff. I would’ve asked him for the videos after I got home for work, possibly before midnight, when I assume the recordings are deleted.   
  
It was morning and I was already running late for my job, so I quickly drank my coffee and grabbed the keys. I was about to close the door when I remembered about the weird letter; writing the rules down or taking a photo of it was probably a good idea. But as soon as I was about to turn around, chills went down my spine.   
  
Didn’t one of the rules say something about turning around? Was it meant as physically or like metaphorically? Well, it surely couldn’t mean physically, since I turned around a lot of times that morning, mostly without thinking. Maybe it meant that I can't turn around to change what I've already done? As in this case to take back the letter I left there. What an asshole killer, these rules are too vague.   
  
“Snap out of it, David, how did you jump from an old letter to a serial killer watching all your movements in 5 minutes?! This letter is probably from your boss who just found out how far behind you are with work... Now close the door and rush to the car!”   
  
Wasn’t “trusting your guts” one of the rules? Maybe this was the right call after all. With some difficulty I managed to close the door without turning back, then I walked moderately fast (so I didn’t look like a creep) to my secondhand car.   
  
Again, why would this Saw-wannabe target me out of every person in the complex, I don’t understand, but driving helped me cool off a bit.   
  
I got to the office, said hello to my coworkers and got to work right away. I was three weeks behind schedule, I didn’t have time to waste behind this stupid threat. If I lost my job over THAT, the killer should have been afraid of me.   
  
The morning passed quickly, and it was now lunchbreak. I kept working for a part of it, but then hunger won over responsibility. That dumb letter made me forget my lunch, so I just bought one of those disgusting and probably cancerous sandwiches from the vending machine. There was a half-broken clock beside it.   
  
“Huh, it’s almost 13. Only 20 minutes until I can prove this whole thing is fake haha”   
  
I laughed but I wasn’t really amused.    
  
Since I didn’t have anyone to talk to, I just stood there and waited. Until it happened.   
  
An otherworldly chime resonated through the whole room. My heart skipped a beat as I realized it was coming from the clock in front of me.   
  
The clock's hands moved in erratic, unpredictable patterns, and its face bore the number thirteen, standing starkly against the fractured timepiece.   
  
Mesmerized by its surreal presence, I drew closer to the clock. Its ticking was out of sync with reality, a discordant symphony that seemed to distort the fabric of time itself. I reached out, hesitantly, and touched the clock's face, only to find that it was cool to the touch, like a living entity.   
  
As my fingers made contact, the room’s walls began to ripple, the very fabric and vinyl morphing into liquid-like patterns. I was pulled into a whirlpool of time and space, spiraling through a kaleidoscope of memories, dreams, and fragments of forgotten thoughts.   
  
I found himself in a place beyond reason, where the laws of physics surrendered to the surreal. Clocks floated in the air, each striking thirteen in unison, creating a cacophonous symphony of distorted time. I tried to move, but gravity itself had become a capricious force, pulling me in every direction at once.   
  
Amidst this chaotic dreamscape, I encountered faces and figures from my past, people long gone, and perhaps those I had never met. They whispered cryptic messages, half-formed riddles, and secrets lost to the depths of my subconscious. The very concept of past and future blurred into a perplexing present.   
  
I realized that I had stepped into a realm where time itself had unraveled, and the clock that struck thirteen was the guardian of this bewildering reality. It was neither friend nor foe but a sentinel of the surreal, beckoning me to unlock the mysteries hidden in the fractured continuum of existence.   
  
Then the clock signed 13:01, and everything went back to normal.    
  
I stood there, paralyzed in front of the vending machine, not sure if what I experience really happened or if it was just my imagination.     
  
One thing I know for sure, I’m never eating one of those sandwiches ever again.   


  
  
As I’m writing this, it’s currently 1:30 pm, and I’ve decided this has somewhat a priority over my work, but I promise I'll get back to it as soon as I post this.   
  
I think I forgot a rule, though I don’t feel like I’ve broken one yet, and if my gut says so then I’m probably right.   
  
I've read that Reddit users are very smart, so i wonder if you could help in any way? Comment any tip you think could help me survive, and I’ll try to follow it.    
  
Thank you in advance guys!!
