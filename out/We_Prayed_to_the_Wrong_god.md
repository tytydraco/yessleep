I present these journals to you as a warning. There are churches that are indistinguishable from your Christian churches. Well, until you get to the inner circle. They pray to neither Yahweh nor Jesus even though they say they do. They pray to someone whose name I can never write. A god who loves to make himself known but because of forces even beyond him it is quite difficult for him to do so. A god who can give those he loves whatever he wants but only those he loves.

This isn’t a conspiracy of how elites secretly serve him or how he sits in the background dictating every move. This is an account of how he’s ruined my life.

Forgive my arrogance in the following journal entries; pride before the fall and all that.

Welcome, losers. 

Today’s a big day for me and you. For you, this is the start of how you get everything you want in life by reading my memoirs. And for me, this is the day I start my first and hopefully last romantic relationship with a certain beautiful girl named Kay McKenzie. I won’t go into too much detail about her because I’m sure you’ve heard of her because I’m sure by the time you read this I’ll be famous and so will she ( she’ll be married to me, duh).

Anyway, here’s the most important thing for you to know about the universe. This will change your life and make my memoir sell out. Read this slowly. Come close. I’ll whisper this to you. The first commandment is the most overlooked; you shall have no other gods before me. It implies there are other gods and oh, boy does he love proving he’s real. I’m not a fan of Him, for reasons you’ll learn later, but you might be. There are two ways we know with one hundred percent certainty he’s real.

So, this one’s more like a party trick. If we try to say our god's name on camera something will happen and the name is never heard. This can be as simple as the camera losing audio for one second or a deer wailing like it’s been stabbed in the background to cover up the sound. I’ve heard both. If we try to write it we get similar effects; laptops shut down, ink spills, or the pencil lead splits and leaps right into the eye of the writer. I’ve seen it all.

Now, here’s what he does that’s beyond a party trick. He’s what I ( to the anger of my friends) call a coupon honoring god. That means if you believe Yahweh or whoever did a miracle -any miracle-  and go into one of my god’s temples and tell him you have faith that Yahweh did it and state that you have faith that he can do the same, he’ll do it just like that. You can be healed from cancer, legs growing back, and people being raised from the dead. I’ve seen it all.

Where are these churches you ask? Everywhere really. You wouldn’t spot a difference on the outside or inside on an average Sunday service. Only once you reach the inner circle is the true nature of the church revealed to you. There are some megachurches, mid-sized churches, and struggling small churches. The small churches believe they are small because they teach the true Word and thus attract fewer people and they disdain the bigger churches. The big churches don’t think about the small churches until they need to give them money because they’re dying. I’ll let you decide who’s the better church. I know many of you are asking why would a church ever be poor if you could simply ask god for whatever you want. Well, we’ll get to that later.

I’ll give you a list of churches in the back of this book and you can either attend them and ask god for whatever or start a new holy war. Not my problem. I don’t care either way as long as you paid for this book which pays for my retirement.

Now let me tell you about my god and my girl because they’re intertwined in this religion of mine.

When I was thirteen, about four years ago, we had a special ceremony with our youth group. All of our youth group were driven by van to one of the temples. The churches are easy to find but the temples -where the real power is- they’re hard to find. This one was out in a cornfield, isolated and alone. It was not a grand thing and was closer in appearance to a shack in the woods than a grand cathedral. Cows grazed in the grass in front of it. Oh, cows those poor, poor cows. I’ll never look at them the same again.

We exited the bus to go to the temple in a silent single file line; talking without permission was an offense that resulted in physical punishment. We shivered in the rough wind and the cold drizzle of rain. Most of us kept our heads down to avoid the gaze of the high cornstalks. Silence was demanded but fear was allowed so our single-file scurried and shook all the way to the temple.

“Be seated,” Sharon our youth group leader told us and went away to who knows where. We did as we were commanded. She did not tell us to be silent but we understood.

 The wind beat on the tinted windows as if it was demanding to come in. It shook the whole poorly made temple. The red carpet that lined the auditorium danced in front of my eyes. If we looked at it too long we would swear it was not solid, but a thick liquid, too thick for blood. The wooden pews groaned at any movement we would dare make. Many a kid has been beaten because their bench groaned too loud.

So we sat in corpse-like silence and forced stillness that made my heart race around my chest until Sharon finally returned.

Sharon came from the back of the sanctuary and held the hand of some kid a couple of years younger than us, maybe nine. I did not like Sharon. Everything about her screamed fake and uptight.  Her static platinum hair and pink nails were too fake. Her clothes were tight and even as a child, I wondered why she dressed like that to teach youth group. I’ve seen the average youth group leader you guys have for church and no she did not look like that. I’m not sure why she wanted to be a youth group leader. I don’t even think she liked kids. Oh, well maybe that’s why. You’ll see what I mean.

Anyway, Sharon escorted the small child between the two pews where we sat. As she walked in, the benches quieted their groans and the wind eased its assault against the door to more of a polite and creepy knock. The carpet still looked swimmable.

“Today, we get to feed god,” Sharon said and smiled with a perky demeanor foreign to her.  We all shifted in our seats and tried not to appear afraid. We forgot food. How could we feed our god without food? We forgot to bring food and this would make god mad, our parents mad, and Sharon mad. Most of us weren’t stupid, so we knew not to admit our flaws. Instead we spoke to each other in hand signals and concerned looks to determine if anyone brought any food we could split. No one was stupid enough to admit we forgot to bring food.

Except this one girl in the front row who audibly yelped. We all turned to her. 

“Mrs. Sharon,” the girl said. “Sorry, I mean Ms.” the girl corrected mid-stutter. She was shivering maybe out of nerves and maybe out of fear or maybe she was still recovering from the elements outside.  

Ms. Sharon’s smile was as hard as stone. She hated being reminded she was unmarried.

Honestly, I think the girl was too oblivious to realize it. She went on stammering all the way through. Her hands moved up and down as she spoke like the most frazzled symphony conductor ever. “I’m sorry I forgot to bring food. I will do better next time. I always write stuff like this in my planner and I must have forgotten this time. I don’t normally do this. You know I’m a good student.”

“Ms. McKenzie,” Sharon said, stone-smile unbent. “I didn’t tell you to bring food because I have it.”

A great fire leaped from the altar at the end of the hall. The altar of our god stood about nine feet tall. He had the head of a bull, the sculpted arms of an Olympian, and a furnace that served as a stomach and that furnace roared now. We all sat in our seats and our eyes avoided the fire. You’ve probably never been in the presence of real supernatural power.

You feel the need to hide from it and are haunted by an evil insignificance. Maybe you’ve felt insignificant looking at stars. It dawns on you that you are small compared to the universe but I bet you embraced that, I bet it made you want to see all there was of life. I bet you took risks. I bet you traveled. 

Well, I call this evil insignificance because it does the opposite. This power made me want to end life’s search. There was too much power and too many things that were beyond me. I wanted to stay in this seat hidden and scared and never have to face the uncertainty of life again. My heart fled, my head danced, and my mouth went dry. We were supposed to be silent but I heard myself panting.

Sharon did not mind it. She walked forward. Her heels did not clack against the carpet but instead made a sploshing sound as if she walked on a puddle. She dragged the kid behind her.

“Oh no, no, no,” I thought but didn’t dare say. The kid was the food. I know the kid was drugged. He had to be. Anyone with any survival instincts would have ran from her. She strode forward with confidence. Perhaps, this is why she wanted to work with kids. Perhaps this was her reward. She got to feel all of our god’s presence and not want to shrivel away like we wanted to. 

All I could think was, ‘No, no, no,’ the closer they got. I didn’t want to watch this but I didn’t want to be next. So, I had to sit there and I was supposed to keep my eyes open but I couldn’t manage that.

I’m sorry I’m a coward but I covered my eyes. It didn’t feel right to see. That wasn’t enough though. My eyes couldn’t close tight enough, bright orange light crept in them.  I squeezed with every muscle in my body and they couldn’t go tighter. Pain swarmed in the middle of my head because of the effort. Then came his screams once he was in the fire.

He was so confused. I heard a ‘what’ in there and so many cries for help. I opened my eyes to see if she would. She kicked him with her heel and he was pushed back into the flames. Then she laughed. Then they all laughed. And I felt sick because I didn’t know what was funny.

I didn’t know the kid which meant he wasn’t part of the inner circle of the church. So, we were told not to care about him or his safety.  And that hurt me, for the past few months, I was having physical aches of pain at what I witnessed we did to unbelievers. It created a deep numbness within me for all things except me. How could I love my god or my people who would do such a thing?

The other kids did not feel this way. I can’t blame them I guess, it worked out for them. They laughed and laughed and made fun of how he wiggled in the flames. They marveled at how you could see his skeleton. They mocked how loud he got and they mocked his eventual silence.

And then the flame went out. And there was quiet. 

Except for one person’s sniffles. Sniffles that soon grew into tears. Something that was frowned upon. Why should we pity something that was our god’s will? 

The nervous girl from the front cried. She viciously wiped away tears from her face because she knew her tears were heinous, her empathy evil. She understood her own punishment would be coming. The other kids stared at her. That’s what I hated the most. They didn’t have the shame to turn away from her. No, they stared because they genuinely could not understand why she was crying. Or they had the sick desire to enjoy her upcoming punishment. 

The girl could have saved herself from this punishment she maybe could have avoided it if she pretended that her tears were about anything else. But she kept saying; “I’m sorry. I don’t mean… it’s just they were so young.”

As Sharon walked now the world felt the weight of her steps. I felt it again. Again, I had to be a hopeless, spectator to an ugly-stomach turning spectacle. Sharon’s heels clacked against the ground resolute to deliver a punishment.

That girl was Kay McKenzie and that’s the moment I knew I loved her. I grew numb because of this world we lived in.  She didn’t. I fell in love with the girl because she cared even when she wasn’t supposed to.

 Kay is a small girl and her two front teeth are big, like mine.  And she talks too much ( in the opinion of everyone but me) and they say the same about me. And she gets depressed sometimes but won’t tell anybody because (like me) that’s not her role in life. We’re here to make people laugh and we would never burden anyone else with what makes us sad.

Like me she has a hard time expressing herself to people she’s not close to. Which is the saddest of tragedies for them and my saving grace because if she did they’d be hopelessly in love with her like me. 

That is the wonderful heart of Kay McKenzie.

“Shut up!” Sharon said and her hand groped at her side as if she prepared to give a wicked strike. This wouldn’t be that strange for us, our parents signed a permission slip that said we could be disciplined as they saw fit.

Sharon didn’t strike Kay though. Sharon held back.

*Drip. Drip. Drip.*

My eyes left Kay and went up to the ceiling where a strange salty liquid dripped from the church. It crashed to the floor filling the room with the smell of salt.

“Stop crying!” Sharon said.

Kay scrunched up her face and still tears escaped her.

*Plop. Plop. Plop.*

The saltwater expanded and fell from the church in head-sized drops bursting, spreading, shooting out like BB-gun bullets. We took cover behind the pews to avoid the stinging of the water.

"Please," Sharon said—no, begged. Something I'd never heard her do.

Kay couldn't stop.

The dripping from the sky stopped, sort of.

*Floosh!*

Behind me, an evil miracle happened: a waterfall fell from the church onto a girl named Monica Peters. Monica collapsed under the weight of the water. Her body was bombarded by an impossible force, but her face remained untouched.

I ran to help her.

Sputtering and crying, she crawled forward in my direction to escape it.

Dropping to the floor, I reached out my hand to help her, careful not to let the water hit me.

As the saying goes, miracles happen once in a while when you believe, but this miracle wouldn't let Monica Peters leave.



Doubling force, then tripling, water from hell fell from above and ripped away her skin, then flesh, then meat from her bones, until I watched her life leave her eyes. Perhaps her spirit journeyed wherever the water came from.

All eyes fell on Kay. Hoping she was done crying and blaming her for Monica's death.

But who could stop crying under the weight of all that guilt?

"Please, forgive me," she said, damning us with her tears the whole time.

*Moooo*

Cows?

*Moooooooo*

Have you ever heard a cow screech? It is not a pleasant sound.

*Crack. Crack. Crack.*

Outside something was breaking—maybe sticks, maybe bones—we didn't know. We stood statue-still, preparing to run if we needed to.

The door from the back of the church burst open. Piling in were cows crying and stretched into impossible positions by our god's will. They ran like humans and cried like only animals can cry—a perfect innocence born from being punished for a reason beyond their comprehension.



Us kids were a lot like animals then, punished for something, by something that went beyond our reason. Hooves hit heads in the chaos. Blood painted the church. The trampling of bodies sent my classmates to meet Monica in the afterlife. Kay stood there, maybe her guilt wanted her to die. My childish crush wanted her to live. I tackled her and pushed her under the pews.



Moos and "I want my mommy's" choired through the church, and I hoped our god was happy with it, his evil praise, because I promised if I lived I would never worship him.



Silence fell. Fresh grass and blood mixed in the musty smell of the church. I rose from my hiding place to see the chaos. Dead. All of my classmates and even the cows lay dead and broken for no good reason except a god got upset a girl had empathy.



Only Sharon, myself, and Kay lived from that horrible day.



That was years ago. Kay and I will start dating tomorrow and then marry within the year. That's her—that's the girl I'd go to Hell for. We will leave this god together, and I'll give her a life of peace where her empathy won't be punished.
