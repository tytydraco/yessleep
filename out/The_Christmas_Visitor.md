— ⚠️Gore Warning ⚠️—



It started as a perfect Christmas Eve. Snow drifted lazily outside, coating the ground in pristine white. Inside, the lights of our tree blinked in cheerful, multicolored patterns, casting warm shadows on the walls. My parents were upstairs, wrapping presents
—or so they said.

I was alone on the couch, a mug of hot cocoa in my hands, watching some old holiday movie. Everything was still and quiet, the kind of peaceful you only get once a year. Then came the knock.

It wasn't a normal knock. It was heavy, deliberate, and far too loud for someone politely seeking attention. It rattled the door in its frame, sending a shiver down my spine. I froze, staring toward the entrance.

Knock…

Knock…

Knock…

"Mom… Dad?" I called, my voice trembling slightly. No answer.

I tiptoed to the door, peering through the peephole. Nothing. Just the porch and the snow, untouched and glistening. No footprints. No sign of life.

I was about to walk away when the knock came again, harder this time, like someone slamming a fist-or something worse— against the wood.

"Who's there?" I shouted.

No reply.

My heart pounded as I unlocked the door and cracked it open. A blast of icy wind hit my face, but no one stood outside. Only a small red gift box rested on the snow-dusted welcome mat.

It was wrapped in shiny paper, topped with a golden bow. No name. No note. Just sitting there. The snow around it was undisturbed, no tracks leading to or from the porch.

Against my better judgment, I brought it inside.
The box was light, almost too light, but as l moved it, something inside shifted with a sickening wet squelch. I gagged slightly but set it down on the coffee table. The room suddenly felt colder, the tree lights dimming as if the power was faltering.

I stared at the box for what felt like hours.
The wet sound haunted me. It wasn't the soft rustle of tissue paper or the clink of an ornament. It sounded... organic.

Finally, I couldn't resist. I tugged at the ribbon, my fingers shaking, and tore the paper off.
The smell hit me first.
It was like copper and rot, thick and cloying. My stomach churned, but I forced myself to open the plain white box inside.

I wish I hadn't.

Inside was a lump of flesh, raw and glistening, oozing dark red onto the cardboard. At first, I couldn't make sense of it. Then I realized it wasn't just flesh—it was a hand.

Tiny, delicate, and severed at the wrist.

A child's hand.

I dropped the box, bile rising in my throat.
The severed hand hit the floor with a wet plop, and the dim glow of the Christmas tree lights reflected off its jagged bones.

That's when the lights went out entirely.
I stumbled backward, tripping over the coffee table, landing hard on the carpet.

The room was pitch black, except for the faint orange glow of the dying embers in the fireplace. And in that dim light, I saw something move.

It was in the corner of the room, tall and hunched. Its red cloak was tattered and filthy, dripping with something thick and black. The smell of rot intensified as it stepped closer, dragging something heavy behind it.

The jingling of bells broke the silence, but they weren't cheerful. They clanged discordantly, out of rhythm, like the dying wheeze of a broken music box.

Then I saw its face-or what was left of it.
The skin was pale and stretched too tightly over a skull-like frame. Its mouth hung open in a grotesque grin, jagged yellow teeth glistening with strands of something viscous. The eyes were sunken pits, glowing faintly red, locking onto me with predatory hunger.

Its hands were the worst. Long, bony fingers ending in jagged claws, slick with fresh blood.

"You've been naughty," it rasped, its voice wet and guttural, like meat grinding in a butcher's shop.

I scrambled backward, my hands slipping on the carpet. My foot hit the box, and the child's severed hand rolled out, bumping against my ankle.

The thing lunged. Its claws raked across my shoulder, tearing through skin and muscle like paper. Blood sprayed, hot and sticky, painting the floor and the Christmas tree. I screamed, but the sound was drowned out by those horrible, jangling bells.

It dragged me by my ankle, its claws sinking deep into my flesh. I kicked and clawed at the carpet, but it was no use. It hauled me toward the fireplace, its rancid breath hot against my neck.

"Please! Stop!" I begged, sobbing.

It didn't listen.

With one swift motion, it shoved me toward the fire. My head slammed into the brick mantle, and everything went dark.

When I woke up, it was Christmas morning.

The house was silent, the fire burned low, and the lights on the tree blinked cheerfully again.

My parents were gone.

And on the tree, hanging from a
bloodstained branch, was a new ornament.
A perfect replica of me.

Its tiny face frozen in a scream, and its glassy eyes filled with terror.
