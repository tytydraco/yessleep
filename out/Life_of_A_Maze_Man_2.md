The job finished pretty quickly; it was basically a straight shot to the spot. I lucked out and got to be the mule that day, carrying the supplies, though it always does a number on my back when I gotta do it. 



Pretty fast we identified the spot. We used a simple paper map to get there, sketchily drawn but always accurate. Always what we use to find where in the maze we are going to continue from, stuff like that. 



It's really rare that this type of situation comes around, so you’d think they’d let us use the digital maps they got, but they don’t. As a matter of fact I'm sure there are better ways than string and painted rocks to use as markers, too, I mean can’t we just do it all digitally?



That’s beside the point. Being the mule meant I was at the back of the pack. Meaning my chances of kickin’ it were the lowest. Still round fifty percent, but right on the dot, rather than being fifty five or fifty six percent. Leader's also a surprisingly safe spot to be in, it’s the guys in the middle that got it rough. 



Either way, it’s about half of the group that makes it out every time.  This time, it was just me.



It was a quiet day. People were just taking it slow, trying so hard not to run into the dead end. We do get a little detector thingy to help us find it, similar to a radiation detector, but not quite. It’d be nice if we always got to use it: normally we go in with a bunch of rigged junk as I said before. Even the food and drink they give us is garbage, although at least that part is to be expected.



Thing is though, that little device never changed its tone; its paced beeps and boops remained the same.  We just knew where the spot was because everyone but me started freaking out all of a sudden. Screaming all sorts of profanities, ones that I don’t even think are real words. 



I just watched as they held their heads and fell to their knees. Their howls kinda morphed into one. The guy closest to me passed out first. Well, that's a light way to put it. He died. When his hands fell from his ears, and his body hit the ground with a thump, his brains started to leak out of his head.



His came out easy, like water splashin’ out of a spilled cup. And it was the most painless too, cause he died before it started happenin’. 



There was one dude in the dead center of the pack who let go of his head, laid on the ground panting like a dog in pain. All the sudden, his face got tense and red, slowly shifting to purple. His brains came out his ears real slow, like he was pushing out a hard brick of shit. Dropped in little pellets.



Some other guys had their heads squished by something unseen. It was like watchin’ a kid make spaghetti outta “Play-Doh” with one of those kitchen set toys. Like an invisible press turned their round heads into flat pancakes, but with long squiggles of shit coming out each side. That was a new one for sure! 



Normally the leader has the markers and the string. So I had to carefully step up the line to get the blue rock to mark the dead end. As I moved forward things calmed. Screams silenced, and brains stopped flowing out their heads. I almost slipped in a little pile of one guy's brains. Surprisingly not as gross as stepping in dog poop. 



I got to the leader and searched around in his little satchel bag. He was dead, but his eyes were open, and they focused right on me. I don’t know why, but I gave a little wave.  After I did the necessary steps of marking the dead end, I turned around and just started walking. But I could have sworn the leader’s eyes followed me. All the way back down to the entrance of the maze. 



I spoke to the suits and scientists hanging around the camp near the entrance. It's always the protocol to give a mission report. During said report, they just nodded their heads, wrote stuff, and occasionally gave a concerned glance at each other. All my words sounded kinda muffled to myself as I spoke. 



After that I just came home, back to my little apartment. The door was unlocked and ajar. Definitely not how I left it but I didn’t give a shit. I was too tired. I just climbed into my loft and slept for a good day straight.  



I went to Lar’s the next day, or I guess the next night. Woke up around 19:00. Everything kinda tasted duller than usual, The chicks didn’t really get me going (although do they really ever?), and my drinks didn’t get me drunk. Something felt off about everything; well, more so than usual I suppose. 



I ran into Jose. He came up behind me and gave me a hefty smack on the back. Didn’t think someone so small could be so strong.



“Hey! You remember me?” He asked, he had this big ol’ grin on his face. His teeth were pretty gnarly. Never noticed that before.



“Yeah man,” I gave him a little nod. “I sure as hell do.”



That was a partial lie. I remembered his name after he corrected me, but I couldn’t really remember much else. I’ve spent so much time locking that maze stuff out of my mind, it’s done numbers on my memory. All I remembered, he was Jose, not Joshua, and that I worked in a group with him one day, and that was about it. 



“So, did you guys find it? You know the-” 



“Jose, of course I know what we was tryna’ find!” I paused, and lowered my voice to a less irritated tone. “And yes we found it. It wasn’t what I expected though.”



He grabbed the stool next to me.



“What do you mean? You didn’t see God?” He laughed.



“There was no invisible dead end.” I stated. 



“What? That can’t be right.” 



I leaned in.



“Seemed all the suits and shit felt the same. I got a bad feelin’ ‘bout all this.” 



We ended up having a few more drinks together. Thankfully those started hitting me. We talked a little more about things outside of work and strayed away from being coworkers in one night. It was nice and it got my mind off things for a moment. 



We left the bar together, Jose managed to snag one of the girls. Good on him I guess, and the three of us drunkenly stumbled down the roads towards the apartments, eventually parting ways.



My apartment door was unlocked again, slightly ajar. I just went in. Drunk me had a little more hesitation than tired me. But either way I entered. I didn’t really have anywhere else to go anyway. 



Heading to bed I quickly passed out. Maybe for an hour or two, when I heard something moving around in my room. 



Wiping the drool from my cheek onto my pillow I sat up, head hurting a little. Glancing down off my loft there was nothing. So I just flopped back down onto my mattress and stared at the ceiling. 



It was quiet, a little moonlight peeking through the curtain on my window, creating a calm I hadn’t felt in a while. There was always the stress of the assignment slip, the looming fear of death every time you go to work, every time you step into that maze. 



I thought for a moment about the brains on my shoe. Just staring at it stuck between some cracks in the soles of my boots. I stared indifferently at that moment. But I wonder how I really feel about all of this. All the things I see, the last words I collect. 



But whatever, that's lame stuff to think about. So I shut my eyes and turned off my brain. And right before I was about to fall asleep, I heard more movement, this time a soft metal thud on the ladder up to my loft. I opened my eyes and lifted my head and glanced towards my feet, where the ladder was.



Staring at me was a man. His face was lit up by the thin line of moonlight coming through. He was bald, his head and face so smooth it almost looked like plastic. He and I locked eyes with each other for a good minute. There were no words spoken, no other sounds, just silence.



I moved and that's when he did, too. He jumped down from the ladder and quickly ran off. His bare feet tapped rapidly on the fake wood floor of my apartment as he scurried towards the door.



I quickly slid down the ladder, but he was gone. There was no trace of him, not at all. If he was still in my apartment, I would know. This place is the size of a closet. A little spider can barely hide in my place, sure as hell a human wouldn’t be able to. But the thing is, I never heard the door open or close. Only thing that told me he left was the fact I couldn’t find him anywhere.



The next few days came and went. We were all working more than usual. I don’t think I had a day off until today.



Some very odd things have been happening inside the maze since, and outside it too.



Jose has gone missing, so has the chick from Lar’s. They aren’t in their apartment, can’t be found at work. Nothing. Just vanished. Maybe he and the lady ran off, fell deeply in love and couldn’t be separated again. That's some Shakespeare bullshit though, and I am pretty sure once the alcohol wore off, Jose would very quickly fall out of love. 



Also, that bald dude keeps showing up at my apartment, every night. It’s the same game over and over; he watches me, his little plastic head peaking into the loft from the ladder. I move, and he runs. 



Inside the maze, things have moved around. Sometimes a spot that was a dead end now is fine, and spots that were supposed to be fine, are now dead ends. We have to keep cutting up strings, placing new rocks and moving old ones. It’s a pain in the ass. And the amount of Maze Men we are losing compared to before…



But either way, it's clear things are getting strange. I can’t really wrap my head around it all. The best I can do right now is keep writing, try to gather my thoughts. Keep writing, and keep working. Just keep doing my job.
