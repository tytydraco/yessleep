I’m currently hiding in my closet. She’s banging on the windows. I don’t know when they will break, and how long it’ll take her to find me. There is no signal. Hope this gets out to someone. 

Please. 

Anyone. 

Help me.

First, an introduction. My name is Kein Stevens, 21 years old, brought up in the States. I‘ve been working and living in Singapore starting this year, as a teacher at a neighbourhood Secondary School.

In Singapore, the school term begins at the start of the year. New classes and new lesson timings are allocated to all lecturers, and lessons are typically conducted in lecture halls. 

It started off as a typical day. I check my timetable, grab my things and head off to class. Today’s first block was at Lecture Hall 1, and after a few minutes of wandering around trying to find my destination, I finally arrived. However, the door was locked.

The doors wasn’t simply locked, though. The handles were chained up and secured with multiple padlocks. There was a “DO NOT ENTER” sign pasted on the crusty paint near the entrance.

I double-checked my timetable. The words “Lecture Hall 1” was printed in bold on the piece of paper.

*(Oh, how I wish I would have just turned back right then. I wouldn’t have ended up in this situation)*

I shrugged it off as an elaborate prank by the students. After all, this school isn’t exactly known for its disciplined pupils, and the principle has warned me against often-occurring pranks.

The padlock was pretty easy to deal with -- it fell as soon as I touched, or attempted to touch, the handles. Pushing open the heavy doors, I realised that the hall was filled to the brim with people. Needless to say, I was fairly surprised, because truancy was a frequent occurrence in this school.

My lesson started like it would. I wouldn’t bore you with the details, since they are unimportant in this story. One notable thing though, was that instead of wearing sneakers or literally any other usual modern shoes, one girl had those silkish ones. 

They were bright red, decorated with delicate traditional Chinese embroidery. I was captivated in a way that I didn’t understand: it almost felt as if my consciousness was sucked away, and my body was levitating in the air. I never felt so at peace in my whole life.

Then, the dismissal bell rang. I snapped out of my daze, only to find the hall empty. I was beyond bewilderment. How did a class of people just vanish into thin air?

Nevertheless, I decided to report the female student to the Discipline Mistress, “hey, just wanted to let you know that theres a girl in Lecture Hall 1, she was wearing-”

“We don’t have a Lecture Hall 1, Mr Stevens, ” she interrupted, looking extremely concerned, “perhaps you’ve remembered wrong?”

“Wait…huh? What do you mean? I have been teaching there for the whole one hour.” 

Her face drained of colour, and stated firmly, “Kein, I’ll need you to go home right now. Shut all your windows and lock your doors. I’ll write up a report for you, the school would understand your absence.”

I had just opened my mouth to object, but was silenced by her intense stare. Shrugging, I obliged.

*(Now thinking back, going home was the worst thing I could have done)*

I spent the whole of the afternoon scrolling through Reddit, binge watching movies on Netflix and relaxing. Well, if someone of higher rank offers you a day off, you take it to the best of your advantage.

As soon as the sky darkened, there came a knock.

I knew for sure that I would not have any visitors at this hour. Before opening the door, I took a look through the peephole. Nobody was there.

A few more knocks came. Behind my back.

The muscle in my jaws tightened, hairs on my back stood on end as I turned. The girl from class earlier stood before me. Wearing those exact same shoes. Those fricking silky red shoes.

She mumbled something that sounded like Chinese, but of course I could not understand what she said. She proceeded to bang on the windows with all her might, as I fled to my bedroom, hiding in the closet. 

Even though there had been a language barrier, but I understood her intentions perfectly. She wanted me, to kill me, so she could bind my soul to hers for eternity. I do not know how I have offended her in any way. However she seems intent on making me her prey.

She has broken the windows and is inside the house now. I’m very afraid. She’ll find me soon. I can hear her calling my name, coaxing me to come out. I’m trying to resist her calls, but it’s getting more difficult by the minute.

Please, whoever sees this. Help me. I don’t want to die.
