I woke up this morning to find my phone lying on my nightstand, exactly where I’d left it. But something was off—the screen was on, the camera roll open.

At first, I thought I’d accidentally unlocked it in my sleep. But as I scrolled through the photos, my stomach dropped.

There were five new pictures.

I didn’t take them.

The first photo was of me, asleep in my bed.

It was dimly lit, the glow of my phone’s screen casting faint shadows across the room. I could see myself lying there, my mouth slightly open, my hand dangling off the edge of the bed. The angle was all wrong.

Someone had taken this photo while I was sleeping.

I felt a chill creep up my spine, but I told myself it had to be some kind of accident—a glitch, maybe. I swiped to the second photo, hoping for an explanation.

This one was closer.

A close-up of my face, just inches away. My eyes were shut, but the rest of the photo sent a jolt of fear through me. Behind me, in the reflection of the mirror on my dresser, there was a shadow.

It wasn’t a clear figure, but it was there—something dark, humanoid, but warped and wrong.

I dropped the phone on my bed, my hands trembling. My heart was pounding as I sat there, staring at the screen.

It had to be a prank, I thought. Someone hacked my phone or broke in during the night.

I checked every door and window. They were all locked from the inside. Nothing was out of place.

I wanted to call the police, but what could I say? That my phone took pictures of me while I was asleep? I tried to brush it off as some bizarre glitch, but deep down, I knew better.

I waited until morning to look at the rest.

The third photo made my blood run cold. It was taken from the hallway outside my bedroom. The door was slightly ajar, and through the gap, I could see myself lying in bed.

But this time, the reflection in the glass frame on the wall showed a shadowy figure standing in the room.

It was tall, unnaturally so, with a head that tilted sharply to one side.

I stared at the image, trying to process what I was seeing. There was no way someone could’ve been in my house without me hearing them.

Unless they still were.

The fourth photo was worse.

It was me again, still asleep. But now, the shadow wasn’t in the reflection. It was standing right next to my bed.

The face was blurred, but its outline was clear—an impossibly long figure looming over me.

I couldn’t breathe. My skin prickled as if something were watching me. I clutched the phone, dreading what the last photo might show.

With trembling hands, I swiped to the fifth image.

It wasn’t of me.

It was a screenshot of my phone’s home screen.

The clock read 3:00 a.m., the battery at 67%—exactly as it was at that moment.

Before I could process it, the screen went black.

Then I heard it: the faint click of a camera shutter.

From somewhere inside the room.
