Okay, let me explain. So I'm a college student, I'm not going to say my college here as it's pretty small and that would basically dox me. 

I woke up in the middle of the night, really needing to piss. I turned on my light to try and find my shoes because well, dirty college bathroom floor, but nothing happened when I flicked the switch besides a small spark. That sucked. Another thing for maintenance to fix, because my heater has been broken literally all semester.

It was only when I opened my door and found that *all* the lights were off. Here I assumed that the power got switched off. Wouldn't shock me, since this college is kinda shit.

I heard a voice in my room ask, "What are you doing?" 

In all my infinite wisdom, I slammed the door and hissed, "What the hell are *you* doing?!" Inflammatory? Maybe. But in my defense, I didn't know who the hell this was. My roommate left a while back, and this didn't sound like her.

She told me to sit down, go back to bed. I didn't really follow her instructions at first, instead opting to look around and try to find her. I couldn't see her anywhere, though.

She introduced herself as Lucy Furanage, and said her pronouns were she/they. I gave her my own name and pronouns, and finally sat my ass down. She told me that the world was ending eventually, that everyone was going to be dying soon. She said I'd be the last person alive, so I better cherish the fact that she's giving me life.

Honestly, she sounded extremely convincing. Convincing enough for me to start believing her. The thought of the world ending scared the shit out of me. I thought that was gonna be the last time I could do anything, really. All my hobbies, friends, family... They were all gone, and all that was left was Lucy. It made me want to cry and scream, you know? Grief and fear don't mix well.

I still couldn't see her, but I felt her put something in my hand. 

And then the lights flickered back on, and she was gone. First I looked down at the item I had been given. It was a weird photograph of a woman in her early 20's or so. On the back, "REMEMBER ME, PLEASE - LUCY F." was written.

I then looked EVERYWHERE for her. She was just... Straight-up gone. I went and pissed, and then went around and asked some of the other girls in my hall about it. Apparently, they saw and heard nothing during the power outage and didn't recognize the girl in the photo.

I'm going to go ask some of my professors about it in the morning, then maybe administration. I'm scared shitless and I can't stop thinking, but I'll be brave about it. If the world is really ending, how long do I have? Why was I chosen as the only person with this knowledge? When will it happen? She never even told me!

I don't know what else to do, honestly. Nobody knows anything about this, but I know it happened. The only piece of proof I have is the damn photograph.
