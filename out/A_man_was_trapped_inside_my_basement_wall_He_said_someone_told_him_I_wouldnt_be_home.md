It had only been two weeks since I moved into my new house.
I never thought I’d have enough money for a cute little home with a garden like this, but luck was finally on my side, and lately, I’d been earning well. The house wasn’t big, two small rooms, a tiny kitchen, and an even smaller bathroom, which meant the washing machine had to go in the basement, where I set up a little laundry area. It wasn’t much, but it was mine.
The neighborhood was quiet too, with friendly neighbors. Most people around here had families, but even in that short time, I’d gotten along with everyone. I thought nothing could ruin this idyllic little life I had carved out for myself.

That is, until the day I went down to the laundry room with a basket of dirty clothes.
As I made my way down the stairs, something felt… off.
There was something hanging from the narrow wall between the shelves, something I didn’t register at first. When I turned on the light and stepped closer, I finally realized what it was.

A hand.
A human hand was sticking out of the wall.
Only up to just before the wrist, it dangled lifelessly. A man’s hand. It looked as if someone had been sealed inside the wall. Cold sweat broke out all over me.
What the hell was this? There was nothing there yesterday! Was this some kind of sick joke?
Should I call the police? What was I supposed to do?
I panicked silently, until the hand suddenly moved. As if it sensed I was pacing back and forth.

It waved at me, flailing, like someone drowning, begging to be pulled out. Without thinking, I grabbed it and started pulling. It didn’t budge. Like it really was part of the wall. The hand started twitching violently, signaling me to stop yanking.


“Are you okay?” I asked, not even knowing if I was talking to the wall or the hand.


The hand just kept waving, maybe trying to say “no.”

What was I supposed to do? How could I help someone who was somehow trapped inside my wall?
Then I had an idea. I ran back upstairs and grabbed a pen and a notepad. I pressed the pen into the hand, then held the paper out in front of it.


“Are you okay? How can I help you?” I asked again, louder this time, just in case the person inside could hear me.


The hand started writing. Almost immediately.


"Help," it wrote.


I was pacing up and down in the basement. What the hell was I supposed to do?
I called the fire department, hoping maybe they could help, but they hung up as soon as I told them there was a man’s hand sticking out of my wall.
I was an idiot…Maybe I should’ve made something up just to get them to come.
Whatever. I’d handle this myself, just like I handled getting this house in the first place.

I went back upstairs. I knew there had to be a hammer and chisel somewhere. The house wasn’t fully furnished yet, and the kitchen still needed some renovation, so it was hard to find anything. But eventually, I found my tools.

I rushed back down to the basement with them, and that’s when I got the next surprise.
The hand was sticking out more than before. I could now see all the way up to the man’s bicep. And a little farther down the wall, just barely poking out, were the tips of another hand’s fingers.
Two hands now. Both coming out of the wall.

I was shocked for a moment, but then quickly grabbed the tools and started chiseling around the first arm.
The hands twisted in agony. They writhed like a worm cut in half. It was a horrifying sight.
I immediately stopped and handed the paper to the hand again.


"Are you okay? Did it hurt when I started breaking the wall? I just thought it might help you get out faster..."


The hand began writing again, slowly, shakily, the letters barely legible.


"Yes. Please don’t. Let’s just wait."


I didn’t know if I could trust him, but I agreed. Who was this man, and how did he end up inside my wall? Some kind of experiment? What the hell was going on?


I brought down a chair for myself. Sat there, waiting, staring at the wall, or more precisely, at the man inside it.

That’s when I noticed something near the bottom of the wall. A few toes were sticking out. My wall looked like someone was trying to walk out of it, just very, very slowly.
What the hell was happening here?
I gave up on the idea of calling for help. No one would believe me anyway. I’d deal with this on my own, whatever it was.


"What’s your name? Who are you?" I asked, getting up from the chair.


The hand started writing on the paper again:


"My name’s Jack. I don’t know how I ended up here. I was just walking home from work."


I eyed the hand suspiciously again. This was all too weird. How did Jack get here? And how was he even alive with most of his body trapped inside a wall?
But there wasn’t much I could do for him. Anything I tried just caused him unbearable pain, and I couldn’t help him get out any faster.

I was starving by then, and I had spent nearly the whole morning down there, so I ran out to grab food from the nearby diner. I rushed faster than I ever had in my life. I didn’t want to miss what might happen next with Jack and the wall.
All I could think was: please, let everything be the same when I get back.

But when I returned, I got another horrifying surprise.
His right arm was out all the way to the shoulder. The left arm hung only to the middle of the forearm. His left leg was sticking out up to the knee, like he’d taken a step forward, but it was crooked and jerky, like it had glitched halfway out of the wall. Only the foot of his right leg had emerged.

My wall looked utterly grotesque, like something from a disturbing museum exhibit.


I ate my lunch down in the basement. I didn’t want to miss a single moment. But whenever I was there, Jack barely moved. His hands twitched from time to time, his legs shifted occasionally, but he didn’t come any further out of the wall.


"Jack… are you even human?" I asked after a long silence.


Jack’s hands began writing again. At least by now, he could hold the notepad himself.


"Of course I’m human! I don’t know what the hell happened. I just want to go home, goddammit."


I felt a bit sorry for the guy. How the hell could he end up in a situation like this? Did someone do this to him? Or was it… something else?

Watching the wall was getting pretty dull. Time crawled by slowly.

That’s when my doorbell rang. Someone was at my door.
I hurried upstairs, hoping, somehow, that it might be connected to Jack. Maybe someone had come with an explanation. But it was just my neighbor.
He invited me to a backyard party for the weekend. He and his wife were hosting a little cookout with a kiddie pool, and they were inviting the other neighbors. As the new guy on the block, I was welcome too.

The thought crossed my mind to mention Jack in the basement. But as soon as I was about to say something, I realized it was better to keep my mouth shut.
Not exactly the best first impression to say
“Oh, by the way, I’ve got a half-naked man coming out of my basement wall.”
I’d sound like a lunatic. Or a killer. Or both. So I just accepted the invitation and said I’d bring something as a gift.

As soon as the neighbor left, I rushed back downstairs. And thank God I hadn’t said a word about Jack.

His right arm was still only visible up to the shoulder, but the left was now out to the top of the elbow. His left leg was fully free, and the right had emerged up to mid-thigh. His hips were beginning to show through the wall, and yes, so was his penis.

I was completely shocked. A naked man was crawling out of my basement wall.
What the actual fuck was going on?


No matter how hard I tried to stay in the basement all afternoon, there were things that eventually forced me to go upstairs. One of them was a bathroom break. But I tried to take care of everything all at once. After using the toilet, I quickly made myself some dinner, and of course, in my rush, I managed to cut my finger.
So I had to deal with that too. But at least… it gave me an idea.

I brought water and dinner down with me. And, embarrassing as it is, I also brought a bucket. To, you know… do my business in. I was worried Jack might come through while I wasn’t there.

I also brought down a pair of pants. They were the same old ones I used when painting the house. Now I figured Jack could wear them, since his lower half was already fully exposed,
and staring at a naked man wasn’t exactly comfortable.

Once I had all that sorted, I followed through on my idea. I had brought the kitchen knife with me, the one I’d used to slice tomatoes for dinner. I wanted to check if Jack was really human.
I grabbed his right hand and gently cut into it with the knife.I didn’t go deep, if he was just a regular guy, I didn’t want to seriously hurt him.
But there was no blood. Not a drop came out of his skin.


“Jack? What the hell are you?”


I backed away from the body sticking out of my wall.
Jack just flailed his arms. He scrawled something on the paper:


“I’m human. I haven’t hurt anyone. I don’t deserve this.”


I didn’t know who, or what, to believe. But one thing was clear: the knife was staying with me. And I wasn’t taking my eyes off him.


Unfortunately, the bucket turned out to be a bad idea. By evening, I had to use it twice.
Because of that, the basement started to stink pretty badly. It wasn’t exactly pleasant to sit around in that kind of smell.
I ran upstairs, emptied the bucket, and used the toilet again. I did it as fast as I could. But even so, when I came back down, I was shocked.

Jack was almost completely out of the wall.
Only his shoulders and everything above them, his neck and entire head, were still stuck inside.
The old paint-stained pants I had put on him had slipped off, because Jack was shorter and slimmer than me. So once again, he stood there completely naked, like some twisted mannequin.
The sight always horrified me whenever I came downstairs. I quickly pulled the pants back up on him, at least to cover his lower half.

And once again, the doubts began to gnaw at me.
Jack looked like a completely normal man. True, I still hadn’t seen his face, but his body looked like that of an average man in his thirties.
Still, the suspicion lingered: Why didn’t he bleed? How did he get into my wall?

I decided I wouldn’t go back upstairs for a while. I was going to stay there, really wait until Jack came out of the wall.
The evening dragged on. It got harder and harder to stay awake. I didn’t even want to move from my chair, I just stared at the headless body hanging from my wall.
Until sleep finally overtook me.

I woke up with a start, like someone who’d overslept and missed their alarm.
But what really shocked me…Jack was gone.
There was no body hanging from the wall. And worse, the basement door was wide open.


I climbed up from the basement cautiously. 
I held the knife in front of me, gripping it tightly. Whatever this was, if Jack tried to attack me, I would defend myself.

But nothing like that happened.
The hallway was empty. The bathroom seemed empty too. It was in the kitchen where the surprise awaited me.

A bald man was standing by the window in my half-finished kitchen.
He was looking out, his back turned to me. He was wearing the paint-stained pants. It was Jack.


“I see you made it out, Jack,” I said to him, still gripping the knife tightly, ready to strike.


Jack didn’t answer. He just kept staring out the window, looking into my backyard with his back to me.


“If you need help, we can call someone. Or… I don’t know,” I continued, still trying to sound diplomatic.


“They told me no one would be here,” Jack said suddenly. His voice was calm, kind, and polite.


“What do you mean?” I asked, confused.


“I’m sorry,” Jack said emotionlessly. “No one can know where I came from.”


Then, without warning, Jack turned around, and grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter.

I just stood there, stunned, because Jack had no face. His head was just a smooth, pale surface, no features, no mouth, no eyes. Like a freshly painted wall.

I barely managed to dodge when I snapped out of it. Jack charged at me again.
But this time, I didn’t just stand there, I swung my knife and slashed his arm.
It cut in, but it was like he didn’t even feel it. There was no blood. Not a single drop.
Still, Jack didn’t hold back either. As my knife was lodged in his arm, he grabbed his own knife and stabbed me in the side.
I let out a scream of pain. But this thing, it didn’t stop.
He ripped the knife out of my side and came at me again. I tried to defend myself, with mixed success.
He slashed my face, deep, from my eye to just above my ear. When I lifted my arm to protect myself, he stabbed into that instead.
I screamed again and pushed him away with all my strength. Jack pulled the knife out of my arm, and then slashed me across the stomach, lengthwise.

At that point, I was bleeding from almost everywhere. I realized I had to run,somehow.
Jack wasn’t human. Shoving him, punching him, stabbing him, it didn’t do anything.

I tried to get out of the house, but the stabbing made it hard to move. I collapsed between the kitchen counter and the sink.
Jack stood over me. That strange, faceless head stared right at me. His body was covered in blood, my blood.

I thought it was over. This thing was going to kill me.
Then I heard someone knocking at the door.


“Neighbor? Are you okay? What’s all that yelling? Do you need help?” It was a man’s voice.


The neighbor who’d invited me to the garden party. I silently thanked whatever powers existed that he heard me screaming.
But Jack didn’t wait. He plunged the knife into me again.
I tried to fight back, but the strength behind that blow was inhuman. He stabbed me in the gut. I screamed again.
And that’s when the neighbor broke down the door.
Jack, like a thief caught in the act, ran.

Just before I passed out, I saw him crash through the glass door to the backyard and sprint away into the night.

Then everything went black.


The doctors said I was incredibly lucky. If my neighbor had found me just a little later, or hadn’t called the ambulance right away, I would have bled to death right there.

I didn’t tell the police anything. I said the attacker was wearing a mask, that I couldn’t see who it was. It was better this way. They never would have believed me, that a faceless man who climbed out of my basement wall had stabbed me.

I thought a lot about what Jack said while I was recovering, I had plenty of time. It took me over half a year to recover from my injuries.

Who told Jack that no one would be in that house? And where did he even come from?
I had a lot of questions.

But one thing I was sure of: if Jack ever came back… or if someone else ever came into our world through my wall…I wouldn’t be so useless next time.
I wouldn’t be caught off guard again.
