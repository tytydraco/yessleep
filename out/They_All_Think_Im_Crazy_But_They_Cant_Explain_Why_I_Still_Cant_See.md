We left from our small Montana town to the mountains at nine that morning, we were supposed to be back to our respective homes that night at around ten the next day. Before we left, I kissed my wife and son goodbye. Little did I know, that would be the last time I actually saw them. 

We arrived to the range at around eleven, pulling on our gloves to combat the biting cold that nipped at our finger tips. We prepared our guns and took off to the cabin that rested in the woods. It was in this large clearing, and to the extents of our knowledge, no one used it besides us. 

The hunting trip went along smoothly, until I stumbled upon some strange items pinned to a shut door of the cabin- a door I did not remember. For a while, everything was normal and we were able to continue our hunting trip, but that’s when the rain came. 

I’m a man who enjoys the little things of my life, and rain had always been one of those things. But that rain, that rain was different. It seemed to close in on us, the cold hands of the cursed mother growing colder and colder by the hour. 

We decided to end our trip early, our rations were oddly low and we were afraid of the rain worsening and leaving us unable to leave. Once we were around half way down the mountain, it started to snow. Not the peaceful type of snow, where it casts a thin white layer over everything and smothers the landscape in peace, it was the kind that drowned out everything and left us squinting to find the road. It was the kind that left everything tinted a strangely ominous blue. And it didn’t take long for that snow to turn into hail.

Once we reached what I initially thought to be the highway, my 98 Honda civic hit a patch of ice and spun out. When I finally came to, I blinked and shuddered. My finger tips were dark blue and I could see red splattered on my windshield. Slowly, I turned to the source of the discoloration and my eyes focused. My best friend since elementary school was sitting besides me, but his head was gushing blood and his body wasn’t… his. I don’t know how to describe it. He just didn’t look like himself, his eye- the one that wasn’t entirely covered in blood- was a light blue, while I knew for a fact they were brown. I turned once again, looking over my shoulder to the back seat. The sight was repeated to me, this time with the other close friend I’d brought on our trip.

Panicking, not thinking clearly, I swung the car door open and fell face first into the snow. I couldn’t catch myself properly, unable to feel my fingers. I stood back up, my teeth shuddering as I did so. I started to run, as best as my frozen limbs could. 

Suddenly, I heard a strange breathy noise and spun on my heel. I knew someone had to have been following close behind me, yet I didn’t see anyone. I looked down, and I could see the footsteps in the snow. But the steps left behind weren’t human. They were misshapen and it didn’t seem as though whatever it was had been wearing shoes. 

I don’t know how long I ran, but there came a point where I physically couldn’t any longer and collapsed in the snow. But as I did, I heard disembodied screaming, the voices seemed to swirl around my head, I heard the voices of the friends I’d came up to the mountain with. 

“ELI! ELIASSEN, WAKE UP!”

The screams grew louder as I heard the breathing again. I felt a hand reach out and grab my own blue one, claws digging into my flesh. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t keep running from my own end. 

Suddenly, all I could see was a blindingly bright white light.



I later found out I’d been severely injured when my gun chamber ruptured soon after we arrived at the cabin and my life returned to being relatively normal once I was healed from my injuries. I’d like to say that the strange events that I endured in were all just figments of my imagination that my brain had conjured up to cope, but I know they weren’t. I know because my fingers are still blue and my eyes are still blind.
