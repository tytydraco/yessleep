“Yo, what is in this weed?” 

“Dude, it’s ditchweed.”

“I don’t know man, I’m seeing shit over here.” I was looking at the mirror, I was frowning but my reflection was smiling, staring straight into my eyes.

“Oh my - is this gonna be like the carnival? That clown was minding his own business, you were the one trippin out.”

“Dude, something’s wrong!” My reflection had now turned its face toward my friend, still smiling, impossibly wide.

“Shit. Did you take something? Eric, you know you can’t handle-“

“Shut up! Shut up! This is too weird!” I ran from the house to my bike outside. 

All the way on the ride home I avoided looking at my reflection in passing windows. I waited for a day before checking again. 

It was the same every time. My reflection would grin and stare, no matter what I did. If I was ever around other people my reflection tended to stare at them instead. 

This went on for three months. My therapist said I was hallucinating, gave me medication. It never stopped.

Yesterday I went to visit my Grandpa in the home. I hate that mom put him there. I hate that I can’t afford to take him out and take care of him myself. 

He’s always been my most trusted confidant, so he’s aware of my situation. He asks the nurse to cover all the mirrors in his room when I come to visit, which is twice a week. Even so I can’t help catching glimpses of my own reflection, in windows and whatnot. Before I walked in the door I saw it in the window, but for the first time in months it wasn’t smiling. I did a double take just to be sure, and sure enough, this time my reflection was frowning. My stomach dropped. The me in the window slowly shook his head as I reached for the doorbell. I decided to ignore it and jammed the button three times, my hand shaking. 

When the door finally opened I risked one more look. My reflection looked . . . furious.

I didn’t mention what had happened to my Grandpa during our visit. I needed to process. All through our visit I avoided the thought in the back of my mind, that I had ignored a warning. 

When I was leaving his room I heard a faint call for help, coming from a room across the hall. I scanned the hallway for a nurse before going to see what the problem was, thinking maybe someone had fallen down. 

When I entered the room the first thing I saw was a frail looking elderly man in a hospital bed connected to several beeping machines. He appeared to be sleeping. I was wondering if I had imagined what I heard when I noticed a full length mirror on the wall, directly across from the bed. In the reflection the man was sat straight up, smiling wide. He appeared to be staring at himself. 

I screamed, I couldn’t help it. It had never happened with someone else’s reflection before. The man on the bed was still sleeping, oblivious. When I worked up the courage to look again his reflection was now staring at me, grinning. That was my breaking point. As a 26 year old man I’m not ashamed to say I ran straight back to my grandpa’s room. 

“Is it Friday already?” My Grandpa looked amused, sitting in bed holding a newspaper. 

“Something happened.”

After I explained what had occurred my Grandpa slowly took off his glasses, his bemused expression replaced with a look of concern. 

“Son, I’m the only resident in this wing.”
