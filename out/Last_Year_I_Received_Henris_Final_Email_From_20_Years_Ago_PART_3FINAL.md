Whenever I saw Rosaline, she would tell me to “wait for the final piece of the puzzle” as if this whole ordeal was some sort of game. Two weeks of haunting nightmares later, on a cold morning, Big Jo came knocking on my door.

“Mrs Rosaline is calling for you, Sir,” he said with reverence. I was taken aback by his sudden change of character and  raised a brow.

“Are you feeling all right?” I asked.

A faint smile graced his face. “I’m not entirely sure that I *am*, Sir,” he replied. “Nevertheless, I would like you to follow me so that Mrs Rosaline can personally share the news with you.”

I jumped off my bed, feeling ten years younger. “The news?” I exclaimed. “You should’ve told me immediately! I’ve been waiting for nothing else for weeks!”

We hurried down the stairs into the living room where Rosaline was standing, wearing a beautiful black dress. The atmosphere felt more formal than usual. She motioned to a chair in front of her. I sat down, staring at the pile of documents and pictures next to her laptop.

“Dear, dear Caleb,” she said, almost tearing up. “Fate is a strange thing, isn’t it? If not fate, perhaps a Higher, mischievous Power planned this all along.”

“I’m afraid I’m a little lost…”

She turned on the laptop and showed me a bunch of data and a colorful map.

“Do you know what this is?” she asked.

I shook my head. She turned the laptop around. A few clicks later, she turned it back to me.

“Please, have another look,” she said. “What do you see now?”

“Well, there’s your name, and then there’s – er – mine… Really, I don’t th–”

That’s when it hit me. The numbers. The percentage.

“No… It can’t be…”

“I’m afraid it is, my dear Caleb,” she said. As she grabbed my hand she added, “My secret half-brother.”

My chair toppled over on the marble floor with a loud bang as I leaped to my feet. It was as if I’d been hit by a truck. I just couldn’t believe my ears. Big Jo promptly set the chair upright while Rosaline invited me to sit down again. But I was too shaken. I needed to calm my nerves first.

“I have thought long about your story,” she went on, “about what happened to my ancestors and the curse that follows the male heads of my – of *our* family. It made no sense that only you were affected when Jonathan and I had read the exact same mail from my late father. Which could mean only one thing.”

“No, it – it can’t be.”

She crossed her arms.

“Then tell me about *your* father.”

“He –” I hesitated, pacing through the large living room as I started to put two and two together. “My father died when I was a baby.”

“Do you have proof? A visit to his grave? Pictures?”

“I – no – I – I don’t recall ever going to his grave, now you mention it. My mother never spoke of him. And she’s passed away years ago.”

I felt lightheaded. I still had a hard time grasping all that had unraveled before me.

“Do you have any other siblings?”

“Not that I know of.”

I dabbed my brow with a handkerchief, soaking up the beads of sweat that had suddenly appeared. My entire life had been turned on its head. The unnerving ticks and tocks of the grandfather clock pounded inside my head, aggravating my headache.

“Can I –” I began but was immediately interrupted by Rosaline.

“And you met Hector – Henri at that time – on a website to learn English, correct?”

“Why, yes, but there was no way that –”

“Did *you* find *him,* or did *he* find you?”

I tried to recall the exact sequence of events that happened nearly three decades ago. “I – I don’t remember,” I finally admitted. “Maybe he found me.”

Rosaline exchanged a glance with Jonathan.

“Here’s what I believe happened.” She smiled, clasping hands together. I could barely concentrate on her words because of the reverbing beats of the clock. “My father – our father – had an affair with your mother. You were born – and he knew – but never tried to meet you to preserve the harmony of his own family. Years later, remorse must have driven him to contact you without arising suspicion from my mother. He looked you up, and, with the most incredible stroke of luck, found you on a pen pal website, where he interacted with you until his own demise.

“Haven’t you said yourself how strange it was he never wished to learn your language, Caleb? How he just taught you English and made you his confident, going as far as sending you pictures of his luxurious lifestyle? What kind of wealthy person does that? It makes no sense.”

My eyes were closed at that point. The ticking and tocking grew louder, but I seemed to be the only one able to hear them.

“Then, his final email arrived,” she continued. “Whether it was on purpose or because of the curse, I do not know. What I do know is that you began to feel the same effects as all our forefathers, a sudden attraction to that accursed cavern, hallucinations –”

“These aren’t hallucinations,” I blurted out in anger, crashing my fist in the grandfather glass panel of the clock.

“Caleb!” Rosaline shrieked.

I looked at her terrified face and felt something warm sliding on my hand. I knew what had happened before I turned my head towards the clock. Blood was flowing down my arm, a dark hue gradually expanded through my sleeve.

Jonathan rushed toward me, but before he came close, an outburst of rage like I’d never experienced in my life took over me. I yanked my hand out of the broken glass and struck the clock once, twice, trice, until I heard a loud crack. My first went through the dial and, strangely, I felt no pain.

I slowly retracted my hand, blood gashing all over the floor and my clothes, but stopped when I noticed something shining within the clock – something purple. I carefully inserted my trembling hand back inside and grabbed the object. As soon as it was in my grasps, everything turned white for a moment and a wave of relief washed over me.

“Caleb! Caleb!”

I snapped out of it. Rosaline and Big Jo had grave looks on their faces. I brought my hand in front of me and slowly unfurled my fingers. A jagged knife with a magnificent purple hue, made of glass or obsidian, rested in my palm. But something wasn’t right. It took me a few seconds to –

“My hand,” I muttered. “My wounds…”

All the blood was gone. I was completely healed.

“Blimey…” uttered Big Jo.

Rosaline was about to say something when the room shook.

**Thump.**

“What was that?” Rosaline stammered, frantically looking outside.

**Thump.**

Big Jo hesitantly walked to the window.

**Thump.**

He froze. The color in his face disappeared at once.

**Thump.**

Still facing the window, he slowly backed away.

**Thump. Thump. Thump.**

“What did you see?” Rosaline whispered.

“A – a – a monster.”

**THUMP.**

The outside went dark. Even the chandelier lights inside seemed dimmer than usual, as if a thick fog had penetrated within.

“Mrs. Rosaline, we must go,” Big Jo uttered. “We must hide in the basement.”

Then, a sudden ear-piercing shriek blasting every window, shattering them. Glass was flying everywhere and Big Jo pushed Rosaline out of the room, but not before she called my name.

“Caleb! Come! Quickly!”

But I didn’t. And she was gone with the slam of the door. I was left alone to face whatever was coming at me.

My hand gripped the jagged knife tightly, as if I could battle a monster with something that small. Maybe fear had locked my knees in place, preventing me from fleeing. But it didn’t matter. I was there, and something was coming.

The loud thumps were replaced by a sizzling sound, not unlike gas escaping a sparkless cooking stove. Dark clouds, dripping with heavy, black liquid penetrated through the open windows. Faces of anguish appeared with each drop, and whispers of woe filled the cold room.

A beast emerged. Blacker than the dark abyss, with two distinct red gems shimmering amidst despair. My entire body trembled. The semblance of a tongue, melting residue of corpses absorbed, drew closer. And closer. And closer. Until it was about to lick me, snatch my body and devour it like the others.

Taking courage in my own hands, I thrusted the knife into the tongue. As I did, I was certain it was a foolish act that would amount to nothing. I could already see my hand splashing right through that abomination. Except it didn’t. Instead, it pierced it, and darkness vanished at once.

The room turned silent. Every sound seemed to have disappeared from this earth. All that remained were the broken pieces of glass and scorched marks on the marble floor where the black liquid had dripped.

For a moment, I considered running to the basement and call Rosaline and Big Jo to tell them it was finally over. But something stopped me. Deep inside, I knew it wasn’t the end. All I had done was injure that monstrosity, not kill it. The calls to the cave compelled me to go.

Before I left, I scribbled a quick note to thank Rosaline and Big Jo for everything, and explain what happened, and where I was heading to. I also warned them not to follow me.

The walk through the forest seemed instantaneous. I finally was back at the cave’s entrance, except it wasn’t blocked off. I stepped in. There was a pungent smell, and voices that begged me to turn back. But I was ready to confront whatever awaited within.

Down, down, down I went, flashlight in hand, until I discovered the endless cavern filled with mummified corpses, just as Hector had, and his father before him. My steps echoed throughout the dank chamber. Every so many steps I snapped my head around, only to be greeted by an endless abyss of darkness. I would stare, wondering if I had heard something or if my imagination was playing tricks on me.

As the corpses began to shift towards a more modern age, my heart began to pound harder. Then, I gasped. In front of me was Hector’s corpse, sitting there, lifeless, decomposing, just like the others.

“Hector,” I whispered… “Why didn’t you tell me the truth? Were you trying to protect me?” I snorted. “Ironic, isn’t it?”

To my left was an empty chair. Above it was a plaque with my name on it. And now I had three options. I could keep going, just like Hector’s father did; I could turn back and be likely ambushed by that creature and die; or I could simply sit on the chair and see what would happen. So I did.

As soon as my bottom touched the chair, the entire room started to shake. Small rock pebbles and dust detached from the ceiling, and, even though it was pitch black from where I came, it became even darker. It was as if, instead of being the absence of light, that blackness was a void, devouring not only light, but darkness as well, creating the blackest of black. Except for two ruby red eyes, shining like a predator with lasers.

**Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.**

It approached. Slowly. Taking its time.

**Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.**

All became cold. Sounds had ceased to exist – yes, even my heart beats were inaudible.

**Thump. Thump. Thump. THUMP.**

It was right in front of me. Total blackness, shapeless, yet I could see its dark teeth and shimmering eyes. This… thing was a monster inside a monster, constantly folding on itself, dripping corpses – or perhaps souls – of the dead. Of my ancestors. Dripping them, only to absorb them back as their silent screams of anguish pierced my own soul.

I was seconds away from meeting their fate, quivering from fear, frustrated that I was trapped and about to die. Until I remembered the knife.

For reasons I still don’t understand, instead of piercing the abomination, I surprised myself when I simply thrusted the knife into my own chest, piercing my heart. Maybe I wanted an easy way out. Or maybe I felt the need to end it on my own terms. Whatever the reason, I sat there, suffering, bleeding profusely as the creature folded.

Then, the earth shook like never before. A peculiar smell made me smile. Water. I could hear it coming. I could see a tsunami of corpses and waves rapidly approaching.

And then, all was black. Or rather, colorless.

“Caleb –”

“Yes?” I answered the voice, suddenly emerging from everywhere and nowhere at once.

“Look!”

I tried to open my eyes. But I had no more eyes. Yet I was able to see.

“Hector?” I muttered.

His naked figure, floating into nothing was backed up by thousands upon thousands of naked men behind him.

“You have freed us all,” he said. “Thank you. And sorry.”

All those men vanished into thin air before I could utter another word.

“Hector? What happened? Am I… dead?”

Maybe I was.

“Hector?”

I had no eyes, yet I cried. I had broken the curse. And now I was no more.

 

\* \* \*

 

How long I stayed in that void of nihility is anyone’s guess. At some point, maybe days, maybe years later, it had all turned black.

*No, not black,* I thought. *Eigengrau.*

I opened my eyes and found myself wired to many machines.

“Ro…saline?”

My voice was raspy.

“Caleb! You’re awake!” she cried, holding my hand. “We were so worried! We thought you were dead when we found you at the entrance, completely wet and bloodied.”

I tried to make sense of everything but I simply went back to slumber.

The next time I woke up, I slowly spoke with Rosaline about what happened. I had been gone for half a year, comatose, and dead according to the doctors. It was Rosaline who insisted on keeping me on the machines. She said she felt a connection between us, she knew that deep inside, I was still there. Somewhere.

Many tears were shed when I explained the whole story – at a slow pace due to my vocal cords being unused for so long.

“You’re pregnant?” I asked, noticing her huge belly.

She smiled. “One would be surprised, wouldn’t they?” she said. “Though I’m past the age of bearing children, I have had many of my eggs frozen and stored for a potential future. But because of the curse, I’ve always been scared of what would happen if it was a boy. In a few months,” she continued, tapping gently on her round belly, “Sarah will be part of our family.”

“A girl…” I said. Though I knew the curse was lifted, I was relieved to know it wasn’t a boy.

 

We spoke for maybe an hour or so about so many things. Rosaline wanted me to stay in Britain, but I don’t think I could ever get used to the wealth, the lifestyle. And knowing that I am far away from that accursed place makes me feel safer.

So, there it is, the conclusion of my story. I now know who my father was, without ever thinking about searching for him, the curse is lifted, and I am back home. My life has changed, since I am now wheelchair bound due to my long comatose state, but, somehow, I am happy that things turned how they did.

The only thing that bothers me is that, for an instant, I thought I saw a flash of red sparkling in Sarah’s eyes as I bid my goodbyes to her and her mother at the airport. But I’m sure it was just a figment of my imagination.
