My name is Thomas. I’m twenty-five years old, and I’m writing this because I don’t think I’ll be alive for much longer.

When people ask me why I hate clowns, I usually laugh it off. I say I just find them creepy the painted smiles, the fake laughter. But that’s not the truth. The truth is a lot darker.

It started fifteen years ago, when I was ten. Back then, life wasn’t easy. My dad was the kind of man who could turn a good day bad with just a look. He drank a lot. When he came home, we never knew what version of him we were getting the quiet one who sat on the couch staring at nothing, or the storm that broke everything in its path.

My mom, Anna, tried her best to protect me. She worked two jobs to keep food on the table and somehow still managed to tuck me in every night. I remember her perfume lavender and laundry detergent. It always made me feel safe.

But Dad didn’t like it when she stood up to him.

There’s one night I’ll never forget. It was raining so hard that the gutters outside overflowed. Mom was standing by the kitchen sink, her back to him, and he was screaming about money how she was wasting it, how she was trying to turn me against him. She told him to leave. I still remember the exact words she said:

“If you ever loved either of us, you’ll walk out that door and never come back! The joke is on you Evan!”

He laughed, that dry, broken sound that made my stomach twist. Then he threw his beer bottle against the wall, and it shattered just inches from her head. I remember her scream. I remember the way the glass sparkled on the floor like ice.

He left that night. Mom locked the door behind him and slid down to the floor crying. I wanted to go to her, but I was too scared. I just sat on the stairs and listened to her sob until she fell asleep there on the kitchen tiles.

For a while, things got better. She smiled more. We’d eat dinner together, just the two of us. We even laughed again. I thought maybe we’d be okay.

Then the nightmares started.

At first, it was just the usual sleep paralysis that terrifying feeling where you can’t move, can’t scream, but you can see. I’d wake up frozen, staring into the dark corner of my room, certain something was there. And one night, there was.

A clown. He stood right beside my bed.

He wasn’t like the clowns you see at birthday parties. His paint looked old, cracked in thin spiderweb lines across his cheeks, as if it had been there for years. The colors on his face had faded yellowing white, dull red but the painted grin was still impossibly bright, stretched almost to his ears. His nose wasn’t even round; it looked like it had been glued on crooked, half peeling away.

And the smell God, that smell it wasn’t makeup or sweat. It was something sweet and spoiled, like fruit left too long in the sun, with a sharp metallic sting that caught in my throat.

He didn’t move at first. Just stood there beside my bed, hands dangling at his sides. The air felt heavier with every second. I could hear the slow wheeze of his breathing, like air escaping through a slit in a balloon.

Then, without a sound, his head began to turn toward the door. Not the way people turn it was too slow, too steady, until I could hear the faint crackle of his neck joints. When his head faced the hallway, his body followed, one foot after another, shoes squeaking faintly against the floorboards.

I don’t know why I got up. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was fear that felt too big to stay inside me. My body just moved.

The hallway light flickered the moment I stepped out. For a second everything went dark, and when it came back on, he was standing halfway down the hall rocking side to side in a strange rhythm, like a child humming to himself. Then he began to dance.

It wasn’t joyful. Each movement was stiff and jerky, like someone pulling invisible strings. His shoes scuffed the wood in uneven circles, the bright pom-poms on his chest bobbing with every twitch. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to believe it was some horrible prank. But then I saw the edges of his smile twitch not the paint, but the skin underneath, trembling like something trying to escape.

And then he stopped.

He reached slowly into the deep, sagging pocket of his costume. I heard something scrape against the fabric before a faint glint caught the light a kitchen knife, the blade dull and stained with something dark.

He turned his head toward my mother’s door.

The moment he stepped inside, the house changed. The air felt thicker. I could hear the soft creak of the floorboards beneath his shoes, then a single breath my mother’s sharp, startled.

Then came the sounds. Muffled first. Then sharper. Rhythmic. Something hitting, slicing, breaking the stillness in steady, awful bursts. I didn’t understand what I was hearing, but my body did I could feel my chest tighten, my vision blur. The light flickered again, and for a second, her shadow and his merged into one on the wall.

When the noises stopped, the silence was worse.

I took one step forward, then another. The floorboards groaned under my bare feet. The smell hit me before I reached the doorway copper and rot and something else I’ll never be able to name.

The clown stood there, motionless, facing me. His costume was darker now, soaked and dripping. Something hung from his hand I didn’t see what it was at first, because I was too focused on his eyes. They were wide, unblinking, and filled with a joy I can’t describe.

Then I realized what he was holding. He was holding my mother’s decapitated head.

And he smiled a slow, deliberate curl of his lips that didn’t match the painted one. Then that wheezing laugh started again, low and uneven, building into a childish giggle that bounced off the walls.

He stepped closer. I couldn’t move. The sound of his shoes against the wood echoed like tiny screams. Then, without warning, he threw her head at me heavy, wet, thudding against the floor just before my feet.

The clown looked at me and whispered ”Now the joke’s on you buddy!”

I screamed until my throat tore. The last thing I saw before I passed out was the clown standing at the end of the hallway, bowing, as if finishing a show before he slipped into the dark and was gone.

When the police arrived, I couldn’t say anything. I just kept repeating the same thing over and over:

“The bad clown killed my mom.”

They thought I was in shock. They thought I’d imagined it. There were footprints, but they led nowhere. For two years, no one believed me.

Then they arrested my dad.

He’d been living in an abandoned trailer a few towns over. When they searched it, they found a clown costume crusted with old blood and a kitchen knife with my mother’s DNA on it. I didn’t know whether to feel relief or despair. He was the clown. He’d killed her.

I went to live with my aunt and uncle. They were kind people, but the house always felt too quiet. For ten years, I tried to rebuild myself. Therapy. Medication. Nightlights. Anything to stop the dreams.

When I turned twenty, I met Valkyria. I know strange name. But she was wonderful. She made me laugh again. She made me believe I could be normal. We got married two years later, and for a while, I thought the curse was broken.

Until two weeks ago.

I came home from work and found a letter in the mailbox. No return address. Just my name written in red ink Thomas. Inside, there was a single sheet of paper with six words on it:

“I miss you. See you soon. — Mr. Clown”

I laughed at first. Thought it was some sick prank. But then the police called.

My father had escaped from prison.

They told me to lock my doors, to stay somewhere safe. But I don’t think anywhere is safe now. Last night, I woke up at 3:12 a.m. the exact time I used to get sleep paralysis as a kid. The house was silent. Valkyria was asleep beside me.

And then I heard it.

A soft squeak. Like a balloon being twisted.

I got up and checked the hallway. And for a second, just before the lights flickered I swear I saw a shadow. A wide grin painted where no face should be.

If anyone reads this and something happens to me tell Valkyria I love her.

I guess that The Joke’s on Me this time.
