I was on my third beer and second joint when the old man walked into our campsite. The sites along the edge of Crimson Valley weren’t exactly protected—like most campsites, our perimeter was a line on a map in a Parks and Rec Office. So, when the old man approached us, we figured it was an honest mistake. 

“Oh, sorry,” I said. “This is our site.”

The man showed us his hands, as if to say I come in peace. 

“Oh, don’t mind me,” the man said. “I just wanted to get in on this little party.” 

We laughed as I hid the joint behind my back. This was rural Virginia, after all. 

“Not a party, just a get-together,” Jenny said. 

“I love a get-together,” the old man said. “And no place better to get together than Crimson Valley.”

I looked over at Sean, who was giving me a can-you-believe-this-shit glare. He had his arm around Claire, who was much more forgiving in the way she looked at the old man. Sean and Claire had been dating since high school, which made them a little kinder than most people. I was corrupted by all of my failed relationships, so I approached every new person like they were going to hurt me. I was hopeful Jenny wouldn’t make my break-up list, but it was still too early to tell. 

“Come join us,” Claire said. “Do you want a beer?” 

Sean squeezed her hand, but she ignored his signal. 

“Oh, I would love one,” the old man said. “Nothing better for telling a story than a cold beer.”

The man sat on a log between Sean and Claire and me and Jenny. He had a long, gray beard and soft, blue eyes, like he had spent too long staring at the sun. He was wearing a white tank top, blue jeans, and steel-toed boots. 

“So,” he said, “I was going for a walk and heard you telling scary stories, is that right?” 

We nodded. Sean had recently started writing on r/NoSleep and was regaling us with tales of skin-walkers and cryptids. Every other line, Claire would wince and bury her face in Sean’s neck. Jenny, on the other hand, was unfazed by the scary stories. She had a buzz cut and two sleeves of tattoos, most of which were of monsters and demons. Unlike Claire, Jenny did not spook easily.

“I love scary stories,” the old man said. “Can I tell one?”

“Oh, well, we actually—” Sean started, but Claire jumped in. 

“Of course,” she said. “We’d love to hear one. Besides, it’s nice to have some company. We thought Crimson Valley would be more”—

“Lively?” the old man said. 

“Yeah,” Claire said.

Around us, the valley was silent. Online, they said Crimson Valley was nearly impossible to get a site at. But when we called the office to book, we had no issues. In fact, the woman on the phone sounded relieved. 

“Well, my story might help answer some of your questions,” the old man said. “May I?”

Sensing no way out of the encounter, we nodded. Personally, I wanted to impress Jenny with my own scary story chops, but I guess that had to wait.

“Alright then,” the old man said. “It all started…  
  
\*\*\*  
  
It all started seventy-one years ago today. It was a muggy summer morning, the kind that brought flies out of hiding. The man, who we’ll call The Farmer, had a lot of sowing to do. The Farmer was a drunk, like many men in that time. On this particular morning, he was violently hungover. Legend has it, he was up all night puking in the outhouse. When the sun came up, his wife came out and started banging on the door. 

Bang! Bang! Bang!

‘Farmer! Get out in them fields!’ she yelled. 

The Farmer’s Wife was a big, scary woman, with fingers thick as broomsticks. Like so many women in that day, she worked just as hard—if not harder—than her husband, doing the hours of labor required to keep a struggling farm above water. She hated the way he drank, both financially and spiritually. If she could have done it over, she would have picked a sober husband, although those were hard to find in those days. Or, maybe, she would have gathered some of the other spinsters and made her own farm. She was always fonder of women than men. But, it was the 50s, and Crimson Valley was like any other small farming town—if something’s worked before, it’ll need to work again. 

The Farmer’s Wife was at her wit’s end when The Farmer emerged. He pushed by her, stumbled to his tractor with puke in his beard, and got to work. As the engine rolled and he rode into the valley, he had a strange feeling in his gut. See, The Farmer’s Wife had forced him to get one of the new, motor-powered tractors. The Farmer was resistant, of course, but he was eventually convinced. But, on this morning, something about the machine filled him with dread. He didn’t like anything having more power than him, whether it be his twelve children, his bullheaded wife, or the machine sitting under his ass. 

But the harvest wasn’t going to wait, and neither could he. 

He made it through about half the field with no problems. In fact, he was making better time than usual. Maybe, he thought, he could cut out early and head down to the Crimson Valley Inn for some mutton and whiskey. And, maybe, he would try his luck again with the innkeeper’s daughter—a tall, skinny girl just shy of twenty. Sometimes they’d talk about the weather. He loved the way she said the word rain, like she adored its power. He knew he had kissed her once, although he couldn’t quite remember it. 

In fact, he was trying to remember that kiss when he took a long, peaceful yawn. That’s when the fly flew into his mouth. As it hit the back of his throat, the previous night’s sickness came rushing back up. He leaned over the side of the mower to vomit but went too far. His legs flew above his body and fell down toward the wheels. 

The drag harrow, which was the sheet of hooks that drags behind the mower, could not see the man fallen down in the field. It moved forward, as machines do, blissfully unaware of The Farmer in its path.  

The hooks didn’t do much as they passed over the man. He felt their spiky little hands, but they merely grazed him. He yelled out, cursing the machine his wife made them buy. Lying on his back next to the deafening sound, he waited patiently for the drag harrow to pass him by. He stared at the sun for a moment, thinking back to his kiss with the innkeeper’s daughter.

Then, all at once, the sun disappeared. 

He first felt the pressure in his neck, which was strange. Then, the sensation hit his ears, and then his eyes. It wasn’t quite painful. Instead, it felt warm. He tried to reach up and move whatever was blocking his vision, but he couldn’t. His sleeves were caught in the hooks. As he worked to shimmy them off, he realized he was moving along with the tractor. 

Then, he felt the pain and realized the source of his troubles.

There were hooks in his eyes.

As the machine dredged onward, the pain grew astronomical, like fire swallowing a barn.   
The Farmer screamed, and prayed, and cried. But, no one heard him under the wail of the machine. With each passing second, the pain in his neck multiplied. It felt like someone was pulling his vertebrate apart one by one, the same way you’d pull wool. It went on like that for two minutes which, to The Farmer, felt as long as his entire life. 

Then, his clothing ripped, causing the hooks on his sleeves to unleash. But, the ones in his eyes remained. They were too deep to be undone. 

He only made it a few seconds. The pain reached a new level. He heard something tear, then felt a pop. 

The tractor made it all the way back to the farmhouse, rolling to a stop against a fence. The Farmer’s Wife walked out, ready to yell at her lazy husband for failing to put the machine in park.   
But, when she walked to the tractor, all she found was her husband’s head in the chains. His mouth stretched in a scream, his face frozen in a look of unbelievable terror. And then there were his eyes. For the rest of her days, she would never shake the image of her husband’s gouged out eyes.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
When the old man finished his story, he took a long drink of his beer then tossed the empty bottle in the fire. Claire started clapping.

“Scary!” she squealed. 

“That was… really good,” Sean said. “I would definitely watch that movie.”

“I hope The Farmer’s Wife had a beautiful, lesbian relationship after that,” Jenny said. “The Farmer deserved to die. He was a creepy drunk.”

“Jenny! No one deserves that,” Claire said.

“He wanted to hook up with a teenager!” Jenny said.

We all laughed, including the old man. As much as I hated that he crashed our party, I did think it was a good story.  

“Yeah, that was definitely scary,” I said. “Anyone want another beer?”

“Yeah, grab me one,” Sean said. 

“Me too,” Jenny said. 

“I’m good,” Claire said. 

I looked at the old man. He shook his head. 

“None for me,” he said. 

“Sounds good,” I said, then stood up. 

But, when I tried to walk over to our cooler, something stopped me. I couldn’t move my leg. I looked down. There was some sort of metal cuff on my ankle. I tried to shake it off, but all I heard was the ring of a chain.

“What is this?” I asked. 

Claire, Sean, and Jenny looked at it and laughed, like I had gotten tangled in some brush. But when they saw what it was, they looked confused. Sean stood up to help me, but fell forward.

“What the—“ he said, looking back at his ankle. 

Claire and Jenny looked down too. The cuffs were on all of our ankles.

“How did this happen?” Jenny asked. We were all standing now, doing our best to shake off the chains that were now on our feet. No one was laughing anymore, except the old man. He stood up and took a step back, just out of our reach. 

“I guess I should have finished the story first,” he said. “You see, after the funeral, something strange happened along the path that The Farmer had been dragged in. On that specific line, the crops were incredibly fruitful. The corn grew three times the normal height, like something out of an old fable.”  
Panic filled my body. Instinctually, I picked up a stone and threw it at the old man. It missed his head by an inch. He didn’t even flinch.

“Let us go!” I demanded.

“At first, people thought it was a coincidence,” he said. “But, the next year, the crops didn’t grow at all. Not a single ear of corn throughout the valley. It was like the dirt had grown accustomed to the taste of blood. Our town nearly went under. Then, The Farmer’s Wife had an idea.”

“Sean! Do something!” Claire screamed. 

I looked over at Jenny. She kept her focus on the fire. Her teeth were chattering. 

“We can pay you money,” Sean said, standing up. “My dad’s a lawyer. What you want? $10,000?”

A figure appeared behind Sean. I couldn’t make out its face in the darkness, but I could see its arm wrap across Sean’s neck. The movement was quick, almost graceful. I saw the line, and then the blood. Something handed the figure a bucket, which it placed under Sean’s slit throat. He looked at me, his face frozen in shock. He tried to speak, but all that came out of his mouth was more blood. 

I looked at Claire. She didn’t scream. Instead, she laughed once, like her brain had misfired. Then, another figure descended on her. This time, it chose her stomach, jamming the knife three times into her belly button. She moaned in agony, then collapsed toward the fire. Two figures lifted her body and placed her over a new bucket.  Her hair, tangled in the logs, quickly caught on fire. But, she didn’t make a sound. 

Now, I could make out the figures a little clearer. They were dressed in long black robes, their faces covered by hoods.

I went to pick up another rock, but something grabbed me. It held my arms behind my back and forced me down onto a log. The figures from the other side of the fire moved toward me, their curved blades pointed forward. To my left, I heard Jenny scream, like her brain finally caught on to what was happening. I heard a few more knife plunges, then the trickle of blood in the tin bucket, then nothing at all. 

As Jenny fell into the dirt, the old man walked toward me. 

“I know this is difficult, son,” he said. “And you might want to blame me, but I am not to blame.” 

“P—please,” I said. My head was spinning. 

“Why didn’t you feel the chains on your feet? Why didn’t you hear them approach? These aren’t trained assassins, son. These are drunk, pigeon-footed farmers. Any idiot would have noticed them.”

“Please,” I said. “I…I won’t tell anyone. You have enough blood. Please.”

A figure handed the old man a new bucket. He pushed it against my chest, the rim cold on my throat. Then, he lifted a long, curved blade from the back of his pants. He pushed the tip carefully into my eyelid. As the pain erupted, I felt something pop. Hot blood ran down the side of my face. 

“All a human has is their attention,” the old man said, pushing the blade deeper into my eye. “So, if you remember anything in your final moments, remember this…”

My face felt numb. I moaned in agony as he pulled out the blade and went for my other eye. The old man brought his face close to mine and whispered.

“Never, ever trust the [storyteller.](https://www.dandeluise.com/gather-round-anthology)”

\*\*\*

Looking back now, I don't know why he spared me at that last moment. Maybe he felt blinding me would be enough. Maybe he had enough blood. Maybe he felt sorry for me. Or, maybe, he let me live because I did the one thing none of the others did...

I listened.
