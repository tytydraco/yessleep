Trigger Warnings: Reference to sex. Reference to collecting the bones of dead animals. There's blood of course.

We stepped through a small doorway on the farside of the structure and into a vast cement room where darkness filled wherever their light did not shine.  The air was fetid and stagnant and hot, permeated with red from the blood moon.  Two rows of pillars ran the length of the room, separated by a large groove in the floor, probably once used to pipe water through the facility. Just outside of the pillars, rows of altar-like slabs lined the room that once held up machinery long gone. The walls were heavily graffitied with warnings and names and beckonings to go deeper into the innards of the building. Under our shoes, the floors were gritty with dust and littered with industrial debris and the trash of its many visitors.

“Why is it so hot in here? I asked. 

“Dude, you’re probably getting hot flashes,” Crow said dismissively or at least Ithought she had, but I laughed it off.

“We need to be careful,” I shone his light around the floor illuminating several square holes in the cement falling to a seeming abyss below. 

“Yeah, my cousin fell down one of these and broke her ankle,” Jason said. “And that wasn’t even a deep one. It’ll be harder at night to see them. We’ll walk behind you Chris.”

Why do they want to walk behind me?, I thought. Ever since her death I felt they were aligned against him. Jason playing the part of faux sympathetic friend. Crow fucking me and then walling Me out. Always whispering and laughing. I wondered if I should fear them as much as this place. This would be the perfect place to do away with me as accidents were easy to come by.

The stairs leading down to *Hell* were on the far side of the main room. We crossed carefully avoiding the many holes and pitfalls. Halfway there, Jason tripped over a loose pipe sending it clinging down a deep crevice before hitting water below. Afraid we awakened the place, we waited and listened for some responding noise far off in the distance, for something coming towards us. Nothing, all was quiet. Just as I lifted my foot to continue, there was the vague sound of breaking stone beneath us in the pessimum of *Hell,* as if something were boring through the cement. It was far below and vibrated the floor only slightly–easy enough to dismiss as the natural deterioration of the place. We continued. 

When we came to the end, we found bones of a small animal, mostly clean of flesh, scattered across the last altar. Chris thought it might be a cat. 

“What the fuck is that?” Jason pointed. “Do you think it was the Satanists?”

“Everyone knows they don’t really do that,” Crow smirked. “It’s either some wannabes or just some animal died there.” 

She stepped towards the altar, pulled her backpack around her front, and unzipped it. She picked up each bone, running them through her fingers, and dropping them into her backpack.

“*What* are you doing?” Jason was taken aback.

“Don’t worry about it,” Crow smiled playfully at him.

I knew what she was doing. She told me the day she suggested the Equadome and for a moment regretted it before relishing in it. She explained she sleeps with them, surrounds herself with them tucked under her blanket. All sorts of bones. Bones left over from meals. Bones she finds on the road or in the woods. Bones from a family pet they buried in the yard and she dug back up. Why? I had asked. Because being that close to death is comforting. The quiet of it all. I feel more alive, she explained.. It should have turned him off, I knew that, but it had the opposite effect.

“Let’s move on,” I said, pointing my flashlight towards a hole in the floor with a stone staircase falling quickly into the void. Scrawled in black paint above it were the words *Your Dreams lie below with us in Hell* with an arrow pointing down.  “Either of you ever been down there before?”

Crow shook her head. Jason told another story about his cousin once being chased out by a group of men, naked with burlap sacks on their heads.

“Was that before or after she broke her ankle?” I asked.

“Fuck you,” Jason laughed. Crow shrugged and headed towards the stairs. Why can’t I even get a laugh out of her, I thought. If Jason said it, she would have laughed. They were joined against me and I didn’t know why.

The stairs lacked railing and the flashlight shined in all directions would not land on either ground or wall so that I felt as if we were descending into the depths of a great black lake. It was only at the last few steps that the floor revealed itself, strewn with rusted metal and other refuse from the Equadome’s days of use and cigarette butts, shattered glass pipes, and unwrapped condoms from its nights of misuse. As if appearing from nothing, we were at the end of a long, narrow hall with doorless entries into many rooms littering each wall,  the end of which still a mystery to us. To me, the heat was suffocating, radiating like a beating heart veiled by the darkness. I took my shirt off and put it in his backpack. Crow and Jason looked at me confused, but the time for joking had passed. 

“The guy said the blue stones start twelve doors down on the right,” Crow said, pointing into the black. “Give me the flashlight. It’ll help us find them faster since I know what we’re looking for.”

If Crow asked, I would oblige and handed it to her as we made their way slowly down the hall counting doors as we went.

“It smells like shit down here, like there’s something dead,” Jason said. “I still don’t understand why we couldn’t do this during the day.”

“It’s just as dark down here during the day, so just pretend,” Crow said.

We came to the twelfth door and stepped in. Crow scanned the room with the flashlight. The room was square, bare, and only about thirty feet long. At the end was a shaft falling into another black abyss. 

“I wonder what’s in there,” Jason said. 

We peered over the edge and it was not an abyss at all, but had a floor about fifteen feet below framing another stone slab, this one with a jagged pipe jutting upwards from it. The flashlight flashed against something metal and polished next to the altar.

“Crow, shine the light there,” I said. “Jason, isn’t that the ring your Dad gave you that you’ve been missing. How’d that get…”

“Do you guys hear that?” Crow asked, a kind of fear building in her voice that I had never seen in her. 

“Hear what?” I asked.

“They are screaming. I can’t get them to stop. So many voices all at once. They are so fucking loud.”

I moved towards her, but she flung me off, swinging her arms wildly, and pacing back and forth. As if caught in a trap, she stopped, her body rigored, her eyes mesmerized by something on the back wall unseen to me and Jason. Then, she screamed loud and long, echoing through the dark halls of *Hell.* As quickly as it started and before I could stop her, she ran from the room with the flashlight and we were left in darkness. We came out into the hallway to follow her, but she was gone, absorbed by the dark.

“What the fuck was that?” Jason was frantic. “We shouldn’t fucking be here. How can she disappear like that? We need to get out of here.”

“Calm down,” I grabbed him by the shoulders and pulled him back into the twelfth room. “I don’t know what just happened, but there’s nothing we can do about it.” I didn’t realize that I’d felt this way all along until I said it. “Jason, I don’t think we can leave. I think we are trapped. The only way out is to keep going. We need to find the blue rocks.” It took some time, but eventually Jason calmed.

High above us, the concrete had been busted through long ago and crimson moonlight filled the room. As our eyes adjusted to the dark, the stone walls seemed to flow and glimmer with blood. We searched the room for the blue rocks on our hands and knees, methodically, as if it were a key to our cage or a rope out of the depths of the great black lake. We were at the edge of the shaft. 

“Jason, how is your ring down there? It’s been missing, right?”

“I really don’t know how it’s there, but I have an idea. I could tell you a bunch of bullshit right now and it might work, but I’ve been meaning to tell you. Your sister and I, you know we were close. I gave her the ring.”

“Why?” I already knew. I needed him to say it.

“We were screwing around, but it was more than that…”

I stood up. Jason met me eye-to-eye, crimson faces. 

“Did you know she was pregnant?”, I said through gritted teeth. 

“Shit…no, man. She was pregnant?

My sister had told me through streaming tears the day before she died. She wouldn’t tell from whom. It didn’t matter, she said. It would be the baby or her, she said. I remembered her words *I can’t live with this* and then she was gone, worse than gone–a lifeless broken body–and I had told nobody. Since, the words were like worms consuming my brain–*I can’t live with this, I can’t live with this.* .  

“This is your fault too. She told me a day before she died or killed herself or whatever that she *couldn’t live with it*. Goddammit Jason, how could you? We both did this to her.”

I could see Jason taking it in, the guilt in his eyes. Jason was becoming me and it brought me a vague satisfaction.

And then Jason’s eyes turned to the door–quickly, imperceptibly if I hadn’t been so close.   A soft rush of wind and a flicker of black and I was looking at the distant wall, not quite sure what happened. Jason was gone. There was a thud and raspy groan from the recesses of the shaft just beside me. I shook myself out from what felt like a space between sleep and reality to find Jason sprawled on the altar looking up at me, his body arched violently over the metal pipe. His body writhed as he looked from wall to wall trying to make sense of how he got down there and the pain he felt.  Did I do this?, I thought. 

“Are you okay?” I called out, aware the situation outweighed my words.

“What happened…I’m not sure. The pipe didn’t go through…I don’t think…but I can’t feel my legs…”

“You’re moving them so that’s a good sign. I’m going to come down and…”

A crash came from outside of the room far down the hall, like metal pots clinking across the floor. I turned to look. 

“What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?” Jason yelled quickly in succession and I turned back.

Two arms like snakes slithered out from either side of the altar. Brown like old blood, they stretched outwards six feet in both directions, clinched fists opening to unveil long clawed fingers. Each arm curled towards Jason until the spine-like fingers rested on his chest. There was a moment that felt like an eternity. An eternity where I questioned what I was seeing and refused to believe what I knew would come next. An eternity that came to an end with the sound of bone snapping and flesh separating and Jason letting out an inhuman scream. An eternity ending with the pipe bursting through Jason’s chest and his blood coming forth like a fountain seeming to stop in midair eye-level to me before splattering back down on my friend’s chest. I watched, stunned and unable to move, as Jason twitched and gurgled on the altar, the arms sliding silently back beneath the altar. In time, Jason was silent too.
