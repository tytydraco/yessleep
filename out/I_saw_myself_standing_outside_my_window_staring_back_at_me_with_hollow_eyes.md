It was a Wednesday night, and I was home alone, enjoying the solitude with a movie marathon. My wife was out of town on a business trip, and our dog, Max, had been unusually quiet all evening, staying by my side as if sensing something was off.

Around midnight, I decided to take a break and grab a snack from the kitchen. As I passed by the living room window, I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat. There, in the dim light of the streetlamp, was a figure standing on the sidewalk, looking directly at our house. I couldn’t make out any details, but the silhouette was unnervingly familiar.

I brushed it off, thinking it was just a neighbor or a trick of the light. But when I returned to the living room, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread. I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me. I glanced out the window again, and this time, the figure was closer, standing right at the edge of our yard. I squinted, trying to make out the features, but all I could see were those hollow eyes reflecting the light.

My heart pounded as I rushed to turn off the lights, hoping the darkness would obscure me from view. I peeked through the blinds, and my blood ran cold. The figure was now on our porch, staring directly into the window. I could see myself, or rather, someone who looked exactly like me, standing there with an eerie, emotionless expression.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over Max, who was now growling softly. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911, but the line was dead. Panic set in as I realized I was completely alone and cut off from any help. I decided to confront the imposter, hoping to scare them off or at least get some answers.

As I approached the door, I heard a soft tap, tap, tap on the window. I froze. The tapping was rhythmic, almost hypnotic. Gathering every ounce of courage, I flung the door open, but no one was there. I stepped outside, my breath visible in the chilly night air. The street was empty.

Shaking, I went back inside, locking the door behind me. I decided to stay in the living room until sunrise, armed with a kitchen knife. The rest of the night was a blur of fear and exhaustion. As dawn broke, I finally felt a semblance of safety return.

When my wife came home the next day, I told her everything. She looked at me with concern but also doubt. We checked the security cameras, but they showed nothing unusual. It was as if the entire night had been a figment of my imagination.

But I know what I saw. And sometimes, late at night, I still hear that rhythmic tap, tap, tap on the window. I never dare to look, afraid of what—or who—I might see staring back at me.

**"I saw myself standing outside my window, staring back at me with hollow eyes."**

A chill ran down my spine as I stared at the reflection. The figure, identical to me, wore a blank, soulless expression. My mind raced, trying to comprehend the impossible sight. My hand trembled as I reached for the curtains, pulling them shut. I hoped that closing the barrier between us would make the doppelgänger disappear.

Max whimpered, sensing my unease. I sank onto the couch, clutching my phone. I tried calling my wife, but the call wouldn’t go through. The signal was strong, but every time I dialed, I was met with static. The more I tried, the more frantic I became.

Suddenly, the power went out, plunging the house into darkness. I grabbed a flashlight from the kitchen drawer and flicked it on, the beam slicing through the blackness. Max stayed close, his fur bristling. As I scanned the room, the flashlight’s beam landed on the window, revealing the figure still standing there, closer than before.

My reflection’s eyes seemed to follow the light, tracking my every movement. I shouted, demanding to know who they were, what they wanted. There was no response, only the silent, eerie stare. Desperation set in. I couldn’t stay in the house, but leaving meant facing whatever was out there.

I decided to make a run for it, grabbing Max’s leash and my car keys. With a deep breath, I threw the door open and dashed outside, Max at my heels. The cold air hit me like a slap, but I didn’t stop. I ran to the car, fumbling with the keys in my haste.

As I looked back, I saw the figure standing at the door, watching me. My own face, twisted into a sinister smile, sent a wave of terror through me. I jumped into the car and sped away, not daring to look back again.

I drove to a friend’s house, barely able to speak through my fear. They let me in, and I spent the night on their couch, too scared to sleep. The next day, I returned home, expecting to find some sign of the intruder, but everything was as I left it. The only trace of the night’s events was the deep sense of unease that lingered.

To this day, I don’t know what I saw or why it appeared. I moved away soon after, hoping to leave the terror behind. But sometimes, late at night, I hear that soft tap, tap, tap on the window and wonder if it has found me again.
