I don't know who else to talk to about this. I guess I just need to talk to somebody who... doesn't live here?

This all started a few weeks back. The Neighborhood Watch in my area has always been more of a joke than anything. It's a quiet suburb, so aside from the occasional coyote sighting, there doesn't tend to be much cause for alarm. It makes the older folks feel safer, though, and it gives the guys on watch a sense of purpose.

Whenever we see the Watch out and about, we'll offer them a cold drink or maybe a snack, chat about life; it's a fairly close-knit neighborhood so we try to take care of eachother. They are primarily retired; one of them used to be on the police force here in town, and it comforts him to feel like he's still doing his part to keep his neighborhood safe. His name is Jim, the other guys are Donny, Carl, and Deon. Donny puts together model planes in his spare time, Deon has five grandkids and used to work for the postal service, and Carl is a conspiracy theorist. You pick these things up when you live in a tight-knit community like this. Everyone here knows eachother. That's what makes this such a weird thing.

About three weeks ago, the neighborhood watch got a call from this quiet family that lived a street or so over from me, complaining about strange noises coming from outside their house.   I was outside smoking a cigarette when I saw Donny hustling over in his golf cart with a sense of urgency I rarely witness out here. I asked him what the occasion was, and he told me the Millers called in, sounding a little panicked. The Millers mostly kept to themselves so I was surprised to hear that they even called our neighborhood watch for this. He went about his business, and I put out my cigarette and went to bed.

The next day, I saw Donny doing rounds around the little neighborhood park while I was coming home from shopping for groceries, and curiosity got the better of me so I pulled over to ask him about it.

"Hey Donny!" I waved out of my window at him, and he waved back cheerfully. "Did you find anything over at the Miller's house last night?"

Donny's smile faded into a blank stare, confusion muddling his eyebrows together. "I beg your pardon, Adam?"

"You were investigating some kind of noise complaint at the Miller's last night, remember?" I half laughed, not expecting that kind of reaction from him.

"Who the hell are the Millers?" He also half laughed, as though he felt left out of some joke.

I paused, wondering if Donny's mental faculties might be starting to deteriorate in his old age. That would be heartbreaking. "The Millers. You know, the family in the corner house on Carmen Ave?"

He stared at me for a long moment with a look on his face that suggested he was worried that I was the one losing my mental faculties. "Adam, that house is empty. Nobody lives there."

I opened my mouth and then closed it again. I wasn't sure how to interpret what was happening in this conversation, but it didn't seem like it was going to be productive. "Okay, Donny, maybe I misunderstood. Thanks for looking out for the neighborhood!"

I rolled up my window and started driving home, but there was weight in my stomach now that wasn't there before. I couldn't quite place it, but something about his certainty felt wrong. It was offputting. I drove past my driveway and straight to the corner house on Carmen Ave. There was no car parked outside like there usually was. I walked up and rang the doorbell, rehearsing made-up reasons for being there in my head.

No answer. I waited a bit and rang the doorbell again. Maybe they just weren't home, that would explain why the car wasn't there. I sighed, shook my head at my own paranoia, and went home.

When my girlfriend got home from work, I decided to talk to her about it. "Laura, the weirdest thing just happened. Do you remember how I told you that Donny was going to check out the Miller's place last night?"

She stared at me like I had just accused her of adultery. "Who are the Millers?"

I blinked. "The Millers, Laura, with the three little kids, they live on the corner lot one house street over? They brought us banana bread for Christmas one year?"

She was staring at me in horror. "What are you talking about? Are you setting me up with some kind of punch line? Nobody has ever brought us banana bread for Christmas and nobody lives in that house."

I deflated a little. She started putting her things away but with a look on her face like she felt just as confused as I did.

Over the course of the next week, I asked a few more people about it, but they all agreed that there was never a family called the Millers that lived in that house. In fact, they couldn't even remember the last time that house was occupied. I started wondering if I had just imagined them, if I had just imagined Donny talking about going there the other night. I went into a rabbit hole on the internet about the Mandela Effect. I didn't get much sleep for a few days, but ended up chalking it up to "just one of those things" for my own sanity and tried to move on.

I coasted on that for about a week. One night, my girlfriend got home late from work and looked suspiciously concerned. I asked her what was up and she mentioned running into Deon on the way home; he was rushing over to Alex and Tanya's place in response to them reporting strange sounds coming from outside of their house. I could tell she was troubled.

"Adam, didn't you say Donny told you the same thing about some other family last week? The Miltons or something?" She asked, incredulous but uncomfortable with the familiarity.

"The Millers," I sighed. "Only he doesn't remember that happening, and everyone is telling me the Millers don't exist."

Her lips pursed. "I have never seen a family in that house, and I don't know a family called the Millers, but it's weird... it's weird that I just experienced the same conversation with Deon." She swallowed hard. "Do you think maybe you dreamed it? Maybe it was a... a, uh.. a premonition?"

"I was wide awake, Laura," my voice half cracked in defeat that she was still questioning my accounts of that night. "It wasn't a dream, but I... I don't know what it was. I'm the only person who thinks it happened."

My mind started racing. Alex was a good friend of mine. We were hiking buddies, and we often hit the bar together to watch football during the playoffs. Laura loved Tanya; they exchanged recipes and used eachother as guinea pigs when they tried new ones. They exchanged book recommendations as well; Laura was currently reading a book that Tanya lent to her a couple of days prior when they invited us over for dinner. I couldn't get past this creeping paranoia that something bad was going to happen to them.

"Should we go over there and check on them? Just in case?" I asked her, knowing how it sounded.

"I'm sure Deon has it covered; he's tough as nails," she responded, but with a faraway worry in her voice. "Let's call them tomorrow, though, and make sure everything is okay."

She kissed me on the cheek and started getting ready for bed. I sat in the kitchen with my feelings for a while, trying to process all of the thoughts that were running through my head. When I made it upstairs, she had fallen asleep reading the book she borrowed from Tanya. I set it gently on her nightstand and crawled into bed. It was another restless night.

The next day was business as usual. We both had the day off so I made a late breakfast and sang dumb, made-up songs to our cat while I cooked. Laura tolerates me so well. After some partially burnt pancakes and over-easy eggs, I asked her the question without really thinking about it.

"I should call Alex. Do you want to call Tanya too, just to cover our bases?"

She shot me that look again, like I grew three additional heads. "Who's Tanya?"

I actually got pretty angry but tried to contain it, spouting off a strained: "Don't fuck with me like that, Laura, that isn't cool."

She was visibly taken aback by this. She was disgusted by my use of language but also trying to solve an invisible equation in her head.

"I'm sorry, what?" She half coughed at me. She looked serious. Laura had a terrible poker face and I was starting to worry that she might not be fucking with me. That was somehow worse.

"We saw them two days ago." I stuttered in disbelief.

"Adam, this isn't funny," she winced at me. The tables had turned. We were in equal disbelief with one another.

I glanced at the book that she had carried down from the bedroom to read while I was cooking.

"If you don't know Tanya, then where did you get that book?" I asked her, pointing a little too aggressively at it.

Her eyes traced over it and her mouth went a little slack. She squinted. She tilted her head.

"I don't remember," she muttered, seeming a little troubled by it. "Maybe I've always had it."

I could tell that she wasn't sold on that and that she was also questioning reality at the moment. I decided to drop it for now and test the rest of the neighborhood. One time was "just one of those things," but twice in a matter of weeks was something that I couldn't stand for.

I put on my coat and walked out the door, stopping every person I saw out and about and asking them about Alex and Tanya. They all said the same thing. They didn't know who that was, and nobody lived in that house. This was maddening. I felt like I was losing it.

I went to Alex and Tanya's house, and their car wasn't there. I knocked on the door. No answer. I knocked intermittently for about 20 minutes as though they would magically appear and open the door. They didn't.

I climbed the fence into their backyard. Their son's tricycle was still parked by the back door. I felt vindicated and horrified by this. I looked through the windows and the house looked abandoned otherwise. I spent about an hour wandering around their property and looking for some kind of proof that they existed, but all I found was the tricycle. Climbing in the backyard was enough. This neighborhood talked. I would never hear the end of it if I broke in. I couldn't be completely sure that this wasn't all in my head, so I left and started knocking on doors and asking people. Everyone looked at me like I was insane. I was at this for several hours.

At first, I was flustered. That’s an understatement. I was furious. I kept repeating to everyone that I had just seen Alex two days ago, and they just stared back at me with these looks on their faces like I was out of my mind.  I slowly started wearing down. I stopped trying to convince people. I just thanked them for their time and moved on. The fury slowly turned into this incredible sadness and grief. I loved Alex and the world seemed to have just deleted him like a typo right out of existence. I might never see him again. How could I step foot into the bar during playoffs in a world that didn’t remember he ever existed?

When the sun started going down, I stopped by the little office that the neighborhood watch gathered in nightly between rounds. I asked if they had a log of neighborhood events, and was disheartened to find that they didn't keep one because of how rarely there were neighborhood events. I asked them about Alex and Tanya out of habit, but I was no longer surprised when they said they didn't know who that was, and that nobody lived in that house.

I insisted on joining the neighborhood watch. What if this happened again? I had to know what was going on. Somebody who knew this was happening had to be available to investigate it and I seemed to be the only person who was. They were surprised, but they could tell it meant a lot to me and they are nice guys, so they gave me a vest and didn’t question it too much.

I have been at this for about a week and not much has happened until just a minute ago. We got a call from Laura saying there were strange noises coming from outside of the house. I am on the way there right now and terrified of what I might find, but more terrified that tomorrow I might have to continue living in a world that doesn’t believe Laura ever existed. I don’t know if I have to have been home to be affected. I might not be here at all tomorrow. That would almost be better. If I’m lucky, maybe I can find what is causing this and stop it. Wish me luck. I hope you all remember this tomorrow.
