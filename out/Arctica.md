Ice.

Most people don't know much about it, except that they like it in their drinks on a hot summer day. It can be described as water at zero C. Or for any Americans that are reading this, anything below Thirty-two F.

I came with a research group that was supposed to sample ice cores and observe the surrounding conditions. A group by the same name as the company and the ice shelf where my Scott's Polar was pitched 45 degrees west of the sun.

If they hadn't been paying me big bucks, there'd be no way in frozen hell that I'd be here. It wasn't about the science, it wasn't even about being right, I love the science and I've always hated losing an argument.

It's the Fucking Cold.

It's so cold that even getting angry about it feels distant. As there's nothing more important than getting warm. Even on a record day with the sun overhead, boiling water turns into mist when it is tossed into the air. Land? The frozen tundra is hundreds of meters below.

I. am. an. ant. on an ice cube.

Perhaps even smaller.

On this day, the Ross research foundation had sent me and two other employees 20 kilometers across the shelf to get some cores. They were in a hurry because they couldn't wait for the expedition crew to return. For what reason? I have no idea. It made sense for Chloe to be here, she was the glaciologist. London? Maybe. Out of everyone on this continent, he had the most Arctic experience. A whole lot of good that will do him as Antarctica is a different beast. And I was a structural engineer, mainly responsible for raising and lowering equipment. A glorified camper to be honest. I wouldn't be much help in an actual crisis. Which made me wonder why the company was breaking its own policies by sending us out today.

NO DEAD WEIGHT. was rule #3.

And yet here we were, a couple of saddlebags around one horse.

"This is completely fucked." The cabin rattled into my ear, "We shouldn't be here!"

Chloe shouted at me, "100 meters out," as she held up her hands.

"We should have waited until Dave and Simon got back!"

Chloe shook her head. I couldn't tell if that meant she couldn't hear me or if she didn't know what the company was thinking either.

"I love you," I shouted at her.

She only smiled, then nodded when the crawler hit boulders of ice in our path. The front tires lurched over a particularly rough patch and the sun visors came crashing down, swinging its arm into my face. I winced and grabbed at my eye, the plastic had split the brittle skin on my brow. The warm blood instantly drying before it can blur my vision.

It's so cold here that there's little humidity. The entire place is one big sponge that is gasping for even a drop of water. I can taste ice crystals in my throat when I try to swallow. They prickle the inside of my mouth, and the back of my tongue - the part where it can make a grown man gag. Causing me to cough as I tried to cry out in pain.

Instinctively I start to take off my gloves, but London reaches over and smacks my hands away from each other. He points to the thermal gauge on the screen. It's cold in here. So cold that if I took off my gloves and managed to get them wet, unprotected in these temperatures. My fingers would start to turn bright red as if they were on fire, as the cells in my skin would start to die. And in a few minutes under the right conditions, the tissue in my fingers would collapse, and I wouldn't be able to use my hand anymore. Amputation would be the only course of action.

Chloe pulls the med bag out from beneath her. The company was in charge of every detail in our missions. Even down to who sat where. London and I were expendable, that much was clear, for we sat on either side of Chloe, as two human meat shields. She pulls open a bandage and breaks a heating pad behind it before pressing it against my head; squeezing the frozen crust shut, causing it to bleed momentarily as it reopened. She pinches the edges along the cut, and I can feel the yellow fat lining the inside of my skin - bulge out as her fingers tuck me in like a stuck zipper. The freezing cold sealing my wound shut as if it had been welded.

"We'll have to stitch it when we get back," Chloe mouthed.

I nodded and waved a thanks just as London poured on the brakes. The tires skipped across the surface until we finally came to a halt. The engine shut off, causing the recirculating heat pump to sputter to a dead silence.

"We're here!"

"What?"

"I said this is the spot!"

"We're here?"

London nodded and pointed to a round disc on the ground. It was the size of a car in the shape of a manhole with an orange and green light blinking from a small antennae attached to the top. London started grabbing the equipment in the cabin as he motioned for me to open the door. I pulled the lever and pushed against the steel frame. The cold hit me fresh in the mouth. It felt like a metal needle on an exposed nerve, its hypodermic fang seeping lead into my body.

I climbed out onto one of the custom tires, the rubber on these things were taller than my knee. From the roof rack I began unloading footlockers filled with telescopic bits. The wind had grown stale, but it could pick up at any moment, so I moved quickly in case a freak blizzard sent giant bolts of ice raining down from the sky.

There was an expedition in 2002, where one of the researchers ran into an ice storm to retrieve a data set for the Larsen B Ice Shelf before its collapse. The data would have been the last chance for us to understand the geological impacts of the area surrounding Cape Horn, where the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific meet before it disappeared.

She was found several weeks after the storm had let up, less than 30 meters from her base, in a forest of icicles that stuck out from the Earth as quills on a porcupine, some thicker than a telephone pole. The data set folded across her chest, her legs still in the air as if running, with a spear of ice plunged between her shoulder blades and exiting her abdomen like a butterfly pinned in a book. Removing her would have cost a fortune, and leaving her served as a stark reminder of the dangers out here, but also as a symbol to the importance of our work. So they left her there, for better or for worse. With many lovingly referring to her as the Snow Angel, whenever they passed.

By the time I got around, London had already pulled the Dowler off the back of our crawler. The Dowler is the love child of Dr. Kelsie Grant, one of the lead engineers on the team. It stood about 15 feet tall when unfolded and was the only device that could dig into the Pixie Tubes. See, the problem with ice core samples had been that it would sometimes take years to drill deep enough, and if the drill were ever to stop, then the hole would either collapse or fill with ice in a matter of days. The Ross Research Foundation commissioned Dr. Grant years ago to solve this problem. She inserted braided pipes called Pixie Tubes down drilled holes and capped them on either side. So that when a new group needed samples, all they would have to do is pop off the top of the old one, drop the bit down the empty shaft and drill through the other side at the bottom in order to continue where the last group left off. Imagine a flexy straw suspended by ice down below.

"I got the first rounds," London exploded the canisters found at the ends of each leg, causing the stakes built within the Dowler into the ice. He lifted the tab on the last leg, and pulled the hard yellow ring, the C02 exploded and punched an arm worth of steel down. He slapped the back of the Dowler, "This thing isn't going anywhere."

I hauled over the disconnected drill bits to him, "Let's make it quick. The north face doesn't look steady."

"There's never anything quick about drilling," he shouted as the Dowler sits over the exposed metal cap in the ground.

"The data says we're stable," Chloe pulled her Canada Goose closer, "Bet you wish we were back at base."

"Any chance of us cracking through the tubes? Or worse! Splitting the ice and lopping off a part of the Shelf," I asked.

"It's bad luck to talk about the ice mate," London positions the drill over it until the cap begins to disintegrate. "We're through," he shouted as he turned to Chloe, "We can start on your mark."

"Remember! No faster than 2 meters per minute. Anything more and we could accidently rupture the braided lines without knowing it. And cause a pincer below our feet," she yells.

A pincer is a type of crevasse. A moving one. And it is one of my worst nightmares. Imagine standing on solid ice and then the ground suddenly disappears. Falling ten, twenty, hundreds of feet, hoping to be lucky enough to die on impact; instead of being trapped between two vertical ice sheets that are shifting to fill the void. The walls drift on sheer weight alone. It reminds me of early scuba divers who traveled too deep and were crushed alive. The water pushing in from every side and the air is squeezed out of their lungs before it all comes rushing back in through their mouths, gorging their bellies full of salt water until their bodies are equalized with the pressure.

"Wouldn't want that," London pulled his goggles over his eyes.

Chloe's watch beeped as the Dowler screamed its head into the ice. I watched the thing kick back fine grains of ice powder as it broke through the upper membrane that had been trapped inside. Flecks of ice shavings landed everywhere. The kind that was thin enough to melt from what little body heat could be found out here. If I didn't know better, I would think that this was the ice's way of protecting itself, fighting against us, in order to keep its secrets. See, getting wet out here is a different kind of danger unto itself. Even sweating spelled a certain death wish.

I looked up at the sun, it may as well have been a light bulb in the refrigerator. All it did was cause me to squint as I stared into the endless rows of ice ridges in the distance. Nothing could live here, things could pass by, they could cross, but this was truly the edge of the world.

"We're past the bottom cap," London shouted. Waking me from my daydream.

I checked the line feeding through the top of the Dowler, "We're still good," watching it feed up and over and then down, down below.

Chloe looked up from her laptop and confirmed, "The ice is steady."

London nodded briefly before grabbing the bars beneath the Dowler. "Lowering stands by 5 feet." The legs collapsed around the hole, reminding me of a king crab if it could squat. "Pushing through the end cap." I could almost hear it pop as the drill pierced into the ice on the other side.

The three of us looked at each other. I didn't know I had been holding my breath until Chloe broke the silence, "Here's to going where no one's been in over a million years," she shouted. I couldn't help but smile. She held up two fingers at me, "2 meters."

I nodded.

"Ice, ice, baby," London recanted.

I watched as the bits continued to disappear down the hole.

"How far did they want us to go," I asked.

"Company says we need another 20 meters."

"Twenty?"

Chloe nodded at him, "Yeah. We'll be here for awhile."

"Any idea what it is they're looking for out here," London asked. Bits of snow were already crusting the goggles on his face.

"Same thing as always. I'm guessing."

"Do they think it's unstable?"

Chloe shrugs, "Maybe they found something in the ice cores from before." She must have saw the look on my face because she laughed, "Come on, don't be that gullible. I'm sure it's nothing more than some atmospheric data that they need to feed into some machine."

She hadn't finished her words when a sudden snap cracks through the air. I didn't have time to process what was happening before I see the bits plummeting over the Dowler and down into the hole. "Shit!" I tightened the clamp around them, sparks flew as the brakes bite into the steel. "London!" I pulled the handle on the feeder to try and slow it down. It's no use, ice has coated the rods and it was slipping!

I looked up in time to see one of the legs on the Dowler collapse from the force of the drill falling, a gust of snow rose like smoke and traps London beneath the legs. I can see the horror on his face as he looks back at me. Almost see the fear in his eyes behind the reflective amber on his lenses before he disappears from view.

Chloe rushes to the cruiser and starts to pull out a tent. It's standard company policy, and a courtesy everyone in the south knows about. The few seconds of warmth here could save a life, even some limbs. As there was nothing else she or I could do except to wait for the debris to clear.

"London," I shouted again as I am finally able to reel the bits to a halt. I rush forward but Chloe grabs my arm. Parts of the tent still in her hands, "The glacier might not be steady," she yells at me. "Here." She tosses me a Kevlar infused rope as we huddle around the remnants of the Dowler. "In case it opens up. So we don't get separated."

I hear a groan as the steel moves. My feet back up instantly and I almost plow Chloe to the ground. She's grabbing onto my arm, her feet skittering beneath her as we try to get away. I can hear something splintering below me, it is a worse sound than any bone that I've ever broken. Almost like someone is chewing on teeth until they crack, right in my ear.

I try to mouth the words "Fuck," as the two of us scramble away. The Dowler collapses another leg. I think I hear someone screaming. I don't know if it is me. But when I look up, I can see a split in the ice, it ran from where the Dowler had stood to between my legs. I looked behind me and saw it stretched for over 10 meters before disappearing beneath the snow.

I was too terrified to move a muscle. Chloe's hand on my elbow felt the same way. I don't know how long we sat there, petrified. But when the clouds of snow had settled, we could see parts of the Dowler still above the surface. The cracks leading away from it weren't that deep, considering how thick the ice was.

"I think it looks worse than it actually is," Chloe whispered. I could still hear the hum of the Dowler as the electronics onboard hadn't shut off. "London," she called out.

"London," it seemed as if I suddenly remembered. I slowly got to my feet and edged toward the Dowler. A part of me wanted Chloe to stop me, but she let me go. As I edged closer I could see a bright red jacket poking out from under the snow. "I think I see him," I shouted back at her.

"Is he okay?"

I get on my hands and knees, until I am flat on my stomach and crawl toward him. My hand grabbing a sleeve as I start to pull. He didn't look to be breathing. I knew that the ice was thick, and we needed to move quickly. But we also thought it was thick before we started drilling. So I moved with purpose and slowly slid him forward.

When it looked as if I he were finally coming loose, I felt something snatch. I tugged on his jacket again and he wouldn't budge. It was then that I realized that he was twisted around, his knee must have broken in the accident. Creating an abnormal wedge in the snow. I turned him over with great effort, and was then finally able to pull him free. His body still limp by the time I got him over to Chloe. She immediately started tending to him, sticking hot pads into his jacket, under his arm pits and between his groin. I brushed off as much snow on him as I could, and with Chloe's help, I got him into the tent. Once inside we stripped him completely naked, drying any parts that we could find. He was wet down his back and all over his trousers. I could smell the urine on him as we worked quickly to stabilize his condition. Putting on a set of new clothes to warm him.

I don't know how long we worked for, but eventually color began returning to his face. The manual resuscitator was removed from his mouth as he started breathing again on his own. The two of us fell backwards on our asses as we watched him breath for awhile.

"Shit."

"Shit is right," I told her.

"We have to start heading back."

I nodded, "I've got to get the equipment first."

For a second she looked at me as if I were joking, but she knew as well as I did that this was the only Dowler on our side of the camp. The other two had went with an earlier expedition that wouldn't return for 2 more months. Which means that without it, there was nothing we could do out here. A waste of everyone's time.

I left the tent and observed the area around the Pixie Tube. The Dowler laid on its side like a fallen monument. Its yellow frame frosting over as the wind began to pick up speed. I inched closer to the Dowler until I was able to grab the handle. I looked down the hole and saw the bits mainly intact. The ice beneath us seemed to have stabilized. Experience told me that it must have somehow shifted below. Causing the bit to go into a freefall as it was drilling. The force of the bits being fed overhead at speed was too great for the legs, and it collapsed under the weight. It was a miracle that the ground didn't open up from under us. Even more of a miracle if the drill weren't stuck right now. Pinched between two adjoining sheets of ice.

I wondered if it was stuck, and I moved it, would it cause a ripple effect over the shelf? No time to think. The temperatures were already dropping and I could hear the wind speed flapping against the tent behind me. We had to move and get out of here fast. Off the ice shelf and back to the interim.

I reversed the lever and prayed when it began churning. The bits below crinkled as it began to come back up. I was glad that it wasn't stuck. I started collapsing and loading the spit out pieces back into the footlockers one by one. Everything was going better than expected as the bits started coming up. I must have gotten through 200 meters before I saw the steam rising from the Pixie Tube.

"What the fuck?"

I whirled around and saw London hobbling towards me.

"You should be resting."

"That's what I said," Chloe chimed from behind him. "But he said it's safer and faster if the three of us did it together."

London nodded, "It's procedure. And plus. I'm feeling better."

"Can't feel better with a broken leg," I looked down at the aluminum cast strapped to his thigh.

"The painkillers are working for now. I can't promise that in another hour." He grabbed one of the bits, staring at the smoke coming up from the hole. "And I'd like to be back at camp before then."

"What do you reckon it is," I asked.

The three of us looked on, not a word exchanged between us as the bits kept coming out. Watching the steam grow thicker with each tug, until the end was exposed, clearing the hole and clipping itself into the Dowler like a guillotine. We stood there in silence as our brains tried to make sense of what we were seeing.

"It's not mine," London said.

Chloe crept toward it, the steam still rising upwards. The drill head that had been covered in metal teeth like a worm being pulled inside out was now covered in blood. I watched it drip off the steel and onto the ice. It was red but thicker than any human blood I have ever seen, and it was still wet.

I don't know how long I had been holding my breath, but when my lungs couldn't bear the pain anymore, I inhaled and nearly choked on a lung.

"Do you hear that," London broke away. He leaned closer toward the hole. "Shh," he motioned at me. "Listen."

I tried to hold back my cough, straining my ears towards the hole. Hearing the whistling sound, a scraping sound, carving and gorging from down below.

"What is that," Chloe asked.

"Sounds like something spinning," I told her.

"Yeah," London nodded. "Yeah. Like a stuck bit down there that's still spinning. Except we got the whole thing out," he glanced at the drill head resting beneath the Dowler. Moving underneath the device until his head was nearly in the manhole. The drill pointed at his back like an arrow. "Hello?" The sound of his voice traveled down the tube. After a few minutes I could hear it echo back at him. "Damn that things deep," he looked up at us. Almost satisfied as he got off his hands and knees. "Alright. Let's get this thing back to camp to get some samples. Maybe we hit a new species or something. I don't know."

"What about that noise," Chloe asked.

London scratched at his chin, "When I was up in the Artic. We had nothing but a lot of free time. And firearms. Sometimes we would shoot at the ice. If we shot it at just the right angle, the bullet would spin like a top. It almost sounds like that. So I'm guessing. Maybe one of the cannisters fell down there and it went off. Likely still spinning from the force. It should be nothing. Now come on," he grabbed a footlocker, "Help me get this thing back to the crawler."

He hadn't finished his little speech before we all heard it. It was soft at first, but then it happened again.

"Hello," came a mimicry from deep below the ice. It traveled up the tube and froze us in our steps. The sound was unlike any human noise I have ever heard. It was thicker and harsh, like two flaps coming from the throat. It was almost like a parrot, like something pretending to speak.

I could feel my lower lip trembling as I looked behind us. "Hello. Hello. Hello hello hello hello helllohellohellohello," it came. Mimicking the speed of the drill as it repeated the last thing it had heard.

I didn't even have enough time to move before we started hearing scraping and rattling come from below the pipe. Something was climbing up. London fell as he tried running toward the crawler. Chloe had already yanked on the door handle and was rummaging through the cabin for the keys when I caught up with her.

"Chloe," I shouted at her. Grabbing her with both hands. "Chloe!"

"We have to get out of here," she screamed at me. "We have to go! Now!"

I shook her, "We have to seal the tube."

She looked at me for a second. I could see the fear in her eyes. Before she nodded, "Seal the tube. Seal the tube," she repeated.

I reached into the overhead compartment and pulled out the disc that had been attached above the seats. It was solid and nearly a hundred kilos. It was all I could do to push it out of the cruiser and watch it fall onto the ice with a thick thud.

"What are you doing," London shouted at me. He had managed to climb up the bumper, righting himself. "We have to go!"

I shook my head, "We have to seal it!"

London looked at the tube. It shook. "Fuck!"

He pointed at me to drag the thing closer, "I'll help you lift it when you're near," he shouted as he limped toward the opening.

I ran over to the cap, turned it so that the explosive welders on the back weren't being scraped on the ground as I dragged it toward the Pixie Tube. I could feel the sweat beading from my armpits, but there wasn't any time to worry about that now. I looked up when London started shouting at me to hurry. His mouth was open as a hand rested on the lip of the tube as he looked into the hole, it was now shaking so badly that it vibrated his entire body. The Dowler shifted and suddenly the drill bit came loose. It plunged downward, into the hole. Taking London with it.

I stared in horror as he disappeared. Nearly slipping on the drops of blood that had been on the ground from earlier. I abandoned the sealing cap knowing that I couldn't do it alone, and ran as fast as I could back to the crawler. Chloe was standing stiffly next to the vehicle when I pushed her inside. Her body was in shock as I started it up. The heat pump blasting us with frigid air as the crawler groaned as it came alive. I turned us around, the tires biting into the snow, driving as fast as I could toward camp.

The entire ride back I couldn't even face Chloe. Neither of us had spoken a word. Not even when we saw our few tents come into view, they stood in a makeshift order around one another. Their sides empty, indicating that the rest of our team weren't back yet. A part of me wanted to drive right past it and head back to McMurdo, the station. Where there were others, but I could feel the exhaustion creeping onto my shoulders. And knew that we needed rest and supplies, if we had any chance of making it back alone.

When I pulled to a stop and got Chloe into her tent. She finally broke the silence. I wished she hadn't.

"I saw something climb out." She grabbed my arm, "What if it was London? And we left him?"

I shook my head. Knowing that the drill had fallen on him, plunged him deep down that pipe. Knew that if something did come out, whatever it was, wasn't human. Even if it did bleed red. I tore off my boots and saw the blood on them. It still hasn't dried. "Get some rest," I told her. "We're going to need it."
