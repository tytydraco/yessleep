Like a claustrophobic fetus, it pushed itself from out of the rainy muck, *or was born of it* – I’m still not sure. I watched, disgusted, as it put itself together, or was put together by some invisible, external force. Spontaneous generation? The byproduct of random subatomic chaos? 

I’d been on my way from the library, had stayed late in the night to do some personal research – the topic of which is irrelevant for the moment – and had just made it to the street of my apartment when I saw *that thing* assuming form; stirring in the mud and filth.  

I stopped, just feet from the entrance, intrigued by the sight; clueless to its true, horrid nature. There was only one streetlight nearby, and its bulb cast a sallow glow over my side of the street. Spotlighting me, whilst leaving *its* birth behind a curtain of shadows.  

Drawn toward it, *pulled* to it as if attached by string, I left the safety of light and structure to investigate the weird phenomenon manifesting in the dark. I, a first-year student at the local college, still an ignorant child to the world and its secrets – its horrors. 

While it had been quiet before, gestating in the darkness, it now emitted a soft murmur as I approached. It *cooed,* like a bird, albeit one that had, somehow, attained the mechanical vocality of a robot. It sounded artificial, but not intimidatingly so; I was reminded of a toy, left out in the rain, the button responsible for its simple vocal features triggered by the wind…. 

I stood before it, baffled. I couldn't tell what I was looking at.  There was a shape, a form, but not one I recognized. Not one I could give name to. Dead leaves armored it, grime was its flesh, and yet to say anything else about it would be guesswork, baseless speculation.  

Part of me wanted to pick it up, to caress it; another part cringed, inwardly; sensed with an innate precognition the *utter wrongness* of it – the logic-defying unreality of its existence. 

I don’t know which part would’ve won – the choice was taken from me before I could act.  

The thing sprang up like a cat, having apparently finished its indescribable self-creation. It enveloped my head, pressed itself painfully against my skull. My screams were swallowed up, absorbed by its suctioning flesh. Every sound uttered was played back directly into my ears. The pain of this intra-cranial echo only served to make me scream more. I was caught in a terrifying and excruciating feedback loop. 

I struggled against it even as I deafened myself with my own screams. My hands tried to claw at it, to pry it away from my head, but my fingers couldn't find leverage. It seemed to shift and swell and deflate, deftly avoiding my grasp whilst simultaneously performing that horrible vocal playback. I didn't wonder how I was able to breathe. Didn't have the clarity of mind for such a thought. I wanted only to get the thing off – to silence the endlessly echoing shrieks. 

Eventually, it became too much. I’d disoriented myself in my thoughtless panicking, and finally fell to my knees in the middle of the street. I couldn't see, but vaguely knew that I’d wandered away from its *birthplace* beside the gutter. Dazed, enfeebled, I weakly slapped my hands against the horror. The blows sounded inside my skull, giving a thrumming baseline to my waning cries.  

Just as I was about to give in – whatever that would mean, I couldn't even imagine – I remembered that I had my phone in my pocket. As the thing pulsed atop my head, impressed itself flatly upon my face, I reached into my pocket and withdrew my phone. Thankfully, I’d chosen to have my biometrics as an option for unlocking it. With a singular focus I pressed my thumb against the screen until I felt the soft tremble of the phone unlocking. Muscle memory guided me to my dialer. Later on, I’d thank myself for having spent so much time using the damned thing.  

Blindly, I dialed 911. Panic threatened to make me vomit, but the stark fear of drowning in my own acrid bile kept my esophagus tight. I knew that I needed to get this thing off of me, regardless of whether or not I managed to call for help.  

Just as I was about to hit the call button, the phone was snatched from my hand. There was a *thud* against my head, and a faint light entered my vision.  

With newfound terror I realized that the skull-clinging parasite had absorbed my phone.  

I started screaming again.  

My scalp began to itch, and the inability to scratch it only pushed me further towards complete mental collapse. Meanwhile, the thing *played* with my phone, going through the menus and apps – a surmise based on the continuously shifting light before my eyes. I couldn't see what it was doing, only that it was doing *something. With intelligence, awareness of its actions?* I couldn't say. I didn't care. I’d been ready to give up, but the phone’s availability had rekindled my spirit. Now, despair seeped into my mind as the bodily intruder seemed to mock me with the very object that had given me hope.  

My whimpering – I’d lost the energy for screaming – was interrupted by a sudden sound, an unsettlingly familiar series of them.  

Numbers were being dialed. Not dumbly and haphazardly pressed, but carefully dialed in a measured sequence. This unprecedented display of intelligence silenced me, chilling me down to my rattling bones. A moment later, the hum of a call being placed reverberated cranially. I froze, my hands locked in useless claws. 

Whereas before I’d been desperate to make a call, I now prayed for the phone to die, or at least for the call to be dropped. But my hopes were dismissed, my fears actualized, when a voice answered the ringing.  

Seeming to emerge from the core of my mind, I listened as my mother – **the one for whom I'd been reading up on cancer** – asked if everything was alright. She coughed, and it was like a cerebral thunderclap. But even as I reeled from the sonic detonation, I shouted for her to hang up the phone. I didn't want her to have any kind of contact with this abysmal thing. But my protests went on unheard, instantly deafened by my head’s hijacker as they left my lips.  

In a new exhibition of its plainly sinister intelligence, it spoke to my mother – *using my own voice.*  

With perfect vocal mimicry it said, “Mom. I think you should just give up.” 

My mother coughed again – and I was again knocked nearly senseless from within – and replied, “What do you mean, hun?” 

My voice, appropriated without my consent, continued: “The cancer. I think you should let it win. You've been a terrible mother, a terrible wife. You don't deserve to survive this. Stop fighting.” 

I did throw up this time. *Thankfully,* the thing absorbed the filth, incorporating it into its own composition; or merely ejecting it externally – I don't know. The terrible things it had said, the *lies,* they sickened me, enraged me. My mother had been a wonderful wife, during my father's life; and continued to be an amazing mom after his death *and* after her diagnosis. She'd taken care of me, supported me through my grief, even as that evil began its inimical occupancy of her body.  

The shock – the undeserved hurt – in her voice brought my hands back to the parasite’s exterior. I clawed madly at it, stopping only to hear her mortified response. 

“Why would you…. why would you say that?” 

With a calmness that made me choke and gurgle in disbelief, it said, “Because it’s true. Just let it kill you.” 

The call was abruptly, coldly ended in the middle of her anguished gasp. 

I raged like an animal for who knows how long. Thought and sanity gave way to feral animosity. My hands rained brutal blows upon my skull, acting of their own primal volition; my body galvanized by sheer indignant fury. A word like Hate couldn't begin to describe the feeling I felt for that diabolical helmet.  

And yet it felt nothing. My attacks were fruitless. My ire probably fed it, acting as some kind of emotional nourishment for its wretched existence.  

Distantly, I felt more than heard the rapid approach of a car. Whatever was left of my sanity at that moment decided to take flight from my mind. All that remained of my psyche was a black animus for revenge. I needed to destroy this thing. Not for what it was doing to me, but for what it had said to my mother.  

My skin prickled, my instincts sensing the car, the danger it promised. I planted my feet in place, keeping my body rigid, willfully overriding its drive to move away. In a dark twist of irony, I found myself grateful for the thing’s bizarre imperceptibility. That, combined with my all-grey outfit, made me almost invisible in the night’s gloom.  

Presumably understanding what I meant to do, it tried to steer me away; jerking my head around as if in doing so it could command my body. But it was useless – I stood firm; my resolve unwavering. I sensed it panicking, as if we shared a spiritual or telepathic link. A warm glow filled my vision, supplanting the white glimmer of my phone’s screen.  

I think I might've heard the screech of tires on asphalt, but I'm not sure. A moment later, I was struck with such tremendous force that the pain didn’t even register until I’d landed. Lying there – impossible to tell if I was face up or down, feeling weightless in my blind agony – I felt the thing die with me. Our pain was shared. It subsumed my debility, made it its own, and spat it back in me when it could not handle it. Cyclic suffering. Recursive wretchedness.  

It died, truly. The dark, Stygian night that had been my vision opened, revealing a sky that was soothingly natural; a softer, welcoming darkness. Through the cavity that had opened in the dead thing I felt the chill air on my hot cheeks, and the comforting touch somehow stifled the body-wide suffering.  

With trembling arms – one of which would later learn had been broken by the impact – I peeled away the rest of the parasite’s corpse. It felt weirdly soft in my hands, like a pillow; and I was hit with a pang of embarrassment at having let such a seemingly delicate thing overwhelm me.  

I let the flaps fall sideward, and my hands with them. I surrendered to what I had thought was my own death, just as footsteps came rushing over.  

I'm in the hospital now. My wounds have been treated, my bones set, tears sewn, taped, and bandaged. The driver was drunk, had been speeding down the street after having spent a night at the bar drowning his own sorrows. The irony? His wife had just been diagnosed with a terminal illness. Cyclic suffering. He’s fine – is sitting in a cell, unharmed. 

My unusual response at this information – sardonic giggling - was attributed to the head trauma I’d received – which the doctors couldn’t account for, given its nature. I remember hearing confused whispering in my pre- and post-surgery hazes; the phrases, “Strange lacerations” and “suction marks” a few of several that had floated to me through the mental fogs. 

They hadn't recovered *it* at the accident site - couldn't explain the abnormal marks it had left on my skull and face.  

I spoke to my mother, who despite what “I” had said still cried and prayed for me over the phone. I tried to apologize, but she quickly dismissed the attempt. The guilt of what had happened, what she was callously told – *even though I wasn’t the one at fault* – tore at me, drained me of the energy my body desperately needed to recuperate. 

She said she’ll be by to visit me tomorrow, when her nurse can accompany her. I told her that I loved her, and that I couldn't wait to see her. I think she was relieved by that.  

I've spent the last few hours typing this out on my phone.  Somehow, it survived the impact.  

Someday, I'll share this with her. Let her know what really happened. If I tried tomorrow, she’d only think it’s a side-effect of the drugs I've been given, or the head trauma; and that’d only hurt her more. I don’t want her worrying about my mind *and* my body.  

I'll just have to think of a plausible explanation for that terrible phone call. Somehow, I’ll have to contextualize those vile words.  

I’ve never really thought about an afterlife, about Hell. But I hope that odious creature is burning in some flaming pit. Though I wouldn’t be surprised it was originally conceived in one.
