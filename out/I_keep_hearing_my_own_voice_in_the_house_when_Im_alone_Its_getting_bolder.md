I live alone. That’s what makes this worse.

It started with little things. You know how you sometimes think you hear someone say something, but you chalk it up to the wind, or your own thoughts bouncing around? That’s what I thought was happening.

Except it was my own voice. Whispering.

The first time, I was brushing my teeth before bed. Completely alone. No music, no TV on. Just silence. And I swear — I heard myself say, quietly, right behind me:

> “Don’t spit yet.”

Not loud. Not threatening. Just… casual. Like I was telling myself something I’d forgotten.

I froze, toothbrush still in my mouth, and turned around fast.

Nothing. No one. Just my sad little hallway mirror and the usual creaks of the house.

I laughed. Kind of. You laugh when stuff like that happens, right? Like, oh cool, I’m either sleep-deprived or going insane. Whatever. Moved on.

But the next day it happened again.

I was working from home, pacing the room while on a call, when I walked past the hallway and heard myself again, this time say:

> “Don’t look down the hall.”

Except I hadn’t been planning to.

But the second I heard it, I wanted to. It’s like someone planted the thought just to see if I’d do it.

So I did.

And… nothing. No one. But the attic light — which I literally never use — was on.

It’s one of those lights with the pull-cord? I never touch it. Haven’t even been up there in a year.

---

I got curious. Maybe too curious. I started leaving my phone on record overnight, just to see.

The third night, I caught something.

Around 3:12 AM, there’s some rustling. Then… whispering. Right into the mic. Same voice as mine. But not a dream. Not sleep talking. I’ve listened to it maybe twenty times, and every single time it chills me to the bone.

> “If you keep pretending it’s not real, I’ll have to take something.”

I don’t move. Don’t respond. Just… breathe.

I have no memory of that.

---

Things escalated. I tried staying at a friend’s house for a night — no weird dreams, no voices. Just peace.

But when I came back home, the bathroom mirror had writing on it.

Not marker. Not scratches. It was like someone breathed on the glass and wrote with their finger:

> “You took too long.”

That’s when I started sleeping with the lights on.

---

Now I hear it all the time. Me. Talking to me. Giving me warnings. Saying things I’d never say.

Once I was washing dishes, and it just casually said:

> “She’s going to knock soon.”

Two minutes later, my upstairs neighbor knocked. First time she ever has. Said she heard something — like a voice — through her ceiling, and wanted to check if I was okay.

I said I was.

I lied.

---

Last night, I got a call from my own number.

One ring. No voicemail notification, but the call log shows it. “Me.” No contact photo. Just… a gray circle.

I checked my voicemail anyway.

There was a recording. It was me. My exact voice. Just breathing for a bit, then:

> “Let me finish what you won’t.”

---

Today I opened my camera roll and there was a new video.

It’s of me. Asleep.

Then I open my eyes. But I don’t wake up. Not in the normal way.

I stare straight at the camera. Smile a little. Then walk toward it.

And the screen goes black.

---

I don’t know what the hell is going on.

I don’t know if I’m losing my mind, or if something is trying to become me.

But if I disappear — or worse, if I show up and seem off — don’t trust me.

Please.

Because I don’t think I’ll be the one behind my own eyes anymore.
