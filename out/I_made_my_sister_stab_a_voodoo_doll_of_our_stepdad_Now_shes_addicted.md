Mom forced me and my sister onto a “family” roadtrip with our new dork-ass stepdad so we could “bond” with him.

Instead, we decided to make him suffer.

We rode in the backseat. Ellie’s backpack sat between us. Quietly, she unzipped it and slid out the needle and doll. 

She wedged the doll between her thighs and aimed the needle at its ribcage. 

Her eyes snapped over to me.

I nodded and made a stabbing gesture.

Ellie inched the needle down, but stopped. She nodded to Dale’s hands on the steering wheel. *What if we wreck?*

I pinched a sliver of space between my thumb and index. *Just scratch him.*

Ellie tried passing it to me. 

This was my idea, but her handiwork. Last week, I snagged a strand of hair from Dale’s comb. Ellie stuffed it into some cotton and stitched an entire doll around it.

She deserved first prick. One way or another, I’d make her do it.

I cleared my throat. “Hey, Dale?”

Dale turned down the volume on his *Kenny G’s Greatest Hits* CD. “Hey champ.”

“Ellie was just expressing her interest in…whatever it is you do. Could you explain it again? Using, like, lots of detail?”

“Oh, wow,” Dale said. “Okay, yeah. Well, Ellie—as I’m sure you’re aware—every city has an archive of municipal records…”

Ellie snatched the doll back into her lap. While Dale rambled, she aimed the needle at the tender spot under its armpit. She gave me one last look.

I nodded. 

“...And you wouldn’t think it, hehe, but pipe diameters make a heck of a difference when—*”*

Ellie ever-so-slightly pricked the spot.

Dale released a blood-curdling scream and jerked the wheel, swerving into oncoming traffic. 

Tires screeched, car horns blared, vehicles blasted past at fifty miles an hour, missing by inches. Mom screamed. She reached over, caught the wheel, and yanked us back into our lane. 

The car jerked right, and my head cracked against the window. 

Cars around us honked and slammed their brakes to miss us. Dale wrenched the wheel and straightened us out, still hollering in pain. 

Mom screamed over him. “What the *hell* are you doing?!”

“Ohh, geez,” Dale said. “Ohhh. Ohh geez. Something’s wrong.” He cut the wheel and peeled off to the side of the road, skidding to a stop. 

He threw it in park and rolled up his shirt, flashing his pasty-white skin.

“What’s there??” he shouted. “What’s there??” 

Mom’s eyes darted across his skin. “I—I don’t see anything.”

“Something’s there!!”

“Honey, hold on. Let me look…no, nothing’s there.”

Dale examined himself. Then he dropped his head into the headrest. In the rearview mirror, I saw sweat beading on his forehead. His glasses fogged up. 

I thought it’d cause a little pain. Not almost kill him. I felt immediate regret. 

Mom turned to us, still catching her breath. “You guys okay?”

I nodded.

Ellie said, “Yup.” A blanket now covered her legs.

Mom turned back to Dale. “Should we go to the ER?”

“It’s gone now, I think. Just drive for a bit, okay?”

Mom nodded. When they opened their doors and stepped out, I glanced at Ellie. 

The blanket was off. The doll was in her lap. And the needle was pinched between her fingers. Ellie was grinning. 

“Ellie,”  I said. “Put it away. *Now—*”

Mom and Dale climbed back into the car. Dale leaned the passenger seat back and bumped Ellie’s knees. “Whoops, do you have enough room, sweetie?”

“Uh-huh.”

Mom accelerated us back onto the highway.

Ellie hovered the needle over the doll’s groin. Her eyes flicked back to me. 

I shook my head. A little grin formed on her lips.

She danced the needle up his pelvis, his stomach, and paused. On his throat.

*“Stop!!”* I mouthed. 

That only made her smile harder. A switch had flipped. A world of possibilities had opened. She inched the needle from his neck to his face. The point stalled over his eye. 

I reached over to stop her.

Mom exhaled. “You know, maybe we should go to the hospital.”

“No, no,” Dale said. “I’m okay now. But…that was bizarre. It’s like something stung me. Then my insides were on fire.” He forced a chuckle. “...And now the kids think their new dad is crazy. Don’t they?”

My hand was an inch from the doll when Ellie twisted her body. Blocking me. 

I reached around her, feeling for it. She swatted my hand. 

“Give it to me,” I said.

“I’m not done,” she said.

I jammed my knuckles hard into her side, knocking the wind from her. The needle clinked on the floorboard.

Then I caught the doll’s left arm and tugged it my way.

Ellie snatched the right and tugged back. 

“Did you guys hear me?” Dale asked. “I said, you guys think I’m cra—hey…what are you guys fighting about?”

Dale turned. His eyes locked onto what was in our hands. “Wait. Is that…”

Ellie and I yanked at the same time.

And a wet, warm explosion sprayed inside the car. 

Mom was blinded. Screaming. We slammed into a concrete median and scraped along until another car popped us, putting us in a tailspin. Mom fought with the wheel, but our momentum carried us around and around until we sank off the side of the road. We barrel-rolled, dropped, and smashed into a ditch. 

Everything blurred.

I remember mom crying. Something wet dribbled near the front seat. And, at one point, a sharp pain plucked at my scalp. 

Ten minutes later, firefighters cut us out. We were hanging in there upside down. Banged up, but alive. 

All but Dale. 

While an officer spoke with Mom, a paramedic bandaged my head. 

Somewhere behind me, one officer whispered to another that, for the life of him, he couldn’t understand how both arms were torn clean off. 

I looked around and spotted Ellie by the woods. She was sitting on the ground, hugging her knees, peering into the treeline.

I excused myself and walked up behind her.

“Ellie?”

She didn’t respond.

“Ellie, listen. I’m older than you. I’m supposed to be someone you can trust. But I…misled you. And Mom’s alone again. All because of...”

I paused to stop myself from crying in front of Ellie.

“Look. Just promise me something. Don’t blame yourself. If you need someone to blame, blame—”

A burst of laughter escaped her. “Promise you?” she said. 

Ellie stood and turned. 

The doll was in her hands. 

Its arms were stitched back on sloppily, like she’d done in a hurry.

“Here’s a promise. Every day, for the rest of your life, I’m gonna find a new way to make you suffer. Starting now.” 

Ellie smashed the needle into the doll’s eye. 

A bright flash filled my vision, and every vein in my eye coiled with the most extreme pain I’ve ever experienced. 

My legs buckled. I smacked the ground. Footsteps sprinted over and people shouted all at once. What's wrong? What happened to him?

“I don’t know,” Ellie said. “He just…fell.”

It’s been two years now.

730 days.

And every single one of those days, Ellie has fulfilled that promise.
