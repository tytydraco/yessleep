I’ll add a warning here for how graphic these get. 

I wasn’t supposed to get these papers I don’t think. 

The house had been condemned for years—nothing but a crumbling skeleton, hollowed out by time and neglect. It was just another job, another building to tear down and replace with something new. Nothing special.

Until one of the guys found the papers.

They were buried beneath the floorboards, stuffed between the brittle remains of rotted wood, sealed away as if someone had wanted them hidden. He almost tossed them, assuming they were just scraps, but something about them felt off. Unsettling. Like they didn’t belong. He didn’t want to keep them, said they made his skin crawl just touching them, so he passed them on to me.

I work at the library. People bring me old books, letters, things they think might have some historical value. Typical small town activities, anything that might be exciting getting blown out of proportion. Most of it is nothing. But this—this was different.

The pages were yellowed, brittle at the edges, covered in erratic handwriting that got worse the further I read. It wasn’t a diary, not really. No dates, no clear goal—just thoughts. 
Unfiltered, feverish thoughts. At first, it was just strange. The writer talked about the silence, about the isolation. Then the voices. The reflection that didn’t move. The house watching.

And then… it got worse.

Their words unraveled into something I can’t fully explain. A descent into madness? A glimpse into something that shouldn’t be real? I don’t know. I don’t even know who they were. No name, no indication of when this was written, nothing to prove they ever existed.
But their thoughts—what they experienced—felt too real.

I don’t know what to make of it. Maybe you will. I put them in what seems like chronological order.

Just… be warned… it’s a lot.

———

This house is quiet. Unnervingly so. The kind of silence that wraps around me like a heavy blanket, pressing down on my senses until even the smallest sound feels deafening. My own thoughts, usually drowned out by the relentless hum of the city, now echo in my head, louder and clearer than ever. Maybe that’s what I need—time to hear myself think. 

The constant barrage of voices, car horns, and sirens has become suffocating, filling every moment with a chaotic energy I can’t escape.
Even now, in this stillness, I sometimes think I hear them. Faint whispers at the edge of my awareness, like ghosts of the life I left behind. 

They disappear the moment I try to focus, slipping away into the nothingness that surrounds me. Maybe it’s just my mind playing tricks on me, struggling to adjust to the absence of noise.

I wonder if I should get a pet—something warm and alive, something to fill the space with soft sounds of breathing, the quiet padding of paws against the floor. A presence other than my own. But something deep inside me resists. 

The silence is strange, yes, but it’s also… comforting. It doesn’t demand anything of me. It simply exists, steady and patient, offering me the solitude I didn’t realize I craved.

———

I have lived here for a year now. A whole year of silence, of solitude, of sinking into the stillness that surrounds this house like a thick fog. It’s isolated, tucked away from the world, and sometimes it feels as if it doesn’t exist at all. As if I don’t exist. The mail stopped coming two months after I moved in. No warning, no explanation. I never asked about it, and no one ever asked me if I was still here. The phone calls stopped, too. At first, I checked my cell every few days, waiting for a missed call, a text, something—but nothing came. Eventually, I stopped looking. It was as if the house had severed the last remaining threads tying me to the outside world. And I let it.

I tell myself this is what I want. That the quiet is a gift, a retreat from the relentless noise of life beyond these walls. The house wraps me in its emptiness, and in that emptiness, I build my own inner kingdom of peace. A place where no one can reach me. No expectations, no intrusions—just me and the silence.

But today… today, I board up the windows. And the doors. I’m not sure why. It feels necessary. The hammer in my hand feels right, the nails sinking deep into the wood with a finality that sends a strange, settling calm through me.

And yet, in the suffocating silence, I think the whispers are getting louder. Maybe. It’s hard to tell. They don’t speak in words, not really. Just murmurs at the edges of my mind, slipping in and out of reach. Or maybe they have always been there, and I was just too willing to ignore them before.

———

The whispers are definitely louder now. No more fleeting murmurs at the edges of my awareness—no, they press in, thick and cloying, slipping beneath my skin like tendrils of cold air. Last night, when I went to bed, I felt them. Not just in my ears, but on my body, brushing against my arms, curling around my throat like unseen fingers. The sensation is unbearable—like the lightest touch of a spider’s legs, delicate yet undeniable.

I lay perfectly still, forcing my body into unnatural stillness, though every instinct screams at me to run. But where? There is nowhere to go. The house is sealed, and outside, there is nothing for me. Nothing but emptiness. So I stay, paralyzed beneath the weight of my own heartbeat, which pounds so hard it feels like it might crack my ribs. Each pulse sends a fresh wave of agony through my chest, sharp and rhythmic, as if something unseen is knocking from the inside, trying to break free.

I can’t see anything, but I know—I know something is there. Just beyond the veil of darkness, watching. Waiting.
The house sent it. I know that now. This place—it’s alive, and it’s trying to tell me something. 

But I can’t hear it. The whispers coil and slither through the silence, but their meaning slips through my fingers like smoke.

And I think… I think whatever’s waiting in the dark is growing impatient.

———

The silence isn’t so absolute anymore. The house creaks and groans now, like old wood stretching, like deep inhales in the dark. It shifts, restless beneath my feet. It breathes with me. I feel the wallpaper curling, pulling away from the walls in slow, delicate strips. I like to help it. There’s something satisfying about gripping the brittle edges, peeling it down in long ribbons, exposing the raw, pulsing surface beneath. It wants to shed its skin, I think.

And who am I to stop it?

———

One of the boards on the window falls today. 

Not all at once—no, it happens slowly. Deliberately. One nail at a time, each easing itself free with a sound like cracking joints and clattering onto the floor. I watch in silence, transfixed, as the wood groans, splinters, then drops to the floor with a dull, final thud.

The house does not like this.

The walls shudder, a deep, crawling groan reverberating through the floorboards beneath my feet. The air grows thick, pressing against my skin like unseen hands, wrapping around my throat, my wrists, my ribs. 

I feel its displeasure. It wants me to fix it, to seal the wound, to close the eye that has opened.

But at the very moment I reach for the board, ready to press it back into place, I know—I am not allowed.

The command hits me like a sudden drop, like plunging into ice-cold water. A presence I cannot name whispers through my bones, tightening its grip. No.

The voices are violent now, no longer soft, no longer patient. They snarl and writhe through the house, filling every empty space with their invisible noise. They hiss in the walls, slither beneath the floor, rattle the pipes with their fury. But I say nothing. I have no need to speak anymore.

And then, the light.

A single beam from the uncovered window spills into the room, striking the mirror in the corner. My eyes follow the glow, and there it is—my reflection.

It stands, still as death, bathed in that pale, sterile light. 

Watching. Unmoving. Unblinking.

I shift. Tilt my head. Lift my hand.

It does nothing.

It only stares.

———

I stay with my reflection today. It stares at me. I stare at it. Hours pass, but neither of us moves. It feels important—necessary—to be here, to witness it, to let it witness me.

The sunlight pours in through the broken window, sharp and unrelenting, and it burns. It claws at my skin, leaving behind an itching, prickling sensation, as if I am something that isn’t meant to be touched by the light. My eyes ache, watering, my vision blurring at the edges. 

But it doesn’t seem to mind. It stands in its glow, unbothered, untouched.

For the first time, I wonder what I actually look like. It has been so long since I truly saw myself. This reflection—it cannot be right. The thing in the glass is too vivid, too alive in a house so thick with silence and shadows. Its face is blank, lips unmoving, but there is something radiant about it. Its skin isn’t pale and sallow like I imagine mine must be—it is soft, warm, glowing. Happy.

That’s when I realize.

It is not me.

The thought settles into my mind like a stone sinking into deep water. And yet, I stay. The house hates it. The walls groan their disapproval, the whispers seethe, scratching at the corners of my mind, but I cannot leave it. Cannot move.

Not until the sun dips below the horizon, and the darkness swallows us whole.

———

I stay with my reflection again today. I don’t remember deciding to, but when I look up, there we are—trapped in this silent communion, locked in each other’s gaze.

The light from the broken window makes them clearer than ever before. My reflection. Not me.

The skin is wrong. Too stretched, too tight, as if something beneath it is pressing outward, eager to escape. There are cracks—tiny, splintering fissures spiderwebbing along the surface, some dark and dry, others wet and weeping. Their lips are slack, barely held together, trembling at the corners as if whispering something too soft for me to hear.

And the smile—oh, the smile.

Not a real one, no. Something else. Something carved into place, too deep, too wide, curving up just a little too much. I can see the wet gleam between their teeth, the way their gums pull back too far, exposing too much pink, too much red. The longer I look, the more I think—no, the more I know—that the teeth are wrong. 

Too jagged, too sharp, too many.

But they’re happy.

So happy.

Brighter, more vivid than anything else in this house of silence and shadow. So beautiful in their brokenness, radiant in a way I will never be.

The whispers don’t like it. The house groans, shifts, the very walls shuddering with discontent. It doesn’t want me to see this. 

Doesn’t want me to understand.

But I stay. 

Frozen in place, watching as my reflection does not move, does not blink, does not breathe.

Not until the last sliver of sun disappears, and the darkness swallows them whole.

———

I stay with my reflection again today. I don’t remember waking up. I don’t remember sitting down. I am just here, and so are they.

The light from the broken window drapes over them, making every detail unbearably clear. 

Their face—it’s splitting. The skin, too thin, stretched too tight, quivers at the edges like wet paper about to tear. Some places already have. Small, gaping fissures bloom across their cheeks, the corners of their mouth, down the length of their throat, revealing raw, glistening meat beneath. I think it drips sometimes, but only when I blink.

Their lips have started peeling back further today. I wonder if they’re trying to tell me something. The teeth underneath are too long, too uneven, crowding their mouth like tombstones in a forgotten graveyard. Some curve in on themselves, others look like they’ve been shoved in at the wrong angles, jagged and protruding, hungry to break free. Their gums are pulled taut, wet and blackened in places, receding like the tide pulling away from something rotting on the shore.

The smile never falters. It only grows.

They are so beautiful.

They are color in a world that has become nothing but shades of silence. A masterpiece of broken flesh and grinning bone, radiant in their ruin. I want to tell them, to reach through the glass and hold them, but the house is screaming at me now.

The walls moan like dying animals, the floors shudder beneath me, nails straining and groaning in their wooden beds. The whispers aren’t whispers anymore—they are shrieks, howls of rage, of warning, of fear.

But what do they know?

They do not understand.

I can see so clearly now.

I stay. And my reflection stays with me. Their eyes—glassy, bottomless pits ringed with something dark and leaking—never leave mine. 

They are watching. Waiting.

Then, the last sliver of sun disappears beyond the horizon. 

And they finally move.

———

I need it I need it I NEED IT.

It is impossibly beautiful. Perfect. A creature of raw, unfiltered divinity, sculpted from suffering, bathed in ruin. It lives beyond the skin, beyond the brittle, useless shell of bone and sinew and filth we call human. The flesh is never meant to contain it, never meant to hold something so vast, so endless, so holy.

I see it. I watch it happen.

The body cannot hold. 

The skin stretches, splits like overripe fruit, sloughing off in wet, peeling strips, curling back to reveal the thing beneath—shimmering with wetness, writhing, twisting, bending in ways that should not be. 

The ribs crack next, one by one, slow at first, then all at once, bursting outward like a gaping, jagged maw. They bend wrong, bending forward, backward, curling in on themselves like the petals of some grotesque, blooming flower.

The limbs—oh, how they fight. 

The fingers snap backward, knuckles twisting until the bones pop free, dangling like broken marionette strings before merging, melting, reforming into something new. The arms bend—fold—too many joints, too many angles, curling, lengthening, writhing as if they have minds of their own. 

The legs convulse, jerking, the knees splitting open to reveal something slick and shifting beneath. The neck goes last, stretching, elongating, vertebrae cracking one by one, until the head lolls, the jaw unhinging, opening wide, wider than anything should, wider than anything could, revealing layer upon layer of gnashing, serrated teeth spiraling down into darkness.

And the eyes.

They are everywhere.

They blink and roll and dart, glassy and bulging, seeping something dark, something wrong, something that should not exist. They see everything, and I want them to see me.

It visits me at night.

It calls to me in the dark, whispering its name through the walls, the floorboards, the very air I breathe. It presses its vision into my skull, burning, searing, branding me with its knowledge.

It is coming.

I see it standing atop the broken world, towering, infinite, a mass of writhing limbs and churning mouths, devouring, consuming, becoming.

I need it I need it I NEED IT I NEED IT I NEED IT I NE

———

That’s where it ends.
The last page cuts off abruptly—mid-sentence, like the writer was interrupted. Or maybe they simply stopped. There’s no signature, no final words, just a jagged tear along the bottom of the page, as if the rest was ripped away. Whatever happened to them, whatever they saw, whatever they became… we’ll never know.
And the house?
It’s gone now. Nothing left but dirt and dust, soon to be buried under concrete and steel, erased like it was never there at all. Maybe that’s for the best. Maybe whatever lingered inside those walls should stay forgotten.
But I can’t shake the feeling that some things don’t just disappear.
Some things wait.
