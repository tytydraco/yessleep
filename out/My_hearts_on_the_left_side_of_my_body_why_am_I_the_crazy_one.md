There’s no rational way to start this, so I’ll just start from the beginning and try my best to make you understand where I’m coming from. Please, if there’s anyone who doesn’t think I’m crazy, please reach out, please tell me I’m sane and the whole world’s crazy, please.

My name is Martin Alberstran. I turn 54 in October, and last week I had a heart attack. I guess that’s where I should start, the day of the heart attack. I’m sure you wouldn’t like to hear about my riveting career as a Postal Clerk at a mid-sized processing facility, or about my kids who seem to have lost my cell number, or my wife, who has felt like a sister rather than a partner for the last 15-ish years. I bore even myself with my life; God knows what it would do to you people.

It was 8:15 in the morning, the same time I’ve woken up every day for the last 30 years. I’d seen that clock on my bedside table reading “8:15“ more than I think I had seen my children’s faces. Most people just feel dread about something like that; I don’t. I see dependability, I see something that’s unchanging. Every day, anything can be different, anything could change, but not that clock, not time. I woke up and grabbed the robe my wife laid out on the foot of our bed, I lazily slung my arms into the sleeves and tied the sash around my waist.

As I walked downstairs, I smelled fresh coffee and bacon. Doctors have been telling me to lower my cholesterol, but I always told my wife, “I’d rather die with a steak in my mouth than live with chickpeas and lentils.” That’s more or less what happened that morning.

It starts like indigestion, a dull pressure in the chest. But it grows heavier, like an anvil crushing you from the inside. The pain spreads to your arm, your jaw, hot and sharp, while sweat pours down your skin.

You can’t catch your breath. Your heart stutters, misfires, and it’s after all this that it hits you that something is terribly wrong. The room blurs, sound fades, and you clutch at your chest, struck by a terrifying certainty that your own body has turned against you.

My wife started dialing 911 the moment I hit the ground; I remember resenting her for not dialing sooner. I don’t remember much after it, not coherently enough to transcribe it at least. I remember paramedics, vaguely being hauled onto a stretcher, and the hospital lights moving quickly in and out of my perception as I was hurried into a room I couldn’t name. Machines beeped insistently, hands touched me, voices spoke too quickly, too urgently. I tried to answer, tried to speak, but all that came out was a garbled rasp.

Once I was stable and of conscious mind, a doctor made his way into the room to give me the rundown. He tells me the basics: that they caught it in time, that I’m stable, and I need to be monitored closely for the next couple of days.

The days went by staying in the hospital. My wife and I didn’t talk a lot, but she never left my side. If the roles were reversed, I would’ve never left hers. A lot was wrong with our marriage, but our attachment to each other was never one of them. She was there just as my heart was in my chest.

The doctor came in and greeted me and my wife. He asked a few questions, told me that I’m about good to go and just had a few more boxes to check off. He turned his attention away from me and began speaking to his nurses. He turned back to me and requested an X-ray of my heart. I, of course, obliged and had the X-ray taken. As I was waiting for the results, my wife was grabbing my hand tightly. It felt foreign, but I welcomed it. I don’t know if she was just doing it to offer support or if she might’ve thought she lost me and was grateful I’m not dead. I’d like to think the latter. We’d been in a romantic-less relationship for as long as we had been romantic, but I remember how we used to be; it was nice to remember. Maybe if things hadn’t turned out how they did that day, we might’ve finally addressed things and repaired our broken marriage.

Suddenly, I feel her grip tighten up. I turn my head to look at her face, and she’s mortified. I ask her what’s wrong, and she doesn’t reply. I follow her eyes and I see the X-ray technician’s face; the look in his eyes still haunts me. Any look other than a blank stare would be extremely concerning, but his face was a different story. I saw his eyes roam the obscured X-ray chart with unmistakable horror and unprecedented confusion. I just stared blankly and reflected on my life. Did I have any regrets? Not particularly. But did I have any remorse that my existence was marching toward a much sooner than expected end? No. No, I didn’t.

The X-ray tech finally pulls himself together and runs out of the room, most likely in search of the doctor. I held my wife’s hand tightly and lied to her. I told her everything would be okay, that I would be okay. I think it was okay to lie in that situation; the lie was to protect her, not me. I told her I was sorry for being the man I was, for not loving her how I should. Maybe that was a mistake, because as soon as the words left my mouth, she became a fully incoherent mess of sobs.

The X-ray tech brings the doctor and a few nurses back to the room. They huddled around the chart, each of them going pale. The doctor’s reaction was the one I was looking for; he was clearly a very composed man. You have to be in a field like this. He sees horrors and tragedies daily that are beyond my comprehension. That’s why his slack-jawed expression felt like a dagger in my heart, finally finishing off my suspicions. He just stared at it. They all mumbled amongst themselves, loud enough that I could comprehend they were panicked, but not loud enough that I could hear them clearly. I hugged my wife and lied to her again.

The doctor approached us solemnly. I just asked what came to my mind: “Is it cancer? Clogged valves? Blood clots? Is any of it treatable?”

He waits until the words have fully left my mouth before he replies stoically, “Mr. Alberstran, there’s not only no easy way to put this, there is no way at all to put this. It’s your heart…”

I awaited my death sentence.

The doctor patiently said, “It’s on the left side of your body, Mr. Alberstran.”

While I gave him a look of utter confusion, my inconsolable wife excused herself immediately.

At this point, I’m full of relief and rage. “Is this a joke?” I spat out with venom.

The doctor gives a look of understanding, like I’m in denial and he’s having to get the severity of the matter across. Except I don’t see an ounce of severity in the situation. I humor him and allow him to continue without launching into a tirade. I’m still anxiously awaiting him to drop a bomb.

He says, “I know this is… how do I say this… irregular, Mr. Alberstran, but it isn’t just your heart. It’s everything: stomach, pancreas, spleen, right lobe of the liver, descending colon—it’s all on the left side of your body, and vice versa. I saw your medical chart; you have no health conditions that I could find that this might have affected, so the heart attack could be unrelated.”

At this point, now that he’s fully gotten the point across, I’m really relieved and really pissed. “You just scared my wife half to death to tell me my heart’s on the left side of my body? Who the hell do you think you are? What bomb are you going to drop next? That I have two eyes and a nose? All while you gossip with your nurses like I have a clogged artery in front of my wife!” I’m fully worked up now; given my heart attack three days prior, this was probably an unwise reaction.

The doctor is shocked by my reaction, somehow even more dumbfounded than when he saw my chart. “I don’t think you’re understanding the severity of this. I’m going to print off a copy of this chart for you to take home. You seem to be fine, and on paper, this condition shouldn’t affect you directly. I would just highly recommend you take this to a cardiothoracic surgeon, maybe even a human anatomist.”

I’m too confused by the situation to provide a retort; he’s already getting up and walking toward the door anyway, so I let him leave without asking any more questions. I didn’t go to college, but I took a biology class in high school. The heart is on the left side, the pancreas and spleen on the left side. Why is that so insane?

My wife and I drove home in silence. I couldn’t get a read on how she was feeling, but I knew that she was too confused and scared to be questioned.

“The doctor said I should be fine, ya know? Aside from the kook bullshit about my organs being on the side they’re supposed to be, he seemed to think everything else is under control. I might have to slow down on the bacon though, honey.”

She didn’t speak. She almost did, but she had this face of annoyance at me. The fact that I’m so calm about all this is more disturbing than whatever she’s disturbed about. We creep into our driveway, and she doesn’t waste any time getting out of the car.

I follow her into the house. “Will you just talk to me? Why are you being like this? I’m healthy!”

“Healthy?” she incredulously spat out. “Your heart is on your left side, Martin!”

I’m confused and annoyed. “Dammit, honey, not you too? What the hell do you mean my heart’s on the left side? That’s where it’s always been, yours too!”

I tried to hide it, but I was scared. Either I had gone insane, or the doctors, the nurses, the X-ray technicians, and my own wife were all crazy. I don’t know which was worse.

While I’m zoned out thinking about this, she pulled out the chart the doctor printed off. The doctor also printed a standard sample X-ray. She held them both up right in my face. “Martin! Something is wrong here, and something is wrong with you for not acknowledging it.”

I just stared at the two charts. Each one is a mirror image of the other.

It’s been a few days since then. I don’t know what’s real. All I know is that I am not crazy. I remember laying my head down on my wife’s chest, hearing her heartbeat, feeling her heartbeat. It was on the left side of her chest. That’s just how it’s always been. It can’t be any other way. I refuse to let it be any other way. I haven’t spoken to my wife since she showed me the charts. I’ve tried searching for anyone who remembers the heart being on the left side, anyone sane like me, but there’s not a single result. So I came here. I just need someone to say I’m not crazy. Just one.
