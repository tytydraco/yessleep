**Part I – The Weight of a Golden Boy**

William Don Lonly was born under the kind of light that made everyone around him expect greatness.  
Tall, bright, handsome — he was the golden boy of his little town in Sri Lanka. Teachers praised him, friends envied him, girls adored him. When he topped the national scholarship exams and gained admission to one of Colombo’s best schools, his family saw his future laid out clear as day: *doctor, wealth, prestige*.

William once dreamed of that too. But as he grew, the brilliance others worshipped began to feel like a cage. He loved history and archaeology, the dusty smell of forgotten stories, the thrill of uncovering ancient secrets. Yet his parents forbade him from “throwing away” his talents on art and relics. They wanted a doctor, not a dreamer.

So he obeyed. He studied biology, chemistry, and physics — and hated every second of it.  
He passed his exams well enough, but not well enough for medical college. The disappointment was devastating. His relatives mocked him. His parents treated him like a broken promise. His friends drifted away. Even the girl who once adored him stopped calling.

For the first time, William understood what failure felt like — and it burned.

He wanted to disappear.

So he wrote a note — *“I will never say goodbye to ungrateful parents like you. You will never find me.”* — and left home with stolen money, determined to end it all at Foul Point in Trincomalee, where the cliffs dropped straight into the deep blue sea. Ships that sank there were said to vanish forever. That’s what he wanted: to vanish.

But he never made it. He couldn’t. Shame dragged him home. His parents found the note and beat him senseless. His mother’s anger turned to hatred. His father never looked at him again.

Years passed. William built a modest life — a job, a marriage, a house. On the surface, he looked stable. Inside, he was hollow. His wife’s obsessive habits grated at his nerves; his mother’s resentment poisoned every meal. He lived quietly, miserably, pretending to be content.

Until one day, his office arranged an outing to Trincomalee.  
And as fate would have it, they stood atop Foul Point — the same cliff where he once planned his death. The sea below glittered, calm and endless. Memories came rushing back. He thought of his wasted years, his failed dreams, his quiet hatred for everything his life had become.

Before anyone could react, William stepped forward — and jumped.

  


**Part II – The Fall That Never Ends**

Wind screamed in his ears. The world spun. He braced himself for the shattering impact —  
but it never came.

William opened his eyes.

He wasn’t dead. He wasn’t alive. He was *suspended* — hanging in the air between the cliff and the sea, as if time itself had frozen. Above him, his coworkers ran in panic, tiny figures shouting and pointing. He smirked bitterly. *At least they’ll remember me,* he thought. He cursed them, cursed his wife, cursed his mother, letting years of venom pour out of him.

Then he noticed the silence.  
No wind. No sound.  
The sea below was still — perfectly still.

And then came the voice.

“Oh, William… I expected you much earlier. But at least you are here now.”

It wasn’t loud. It was *inside him* — a deep vibration that rippled through his bones.  
William spun around in panic. “Who are you? What’s happening? Am I dead? Am I in hell?”

“Neither,” the voice replied, calm and cold. “You are between heartbeats — not dead, not alive. Forgotten by time. You stand at the edge of your own making.”

William’s throat tightened. “If this is some dream, end it. If I’m dead, then let me *die*.”

“Is that what you truly want?” the voice asked. “To end without understanding why?”

“Understanding what?” William barked. “That my life was a joke? That everything I did was for nothing?”

Silence stretched — long enough to make him feel small.

Then the voice changed, softer now.

“You have walked this path before, William. Once, you died in fire — as a soldier of the sea. You fought bravely, but you cursed your fate even in death. You said, *‘I do not accept this ending.’* The universe listened.”

Images flashed before William’s eyes — water, smoke, the deck of a naval gunboat, the blinding light of an explosion. The taste of salt and blood filled his mouth.

He remembered.

He was a naval officer. He had died years ago in Trincomalee Bay when a suicide craft rammed his patrol boat. The explosion tore him apart before he even realized what happened. His last thought had been rejection — *“I don’t accept this.”*

And somehow… that defiance had rewritten reality.

“I gave you another chance,” the voice said. “You lived again — this time as the man who jumped. Two lives, two endings. You stand now at the border between both.”

William trembled. “Then what happens now?”

“Now, you choose. Accept your fate, and rest. Or return once more and try again. But be warned — exploit my generosity again, and you will belong to me. Forever. A slave of destiny, bound to relive your failures without end.”

William’s heart pounded in the void. His mind was chaos. Could he truly start again? Could he change anything? Or would he only make the same mistakes in different forms?

He looked down at the calm sea below — and thought of the cliffs, the voices, the people who never understood him.

“What would you do, William Don Lonly,” the voice whispered, “if you had one last chance to rewrite your story?”

And as time began to move again, the sea shimmered — and the world shattered into light.
