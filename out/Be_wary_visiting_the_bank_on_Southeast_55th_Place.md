In the midst of acheiving my 4-year neuroscience degree, I made the executive decision to take a gap year, in order to study avian psychology through my own research and expeditions.

I've always been fascinated by birds. Well, one bird in particular: crows. I knew from the get go that crows are incredibly smart, and through this I had made the determination to perform various observational studies on the birds, in order to truly dissect how and why they underwent their daily operations. What I have found in these studies has left me in a harrowing predicament: whether to accept the close of my gap year with grace, and return to college with my findings, or whether I must take additional time off to further my research, and dig myself deeper into the trench I have excavated at a terrifying rate.

I began by following the crows on foot. I soon realized the creatures' flight patterns were unpredictable, and rendered it impossible to catch up with them. So I executed plan B: planting microchips in a bowl of food, and leaving it out for them. I made sure the chips were concealed and could be ingested quickly and easily by the crows. This led to the study of the subject I dubbed Crow One, as I do not have the means to grant my subjects with proper titles. 

The use of microchips meant that I could follow my subjects by car. Crow One performed many circles but eventually settled in a corner of my local park. Upon further inspection I located the nest in which the bird resided, along with several of its comrades. I observed a total of nine crows crowding around the nest, which sat in the apex of a large trees' branches. I attempted to detail the sight further by using my zoom camera, but the angle at which I sat was inadequate for clear observation. 

I remained in the same location for two and a half hours, watching the crows scuttle around something I could not see, something I assumed to be crow eggs or crow babies, though the mature crows' behavior would have been strange in that regard. The only resources I observed them bringing to the nest were varying sizes of sticks and woodchips, which they placed inside the nest, as if it was empty.

And eventually, each crow departed from the nest one by one. It was nearly dark by now, and I decided at once to climb the tree. 

The tree was not easy to climb, as it had a very large, wide base, but I had anticipated this, and manuevered my way up by fastening a rope around the tree, tying the ends to the harness I bore on my abdomen, and letting my arms and legs do the bulk of the travel. It was a tremendous climb, but at last, I was nearing my prize. I moved my rope around one of the tree's branches, with some difficulty, so I could observe the nest from above. 
I turned on my flashlight and shined it towards the nest. 

Within the walls of the nest, instead of eggs, lie a tan sheet of cloth, fitted to the inside of the structure. On top of the cloth lie an arrangement of sticks, tens of hundreds of tiny little sticks, ordered in a familiar pattern of squares and lines. Within one of these squares there were two woodchips that had been placed in an "X" shape. I made the stark determination that I was looking at a map. 

I opened up my navigation app and, to my horror, it displayed a near perfect replica of what I was seeing inside the nest. In place of the woodchip "X", on my phone's map, was the bank. To further my unease, I received a notification that Crow A was coming home earlier than anticipated. 

I quickly snapped a picture of the nest and scrambled to untie myself and quickly slide down the tree. I received a few splinters on the way down, but made my escape just as I heard Crow A and his comrades encroaching upon the nest, in a hasty flurry of squawks and wings flapping. 

At once I felt very threatened by the events that had just ensued, and ran head over heels through the darkness and back to my car. I drove home in silence, letting the absurdity of the situation fill the empty space.

I reviewed the photo when I returned home, half expecting it to simply vanish once I decided to observe it again. But alas, it stood there waiting to taunt me. 

At once I pondered what I might do with this information. This is precisely why I have turned to this subreddit, as although I am revealing something very critical to potentially a vast amount of people, I feel miles more uncomfortable explaining my situation to my friends or colleagues, as I believe they would jump to question my whereabouts, and would find a hard time believing I didn't plant the configuation myself.

Unfortunately I believe the only resolution to this scenario is simply waiting for something to set into place, while continuing my observations, and reinstating my technology once the chip has passed through Crow A's digestive system. I am unsure as to what might happen, but I bare a terrible unease for what might lie ahead. 

As to why this is the community I have chosen to bring awareness to my discoveries: If I am not to be taken seriously, my story will be regarded as a farce, rather than a vile attempt at dissuasion towards those of higher status than myself.

If I do, regrettably, decide to return to college and abandon all control of the situation, I will leave you with a warning.

Be wary visiting the bank on Southeast 55th Place.

I am waiting in terrific anticipation. I may return to the nest in the next few days, but I need some time to think.
