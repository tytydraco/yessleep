 “And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.” - John Donne, “Death Be Not Proud”

What comes to mind when you think of “summer camp”? Seriously, picture it for a moment. Dirt-packed trails winding to extraordinary vistas. Canoe paddles splitting cool lake water; blurs of arrows whooshing toward their straw targets. How about withered sorcerers with Faustian deals, blight-poxed armies of the undead—gnawing the bones of campers, and a touch of demon possession? No? Well, I can’t blame you, that’s not what I had imagined for my first time at summer camp either. 

However, before we get into that, you should understand how I got there. I’m the only child of an heiress and her husband. My estranged grandfather inexplicably left all of his wealth to my mother when he died. I never knew the man, and the means by which he acquired his fortune is a bit dubious. Something to do with Wall Street and the Stock Market, and if my mother is any indication of how he conducted himself, then I would imagine the word “ethical” was nowhere to be found in his vocabulary. 

The best word to describe my parents before they went from rags-to-riches would be “charlatans”. Snake oil salesmen—if you will. They peddled all the garbage you would see on infomercials late at night, going door to door or setting up shop in parking lots. The junk your confused grandparents buy, then gift to you. We lived out of bags, always on the road, but I don’t remember much from that time—just a blur of highways and motel rooms. 

When the money came in, things slowed down—a little bit. I was able to attend school, now that we could afford a form of semi-permanent residency. I started school sort of late, but I caught up quickly. I’m a bit of a bookworm, owing to the fact that I never stayed anywhere long enough to make friends. Not to mention the obvious awkwardness that comes with poorly developed social skills.

I’d complete a semester at one school, then we’d move on a whim to another state, and I’d have to start all over again. My parents were always chasing something—some new trend or new lifestyle experience. With the money they had, they never needed to worry about working again. So all they cared about was reinventing themselves, buying their way into prestigious societies, or joining new spiritual awakenings. They enjoyed the luxuries of wealth, but inevitably the material world lost its luster, and they desired something “deeper”.  

We started attending various churches—and I kind of liked it. I understand that religion isn’t for everyone, but going to church felt like the most normal thing in my life. Even though every congregation was a sea of strangers, they always made us feel like old friends. It filled the emptiness in me that ached in silence. I finally had a sense of belonging. For a while at least.

My parents believed they felt something too, and in typical fashion, they had something new to chase. Thus began the great "church shopping” era. Previously, we just went to any typical Christian church that suited them that day, but that wasn’t doing it for them anymore. They were desensitized to the conventional forms of worship, and needed something—well—different. Scientology, various versions of paganism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Wicca, etc. And the most pertinent to our story—Mormonism. 

They became born-again—whatever that means in the Mormon faith—and rooted us firmly in an affluent Mormon community. How should I say this? Mormons are fine people, I suppose, if not a bit eccentric, but that way of life is just not for me. However, I had no choice in the matter, as I never did. I was now a Mormon, and that was the new life my parents had designed for me. Which coming from them was quite thoughtful.

I always felt like a third wheel to my parents. I never got the impression they hated me—they certainly never abused me—but I couldn't shake the feeling they were eager for me to move out so they could send me postcards from their new beach house in some far-off utopia.

I suppose that is why I retreated to my fantasy books. I read all of the big ones you’d expect a young teenager to read in the early 2000s. They brought me a lot of comfort, but they simply provided an escape. I was always trying to escape my life, of which I had no agency. No friends. The reluctant passenger of someone else’s destiny. Perhaps that was for the better.

When my parents learned of the summer camp that was operated by our new church, it was like their prayers had been answered. They began planning their vacation the moment the pamphlet entered their hands. A vacation from me, I mean. Of course I was going to camp, and I was going to have a good time. They assured me of that. They even teased the idea of making new friends. As if I even had old friends.

Truth be told, I think I was ready for a vacation away from them too. Their youthful eccentricities and wanderlust aged me more quickly than most. I was an “old soul”, or that’s what adults called me as a gentle way of saying “boring”. Boring was perfectly appealing to me, and if I needed excitement it was only a few page turns away. I yearned to move to a quiet little town, and live a boring little life. It’s ironic just how far from boring my life has now progressed. If only we were the type of Mormons who have reality TV shows, then perhaps things would not have ended so…violently.

My parents waved me off as I hopped on the bus; not realizing that it would be the last time they saw the son they thought they knew—for what returned even I struggle to fathom. When we arrived at the campgrounds, I was immediately seduced by the vast ocean of sagacious trees. In the shade of their branches, I bathed in the tranquility and was allured by the rustic secrets their leaves concealed. I felt at home, for the first time in my entire fourteen years of life. However, lingering beneath the surface was the inkling of unease. The bottomless feeling of unknowing and the anxiety it breeds.  

“Okay campers, let's line up by age. Youngest on this side over here!” a flamboyant male voice boomed over the megaphone, as the last kids exited the bus. The sharp command had abruptly pulled me out of a dream-like trance. “Great, welcome to Camp \[REDACTED\]! Here you will be reborn into something special!”

I scurried to the line with kids my own age, head down and too nervous to make direct eye contact. Fortunately for me, I had mastered the art of making myself nearly invisible. Too boring to bully. The other kids were preoccupied with reminiscences of years prior, anyway. I was blending in, for now.

The counselors blew their whistles, and the marching began. We moved with military precision to the mess hall, like Caesar’s legions through Gaul. I did my best not to step on anyone’s toes. The rest of the camp came into view as we advanced onward.

I could now see the picture-perfect lake with a delightful little island in the center of it, and an archery range, which sent a jolt of unexpected excitement through my body. The grooms at the stable were hand-feeding the horses as we approached. The cabins were a standout, exuberantly colored, depicting scenes from the Book of Mormon. Murals of Jesus Christ surrounded by “Lamanites” and “Nephites,” tribes of Israelites who supposedly sailed to America. Yes, I’m being serious. And the cherry on top: a huge bronze statue of Joseph Smith, which stood resolutely outside the mess hall. Beyond the camp was forest as far as the eye could see. 

I had to admit—even with the Mormon motif, this camp was nothing short of impressive. I was starting to warm up to the idea of summer camp. Hell, I might even like being a Mormon in time. It’s not like I had anything else going on in life. And just when I thought things couldn’t get any better, they did. 

As I was taking in my surroundings, I locked eyes with a girl. I had seen plenty of pretty girls before, but none had started my heart like she had. Her look was indifferent—”nothing special”, like me, but it felt so intense. My cheeks burned hot, and my eyes dove straight to the ground. At once I felt excited and embarrassed. It was excruciatingly delightful. I was bewitched by her hazelnut hair, and deep brown eyes that made me feel at home—like the trees did. When I looked up again, she had disappeared into the horde of kids cramming through the double doors. My heart ached from her absence, like a dog parted from its master. But that feeling was quickly overridden by claustrophobia, as the walls of kids closed in, funneling me through the doorway.  

The mess hall was larger than I had expected, and comfortably accommodated the small army that occupied it. It screamed “rich kid camp” all right. Nothing seemed old or worn down. It was a five-star restaurant designed to look “traditional.” The illusion of the type of camp mess halls you see in movies, but with the comfort of the Four Seasons. I wasn’t complaining.

“I’m so glad to see all of your happy shiny faces again this year!” the man said from the center of the room. “I’m Tony, in case you didn’t know. And I’ll be your camp director this summer!” The man's closed fists rested on his hips, beaming gleefully under a big olive-drab hat that made him look like a dorky scoutmaster.  

“Hi, Tony!” cried all but me.

“We even have a new face with us this summer!” he said, and all at once every head turned in my direction. I must have turned scarlet, a shade far from invisible. My head instinctively moved down. “Aw, don’t be shy, friend! Let’s all give him a big welcome!”

“Welcome!” thundered every voice in the room, save for mine. This was borderline torture. I felt as if I were about to burst into flames. I got tunnel vision and felt a bit faintish, but luckily Tony spared me. 

“Awesome! We have so many fun activities planned this year, but first it’s time to meet your bunkmates at your new cabin!” Tony cheered. 

Everyone hopped up at once and lined up in front of the counselors assigning the room and board. After a few minutes of waiting, I reached the front of the line.

“Name?”

“David,” I said meekly.

The counselor scanned the paper on his clipboard for only a brief moment before saying, “Lion cabin.” I nodded and stared at him, awaiting further instruction. He stared at me as if he were waiting for me to say something. He leaned over to look at the kid behind me and said, “Name?”

Feeling like a fool for the umpteenth time that day, I picked up my bag and got caught in the stream of children pouring out of the double doors. They scattered in all directions, excitedly marching to the cozy cabins that peppered the tree-laden hillside. I ambled along, awkwardly approaching each cabin, searching desperately for any sign of a lion. Finally, toward the top of the hill, I found my quarry. A freshly polished wooden sign read “Lion of Judah.” A painting of the majestic creature stood vigilantly beneath the lettering.   

I took a deep breath, unsure of what to expect on the other side of the door. But much to my surprise—and relief—there was no one inside. The easing of my burden was fleeting, as the feeling of loneliness crept back in. Everyone knew one another and all had their own little groups and cliques. Somewhere out there were my bunkmates, likely on some new adventure to start the summer. Without me, that is.

I plopped down on the only open bed; the springs screeched under my weight. I dropped my bag by my feet and sat there quietly. *Now what*? And without missing a beat, my thought was answered.

*Knock-knock-knock!*

A quick succession of rapping came from my cabin door.

“Come in,” I squeaked, completely caught off guard.

The door swung open, and Tony strutted right in. 

“Well, hey there, David. Just getting settled in?” he asked. I nodded. “Good,” he said in a gentle voice. “I just wanted to let ya know if you need anything, please don’t hesitate to ask. And…if you are unhappy with your rooming arrangements, I can fix that too.” He looked slightly concerned. 

“Oh, uh, thanks. I think everything should be fine though.”

“Okay,” he said with the gentleness usually shown to the bereaved. “The guys are…well, they’re good boys, but they’re a bit different. And if you feel like it’s too much, we can find you a new cabin with more “normal” bunkmates.” 

There was a brief pause as I tried to interpret Tony’s words, to understand what he wasn’t saying.  

“What do you mean by different?”

“You’ll see,” he said, gently patting me on the shoulder before departing.

I sat there now dreading the return of “the guys.” If Tony sought to soothe my worries, he failed incredibly. My mind flashed with all types of images of my new bunkmates. I thought of 1950s greasers wielding stilettos, Punks with pointy blue mohawks, and even grunge kids in flannels reeking of patchouli. I wondered if I was ever going to fit in with anyone.

I got up to investigate my new home and quickly realized it was just as decadent as the rest of the camp. We even had a luxurious bathroom with running water and a shower. I was so relieved I wouldn’t have to do my business in an outhouse all summer. Honestly, I would have been happy just spending most of my days in that little cabin reading. That’s what I should have done. 

After a while, a voice boomed over the loudspeakers outside, “Hello campers! After you get settled in, head back to the mess hall for a delicious dinner! How does surf and turf sound?”

The hiss of feedback followed Tony’s voice as he switched off the mic. After my ears recovered, I picked myself up off my bed and made my way back to the mess hall. I decided to take a book with me. Might as well read something while I eat. 

I made it about halfway there before someone stopped me.

“Hey, new kid!”

I turned around to see a blonde boy, roughly my age, running toward me. He was the type of jock every nerd wished he could be. You know, the type that dates the prom queen, then plays football in college. An all-American hero whom the ladies swoon over. Some of his buddies followed and circled us.

“Hey man, what’s your name?” he asked genuinely, as he held out a hand. I hesitated. My heart rate picked up when I saw him and his gang rushing toward me, but it calmed a bit as I shook his hand in relief. 

“David,” I said in almost a whisper. 

“David?” he repeated. I nodded, and he continued, “Cool, man! I’m Patrick. I just wanted to say hey and give you a big Camp Lazarus welcome!”

“Oh, thanks, that’s really—” but before I could finish, Patrick abruptly shoved me. One of his buddies had crouched down behind me, and I went tumbling backward over him. My book got flung onto the dirt trail as I fell. 

“What are you reading?” Patrick asked as he snatched the book up. He thumbed through it, reading excerpts in mocking voices, then showed it off to his cronies. They snorted and chortled at the geeky tome. “Nice book, nerd!” He shot the book just like a basketball, right into a trash can. They laughed and high-fived each other, leaving me beet red in the dust. Some of the other kids around me laughed, and others looked disgusted, but everyone avoided me like the plague.

My cheeks stung in embarrassment, but I got up, and without looking at anyone, stumbled over to the trash. We hadn’t even been at the camp for two hours and somebody had already puked into the trash can. I tried wiping it off on the grass, but that just smeared it around. I felt like crying, just like the little wimp I was. I had been so careful before to fly under the radar and avoid bullying, but I guess it was inevitable eventually. 

I walked over to a water fountain, and cleaned the vomit off as best I could, then made my way to the mess hall with my stinky, soggy book.        

I sat at a table alone, but at least everyone was back to ignoring me. That was a comfort. And Tony wasn’t joking about the “surf and turf.”  I was served a succulent red lobster tail paired with a perfectly cooked eight-ounce ribeye. A part of me yearned for cheap hot dogs roasted over a campfire, with s’mores for dessert, but lobster and steak were fine too.

Upon exiting the mess hall, I was given a cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows. Some of the counselors had set up a table where they poured the brew for all the boys and girls. The sun was fading, and night was quickly enveloping the grounds in its shade. But burning in the fresh darkness were several campfires, each with its own little circle of campers. Some counselors played instruments and sang. One circle even had a puppet show for some of the younger kids. I made my way to a more secluded fire near the woods.

Slowly but surely others joined me. We sat quietly for a time, sipping our chocolate, until one of the kids said, “Have you guys ever heard the tale of ‘The Witch of the Woods?’” The fire cracked in response and embers shot up into the night. 

“It’s ‘The *Lich* of the Woods,’ you idiot.”

“Well, what’s a lich anyway?” 

“It’s kinda like an undead wizard,” I piped up excitedly and involuntarily.

The song of crickets followed my words, filling what would otherwise have been an uncomfortable silence.

“Nerd!” a kid called out, and I shrank back down.

After some laughter, the boy resumed his story, “Okay, ‘The Lich of the Woods.’ A long time ago, in the old country, there was a magician who fell in love with a princess. Every day, the magician would seek out the princess and try to win her heart with his magnificent tricks. He was often chased off by her retinue, and sometimes even roughed up, but eventually she fell for him too.”

Some of the kids made gagging sounds and the girls giggled.

“Their love was forbidden, of course. She was a noble, and he was always on the verge of being accused of witchcraft. However, that ceased to be a problem when the princess unceremoniously died of fever. The magician was absolutely devastated. The king was furious and blamed the magician for her untimely death—branding the magician an agent of Lucifer! They chased him out of the kingdom the very night the princess died. After some time, he returned to live on the fringes of its domain—but he was different!” the boy said, doing his best Vincent Price impression. 

The other campers were quiet, absorbed in the tale.

“The magician had sought out black magic. He traveled to ruins whose names had been long forgotten to time, and did unspeakable things. Graves were robbed, sepulchers were defiled, and crypts—late at night—echoed with chants of the most profane nature. Whispers of a necromancer permeated the kingdom. Plague and famine spread over the land as if it were punishment from God for the necromancer’s desecrations. Many in the kingdom believed it was directly the result of the magician’s dark sorcery.” 

 Every kid now hung on the edge of their seats.

“The king ordered his men to seek out the necromancer to make him answer for his villainy. And at once, all of the knights rode out, scouring the land for the magician. It didn’t take long for the knights to find him. They discovered him in a mausoleum, performing a ritual over the decaying corpse of his beloved, the late princess. But before they could apprehend him, he ensorcelled them, and made his escape—taking the corpse with him. He traveled the lands in exile, continuing his pursuit of dark magic. He even learned how to make himself immortal through a blasphemous ritual. And thus the magician became a Lich. Centuries passed, and he was eventually driven out of every kingdom, nation, and country. So, he fled to the new world.”

“What’s the ‘new world?’” one kid asked.

“He means America, moron,” another kid replied

“Don’t call him a moron!” a girl fiercely demanded. I realized right away it was the girl from earlier. Suddenly, a different sense of fear gripped me. A most pleasurable one, but my stomach full of hot chocolate and lobster was starting to churn. 

“Can I finish my story please? Anyway, the Lich traveled to America. But it didn’t take long for him to be accused of witchcraft and exiled to the vast wilderness. He haunted the wilds of the mysterious new world for many years, eventually finding his way to these woods. They say he started this camp so he could have access to fresh victims for his evil rituals.” 

He pulled his shirt over his head and said, “His undead minions dress in black robes and snatch up campers in the middle of the night!” 

He stood up, cuffed his hand around his ear, and said, “And if you’re really unlucky and hear him calling the name of his beloved ‘Lenora! Lenora,’ you will be next!

“Lenora! Lenora!” a voice howled from the trees beside the fire. The kids gasped, and Patrick jumped out from behind the tree laughing. “You should have seen your faces! That was too easy!”

My blood boiled, wishing it were the actual Lich, not Patrick. Anyone but Patrick.

Some of the kids grumbled, and a girl said, “That story has always been lame.” She stood up and went to sit by the boy who had been spinning the yarn. Her eyes glinted in the firelight, and she leaned forward and whispered, “Besides, the camp isn't run by some crusty old wizard. It’s controlled by a satanic coven of witches and warlocks called “The Midnight Cult.”
