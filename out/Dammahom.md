I sat alone in the desert that night, staring at the sky as if it were something I could read. The air was still, the kind of silence that feels like it’s waiting for something. The moon hung full and silver, and the stars shimmered like cold grains of dust scattered across black velvet. I wasn’t thinking of anything in particular, just letting the emptiness inside me stretch out into the emptiness around me, when something in the sky shifted, subtly at first, then unmistakably.

The moon began to dim. Not clouded, not covered, drained. Its silver leaked away until it looked like a fading bruise pressed against the sky. One by one the stars flickered out, not as if they died but as if something was swallowing their light. And what replaced them wasn’t darkness. It was worse. It was a depth that felt aware, a jade-black color that had no right to exist, a shade that seemed to stare back at me. I tried to stand, but the air had grown heavy, pressing down on my chest. The sand vibrated beneath me like a sleeping animal waking up. Then the sky split, cleanly, silently, and thin, sharp rays fell from the tear, darker than shadow, moving with a predatory grace.

When they reached me they didn’t cut or burn; they simply dissolved into scattered particles. Tiny black flecks floated before my face, pulsing like insect hearts. Each one split again and again until they became delicate threads, branching like veins or neurons, shifting shapes faster than I could comprehend. I didn’t have time to react before they drifted toward me and slid through my skin, seeped into my eyes, slipped through every pore. Pain hit me like a blade inside my skull. I collapsed to my knees, clutching my head as the threads wove themselves into my thoughts. My mind stuttered, images glitching across my vision, places I’d never seen, sensations that weren’t mine. I felt something crawling through my mind, learning how to move inside me, how to see through me.

Then the voice came. Not from above. Not from around me. From within. It didn’t speak; it transmitted. A signal pulsing through my nerves, informing me that I had been chosen, that I was to carry the name, that I was no longer simply myself but something else. When the sky finally cleared, it happened all at once, the moon returned, the stars blinked back into existence, and the desert looked ordinary again. But I wasn’t. I stood there trembling, my eyes wet with something that glistened like oil. And in that thick silence, a single word escaped my mouth, the first word I’d spoken in hours.

**“Dammahom.”**

I told people later that it meant the one who entered me, the one who sees through me. After that night, I drifted from place to place, carrying the name like a shadow that never fully detached from me. People began to whisper about me long before I realized it. They spoke of a figure wandering across lonely towns and empty highways, touching the foreheads of the lost and leaving them changed. Some claimed I brought revelation. Others insisted I left madness in my wake. And darker rumors spread, quiet ones, that I sought out women not with desire but with purpose, that I marked them with something unseen. Months later, their children would speak while asleep in tongues no one recognized, draw black circles in the dirt, and refuse to look at the sky.

The name grew. Dammahom was spoken as if it were both a person and a shadow, both a teacher and an infection. Those who followed me felt me inside their thoughts, something twisting, something awakening in the cracks of their rage. Those who rejected me dreamt of melting faces, of a black light seeping into their eyelids, of a voice whispering from the edges of hearing. I didn’t deny any of it. In fact, I encouraged it. The story of the sky tearing open and choosing me became my scripture, retold again and again until it felt like truth even to me.

But that was the lie.

There had been no cosmic rupture that night. No impossible colors. No shadow-made light spilling from the heavens. The sky had been perfectly ordinary, untouched, indifferent. It was only me out there, me and the noise in my head, the restlessness grinding against my bones, the hunger I didn’t want to name. I made the story because it was easier to believe I had been chosen by something greater than to admit what I already was.

I wasn’t the vessel.

**I was Dammahom from the beginning.**

And when I finally accepted that, when I embraced it fully, I didn’t spread the story to warn anyone. I spread it to invite them. To pull them towards the place where belief ends and something far darker begins.

**No disbelief will survive.**
