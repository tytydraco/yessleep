Before we get into the story I must tell you guys some backstory. The events told                 
within this story is completely true, even to the last tiny detail. Additionally, I would like to say the comments are gonna be turned off on this post. Reason being the point is not discussion, but to bring awareness on how movies can have horrific effects. Now I will tell you about myself. I am former CIA agent Robert B. Grahams, code name Rollo 14 under the Directorate of Analysis. I was the head of the secret Task Force 6145, our objective was to research the effects of entertainment on people's minds. This in itself isn’t bad, but… the experiments and purpose of our research were… horrific. 
At the beginning the experiments were simple. We used simple meta-analysis to prove.          
the theory that entertainment affects people's view on reality and their attitudes towards (Kubrack, 2020). After reporting our findings to the higher ups, they changed our focus to how entertainment affects people's view on foreign countries. So we conducted an experiment where we made some youth watch movies about foreign countries, and then surveyed their opinions towards the country. The results indicated that the movies had affected their views on the foreign countries (Kubrak, 2020). Following this conclusion, the executives put pressure on the task force to drastically increase the intensity of the experiments. Furthermore, they demoted me from my position of leadership and took full control of the task force experiments. After the change, we forced our test subjects, death row convicts, to watch propaganda movies about foreign countries. After the change in test subjects, we weren’t certain that the movies would have the same effect, because personal factors are generally the basis in which people are influenced by the movies (Kubrack, 2020). We forced them to watch these movies for a duration of 24 hours every other day for an entire month. Then after an entire week we questioned them on their opinions. The effects of the experiment were shown within the first week. We asked questions about their opinion on the countries. They answered in a way that showed negative-leaning opinions. The next week the results showed completely negative opinions on the foreign countries. In the third week something seemingly snapped. Through the questions the inmates showed an indifference towards the countries portrayed in the films. When asked about their feelings towards the leader of the country they responded with, “yeah, he is okay”. In the last week of the experiments the subjects became completely unresponsive to the questioning.  We recorded  these findings and brought them to the directors.
 After receiving the data, they issued our orders.  We would repeat the experiment                
three more times.  After I received the orders, I quickly replied that I wouldn’t follow through since it was wrong. They immediately coerced me by the use of threats. Using my family as their means, I didn't dare refuse. So the experiments continued for three months. At the end of the three months the experiments finally came to a close. Abruptly the task force was dissolved and every member of the force was forced to sign an NDA about the research that we procured. Obviously in me posting this information I’m violating my NDA but I must tell you about the research purpose. 
The month following the conclusion of the experiments, cataclysmal events began                     
to erupt in the Middle-East; cities bombed by terrorists, people of leadership assassinated, places of worship destroyed, and utility grids completely broken. There were an estimated 200,000 dead and almost twice that missing. These events were truly gut wrenching themselves, but what was truly horrifying was when they showed the pictures of the perpetrators. Every single one of them were the death row inmates we had experimented on a couple months prior…
