The drive to Drury was long. I spent what felt like hours twisting through narrow country roads and it was giving me a headache. The car seat was too uncomfortable for these long-distance journeys and I was longing to get there as soon as possible. Just as the sun was starting it’s descent into the horizon, the sign announcing my arrival came into view.

It was a beautiful quiet afternoon as I drove up to the small bed and breakfast I used to walk past every day on the way to school. I checked in and unpacked the car, just a suitcase and my jacket. I really didn’t know how long I’d be in town as Jack didn’t give much away on the phone. He just said I’d want to take a few weeks off work and he’d explain everything to me in person. As we weren’t going to meet until tomorrow, I decided to take a walk around before dark and get an early night.

I walked down the road and over the railway tracks. I passed by the park we used to in and the area was like a ghost town. There were always kids playing out here round this time, whatever day of the week it was. I continued past my old house and soon inexplicably found myself stepping onto Landing Lane. I walked past the old sign on the cul-de-sac and went far enough up the path that I could see the trail leading off towards the river.

I looked at it and chuckled, remembering that night thirteen years ago. But I still didn’t go down it. I turned around and headed back to the bed and breakfast for the night.

The next morning, I got up, got dressed, and around lunchtime I drove down the road to the local pub where I was due to meet Jack. I parked, stepped through the door and there he was, waiting in the doorway.

“Jack! How’ve you been?” I said.

We shook hands and exchanged greetings. It had been a long while since we last saw each other. We walked over to a table and sat down.

“Alright then Jack,” I said, “What are we doing down here?”

Jack sighed. “I found out something,” He said, “About this town.”

“What is it? What’s going on?” I asked.

For the last few years, Jack had been a social worker for the local councils in the area. He didn’t live in Drury anymore either but he wasn’t as far away as me. Anyway, Jack explained to me that while looking through some case files, he discovered a report of a twelve-year-old boy from Drury who had disappeared around ten months ago. The strange thing, he said, was that there were virtually no news stories about it, no large manhunts, and the official explanation was that the kid ran away from home in the middle of the night.

Then he dug deeper.

He found another case, a little over two years old. Same story, this time a ten-year-girl. No news, no trace, ran away in the night. All in all Jack found a total of nine cases dating as far back as nearly twelve years, all missing under the same circumstances. No one was talking about them.

“Wow,” I said when he was finished, “That’s a hell of a story Jack.”

“Do you believe me?” He asked.

“Yeah, of course,” I said, “It’s just a little hard to stomach, you know.”

“Yeah, I haven’t slept much the last few weeks,” He said.

“So is this why you wanted to come back here? To find out what happened to them?” I asked.

“I know it sounds like a long shot, but we know this place. I think we can learn something and I know for sure I can trust you.” He said.

“Trust me? What are you getting at?”

“Why isn’t this national news? Something weird is going on in Drury and I think it’s being covered up.”

“I don’t know,” I said, “None of this feels right to me.”

“Me neither. But I need you for this. Will you help me?” He said, “For old times’ sake?”

I sighed and put my head in my palms.

“Of course.”

Jack and I decided to start by calling up as many of our old friends as we could find numbers for. We stood out in the parking lot and spoke to maybe a dozen people between us. Most of them had moved out of town years ago, and like us, none of them had heard about any children running away from home in the area. I’m sure they all thought we were a little crazy for asking them what we did but it was the best lead we could think of. In fact the only one who was still in Drury was Rachel.

Rachel was one of the few girls in school we ever exchanged more than a few sentences with. She was tall and smart and had the kind of crude sense of humour you usually only see in twelve-year-old boys. Neither of us had seen her since leaving school but her number still worked and she might know something we could go off. We arranged to meet her in person, that way we could explain our findings, but she wasn’t free until the weekend which was four days away. That was fine, we could kill time with more research.

Since Jack had already exhausted what little information the internet had to offer, we went down to the local library to see what we could find the old-fashioned way. It was a large building for a small town; the original had stood since 1927 and had been modernised about thirty years ago. We walked the stone steps to the door and found a computer that could be used to access an archive of local and national newspapers dating as far back as the 1700s. Our belief was that at least one of them had to have a mention of one of the missing kids.

We spent all of that afternoon trawling through article after article in paper after paper, turning up nothing. We did this for most of the next two days, until around five o’clock on the Friday afternoon, something piqued our interest.

It didn’t have anything to do with our mystery on the surface, but it was the first truly odd thing we came across. Tucked away in the corner of a page was a short paragraph with a headline and no pictures.

***Railway carriages disappear.***

*On the morning of the 21****^(st)****, one eagle eyed dog-walker was out by the river past Landing Lane when he noticed the disappearance of the railway carriages. Originally built in the 1910s, these cars have sat undisturbed on the disused railway track for around the last twenty years, a common sight for those walking the path by the river. “I find the whole thing thoroughly strange,” Said the man to our reporter, “There were here when I walked past the other day and now, they’re gone without a trace!”*

When I was around five or six years old, my father took me for a walk down Landing Lane. He was an amateur photographer in his free time and he brought me along to take pictures of those old train cars, sat abandoned and reclaimed by nature. Reading this article brought back the memory, and I could see them in my mind clear as day. I was never down there enough to notice that they’d vanished.

I told this to Jack and he had no recollection of them at all, but he agreed that it was strange. Having no other leads until Saturday, we decided to go down there and find where the carriages used to be.

We wasted no time in driving to Landing Lane. I parked the car in the quiet cul-de-sac by the sign and we stepped out onto the path we hadn’t trodden for thirteen years. We took the turning onto the trail, followed it along the river and crossed the bridge. I glanced over at the forest as we took the right turn away from it and kept walking with the river.

It wasn’t long before we found the spot we were searching for. You could see the top of the tracks on the other side of the water where the train presumably used to run and as was usual to us, they were empty. There was no path on that side of the river, but I for one wanted a closer look. We walked back and crossed over the bridge again, this time climbing down the other side. We had tread carefully across the steep grassy banks, but we managed to reach the tracks without falling in.

“Here it is,” I said, “Not sure there’s much we can do here now.”

We trudged around looking at the tracks. They’d been abandoned for decades and were now just rusty bits of metal left to fester in the grass.

“Hey, do you know where this track went?” Asked Jack.

“No, I never really thought about it before.” I replied.

“I was just thinking, I’ve never seen any other abandoned train tracks anywhere in town.” He said.

“Yeah, me neither. You want to see where they go?”  
We walked across the grass, stepping over rotten sleepers, guided by the tracks. After a while the dark fell and I stopped recognising where we were. Since we didn’t bring any flashlights, we had to rely on the pale full moon to guide us.

“Do you remember last time we were here after dark?” Jack said.

“Of course,” I laughed, “When we came out to find that monster.”

“Yeah, the… Gnawbone wasn’t it called?” Said Jack.

“Oh yeah, that’s right…” I said.

“Remember that building we found? Man, that was creepy.” Jack laughed.

“Yeah man,” I laughed, “Did you ever go back there?”

“No, you?”

“No.”

Eventually the track turned under a bridge I’d never seen before and disappeared into an underground tunnel. We stopped short of it and stared into the dark hole.

“I figure it carries on through there then,” I said.

“Shame we didn’t bring any equipment, I really wanted to know where it led,” Said Jack.

“We could go down and see if we can see the other end of the tunnel?” I said.

We walked down into the entrance of the tunnel. There was no light visible from the other end. As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I noticed something unusual.

“Are you seeing what I’m seeing?” I asked Jack.

“Is that them?” He said.

On the track, a short way down the tunnel, stood six or seven abandoned train cars. Even in the darkness you could see the peeling paint and rusted metal. Without exchanging a word, Jack and I walked over to them. It was dead silent.

The door of the first carriage was open, and I could just about make out some writing across the top of the doorway. It looked like it was made with spray paint. I climbed up the few steps in front of the door and got my face as close as I could.

“Waiting room,” I said, “It says ‘waiting room’.”

“Must’ve been teenagers,” Said Jack, “This is probably a good spot to hang out for them, we would’ve if we’d known about it.”

I stepped through the door and Jack wasn’t far behind. It was a passenger carriage with rows of bench seats down either side. I walked between them, my eyes adjusting to see better with each step. The cushions on the seats had a faint criss-cross pattern, and some were covered in holes that looked like had been made with a blade. I thought it probably was a popular hang-out for bored teens.

We walked through the open connecting door and went through several carriages that all looked the same as the first. Then we arrived at the last one. This was also a passenger carriage lined with seats, but the one at the far end was different. I had to do a double take when first saw it.

“Woah, look at this!” I said.

Jack caught up and leaned in for a better view. Several large brown stains covered the seat.

“Is that blood?” I said.

“Can’t be sure,” Said Jack, “But it certainly looks that way.”

He dragged his fingertips across one of the patches of brown.

“It feels like it,” He said, “Wait, there’s something on the floor.”

He leaned in towards the floor and came up with something in his hands. As I stared at it, I realised it was a small stuffed giraffe toy.

“Are you seeing what I’m seeing?” I said.

“This is seriously weird,” He said.

“Do you think it has something to do with our investigation?” I asked.

“I don’t know, I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere before,” Said Jack.

“Was it mentioned in one of the case files?” I said.

“Maybe… I can’t remember.”

“This is getting creepy,” I said, “Let’s get out of here.”

We walked back to the first carriage quicker than on the way down. But when we finally reached the door, it was shut.

“What the fuck?” I said, “This was open!”

“Shhh,” Said Jack, “Is there anyone outside?”

I peered through the smudged glass window but I could barely see a thing in the pitch blackness of the tunnel.

“I don’t think so,” I said, “It’s hard to tell.”

I tried the handle and it wouldn’t budge.

“Locked. Is there anything in here we can use to break the glass?” I said.

Jack went over to one of the windows in the aisle. He stuck his fingers under the bottom managed to tug it open.

“Squeeze through here,” He said.

It was a tight fit, but we managed to force our bodies through the opening and landed on the ground outside the carriage. Without wasting a second, we sprinted out of the tunnel and didn’t slow down until we were sure no one was following us.

We walked back along the tracks, listening for anyone who might come up behind us. We climbed back up the bridge and onto the trail, following it back to the car in the cul-de-sac. We got in and could finally relax and as we drove down the main road. The cool night air rushed in through the windows.

“Well we found those carriages. How the hell did they get there though?” I said.

“Maybe driven down the track? No idea who would wanna do that.” Said Jack.

We were driving past the old park when we heard something through the window that sent a chill up my spine. A few kids were out late, one of which was chasing the others around the playground. He was yelling: “The Gnawbone’s gonna get ya! The Gnawbone’s gonna get ya!”
