Hi, my name's Simon and I don’t believe in the supernatural. I’ve never been spiritual or anything like that. I don’t care if someone else holds those beliefs, but it’s just never penetrated my human experience. Its always felt like the world is a flow of motion, and one day your motion just stops. I think my friend is still alive up there. Maybe he’s become mentally ill from being up there so long I don’t really know. I felt really hesitant even making this post, but there’s not a lot of options I guess. 

I’ll start from the beginning. I will not disclose any specific details but I live in the Northwest. My family and I moved up here from New Mexico when I was only 5 years old. It couldn’t have been better for me. I found my love of nature, hiking, hunting and fishing. All things that weren’t a huge attraction back home. 

The massive trees and the river systems carving their ways through the dense rocky terrain. I love it up here. Even school wasn’t too bad. It had its ups and downs. Ex’s, bullies, fights, highschool drama. But really my life was good and fairly one-note. Until my friend went missing. 

10 years ago when we were in sophomore year the class took a field trip to a nearby mountain range. It was a hikers paradise out there. Beautiful, and lot’s of bald spots so getting lost was much less likely. They even had a trail that went up to a “pioneer’s cabin.” It was a really cute spot I’d visit in later years. 

My best friend's name was Clark. Our friendship began in junior year and prospered in highschool. Mostly because we had the same taste in music. Alt rock. 

And yes to all you metalheads. I did listen to tool and some Machinehead. I branched out, but alt rock is just what we landed on so forgive me. 

It really felt like the glue that held us together was music. We talked on and on about the different bands we loved. Argue to death on their worst albums. We were even discussing starting our own band...but alas “Valley Boys” was not meant to be. 

I remember it all so vividly. Not just the moment, but all the little stuff leading up to it. All these years and it still hasn’t left me. Why hasn’t it left me?

On the bus ride we were arguing about MCR’s new compilation album “May Death Never Stop You.” Both agreeing we were hoping for a whole new album, not some combination of a bunch of old hits. 

Clark said,”I mean yeah I like the sound they have, but it’s time they branched out.”   
  
I was arguing,”If you had a money winner like that, why would you ever change it?” 

He thought for a bit as the bus jostled. 

“Because I have dignity.”   
  
“You’ll have dignity in a cardboard box then.” I chuckled. 

 He bit back the smile that was starting to form on his face. 

“So captain shameless have you talked to Julie yet?” 

That was a sore spot back then…okay I still have trouble. But not nearly as bad as then. I had a streak for being absolutely petrified of women. Everytime I got close I would sweat and forget how to string together a coherent sentence. Clark on the other hand was a smooth operator…well that’s what I thought in highschool. Looking back he may have just figured out that confidence was key much earlier than most of us.

“I’ll do it on this trip.” I said much too confidently. I blew the long strands of brown hair out of my face.  
  
“Oh she’s right over there.” I darted my eyes over to the seat behind us, where two boys sat.  
  
“Dick.” I slapped him with my red baseball cap.  
  
I looked down and noticed that Clark was wearing a metallica shirt. Uncharacteristic of his usual tastes. However it fit his dark visage. Shaggy black hair, brown eyes, tall.   
  
*Traitor* I thought. He looked down at his shirt then me and smirked.   
  
“I just think the album cover is cool, chill out Simon.” 

We settled into our normal talks. But I could see something was distracting him. I should’ve asked him. I just…should’ve asked him. Clark wasn’t easily distracted. He lived in the moment, I lived in my head. That’s how we worked. But it wasn’t working that day. What was he thinking about? God, what was he thinking about?

The bus bounced and hopped through the little valley town. Up and through to the destination. It was miles of fields and I thought maybe I wouldn’t mind living there. But how could I be a famous musician, and a mountain man. Seemed those things did not mix. Humans like to put things into neat little boxes. The contents all have to make sense, if you start mixing them, people get confused. When you’re confused you feel stupid. 

Nobody likes to feel stupid. 

   

So people will spill out the contents of themselves, just to stuff it with something more “organized.” Nobody except Clark knew I hunted. I loved camping on the weekends. Nature was my getaway. Music was the art I listened to away from the noise of buildings and cities. 

The bus rose up, dragging itself up the black asphalt road until we parked in a that little dirt lot. Signs and boulders outlining where we would begin our trek. 

I kept appearances with a Pearl Jam shirt and some torn jeans. But I wasn’t dumb enough to bring sneakers on a two hour hike. I made sure Clark didn’t make the mistake either. He tied them like bunny ears instead of cross-hatching which annoyed me beyond measure. 

I looked over the woods. Browns were more of the state then greens. Dry dirt that rose into bark that struck odd shapes into trees. I could see animals and screaming faces carved into the surface. Those woods were a drawing siren inside a sea of green and brown. 

Kids spilled out laughing and joking. I saw lots of sneakers. Our teacher was Mr. Dreitouth. People called him ”dry mouth” because he was old and rasped out words. 

Our decrepit protector said, ”Alright children, we’re going to be hiking \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.” 

As though the sign wasn’t right in front of us. Naturally being such a closeted hiker, I did my research on the trail. I knew the place was already a mistake. 

According to all the sources I could find it was considered a “severe” hike. Almost 20 km total. Obviously he didn’t plan to take us the whole way, but even a quarter of the way was too much for a bunch of sophomore kids. I joked with Clark that all the pretty sneakers would have puke on them by the end. 

He didn’t laugh, he instead stared wistfully at the trail. I ignored his silence and eyed the perimeter of the parking lot. A few other cars parked there, a beat up old red chevy, a grey tundra, and an old yellow corvette. Me in my infinite paranoia was wondering what kind of people would be hiking the “severe” trail. 

We started on our ascent. I remember that the sun was hot as fuck that day. It was suffocating. I brought a big water jug and was glad of it. The trail radiated heat. Crawling through the asscrack of two mountains pressed together. Trees started to press closer like they were trying to lull us deeper into the thick embrace of Mother nature. I really can’t say if it’s the context of what happened or if I really felt like it at the time. But it felt awful out there. Like I was a wounded animal going off to perish somewhere alone.

  I handed the jug over to Clark making sure he took a big gulp. I looked up and saw Julie lagging behind. 

“Alright cowboy nows your chance.” He jabbed.   
  
“You’ve got a sweat stain on your ass.” 

Clark whipped around, and before he realized my ruse I half fell towards Julie. 

“A-are you okay?” She asked.   
  
“Y-yeah. So, sweaty out here right?”   
  
“What?”  
  
“The sun- it’s- sunny.”   
  
“....ya.”

I ran back to Clark before I could suffer the burning gaze of her any longer. I was shaking, my whole body trembling as if ready to receive a beating. 

“What happened?” He asked. 

From the shame on my face he knew to drop it. To just let that interaction fall to the ground and melt in the hot sun. 

Clark started tapping his leg rhythmically, staring out around the outcropping our class found ourselves on. There were steep hills to either side bare of most trees. We passed a large boulder when I noticed Clarks incessant tapping. 

“Thinking a new song up?”  
  
He looked over and smiled weakly,”It’s been coming together.”   
  
“Any actual guitar playing?” I said.  
  
“I’ve been thinking piano actually.”  
  
“...really?”  
  
“Yes Simon. A piano. Piano’s have a lot of range.”   
  
“The range at which it will keep you from women is an impressive distance.”

He laughed at that and people turned around to look. I would’ve been embarrassed if my head wasn’t so full of heat. Sweat lingering in my vision as we walked through another cropping of trees. 

We had been hiking for an hour when finally one of the girls began to sway. One of her friends caught her and looking around realized there was no one to tell. 

Mr. Dry mouth was gone. I guessed he had fallen behind. Some of the kids too mature for their age suggested we hike back down towards him, and if we can’t find him to notify the bus driver. An actual level headed plan I could get behind. 

We began the awkward hot descent. Some of the other students began to grow nauseous. I didn’t blame them. It was much too hot for a hike like that. I had no idea what the teacher had thought bringing us out there. Clark seemed especially bothered. I looked over to him. 

“Hey man, water? You can have the last drink.” I sloshed the nectar around to drive home the point.   
  
“I- I can’t hear very well.” He muttered. 

I’d never heard of a symptom like that for heatstroke. Maybe confusion. I told him we were halfway down the trail. Julie apparently heard me. 

“How do you know that Simon?” She said with a tinge of annoyance. Heat will do that.   
  
“O-Oh I remember this bend comes after the boulder we just passed, which was about halfway up.”  
  
“Jesus, you have a good sense of direction.” She said.   
  
I blushed before saying,”I have hiking boots.”   
  
“What?” She said. The confusion was not caused by heatstroke. 

Clark turned. I see that face in distant flashes when I daydream. Sometimes when that personality that had been so integral to a younger me wonders back into perception. I see his face. Aghast. Morbid realization maybe. But all his face told me was something was unimaginably wrong. So wrong. I feel sick now just thinking about what he said. Just putting it into reality.  

“Something Happened to Mr. Dretouth.” He said. 

I was completely perplexed by the oddity. A random mention? As though gifted knowledge not known to me. It was alien. 

“W-what?”

He shook his head as if erasing confusion from his heat rattled head. Nobody else heard my friend. 

Right now I’m thinking why the fuck did he bring us out there that day? That fucking idiot, even typing it gets me so pissed. He should be held responsible. He should’ve been held MORE responsible I should be saying. Maybe I’d still be joking about musical instruments with Clark today. But not today. Or yesterday. Not for a long time. 

“This heat is bad Simon, you don’t understand.” He waved me off as if trying to wave off an apparition. 

I pressed him to tell me what he meant. That’s when the girl passed out. She fell right on the ground in a heap. Panic began to ensue. A class of sophomore kids up on a heatridden mountain lost composure. Those more mature kids ran over to her quickly. Opening her eyelids, feeling her neck for a pulse. I was frozen for a moment watching it happen. I told myself the thing that every man thinks.

*They have enough people, they don’t need me to help.* Diffusing responsibility. 

They picked her up, and I turned to Clark, about to ask him if we should do something. 

Like smoke. 

He had been next to me. Then he wasn’t. 

He hadn’t made a sound. 

Hadn’t told me anything. 

Had existed one moment then the world swallowed him into it’s deepest darkest pits. The forest was so quiet. I remembered everyone faded into the background. Someone attached to you at the hip is suddenly out of your awareness. I wonder how to describe that? Even now, even after counseling. Even after “soul searching,” there are things that fail to be interpreted by language. Only apparent through sensation. Someone was in my life. Then they weren’t. All in 10 seconds. I should’ve just kept looking at him. He couldn’t have…ran off? Anyways, all I thought at the time was. 

*Where is he going?*

Sadly my naivete didn’t wear off the first hour down. Nor the second. All the way to the bus stop it didn’t stop. 

*Oh he must be taking a piss up there. He’ll be down.* 

*Oh he must be lost, we'll find him.* 

*He must’ve bedded down for the night, the rangers will get him. Then he’ll come down.*

*My friend is alive. I know it.* 

Days after, hope still remained.

When we arrived at the bus stop Mr. Dreitouth was being taken care of by the bus driver. I asked if Clark had been there. There was no reply, I asked if they would come help look. The bus driver could not leave everyone unattended. 

“Can I go?” I asked.   
  
“No, we don’t need anyone else unaccounted for.” 

We waited an hour until they notified rangers. There was “nothing we could do.” Dreitouth was rambling. He was in no state to go look. He looked sick and not just from the heatstroke. 

As the Sun touched the tip of those mountains and the brights came ont. The lights of the rangers atv’s worming their way up the mountain. It gave me the thought of “uniformity failure.” 

I watched and maybe subconsciously I understood that no one was gonna find him. That they were being careful, instead of fast. That they were planning, instead of doing. Maybe that’s why I yelled at Mr. Dreitouth. 

”WHY THE FUCK DID YOU BRING US UP THERE.” 

Everyone jumped. I was not the outspoken sort for reasons made clear earlier. The teacher couldn’t even respond. 

Not until he said, ”Thank you.” 

I tensed with deep pained anger. Slowly, it shook off into a puddle of seething contempt. I stormed off towards the road and did my pacing. It was surreal. What was next…going home? A place without someone who I had known since 8th grade? Who would push me out of my comfort zone? Who could I laugh with? I was completely taxed from that hellish hike. I wondered what was taking him so long. How could I accept that he was missing? But I did. Because I was 15 years old, and afraid to keep him alive in my memory. 

Without Clark I leaned much harder into my hiking background. I spent most of my time alone, not friendless, but no best friends. I became well acquainted with fish and game. Even local rangers became well acquainted with me. So it really just made sense when I eventually became a guide. 

Mostly for other hunters, but now and again for families trying to see some sights. I really opened up when I was out in nature, so talking was much easier. Something about being responsible for others made me feel obligated to know them. Most of them I was glad to know. 

The pay isn’t great, but the job is. So that’s what I’ve been doing the last 3 or so years. I make it a habit to explore new trails. One because they can net me new customers, and two…I love hiking, I think I’ve explained this. 

But I avoided one trail, no matter how close to the trails I was acquainted with.  “\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*” still haunted me. Every once in a while I’d have a dream about Clark looking at me silently. Just standing all lonesome in that trail. So I avoided it like the plague. 

I kept on. Until my girlfriend told me that I needed some “exposure therapy.” I fear she might be right. I am a strong believer in facing your fears…so the fact I let that path bother me for so long should showcase how fucking scared I was. 

But I went anyways. She offered to come with me, but I told her I didn’t want her to see me cry. I played it off like a joke, but who knows how I’d feel up there. I drove my 2015 wrangler up. I crested over a hill and down into that sunny little valley town I had seen all those years ago. People as polite as ever. Waving me through as though I were family. I slowed the jeep the closer I got to the trailhead. I stopped at the entrance to the parking lot, my limbs were shaking. I hadn’t seen anyone die. I hadn’t been attacked. So why was I shaking like a leaf? It made me so mad I floored the pedal and lurched into the parking lot with a jolt. I put the car in park and slapped myself once. 

“Easiest hike of my life.” I said, meeting my gaze in the rearview.

I pressed the radio on until I got to the proper channel for weather alerts. I didn’t hear anything, so I looked over to my little notepad list of the weather for the day. I’m gonna write it down here, since I have it still. 

* 12pm Arrive
* At 2 (75F) there would be 5mph winds
* At 3 (80F) no notable changes
* At 4 (82F) 5% chance of rain
* At 5 (83) 10% chance of rain (head back)

I checked my watch and made sure it was working properly. I checked my bag for all of my essentials. Including a map, PLB, water, MRE, Hunting Knife, Metal Bowl, firestarter, binoculars…and some snacks. 

Thorough. That was my motto. Also my Kimber K6S. 

I brushed my hand through my cropped brown hair. Stretched my wide shoulders. All the hunting and hiking had made my thick build just a little stronger. But all the snacks balanced me out with a little bit of a gut. 

I took a few steps towards the trail marker. I was overcome with that feeling of dread. Only one other vehicle was in the parking lot. An old red chevy. I reflexively let my hand lay on my holster, just for a sense of safety. 

I swallowed and began to make my trek. The new hiking boots I had bought were sleek and comfortable. That hike would decide if they were my lucky boots. Or if they were the shit boots. 

I made my way up, a slow creeping sensation of fright scuttled its way up my legs. I stomped harder to try to shake the weakness spreading throughout my body. I forced myself to continue. I couldn’t let that trail hold me. I had to be better than that. 

Soon there was some winds. I looked at my watch. 

**2:05pm**

I nodded to myself. Coming to an outcropping I sat on a tree-stump and stared out at the valley and down below. A beautiful creek ran far below. Far, far below. My eyes stared and made out a figure crouched down at the edge of it. I looked over to my bag and got my bincocoulars out. I stared down into the valley and there was a man. In full fishing gear looking quite worn. Definitely a bush man. He didn’t look like he had left the forest for some years. He casting a net along the river, and I remarked that it was illegal. But pressing a poacher out in the middle of the bush was how people went missing. So I ignored it, standing up instead. I looked one more time at the man with the massive bushy beard. 

*Damn* I thought. He had actually caught a fish. 

It flapped onto shore and the man stood on it. I was expecting him to just step on its head and kill it. He instead took his knife and began cutting it’s tail off. I groaned as he began to cut it back to front. The fish, still breathing. He would just…sit there watching it. He’d cut up then watch it twitch until the thing finally passed on to whatever fish god it belonged to. 

The man calmly washed his hands off before casting the net back out. All pieces of the fish just lay behind him on the bank, cooking in the sun. I left that spot. Determining that the trail was clearly just cursed with weird shit. It honestly shook me. I wondered then if this was one of those creepy ass towns where everyone is in on something not understood to the confused traveler. 

I loved those movies. 

Clouds rolled over the shining sun and suddenly the shade came to me. Not that I was complaining. Well maybe complaining a little thinking it might actually rain with only a supposed 5-10% chance. That’s when I passed the large boulder. It was the one that marked the halfway point to where I had last seen Clark. It wasn’t a 5 mile marker anymore, it was a gravestone of sorts. I rubbed my hand over my face and when I closed my eyes I saw Clark in the darkness. I opened them, quickly slapping myself again and again. I rushed up the mountain. Letting my irritation propel me further. I took out my drink and looked down at it. The life of my body, contained in a little metal cylinder. I drank. I kept up, rethinking all the things I had explained earlier. Of the past, that moment in my mind. 

“...Mr. Dreitouth is in trouble…” I said absentmindedly. I looked up and saw the path forward was one I had not gone to before. I looked back and saw the quiet trees Clark had supposedly ran into. 

My skin tightened like a deer pelt over a drum. My heart thudded in my chest and I was still. To move higher on the mountain was suicide. Every inch of my body was rigid. It would not let me go any farther. I have trouble regurgitating this information. It feels like I’m back again. I don’t want to be back again. 

I looked up the hill then looked back. A figure with long black hair and a band Tee had their back turned to me as they walked back into the treeline. It was so nonchalant. It was over so quickly. I gripped my chest as my heart's normal rhythmic state trembled in awkward stiletto. 

“Hel-lo?” I said. Not really knowing any other words. 

I walked back down, and there were footprints. Real footprints. I followed. Thoughts swam through my consciousness. 

Did he run away?  
  
Has he been lost this entire time?  
  
Am I hallucinating?   
  
A random person?

I ran after the footprints. They disappeared into the treeline. I burst through stopping just before a steep hill. I shook my head realizing that the trail was obviously lost. 

“c-CLARK! WHERE ARE YOU?” I yelled. My voice echoed in the empty valley and I was left with nothing but hopelessness to fill the silence. 

It sounds stupid. It could be anyone, but…I can’t shake the fact that it felt like him. Even the strut was so oddly familiar. Everything about it. I couldn’t climb any higher, so I hiked back down. I felt the odd sense of primal sickness. AS though my ancestors were warning me of a predator very near. My skin crawled, and my perception widened. I noticed it. 

Someone was out of breath. I looked back up the trail. The breathing became steadier as I stopped. I put my hand at my holster. 

“Hey, make yourself known.” I said, trying to keep the tremble from my voice. 

The breathing turned into some kind of rasping. I tried to listen, but the wind picked up and rain trickled down. I thought my fears were very warranted in that moment. I pulled my gun out and began to walk down the trail keeping an eye behind me. The noise faded into the fuzz of rain. I rounded a corner and on the ground I saw Clarks band tee. 

My face contorted as if it was going to rip with the force of my expression. 

“W-WHO ARE YOU? COME OUT MOTHERFUCKER.”   
  
“You know me.” it said. So close to the nape of my neck that it felt like the voice had crawled up my spinal cord. 

I whipped around cocking the hammer. No one, I turned back and something metal struck my head. A dull vibrating ring sounded and I was down on the ground. I pawed for my gun, my sense of balance alien. 

I could see the figure with the dark long hair, digging through my pack in doubles. I yelled. Rolling in awkward waves of pain. I mustered the last bit of sense I had, and yelled tackling them, sending us into a muddy heap. We tumbled down the trail near one of the steeper ledges and I held them down with my stocky build. 

I pulled the gun to their face and suddenly my mind went white. Like someone had wiped it clean of all experience. Sense of past, future, and present left me. Their visage had been completely masked, and I had been stunned. 

I woke up in the same spot, no one there. Rain pouring now. I clawed my way up that muddy bank and there I found my pack. I stumbled down the mountain. A ghost looking for familiarity. I tried to find my truck in my damaged state. I looked over in the parking lot and saw an old red truck. The drive home was dangerous to say the least. 

The whole experience shook me pretty bad, and I’m pretty upset with my girlfriend right now. She’s insisting that it’s a hallucination brought on by trauma. We’ve been arguing about it for the last few hours. She says the damage could’ve been me just rolling around. 

To that I would say, why is my hunting knife missing then? Why would I hallucinate so intensely that I would throw my own knife away as a trauma response? Makes no sense. Just like the dreams.

I’ve been waking up screaming recently. I don’t remember the dreams, I only remember phrases from within them. One that keeps coming back is. 

“Bottom to top.” 

My girlfriend wants to come with me next time. To see with her own eyes how I am not hallucinating. The rain washed the scuffle away. The band tee is probably gone. And for obvious reasons I wouldn’t bring a 145lb woman with me when there’s a violent thing up on a mountain top somewhere.

But even if that all were not true. There’s one more simple reason why I could never bring her to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

Something was unlocked on that mountain. I’m starting to remember why I’m so afraid of that mountain.
