"Good afternoon, Dr?"  
"Korscht. Gabriel Korscht."  
Hello, Dr. Korscht. Pleasure to meet you. Please sit."  
"Thank you."  
"No offense sir, but that's quite the tattoo you have on that arm over there."  
"Oh this? No, it's not-"  
"Unfortunately, we must continue our small talk later, sir. It's already four o'clock. Shall we start?"  
"Oh, uh- of course."  
"Very well. You can start, now."

"It. Listens. It. Watches."  
These are the words that were etched in my mind that day, haunting my soul for eternity. You might not believe me, and I don't blame you. But if you do, please take my story as a warning.  
From what I can remember, Presage Drive was this 8 or 9 mile road going through forest after forest- and occasionally, some grassland. The trees in those woods varied in size. The majority of them were tall and lanky, and occasionally, some where thick but shorter. The trunk of the trees had this dark brown color, and a few of them don't even have leaves.   
Meanwhile, the grassland in the area were empty with only grass of course, and probably stretched for hundreds of miles. Though, we can't see the end of it because of the fog. Of course, the fog. It never seems to go away. It wasn't too dense, nor was it light. But it was always present.  
The road itself was also fairly inconsistent with their lanes. Parts of the road occasionally turns from two-laned to just one-lane.  
But the creepiest part of this place, Except from it's eerie atmosphere, was the deafening silence within it. Exept for the occasional huffs of wind, there wasn't a single sound outside. No birds chirping, no leaves rustling. Nothing. There was only this strong feeling of isolation, a sensation that even the bravest succumbs to, and slowly drives you insane.

This is a photo of Presage Drive that was taken when we first arrived at the location.  
Alright. Enough of that. Let me tell you my story, the horific incident, and how we ended up in the middle of Presage Drive.  
\------  
1996, 3 years before "The Incident".  
Let's start from the beginning.  
From the 28th of April, 1996 to the 26th of August, 1999, I've been working as a road maintenance worker. If you don't know what road maintenance is, although I doubt it, they fix and maintain roads to ensure that they're working in proper order. Pavement resurfacing, pothole repair, sign installation, that kind of stuff.   
Our crew varies in size depending on what we'll be doing, but is usually around the smaller side, around 4-5 workers.  
For some context, my parents wanted me to become a lawyer. But I wasn't interested in that stuff. I was more into helping people, specifically medicine. So that's what I originally wanted to be, a doctor. But not only that, I also wanted my own clinic. Not a small one, but not too big either.   
My parents were kind of against it, but it's what I want, they couldn't change that.  
To become a doctor and have his own clinic though, I needed money, and alot of it. I also needed to go study in a medical school after my winter semester. Unfortunately for me, we weren't wealthy. My father is only one who has a job, therefore the family's needs all come from him. I managed to convince him to give me some money, but it wasn't enough.   
Therefore, I had to find a temporary job. That became my first goal. Find a temporary job to get some money for my studies.  
But obviously, finding a job isn't so simple. Multiple factors determine that. One of those is grades. And I didn't have the best grades. So there's another problem.  
Anyways, after I graduated college, I set off into the outside world, my head up high, and with a smile on my face. I was clueless- but determined.  
You're probably thinking to yourself that what I wanted to become was far too unrealistic for me, and we just didn't have the funds to do it. And your right. But somehow, I managed to do it.  
After only 2 months and multiple failed attempts of trying to find a job, a logging company emailed me and said that they could offer me a job as a truck driver. They said I was tasked on delivering lumber from the sawmill to their warehouse. I was so overjoyed I almost forgot to ask the most important question. The salary.  
So, I emailed them back, asking about the pricing. Next thing I know, they replied back in a few minutes.

from: TimberTrail Logging  
"For the pricing, we'd say a reasonable amount should be around 15 to 20 thousand dollars per year."  
\--  
"What?!" I said to myself.  
I was shocked at what they said. My eyes widened. My fists clenched. My jaw dropped. I could not believe what they just said to me. I was getting 20 thousand dollars a year just for driving a truck?  
"That is- too low for my expectations." I sighed.  
"If I wanted to become a doctor, I needed much more money than that." I added.  
So, I respectfully declined their offer, and the 19 year old me proceeded to scream and bang at the walls of my childhood room. A painful 2 more months pass with still nothing. That is, until a very fateful day. I was biking back home from the grocery store, don't ask, when I spotted a star across the street, shining brightly, as if it were calling me.  
"Is that, what I think it is?" I mutter to myself.  
Yes. It was exactly what I was looking for.

Finally, a job that actually pays good. A company called SafeRoute Roadworks. Turns out they were pretty huge in my area, so I'm in luck. One step closer to my dreams coming true.   
That's basically my life story in a nutshell. Yes, very miserable, I know. Let's try not to talk about that. Anyways, training as a road maintenance worker was, let's just say, easier said than done.  
And when I finally did get past it, I learned that there was also a thing called "On-the-job training". So uh, yeah, I wasn't expecting that coming either.  
I slowly started liking my job. At first I was like, Meh, but it's growing on me. The same goes for my crewmates, for most of them. Turns out I was actually pretty good at lifting potholes and fixing cracks.  
And in 1998, I even got promoted to a surveyor.  
\------  
1998, 1 year before "The Incident"  
All of The trouble I faced was worth it though, when I finally got to move out of my childhood room. Yes, I actually did it.  
"See ya suckers!" I yelled to my parents as I marched out of the front door, probably never to return again.  
That's why I wasn't on good terms with my parents anymore. They're still mad at me to this day.  
But, I finally had my own apartment.  
"I could finally impress Zoey." I thought to myself.  
Zoey is now my wife. But by that time, I was still trying to court her. She was the one who helped me the most to recover from that incident. We have 2 kids now.  
When I opened the front door to my apartment though, I had a realization. I had forgotten to buy furniture.  
"God damnit." I said, as I facepalmed myself.  
And because I spent all my money on it, I had to live in  this apartment for at least a month with my only furniture being a sleeping bag. I also had to survive with only the food and water I had left until I get my next paycheck. Great.  
"Well, at least it's better than that other house." I said, trying to comfort myself.  
Somehow, I managed to survive. Everything was normal after that. I continued my job, got paid, me and Zoey even started dating. It was the peak of my life that I thought I couldn't achieve.  
\------  
1999, the day of "The Incident".  
After our lunch break, we were assigned to maintain a new road called Presage Drive. There were 6 of us. We were told to maintain the road and prepare it for the upcoming winter. It wasn't a big deal, we've done it before. But none of us had seen the road before, so we were quite eager.  
Around 30 minutes after our lunch break was over, we arrived at the area in our van, bringing the maintenance truck with us. But what I found unusual, is when Henrik brought out a hunting rifle and a small ammo box.  
"What's the gun for?" Lucas, one of our fellow workers asked.  
Lucas Silva was the funniest among us. He always tries cracking jokes every now and then. But he isn't annoying, as what you might expect. He was actually very friendly and supportive.  
"I don't exactly know. My superior gave this to me and said that we should be careful out here." Henrik replied.  
"Can I have it?" Lucas jokingly said.  
Henrik ignored the question.  
"Alright boys, time to get working." He shouted, accompanied with 3 claps.  
Henrik Larsen was our Foreman. He was the one in charge of our crew. Henrik was a very strict man, he doesn't tolerate any nonsense from us, but he was very experienced, around 10 years of it.  
"On it!" We all shouted.  
We proceeded to work very routinely. I scanned for any damages, and the others fixed it. We've done this so many times now, even Henrik started allowing us to converse.  
"So Tim, how's that journal of yours coming along?" I asked, while I was scanning with my GPS, which was fairly new at the time.  
"It's good. But I'm taking my time on it, you know?" He replied, while he was starting the concrete mixer.  
"This is the 5th time you've said that Tim. I'm starting to doubt if you'll ever finish at all." I reply.  
"I told you I'm working on it okay? Let's just finish this for now." He replied, annoyed.  
Tim, or Timofey Orlov as his full name, was my only best friend. We met 2 years before this incident. He's from a Russian descent, as you can tell by the name. He was very creative, but probably the laziest among all of us. He works as our machine operator. We call him Tim because we found his real name too hard to say.  
"Can someone fetch me the nail box?" José said.  
"Go get it yourself dumbass. Everyone's working here as you can see." Sergei replied.  
I chuckle a bit. José Williams and Sergei Martin were also both workers. José is the smartest one among all of us, while Sergei was just an asshole. They're not on great terms with each other, hence the frequent scolding of Henrik. I just wish Sergei would just shut up.  
Anyways, as I said earlier, it was very routine for us, so we finished in under 4 hours. It was only a small area of the road from what we were used to after all. We started taking a break by that time, while Henrik inspected my documentation of the damages.  
"You know, this place is very quiet. A little too much." Tim said.  
"It is." I replied.  
He was right. The breezing wind sent a shiver down my spine. The hairs on my arms stood up. Not a single sound was being made. We were in the middle of the woods, miles away from civilization. We just now realized how unsettling this place was. I felt a strong sense of isolation. We continued talking about the place. But then:  
"Did anyone hear that?" José said, stuttering.  
"Hear what?" Tim responded.  
"It sounded like- like, I don't know." He replied.  
"What do you mean you don't know? What did you even hear?" I reply.  
We all silenced. My eyebrows raised, my ears tuned. I grabbed a flashlight and pointed it around.  
"There it is again! Do you hear it!" José yelled.  
We heard it. A sound I've never heard before. It sounded straight from hell. The best way I could describe it is a loud, rapid clicking sound, accompanied by a distorted scream from an injured animal.  
"What is that noise?" Sergei said.  
"It sounds like it's coming from behind us." Tim responded.  
We turn around, and as fast as it began, the noise stopped. We all stood there in silence.   
We heard the noise again, breaking our silence. This time, sounding louder, this time, getting closer. We weren't expecting it.  
A figure suddenly jumps on Sergei, knocking him to the ground. I dropped my flashlight as a stumbled to the ground in shock. I realized that the figure is where the noise was coming from. It started ripping chunks from Sergei's body, devouring them afterward. He screamed in agony. Then, silence. My face was frozen in horror.  
"What is that?!" Lucas shouted.  
"Shoot it!" Tim replied, still in shock.  
Henrik grabbed the rifle and fired a round at the creature, hitting it in the shoulder.   
"Bang!" The loud sound of a gunshot rang off.  
It looked at us, screamed, and ran into the foggy woods. I caught a glimpse of it.  
It looked horrifying. The creature was around 6 feet tall, humanoid in shape. It's body was black, with long but slender legs and arms. It had three fingers with razor sharp claws, stretching to it's feet, which were large hooves. It's head was white, and it's eyes were black. They were slanted backwards, like a sorrowful expression. But it had this wide, gaping mouth, and hanging from it, a disgusting, black tongue, reaching it's chest.  
"Get in the van, now!" Henrik ordered at us.  
We ran to the van, but Jose just stood there looking at Sergei on the ground, motionless. His eyes wide, tears flowing out of them. His mouth, hanging open.  
"José, I said get in th-"  
The creature screamed from atop the van, scaring us all. It lunges at Henrik, and grabs his arms using it's claws, impaling them. He drags Henrik away, dissapearing into the trees, with him pleading to be let go. It was followed by distant screams, Henrik's screams.  
"Come on! Tim, Lucas, Jose let's go! There's nothing we can do!" I shouted at them.  
"I- I gotta save him." Tim replied.  
"No you're not, now come on!" I reply, gesturing at the van.  
He didn't listen. He ran off into the woods, but a sharp, short scream followed again, this time, from him. He came back, crawling on the ground, his right leg now missing.  
"Save yourself." He replied, in agony.  
The creature reappears once again from behind him, before jumping on Tim's back, slashing at it multiple times, leaving his back as a mess. He groans loudly, before dropping dead silent.  
Lucas grabs the rifle on the ground and fires another round into the creature, sending it back into the woods.  
"Bang!" The rifle rang off again.  
"This is our chance, let's go!" Lucas shouts.  
We hear it scream again, from behind. It quickly dashed beside me, leaving a deep gash at my side. I fall to the ground, screaming in pain.  
Lucas fires another round once again, it misses.  
"Bang!" It rang off again. The sound was deafening.  
"Please- Lucas, help me." I said.  
"I'm sorry Fritz, but I don't have time." He replies.  
He runs to the van, but is stopped feet away from it, the creature now standing between him and the van. Lucas tries to aim at it, but the creature grabs the gun from him, and drives it through his chest. He falls to the ground, silent.  
The creature faces me. My eyes watering, my body trembling, I tried to cover myself with my arms to protect myself as the creature charged at me while still screaming. I closed my eyes, preparing for the worst. But then it stopped.   
The creature screamed, and ran back into the woods. I was confused, but I had to move. I managed to crawl back to the side of the van. I wasn't far away from it. José then finally moved. He looked at me.  
"let's get ou-"  
The creature came from behind him and seperated his head from his shoulders in one clean swipe. He falls to the ground, motionless.  
It charges at me, my hands were frozen in the air in shock. I gasped, My heartbeat quickened. The creature stopped again. It screams, and ran back into the woods.  
"Th- the flashlight. The flashlight is it's weakness." I realized.  
I managed to crawl to the driver's seat, still in agony. I started the van, and drove out of there. Then, the creature jumps infront of it and manages to halt it using it's hands.  
I turn on the headlights of the vehicle, sending it stumbling to the ground, covering it's eyes, screaming once again. It runs away, back into the woods.   
I floored the pedal, traumatized, my body shaking, tears flowing out of my eyes, I don't know what I was feeling at the time. I don't understand.  
A sudden, sharp pain came from my left arm, making me groan in pain. While still driving, I pulled up the sleeve to find a message written in a black substance that says:  
"It. Listens. It. Watches."
