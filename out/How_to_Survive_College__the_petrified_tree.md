Sometimes, when I was younger, I’d imagine that I was there.  In the fields, when something came for my father.  In my mind, it was always a shapeless darkness that slipped between the rows of corn, a silent malevolence that blocked out the moon when it showed itself.  And I was there, I was standing between it and my dad and I carried a torch - fire - humanity’s oldest weapon.  I’d yell at him to run, because I was here to save him so that he could come home to all of us - to me - who so desperately needed him.

I’d set fire to the corn field and it would burn so bright that the malevolent darkness had nowhere to hide and it would perish in the flames.

Then I would cry myself to sleep.

I couldn’t save him.  I might not be able to save my friends.  I could barely save myself.  But this I could do, the torch, the fields, the fire.  I could destroy it all so that they wouldn’t have any way to hide anymore, so that they would all suffer as I was suffering, and perhaps the flames would get away from me and I’d perish in that burning field as well, but *I no longer cared*.

The devil had promised me that everything would change.

It started to drizzle before I reached the graveyard.  Not the heavy, dangerous rain that heralded that campus would shift and the inhuman would emerge, but it was a cautious, watchful rain.  As if the world was bending its attention towards what I was doing.  The earth takes a long time to change, plates drift, the world shifts, and change is measured in epochs.  But sometimes, rarely, a singular event happens in an instant and everything is irrevocably different.  An asteroid strikes and rewrites the future.

The stake weighed heavy in my hand.

Ahead of me loomed the fence of the graveyard, the black iron rods like teeth underneath the darkening sky.  The student population was dwindling, seeking shelter in case the threatening clouds opened up and the rain came forth in earnest.  I felt a tremor of reflexive fear, that of a prey animal separated from the herd, but the cold and logical part of my mind was grateful that there would be no witnesses.  For the gate to the graveyard was shut tight and the padlock sat there, waiting, a small simple thing that thought it could defy my intention.  And it had, in the past.  But I’d be damned if a stupid $20 lock would keep me from hammering this stake into the tree.  I was fueled by a determination I had rarely felt before.  I’ve spent so much of my life afraid, second-guessing myself, thinking one mistake would result in me losing the love of those that I cared about.  I had to be perfect.  I couldn’t be selfish.  These were the rules I had for myself.

But this time, like when I declared I would go to college and leave my hometown behind, I was doing this for myself.  I was done with rules - even my own.

I was giddy with my resolve.

Climbing the fence was out of the question.  I’m not that athletic.  Lockpicking wasn’t possible either, as watching someone do it once is hardly enough to learn the skill with.  At least we know that Professor Monotone isn’t an inhuman.  If he were, I have no doubt that he would be waiting for me, lockpicks in hand.  Hopefully he’s nothing more than someone who grew up in town, whose great?-grandfather died with too many secrets, who perhaps is a bit more open-minded to the concept of the inhuman because of those very same secrets.

So I smashed the lock with the stake.

It was a clumsy blow.  I brought the stake down point-first, with both hands, and it glanced against the body of the lock.  But the lock snapped as if it had been struck with a sledgehammer.  It clattered to the ground.

I didn’t stop to think about what I was doing.  I wrenched the gate open and strode inside, letting it fall shut behind me with a clang.

The path before me was broken into segments, the cobblestones slanting erratically as the roots of the tree surged out of the ground.  It was like a jigsaw puzzle that had been upended into a heap, each piece jumbled on top of the others.  I had to slow my pace by necessity and that had the unfortunate side-effect of making me hyper-aware of my surroundings.

The gravestones around me cast long, jagged shadows that were almost impenetrable.  They shouldn’t be that dark, I thought.  The overcast sky was dampening the sunlight, but the contrast between light and shadow was too great.  Too unnatural.  I couldn’t tear my eyes from the shadows, my heart pounding, wondering what was lurking in them just out of sight.

Up ahead, the tree rose towards the sky, dwarfing the others around it.  

I focused on the ground ahead of me, relying on my hearing to alert me to anything else that might be in the graveyard with me.  Growing up in the country worked in my favor here.  I knew how to navigate the woods, even in jagged, slippery terrain.  I knew what a forest should sound like and I knew what I shouldn’t hear.  The rain dripped from the scattered trees, thickening the noise, making it sound like it was raining much harder than it was.  Beneath me, the ground began to slowly slant upwards.  Like the roots were building into a hill, taking the tree with them, its barren branches trying to reach the clouds themselves.

I was getting close to the tree when the noise around me shifted.  I could see the tree’s bark, gray and lifeless, like the side of a mountain.  It felt like I should have seen the tree long before now, as it was immense, the trunk wide enough to swallow up a house.  The trees and the headstones weren’t clustered so close together to fully obscure something of that size.  It was like it simply emerged out of the mist and the rain when I had climbed far enough on its knotted roots.

I was climbing carefully, on all fours, because the rain was growing stronger.  The raindrops were thicker, rolling in cold streaks down the back of my neck and soaking into my shirt.  I could hear them all around me, striking the tree roots like the rapping of fingernails.

Something about it made me pause.  There was a strange undertone to it.  Almost a metallic quality, like the rain was falling on metal.

No.  It wasn’t the rain that I was hearing.

Legs.  Countless legs.

Something moved, emerging from the shadow of one of the tombstones nestled in a hollow among the roots.  Its black carapace shone like obsidian.  I stared at it, the first tendril of terror uncurling in my stomach.  There, another hint of movement in the darkness between two of the thick cables of roots.  And another.

They were emerging from everywhere and they were all coming directly to me.

Listen.  I know there’s something to be said about how millipedes aren’t dangerous, they don’t bite, they’re not venomous.  But the reality is that people are scared of millipedes and fear and need and desire is what shapes the inhuman.  If we as a species recoil from millipedes, then the odds were *very good* that these were dangerous.

Also these were as big as my leg.  When you have a couple dozen millepedes of that size crawling towards you with dubious intention, it doesn’t matter what biology says.  The lizard brain is screaming that you’re going to die and when dealing with the inhuman, it’s best to listen to the lizard brain.

The lizard brain is usually right.

I ran as fast I dared, scrambling over the tree roots on all fours.  They were growing over each other, building upwards into an increasingly steep mound.  The rain made the bark slick and treacherous.  I did not dare to look back, because I *knew* the millipedes were gaining on me, because they *had* to be, I was too slow and they weren’t impeded by the rain and the terrain like I was.   

I knew this wasn’t going to be easy.  But I hadn’t stopped to think of *how* it would be dangerous and what I could do to protect myself.  I’d done exactly as the devil had suggested and charged head-long without thinking.  The tricksters were catalysts for change, but that often had a price for the person doing as they bid.

There was nowhere to go now but forward.  I dragged myself along, my feet slipping on the wet bark, the surface of the roots feeling like a living plant at one moment and my fingertips scraping on gritty stone the next.  

Then I felt a sharp pain in my ankle.  I kicked reflexively, felt my shoe connect with something hard.  I threw myself forward, scrambling desperately upwards on terrain that was growing increasingly steeper.  It felt like the world was tilting beneath me, like I was Sisyphus about to lose hold of the rock and let it tumble helplessly down to the earth below.  

Another sharp pain in my calf.  I sobbed openly, kicking instead of climbing, dragging myself along with my hand and arms.  I felt one of my nails split, saw a brief line of blood before the rain whisked it away.  I could feel the millipedes gathering around me, their bites were like the prick of a needle, and I realized with horror that I could no longer feel my feet.  There were pins and needles in my legs, up to my knees.

I looked up and through the rain and my tears I could see the trunk of the tree.

I stretched out a hand.  My fingers touched its stony surface.  It felt warm to the touch.

There was a weight on my back.  I screamed, twisted, but it didn’t dislodge.  I could feel countless little pricks against my back, like needles, as it climbed up my shirt.  

My neck.  Seeking my neck.

With a cry, I shoved myself forwards, my useless legs dragging behind me, and I slammed the point of the stake into the side of the tree.

It was like shoving a knife into butter.  There was very little resistance.  It slid in an inch and stuck, the surface of the stake shining dully in the filtered sunlight.  I formed my hand into a fist, because there was nothing else I could do, I couldn’t protect myself any longer, but I could do *this*, I could finish what I started.

I slammed my fist against the butt of the stake and drove it the rest of the way into the tree.

A crack shot up and down from the stake.  That crack became a fissure, more cracks branched off like lightning, and the clicking of the millepede’s legs was replaced by a sound like ice breaking in the winter.  The tree was falling apart.  I wanted to laugh.  I’d done it.  I’d killed it.

I had no idea what this would actually do to campus and I no longer cared.

The pressure on my back vanished.  I watched dully as the millipedes scurried past me, crawling up the side of the tree and squeezing themselves into the widening cracks on its surface.  They vanished into the darkness.  Perhaps they were trying to save it or perhaps they were exploiting the opportunity I’d given them to destroy it.  At least I didn’t have to worry about them killing and eating me now.  I laughed weakly at that thought.  I might be unable to walk, the tree might be able to fall apart and crush me, but at least I didn’t have to deal with the millipedes.  

Yaaaaay.

I rolled over and began dragging myself away from the tree.  The roots were writhing all around me, like a handful of worms, and I tumbled down among them and slid and rolled downward, until I didn’t know what direction was up.  I curled into a ball, trying to protect my head, as my arms and back struck painfully against their stony surfaces.  Then they were gone, receding into the dirt, and I rolled a few more feet before my shoulder slammed against a headstone and I came to a stop on the muddy earth.

I lay there for a moment, breathing hard.  Alive.  I was still alive.  I could hear the cracking of the tree, but it sounded distant, like it was far, far away.  I didn’t feel like I had fallen that long, but at the same time, it felt like I’d traveled some great distance in doing so.  My entire body ached and while my legs were still numb, I was regrettably getting some feeling back in them.  They prickled with pain, like I’d rolled around in barbed wire.

There was a rasp from the right.  I rolled my head in that direction, too spent to even feel fear at this point.  A handful of yards away was the groundskeeper.  His feet dragged against the ground as he slowly walked towards me, stone rasping against stone.  There were cracks in his body, radiating outwards from his chest.  As I watched, a chunk of stone fell out of his shoulder, shattering when it hit the ground.  His hand soon followed, then the entire arm.  I just lay there, thinking distantly that I should try to get up and if my legs wouldn’t support me (and I didn’t think they would), then I should try to drag myself away before he could reach me and crush me underneath his stone feet.

But I just lay there.  I watched as he approached.  I looked at his face, immobile, strangely familiar now that I was looking - *really* looking - and wondered if Professor Monotone had any idea that this was what had become of his distant ancestor.  If he knew *why* he had become the groundskeeper.

He looked… mournful.  And I thought that perhaps he always had, because his face was made of stone, and stone couldn’t change.

Then his face slid off, crumbling into dust, and the rest of his body came apart shortly after.

I lay there and stared at the sky, at the rain coming down in earnest now.

“Ashley?!”

The world was spinning around me.  There was someone blocking my view, standing over me, stopping the rain from falling on my face.  They dropped to their knees with eyes wide with panic.

I wanted to laugh.  My manger.  From the food court.

“H-how - where -” 

He glanced around, trying to make sense of where we were and how he came to be here.  I let my head fall to the side.  I was so tired.  It would be so easy to just fall asleep right here.  Distantly, I heard him calling my name again, then I felt hands underneath my arms, my body lurched into motion against the wet ground, and then my chin fell to my chest and everything went dark.

I woke up in the town ER.

Frantically, I cast about for my cellphone.  I feared the worst.  Was Cassie trying to find me?  Had she said anything to campus security?  Did my parents know?  Was I unconscious for days, missing class?

*Had I missed the exam this week?!*

Fortunately it was still the same day, albeit late in the evening, so I hadn’t missed any exams.  However, there was a message from Cassie that read, ‘WHERE TF ARE YOU YOURE NOT SUPPOSED OT BE BY YOURSELF YOU BETTER NOT BE OFF DRINKING THAT DEATH WATER BITCH’ and then was followed by a string of angry face emojis, interspersed with a few knives.

Ah friendship.  I texted her back that no, I wasn’t at the power station, and that I’d explain everything when I got back.  Then I froze, as I finally realized that I recognized one of the voices on the other side of the curtain.

The devil.  It was the devil.  And he was discussing my discharge instructions with the doctor in the hallway.

I can think of worse situations to be in, but it took me a moment to come up with them.

I considered fleeing, but they were between me and the exit, and I was hooked up to an IV.  So I waited, trying to catch snippets of their conversation, until I heard them wrap it up and the curtain was pulled aside.  The devil slipped discreetly in, letting it fall shut behind him.  A very… normal… entrance, for once.  He even looked incongruously normal, suspenders aside.

“I took care of everything,” he said.  “I told everyone I’m your dad.  Met your former manager at the graveyard entrance and took over getting you to the ER from there.  They don’t know your real name.  The hospital bills are getting charged to the insurance policy of a random Senator.”

“Are you… committing fraud against the government?!”

“Don’t worry, they won’t notice,” he replied airly, waving his hand dismissively.  “The short of it is, you have nothing to worry about.”

I stared at the blanket covering my legs.  Tentatively, I wiggled my toes.  My feet and shins stung faintly with pain.  The devil’s eyes tracked my gaze, understanding what I was worried about.

“The poison will work its way out,” he said softly.  “The bite locations are swollen and blistered, but that’s the worst of it.  They prescribed hydrocortisone.  And they gave you fluids because, I don’t know, maybe they were bored.”

I frowned.  Surely he hadn’t told them about giant millipedes.

“Do you… know what happened?” I asked.

“Of course I do!  But don’t worry, I didn’t say anything about the millipedes or the tree to the doctor.”  Some of his typical levity was returning to his tone, which was frankly quite concerning.  “I fed them a gloriously bullshit story.  Something about rutting in a patch of thorned poison ivy.”

“You - what!?  That’s - that’s not a thing!”

“Rutting is absolutely a thing.”

I have only myself to blame for this situation.

I’m not sure how he explained the fact I was *unconscious* but I didn’t ask, I didn’t want to know what he’d invented at that point.  I just sat there in embarrassed silence when the nurse came in to remove my IV.  Then, discharge instructions in hand, I walked out of the hospital.

“I assume the tree is dead,” I said in a low voice to the devil.

“Very,” he confirmed.

“What happens now?”

“I’m not entirely sure.  And isn’t that exciting?”

He gleefully rubbed his hands together.  I wasn’t sure why I expected a real answer.

“I do know this,” he continued.  “When all of this is over, there won’t be anything to stop me from being on campus.”

I stopped cold.  This.  This was why he was so keen on me killing the tree.  I felt anger flare up in me, tight, hot, threatening to erupt because it was such a foreign emotion to me that I had no idea how to contain it.  I’d spent so long trying to be everything for everyone else that I was ill-equipped to handle my own emotions.  I swallowed several times, with difficulty.  If the devil noticed my struggles, he didn’t give any indication that he cared.

“So… everything up until this point,” I said slowly, “was all for this end?  Helping me kill the eye?  Protecting me from the flickering man?  *Helping me pass my classes*?  All because you want access to campus to cause *trouble* whenever you want?”

“Obviously.  I’m the devil.  The only person I care about is myself.”

Then he patted me on the shoulder and walked off, hands hooked in his pockets, whistling tunelessly.  Leaving me to find my own way back to my apartment.

This might be a college town and not much else but it still had people doing rideshares and I had my cellphone on me, so it wasn’t all that hard to get home.  I was still angry enough to be offended by every little thing he did, though.  My anger faded shortly after I stepped into the apartment, replaced by a bone-deep exhaustion, and I went to my room and collapsed into a [deep](https://alderrayne.com/) [sleep.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
