The woods near Ashford were never quiet. The wind that passed through the trees always seemed to carry whispers, like the forest itself was alive with secrets. But tonight, the air was still—too still—and Khalil could feel it in his bones.

He had been warned, of course. He had heard the stories from locals in the small town below: the vanishing families, the missing hikers, the hollowed-out stares of those who had dared to venture into the Ashford woods after sunset. There were whispers of a creature that haunted the darkest parts of the forest, a thing that fed on fear and despair. They called it The Wailing Hollower.

But Khalil wasn’t here to listen to ghost stories. He was here to find his brother.

Jamal had been missing for two weeks. He’d come up to Ashford for a camping trip, just to get away, to “clear his head,” he’d said. He’d promised to call every night, but after the second night, there was nothing. No calls. No messages.

Now, with the sky bleeding into twilight and the stars beginning to pierce the horizon, Khalil was deep in the woods, walking on a narrow trail that twisted between the gnarled trees. He knew better than to go after dark, but his fear was stronger than his sense of caution. He needed answers. He needed to know what had happened to Jamal.

He hadn’t heard the wail at first. It started as a faint, almost imperceptible sound, like the wind groaning through the trees. But as Khalil moved deeper into the forest, the sound began to take shape—a high, pitchy cry, like someone in agonizing pain. His heart skipped.

“Jamal?” he called, his voice cracking.

The wail grew louder. It didn’t sound like anything human, but it was unmistakable. His skin prickled, and every instinct in him told him to turn back, to run. But something about the sound called to him, pulling him forward.

He took another step, then another. His feet felt like they were moving on their own now. The shadows seemed to stretch around him like fingers, gripping at his ankles. The wail echoed again—closer, impossibly close now.

“Khalil…”

His name.

His blood ran cold. It was Jamal’s voice—he was sure of it. But it was distorted, like the sound of a drowning man. Desperation clawed at his chest, and without thinking, he ran toward the sound. He crashed through the underbrush, his breath coming in short gasps.

The trees thinned out into a small clearing, and there, in the center, stood a figure. At first, it looked like a person—a man, tall and thin, silhouetted by the dimming light. But as he drew closer, the figure shifted. Its limbs grew longer, thinner, bending unnaturally, and its head began to twist in a way no human body should ever bend.

Khalil stumbled to a stop, his mouth dry.

The creature was no longer human. The thing before him was a nightmare—its body gaunt and skeletal, covered in decaying, blackened skin that seemed to pulse and writhe. Where its face should have been was a deep, empty cavity, a black hole where its eyes and mouth should have been. The only sound that came from it was the agonizing, high-pitched wail that reverberated in his skull.

Khalil couldn’t move. He was frozen, staring at the hollow space where its face should have been, the darkness inside it shifting like a living thing. The creature reached out with one of its impossibly long arms, its fingers curling like claws.

“Khalil… come closer…”

His mind screamed for him to turn and run, but his body wouldn’t obey. The sound of Jamal’s voice called to him, pulling him forward. He felt a sick, deep pull toward the thing. It wasn’t just a voice—it was a feeling, a sensation of loss, of yearning, like it was pulling from the very core of his being.

“Jamal?” His voice was a broken whisper.

The Wailing Hollower took a step toward him. It was slow, deliberate, like it had all the time in the world. Khalil took an instinctive step back, but the creature’s presence filled the clearing, making it impossible to escape. He was trapped in its gaze, in the sound of the wail that seemed to drown out every other thought in his mind.

Then, from the depths of the shadow where its face should have been, came another voice. It was faint, fragile, barely a whisper.

“Khalil…”

This time, it wasn’t Jamal. It was his mother’s voice.

He gasped, his breath seizing in his chest. The wail twisted in his mind, becoming a hundred voices—each one more desperate than the last. The sound filled his ears, drowning out all other thoughts. He remembered the day his brother had gone missing—the guilt, the fear that had gnawed at him ever since.

He remembered the day his mother had passed, the sharp, gnawing pain of loss that had never quite left him.

“I am the void,” the creature whispered. “You are mine.”

And in that moment, Khalil understood. The Wailing Hollower didn’t just take lives—it took souls. It devoured the light of hope, feeding on the pain and grief of those it trapped. And Khalil, caught in its wail, was just another piece of the hunger, another soul to devour.

The last thing he saw before everything went black was the void, stretching wide, pulling him into it. The wail echoed, and then… nothing.
