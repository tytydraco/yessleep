Two weeks had passed since Fred died.
He’d been my best friend since childhood. I still couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that I’d never see him again. They said it was a car accident, but the mortician had done a great job. Fred, lying there in the coffin, didn’t look like someone who’d been in a head-on collision.

Not long ago, I got a letter from his lawyer. Fred had left me his house.

I couldn’t believe my eyes.
I knew he was well-off, he owned several apartments and houses, but I never really knew what he did for a living. And now he was gifting me one of them? After his death?
It totally caught me off guard. Fred was divorced and had two teenage kids. Why would he leave it to me?

Still, I decided to go check it out. The house was in the suburbs, not too far away. But it took me a while to gather the courage to actually step inside. I was afraid of how the memories tied to that place would hit me.


But eventually, I made up my mind to go out there one weekend. I had a key, the lawyer had sent it along. It fit the front door. The house was massive. Two stories, a wide front porch, a big yard, and a quiet, pretty neighborhood. It was exactly the kind of house I’d always dreamed of.

The furniture inside looked like it belonged to an old man. There was a musty smell in the air, like no one had set foot there in ages. I started checking out the rooms, trying to get a sense of what was where, when suddenly,  I heard a loud noise. It was coming from upstairs.

I grabbed a fire iron from next to the living room fireplace and headed up.
Whatever was up there, I was ready to defend myself.
The noise came from one of the bedrooms. It sounded like someone was rummaging through drawers or searching for something.

I kicked the door open and burst in, yelling.
But the shock stopped me cold. It was Fred.
My old best friend—alive, well, standing there in perfect health—and digging through a sock drawer. He stared at me, just as stunned as I was.


I stood frozen in the room, still holding the fire iron, ready to swing. Fred just licked his lips and blinked at me nervously. He didn’t seem like himself. And then—from behind me, by the busted door—I heard a familiar voice:


“Randy, please put down the iron,” the voice said calmly.


I turned around slowly, trying to see who it was, and nearly passed out.
Fred was standing there too. Exactly the same as the one digging through the sock drawer. Exactly the same as the one I’d seen in a coffin two weeks ago.


“What the fuck?!” I blurted out.


“Randy, don’t freak out, please,” said the Fred at the door. “But I think… I think you might understand this eventually.”


The Fred in the doorway led me down to the living room and sat me on the couch. He took a deep breath, like he was about to give a speech.


“Randy… as you can see, I’m not dead,” Fred finally said.


I just stared at him, utterly lost. What the hell was going on with my best friend? Did I ever really know him?


“Randy, please, just listen to what I’m about to tell you. I can’t explain it any better,” he went on.


I nodded. I couldn’t get a single word out, even if I’d tried.


“So…” Fred stepped closer. “I can clone myself, Randy. It works in the upstairs wardrobe. This house used to belong to my parents. And when I was a teenager, I figured out that the wardrobe could clone things. Eventually… it could clone me too. Don’t ask me how I discovered it, or what exactly it is. But if you put something in the wardrobe and wait exactly 195 seconds… when you open it, there’ll be two.”


I just stared at him, stunned. What the hell was he talking about? And how was he even alive?


“Fred,” I finally said, half in a trance, “what the hell is going on?”


Fred let out a deep sigh, like he was the one disappointed.


“I told you, Randy. I can clone myself. The one who died, the one you saw in the coffin, that was a clone. The one upstairs, too.”


“And how many of you are there?!” I snapped, finally losing it.


“Seven,” Fred said without missing a beat. “Well… wait. One of them died, he got found. Another one’s on an expedition in Antarctica. So I guess… five of us. Here.”


I stared at him, jaw slowly dropping open. My best friend, the guy I thought I knew better than anyone, wasn’t even who he claimed to be. Or maybe I never really knew him at all.


“But don’t worry, Randy,” Fred said, puffing out his chest like he was proud, “I’m the original.”


“Oh, give me a break,” someone interrupted, standing in the kitchen doorway. “You the original? Don’t make me laugh.”


I turned, and what I saw just short-circuited my brain. Two more Freds. One looked completely normal, just like the old Fred I remembered. The other… had no legs, sitting in a wheelchair.


The Freds were shouting over each other, each one claiming to be the original and arguing why he was the real one. Even the legless Fred in the wheelchair joined the fight.
I sat on the couch, completely stunned. This whole thing felt like a bad sketch comedy. Just a few hours ago, I was mourning my best friend, now there were three of him, all bickering about who’s who.


“Enough!” someone finally yelled.


Another Fred, one I hadn’t seen yet, stood on the staircase leading to the second floor, looking down at the others with clear disdain.
The rest of the Freds fell quiet. Well... more like they just rolled their eyes and grumbled under their breath.


“Freds,” said the one on the stairs, “don’t you see who’s here? Don’t you realize this is the one person we can trust? Our best friend?”


I didn’t know what to say, or whether I should say anything at all. This new Fred looked a lot like the friend I remembered. But even he felt off somehow. It was like all of them, were missing a piece of something. Not just physically. Emotionally, mentally... spiritually maybe?


“I’m sorry, Randy,” the Fred on the stairs said as he came over. “I didn’t want you to find out like this. But since that other Fred died, we’re in trouble. The world thinks I'm gone..”


Suddenly, a door slammed open upstairs and another Fred bolted down the hallway, screaming that he couldn’t take it anymore, that he needed the stuff. Two of the Freds tackled him and pinned him to the ground while the wheelchair Fred kept yelling that he couldn’t go outside or they’d all be exposed.

The Fred who had come down the stairs gave me a sheepish, tired smile.


“I’m sorry about that too, Randy,” he said. “That Fred’s got a bit of a cocaine problem. But give us a few days. Please. Come back later.”


I just sat there blinking. What the hell was I even supposed to say?
And then, somehow, I was politely but firmly ushered out of the house. That Fred kept gently nudging me toward the door until I found myself standing outside.

But at least I still had the key. So I locked it behind me.


Four days had passed.
I hadn’t gone back once. I just didn’t know what to do. What can you do in a situation like this? My best friend had died, or so I thought, but now it turned out there were at least six more of him. And none of them acted like the Fred I remembered. So where was the real one? Had he really died?

I tried to go on with my everyday life, but all I could think about was the Freds. I just hoped they’d stay in that house before something worse happened.

But I couldn’t take it anymore. Late one afternoon, I found myself standing outside the house again, and even from the outside, I could already hear weird noises.

When I stepped inside, the place was total chaos.
Instead of the five Freds I had seen last time, there were at least twenty now. Some of them were arguing. A few seemed to be reliving their teenage years—smoking weed and stuffing chips into their mouths. Others were just... there, like they had no clue what to do with themselves.

And if that wasn’t enough, there were some seriously weird Freds too. One of them was obsessively cleaning in a little maid outfit, despite the house being an absolute dump. Another Fred... well, she wasn’t a Fred. Or, she was, just... female. Looked exactly like the rest, but with boobs and curves.
And in the kitchen, one Fred was lying pale on the floor, staring into nothing. That Fred looked exactly like the one we buried.
Dead again.


“Heyyy, Randy, dude!” one Fred slapped me on the shoulder. “Finally, bro, you’re back!”


This one must’ve been College Fred, at least mentally. He had that chill, bro-y vibe. Just like back in our university days.


“Fred? What the hell is going on?! Why are there so many of you?!” I snapped, on the verge of losing it.


“Man, I dunno, but someone’s got really good weed. Can you order a pizza?”


I just walked away, rolling my eyes so hard I nearly blacked out.
The whole house felt like a mix between a frat party, a drug den, and a corporate retreat. A dwarf Fred ran out of one room, chased by another Fred shouting angrily after him.
That’s when I spotted the wheelchair Fred, finally someone from last time. Maybe I could actually talk to him.
He was sipping a beer in the corner, calmly watching the house fall apart and the Freds having the time of their lives.


“Fred, what the hell is this?!” I demanded, standing in front of him.


“Ah, Randy, buddy, glad you’re here,” said wheelchair Fred, perking up. “Beer?”


“I don’t want a beer!” I growled. “Why are there so many of you?!”


“Well… there was a bit of a problem,” Fred mumbled, looking down.


We sat in the study: the wheelchair Fred, another Fred, the one who had promised last time to fix everything, and me.
I was beyond pissed. My best friend was dead, or at least I thought he was, and now his clones were trashing his parents’ house.


“Randy, I’m sorry,” Fred started. “I know I said I’d take care of it, but things kind of spiraled out of control.”


I shook my head in frustration. My thoughts were racing. What the hell was I supposed to do now?


“Who died?” I asked after a moment.


“Well… the druggie did. Overdosed,” Fred said.


“Not him!” I snapped. “The one in the damn coffin!”


“That was a Fred clone,” Fred replied, taking a seat behind the desk. “He didn’t want to cooperate with the rest of us, so he bailed.”


“Then where’s the real Fred?” I demanded.


“I told you, it’s me,” he said, giving me a pleading look from behind the desk.


I said nothing. I knew he wasn’t the real Fred. He acted weird, and there was something off in the way he talked. Cold. Detached. But I had to get this mess under control. It couldn’t go on like this.


“Fred, why the hell did you make so many clones?” I asked suspiciously.


Fred let out a long sigh. The wheelchair Fred silently rolled out of the room and shut the door behind him.


“Randy, how do I put this…” Fred began. “Back when there were only seven of us, it worked perfectly. That was my optimal number. I had time for everything, we collaborated, divided the workload, took on multiple jobs at once. It was… efficient. The only one who ever suspected anything was Julia. My wife. She left me.”


“And now what?” I interrupted.


“Well… now it’s all fucked,” he said bluntly. “That Fred died, so the world thinks I’m dead. And the other clones started fighting. The whole system of who made who, who’s original and who’s not... it broke down.”


I rubbed my temples in frustration. This Fred was smart. Too smart. And I didn’t trust him.


“How do we fix this? We can’t have all of you running around,” I said impatiently.


Fred just stared at me, serious. I could see in his eyes that he knew the answer, but I wasn’t going to like it.


“The Freds who think they’re still young... they’re uncontrollable,” he said coldly. “We have to take care of them.”


“What do you mean, take care of them?” I asked warily.


Fred stood up from the desk and walked over to a picture frame on the wall. He removed it, revealing a hidden safe. He opened it. Inside was more cash than I’d ever seen in my life.
I stared at him in shock, what the hell was he planning to do with all that money?


“Randy,” Fred said calmly, “bring me a weapon… and I’ll clean this whole thing up.”


I don’t know why, but I did it. I brought a gun to that Fred.

He thanked me, even gave me a bit of extra cash for the trouble. Said this was going to be hard for him too, but he needed to rethink his whole life. Told me to drop by in a few days, by then, everything would be sorted out.

Somewhere deep inside, I felt a tiny bit of relief…But at the same time, I was terrified.
What if someone found out what was going on in that house? What if one of them got out?

I couldn’t stop thinking about it for days. I barely slept. I even started watching the news, just in case some Fred turned up as a criminal... or maybe “died” again. But nothing happened. So I made up my mind: That day, after work, I’d go to the house. See what the hell was going on.


As soon as I arrived, I knew something was off.
All the curtains in the house were drawn, no one could see in, but every single light was on. And from inside, I could hear what sounded like music playing.
I opened the door, and what I saw was pure madness.

Freddies were everywhere. But not like before.
They stood in perfect formation, neatly lined up, all staring up at the staircase. And every single one of them was wearing a uniform, gray suits with black armbands bearing a big letter "F".

The house was packed with Freddies. All of them looked exactly the same, no sign of the youthful, dwarf, female, or crippled Freddies from last time.
I pushed my way closer to the stairs, trying to get a better view of what was happening.


“Ah, welcome, Randy,” said one of the uniformed Freddies, turning to me. “I’m glad you made it.”


“What the fuck is going on here, Fred?!” I growled at him.


“Oh, I’ll explain in a moment, but the speech of the One True Fred is about to begin. We’ll talk after.”


Then he turned away from me, pretending like I wasn’t even there. The rest did the same. They all stared in awe at the top of the stairs. Not a single sound, even the soft, life-giving music that had been playing suddenly stopped.
And then, one Fred stepped out at the top of the stairs.
He was dressed like a general—fancy uniform, stars and medals, a damn hat. And on his side… was a pistol.
The same fucking pistol I brought.


"Freddies," General Fred began, "my brothers. This place is no longer enough for us. This house is our fortress, but the outside world… it's corrupt. The people out there could never achieve our greatness. They bicker and divide. That’s why, Freddies, I decree, we must go out into the world, with even more of our brothers. We must take control, and bring order and unity to the world, just like in our house!"


The Freddies erupted in cheers.They whooped and hollered like they’d just heard the greatest speech of their lives. They were practically in ecstasy. 
I got pushed all the way to the edge of the room by the sheer mass of them.
General Fred waved his arms like he was some kind of god to these people, or whatever you’d call them.
I quickly crawled over the couch and shoved my way between a dozen Freddies. I made it to the stairs and started yelling and waving at General Fred.
He finally noticed me in the middle of his glory parade and signaled for me to come up.


"Randy! So glad you’re here again!" General Fred wrapped an arm around my shoulder, beaming. He kept waving at the crowd of Freddies. "Come, Randy. I want to show you something," he said proudly, turning away from his faithful followers.


General Fred, along with a few Freddies whose armbands said "FF" instead of just "F", led me into a side room. And there, my jaw almost hit the floor.

The room looked like a full-on military operations center: Maps and tactical diagrams covered the walls, Freddies in uniforms worked feverishly, all with the "FF" insignia on their sleeves. And then… crates. Crates filled with pistols and ammunition.
They were cloning the fucking gun I brought.


"Fred, what the actual fuck are you doing?!" I snapped, once the shock wore off.


"Randy, please," General Fred said in a calm, patronizing voice. "Can’t you see? I’m building the future. A better one."


I stepped toward him, ready to punch him in the face. But as I did, the other Freddies tensed up. To them, this Fred was some kind of messiah.


"Randy, can’t you see?" he continued. "I’m not doing this just for me. People will never be as united as we are, Randy. That’s why we have to lead them."


"You’re fucking insane!" I shouted. "You’re talking about world domination with an army of bootleg yous and a bunch of pistols? You’re gonna march out in front of your clone-army like some kind of Nazi lunatic?! Are you hearing yourself?!"


Fred’s face darkened. He didn’t look at me like a friend anymore. He looked at me like a traitor.

"Randy, I thought you understood," he said coldly. "But you’re just like the rest of them. Please, just leave."


"You’ve lost your mind," I muttered, refusing to back down. "And honestly, I don’t even think you’re the original Fred. I think he’s really dead."


Fred’s eyes burned. He looked seconds away from shooting me right there.


"Get him out of the house," he said flatly.


Two Freddies grabbed me, twisted my arm behind my back. I hit the floor, but they yanked me back up and dragged me along. Down the stairs, past the stunned faces of the crowd.
No one said a word. They opened the front door, and threw me out.

I sat there on the porch, rubbing my aching arm. One thought kept repeating in my mind: My friend is dead. And these things are desecrating his memory. They have to be stopped.


I gave myself just a few days to prepare. I had to stop the Frednazis’ world domination plans before it was too late.I stocked up on everything, spending all my savings, plus the cash I’d gotten from Fred. I bought weapons: rifles, pistols, knives, anything I could use to hunt down the Freddies.

My car was already parked in front of the house. And I was sitting inside, dressed like a goddamn Rambo. I even had a headband and a sleeveless shirt, though it was early autumn, and yeah, I was freezing my ass off. But if madness was what they wanted, I was going to answer with pure, unhinged madness.

I’d already smoked three cigarettes out of pure nerves, but there was no other choice anymore. This situation had gone completely off the rails.

So there I stood, right in front of that massive front door. I popped a piece of gum in my mouth. And in my head, I could already hear the bells of heaven tolling.


With a single kick, I smashed the front door open.

The shotgun tore several of the Freddies to pieces. I caught them completely off guard. They were planning something again, or whatever the hell they do.
I’d never seen a human body rip apart like that in my life. But I didn’t wait. I just kept shooting.

Some of the Freddies tried to hide. Others rushed at me. They swarmed me like a flood, but I just kept pouring lead into them. Blood splattered up to the ceiling. A piece of intestine hung from the couch. One Freddie’s head literally exploded right in front of me when I pulled the trigger. The room, which just moments ago had been packed with Nazi wannabe Freddies, was now a blood-soaked massacre. 
Some ran upstairs, others locked themselves in another room. But me? I was the butcher now. And there was no tomorrow. I was ending this today.


Problem was, I was more like a B-movie Rambo. I had no idea how to reload the shotgun. Took me a while to even figure out which part went where.
Some of the Freddies took full advantage of that. Four of them jumped me out of nowhere. One grabbed the shotgun and tried to wrestle it away. But he did it so clumsily that I just pulled the trigger, and blew his arm clean off.

The second one I shot in the chest. Chunks of Fred hit me in the face.
The third Freddie managed to yank the shotgun from my hands, aimed it at me, and pulled the trigger, but the chamber was empty.
I didn’t wait. In one motion, I drew one of the pistols strapped to my thigh and emptied six rounds into him.
Then came the fourth Freddie. He tackled me, knocked the pistol from my hand, it slid far across the floor. We wrestled our way into the kitchen, trading pathetic punches. Neither of us was exactly in top shape.
A few more Freddies were waiting in the kitchen. They jumped me too. But I wasn’t going down easy, I kicked, clawed, bit.
One of them managed to pin me against the counter. Another Freddie stabbed a dessert fork into my thigh. I screamed so loud it gave me a second wind. I broke free, reached across my chest, and pulled out two more pistols.

I let them have it. I squeezed the triggers with everything I had. Freddie blood painted the walls. At least ten more dropped in that kitchen carnage.
When the gun smoke cleared, another Freddie lunged at me, this one with a knife. And, of course, I had just emptied both magazines.
I grabbed one of the pistols and threw it at him, hit him square in the temple, and he dropped. I straddled him, grabbed a shattered plate shard from the floor, and slit his throat.


Then I took a deep breath and pulled out the uzi slung across my back. This would be the end of the Freddies.
I yanked open the dining room door. The Freddies inside were hiding behind an overturned table, and as soon as they saw me, they started throwing cutlery.
But I had the uzi. It was locked, loaded, and ready. I squeezed the trigger and shredded the table. Blood sprayed across the walls. The Freddies collapsed behind it,dead.
Downstairs was clear. Just me… and the bodies.

Now only the upstairs remained, the headquarters.


I stumbled a bit as I climbed the stairs. The little dessert fork was still sticking out of my leg.
I hadn’t had time to pull it out, and honestly, I thought it looked kind of badass.

The uzi was empty, I didn’t even buy the right ammo for it. So I was down to one pistol, and the secret weapon I bought from some shady guy in an alley: a live grenade. 
The stairs were slick with blood and bits of Freddie.
The first door upstairs opened to a small bedroom. Empty, no Freddie in sight. But as I turned to leave, the bathroom door burst open and a Freddie lunged at me.
Thanks to my quick reflexes, I dodged. He slipped in the blood and tumbled over the railing.
As he lay below, groaning, I put a bullet in him, just to be sure.

But he wasn’t alone in the bathroom. Another Freddie yanked me inside and slammed me against the cabinet. The glass shattered, shards embedded in my back.
I responded with a solid groin kick, sending him stumbling. He fell into the shower stall, I jumped in after him, wrapped the shower hose around his neck, and choked him out.
Didn’t take long. Dead.

I hoped there wouldn’t be too many more. I was exhausted, and the pain wasn’t helping. If I had to guess, there were maybe 20–30 Freddies left. Most were taken down at the entrance and in the dining room.


The next door in the hallway was the door. The war room. The eagle’s nest.
I opened it carefully, pistol drawn, but they had the drop on me.
Bullets tore through the wooden door. Three slammed into my arm. Another pierced my side.
I collapsed onto the hallway floor with a scream. Still, I squeezed off a few shots, so it wouldn’t look like I went down without a fight.

Then, channeling every story Grandpa ever told me about the war, I started crawling down the hallway. Bullets zipped over my head.
Somehow I dragged myself into another room, thinking I might catch my breath.
Wrong.

As I shoved the door open, two massive hands grabbed me. They threw me against the wall,
and one started choking me.
Mega Freddie. Twice my size. Probably eats steroids for breakfast.

I reached for his face, planning to gouge his eyes out, but that’s when I realized two of my fingers were gone. Shot clean off. He casually swatted my hand away like a fly.
But then I remembered the knife I’d stashed on my hip. I grabbed it and stabbed him in the chest, but he didn’t even flinch. He just squeezed harder.

I kept stabbing, again and again, until finally I jammed the blade into his neck.
His eyes rolled back. He let go.
I collapsed to the floor, gasping. My body was done. Blood poured from everywhere.
That’s when I saw it. A white wardrobe. Just standing there.
Was this it? The cloning wardrobe?


One idea struck me.
I crawled into the wardrobe and shut the doors behind me. How long was it again? 180 seconds? 200? No, got it. 195.
I started counting. When the time was up, I yanked the door open.
Two of us fell out. Me, and my clone. He looked exactly like me. Same wounds, same bleeding, same pain on his face.


“Take this,” I said immediately, shoving the grenade into his hand. “Go to the other room.”


He just stared at me with a look of pain and confusion. His fingers were bleeding, same spots as mine. He really was me in every way.


“I don’t want to,” he mumbled eventually. “I don’t want to die.”


“Shut the hell up and do what I say!” I barked at him.


“No,” he snapped. “Why the hell would I?”


“Because I’m the original! You do what I say!”


My clone looked at me nervously, then took the grenade. He slowly got to his feet and hobbled to the door.


“Fine,” he muttered as he stood in the doorway. “I’ll do it.”


Then he limped out. I waited. And waited. 
BOOM.

The whole building shook. For a moment, I thought it was going to collapse.
I waited a bit longer, then crawled out of hiding.
The hallway was filled with smoke. The walls were cracked. I limped down to the operations room. The door was gone. So were the windows. Inside: a bloodbath. A few Freddies were still groaning, twitching.

General Fred sat slumped in a chair, drenched in blood. I nudged him. He stirred, wheezing.
His face was full of shrapnel. Blood poured from every inch of him.


“Randy?” he croaked. “Randy, why’d you do it? I thought you believed in the American military…”


“Fred,” I groaned, barely standing myself. “I couldn’t let you do this to Fred’s memory.
I buried him. No one’s gonna remember him as some crazy little dictator.”


Fred coughed blood. He couldn’t move anymore.


“Randy...” he said again, in a dying voice. “Come closer.”


I leaned in.


“Randy...” he said. “Randy, you stupid dipshit… I was the original. I just... got bored at home.”
