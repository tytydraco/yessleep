That morning the light of the sun showed through the window of the dusty window of the pitch black room of the sunny day's motel. Daisy laid down on her back, looking up at the leaky ceiling, thinking about how the desk boy made her feel. Only two minutes of silence had passed before the voice interrupted her thoughts, having invasive opinions on the matter on which she is supposed to meet him for breakfast in an hour.

 Daisy tried to block out the voice, but as she was looking at herself in the mirror she realized that she had nothing to wear, and she had many bruises and scratches on her body. "Psst..." the voice vibrated in her head. "Ugh! What do you want now?!" Daisy looked more annoyed and tired to hear from the voice today. As she stared into the mirror, she saw something in the corner of her eyes materialize. It looked long and thin, almost iridescent humanoid shape. It stood there for a good minute materializing fully. Daisy rubbed her eyes, thinking she was going more insane than she already was. She looked behind her and back to the mirror and gasped. The creature in the mirror opened its eyes and they were bright gold. Just like hers the last time she broke out of the lab.

She let out a gasp and jumped back. "Um that was kind of rude, I'm not that bad looking" the voice stated, smirking, letting out a deep chuckle. "Just because I don't have a body of my own, does not mean I don't have feelings." He looks at daisy with a fake frown. Eyes wide mouth open daisy looks at the figure in shock. " Am I still dreaming?" 

"Ha Ha, no. This is me. Well, kind of." Says the voice. Daisy blinks faster, trying to convince herself that she is dreaming. 'Well, if this is you, how come you are in there and not out here?"

"Okay look, I can stand here all day about who I am, what I am, and why I am just in your head, or I can help you figure out what to do about this breakfast fiasco you got us into." 

Daisy was still shocked and trying to make sense of whatever he gave him a lingering look as she started to back up slowly not turning her back quite yet. When she couldn't back up anymore she turned and made her way back to the main area of the room. Are you done ignoring now and willing to listen?"

Daisy sits on the edge of the bed silent, giving a slight nod. "Okay, so here's what we're gonna do." The voice took a long pause, to make sure she was listening.

Fifteen minutes passed and Daisy started to feel more nervous than ever. She checked the mirror one last time to see if the voice would materialize as it did the first time. Nothing, so she carried on with getting ready for breakfast. She pulled her hair back and saw the needle puncture the doctor made and brushed her hair back down just as fast. Once she got the courage, she took a deep breath and twisted the door knob, and stood out the door waiting.  She looked down the hall not knowing which way to go. The hotel seemed bigger than before and in each direction, no part stood out. She closed her eyes and just picked a direction to go and started walking. This hallway was never-ending. Daisy started to panic because no matter which turns she took it just kept getting longer and longer. As she stood there she started to panic and breathe heavier and faster. Before she felt a tap on her shoulder.

"Hey, your early.. are you okay?" She turned and took a second to realize it was the desk boy. "Oh, yeah I'm good I was just..lost in thought." She started blushing because she saw that he looked a bit confused. He gave a reassuring smile and reached out his hand. "Take his hand," The voice said in a loud whisper. he took his hand and for a second she felt an actual spark of electricity, and not like the metaphorical spark that she has read about in books, but like an actual shock. He must have felt it too because his eyes widened and he looked in a different direction as if he was trying to hide the fact he knew. "Oh I'm sorry that was uh, the carpet, I have been up and down these halls so much the static builds up a lot."

"Oh, no worries, it's ok," Daisy gives the same smile he gave her. They walk down to the kitchen and he gives her a grin, "shh, no one is allowed in here, so we gotta be quick." He goes to grab daisy's hand and they run into the kitchen, dodging the cooks and servers. They run slouched over, grabbing toast, yogurt, ice cream, and a whole plate of bacon. They give each other big smiles and ran out the back. The two went outside and sat on the cobblestone steps. Looking at the growing oak tree next to a bed of purple flowers and patch of vegetables. The two sat in silence for a while until it was broken by the desk boy. "My name is Seth by the way." Daisy snapped out of her head. "What?"

"My name is Seth." I don't wear my name tag because I lost it in a bar trying to break up a fight between two of my friends, but I could not go back for it because the cops showed up and I couldn't get taken in. That's the night you show up out of nowhere." Daisy gave him a nervous look because if they had gotten there around the same time what if he saw her escape? "Hey, chill out, you already look suspicious enough. I am sure he does not know where we came from" the voice buzzed in her skull. Daisy looked at Seth and started eating bacon. "A Bar fight? How did that even happen?" Daisy asked to try and change the subject. Seth gave her an interesting look. Not expecting her to ask. "Well, My friend had one too many and ended up trying to hit on this other guy's girl and just got out of hand and my other friend just got in his face. Pretty basic." Puzzled because it was not basic. If anything Daisy was more confused because she lived her whole life in that ward, but tried to make it seem like she knew.

Seth looked at Daisy as if he were trying to figure her out. Once they were done with their food Seth took Daisy by the hand and she took his. The two walked down the hall with smiles on their face. When they came up to the door of Daisy's room Seth stood in front of her. "Ooo look, he's gonna kiss you now" the voice came back out randomly. Seth took a step forward and started leaning in. Daisy slowly closed her eyes and felt another shock on her lips. She opened her eyes wide and he pulled back. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean.."

"No, it's okay, ha static must be really strong here I guess." Daisy gives him a reassuring smile and he starts blushing and looks down at the floor. "So, may I see you again?" He asks, slowly looking back up at her. A strand of blond hair falls slowly covering his eye. Yes, I would like that very much," Daisy spews out without a second thought.

"Oh okay great, So tomorrow good?" A nervous smile comes across his face.

 "Tomorrow is perfect." The two give each other a long look before Seth turns to head to his shift. Daisy closes the door slowly with a big smile taking over her face.
