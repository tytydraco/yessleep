Four girls went into an abandoned house one night, and only one happened to come back out. The year was 1998, a crisp fall night, late August, before we were due back for our senior year of high school. We were the core four; Maeve, Tilly, Fran, and I. It had been Maeve’s suggestion, going into that house. She was the ringleader of our group, so we always followed suit with what she said.

The locals called it the Hannager House, based off the Hannager family that used to live there. Rumors swelled around our small town as to what happened to them. Some say the family picked up and moved without leaving behind a trace, others say that it had been a murder-suicide and the bodies were never recovered. Regardless, the Hannager family had been there one day, and then the next, they were gone. This had happened before our group had even been born.

The house stood before us, enticing but terrifying. The wind picked up, causing the trees to whisper to us as we climbed the steps to the front door in a line. We were ready to be the cool kids, bragging about our adventures into a creepy, supposedly haunted house the first day of school. None of us believed it, of course. Some neighbors on the street claimed they would see a light on in the top left window, others said they could hear occasional screams or see shadows floating by. Originally, the cops would be called to investigate, but they would find nothing. So now, it was just normal. Everyone treated it as something they had to get used to if they were going to be living there.

Maeve entered the house first, the door creaking and the shutters breathing as if the house sensed that we were stepping foot inside.  
“Are we sure this is okay?” I called out to Maeve, being the last one to enter. Everyone had switched on their flashlights, giggling as they spread out throughout the first floor. I was not scared, I had assured everyone that I didn’t believe in hauntings, but I was more worried about getting caught. I switched my flashlight on as well, engulfing the front corridor in light. The house had not been touched since the Hannager family had vanished. Dust swirled in the flash of my light, and I coughed and waved my hand through the air as I walked through a few cobwebs.

“Gwen, hurry and catch up! Don’t be a scaredy cat!” Tilly called out, continuing to laugh as her and the other two gathered in the kitchen. I sighed, moving across the dining room to find them. The wallpaper had all but peeled itself off, making the interior look even more gross than I thought possible. I shivered in thought about having to be in here any longer, but I refused to admit it. We gathered in the kitchen, and I smiled at Maeve’s camera lens as she demanded a selfie to commemorate our journey. Our laughter was cut short as we heard footsteps above us. Tilly, Fran, and I gasped, as Maeve rolled her eyes.

“Come on guys, it’s probably just a rat. This place has to be crawling with small animals. Let’s go explore!” Maeve demanded, grabbing my hand, while I reached for the other two and we headed onwards. Maeve led the way, as usual, up the spiraling staircase. We reached the second floor, and my eyes immediately darted to the string hanging from the ceiling. It had to be an attic, but with no windows? No one had ever talked about there being an attic.

The girls made no notice of it, spreading out again amongst the three bedrooms that were up there. As I recalled, there were the parents and two kids that had once been. I slowly crept through the hallway into one of the kids’ bedrooms, covering my face with my sleeve from all the mold and dust that spilled out once the door had been opened. Pieces of the ceiling had crumbled down, leaving small patches to be missing. The room felt overly cold, which was wrong for how warm it had been when we stepped in. I backed out quickly, feeling a sense of dread. The air felt wrong, like we shouldn’t be breathing it in. I had not turned fully around before I heard another creak. And this time, there was weight to it. It was then that I had realized it had been pure silence. No sounds from Maeve, Tilly, or Fran came forth.

“Guys?” I whispered; my eyes shut as I fully made a turn. There was no response, only the sounds of heavy breathing. With my eyes still closed, I reached out and felt for the banister leading back downstairs. I ran, faster than I had ever before, as heavy thumps sounded behind me. I kept going, going, going, until I felt my heart would burst; I made it outside back into that warm Autumn air, falling onto the front lawn. Tears ran down my face as I finally let go of the breath I had been holding. I refused to look back until I made it out onto the sidewalk. The front door was swinging in the wind, and I caught a glimpse of it. The thing that had taken my friends, the monster with its glowing, bright eyes, the sharp teeth glistening in the darkness. This thing would continue to be in my nightmares, even after I left that town the next year. My friends were never found, and all I can remember is the creature waving to me as it shut the door.
