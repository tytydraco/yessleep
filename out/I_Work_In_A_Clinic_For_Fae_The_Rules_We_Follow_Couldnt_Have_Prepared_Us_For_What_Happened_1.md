Let me just start off by saying that despite everything, I do consider my job to be rewarding. I’ve got the ability to actually help people. People who might not be able to get the help they need elsewhere. Not a lot of people can say that.

&#x200B;

Now… the people I help might not technically be people. But as you’ve probably guessed, I just consider that a technicality. Sure, a bloodsucking siren who can hypnotize you with a stare might not technically be considered a human. But they still need medical care, and the organization that I work for provides it.

&#x200B;

Alright so let me just rip off the band aid here.

&#x200B;

Yes. Monsters are real.

&#x200B;

No. They don’t like it when you call them monsters, the appropriate term is ‘Fae’.

&#x200B;

Yes. I know the term ‘fae’ doesn’t always fit them, but we needed a generalized term that wasn’t ‘*monsters*’ since that word has kind of a negative connotation and *fae* was the one everyone just kinda settled on.

&#x200B;

No, all fae are not evil. Some of them are real pricks, but most of them just want to be left alone to live their lives in peace and I’m pretty sure that’s just what most people want. They can be dangerous, although really the danger they pose has been on the decline since the Imperium popped up about 40 years ago and started organizing them. Thanks to the Imperium, the number of people killed by fae (mostly by vampires and sirens) has been on the decline, the Arachne have been able to set up their habitats in safe places where they can be left alone to farm bugs to their hearts content and the Gorgon population has been on the rise! No real change with the Werewolves or the Mau… but they were always better integrated into society than most.

&#x200B;

See, the Imperium did the impossible. They built infrastructure to support the dwindling numbers of fae out there, and they did it without anyone even noticing.

&#x200B;

Take the hospital that I work in, for instance.

&#x200B;

It’s a four storey tall building that’s by all accounts, fairly unremarkable. On the surface, we operate just like any other hospital. Most of our patients are fully human and they’re none the wiser to what we’re doing in the *Specialty Clinic*, right beneath their feet;

&#x200B;

That sounds sinister… just to clarify, what we’re doing in the *Specialty Clinic* is providing healthcare to fae. I’m sure some people would consider that to be sinister, but I don’t. With that all said, though… this job isn’t exactly all sunshine, lollipops and rainbows.

&#x200B;

Working closely with Fae is always tricky and it feels a little cliche to say it, but we have a fairly strict set of rules in place to make sure that everything runs smoothly. I won’t go over all of them… trust me, it’s a long, long list. Some of the rules are probably redundant, some are just there to protect newbies and different rules can apply depending on what section of the Specialty Clinic you’re in. So for starters I’ll just cover the 5 main ones.

&#x200B;

***1: Patients must remain in their assigned rooms during the duration of their care.***

&#x200B;

This rule exists for a number of reasons. Firstly, to prevent any bad actors from causing trouble and secondly, to prevent any disputes. Not every species of fae gets along with every other species of fae, and their fights can turn *very* ugly. I’m not kidding. A few years back, the entire clinic almost got torn apart during a brawl between a Mau and a Siren, and if you’ve never been caught in the middle of an all out war between a mermaid who can hypnotize people via direct eye contact, and a cat who can create illusions, let me just say that you should consider yourself lucky. So yeah. This rule is number one for a reason.

&#x200B;

***2: Members of the staff are not permitted to enter patient rooms without a guard present.***

This one is mostly just a precaution. Most of our patients are in need of actual medical care. But we’ve had some bad actors before so it’s better safe than sorry. While we’re here to help the fae, we also need to look after our own.

&#x200B;

**3: If a patient appears to grow aggressive or is exhibiting abnormal behavior, leave immediately and call security. Do not attempt to talk to patient down yourself.**

&#x200B;

This one should just be common sense - but as many have said before, common sense isn’t all that common. If a werewolf is getting angry, then it’s probably best not to be in the room with it anymore. Unless you’re not particularly attached to your limbs and innards that is, because pretty soon, you won’t be.

&#x200B;

***4: Staff are to follow all posted safety precautions in every individual ward.***

&#x200B;

Again another self explanatory rule. We keep our patients seperated into different sections of the clinic based on body type, physical requirements and social needs.  0-1 is for patients like Werewolves and Karah, who can pass for human pretty easily and who have similar if not identical anatomy to humans. 0-2 is for hemovores like Vampires and Sirens, who may need some specialty treatment for certain ailments or injuries. 0-3 is for unique body types like Arachne and Gorgons, who require specialty doctors to deal with them. 0-4 is for the Mau, because it’s really just best that we keep them separated from everyone else. And lastly, 0-5 is for quarantine cases.

&#x200B;

I suppose I should take some time to mention that 0-5 does have a slight caveat in its rules. In the event of a serious outbreak, its rules would supersede all other rules across the clinic. This set of rules mostly just goes over what kind of situations would necessitate a lockdown and what kind of situations where the entire clinic, or even the entire hospital would need to be quarantined.

&#x200B;

It’s scary sounding stuff, but thankfully 0-5 doesn’t get a lot of use. We have had a few cases involving infectious diseases that we’ve kept there, but nothing we weren’t equipped to handle before so I’ve never had a reason to worry about it.

&#x200B;

***5: Staff are not to discuss what goes on in the Specialty Clinic outside of the Specialty Clinic without written authorization from the Administrator.***

&#x200B;

Again, this is sort of a self explanatory rule.

&#x200B;

A lot of people don’t actually know that Fae exist and there’s a *very* good reason for that. Historically, people haven’t exactly been huge fans of people who drink blood to survive, turn into snarling dog monsters, have live snakes for hair or are literally just giant reclusive spiders. They’re a dying breed in a world that’s moved past them. A lot of the people who *do* know that they exist have dedicated their lives to hunting them down and wiping them out. Hell, I’m sure you’ve probably heard plenty of stories from those people, either celebrating their triumphs over the creatures of the night, or lamenting their defeat at their hands.

&#x200B;

So for their safety - we don’t usually discuss our work. If we recognize one of our patients from outside of the hospital, we are *not* to ever discuss their treatment with them. The rule dictates complete radio silence, and it does get enforced.

&#x200B;

Now, I’m technically breaking that rule by even sharing any of this. *But* I’ve got written authorization from the Administrator and this is an approved channel, so I get a pass this time on account of some extenuating circumstances.

&#x200B;

This job is complicated. It can be dangerous sometimes, but so long as you follow the rules, everything is usually fine. At the end of the day, it *is* rewarding and I am proud of the work that I do here! But the rules can’t protect us from everything.

&#x200B;

I know that firsthand now.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Patient Zero came in on a Friday.

&#x200B;

His name was Arthur Locke, although most people just called him Artie. We’d seen him a number of different times before. He was something of a regular at the Specialty Clinic.

&#x200B;

There’s no real way to say this nicely, so I’m just going to spit it out. Artie was a *mess.* He was a werewolf, although he’d been banned from a lot of the local community spaces where most werewolves hung out, mostly on account of his drinking. Usually when he came to the clinic, it was either because he’d gotten himself hurt either in a fight or while wandering the street so zonked out of his mind that he had no idea where he was, or because one of his buddies had brought him in because he’d OD’d again.

&#x200B;

In case it wasn’t obvious - werewolves and drugs usually don’t mix well and Artie wasn’t much of an exception. He was a little more mellow than most drugged up werewolves I’ve seen (which really shouldn’t be something I’ve seen a lot of, but unfortunately it is), but that wasn’t saying much. I genuinely don’t know how he’d made it this far without seriously hurting anybody except for himself, but I’d always worried that it was just a matter of time. The way he was living, I knew that eventually either the local Pack was going to put him down, or the Imperium was going to send someone to do it for them.

&#x200B;

When Artie shuffled in to the emergency room, the triage nurses knew to page me.

&#x200B;

Most of the hospital staff doesn’t really know what we do down here. Only certain members of the staff are given access to the parts of the basement that we work out of. But they know to call someone like me anytime someone shows them a purple card. As far as they know, they’re *specialty patients*. People with unique conditions that need a special kind of care.

&#x200B;

Hey, technically it’s not a lie!

&#x200B;

Anyways, when I got paged and saw Artie sitting in the emergency room, I knew that it was going to be a long night.

&#x200B;

He looked even more haggard than usual, with his long, unwashed shaggy hair plastered to his face with sweat. His beard was unkempt and part of it seemed to be falling out in places, but he still greeted me with a mindless, gap toothed smile when he saw me.

&#x200B;

“Hey… Jamie how’s it going?” He rasped. “Long time no see!”

“Yup, a whole two months. How are you doing, Artie?”

“Crappy…” Came his reply, “Been feeling off… few days now. Thought I could shake it but this is real bad. Got my guts feeling all tangled.”

“Yeah? Well, why don’t we get you into the clinic and we’ll take a look at you, okay?” I asked.

&#x200B;

Artie nodded, and stood up from his chair. His legs seemed a little wobbly but he was still able to stand for the most part. I waited patiently for him to move, and watched as he shuffled forward, putting one trembling leg in front of the other.

&#x200B;

He was moving slower than normal. At first, I’d wondered if maybe he was just high again, but I’d seen him high plenty of times before. This felt different. I offered him a hand to support him as I led him out into the hall and over to one of the elevators that went to the basement.

&#x200B;

He only barely made it inside before he started puking.

&#x200B;

He doubled over, letting out a wet heaving noise before retching violently. I stayed at his side, supporting him so that he wouldn’t fall over as a torrent of stinking red bile rushed past his lips and splattered all over the floor.

&#x200B;

Working in this field… you get desensitized to stuff like that really quickly. But the stink of what came out of him was worse than anything else I’d ever smelled before. The stench was undermined by the rancid smell of human waste. The strain of what had just happened had been bad enough to make Artie ‘*lose control*’ as it were. The whole thing was almost enough to make *me* sick.

&#x200B;

Artie seemed to fall limp in my arms after he’d vomited. I think he might have even passed out for a moment. I held him upright to keep him from falling over, until the door opened into one of the pale fluorescent lobby of the Specialty Clinic.

&#x200B;

“Alright… just a little further,” I assured him as I walked him out of the elevator. I hit a button inside to ensure it stayed put. Someone was going to need to clean it out before it went back into service.

&#x200B;

*“Y’can fix me… right…?”* Artie asked as I led him toward our triage area. Thankfully, Samara behind the desk could see the state that he was in and was already calling for a cleanup. She waved me past her into the small hallway to her left that led to 0-1.

&#x200B;

I brought Artie over to one of the empty exam rooms and helped him to the bed. He groaned as he flopped down onto it, immediately rolling into a little ball as he whimpered in pain.

“Hurts… hurts… hurts…”

&#x200B;

I quietly closed the door, and sanitized my hands before reaching for a pair of gloves.

“Alright Artie… let’s take a look at you.”

&#x200B;

I approached him slowly, before deciding that it was better not to touch him.

“Artie, can you talk?” I asked.

“Y-yeah…”

“Alright. Triage is going to get you a doctor, but before they show up, let’s try and go through your symptoms, okay? Are you having pain in your stomach right now?”

&#x200B;

“Y-yeah…”

“Okay, when did that start?”

“Two… n…no… three… three days. I didn’t do nothing! I was… I was drinking but none of that other stuff! Was trying… trying to quit…”

“How long have you been clean for?”

“Four weeks.”

&#x200B;

Four weeks… that was actually kinda impressive for him. It also told me that whatever this was, probably wasn’t related to his drug use. I couldn’t safely rule it out, but this seemed like something more recent.

&#x200B;

“Alright… tell me about the pain. On a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you-”

“Ten!” He seethed. “Feels like… m’guts are… coming undone.”

“Like a cramping sensation?” I asked.

“No… s-sometimes but not… this is worse. Pain gets so bad that I black out sometimes. Wake up in other places. I don’t think I turned but… I don’t know…”

&#x200B;

I could see tears in his eyes, and felt my heart sink a little. Artie might’ve been a mess, but I didn’t want to see him suffer like this.

“J-just help me… please, please just help me.” He sobbed.

“Let me try and get you something for that pain,” I said quietly, “I’ll be right back, okay?”

I quietly left the room to go and grab some ibuprofen and a cup of cold water. I doubted it would do much, but odds are that it would help.

&#x200B;

I brought it back to him, and set it gently in his hand.

“Try this,” I said. “It’ll help.”

&#x200B;

He barely even hesitated before dry swallowing the pills, although he didn’t turn his nose up at the water either.

“Can I get you a warm blanket too?” I offered.

“Y-yeah…”

“Alright, Let me just take your vitals and then I’ll go get that. Then when I come back, I’ll take some blood, and we’ll get the doctor in here.”

&#x200B;

He nodded and forced himself to sit up as I brought over the vitals sign monitor in the corner of the room. I took his blood pressure and checked his temperature. His blood pressure came back at 160 over 110. Way over the normal range, even for a werewolf. Their vitals were usually consistent with an average human. His temperature was also running high, as was his heart rate.

&#x200B;

I let him rest and got him that blanket I’d promised, along with a hospital gown so he could change out of those soiled clothes after making a note of the results on his chart.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan arrived about an hour after I drew Artie’s blood. I was waiting for her by the door when she got there.

&#x200B;

“The usual customer, Currie?” She asked, sounding a little jaded although that wasn’t really unusual for her. Dr. Meehan had dealt with Artie before, just like I had, but I always thought that her bedside manner needed work, although the same could probably be said for a lot of doctors.

“Doesn’t seem like it,” I replied. “Says he’s been clean for four weeks now. But the pain only started a few days ago.”

“And you believed him?” Dr. Meehan asked. “He’s lied to us before, you know.”

&#x200B;

“Maybe. But we’ve been dealing with this guy for years. I’ve never seen the drugs do this to him,” I said.

“Withdrawal maybe, assuming he’s telling the truth?” She suggested.

“Four weeks after quitting?”

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan huffed thoughtfully. She took the clipboard from me and scanned through it, her eyes narrowing a little. “Did we get his blood results back yet?” She asked, not bothering to look back up at me.

“Not yet. Although when he vomited in the elevator, I noticed that there was blood in it.”

Dr. Meehan gave a half nod, before thinking for a moment.

&#x200B;

“Have we given him anything so far?”

“Ibuprofen. It hasn’t done much.”

“Alright. Can you make sure there’s a room available for him when I’m done? We’ll keep him overnight for observation and see if we can’t help with the pain. My gut says withdrawal but-”

&#x200B;

The sound of Artie retching in the exam room caused us both to go silent. Dr. Meehan moved toward the door, throwing it open just in time to see Artie clinging to the bed, fresh red vomit spilling out of his mouth and onto the floor.

&#x200B;

He sobbed in pain and covered his face with his hands.

*“No more…”* He rasped, *“Please no more…”*

Dr. Meehan was on top of him immediately, trying to keep Artie from falling off the bed.

“Just relax…” She tried to say, but Artie swatted her away.

“NO! I can’t… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t… it *hurrrrrts*… Please dear God, it hurts…”

&#x200B;

I could see tears streaming down his cheeks. His breathing was more ragged than it had been before. His body twitched and jerked violently from the pain as agonized sobs poured out of him.

“Let’s just get you laid down…” Dr. Meehan said, before looking over at me. “Currie! Get me a sedative!”

&#x200B;

I took off to get something from the cabinet down the hall, along with a syringe. I could still hear Artie screaming, begging for the pain to stop. His voice trailed off into a mournful, broken howl.

I felt my stomach drop a little bit.

&#x200B;

*“No, no, NO, NO, NO, NO!”*

&#x200B;

I turned to see Dr. Meehan backing out of the exam room. She looked down the hall to see Samara watching us. “Code White!” She shouted and Samara ran back to her desk. I hurried over to Dr. Meehan’s side and looked into the exam room, just in time to watch as Artie writhed in pain on the floor. I could see his body changing. Warping into something else. His limbs elongated. His face shifted into a more lupine form. His screams turned into animalistic howls as his hands curled into claws and coarse black fur grew out of his skin.

&#x200B;

He snarled and whined, baring his teeth and growling at nothing in particular as if he was getting ready to fight something off.

&#x200B;

Looking back… I think he only changed because instinct commanded him to. I think that part of him knew what was about to happen, and changing was the only thing he could think to do to try and fight it off.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, it wasn’t going to save him.

&#x200B;

His stomach was bulging outward. Artie retched again, violently vomiting up more blood, and this time I could see something in it. Red, writhing shapes that twisted on the ground. His body seemed to give out beneath him. He collapsed for a moment, still alternating between whimpering and growling. His belly seemed to twist and bulge in an unnatural way, and I watched Artie press his claws against it, as if realizing that the thing he wanted to fight against was going to come from inside of him.

&#x200B;

For a moment, I saw a moment of panic in his eyes. Not animalistic rage or fear. But real human panic. He retched again, his eyes settling on me and Dr. Meehan as he quietly begged us to save him.

&#x200B;

But there was nothing we could do.

&#x200B;

His belly sagged outward and he screamed in pain as small red worms began to poke through his skin. Just like the worms that had been in his vomit.

&#x200B;

He clawed at them in a panic, tearing gashes in his own flesh. I could hear his horrified sobs as he tried to fight off the thing that was killing him from the inside. Tried to fight his way out of this. But all he could do was tear himself to pieces.

&#x200B;

His belly sagged open. His entrails spilled out onto the floor, with countless writhing worms squirming amongst them.

&#x200B;

Artie had a moment to stare at the damage he’d done to himself before collapsing backward, crushing the exam table beneath his weight. His eyes were still wide and terrified. He tried to change back, as if that could somehow undo the damage to his body but it was already too late for him.

&#x200B;

His limbs contorted, before suddenly stopping. His eyes rolled back into his head. His chest rose and fell violently as he sucked in his final panicked breath before suddenly. Silence.

&#x200B;

Artie was gone.

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan and I stared in silent horror at the mess in front of us, as four security officers came down the hall. Dr. Meehan was the first to notice them, and held up a hand.

&#x200B;

“STOP!” She warned, “Keep your distance… we have a Code Lime. I need a biohazard response team prepped and ready, immediately.”

&#x200B;

Code Lime? I’d never heard that one before. But I knew what *biohazard* meant.

“U-understood, Doctor…” One of the security guards said.

&#x200B;

Dr. Meehan looked over at me next.

“Currie… don’t move an inch. Who have you been in contact with since Arthur came in? Have you touched anyone else?”

“J-just him.” I stammered, “I got him water and a blanket, that’s it!”

“Alright. Those worms… did you see any others before right now?”

“No! I swear I didn’t!”

&#x200B;

She gave an uneasy nod.

“Alright… as of right now, you and I are going to need to be escorted to 0-5. We’re going to be undertaking a 48 hour quarantine until we’re sure there’s no chance that either of us are infected. Understood?”

&#x200B;

A 48 hour quarantine?

&#x200B;

I felt my own guts churn a little bit, but gave a quiet, understanding nod.

“Y-yeah… understood.”

The next thirty minutes passed in something of a blur.

&#x200B;

Two members of security were sent to collect us, both of them dressed in silver biohazard suits. The halls were cleared as we were led down to 0-5. Dr. Meehan and I were both brought to separate quarantine rooms.

&#x200B;

I at least still had my cell phone, and the guard who’d brought me there said that they’d bring anything I needed for my comfort. I already had my phone, so that was enough for the time being but I told them I’d let them know if I needed anything else.

&#x200B;

My head was still reeling.

&#x200B;

In the 6 years that I’ve worked in the Clinic, I’d never once seen anything that required me to quarantine like this before.

&#x200B;

I’d never seen a person die like Artie had before.

&#x200B;

I’ve seen patients die, don’t get me wrong. Sometimes, there are just people that you can’t save. But that? Crying, puking, *splitting open?*

&#x200B;

I’d never seen *that* before! I know that disbelief probably sounds rich from me, considering the kind of work that I do. But I didn’t think something like that was even *possible* outside of a sci fi movie! At least I could take some small solace in the fact that Dr. Meehan seemed to know what this was and what to do about it… and I figured that I could find a way to ask her while we spent the next 48 hours waiting to see if we were going to die or not. And while I was looking on the bright side, at least it was just a 48 hour quarantine. Maybe I was just trying to find the silver lining in a bad situation, but I figured that realistically this would all be over soon one way or the other!

&#x200B;

It wasn’t even an hour into my quarantine that I heard the announcement over the intercom.

&#x200B;

*Code Lime. 0-4. I repeat, Code Lime, 0-4.*

&#x200B;

The moment I heard that, my heart started to sink again. I didn’t need to see what happened or even hear about it to know what it meant.

&#x200B;

Whatever this was… it wasn’t just Artie who’d come in with it. There was another Code Lime less than an hour later. And another about 45 minutes after that.

&#x200B;

Each one hammered in the cold, dawning truth that whatever this was…it wasn’t just going to be over in 48 hours.
