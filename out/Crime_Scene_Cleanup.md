Location One: The Apartment on Cherry Lane

I've been in crime scene clean up for ten years. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills, and after a while, you get used to the smell. And no one bugs you.

People think it's the blood or the gore that's the hardest part, but they're wrong. It's the stories. Every stain tells one if you know how to look, and I've seen things I can't unsee.

But the Cherry Lane job? That's when I realized my job wasn't just about bleach and scrubbing. It was about something darker.

It was just past midnight when the call came. The dispatcher said it was a "standard cleanup" in an old apartment on Cherry Lane. Standard, my ass.

I arrived to find the place cordoned off with yellow tape, the kind that says "Do Not Cross" but never really means it. The cops were long gone. That's the thing about my job -by the time I show up, the people are either dead or in jail. Either way, show's over.

The apartment was a fourth-floor walk-up. The air was thick, sour, and wrong, like meat left out too long. I pushed the door open, and the first thing I noticed was the silence. Not just the kind that comes with an empty apartment, but a heavy, pressing quiet that made my ears ring.

The scene itself was... messy. Blood spatter on the walls, a pool soaking into the worn carpet, and something that looked like claw marks raked across the ceiling. The victim? A single mother, late twenties, found in pieces- literally. No forced entry, no weapon, no suspect. The cops chalked it up to a "dog attack," but even they didn't sound convinced.

I set up my gear, trying to focus. Gloves on, mask up, spray bottle ready. I was halfway through scrubbing the blood from the wall when I felt it.

A presence.

You know that feeling when someone's standing behind you, just close enough to brush your skin, but when you turn, there's no one there? It was like that, but worse. The air grew colder, and my breath came out in clouds.

Then, I saw it.

At first, it was just a shadow in the corner of the room. A trick of the light, I told myself. But as I kept scrubbing, the shadow moved. It stretched and twisted, pooling like ink until it took shape-a tall, gaunt figure with hollow eyes that seemed to suck the light out of the room.

My instincts screamed to run, but my legs wouldn't listen. The thing tilted its head, studying me like I was the stain that needed cleaning. Then, it spoke, but not with words. Its voice slithered into my mind like oil:

"She called for help. No one came."

I couldn't breathe. My heart pounded so loud I thought it might burst. I wanted to scream, but my throat locked up. Instead, I grabbed the first thing within reach-a can of industrial-strength cleaner- and sprayed it full force at the thing. Nearly emptied the can. 

Who knew P&G cleaners cleared out monsters? 

I have since learned not to use the whole can. It comes out of my pay if I waste cleaner like that. 

Besides, you really only need one good blast.

The shadow exploded into a swarm of black, writhing tendrils, screeching as they dissolved into the air. The silence returned, but this time, it was different. Lighter.

I finished the job in record time, not bothering to be thorough. I just wanted out. As I packed up my gear, I noticed something I hadn't seen before: a child's drawing pinned to the fridge. A stick-figure family under a smiling sun, but the mother's face was scribbled out in frantic black strokes.

I left without looking back.

That was the first, but not the last clean up job like that. I have learned "standard cleanup" means "Break out the good stuff and fill the steam cleaner with holy water." Dispatch liked their little jokes.

I had two more perfectly normal murder clean up calls after, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something followed me home.

When I saw a child's drawing with MY face blurred with ink scribbled I called dispatcher. I ended up having to text because something was wrong with my phone. I could hear dispatch but they couldn't hear me. (Called out for help but no one came... because no one could hear her? I couldn't help but wonder) Got a pretty good chewing out for waiting so long. Clean outs get messier the longer you wait the bored dispatcher informed me.

The cleaning crew had it's own cleaners. We'll, shit when were they going to tell ME?

So, I got a few days in a hotel on the company's expense report, and when I got home the air smelled of ozone and... was that cigarette smoke? Those assholes.

The standard cleanup up jobs aren't about cleaning up after the dead. It's about keeping them from coming back.

And some stains don't wash out.

But those are stories for other days.
