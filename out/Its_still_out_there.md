I've recently come home from being in the navy, living with my mom and my step-dad until I can get off my feet properly.  When I first saw, whatever the fuck this thing is, it was late November.  Thanksgiving had come and passed and that night I was cleaning some of the dishes we had.  I heard a loud thud outside the house in our back yard (we had a Â¼ of an acre, and on our street it was the biggest yard until our neighbor bought the house next to them and demolished it) I stopped what I was doing and glanced outside, it was only sunset so I could still see the yard clearly, but nothing was out there.  I turned back to my dishes and a few minutes later I heard my mom walk in, followed by her horrific screech.  When I turned my step-dad and a few other family members had seen what had happened.  I followed my step-dads' and uncles' gazes to the backyard, even now I don't really know how to describe it.  It had a deer skull as a head, Glowing red eyes, and the body all contorted.  My uncle ushered everyone back into the living room and he grabbed a 12 Guage from the gun cabinet in the living room, my step-dad got his barreta M9 from his bedside table, I grabbed the AR we had in the gun cabinet, and my other uncle and cousin grabbed hunting rifles (Murica) and we ran outside.  The thing still stood there, dragging something along with it.

Upon closer inspection, it was one of the neighborhood kids from down the street, mangled and bloodied.  My uncle shot first, piercing the thing in the leg while the rest of us had started to fire at it. The thing ran, and a few minutes later the police, firetrucks, and an ambulance showed up (small town, when something happens here Emergency responders always show up quickly.  The police put the five of us in cuffs and we sat out front of my house.  Everyone on the block was outside wondering what was going on as the poor kid was put into the ambulance, declared dead on the scene.  We were taken in that night, and questioned on what happened.  We gave them our story, but they didn't believe us.  That was until one of our neighbors (God bless her soul) had barged in and showed them a video she had taken.  We were held for a little longer (just till daybreak) and we were let go.  The next day was somber and quiet.  The family of the kid weren't home, the whole street stopped by our house asking what had happened, my step-dad yelling at them to go away before we returned to our peace, as much as we could get.

It went quiet after two weeks, the cause of death was best attack.  Bullshit. We know what we was, and others.  The next time I saw this thing was when me and a buddy were traveling around town, looking for something to do.  We had sat at the local park where the woods bordered the edge and a few houses and buildings across the street.  We were joking around and coming up with ideas we could do, until we heard a low growl.  We turned to the forest and saw two red eyes, staring at us.  My buddy looked at me and I just stared at it.  I glanced at my friend and we were thing exactly the same thing.  We ran, the car only a few feet from us and we hurled ourselves in the car and got the fuck out of there.  We didn't speak until we pulled closer into town, where my buddy asked "What the fuck was that?" And I honestly couldn't give him an answer.

Over the span of 3 weeks more people had dissappeared, pets dead and livestock slaughtered.  The town was in a fit, demanding to know what was happening.  I'll keep everyone updated on what else happens here, but as far as I'm aware: the mayor knows, the police know, and there are rumors of FBI getting involved (which I don't believe, cause it came from the town coot).  Whatever that thing was, it's still out there, and if multiple bullets don't do anything against it, I'm not sure what will.
