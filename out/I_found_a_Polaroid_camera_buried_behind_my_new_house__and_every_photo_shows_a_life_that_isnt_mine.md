I found a Polaroid camera buried in the woods behind my new house — and every photo I take shows something that isn’t there

I moved out here to get away. Not from anything dramatic — just noise, people, all the mess of life. I bought a small fixer-upper in rural Maine, with creaky floorboards and a backyard that bleeds into a dense, old forest. It was perfect. Or I thought it was.

Last week, while clearing out some brush near the edge of the woods, my shovel hit something hard. At first I thought it was a rock, but it had corners. Sharp, precise corners. I dug around it and pulled out a rusted metal box, sealed shut with what looked like a leather strap long rotted to threads. Inside was a Polaroid camera — old, but in surprisingly good shape. There was also a single undeveloped photo, still blank, and a pack of film cartridges tucked beside it.

Weird, sure, but kind of cool. I brought it inside, cleaned it up, loaded a fresh cartridge. I took a photo of my kitchen as a test.

When the image developed, it showed the kitchen, yeah — but not my kitchen. The layout was the same, but it was pristine. Renovated. The counters were granite, not the beat-up laminate I had. The wallpaper was gone. And there was someone standing at the sink. A woman. Head turned slightly, hair tied back. I live alone.

I tried to brush it off — maybe it was a prank, a preloaded shot, I don’t know. But the film developed fresh. And I was too curious not to try again.

I took another photo, this time of my living room. When it developed, the furniture was different. Nicer. Cleaner. A man sat in my armchair, reading a book. The light was wrong — soft and yellow, like it was evening, even though I’d taken the photo in broad daylight.

Each picture showed a different version of my home. Better, warmer, lived-in. And always with people I’ve never seen before. A couple eating dinner. A little boy asleep on the couch with a dog curled at his feet. A teenage girl staring directly at the camera with a blank expression.

I started taking photos of the woods outside. One showed an old swing set where there’s now just rotted stumps. Another showed what looked like a small cabin, just beyond the treeline. I walked out there, tried to find it — nothing. Just trees and silence.

Then last night, I took one more picture before bed — my bedroom, lights off, flash on.

The photo developed slowly. When it cleared, I saw myself, asleep in bed. But I wasn’t alone. Something stood in the corner. Tall. Thin. Barely visible in the shadows. Watching.

I haven’t taken another photo since. But the blank one — the very first, undeveloped photo I found in the box — it’s not blank anymore.

It shows me, standing in the woods, holding the camera. And something is behind me. 

The last photo changed again this morning. Same woods, same camera in my hands — but this time, I’m looking over my shoulder. And whatever’s behind me is closer.
