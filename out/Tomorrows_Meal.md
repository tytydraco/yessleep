I had always been a survivor. The city streets had hardened me into a shell of a man, haunted by a shadow of doubt and misery. If I hadn’t found Mary’s Shelter, I wondered if I would become a nameless statistic on a crime report. Mary’s was always more than just a place to sleep; it was a place that promised a second chance for me.

Mary’s was in an old building in a quiet corner of LA, its worn exterior starkly contrasting the warmth inside. The walls, lined with bright floral wallpaper, sat observantly to the countless stories of struggle and redemption that passed by them. The smell of Mary’s famous cooking greeted anyone who walked through its doors, a comforting embrace that seemed to be filled with dreams of a new life. The large print under the sign, “Everybody leaves Mary’s with a purpose.” was a beacon of hope to the lost.

Mary, the owner, was a woman who seemed to personify love and acceptance. Her raw charisma drew those to her, even when they didn’t believe they needed help. She ran the shelter with a maternal warmth. But I never noticed how sharp her eyes were, observing every newcomer with compassion and quiet scrutiny.

I know I was lucky. With Mary’s encouragement, I found talent for mechanics, secured a small apartment, and slowly rebuilt my life. It wasn’t easy; the scars of homelessness ran deep in me. But Mary’s Shelter had been the catalyst for my transformation. I often wondered how many others had left the shelter with similar stories of recovery. I think about the friends I made and the family who supported me when no one else would. I prayed they had found the purpose I had.

One night, I passed Mary’s Shelter on my way home from work and noticed something unusual. The lights in the kitchen were brighter than usual, and the smell of cooking seemed to emanate with a nostalgic, intoxicating quality. It smelled like the first food I ever had at the shelter. Suddenly, I was burdened with the memories of what she did for me, and decided to visit Mary one final time, to thank the woman who saved my life.

When I entered, I was met with a strange silence. The usual chatter and clinking of dishes were absent. The regular loud sounds of the community were reduced to the silence of the grave. As I made my way to the kitchen, the source of the aroma, I found Mary there, stirring a large pot on the stove. She looked up at me, her once stonelike expression cracking at my arrival.

“Alphonso,” she said with a tinge of shock covered by her suddenly warm tone, “I didn’t expect you tonight.”

“Just thought I’d stop by,” I replied, oblivious to her transformation from her usual bubbly self to a more reserved personality. “It smells amazing. I remember that meal from way back when!”

Mary’s eyes hardened momentarily, but her smile didn’t waiver. “You can never go wrong with the classics.”

A wave of uneasiness crashed into me. The kitchen, usually bustling with activity, was eerily quiet. I glanced at the pot on the stove, its contents obscured by steam.

“Is everything okay?” I asked.

Mary’s smile shrunk into a thin line across her face. “You’ve been doing well, Alphonso. I’m glad to see that. But this” she said, gesturing to the empty cavernous space around her, “is not what you think it is.”

My curiosity grew as Mary looked up at the pot to me.

“You see,” Mary continued, “not everyone who passes through here finds their purpose. Some people struggle and can’t seem to move forward, no matter how hard I try to help. We give them every chance to find a stable life, but when they choose to be lazy and ungrateful and waste the second chance I have offered them… well, it’s my responsibility to ensure they don’t become a burden to society.”

A cold shiver ran down my spine. I looked at the pot again, the steam hiding the grim revelation that lay simmering before me.

My stomach began to ache as if it knew the horrors that once sat inside it.

“What are you saying, Mary?”

Mary’s gaze was steady, but her true face was revealed as her smile grew. “The meals I cook for those who can’t find their way are special. It’s more than just food—it’s a final act of… resolution for those who couldn’t find their way. It gives them peace. And it feeds those that come after them.”

Vomit ran to the back of my throat. The realization dawned on me: the comfort of the shelter, the warm meals— a façade masking something far darker. The special meal Mary spoke of was not just a comforting gesture but an end to those who failed to overcome their struggles.

Mary’s smile grew as she shrugged. “I know it’s hard to understand. But sometimes, when one is so lost, the best thing we can do is offer a way to help others find their purpose.”

I took a step back, the room spinning. I never saw the undercurrent of darkness that ran under the happy exterior of the shelter. The place that had saved me was also a place of finality for those who couldn’t escape their shadows.

“I think I should go,” I said, my voice choked back by my sins as they burned away at my insides.

Mary nodded in agreement, her smile growing into a large toothy grin. “Remember Alphonso, everybody leaves Mary’s with a purpose, whether they want to or not.”

I left the shelter, the weight of the revelation heavy on my shoulders. I walked into a nearby alley, just as my stoic facade broke. The souls trapped in my stomach crawled out my mouth, in a horrific symphony of vomit and tears. The puddle before me resembled friends, those who supported me in my darkest days, reduced to sustenance by the devil wearing the mask of a saint. A knot formed in my stomach, like it was trying to pull itself out of me. I could not force my vocal cords to make the scream I felt tied in the back of my throat, but my mind was filled with the voices of the damned. With nothing left in me, I shakily stood up and made my way out of the alley.

 I stumbled away from the place that was my lifeline, burdened by the knowledge that the loss of others facilitated my life. The city lights glowed softly in the distance, but for me, no light would ever make way with the darkness that would follow me for the rest of my life. As I walked, the light in Mary’s began to fade, until reaching total darkness. 

Tomorrow’s meal was prepared.
