   “How strange was that last night, right?” said my roommate.  
It is not uncommon to hear that Brazilians go to study at universities in nearby countries, such as Bolivia or Paraguay. And my situation is no different. I'm from São Paulo, but because of my studies, I moved to Buenos Aires. There I shared a room with a guy from Curitiba (capital of one of the southern states, Parana), let's call him Gabriel.  
At that time we lived in an apartment in Villa Urquiza, a neighborhood a little far from the city center. It was generally calm there during the week, and it was a very peaceful neighborhood. This, of course, on days when there weren't any soccer matches involving Boca or River, the two big teams here. When this happened, the bars in the area were quite busy until later. Which is no surprise, since they call it “The City of Fury” or “The City that Never Sleeps”. As the apartment was small, we had to share the only bedroom in the apartment. On the left side of the door, there was a switch that was behind the old wardrobe, which looked more like a closet without doors, and on the opposite side, a window. My bed was next to the wardrobe, and my friend's was against the window wall.  
On one particular day, we went through an... awkward situation, to say the least. My colleague woke up in the middle of the night, scared. I know this, because I heard his bed creak and something falling on the ground. As he got up very quickly, the noise woke me up too. I admit that at first I was a bit angry with all that situation and asked him what was happening. Despite the partially closed curtains, the streetlight on the corner of the street produced enough light for us to see some silhouettes of furniture. When I looked at him sitting on the bed, I saw that he was frozen, with his eyes wide open, staring at the closet. At that moment, I thought he was sleepwalking or something, since he wasn't answering me. Until I asked again, “Dude, what happened?”Soon after that, he began to speak, with a trembling voice: “I saw something coming through the window and going across the ceiling into the closet". We used to sleep with the windows open and only used to close it when the noise outside was unbearable. You know, old building, no air conditioning and a suffocating  90 °F at night. “Something, what? An animal?” I said. He then proceeded to explain that he didn't see exactly what it was, but that it could be a spider. He tried to show me its size with his hands, which easily exceeded 15 in. I replied that I'm no biologist, but that kind of spider didn't exist, and said that he must have been dreaming; I don't know. But he defended himself by saying that he was a light sleeper and swore that he had seen it with his eyes open. “My phone is in the living room; turn on your flashlight so we can try to find it.” I told him.  
 Then he froze and said he didn't know where he was because his phone fell. I guess that's what woke me up.  
   
A giant spider? Are you kidding me? Our beds were at the other end of the room, so we had no choice but to get up and get close enough to see if it was actually an animal. I remember we grabbed whatever we had nearby, in my case, a slipper, and we walked very slowly towards where we thought the creature was. After a few knocks on what seemed to be something shrunken inside the closet, he reached for the switch and turned on the light and, to our surprise, it was nothing more than a Shirt that had fallen from the hanger onto the floor. We ended up just laughing it off and going back to sleep.  
The next day my roommate said “How strange was that last night, right?” and then, talking about what happened, we did what any normal person would do: we searched the internet. The result was that it could have just been an episode of night terrors; after all, we had been sleeping poorly for a few days, either due to fatigue from college or the noises that the upstairs neighbors made in the middle of the night, something not that uncommon in buildings. That was a bit spooky, but it didn't worry us that much. As it was mid-December, we were already in a celebratory mood for the end of the year and happy that we would see our families again in a few days. He already had his bags packed a few days before his trip back home. I thought that was unnecessary, as I used to only pack my things the night before, but that's none of my business. Our last week's nights were summed up as: and I'm not proud of this, but amidst the accumulated fatigue from college, drinking and playing video games, I almost always blacked out as soon as my head hit the pillow, while he continued in the living room watching movies on his laptop or whatever.  
Until, two nights before going back home, something similar happened again. This time, with me. I had already gone to bed and was alone in the room when I heard a very loud noise coming from outside the window. I can't say exactly what it was. You know when you wake up feeling dizzy and don't even remember where you are? As I was deciding whether to simply wrap the pillow around my head and try to sleep or get up to close the window, I got myself thinking that perhaps it was a car alarm on the street that went off. As I started to sit down, I saw Gabriel entering the room angry and walking to the window, saying, “Why all that noise that late?” I agreed with him as I put my slipper on to get up. He then closed the window without even worrying about what was happening and left the room. As soon as I got up, I was curious enough to go to the window and try to understand the situation - maybe it was a robbery or something. As I walked across the room, the sound stopped. So I pulled back the curtain, and when I sneaked over, trying to see what was causing the sound down there, I realized that there was no car. In fact, the street was completely deserted, and the streetlight on the corner was flickering. Then I felt a chill down my spine and didn't think twice before running to the living room to tell him that there was something going on outside. It all happened very quickly, probably in less than a minute.  
I was still light-headed; I don't know if it was from all the drinking the night before or from having my sleep suddenly interrupted and getting up too fast. Little by little, I came to my senses. I opened the door as quickly as I could and walked out of the room. Until, as I turned the corner of the hallway that led to the living room, I noticed the lights were off and the living room window was open. And then it hit me... How could I forget that? I thought. And I felt a deep terror: my friend left late in the afternoon the night before. I was home alone that night. At that moment, I was terrified and ran to where I left my phone on the living room table. I grabbed it as quickly as I could and turned on the flashlight while, out of some irrational instinct, I ran to close the living room window as well. I turned on all the lights and tried to text him, but got no response, I assumed he was probably still flying on his way back home. Within a few hours, he replied that he had arrived home and that he was also scared, because this probably meant that what he saw that night was also real. It was Monday. From that moment on, I didn't go back to sleep and spent the next day and night awake while waiting for my flight on Wednesday morning.  
     
I can't say exactly what happened. I doubt it was some hallucination due to sleep paralysis, since when I saw what looked like Gabriel enter the room, I was already sitting up in bed, moving myself. I tried not to think about it too much, as hard as it was, until I finally left. Whatever came through our window that night, it didn't go away. It was probably watching us all this time and waiting for the best moment to act. I also have no idea what caused that noise in the street that woke me up, but I suppose that it saved my life. Maybe that's why “it” was so furious with the noise coming through the bedroom’s window.  
Since then, we've moved from that apartment, and whenever any paranormal subject comes up among friends, we look at each other to confirm that we really remember what happened, and that's enough. We decided not to tell anyone, until now.
