I turned the key until the tumbler fell into place with an audible *thunk*, then pulled on the handle for good measure to make sure the doors were secure before turning and heading toward my lone car in the dimly lit parking lot. It had been a long day, and I was beyond ready to get back to my camper trailer and pass out.

I clambered into my old ’92 Caprice Classic, my heel finding the indent on the floorboard beneath the gas pedal easily in the dark, and cranked her up. The highway was dark and empty as I turned north and headed home, away from the bigger, busier towns and deeper into the sprawling rural area I called home. I turned on the rickety radio with one working speaker and let the tinny pop music fill the car as I drove. The inky darkness slid by, quiet and liquid, with only the occasional lamplight from an empty business parking lot or billboard pushing it back.

I had just come down off the overpass when I spotted the headlights in the distance.

On any other night, these headlights would have gone unnoticed. I tend to fall into a lull while driving home from my late-night retail shifts and not notice much of anything, but these headlights stood out. They were dim and almost orange in color, and something about them screamed *old* and *out of place* when my eyes drifted over their distant glow in my rearview mirror. With all the blinding LEDs on the road nowadays, these glowing orbs were almost dull in comparison.

As I pulled onto the shoulder to make my turn onto my road, I glanced into the rearview mirror once more and saw they were still behind me, but just as far away as when I had first noticed them.

*"Someone is out enjoying a quiet drive, or they’re plastered and not wanting to draw attention to themselves,"* I thought wryly as I turned into my driveway and headed into my camper.

I was so very wrong.

The next day ended like the one before, with me quietly locking up and bidding my part-timer good night as we headed out for the evening. She was long gone by the time I pulled out onto the highway and headed home. I was singing along quietly to the radio when I clocked those headlights again in my rearview mirror.

*"What the hell?"* I thought to myself. Living about 20 miles away from my workplace, the odds of seeing the same vehicle around the same time, at that time of night, twice in a row was… odd. Most of the people in my area didn’t stay out late on weekdays, and the highway was completely dead more often than not this late at night. So, I definitely found it strange that the same vehicle had potentially ended up behind me.

The headlights grew closer as I came down off the overpass, their round, old-fashioned glow more pronounced with the proximity.

*"Probably some retiree joyriding in their fancy old cruiser,"* I thought to myself with a smile. The thought of someone my Pawpaw’s age riding around in a car like the one they probably drove to their high school prom, with the wind ruffling their hair on the quiet, open stretch of highway, made my heart smile.

*"More power to them,"* I thought.

The next couple of days were more of the same. I locked up, headed toward home, and every time I came to the other side of the overpass, there were those headlights. They seemed to draw a little closer to me every night.

I started to have a lot of difficulty sleeping. My dreams were filled with the scent of hot asphalt, gravel shifting beneath twisting tires, and dull orange orbs that burned into the darkness. I was waking up soaked in sweat and feeling like I had run a marathon in my sleep. I had never craved rest so badly in my life, but I carried on. These bills weren’t going to pay themselves, after all, and I had one last shift tomorrow, then three blissful days off.

*"You’ve just got to make it through tomorrow,"* I told myself. *"You can do this."*

The headlights appeared again on my drive home, but tonight was different.

Tonight, when I got onto the shoulder to turn off onto my road, I saw the driver.

He was a slip of a man with a dark hat keeping his face in shadow. He raised his hand and tipped his hat. I caught a glimpse of his pale, thin-lipped smile as he passed. I felt a chill go down my spine as I watched his taillights disappear down the highway in my rearview mirror as I drove down my road.

I’m not sure what exactly made me so uneasy about this new development, but it felt like this man knew me. I couldn’t place him, but it felt like we had met before, like a faint whisper in the very back pew of an empty church sanctuary that I couldn’t quite place.

I tossed and turned all night and awoke feeling as if I had never gone to bed. I dragged myself into work and did my best to make it through twelve long, long hours of retail. By the time I locked up and made it to my car, I felt like I was sleepwalking.

I was so out of it, I was almost at my road before I noticed the headlights creeping up beside me.

My whole body jolted as I recognized the driver and his dark, brimmed hat. The bright LEDs coming toward us caught the sorrowful curve of his smile as the 18-wheeler plowed into my old Chevy.

My headlights yielded to screeching, twisted metal and hot, steaming asphalt as the man in the dark hat in the dark car continued down the highway, his taillights a whisper of red in the quiet night as he slipped away into the darkness.
