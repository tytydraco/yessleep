Current mood: hopeless, scared, broken, and lost.

They’re after me now. I saw what happened, and there’s no way they’ll let me live. I can’t reveal too much, not yet, or I definitely won’t survive to make a second post. 

But it all started a few nights ago, at a party I never should have gone to.

Fitting in has always been a joke. High school was a relentless barrage of whispers and laughter pointed my way. Even in college, trying to shed that "weirdo" label felt like an impossible climb. 

That night, my RA, bless her clueless heart, practically dragged me to an off-campus party. My internal monologue screamed for the quiet comfort of a book, but a part of me, the stupid, desperate part, hoped this could be different. Big mistake. Huge.

Someone – a red-faced, curly-haired kid who actually nodded at me, a first – offered me a cigarette. I’ve never smoked, but in the chaotic noise, wanting to disappear into the background, I just took it. I even flashed back to that one time at a hookah bar with my mom and aunt; it was cool, tasted like fruit. This wouldn’t be so bad, right? Wrong. So wrong.

It wasn’t tobacco. Not even close. The world tilted, the sounds warped into angry bees in a tin can, and the flashing lights stabbed at my eyes. That red-faced kid laughed, a cruel sound that echoed the years of being an outsider. “Idiot,” I think he mouthed. But it wasn’t weed. It was something else, something from China, he’d said, that “makes things interesting.” Interesting like the shadows stretching and breathing in the corners of the room? Interesting like the way everyone’s faces seemed to melt and shift?


I had to get out. Now. But the crowd was a suffocating mass. I stumbled backward, knocking into someone’s bed, a sickening splash of red punch blooming across a jersey – something her dead dad gave her, her enraged scream echoing in my ears. I didn’t wait for the punch. I ran. I ran until the music and the distorted faces were far behind, until the burning in my lungs felt like the only real thing.

Somehow, my feet led me to a 24-hour Vietnamese Pho place. The smell of broth and spices was a small comfort in the swirling terror. I walked in, tears streaming, the phantom taste of bile still in my throat. And then I saw her – the older faculty advisor, the goth/punk girl who gave me the campus tour last year. She smiled, a genuine, kind smile in the fluorescent light. 

“Hell yeah, chic,” she’d said, “No regerts, right?” I actually laughed, the knot in my chest loosening for a moment. We talked, we joked, and then… she kissed me. Or I kissed her. It didn’t matter. It was a moment of unexpected connection in a nightmarish blur. I didn’t want the lingering scent of vomit to be her lasting impression, so I headed to the bathroom to scrub my mouth with soap.

That’s when I heard it. The faint creak of the door opening down the hall, hushed voices, a choked plea. Then, six sharp pops that ripped through the quiet hum of the restaurant. Without thinking, I lunged for the bathroom door, my hand shaking as I twisted the cold metal handle, and opened it. 

I saw him. Vividly. The hollow, empty eyes. The blank, dead look on his face. The thin wisp of smoke curling from the barrel of the gun. And her… her head twisted at an impossible angle, eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. Dude… WTF.

He looked up, his gaze locking on mine. There was no recognition, just a chilling emptiness. He swung the gun towards me, and for a heart-stopping second, I felt the cold certainty of death. But instead of another deafening bang, there were six hollow clicks. He stared right through me, a raw, animalistic anger contorting his features. “Don’t move! Stay there!” he hissed, then turned and walked out the door.

I stood there, frozen, my breath caught in my throat. Then, a sliver of instinct broke through the terror. I stumbled out of the bathroom, my legs shaking so violently I could barely stand. Outside, he was by a beat-up red Toyota, a second taller red faced person (2 is too many in one night) with a bizarre mullet-afro – a “mafro,” in the passenger seat, others crammed in the back. My heart hammered against my ribs as I ran past the car, past the open windows. Then, a shrill, nasally voice screamed, “Get her!” followed by two more shouts. Shit.

I ran. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs ached, until I found a shadowed corner that felt, for a moment, safe. I was okay… almost. My hand went to my head. My hat. My favorite hat, the one with my mom’s old TV show logo and the cast autographs on the back… it was gone.

Now they know I saw them. They saw me. And they have my hat. They’ll find me. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring, if there even is a tomorrow. But if this is it, know this: even a weirdo, a loner who found solace online, can be terrified and heartbroken. And right now, that’s all I am. Lost.
