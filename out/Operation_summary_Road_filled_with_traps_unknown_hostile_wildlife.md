Hey there, I’m a veteran of the russo-ukraine war, here to document an event that I bore witness to. Using a burner account, aliases and a bit of obfuscation for the sake of not getting anybody still raring to die out there into trouble. 

My native tongue isn’t english, I learned with no teacher, so this post might be difficult to grasp– though I’ll try my best. I’m old enough to have had my father wake at 3 AM one night so that his friend of a friend of a friend can pass him a talking Pikachu plush before they ended up on shelves for cold hard cash. Supermarkets were new here. So was that cartoon. And his kids really wanted that toy.

I am native to a country bordering Ukraine, though my ethnicity earns me a lot of vitriol still. Growing up, heading into work, I was often a loner. Even if I got along with coworkers, friends, and we had fun– I kept drifting from one job, one place to another. It was that kind of aimlessness that lead me to daydream about serving in an armed conflict. Seemed a lot more fun and passionate than just working until the day I died. And it was. It was fun, it was harrowing, but I never woke up dreading what the day brought. 

I wanted my boys to live, and I was fine with dying. At least they would remember me as something more valuable. If I got lucky, maybe I’d even have a group of weirdos online sing my praises, as a mercenary legend. That was a long shot, still, it made me get up without bitching in the morning. 

My family was disappointed when I told them this was what I chose, but they didn’t stop me. That was the usual. And with that, I didn’t have much to come home to. Unlike my brother, I wasn’t married. By the time I jumped ass first into the meatgrinder, it’s been 6 years since I last tried with a relationship. I didn’t care anymore. 

Took a train right over the border, had a few medical checks beforehand, had my papers, tried to remember what I begun scraping together of ukrainian and russian on duolingo. That part of the country was stable still, by the time I arrived. Been planning this a few weeks, had a list of instructions from telegram channels on how I can make it to a recruitment station, get oriented to a camp after. 

Now I know most of you are adults who probably could read this without getting red in the face, but it’s still reddit– so for the sake of clarity, and because I don’t want terminally politics addicted morons to hijack this post so they can recite whatever their tribe fed them about the conflict, I won’t specify which side I was on. Ultimately, for my reason of being there? It wouldn’t have mattered either way. I arrived for adoration, action and a funeral. 

They taught me the basics of fighting, physically I was fine. But I made the mistake of telling them my job history. That then made me the camp’s McGuyver. For the first few months, I was doing electrical work, pulling cables, doing the bare basics to have a comm station running, small machine maintenance. And it felt alright. Felt just like any other new job I ever started. Over time I expressed want and need to be put in a more active role. I wanted to be out there on the field. 

CO had to be worn down before he even entertained the idea, I was massaging his brain, easing it in, reminding him. Though the straw that broke the camel’s back was us having a lot of guys injured beyond field duty. They had me train them to help out with maintenance. I ran my own crew for a hot minute, I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. 

The thing people often don’t talk about in war is the move. It’s a violent game, you push, you pull, you push, you pull. Break camp, make camp, break camp, make camp. And every so often, move everything besides the bare necessities over to another hopeful command post after a landgrab. My crew was good, I begun to love them as though family. Leaving one or two behind after every advancement.. Or worse yet, when their time came-- felt awful. 

It was never me. I rationalized that life is simply cruel like that. It was never gonna be me until I had been put through the ringer.

By the beginning of december, 2022, my CO had enough. Told me that if I oh so badly want, I can become a sapper. Naturally, I took my chances. Past experience in tinkering with mechanical things and repairing small machines became useful in disarming traps and explosives. 

As the current invasion wore on, we had a steadily increasing number of them to avoid thinning us out. Beyond being taught how to render these traps no longer a hazard, I’ve also been taught how to scout and the art of subterfuge. The man teaching me was older than religion and I doubt half the things he got from soviet manuals were worth a shit, but with my accent and skin complexion, I hardly needed a disguise. 

Sometimes I was “loaned” to a squad if they had to make their way through territory, or clear an area we’ve just gained. Sometimes I was sent out alone dressed as a smuggler, check for encampments, landmines in potholes, tripwires between telephone poles that’d detonate a street. If caught, I’d pretend I bumbled into whatever I was near, thankfully, never with my hands full of landmine fuses. 

Turned out I made a good actor, but it might’ve been the awful quality cigarettes I gave my would be captors hand over fist in a panic. I loved it. Not enough to dance near the fire too much, but I loved it. This was my element. 

I know the chairforce warriors are gritting their teeth so hard they break, ready to tear me limb from limb for my writings here. I’m willing to state it did happen, I’ll die by it. Just the same as we were trying to pitch to CO’s we should start welding sheds on top of tanks, and just the same as a couple squads figured the most effective form of CQC is throwing a set of landmines through an open window, or how trench warfare’s natural counter is just running in there and shooting the bad guys until you either emerge victorious, or you won’t have to worry about the alternative.

During the february of 2023, I was stationed in a mountain region. We’ve recently managed to get a hold in a mid-sized city… Only that the other half of it was still occupied by bad guys. Beyond them lied even more territory we’d have to gain before we could attempt a rescue on a battalion of our friends that have walked face first into a pincer attack. 

Communications indicate they were still hanging on, though running low on supplies and having a rough go of getting any off of the enemies that tried to flush them out. They’d have to try their best until the commanders came up with a plan. A few common grunts among the group dressed as ordinary people, blended into ordinary life, tried eavesdropping on anybody anywhere for information that people wouldn’t tell us otherwise. People would offer us scraps of info, rumors, for a fee. Though with ever forced drafts, stories of someone taking out their carnal and violent desires on the innocent regardless of side, we couldn’t really take people at their word. 

There was always a reason to lie. Unless you’re a gangster, ironically! The mafia connections across the country resumed working without major hitches. Hell, in some places, they were our only avenues for getting supplies in, and guys out without it getting bombed on the way. 

One hand always washed the other in some way. A true neutral third party nobody could afford to piss off. Whoever was king for the day would let them operate as they saw fit, let captured hoods go if asked. In turn the “dons” would listen (most of the time) if they were told to steer clear of certain areas and roadways for a while. 

As I’d find out later, the price of smuggled goods in my home country didn’t even change. The commanders managed to get in touch with a local slumlord, who proposed a trade. 

The city was laid out akin to a spiderweb, no street ever was to a pattern or conceived to be uniform, however, across it ran major roadways in 4 directions in a cross formation. North-west, North-east, South-west, South-east. We’ve effectively pushed the bad guys out along the North-western road, but a few units were still dug in. The “don” of the area was barred from using the NW road for months by the time we arrived, his smugglers had to do a big fat circle if they had to get to townships that branch off of the NW road. Never told why. 

The trade proposed he’d explicitly help us weed the bad guys out, and retake that road if his crew were allowed use of it again. In an absence of other leads, the deal was struck. Or at least I’m assuming, since the next few days were spent with scouting parts of the still occupied districts, then the second things seemed fine, a couple boys raced in to raid what the local gangsters told us had to be encampments. 

A few were right, a few were wrong. Command seemed happy. The “don” then told us he worked out a deal with the bad guys. They would allow 1 car through the NW road, if in turn the gangsters brought back supplies and reinforcements (this is under the belief that the sole smuggler would act as a pied piper).

We needed that road. One of us was supposed to drive up that road, note every trap, disarm what they can, reach the pincered boys, come back with them should the opportunity arise. At worst, report back using their radio about the treachery of the road so everyone else knows what to expect and plan accordingly. 

There were 6 sappers at the camp. 2 were injured after a mishap with a grenade trap. The rest of us were tired after chasing the gangster leads. The remaining 4 of us decided who’d be in the trojan horse over cards. As much as we enjoyed playing soldier, the plan sounded wrong. Why are they holding their ground so madly? Why is that one road completely off limits for even the citizens? I suck at blackjack, I’ve won the operation.

I’d have to sell it real thick to make it past the checkpoint. The “don” sent us a phone to call him on if anybody gave me trouble. Despite the “deal being worked out” this lifeline seemed peculiar. Shouldn’t all of them know? They also gave us a car, it’s a rusted through ‘99 Volkswagen Polo Sedan in “algae water green”. The interior body panels were all askew or crooked, stuffed to the brim with menthol cigarettes. 

I’ve dressed in my “scumbag” finest, a branded tracksuit, skinhead boots, polar jacket, winter hat and fingerless gloves. Under the tracksuit strapped to my chest was an old makarov police pistol we looted from an abandoned local police department. Same as any other “Rambo” mission I did before, I had no radio, papers or anything else that’d promote me to the rank of POW.

The NW motorway had climbed atop a mountain before cutting through it in parts. The bad guys were pretty much pushed to the foot of that mountain by the time I brazenly rolled up to the checkpoint. They signaled for me to turn around, I rolled down the window and barely turned down the volume on the radio, telling them that I am the don’s man they have to let through. 

This went about as well as you’d assume, with me slowly getting out of the car as 3 people were pointing guns at me. In a riveting 20 minute long conversation I’ve barely but managed to convince one of them to call the one number on the smuggler phone they took off of me. The call lasted just long enough for the winter wind to feel uncomfortable against my bare legs on account of them pulling my trackpants to my ankles so I couldn’t run. The call was on speakerphone so there was no need for them to deliberate much, they checked in with their commander to ask if the “don” was full of shit or not. 

Command told them to escort me through. To this day I have no idea why and how they miscommunicated so badly, but having worked in the government before and since, I am the least bit surprised. They apologised to me, I gave them a couple packs of cigarettes and cussed out the “don”, we bonded over our overlords failing us. 

The checkpoint was more of a barricade, really. The 4 of us combined managed to wrangle the barbed wire, then pull a big ass concrete block out of the way so that the car can roll on past… Then we pushed the big ass concrete block, and wrangled the barbed wire back in place too.

Since the bad guy CO told the unfortunate son of a bitch who called the “don” to escort me, I now had a passenger. He was young, native to the area, not mobilised or drafted, another willful soul. He helped me navigate up on the mountain that was ever thicker with snow the higher we climbed. 

Road wasn’t maintained to begin with, now it had undriven frozen solid snow, and sometimes just plain ice covering it all. Eduard, my newly appointed copilot, changed from soldier to buddy in a minute. We were bobbing our heads to the old house music mixes that ran off my “go-to driving music pendrive”, he called out directions, hazards and traps ahead of time. Couldn’t ask for more, besides the chance to not have to kill him. 

Again, I was here for selfish reasons. I couldn’t bring myself to hate anybody in this country from the heart, it wouldn’t be just. I still would talk mad shit and taunt enemies, given opportunity, but that’s the swing of fighting. I got cocky. Both sides, shit, half this continent is a corrupt post-commie shithole ran by politicians who only seek to benefit themselves or to aid a narcissistic fantasy lifestyle they invented. 

Why would a nation’s leader willfully keep riling up an insane ex-kgb agent who didn’t have any problem bombing his own countrymen so he could blame it on ethnic group as an election policy? Looking at him now… He too got cocky. Only I can admit when I slip in chickenshit.

And so we spent the night serpentining in the mountains, stopping at several places to make sure we weren’t gonna drive over a set of mines left in the pre-war potholes noone’ll ever fix. Luckily for us, the snow wasn’t thick enough to cover the road in uniform, the outline of the landmines still showed in the slump of the snow cover if you went slow. Eduard regularly got out to navigate me through these, reminding me of the days I used to be a van courier and forklift operator. 

A more rare type of trap was a clear fishing line affixed between 2 trees on opposite sides of the road. On these trees the wires ran to a set of detonators that would tell the 6 explosive charges set on both sides of the road to detonate. Some explosives would uproot trees to fall on the road, some would turn nearby boulders into shrapnel. If the retreat plan is to work, these will need to be disabled with haste. We stopped at all of them to figure out a way through with the car. 

They clearly didn’t intend this road to be used at all. The tripwires were set up to be at the “beginnings” of the so-called killzone compared to our direction. This means that the traps were meant to ensnare people going into the town we’ve just left, since if a convoy hit this in the opposite direction, only the lead car would be caught. Eduard didn’t feel like chancing a disarm, the traps have been here for months. I would’ve, if smugglers were known for disabling explosives. 

Some wire-traps we could “drive around” by slowly inching around the anchor tree and hoping we dont slide off the hillside or get stuck. Some traps we had to reverse from, find an alternative road through. Luckily there were a lot of lumber operations and hunting areas, so the dirt roads weren’t too bad, and they did spit us back onto the main road later. After reorienting ourselves using trail markers on the trees and kilometer stones on the road, we resumed each time.

Eduard and I swapped stories during the ordeal, hours passed, we got personable quick. The gun under my jacket and the sapper toolbelt chucked into the spare wheel both stirred nervously. Though that might’ve been several parts of the car clattering after it being torn apart and put together for work time and again. This 4 cylinder 1 liter beast of german engineering has clearly seen better days, luckily for us, the heating still worked, so there was something to counter the notable wind blowing through the panel gaps and rusted through holes on the bodywork.

Near the peak of the mountain range, my copilot asked if I’d be okay with pulling over at a campground. Campground as in, a tourist campground, which was now home to a smaller unit that patrolled the woods. Thought nothing of it, figured it’d aid in my cover, I agreed. Closer to the top we got, the more the wind picked up, the traps ceased being a while back, but would resume after the campground again, it begun snowing. The camp lights were on, through the slowly thickening fog, they illuminated a bright white glow. A dirt road leads off the main one, does a tight u-turn up a hillside, then a right to the grounds. The gates were left open and unguarded, noone came out to question our being there. 

This put Eduard on alert, he got friends here, figured he’d say hi. It’d be irresponsible to drink yourself into belligerence then sleep even if you couldn’t shit in these woods without an explosion potentially shaking the entire mountain. The site consists of a massive open area that’s tended to, intended for kids to run around and play. 3 sets of long old town houses that provide shelter, and a wooden structure somewhere in size between a shed and a barn. We didn’t feel like calling out, the air was thick and neither of us were freezing, despite fresh snow slowly drifting around us thick as tufts of plume feathers. We kept looking out, hoping a figure’d stumble into view, alive, if on the verge of alcohol poisoning. 

We checked the barn-shed, it wasn’t more than wood storage, bar a few basic tools hanging off of nails stuck in the wall. We walked over to the closest town house, door was locked, completely dark. Couldn’t see anything from the outside looking in. We circled around, he was leading, we got uneasy. The second townhouse was open, lights on, but quiet. We found nobody in there. The template used here split the house into a larger communal area you step into from the entrance, a kitchen to the left, a bathroom beside it, and 6 sets of smaller dormitory style rooms you can enter along the edges of the structure. 

Seems like some guys were trying to snack in the middle of the night, some bedding was thrown over hastily, as though they had to rush someplace. Their long distance radio sat quiet. A few laptops were on screensaver, we tried to use them, see if something happened, lockscreens asked for a password we didn’t have. The only gun we found was left disassembled on a table. He racked his rifle, I’ve grabbed a flashlight. And was planning on fetching the pistol when we heard something. Through the wind, through the wall. We heard weighty but careful slow steps in quick succession, as though a fox was made out of lead or some shit, my words fail me. The thumps came close, then turned around to leave. 

We looked at each other for a second before Eduard went for the door, with weary yet frustrated steps he circled the house, me lagging behind him. I got the light working only to see that from the side of the house where we heard those steps originate from, to the last town house, leads a trail through the snow, as though something had been dragged. 

This something had to be heavy, since it managed to dig up some of the leaves hidden under the thickening white cover. After a more careful look around, we saw a large collection of fresh footprints leading from the previous structures to the one we’ve yet to check. It’s door was open, left to swing in the wind.

The electricity was out, no hum from the fridge, no lights. A burning electrical smell was slowly trickling out the front door, but we noticed it still. Without my light, only the camp lights seeped in through the windows, dancing off the wrecked and chaotic furniture and people’s belongings. 

We couldn’t walk without kicking casings and discarded guns, from the kitchen going to the directly opposite side of the structure, the damage worsened. My lamp now reflected off droplets and sprays of blood on the floor, walls and ceiling. I grabbed my buddy by the shoulder yet he silently persisted, he signaled for me to stay with his hand as he slowly inched forward the mess surrounding one of those dorm rooms in particular. I followed a little bit behind, giving him light. It felt as though we’ve been sneaking up to that door for hours. It was ajar. He tried peeking in from the outside, to not much success, the room was longer than the angle we saw, with beds blocking visibility by the walls. 

From this room emanated the stench of death, we knew this. It was sadly fresh. When we both worked up the courage, we wordlessly stepped into the room, him leading again. He checked right, I checked left, nothing, I turn around only to flash my light across it. It was a beast the size of a small car chewing on something. It had it’s “elbows” on the ground, holding something in it’s paws and gnawing on it, with the rear legs still standing. Like a dog with a beloved toy. The beam of my light had seemingly ceased the thing’s ecstasy as it snapped it’s head right around to get a good look at us. I could take in more of this.. thing now. It looked like an ugly child between a borzoi and an agar the size of a renault clio. It’s body contorted to fit into the room, though even without that it looked disgusting. It either had no fur or was so short you could see every fiber of muscle and tissue flex, relax, and pulsate underneath it’s skin. If you’ve seen a hairless chimp before, it looks just the same. Though on the extremities of it’s legs, from it’s throat to it’s chest and underside of it’s torso hung tufts of curly hairs. The curious look on it’s horrid long snout turned to an aggressive snarl as we could take in that it’s “toy” was what remained of a poor soul stationed here, beyond the dog laid more bodies, piled up, tucked into the end of the room. 

Deafening us all, Ed fired off a barrage at the beast, which made it flinch at first before it twirled itself into a lounge and went for my guide. Me being closer to the door managed to step out as he was cast into oblivion by the jaws of hell. I opened my jacket to reach for the gun only for this fucking thing to start twirling him around like a new rag doll, he was beaten against the floor, walls and beds with a force I’ve never seen since. I am ashamed of it, but ran. I ran out the door, and made it straight for the car.

I struggled to fish the keys out of my pocket in a panic but I managed to jump in and give ignition. Just then out of the corner of my eye I saw the fucking thing covered in blood, holes, burning with malice dart for the car. I stomped on the gas only for the thing to crash into the rear left hand side door. It shattered the windscreen and pushed the rear of the car to skid. The beast tumbled over the other side before leaping into the woods. I thought about checking back on my wingman. 

I managed to get my bearings and gunned it out the camp gate, apologising to him in spirit. After the u turn back towards the main road, the fucking thing leapt in front of me onto the road. I slammed on the gas in an attempt to run it over. It buckled and slid over the car, yelping and scratching the shit out of it in the process. My regular front lights were gone, but the highbeams and fogs still lived. Without guidance and this thing behind me I didn’t stand a chance for the road ahead, I made a turn back towards the town. 

I was fighting with the seatbelt to let myself buckle in with one hand and trying not to crash with the other. The wind picked up, the fog rolled in, the snow fell in thicker clumps. If I wasn’t doing my best, this Trojan Horse would be my coffin instead.

During my youth, our family, though primarily my dad’s friends were big into racing. Had a local team and everything, from rally to circuits. I was raised in this kind of environment, became a car guy. Were it not for americans crashing global finances in ‘08, maybe I would’ve pursued this life too. I loved cars, I was taught to drive when I was tall enough to reach the pedals. I had everything under my hands from junkers to vans and trucks to– on rare occasions, the middle class luxury sports sedans of a friend or coworker. I am the balkan driver people make stereotypes about. The piece of shit that overtakes you on a “bombed out” (read pothole ridden) 2 lane road doing 130, or the one person flashing for you to move out of the fast lane cause I’m coming in with 200.

This isn’t a free luxury, however. I believe in karma, and more importantly, “road karma”. Where your driving style reflects in what circumstances you find yourself in, what you can get away with and where a symbolic line is drawn. For as much as I love being a speed demon, I also feel compelled to pull over when I see someone stranded and try to help, because this has happened to me, I every so often also let trucks turn left in a busy T intersection despite me having the right of way– you get what I mean. Tonight I would need every pedestrian I’ve let cross, every tire I helped change, every time I helped a guy park into a tight spot, or out of a blind spot. Because tonight, I would be racing death itself, it’s eyes reflecting off of my brake lights with a fury most things reserve for personal grief. 

My father nicknamed me “Schumacher”, my driving instructor called me “Raikönnen”, but I would need to invoke the spirit of “Richard Burns” to make it down the mountain. As I’d come to find out soon, I’d wind up with “Colin Mcrae” instead.

Open a corner wide, shift back a gear, then another gear, go in tight, accelerate on exit, correct for skidding, shift up a gear. Time and again, turn after turn. The car had thin wheels, which wasn’t the best, but with front wheel drive and it being front heavy, it was what I needed to get off this stupid fucking mountain. The beast and I had a tug of war in a sense, it got closer, I pulled away, it got closer again, I floored it. 

During our time up, I got a feel for the car, now I had to be one in the same. Consider it an extension of me, the steering wheel another joint in my body, the pedals my bare feet kicking up snow and dirt for a full body sprint. Through the speaker came the thundering beats I so carefully pre-selected months ago in a drunken haze, though some of those beats might’ve been my heart trying it’s best to leave my chest– so it cannot be devoured by the bloodhound set on the scent of a misfiring engine.
