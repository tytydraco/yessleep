I think I died, maybe. I don't know. I was simply walking back home from school, last day and whatnot, I will not lie to you I really wasn't paying much attention to my surroundings, a car came, or a truck, a van? I'm not sure, it's getting quite hazy, but it hit me, I think. No it definitely hit me, because I felt a large thud hitting my side, and a screeching of brakes, and the smell of gasoline and pipe exhaust overwhelmed my senses, then it all stopped. I'm not sure how long I was out, but it couldn't have been more than a few minutes. When I awoke, a woman was standing above me and my head was laying in the lap of another. 

"She's awake."  The woman above me said, her eyes were full of concern, her hair was blonde and she had pink bows wrapped around two delicate strands framing her face, she looked kind. That isn't quite important, anyway, I got up and looked around searching for my phone, not saying a word to either of the women. Not on purpose, I'm a polite girl, I greet and I acknowledge, but greeting and acknowledging two strangers was the least of my worries when I had just gotten hit by a car. I need you to stay with me, because this is the part where things get crazy. Whether you believe me or not it's up to you, but this is my last hope.

I finally found my phone and picked it up, the screen is cracked, but it's nothing unfixable, I flipped it around to check the back, and there it is, in the clear phonecase lies a picture of a woman I have never seen before, lyrics of a song I'd never heard. Not my phone, can't be. 

"Um, excuse me, I think we switched phones, by accident"  My voice came out scratchy and hoarse. 
The two women are just staring at me, they look at each other for a split second, then back at me.

"N-no, um honey, are you okay? I called an ambulance, it should be here soon just rest, sit down, I'll bring you a water, are you hurt?" 

"I'm fine, but I need my phone, I need to call my mom." 

"Honey, you have your phone, it's in your hand." 

"What's your name?" The other woman speaks, I take a good look at her, brunette, tall, thin, mean looking. Kind voice. 

"Just please, I- I need my phone, I don't need an ambulance I'm fine, I want to go home."

"Your phone is in your hand."

"This isn't my phone, our phones must have gotten switched in the chaos of the whole thing, I just... my phone please." 

A concerned look grazes the blonde woman's face, she tilts her head to the side.

"That is your phone. Open it, you'll see."

"Our phones are still in the car, no way they got switched, plus, neither of us are all that into Taylor Swift."

"Who?"

"Taylor Swift?" The brunette points to the picture in the back of the phone. 

"I think you have a concussion." The blonde says.

I say nothing. 

An hour passes, two, three. I'm in the hospital at this point, the phone clutched in my hand. I did try unlocking it. It unlocked with my fingerprint. I don't know how, because that is not my phone. 
A doctor walks into the room they put me in after what feels like forever. 

"Your parents are here."  He says. 

"OH! Thank God you're okay!" I hear a woman near shriek.

"Mom!" I bounce of the bed and into my mother's arms. 

"Oh my baby, what happened?" She says, as she strokes my hair.

I look up at her, wanting to tell her what happened, abiut the car and the phone and the mean looking brunette and the blonde with bows in her hair, but I am taken aback.

"When did you dye your hair?" I ask

"What?"

"Your hair, I know you said you were gonna but I thiught you were too scared."

"Honey, are you okay?"

"Mrs Mondrich, come with me please." The doctor says. He walks over to my freshly red-headed mother and leads her out of the room. 

What is happening.
‚Äê----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My room is not my room. There are posters on the walls of artists I've never heard of, and Polaroids of me with people I've never met, I don't know what is happening, there is a dog that is not mine, homework splayed around that I did not solve. This is a life that is not mine, it was the last day if school for God's sake how did I get here. 

This is my only hope to find out whats happening. There is nothing on the internet about my predicament, I have searched. My mother will not speak to me when I try to tell her about it, my father shuts me down whenever i talk to him and every corner of the room is taken up by faces I do not recognize. 

This sounds insane but I think I universe jumped.
Either that or I died and this is some twisted form of resurrection.
But if I did universe jump, what happened to this universe me? Did I kill her?

If anybody knows anything at all about this matter, I beg you, please help me.
