I’m writing this to prove I existed. To document my journey and the horrors I’ve witnessed. If someone reads this, maybe it’ll mean I was real. My name is \*\*\*\*\*\*.  I live at \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* in Unit 603. Or at least, I did. I don’t know anymore. Maybe I’m dead. Maybe not. I can’t tell how long I’ve been here. days, weeks, longer? Time’s twisted here. It doesn’t behave.

I don’t like to be noticed. I’m someone who can disappear for months without anyone wondering where I went. I have friends. Real ones. Ones who care. Ones who keep trying to drag me back out into the world. But I don’t like the world. I like my apartment. It's my bubble. It’s safe. It’s quiet. It doesn’t judge.

I close my curtains and pretend the people outside don't exist. I keep the lights off and the blinds sealed tight. My whole life is inside these walls: I sleep, eat, work online, play games by myself, and repeat. That routine became my cycle. In here, time didn’t move forward. It just looped repeatedly with days blurring together and dates meaning less and less as time went on. Loneliness hurts, but eventually, it becomes a comfort. At least when you’re alone, there are no expectations from anyone else.

But one day, my walls cracked.

My friends pushed harder than usual. Maybe they sensed something. Maybe they saw through the character I play when I rarely answer their texts. I must’ve let my defenses down for a moment, because I agreed. A week from now. Just a simple get-together. Just one night. Only a short trip out of isolation yet it felt like I was sentenced to death. I regretted it immediately.

That entire week dragged like the countdown to an execution. I overslept for days on end. Constant panic attacks. I kept procrastinating, kept telling myself I’d cancel or fake an illness. My imagination ran wild trying to formulate believable excuses. But they stayed there. None of them left my imagination.

Because I’m an agoraphobic, socially awkward shut-in, not an asshole. I stick to my word.

The day arrived before I knew it. My phone lit up with excited messages. My stomach churned from an illness in my brain alone. I stepped into the shower for the first time in what felt like forever. My greasy hair resisted the shampoo like it was protesting. I changed out of my loyal pajama pants and dressed like someone who actually belonged in public.

Every step toward the front door felt unnatural. Like gravity was defying me. I grabbed my phone, my keys, and stared at the doorknob like it might bite. When I finally opened it, the hallway beyond felt foreign. Overlit and too quiet. Almost nobody was out there, yet I felt exposed, as if their eyes pierced straight through me.

I avoided eye contact and made a slow, awkward shuffle to the elevator. Every part of me begged me to turn around, lock the door, and disappear. But I didn’t. I just pressed the call button.

The elevator opened like it had been waiting to swallow me whole. I stepped inside, still trembling. The panel stared back with its bland and metallic sheen. I hit the lobby button and the doors closed, sealing my fate.

I watched my reflection in the brushed steel walls. I looked like a ghost. My hands shook. My eyes were sunken. I felt like a fraud. A failure trying futilely to slip back into society.

My breathing grew shallow. The descent was slow. A little too slow, stretched like syrup.

Then everything changed.

A violent jolt shook the elevator. The lights flickered—rapidly strobing like lightning trapped in the ceiling. The shaking intensified, like the elevator was resisting gravity. I stumbled, grasped for the emergency button, but it wasn’t there. Or rather, it was translucent. Unreal. Like a desert mirage pretending to be solid.

Only one button remained. Glossy and unlabeled. It practically pulsed under the dim light. I didn’t want to touch it, but I had no other choice. So I pressed it.

In an instant, the shaking stopped. The lights snapped off, plunging me into suffocating darkness. Silence wrapped around me—thicker than air. I slumped to the floor.

Then, the lights came back—softer and stranger than before, with a subtle orange glow—and the elevator resumed. The familiar rumbling of the elevator had ceased entirely, leaving only the occasional gentle shake to remind me that we were still going down

I tried to collect myself. Rubbed my eyes. Leaned back. At some point, I must’ve passed out from exhaustion.

When I woke up, nothing had changed.

Still in the elevator. Still going down.

I patted my pockets to find that my phone was gone. As if the elevator didn’t want me to have it.

The panel had solidified now. No longer hazy or flickering. But still one button. Still labelless.

Wherever I was going, it wasn’t the lobby. It wasn’t even back to my apartment. It wasn’t anywhere I recognized.

The elevator was taking me somewhere else entirely.

The elevator slowed, then stopped. No ding. No announcement. Just a soft metallic creak, like something aching throughout the elevator itself. The doors parted.

Beyond them wasn’t the lobby. It was a wasteland.

The air glistened with a sickly green haze that bent the light radiating from below, warping the horizon like a wave. A scorched, smoky sky hung overhead, low and oppressive, painted in shades of nuclear dusk—deep amber rays bleeding into the atmosphere. The ground was fractured, veined with glowing fissures that pulsed rhythmically, like the earth itself had life.

I had to make a decision.

After what felt like an eternity, I stepped out, against every instinct I had. The elevator didn’t wait. It simply closed behind me and vanished. As if it had never been there at all.

The silence was deafening. Angry, even. No birds. No wind. No signs of life. But somehow, I felt watched—like the land itself had eyes, peering at me through the cracked soil.

My footsteps crunched over brittle fragments of what might’ve once been buildings. Metallic frames jutted from the ground, twisted beyond recognition. I passed what looked like a melted swing set half-buried in ash. A child’s toy sat nearby, half-disintegrated, staring at me with one hollow eye that made me look away.

I tried calling out, just to hear something besides the hum of my surroundings. My voice came out strange—muted, swallowed instantly, like this place didn’t want sound.

Then I heard it.

A groan. A massive, heavy exhale from something far off in the distance. Something alive. The sound rolled across the wasteland like thunder. I dropped to the ground and waited.

Far across the glowing ravine, a shadow moved. Appearing small in the distance until closer inspection.

It was big—no, enormous. Something feral and ancient. Its outline blurred, as if reality couldn’t decide what shape it should be. It had legs, maybe. Or arms. Or too many of both. I couldn’t tell if it was walking or dragging itself, but every time it moved, the ground beneath it recoiled, shaking my bones from the inside.

I wanted to crawl into the fetal position and disappear. But staying meant being found.

I scrambled behind a metal husk of what once was, my breath hitching. My throat felt scorched just from being in the air. I scanned for shelter or anything resembling safety.

That’s when I saw it.

In the distance was a metal structure. Simple, boxy, and familiar. Another elevator.

It stood out like a sore thumb, a pristine island in a sea of rot. But it was far. Too far. Despite only being a silhouette in the distance, I felt the shadow's gaze from a mile away.

I don’t know how long I waited. Time dragged on. But eventually, it turned. It moved in another direction—slow and moaning, like it had somewhere to be. Or maybe it just didn’t care anymore.

Either way, I ran.

Every step felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. The air tasted metallic. The land shifted beneath me, like it was trying to make me trip. But I reached the elevator.

It was just standing there. No walls. No enclosure. Just the doors and the panel.

It opened before I pressed anything. I stepped inside. No hesitation. The doors closed, and it began to move.

Nothing had changed. But everything felt different. The elevator no longer hummed.

I stayed standing at first—rigid and alert, like prey that hadn’t yet been spotted. The fluorescent light above blinked intermittently—long pauses, brief flickers. Its rhythm broken, like a metronome set to an irregular heartbeat. The tension stretched, rubbery and thin. I sat down.

The carpet was coarse. Cheap. Synthetic fibers pressed into my palms as I lowered myself. The air inside the elevator was thick—bordering on hostile—like the pressure in an airplane just before something goes wrong.

I gasped. Not from panic, but rather like I’d been holding my breath for years without noticing. Like oxygen had been rationed in this place, and now I was stealing it back. My chest rose. Fell. Rose. Fell. Nothing else moved.

I lost track of time again. It wasn’t hours or minutes. It was something different. It was as if time wasn’t even a concept in this place. I sat there in that suspended moment, breathing as if relearning how. The silence had shape now—filling the space around me, creeping across surfaces, folding around my body like weighted fabric.

**\*ding\***. Not loud. Not cheerful. Just inevitable.

The doors parted. And *he* entered. Slowly. As if gravity worked differently for him. Each step was surgically placed—heel, then toe—with no sound. A silhouette made not of flesh, but merely the suggestion of humanity.

His face was nearly blank. Wet clay, smoothed over where features should’ve formed. All but the eyes. Round and bulging. Fixed ahead like spotlights in a morning fog.

He didn’t acknowledge me. Not even with a twitch. He took his place near the doors and stood with the posture of someone used to being ignored. Limp arms. A tilt of the head to the ground, as if staring down would make him invisible to an outside perspective.

The doors closed, and we began our downward journey once again. The space shrank—not physically, but as if the tension I felt was increasing the density of the air around me.

The silence between us spread and crawled along the walls, settling in like a parasitic passenger, along for the ride. I didn’t dare shift. A sudden movement. A yawn. Even the sound of blinking felt like a scream.

My throat burned with restraint—lungs aching not from lack of air, but from the effort it took to remain invisible.

A scent crept in now—radiating off of the strange figure. Dust. Sweat. Old paper. Like a forgotten file cabinet forced open to reveal its contents decades later.

**\*ding\***. He moved. Not urgently. Not eagerly. Just enough to get him from point A to point B.

The doors opened to a hallway.

Muted colors. Carpets in sepia tones. Fluorescent strips set into the ceiling—sputtering in sequence like Morse code. As if even the lights were judging me in their own unique way. Doors lined each side. Metal. Identical. Almost closed—but not quite. Each one inviting, yet hostile.

He stepped out. The elevator didn’t wait to close its steel jaws once again. But I watched while I could.

Inside those barely ajar doorways came only noises at first. Not words. No language. Just reactions. Emotion sculpted into audio—a gasp at the wrong moment. A laugh that wasn’t meant for you. The shrill pitch of someone pretending not to notice you. A whisper meant to be overheard.

Then figures emerged, clothed in various attire—business outfits, party dresses, school uniforms. They drifted around him—orbiting, talking, living. But never seeing him. Not really.

He remained still in the center of their world—unmoving, unmoved. A placeholder for someone more acceptable. More social. More “normal.”

Their conversations passed through him like smoke. Their joy ignored his presence like he was background noise.

Just before the doors slid shut, he turned. Not fully. Just enough to make eye contact. Enough to show that he knew I was watching.

And then he was gone.

The elevator was mine again. But emptier. Somehow.

I stayed in the elevator. Not that I had a choice.

It didn’t move at first. It just sat in place, humming softly like a machine trying to remember its purpose. I felt the shift only in my knees. A slow downward drift. The lights above buzzed. Then dimmed. I was alone again. But the kind of alone that feels heavier.

Minutes passed. Maybe hours. Time remained blurred, folded, lost itself in the endless depths of the elevator shaft.

Then the doors opened once again. No announcement. No fanfare. No welcome. Just a cold ding.

The doors opened without ceremony. The room was dim. An array of hundreds of monitors, stacked like bricks in a mausoleum. Each beaming with life, and yet none acknowledged my arrival.

No message. No attempt to prevent me from entering. As if it knew I wasn’t capable of making any lasting impact on the world surrounding me.

I stepped in. The air tasted stale like the boarded-up section of an office. Vacant. Soft mechanical hums filled the silence like breath through walls.

A few screens displayed comfortingly mundane scenes:

* A parking lot at sunset. One flickering streetlight. A woman sat in her car, unmoving, as if waiting for an unseen signal.
* A diner booth with cracked vinyl seating. Someone scribbled in a journal. The waitress passed back and forth, never making eye contact.
* A library desk where a child tried—and failed—to whisper. No adults nearby. Just rows of books, and one spine on the shelf seemed to pulse.

I moved past them.

Others displayed environments all too familiar:

* The Clay Man’s room, seen from a higher angle. He stood exactly where I left him, surrounded by the same fancifully clothed echoes of socialization. This time, he was facing the camera, as if sensing me through the screen. The figures' motions stuttered and looped as he gazed at me through the monitor.
* The Wasteland, cloaked in the same radioactive lime fog. The sky opened inward, not upward, revealing columns of cities hung like chandeliers from the void. That same colossal figure dragged itself along the horizon, brushing its limbs against forgotten ruins buried in the fractured dirt.

And farther still, the monitors deepened into madness:

* A stairwell of spiraling flesh. Each step groaned—wet, living. At the bottom, a mouth whispered inaudible mutterings, as if spreading a secret I wasn't meant to hear.
* A lake, perfectly still, reflecting constellations not known to this world. Something below the water exhaled, and stars rose out one by one like bubbles.
* A parade of warped beings—shifting between dimensions—marched down an abandoned suburb, visually aging the environment as they continued.

I didn’t try to count the monitors. There were hundreds. Maybe more. Each showed a different scene. Incomprehensible environments dancing across countless screens.

Yet only one mattered.

Low and tucked behind a nest of tangled cables—barely visible—was the smallest monitor. Unworthy of the grandeur that the other screens were given.

It showed the elevator. Doors open. Empty. Flickering gently, like the eye of a beast pretending to sleep. Waiting for me to return. Or watching to see if I ever would.

At the center of the room sat a desk. Wooden and weathered. The kind that belonged in a forgotten office abandoned by time.

On the desk: a candle, half-melted. Piles of paperwork with symbols I couldn’t dream of understanding. And right in the middle— My phone.

Just as I remembered it. Same smudged screen. Same crack in the corner. I grabbed it before thinking. Of course I tried calling for help.

No calls connected. Every number I tried—family, friends, even emergency services—was met with the same thing. A gentle tone, and then nothing. Like the signal was reaching something else entirely.

Most software refused to open. Emails, texts, every browser I tried. All unresponsive with the same blinding white screen

Only a few sites and apps still respond. This is one of them.

I can’t explain why it works. I’ve stopped trying to.

All I know is that this is one of the only places still listening.

So I’m writing this— less out of hope, more out of necessity. To pin memories down before they dissolve. To remember. To be remembered.

If you’re reading this, maybe it means I haven’t disappeared entirely. Maybe I’ll return to the elevator. Maybe I won’t.

I’m no longer convinced it matters either way. But for now, this place has a witness. And that will have to be enough.
