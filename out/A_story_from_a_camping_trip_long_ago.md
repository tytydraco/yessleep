My name is Sam. Jason and I are on a hiking trip a few miles deep in the woods near Sam's parents' house. We have brought a cheap tent, two sleeping bags, 2 gallons of water, some dry food, hot dogs, a flashlight, and 1 large plastic lantern that my dad had gotten for me on my birthday.

We had been planning this trip for a few weeks and were very

excited to finally get started. “This is as good a spot as any”. I say to Jason. Jason looks at me with a relieved look on his face. I am sure he is happy to not be carrying bags any longer. Jason and I set up a nice camp.

We spent the first day wandering around in the woods near the campsite, exploring. Late in the day, around dusk, we find a dried-up creek bed, which naturally we follow until it opens up into a large clearing.

We walked toward the middle of the clearing, again following the creek bed. We get to what is the end of this old creek, a small bog near the middle of the clearing. I will say from the outside of the clearing, I had a faint unease in my belly.

Now, in the very center of this open space, that feeling has been amplified greatly. I feel a strong dis-ease while standing there. Jason is down in the creek bed looking for rocks or [Souvenirs](https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-souvenirs-doraville?adjust_creative=duckduckgo&utm_campaign=yelp_feed&utm_medium=feed_v2&utm_source=duckduckgo) something to that effect. I am at the top of a small slope leading to the bottom of the creek bed, scanning the surrounding area.

My eyes follow the tree line all the way around, unable to fight the feeling that we are being watched. By the time I had looked at the entire tree line and had seen nothing. But I cannot get this feeling in the pit of my stomach to leave me.



The whole first day went fine. The real story starts that first night. I wake up from my slumber with an urgent need to use the restroom. I look to my left, where I expected to see Jason that was the last place I had seen him after all. I look around the small tent as if I expected him to be hiding somewhere. My friend is nowhere to be found; it is very quiet except for the sound of crickets and the cicadas outside. But then I notice it's not bugs outside, they never sound quite this melodic, like a low hum. I can hear this hum almost inside my own head as I get closer to the ground; the sound gets louder and louder. By the time my ear is near the ground, it is almost deafening. I can hear it ringing around, almost like it is trying to escape the inside of my head. Then in an instant, nothing, nothing at all, complete silence. So quiet in fact, my ears begin to ring. I leave the tent looking for Jason.

The moment I poke my head out of the tent i realize something is terribly wrong. Jason is nowhere to be found, although I do see something. There is a pool of light around 100 feet away from the opening of the tent. So I leave the tent and begin to walk towards it. There I find Jason, he is standing staring into the darkness beyond, emptily like a man in shock after viewing some violent, horrific accident. I ask him what he is doing all the way out here, and he responds with nonsense, something about a man with too many teeth. I take his hand and guide him back to the tent.

That was the end of this strange experience. Please feel free to ask questions; maybe I will remember some more details.
