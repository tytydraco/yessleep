I haven’t been able to sleep much for the past week, haven’t told anyone in my life about this. I’ve only googled about it, a lot, but I didn’t find anyone who has been through this. Any advice would be appreciated.

Last week, as I went down the stairs to catch my usual subway home from work, I took the wrong one. Well, I thought I was just distracted, but now I know it was, in a way, on purpose. 

In the first couple of minutes, I felt stupid. Some twenty-minute delay to rest after a long day at work. But it didn’t take long for me to feel like I was going somewhere familiar. I started to remember the view out the window like an old picture you don’t remember taking. And when I arrived at a certain station, I knew to get out and which set of stairs to take.

Outside was the usual street, indistinguishable from any of the thousand others downtown. But I recognized some of the stores. I started on a path I didn’t know where it was gonna take me. Street signs, trash cans. I remembered that place. Even though I didn’t remember how, I knew where to go.

Approaching a small square, I saw a beautiful oak tree swaying in the light breeze. A white, wooden bench under its shadow painted a bucolic frame, defiant of the surrounding concrete. But something else caught my attention: An ice cream parlor. I remember that, clearly, if not disconnected in time.

Bells clanged as I opened the door, drowning me in a lost memory. I remembered the checkerboard-tiled floor, the colors of the yellowed sign behind the counter, the rusty fan squeaking every other turn. I must’ve stood there for a while, because I came to my senses when the attendant yelled, “Can I help you?”

I was too dazed to respond as I normally would, but I managed to “autopilot” myself closer to him. My eyes went straight to a certain flavor on the faded sign. He was going through his usual presentation of sizes and prices when I interrupted: “Chocolate Chip. Large!” He was taken aback a bit, but nodded and continued the process. 

There was a large sink behind him that I then. A faucet, dripping. I didn’t know then why that bothered me so much, but every drop seemed to sound so loud falling into metal. It brought me out of that dream state. I felt like I should jump over the counter and turn it tight. This was never a pet peeve of mine. Which bothered me more than the sink itself.  Thankfully, he handed me my order, and I went to sit far away from that.

I looked at that bowl, thinking about how long it had been since I had a treat like that. A little bite of that creamy texture, the crunchy chocolate chip bursting with flavor, and I remembered. I remembered what I remembered. 

Going there with my dad, ordering the same flavor every time. I remember him joking about that, saying I should try something else. I remember sitting there staring at my hero. Never thinking about that time of day, never minding the price of the ice cream.

Man, I enjoyed eating that! 

I was almost licking the bowl. I didn’t want to leave, but I could always go back some other day. Bring my own kid.

I wanted to squeeze more out of this little vacation. My face hurt from smiling. I sat under that oak. Watched the day hurry away for a bit. Another rare, pleasant breeze, and I was in heaven. I closed my eyes and heard the leaves clapping gently above me, then I looked up at them.

That… hit me like a sucker punch to the gut. I felt nauseous, weak. That image made me sink into the bench, to whole city spinning around me. That tree, spinning. 

I got up straight away and went home. I had to lie about being late. I wasn’t excited about my memories anymore. I told the wife that I had to finish some things at work, she didn’t question it. They had dinner already, I wasn’t hungry. One long shower and I was in bed, not sleeping, of course. 

The whole night I kept thinking about that damn tree. The leaves falling, spiraling towards the ground. Why did it hurt me? I couldn’t place it, like a… like an invisible itch! A rock I could not get out of my shoe.

The next day was spent watching the hands on the office clock run extra slow, as if mocking me. Work seemed meaningless, and coffee didn’t help, but I suffered through it and could run back to that cursed wooden bench. I ran down the subway's stairs, into that fateful train.

The details that had allured me before, were a blur now. The stores, street signs, trash cans. Fuck the chocolate chip ice cream! I went straight to that bench under the oak, sat and looked up. As much as it was bothering me all day, looking at it was unbearable. I looked around, considered leaving. But I had to figure it out. It was killing me.

So I studied it. Every scrap and speck. Every branch that led into a small branch and then a smaller one after that. Even now, if I could draw, I could show you the smallest details. Every scratch classified by how deep it was, by how old it looked. The faintest change in color, the position of the moss in relation to the sun that set in the background, as I watched the leaves falling onto me. The city sounds muffled. I must have looked insane to anyone passing by. But I figured it out! Only, I still can’t sleep.

I went home defeated and with a stiff neck. Had to come up with a much better lie to explain being late, almost four hours this time. She again didn’t care. A longer shower then the bed. Branches projected into the ceiling. I could hear the sway of the oak in the breeze, could feel the leaves touching my face as they fell, spinning like my thoughts, never-ending.

All because, maybe, they haven’t fixed the squeaking fan in twenty years. I find it pretty hard to believe that they never changed the flavors, never updated the prices, never fixed that damn dripping faucet. But there is no way that tree has remained the same all these years.

The same branches, same holes, and scratches. Same as when I was a kid?

I don’t know if this is a type of psychosis, some mental illness manifested late in life. Google, Reddit, Quora, nobody has ever talked about it. If there is a term that I can read about, look for an answer, please tell me. If you repost this anywhere, send me a dm, so I can read the comments.

My deadbeat dad never bought me ice cream.
