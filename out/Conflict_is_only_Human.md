I remember when it happened.
November 1963.
It was quick.
Lucky.


Just a bullet through the head. Guy ran up to me while I was in a bad part of town and put a gun to to my head and asked for my wallet. I suppose he thought I was going for a weapon, since after I reached into my jacket to grab it, everything flashed. Went in my left eye. Then it was all nothing. 


But it wasn’t the “nothing” I was expecting it though. Instead of a complete lack of existence and sensation, I was completely aware. But I couldn’t feel myself. My body. Whatever “I” was, was just floating in the void. Took me a second to remember where I had been before and where I was now, but afterwards I pieced together pretty quick that I had been shot and killed. 


But it was odd. I didn’t feel anything. Not sadness. Not anger. Nothing. It was like I didn’t care, but somehow even beyond it. And that feeling extended to the entire void, this great nothingness I found myself in. It was a lack of existence itself, and yet, I myself existed. So where exactly was I? 


I had a lot of time to think. About that question. About everything from my entire life down there in our burning world. And I’ve thought, for the first time, without the burden of emotion. It clouds our judgment more than we think it does. 


It’s all just so needless. All the violence. The pain and suffering that we’ve inflicted upon this sacred soil of ours and on each-other and on ourselves. 


We pass the starving on the grounds we walk and leave them to wither. We no longer outstretch our hands to one another. We are cold and cynical. And it’s all so needless. 


There simply doesn’t exist a reason why we cannot all in unison and in peace. But we are just so very simple. So very base. So very human. We are slaves to our bodies and base instincts. To all the desire and greed that permeates us down to the very bones of our species. It’s all so needless. 


Then I heard it. And felt it. Saw it. And knew it, all at once. And it was a terrible. It was a stark howl. It was cold and painful. It was pure evil and destruction. It was the unmaking.

its maw erupted from the darkness as a singularity of shifting teeth, made in forms impossible to describe, a whirling pit of something I can only describe as the opposite of light and creation. Screams and wails trumpeted from its being, a thousand souls being chewed and digested and devoured. Their pain erupted from it, and became my existence. And in its maw was something I never believed in. Something I spit on and dismissed, and treated like a parasite on the human psyche. Something I dreaded was real now. 


God. Creation. Light.
Devoured and swallowed, by this great unmaker. It took the light and love, and siphoned it into the abyss before filling the vacuum with hate. It replaced passion with indifference and lead our souls to dissolution. It took all that was and what could be and reduced it to waste. 


I know now in its presence, before I am devoured, that it was all real. The beauty of god and its unrequited love, a blanket and nest to and for all. We never got it quite right, in the end. Never really understood it or embraced it. But I know it was there. And it was within all of us. Within every human eye. But it is there no longer, replaced by this great devourer. 


It has grown within them, taking root deep in their soul. It rots them from within with the venom of indifference, before they unleash it upon others with callosity. 


It is the spit on the homeless. Its children are the starving in the street. It is our hate and violence, and its seeds are planted where we ripped life from the earth. It is the war and soot in the air that we breathe. It is the polluted skies and the oil in the sea. It is the pain and the suffering we have sown.


And soon, it will be what we reap.
