Hello. If you are seeing this, it means you got this writing. Let me tell you a few things before I get to the point. 

My name is Jameson. I live alone in San Antonio, Texas. I manage a couple of Popeyes in my local area and have family in another county. I have a house in a small area. I also have a gf that is working a Denny’s. My whole life is nothing too special. I’m just your average middle class working Joe. Everyday has been pretty much the same other than a day or even a week of something. But that was when something happened that I still can’t believe.

I woke up around April 6. I did my normal routine. It wasn’t till I got into my car and felt like something is different. There was a feeling in my head, but I can’t put my finger on it. I just chalked it up to just a strange feeling and continued with my day. I got to my desk and still felt like there was an odd feeling inside me. I try to ignore it. Everything is normal. My surroundings, my friends, colleagues, family, my girlfriend. There’s nothing wrong, but it’s like there is. 

I went through that whole day feeling like there was this little bit in my mind that was telling me something. It’s like there are small voices talking to me. Saying things that I can only hear. At this point, I think I’m starting to go crazy. A bunch of my colleagues have been checking up on me. One of our drive thru workers said I have been in my office groaning for the last two hours. Apparently, I was mopping to floor with a bucket and have been weirding out customers. I’m starting to thing that I am the one that’s wrong. I had to leave work early because of everything going on. 

I tried calling my dad, but it led straight to voicemail. I called my mom and she was able to pickup. My dad was at work and still couldn’t make it. I told her about my strange feeling and nothing else. She thinks I’m just really tired and that I need rest. I don’t even know if I can believe her; My own mother. It’s 4pm and I haven’t eaten in a while. I feel like my stomach is consuming in on itself. I’m also starting to see things. I don’t feel safe on the road. And yet, I was still driving. To make things worse, I realized that I was writing all of this while on a trip. I didn’t know if I was driving like a maniac. I had to pull over and set myself straight.

I parked at a dollar to first collect myself. I got out of my car and walked in. I didn’t look at anybody and felt they were all staring at me. It was one of the most uncomfortable feelings I had. Going to the bathrooms, I splashed some cold water on my face and to stare at the mirror. I looked the exact same. There was still a feeling that something was different. It was starting to get crazy. Even after all this, I just needed some rest. 

When I got home, I just sat in my room; Thinking. I needed some time to myself. My girlfriend has tried to call me, but I ignored her. I don’t even know why. I’ll try to write again. I just needed a break.
