The first sign something was wrong came with the power surge. My monitor flickered, my phone buzzed with static, and for a moment, my speakers emitted a faint, incoherent whisper. I thought it was a fluke until my old chat app—one I hadn’t used in months—lit up with a notification.

**“You like horror? Listen to this.”**

There was a link attached. It led to a barebones webpage with a single audio file titled **“The Scariest Podcast Ever.”** No author. No description. Just a play button.

The comments were unsettlingly enthusiastic. Every review was five stars.

*“You just have to experience it!”*

*“Scariest thing I’ve ever listened to!”*

*“No spoilers, but if you stop listening before the end… you’ll regret it.”*

I hesitated. This felt different. Not like a normal podcast, but something… else. My heart was already beating faster, my instincts screaming at me to ignore it. But curiosity won.

I hit play.

The voice wasn’t human. Not robotic, not synthetic, but *wrong.* It vibrated, like multiple tones layered imperfectly. It began with a simple premise—an unnamed creature hunting its next victim.

Then it mentioned my school.

Not just my town. Not just some random high school. *My* high school.

“The creature lifts its head, catching a scent… from a place where knowledge festers and youth stagnates.”

I swallowed hard. Then it got worse.

“The scent is strong, distinct. It will be easy to follow. From the Hollow Grounds Café where the boy lingers, to the laughter of his friends echoing in the night.”

My stomach twisted. I had stopped at Hollow Grounds, the old coffee shop where people sometimes just… disappeared. I had met up with my friends at the park, just like the podcast described.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was AI-generated based on local landmarks. But as the podcast continued, it mirrored my entire day with eerie precision.

“The boy doesn’t know he’s already been chosen. He walks home, the thing following, unseen. Watching.”

My hands were ice-cold. My room suddenly felt too quiet. I wanted to turn it off, but my fingers wouldn’t move. I needed to hear the end.

“The boy arrives at his house. He doesn’t check the locks.”

I hadn’t.

“The creature waits. It doesn’t need to rush. It is patient. It is inevitable.”

I heard something creak downstairs.

I froze. Every hair on my body stood on end. It could have been the house settling. Or my dad getting water. But my parents' room was on the other side of the house.

The podcast went on.

“The creature enters. The scent is stronger here. It takes its time. It likes the chase.”

I couldn’t breathe. My skin prickled as if something was standing just behind me.

“It moves upstairs. The steps creak beneath its weight.”

A step creaked outside my room.

I reached for my mouse, desperate to pause the audio, but I couldn’t. I didn’t want to know what would happen if I stopped before it finished.

“The boy feels it now. The air shifts. The pressure in the room changes.”

The air in my room thickened, like it was alive.

“It stands behind him.”

A warmth, humid and rancid, ghosted against the back of my neck.

And then—

**The power went out.**

I was plunged into darkness. My monitor, my lamp, even my phone—dead.

And for a split second, in the reflection of my black screen, I saw something.

A figure. Naked. Pale. Its skin stretched tight over bones that were too big, too jagged. Its mouth was open wider than humanly possible, lined with needle-like teeth. Its eyes—

**Pitch black.**

And the air around it… rippled. Like heat distortion. Like reality bending to accommodate something that shouldn’t exist.

I spun around, but there was nothing there. Just my empty room. My door was still closed.

Then, just as suddenly as it had gone, the power flickered back on. My computer rebooted. My phone buzzed to life.

The chat window was gone. The message erased. The link—deleted. I refreshed the page, searched for the podcast, scoured forums, archives, even the dark web. Nothing. It had vanished without a trace.

I’ve been searching for it ever since. Years have passed, and I still check late at night, hoping for another anonymous message. Hoping to find that link again.

Not because I want to listen to it.

Because I need to know how it ends.

And because sometimes, when my room is dark and quiet, I still feel that breath on my neck.

And I wonder if it ever left at all.
