I refuse to die without telling what I saw. I am reaching the end of my life, and the fear that kept me silent for sixty years is nothing compared to the fear of what comes next.

They will say these are the delusions of an old man. They always do. But if I was able to lie to my own family for decades, imagine what a powerful government can do to an entire population.

I barely understand how the internet works. My grandson showed me this place a few months ago. He said it was the best place to leave something behind. I hope he was right.

When I was selected to join **Project Young Homeland**, I couldn’t contain my excitement.

For a medical resident like me, being invited into something so secretive was beyond anything I could have imagined. It wasn’t open to the public. It wasn’t even acknowledged to exist. That secrecy made me feel important. It also kept me blind to the horror I had stepped into.

They told us we were helping our country fight communism. That we were protecting children from going down the wrong path.

There was no greater honor than that.

That was the lie they sold us.

The first days inside the facility were exactly what they promised: medical exams, growth tracking, psychological assessments, educational videos. Nothing outside my training.

But even then, two fields on the medical forms caught my attention.

They were filled out only by my superiors.

**“Compensation Applied: Yes / No.”**

**“Visible Physical Changes:”** followed by three empty lines.

At the time, I didn’t know what they meant.

I would soon learn.


The facility was completely isolated. Once you entered, you didn’t leave. Not even on weekends. The nondisclosure agreements we signed were worse than anything you’d see in a corporate job today. I’m almost certain one of the clauses authorized lethal force in case of information leaks. As if that were possible.

Despite all that, I felt lucky to be there. I came from a military family. Opportunities like that didn’t go to just anyone.

One of the children told me I had a funny face. That I looked like a rabbit.

The name stuck.

Everyone started calling me **Dr. Rabbit**.

The… children… liked me.

I was younger than most of the doctors and officers, and the isolation made them wary of adults. They weren’t supposed to get attached to any of us, but they did anyway. Especially the ones who had been there before I arrived.

Their files were perfect. No illnesses. No fractures. Healthy teeth. Most hadn’t even started losing their baby teeth yet.

We were told never to ask about their families.

All documents said the same thing.

**Orphans.**

Their routine was simple.

They woke up at 7 a.m.

Breakfast was milk and bread with butter. They were punished if they didn’t finish the milk.

They had lessons until noon.

Lunch, followed by another glass of milk. Again, punishment if it wasn’t finished.

In the afternoon, they were allowed to play until 5 p.m.

Then came dinner.

After that, they were taken to the observation rooms.

The nurses would run the nightly protocols and put them to sleep. I often noticed them checking something under the children’s pillows before leaving.

That’s when our work began.

We weren’t allowed to see inside the rooms. We only had access to heart rate monitors and breathing sensors, courtesy of our American partners. Video recordings were reviewed later.

The first week went by peacefully. The children were calm. Responsive. Obedient.

We were told everything was for the greater good.

Things changed after the **March of the Family with God for Liberty**.

We all knew the president Goulart was about to be overthrown. The project had started before the coup, so it felt normal to us.

But there was nothing Godly about what we really did. Even less freedom.

During the week of March 13, a new group of children arrived.

They were sedated. Terrified. They weren’t allowed to speak their names. Soldiers beat them when they tried.

We were instructed to mix a new compound into their morning milk and observe if it would cause any visible side effects.

To this day, I don’t know what that compound was.

The children said the milk tasted like chalk.

The following week, **Subject 147-A** was brought into my office.

He complained of a toothache.

He tried to smile at me, but avoided fully opening his mouth. He said I really did look like a rabbit — just not one with red eyes, like in the song.

His baby teeth should have fallen out months earlier.

None of them were loose.

I wasn’t allowed to examine him further. They only wanted to know if he was otherwise healthy.

His vitals were normal.

That night, they placed him in an observation room separated from the others and ordered me to stay on duty.

By then, this wasn’t the first time something felt wrong. 
He wasn't the first to complain of a toothache. 

None of us were comfortable anymore. By that time we were less doctors and more like... morticians. But we weren’t allowed to leave.

Subject 147-A was when I realized something was truly broken. 

The test files started coming back with notes written by my superiors:

**“Update protocol.”**

**“Object archived.”**

**“Compensation not applied.”**

Almost all of those files belonged to children who entered the isolated observation room and were never seen again.

We were told they had been returned to their families.

They were all orphans. Weren't they?

I signed the papers anyway. Any other person would do the same.

I didn’t sleep that night.

I remember 147-A waking up.

That wasn’t supposed to happen.

The room was sealed and dark, but I could hear him. His voice, shaking, calling for his mother.

His heart rate spiked. His breathing turned erratic.

A heavy hand on my shoulder stopped me from standing up.

What could I have done anyway?

The next morning, his file was on my desk.

**“Compensation not applied. Compound effective. The Phenomenon does not respond to containment. Medical integrity compromised.”**

The field **“Visible Physical Changes”** was filled in.

I can’t bring myself to repeat most of it.

But one line still haunts me:

**“Subject presents dual dental arches.”**

That was the last time I saw 147-A.

My father managed to get me out that afternoon. 

He used connections high enough to make my 'resignation' look like a family emergency. I never asked what it cost him. I was too afraid to know.

I was lucky. Very lucky. 

Or maybe the ones who stayed were luckier, because I still remember what we did there.

The toothaches never stopped. The "Visible Physical Changes" either.

After that, no one watched the recordings anymore. 

None of us left that place whole.


I spent the rest of my life trying to forget. I never could. 

Now children are disappearing at an alarming rate.

And I know why.

Soon, what we created will be turned into public health protocols by the right people. I Hope. 

When that happens, follow them.

Please.

Don’t let what happened to 147-A happen again.

I kept all my teeth.

Every single one.

They’re under my pillow now.

The taste of iron hasn’t left my mouth.

When this is posted, I’m going to lie down and sleep.

Whatever is waiting for me is worse than death.

But if I’m right, it will accept my offer.

And maybe…

Maybe that will be enough.
