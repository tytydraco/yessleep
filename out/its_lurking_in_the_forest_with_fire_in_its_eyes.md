Hello all, I'm new to reddit and I'm here to tell you about my strange discovery in the forest of Oregon. For a bit of backstory, my name is Curt, and I'm an amature Cryptozoology, and when I say armature, I mean amature. I believe in Bigfoot and Nessy and UFOs, and I know something here or there about mythology. 

Any how, I have lived in Oregon all 40 years of my life and I had always been curious about the massive forests all around where I lived, what could be hiding in those trees just out of sight? Such curiosity is how I found myself searching local folklore on anything strange or unheard of in the forests nearby. One day in the fall of 2006, I found myself in a small diner outside of Junction city, a small farming town north of where I lived. I was sitting there drinking my coffee when overheard two older gentlemen speaking to each other at the other end of the bar table. 

“ I'm telling you, Bill, I saw it, It was looking right at me.”
“ Ah, horse shit Frank, you were probably drunk knowing you.”

“I swear Bill, gods Honest truth. It was just like the stories your dad used to tell us.” 

“ My Pa was as much of a drunk as you are, probably more.”

As they continued to speak to each other, I moved down the bar towards them. 
“excuse me, gentlemen? I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. Tell me, what did you see?” 

The skinnier of the two, Bill, rolled his eyes at me, but Frank continued. 

“ I saw the Lurker.” He said excited that someone cared to hear his story. 

“the lurker?” I asked, unsure of what he meant. He leaned in close and said. 

“The Lurker is a local mystery. It lives in the woods, watching us.” He paused and took a swig of his Beer. 

“I was out stalking one of the local trails, looking for a white tail. While I was trudging through the brush, I heard a loud cracking sound in the trees ahead. I stopped to see what it could be, thinking it was a Cougar or a Deer. When I saw one of the trees move as if it turned away from me in that brief moment, I saw two gleaming Orange eyes like two burning coals.” 

Bill let out a scoff.
“More likely you saw someone's tail lights.”

“ I know the difference between tail lights and eyes, Bill!” Frank exclaimed as he shot his head in Bill's direction. 

“How do you know that it's the Lurker?” I interjected. 

“ folks have been seeing it for years, and it's always described the same way.” Frank continued.

“What did you do next?” 

“Nothing, I blinked, and just like that, it was gone again as if it had never been there. Then I made my way back to my pick-up and headed back home.” 

I sipped from my coffee as contemplating Frank's tale, the exhilaration of finding something unknown crept up my spine. 

“Where was this?” I asked, trying to downplay my excitement. 

Frank looked at me with a twinge of suspicion in his eyes. 

“Why do you want to know?”

“morbid curiosity, I'm doing research for a blog on folklore.” 

Frank scratched the back of his head uncomfortably. 

“Alright, it was on a game trail out by Fern Ridge. It's not far from a hiking trail that's visited often.”

I thanked him, paid for my coffee, then left. 
I was actually familiar with the hiking trail Frank had told me about, so I headed straight there. I arrived at Fern Ridge later that afternoon and made my way down the hiking trail towards the woods. Soon enough, I found the game trail that Frank had told me about. As I made my way through the underbrush, I felt the tingle of my hairs standing up in excitement. The foliage got thicker and thicker as I continued. Suddenly, I lost my footing and fell into the bushes. When I looked down towards my feet, I saw a huge hole that I had slipped into. 

I got up, brushed myself off, and inspected  the hole. It was about 3 feet wide and about 1 foot deep, I was lucky I hadn't really hurt myself. Then I noticed that there was a bunch of loose soil both in and around the hole. it looked like the hole left by a tree being uprooted, only there was no fallen tree nearby. I felt a shiver up my spine, I couldn't tell you why. I shook my head, thinking an animal had just been digging in the dirt. But as I looked up the trail, I saw another hole about 15 feet away, and another, and another. If I didn't know any better, I would've said they were footprints. I felt a lump forming in my throat and the sudden urge to follow the trail growing in the back of my head.

Against my better judgment, I began to follow the trail of “foot prints.” The excitement of finding something truly undiscovered too enticing to ignore. As I continued, a little voice in my head began to implore me not to follow, but that voice was little more than a whisper.
Soon, I found the trail leading to a small clearing. The prints stopped exactly where I was standing. I looked around and saw no trace of the prints I looked about and saw that the Sun was starting to set, I must have really lost track of time. 

I turned around, making one last pass at the clearing, when a cacophony of screeches shot up from the trees just to my left. I nearly jumped out of my skin as a murder of crows came bursting from the trees circling above the clearing. They flew into the air like a black cloud, slowly spiraling towards the ground. Feeling a sudden pull, drawing me towards where they were landing. As I made my way closer, my skin began to crawl as I felt the putrid stench of rot in the air. My heart stopped as I looked down, Laying in the middle of the clearing was a body, torn to pieces, entrails strewn around like streamers. 

I turned away, retching up what little I had in my stomach. I pulled myself back up, my eye locked with the dead puffy eye in the shattered remnants of its skull. One of the larger crows landed there cocking its head at me curiously. It squawked and pecked at the wet puffy eye, pulling it free with a wer sucking sound. It quickly gobbled up the eye, I was too shocked and filled with too much disbelief to move. The crow tilted its head at me again, and for a brief moment, I could have sworn I saw a glint of orange in the birds eye. 
It screeched and flew away. As it did, all of my senses slowly returned to me. I felt my arms start to move frantically to my phone. I scrambled to dial, 9-1-1, a woman's voice immediately answered.

“ 911 help line, please state the nature of your emergency.”
“hi….I….oh god…I'd like to report a dead body!”

“OK sir please tell me your name.”

I felt my tongue glued to the roof of my mouth as I tried to answer.

“ My name is C-Curt, Curt Walsh! I'm out off a game trail just off Fern ridge…I was going for a walk, and I found….oh God I can't even tell…ma’am it's bad…please..send someone.”

She tried to calm me down, but all I could do was hear the Crows. They began to squawk in a more full chorus.

“ Curt, I need you to tell me if the officers and paramedics can get to you.”

The birds squawking grew louder, I clutched my head as my ears began to ring.

“I…..I…what!?” I shouted into the phone, and she responded louder.

“can the Paramedics and Officers get to you?” 

“I….I'm not sure I'm off the usual trail about a quarter of a mile!”

The birds kept calling out, trying to drown out all other sounds. My ears began to ring louder, and the woman's voice was a muffled mess. I felt an ear piercing yell, tear out of my lungs.

“SHUT UP!!!!” 

suddenly, the birds all stopped and cranked their heads towards me. There was an uncomfortable silence that made all the worse now that the noise was gone. The crows spread their wings and took to the sky flying towards the slowly sinking sun. As I watched, I heard the woman.
“ Curt?! Curt? Are you ok?”

I placed the phone back to my ear.
“ y-yes…..sorry there was a group of crows…they…led me to the body…and they were being loud…I'm sorry.” 

She hesitated then in a soft voice replied.
“It's Ok….the officers are on their way. Can you help them find the body?”

“uh, yes… I can go off the trail and lead the officers here.”

She spoke softly over the phone.
“OK would you like me to stay on the call with you until then?”

I stuttered my mind still a whir with the sound of the crows and the discovery at my feet. 
“Yes…please…miss?”
“Lizz.” She responded softly.
 “My name is Lizz.”

As I walked back to the main trail, I spoke to Lizz, explaining why I was out there and how the Crows had led me to the body. She spoke softly to me, trying to keep me calm. She seemed sweet and kind over the phone. I would have asked her for more pleasant company, but given the circumstances, I decided now was not the time. As I reached the trail a half hour later, I saw the lights flickering from the officers and paramedics.

“Alright I'm back at the main trail. Thank you, Lizz, for the calming conversation.”

She spoke softly and said 
“It's alright, Curt. I hope you are OK and the Paramedics can help you.”

I felt a pang in my stomach as I knew the conversation was ending. I blurted out.
“Could I get your number?”

She chuckled over the other end.
“Well this is the strangest way a guy has ever asked for that, but sure, why not?”

I pulled out my pocket book and wrote down the number she gave me. We exchanged pleasantries, and the call ended.
Soon, I brought the Officers and the Paramedics around to the clearing, and they began to investigate the body as I told them the whole story. How I had been out there following some tracks, how the crows startled me, and I followed them to the body. One of the officers looked at me strangely. He was an older man, maybe in his late Fifties. his name badge gleamed in the flash light
‘Lesky’

“You a journo?”

I shook my head slowly.
“No, why do you ask?”

“cuz it sounds like you were looking for the Lurker.”

I felt my stomach twist slightly.
“I was…is there a problem.”

Lesky slowly adjusted his cap.
“listen kid, people who go looking for old ghost stories usually find nothing but trouble. So do me and my guys here a favor and quit while you're ahead.” 

A new twinge of morbid curiosity tingled up my spine.

“What makes you say that?”

He pulled a cigarette from his coat pocket.
“the last time some city slicker came here to look for the Lurker, he wound up dead.”
His eyes trailed to the macabre strewn corpse.
“and it was about as pretty as this.”

I raised my eyebrows
“what are you saying? A local legend did this.”

“all i'm saying is that there's something in these woods…and it wants to be left alone.”
A thin trail of smoke left his mouth as he flicked his barely started Cigarette onto the ground, stomping it into the brackish mud.
 He turned away from me and started telling his men to finish up as the paramedics were almost finished packing up the body.

“ Am I done here?” I asked one of the other officers, He nodded to me.
“if you are feeling well enough to drive, you can head home now, we may call you in for another statement once the coronary report comes in.”

I nodded, thanked him, and turned around to leave. as I slowly made my way back towards the edge of the clearing, I caught something just off the other end. Two gleaming lights, like burning coals. I blinked my eyes and shook my head. They were gone just as soon as they appeared. I shuddered, thinking my mind was playing tricks on me as I made my way back to my car. I couldn't help but shake the feeling I was being watched.
