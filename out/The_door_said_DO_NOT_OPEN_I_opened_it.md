We drove. 
 
The drive lasted forever. At first, I didn’t notice, I was too busy fidgeting with my shiny new phone. In my naivety, I figured this venture (rescuing my girlfriend from the hounds of hell) would take a couple hours, and I’d narrowly make it to school on time. Oh, how wrong I was. 
 
The cop didn’t speak; no music, no conversation, nothing. Just the sound of the V-8 engine barrelling down an anonymous side road. Finally, I spoke up.
 
“Um, where are we going?”
 
The cop grumbled something under his breath, gripping the wheel tightly, and kept driving. Earlier at the coffee shop, he introduced himself as Doug. He didn’t say much else. Only that he knew of this frozen hell-world Rowan was trapped inside. And that we should go get her, before it's too late.
 
We drove. 
 
I was getting fidgety, my phone no longer of interest. Ugh. Where was he going? We weren’t even in the city anymore. I began to worry. Maybe this disgruntled cop was going to torture me, and make me do unspeakable things. I imagined the worst. Many unthinkable scenarios played out in my mind. Doug was old, but he was tough as nails. His wrists were like logs, his eyes as cold as a killer’s heart. 


I was sitting in the back, which somehow made it worse. It was an old car, with the old-style seat belts, and old car smell. I didn’t like it. The old car blundered onward, until finally we pulled into a plot of land next to a cabin so derelict, it should’ve had a sign declaring: Hillbilly Haven.   
 
“Wait here.”
 
His revolver, clenched tightly within his large hands, made a good argument.
 
I waited.
 
My heart was leaping inside my throat. I hated myself for being so gullible. Like, why would I get into a car with some strange man? Yes, he was a cop (retired), and he claimed he could find my girlfriend. Still. I truly am an idiot. 
 
I watched him disappear behind the makeshift cabin. The only sound was the squawking jays, warning others of our presence, and the endless chorus of crickets. By now, I’m freaking out. Clearly, I wasn’t safe. I scanned the old car, looking for a weapon. Anything. There was a ballpoint pen on the dash. I grabbed it and stuffed it inside my sleeve, just in case. When I looked up, he was standing over me. I nearly screamed. He tapped on the window. I rolled it down manually, which I’d never done before. 
 
“Keep out of the bag.”  
 
Before disappearing again, he tossed a large khaki backpack onto the passenger’s seat. Despite the warning, I considered rummaging through it. Just a peek, right? But I didn’t dare. When he returned, gun in hand, he got into the vehicle and drove away. 
 
“Like, what’s going on?” I asked, trying to sound brave. 
 
“Needed supplies,” he grunted. “You didn’t think we’d just show up unprepared, did you?” His laugh was as dirty as an ashtray.
 
I didn’t know how to respond, so I kept quiet. If this psychopath was gonna kill me, let’s get it over with. After a summer of depression (the guilt of abandoning Rowan weighed heavy on my heart. And why wouldn’t it?) I enrolled in college, taking a welding course. I wanted to improve my life. Whatever that means. Now, this?
 
He drove fast, trailblazing through a series of rustic roads. I closed my eyes, and must’ve fallen asleep, because the next thing I know we’re in the parking lot of Brews and Wash. To my surprise, the lot was empty, save from a few druggies mucking about. 
 
“It’s closed,” I said, bewildered. 
 
The cop rolled his eyes, like this was yesterday’s news. Maybe it was.  
 
“We’ll enter through the rear.”
 
Those words didn’t sit well with me. I still did not trust this man. My heart was pounding so loud, I’m sure he could hear it. He stepped out of the vehicle and tapped on my window, rolling his fingers impatiently, until I got out. Above us, the sky was bleak; a storm was brewing. Surely, a sign for things to come.
 
“How are we gonna get in?” I asked.
 
Grinning, he licked his lips. This is a madman, I realized, not happily, as he produced a golden key. 
 
“This here’s the City Key. It’ll open anything.”
 
“We’re…?”
 
I didn’t have the heart to ask. Nor did I need to. Of course we were breaking in. It’s not like Ray would voluntarily let us pass through the door that declared: DO NOT ENTER! Besides, for whatever reason, Ray closed shop. He’s owned the laundromat for as long as I can remember. Nothing made sense. The cop rammed the City Key into the lock and turned. CLICK. His eyes danced with possibilities. 
 
“You go first,” he said.
 
I can’t believe I’m going through with this. Like, I should be in class right now!  Ugh. With a pouty face, I flicked on the light. No light came. Something was wrong. All the machines were gone, replaced by piles of black soot. The smell was like burnt plastic. The cop nudged me onward. 
 
“Take this.”
 
He reached into his bag and handed me a flashlight. The light was welcoming, as we descended into the dark and dingy basement, careful not to wack our heads.  
 
“What the…?”
 
I stopped and stared, not believing my eyes. It looked like a nuclear bomb had detonated. The cardboard boxes were obliterated, the mop bucket now a pile of ashes. The basement stank worse than upstairs. 
 
“Get going.”
 
The cop nudged me towards the door. The door with the DO NOT ENTER! sign. Only now, the door seemed different. Smaller somehow. The skull was colorless. It seemed sad, like its hopes and dreams were shattered.
 
I was handed the skull key. 
 
“Open the door.”
 
I didn’t appreciate being ordered around. I should jam the key down his scruffy throat. Instead, I took the key and shoved it into the large lock. 
 
Nothing.
 
I tried again, and shrugged. Doug’s face was blazing red, his eyes burning with rage. 
 
“Lemme try!” 
 
He snatched the key and fed it to the lock and turned.
 
Nothing.
 
We stood side by side, crouched awkwardly, while staring at the door with the DO NOT ENTER! sign. Doug’s face took a sour turn. I didn’t trust what he’d do next. 
 
An idea came to me. “Try the other key,” I said.
 
“Other key?” His eyes lit up. “Of course!”
 
The City Key worked! Finally, something was going our way. In the excitement, the cop shoved me aside and disappeared through the strange door, gun in hand. I turned and smashed my head and swore. Oh, how I hated this basement. 
 
A layer of mist was rolling in. The door was shimmering. It’s now or never. So, with a million thoughts crashing my mind, I entered the frozen hellscape. The door slammed shut behind me.
 
The cold hit me straight away. Why didn’t we bring warm coats? I could kill myself right about now. Ugh. My eyes were slow to adjust. Torrential winds pelted me from every direction. The snow was merciless. I could barely see my own hand in front of my face. The flashlight did nothing.  
 
“Doug!” I shouted. “Where’d you go?”
 
My voice was flattened by the oncoming storm. Shivering, I scanned the vicinity, shocked that the door we came through, now closed, was floating midair. Behind it, only snow. 
 
As my eyes adjusted, I noticed something resembling a snowy cave. I went towards it and slipped, falling flat on my face. Ugh. When I looked up, I groaned. Something was circling above me. Something huge. It looked like a Pterodactyl, with a long beak, spiky teeth and glowing red eyes.
 
“Doug!” 
 
Anger enveloped me. This was stupid. We were walking into certain death. Then it hit me: The cop has no intention of helping me. Clearly, he has his own agenda.  Whatever, I’m here now. The least I could do is try. I jumped to my feet and shouted as loud as humanly possible.
 
“Rowan!”  
 
Something struck the back of my head. Rocks. That stupid Pterodactyl was dropping rocks! I was on my knees, cowering, when a series of tortured screams startled me. The sound was abhorrent, like the screaming of a billion tortured souls, bellowing in despair. One thought sprung to mind: ESCAPE.
 
Admitting defeat, I turned back, thinking the door was behind me. It wasn’t. In the confusion, I must’ve gotten turned around. Oh, why didn’t we bring markers, or something. This was stupid. I wondered what the cop was up to, and if he was having better luck. I scanned the area, looking for the dreaded door. There! The door was to my right. Lying flat on my belly, which kept me warm, I crawled towards the door. Meanwhile, the dreaded dinosaur continued dropping rocks the size of Texas. 
 
I heard a familiar voice call my name. 
 
“Rowan!”
 
“Jackson! Is that really you!”
 
My heart found my mouth. I couldn’t believe it! She’s actually alive! Deep down, I thought she was dead. The only reason I went – besides the fact that I was ambushed and put on the spot – was to alleviate the life-destroying guilt, gutting me. The ground trembled. The wind and snow whirled. The terrifying screams reached a fervor. 
 
“Jackson! It’s a trap! Go back!”
 
Her voice was coming from below me. I tried following it, but I was stuck, frozen to the ground. The Pterodactyl swooped down and snatched me up; and the next thing I know, I’m high in the air, trapped inside its massive beak. The beak, as sharp as a surgeon’s blade, dug deeply into my back and neck. The pain was tremendous.
 
A shot rang out. 
 
The high-flying creature went berserk, flinging me like a toy in a dog’s mouth.  I jammed the ballpoint pen into its eye. It made a sound like a Harley. Then it dropped me, and I crashed onto the icy surface.
 
The ground below me groaned. The ice was cracking. Before I could move, the ground opened up and swallowed me. While falling, I saw the cop, revolver in hand, shooting at the bird. I grinned, despite plummeting towards certain death, and said a prayer. Then, CRASH. My body smashed the snowy surface. Ugh, my body felt like a punching bag.
 
Ear-piercing screams surrounded me, sending ripples down my spine. I looked up and froze. Hunkering over me was a mammoth beast. It had eight arms, yielding treacherous tools of torture. The beast stomped with great force, its deadpan eyes never leaving mine. Before I could flee, it charged.  
 
The beast attacked with tremendous speed, grumbling and groaning and growling. Just before the beast bore down on me, I was grabbed, and dragging through the snow. Someone, or something, just saved me. I faded in and out of consciousness. When I came to, I was in a small cave. My girlfriend was snuggling me, a meager fire keeping us warm. 
 
“Rowan!” My voice was weak. 
 
“Shh,” she said, rubbing my back and arms, cleaning my wounds. 
 
Our eyes met, and all my troubles disappeared. I sighed. Then came a deafening crash, killing the moment. The fire extinguished. A pistol shot rang out. The cop! He must’ve followed me. Maybe he isn’t so bad after all. I shimmied to the edge of the cave, peering out. There are no words for what I saw, but I’ll try: 
 
Below us was a collection of caves which served as jail cells, each cell housing hundreds of slaves. The slaves were paper thin, covered in welts and sores, and moaning miserably. Pterodactyls were scorching them with fiery breath. As they floundered in flames, a band of behemoths, the size of ivory towers, showered them in icy water, turning their skin crispy blue. They hollered in agony, begging for mercy. Following that, swarms of fiery insects crawled into their eyes, and burst into flames. I watched, horror-struck, as the slaves poked their eyes out, while withering in anguish. Afterwards, the behemoths dragged them out of their cells, naked, and forced them to endure a humiliation ritual, in which a coliseum of motley creatures cheered on. The prisoners then returned to their respective dwellings and the scene played out again. 
 
“I can’t…”
 
“Shh.” Rowan was holding me tightly, warming me with her hands.
 
Something snapped. The sound was enormous, like grinding gears. Then came the alarm. 
 
“INTRUDER ALERT… INTRUDER ALERT… INTRUDER ALERT…
 
“Crap! They found us.” 
 
Rowan forced me to my feet. She was still wearing the coat I’d given her, only now it was torn to shreds. She removed it and wrapped me in it. I reveled in the warmth. My chattering teeth made speaking impossible, so I kissed her. It was the greatest kiss of all time. 
 
The ground shook violently, and I was tossed aside. Suddenly surrounded by an army of hellish creatures, I raised my arms in surrender. I didn’t stand a chance. The largest creature, which can only be described as a two-headed troll yielding a giant axe, spoke to me.
 
“You’re coming with me.” 
 
The thing, twelve-feet-tall, at least, scooped me into his mighty arms, and carried me towards the cells. Behind me, was a kerfuffle, but I couldn’t see what was happening. Then came gunfire. The creature dropped me, then turned and faced the cop.  
 
Doug, toting a pistol in each hand, tossed me a Smith & Wesson. “Hope you know how to use it, kid.” 
 
I did. Grandpa taught me well. With trembling hands, I shot the creature in the face. Blood exploded like fireworks. Rowan, using a crude bow and arrow, fired, hitting the creature in the eye. The creature dropped like a sack of stones.
 
The hell beings hushed. You could hear a pin drop. Suddenly, we were surrounded, our backs to one another. The three of us versus the Army of the Undead.  Crowds of hideous creatures, too many to count, watched in awe, anticipating our next move. The largest troll, wearing what can only be described as loose-fitting overalls and boots bigger than a house, was seething, oceans of drool slopping from its filthy face. His axe glistened as he raised it high.
 
“Grab my hands,” the cop ordered. “Both of you.”
 
I was shaken, and poor Rowan looked like she hadn’t eaten in months. We didn’t move.
 
“Now, goddammit!”
 
Our hands met, cold and clammy. 
 
“And away we go…”
 
Doug fired a grappling hook straight into the air. Next thing I know, we’re flying straight up, narrowly negating the hellish monsters. The troll groaned in protest, the Pterodactyls scorching us in flames. Then, WACK, our heads hit into the icy roof. 
 
“Hold tight.” 
 
Doug lifted himself to safety, helped us do the same, then dashed towards the floating door, with us trailing close behind. Before passing through the door (which thankfully was open), I spied one last look behind me, and shuttered. A red-horned devil was glaring at me, speaking in tongues, twirling his pitchforked tail.
 
…
 
“We did it. We actually did it!” 
 
Doug’s excitement was contagious. We hugged. By now, the basement floor was covered in ice and snow. The skull was snarling, eyes pointed like lasers. It belched a plume of sooty smoke from its mouth, then the door slammed shut, seemingly on its own. The door shimmered, then disappeared.
 
“Let’s get out of here.”
 
Doug drove us to a coffee shop, and treated us to coffee and crullers. He did most of the talking, explaining how he came upon the door many years ago, while doing undercover work.
 
“The door moves,” he told us, in between sips of piping-hot coffee. “God only knows where it’ll appear next.”
 
Rowan ate voraciously, but she refused to speak. Her troubled eyes wouldn’t meet mine. I slurped my coffee, unsure what to do or say. Part of me, I’m ashamed to admit, was disappointed for missing my class. It was nearly nine o'clock at night! How is that even possible?
 
“One thing I can’t figure out,” the cop looked curiously at Rowan, “is how you survived.”
 
Rowan burst into tears. I hugged her tightly, telling her everything will be okay. She wiped her eyes, then smiled. It was the most beautiful smile in the world. 
 
“Love,” she said.
 
“Of course!” the cop said. “You entered Hell with a loving heart.” 
 
Nothing more was said. We were fatally exhausted. Rowan spent the night at my place. She was frail, barely able to stand on her own, and fell asleep almost immediately. I needed medical attention, but decided it could wait. The next day, I awoke to my ringing phone. Doug. He talked fast and furiously, explaining how this is gonna go down. Clearly, we can’t tell the authorities that we rescued her from Hell, right? Doug had a plan. Turns out, he knows people. Important people. People who own him. People high up. 
 
His plan – which I won’t get into because he’d kill me if I did – worked. Rowan’s family were ecstatic, and welcomed her with open arms. It was obvious they’d suffered more than me, and were happy to hold her in their loving arms again. 
 
I guess you can call this is Happy Ending. And it is, I suppose. Rowan is getting stronger by the day. But something’s troubling me. While she was sleeping, I discovered something behind her ear: a tattoo, written in red ink. It’s small, barely visible, and creepy as hell. Something tells me this is no accident. That we did not, in fact, escape from Hell. That there’s a bigger picture. One which may infect the entire planet. Or perhaps, some other sinister scenario.
 
The tattoo, I discovered, is a number: [666.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
