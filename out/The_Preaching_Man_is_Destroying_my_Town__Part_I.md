“Sorry, my massive balls were weighing me down”, Shawn said so matter-of-factly that it sent all three of us into a fit of laughter. We’d made a bet that whoever made it to Locust Ave. last would have to pick up the next bar tab. Shawn had lost.

&#x200B;

Even though I had ran cross country in high school, I could still feel my heart pounding and fluttering from the short distance we’d raced. Still, I had finished second and wouldn’t have to pick up the ignorantly expensive tab at Darceys Sports Bar. I’d banked on the win, only having twelve dollars stuffed loosely in my pocket at that time.

&#x200B;

We continued down Locust towards Main, eager to continue our weekend debauchery. The noon bell tolled just before we hit the main drag and I knew that I wouldn’t make it much past three with the prolific buzz I had already caught. 

&#x200B;

“Ya’ll see that bartender eyeballing me?” Shawn grinned, shrugging his shoulders. 

&#x200B;

“Yeah, no shit, it’s called maximizing your tips, dippy”, Dimi laughed and shoved Shawn who wobbled to and fro, nearly falling off the sidewalk and dumping into the street. “Besides, she was probably in her 50s”, he continued.

&#x200B;

Shawn shrugged again, “cougars need love too”. 

&#x200B;

A bunch of kids poured out of the small local theater as we turned onto main street, a tired looking woman tried to keep up behind them. It was Miss Flickinger, the Canpaluca High English teacher and resident librarian. Most kids didn’t much care for her, but I’d always had a soft spot considering my love of writing. Maybe she was easier on me for that reason. 

&#x200B;

“Hey, Miss Flickinger!”, I blurted, my drunken idiocy must’ve been glaringly obvious. She smiled, a wrinkled, tired smile, and continued on to the Chrysler Town and Country that the kids had congregated near. 

&#x200B;

As soon as we were out of earshot, Shawn piped up, “I told ya’ she was a bitch, Mark, old hag didn’t even acknowledge you”, his face crumpled into a toddler-esque sneer. 

&#x200B;

“No she ain’t”, I spat, “you’d be pressed too if you were toting around a car full of little pecker woods like that”, the three of us burst into hysterics. I couldn’t help but feel a little proud that I’d made them laugh, I love making people laugh. 

&#x200B;

We meandered down the street for a while longer, sometimes stopping to fuck with each other some more, before Darceys came into view. The squat brick building stood out like a sore thumb between the polished insurance agency and butcher shop. 

&#x200B;

Finally, after taking much longer than it should’ve, we arrived at the bar.

&#x200B;

“I’ll be in, in a second, ya’ll”, I called after them, but the door had already eaten them up before the words fully left my mouth. ‘Assholes’, I thought, smiling. It wasn’t often we were able to all get together, but when we did, it was always fun… and always trouble. 

&#x200B;

Dimi, short for Dimitri, had been studying at the neighboring city's University. He wanted to be an engineer, but Shawn and I had our doubts. Not that Dimi wasn’t smart, he was very intelligent, but his work ethic left something to be desired. 

&#x200B;

Shawn, up to this point, had been the most successful of the three of us despite dropping out of  high school. He had worked his way up to being a foreman at a small tree-trimming outfit at the young age of 23. He’s built like a rock but I’d reckon’ he’s about as smart as one, too. 

&#x200B;

There was also Shawns growing cocaine habit, which he’d managed well at one time but was growing more and more obvious that it was out of control. ‘As is tradition’, I chuckled, thinking about all the times he’d gotten us kicked out of bars for being too belligerent. Ever since his high school sweetheart had left him, partly due to the cocaine and partly due to his infidelity, his spiral had grown even steeper. Dimi and I were keeping a close watch, after all he was still our friend.

&#x200B;

I pulled the tattered pack of L&Ms from my back pocket and lit one up. Cigarettes always tasted good when you were a few drinks deep. 

&#x200B;

The sun sat directly overhead, casting a haze above the roads which connected at the fourway of the town square. Between our race and the thick heat, I could feel the growing weight of my sweat-soaked shirt. Either way, the cigarette tasted magnificent and the occasional breeze had made the heat a little more bearable. 

&#x200B;

A buzzard circled overhead, waiting for the Chrysler to pass by before returning to the rotting coon which had been half-smushed into the blacktop. Gross.

&#x200B;

Across the street from the town square, a gaggle of folk entered the new Mexican place which had opened last year. Before then, the Dollar Tree had been the main attraction of Canpaluca. Buttfuck, Nowheresville, is what I’d always called it when people asked me. 

&#x200B;

Ordinarily, especially on an oppressively hot day like this, the town square would be empty. Not today. A small collection of townsfolk, some familiar and some not, were arranged in a circle around a man dressed in a white button-up and burgundy slacks. His voice rose and fell in a cadence similar to a preacher giving a sermon. The group surrounding him was silent. 

&#x200B;

For some reason, that man looked familiar. But from where?

&#x200B;

“Fuck”, the cigarette, which was nothing but filter, had burnt the tip of my finger. I threw it down, smashing the cancer stick until it was nothing but a spot on the ground. 

&#x200B;

I studied the preaching man for a while longer before heading inside to join the other two. 

&#x200B;

Despite my previous disbelief we’d make it past much past the young afternoon, some of Shawns snow perked me right up. Even though I didn’t condone his heavy usage of the stuff, I couldn’t help but dabble in it from time to time. Especially when you’re out day-drinking. Gotta stay alive, right?

&#x200B;

With dusk came the pretty ladies, replacing the leathery farmers who’d gone home to continue their drinking away from the young, rowdy crowd. 

&#x200B;

I didn’t give the preaching man much thought the rest of that night, my alcohol and speed-fueled brain was preoccupied with the blonde beauty who’d taken up residence on the barstool directly by me. Along with her, Shawn had already tried his best pick-up lines on every other person who didn’t have a dick in the establishment. When it was apparent he wouldn’t be taking anyone home that night, he’d resorted to finishing his bag and getting as fucked up as his body would allow. 

&#x200B;

At that moment I realized two things, I didn’t have much longer to get this girls number and that Shawn would soon be asked to leave. We’d have to help him get home. 

&#x200B;

I’d never been real good at talking to women, wondering if it was better to be polite or act in a more mysterious way. I opted for the latter. 

&#x200B;

I asked the bartender for a slip of paper and a pen before jotting my name and number down, handing it to the girl I’d come to find out was named Carter. 

&#x200B;

“Give me a call if you’d like, I gotta take his goofy ass home”, I said, thumbing over at Shawn who was pestering some guys over a pool game. She smiled and accepted the paper, though there seemed to be something else about her face. Disappointment that I was leaving, maybe?

&#x200B;

As I spun in the barstool, signaling to Dimi (who was glued to one of the four slot machines by the entryway) that it was time to leave, her soft voice called behind me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was nice meeting you, Mark”, she said, smiling and meeting my gaze with her glassy eyes. 

&#x200B;

I stopped, sure that my wild eyes and clenched jaw must’ve been terrifying but she only continued to smile. ‘God is she pretty’, I thought. I must’ve studied her big, diamond eyes for an eternity before responding.

&#x200B;

“Maybe we can get some coffee”, even with the extra cocaine-induced confidence, I turned quickly and started for the door. That was that. 

&#x200B;

After some coaxing and false promises we managed to get Shawn to Dimi’s car and headed off into the night. The ride was nauseating and immediately forgotten. After we’d gotten Shawn home, who lived on the edge of town by the golf course, we returned to the townsquare where my apartment complex sat opposite Darceys bar. 

&#x200B;

If Dimi and I exchanged words before he himself set off, then I’d forgotten them.

&#x200B;

I stumbled out of the lagoon blue Jeep and down the sidewalk leading to the front door of the complex. My apartment being the first left upon entry, was easy enough to find but had become a difficult task once the blow had worn off and the alcohol caught up. 

&#x200B;

I fumbled for the set of keys in my pocket, pressing the main door to the complex open. As I flipped through the keys I almost ran into the woman standing at my door. 

&#x200B;

“Oh shi-”, I stepped backward, nearly losing my footing. Once I’d steadied myself I got a good look at the stranger who was blocking my way. She was short and round, her lips were pulled back in that same way all meth heads did once they lost their last tooth. Her hair was incredibly curly and incredibly thin, her scalp apparent even through my double-visioned lenses. She smiled a hideous, toothless smile.

&#x200B;

She stepped forward, grabbing weakly at my arms. 

&#x200B;

“Help uth thee the other thide”, she said, her grip strengthening. “Help uth, help uth thee”, she was growing hysterical as she began to shake me. A surge of adrenaline reawoke my numb and aching body, batting her fat, grubby hands away as I continued searching for the right key to my apartment. She was persistent.

&#x200B;

She continued grabbing at me as I slid in between her and the doorway, using my back as a shield to the deluded thing.

&#x200B;

“Help uth, mithter, pleathe”, her voice came out in ragged, breathless waves. She smelled of rot.

&#x200B;

Truthfully, despite the danger the woman posed, I still feel horrible for the way I shoved her. She fell slow, comically slow, her head smacking the rail of the stairs which lead up to the second floor of the complex. A clump of flesh and scraggly hair took up residence on the edge of the railing, a pool of blood seeped from her head. 

&#x200B;

I know it was wrong now, and I knew it was wrong then, but I left the woman laying there and I fled to the comfort of my bed as soon as I found the right key. Sleep came easy that night. 

&#x200B;

I didn’t awake until just before noon the next day, the birds chirping outside felt like BB pellets shooting around my aching head. My heart was racing madly. This would be one hell of a hangover. I rolled over to the other side of the bed, searching the nightstand for my phone before finding it in my pocket of the jeans I had slept in. The screen was blurry and bright. 

&#x200B;

‘Still up for coffee ;)’, the text read at the top of my list of notifications. It was Carter. For a moment, just a moment, I forgot about the terrible drumming in my head. 

&#x200B;

As I laid sideways in the bed, my clothes still on from the day before, I conjured up the best response I possibly could. 

&#x200B;

‘What time?’, was all I could manage, but it would have to do. I threw the phone somewhere on the bed and massaged my temples, trying to recall if anything particularly embarrassing had happened the previous night. As I scanned through my memories, I recalled the woman who had been standing outside my apartment.

&#x200B;

“Fuck, fuck, FUCK”, I yelled, despite my head screaming in protest. I jumped up from the bed and ran for the door, awaiting the gore or the police standing on the other side. Instead, there was nothing, not one drop of blood. 

&#x200B;

Maybe it had been a bad dream? It all seemed so vivid, though. I ignored the icky feeling in my gut and started for the shower. 

&#x200B;

If it wasn’t for the coffee date Carter and I agreed on for later that afternoon, that Sunday would’ve been the epitome of misery. Instead, it seemed hopeful.

&#x200B;

I left the complex, past the mysteriously blood-free entryway and back outside into the real world. If yesterday had been hot, then today was blazing. Not a great mix with a hangover. As I walked past the town square, a slightly larger congregation of people had gathered beneath the gazebo at its centermost point. The man in the middle was giving his sermon-esque speech as the crowd of folk watched in awe. 

&#x200B;

“We must see the other side, we WILL see the other side”, he sang.
