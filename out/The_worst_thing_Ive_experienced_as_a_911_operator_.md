M My name is Corey and I’m a 911 operator.  I’ve been doing that for around 6 and a half years now. Not many things make me too nervous or scared. So I’m pretty good at calming people down and making sure that don’t freak out when I’m on the line with them. But recently I answer a call that would make me close to quitting and make me unable to sleep for days. This story takes place around covid in the fall of 2020.

That day I was working the late shift. The girl I was usually working next to was named Alex. For most of her day she’s filling out numerous papers and flies at her desk behind me. She’s sweet but also gets freaked out easily which isn’t fun to deal with. It was just the two of us on in the section that night since covid was taking mover at this time. I was exusted and all I wanted was to go back home. Heat up a nice, soft, warm hot pocket and fall asleep. But that wasn’t the reality I was in at the moment. As I was slowly beginning to drift off I heard that ringing. It had been about 50 minutes since that last call and I was ready do leave. It was 1 after all, even if I was a murdering  psychopath I would want 1 am to be a sleep period and not a killing innocent period. Alex laughs and pinched me on my arm to get me up.

“Get up and answer it” she said, I could tell she wanted to hear something else that wasn’t the half broken fan that was above us to the left.

2 and a half years in and I had nailed that calm cheery voice that most of us had. Even if I was half asleep I could do it flawlessly. My friends will call my phone and ask if it’s “911”, it’s honesty not funny even though my other friends think it’s hilarious.

I picked up the old red and white phone and said “911 What’s your emergency?” 

If only I knew what would come next.

After a couple seconds a deeper voice on the other end responded “Help… I need help.”

I had heard this a lot, but the way he said it got to me in the moment a little. The small crack in his voice and the fact he sounded like my uncle who is 6’4 240. I had never heard him sound scared in the slightest.

I continued “what exactly do you need help with sir?” 

This time it took longer for him to respond. All I could hear was heavy breathing and what sounded like footsteps. But I couldn’t tell through the sound of the breathing. 

Suddenly he spoke again. “there’s someone in my house, I think he’s in my frunchroom.” His voice was even more shaky and quiet.

Living in Chicago all my life I had answered to some home break ins. But always after the intruder had left, this time he wasn’t.

“Can I have your name?”, nothing for a couple minutes. “Ok, can you tell me your place of residence”.

“4344 rose street”, I jumped by how fast he responded. He was even quieter I had to turn up every volume button I could fine so I could hear him.

Alex gave me a look. This was her 1st year at the hospital and she hadn’t seen as much messed up stuff as I did. She gave me this look, like she knew something or had an idea about how this could escalate but was scared to tell me.

I mouthed “what is it?” To her in a soft whisper” all she did was shake her head and point me back to the phone. 

“Is anyone there” the caller said with urgency. 

“Yeah, I’m still here sir, where are you currently.”

“There’s a space in-between ground level and my basement-“ a loud crashing sound  then came from somewhere in the house. At this point I had Alex call this in and she had the police unit then go check the address to help this guy. 

But in the moment I was terrified, this was my first time dealing with anything like this. I was beginning to panic more and more. 

I needed to stay focused, “Are you okay”

“He’s right above me.”

“Sir I need you to stay on the line and tell me everything that happens until now and when the police get here, they are on their way.” Truth is i didn’t even know if they got alexs call in yet.

“I can hear him walking away” the man said calming down a bit.

“Wait it’s a him” I was so focused on trying to calm him down and staying calm myself that I had failed to realize he was being referred to as a him”.

Then the caller said this, “it’s the man with the devil horns.”

I tried to speak but I couldn’t. That name was so berried down in my brain that I couldn’t even remember if I had tried. Every thing I’ve learned through out all 

“Hello….. hello is anyone there.”

His voice was drowned out and I was frozen thinking about… the man with the devil horns”

Alex shoved my chair to the side and grabbed the phone her self. She asked some more questions but I couldn’t even comprehend them because I was so focus on trying to remember and also forgot that week. Where that man did things that would make me a different person.

“He’s going down stairs
(Jerry you don’t have to hide from me buddy)”

 This is entire time there was another muffled voice calling for the now named jerry, but now I could hear that voice, that devilish evil voice. The one that haunted me for years. Alex slapped me out of my trance and I got forced back into reality

“What are you doing Corey.” Alex said not trying to have her voice heard through the phone

“I’m sorry Alex” 

“What’s up with you, and also who’s the man with devil ho-”

I cut her off there. “Don’t say his name”

“Corey, Who’s name”

“He’s under me” Jerry said more quiet then before”

I had completely forgot I was on a 911 call.

I snapped out of my trans and continued on the line with Jerry, “Jerry since he’s in the basement, is there anyway you can open the crawl space entrance and run outside to your car”

A man spoke, but it wasn’t Jerry “BOO, awwwww you’re not there, ya know this whole game was fun but how bout you come back out and we can play another game together.”

Alex looked more freaked out than me, she physically moved back and out of her chair. More and more from my childhood came back to me second by second. My heart was beating faster and faster and I was even more scared to keep the call going, I just wanted these damn officers to get there already.

“I’m scared I don’t know if I can” he said answering my question.

“Well you have to try”, in the moment being encouraging is really hard, but you get good at it after awhile

Slowly I could hear him crawl through his current location and I could hear… that man get madder and madder each passing minute.

“Look jerry, I’m getting real sick and tired of this bullish-t ok, JUST COME OUT” the man sounded even more mad and I could hear louder and faster footsteps each second.”

“Any progress jerry.”

“Yes I’m almost at crawl space door, but I creeks and I don’t have my keys”, I was relieved but still worried at the same time.

“Do you know where they are and also do you have neighbors.”

“No and maybe” I didn’t know what to do at this point but thankfully Alex asked for the phone since she could see me getting sweaty and nervous. 

Alex spoke for the first time in around 10 minutes “do you know where your keys could be.”

“Possibly on my recliner in the franchroom but I’m not too sure” Jerry said even quieter this time, I could hear.. um I could get him getting louder and alex made sure jerry was being as quiet as possible.

“Come on out jerbear (inaudible speaking), it won’t hurt that much. I little Knick of the ear and nose won’t hurt that much, you might get lucky and pass out before the rest of my work gets done.”

By this point both Alex and Jerry started crying a bit so I retook over.

“Jerry are you still there.”

It took awhile but he responded after a little bit “Yeah **sniff**”

“Great, your doing great, besides the door is there anyway you could get out.”

“I could break a floor board, but the multiple layers, I don’t know where is the police.”

It never takes this long for the police to get to a house, Alex found out over the intercom that Jerry’s cabin is location on a hill, thus taking longer to get too.

“The horned man’s still talking”

“About anything in particular.”

“He’s talking about all of his quote on quote “friends”.”

By this Point I didn’t want to know anymore while at the same time wanting to know everything their is too know

“Did he say a name of some sort.”

“He, he um, he said hes going to take me to Corey’s friends play area .”

I will never forget the look Alex gave me, all the emotion and soul friend he face just… vanished.

“What’s he talking about Corey” she said with tears boiling up in her eyes, one streaming down her face.

I didn’t know what to say, the only words I could utter out were, “Me”

Jerry spoke “I’m going to make a break for it.”

I mustered all the power I could to speak. The memories just kept coming back, what he did to my friends, their bodies. It felt like I was fighting myself in the moment just trying to think properly.We got a call in that the damn police were having car issues and would need to delay. Alex tried her best to yell at them so they could get a move on but for now jerry was the only person who was capable of saving himself.

“Be careful and as quiet as you possibly can jerry, from now on don’t talk to us since he will most likely hear you.”

Jerry said he agreed and I could hear him slowly opening the door and stepping on to the stairs.

“Ok go find your keys, if you can’t within the next couple minutes just run and don’t look back.”

“O-ok”

A cough, i tiny little cough came out of his mouth, while we could barley hear it, He could as well.

“I HEAR YA JERBEAR.”

I heard footsteps running up the stairs, each step being loud as Jerry’s footsteps started to, next I hear a door slamming open and more screaming.

“COME ON JERRY, YA BASTERD YOU CANT OUT RUN ME. ILL MAKE SURE YOUR DEATH IS SLOW and PAINFUL.”

Alex started panicking. He was getting louder and I just hoped that Jerry had an unlocked door.

Hands shacking I needed to keep me composure even more so I didn’t freak out jerry and the now crying Alex. “Jerry did you find a way out.”

“Yes, he’s right behind me- (don’t be scared jerbear, it won’t hurt. I just wanna have a new friend, I haven’t had a new friend in a while jerry heheh ha)”

By now the man’s screams hear clearly audible from Jerry’s phone. I didn’t know what to do next, I felt like there was no way out of this situation.

I next heard more footsteps but also what sounded like leaves and sticks snapping. It took me a second to realize that officer Davis radioed in saying he, Jill and rutker had arrived. Alex took over the police com while I continued the main phone call. 

We could track Jerry’s phone but as I heard the sound of a loud thud and quieter and quieter footsteps. Jerry’s tracker and phone stopped dead in its tracks. Jill heard leaves rustling near the back of the house and left to investigate, while Davis and rutker continued looking on the other side of the road.

Me and Alex started to calm down more and more. Alex said the first word “what’s happening Corey, who is that man.”

“Alex, when I was a kid. A man lived down the street. He was the ice cream man, a teacher at the elementary school. One day , I went out with my friends to the theater, my dad was out of the one of sight and then he came up to me. I can still remember his laugh. He told me he wants to hang out with my friends, I said no just thinking this was a joke. It wasn’t, I saw his car outside of my house and he came out with that god for saken horns on the mask he was wearing and he said hi through the window.”

After all that Alex spoke back up. “wait was that it.”

My hands were shaking and I almost couldn’t breathe. I was getting cold and I could feel goosebumps appearing. “Later that night, he killed then all, except me and only me.”

“Oh my god  Corey that’s awful, did he get caught.”

“They never got him, at least they didn’t with the mask on, but looks like they never did.”

A silence sounds through the room, I was getting sweaty and Alex was almost hyper ventilating. But just then the tracker started up again, we called it in and no one had picked it up. Then we get a message from the 911 message service. It was just a picture of the woods, from presumably Jerry’s phone. Alex send it to the officers and they looked for where the photo could have been take, but then we got another one. It was blurry, but I could see the face of a man with a tree branch stuck in the middle of his chest. This evil sick man did it again. We reported it back to the officers and they found jerry, really name jerry stringer, dead. With no man insight, the case went dry. No leads, no finger prints , no nothing. Alex has since left, it was for her own good, il still good friends with her, I’ve reconnected with a lot of friends from my childhood too. It’s been nice not living in fear. But something has been happening, there’s been a car being parked in the same spot near my house, and from what I know no one comes out of it, but I’ve never looked.

It’s started to creep me out, but I’ve ignored it, until the police brought me in to help with the case since one or two cops are still Interested  in it. They showed me some photos I haven’t seen in a while, and I’m one of those photos. That’s car was there, the one the man drove. But it felt weird seeing it, I had blocked out everything from my head but I felt like the car was the only thing that I could remember clearly. Then when I got home around midnight, I saw that car, the same one the man with the horns drove. Has he been watching me. I don’t know yet, I’ve never seen who’s in the car. I wrote this all to get my story out and to let you know, if anything happens to me, you know who did it and where I am.
