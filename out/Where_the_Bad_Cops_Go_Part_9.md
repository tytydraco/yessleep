I wish I could give you more detail. I wish I could give *myself* more detail. But what happened was that they draped a black hood over my head, and that was that. I was to be taken somewhere, and no one would tell me anything. And why would they? I didn’t need to know where I was taken, or why. They had their own agenda.

There was a bumpy car ride, the sound of sliding metal, and an elevator. Firm hands gripped my arms to the point where they bruised. Apart from the occasional ‘go’, there were no words. The elevator had gone down, so I guessed I was somewhere underground.

When the hood came off, I was in a brightly lit concrete room. There was a simple bed, a toilet, a sink, and a metal door. There were no indicators as to where I was. No clocks. No phones. The only thing to keep my mind busy were a couple of magazines next to the sink. They were mostly about things like fishing and camping, from the turn of the millennium.

 

Time passes differently in a place like that. You start to imagine things, and you lose track of yourself. From the point where you go to sleep to when you wake up, everything looks the same. It’s like no time has passed at all. You start to doubt yourself. Did you sleep for six hours, or ten minutes? Has it been five minutes since your last drink of water, or two hours?

At times, there’d be commotion outside. People grunting and struggling with something. They’d swear, or scream. You got used to it after a while.

It must’ve been three or four days before I got to see another person. By that time I’d read through every magazine dozens of times, counting how many times each letter showed up. I’d counted every ceramic tile on the floor, walls, and ceiling. I was desperate.

 

It was a stranger that opened the door. She looked nice enough, a tall woman in her 50’s with combed-back hair, like she was fresh out of the shower.

“You’re not gonna cause me trouble, are you?” she asked.

“Should I?”

“I wouldn’t advise it. I’m just here to check on you.”

I didn’t fight her. There were plenty of guards outside; I’d just put myself in a world of pain. Instead she checked my pulse, shone a light in my eyes, and asked to check my throat. She had these thick gloves and a pair of protective goggles – possibly to make sure I wouldn’t accidentally infect her with SORE.

 

“I can’t believe it is stable,” she said. “I’ve never seen that.”

“But you’ve seen it… unstable?”

“Oh, several times. This type of affliction is more common than you think.”

She put together a couple of pills in a small cup and handed it to me. I didn’t take them.

“It’s just vitamins,” she said. “See?”

She downed one of them without a drink of water, like a lunatic. I decided that, for now, I’d trust her. She seemed harmless enough.

 

As she was about to leave, I panicked a little. I didn’t want to be stuck in that room for more time than necessary, and I was practically climbing the walls at that point. I followed her to the door, and watched the guard outside tense up with his taser.

“Please,” I said. “I’m going crazy in here.”

“Sorry about that,” she sighed. “Most people in your condition aren’t as… mentally stimulated.”

“Are there others like me down here?”

“A handful,” she said. “Most of them just sit there or stand in the corner. So I suppose none of them are really like you.”

“Miss, I’ll… I’ll go crazy in here. You gotta do something. I’m not like them.”

 

She looked me up and down. There was a sort of sympathy there, for sure. She was hesitant.

“Dudley brought you in, right?” she asked.

“Yeah,” I nodded. “I don’t even know what you want from me.”

“Well, we’re going to do tests. We’re going to see what the difference between you and the other infected are.”

“For how long? What’s gonna happen to me?”

She opened her mouth to say something, but changed her mind. She gave me a pat on the shoulder.

“You have to understand,” she said. “Most people who come here don’t leave. They can’t. You’re something new, and I don’t think anyone has figured out how to deal with that yet.”

“Listen, I’ll play ball,” I said. “Just don’t stick me in here like an animal.”

“Fair enough.”

 

I agreed to do some preliminary tests. I was taken to an examination room where the lady collected some basic samples. Blood, saliva, urine. She also checked my ears and feet. It wasn’t all that uncommon for those infected by SORE to have very dark nails, apparently.

She already knew my name, but she introduced herself as Allie. She’d been with Hatchet for over 12 years, and before that she’d been a professor at UC Berkeley. I didn’t have to tell her a lot about myself – she’d read the files.

“What I don’t understand is how all this happened in the first place,” she said. “SORE doesn’t just stop on its own. You must’ve done something.”

“I met this woman out by St. Gall,” I said. “Had a blue kaftan. After speaking to her, I was just… fine.”

“I’d love to meet her,” Allie said. “But I suspect that whoever that was wouldn’t be all too eager to  work with us.”

 

I had a couple of x-rays taken, and then she emerged with a massive syringe. Seeing my reaction, she put it away.

“We’ll take the bone marrow some other day,” she said. “But I’m afraid that’s all for today.”

“Please don’t put me back in there,” I said. “It messes with my head.”

“How about this. I ask the guards to turn the lights off at 9pm, and I get you a couple of books to read. Would that help?”

I shrugged. It’d help, but it still wasn’t an enticing thought.

“And we’ll talk again tomorrow,” she added. “Deal?”

“Sure, yeah. Deal.”

 

For the next few days, Allie tried to make sure I was as comfortable as possible. Lights out at night, books to read, and she came by at least once per day. Mostly just to get a couple of samples, or to discuss results. For example, the iron value in my blood was a lot lower than it ought to be, so I had to take some extra pills for that.

Days would pass. Maybe weeks. The only people I’d see were Allie and the guards, and Allie was the only one talking to me. We developed a sort of quasi-friendship, where she’d get me out of my cell and I’d provide her with answers. And sometimes, we’d just sit and talk for a while. She’d tell me about her sons back in California, and about her messy divorce a year or so back. It was nice to hear something ordinary.

Then there was that one day when she wanted to show me why they were doing this to begin with. To give me some context.

 

We wandered around the other cells. There were about half a dozen in total. There were more rooms, but most were empty.

“We can’t go in without full hazard gear,” she said. “They may look calm, but the slightest provocation can set them off.”

She walked up to a door and opened a small hatch, protected with plexiglass. There was middle-aged man in there, lying on his bed. There was something coming out of his mouth. Little white strands.

“Looks harmless enough,” I said. “Is it really that bad?”

Allie knocked on the door, once.

 

The man shot out of his bed and threw himself at the door with complete abandon. He had this long wound across his neck where more white strands protruded, and now that he was provoked I could see more coming out of his nose, ears, and eyes. Just like what’d happened to me.

“Some people change more, some less,” she explained. “Long before my time, they tried experimenting with specific dosage in volunteers, to see if the transformation could be steered.”

“Could it?”

“Not really,” she sighed. “But boy, could it do some terrible things.”

The man pressed his face against he plexiglass. The white strands poked and prodded at the edges, trying to find a way through. Allie didn’t back down.

“Most people already have a miniscule amount of the catalyst in their system,” she explained. “Sort of like… microplastics.”

“What is it?” I asked.

“I think the layman’s term for it is Blameless. Stupid name, but it seems pretty ingrained by now. But there was a Danish-American philosopher that had another name for it.”

She closed the hatch and looked me straight in the eye. Maybe just for effect, or to drive a point home.

“He called it the soul,” she said. “He claimed that this material was what gave our ancestors that first ability to speak, to think, and to reason.”

 

I was shown a handful of other patients. I didn’t think all that much of it, until I saw a young woman. She had this black pixie-cut hair. I just blurted out my thoughts. I’d gotten so used to talking to Allie that I didn’t consider what I was saying.

“Elizabeth,” I said. “Salinger, right?”

“You two know each other?”

“In a way,” I said. “I knew her dad.”

“He’s been looking for her,” she said. “It’s horrible, really. She had a particularly gruesome infection.”

Allie looked through the hatch. Elizabeth was just standing there, drooling on the floor.

“There are certain creatures that feed on this… catalyst,” she explained. “But most people have very little of it. So what they do is they plant like… a seed. And over time it blossoms into, well… this.”

She pointed at the hatch.

“Once we’re well and ripe, they usually come back to harvest us. Like wheat.”

“When you say creature, you mean…”

Allie closed the hatch and turned to me. She leaned back against the door with her arms folded.

“I mean creatures. Unnatural things. Things that slip between the cracks from other places, and end up here. Things from places you and I can’t even imagine.”

 

Being taken back to my cell, I pondered this revelation. I wasn’t inclined to believe the word of a Danish-American philosopher, but I’d read about similar theories. Stoned Ape Theory, for example. There was a lot of talk about the evolution of man being instigated by a third party. Most of it was pseudoscientific nonsense though. Not that I read a lot of articles back then.

One night, as I was drifting off to sleep, I heard a noise. The guards were all back in their break room, so it couldn’t be them. I listened closely, trying to figure out where it was coming from. I ended up leaning against the door. There was a voice on the other side.

“Can you hear me?” it said.

“Barely.”

“I’m using the keypad,” it said. “It has a microphone. Volume don’t go louder than this.”

“You’re talking through a keypad?”

“If it’s powered, I can use it,” the voice said. “Are you the cop? The one they brought in?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Who is this?”

“I’m someone who can get you out of this place,” he said. “That sound interesting to you?”

“I’m listening.”

 

The voice explained that it was trying to gather some information about the facility, and that with my help, it could probably break a couple of locks. We would start with something small, just to try it out.

“There’s a lamp in your room,” he said. “It’s turned off, but it’s still connected. I’m gonna cycle through these, and you tell me if it comes back on.”

“Sure.”

A couple of seconds later, the lamp blinked.

“Got it,” I said. “It’s blinking.”

“Good,” the voice said. “That means I can isolate your floor. Hold on.”

There was a short pause, and then a click. The door was open.

“Just check it, don’t go out.”

It was, indeed, unlocked. I peeked out at the empty hallway.

“We got some work to do,” the voice said. “But I can get you out.”

“Why would you want to?” I asked. “Who is this?”

“I’m John Digman. And I need to get my nephew out of there.”

 

From that point on, I’d spend my day with Allie, and the evening with John. We’d speak through the electronic keypad, through the door. He’d ask me to perform little tests. At one point, I was even asked to go into the hallway and check if we could get other doors unlocked. Turns out, we could. I was a bit hesitant about unlocking the door for the middle-aged man, but luckily, he didn’t hear it. But at that one moment when the lock clicked, I expected him to jump out of his bed and storm the door.

I’d never actually interacted with John Digman directly like this before. His capabilities were downright frightening. He was getting enough influence to completely control the floor, but if that’s what it took for me to get out, hell, he could have it.

He was an uncomfortable person talk to, to say the least. There was something robotic about his voice and demeanor, beyond it coming from the keypad. Still, I could understand the urgency. If his nephew was also stuck down there, he’d be eager to get him out.

 

I remember one night when I lay awake, and John was tampering with the HVAC system. I spoke out loud to the keypad.

“You’re nephew is Perry Digman, right?” I asked.

“Yes.”

“We pulled him out of a ditch, you know. He was in bad shape.”

“I know,” he said. “That’s why I’m talking to you.”

“So this is my reward for helping you people?”

“In a way,” he sighed. “But you’re also new enough not to be burdened with preconceptions.”

“That’s a nice way of calling someone inexperienced.”

“That’s not a bad thing.”

 

There was a click at the door, another flicker of the light, and then a deep sigh from the keypad.

“Alright,” he said. “I think we’re ready. We act tomorrow, during the guard change.”

“And how, exactly, do I get out of here? And won’t they just grab me and put me back here?”

“There are no records of you ever being there,” John said. “And when I’m done, they’ll have bigger problems than you.”

“What are you going to do?” I asked.

There was no response. I waited for a full minute, before I asked him again.

“Tomorrow,” he said, ignoring the question. “Guard change.”

 

I was awfully anxious the next day. Allie came by to check on me again. We’d been doing some more intricate tests for the past few days, and she’d shown me the result of my x-ray. There really was something inside me – a large sprawl of thin lines emanating from a growth around my stomach lining. It was so prevalent on the x-ray that it was hard to differentiate from my nerves; it’d spread all throughout my body. I couldn't help but to notice the little blue sunflower logo on that x-ray, a reminder that I was still under Hatchet's boot.

“I can’t believe you’re not suffering any severe effects from it,” Allie said. “Most people go through stages of pain, desperation, and then succumb to the infection.”

“I barely notice it,” I said. “Sometimes when I get stressed I can feel it in my throat though.”

“You know, you might have a key to something amazing here,” Allie said. “It’s gonna take time, but I think what happened to you can be used to help others.”

“You really think so?”

Allie bent down to look through a blood sample on a microscope. She trusted me enough to not even look at me. I could easily pick up a scalpel from a nearby table and kill her, but she knew I wouldn’t.

“I really do,” she said. “I really, really do.”

 

I wasn’t sure what to do. Having talked to John, I got the impression that things were gonna go down no matter what I said or did. What exactly he was gonna do, well… I didn’t know. Maybe I didn’t wanna know.

That night, as the lights in my cell went off, I was wide awake. I was ready to go at a moment’s notice. I didn’t know what to make of John Digman, but he’d proven time and time again to be more than capable. If he wanted to get someone out, he could. But exactly how, well… that part worried me.

I was pacing back and forth in my room, not knowing what to expect. I felt a bit bad about Allie, truth be told. She’d done her best to make my time there bearable. I had to remind myself that she, and everyone else there, were for all intents and purposes – the enemy.

 

It must’ve been near midnight when I heard that first noise. It came out of nowhere. An alarm, spoken by a monotone digital voice.

“PRESSURE ALERT”, it repeated, over and over. “PRESSURE ALERT”.

There were a series of popping sounds going down the hall. The lights turned on and off, before shutting down completely. After a couple of seconds in the dark, a faint red glow emanated from the floor as the emergency lights came on.

Then the door swung open.

 

There were voices in the hallway. Someone demanding a person to stop. Someone screaming at the top of their lungs. Someone running down the hall, as if chased by the devil.

“John?” I said. “John, are you there?”

There was no response. No matter how many times I asked, there was still no response.  This was it – he was throwing the facility into chaos, and that was that. He never had the intention to help me, specifically. I would have to make it out on my own.

Walking out into the hallway, I could barely see a thing. There were pipes overhead that’d burst wide open, spewing out steam into a thick mist. I could barely see anything. It all just looked like a blood red fog.

 

I stuck to the wall and tried to make it to the elevator. At times I’d hear someone running nearby, but I couldn’t see them. The thought hit me that all the people from the adjacent rooms were on the loose, running wild. There was no telling what they might do. Maybe the SORE-infected would ignore me.

I made it to a corner. I had my suspicions about where the elevator might be, so I continued to the right. I almost slipped in a small pool of still warm blood. I swallowed my unease and kept going, trying not to imagine what might’ve happened. A couple of feet later, there was a bloody handprint on the wall. By the angle of it, I got the impression that someone had been dragged down the hallway.

I almost missed the elevator. It was hard to see anything, and the elevator doors were painted to blend in with the wall. There was a numbered keypad, but I didn’t know the code. I hoped against hope that Digman had disabled it, but after a couple of clicks it was evident that he hadn’t.

 

“You don’t wanna use that.”

It was Allie. She’d armed herself with a handgun. For a moment, I thought she might use it on me. Instead she kept it at her side, and kept looking around.

“They got orders to shoot anything that goes up,” she explained.

“So if something happens, you’re all just dead?”

“We use the service tunnels in case of emergency.”

“Okay, so let’s do that. Let’s use the service tunnels.”

Allie didn’t know what to say. She stepped a little closer, and lowered her voice.

“There’re more than six subjects at the facility,” she said. “Way more.”

“How many?”

“We’re talking close to a hundred.”

 

We were going to have to get to the basement level and exit through the service tunnel, wading through close to a hundred SORE-infested people. Allie needed hazard gear to make sure she wasn’t infected, but there were people standing outside the laboratory. There was no way to get past them without a fight, so we settled to move the other way. We could check the other floors.

There was a silent agreement. I’d help her, and she’d help me. We were on different sides of this deal, but we both understood what was at stake. I even sympathized with her a bit. Under different circumstances, we could’ve worked together – but being kidnapped and dragged to an unknown location by Hank Dudley was just something I couldn’t accept.

Still, I couldn’t help but to feel a gnawing guilt about this. If I hadn’t helped John Digman, none of this would’ve happened. Then again, it was on them too. If they hadn’t taken me in, they’d have been fine.

 

We made it to the staircase and continued down. I couldn’t see the bottom floor. I got the impression that even if the lights were fully functioning, it might be deep enough to still not see the bottom. We could hear echoing cries coming from levels below. After a couple of steps, there was a gunshot. Allie clutched her handgun like a teddy bear.

“You ever use that thing?” I asked.

“Never,” she admitted.

“I have.”

She stopped and thought about it, then nodded. She used a small key on her keychain to remove a little widget from the trigger and handed the gun to me. I made sure the safety was off.

 

We continued to the next level. We wanted to go check for hazard gear, but there were too many people moving in the fog. It was impossible to tell if they were guards or not at a distance. Allie didn’t want to risk it, so we kept going. We took a sharp right out of the staircase, and onto one of the lower floors. It seemed to be a kind of administration level, complete with a couple of cubicles and a conference room. There was no one there.

“This facility is connected by an underground network of tunnels,” she said. “They were originally bomb shelters.”

“As long as there’s a way out,” I said.

“There should be, but I’ve never been there.”

She took a left into an office. Her own office, it seemed. She dug through the drawers of her desk, looking for something.

“I got backup gear,” she said. “I just need the keys to the locker.”

Then she stopped. She stared at something in the middle of the desk.

 

A black spot.

Allie didn’t know what to make of it. Then, she started shaking her head.

“No,” she gasped. “No, no, no, how did they even-“

There was a click overhead. Sprinklers.

 

It wasn’t exactly water. It was more viscous, like thin jelly. It had this awful smell of ammonia and chlorine, and it coated the entire room in it; staining everything. It was the same substance that’d covered my skin when I first got infected by Adam Salinger.

Allie just looked at her hands, letting the keys slip between her fingers. There was no point in getting that hazmat suit anymore. She was already infected. For a moment she just stood there, as if considering every choice she’d ever made that put her in this position. Allie looked at me more confused than scared, as if she couldn’t understand it.

“Come on,” I said. “Let’s go.”

“No,” she said. “No, I… it’s too late.”

“You don’t know that. You don’t understand it.”

“You don’t come back from it,” she said. “I’m done.”

 

Her fingers curled as she looked up. Her breathing grew forced.

“It feels… comforting,” she said. “Inviting.”

And she opened her mouth wide; drinking the black water.

 

I grabbed her by the shoulder and dragged her back out into the hall. I pushed her up against an opposing wall, pointing directly at her face.

“It’s *not* done!” I said. “We’re getting out, and you’re showing me the way, right now!”

She coughed, and something slipped out between her lips. Allie shook her head, as if trying to get rid of the intrusive thoughts. She nodded at me. Without another word, we kept going.

We continued down another two levels, until we got to an elevator. This was a lower-level elevator, not connected to the surface. It was probably meant to exclusively move things between floors rather than transport people in and out of the facility. Maybe it was meant to move subjects without the risk of them getting out.

Allie stumbled into the elevator, trying to get the keypad to work. She pressed it two times, but couldn’t get it right.

“My hands,” she said. “I’m… I’m shaking too much.”

“Gimme the code.”

She did, and I pressed it. The elevator rolled downward.

 

The doors opened to a nightmare.

It was a large cave-like opening, large enough for trucks to drive through. The ground was covered in the black water, and there were a lot of people out there. Easily over a hundred. Not only subjects, but infected support staff, guards, and maintenance workers. There were even a couple of people with hazmat suits who’d taken off the top to drink the black water coming from the sprinklers.

Allie stepped back. No one was attacking us yet, but she didn’t know what to make of it. Chances were that if we stepped out into that water, she’d lose herself completely.

“We’ll stick to the walls,” I whispered. “If we’re already infected, they shouldn’t attack us, right?”

“It’s not that simple,” Allie said, coughing. “There is a sort of SORE super-predator. Small harvesters, attacking other infected. There could be one out there.”

“Doesn’t look like it,” I said. “And we can’t stay here.”

“To hell with it,” she spat. “Let’s go.”

 

We stuck to the walls, as planned. We had to push our way past the infected. They were erratic and spontaneous; the slightest push could set them off. It was impossible to tell what they might do next. It was strange though, they were all moving in the same direction; as if they knew something instinctively. Could they know of a way out, collectively?

I held Allie’s hand and dragged her with me – but she was slowing down. After a while, she stopped moving completely. I turned back to look at her, and she just stood there, covered head to toe in black water. White strands rolled out of her mouth.

“Come on,” I said. “Allie, come on.”

She didn’t move. I didn’t see anything resembling recognition, or her understanding what I was saying. What remained of her attention had been shattered.

 

Someone to her right bumped into her, and Allie grabbed them by the neck. A maintenance worker. In a move that can only be described as practiced and intentional, she pulled the man close and pressed her neck against him. Seconds later, she pushed him away, pulling out what looked like a white blood clot. It sloshed onto her chest like a messy toddler’s dinner, before slurping back into an open hole in her neck.

There was an energy in her eyes. A hunger. A level of control that she found in that one act. And with that intention, she locked eyes with me.

She was a super-predator.

 

I ran. I ran like hell, and she followed me. All the while, she grabbed people along the way, tearing out their throats and eating their infection. She was much stronger than a normal person, and I could see her muscles bulge and tense, swelling to almost twice their original size. She didn’t have to stop to continue her rampage, and maybe there was something about me that she found irresistible.

I took a sharp left turn, going into a side tunnel. It was hot as hell – the steam pipes had burst wide open, and there was no ventilation down there. It felt like breathing scolding water. What remained of Allie sprinted with complete abandon, smacking her arms against the hollow pipes as she kept going. She was gaining on me.

I rounded a corner, and there was a door to my right. It opened outward, so I could hide behind it. I had an idea and hoped to God it would work.

 

I swung the door open and hid behind it. From Allie’s angle, it’d look like I’d run into that room. If I could trick her, I’d gain some time.

I heard her come around the corner, sniffing the air. She could smell me, but she wasn’t sure where I’d gone. Maybe the steam interfered. She went up to the door, poking her head against it. For a couple of seconds, she just stood there, wheezing. Like she was breathing through a whistling straw.

Then she entered the room.

 

I slammed the door shut, hoping Allie didn’t have the mental faculty to use the handle. Even if she did, I might earn enough time to get away. The moment that door clicked shut, Allie threw herself at it, making the hinges groan. How that thin woman could force that massive pressure onto the door was beyond me.

Those service tunnels were a labyrinth. There were no indicators of what lead where, and you could barely see ten feet ahead. If Allie didn’t get me, the suffocating air would. My lungs ached as I pressed forward, moving randomly from one tunnel to the next. I could barely keep my eyes open, and after a while I just kept them shut. I could feel the scolding pipes on my left, so as long as I kept them to my left I knew I was going the right way.

Then, I tripped.

 

There was a dead man in the way, and I’d tripped over him. I hit the ground hard, knocking the air out of my lungs. There was a short moment where my vision blackened, as I rolled onto my back and wheezed for air. Looking down the hall where I came from, I could see someone coming around the corner.

Allie had figured her way out and was still chasing me. I got a better view of her – she had this beer gut now, and her arms seemed longer. I could barely see her face anymore, on account of all the white strands poking out of her head. She was making this howling wail sound, like a grieving wolf. It pierced my ears, overpowering even the sound of puffing steam.

There was no way I could get up fast enough to get away. She’d find me any second. I had to do *something*.

 

I rolled over onto my stomach and held my breath. I heard her coming my way, wailing with every step. Within seconds, she was standing over me.

I think the dead body confused her. She couldn’t understand if I was living or dead. She bent down and poked the back of my head with her white little strands, as if to test me. One of the strands poked a hole in my skin, as if to see if I’d recoil. I bit down on my lip, hard, hoping she would just go away. I clutched the gun, getting ready.

There was a hesitation, but I think she figured she’d give it a try. She rose up, as if bracing herself, but then stopped. I managed to keep myself calm enough not to roll over and start firing at her. There were sounds coming from the other end of the corridor; a more immediate target. It was better to chase living prey. She ran down the corridor, huffing with every step. She sounded heavier.

 

I gasped for air and got up off the floor. I figured I might go back and start finding a way out through the main tunnels. There’d been trucks there, so there had to be an entrance big enough for them to get through. Then again, being out with the other infected was dangerous. Not only might Allie find me again, but there was a large chance that Hatchet personnel had started to clear the floors by now.

A thought struck me. A dumb thought, but a thought nonetheless. Allie might still be acting on some sort of instinctive desire, meaning she might be looking for a way out. She was still freshly infected, there might be parts of her that still had a want of their own. Either way, the safest place for me would be behind the predator – not in front of it, or to its side.

So I followed her, from afar.

 

It was easy to follow her lead. There were so many bodies along the way; most of them with torn-out throats or ripped-open chests. I counted at least 13.

I must’ve wandered around those tunnels for the better part of an hour. Maybe two. And finally, I stumbled upon a checkpoint. It’d already been overrun, and the doors were flung wide open. There were bloody spots on the numbered keypads – using the same six-digit code that Allie had shown me. But the final door had been toppled right over. She had not even attempted to open it properly.

When I finally made it outside, there was an eeriness to it. One moment I was standing in shrieking steam pipes, blaring alarms, and red emergency lights. The next moment, I was standing in a pine forest near an overgrown dirt road. From panic to serenity in five steps.

Somewhere out there, I could hear the echo of Allie’s wailing cry. It was growing more distant – disappearing into the woods.

 

But I wasn’t alone. There were a handful of SORE subjects out there, wandering off into the woods. Most of them looked harmless enough, mindlessly wandering back and forth. I could see Elizabeth Salinger among them, the young woman with the black pixie haircut. She looked just like the rest of them. My thoughts drifted back to her father, Adam. Would he want to see her like this?

There was a tinge of regret in me. Maybe I could’ve helped these people, if I’d stayed. Maybe this could all have been avoided. I didn’t even know who I was supposed to be angry at; myself, John, or Hank?

I heard gunfire in the distance. I was still holding on to Allie’s gun. Some part of me had wanted to take her out mercifully, but there was no way to know if a bullet would have stopped her.

Checking the magazine, I realized the gun was empty.

Of course. Allie had never used it. She’d just assumed it was loaded.

 

I made my way into the woods, in the opposite direction of Allie’s wailing. And I hoped against hope that I’d find my way back to civilization, one way or another.
