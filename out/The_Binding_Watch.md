I was fourteen years old that summer afternoon in 1972.  I was fishing in the small lagoon below ‘The Monkey Bridge’ with a few friends.  ‘The Monkey Bridge’ is simply three old, rusty pieces of cabling strung across two telephone poles with some scattered old wood every few feet, fastened with rusted bolts. One had to be either part monkey or part insane to attempt crossing such a rickety structure. This bridge hung, ominous, over the lagoon inlet, home to the best fishing along the winding river in my hometown.

I was hoping to hook into some serious action and pass another summer day free from chores and schoolwork. My third cast snagged some deep bottom weeds. After ten minutes of struggle, I was able to reel in about five pounds of muck, weeds and lagoon bottom. My friends enjoyed a good laugh at the large circle of crap I’d captured. I began the messy task of locating and freeing my favorite lure from this mess. In the midst of foraging through the gunk, my fingers found a solid round object. I tugged on it a bit and managed to pull the encrusted thing free. I rinsed it in the water and was surprised to see an old watch emerge from the filth. The timepiece was remarkably preserved but the leather belt loop was half rotted and soggy. The once polished chain was pitted and rust covered.  As my friends hooked into fish after fish, I continued to clean my treasure with a wet nap I had in my back pocket.

My friends glanced wide eyed at my treasure as I tucked it into my jeans and went back to fishing. We cast our lines for another hour but the fish stopped biting as suddenly as they started. The afternoon sun dipped below the tree line, casting long shadows across the black water. We packed our gear ready for the mile trek through the woods toward our neighborhood.  As we made our way through thick canopy of oak and elm forest the ground behind us crunched with faint footfalls. Nearby branches rustled with no errant breeze. On more than one occasion I’d glance back expecting to see a deer or some other woodland creature disturbed by our passing. My friends also peeked back every so often or they would glance up at the canopy of branches. We heard something, but none of us felt the need to share that observation. I’d never felt uncomfortable in the woods behind my house, but I was relieved to finally see the main trail heading back to our neighborhood.

After dinner, I showed my prize to my father and grandfather. My grandfather studied the watch, gray eyes squinted behind heavy glasses. He said the watch was made by a company back in 1871. He said these watches were carried by the upper class of that era. Gramps wound the mechanism, his jaw dropped; the watch began to tick, the second hand moving after several years buried in that lagoon. He took the watch to his bedroom and was gone for several minutes while I wolfed down my dessert. As I finished the last bite my grandfather presented me the watch with a new leather loop and silver carry chain.  He’d polished the timepiece and the glass casing, making it look almost as good as new. The metal had some tarnish and the glass still had a few deep scratches, but it was mine. I felt drawn to this timepiece, something old and valuable I’d rescued from oblivion with one cast of my fishing pole.  

That night I put the watch on my dresser and happily went to bed looking forward to more adventures with my friends. I don’t remember falling asleep; I was back at the lagoon, but it seemed different. The Monkey Bridge was there, only in much better shape. I was climbing the metal pegs in the large pole, carefully making my way to the top where thin wooden cross pieces formed the first part of the bridge. Unbridled waves of fear crashed through my body as I glanced down at the lagoon. Several of my friends shouted, encouraging me, at least I thought they were my friends. I scarcely recognized a single soul urging me out on that swinging bridge of horror. I tried to stop myself from stepping on that first cable. I couldn’t control my legs. My arm stretched for the nearest cable to pull myself up.

I placed my foot on the lower cable, the arrangement of wood and steel shimmied side to side like a rodeo bull. Both of my hands gripped the top cable, my knuckles white from such a firm clasp. I eased my way out over the lagoon, inch by inch, sliding each foot along a separate steel wire only finding a solid foothold where a section of old planking remained unbroken. A rhythmic thumping noise grew louder and faster. It was the sound of my beating heart, fueled to this frenzy by my own fear. I tried to turn around but had no control of my body, I kept inching forward until I was out in the middle of the lagoon. The bridge swayed and bowed under my weight, threatening to toss me like a man would do to an errant fly or mosquito. My eyes fell upon my watch. It looked brand new, not a scratch or mark on it. As I took my next step my right foot slipped, in my angst I lost my grip on the top cable and slipped. My head cracked on something as I fell backwards. My body plunged into the ice-cold water. The dark lagoon swallowed me into its murky depths. I tried to swim, force my limbs to move but they failed to respond. My limp body settled on the lagoon bottom, wet clothing clung, encasing me like a mummy. I came to rest on a sunken section of tree fall. My left wrist was entangled in a network of branches. “Swim, damn it!” I screamed in my head, but all I could feel was the icy cold water and the cold muck of the lagoon as it claimed me. The black water blanketed me, scorching my lungs as I inhaled the fetid liquid.

I awoke screaming in terror, my head shot from my pillow as if fired from a cannon. The dark lagoon water gave way to the darkness of my basement bedroom.  My head tingled and the hair on my arms and neck stood. Standing at the foot of my bed was a boy my age; he was reaching out to me. Vacant, hollow eyes studied me. I could see through his body! I opened my mouth to scream but nothing came out, a muted gasp of silent terror. The boy was reaching to me, pointing.

“Help me!”  

The words weren’t mine but came from my mouth. The voice wasn’t me either. I could smell the musty dank odor of Breyer’s lagoon, the scent of river water was all over my body, embedded in the very sweat pouring from me like a fountain. Something warm ran down my thighs. I’d just wet myself. The embarrassment of soiling myself shook off the terror. I felt the growing stain of pee on my pajamas, I blinked once and the boy was gone. In between shivers I managed to turn on my nightstand lamp dispersing the darkness with a 60-watt bulb. I glanced over at the dresser and saw my watch, shiny but worn. I reached over for my prized possession; the second hand had stopped and the time read 4:18. I stared at the glowing amber hands on my alarm clock; it was just before one in the morning. This can’t be right! The watch was working fine before I went to bed. The methodical ticking helped me drift off into slumber. How could it be reading this time now? Gentle ticking broke the silence. A fresh wave of goose bumps raced up my spine and down my arms. The hairs on the nape of my neck stood as I shivered. My watch now read 12:45 and was running again. What just happened?  Had I really seen someone in my room? Did the watch stop?

  “I must’ve still been dreaming.” I began the process of changing my underwear and pajama bottoms thanking fate that my mattress and bedding were dry.  The embarrassment of telling my mom I wet the bed would have been too much. I stared at the lamp from the comfort of my mattress wondering if the darkness would, again, summon the boy specter.

“It was a dream; it had to be just part of the dream.” My hand trembled reaching for the lamp cord, hesitating as my finger tips rested on the small string.  “A dream.” I pulled the cord. Darkness surrounded me.  I put my head on my pillow, curled up in a ball, and did my best to dismiss the terror as a simple nightmare from eating too much pepperoni pizza.  

I awoke early the next morning, last night’s episode forgotten. I had no luck fishing yesterday, but today would be different; I’d bring in a string of keepers. I ate my breakfast quickly and rushed to gather my fishing tackle. I walked the mile of woodland paths alarmed at the unusual silence. The normal background noise of birds, squirrels and grasshoppers was missing.  Through the silence a set of footsteps followed me, loud yet annoying and untraceable. The tingling and goose bumps soared through my body. I picked up a fair-sized rock and patted the fishing knife hanging off of my belt.

“If that’s you Mike, it’s not funny!” I shouted into the silent woods hoping my friend would materialize from behind one of the many large oak trees, laughing at my discomfort.

Silence was my only answer. I took several stealthy steps and was rewarded with more nothing.  I gave up and headed back for the lagoon. The comforting sound of birdsong and the annoying whine of horseflies returned. The annoying buzz around my head replaced the eerie silence. These flying pests became welcome company. I assumed a coyote was nearby looking for its breakfast and the large predator, so close, accounted for the eerie silence and the footsteps shadowing me. Obviously, I wasn’t a rabbit or deer so the canine quickly lost interest and moved on.  

I approached the lagoon, my eyes transfixed on the Monkey Bridge. I looked up at the rusted and weathered death trap recalling the vivid images from my dream. Some force compelled me to walk over to that large support pole. I found myself standing at the base of the main support post, looking thirty feet up at the wooden cross pieces. The rusted pegs invited me to ascend and embark upon the journey of my dream. Faint echoes of voices surrounded me urging me on, daring me to cross the lagoon. I reached for the first rusted peg. The voices around me grew louder, faint wisps of shapes darting back and forth compelled me. I placed my left foot on a peg and hefted myself off the ground. My other hand grasped a higher peg while my leg stretched upward and found a solid foothold. I slowly climbed to the top of the thirty-foot pole gazing up at the lower cross support of the Monkey Bridge, just as I had done in my dream. The wood was green with mold and I could see the visible rot engulfing the aged structure. Still, I reached up to the highest peg and pulled my body up the last five feet with one strong jerk.

A chill surrounded me, my breath a white vapor as I exhaled. It was mid-July, this kind of cold was impossible. He appeared from a mist; a boy my age standing directly in front of me. I looked again and he was transparent. I could see through his body as if he wasn’t really there. The whispers I heard were now clear, loud chants. I could see the other boys, just like in my dream. But these boys weren’t cheering; they were mocking him, daring him to do this foolish feat. The names they shouted were cruel and vile. His fear and shame coursed through me, pulsing in my veins, just like my dream.

  “No, don’t.” I whispered shaking my head. “You’ll fall in.”

The boy looked at me, his face filled with terror. He turned back toward the bridge and took a step out, then another step and another.

“Come back, you’ll fall! Please!” The phantom boy didn’t hear me. The bridge changed, as did the world around me. I was reliving my dream only I could have sworn I was awake! The bridge looked newer, as it had in my dream. The boys on the ground were no longer boys; they were dark specters, the denizens of gloom and despair. These phantasms were urging him on, playing on his ego, hoping he’d go on and fail. I shouted again, pleading with the boy to come back; one of the things on the ground looked up at me as if it saw me for the first time. It was then I saw its true form, blood red eyes, charcoal flesh and pearl white horns, it was something dark and foul, but to the boy on the bridge it was one of his so-called friends, urging him to his death. I shouted again for the boy to return and the dark beast hissed, a sound so evil and foul I trembled in fear. My arms wrapped around the pole, terrified hands clung to rusty pegs and cable, fingers pale white from my death grip, too terrified to move a muscle. 

I watched in horror as the boy slipped, as I had slipped in my dream. He fell backwards and his head slammed into one of the cross members. I watched, helpless, as his limp body slipped below the surface of the lagoon. The dark things laughed and giggled. Demonic cackles tore through my body sapping my strength and will. My stomach retched and turned. I felt myself vomiting uncontrollably clinging to the rotted pole. They danced together in a circle chanting and laughing a ghoulish cackle. My flesh trembled; my whole body shook with fear as I heaved the last of my breakfast. Before the poor boy was completely swallowed by the dark waters, I noticed the expensive silver watch clutched his right hand, it was the same watch I had looped around my pants, securely tucked in my pocket.  

I saw an image of another young boy crossing a fast-moving creek, on the opposite end of the rapid torrents of water, were these same two gremlins, urging the boy further and further into danger. The boy had a silver pocket watch, my watch. I was sickened as he slipped and his skull fractured against a nearby stone. The scene repeated over and over again, each time a different victim. How many lives had been claimed by this trinket? I was crying and praying these horrid visions would stop. This watch killed whoever was unlucky enough to find it and the watch always seemed to be found by another young boy, another innocent victim of these two things. I hadn’t been lucky to find this watch, I’d been cursed. I was the next in a line of boys to be claimed by these creatures. I hid my eyes for several seconds and the chill finally passed. I found the courage to look up. The woods were calm and tranquil. A sparrow chirped flying over the lagoon chasing a horsefly. The Monkey Bridge was back to being old, rusted and tattered. I looked down by my fishing gear and saw my pals Mike and Gary. I exhaled a great sigh of relief. Did they see the ghouls or the boy? I was desperate to seek comfort from my friends

“Go on ya big wussy, we know you’re afraid to cross it,” Gary shouted.

“You big wimp, go on!” Michael laughed a sick cackle rolling his eyes at me.  “You always were a coward!”

Shame washed over me, the words cut into my boyish pride. My muscles tensed forcing down the panic. A stubborn determination filled my body. I was no wimp. I could do this. I reached for the top cable with my right arm. The watch fell from my pocket glistening in the sunlight dangling from the heavy silver chain. The glare struck my eyes, blinding me for an instant. I opened my eyes, blinked a few times, as more emotion welled up inside me. Only a fool would try to cross this bridge, I didn’t want to do this. An unknown power was pushing me forward preying on my insecurity. I glanced down at my friends. They seemed different, they were different! They were the gremlins, fishing for their next victim and I was falling into their trap!  I closed my eyes forcing the voices out of my head.

“Go away!” I screamed with all of my remaining strength. “Leave me alone!”

I opened my eyes and forced myself to look at the shoreline. The gremlins were gone. I glanced down at the watch, it had stopped at 4:18. I knew that was the exact time of death of the boy who died here so many years ago. I managed to climb down the pole without incident unsheathing my fishing knife, not really knowing what a tiny blade could do against such creatures. I looked back up at the Monkey Bridge and I could see the shadowy specter of the boy that fell to his death, he looked down at me. His expression was one of grief and sorrow. That poor boy’s spirit was chained to this spot, and bound to the watch that hung from my belt loop. How many lives had this watch had claimed? How many unwilling innocent victims were tricked into terrible deaths? I was next on the list. I wanted to fling the watch back into the lagoon and part with it forever. Would throwing it away would help me now? Had I been chosen just by freeing the cursed thing?

What could I do, who could I tell? No one would believe my tale. I arrived home and saw my grandfather, the old man knew something was wrong, I never came home early in the summer unless it was raining or I’d gotten into trouble. He asked what I’d done wrong, assuming the worst. I started crying, I don’t know why, I just couldn’t stop myself. I told him of the terrors I’d witnessed perched thirty plus feet up on that pole of the Monkey Bridge. My grandfather held me as I purged my grief and he studied the watch he’d so meticulously restored. The time still read 4:18. He motioned for me to follow him into his room; he took the worn rotted strapping and rusty links he’d removed yesterday and placed the fragments in a cloth bag along with the watch.  

He sat down in his rocker and told me a story of a boy my age named Timothy. Timothy came from a wealthy family and would have worn a watch like the one I found. The boy drowned in Breyer’s lagoon over thirty years ago; his death was a very big mystery. My grandfather got up and gestured for me to follow him. We went to the local library and he began wading through several pieces of microfiche that contained years of newspaper archives. He called me over and pointed to a particular picture; it was the cover of a society page of the Sunday Globe. I saw an extravagant family portrait of people that radiated wealth and high society, I recognized the boy from my dream and earlier that day.

“That’s him! The boy from the bridge and my room.” My flesh crawled as I spotted the watch he was holding. Gramps nodded. He looked through a few more papers and then motioned me along to another library aisle. He told me to wait while he thumbed through a dusty old book.

“Come here.” Gramps motioned toward me as he placed the large book on a table. “Is this what you saw at the lagoon?” 

I followed his pointed finger to the large yellowed page.  There were the two ghouls, drawn in black ink performing that same horrid dance over the hastily sketched body of a soldier. My skin crawled and I shivered just looking at the picture. I held my Gramps, shaking.

“Yes.” tears of fear streamed down my cheek. This was really happening, monsters did exist.

Gramps slammed the book shut, his face grimaced and seemed set in stone. 

“What are they, Gramps? You act like you know them personally?”

He shook his head, “No son, not personally. I’ve seen them in war after particularly gruesome battles, they’ve fooled some soldiers into getting themselves shot up. We were warned about them, but nothing prepares you for that kind of encounter.” Gramps’ hand balled into a fist, “So this is what they do in between wars for kicks.” Gramps eyes narrowed.

“I don’t wanna die Gramps.  What am I gonna do?" 

“You’re not going to anything but what I tell you. I’m going to put young Master Burns and countless other souls to rest and end this string of torment, hopefully.” 

We climbed back into his car and made a forty-minute drive to a remote cemetery.

“What are we doing here?” My voice was barely a whisper, strangled by my own fear.

Gramps bent over and looked directly into my eyes. “I need you to be very brave right now and do exactly as I tell you. Can you do that, son?”

I swallowed hard and nodded. I followed my grandfather as he walked toward a rather large headstone.  The name ‘Burns’ was etched on the marker. The temperature dropped noticeably as we approached.

“Talk to him, he’ll hear you and be compelled to come. The watch binds you to him and the other victims.”

I didn’t know what to say to a dead person and I simply looked at the grave.

“There’s not much time, hurry,” he urged.

“Tim,” I whispered, “I’m so sorry. You didn’t deserve to die that way. I hope you can finally rest after Gramps does whatever it is he’s going to do.”

A chilling wind struck us as I finished. We were being watched. Two dark shadows hovered in the distance. My grandfather saw them but there was no fear in him, he seemed made of the strongest steel at this moment. I could hear those vile things talking to him, threatening him with untold torments and horrors. Gramps never flinched or wavered, he shot the ghouls a look that even to this day I’ll never forget, the look of a man protecting his grandson, a mighty lion protecting his pride; the look of love and compassion against the face of evil. 

“You chose wrong this time. You can’t have my grandson! Tell the devil I sent you!” His voice was loud and powerful, it echoed off the gravestones trumpeting over the threats and hisses. Gramps looked over at me and smiled, his total lack of fear gave me strength. I watched spell bound as he took out the small cloth sack that contained the watch and the original loop and chain. “Go back to Hell!” Gramps smashed the object against the granite headstone. A moaning wail that must have echoed for miles shattered the silent cemetery; the two dark shadows withered and melting away; their screams of despair echoing behind them.

 He doused the sack with lighter fluid and set it ablaze. The flames were a sick unearthly hue of red and purple; the watch fragments hissed angrily as they were consumed. My grandfather whispered a silent blessing over the flames and they seemed to waiver and then burn more like a natural fire. After five brief minutes the flames sputtered and died. I stared, stunned, as he buried the watch ashes and charred fragments next to the grave.  

“Rest now, Master Timothy, be with God.” he whispered struggling to his feet.

 We both looked up and saw his essence, along other boys, approach a glowing vortex. Timothy turned toward my grandfather and me and smiled. We simply waved back and watched him pass on to his final resting place. I looked at my grandfather with a sense of pride and awe. My dad told me stories about him before he moved in with us, how he’d been through two wars and about how brave and courageous he was. I saw the medals and ribbons on his dresser but never understood their meaning. I never saw that part of him until today, I just knew ‘Gramps’ as the silent man who moved in with us last year, not the hero of two wars or the twenty-year beat cop. I don’t know what I would have done without him there to help me. I looked up at him amazed at his courage and iron will. He’d stared down the face of evil and mocked the denizens of darkness as they threatened his very life.

“Is it over Gramps?  Are they really gone?” I leaned into him trying to stop my trembling.

He looked down at me gently placing his hand on my shoulder, “For you and I, yes, it’s over,” he pointed toward the car. “But the war goes on, young man.” Gramps sighed, his face was sad for a second as we walked together, “The war always rages on.”

I’m an old man now, a veteran of two wars plus multiple ‘Police Actions’ and a proud grandfather of a fine young boy. I too live with my son in a small corner bedroom of his house. I am the silent old man. I keep a constant vigil hoping the boy never brings home any strange objects and I always let him bend my ear for any reason. I realized during my first taste of combat, there were more gremlins in the world, I’ve fought them on the battlefield as they stole the lives of both friend and foe. Evil doesn’t care about a moral cause or mortal conflict. Evil only cares about killing, indifferent to what uniform you wear. 

We live in an age of scientific marvels. Computers and phones accomplish things I’ve never imagined possible. Within this technology evil found a home. Boys aren’t drawn to shiny watches anymore; they’re drawn to the dark web and the cyber underworld. In this age of newfangled technology, evil comes in several appealing packages. Only those who’ve experienced the horror of war know about the soul gremlins and we don’t speak of it, even amongst ourselves. We’re old men who watch in silence, as my grandfather did so many years ago. Darkness never rests or sleeps, not when there are so many victims ripe for the taking. The war rages on, not fought on a battlefield but waged though a computer or handheld device. The prize is still the same, the souls of the innocent, but the tactics are far more subtle and perverse. In this age of expanding darkness all I can do is stand fast and be a beacon of light for my grandson. That’s all any man can do, be a beacon of light and hope, serve as an example of good and pray that our kids avoid the gilded cyber net cast into the electronic ocean. The war rages on, always.
