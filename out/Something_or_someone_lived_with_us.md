I moved into an apartment a year ago. Back of it had a storage building which looked abandoned or like it was hardly used. It's walls were very close to my apartment windows and even closer to one of my balcony which was at the back side of my apartment. It was a 3BHK apartment. Windows of 2 bedrooms, kitchen and 1 balcony faced that storage room. It had a depressing vibe to it but I didn't think much into it initially. I started living there and didn't mind it all that much at start but gradually I started to notice things. Everyone in my family  always felt uneasy and on the edge in that apartment. 1 of my dog used to sit and howl for hours without any reason. He has never done that in the house where we lived previously or in the apartment that I moved in later on. He would also look spooked most of the times as if he was being vary and careful of something.

 My friend who used to come over to my house told me that he felt uneasy in this apartment as well. He'd feel scared in sleeping alone and said he felt like he's being watched whilst he was over. One of my family members felt like they saw a small dark figure, approximately 4 feet tall with bright white eyes peeping from the door which was ajar, during midnight. They felt it for a split second but when their eyes locked, it wasn't there in plain sight. Personally, I'm not someone who's easily scared but in that apartment, I always felt uneasy as well. If I used to lay down at night with my back facing the window which faced that storage, I'd feel a need to turn over and look outside the window just to be sure that everything's alright. I felt watched. 

During the monsoon season, that apartment got infested with what I believe was, blackmold. It was a really bad infestation. Awful smell, respiratory issues, etc. We barely survived the monsoon with lots and lots and lots of dehumidifiers. It was as if, there was no positive side to that apartment. As if it was infested with some negative energy. 

My family and I have been on good terms. In that apartment though, all of us had huge fights. We said things to each other which we normally never would have. We don't know why we went to that extent, it's like as if, we didn't have a control over ourselves. 
My relationship with my partner also got affected a lot. Fights, unpleasant conversations, etc. Somehow, they always got even worse whenever I was sitting outside of that balcony which faced the storage building. It's as if, something was trying for me to break up with my partner. I've never believed in superstitions and stuffs but living there made me question a lot of things. 


In that apartment, it felt weird even during the day time, not just at night, however, it did get worse at night. I forgot to mention but my room was worst out of all the rooms. Since the day we moved in there, my family didn't want to sit there because it felt very lifeless. I felt the same. It's hard to explain but when you live somewhere, you feel colours, positive energy and life at that place. For example, if a couple gets married and moves in to a new house, they start their journey there, they have kids, watch them grow, etc. There's life to that house and colours to it. Somehow, my apartment felt very very lifeless and as if all the colours have been sucked out of there. It felt so dry.

There also were poltergeist activities in this apartment but we never paid attention to them cause we thought it's probably just our dogs. However, some of them made it obvious that it wasn't our dogs. I'd give an example of such an incident; it was around 6AM and I heard a loud thud of a door being shut. I could tell by the location of the sound that it was the door of the washroom which was in the alleyway, outside of my room, a little diagnol to it. I checked on my family and everyone was asleep. So was one of my dog. My other dog was in my room with me when that loud thud happened. 

Either way, my dogs can't pull a door and shut it with so much force. When I was out checking this thing, my dog tagged along with me in the alleyway. He looked scared and kept peeping in the bedroom which was next to mine and he kept staring at the corner of the room while being scared. Just after that, I walked to the sofa in the hallway and sat on it's handle and my dog quickly jumped on the sofa and started licking my arm while peeping in the alleyway. I've a video of this incident too but it felt way too personal to share this here. 

Anyway, my whole family, my partner, my friend, we all agreed that there was something very negative in this house and obviously, blackmold is a health hazard so we wouldn't have stayed there either way, so we moved from there. Everything is way better now. My dogs are back to being normal. They never houl without any reason, this apartment has life to it and there aren't any fights now either. Everything is better but it still doesn't feel the same though. I feel something vaguely got attached to me from the previous house. It's not extreme like earlier. Infact, it's very faint, but, perhaps something.
