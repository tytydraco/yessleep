In fact, I would never make sure to share something like this. I quit all social media due to the harsh conditions I used it in the last 3 years. I only use this account, which I opened a month ago, to read the news. But if they are alive, if I don't announce it to someone, the consequences will be very bad. (I'm sorry you'll be upset if you guys read it all.)


First of all, it's a real event. The biggest trauma of my life. I will explain my experience in easy language so that we can understand it in the best way. Therefore, this is my only warning to the reader. My name is Mike and this thing started in California in 2018


The year 2018 was the first time I realized that something was wrong in the house we had just moved into with my wife. I knew there was a problem as my wife frequently went to the toilet at night and the data did not come back for at least 3 or 4 hours. I will not give my wife name. We got married in 2010


And I'm currently living separately from my wife. Now you're wondering, "Did I go crazy or was what happened just nonsense?" I'm tired of asking questions myself in my way. Please read seriously. One night, while my wife was there again, she get up and went to the toilet. I was ready the day before so I wouldn't be a sleepy idiot this time. As I said, I decided that my wife was gone. She was talking to someone on the phone. It was in full view, but it was a conversation like this.


"- I can't take it anymore, Mark. I don't want to talk to Mike. He doesn't deserve this. He'll put Mike life in danger."


Unfortunately, I couldn't hear what my wife was saying properly. Since it's been a long time, this is all I remember right now. At that moment, I secretly thought that my wife was making plans to leave me. And... this guy Mark. I've never heard of this damn guy before. I never imagined that my wife would cheat on me. And instead of being a cowardly freak, I was going to wait for my wife to come out of the bathroom and talk to her. At that moment, my wife say the man on the phone: 


"- Please leave me alone." 


Look, I've relied too much on my 6th sense my whole life. But for the first time, I was relieved by the fact that I might be wrong. And as expected, thanks to my momentary clumsiness, I touched my body to the toilet door. There was a rubbing sound. I realized that my wife immediately hang up the phone. 


"- Mike? I'm sorry, honey. I wish you had let me know you were awake."


Her voice was shaky. Without further delay, I asked my wife who she was talking to. And she answered calmly in a way that frightened me. 


"- A friend of mine called. Why did you ask?"


Who could call a married woman at 3 am? And a man. While I was trying to put all these thoughts in my head, my wife opened the toilet door. 


"-Are you okay, Mike?"


 Actually, I didn't really expect this question at that moment. I was stunned, but soon my wife said something else, as I recall. 


"- I was talking to my friend, there is nothing to worry about." 


Look, never forget these two sentences, our topic will return to these two sentences many times. I will never forget my wife's reaction when I asked her who that man was. My wife first squinted her eyes and looked at my face as if she was trying to remember something. A few seconds later he smiled. 


"- Honey, His name is Mark."


Believe me, I don't remember this sentence at all. The only thing left on my mind. This damn stranger was a new employee at my wife's workplace. Look, I've been a paranoid person my whole life. And to be honest, the fact that this man called my wife at this time of the night and talked about my life was enough to make me both shit myself and want to beat that man worse than beating him. When I asked my wife what I didn't deserve, why my life was in danger, and whether that man was bothering her, I received an answer that made my blood freeze. I remember it like it was yesterday.


 "- I don't want you to die."


Yes, that's exactly what she told me. And according to what she said, there was someone after me. I think he's a criminal or something. I didn't know who put these damn things after me or what these men wanted. I'm beyond me, what did they want from my wife? The only reason I can write calmly right now is because of antidepressants. Every time I talk about this my heart tightens until it's stuck.


Anyway. The house that my wife and I bought to start a family as a result of years of work was once a villa-like place where rich businessmen of the United States stayed. And we bought it because of its cheap price. I would never have thought in 40 years that it could end up like this.I talked about this issue with my wife for months. And I made her leave. I also made sure that the damn guy named Mark never called my wife again. Everything should be beautiful. For 1 year only.


We were in quarantine when the virus just broke out. When I turned to look outside at a random time, I saw someone. We were looking towards our house. Even though I thought it was a homeless person, I saw that man 4 times in the same place, 1 week apart. One day, while I was doing my personal business at home, there was a knock at the door.


The f*cking as*hole I thought was homeless. But it was Mark. He entered the house with a gun in his hand. Before I could call the police, he pointed the gun at me. Luckily a neighbor called the police to do this. While I was held hostage for about 15 minutes, I was hit many times with the back of his gun. I thank God every day that I didn't get hit in the head and have a brain hemorrhage.


When I opened my eyes. It was learned that Mark was tried to be arrested by the police and he was neutralized with a gun to get him out with difficulty. I will never be able to feel the shock of that moment like I did that day. Mark was in love with my wife from the beginning. and my wife hide this from me. I was Mark's biggest enemy.


But Mark was released years later. And I know Mark still after me. And because of the events, my wifes family forced her to live away from me in order to preserve the reunion. I can't argue against this because they were true. I think I have more or less explained the extent of the trauma contained in all this content. I change where I live at least twice a year. Because I know.


He's watching me. He will come for me. If that day is yet to come or if it is almost there, I wanted to write this on reddit, the only application I love and use, so that I can leave a mark in history. How many people can read this information? Know the value of your single life. How many people could walk around with the fact that someone was after them? What if this person wants to kill you? Thank you for your partnership in my trauma, and I'm sorry if I upset you with this article. I wish you a good life... 


Everyone you meet on the street is a potential psychopath. If nothing happens to me, I will send you a second long message.
