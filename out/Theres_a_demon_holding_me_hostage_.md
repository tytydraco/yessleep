I'm stuck in my room.. I don't know how to get out. 

Earlier today.. it all escalated so quickly. 

"Drink." The mug clanked on the table, small drops of black liquid spilling out and across the pale skin of the woman standing across from me.  "Coffee..?" I asked softly, my eyes flipping between her and the beverage. "Yes. Coffee." She barked out, motioning towards the mug and then scooting it closer to me. "Mom says-" I stopped short, her eyes lit with a fire deep inside. She wasn't happy with my protest. "Okay." I whimpered, grabbing the mug and taking a drink, the hot liquid rolling down my throat. "Can I go use the bathroom?" Pondering, the woman stared me down and I lowered my head, waiting for the release as she finally said yes and I jumped up, probably a little too quickly. The bathroom door creaked and groaned as I opened and closed it behind me, turning the lock on the knob before looking in the mirror. My eyes drifted to the little sticker in the bottom right corner of the mirror. Cayla's 10th birthday! in big letters decorated that corner, that day had been a fantastic day. 

Two years ago, nearly to the day, and it hadn't gotten anything but worse since then. I slipped out of my shirt, watching as two black and furry wings flopped out, raising up slightly and resting in a half open position. They budged when I strained, slightly moving up and down no more than a couple inches, but they were moving more and more each day. The cabinet to the left of the mirror stared me down, I knew I wasn't supposed to be in it, I knew what was in it, but yet I still had the urge. My hand reac out, the knock cold on my fingertips and a heavy knock startled me back. 

"Are you done yet?" aggression was clear, and it startled me some but I choked back a response of not yet. A groan and a huff later I heard heavy footsteps receding, back to the kitchen I assumed. My eyes hit the floor, I couldn't do this much longer. Mom and Dad don't know what's going on and they're away right now, they have no clue. This demon has me strapped in my home, the coffee she keeps fueling me with is only making my wings grow faster, larger, healthier. It helps, sure, but it gives her the option of controlling me. Once I have consumed enough of her liquid, I'm hers to keep for eternity. Mom thought she was hiring a reputable babysitter, but it's clear she didn't. The door splintered, the woman's hand stuck through the door before I could do anything, unlocked the knob and slammed open the door. 

"You're done, now!" she yelled, her teeth sharpened up and her face distorted. I started crying, running beside her and up to my room, locking the door behind me and shoving my dresser up against the door. 

It's been five hours now, she's still beating on the door yelling at me to let her in, I don't know how much longer my parents are going to be and I don't know how much longer the spell will hold. The door, although it's enchanted, is still only a door and with every passing minute it seems to get weaker and weaker, I fear that this might be the end..
