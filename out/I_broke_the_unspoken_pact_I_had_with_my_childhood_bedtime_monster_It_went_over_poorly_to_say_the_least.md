I looked around my old bedroom and put my bags down with a resigned sigh. Other than the stairmaster my mom had put in the corner where my desk used to be, it remained almost entirely untouched from how it was when I left for college. It was comforting in a way, like stepping into an old pair of shoes. I still couldn't help feeling a tinge of embarrassment at moving back in with my mom in my thirties, even knowing times are tough and thousands of people are cohabitating with parents again after being on their own, it does sting to lose that sense of independence.

After a whirlwind week, my whole life came crashing down around me. Seven days ago exactly, my fiance sat me down and told me we were through, he wasn't in love with me anymore and wanted to move on. He gave me a week to pack and plan and get out. Ten years of my life, gone like that. The lease was in his name, the good car was in mine. I got the sofa. I stared at my lumpy old mattress. He got the bed.

My mom came up and asked if I wanted to go grab a bite to eat. I felt like my stomach had been replaced with a medicine ball, but I didn't want her to worry seeing me not eat all day, so I acquiesced and we walked down the hall together.  

It was ten o'clock that first night home when I went to bed. The bedframe squeaked lightly when I flopped down, mentally and physically exhausted. I flicked off the lamp on my nightstand, ready for the sweet miniature embrace of death that sleep provides. A wash of bright white LED light illuminated the wall opposite the window. That was new. They must have put in a new street lamp between now and then. Light blocking curtains went up to the top of my priority list in the morning.  

Just as I was drifting off, I felt ùò™ùòµ.  

A flood of memories, long forgotten, came crashing over me. Countless terrified nights throughout my childhood rushed to the forefront of my mind. We moved here the summer I turned eight. The very first night, I felt ùò™ùòµ; a presence, an intense feeling of being watched, fear and the promise of pain. There was always an unspoken understanding made between ùò™ùòµ and myself, whatever I do, do not open my eyes when ùò™ùòµ was present. I would be safe as long as I kept my eyes closed and pretended to be asleep.  

Every night for years, I appeared to be sleeping soundly as a babe, while my headspace racked with a primal fear. Heart pounding, desperately trying to regulate my horrified gasps into a facsimile of the steady slow breaths of a normal sleeping human. At some point, it almost always showed up. For having never seen it, my imagination could provide enough concepts to horrify me, an inky black shadow slinking along the walls, creeping up next to my vulnerable sleeping form.  

I was terrified of it touching me, I wrapped up as much as possible, sleeping with the blankets tucked tight around my chin. I couldn't sleep with the blankets over my head, even though I craved the coverage. That went against our unspoken agreement. Covering my face wasn't how I naturally slept and it would know.
  
That's how I went to sleep for close to a decade until I escaped to college. Even as I grew more emboldened in my teen years and dared to lay with a leg hanging out from under the blanket, I still always kept my eyes shut when I could feel the presence in my room.  

Flash forward to me now, feeling this creepy shit all over again, something I had managed to completely forget about. Instinctively, I tucked the blankets up as high as I could around my head (while looking natural) and pretended to sleep. I stayed like that for a moment and then I began to feel silly.  

I was an eight year old little girl when I first felt that. I was in a new room in a new house. It was dark and I was a scaredy cat by nature. I had nightmares after watching Home Alone (I would dream my parents forgot me at home and all of my booby traps failed and Joe Pesci shot me in the chest), of course my imagination had conjured up some sort of Boogie Man!  

"Fuck this," I thought, "this shit had me so scared my whole childhood, I owe it to my younger self to be brave."  

So I opened my eyes.  

Big mistake.  

There was something in my room, standing right next to the bed, illuminated by the silvery light from the street. Its features were fuzzy. It kind of looked like me, but like a blurred photograph negative of me. My eyes struggled with the lighting, I couldn't tell if its skin was gray or blue. Before I could process or even respond, it loomed over me and smiled, showing me a wide mouth filled with obsidian teeth. Reaching out it touched my forehead.  

I was suddenly laying supine when I had been on my side. I tried to turn over and realized I couldn't move. That thing was still standing over me, smiling its horrible inky grin. I was terrified, but I suddenly felt a sense of relief wash over me.  

Sweet merciful Jesus, I was having sleep paralysis. I was fine and just had to try to go back to sleep.  
I closed my eyes.  

Then I felt cold fingers on my lips and another set of cold fingers squeezing my cheeks so my mouth popped open. This felt really real for sleep paralysis.  

I tried to keep my cool.  

Fingers began probing into my mouth.  

Just breathe. It's sleep paralysis.  

Fingers locked on one of my teeth, my upper left cuspid. Vice like grip, pressure began to be applied.  
Genuine panic bubbling through me. This has to be sleep paralysis.  

The pressure increased. It hurt so badly. I tried to scream, bur all that got out was a whispery moan. My arms were dead weights, unable to push it away.
  
The pressure increased, still. Pain quickly shifted into pure agony as I heard the roots of my tooth beginning to shift and crack from my head.  

More pressure. With a horrible crunching sound that reverberated through my skull, my poor tooth was wrenched out of my mouth. I struggled to scream, desperate to scream. That was the worst pain I'd ever felt and my body was insistent I try to verbalize it.  
 
The monster smiled, quite pleased with itself, and tucked my tooth somewhere on its belonging. I could taste the blood, but my tongue struggled to move itself to investigate the new hole in its surroundings.
  
I watched in a kind of stupor as it then reached into its own mouth and swiftly pulled a black tooth free from its silvery gums with a brittle cracking noise. Still smiling, it bent back over me and pried my mouth open with one hand and inserted the black tooth into the raw gum wound that had once housed a very fine incisor.  

Having a tooth put back in was worse than having one ripped out. It felt like poking a finger into floral foam, but in my bone, a sensation I could feel and hear. Pain radiated in a straight line from my gums through my head, sharp and bright. My eyesight dimmed around the edges and the horrible grinning face over me fell out of focus.   

I passed out.  

I woke up the next morning and immediately thought about that wild ass sleep paralysis I had had the night before. I must have had a tooth get infected or had a migraine in my jaw last night while experiencing sleep paralysis. I'd heard of people getting headaches so bad they thought they were dying.  

I was in no pain now, but I felt an urgent need to inspect my tooth and rushed to the bathroom‚Ä¶   

Blood. The mirror revealed to me blood, rusty brown, dried and flaking all around my mouth. My bowels turned to liquid, a cold rush from my diaphragm straight down. My feet moved me closer to the mirror, despite the sudden numbness in my extremities.
  
I started weeping before I even open my mouth. I knew what I was going to find, but I had to see it. With shaking hands, I lifted my lip and saw that grotesque black tooth, dark as jet. Other than the color, it looked just like my old tooth. It felt normal to my tongue. Tentatively, I raised a hand to my mouth and poked it gently. It felt firm.  

I pinched it between my thumb and forefinger and wiggled it as aggressively as a child working on a loose baby tooth. Solid. Maybe even more solid than the original.  

I brushed my teeth and washed the blood off my face while silently freaking out. I went to work wearing a face mask and claimed a head cold to my coworkers. I called my dentist the second her office opened to schedule an emergency appointment, blessing silently whoever canceled their afternoon root canal leaving an opening.  

In my head the dentist would tell me a cavity had rotted out from behind, I've seen people with black teeth before, but I didn't think it happened overnight. I felt sure she would know something. In reality, Dr. Klepper had no idea what had happened to it. She took X-rays, which looked healthy and normal, hardly changed compared to the ones taken last year.  

She poked. She prodded. She could find nothing structurally wrong with it. I begged her to pull it out. I'd rather be missing a tooth than have this. She acquiesced and had the dental assistant prepare the tools while she searched for similar cases. Her research did not bring up anything and was as much a mystery to her as it was to I, although she didn't have the full story, I had omitted the part about a Boogie Man from my childhood doing this in the story I told her. As far as she knows I just woke up like this.  

I'm normally a baby about getting novacaine shots, but after what I had endured last night, it felt like nothing. When I was numbed up, she took the pliers and started pulling, and there was nothing. She applied more force. More force. The tooth resisted. It soon felt like my actual bone was going to be cracked and ripped out if she kept going.  

I tapped out. Dr. Klepper looked perplexed by that tooth. That cuspid was rock solid and unlikely to go anywhere without extensive dental surgery. I went back to my mom's and ugly cried with my numb lips, drooling like a baby.  

Too freaked out to sleep in my bedroom that night, I chose to sleep on the couch. I'd never felt the presence anywhere but in my room and I thought it might have a connection to something in that space.  
Whatever it was to initially have a connection with, it had switched to me after that first tooth. I awoke in the night with cold fingers prying into my mouth while I was paralyzed and helpless to stop it. Tears poured down the sides of my face as it repeated the same gruesome ritual as it had the night before; ripping a tooth out with brutal efficiency and replacing it with an obsidian doppelganger procured from its horrible mouth. Second molar on the top right.   

The pain was insane. I blacked out again.  

This went on for weeks. I was so afraid to sleep at night, and I was no longer capable of sleeping during the day. I tried sleeping in hotel rooms, it found me. I tried camping deep in the woods and lost another tooth. I drove for a day straight and slept at a truck stop in Iowa and woke up the next morning, short another original tooth. I tried scheduling a sleep study, but they were booked out for months. I did the math and at this rate, I'd be out of teeth long before the appointment. Searches online brought up nothing, not even an ancient thread with long dead links sharing experiences with this monster.  

I begged my mother to keep guard over me while I slept. That night I watched it appear behind the chair she was reading in. Before I could warn her, it reached a creepy silver finger over my mother's head, tapping her forehead. Her chin fell to her chest, the book slid onto the floor. It was at my side with disarming speed. She gently snored while the thing separated another tooth from my aching gums.  

My life was truly falling apart and I was struggling. Panic attacks were nearly daily now. The breakup, earth shattering to me just a few weeks ago, felt inconsequential now. I was so scared to go to bed, but no matter how hard I tried, I would eventually give in to Mr. Sandman and betray myself with sleep. Lateral incisors, premolars, first molars‚Ä¶ one by one, they fell, and my mouth looked more and more like a game of chess that black was winning.  

Last week, I was riding the bus (I didn't trust myself enough to drive anymore) and had forgotten my face mask that day. I was so self conscious of my teeth at this point, I rarely smiled or talked anymore, but that day, watching a funny gif on my phone, I burst out laughing and smiled. Clapping a hand over my mouth, I hoped no one had seen my teeth, but at least one person had.  

A guy who had been sitting across from me on the bus also got out at my stop. The fastest way to get to my mother's was cutting through the park, it was large, a couple acres, and had wooded areas. It was broad daylight and I didn't notice the man from the bus following at first, but he began catching up to me. I moved over to the side of the path to let him pass me, instead, he forcefully grabbed my shoulder and spun me around.  

"That thing with the teeth, you seen it before, does it come at night?" he asked. While he was talking, I noticed how tired and haggard he looked, a scruffy beard forming on his jaw, glassy eyes with purple bags underneath. Wafts of alcohol from his breath washed over me. He also had a mouthful of black teeth with a shining pearl of a remaining human tooth. His right canine.  

I was honestly stunned and surprised, I stammered for a second, we were in a copse of trees and out of sight of everyone else.   

"Hey! I asked a question! It ain't hard. You seen that thing? It takes your teeth?" His voice raised in tone the whole time he was talking, slurring his words slightly, "too good to talk to me, stupid bitch? Just show me your teeth!"  

Hands grabbed for my face before I could process what was happening. It escalated at a terrifying rate. I reached out to his shoulders to stop him from getting closer, but he still grabbed for my mouth. We began tussling and fell to the ground. He was on top of me.
  
"Show me your teeth!" He yelled as his hands frantically scratched and probed trying to get my lips open, I was thrashing my head from side to side, lips pursed shut, "show me your teeth! Show me your teeth! Show me your fuckin' teeth!"  

Flailing my hands through the dirt and leaves, I found something solid with my left hand, a rock, and hit him in the face with it as hard as I could. He stopped mid yell and was visibly dazed, falling off me into the dirt. Blood pooled around his mouth and something a few inches away caught my eye.  

A white canine.  

I don't know why, I grabbed his tooth as I scrambled up out of the dirt and ran as fast as I could while he was still stupefied. I didn't stop running until I got home. My hands were shaking with adrenaline from the encounter as I opened my hand and saw the tooth. What the actual fuck was wrong with me? Why did I take that crazy guy's tooth?  

That happened over a week ago and the monster kept showing up almost every night, playing its methodical game of tooth swap with me.  

I am down to my last tooth now, my right canine. I am so afraid of what the end game is going to be. I'm afraid I will die, or even worse, I'm beginning to worry I might turn into one of those things myself. Honestly, I don't know what to expect. Exhaustion has me thinking irrationally.  

It will come, either tonight or tomorrow, to take my final tooth. On my nightstand, I have placed that guy's canine as an offering, it's the same tooth it has yet to collect from me. It almost feels silly thinking I could dupe a paranormal being of horrific power, but it's my Hail Mary pass. I'm so very tired. I'm tired of running. I'm about to lie down and go to sleep. Hopefully I get to wake up in the morning, but I'm honestly at peace if I don't.   

However this turns out, for my sake folks, please remember to not be brave and to keep your fucking eyes closed while in the presence of monsters.
