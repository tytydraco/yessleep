[Part Two: Tradition vs Truth]

A lot of nothing happened after S disappeared.

People move on when the missing girl is Native. Especially when she’s poor. Especially when the cops don’t even know how to pronounce her name.

Some of the kids in our town believed it was the Little People of legend. Some of the older folks did too, though they wouldn’t say it out loud.

Can you believe it? A fairytale…

My sister is gone and people are blaming the boogeyman.

T believed it. Fully. Said he felt it that night, a kind of humming in the walls. Said he saw something in the dark that wasn’t us. He didn’t say it at the time because he didn’t want to believe it. But now, it’s all he can think about.
I thought it was guilt. We thought it was just another game. Why listen to folktales? Why listen to some made-up story from centuries past?

I told myself it was someone. A man. A stranger who knew we went into those caves and waited. That’s what makes the most sense. That’s what I still believe. That it was a crime. Something human and cruel…

T coped by leaning into tradition. I coped by running from it.

He stayed. I left. Went to school. Got a job in another state. Got away. Or so I thought.

I hadn’t been home in almost thirteen years.

T called me every year. Every birthday. Every Christmas. Every holiday, without fail.

At first, I answered. He’d ask me how the city was treating me, if I was eating, if I had found someone.

“Fine.” “Mostly.” “No.”

I’d answer with only one-word responses, just to get through the call. Just to get him off the phone as soon as possible.

Sometimes he’d ask: “When are you coming home?”

I never had an answer.

Eventually, we stopped talking.
Not because he stopped calling, but because I stopped answering.

I told myself it was easier that way. That he’d move on. That I’d only be stuck if I held on to that place.

I told myself a lot of things.

And so we hadn’t seen each other in years.

Life has a way of pulling family apart, even when you think it never could. T stayed home. I didn’t. I left for school, work, cities that didn’t know my name or my family’s stories. I told myself I left for something better. I think T stayed to make something better out of what was already there. I heard he even tried opening a car lot. He was always good with a wrench…

The only reason I came back was because she died.

Our grandmother. The woman who raised us like we were her own. The one who braided S’s hair every morning before school. Who told us stories about the land, “not to entertain, but to warn.” She used to say that our people didn’t write down history because the land remembered for us.

The funeral was held behind Grandma’s old house. Her chair was still there — the one with the turquoise cushion, facing south toward the hills. They buried her with a pouch of tobacco and an old rosary, because that’s the way she wanted it: a little tradition from both sides, just in case.

I stood at the edge of the crowd and tried not to meet anyone’s eyes. Most of them hadn’t seen me since I was a teenager. Some of them probably thought I was dead, too.

T found me after. He looked the same, but heavier. Not in weight, but in the way he moved. Like the years had settled on his shoulders and refused to let go. His voice was rougher than I remembered, but his eyes were still soft.

We didn’t hug. At first we just stood next to each other, looking out over the hills, pretending the silence didn’t say everything we were afraid to.

That night, we stayed behind after the rest of the family left. The wind picked up, cold and dry. We passed a flask back and forth, leaning against the tailgate of his truck like we were kids again.

We talked about dumb stuff at first — old neighbors, the shitty playground behind the school, how bad the tribal council still was at budgeting anything.

T told me he still fixed up cars. Said he tried to get a shop going once, but it didn’t last.

“Too many people trying to leave,” he said. “Not enough needing to stay.”

I asked if he ever thought about leaving.

He shook his head. “Someone has to stay. Someone has to remember.”

There was something in the way he said it. I knew what he meant. But I didn’t want to say her name.

I asked him if he ever saw “J” again — our old friend with the broken nose who used to steal cigarettes from his mom’s purse.

T smiled a little. “He’s a dad now. Can’t even imagine that. Kid’s got asthma and a Nintendo Switch.”

We both laughed. It was small, but it felt real.

Then T took a drink, paused, and said, “S would’ve liked that.”

I froze.

From the sudden, tense look on his face, it seemed like he hadn’t meant to say it, not aloud. 
It just slipped out.

But just like that, she was there again — not in body, but in weight. That familiar ache behind the ribs. That knot in the stomach. That blurry, shameful memory we never fully spoke of.

We sat in palpable silence for several moments, thinking about that day.

We both knew what each other was thinking from the look on our faces. The only point of contention me and T ever had…

I looked at him. “You still think it was them?”

He didn’t answer right away.

“I know it was,” he said finally, quietly. “Same way I know the stars are there even when it’s cloudy.”

I felt the heat rise in my chest.

“Oh, cut the ‘young-elder, medicine man’ bullshit,” I snapped, harder than I initially meant to.

He looked at me with that same stoic face of understanding, like he knew everything I was feeling.

It pissed me off, so I let my annoyance show even more.

“Or,” I said, “maybe it’s because no one gave a damn enough to look. Maybe it’s because the cops don’t care when someone like us goes missing. Someone like her.”

T didn’t flinch. “That too.”

There was no fight in his voice. No anger. Just this tired kind of knowing that I hated because I couldn’t argue with it.

His lack of reaction took the wind out of my sails.

I turned away. Took a drink. And let the silence settle back in.

The stars were just beginning to punch through the clouds — pale and flickering, like eyes watching us from the dark. The wind was quiet now. Everything was quiet.

T leaned back against the truck, arms folded. I could see his breath in the air.

“I still think it was them,” he stated again, firm but softly. Like he was offering me something.

And I hated that — not because of what he said, but because of how sure he sounded. Like belief had never cost him anything.

“What, you think they just… took her?” I asked, not really asking. “Vanished her into the stone?”

“I think the cave swallowed her,” he said. “Same as it swallowed stories. Same as it swallows people who forget to listen. Don’t you get it?”

I scoffed. Loud enough for him to hear.

“So what? You just believe in all of it now?” I asked. “The stories, the spirits, the shadows in the dark?”

He didn’t answer.

“That’s convenient,” I snapped. “Way easier to believe in ghosts than in some sick bastard who could’ve followed us. Way easier to believe in fairy tales than in a system that didn’t care enough to even look.”

T didn’t flinch. Didn’t argue. Just took another slow sip from the flask.

“Maybe it’s not about what’s easier,” he said. “Maybe it’s about what keeps you standing. What keeps you safe.”

I stared at him. All that anger, all that grief I thought I’d buried — it started clawing its way back up. Not at him. Not really. At how calm he was. At how he’d been able to stay. At how he could live here, in the shadow of that cave, and still believe.

And maybe I wanted to shatter that…

Maybe I just wanted to prove he was wrong…

That way… I can’t be… That way I know I made the right decisions. 

“Fine,” I said. “You know what? Fine. Let’s go. One last time. I’ll go into that cave, and I’ll prove there’s nothing there. No monsters. No spirits. No Little People. Just stone. Just dirt. Just the place where everything got fucked up.”

T turned his head, eyes narrowed. Not angry. Just… tired.

“You don’t get to do that,” he said.

“Do what?”

“Use her to settle your own score.”

I flinched.

“She’s gone,” he said. “And if you go back in there looking to win an argument, you’re not just disrespecting her — you’re disrespecting everything she was part of.”

I looked away. Clenched my jaw. Frustration building up.

“I’m going,” I said. “I don’t care if I have to do it alone. There can’t be Little People. There can’t be! I think it’s time for you to acknowledge what actually happened! Me? Disrespect her? She was taken — or worse — by some perverted old fuck! Not some fairytale! All you ‘old head’ traditionalists need to let those stories go! …If you would’ve believed in the real world, that has real consequences, then maybe — just maybe — we could’ve convinced someone with real power to help find her, or at least find her b—…”

I started to choke up.

“Why couldn’t you have just backed me up when I told them the truth?” I let out, softly, holding back my tears.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t see what you saw. Only what I did,” he responded gently.

“Trust, my friend. There’s truth in our tradition.”

He looked up toward the stars, seemingly losing himself in the cosmic sea.

“That’s… that’s not good enough for me,” I said softly, while wiping my tears away, my frustration winning over sorrow.

“I’m still going. Even if only out of spite. I reject your tradition,” I stated firmly, with a slight tone of arrogance.

He exhaled. “I know.”

I waited.

He looked at me, then toward the hills. Then back to the stars, that were starting to shine even more brightly now.

“You’re still reckless,” he said. “Chasing proof like it’s gonna undo the past.”

“And you’re still hiding behind stories because you’re scared of the truth,” I shot back.

He smiled, sadly. “Maybe.” 
“You really haven’t changed,” he said. 
“Still gotta burn your hand before you believe the fire.”

“And you still gotta tell the fire a story before you put it out.”

We bickered back and forth, just like that, well into the night.

Just like old times.

And that was it.


He didn’t agree to come.

He just showed up the next morning — empty-handed but determined.

Luckily, I stopped in at the corner market that morning and got some supplies. I had a cheap gas station duffel with two bottles of water, a couple granola bars, a flashlight, and a spare set of batteries. Nothing fancy. This wasn’t some expedition. It was just the cave — the one we’d spent countless summers in. Raced through countless times. Even though we shouldn’t have.

My arrogance hadn’t let up the entire night, but my heart did waver a bit. The thought of returning to a place my sister never returned from…

Was T right? Was I trying to play with fire until I got myself — or worse — someone else burned?

I never did say thank you.

He never asked me to.

——————————————

We left early, just after sunrise.

Not because we were in a rush — but because we didn’t want anyone to see us. The cave was technically off-limits now. There was a wire fence stretched thin around the ridge, rusted signs zip-tied to it every twenty feet or so: PROPERTY OF THE STATE — PIPELINE SURVEY IN PROGRESS — TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED.

It didn’t matter that the land wasn’t theirs to begin with.

The state had sent in contractors months ago. A new natural gas pipeline was supposed to cut straight through the hills, running like a scar through old forest and older stone. They’d bulldozed access roads, flagged off boundaries, and tossed around words like eminent domain and easement like they were doing us a favor. The elders pushed back, but it didn’t change much.

It never really does.

T drove his old Tacoma up the service trail — tires kicking up dust and dead needles — until the road thinned into gravel and the trees grew too tight to pass. From there, we walked.

We didn’t say much at first.

Still, the closer we got, the quieter it felt.

No birds. No breeze. Just the crunch of gravel under our boots and the occasional sigh of trees leaning too far over the trail.

“Still think this is a good idea?” T asked after a while, not looking at me.

“You came, didn’t you?” I shot back.

He grunted — noncommittal.

The trail forked at a shallow stream, barely a trickle this time of year. T hopped across the stones without looking. I followed, slipping once and soaking the edge of my boot.

“You always were the clumsy one,” he muttered.

“And you always had a stick up your ass.”

He smiled — barely — and kept walking.

We passed the old pine with the rusted horseshoe nailed halfway up the trunk. We passed the broken fencepost where we used to stash BB guns wrapped in tarps. Everything was still there, just… smaller. Thinner. Like time had worn it all down to memory.

“I forgot how steep this was,” I said, breathing a little heavier than I wanted to admit.

“You said that every time.”

“Still true.”

T stopped beside a flat stone with initials scratched into the moss.

“S, T, and you,” he said quietly.

I looked down. The marks were faded, but they were still there. I remembered the day we made them — S using the corner of a belt buckle to etch her letter, tongue sticking out in concentration. T watching us struggle, with his same old calm, stoic demeanor. Me digging too deep and splitting my thumbnail.

We kept walking. The path narrowed, branches clawing at our sleeves, the sun breaking into pieces through the canopy.

“Still scared of the dark?” T asked, out of nowhere.

“I’m scared of idiots who believe bedtime stories.”

“Same thing, then.”

I looked over, ready to snap back — but his face wasn’t mocking. Just calm. Like he meant it.

We hit the ridge just before noon. The cave mouth was still there — a dark, cracked wound in the foot of the mountain, choked with brush and shadow. Someone had spray-painted a big red X over the rocks. Another contractor’s marker. Beneath it, half-faded graffiti: KEEP OUT.

It breathed cold, even in June.

T pulled out his flashlight and flicked it on. It sputtered, then steadied.

I did the same. Mine was dimmer, but enough to see by.

“No turning back now,” I said, trying to make it sound light.

T didn’t answer. He just stared into the dark, like he was listening for something.

“Remember the rules?” I said, forcing a grin. “No flashlights, no cheating, and the first one to the Grave—”

“—has to put both hands on the slab and say here lies the Queen of Bones,” he finished.

We both laughed, quietly. The sound didn’t carry far.

The shadows inside shifted with the wind. The old path we used to take, sloped inward gently, curling toward the darkness like a crooked finger. Almost as if it was beckoning into its mouth, ready to consume us.

I clicked my flashlight again, checked the batteries.

“You ready?” I asked.

T didn’t answer right away.

Then: “Y-yeah… Let’s get this over with.”

And we stepped into the dark.
