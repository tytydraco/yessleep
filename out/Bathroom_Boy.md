Hi. My name is Christine. I’m 43 years old and I work at a library in Dublin.

My story started back when I was twenty-two. I had been drinking fairly regularly since I moved out of my mom’s house at eighteen.

There I was, lying in bed. A hangover hammered through my skull as I slung myself out of the covers.

I had mingled with a man that night. Soon enough I realised I was pregnant. The father was on a business trip when I met him. He returned from that trip and I never saw him again.

My mother had died just a few weeks prior. I had no other family. Maybe that’s why I kept the child.

Before I tell you the rest, I want to explain a few things that led up to my decision.

My mum was wealthy, sharp as a tack, and always on top of everything. She was about sixty-two by then and a few years away from retirement.

She began to fall behind at work. Her job as an accountant was highly stressful and we thought at first that she was just burned out. But her skills in arithmetic began to fade. Soon her motor skills started to decline.

By then she had retired and I had moved away to start my adult life.

I returned to visit her after a few years. I regularly called to ask about her health; she always told me she was fine. But when I saw the dishevelled state of the garden — the one she had taken such care in maintaining — I knew something wicked had been brewing.

The floor of her house was littered with fast-food wrappers and vodka bottles. She used to drink when I was younger, but she had stopped for a long time.

When I talked to her she seemed unable to track the conversation. I would repeat myself to no avail.

Her movement issues progressed to the point she needed a cane. Yet she kept forgetting she needed it and would constantly stumble and injure herself.

The doctors had little clue what was going on. They suspected Alzheimer’s, then Parkinson’s. They never managed to find the cause of her illness.

They sedated her with benzodiazepines when she began to suffer panic attacks. They fed her through a tube when she lost the ability to swallow. They couldn’t stop her from passing away.

Pneumonia got her in the end. Her own spit dribbled down her lungs and put an end to her misery.

I knew I didn’t want to die alone. I saw how miserable death could be and I knew the life I carried would stay with me. I had no one else but my child.

I tried to quit drinking during the pregnancy. I tried many times. Every success story I heard always rambled on about how family fuelled their long road to sobriety.

I managed to push through, mostly sober. After I saw Billy laugh for the first time I knew I wouldn’t need alcohol again.

When he was a baby I never complained about the effort, the constant care he needed. The effort I gave was rewarded with his coos and the adorable sparkle in his eyes.

I was stressed, but I never looked at another bottle.

I remember his first mumbled, “mama,” and the way he giggled when it made me jump for joy.

One time, on his fourth birthday, he slapped his hand down on the cake before we could light the candles. Billy was never one for half measures; he was impatient to a fault.

He loved taking baths. Up until the very end he always wanted a long bath. I always made him cut them short — water bills are costly, yes — but only now do I know how priceless every single drop of his happiness should have been.

When he turned six he started rewatching Finding Nemo almost religiously. He insisted I buy him a toy barracuda.

Billy lost the toy while playing at the beach. Every time we went he would run around looking for it. He never found the toy… so one day I bought him another and hid it by our umbrella.

He saw its fin poking out through the sand and squealed with excitement when he dug it out. “Mom, mom. I told you we would find it. I told you.” The joy on his face made every second I spent worth it.

But… Billy was sick.

The school called me one day. He’d had a seizure during class.

I came to pick him up and by then the seizure had stopped. I was concerned, but I didn’t think anything bad would happen. As a parent you can’t — you just can’t think they’re going to die.

For a while things were right. They were normal. In fact, when we went to the neurologist and he gave Billy a CT scan he said everything was normal.

None of the neurologists were worried. “Seizure disorders aren’t uncommon in young children,” they said.

So I took Billy home and gave him a big hug. I felt tense — the day had been long — but the way he hugged me back made it worth it.

It felt like he knew. Like his subconscious had already picked up that something was wrong. I could see it in the way he looked at me. He was scared, so I just sat there and held him.

Billy grew more anxious as the days wore on. He had always been outgoing; he never liked to stay still. He would chatter endlessly about bugs and dinosaurs. When he started to become uneasy and quiet I knew something was wrong.

By the time I got hold of the neurologist Billy had become withdrawn and skittish. The doctors ran the same array of tests. The scans and blood work all came back clean. What worried them was the movement tests.

As he went through the motions I could see the deficits — the way he struggled with things he wouldn’t have thought twice about a few months earlier.

Eventually they asked about my family history. I told them about my mother’s condition. She’d never been formally diagnosed, but the familial link gave the doctors a lead.

The DNA sample took weeks to process. When the doctor spoke the words you never want to hear I couldn’t accept them.

“No treatment, no cure.”

Billy was going to die and there was nothing I could do.

I was outraged. I remember standing up right there in the doctor’s office and demanding they help me.

The neurologist’s eyes were filled with pity; it was enough to make me sick. He couldn’t fix it. He should have promised to do what he could. He should have saved Billy, my son.

Huntington’s disease. It took everything from Billy.

I pulled him out of school. It wouldn’t help him anymore. I called whatever organisations I could find. I read everything I could.

Every day Billy lost something. The sparkle in his eyes dimmed.

I began to drink again. I only drank more as I watched parts of my son slip away to this cruel illness.

At first it was hard to notice. He would forget a word or take longer to get dressed. Eventually it was obvious.

No one could miss the way he writhed, the way he grew confused whenever he left home, the unnatural posture that slowly stiffened him.

I kept the bath water running. Let him bathe for as long as he could.

I helped him out of the wheelchair and into the tub. I ground up his food and fed him. I stood by him every hour of the day.

I wished he would just die already. I couldn’t stand it. There was nothing I could do for him. None of it would matter if he was going to die anyway.

The doctors insisted on all sorts of life support. By then I had been drinking myself to sleep almost every night.

I should have stopped. But it didn’t matter to me. Billy was alive but he was also gone. I had no reason to wrestle with my addictions.

I looked at him with resentment in those final days. The last time I saw him he’d lost the ability to speak at all. He would mumble these atrocious sounds. I wanted them to stop.

I helped him into the bathtub. His gaze was unfocused, but his breathing grew steady. I knew he liked this place. I knew he could still recognise it. He could recognise me.

But I never said goodbye. After I laid him down I headed straight for the nearest bar.

I was drunk on my way there. I got even drunker when I arrived. Those last few days I did nothing but drink.

I never went to that bathroom again.

I woke from a blackout and found myself in a pool of my own sick. One of my neighbours had reported the smell of rotting meat to the police.

They found Billy in the tub. His small, malnourished body was stiff with rigor mortis. The colostomy bag had popped open. Maggots swarmed through the wound and throughout his body. Flies buzzed around him. He had died alone.

I pleaded guilty. The judge sent me away for a year. I begged for a harsher sentence. The look of pity in the judge’s eyes was enough to drive me to hysteria in that dingy courtroom.

I returned to a home that was far too quiet. I stared at the booze in my fridge with nothing but rage.

I never touched another drop of that poison.

Every day, in prison and at home afterwards, I thought about what I did. I thought about how he must have felt.

I spent hours looking at his old toys. I cried over every scrap of his drawings I found as I cleared out his room.

I couldn’t keep them. I didn’t deserve to look at them.

My house has two bathrooms. I used the guest bathroom exclusively. I could never go back to the one upstairs. No one had been inside it for over two years after it had been cleaned out.

Someone had turned on the bathtub.

The worst kind of unease shot through me as I peered over my bedsheets and into the half-open bathroom door.

I stood up, my breath heavy, my feet like lead.

The sound of running water became clear as I stepped closer. It was crisp, nostalgic. It made me feel sick. The door creaked as I pushed past it.

Moonlight cast gentle blue rays through the stained window glass. Pristine white tiles reflected the night sky. The fear I’d felt seemed to melt away.

I turned to face the tub. My breath caught in my throat.

He was long and thin, each limb twice the length of his torso — but I knew what he was. I knew who it was.

He was pale, the same clear white as the bathroom tiles. His abdomen looked like the stem of a plant, the same sickly white as the rest of him and coated in spines.

His knees were tucked to his chest. Water poured from the faucet onto his too-long head.

He had no lower jaw, no nose — only an upper set of teeth. Fine feelers extended down his upper palate.

I saw those small eyes, ringed with puckered muscle and coated with something yellow and waxy. Those eyes that missed me so very much.

I should have been afraid. But I couldn’t be. Not with the vulnerability in his gaze, not with the knowledge of what I had done.

I fell to my knees. I nearly slammed my face against the floor as I prostrated myself. I cried ugly tears; snot ran into my mouth as I wailed. “I’m sorry… I’m sorry.”

“Did you know that dinosaurs aren’t alive anymore?” The words sounded like television static. They rumbled through the air and made my hair stand on end.

I gulped, trying to clear my throat. “I… I know that because… you always used to talk about it.”

The muscular ridges around his eyes pulled back. The small pin-prick black dots sparkled with all too familiar life.

“I think I need to go now. Can you stay with me?”

Panic gripped me. I pushed myself up and reached to grab the boy’s shoulders.

The spines that covered him punched right through the skin of my hands. But I wasn’t going to let go this time. I wasn’t going to let go no matter how much it hurt. “Please don’t go. Please, Billy.”

“But didn’t you want me to go?” He said it softly.

He wasn’t wrong. I wanted it to be over back then. I wanted him to find his peace. But I am also a horrible mother. I couldn’t take the stress much longer.

I hated myself for what I’d done. I hated myself for leaving him when he needed me most.

I forced a smile through the tears. “I won’t ever let you go. Not again, not again.”

He looked away. Moonlight caught his membranous skin. Whatever this was, I didn’t understand it. I knew it was him; I knew it could only be him.

“I waited for you. I didn’t want to go by myself.” He whispered in that same static. Each word made the water ripple in small rings.

I gripped him tighter. The spines dug deep. “Please don’t go.”

“I have to go.” He turned his gaze back to mine. A fresh wave of tears ran down my cheeks. “Thank you for the barracuda.”

I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. The gnawing guilt gave way to profound melancholy. I felt the countless thorns dig into my chest and arms as I hugged him tighter than I ever had before.

“Billy, I love you. I’m sorry… I didn’t want this to happen… I couldn’t do anything.” The water began to turn a pale shade of pink as my blood drifted down. I didn’t let go. I would never let him go. “I love you.”

“Thank you, Mommy. Thank you for being the best mom I could have.” I felt the shadows beginning to dance at the edge of my vision. I felt him fade. I felt my face slap against the water as I lost consciousness.

I woke up in the hospital. I’d suffered more than thirty puncture wounds. Despite my injuries I felt at peace. It was like I had let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding.

We are more than the sum of our sins. Mistakes sit heavy on our hearts. We tell ourselves we aren’t worthy of happiness because of what we did or didn’t do. It is okay to forgive ourselves, because sometimes the choices we make cannot be undone.

We move forward. We carry the guilt and let it light our way. We regret so we don’t repeat.

Whatever we have done in the past, whatever we may be guilty of — what we will do lies only in our hands.
