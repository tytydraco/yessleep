My grandmother’s house felt smaller without her in it.

Not empty, far from it. The place was crammed with family, noise, and the ugly business of moving on.

My uncle grumbled about all the junk. A cousin sneaked off with a lamp. Someone argued over the TV.

Ryan was slouched on the couch, phone in hand, checked out. His grandmother, my great-aunt, was here too, sorting through my grandmother’s dishes.

She was humming.

Soft, almost lost beneath the noise.

But the second I heard it, my stomach turned.

I knew that tune.

I jus didn’t know why.

"Hey," I nudged Ryan. "You hear that?"

He barely looked up. "She hums all the time."

That wasn’t what I asked.

I cleared my throat, humming along under my breath. And without thinking, I whispered the words.

"Boil the water, pour the tea,

Leave the kettle cold, and he’ll come for me."

I barely realized I was speaking until my own voice cut off.

His grandmother stopped humming.

She blinked, like she hadn’t realized she’d been doing it. Then, she gave a small, absentminded smile.

"Your grandma and I used to hum that all the time—I just can’t remember why."

The words landed wrong like something missing from a sentence, a space where meaning used to be.

I laughed, brushing the feeling off—just an old song.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that my great-aunt was lying.

Later, after most of the family had left, I was back in the basement.

I wasn’t sure what I was looking for, something personal that still felt like her. But instead, I found a photo.

An old class picture, black-and-white, curling at the edges.

Rows of girls in identical uniforms.

I scanned the faces, recognizing my grandmother. And beside her, Ryan’s grandmother.

I smiled faintly. There they were, together, decades before we were ever born.

Then my eyes drifted lower.

In the bottom right corner, sitting in the dirt…

A rusted kettle.

A chill ran through me.

I flipped the photo over. My stomach twisted.

Thin, shaky handwriting.

"Boil the water, pour the tea,

Leave the kettle cold, and he’ll come for me."

I swallowed hard.

"Ryan?"

He was standing near an old record player, flipping through dusty vinyl. He barely glanced up.

"What do you make of this?" I held up the photo.

Ryan leaned in, squinting. His fingers tapped against his arm, a restless habit.

"Kinda creepy. But, like… why do you care?"

"Do you recognize that tune?"

His fingers stilled.

A frown. A shift in his weight.

"I dunno. Maybe? Sounds familiar."

"You heard your grandma humming it today."

"She hums all the time."

"Yeah, but does she hum that tune?"

His frown deepened.

I could see the struggle on his face, like something was blocking him.

He tapped his fingers against his leg, frustrated. Finally, he let out a small huff of irritation.

"Forget it."

And just like that, he moved on.

Like it never mattered.

Like he was never supposed to remember.

The following day, I woke up uneasy.

That tune was still in my head.

I found myself back in the basement. Not searching. Just… drawn there.

That’s when I saw it.

A kettle.

Old. Rusted. Placed on a wooden crate, like someone had left it just for me.

I swallowed, stepping closer.

The handle was smooth, too smooth, worn by years of touch.

I lifted the lid.

Inside, a yellowed slip of paper.

I unfolded it.

One sentence, written in the same shaky handwriting from the photo.

"Stay out of the crawlspace, or Mr. Kettles will get you."

My breath hitched.

The air felt wrong.

The lights flickered.

From upstairs…

A whistle.

I slammed the lid shut, hands shaking. Fumbled for my phone.

Me: Dude. You home?

Ryan: Nah, church with grandma.

Me: Weird shit happening. Call me later.

Ryan: Bet.

I stared at the screen.

Something cold and horrible settled in my stomach.

My phone rang an hour later.

Ryan.

I answered immediately. "Dude?"

Heavy breathing.

The distant sound of tires skidding.

"Bro… bro, I—"

A horn blaring.

His breath caught.

Like he’d just realized something.

Like something had clicked into place.

Then, in a whisper…

"I remember..."

The sound of screeching metal.

A crash.

A sharp inhale.

Then…

Silence.

The call cut out.

I couldn’t look at Ryan’s picture board.

I wouldn’t.

Instead, I wandered to his grandmother’s.

And froze.

There, taped to the board, nestled among the other memories…

The same school photo.

I stepped closer. My pulse thundered in my ears.

Ryan’s grandmother was gone.

Ryan stood in her place.

Smiling.

My breath hitched. My hands shook as I reached out, ripped it from the board.

I turned it over.

More shaky handwriting.

"A whistle cries, the door is shut,

Once remembered, your time is up."

A chill slid down my spine.

Somewhere in the funeral home—

A kettle began to whistle.
