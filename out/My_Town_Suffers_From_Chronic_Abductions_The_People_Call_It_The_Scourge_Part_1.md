I think about dying a lot. I think about what happens during our last breath. Are we conscious of it? Do we know it was our last breath? Are our newly decaying brains firing every signal they have to our lungs, begging them to inflate? Do we just experience a helpless fear as our bodies twitch and recoil, terrified of what’s on the other side of the final curtain? Does it hurt?  


For months, these thoughts have consumed all the free space in my brain. Like cancer, the thoughts have been showing signs of their ugly growth inside the parts of my mind responsible for eating and sleeping. They have totally consumed me. Each corner I walk around, the twitch in my stomach tells me its my last. Just as I drift to sleep, the sensation of cold masked eyes surveying my body rips me from my rest and leaves me gasping for air. I wish the son-of-a-bitch would get it over with already and do the deed. SO IF YOU’RE READING THIS YOU MOTHER FUCKER JUST COME AND FINISH ME OF!!!  
This is what happened…  


I grew up in a great town. A medium-sized town. The kind of place that was small enough to consider the people across town your neighbors, but big enough to where you could pick the people you were willing to have snoop into your life. There were still plenty of strangers out there, people you’ve never formally met, but had likely crossed paths multiple times and would continue to do so without ever knowing their name.  


Crime was basically non-existent with the exception of DUIs and the handful of repeat offenders who would get busted for petty theft then always get let off because whoever they robbed went to church with their parents or had a book club with their aunt. And of course, you always had high school kids decorating houses with toilet paper, smashing mailboxes, and getting firm slaps on the wrist for underage drinking and smoking pot, but kids will be kids. Hell, I was one of them.   


Like most towns of this particular size, it was plagued by one terrible thing: boredom. Unless you spent your Friday nights bent over in a bar stool, at the bowling alley, or tucked away in a friend’s garage sipping on some brews, chances are you weren’t doing much of anything. We all relied on the community and togetherness for entertainment. It wasn’t what you were doing that mattered, it was who you were doing it with.   


The day our town became plagued with something much more sinister than boredom, I was ‘doing it with’ my proverbial partners in crime since birth. Jordy, Brent, and I were shooting pool at The Mill, a real shit-hole bar on the edge of town, a bar whose patrons comprised of the all the rambunctious individuals who had been banned from the other booze barns inside city limits. We didn’t really fit the mold of the particular clientele at The Mill, but we were newly 21 and watching the drunken chaos unfold after 10pm was our source of entertainment.  


It was early afternoon and Jordy was yelling at Brent claiming that he racked the balls too loose and was demanding a rerack. It didn’t matter how tight anyone racked the balls, Jordy was never satisfied, and Brent wasn’t having it. They were screaming back and forth at each other, Brent poking Jordy with the tip of his pool cue, Jordy trying to swat the enabling smile off Brent’s face every time he did it. The old timers on their well warmed barstools, mustaches soaked with cheap beer and liquor, turned around and started placing dollar bets on the first fight at The Mill of the day.   


The old timers’ attention was diverted when Mr. Jennings came barreling through the door, slamming it against the wall so hard the neon hanging in the window rattled against the glass. The sound alone broke up the fight between Jordy and Brent. Art Jennings was a large man and although I wasn’t around to see it, legends from The Mill said that many of men woke up bloodied and battered on the bar’s dirty floor after being on the receiving end on his coconut sized fists. He was a monumental figure in the town, owner of Jenning’s Hardware, and a man not known to smile in all his stoicism.  
Mr. Jennings looked beside himself, a complete mess with swollen eyes and fresh tears refracting the dim lights of the tavern.  I had never seen a man so strong look so broken. He was screaming about his daughter, Olivia, saying she had just vanished.   


“Last night, Olivia came into the living room and talked a little bit about school,” Mr. Jennings said. “She went on to bed like every other night. I open up the shop this morning and get a call from Al at the diner asking where Olivia was. Said she never came in. I got in the truck and went back home and ran up to her room. Her bed was all made but there was this opened letter on her bedside table saying things like ‘I’ve been watching you’ and ‘your time has come.’ I call the sheriff and he said he’d look into it but you all know that drunk is good for nothin’. Well, I get back to the shop and see an envelope in my office. I opened it up and the tip of Olivia’s finger was in there. I want my Olivia back! I swear I’ll kill a bastard if I found out who did it!”  


All sounds in The Mill were incinerated by the heat of Mr. Jennings’ rage. He scanned the room with suspicious eyes. Jody, Brent, and I stood in the back by the pool table muttering among ourselves while the old timers dished out their everything will be just fine’s and their I’ll be praying for you’s.  
The town soon found out that everything wasn’t fine. A few days later when she had yet to turn up, everyone knew Olivia was gone, and probably gone-gone. It was the wildest thing and the topic of every conversation whether it was at the supermarket or in line at the bank. What do you think happened to Olivia? Did you hear about the finger? Look into the family, it’s always the family. I bet it was the guy who (fill in the blank) who’s always at the (fill in the blank).   


I knew Olivia, but I didn’t know her too well. She was a few years younger than I, but her reputation in town proceeded her. She was a beautiful girl, prom queen, always volunteering at church and other various community events. She was the head of student council and did whatever she could to make our community a better place. Olivia was the kindest soul anyone had ever met. Never said no to anyone in need and never made an enemy along the way. Had she have gone on, I’m sure she would have run for mayor when the time was right; I would have voted for her.   
For the next few weeks, the entire town banned together to search for Olivia. We had people combing the corn fields, sifting through shit in the sewers, looking for shallow graves in the woods—nothing ever came of it.   


Bad things started happening when police from surrounding towns got themselves involved. Leading the hunt was Detective Woods, an out-of-towner who quickly found a residency in town. He waltzed in like he was the second coming, claiming there had never been a murder he couldn’t solve. He was a real prick of a guy. As soon as he started sticking his gin blossomed nose into everyone’s business, the whole town started to turn on each other. Fingers were pointing, accusations were flying, and feuds quickly developed. All the places the town folk gathered for their social recreation became empty boxes, everyone being too cowardly to face their accusers and those they accused.   


Brent, Jordy, and I stuck together, entertaining ourselves with our own hypotheses of what happened. Alien abduction, werewolves, secret government agencies, government employed werewolves from outer space—the list went on. That was until Olivia returned a few weeks later.   


The woman who found her was Janice Morton, the owner of a small clothing boutique a few doors down from Jennings Hardware. She said Oliva was walking about two miles outside of town on Schiller Road which was an eighty-mile stretch of static AM radio stations and desolation. Olivia was completely naked, head shaved, and the bottom of her feet were bleeding so badly that Janice Morton had to lay her jacket on the floorboard so Oliva wouldn’t get blood all over her interior.   


Needless to say, the town was ecstatic to have Olivia back and to get some answers, but all her return did was surface more mystery. Before Art Jennings and his wife Martha even had a chance to hug their daughter and share a mutual moment of relief, Detective Dickhead Woods was waiting at their door with questions. From what I heard, Detective Woods received no answers. Olivia wouldn’t talk. She was too terrified to open her mouth and screamed and cried anytime anyone tried to get a clue out of her.  
For the next four or five months, Olivia spent every moment in her house too terrified to leave. She wouldn’t even look out her windows in fear that whoever or whatever took her would be waiting. People in the town often said they heard hellish screaming as they walked past the Jennings residence, day or night. It was a harrowing story.  


Just as things started to get better and the talk around Olvia’s disappearance began to fade, she vanished, and that time it was for good. The last anyone ever saw of Olivia was when Mr. Jennings got another letter mailed to his store containing all thirty-two of her teeth.   


Art and Martha weren’t here but two days after receiving the letter. They had packed up their entire lives and hit the road. The police did little more than shine a few flashlights around some dark corners and ask some questions here and there. Everyone had given up on getting to the bottom of Olivia’s disappearance, but I think the town was too afraid to find the answers. To put a rotten cherry on top of the lopsided cake, Jennings’ vehicle had been found overturned fifty miles down Shiller Road. Both were found dead. The coroner blamed a heart attack for the accident.  


I wish the story ended there, but it didn’t. Olivia’s disappearance was only the first. It seemed like every year, someone, man or woman, would go missing for a short period of time, only to return and live the worst quality of life, bathing in fear and impending doom before vanishing for good. A few more families tried to leave town, but they never made it far. It didn’t take long for them to turn up dead in some accidental death or a tragic, but suspicious, suicide. The town was held hostage by a dark cloud that everyone knew was there, but nobody could see.  


The dark cloud affected everyone in one way or another, so much so that the occurrences developed a personality of their own. [The locals called it The Scourge.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DreadfulIncorporated/)
