&#x200B;

**Young:** Okay, thanks for taking the time to sit down with us, Rosa. I really appreciate it.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah… you guys can help, right? That’s… that’s what the man I spoke to said.

&#x200B;

**Young:** We’re certainly going to try, alright? 

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Right… so… um… where should I start?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Wherever you feel is the best starting point. I’m here to listen, okay?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah… yeah… um… I guess I should probably start off with the cowboy locker.

&#x200B;

**Young:** If you think that’s the best place to start, then we can start there. Tell me about the cowboy locker.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Well… okay, I guess it’s not the cowboy locker itself that was special. It just… well, it looked a little different, is all. People called it the cowboy locker because of this patch of rust on the door. People said it looked a little bit like a cowboy. Someone had even drawn a face on it. Eyes, a dopey smile and a little line to show where his face ended and his hat began. I mean… I guess it looked like a cowboy. I guess it also could’ve passed as a detective or a sailor… I’m sorry… I’m rambling…

&#x200B;

**Young:** It’s fine. You’ve been through a lot. But let’s stay focused. So that’s all it was, just a locker with a patch of rust on it?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah, more or less. That’s all it was, right up until Rene made up a story about it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Right. Tell me about Rene’s story.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Well… she came up with it during the Hunger Strike for Hunger. It was like, a little charity event they had at our school. The idea was, a bunch of us would do a 24 hour long fast to raise awareness for families in poverty who couldn’t afford food themselves and as part of the event, we were supposed to spend the night inside the school. Honestly, most of us were only there because this gave us 20 of the 40 volunteer hours we needed to graduate. Do it for two years and get all your hours without any hassle.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Right. 

&#x200B;

**Kim:** The whole thing really wasn’t that interesting. We mostly just sat in the gym and watched movies, although a few groups got bored of the movies and started looking for other things to do… hence the ghost stories.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Ghost stories?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah… one group of kids had started telling each other ghost stories near the back of the gym. Rene and I figured it might be more interesting than the movie, so we went and checked it out. Most of the stories kinda sucked… Rene got bored with it pretty quickly… 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Sorry to interrupt you, for the record can you tell us a little bit about Rene?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Oh, um. Sure. She was my friend. I guess she was… she could be difficult to get along with sometimes, and she could be a little bit up her own ass but she wasn’t like, a bad person or anything. She could just be a little bit of a bitch sometimes. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Right, thank you. Please, continue.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Um… right. So, Rene was bored with the stories they were telling so she kinda decided to step in with her own story. Do you want me to tell it to you or…?

&#x200B;

**Young:** So long as it's relevant, then yes.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Okay. Well… she said that her Mom told her this story. She’d said it had all happened back when she’d been a student and that as far as she knew, it was all true. It was a pretty good setup, that got a lot of peoples attention. Anyway, way back then, there’d been a student at that school named Dylan. Dylan Walker. Dylan had moved here from Oklahoma and hadn’t really adjusted well. Rene’s Mom had apparently said he didn’t have a lot of friends and people had called him ‘*Cowboy*’, because of his thick country accent. That’s what they picked on him for, and when he tried to fight back, it all just got worse and eventually, things finally escalated to the point where he ended up getting called out by another guy by the name of Bill. Bill really hated Dylan for… well… some reason, I guess. She never really specified. And eventually, Bill and Dylan got into this huge argument and Bill challenged Dylan to a fight out by the lake, just through the woods behind the school. Rene said that her Mom was there that night, and that she’d watched Bill and Dylan beat the hell out of each other. And when it started looking like Dylan might actually win, Bill’s friends stepped in. They started throwing punches. Eventually, they dragged Dylan out into the lake, threw him in and they drowned him. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Interesting.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Rene had said that the police did an investigation but nobody talked. They were all too afraid of Bill. Her Mom had told her that there’d been a look in his eye when he’d realized what he’d done to Dylan… not one of remorse but of… enthusiasm… he’d been having *fun* doing it… and they were afraid they’d end up his next victim if they sold him out. So they all just waited for the whole thing to blow over. But it didn’t. Within a few weeks of Dylan’s death… the paint on his locker started to peel. The metal started to rust as if it had been exposed to the elements and people *swore* that the exposed patch of rust looked *just like* Dylan. A lot of people thought it was all just some sort of sick prank at first… but when Bill died, they began to realize that maybe there was more to it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Did Rene mention how Bill died in her story?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah. She said he drowned. Although no one really knew how. One morning, about a month after Dylan’s death… they just… found him in his bed, his lungs filled with lakewater and his eyes open and bulging. Bill’s friends went next, each of them drowning, one by one. But none of them were anywhere near the lake when they died. The police investigated by found nothing. The school tried to cover up the rusty patch on Dylan’s locker, but it always came back… and soon, people just started calling it the Cowboy Locker and the name just sort of stuck. They forgot its origin and they forgot about Dylan. Although Rene said her Mom believed that his spirit still haunted the school.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see… and that was the story, then?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah, that was the story. I mean… repeating it, I guess it doesn’t sound like anything special. But like… something about the way Rene told the story, the conviction in her voice made it easy to believe it was true.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Did you believe it was true?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Not for a second! I mean, it’s like some shitty internet creepypasta written by some thirty year old loser in a basement somewhere. But it was a decent campfire story.  Although… I guess Natharie believed in it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Tell me about Natharie.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** She was… well… she was weird. Like, I mean I guess every school has its oddballs, right? That guy who’s a little too into World War II, the girl with the notebook filled with kissing anime boys or the girl who’s a little too obsessed with the occult. Natharie was the latter.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Obsessed with the occult?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah, but in a really shallow way. She had healing crystals that she brought with her to class that she swore worked and carried what she swore was an authentic Grimoire in her backpack. I mean like, she sorta went out of her way to make it her whole identity, but it came across as really… I dunno… tryhard? She even kept telling people that she had magic powers and was gonna curse them and stuff. Anyways, Rene *did not* like Natharie. Neither did I, but like… Rene *hated* her.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Right. And Natharie believed in this ghost story?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Well, as soon as Rene was done, she asked something like: *“Has anyone ever seen the ghost?”* The moment she spoke, I saw Rene giving her this dirty look. I thought she was just going to insult her at first, but I guess Rene decided to mess with her a bit. She told her that lots of people had seen the ghost, and that she’d heard you could even summon him, although she didn’t know how. She said the whole thing so matter of factly. Like it was all common knowledge. Most people probably knew she was just joking but Natharie…

&#x200B;

**Young:** She believed it?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah, she did. And she started trying to contact the ghost of Dylan Walker. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** How’d she do that?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Well, she started off by bugging the guy who currently had the locker. She spent about a month trying to convince him to switch with her, before he agreed. I’m not sure *why* he agreed, but I’m pretty sure she paid him. Then once she started using the locker, she started drawing this weird ouija board on the inside door, and doing these seances in front of it after school… I mean, it just looked really dumb. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Did no one try to stop her, or…?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I mean, I think some of the teachers talked to her, but no one like, did much to get in her face about it. Honestly, I didn’t pay that much attention to the whole thing. Natharie was always doing weird shit like that and I always just kinda figured she did it for attention.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Fair enough, I suppose. So what happened next?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Rene happened… like I said, I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the whole thing, but Rene did. She found this whole thing hilarious. Then about two weeks after Natharie started her seances, she told me she’d slipped a note from ‘*Dylan Walker*’ into her locker.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Do you know what this note said?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I don’t know what most of the notes said. I only know that Natharie ate the whole thing up, claiming she’d made contact with the ghost of Dylan Walker. She got all excited about it, and Rene decided to just start running with it. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Howso?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** She figured out the combination to Natharie’s locker and started breaking in, in between classes. She’d read whatever notes Natharie had left for ‘Dylan’ and leave new notes for Natharie to find. The poor girl probably thought she had like, a ghost penpal or something… really it was just Rene being an asshole.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And you didn’t try to stop this?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I told her that she was being an asshole, but… no… I never really did anything about it. Even if I had, I don’t really think it would’ve made a difference. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. So how long did this correspondence go on?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** A few months. Natharie never really caught on and Rene just sort of carried on the whole facade up until Natharie asked if there was any way she could meet ‘Dylan’ in person. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see… and that was when the incident by the lake happened?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** *\[Pause\]* I didn’t know what Rene was going to do… I swear I didn’t…

&#x200B;

**Young:** I understand that. But I’m going to need you to go through it, Rosa, okay?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Okay… 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Tell me what happened.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** One night… um… June 9th… June 9th, Rene told me that we were going out to the lake. She didn’t tell me why, she just… she needed a ride. I had a car and she didn’t. So… that was why I was there. She didn’t tell me what we were doing, she just said that it was gonna be really funny.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And you went along with her?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I didn’t think that it had anything to do with Natharie! I didn’t! I wasn’t even thinking about that and I didn’t know what Rene had been saying in the letters they’d been sending back and forth! I just knew that Rene wanted to go to the lake, that’s it!

&#x200B;

**Young:** I know. But please… let’s continue.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** *\[Sigh\]* When we got there, Natharie was already there. Apparently, Rene had told her through one of her fake letters that if she wanted to meet Dylan face to face, she’d need to go to the place of his death and bathe in the waters at midnight. So that’s how we found her, in the lake, trying to do some sort of seance. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** What happened next?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Well… Rene started playing this audio on her phone. Someone calling Natharie’s name. I remember she’d looked up, and the look on her face… she just looked so elated, like… like everything she’d ever wanted had just happened. She started coming out of the water… and that’s when Rene took out the camera. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Rene took photographs?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah… of Natharie coming out of the lake. She was still fully clothed too, like… she’d gone in fully dressed. I mean, I guess that was part of whatever ritual she thought she was doing. She was wearing this black robe… but she still looked like an idiot. Anyways, as soon as Natharie saw the camera flashes, I think she realized what was going on…

&#x200B;

**Young:** That this had all been a childish prank?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah… 

&#x200B;

**Young:** So what happened next?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Rene came out of the trees. She was laughing, and she kept telling Natharie how dumb she was, like… just really tearing into her. And Natharie just… she just kinda stood there, shaking. After a while she started crying and eventually she just sorta ran off… before you ask, no. I wasn’t laughing at Natharie. I thought the whole thing was pretty fucked up and I told Rene that as soon as Natharie had left! I told her she’d gone too far!

&#x200B;

**Young:** And what did Rene say to that?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Not much… she just kept saying that it was a joke and telling me to lighten up. But like… there’s a *limit* on what is and isn’t a joke. You can’t go that far and then just say it was a joke. Like… I get that what Natharie believed was nuts, but she did *genuinely* believe it. And doing that to her… it wasn’t right.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I couldn’t agree more… but staying on topic, my understanding is that Rene shared the pictures she’d taken, is that correct?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah, she posted them online. She actually did get suspended for it, but I mean… it was kinda just a slap on the wrist, I guess. And everyone was laughing at Natharie. I mean, she had it bad already, but after that it got worse. I’d never seen her so… *\[pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Young:** So…?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** She’d always had it bad before, right? Like… people always picked on her, but I’d never seen it get to her like tht before. She took it really hard. I think what Rene did finally broke her completely. She’d stopped coming to school entirely right before exams. Then school let out for the summer and I heard from a friend that she’d…

&#x200B;

**Young:** That she’d taken her own life?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah… that. *\[Pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Young:** Rosa, can you tell me what you know about the suicide of Natharie Kirschner?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I know she drowned… she… she went out to the lake, a few weeks after the prank and she… 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Was that all you heard?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** No… I… I heard she’d weighed herself down with stones. She’d painted some kind of rune on each of them and she’d filled her pockets with them, then she’d just… just walked into the lake. I heard that someone saw her doing it, but didn’t realize it was a suicide until she didn’t come back up. By the time they found her, she was already…

&#x200B;

**Young:** How did Rene take this information?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Honestly, it shook her. Like I said, Rene could be an asshole but she wasn’t a bad person! The things she did to Natharie, she *genuinely* thought they were funny. And when Natharie died she… I think it hit her just how fucked up what she’d done had been. She called me crying a few days later, talking about how I’d been right, and how she’d gone too far… I didn’t want to talk to her at that point though, so I stopped responding to her texts, stopped answering her calls. I didn’t even listen to her voicemails.

&#x200B;

**Young:** You were trying to cut ties?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Maybe… I was mad at her, though. Because I’d *told* her that what she was doing was messed up and now Natharie was… Jesus… 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Rene regretted her actions though, correct?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah. She did. And maybe some people would say that’s enough, but… I don’t know… I just… I don’t know… even with what happened next… I don’t…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Rene’s suicide?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Yeah…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Tell me about that.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** It’s just… there’s not much to tell. They found her in the river back in August. They… they ruled it a suicide. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** You say that as if you don’t believe it was a suicide.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I’m not sure if I do.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Why is that?

&#x200B;

**Kim:** The voicemails she left me… especially near the end. I made a point not to listen to them but after she died, I went back. I… I wanted to know if there was anything I could’ve done… I had to know… I…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Tell me about the voicemails, Rosa.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I… I can’t… you have them, don’t you? 

&#x200B;

**Young:** We have copies, yes. But I want your perspective on them. 

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I don’t have a perspective on them… I just… you’ve *heard* them! 

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’ve read the transcripts.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** But you haven’t *heard* them! You didn’t hear the way she sounded… you didn’t…

&#x200B;

*\[There is the sound of movement\]*

&#x200B;

**Kim:** You need to hear it… you need to…

&#x200B;

*\[An audio recording is played from Rosa Kim’s cell phone. It depicts the voice of Rene Meloni. Recording is consistent with the voicemail recovered shortly before Meloni’s death.\]*

&#x200B;

**Meloni:** *I can’t sleep anymore… Rosa… I… I can’t sleep… she’s there… I… she’s in the water I can’t… I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I… I can’t do it anymore… I can’t… I can’t… I don’t… I…*

&#x200B;

*\[The audio ends with several seconds of Rene Meloni sobbing, before cutting out abruptly.\]*

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Do you hear it? The state of mind she was in?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Yes… yes, I hear it.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** And the other voicemails… she talked about seeing Natharie in her dreams. How… how regret and sorrow don’t earn you peace. She was having dreams about Natharie! She was seeing her in her dreams, *just like I’ve been seeing her in mine!*

&#x200B;

**Young:** Yes… I’m aware of that part too… 

&#x200B;

**Kim:** And I don’t think I’m the only one. I keep hearing about bodies they find in the lake… people keep not showing up at school. People like Rene, who used to pick on her. People who laughed at her. And I… I don’t know how much longer I have left until it’s me… I’m *scared!*

&#x200B;

**Young:** I promise, we’re going to do whatever we can to help you.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** What if there’s nothing you can do? What if there’s really nothing you can do? The nightmares are getting worse and I… I… every night I see her, coming out of the lake, shambling toward me, I see her coming… *I see her…* I just… I don’t want to die… I don’t… I don’t want to die…

&#x200B;

**Young:** You’re not going to die, Rosa… I promise.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** Can you promise that? Can you…?

&#x200B;

**Young:** We’re going to do our best.

&#x200B;

**Kim:** I didn’t think so…

&#x200B;
