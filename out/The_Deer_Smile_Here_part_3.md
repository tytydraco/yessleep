I wish I never came here, to the town of Fredericksburg. The roads are like ebony in the night, and the town doesn’t operate like a town should.

Thankfully, I managed to obtain the book before the moon rose and became my world. It details dos and don’ts — what I need to do before the moon blinks and pitch blackness falls upon the town.

I’ve chosen today to explore the nearby town, looking for the town church the book described as the first step to escape this nightmare. Though if only my day could be that easy I thought to myself, my brakes squealing as the sound of metal on metal rings through the air, I come to a complete stop, body jolting forward from the sudden deceleration. Trees loom to the left and right of me, almost as if trying to reach the sky. Eyes peered at me from within the forest, hoping I would make the mistake of getting out of my car, though they were not what I was staring at. A singular deer stood in the middle of the road blocking the way I was going.

Standing 6 feet tall in the bright moonlight, I couldn’t help but notice the deep chestnut color hide speckled with spots of white. Used to hunt deer like this back in the real world, you’ve never had real deer until you’ve had Axis meat. So tender, juicy, almost a beefy consistency. Though this deer was different, axis are skittish, bolting at the snap of a branch, but this one just stood there, it’s smile widening.

Smiling Deer, the book described them in detail, though words can’t put them to justice how eerie they are. Eyes the color of spoiled milk, teeth pearl white with specs of red flesh glistening against their teeth. Hearing it giggle, the ch-ch-ch-ch of it’s teeth chattering, grinding against each other. “Fuck this” I think to myself, throwing the car back into drive and I start to drive around only it, only for it to walk in the direction I’m driving, blocking my exit, it’s giggling getting louder, the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch of it’s teeth increasing in volume.

Being closer to the beast I could see it’s “hooves” were human hands, the nails torn off from overuse against the hard ground. They made a tapping noise against the ground, as if anticipating something, and that’s when I heard it, the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch. Not only from in front of me, but behind me as well, from the sides of my car. My ears overcome with the grinding noise of teeth of teeth, I frantically peered into my rear view mirror, confirming my fears. There were dozens of them, all giggling, hands scraping against the asphalt as they came closer and closer to my car. Their eyes all a sickly yellow, staring hungrily at me as they found their next meal.

A loud CHLK-CHLK right next to me snapped me out of the trance. The deer in front of me managed to move without me noticing and was now staring at me directly through my car window. Only a weak pane of glass separated me from the creature, it’s giggling, it’s teeth chattering, saliva dripping out of it’s mouth as it made another attempt to open my car door. Panicking, I slammed the accelerator, the car veering to the left and right as the smooth shitty tires of the car couldn’t keep up with the sudden acceleration.

Though I barely noticed it as the ch-ch-ch was replaced with the loud shrieking of the deer behind me attempting to catch up to their prey. Though despite their best efforts, my car managed to outpace them, much to my hearts delight. I could still feel it trying to pound of my chest, fuck I hate being out here, though at least now I was fully awake. The forest roads may be dangerous, but the town has plenty more for me to fear. Hopefully I’ll find the church, and find a way out of here.
