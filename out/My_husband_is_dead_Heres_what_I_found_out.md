Ok everyone... So, big spoiler: my husband is, indeed, dead. And I don't think whoever has been living with me is his ghost. 

Let's start from the beginning. If you read my last post, you know I found a death certificate belonging to my husband... From 20 years ago. This wouldn't be weird if... Well, if he hadn't made breakfast for me this morning. 

Since then, I received a lot of advice, so I decided to postpone my plan of escaping and dig into it. No pun intended.

A lot of you asked me if I was sure the death certificate was real. I was mostly sure it was. I looked at it several times. It said he was married and had my full name under spouse, right address, right data... I was listed as the informant of death, which is weird because I don't recall any of this. At all. No matter how hard I try. It lists he died at the hospital and was buried in his parents' town, at the local cemetery. 

I called the funerary agency listed and asked if they could send me the paperwork related to his funeral, to which they replied it had to be requested in person to verify my identity, which I can't do because my "husband" would suspect my absence. 

So I took the certificate to the local police station. I asked if I could see the records. The officer looked at me with pain:

-Oh miss Smith... We never caught whoever shot Jim's car, it's a cold case, but we can't disclose the files without an authorization, I'm sorry. 

And added

-Man, I do miss Jim... How have you been doing? I see you sometimes but you always seem to ignore me. I believe you're mad at us for not finding the killer, and I can't blame you, so I never brought myself to talk to you... 

I was dazed. I've never talked to this man before, why is he being so familiar? Also... The killer? What killer? Wasn't this a car accident? 

I looked at the certificate in my hand. Sure enough, the cause of death was listed as murder. I was just so sure of what killed him that I never looked at it. And what did he mean by missing him? Did they know each other? Exactly how much did I forget? 

-Hey, huh... I had a mould situation at home, and the pictures I had of Jim were damaged... Do you have at least one in the file you could give me? That's all I want. 

He looked around to make sure nobody was watching him and shot a quick "wait here". 

He came back with a photo and a newspaper cut-out. As he gave me these, I felt a chill that froze me in place. 

I don't know this man in the picture. I have absolutely no recollection of him. I can swear I never saw him. And I can swear he's in none of the pictures that decorate my house or lay in the albums.

The picture in the newspaper showed the same man. The same face unknown to me. Along with a last phrase that made me sure I *need* to find out what's going on:

*"Jim Smith departed in the arms of his wife, Allison Smith, and the couple's baby daughter, Elisa Smith"*
