I’m not sure what writing this will do for me. Relieve some sort of guilt? Answer lingering questions? Give me closure? I don’t know. All I know is that I am compelled to write about this experience, for better or worse.

Rumors in a small town don’t take long to blacken every mouth. They burn their way through lungs and hearts, boiling saliva and charring listeners' ears. If you look closely at any man who claims to not know you’ll find them wearing their hat low on their head to hide their disfigured face. I am not immune to this grisly fate and I have my fair shares of scars, but not a whisper of smoke trails along my fingers as I type this story.

There’s a particular rumor that has burned our town like a wildfire. I can still recall where I first heard it, such a grip it has on my conscience. Just past the second red light, right before the turn-off to the only grocery store for miles, is the high school. A small building built back when my parent’s parents were children. 

Lining the walls of the hallways are posters with “Class of \_\_” in fancy text on the top and the graduates’ pictures beneath. Unlike many schools we were rivals with, our graduating classes were so small that the individual portraits were larger than coasters and their names were proudly displayed under each rather than just a footnote in unreadable text at the bottom.

Perhaps it is because of this that it was impossible to miss one in particular. In the freshman hallway on a yellowed paper reading “Class of 1958”, two rows down and four from the left, is a student wearing a hat. Joseph Dehing. If it wasn’t for the out of place Panama hat, he would just be another forgettable face of someone who is long since dead or geriatric. 

I noticed him on my first day of school. Having shown up much too early for class on the insistence of my high-strung mother, I decided to explore the hallways of the freshman hallway, all 100 feet of it. When I saw his smirk and his “fedora” I chuckled to myself, thinking of the jokes I would tell my friends when they showed up. And when they did, dragging with them a sophomore who we knew well, that’s exactly what I did. A childish “virgin” or “m’lady” joke that landed well on my immature friends. 

The sophomore, though, became quiet and very serious all of a sudden. “I wouldn’t joke about that guy.” 

Never being one to start something, one of my friends asked before me, “Why, is he a teacher or something?”

“No, man. On the night of prom his girlfriend snuck out with another dude, then he tracked her down and drowned her in the river. The dude she cheated on him with got mad and did the same to him! Now, he haunts the school and attacks people who sneak away during prom.”

Our town was known for ghost encounters, so much so that a good portion of our tourism industry, the only thing keeping the town afloat, was ghost tours and memorabilia. On several occasions I had even seen vans filled with camera equipment stopped at various “haunted houses” to record episodes for the latest ghost hunting shows. I believed in none of it, so I scoffed and made another joke.

The sophomore, unable to hide that he was disappointed his joke had failed, rolled his eyes and said, “Whatever, man. Just don’t come crying to me when he gets ya.”

From there the conversation shifted to more pertinent topics like what classes we were going to and where they were. Any talk of Joseph or his picture faded away completely, but I never forgot.



By Junior year I had become a completely different person. Mostly due to the intense boredom and isolation that came with online learning through my sophomore year, I had come to enjoy watching scary videos and learning about the supernatural because being scared was better than feeling nothing at all. I still didn’t necessarily believe in any of it, but the passion of storytellers inspired me, so whenever I had the chance to do something “spooky” I jumped on the opportunity.

Yet, it wasn’t a ghost tour or a haunted hayride that brought me back in contact with this rumor, it was fishing. I was on the bass fishing team in high school and we practiced in two places; a small local lake and the Mississippi River. We were fishing the Mississippi that day and I was assigned with a boat captain I knew well, Tommy, and a Freshman I didn’t. 

As we were prepping our gear Tommy said, “We’re not goin’ too far today on account of my motor, it’s been actin’ up and I don’t wanna be stuck up *this* creek with only a paddle.” 

I stopped working on tying up the crank bait I was planning on throwing and asked, “Are we fishing backwaters then or the main channel?”

“We’re gonna fish Deadman’s.”

I nodded and tossed my crank to the side to tie on a finesse Texas rig. I had fished Deadman’s many times and knew it would be muddy. As I did I looked up to find the freshman looking at me. “Why’s it called ‘Deadman’s’?” He asked.

“That’s where the bodies wash up.” I answered, partially trying to scare him.

He scoffed at my scare tactic. “What bodies?”

“The people who kill themselves off the bridge.” Now I was being honest. Crossing over the Mississippi just upstream was a bridge that only had a small chain link fence keeping people from falling from the sidewalk connecting the Illinois and Iowa side of the river. At any given time, flowers could be found stuck through the wire memorializing the many people who climbed that fence to end their life. By the whims of whatever god controls the horrid eddies of the Mississippi, the bodies of these people are almost always found in Deadman’s Slough. 

This is such a common phenomenon that it’s little more than a fact that many in the area are accustomed to. When another person “disappears”, whispers are passed around town about how the body would be found in Deadman’s Slough, just like always. Yet, it isn’t this that gave Deadman its name, it was the Armistice Day Blizzard of the 1940s that swamped boats and froze people under the Mississippi’s muddy waters that first gave this unassuming stretch of water infamy.

My absent reflection and lure tying was interrupted by Tommy saying, “Also the murders.”

This caught me off guard. I knew of the Smiley Face murders victim found in Deadman’s, but to my knowledge that was the only murder victim found there. Now I was the stupid freshman, asking, “What murders?”

Tommy contorted his face to reveal his yellowed snaggle teeth, a sorry excuse of a smile, and said, “I thought you’d’ve heard this one given prom coming up.”

My mind jumped back to my first day of freshman year and the story the Sophomore told us. I hadn’t given it much thought, I thought it was just a cheap scare tactic. “The dude who killed his girlfriend and then got killed?”

“That’s the story they’re telling now? No, it’s much, much more than that…”

Over the next few hours of fishing he told us the whole story which I will now recount in full as best I can here. 

\~\~\~\~

When Tommy was a freshman in high school he had seen Joseph walking the halls. A popular student, he was on the basketball and football team, but wasn’t a meathead like those jocks. In fact, he was near the top of his class and the vice president of the student council. When senior prom came around, he was the favorite for prom king. However, he didn’t have a girlfriend, so the prom queen vote went to a girl named Betsy who was a new student who had just moved to town from some place in Wisconsin. 

When he was announced as king and Betsy as queen, he became obsessed with her. At first, likely as an act of sympathy, Betsy played along, talking and hanging out with him. From Tommy’s juvenile view as a freshman, they looked like a pretty good couple up until a few days before prom. It seemed that suddenly Betsy had had enough, ignoring him as he begged for her attention. Many of Joseph’s friends began to distance themselves from him as well, put off by his weird behavior.

Eventually this came to a head the day of prom. During lunch, Joseph went over to where Betsy was sitting and began screaming at her. He said that since they were prom king and queen they *had* to date and that she didn’t have the choice to ignore him. As long as they were king and queen, she had to *be* his queen. Betsy disagreed, but he suddenly leaned in close and whispered something to her. Her face went slack and she reluctantly agreed to do all the usual pre-prom things with him but specified it was for no other reason than to get him to stop making a scene. After Joseph thanked her and left, Betsy left too, running the opposite way. As Tommy walked to class he said he could hear sobbing from the bathroom.

That was the last he saw of either of them, and that since he was a freshman he never witnessed what happened at prom, but rumors passed around by classmates filled him in on the rest of what happened. Joseph and Betsy went to dinner, did the Grand March, and all the other pre-prom traditions, but Betsy did not smile once. Even in the picture for the school yearbook she was wearing an expression of indifference. After the formalities, Joseph dragged her to the dancefloor where she stood still or, when prompted by Joseph, danced as minimally as possible.

At some point in the night, Joseph walked out to go to the bathroom and Betsy, like a corpse reanimated, sprinted on high heels straight out of the gymnasium. People at the back of the gym said they heard the slamming of a car door and the squeal of tires. Joseph came back to the gym to find his date gone and some people staring at the back wall, stunned by the spectacle they had just witnessed. He followed suit, sprinting out of the gym much the same way Betsy had. 

When prom ended, people left the gym to find Joseph sitting, blank faced, in the spot where his father’s car had been. When he noticed them, he seemed to snap out of it and began walking into the darkness back towards his house. Neither of them showed up to after prom. 



The next day, someone driving to the city across the bridge to return her dress to a family friend was stopped by a police barricade and told to go north to the Wisconsin bridge instead. When she asked what happened the officer told her that there was a car stopped on the bridge and did not elaborate further. When neither Betsy nor Joseph showed up for school on Monday, rumors spread. Later that same day the police came into the school to ask questions and they were officially declared missing.

Lots of talk and speculation was thrown around, but by the end of the week, the drama surrounding the events that occurred that prom night had mostly died down. Even the police interrogations had all but stopped.

Then, Saturday night, one week after prom, Joseph walked into town. He was disheveled, wearing a battered and muddied tuxedo, hair slicked back with grime. As he limped past the diner just outside of town, someone recognized him and called the police who arrested him just outside the flood gates. 

He was not seen again until trial. Everyone was pretty much convinced that he had murdered Betsy, but his story was that she had jumped off the bridge and he simply got lost in the woods trying to find her. On the second day of the trial, drivers found her. In Deadman’s Slough, as always. She was badly decomposed and partially eaten by wild animals, but from what was left, the coroner ruled it a suicide.

With that ruling, there just wasn’t enough to convict Joseph and, after a long court process, he went free. He didn’t attend school the rest of that year, only showing up for graduation where he got the loudest send-off of any student, even if it was all booing.

He was rarely seen after that, though occasionally spotted fishing on the river. Sightings got fewer and further between until one day they just stopped and he was never seen again. Some assumed he moved, but many hoped he died.

\~\~\~\~

“If ya ask me, I think he drowned.” Tommy said, “Weird bastard couldn’t get over it and joined his ‘lover’ in the river.” Tommy then got a mischievous look on his face and said, in a low tone, “I’ll betcha his ghost still haunts these parts, yanking people under as they try ta fish.”

I scoffed at his attempt to scare us and cast my line back out into the waters that they pulled Betsy from. The freshman we were fishing with held his rod tight in his hands, looking uncomfortable at the idea of even being on the water. When he caught my eye he changed his facial expression to look tough.

I wanted to learn more about this story. This was the kind of thing that you only hear about on Dateline or in some obscure YouTube video essay. “Does her family still live in this area?” I asked Tommy.

“Naw, they moved out shortly after the trial ended. Prolly couldn’t stand to live where their daughter died. Can’t say I blame ‘em.” 

It was then that the spirit of those ghost hunting videos got to me and I had an idea. An idea that I would come to regret. 



A couple weeks later it was prom. As I got ready, I took special care to move my ghost hunting “equipment”, consisting of a cheap EMF reader and a dial radio I got at a garage sale, to my car without my parents noticing. At dinner I reiterated the plan to my friends who had agreed on going. We were going to try to “talk” with Betsy. Looking back on it I don’t just regret what would happen later that night, but also for the utter disrespect of going out on the night of someone’s murder to harass them. 

Prom was boring. Same old awful pop, rap, and slow dance music that they play at every school dance. Per the plan, we left early. Others were leaving too, but, unlike us, they were leaving with the goal of getting hammered at a non-school-sponsored after party. They went up towards the suburbs while we headed out of town. Three people came with me; Sam, Alice, and Jacob. As we drove past fields and trees, spirits were high. We sang along to raunchy music and shouted out the windows to scare deer beside the road. 

When we bumped over the train tracks and pulled into the gravel parking lot of the boat launch, illuminated by a single flickering sodium streetlight, our commotion quieted to a whisper. We knew that the folks who dared to live in the often-flooded houses by the Mississippi did not like people, and especially not teenagers who were there to goof around. We walked quietly to my boat, tied on one of the docks, and piled in, careful not to mess up our neat dress clothes. I yanked the cord on the motor and it roared to life, seemingly much louder than when you’re not trying to be quiet. We untied and headed up the river to Deadman’s Slough. 

Our phone flashlights did little in terms of navigation, the moon did a better job of lighting up the shoreline, but with the waters high from snowmelt, we had no difficulty getting there. When we arrived at the place I had just been fishing not a few days earlier, now somewhat sinister in the dark, I cut the motor. 

“Ok, turn on the EMF.” I told Jacob. He took it out of his pocket and it blinked to life, illuminating his face in its green glow. 

“Phones are off, right?” 

The silhouettes of my friends nodded in agreement. I nodded back and turned on the radio. The sound of static cut through the night air. I began turning the knob on the radio, quickly cut music and conversation burst at intervals through the static.

“Are there any, uh, spirits with us?” I asked.

No response, just the same garbled conversation as before..

”I thought I heard it say ‘dick’.” Alice piped up.

That was pretty much the end of any sensible conversation with spirits. Everything devolved into childish humor and asking the “spirit” inappropriate questions. After nothing meaningful we gave up and decided to go for a midnight joyride, leaving the slough entirely to cruise on the main channel.

We went all the way up to the bridge before turning back around. On the way back, Sam suggested that maybe the spirit didn’t talk to us because it was afraid of the water. It was a sensible point, if I died in the water I sure as hell wouldn’t want to spend the afterlife in it either. As we came back through Deadman’s, I beached the boat. Sam, Jacob, and I got off, taking off our dress shoes first to not get them muddy, but Alice stayed back since she was afraid the plants could rip her dress. We went on without her, trudging through swampy land that made up the islands of the backwaters in the Slough. 

As we went we tried communicating with the radio again, but got nowhere. Right as we were about to give up and head back I said to the radio, “We’re gonna leave if nothing makes itself known.”

For the first time that night we got a response. Clear as day we heard, “Keep going.”

My heart dropped out of fear. “Keep going?” I repeated.

”Nahhhh, what the fuck.” Sam muttered.

The radio didn’t respond, but we hesitantly continued. The ground got drier as we went, we were approaching the middle of the island. I asked the radio, “How much further?”

”There.”

We looked up, flashlights lighting the forest in front of us. In the light we could see four wooden posts sticking out of the ground, young trees growing between them. 

The radio spoke unprompted, “There… he is.”

Now we were thoroughly freaked out. “Who’s ‘he’?” Sam asked. 

“Middle.”

”I-I think I’m going to stay here. To, uh, keep a lookout.” Jacob said.

”Pussy.” Sam snarked.

I walked with him to the middle of the four posts, trying to look unfazed, but really I wished that I had stayed back with Jacob. As we reached the middle, Sam suddenly jumped. “OW! Fuck!”

He was hopping on one leg, cradling his foot. I pointed my flashlight to see what he had stepped on and saw a row of teeth protruding from the ground. The instantly recognizable curve of a human jaw.

“There.” The radio said again.

Sam noticed what I had seen and stopped cursing, going completely still. Ahead of the jaw was the rest of the skull, and surrounding it were many, many, catfish skulls. I had stopped scrubbing the radio stations, but through the static it spoke again. “He ate them.”

Sam turned to me, fear plastered on his face, “We gotta get out of here, man.”

I didn’t need any more convincing, but if I had, the scream that echoed through the trees from the water would have done it. Jacob was already gone when we turned around, we could hear him running through the woods back towards the boat. We followed his trail and nearly ran into him when we reached the edge of the woods. 

“Dude what the fu-“ Sam stopped as he saw what Jacob was looking at. 

There, illuminated by the light of Alice’s flashlight, not even 15 feet away from the boat, was a person. Bobbing gently in the light waves that undulated across the river, face down, hair knotted in the places where skin was still attached to the skull. The skin that was left on the body was pale and wrinkled. In many places it wasn’t there. The bones of its spine protruded from what was left of the meat. Mercifully, the lower half of the body was in the water, but what we saw was too much. As we watched, a fish’s tail broke the surface and splashed. I knew from how many times I had caught them that it was a catfish. It was eating the remains. 

Without warning, the wind changed and the smell hit us. If I hadn’t been raised rural I’m certain I would have vomited. I ran for the boat, jumping in and yanking the pull cord. Sam and Jacob hadn’t even sat down when I threw it in reverse. We didn’t say a word as I drove back. 

It wasn’t until we were on dry land, driving back over the train tracks that someone finally spoke up. “Should we… call the police?” Jacob asked.

I was about to respond “yes”, but Sam interrupted me and said, “And let our parents know we were doing stupid shit? No. They’ll find it.”

”That doesn’t seem right, though.”

Sam thought for a moment. “How about this,” He turned towards me, “You go out tomorrow. Say you’re going fishing. ‘Find’ the body. Call the police. You don’t even have to go out, just say you did or some shit.”

I nodded. The car fell silent again. 

In order to not raise suspicion, we went to after prom and did our best to act normal. Like we hadn’t seen something no one was supposed to see. I never did call the police, I couldn’t bring myself to drive back there, much less get on the water again. 

I kept a close eye on the news and, sure enough, they found the body that next day. Police investigators. The people who should’ve found it in the first place. 



Again, I don’t know what writing this will do for me. I feel guilty about a lot of things; not calling the police, bothering the "spirit", dragging my friends into it and so much more. Time has changed nothing, I lose sleep often thinking about it. I still won’t forget that night. I still won’t forget that rumor that brought me there. And I certainly won’t ever fish Deadman’s Slough.
