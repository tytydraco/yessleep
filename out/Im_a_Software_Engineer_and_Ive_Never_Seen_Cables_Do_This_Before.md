As a software engineer, I had seen cables that ranged from as thin as a quarter of an inch in diameter to thicker than the width of my thumb. I had also seen red ones, blue ones, green ones; almost every color of the rainbow. I had never seen cables like the ones I saw that day. 

Also, I had met many cable installers (aka cablers). Most of them had chill, laid-back, and friendly attitudes. Others seemed to care more about their work but managed to have small conversations with customers to maintain professionalism. The cable installer my company hired that day did not have any of these traits. 

I didn't need a degree in psychology to know this guy didn't run on the same operating system as the rest of them. When the rest of his face sat in a neutral position, his eyes still had a certain excitable spark behind them. It was as if his mind could never rest. 

Also, his arms and legs seemed beyond his control. They seemed to pull him in different directions against his will. I noticed this most when I shook his hand and it seemed to push mine forward toward the cable room behind me. 

He also wasn't very sociable. I greeted him and he greeted me. I told him my boss wanted me to watch his work. He said that was alright. Then he moved past me into the cable room. Most professionals, I believe, wouldn't have acted like this. 

His behavior didn't bother me, however. I welcomed it. When my boss told me to keep an eye on the cabler (apparently there had been a case of someone slacking off), conversations were the first things that my mind began to dread. 

The second was having to give up the pleasure that I felt while coding for a few hours. I could get so 'in the zone' that I could go hours into overtime without looking up. All the world would just slip away. I'd forget about my problems like the fights I'd have with my wife about staying at work late, heh heh. 

The cabler seemed to have the same attitude as me about his job. The man dropped the boxes he had carried into the cable room with rhythmic thunks. He then pulled out all the cables and made thwapping sounds as he slapped them onto the floor. It took him three minutes to get them all out. In another few minutes, he had plugged over 50 cables. All the while, I caught a blissful look on his face. 

As he worked, I got a good look at the cables. They seemed to have diameters of about half an inch thick. That was the only normal feature about them. Color-wise, they all had patterns like stripes and polka dots on them. Shape-wise, they seemed to naturally hold curves rather than laying straight. This made the cable network look like a chaotic mess. 

By the time I realized this cabler could be a fraud and/or prankster, the man had already plugged in a few hundred cables. As I went over to confront him, that's when I noticed it. The cables were moving on their own. They made snake-like jerking motions back and forth. It seemed as though they wanted to free themselves from their plug-ins. 

"Um, sir," I said. "Should they be doing that?" 

The cable installer turned to me and then looked where I was pointing. His eyes grew wide and his hands shot forward. Each grabbed a handful of the cables. Unfortunately, the speed of the motion only resulted in him freeing these cables from their plugs. Their freed ends began convulsing wildly, stabbing the air and throwing themselves about. Many of them scratched the cabler's skin and caused it to bleed. As the flurry of cables continued, I just managed to notice that the drops of blood disappeared each time a cable end dropped down.   

Soon, one of the cables managed to orient itself so that when it hit the cabler's skin, it pierced right through it. The cabler grunted and let go of the cables. He tried to pull the cable out. Under his fingers, I saw the sections of the cable bulge and shrink. It was drinking. 

More cables plunged into the cabler's arms in rapid succession. Ones that had fallen to the floor pierced his legs. The moment that they stabbed him, they began drinking. 

I swore and rushed forward. I grabbed the cables attached to each of his arms and yanked at them, but they wouldn't budge. As I continued to try, some of the still free cables turned to me and began stabbing at my arm. I dodged them for as long as I could, but one managed to dive into my wrist and straight through the bone. 

I let out a wail, let go of the other cables, and tried to free my wrist. The cabler reached forward and tore the cable out of me, leaving a bloody hole. Then he pointed to the door. 

"Go," the cabler said. 

"But-," I said.

"Don't worry about me. This is my job. And I love it." 

I crept backward because his statement had bewildered me. As I did, more cables freed themselves from their connectors and made beelines for the cabler. As they all began piercing his flesh, he didn't make a sound. He sank into a sitting position, laid back until his shoulders hit the floor, and sighed. With my heart in my throat, I rushed to get my boss. 

By the time we got back there, the cables and cabler had disappeared. They couldn't even find any trace of either of them on the security footage. All that they saw was me, looking and reacting to seemingly nothing. 

It was deemed that I had had a nervous breakdown and, to my horror, I was given two weeks' leave. When I tried to use the bloody hole in my arm, which somehow remained, as proof of my sanity, they dismissed it as a self-inflicted wound. 

During those two weeks, I spent a holiday in the warmth of a tropical sun and amongst the beauty of tropical flowers. While I was there, I thought a lot about the incident. The day I got back to work, I handed in my [two weeks' notice](https://www.reddit.com/r/frerkinghorrorstories/)
