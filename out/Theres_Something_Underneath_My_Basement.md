My name is Alex and as I write this, I know it’s only a matter of time before the RCMP find me. And when they do, they're either going to question me about why I burned my house down or take me, probably both honestly.

Right now I’m held up in the nearest hotel, not planning on going anywhere. I have barely slept and I don’t think I'm going to get much more sleep going forward.

They’re going to want answers and the truth is, I don’t have any good ones, none that makes any sense anyway. Hell, I don’t understand what happened myself. Their gonna think I’m insane or something but they can go look for themselves once the fire dies down and they can look down in that fucking hole in the basement.

Besides, how do I explain to them that I found another house beneath my basement?

It all started a couple of weeks ago when I found a property for sale while driving around. In this market, you don’t expect to find anything remotely affordable anymore, let alone a full house for $50,000. That alone should’ve raised red flags, but it didn’t. I was too caught up in the price so much that nothing else mattered to me.

There was no online listing, no real estate agent, nothing. Just an old wooden sign staked in the front yard: *FOR SALE* scrawled in fading red paint, with a phone number beneath it. I called. The man who answered sounded old and told me it was for sale for $50,000. I bought it on the spot and spoke with him a little longer to arrange a day to purchase it.

I should’ve known something was off from the start. But I didn’t, or maybe I did and chose to ignore it. I don’t know anymore.

It was tucked away near the end of an old, half-forgotten road where barely anyone lived anymore. The distance between each house made fences kind of pointless unless you REALLY needed privacy, just empty land with thin, scattered trees that looked more dead than alive. There were more shadows than people out there somehow.

The house itself was small. Tiny really, especially by modern standards. A little paperwork, a quick money transfer and suddenly, I was a homeowner. Well “new” owner at least. The place was old and worn, but I didn’t care. It was my house now. 

The man selling it was in his seventies, maybe older. Pale, wrinkled, like someone who hadn’t slept properly in months. He said he was heading to the East Coast to live with his family somewhere in Labrador. He told me his wife had passed away just a few months earlier. Found her one morning in the back garden. Dead, just lying there in the grass. He didn’t say how she died and I didn’t press him for details.

It wasn’t exactly the comforting image you want burned into your mind when buying a house, but still I had the deed and for the first time in my life, I owned something that wasn’t some shitty apartment I was renting for more than what it was really worth.

That night I drove over to pick up the keys from him. It was already late well past sunset and the road leading to the house was barely lit. Only a single streetlamp buzzed weakly near the edge of the property, casting just enough light to see the outline of the porch. The rest of the house was drowned in darkness. No lights on inside. Not even a glow from a window, just blackness inside.

The front door was slightly ajar hanging open like someone had left in a hurry. On the porch, right in front of the doorway the keys were sitting on the ground. No note or anything.

I bent down to pick them up and the moment my fingers touched metal something came rushing out towards me from the house, nearly knocking me to my ass from jumping back so quickly.

It was the old man.

He rushed out the front door fast, faster than I thought a man his age could move and walked straight past me without a word. Not even a glance in my direction. He had this wide, unsettling smile stretched across his face like he just did something wrong and got away with it. It was unnerving the way he smiled.

He didn’t stop either. He didn’t turn back to look at me or anything, just kept walking until he reached the other side of the road and kept walking further and further until he was out of sight in the darkness.

I stood there on the porch, keys in hand, trying to process what I had just watched until I couldn’t see the old man at all. I had no clue what was in that direction at all, an uneasy feeling overtaking me even when I glanced back to the house again with its front door wide open now, the pitch blackness inside haunting in its own way.

What got me the most was how tall the old man looked that night. He seemed taller than I remembered him being when we first met, almost unnaturally so. Maybe it was the night playing tricks on me or maybe it was just the sheer unease of that moment, the sight of him rushing past grinning ear to ear in the dark, that had scared me more than anything at the moment when I saw him rushing past me. I never saw him again.

It took a few days before I was fully moved into the house. There were the usual chores of changing the locks, bringing in the essentials, trying to make the place feel like mine by placing furniture and photo’s everywhere. It may have looked small from the outside, but the house had a deceptive amount of space. Two modest bedrooms, a cramped kitchen, a tight but functional living room, and even a pull-down ladder that led to a shallow attic you had to crouch in to move around. But what really surprised me was the basement. The stairs creaked with each step you took but they led down into a massive, open space about the size of the entire footprint of the house above it. It was dark, musty, and smelled faintly of damp stone and old wood, but it had potential.

Like the rest of the place, it needed work. The exterior was in rough shape, yellow paint flaking off in long strips, roofing shingles cracked and curling in spots, the kind of damage that only years of sun, wind and neglect would do to them over time. Still, with how little I spent on the place I had enough saved to start making improvements. I wanted to build something for myself finally.

It was only two days ago that everything changed.

It had been raining hard all day, the kind of steady yet heavy, cold rain that soaks through everything it touched. I was heading down into the basement to grab a toolbox when I noticed nearly two feet of water at the bottom of the staircase.

I looked around for the source, expecting to find a burst pipe or a window left open, but there was nothing I could see that was letting the rain water in.

I scrambled to collect the buckets, pans, even plastic bins, anything I could use to start scooping water into to help fight the rising water. I’d scoop up what I could, run it outside, and toss it far from the house, only for the water level to rise again when I came back. It was a losing battle yet I had to keep trying, the last thing i needed was my entire basement filled with water and reach the top of the staircase..

On my sixth trip down there, something gave.

As I was rushing to the bottom of the stairs I heard a sound, a deep, hollow like sound, like wood giving way under pressure. Then, all at once, the water began swirling, spiraling toward the center of the basement like in a sink once the plug was pulled. It drained quickly, all of the water rushing downwards until all of it was gone, leaving behind a single hole dead center in the basement.

It was no bigger than my fist  right in the middle of the floor. I waited for the last of the water to vanish before approaching it with caution. My first thought was it was an old floor drain. Maybe it had been blocked for years and finally gave way once there was enough water down here, but when I shined my phone’s flashlight into it that idea died pretty quickly.

There was no pipe, no grating, no rusty metal or broken pipe, just a black void in the center of my basement floor. The dirt and cement around the edges were rough yet round at the same time, maybe a collapse but it was level with the floor somehow.

The closer I got to it to look, the weirder it started to get.

With my phone’s flashlight, I could just barely make out what looked like... another floor beneath me, far far below. Was it a second basement? Another room? I had no clue what the hell I was looking at at that moment.

I wanted to know more. I *needed* to. But making the hole bigger was a risky move. If the foundation was as old and brittle as the rest of the house, I could bring the whole damn floor out from under me, hell I could even make the house collapse over me. Okay maybe not that last bit but you get my point.

At the same time there was absolutely nothing I could do at the time being. The rain water was gone thankfully but until tomorrow no one was going to be swinging by and checking it out for me, not until tomorrow at least.

Worst case scenario, I figured I could grab a piece of plywood, cover the hole, and pour concrete over it, that would seal the damn thing off and pretend it was never there. Not a perfect fix but at least it would keep the basement from collapsing under me…hopefully.

When the morning came I stepped outside to inspect the house for any more damage from the storm before finally making my way back down to the basement. I was expecting the hole to still be there. What I wasn't expecting was the hole to be much bigger now overnight.

What was once the size of my fist was now easily large enough for a grown man to jump through. No digging or tools required for the job, just a clean, dark opening in the middle of my basement floor. Looking down into it again I could finally confirm what I thought I’d seen the day before, a wooden floor much deeper down then I thought originally. There even seemed to be boxes down there as well

Even if I wanted to go down there the drop was too far. There was no way I’d be able to climb back up if I just jumped down there. Hell I would probably bust my leg up just jumping down there, the only way to safely reach the bottom was with a ladder. So I got one.

I drove to the nearest hardware store and bought the longest extension ladder they had, along with a decent flashlight, something stronger than what my phone's flashlight could handle. When I got back I carefully lowered the ladder into the hole, extending it as far as it would go until it finally touched the bottom. The very top of the ladder barely grazed the stone floor below. If the floor it leaned on gave out while I was climbing down I would for sure fall and probably break something along the way.

I took my time descending step by step, testing each one with my full weight before committing to the next. The moment my feet touched the bottom, I realized how strange the air felt. Warm and dry, too dry for a space underground that had just flooded.

I flicked my flashlight to look around the room, the shape of it was off somehow.

The wooden walls rose upward at a sharp angle, forming a triangular space that immediately struck me as familiar. I turned slowly as pieces started clicking in my head. “This looks just like my attic” I remember telling myself, only it was taller and almost thinner on the sides in a weird warped kind of way.

Even the boxes down here looked similar to the ones I had in the attic only stretched into more odd shapes. Inside the boxes though was nothing but crumpled up paper and old splintered wood that smelt like they were decaying for a while. It wasn’t long before i spotted the pull down staircase like in my actual house.

I hesitated at first before yanking it free and carefully descended once more, my flashlight flicking around in my hand as I stepped lower and lower into this house under my basement.

The darkness swallowed  me as I entered the hallway.

I was standing in what looked like my own living room, almost exact to my living room. Same furniture, same shitty worn down rug, the same family photos hanging on the walls. The photos were wrong though, stretched in a way that it was like someone editing them used a tool to stretch them taller and thinner without adjusting them to look right..

The pictures with myself in them scared me the most.

All of the photo’s with myself standing in them made me look off in so many ways, it was the only part of any of the pictures that looked proper within them, yet I look monstrous in them. I looked taller but thinner, my eyes wide and a huge grin smeared across my face in an almost impossible way. It scared me a little to look at them.

I moved toward the kitchen, stepping lightly as I did. The air felt still and heavy, it was like no one had been down here in ages yet everywhere I look things I had in my own house were place perfectly where I left them, the kitchen was a perfect sight of this with a plate and fork left in the sink, and a coffee pot left on the counter from this morning. The kitchen was just as distorted, tall counters and oversized cabinets. Two impossibly thin chairs that looked exactly like what I had but scaled like props in some surreal movie scene. I would have had to jump to sit on them and even then I’d probably snap them like twigs from doing it.

There were windows but instead of letting in light they were filled with dirt and stone, the dirt pressed right up to the glass. No sunlight could reach this far underground, but the lights overhead… they looked intact despite their oddly stretched design.

I stepped to one of the light switches and flicked them up.

For a split second  the bulbs flashed with an intense light, revealing just how wrong everything was. The sudden light flash made the bulbs pop loudly and killed them in an instant. Within that brief moment of light I thought I saw something at the end of the hallway leading into the living room.

The light was on and gone so quickly I couldn’t tell what it was, but it was tall, unbelievably tall as it stood there staring at me.

I quickly raised my flashlight down the hallway, the beam bouncing wildly off the walls. I could’ve sworn I saw something, someone even standing there. I froze, heart pounding, eyes locked on the place where it had been as my hands shook holding the flashlight. My mind raced to make sense of it, where the hell it even came from, but it came up empty. Panic started to creep in as I backed into the kitchen counter with my hand blindly searching for anything to use, it landed on the handle of a kitchen knife. It was long and thin, barely more than a glorified machete then a knife, but it was the only thing between me and whatever might be waiting on the other side of the hallway.

I stepped forward slowly, each foot step echoing too loudly on the warped wood. The silence was thick like the house itself was holding its breath as I moved through it. I inched my way to the end of the hallway, ready to fight whatever the hell was over there only to find nothing, nothing at all.

Did my eyes play tricks on me with the sudden flash of light?

I stood there for what felt like forever trying to calm myself, trying to make sense of what I’d seen while searching every inch of the living room for anything at all. There was nothing, nothing except for one more room in this messed up house.

The basement.

Every piece of me screamed at me to not go down. God only knows what the hell was waiting for me down there, yet I needed to see now, I had to see what was down there.

I took my time, descending the narrow staircase little by little. I reached the basement floor of the second house and there, right in the center of the basement floor was another hole. And this time a ladder was already in place. Almost identical to the one I had used earlier. As if someone, or something, had placed the same one for me. What if it was there because I placed my ladder to reach down here?

The hole was much wider than the last one as I stepped closer to it. It was wider yet the attic I was looking into this time was much shorter then this one, maybe shorter than the one I actually owned on top..

This time though, nearing the edge the smell hit me harder than anything else. The stink of rotting wood and something sour and organic, made my stomach twist and turn a little. I covered my nose with my sleeve and leaned over shining my light into the pit. The space below glistened under the beam. Everything looked wet, drenched in something thick that shimmered like oil.

Maybe this was where the rainwater had drained. But that didn’t make sense, this second house would have soaked it up before it even reached the basement, hell whatever was down there didn’t look like it was soaked in water at all, more slime or mold.

My curiosity got the best of me as I began climbing down, ignoring every desperate plea my brain tried to make me stop. This house, the third one, was the opposite of the last. Where the second house was tall and thin, this one was short and wide. I had to crawl on all fours just to move around down there and the smell, oh god the smell was so bad. The attic ceiling was pressed downwards, forcing me to crawl to the pulled up staircase before I was free from it.

The air was thick and wet down here, covering my face was out of the question now with my arms drenched in whatever the hell this was as everything had a thin layer of mold or slime or…whatever the fuck it was, making my steps a little more slippery. I was in the hallway now, forcing me to dip my head slightly to avoid hitting the low ceiling. The walls were stretched outward now, wide and bloated. Warped like something swollen from the inside.

Again everything was where it should’ve been to the layout of my actual house. My furniture, my photos. But this time the distortion wasn’t just in shape. It was *texture*. The air smelled of mildew and decay. the furniture sagged. The floor squelched slightly beneath my feet and the photos were awful. My face was bloated and discolored. My eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of my face swelled over them like I was infected by something.

I made my way toward the final staircase, the one leading down to the basement and I heard it.

Breathing.

Slow, ragged, wet, a rattle of the throat like it was trying to clear something deep in its throat.

The sound grew louder with every step. It wasn’t just breathing, it was struggling with every breath it took like it was trying to stay alive. In a way it sounded like water was lodged in their lungs and every breath rattled it around in a sickening manner.

I descended carefully each step louder than the last, a slight squishing sound to go with them from the mold beneath my feet as I reached the bottom step, seeing the basement floor finally.

Someone or something was standing there, standing over what looked like another hole dead center to the basement.

It was hunched, shorter than me for sure. Its back was to me, looming over the other hole in the floor. Its body looked swollen and damp, its skin pale and blotchy, and its head  too big for its frame. The gurgled wheezing echoed off the walls as it shifted slightly.

Then it turned, its step made him jiggle just a little bit.

What I saw was…me, but it wasn’t me at the same time.

Its face was bloated and discolored, its eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of its face swelled over them. Its mouth slack and drool hangs in thick strands from its bloated lips. Its shirt was identical to mine, soaked and clinging to its sticky body, its eyes barely registered my presence at first.

“What the fuck...” I whispered, the words barely escaping my throat as I looked at whatever the hell this was in front of me.

It let out a sickening noise, a cross between a gargled yell and a cough. Its whole body shuddered before it started to move towards me, moving faster than I expected it to move.

Each step made its bloated skin shake from its footsteps, the bloated parts nearly covering its eyes shifting to its weight and gravity.

My body told me to run, run and don’t look back, my boots slipping across the slime coated floors as I scrambled up the staircase in a mad panic to get away from it. The gunk clinging to the surfaces and making every step a risk, I could barely keep traction.

I launched myself onto the pull down staircase as fast as I could, dragging myself upward on all fours like a scared animal clawing its way out of a trap. Behind me I heard the wet, slapping sounds of it following, its hand reaching up from the pull down staircase leading to the attic already. I felt fingers swipe at my ankle, slick and sticky but they slid off just as I hauled myself forward and to the hole in the attic

I could hear my own heartbeat ringing in my ears, my body buzzed with adrenaline and a blind panic coursing through every nerve in my body. That thing, that twisted, bloated *version* of me was chasing me and somehow catching up. I didn’t dare to look back, not wanting to see that thing catching up to me in any way.

If I can get to my actual house and pull the ladder up, I could prevent it from reaching me, no way for it to be able to climb up that distance I hoped. I was in the second house now, out of breath but I could still hear it following me as I raced to the staircase, reaching the hallway once again and climbing up the pull down staircase again. I was nearly out of there as I stood in the attic for a second.

I grabbed the ladder and started to climb like a mad man, reaching only half way up the ladder before I felt its hand grab me by the leg.*.* The entire ladder lurched in my hands, its weight suddenly doubled from the thing joining me on it. It held on to my leg, trying to pull me down with it as I struggled to keep a grip on the latter, my hands still slick with the third floor's slop.

I didn’t stop to fight it. I ran. I sprinted across the attic floor to the next pull-down staircase, yanked it open, and threw myself onto the steps, climbing as fast as my legs would carry me. The wood groaned beneath my weight. My fingers slipped on the wet rungs. I could hear the creature scuttling after me, faster than anything that heavy and bloated should’ve been able to move.

His hands were cold and rubbery, coated in something viscous that immediately soaked through my jean leg. It yanked hard, trying to drag me back down with it. I tried to pull away, holding on to the ladder the best I could, my other foot flailing around and trying to get back on to one of the steps of the ladder. The thing below snarled, breath bubbling like it was choking on vomit as it finally spoke out words I could understand.

“*Deeper...* DEEPER*!*” it gurgled, its voice broken and wet like it was speaking through a throat full of sludge.

“Get the fuck off me!” I shouted.

I twisted violently trying to break free and kicked down with my free foot aiming blind. I struck the left side of its face, my foot nearly sticking to its face as I raised it up again and brought it down on him again and again.

“Deeper!” It screamed at me before my foot smashed it in the jaw, a loud crack coming from my foot smashing into it again. With one final kick I felt the left side of his face give, almost like a grape being stepped on as the skin cracked open underneath my foot and his grip suddenly loosened as it fell to the floor beneath with a wet splat like a water balloon. The entirety of the left side of its face was broken up, gushing out blood and whatever fluids was stored inside of its body as it poured out around it, its body twitching as it laid on the floor beneath me.Looking down at it, a part of me wanted to make sure it was dead. Instead I pulled myself up into my actual basement, pulling the ladder up with me to make sure nothing else could come climbing up.

I didn’t know what the hell to do. My mind was on fire, spiraling on what I just witnessed, trying to make sense of what I had seen, what I had just killed*.* There were no answers that made any sense, just more questions piling up and clawing at the edge of my sanity. But through the noise, one thought cut through with terrifying clarity. What if something else could crawl up here? It may have been the panic I was in, it might have been the thought of more fucked up versions of me could be lingering down there, but in the end i decided to burn the place down with whatever I had on hand.

If nothing existed up here then there shouldn’t be anything down there right? It mirrored my home in every way before twisting it and making whatever the hell I just saw down there. It was the only thing that seemed to make sense in my mind at that moment.

I tore through the house grabbing anything flammable. Paper, lighter fluid, cans of spray, I even thought about getting gas from the tank of my car to pour everywhere but I would need it to get the hell out of here. The smell of chemicals filled the air, sharp and burning my throat as I spread everything I had everywhere. I didn’t care about damage or cost or consequence anymore, this house was cursed with things I couldn’t understand

I stood in the center of the living room for a moment as I readied the matches, my fingers trembling to get one of them lit before throwing it down, flames shooting up everywhere very quickly before I rushed out the door.

As the flames rushed through the house I made my way out the front door that somehow was already wide open. I didn’t remember leaving the front door open at all but I shook that thought out of my head as I ran to the car, igniting the engine to get the hell out of there as flames engulfed the house. I let the house burn behind me, never once looking back at it as I drove as fast and I could out of there like a bat out of hell. Looking back it now I could have done so many different things like call the police and have them see the hole for themselves and whatever fucked up thing was down there waiting for them, but as it stands I could care less now. I should be upset with burning my home down but I don’t, I really don’t after all of that.

I’ve been at this cheap hotel ever since, holed up in a room that smells like old wallpaper and cat piss. I haven’t slept or eaten much, my stomach just turns whenever I think of the third house down there.

My mind keeps going back to when I found that…thing in the basement, it was looking at another hole dead center of the basement. There was another house down there, maybe more messed up then the third one and who knows how many more beneath that one.

What bothered me even more was the fact that the third house had a messed up version of me, was there one for the second floor or did I get lucky? I thought I saw something but I looked everywhere when I was down there and spotted nothing but what if I missed it somehow?

I don’t know. I’ll probably never find out now and honestly, maybe that’s for the best.

Anyway, I’m done writing about this. Just trying to keep my head on  straight while I wait for the RCMP to show up. They will come eventually.

Someone is knocking on my door so I’m gonna see who it is. Whoever they are, I can see their shadow in the window and they are tall as hell.
