“Your dad’s going to kill me,” I grunted as Lacey brushed the hair from my eyes. 

“He’s not going to kill you. Now hold still.”

I fidgeted. “He killed your last fiancé.”

Ah, shit. She stepped back and folded her arms, which meant I’d said something dumb.

I rested my hands on her shoulders and kissed her forehead. “I’m sorry for what I did or didn’t say,” I whispered.

She flashed an exasperated look. “He didn’t kill Carl. It just became very apparent after the two of them met that he and I didn’t have a future together.” 

“Good.” I pushed my hair back into place. “So what do I have to do if I don’t want your father to kill me?”

“Just be yourself,” she answered, brushing the hair from my eyes once more. Then, as an afterthought, “and trust your instincts.”

“So you’re the one who’s been plowing my daughter.”

My stomach froze to evoke a feeling that can only be compared to the exact moment when liquid bird shit turns solid. 

Frank bored an icy stare into me.

Then he burst out in a series of loud, wheezing guffaws. His face turned baboon-ass red as his white mustache sucked in an out of his strained gasps.

“Lighten up, Joseph,” he squeezed between breaths, wiping his eyes. “That Carl never could lighten up. Really cost him in the end.” With a great heave, Lacey’s dad hefted himself into a standing position. “C’mon,” he ordered, waving me forward. “There’s something you need to see.”

I checked my watch to see that it was 4:13 p. m., exactly three hours before we could make our merciful exit. I tried and failed to organize the myriad ways that he was making me uncomfortable, then silently decided that there was no reasonable path to avoid hating the experience. That meant just going with what he wanted was the fastest way out of things.

He led me to a bedroom at the end of the hall. I did not like where things were going.

“I’ll leave you two alone now,” Lacey’s dad offered, dancing his bushy gray eyebrows while sliding his tongue across his upper lip.

I stared at him, jaw hanging, as I obediently walked through the open door. 

He closed it behind me. My heart sank as I heard the lock slide into place.

Something was very wrong. 

Every hair on the back of my neck stood up as I turned around to face what waited for me in the room. Was it going to be weird? Gross? Embarrassing? I told myself that it couldn’t be as bad as my imagination made things out to be. 

It was worse. A man dressed in rags was chained to the far wall. His wild eyes and grime-streaked face told me that he had been locked there longer than his own mind could comprehend. He waved his head wildly back and forth, gnashing teeth that were yellower than his sallow skin. 

My head spun as I took a step forward to release him from his bonds. 

I stopped when I understood that one of his hands was already free, and that he was pulling at the rope holding his other arm in place. I relaxed a little, knowing that I wouldn’t be complicit in a kidnapping once he was free.

That relaxation broke when I realized he was staring at me with abject hatred as he untied the last of his bonds.

“Hey… guy,” I offered, glancing around the room to realize that there were no windows. “Why don’t we-”

With a guttural rasp, he yanked away from the rope and lurched toward me.

“Why don’t we calm down?” I asked in a shaky voice as I backed into the corner of the room.

Instead of calming down, he reached for a fireplace poker that I hadn’t noticed was lying on the floor. 

“I’d rather you didn’t do this,” I pressed as he lifted the poker and swung it back and forth like a baseball bat. 

Then the man turned his hungry eyes toward me and raced forward. 

The look told me everything: his hatred wasn’t going to be contained by anything other than reciprocal violence, and he wasn’t going to stop until one of us was dead.

“Nuts,” I lamented, dodging him at the last minute as he swung at me. The poker slammed into the wall, sending a tiny storm of plaster pieces cascading to the floor. 

I backed to the opposite corner of the room, right next to the place where he’d been bound, and tried pleading again. “What if, instead of doing this, you didn’t?” I asked as he charged forward once more.

I barely dodged this swing. I felt it graze the hair on my head. 

I understood then what I’d been denying. 

Fear coursed through me as I prepared to fight. The man turned blazing eyes toward me, racing forward with the poker held high. I backed to the nearest wall, arms spread wide I as flatted my back against it. I wanted to puke, but focused on the task before me.

He swung. I ducked. 

The poker slammed into the wall, catching itself so deep that the man could not immediately pull it out. 

“Poor choice,” I whispered as I turned my crouched position into a full-bodied launch. But instead of wrapping my arms around him, I pushed to bounce back, knocking myself against the wall as he tumbled backwards onto the floor. Moving quickly, I turned around and gently pried the curved poker from its position in the broken plaster.

I heard the man climbing to his feet behind me, but didn’t let that fact affect my work as I carefully extracted the tool from the wall. I pulled it out just as his footsteps closed the distance between us, turning around while baring the poker as I faced him.

The poker jolted backward in my hands. Its butt slammed against the wall by my head. 

I stared in shock as I realized that he had run neck-first into the business end of the fireplace poker, the tip of which was now embedded deep into his neck. Blood cascaded from the wound onto the floor. 

I didn’t move as he fell backward, pulling the makeshift weapon from my grasp as he did so. The man convulsed twice and then was still. 

I *couldn’t* move as I watched the pool of blood slowly creep toward my feet. 

That’s when the door burst open. My blood chilled as Lacey’s father raced for me, his face inscrutable. I didn’t have time to react before he threw his heavy body at me, pinning me in place. My ear tickled, sending shivers up and down my spine, as he pressed his mustache against it.
