By that point, my main problem—my greatest obstacle—was time. How much longer could I hide my condition? How much could my skin endure? My body? How long would the ointment last?

No matter how much I searched in pharmacies or online, I couldn’t find anything even remotely similar, and that man certainly didn’t make it easy either. He had given me an unlabeled plastic bottle that could just as well have once held liquid soap, mouthwash, ketchup, or who knows what else. The cream-colored substance was non-specific; it wasn’t the only tonic of that color on the market. Both the general practitioner and the dermatologist assumed it was a generic ointment that only worked on me as a placebo.

With so little progress and the feeling of being backed into a corner, I made a decision: I would have to see him again, no matter what. I had to be more direct, more confrontational, and not let myself be impressed by any of his tricks. At that point, what more did I have to lose?

First, after a long time, I returned to the bathroom where everything had begun. I felt a mixture of rage and helplessness thinking about how things had unfolded—that that day had been just like any other and that, because of that encounter… I felt envy watching everyone else, so carefree, so healthy… If only I could take it away from them…

Nothing. I went back three days in a row and nothing happened. The only “progress” was the steady depletion of the ointment. Every day I stood one step closer to the precipice, so I went to the other place where I might find answers: the cinematheque. I returned to places I had sworn never to set foot in again—not out of fear, but with the desire to confront him.

I entered the building and, without wasting time, went straight to the counter. I felt slightly anxious as I asked the attendant if he knew that actor. I lied, saying that he had offered me work on one of his projects after the screening of his short film, but that for one reason or another we hadn’t exchanged contact information. The attendant looked at me suspiciously, said that the man didn’t usually receive visitors, and asked me to wait a moment. He began typing on his phone (I assume a text message). After a few minutes—during which I noticed him scanning me from head to toe, analyzing my clothes—he said:

“All set. Our angel can see you now. Are you his new little angel?” He smiled with a hint of malice.

“No, I—” I realized there was no point in clarifying anything and continued. “What? He works here?”

“Not exactly. He’s been renting the back studio from us for quite some time.”

He told me the guy was working on a film project in which he would once again appear as an angel. Without my asking, he added that he couldn’t say where the funding for those projects came from, nor did he clearly remember what the man did for a living—something like a researcher at a pathogen center. He finished by saying:

“He’s a very strange guy. The farther away I am from him, the better for me.”

Finally, he let me through the counter, pointing me toward the back door. I hesitated for a moment; after all, I was about to enter the territory of a very dangerous and unpredictable man. Several thoughts crossed my mind at once: *Should I wait for him outside the theater? Should I bring the authorities? Oh no—what a scandal. That would be the end of my social life. Besides, he already knows I’m here. Why would he agree to see me so easily?*

I crossed the door and found myself in a corridor lit with red bulbs. The infrared light made me uncomfortable, and I’m not lying when I say I came within two or three steps of running away, turning around and fleeing. Seeing everything bathed in red altered my senses, putting me on even higher alert.

I looked at some photographs lining the walls. They were stills from various films—many of which I remembered having seen. I took my time searching for any image of the man, and sure enough, I found several.

In them, he appeared smiling on what seemed to be a film set, wearing angel wings. I could barely recognize him in three or four others, mostly because of the wings. In the earlier ones he looked radiant, as ethereal as the first time the shadows had deceived me; in the more recent images, his appearance was increasingly deteriorated. Yes—I finally remembered having seen those films. I hadn’t recognized him before because of the characterization. He looked about ten years older in his movies.

At last, I stood before the door I’d been directed to—the fourth on the right. I turned the knob slowly, opening it little by little. I slipped my hands into my pocket and tightened my grip around a small knife I was carrying; it wasn’t much, and I had no intention of using it, but I couldn’t afford to be completely defenseless.

I found myself in a white room—white in its purest neutrality. However, the side walls broke that uniformity, as they were covered with images of eyes. I even managed to make out *Le faux miroir* by René Magritte. Near the center of the room, with his back to me, stood the strange man. He was wearing a dark robe and… enormous wings extending from his back. I couldn’t make out the material, nor the exact way they emerged from his body.

Cold sweat ran down my spine as the situation grew increasingly bizarre. I must have caught him in the middle of a rehearsal or something.

“Welcome, Michael,” he said simply.

Despite how disturbing the situation was, I stepped inside, determined, demanding that he stop staging scenes, that this wasn’t one of his movies. I asked—almost shouting—that he explain that whole so-called “solution.” The man remained serene, which unsettled me even more. I approached him furiously, but just a few steps away I looked down at the floor. His feet were finally touching the ground, and since he was barefoot, a trail of bloody footprints marked the surface. I stopped short. I pulled my hand from my pocket, leaving the weapon behind, and took a step back.

Somewhat unsteady, I remember asking him:

“Why did you do this? What do you want? And why did you single me out? As far as I know, I’d never seen you in my life, you damn lunatic.”

He corrected me immediately:

“No, don’t call me that. Gabriel. It sounds better.”

He turned around and, with a paternal gaze, began to speak:

“Your singing. Your beautiful singing. That solo you performed last year in the church choir. And you—so immaculate, so devout, so serene. A true angel. Someone who would keep a secret. You won’t tell anyone, will you?”

Without losing his composure, he continued:

“The right angel.”

“You’re delusional! Everything—your films, your wings… You’ve been stalking me, haven’t you?” I shouted, stepping even closer.

The man—Gabriel? The angel?—didn’t flinch. In the same measured tone, he said:

“My angel certainly loves the world! But don’t worry—your purity will be restored.” He looked at me with a smile that, in another context, might have been tender. “I thank you, because thanks to you… I’m about to be free.”

Gabriel opened his robe and revealed one of the worst horrors I have ever seen. His skin was red and covered in welts, many of them burst and oozing blood and pus; in some areas, the flesh was sloughing off in pieces. The sight was unbearable: the man’s body was a bloody, unrecognizable mass. Looking closer, I noticed movement beneath it all. At first it was hard to distinguish amid so much fluid, but there was no doubt—small larvae crawled all over his chest. I fought the urge to vomit and stifled a scream of terror.

“You came for this, didn’t you?” He was holding a jar of ointment. “We ourselves are the raw material.”

He walked toward me as if stepping on thorns, leaving footprints behind him. He extended his hand, offering me another container of ointment. I took it hesitantly. What choice did I have? It was the only thing that gave me relief. I saw some larvae up close, crawling out from the sleeve of his robe, and an even more violent itch overtook my skin.

I ran. I fled the place in terror. I couldn’t believe what I had witnessed. Everything calculated, as if it were one of his film scenes. How long before I end up like Gabriel? Will I survive?

When I got home, I stared at my increasingly deteriorated appearance in the mirror. I smashed my fists against it in frustration, and a single thought—one that terrified and comforted me at the same time—crossed my mind:

“No. I’m not going to be the only one to live with this.”
