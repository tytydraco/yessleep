Darkness had come early that cold autumn night. Buck had been lying in bed watching funny internet videos like all teens his day did. He had figured it was about time to go to bed when he heard the unmistakable cry of the hen house in an uproar. Now, Pa was out helping his brother the county over, and so that left Buck in charge of making sure the family was safe. He knew that mama was out at her night job, but he could hear his sister in the other room singing to something in what Buck could only assume was horribly bastardized Korean. So, Buck hopped out of bed, tossed on his old Carhartt jacket, grabbed a charged headlamp, an axe, a snack, and headed toward the henhouse.

Buck didn’t mind chickens, but these ones, these were the meanest birds this side of the Colorado. Well, except for the old lady the house over, as a matter of fact, Buck was sure these birds had just as many cases of assault as her.

 He realized the hen house was completely silent, which was a far cry different from how it was before he stepped outside. In all honesty It was probably a fox, little critters were always scaring chickens. Of course, he thought that up until he saw the blood. The whole side of the hen house had been torn off. Well, it wasn’t foxes, and the damage was too much to have been done by a black bear. Buck thought it might have been a brown bear that had migrated there but that didn’t explain why some of the side boards looked as though they had been pulled off by hand.

No claw marks on them, not broken, the nails were bent as if it had been pried off from the side. Whatever it was, it had hands and the muscle to tear a finely constructed hen house, which Buck took no small amount of pride in said construction, asunder. So what? A silverback gorilla decided to swim across the Atlantic and walk to the middle of the states? Or maybe bigfoot was tired of his ocean view in Washington and decided to hike east? 

A chicken squawked from the tree line and Buck wheeled around towards it. There was so much blood. Too much. The chickens were gone, all that was left was whichever one was in the woods. Against all better judgment and basic instincts of self-preservation, Buck decided to find it. He scanned the trees and crouched down. He tried his best to watch where he stepped in an attempt to make the least amount of noise possible. The light of his headlamp awoke the ancient pines from their deep slumber, rousing their leaves and branches to stretch in the wind as they broke free of the restraint of darkness.

Buck checked the tracks, the blood wore thin, occasional feathers littered the trail like breadcrumbs, but they too started to become a rarity. snapped branches marked trees and a coarse gray fur was snagged on bark. Buck came upon a muddy patch on the ground. The print that was made there made his heart sink; It was a hand. Maybe it *was* a gorilla.

It was longer than Buck’s size twelve work boot and around three times wider. He realized that his house lights were no longer illuminating around him and how far into the brush he actually was. Buck decided that it would be in his best interest to leave. Before he could turn around the sound of a branch snapping along with what he could only describe as the cry of a boar mixed with the scream of a dying woman pierced Buck to his very core.

Buck broke into a sprint. He dodged roots and boulders as he heard the cry of what sounded like the earth behind him tearing open, trees fell around him, and great swaths of dirt and rock were thrown at his back in his desperate attempt to flee. The scream, God, the scream of whatever it was ripped into him; every primal instinct passed on from generation to generation told him to run. He slid down a switchback and caught a branch right above his brow; he felt the bite of the wind tear at his face as blood ran into his eye. Buck had to lose this thing. He passed an old overgrown van, and he knew exactly where he was.

 There was a cliff up ahead. A drop off that fell into an old quarry made a lake. If he was going to lose this thing, whatever it was, It’d be there. Buck and his friends would go there all the time to swim and make poor choices. They had always talked about jumping from the top of the cliff, the lake was plenty deep, but the jump was a hundred and thirty feet high. It looked like Buck had no choice. Buck, now driven by a goal rather than fear, found it in himself to run even harder. His legs burned and he felt the stomach-churning spike of adrenaline coursing through his veins. Buck rounded a bend and heard another bone chilling screech as whatever it was splintered the tall elder pines. The clearing was up ahead. A cliff that led to the edge of the world and the endless abyss below it; Buck had no choice. 

He jumped.

As soon as he left the ground Buck felt something slam into his back and grip him. He looked down to see a massive, gnarled hand made from misshapen flesh and exposed bone as the creature turned him to face it.

In Buck’s hands he still carried the axe he had brought all the way from home. In a frantic, adrenaline-fueled swing, Buck drove the axe into the creature’s face. The headlight blared into what looked like a blood and sinew covered elk skull. It screamed in raucous pain with the voice of a choir of damned souls as the axe lodged itself into it’s face. The creature dropped Buck off the cliff as it covered it’s head with a dozen hands. For a second, Buck didn’t realize he was falling as the shock of what he had seen washed over him only for a new shock to spread as he plummeted into an abyss. He straightened his legs, crossed his arms, and prayed just before he hit the water.

The darkness shined a bright white for just a second as the water crashed into him. He swam up, his headlamp had been torn from his head, and he was unsure if the water above him would ever end until his head breached the surface. He coughed and sputtered up water and swam to what he approximated where shore was. Now, Buck was familiar with this area, from where he washed up to, he knew more or less how to find his way back to town. There was an old quarry road that led up to a main one. Buck tripped over something and fell into something wet and squishy. It stunk like something rotting. The clouds overhead that hid the moon away broke and the blessed light exposed pure horror as Buck reeled back in terror; it was a carcass.

It had been here for a while. It’s head, arms, legs, and skin had all been torn off. Buck looked around. There had to be six to seven bodies there. Mangled camouflage tents and broken rifles were strewn about. The fact that they had been hunting out of season led Buck to assume it was likely a group of poachers; they had been a problem in these parts for years, though it seemed as though the poachers were no more than barely recognizable meat now. Buck looked away; he felt something trying to come back up from dinner, but he kept it down.

He didn't have time to be scared, he didn't have time to be disgusted, he just needed to keep moving. He followed the familiar gravel path as the adrenaline started to wear down. His whole body ached, and his legs could barely trudge on, constantly threatening Buck to collapse underneath him in a fit of agony. Buck thought of his little sister who was still at home by herself. He gritted his teeth and moved faster. He needed to get to town, out of these accursed pines that threatened to swallow him up like some beast more threatening and terrifying than the one that hunted him. The clouds hid the moon once more and light simply vanished. What little night vision Buck had was swallowed by the oppressive black. He felt his way along the road, he kept to the feeling of the gravel’s crunch and as soon as he was comfortable walking, he started to jog. 

He needed to get home. His little sister was probably still up, singing Korean pop songs, unaware that she was ringing the dinner bell to whatever the hell that thing was. Buck kept it up for around twenty minutes. Three miles of darkness and single-minded focus; he had to get home. His lungs burned and his legs ached. The wound above his eye had finally clotted, not without covering one side of his face like warpaint. If it weren’t for his running, he would have been freezing and he wasn’t sure if his clothes were soaked with water or sweat at this point. On top of that it had decided to rain, not a simple sprinkle, or a light refreshing fall, but a deluge so heavy that Buck wasn’t sure if he needed to start building an ark or not.

The top of the berm was lit with the many lights of town, though he doubted if anyone would even be around at this time. Maybe it was for the best, less targets and all that, but then again, practically everyone was armed, not that it seemed to help the poor fellas down by the lake. The closest building was a little diner, Buck would sometimes stop there after school if he could afford it and the lady that ran the place was one of the nicest people he knew. Maybe he could stop there and call the sheriff. He made his way from the top of the woods towards the sweet embrace of civilization. As he came closer, the feeling of comfort from seeing such a place was torn from underneath him as he realized the state of the place. The front doors had been ripped from their hinges as if a truck had barreled through them. Buck stopped and listened as best he could through the rain as he tried to keep his heart from jumping out of his throat from his run. An old station wagon sat in front. Buck was pretty sure that it belonged to the owner.

Buck’s heart sank.

Was she still in there? Buck creeped closer. The windows closest to the doors had been shattered and a single flickering light tried its best to illuminate the building. His boots crunched on broken glass as he crept inside. 

“Heidi?” Buck called out as quietly as he could.

The tables and chairs that sat away from the doors hadn’t been touched, the counter up front was a different story. Buck skulked behind what was left of the counter and immediately saw the corpse. It was missing its arms, legs, and head just like the poachers. A blood-stained nametag read out “Heidi.” Buck grimaced and turned his head. 

“Shit.” Buck whimpered.

He started to breathe harder as he sat down across from what was once Heidi. Buck held his head in his hands. What the hell was going on? It had to be some sort of horrible dream, some terrible nightmare caused by too much tv like momma always told him. But his body was sore and cold. This was reality and it was awful.

He needed to get home. 

When he made it there then he could try to rationalize things, but right now it wasn’t time to dwell on what was unimportant, like what was real or not. On the ground sat a landline phone that had been knocked off of the charger. He snatched it up and dialed 911. 

“We’re sorry, the number you’re trying to rea-”

The phone lines were out.

A soul-wrenching roar made of a cacophony of voices ripped through the silence. Buck peaked his head up to see a four-legged creature gallop across the road. He could barely get a half-decent look as it crossed the dark street towards him. 

“Shit!” Buck hissed as he stood as quickly as he could.

Buck reached up and flipped the switch to extinguish the flickering light above him. He clambered on his hands and knees through the door leading into the kitchen. He was immediately bludgeoned by the smell of rotting eggs; a gas pipe had burst at some point prior. He looked around for a moment, fryers, fridges, stove, toaster, shelves, storage room. Buck heard the creature enter. It grunted with the same shriek of a dying woman. Buck entered the storage closet as quietly as he could.

“Hello?” a voice called out, that while raspy, was unmistakably Heidi; and yet disturbingly off. As if it was a poor imitation of something trying for its first time to be human. 

“Is anybody there?”

Buck hadn’t closed the door all the way for the fear of the latch making a noise. He started to feel woozy, likely from the gas tainted air. He watched from the crack as the bright fluorescent bulb to the kitchen was turned on and something opened the order window for something to snake its way through it. It dripped blood from along its length. At the end was something covered in blood-soaked hair. It twitched and from under the hair revealed a pierced ear. It turned towards Buck as it scanned the room; It was Heidi, oh God, it was Heidi. Her head had been mounted on whatever this creature was like some sort of macabre trophy as it slithered on its bony appendage. Her eyes moved, her mouth grimaced. From where her neck was supposed to be, a tendril of dripping red meat. The smell, like a pile of corpses sitting in the summer sun, assaulted Buck’s senses. Heidi’s mouth moved as if she was practicing what she was going to say before she said it. She looked at where Buck hid.

“Hello?”

The sound of a police siren approaching broke the silence and the face before Buck snarled like an animal before pulling itself at great speeds out of the order window. The creature’s howl filled the air as it ran towards the offending noise. Buck released the breath he didn’t realize he was holding in before tearing open the door and looking out at the scene. It was probably Officer Harris, Buck’s dad was out of town, and the sheriff was old and had earned his right of not being up at this hour. Every fiber of Buck’s being told him to run, to just leave and use the distraction to buy him some time. But if he did, Officer Harris would be dead, and it’d be his fault. Buck grit his teeth as he looked around and knew what he could do.

The diner was filled with flammable gas and was ready to go at any moment. He slammed the shutter over the order window closed once more and unlocked the back door. Buck’s head was already swimming by the time he shoved a rolled-up sheet of newspaper into the toaster. Once he pressed down on that lever, he had a few seconds tops before Buck made the diner, and everything in a short radius, disappear. 

Buck heard the sound of gunshots and unholy roaring. It may have been the gas, but he felt ready. He opened the kitchen door and ran to the entrance where he saw the creature slam itself into the police car’s side. Buck picked up a rock and threw it as hard as he could at the creature.

“Hey! Over here!” Buck yelled

The creature turned towards him. The high beams of the cop car obscured its massive figure. Buck threw another rock.

“Come and get me you big Fuck!”

That set it off. The creature reared back on its hind legs, where it stood maybe fifteen feet off of the ground and roared, like some unholy monument to mankind’s sins.

Buck ran back inside the building and through the kitchen. He turned as he closed the kitchen door and saw the creature barreling towards him.

“Shit!” Buck yelled as he pressed down on the toaster lever and ran out the back door and kept running. He heard the creature slam into the wall behind him with a muffled cry. 

Buck begged God for it to work, he promised that he’d be good, that he’d listen to his mom and dad more. Not more than five seconds later did everything go white, and he was thrown on his face. For a second Buck was deaf, a ring in his ears that slowly went away as he looked back at his handiwork. 

No more diner, No more monster, No more hands. Buck tried to catch his breath and then remembered Officer Harris. He ran back around to the squad car. The lights we’re still on but inside it was still, the glare of the headlights concealed the damage. The windshield had been smashed in. He looked inside to see Officer Harris slumped over his wheel, his face looked as if it had been punched through.

 He was dead.

Buck hobbled his way back towards home, his ears still ringing, and his clothes still soaked. On the plus side it had stopped raining. He didn’t rightfully know what to do next. People no doubt heard that explosion and would go to check, if not now, then in the slow approaching morning.

Buck was tired, he had been running on adrenaline and pure defiance for the past hour. 

He spotted a bike on the side of the road, he knew who it belonged to, but for the time being it belonged to him as he made his way back home. He pulled out his key and opened the door.

“Mom?” his sister called out.

He began to cry. Buck’s sister came downstairs and stopped when she caught sight of him.

“Oh my God, what happened to you?”

Buck took off his soaking coat and boots and wiped his eyes.

“I don’t know. I’ll have to explain in the morning.”

A knock at the door interrupted their silence. Buck silenced his sister with a hand as he listened intently. The smell of corpses seeped from behind the door and a voice that sounded like his mother's but most definitely was *not* his mother's, spoke.

“Buck? Is that you?”
