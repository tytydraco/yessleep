I never wanted a roommate. But after my girlfriend, Emily, moved out unexpectedly, I couldn’t afford the rent on my own. So when I saw the ad—“Female seeking quiet, respectful roommate, private room, cheap rent”—I didn’t hesitate. The price was too good to pass up.

The next day, I met her. Anna was quiet and reserved, but something about her seemed off. She never made much eye contact, and her voice was barely above a whisper. Still, I figured it was none of my business. As long as she paid her share and didn’t bother me, I could live with it.

The first night in the apartment was quiet. Too quiet. I could hear every creak in the old building, every gust of wind rattling the windows. But Anna was nowhere to be seen. Her bedroom door stayed shut, and I never heard her move around.

By the second week, strange things started happening. At first, it was small—items misplaced, lights flickering. Then I started noticing odd sounds, like someone walking slowly in the hallway. I assumed it was Anna, though I rarely saw her. She was either always out or hiding in her room.

One night, I woke up to the sound of faint whispering. It was coming from the hallway. I got up, heart racing, and opened my door. The hallway was empty, but the whispers didn’t stop. They were coming from Anna’s room.

“Anna?” I called, but no response.

I knocked on her door. The whispering stopped. Something about the sudden silence chilled me. I decided to leave it alone and go back to bed, convincing myself it was just my imagination.

A few nights later, I came home late and found her standing in the kitchen, staring at the wall. She didn’t move, didn’t acknowledge me. I cleared my throat, trying to break the tension. 

"Hey, Anna. Everything okay?"

Slowly, she turned to face me. Her eyes were wide, unblinking, her face pale like she hadn’t seen the sun in days. She didn’t say anything—just stood there, watching. It sent a shiver down my spine.

"Anna?" I asked again, more forcefully.

She blinked, finally breaking her eerie stare, then without a word, turned and walked away, disappearing into her room.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Things escalated quickly after that. I’d wake up in the middle of the night to find my door open, though I was sure I’d locked it. Footsteps echoed outside my room, pacing up and down the hallway. The whispering returned, louder this time, almost like chanting.

I decided I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to confront her. 

The next morning, I knocked on her door, more insistent this time. No answer. I tried again. Nothing. 

Finally, I turned the knob—it was unlocked.

The room was empty. No bed, no furniture, no clothes. It looked like no one had ever lived there. My heart pounded in my chest as I stepped inside, trying to make sense of it.

That’s when I saw it. On the wall, carved deep into the plaster, was a single word: *Emily.*

My phone buzzed. It was a text from my ex, Emily.

“I need to tell you something. Stay away from Anna.”

I stared at the message, my hands shaking. How did she know about Anna? 

Before I could respond, another text came through.

“She’s not real.”

Suddenly, the whispering returned, louder than ever, surrounding me from all directions. I stumbled back, tripping over my feet as the door slammed shut behind me.

And then, a voice—Anna’s voice, but twisted, distorted—filled the room:

“You should have left when she did.”

The lights flickered, and I felt a cold breath on the back of my neck. I turned, but there was no one there. Just the empty room... and the whispering, echoing in my ears.

I bolted for the door, yanking it open and running out of the apartment. I never looked back.

The next day, I broke the lease and moved out. I tried calling Emily, but her number was disconnected.

To this day, I don’t know who—or what—Anna was. But sometimes, late at night, I still hear the whispers.
