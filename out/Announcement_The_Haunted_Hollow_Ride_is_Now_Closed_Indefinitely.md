The sirens whooped and flashed as a voice came over the speaker:


*"Attendants, please leave the park now. Follow the exit signs or ask a staff member for assistance."*


The crowd surged as one—shoulders colliding, feet scrambling. A man tumbled to the ground. Children cried out for their parents, and I clutched my daughter, Casey, tightly.


*"Remain calm—you’re not in immediate danger,"* the speaker repeated, but the words rang hollow amid the pandemonium.


We’d been at Abbot's Amusement for two hours, enjoying the perks of our premium ride pass. My wife, Sam, had spent the afternoon capturing happy moments with mascots and snapping pictures of Casey. Just moments before, we’d laughed over massive turkey legs—Happy memories—Fun memories.


A teenage girl burst past us, her denim skirt soaked in blood.


*"Please exit the Haunted Hollow zone. Our staff will update you shortly,"* the speaker announced again.


Sam had been waiting by Azazel's Mansion while I took Casey to the bathroom. I remembered her teasing, "Don't be too long or I might go on without you," as we joked about her aversion to all things macabre. Now, with my heart pounding and fear setting in, I recalled my last words to her—that I’d never be more proud if she did something reckless.


The park transformed into a warzone. Cast members dressed as a demon and a vampire—drenched in what I desperately hoped was fake blood—stumbled out of Haunted Hollow. I shielded Casey’s eyes, whispering, "Don’t look, sweetie." But the terror was too tangible; the blood, the screams, and the frantic shoving all melded into a single, suffocating nightmare.


Desperation demanded refuge. Overcrowded turnstiles and panicked shouts meant we couldn’t escape through the usual exits. Then a voice cut through the noise: "Over here!" A woman in the park's orange and white uniform beckoned us to an information booth. I raced over, and she quickly locked the door behind us.


Her name tag read Felisha. "Are you folks okay?" she asked, her tone gentle despite the chaos outside.


"We are now—you saved us. What the hell is going on?" I asked.


"All I’m hearing is chatter on the group chat" Felisha replied, her eyes flicking to the chaos outside. "They’re calling ambulances. Something’s gone wrong at Azazel's Mansion."


My stomach churned. Sam was there. Without a second thought, I blurted, "My wife’s in there—I have to get her."


"Go," she urged. "Your daughter is safe with me, I promise."


I hesitated only a moment before darting back into the madness. Near Haunted Hollow, the siren fell abruptly silent. I found staff and security clustering around Azazel's Mansion—smoke billowing from shattered windows and fire casting a sickly glow from within. People lay injured on the ground, and every face was etched with disbelief.


I asked a guard, "Is anybody still in there? I’m looking for my wife."


"Everyone who could leave has exited," he replied calmly. "This is an ongoing situation—we’ll update you when we know more."


"Everyone who could leave—what the hell does that mean?" I shouted. Before he could answer further, I pushed past him and bolted toward a darkened corridor marked by a heavy, black curtain.


Inside, the world was a nightmare in motion. Faux lightning flickered over coffins and cobwebbed corridors. The flicker of candlelight danced over cracked, time-worn wallpaper as smoke burned my eyes. In that disorienting haze, laughter echoed from somewhere unseen.


"Hello?" I croaked, my voice barely carrying over the flicker of fire and distant screams. I had to move quickly.


A carriage lay upturned, strewn with dismembered limbs and stained with fresh, dark blood. I frantically scanned the scattered debris—discarded shoes, a torn scarf—seeking any sign of Sam, but found nothing. Every step further revealed more grotesque details: sinister portraits with eyes that seemed to follow, mirrors shattered into jagged fragments, and animatronic figures in dark corners.


"Sam, are you in here?" I pleaded.


I ducked through another black curtain into a room that resembled an abandoned hospital. Chained walls and a lone operating chair set the stage for a macabre scene. The laughter came again—more insistent this time—until it split the silence.


"Heya there, buckaroo," a voice mocked from the shadows.


I spun around. Next to the operating chair stood an animatronic clown. Its glass eyes shone with an eerie, lifelike glimmer that sent shivers down my spine. In a moment both surreal and horrifying, its mouth dropped open and it emitted a mechanical chuckle—*"Hahahahahahaha.”* The clown’s hand moved in a jerky, stop-motion fashion, revealing sharp metal fingers as it removed a glove.


Before I could react, the room’s dense smoke swallowed everything. The clown vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. Panic surged through me, and I dashed through another black curtain into a mock carnival area. Here, balloon darts, bean bag toss, and dancing clowns should have inspired delight, but now they served as cruel reminders of the madness. Amid dragging metal sounds and the echo of deranged laughter, I collapsed to my knees—gasping for clean air.


There was one last black curtain. Crawling, every muscle screaming in protest, I edged forward until a sliver of daylight beckoned through a tear in the fabric. With a surge of desperate strength, I pushed myself upright and burst through the curtain, emerging onto the park grounds once more.


A guard immediately grabbed my arm. "I told you to stay out! I'll cuff you if I need to."


"There's a clown—an animatronic one—that moved from room to room," I insisted, my voice trembling. He regarded me skeptically, then glanced down at the blood on my shoes.


Just then, a familiar voice shouted, "Peter! Do you have Casey? Is she okay?"


I was filled with relief as I turned to see Sam, her face pale but composed.


"She's at the information booth. What happened?" 


"I didn’t get on the ride," Sam replied, her voice quavering, "but there were screams, so much blood—" Her words trailed off as she wrapped her arms around me, the shock still too fresh to process.


Later, local news reported that a catastrophic mechanical failure had injured ride-goers and sparked a fire. The ride was permanently closed, and the park shuttered for months. They stripped the ride and stored its parts in a warehouse. When I inquired about the animatronic clown—if it too was packed away—the staff dismissed it with a cryptic, "There were no clowns in Azazel's Mansion."
