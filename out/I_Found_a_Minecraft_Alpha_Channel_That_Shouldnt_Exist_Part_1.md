I don’t know where else to post this. If it gets removed, fine. I just need someone to know this happened.

I’ve been obsessed with Minecraft since I was a kid. I grew up with the game—back when the terrain was weird and music would randomly haunt you mid-build. You know, the Alpha days. Lately, I’ve been revisiting that era. There’s something comforting about the crude graphics and lonely silence.

Last weekend, I was trawling old forums and Reddit threads about Alpha nostalgia when I found a link to a YouTube channel I’d never heard of. It was just called “_alphabuilder_199”. No profile pic. Just that default gray icon. The banner was black. No description, no socials. Only 6 videos. 

The thumbnails were nothing special—just Alpha screenshots. Each video was titled like a log entry:
“LOG_1: First night.”
“LOG_2: Water Temple.”
“LOG_3: It sees me.”

I clicked the first one, expecting some cringy roleplay or low-res let's play. But the resolution was...off. It wasn’t bad, just wrong. It looked like it was recorded on a version of Alpha I’d never seen. The colors were slightly desaturated, the clouds didn’t move, and the moon seemed too detailed.

In “LOG_1,” the player spawned in a normal-looking forest. No commentary, no music. Just the wind. Which is weird because Alpha didn’t have wind sounds. You could hear  leaves rustling, branches cracking. The player built a basic dirt hut, crafted a wooden sword, and stood still. For a full two minutes. At the very end, right before it cut to black, you could faintly hear someone whisper:
“...stay inside.”

The next video, “LOG_2: Water Temple,” started in the same world, days later. The player walked to a lake and dove underwater. There, beneath the surface, was an obsidian structure. That alone is strange for Alpha—it didn’t have generated temples. The player swam inside. No mobs. Just a long hallway, lined with glowstone. Then, a sign:
“You shouldn’t be here.”
The player turned around. Behind them, another sign had appeared:
“You brought it back.”

That’s when the screen started glitching. Not lag. Not buffering. Actual visual tearing—like something was trying to crawl through the pixels. I heard something else too. Breathing. Wet, rasping breathing. It grew louder with each frame. Then the video just stopped. No outro. No fade. Just hard cut to black.

I went to the comments, but they were all blank. Literally empty. Like YouTube had wiped them clean—except for one:
“log_7 will upload when he sleeps again.”
It was posted an hour ago.

There wasn’t a log_7. Not yet. The latest was “LOG_6: Underneath Me.” I clicked it, and my heart dropped. The player wasn’t in Minecraft anymore.

The video opened with someone holding a camera, shaky and unfocused. It was pointed at a computer screen—their computer screen. I recognized the desktop icons. It was...mine.

They clicked on a shortcut that doesn’t exist on my PC, labeled “Launch_Alpha199.exe.” The game launched. It looked like normal Minecraft Alpha at first. But then I saw the skin. The character model didn’t have a face. Just a blurry texture, like something scribbled over it in MS Paint.

The person in the video turned the webcam toward themselves. I swear to God—it looked like me. But their eyes were glazed over, lips moving like they were muttering something. The audio was warped. Slowed down. Reverse whispers and some kind of chanting.

Then they said, clearly:
“He sees you now. Don’t sleep near glass.”

The screen glitched violently. I closed the tab.

I ran a virus scan. Nothing. I searched for the channel again. Gone.
404. Channel does not exist.

I even checked my YouTube history. Nothing.
But when I checked my desktop…

A new shortcut was there.
Launch_Alpha199.exe.

I didn’t put it there.
I haven’t touched it. I won’t. But I keep hearing things—at night. Sounds like blocks breaking. Breathing through headphones that aren’t plugged in.

If you see that channel, don’t watch anything past Log_3.
And whatever you do…

Don’t fall asleep facing your screen
