Hi guys! Camera Guy here! Before I pick up where we left off, I feel like I should go a little further into detail about a few things I mentioned. I really glossed over the first week and I feel like that might be moving things a touch fast for everything to make sense. Before I get into it definitely check out my first post here [\[HERE\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ouibmo/im_a_camera_guy_for_a_local_reality_show_and_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)



As you know I'm the camera man for a local TV show in Mattoon, IL. The group I work/live with are called the DealFinderz, they're really serious about their deals. It's sort of religious for them, we don't really get anything from anywhere unless it's at least portrayed as a deal. I'm certainly not good with money type stuff–which is probably clear from the 200k debt. From what I can tell not everyone is actually related aside from Tony and Jerome, they're actually brothers.



Danny is an interesting character in our little family, he really doesn't talk much. He mostly just broods staring at people, it's not super fun trying to go to the bathroom at night with your roommate just staring into your soul; I seem to be the only one who's bothered by it. Every once in a while though, Danny will get a burst of energy, being really happy and almost childlike playing around but out of nowhere he'll just go back into his observant state. His room is pretty basic with only a large bed and a TV on top of his dresser with the blinds always closed. He'll leave the house for periods of time but I don't think he has a job or anything so I'm really not sure what he's out doing.

	

Jerome is a very interesting member. He seems wise beyond his years and usually has very thought provoking things to say. A strange thing about him is that he doesn't have his own room and also doesn't sleep, like ever. He's usually just sitting on the couch with a beer or out chain smoking on the front stoop. Much like Danny he sort of gets these little spurts of energy where he gets super unpredictable and even a little “frisky”. He's also been known to randomly slip stuff like “Shii I'm in the K hole blud” into conversations and just not follow up on it. Another one he says that makes me laugh is “Call me the mole man the way I'm in these holes” even though I don't know what it means.



He's got a special “job” within our network. He's in charge of doing mission trips where he goes out and either spreads the Deal Finder idealz or sometimes even recruiting new members so he's gone a lot of the time. I'm assuming that's why he hadn't seen Tony in 10 years. Still though, 10 years is a long time to be away, he would have had to have been a teenager when he left.



Finally we get to Tony, the one who has a keen sense of what is and isn't a deal and where one might be found. He's got this magnificence about him that I have trouble putting into words. Imagine if every parasocial figure, whether it be your favorite celebrity, politician or even religious figure were all rolled into one conceivable form. He has this uncanny ability to compel the affection of those close to him, so much so that they would do anything to help him achieve his goals. 



On the flip side of this he also has a capacity to be like seriously actually scary, like one missed step would have him ready to end you. I really don't like to let him down, especially after everything he's done for me.



Another thing I would like to add to his deal finding style is that he doesn't like to haggle. I can see that you would think something like, “if he doesn't barter he's obviously not getting the best deal.” I completely understand that mindset but in Tony's words, “convincing others to accept less capital for their product is directly engaging in capitalist oppression.” I can't even begin to fully take in the scope of the complex philosophy of how deal finderz operate. 



Now that these character bios are out of the way I should definitely hop back into the broken TV and how my perspective on what was possible in this world have been broken……. forever.



**Episode 3: The Great TV Deal of 2020**



As I mentioned in my last entry, Tony had smashed his head into the living room TV because it had betrayed him.



Tony calmed down a little bit. He got a call from his associate, who he refuses to name, about a great TV deal. Just in time, considering ours was just broken. I'm not sure where Jerome had gone, but he mentioned something about ‘mission trips’ a few days ago? So that might have been what he was up to. We start rolling to get our intro out of the way, and Tony begins by stating, “For this deal we're gonna need a whole crew, that of course means we needed to break our mysterious friend in the far room out of containment.” 



Without wasting a moment Tony barges into the room–that is still very much destroyed. Tony shouts, “Ben! We're breaking you out!” 



Ben, who I had been sharing a wall with this whole time, had a strange presence about him. He's built like a football player, I'm sure if he wanted to he could definitely punch a hole through someone's face. The air around him feels thick and heavy almost like his presence can suppress the strength around him if he wills it to be so. After he is introduced to the show, Danny, in one of his energetic states, scampers behind towards the living room. “Just in time,” Tony says proudly before walking back to the front of the house. We do a character intro for Danny saying he's a new recruit purely because he hasn't been featured yet. He *was* newer but not newer than me. When Tony gives his proposition to Danny he says “with us we have Ben and,” turning to me. After what had just conspired I was definitely still shaken, Tony stared holes into me as I responded, clearly dejected. 



“...Camera Guy.” Tony grits his teeth, “Camera Guy Dealzman, my god. What a name.” 



We all pile into the “Dealz Mobile” and strangely Ben is the one driving. This being the same guy that was locked in containment because of his alleged danger. He drove just fine from my perspective, maybe a little excited but that's it.



Once we get to the local Walmart, we set up an intro shot. Tony's Walmart introduction goes as follows: “We have arrived in the accursed realm,” as I pan over to the shimmering glow of the Walmart Sign. I added a little dark souls new area sound effect to be a little cheeky, like Walmart was scary or full of zombies or something. ‘Only thing scary in there is my boss if he doesn't get his deal. Anyways, Tony walks into the new frame as Danny and Ben walk towards the store, Ben with his ass crack out, which I thought was pretty funny. 



“I fucking hate this place,” Tony says in pure disgust, before matching pace of the other two.



After much deliberation and much-er counsel on which TV to get, including epic lines like, “If it's curved, then it's a Deal,” from Tony, “Now that's a god damn Deeeeal,” from Danny. And of course, who could forget, “Bigger than *mine*… My *Dick*” from Ben. Moving on from all of that, we reached a nexus in the conversation, leading to a new proposal from Ben to Tony. Ben tells Tony that he would be willing to foot the entire bill on the new TV; if he could put *his* old TV in the living room, and take the new one into his room. Also saying because he's a Chad.



 Before he could get to *that* though, Ben puts his hand on Tony's shoulder, sending Tony into a controlled rage like a panther getting ready to strike. “Don't Fucking Touch Me,” he spits out, much like his state from earlier. I could’ve sworn his eyes sort of sparkled a golden amber color for a second. Then there was Danny, standing just behind them, in the middle of the frame, just… staring at me… for the whole shot. Hand over hand, silently watching. The footage from this segment got really degraded while all this was happening, by the way. I know it's strange to say, but I could sort of feel what static grain looked like at that moment. The air around them had changed. [\[IMAGE\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnfathomableDarkness/comments/1p1emde/episode_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)



“Sorry, Tony. I know you don't like that.” Ben says with a smile, almost prodding Tony's feelings. Tony just stays quiet, listening to his words. As soon as Ben gets back to the part about putting his TV in the living room, Tony looks back at Ben and with a deep southern drawl says, “It would be in danger of becoming quite personal with muh forehead, very personal with muh forehead.” While intense, it made us all have a little laugh. Ben then turns to Tony, “Are you crying? Zoom in on this man's eyes,” as a joke and I do so. Tony, in tears once again, cried out, “The TV betrayed me.”  



You would think this conversation had meant we had found our deal, but that's not really how it works when there's multiple dealfinderz together. We go back to the TV wall and get back to looking, Ben points out one TV while Tony points to another, “I think that's the TV my dad bought…” Tony turns to me.



 “My dad… who was killed.” I wasn’t sure if that was supposed to be a joke or not. 



Ben eventually picked the TV and put it in our cart. We got this slick little walking shot of Tony doing the twist while ‘You Wish’ by Nightmares on Wax plays. I like that song, it's cool.



 We actually did have one last stop though for the viewers at home. Tony points out a large TV with no price tag, completely free. Don't ask me why the deal guys didn't get the free TV, like I said, I don't really know how it works.



I also apologize for the way I’m giving information, I really am trying to put things in chronological order while also giving the correct context. But I flunked my creative writing classes back in college, so this is what you get. 



Any-who, we buy our TV and while I wait for them to get it all paid for, Tony then approaches me with something he wants to say specifically to the audience. “If I ever meet Adam A Walmart, **He will not be safe from the crusade of the Dealzmen. Not one soul will be spared.**” Keep in mind, I'm sitting on a bench when he says this, he’s standing over me, so I have to lean back to keep him in frame. Just like always, he swiftly turns off his serious demeanor and goes back to being everybody's best friend. We go back to the car with our Deal.



Ben was still being very bombastic in his way, joking and poking. I was definitely getting the vibe that Tony was getting fed up with his antics. 



When we are at the car to load up the TV, Ben calls Tony an asshole for not going with his bit about cracking open imaginary beers. This was the moment that really changed things for me. I had never thought I would see a man exhibit such power. As Tony turns back around after not responding to Ben’s comment, Ben announces, “So what? Are the shoes comin’ off?” With a grin a mile wide, Tony kicks off his shoes, one by one, and instantly charges, swinging a punch with the force of a truck square into Ben’s mouth. This was no ordinary punch, though. When Tony’s shoes came off, he started emitting these golden arcs from his body, almost like lightning. All of that energy traveled from his body, through his fist, and into Ben’s face in the blink of an eye. 



I was stunned, I think we all were. We had never seen anything like that in all of our lives collectively. Ben laid on the ground for a good 5 minutes, smoke emitting from his face before trying to get up. Tony told me not to help him up. I couldn’t keep those 5 minutes in the episode though, they were too scary. 



After Ben was up Tony, holding the TV, climbs into the back seat with Danny and shuts the door saying “Tony Dealzman got DA STRAT” completely moving past what just happened. Ben and I had a second alone and I gave him a bit of a moment to speak.  
  


  
  


“This is Ben Dealzman, uh… I think this is it for me. I-” He shakes his head in disbelief, “I think I-” He’s wiping tears, interrupting himself again. “I don’t think… I don’t think that this is gonna last much longer.” He says with a fake smile, “Our relationship as Deal Finderz… *Horrible*. He beats me at night… *Off*… He beats me off… We’re done here.”



That was a ton to process all at once, and I really didn’t have time for it, but at least I know what those sounds at night were. He gets in the car to do the episode outro, and lo and behold, I am left at the store again. With everything that just happened, I just felt defeated. I tried to suck up my tears as best I could, and started walking towards the house. They had an entire EDM dance party without me. I know it happened because it was in the footage pool that I recovered once we got to editing. It sure looked like fun. 



This reminds me though, I said the clip at the end of episode 2 was shot after episode 3 in my last post. That actually isn't true, I know, me sucking at my job here, big surprise. It's the weirdest thing, I remember being there, I remember trying to open a bottle of wine with Ben for hours and playing a ton of uno. But looking at that footage, nothing makes sense. Let's just say that there are characters from later in the show that could not have been there at that time. I didn't even get home until the start of episode 4, so Stewart couldn't have been there, Cal either. This doesn't make sense. I don’t really have a good explanation for this, I'm sorry.



I walked for about a day to get back home. It's a short car ride to Walmart, but a long walk. When I got home episode 4 was already underway. Everything happened so fast when I got there. New Deal Finderz and a lot of cryptic statements. Tony said we had to go, not just Walmart this time. 



We had to leave the state, right now.
