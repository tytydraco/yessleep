Being accepted into Wescroft University was one of the best and worst things that has happened to me. It was my dream school, one where 95% of all graduates land successful music gigs. Unfortunately, due to its reputation, the tuition was a nightmare, making even the thought of living in the dormitories an unrealistic option. I had to look for off-campus options, but due to my late application, I found out too late that the most convenient ones are usually the first to go, so the pickings were slim. 

Stressed and frustrated, I sat on the steps leading to the campus. Though my heart clenched at the possibility, I could only think of one option left, and that was to drop out.

Before I could wallow in self-pity, my eyes drifted over to the campus directory, a large, wooden bulletin board with various flyers and posters plastered all over it. The papers billowed in the wind, torn and crumbled at the edges. That was when something caught my eye. The paper looked ancient—yellowed, crumpled, like something torn from a forgotten will. The text was written with a brilliant hand, each letter painfully deliberate, each word a perfect, neat line.

"Housing available, roommate needed. Large home with many rooms. Prices start at $500. Inquiries can be sent to 15, East Lake Drive."

That was the address of the Holloway manor. The building was owned by the Holloways, the family that established and supported the school financially. With so many buildings named after them, it's puzzling why their living quarters were accessible to outsiders. My first instinct was to assume it was a scam, but desperation and a bit of optimism drove me to follow up on this ad anyway, just to make sure.

The trek wasn't the shortest, but it was also serene, as it went through a more natural path, giving me a great view of the lake. It was an impressive sight, huge and crystal blue, with water so clear you can see everything at the bottom. Despite its size, the lake was barren—no fish, no plants, not even insects.

Looming at the far edge, casting its reflection across the glassy water, was the manor. I stood in awe at the sheer size of this thing. It looked ancient, like it was from the turn of the 20th century. The condition left much to be desired, with cracked, rotting wood, moss and ivy growing over every surface, and chipped paint. A splotch of black on the side of the building caught my attention, which I recognized as the remnants of a fire. I knew I should've been scared or, at the very least, unnerved by the sight of this place. But instead, I found it fascinating. I guess the artist in me has a strange admiration for all things eerie.

I took a deep breath, my heart racing with both excitement and a tinge of trepidation. This could either be the solution to my problems or a complete waste of time. I made my way up the steps leading to the front door.

There was no doorbell, just a brass knocker in the center of the frame that looked like it was one bad tug away from crumbling. I didn't want to break the thing and have them sue me for the door, so I decided to just knock. I waited. The rustling leaves of the greenery around me drew my attention to the tree that seemed to be closing in on the property. It encased the house, wrangled branches reaching out like desperate arms to prevent any ray of sunlight from peeking through. Noon might as well be dusk for this place. As I leaned in to get a better look at the gnarled wood, I noticed that it had a distinct shade of crimson. I was by no means an expert on flora, but I didn't think that was a natural colour. Must've been a rich people thing, I concluded.

"Hello?" I was so entranced by the surrounding forest that the simple word was enough to cause me to flinch. Turning around, I saw a sunken blue eye peering from behind a crack in the door. I couldn't tell much about the girl on the other side, as the inside seemed pitch black. All I could see was her right eye, the corner of her chapped lips, and a set of pale fingers curled tightly around the door frame. Her skin was nearly translucent, faint blue veins webbed just beneath the surface. Her hair, long and blonde to the point of white, spilled over half her face like ink bleeding through paper.

"Oh, hi," I said, flashing my best smile, hoping to seem as friendly as possible, "I saw the ad you posted on the campus directory and was wondering if you had an opening?"

The girl kept quiet, thin eyebrows faintly furrowing. Then, as if remembering something, her eyes widened, and the door swung open, and I got a better look at her. She seemed my age, but considering the state of her appearance, I couldn't really tell. Her skin was that pale, and it wasn't just because of the lack of light. I'm not sure what caused it, but she looked malnourished, her bones and veins visible underneath that sallow complexion. It made her look fragile, sickly, yet there was an underlying beauty to her, not dissimilar to the manor itself.

Most curious of all were her eyes. Once I got past the deep bags obscuring them, I could make out a vibrant blue hue, and when the light hit them right, the irises seemed to shimmer with an unnatural quality that reminded me too much of the empty lake.

"The ad, yes..." She murmured, bringing a lithe thumb to her dry lips and gnawing on it absent-mindedly. "Would you like to come in?" I had to strain my ears to hear the words that fell from her lips.

In an awkward side shuffle, she moved aside, giving me room to step in. I entered the manor, and the first thing that struck me was how dark and empty the space was. There was furniture, sure, but it was scarce. A few tables, a chair, a bookshelf. Nothing else. I guess she wasn’t a fan of interior design. Speaking of, the girl seemed to have vanished, the sounds of shuffling coming from the room next over. She emerged holding a tray with two cups of tea, which she placed on the coffee table.

"Please sit down," she said softly, and I complied. As I sat, I noticed her eyes darting from my face to the chair. Her delicate fingers pushed the ceramic teacup closer to me, and I took a look at the contents inside. The brew was a dark gray colour with hints of green that gave off the faint smell of the sea. The sulphuric scent made my nose twitch, with a faint undertone of rust. I took a sip of the tea and found it to have a similar metallic tang, along with a texture that made the liquid cling to the sides of my mouth. It was strange and unusual, but I didn't want to seem rude. I forced myself to swallow it down, trying not to grimace too hard at the taste.

I felt a lump form in the back of my throat, and for a second, I thought that I was going to throw up. Instead, I managed to choke out, "Thank you. Nothing like a cup of strong tea to get the day started! What kind of leaves did you use, anyway?" The girl didn't respond. She was staring at me, her expression unreadable. After a moment of silence, she finally spoke.

"Oh. Mint, I think," Her voice came out raspy and strained, like she hadn't used it in a century. Setting down the cup of hopefully not fatal tea, I extended my hand to her.

"By the way, I'm Julian! Nice to meet you." It took her a second to process the gesture, and when she did, she placed her thin fingers into mine and gave a weak handshake. Her cold digits felt like ice in my hand.

"My name is Eden," Eden murmured, before quickly adding on, "Holloway. It's nice to meet you, too, Julian." Another period of silence. She didn't seem all that great at keeping conversations alive, but that wasn't a big deal to me.

"So, Eden," I began, leaning forward in the chair, "Are you a student at Wescroft?"

"No, no, I'm not currently pursuing higher education. I am homeschooled, so to speak," She replied, her voice still soft, yet more confident and articulate than before.

"Anyone else living here?" She shook her head. "Really? Isn't this house a bit big for just one person?" She shrugged her shoulders. This wasn't going anywhere. "Any competitors I have to fight for the spot?"

"No," Eden finally spoke, "You're the first to respond. I've had it up for a year now." Pity stabbed at my heart; it sounded like she was lonely. Considering how awkward she was, the poor thing must've had trouble socializing.

"Well, don't worry," I gave her a comforting smile. "I'm here now, and I'd like to be your new roommate!" She gave me a strange look. Like a deer in headlights.

"Are you sure? You don't want a tour?" She asked. I laughed at her response. It was cute how much she underestimated the desperation of the average college student.

"Listen, I'm not exactly in a position to be picky. You seem like a lovely girl, and the price is perfect. It just needs a little fixing up, but I can handle that." I grinned at her. She didn't respond, but the faintest of smiles tugged at the corners of her lips. I took that as a sign that I’d won her over. "It's 500 dollars a month, right?"

"Yes," Eden paused, dark eyes searching the sky for the answer, "I can lower it. 200. If you're comfortable." I stared at her, dumbfounded. She was already selling herself short, and now she was willing to lower the price even further? This was too good to be true, but I didn't want to take advantage of her kindness. Then again, I was in a tight spot, and 200 a month was practically a steal for such a large place.

"A-are you sure? I thought 500 was already too low! I mean, look at this house, it's huge! Are you sure you can afford to go that low?"

"Money isn't a concern. This is my family's estate."

"Right, the Holloways," I noted, eyebrows furrowed in thought. "Then why do you need a roommate?"

The rim of the cup stopped a hair short of her lips. She hesitated. Her eyes flitted to the floor. "It gets lonely. Here. Alone." The words fell from her lips in a soft whisper, clattering and disjointed. That was all the explanation I needed.

“Alright, guess that’s that then!” I clapped my hands together, "I'll move in as soon as possible."

That seemed to make her happy, because the ghost of a smile returned to her lips, and the faintest hint of blue crept onto her pale cheeks.

"Oh, uh, I am gonna be playing a lot of music. Is that gonna be-"

"Music is fine," She answered a little too quickly. "You can play whenever you want. The house tends to keep sounds in. The walls are thick. I won't hear much. And I like music."

"Awesome!" I beamed, standing up and extending my hand for another shake. Making sure not to accidentally crush the bones in her hands into dust by putting too much force, I gave her a firm shake. "Looking forward to rooming with you, Eden!"

She didn’t say anything—just watched me with that almost-smile as I stood up and walked to the door. I waited by the entrance, giving her a chance to see me off, but Eden just continued to blink, a slight tilt in her head.

"Right, uh..." I cleared my throat. "I'm gonna go back to the campus to grab my things. It's not much, just a few bags and a suitcase, but I'll be back by tomorrow morning."

"Okay," She repeated. I waited for a few more moments to see if she'd say anything else, but after a solid minute of her doing nothing but blinking at me, I decided to take my leave. She was... A little weird, but if bad tea and a staring problem was the worst I was going to get, I was pretty sure I was set.

It was dusk when I left, and the smell of the lake was overwhelming. Though the aftertaste of the tea remained, the sight of the lake distracted me. The sun was just starting to set, painting everything in a warm glow that contrasted heavily with the cold air.

I wouldn’t mind seeing this sight every time I returned home from a tiring day at school, I thought.

The next day, I quickly packed up all my belongings, bid my goodbyes to overpriced takeout and drab, concrete walls, and made my way back to the manor. I didn’t even reach the first step before the door swung open with a swift yet grating creak. Out came Eden, dressed in the same clothing from yesterday, hands clasped politely in front of her. The ends of her lips twitched up periodically, as if she were having difficulty maintaining a smile. She leaned forward, yet never made the effort to ever step foot outside.

"You're back," Eden stated.

"Well, of course," I grinned, lugging my suitcase up the stairs, "You can't get rid of me that easily."

Her eyes widened, and I could see her hands tense, their grip tightening. "Who... I don't want to get rid of you. I'd never do that." The way she said it should've been endearing, but I couldn't help but feel like she was trying to persuade me more than anything else.

"Oh, no, no, I didn't mean it literally," I chuckled, waiting for her to move aside so I could come through. But, she didn't. She just stood there, staring at me. "It's a joke, er, an expression. I just mean that I'm not leaving." Her shoulders relaxed, and she finally stepped aside to let me in. "Anyway, mind showing me my room?”

"Right. Of course." She mumbled, "Right this way." Eden guided me towards the living room, where the two of us had spoken. "This is the living room. You've already seen it. There's a bathroom to the left. You haven't." I nodded, making mental notes. "And that's the kitchen. That's where the food is." As she showed me around, I couldn't help but notice that the curtains were drawn, keeping most of the natural light out. Not only that, but there weren't any lights on, which made the house feel even more eerie.

"A little dark in here... Not a fan of the light?" She turned abruptly, pausing near one of the thick curtains. Gingerly, she pulled it aside, letting what little light there was spill through. Branches obscured the view, giving the whole thing an even more haunted look. "Ah... Well, you can keep them closed, if you want." With a curt nod, she pulled it closed and continued. That was when I spotted a door off to the side, tucked away in a corner.

"What's in there?" I asked, gesturing to the door. She looked at it, and her expression changed.

"Basement. It's messy. I haven't gone down in a while. Most certainly houses insects and critters. Probably mold and fungus. Maybe even rot. It's very old." She spoke with that strange cadence of hers, each word rolling off her tongue like a pebble falling from a cliff side. "You don't want to see it." It wasn't a suggestion, nor even a command. It was just a fact.

"Fair enough," I shrugged, following behind her again. She led me up the stairs, and I found myself standing in a hallway. It was long and narrow, with doors lining both sides.

"This is your room. Third door on the right," She said, stopping in front of my room. She opened it for me, and I was greeted with a fairly simple interior. Or, at least, it looked simple from a cursory glance. It contained a twin-sized bed, a wooden desk, and a modest closet, things every bedroom should have. But the more I looked at it, the more its oddities emerged. Beige walls with peeling wallpaper and a ceiling that felt several inches too short. I approached the desk, tracing my fingers over its surface to find it, surprisingly, not dusty. Eden must have cleaned it, or at the very least wiped it down. Still, the wood had nicks and cuts, the drawers were a little crooked, and the hinges were rusted.

However, all of that paled in comparison to the sight. The large windowsill overlooked the lake, giving a spectacular view of the clear, still waters, as well as the surrounding forest. I could feel my breath being taken away as I gazed out at the scenery. It was stunning.

"Do you like it?" Her voice broke me out of my reverie. I turned to her with an excited grin.

"Eden, it's perfect," I said, placing my luggage down and walking over to her, still facing the window. "I love it. Great view, as well. I'm glad those branches aren't covering it like they do the rest of the place." I joked, turning to face her. My smile immediately faltered when I saw the look in her eyes. Wide, anxious, as if I'd just said something that had deeply unsettled her. Her eyes flicked to the water—but only for a second. Then, like a guilty habit, she looked away, condemning herself from the view.

"What's wrong?" I asked, concerned. "Is there a problem? Was it the branch joke? Sorry, that wasn't-"

"I'm glad you like it,” Eden suddenly interjected, shifting her weight from foot to foot. "I'll leave you to unpack." And with that, she turned and left, leaving me alone in the room. I stared at the open door for a moment, before turning to my luggage and getting to work.

A few hours later, I had unpacked everything, and I was sitting on the bed, looking out the window. It was so peaceful, and the view was so calming. The type of scenery perfect for inspiring art. In fact, a burst of creativity surged through me right then and there, and I opened the case to my violin. My pride and joy. Cradling it like an infant, I took a seat by the window, letting the natural light wash over me.

Setting the bow atop the strings, I took a deep breath and drew the bow. A jarring twang cut through the air, and I physically flinched. That's not right. I had just tuned it to perfection the day before, and yet here it was, no different than the sound of nails on a chalkboard. Bowing the other strings yielded similar results, each one a high-pitched screech. It was as if the strings were broken. It didn't sound like when they were untuned, or if I had the wrong note, either. The sounds were clear and crisp. Just... Wrong. Like the walls rejected the note and spat it back at me with disdain.

I rested the violin on my lap and let out a slow, frustrated breath. I didn’t want to believe it was damaged, not this violin. Not the one that had been with me through every recital, every sleepless night of practice.

So I stood, brushing the dust from my pants, and made my way to the door. The second I cracked it open, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Eden was standing inches from the door frame, the shadows of the manor casting her in a ghastly light that seemed to make her sunken features sink even further.

"W-wow, um, hey, Eden! Good, uh, good evening." I chuckled, hoping that my voice wasn't shaking.

"Good evening," She echoed, her head tilted to the side. "Is something wrong? You don't sound happy."

"It’s nothing, just my violin's been acting up. I have no idea what's wrong with it," I raised the back of my finger to my lips, gently biting the knuckle. Her blue eyes trailed to the act before rising back to meet my gaze.

"Oh. Yes. It doesn't respond well to music. The house, that is. I think it might have absorbed most of the noise."

"Absorbed? What do you mean?" I asked.

"The structure is not normal. Hollow, I think. Doesn't respond well to sounds. Especially music. The living room is the best place to play, I believe. It's large enough for the sound to travel freely."

"Huh. Okay. Thanks, Eden." She didn't say anything, she just stared. It wasn't a threatening stare, nor was it malicious. "Did you need anything else?"

"No, I'm fine," She replied, "...If you want to see if the living room is better, then I could join you." It took me a moment that this was her roundabout way of asking to hear me play. I smiled and nodded, taking the violin with me.

"Sure, sounds great!" She smiled back, albeit a bit awkwardly, and we made our way down the stairs. The living room was still empty, with the curtains drawn. I took a seat on the couch and set the violin on my lap. "So, what would you like me to play?" I asked, looking at her. Eden placed a few logs of wood into the fire pit, striking two pieces of flint together until a small fire roared. She didn't even look at me when she answered, just kept her eyes fixed on the fire.

"Something pleasant, would be nice."

Pleasant. Right. I had a few pieces in mind, and the bow touched the strings. The melody filled the room, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. The house didn't distort the sound in the living room, like Eden had suggested. Well, not entirely at least; though not as loud, I could still hear the notes being thrown back at me, a tinny and faint imitation of the original. The music was clear and crisp, and I could feel the vibrations of the notes travel up my arm. The warm light of the flames danced on the instrument, and the orange tinted glow of the room gave the whole thing a nostalgic feel. It was as if the whole room had been bathed in the soft glow of a memory. The music flowed from my fingertips and filled the room, filling every nook and cranny. When the piece was done, I lowered my violin and looked at Eden, who was staring at the bonfire intently, eyes wide and unfocused.

That was when I saw the tears, rolling down her cheeks like dewdrops on a leaf. They left a dark trail across her pale cheeks, nearly getting caught in the concave dips of her sunken face. "Eden? Are you okay?"

"N-no. Well, yes." Eden cleared her throat, looking away and rubbing her cheeks with her sleeve. "I don't have the privilege of listening to music all that often, and I was simply moved by the piece. You're a very talented musician. Thank you for that." Though her words were genuine, I couldn't help but feel like there was more to the tears. She was hiding something, I knew it. But I didn't want to pry.

I chuckled, shaking my head. "It was my pleasure, really. Thank you for allowing me to play. If you ever want another performance, I'd be more than happy to oblige!"

"Oh, I wouldn't want to impose on you."

"Trust me, there's no reward better for a musician than a happy audience." I grinned, and she paused, eyes flicking across my features, looking for... Something. When she didn't find it, that bittersweet smile returned to her face, the ends of her lips not reaching her face, and her eyebrows crinkling.

"Thank you, Julian." She stood up once more and put out the fire. All the life and colour that was once in the living room was snuffed out in an instant, swallowed by the dark. With a gentle bow, she ascended up the flight of stairs in a manner that was far too quiet for someone in such an old house, leaving me by my lonesome. The curtains hung like carcass shrouds, the floors creaked with each momentary shift in weight, and the house groaned as if the building itself was alive.

In the dark, the appeal of the house's eerie nature had worn away, and the fear was seeping back in. Even pushing myself onto my feet released a cacophony of protesting squeaks that made me jump. Hoping that Eden was right about the place being soundproof, I tip-toed across the living room, making my way to the stairs. Just before I could reach the flight of steps, I caught sight of something in my peripherals. Perched on one of the many shelves was a small framed picture.

I peered closely, examining the photo. It was faded and yellow, nearly a century old. The frame was a black, elegant piece with a silver trim. The photo itself seemed to be a family photo, positioned outside the manor itself. Only, it was a lot cleaner, and the massive oak tree that clung to the structure like a parasite was missing. While I didn't recognize any of the faces, I did notice a man in the middle, older in age yet possessing a certain dominance that made it clear he was the patriarch.

He stood with his back straight and his arms crossed, his face set in a stern expression. What was most strange about his appearance a terrible scar that spanned across the left side of his face, skin peeled off to reveal his teeth and eye. A war hero? Or just the victim of some horrible accident?

The rest of the family looked just as grim—expressionless, almost mannequin-like. No one smiled. Not even the children. Something about their faces unsettled me in a way I couldn’t explain, and I decided it'd be best to return to my room and get a good night's rest. I needed to be well-rested for my classes in the morning.

As I ascended the rickety stairs, each creak sharper than the last, I found myself thinking back to something Eden had said—something that hadn’t struck me until now.

Hollow, she had called it. I was by no means an architect, but there was no way that a place of this size and age could be hollow, could it? That sounded like a structural nightmare. Surely it would have collapsed under its own weight with how little care was put into it. I stopped in front of my room, the hallway lit by the dim light of the moon that poured in through my window, and took a moment to examine the walls. They were old, sure, and there were cracks and holes in them, but the foundation seemed solid enough.

Curious, I pressed my hand against the wallpaper and pushed. It felt... Like a wall. Of course. As I chastised myself for being so paranoid, however, the wall gave out a little under my palm. A faint squelch could be heard, and I felt something warm secrete into my hand. I wrenched the limb back, my heart rattling. A thick, viscous fluid clung to my skin, sticky and dark in the low light.

Panic seized me, and I stumbled clumsily from room to room, trying to decipher which one was the bathroom. Once I found it, I slammed the door open and flipped the lights on, nearly blinded by the sudden brightness.

It wasn't water coating my hands, nor mud, nor anything else that could've made any semblance of sense.

It was blood.

And it was warm.
