I want y'all to guess what made him cry before you reach the very end.

Let's call him 'Keith'. First of all, the reason why he ought to never cry in the first place is because of his father that was a retired soldier in a military. I've always told him that it was stupid since it is normal for anyone to cry, man or woman. Though he was a man of his words and did not cry even at the funeral of his grandfather and his Mother. Even in times where he is badly injured or hurt physically and emotionally, he never cried but he does show an expression of feeling pain like flinching, saying "ow" or "ouch" and panting out of pain, but never crying. 


 I've always thought that one day he would finally release all of the emotions he was feeling and he'd cry, I'd thought it would be caused by a loss of his love ones but what made him cry was so unpredictable but understandable.


Keith is 24 years old that lives alone in a rented apartment after he moved out of his grandmother's house at the age of 21. I heard he worked a lot of part-time jobs but he mainly work as a delivery man, though I don't know what specific company he works for.


People around him are pretty chatty and friendly around Keith since he is actually a sweet guy, he doesn't look as intimidating as many imagined him to be. He found his first love while delivering a package to her, her name is 'Fate'. I could say it maybe love at first sight but It couldn't be because even after all the love Keith gave and showed to Fate, she broke up with him because apparently Keith wasn't her type because he isn't the type to bring her to fancy dates and supposedly he didn't have a cool persona. Keith was just a simple but romantic guy. Keith did not cry but it was obvious from his act and expression that he wasn't emotionally stable.


Now there's this one friend, let's call him 'Marky'. He is a manager in a food place that Keith worked at his part time. Marky is friendly to his co-workers but he is a bit strict. Keith works as a janitor in that food place and once time Marky notices Keith and decided to have a little talk with him and the little talk turned into friendship. At Keith's darkest times, Marky was there as a helping hand and sometimes would give him some extra money in secret. Marky helped out Keith so much and treated him so good. Keith felt overwhelmed but was so thankful though something changed in his style, he would sometimes go to work dressing up looking cool and acted cool towards Marky at most times so he could look cool infront of Marky. He would save up his money to buy Marky gifts and says it was just a Thank you gift. 


But, one day Keith heard that Marky wasn't gonna be the manager any time soon because he was positive with kidney cancer. Keith felt so shocked that he even shocked himself when he asked where Marky lives and drove there. He wanted to know how Marky was feeling. Marky was shocked to see him but was thankful that he felt concerned for him. Marky would sometimes visit the food place and everything he does Keith would find ways to make him laugh and smile. Days passed and Marky visits the food place one last time to talk to Keith explaining that tomorrow he would maybe die because no one in his family is compatible to donate their kidneys to him help. Keith felt so bad that he couldn't do anything but look down. Marky hugged Keith and thanked him for making him happy in his counting days.
 

The next day, Marky was in the hospital waiting for his time to come but out of no where someone donated their kidney to him and just to find it was Keith. Marky couldn't help but cry and thankfully the operation was a success and afterwards when they were alright, Keith went to Marky hugging him first and he cried. Keith crying for the first time was caused by relief and he cried tears of joy. 


 he did admit to me that he cried emotionally days before when he heard that Marky was gonna die soon. He conclude that he cried for him because Marky treated him so well and good. His grandfather and his mother's death was devastating but they did not treat Keith as much as how Marky treated him so he did not cried for them. But, Marky... Keith felt a surge of sadness that he did not felt before. That is why it was understandable. His family was a great experience but Marky was everything for him.


I cried for days hearing this and I'm glad to say that the both are happily friends, for now.
