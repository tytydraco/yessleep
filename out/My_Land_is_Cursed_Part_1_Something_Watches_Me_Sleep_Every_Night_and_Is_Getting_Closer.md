I don't scare easy. I’ve seen more horrors than any mythos’ demons could conjure up, man is always worse than devils, but I’m also not a liar. So I won’t sit here and tell you that: The eyes that peek over the foot of my bed every night don’t rattle me. Well, currently it’s eyes, three nights ago it was the top of a swollen bald head, and 2 weeks ago it was just fingers.



I suppose the best place to start is about 2 month ago. 



I had finally finished moving into my new place, it was small but it was better than rotting barracks surrounded by 18 other delta force meatheads. I was alone in that crowd, a former French Foreign Legion “tourist.” of the 3rd infantry regiment, and was the only one who maintained some semblance of a sense of humor. I’m on a tangent, apologies. Vermont wasn’t my first pick, I’d much rather be sipping my brandy on the balcony of a cabin in Alaska, even if the visitor at the foot of my bed nightly was still included. But, it was close to family. And, then again at least is not some where completely without hunting opportunities like fucking California.  



I digress. My brother, bless his heart, tried helping me get the moving process hurried along but he ain’t used to the prosthetic yet and so I had to take it on alone. I guess the creature had some manner of patience because only after all my shit was comfortably moved in did he make his presence known. In high sight, the knocks coming from the closet were likely the entity’s doing and those began a month before the fingers first showed up. 



Each night, while the moon laid still, the lunar monolith reflecting solar rays to drip feed light into my room, the tapping would start. *Tap tap tap.* Three rhythmic taps muffed by the sliding oak closet door and that was all. Three and done. Like someone knocking, waiting for the door to be opened and invited in, but giving up quickly. A week later the knock now came in a pair: *tap tap tap… tap tap tap.* This is where I started to get tickled by a bit of concern. Three taps at the same time of night, everynight wasn’t of worry, I thought it was the water heater or another piece of cheaply constructed equipment actuating in some way. But these taps were more deliberate, desperate. Pining to enter. 



I sat up, unable to sleep. Another week passed and skipping straight passed three sets of tap, the tapping was now constant, every three seconds: *tap… tap… tap.*



“Hey! Someone there?” *Tap… Tap… Tap.* “Ay! Who the fuck is there?” I shouted. It took me a moment to realize my hand had instinctively opened my nightstand drawer and gripped the Sig Sauer 1911. I slid out of bed silently and stepped patiently across the specific floor boards that I had nailed down to make sure they wouldn’t creak. *Tap.* I threw the door open. 



Hollow darkness hung calmly. I flicked the light switch and cleared the closet swiftly. I sighed in confusion. I had no mental ailments, every airhead they had said so, but still, it was hard to not question my own sanity. As I turned off the light I jumped, something brushed past my feet. The feeling was like standing in a flow of snakes in January. Something frigid and slithering. It flowed over my feet and underneath my bed. I clicked on the flashlight mounted on the bottom of the Sig and searched the ground. Nothing. 



Delusions aren’t foreign to me. The tides of combat kept my brain awake for 82 hours once and the auditory, visual, and kinetic hallucinations I experienced were far worse than this, but… the difference there is I knew that they were false. This felt so real, and I had no reason to attribute this experience to a bout of disillusionment. My breath remained steady as I toiled in thought. 



“Must be a dream.” I said to myself softly. “Yeah fucking right.” I opened my gun safe and moved a small portion of my arsenal around my bed. Paranoia has saved my life a thousand and one times, why fix what ain’t broke. The morning after spending all night keeping my finger steady on the trigger of the Mossberg 500 packed full with 10 gauge slugs, was my first hunting trip in Vermont since I was 12. My Father, Brother and I were heading out to some private land to get at least a buck each. I packed my Smith & Wesson model 1854 and the warmest clothes and set out.



The road was lined by centurion trees that stood guard the entire trip. Yellow strikes of paints guided the lanes but eventually faded away as the road descended further into the belly of the forest. A small red, crumbled splotch of rotting viscera wriggled on the side of the road. A small raccoon, its guts splattered and feasted on, its stomach popped open like a gory balloon. A colony of maggots had carved a freeway road to hasten the meal throughout the poor thing. It’s eye twitched, flicking to meet mine as I drove. 



My tire misted the rodent as I sped up and adjusted my car to paste it. The rest of the trip was uneventful.



“Hey pops.”



“Ay, Melonhead! How you been kiddo?” My father snatched me up into a bear hug and squeezed as much air out of me as he could. My brother arrived about 15 minutes late but he had jerky so he was spared. 



“Gimpy, grab up the stool, nook is about a quarter mile deep.” My father ordered my brother like he had all throughout our childhoods. The spot was nice, not massive, but a rich bit of land for sure. 



We hauled out shit through the woods and made it up into the nook with little more than a twig snap. Pops dropped a 6 pointer and Gimpy, my brother's nickname for this story, popped a 4 pointer. They headed down to get their bucks as I scanned the land with my binoculars.



“Bingo.” I whispered, as I spotted an 8 point buck 130 yards out. He was broadside and still, almost begging me to drop him with a clean shot. *Tap… Tap… Tap.* The rattle of a loose pin smacking the steel frame of the nook beat in the same rhythm as the taps from the closet. I bit down on my gums. My finger hovered over the trigger as the tapping continued. What a perfect shot on a perfect buck. A shot I knew I shouldn’t take, so I didn’t. That made it angry. 



I switched on the safety and stewed in the silence of the nook, watching that buck through my binoculars. Still as a fucking statue.



That was the same night the fingers first appeared. I was writing in my journal, taking an intimate detail of that statuesque deer and every second before and after I spotted it. A captain’s log parse. *Tap.*



The sullen thud of the bony finger closing their grip around the edge of my bed frame. My pen froze instantly as my eye flew from the paper to the baseboard. Slender, skin and bone dark blue fingers clutched the foot of my bed with a death grip. I cocked the hammer of the revolver I had tucked into my pillow case and leveled it on the place I gauged the head was at. “Wanna say hi?” I asked and was answered with silence. I eased myself out of bed and held my aim steady as I crept closer. I took a large step, rounding the corner of my bed frame. Rail thin arms stretched all the way into the pitch black under my bed, the skin clung to the bones. I chewed on my cheek, thinking of what to do next.



Whether my next course of action was stupid or not, I knew it likely wouldn’t go well. I kicked the arms, hard. The long noodle-like bone snapped and something screamed like a cat being skinned. The wailing shook my house to its foundation. “Shut up!” The house steadied to silence. “Can the bitching and moaning! If you're gonna be in my house, you’re gonna stop this creepy shit. I don’t know what you are and I don’t care very much, but as long as you are under there, you're gonna be quiet. Got it?”



Once more, I was answered with silence. 



The week passed without incident. Each night I would hear the tap and sure enough the fingers would be gripping my bed frame, but it never escalated beyond that. Until that week passed. I wrote peacefully in my journal, the fingers had already appeared and I was fixing to get ready for bed soon when the boards creaked. I hurriedly grabbed the Sig under my pillow, I put the revolver in the nightstand, and clicked on the flashlight. Peaking just a few inches over top the edge of the baseboard was the bald blue head of whatever this thing was. I launched out of bed and rushed to the foot of my bed. Joining its grotesquely stretched arms was now its forehead, equally stretched to impossible proportions. I gently pressed the barrel of my pistol against it. “Don’t be stupid now.” 



Currently I’m in the process of resetting my sleep schedule, sleeping in the day and staying awake all night to watch. The eyes crested over the edge a little less than three nights later. They, much like the arms and head, were stretched far under bed. The room smells like sulfur now. It’s repugnant and impossible to escape.



Update: It’s been a few days and quite a bit has happened.



Last night, as I sipped a boiling hot cup of coffee, my eyes shifted over to the window. I stared through the glass and caught the sight of something illuminated by the moonlight. A deer. No cross reference with my journal was needed, it was the same deer as the one from the woods 50 some miles away. It was just as still. Frozen in place as if time had paused. My eyes only broke away from it as I heard the floorboards shift. 



It’s mouth was now visible, distended and drooling, it’s chin rested near my feet and its cheeks were pulled back to masquerade as a smile. Met with this terror I did the only reasonable thing. I shot it.



It’s left eye exploded in white fluid and strands of red threads flew into the air. Its eye twitched and so I dumped three more rounds into its face, leaping from my bed to follow its falling body. Little pisses of blood spurt out from the holes in its face. I dove forward, digging my hawk-bill knife into its eye socket and dragging it out from under my bed. Its torso was full out from under the bed and I could see its legs stretching into the inky darkness. It was fighting, the legs though scrawny fought hard to pull itself back under. I emptied my clip into its skull and chest then ditched the gun to bury my hand into its other eye socket for better grip. 



“Nope, you wanted fuck about, come on out!” I heard the bones of its legs crack as I slowly won the tug of war. The bones gave way and I dragged out the creature in one final painful tug. “Prick!” I grunted as I rammed my knife into its throat. Cutting through the bone and skin until its head rolled off its shoulders. 



I flopped to my butt as my heart slammed. I hopped to my feet, grabbed my gun, and reloaded it. I emptied that mag into the head as well and finally took a moment to calm down. I was soaked head to toe in red gore and blood from the butchering of the creature and as cold air from the AC rolled over me I shivered. 



Cleaning up the body took longer than actually killing it. Nests of webs were formed under my bed like it had made its home there. Nothing a shop-vac can’t fix. Bleach and Lysol were the key players. Lots of bleach and hours of scrubbing. Though, having time to catch up on Creep Cast was a nice bonus. I hauled the beast out to the incinerator and tossed in manageable chunks of the nearly half ton monstrosity. 



As it stands now, the thing is gone, quite literally dust in the wind, less literally water under the bridge. I’m fixing my sleep schedule, have made the crushing financial decision of buying two fresh boxes of .45 ACP, and I am still seeing that deer.



I don't know what it is, but if it’s anything like whatever was under my bed, I can handle it. 



That’s all for now. I don’t know if I’ll have a need to post here again, only made this in case I got killed by the bed troll or whatever. But, If I do, I'll be sure to post about it. 



Who knows, maybe my land is cursed. It’d sure be good for stories.
