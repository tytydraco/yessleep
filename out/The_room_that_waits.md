I rented a cheap apartment in a part of town that didn’t really feel like it wanted me there.

The hallway was always too long. The lights flickered in perfect rhythm, like they were practicing a message they hadn’t figured out how to say.

There was a door in my unit that shouldn’t have been there. I didn’t see it when I moved in, but one morning I woke up and it was just… part of the wall. A door like any other. Slightly ajar. Breathing, almost.

I ignored it. For a while. But it watched me. Hummed to itself when I passed.

And then one day, I opened it.

Inside was my apartment again, but not quite. It was ahead of me by three seconds. I’d lift my arm, and the version of me in that room had already done it. I blinked, and they finished first. It echoed my thoughts back before I had them.

Then it turned toward me.

It was me. My face. But the eyes—something behind them had cracked. Not broken, not shattered. Worse. They’d reformed around something.

And it spoke.

“If you skip the next ten seconds, you won’t see what breaks you.

You’ll keep your life. Your little habits. Your warmth.

But if you watch—if you look—everything changes.

This is your choice.”

I felt it immediately. That pull. The curiosity. The pricklingly tiny fear.

But also… trust. That this other me had seen something.

And didn’t want me to carry it.

So I closed my eyes.

Let the ten seconds pass.

When I opened them, the room was empty. The copy was gone. The mirror-apartment erased. I thought that was the end of it. Thought I’d made the right choice.

That night, I woke up crying.

No reason. Just wet cheeks, a pounding heart, and that sick, floating feeling of grief I couldn’t name. Like my soul was mourning something I’d asked it to forget.

My hands trembled. My pillow was soaked. My chest felt hollow, like a violin that had stopped resonating.

And then I heard it.

My voice, but not mine, pressing itself into the cracks in my skull like cold air through a broken window.

“I saw it.

I screamed so loud it cracked something in the world.

I begged to undo it.

And it said:

‘Go back.

Erase the memory.

Choose not to look at me.’

So that this version of me—you—could live.”

Then it began.

First a flicker. Then a sting. A sharp, unbearable prick behind my eyes like hot wire threading through soft tissue. I felt something reach through my skull and pull.

The pain created new language.

But I couldn’t react.

I wasn’t allowed.

No scream. No flinch. Just the dry sound of my breath catching in my throat.

You’ll have to be nonchalant about it, the voice said. Otherwise she’ll know.

I didn’t understand what that meant. She?

But then I looked in the mirror.

And she was there.

She had my face. But her expression wasn’t confused or broken. It was calm. Knowing. She smiled, just faintly, and raised her hand to mimic threading something through her own skull.

That’s when the world shifted again.

The hum returned. The mirror began to breathe. The glass softened under my hand like warm breath on skin.

And I knew—I could go in.

But only if I wanted to.

Only if I truly, deeply wanted to.

I stood there, palm pressed to the mirror, heart trembling. The room behind it inhaled, slow and patient.

Not demanding.

Just waiting.

Waiting to see if I loved her enough to ruin myself.

Because that’s what she did for me.

And I did.

Not out of fear. Not out of obligation.

But because I saw her smile and understood what she’d carried.

I thought crossing over would end it.

But it only made the work begin.

The memories weren’t just removed. They had to be scrubbed. Carefully. Manually. On hands and knees. One by one.

I would find them curled like parasites inside extraordinary moments—inside raucous, uncontrolled laughter, perfectly warm sunlight for a cat to bathe in, gorgeous music that inspires people to love.

Sometimes, while scrubbing, I’d say something I didn’t recognize. A phrase in a language I don’t know. And the moment I noticed it, it would vanish like breath on a mirror.

And sometimes, after I finished, something new would grow there. A flicker of unease. A word that felt too sharp. A dream that ended before it started.

I wasn’t just erasing myself.

I was planting the idea to look.

Sometimes I’d reach for the smell of toast and feel my stomach lurch with revulsion. Sometimes I’d recall an old dream and watch it turn inside out before it dissolved.

I’d look at someone I loved and forget why I loved them for half a second.

Then remember—but with a different image. A different voice.

And every time I pulled one out, I saw it again.

I saw it.

And then I had to pretend I didn’t.

Because if I fought—if I screamed or resisted—it would come back whole. Like a bone healed wrong and re-broken.

The voice came again.

This time, not to explain. Not to console.

Just to remind me.

It said, “You will live a long, natural life. Dying at a very old age.

But you will constantly have to keep rewriting yourself.

Replacing broken pieces with nearby ones.

Reconfiguring the shape of who you are so that it no longer touches what you saw.

You will smile. Love. Work.

And every now and then, something inside you will go still.

And you’ll have to rewrite yourself again.

Knowing that there's something that would cause you to go to these lengths.”

Then it said,

“Or you can just let yourself see it.

You can stop fighting.

Let it fill you.

Let yourself know it.

Let yourself end.

I will offer this every time you change yourself.”

I nodded.

Not in agreement.

Just in understanding.

Because I knew what it meant now.

This wasn’t healing.

This was decay, done politely.

And every time I rebuilt myself, it would wait just outside the cracks, offering peace.

Offering truth.

Offering madness.

And in the still moments, I find myself mouthing syllables I don’t recognize.

Words that feel important.

Answers to questions no one has ever even thought to come up with.

And someday, one day. One beautiful and glorious day,

My curiosity will be too magnificent.
