When I was a kid, bad things happened in my house. I don’t really need to get into the details — you can probably fill in the blanks. Let’s just say I grew up with issues before I even knew how to spell it.

My way of surviving was… leaving. Not physically, obviously. But mentally. By the time I was eight, I had learned how to disappear.

People call it dissociation now. Back then it was just zoning out. I still can’t tell if it saved me or if it broke something I’ll never get back.

Teachers wrote reports about my daydreaming. Whilst My parents just called me lazy. But really, I was building entire universes inside my head. To me, it was amazing. A superpower of creativity. 

And here’s the weird part, I never stopped.

Even now, as an adult, I slip into it like a second skin. Sometimes unintentionally sometimes on purpose. On the train, in line at the grocery store, lying awake at night, I just go somewhere else. I make people. Friends. Lovers. Enemies. Heroes. Villains. I give them names, backstories, quirks. I decide how they meet, what happens to them, how they die if I’m feeling dramatic.

I have some preset worlds that I visit most. These are usually reserved to help me regulate my emotions, they’re filled with characters that agree with everything I say or help me work through a feeling. Because they are technically all me, I know I’m just helping myself through my problem but it’s comforting to think that other people want to help me too, even if they aren’t real.

When I’m bored though, these worlds can develop into anything.

One time I made myself win the lottery — six million pounds. I bought a house, filled it with cool stuff, donated a chunk to children’s charities , and created the dialogue for all the characters around me as I went along. “Oh, thank you so much” I made one character say, “you’ve single handedly solved child poverty.” I remember letting out a little giggle in the real world which resulted in all five people at the bus stop turning to look at me, eyebrows raised.

Another time, I imagined a world where every single person on earth had a countdown above their head, a glowing number ticking away to their death. I spent weeks inside that one, weaving stories of how people would act if they knew exactly when they were going to die. I made a married couple cling to each other as the husband watched his wife’s count down tick to zero whilst he still had 12 years left, as she died, I made him sob into her hair wishing he would go to. Then I had an idea, I made him sit up in resolution as his count down switched to 4 minutes…yeah, I made him...erm self-exit. What can I say, I was feeling emotional that day.

It’s like playing The Sims, except I’m the god, the camera, and every single character at the same time. I can write a whole romance in my head during a boring meeting. I can invent a tragic war epic to help me fall asleep. Sometimes I make them fight, sometimes I make them laugh, sometimes I let them comfort me when I can’t comfort myself.

It’s my own little multiverse. And I control everything.

…Or at least, I thought I did.

The first time it happened, I was in this world where I was just about to be broken up with. I wasn’t in a very good place in my relationship in the real world, so I used to go there often when I was alone, usually after arguments. Sometimes id figure out a way to fix it, sometimes id just let it happen and wallow in self-pity whilst making lasagne, this time though I guess I just wanted to get some practise in. you know, cool comebacks etc just in case the inevitable happened.

So, I had everything planned, the world was built, backstory thought of, the script ready in my head, it was going well, I decided at the last minute that this time I was going to beat him to the punch, I sat us down on a bench, I made the evening sun just about to dip below the horizon and I started to talk. “I know you don’t want to be with me” I started, I had a whole host of witty, clever things I wanted to say ready for when he was finished with his part of the script but, that’s not what happened.

“That’s not fair. You don’t know what I want.”

The words were so sharp, so clear, I don’t know if I heard them in my head… or out loud.

I hadn’t planned that. I hadn’t even thought those words before I heard them.

I actually stopped, mid-laundry, because I thought I’d misremembered. But no, this character, this fake person, just looked at me, the, in my mind me and said something I didn’t make him say.

At first, I brushed it off, the brain is a cool thing, I thought, I’d buried myself so deep into this world that my subconscious was picking up on something it thought was coming next that’s all.

Even still, I didn’t go back in there. I stayed out of my own head all day. Every time I felt myself slipping into a scenario, I’d do my best to snap myself back to reality. I didn’t know what my brain was playing at, but I had no come back for what he said. He was meant to agree, I had it all planned.

That evening I couldn’t sleep, I’d pretty much forgotten about the little brain blip earlier, it was overshadowed by my actual boyfriend not coming home that night.

I tossed and turned for what felt like hours, but nothing helped. Finally, I decided to slip into my happy place.

It’s place I’d built when I was around ten. It was a quiet cabin in the middle of dense woods, no people, just me. It was always raining there; I love the rain.

I’d always start the scenario outside, soaked through. I would walk up to the cabin, unlock the door, and be met by comforting warmth even though the fire sat cold.

I’d light the fire, usually with magic. I was ten, give me a break. And I’d snuggle in my goose down duvet, on the sofa, the soft fabric so soothing against my cold skin. and then jerry would bring me cookies. Oh, Jerry’s not a person, like I said this cabin was strictly no people allowed. He’s my kind of adopted forest pet. I’m not sure exactly what he is, I think my kid brain must have mixed two birds together because he’s as white as a dove but is most defiantly a crow. I’m 36 now so I can’t remember what I was thinking and I’ve no idea why I’d name a bird Jerry at 10 but He’s a permanent fixture here anyway.

I wanted comfort so I closed my eyes and planned to drift there. It was harder to get there this time. It was difficult to relax with everything going on, but I managed it eventually.

I walked through the forest, up the path, the familiar droplets of heavy rain beading on my skin as always. I couldn’t hear the usual bird song this time, I put it down to my brain being torn between this world and reality.

The real me was very anxious so maybe background ambience was too much for my mind to process as well.

But when I walked through the door in my mind, the fire was already lit. Someone was sitting in the chair by the hearth. A woman. Jerry was perched on her shoulder. She turned, looked straight at me, and whispered:

“Finally.”

I snapped out of it so fast I thought I was going to be sick.

Now I know I definitely didn’t make her.

 I should have left it there. But curiosity eats at you, doesn’t it?

I’ve been in therapy since I was able to pay for it myself. Doctor Ashcroft always said dissociation was just my brain protecting itself, so I told myself that’s all this was. A trick of memory. A glitch in the script. Nothing more. She said because my real world felt out of control that maybe it was bleeding into my subconscious, making me “think” I didn’t do or say the things in my head.

From that point on I tried to chill. It didn’t take long before I was sitting alone in my office, bored out of my skull waiting on Simon from accounting to email something through. I imagined what it would be like if I didn’t have to work there and before I new it I’d slipped back into my lottery win daydream.

I imagined myself at home, my new bigger home, sipping a passionfruit martini beside my indoor swimming pool. The sun’s warm rays reflecting ripples of pool water like glitter on the walls. For a moment it was perfect, the tang of fruit on my tongue, the cool tiles beneath my bare feet, the lazy sound of water lapping against the pool’s edge.

Then I noticed a wet footprint.

Just one, near the edge of the pool. Not mine. Too big. Too heavy. The droplets led toward the glass doors but disappeared halfway, as if whoever left them had just, vanished.

I tried to push it aside, chalking it up to a slip in concentration.

I set my glass down, thinking about how nice it would be to feel the water on my skin. and that’s when I saw it: a reflection rippling across the glittering wall. Not mine. Not anything that should’ve been there. A figure moving slowly, deliberately, behind me.

Before I could turn, I felt two cold hands on my shoulders. My heart pounded in my chest. I didn’t summon them. I didn’t build them.

They leaned in, close enough that I could smell chlorine on their skin, and whispered:

“You’re starting to understand.”

I was startled out of the nightmare of my apparent own creation by a knock.

“Erm, sorry Laura I cant get the email to er... email.” Simon stood in the doorway, arms stuffed full of disorganised papers. His face twisted when he saw me. “What’s with you? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I laughed too quickly, the sound brittle. My hands went to my shoulders without thinking, brushing at the fabric of my blouse. Wet. My fingertips came away damp. Maybe sweat. Maybe.

Simon frowned. “You alright? You smell like… chlorine.”

I forced a smile, but my heart was still racing. I hadn’t been near a real pool in months.

“I… I’m not feeling well, I think I need to go home,” I stammered before brushing past him.

“Er, alright,” he echoed down the hallway.

I was halfway to the car when I heard the crash behind me, Simon, cursing as he tripped over a bucket the cleaner had left outside my office door. A sharp whiff of chemicals hit the air.

For one dizzy second, I almost laughed with relief. Of course. The smell. Just cleaning supplies. Just coincidence.

But then I looked down at my blouse. The damp patches clung to my skin. And no bucket in the world could explain that. Right?

I tried to get an urgent appointment with Doctor Ashcroft, but I couldn’t get a hold of her.

On the drive home, my mind wandered without me meaning it to. One blink I was on the motorway, the next I was sitting in my log cabin. Across from that woman. The one I never made.

She smiled, leaned close, and simply said.

“Hello.”

My eyes snapped open to headlights bearing down on me. I swerved hard, tyres screaming, dragging myself back into the right lane with my heart hammering against my ribs.

I wasn’t safe anywhere now. Not even behind the wheel.

That had never happened before. I could always control everything. Every character, every setting, every detail bent to my will. Every thought was mine.

But now it felt like I was falling — falling into a world of my own creation without a choice.

My fingers drummed a frantic rhythm against the coffee table as I tried to anchor myself, to will myself to stay here, in reality.

That’s when my phone rang.

Dr. Ashcroft.

I snatched it up, desperate for answers, for something that would pull me back. But all I got were words of advice, calm and clinical. Ground yourself. Remind yourself it’s still just you. Realise they’re just parts of your mind.

Not what I wanted to hear. Not when the voices didn’t feel like me anymore.

I tried to argue, to tell her it was different this time, that it wasn’t me. But she cut me off with a barrage of urgent questions.

“You say they’re not yours, who’s do you think they are?” “I don’t know.”

“When you hear them, is it inside your head, or does it sound like it’s coming from outside?” “I don’t know.”

“Do they sound familiar to you in any way?” “No, I don’t know.”

“What do you think the voices want from you?” “I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know!”

I hung up the phone, scowling at the screen. What was that? I needed help not an interrogation. I couldn’t answer half her questions but one clung to me. The more I tried to ignore it, the heavier it sat in my chest.

That night, I lay down on my bed, exhausted but restless. Against my better judgement, I drifted back into the cabin. It still rained outside, soaking my skin that comforting way it always did. But I could see the firelight already flickering inside.

She was there. The woman. Waiting. Jerry perched calm on her shoulder.

She tilted her head, eyes bright, lips curling into a smile that wasn’t kind.  
“Well… isn’t this freeing?”

My legs carried me forward in two shaky steps before I even realised, I was moving.

Then I blinked.

And I wasn’t standing anymore. I was sitting in the chair across from her, hands folded neatly in my lap as if someone else had put me there.

A voice rose from behind me, low and certain.  
“She means… you’re not the one in control anymore.”

Her smile lingered, and then the world around me fractured.

In the blink of an eye, I was no longer in the cabin. I was back on the bench, the one where I’d practised breaking up with my boyfriend. Only this time, he turned his head and looked me dead in the eye.  
“I don’t need you to tell me what to say.”

Before I could answer, the scene shifted again. I was standing in front of the woman I’d once imagined thanking me for charity donations. Her eyes burned with something like fury.  
“I don’t need to be your puppet for your gratification.”

Then everything shifted again. I was in the countdown world, but this time I wasn’t watching him. I was in his place. A stool beneath my feet, a rope brushing my throat, his hands steadying me. His voice was calm, almost relieved,  
“I don’t have to do this… but I want to.” He kicked the stool from under me. I felt the rope tighten like a vice round my neck as the world faded to grey.

I woke gasping for air, clawing at my throat, only to find myself tucked neatly in bed, the sheets smoothed, the pillow cool beneath my head.

Which brings me to now.

I am doing everything I can to stay out of my worlds. No daydreams, no slipping, no comfort trips to the cabin. It does not matter. Lately, I catch myself halfway through things I do not remember starting.

Once, I found myself standing at the sink, cold water running over my hands, the tap opened fully. My hands were blue.

Another time, I awoke halfway down the stairs, clutching a mug I couldn’t recall filling.

These moments, stolen, half-lived, settle over my days like dust. There are gaps in the hours now, little pockets of missing time that throb at the edges of my memory. I tell myself I am fine. I tell myself this is nothing, that exhaustion can mimic madness.

Yet, this morning I woke up with my nails dug deep into my arm, skin raw. I had been scratching words into myself.

When I finally pulled my hand away, the words were there, carved in jagged red letters.

NOT YOURS.

I try to walk through my days more slowly now, clinging to routines like clockwork. That way, if time goes missing, I’ll know.

I can feel them watching. The other selves. Waiting for the moment I slip, waiting for the chance to step forward again.

Is this how they felt? Living their lives normally until I plucked them from their reality and forced them to play in mine?

But that can’t be it. I made them, didn’t I?

They aren’t real, are they?

Dr. Ashcroft wants to up our sessions to twice a week. She says next time she’ll have a specialist join us.

When I said, “I didn’t know there was a specialist in daydream characters gone wrong,” she just smiled at me in that doctor-way, like I’m crazy.

I’m not crazy.

I didn’t give these imaginary people independence. I can’t make them do what they want.

But if I didn’t give them autonomy… [who did?](https://youtu.be/bD7YEsvWpEU)
