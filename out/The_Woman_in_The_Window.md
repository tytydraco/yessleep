Me and my fianc√©e currently live in a smaller townhome style apartment: very skinny but very tall. Attached to our "dining room" area (read: sewing room) is a double sliding door to a small patio area where we keep our plants. In the first few months of living here, a lot of the apartments around us were still being remodeled so they remained completely vacant. At the same time, our vertical blinds were broken, but the lack of neighbors made it to where this wasn't even a worry or thought. That was until she moved in.

One day we were chilling in our kitchen, talking and making dinner when something felt off. We couldn't put our finger on it, but we both felt it. The back sliding door was shining our reflection back at us as we chatted and ate. Once we began heading upstairs, I turned off the light to the kitchen and immediately our reflection disappeared. The few unbroken lights from outside illuminated the now changed facade of the apartment directly across from us. The blinds were now opened. They were closed earlier the same day, meaning just recently had been opened. The construction crews had long since gone home, as their work day ends at around 5. Still, we chalked it up to a forgotten supply or phone or something rational and went to bed.

The next day we found out we were wrong. Inside the house we saw newly brought in furniture. No moving trucks were heard and we hadn't seen anyone lugging heavy tables or lamps in at any point. There wasn't even a sign of life in the apartment, just furniture. I know how crazy that sounds, but usually even a new living situation would have dinner plates, plants, something to show that it's not a model unit. This possibility also crossed my mind, but the model units were closer to the leasing office at the front of the complex. 

It wasn't until my fiancee said something I realized I had been staring in this person's window for an uncomfortable amount of time. I forced my eyes back into the kitchen and onto my breakfast. We spent the next few minutes just shooting the shit, trying to ignore the weirdness. Eventually, though, a crowd of people walked right into the unit. Our attentions - as nosy and messy as it seems - was focused on nothing else right away. We fully became invested in deducing every single person in this posse to find out what the fuck was happening. It was a very diverse crowd and not one person looked like they hung in the same crowd as the next. They all piled in and vanished. Completely vanished. The window on the front of the building is massive and would, we thought, would've caught at least *someone* passing through or **something**. But no one did. We watched the door as long as we could when we could in order to see someone leave but we never caught them. 

Time passed and theories were tossed around. Everything from an orgy spot to a portal to the Feywild crossed our minds. We saw crowds coming and going, no two the same (hence the orgy thought). Investigating for months we were finally able to find out who was the main protagonist of this crazy apartment's story. A regular looking woman, wearing JCPenney business attire every time she was spotted, blunt bangs on flat ironed hair, and always carrying something. She was never just carrying a purse or briefcase, but rather papers, groceries, clothing bags, anything and everything besides just normal day-to-day items. It wasn't the fact of the items themselves, but rather the fact we never saw her *without* these items. We saw plenty of our neighbors on the daily, walking their dogs or just walking to their cars, but not her. She was always on an "errand" of some sort. One day we saw what we assumed was her mother by how they spoke to one another in passing. We haven't seen "mom" since, though.

One random night after we got our blinds fixed, we left to go do some late night shopping. We stepped out to see bright purple light glowing from her window. I snuck a peek through her open blinds to see what was going on. I couldn't see a source of the purple light for the life of me. The lamp in the room was turned off, the kitchen lights were off, but the dining room on the other side of this window was so brightly lit the source *had* to be nearby. But also why was this room lit like a smoker's den but not a soul in sight? Why the purple light instead of just a regular lamp if the goal is just to say "we're home don't break in"? My fiancee once again had to pull me away before seeming like a full blown creep, but I couldn't help myself! How could someone pay rent but never seem like they live in their own apartment?!

Recently, us in Texas went through a terrible derecho storm that tore through our complex like a fucking hurricane. We had to barricade ourselves and our cats in our tiny bathroom under the stairs in case something crashed through our unit. I know this is off topic, but it'll come back around, I promise. We walked through the complex after the storm died down, and every neighbor was coming out to do the same: investigate. We all wanted to see what damage was done. Window screens were ripped off, trees crashed through walls and roofs, covered parked was torn to shreds. Not a single person was with power not only in the complex, but also in the entire city. Everyone was affected. 

Cut to a few days later: our power is still off, it's 98 degrees out, and I'm bored on my day off re-staining some chairs because Home Depot has a generator and I needed a reason to get some AC. So 50 bucks and some wood stain later, I'm out on my patio working, when the woman from the unit across begins to come by. She is visibly confused and observing all the damage that remains all around. I give her a slight nod and see she is trying to talk to me. I pull out my headphone and give a curt, "One more time?" 

"What happened?!" She solicited from me.

I had no idea why she was asking this. Everyone in a 20 mile radius knew exactly what went down. My relatives from the next state over knew what happened here! How had she just completely missed what was going on.

"The storm...?" I asked more than declared.

She gave me a silent "Oh yeah" and moved on to go inside. I was completely astounded as the only way to have missed the news of what was going on was to be an completely different country or actively ignore the news to not know what happened. She wasn't carrying any luggage of any kind, just her usual papers. Who is this woman? Why is she always put together? Where does she even live? I peered into the window while pretending to work on my chairs and saw that her unit was the exact same as when she first moved in. Literally the exact same. Tall floor lamp to the right of a bare wooden dinner table with space for eight chairs but housing only two, small dresser to the left with nothing on top, an archway straight ahead leading to a perfectly clean kitchen with zero decor inside, all these never looking even slightly lived in.

I'll update with anymore info I can find or figure out. I obviously don't want to go too far in case this is just a regular, albeit strange, woman just trying to live her life.
