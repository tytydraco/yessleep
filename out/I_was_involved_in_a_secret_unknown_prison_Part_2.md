How do spirits write and give stories?

That's a question I haven't answered myself yet.

Does that mean ghosts can't write stories for the living? I'm not really sure. But if you're reading this, then that means there's more questions that need answers. How do I put this? It's like my heart is a typewriter and writes down what I'm going through. Right now my heart is writing about my thoughts and the situation I'm in. Damn, it's hard to come up with the right words for this.

Seeing my dead body made my stomach churn. I looked at my own palms, to see that they're normal, exactly when I was still alive. I watched the puddle of blood getting larger beneath my corpse. I should be vomiting or shit my pants. But I don't feel anything coming out nor feel the heavy weight in my stomach.

I stepped over my dead body. I nearly slipped over my own puddle of blood as I did so. When I attempted to walk through the wall, my face smacked against it. I thought ghosts can walk through walls. They're transparent or something, so they should be able to. Well, guess that doesn't work for me then?

With a hand on my nose, I pushed the door open. I popped my head out of my room to find a massacre of corpses decorated the halls. The lights were flickering, blood dripping from the ceiling, the entirety of the scene leaves no sound other than my heartbeat and the droplets of blood.

If I wanted to escape this place, I needed to get to the elevator, located at the lobby. But to make it there, I have to go up. I am located at level 30, the 7th deepest levels of the entire facility in this wasteland of an ocean. To be frank, I have absolutely no idea how deep I was. There was little information as to where we are. And all it said in one of the journals I got was that we're like living in a labyrinth of many worlds. That leaves me quite clueless as to what it means. Never have I've ever gone into English literature.

I stepped out and tread my way through the hall. I realized no one was present. Ghosts aren't anywhere to be seen. But why is that? It left me scratching the back of my head. Maybe they went to heaven without me. Welp, that's evident that god hates me. (Of course the Gods hate me. I existed to be some sort of... miserable trash). That makes me wonder though: Did they just create me for some elaborate experiment or just for the sake to fill some excitement over their boredom?

The itching became worse as I walked to the direction of the exit. That feeling you get when you knew there's someone here with you, but you couldn't locate who. But I'm a ghost. Doesn't that mean nobody is gonna see me at all? I sure damn hope so. Wouldn't want to be tortured by the morbid beasts that was contained in this labyrinth.

I stopped to a slightly open metal door, stained with putrid blood and tissue. The putrid smell of flesh made me gag that I pinched my nose out of disgust. I browse through the circular window to yet again see scrambled corpses decorated everywhere. But what really gave me the chills was another corpse with its whole body cut open, exposing the bones, organs, and teeth. It was crucified against the wall, with blood flooding the floor. The word ***'SURVIVE'*** plastered on the wall, marked in crimson blood.

My teeth gritted as I forced the door to open. Pushing this door felt like I'm pushing against a car up to the hill. Until the door opened, I puffed and stepped out with arms swinging exhaustedly. The smell of putrid meat churns my stomach, the stomach acid could erupt out of my mouth. Or maybe, something else was turning. Do we even have organs while being dead? Well, I didn't want to find out by slitting my stomach and see what's in there. That'll hurt so terribly.

Surprisingly, my muscles relaxed under a second. *Huh, that's cool. Do ghosts have regenerative abilities?* Does that mean that ghosts won't have to worry about losing so much energy? And does it also mean that we can regenerate our lost limbs without problems. I sure hope so. Can't type nor write without my fingers, toes, nose, chin, or whatever. Fingers are better to write and type than toes, wouldn't you agree?

I scan closer to the crucified corpse. Its teeth shined a terrible smile, with eyeless sockets that sink deep into a terrible darkness. I swear I thought its head jerk a bit. I shivered in the thought of it being conscious this whole time, and it might just leap over me in a way a tiger hunts their prey. Whoever did this must be one hell of a psychopath for using some sacrilegious ritual for some messed up game.

I thought whoever this corpse belongs to should be around here somewhere. But I don't see anyone at all. That left me chills. And my instincts are whispering to me that I'm not alone, in a creepy way.

Suddenly, I heard noises coming from my right. I tiptoe towards the sound. The voices became a bit more clearer, and I thought they were just the backup. I was going to run towards them, but something doesn't feel right at all. None of this is alright.

I lowered down and start crawling towards the fence. I look down through the fence to see 4 entities gather around in a circle. They stood on a large circular mat decorated with hieroglyphs and skulls. Each of the entities stand at North, South, East, and West. Mauled security guards lay wasted on the marble floor, their eyes devoid of life. The elevator is just right ahead. Unfortunately for everyone, there aren't stairs to go down there. So if I jump down, they'll twist around and kill me. I don't know why nobody even bothered to make stairs at this point.

I may have the urge to go down there, since I'm a ghost. But I just felt that I shouldn't be doing that. Just, what if they could see me?

They were circled together in a conversation. I don't recognize those 3 entities at all. But there is one entity I do recognize.

*Entity #13*

*Title: The Restless Hunter*

*Classified: ???*

*Origin: Unknown*

*Species: Human(not entirely)*

*Weight: 234 Kg*

*Height: 192 cm*

*Unique system: Super strength, faster reaction speed, Invulnerability, high senses, adaptability level A*

The Restless Hunter is no ordinary human. He's remarkably terrifying, able to withstand nuclear weaponry as if they're nothing. He's intelligent enough to speak different languages under a minute. Scientists hypothesized that he might be the answer to human evolution. However, when they got DNA samples, they were left puzzled to find nothing. Scientists had a conversation with this berserker, but it never goes well for them. The hunter's answers were declined, which they described them as 'unrealistic' and 'invalid'.

Capturing the Restless hunter took 562 casualties, until one froze it by throwing a flash bomb. The flash affected not just his senses, but froze his entire body, freezing his brain to black out. They have to make it quick for them to transport him into the facility, which is hard enough to pour a bucket of sweat.

They did get some info on the violet leather coat he was wearing over his shoulders. He said he had slain the beast that eats gods from different regions of the multi-verse. And when staring into its dark abyssal eye sockets, they crumble into an unending vision of gods suffering in eternal damnation. It's his favorite pet, but it doesn't seem to be moving. However, whenever we're around it for too long, we begin to grow mad, seeing it moving. It's alive or conscious the entire time you could say.

And there he is, The restless hunter, having a somewhat big conversation with 3 entities that somehow knew him.

I crept closer to the windowed fence, the voices becoming clearer.

"You will await in your designated destinations. You are prohibited to move out or leave anyone alive. Are we all clear." This entity was wearing a coat with aligned violet scales. His vines of sharp tentacles protruding out below his cloak. His hoodie covered his face into a hollow darkness that it absorbed the light from the world. For some reason, his voice sounded familiar. Yet I couldn't put my finger on why.

The Restless Hunter grunted. "So, I just have to wait up there for someone to just show up at the front gate? Is that it?"

"It is what we've agreed, Samson. Better yet, you'll be encountering impressive opponents along the way." The entity's 8 serpent heads spoke simultaneously into a rhythm. He wore a fresh new tuxedo of pure void, and he wore prestigious pants that would put billionaires to shame. Whatever he was drinking from the cup he was holding, it doesn't seem to be tea. It could rather be the blood of his victims.

I never thought this bulky hunter can have a simple name such as Samson. I always expect a hunter such as himself would have an incomprehensible name. Except it was Samson.

Samson grinned with delight. "Sure. Sounds better than ever."

"As we all know this before, we will soon start a war that will last for billions of years. Just as you signed up for, Samson." The pope informs. I can't see if he was grinning, but I can tell he sure was.

The mention of War made Samson's grin worse, showing his sharp fangs of death. The sight of it gives shivers to my bones. But that's not the only thing that bothers me. Wars terrify the crap out of me; the deaths, torture, fear, all the messed up things they do to each other. In the end of the war, they go back home. Some may get a congrats, while others tend to get berated by the townsfolk. Many of the war veterans were left scarred, and that changed them for the rest of their lives. Becoming whatever they become.

When I check around for anywhere to sneak through, I got caught in a trap, staring face to face with the 4th entity. The entity is nothing more than a sleepy teenager comfortably wearing his pajamas while floating above the ground... Wait, I don't think he's floating at all. There's something sticking to his back with some sort of fishing hook. He's facing me, except his eyes are closed shut..... However, it still feels like he was watching me this whole entire time.

The 3 entities focused towards the 4th, studying his gesture. Samson's eyes widen, and turned towards me. His gaze hits my core, freezing me in place. "Well, this seems rather intriguing, is it not, Samson?" The snake entity jokingly uttered.

The hunter snarled. "Absolutely not. He can easily be killed with just a flick of a finger at the skull. Let 'dream boy' do the work."

I immediately sprang up and dashed in a haste. I hear nothing behind but my footsteps as I retreat. Upon returning to where the corpse was crucified, I heard bones cracking at my right. I spun around to watch the corpse wriggling out to life, peeling its arms off the wall. Its glistening teeth morphed into a morbid smile, a smile that would belong to a humanoid creature in the dark woods. It dropped to the floor with a gruesome crunch. Its spidery arms pushed itself up to stare at me with its lifeless eyes. I never thought I could have scopophobia until now.

I dashed away through the door I came out of and ran. Behind me, the living corpse chases after me, crawling on the ceiling with terrifying speed. If I looked back, it would already have reached me and take a chunk out of my face. Every step I make sends a crunch of flesh and bone, yet my stomach endured the sickening stench and sound, focusing on escaping from this creature.

It suddenly screeched at me; demanding I surrender my soul to its stomach. It cackles mockingly, toying with me by playing chase.

To my shock and terror, I was met face to face with a tall muscular bulky humanoid walking aimlessly from afar. An entity I recognized.

*Entity #77*

*Title: The white silhouette*

*Classified: ???*

*Origin: Unknown*

*Species: Humanoid in form, however, its whole body is perfectly bright white*

*Weight: 208 Kg*

*Height: 210 cm*

*Unique system: Hard surface like skin, super strength, extreme speed, Invulnerability, skilled combatant*

This is one of the entities I was assigned to watch over. I never seen him make any movement ever. And I mean it. The first time I saw him, I thought he was nothing but a statue with an emitting sense of danger. But when one of the guards stated that its alive, I couldn't help but imagine how he could move. One of the guards who are a part of the incident reported that the entity just simply turn himself in.

Scientists would throw bricks, shoot guns, use sledge hammers, and other inflictions, and they all end up with nothing in result. He remained uninjured, even calm the whole entire time. They did try using nuclear weaponry on him, and the radiation ended up being consumed within him. He doesn't seem that threatening at all, but the big problem is that we have no idea who he is and what he does. That's why we're still afraid to go near him.

Now I come face to face with the White Silhouette himself.

I stopped in defeat. There's nowhere else to go than to be tortured by a animalistic zombie or to be crushed to death by the White Silhouette. My eyes shut tight as I dropped to my knees and screamed for mercy. Can ghosts die? Well, I'm about to be answered right about now.

All of the sudden, the cackling stopped. It was replaced with squeals of agony. I slowly open my eyes while turning my head to see the White Silhouette lifting the zombie up by the neck.

The zombie's claws and foot flail animalistically for survival. None of it made a single scratch on the towering white pilar of a man. The White Silhouette forced the zombie to glare into his dark solid eyes. He slammed the zombie's head down to the ground, obliterating it into a puddle of flesh and bone. A bit of shattered bone and blood landed on my hair.

He looked at me with those dark beady eyes. At this point, I knew I can't outrun him. If I run, he's just gonna appear right in front of me under a second or so. So, I shut my eyes again in surrender, hearing his footsteps getting closer.

To my absolute surprise, he brushed off the bones and blood within my hair. He then pulled me up by the shoulders and started brushing off the skin and dust on my uniform. I opened my eyes, face-to-face with the White Silhouette. "Do not be frightened, little man. He's gone."

"You can talk!?"

"Yes."

For what apparent reason, my fear just dropped down into nothing. "Then why the hell couldn't you just talk before?!"

"Because I don't feel like it."

I didn't know what to say. I'm completely speechless. He could've just said something but instead he just doesn't feel like it. That, to me, sounds absolutely absurd.

My mind reels to a realization, swiping away the absurd response. "You can see ghosts!"

"Ghost? There's no such thing as ghost."

I was going to protest, but stopped myself to reflect the situation I'm in. How did he come to earth? Did he come here by riding a UFO or what? And how is he able to see me while I'm dead? And the 4 entities can see me as well.

"Do you know which way is the exit."

"What?" I asked with bewilderment.

"Exit."

We both stared at each other for what felt like minutes. Until I broke the silence. "It's uh.... at the.... You go...." I am at a loss of words, whilst pointing to the direction behind him. He turned to look at the direction and went to look back to me. "Lead me the way." He said as he gives way for me to pass.

I was going to say something, but I gave up and started guiding him to the exit. I'm starting to have hope he might beat those entities. But can he really? I can't tell who's the strongest, of course. They remain a complete mystery to me. Most of the entities in this facility never answered our questions completely. In attempts on pushing the entities to answer, they get in return a slow and agonizing death. Some entities would just stand coldly, refusing to cooperate. If I were those entities, I would tell those scientists to mind their own business too, because I sure don't think they'd give a shit about my life.

As we went our way to the exit, I wondered of his life: his habits, and other kinds of stuff that should take interest into. Asking a question wouldn't hurt for an alien like himself, would it? "So, who are you anyway?"

"I am a man." He said blankly.

"Oh." Is all I could let out from my mouth. Judging by the tone of his voice, he doesn't seem to like to spill out stuff about himself. However, I still question. "Ok. How did you get here?"

"I jumped here."

"What do you mean by 'jumped here'?"

"I jump from world to world."

"So, you just jumped like 'jump into space, then to here?" I said, struggling to come up with some sentence to get a clear answer.

"Yes."

My face dropped with confusion. I jumped to the other question. "Where are you from?"

He didn't answer. His eyes narrowed, as if he had this painful reminder in his mind. I dare not to push him, worrying I might get crushed into extinction.

We stopped and found ourselves to a dead end. My jaw dropped in absolute disbelief, taking in the reality that is in front of me. The exit was no longer available to use for eternity. My hopes of escaping started to fall apart as I embrace my fate. Will this place be my hell? It doesn't look like the hell I expected it to be.

I fall to my knees and started scratching the irritating itch in my hair. "No! No! No! No! That was the exit!" I winced.

I yelp when I felt a hard grip around my shoulder. The White Silhouette pulled me up and hold both my shoulders, forcing me to face him. His face was enough to make me speechless. "We will find another exit." He said with such pity in his voice. His voice evokes calmness that makes me sound like I'm the crazy one.

"Find another exit?! How?! There isn't any Other-" In an instant, my mind recollects the memory, cutting me mid sentence. It was a lightbulb that came to life over my head.

"I changed my mind. There's another exit. But you'll need to get the privilege key to get it activated." Privilege keys are given by the highest ranks of the facility, meaning commanders and administrators holds them in case of emergency use. However, there's only about 10 to 15 of them available for each administrator in the group. Which means the keys are scarce at this point.

He dropped me down and ambled away. "We'll find the key together. Or you can stay here. Your decision."

He walked away, leaving me to ponder my own life. I thought I didn't need anyone's help through the journey. But consider the fact that there are a bunch of crazy beasts in this place, I don't think I can do this alone. If I want to get to my sister, I have escape this place. And to escape, I have to deal with a bunch of entities that can easily tear me to shreds. And to deal with those entities, I needed help.

I used to wish to be in a team when I was a kid, around 5 or 6 in grade 1. But of course they never let me in. Nobody ever did. And the curse still passes throughout my entire life at school. Even this job too. Overtime, I got so used to being alone. And sometimes, I think of myself to be the bad luck charm people despised so much. Without the memories to let me know I had a sister that does care about me, I would sometimes think I deserved to be alone.

Even though I still wanted to remain alone, at the same time I didn't want to be. He may be one of those god killers or something, but he didn't kill me there at the spot. Neither does the reports say anything about him killing humans.

So, I asked myself: How else will I be able to escape like this?

After a long minute battle of choice, I inhaled with gripping fists, then exhaled the reluctance that fills my chest. I turned and ran to catch up with the White Silhouette. "Wait! I'm coming with you."

He didn't turn around while I ran up to him. I swear I could tell he's smiling. Not the kind of smile of mockery. A smile that sends this sense of appreciation that aids you in your favor.

As we scavenge around side-by-side, we began chatting to each other like people. I was the one who started it. I knew deep down I wanted to have someone to talk to for a really long time. I thought I gave up on that, but I never realized that I haven't.

"You should have a name."

"Yes."

"So your name is yes?" I said jokingly. I'm not good with jokes. But I thought maybe we could have something to be chatting about while we're stuck scavenging for the privilege key.

He grunted before saying. "No. But my name is incomprehensible to English."

"Well, could you at least tell me though?"

"No."

"But I just want to hear you say it?"

"No."

After many trials and errors of asking, I ended up accepting that he won't tell me his real name. He just answered No, No, and No. Same answer.

For some reason I considered giving him a name. I kept brainstorming for a name that would best suit for himself. A title or just a godly name. Zeus? Ra? Odin? Heracles? The Jade Emperor?

A spark came to life in my thoughts. A name that might perfectly fit for such a guy like himself.

"How about, Mighty Leo Whitefang?" That's right. I took the name from a fighting game. Kind of suits him because... It just does...

"No." And the same answer comes back again.

"What?! But that name sounds cool." I was offended he would deny my offer.

He drew out a small rectangular piece of metal out of the pocket from his jeans, and stared at it for a couple of seconds before he spoke. "Brock."

"Really? Brock. Why don't you pick something much better than that?"

"What's wrong with Brock?"

"It's just... It doesn't suit you. I mean, look at you, you're some sort of guy who can kill gods or-"

"Do not call me that!" He growls with rage, cutting me mid sentence blankly. I froze in place in complete petrification. His eyes were both mixed with rage and fear. Is there something wrong about being a God Killer? Maybe he had a similar experience as the war veterans? Maybe, war veterans and God-killers have a similar path of horror?

He sighed and patted my shoulder with regret. "Sorry. Please. Not a word of it." For such a foreign alien himself, he looked vulnerable like how a human being would regret something they've done. It's enough for me to just leave it to himself and keep the questions to myself.

Something bellowed in the halls far across us, sending chills through my blood. We both turned our heads to glare at an eldritch entity obstructing our path, with 2 security guards standing by its sides.

*Entity #663*

*Title: The 4th Elder*

*Classified: Baal*

*Origin: The realm of nightmares*

*Species: Eldritch Deity, God*

*Weight: 146 Kg*

*Height: 215.1 cm*

*Unique system: Hypnotism, hallucination, mind control, infection, world shift*

I've read reports about this entity. And they're all expressed with fear in their writing. writing about seeing their dead relatives cry for heaven in the abyss, symptoms of sickness, seeing what's beyond hell for the first time, and feeling like their body is contorted, spiraling into nothingness. The officers managed to have caught it by wearing hazard suits with solar rifles. It took about 146 casualties, and 243 of the survivors were left traumatized after the contamination is complete. Then, days later, they left letters before ending their lives in the dark.

My eyes widen as I stare into the eyes of an eldritch god. I wanted to scream, but my voice got stuck in my throat, I couldn't let out a single word. Brock guarded me with his left arm, standing 2 steps forward. "Stand your guard, little man."

The mention of him calling me a little man irritated me enough to find my voice in a nanosecond. "I'm Phil! Not little man!" I scowled.

The 4th Elder slowly points his crooked skeletal finger at us. The 2 security guards started writhing madly, morphing into hideous contorted demons. Sharp appendages protruded out of their heads and started to tear off parts of their torso. Their heads slowly rise from where their necks were supposed to be. Their faces stare up and wailed to the sky. Their wail raspy and chilling.

Their heads snapped at us and screeched with vile intentions. They stormed towards us with flailing appendages. I felt my lungs drop down to the floor. If I was alive, I would instead shit myself.

As soon as they reached us, Brock slapped their upper bodies into oblivion with his fist, creating a large axis of blood. Unfortunately, under a second, their bodies bundled itself together; regenerating their upper bodies like a sped up growing plant. They were about to swing their axe formed arms. I ducked down, nearly getting my head sliced apart. Brock blocked them, but was sent crashing into the right side of the wall.

One minion charges after him, leaving his comrade with me. The hair at the back of my neck rose when I stared deep into its milky eyes. It makes me imagine the face of a boogey man staring into my soul.

It flails its axe at lightspeed, which should've just turned me into small cubicles. Shockingly unbelievable, in my instincts, I evaded every single strike. My movements were lightning fast, combating the morbid creature's own speed. I don't think I have organs anymore. I'm not knowledgeable over physics, but at this speed, my organs would be misplaced in various parts of my body. You know, like shaking a tube of M&Ms. Can spirits be this fast? If so, we'd definitely outrun the devil from Hades, probably winning the award to go to the best hotel in the world.

I attempted to strike back with a punch against its twisted head. It didn't flinch nor had any sign of pain, which had me being stupid. It thunderously headbutted my face, sending me soaring far off into the halls. I don't know how far I've travelled. Probably 20 blocks far? If my math teacher knew what I was thinking right now, he'd slap my face with a ruler hard enough to knock me unconscious.

The creature jolted towards me at lightning speed. It pinned me to a stop with a blow of its foot against my abdomen. The entire core of my back jolted with immense pain. I tried to get back up, but its foot was pinning me down and its sharp appendages were slicing me whole. I was blocking them by raising my forearms as a shield, yet they cut through as if my arms were a ghost. What surprises me was how my body haven't cut into pieces yet.

It hurled me out of the ground, sending me crashing into the ceiling. I barely had enough time to react as it hops towards me and grabbed my leg, tossing me around, crashing into walls. Though it's both annoying and painful, that somehow didn't get me exhausted. With every pain I take, the urge to lash out grows higher.

My body crashed into a wall. As soon as it was going to impale my face with its sharp hook, I ducked like never before. I get to lash out everything I got. With just a punch in the gut, it blew up into annihilation. Nothing left of the creature could indicate its survival. I was absolutely shocked about this strength. I didn't know what else to expect of myself. It didn't work at the first time, yet it worked at the second. I guess taking in every punch or infliction charges up my first strike? There's so much things to know about being a ghost.

You know, at this moment I could've just ran away, leaving Brock to fight his own battle. But part of me needed him. Not that I would like to, but I just needed his help. He saved me from that living corpse. Most of all, we were talking to each other as if we're... I don't know if I have the guts to admit it. And I don't believe I could fight those 4 other entities alone.

So, I bolted through the halls, to see if Brock was still alive. I nearly slipped on a puddle of blood, by the way.

Suddenly, Brock and the 4th Elder crashed through the wall, a block away from crushing into me. The Elder gained the upper hand, pummelling Brock to the ground with his fists. Brock caught the 4th Elder's throat and headbutted him right in the forehead. The 4th Elder jolted upward, staggering backwards. Brock bolted back up in a standing position and immediately threw a punch at the stomach. The 4th Elder belched before he slammed his fist at Brock, sending him crashing through walls.

When 4th Elder caught sight of my presence with those 4 sharp demonic irises, terror overtook my face, knowing that I'm about to get fucked. Before he could draw out an object from his cloak, Brock leapt out of the hole and tackled the Elder. The Elder was unfazed as he ski backwards with his feet against the ground. Brock knocks the Elder's head with an elbow strike, not giving him time to charge back.

They exchanged blows while they launch each other into walls. When their knuckles meet, a powerful gust of air and light blasted in all directions, blowing me off my footing. I landed on my back, shocked of the explosion of wind. I wondered how powerful the collision was. Would it be strong enough to destroy a city or even a continent?

To my surprise, the entirety of the hall around us didn't collapse. More mysteries about this place has left with no answers. It kind of makes me nuts, because what in the flying fuck is this place made out of?! And how is this place not yet collapsing when Brock and the Elder are literally crashing everywhere! And their strikes should be enough to destroy buildings!

I sat up and watched the 4th Elder draw out his pendulum. They both froze in silence. I knew what the Elder was doing, so I sprang back up to break the hypnotism. Just as I was about to strike the pendulum, I was smacked in the head harder than getting hit by a car. I collapsed and hit the back of my head against the ground. Helplessly, my mind starts to slowly lose conscious.

At this point, I thought Brock was going to become one of the Elder's new minions. But, something unexpected happened while I was holding on to my conscious. I can hear something shatter into bits. I heard the Elder spoke his first words I've ever heard from him. ***The destroyer of worlds...*** Just as he said it, a loud crunch emitted from the Elder's chest. Then, at the same time, I heard a sickening crunch, and I passed out into a deep sleep.
