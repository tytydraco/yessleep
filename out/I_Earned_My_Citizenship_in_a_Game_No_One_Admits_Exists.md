I crossed the border when I was 17. No plan. No papers. Just enough fear to keep me running, and enough desperation to keep me moving forward.

I worked under fake names for years. Kitchens, factories, farms. Never stayed in one place too long. Just long enough to eat and not freeze.

Then one night, my burner phone lit up.

**"You have been chosen."**

That was it. No number. No context.

I thought it was some cartel scam. I showed it to an older guy at work. He went pale and stopped talking to me completely the next day.

Two nights later, a van was waiting outside the shelter I was crashing at. No markings. Just two guys in dark uniforms. They didn’t ask. They told.

They said I could either be deported, or I could “participate” in a federal program that offered a clean path to citizenship — housing, papers, full legal status… and enough money to live like a king.

All I had to do was win.

They blindfolded me, zip-tied my hands, and shoved me into the van.

When the blindfold came off, I was in a massive underground facility.

Steel walls. Surveillance drones. Barbed wire fences. And people. A lot of people.

There weren’t 10 of us.

There were **137**.

All undocumented. All young. All fit. They'd clearly been screening us for a while.

We were each assigned a number. I was **#62**.

Then the rules were explained.

The program was called **"The Ascent."**  
One winner.  
One million dollars.  
Full U.S. citizenship.  
New identity.  
Complete erasure of your past.

Everyone else? *“Returned.”*

But we found out quickly that “returned” didn’t always mean deported.

Some of us died the first night.

Trial 1: A nighttime sprint across a forest crawling with motion sensors and things that weren’t animals.

Trial 2: A puzzle in a collapsing building. Ten people crushed under falling beams.

Trial 3: Combat trials. One-on-one. No rules.

They kept us sleep-deprived, hungry, paranoid. Every day they’d wake us with sirens and pipe in distorted voices through the speakers, whispering things like **“Only the strong earn freedom”** and **“This is your interview.”**

By Day 10, we were down to 20.

I didn’t know most of their names. We weren’t allowed to talk. But we all knew: this wasn’t a game.

It was a **hunt.**

Some contestants didn’t even get killed by the tests. They snapped. Took each other out. Some just walked off and let themselves be taken. You’d hear screaming, then nothing.

Day 12 was the final trial: a labyrinth filled with traps and drones.

Only one exit.

No map.

No rules.

The others went in fast. Loud. Aggressive. I waited. Moved slow. Hid when I could. Outlasted them.

When I found the exit, there were no guards. Just a steel door and a spotlight.

On the other side, a single man in a suit handed me a briefcase, a passport, and a brand new life. The briefcase had a bank card. I checked the balance later:

**$1,200,000.**

He shook my hand and said:

**"You are now a citizen. Tell anyone, and you lose everything. Including your life."**

That was six years ago.

I live in a nice suburb now. I have a clean name. A business. I drive a car that turns heads. Nobody suspects anything.

But it never really ended.

Every year, I get a package with no return address. It always contains two things:

A flash drive with footage from the newest “season” of *The Ascent*…

…and a list.

This year, my name wasn’t on it.

But there was a note.

**"You are now a selector. Do your part. Good luck."**

So now I get to pick the next 100.

And I can’t say no.

Because *no one ever leaves The Ascent.*
