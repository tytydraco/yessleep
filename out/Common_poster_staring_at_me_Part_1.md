It came into our shop like any other work related poster. Smiling faces and an employee actively doing something to remind us what a good worker is. Or a poster job advertisement about growth, opportunity and teamwork.

It didn’t seem like it would be menacing or distracting by any means.

It was a bald white man organizing a fuel filter on a parts rack. His teeth glistening white, his complexion shined with his bald head, his hands were clean (about the only thing off, mechanics hands are rarely clean), and his outfit looked new & pressed (another thing that  was definitely a falsehood).

It came in a week before Halloween. We weren’t suppose to decorate anything in or around the checkin work desk. (We were told it would distract from what we were selling and we had to keep it professional).

I came in early, 7am (my shift is normally 930am). My boss was putting up the bald white man work poster while I was sipping my morning coffee from my favorite tin thermos (it was my grandmothers and it gave me comfort).

Jim (Boss)- “I am being told the new policies, new tablets with new system will be in tomorrow around noon. So expect delays on the work orders. We will have to do old fashion paper.”

Me (Kimberly) - “I need help more than anything. They just seem like they don’t want to stay and work anymore.”

Jim - “It is coming Kim. Too much weirdos and druggies these days. Hard to keep a straight face with all the stories I’ve been hearing why they are quitting and such.”

Me- “ I can’t do it all on my own. We are down to three and the night guy is shifty. Always taking about how he is being stared at. “

Jim- “yeah, I will look into that later. We got corporate coming in later today. So if you need anything I will be in the head office next to the fuel island.”

We normally would start with small talk and bullshit for 10-15 minutes but when corporate was coming same day Jim was cleaning dust off old cans and window sills.

The new poster in my work station was probably the most crisp looking one yet. Most of my shift was normal until I had to get off later at 830pm because the night guy was showing up late.

Me-“Dammit Bobby, this is the second time this week! You know I have to look after my elderly neighbor Jacky and her dog Pooch. She is going to rip into tonight because we are supposed to watch old reruns of the price is right and jeopardy.”

Bobby- “Listen now, I’m sorry and I know that isn’t enough but I haven’t been sleeping right. Starting to think there is a curse or sickness going around. Anyways I’m going to try to do better. I gotcha, see you tomorrow Kim.”

I got to my neighbor Jacky’s house to be visited by her dog Pooch at the front door. Jacky didn’t wait to watch her reruns, she couldn’t be upset at me because she was fast asleep in her favorite lazy boy chair with a quilt she knitted a month prior. I decided to go to the kitchen and pantry to see if she needed groceries, she drank through milk like a teenager practicing thru football hell week. So I already knew that was on the list. With the milk in my hand, I sipped the last of it she always kept for me or the neighborhood cats. I jokingly said “meow” after I got to the last drop and my phone rang. 

Strange Voices came from it.
- “You got it sweetheart, keep ped…”static*
- “You’ll never make it if you keep that attitude…” static* “Somethings down there, way…” static*
Me - “Hello? Who is buttdailing me!?” I laughed.
Me - “ok, bye…”
 
I tapped the red end button softly. Thinking about how my father used to say those exact words. “You got it sweetheart!”, when it was the most important to me and most memorable. That was meaningful to me, “you got it.”

The next morning was great, the boss and I were now more relaxed that corporate came thru and did what they normally do. 

“Chatter, Correct and Complex, The triple C’s that bother you and me.” - Jim laughed and grinned tightly. Exhaling a weight off his round stomach and bold shoulders.

We both knew what it met… 
More work, less pay and the old “atta boy!” after you change a slight disorganized display or answer a certain email review. Corporate lived for reviews, they thought those were answers to problems and commission is payroll.

It was 5 days until Halloween and somebody’s kid’s candies will be under my desk because of dad tax. That was the highlight of the week for me. Everything else went smoothly except some unruly customers that didn’t want to pay for their repairs.

At night though, Bobby didn’t show. It was 9pm and I called him several times. At least six text messages and 3 voicemails. I was getting sick of this shit. 

The poster, I could’ve sworn it moved. At least the eyes. When I laughed it up with Jim this morning, I might have thought it smiled more… like it was laughing at our dark sense of humor. Every shop makes bad jokes but no one goes unnoticed or disregarded. It felt like I was missing something, someone, or… Nevermind it’s getting late. My neighbor Jacky has her sister over so I’m okay to not show. I closed shop and called Jim, he was as upset as I was and said he would call around tomorrow.

On the drive home I was aggravated, I was speeding home and I just sick of the day to day.
Blue and Red Light appeared behind me, I pulled over on the I-20 next to my exit (only a few miles from home, so close.)

Officer Dan - “Oh it’s Kimberly, dude you know how fast you were going?”

Me - “Dan, just tell me and give me my damn ticket! I’m trying to make it home!”

Officer Dan - “You’ll never make it if you keep that attitude.”

Dans radio played static and made a series of beeps.

Officer Dan - “Damn thing been acting up all night.”
