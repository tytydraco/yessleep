The past six months had been hell.
I lost my job, which made my girlfriend leave me too. For months, I couldn’t find anything, and when I finally did, it was just a gas station gig. A few days later, my mom died in a car accident.
That broke me completely, and I got fired from the gas station too.
By then, I had been unemployed for nearly half a year. I was completely broke. I had almost no savings left, and I spent the last of it on paying rent. After that, I had no idea what to do.
There was no one I could borrow money from. My mom had been the only one I could turn to—my dad left us when I was a kid, and I had no idea where he even was.
I absolutely had to find work, but back then, unemployment was skyrocketing. Everyone was looking for a job. My situation felt hopeless.
That’s when I came across a listing on a job site, and it instantly caught my attention:


-24/7 shift work, immediate start.-


The only requirement was a valid driver’s license. The pay? Suspiciously high.
But what did I have to lose? If I didn’t find a job soon, I’d end up on the street anyway.


The ad only listed a phone number—applicants were supposed to call it. I didn’t overthink it. I just called. But after a minute of ringing, they hung up on me. I figured, whatever—probably a thousand people applied anyway. Another dead end. But just as I put my phone down, I got a text from the number I’d called.
It read:


“We can only communicate in writing. It’s more convenient for us.”


I didn’t care, as long as they hired me, they could use smoke signals for all I cared. They asked me to briefly write who I was and why I applied. So I told them the truth. Soon enough, they replied that I was a good fit. They asked when I could start. It all felt suspicious as hell—but I didn’t give a damn anymore. I had literally nothing to lose. 
I accepted the job.
Then they texted me a GPS coordinate and told me to be there at exactly 8 AM the next morning. The location was a train station parking lot not far from where I lived. Two thoughts immediately crossed my mind:
Either they were going to harvest my organs… Or I’d just walked into some kind of pyramid scheme.
Still, as sketchy as it all sounded, I was there by 8 the next morning. I had no idea what—or who—I was supposed to look for. That’s when a pudgy, bald, middle-aged guy walked up to me. He looked like a school janitor or something.
Then he said:


“You Steve?”


I just nodded. Yeah, I was the guy who applied for the job.
The chubby man led me to the parking lot, where an ancient Dodge Caravan was parked. I could barely believe my eyes when he told me this would be my work vehicle.
My grandpa used to drive something like this when I was a kid. He opened the trunk and pulled out a cardboard box. He said everything I’d need was in there. Then he handed me a few papers to sign. I skimmed them quickly—just the usual stuff about labor laws and my contract. The bald guy wished me good luck, then handed me a thousand dollars in cash.
I froze. Why was I being paid so much, up front? He said it was a sign of trust, and that I’d get the rest of my pay when I returned.
If I had any questions or problems, I should text the same number I applied through. Then he gave me the keys… and just walked away.
I opened the box and started loading the stuff into the car.
It had everything: a security guard uniform, a flashlight, a ton of pre-packaged sandwiches, and two large bottles of water. There was also a small manual labeled:
“User Manual.”
The first page had a short list of rules:
• You must wear the uniform at all times during the 24-hour shift.
• Your pay is only granted if you stay on-site for the full 24 hours.
I didn’t read much more than that at first. I flipped ahead to the page that said where I was supposed to go. It was another GPS coordinate. I punched it into my phone to see where it led. It pointed to a seemingly empty field just outside of town.
Weird…But if that’s what they wanted—fine.
I’d already been paid part of the money anyway.


The drive was pretty uneventful. I punched the coordinates into my GPS—it was easy enough to follow the directions. The trip took about an hour and a half. Once I got off the highway, I passed through a small town—one of those typical, quiet places. From there, it was just another ten minutes down a narrow road, and then the GPS told me to turn onto a small dirt path leading into the woods. There were tire tracks in the soil, so clearly others had driven there before. I figured it was safe enough and drove in. The trees were dense, and their branches scraped against the sides of the car as I made my way through. Then suddenly, I emerged from the forest.
A wide, empty lot opened up in front of me.
My phone beeped: You have arrived at your destination. It really was just an empty field.
No trees grew here—or maybe they'd been cleared out. The grass was dry and yellow, like it hadn’t rained in ages, and clearly no one had watered it either. I had no idea what I was supposed to be guarding out here in the middle of nowhere. But fine—what else did I have going on? Then I remembered the manual's note: I was only allowed to work in the provided uniform.
So I got out of the car and changed. I looked like some awkward mall cop reject. Just then, my phone buzzed. Another text from that same number:


"Welcome to the company. Good luck on your first shift. Your 24 hours have officially begun."


Time passed slowly. At first, I just sat in the car, unsure of what I was supposed to do. I ate one of the sandwiches. By the afternoon, I got tired of sitting and decided to take a walk around the field—to see what I was even guarding. But I didn’t find anything. It was just an empty lot. No fence, no buildings. The tree line roughly marked the boundary of the area.
Some of the trees had signs posted on them:
PRIVATE PROPERTY – NO TRESPASSING.
I got hungry again, so I went back to the car and ate another sandwich. Then I waited some more. That’s when I remembered the manual. Maybe there was more about what I was supposed to be doing. I flipped through it and read the next set of instructions:
• No one is allowed on the property. If anyone enters, politely ask them to leave.
• No audio or video recordings may be made on the premises.
• Do not fall asleep during your shift. Perform your duties diligently.
• Do not leave the property unless specifically instructed to do so, or you will not be paid.
• If you find a package on the premises, place it in the trunk and bring it to the rendezvous point.
That part really made me pause—what kind of package would show up here? Dropped from a plane, maybe? I started getting nervous, thinking maybe I’d gotten myself into something illegal. But then again… why would they make me sign an employment contract?
The mafia doesn’t really do paperwork. I laughed to myself at the idea.


Then flipped ahead in the manual—there were no more general instructions, so I kept reading. A few pages later, the booklet laid out a time-based schedule with specific tasks. But even the first one struck me as strange:
• 00:45 – Please feed the dog.
What dog? Was this some kind of cover story, like in the movies where they use code names for things? Or… was there actually a dog out here somewhere? Whatever the case, I had already missed the time. I let it go.
• 02:22 – Please drive the metal rod into the ground at the northwest corner of the lot.
Metal rod? I hadn’t seen anything like that. Maybe I missed it.
• 04:30 – Please remove the metal rod.
Place it back where you found it.
• 08:41 – Please politely ask the boy on the bicycle to leave.
I arrived after those times, so I didn’t pay attention to them.
• 16:10 – For your own safety, please remain inside the provided vehicle until 16:30.
That one made my stomach drop. I checked my phone—it was 16:01. I stared out the windshield, counting down the seconds in dread.
16:09:57
16:09:58
16:09:59
16:10:00.


And suddenly the air around me felt heavier. Still. Nothing happened. The field remained exactly the same. The trees swayed gently in the breeze. It was still just a mild May Wednesday. But I didn’t dare move.
I stayed curled up in the car until 16:30 on the dot. The only thing I saw was a magpie taking off from the field. Nothing out of the ordinary.
At 16:30 I finally got out and walked around the lot. Still the same. Just like when I’d arrived around ten in the morning.
I was getting seriously anxious now.
What the hell was this job?
It felt like some messed-up game show. I half expected to find myself on YouTube the next day as the butt of some elaborate prank. I climbed back into the car and flipped open the manual again. After that, I had to know what else was in there. Among the instructions, only one remained:
• If you are lacking anything, please inform us via the contact number.
So I decided to keep reading the rest of the day’s schedule—see what I still needed to be aware of.
• 18:00 – When the vehicle arrives, please indicate whether you followed today’s instructions. If you did, raise your right hand high enough to be visible. If you didn’t, please raise your left hand. I let out a long sigh.
Another meaningless task. What vehicle?
Why do I need to signal whether I followed their weird little rules? And what happens if I raise the left hand?


At exactly 18:00, a vehicle showed up. It didn’t come out onto the field. A black pickup. Two people were inside, but they were too far to make out. I stood next to my own car, watching them, wondering when I was supposed to signal. Then the pickup gave a short honk, as if to say, We’re waiting.
I quickly raised my right hand high. The truck pulled forward a little, but it never came closer. It turned around at the edge of the lot, then drove right back down the narrow dirt road—the same way I came in. I scratched my head, baffled.
What the hell was this job?
All I had to do was watch over an empty field and obey these ridiculous instructions.
I laid the manual down on the car’s hood again and flipped to the next task.
• 22:33 – If you see someone on the field, please politely ask them to leave.
EXCEPT IF IT’S THE OLD MAN! Leave him alone—he will leave on his own by 23:00.
Yeah, I wasn’t thrilled about this one. Chasing strangers off a dark field in the middle of the night? What the hell was going on here? The rest of my afternoon passed calmly. I sat on the field, went for a walk, or rested in the car.


There was something weirdly peaceful about the place—so naturally calm. If it weren’t for those absurd tasks, I might’ve even enjoyed it.
But my stomach twisted whenever I thought about spending the entire night out here. I checked the schedule to see what else awaited me. After the 22:33 task, the next one wasn’t until 05:40, which simply said:
• Let the deer cross the field.
That finally gave me some comfort—at least it sounded normal.
As evening came, the temperature started to drop, and I figured it’d be best to stay in the car. I was scrolling on my phone—well, more like browsing job listings. No matter how well they promised to pay for this, if they even paid the rest, I didn’t want to do this a day longer than I had to. With no better idea, I started watching a movie on my phone. I know, I broke a rule, but I ended up dozing off. Not for long—maybe half an hour—and I hoped nobody had noticed, if anyone was even watching me.
Then I checked the time: 10:35 PM. Shit. I had to check if someone was on the field. I grabbed the flashlight and stepped out of the car, nervous. I swept the beam across the field—nothing. Still empty, like always. Or… so I thought.


A bit farther off, near the trees, someone was there. A young woman in a red dress with white spots.
She was having a picnic. There was a red checkered blanket laid out, a picnic basket, a bottle of wine, and some snacks. I had zero desire to walk over. Who the hell picnics at almost 11 PM in the middle of nowhere? And how the hell did she get here?
I swallowed hard to summon the courage. No way I was risking my payment after enduring the whole damn day. I braced myself and walked over slowly, trying to hide how freaked out I was. The woman was sitting there, cheerful and smiling with a lovely face, struggling to open the wine. She hadn’t even noticed me:


“Excuse me, ma’am, I’m afraid you can’t be here. This is private property,” I said politely, though my voice trembled from the nerves.


“Oh my god, you scared me!” she squealed. “I didn’t even see you there!”
She seemed totally normal. Like it was a sunny Saturday morning and she was just relaxing in the park.


“Ma’am, I’m going to have to ask you to leave,” I repeated, still politely.


“Oh! I didn’t know,” she said with mild surprise. “But wouldn’t you like to join me for the picnic instead?”


I glanced around, confused and tense. What the hell is this now? But the guide had been clear—I had to ask her to leave. So I stuck to the plan.


“I’m afraid I can’t, ma’am,” I replied with a slightly trembling voice. “You can’t picnic here. Please leave.”


“Alright…” she said softly. “But could you help me up?”


She gently extended her hand for assistance. I took her small, slender hand—it was warm and soft, like she’d been lounging on a beach, not sitting in a damp forest. I helped her up, and she began brushing off her dress, straightening it delicately.


“Would you mind packing up the picnic basket for me?” she asked with a sweet smile.


I didn’t answer. Just nodded anxiously. Anything to get her gone. I bent down to fold the red blanket and grab the wine bottle—and I took my eyes off her for just a second. But when I looked up— she was gone. Like she’d never existed at all. I panicked. Sweat poured down my back. My throat tightened like I’d swallowed a stone. There was no sign of her.
No movement. No sound. Nowhere to hide, yet she had simply vanished. Without saying a word, I walked back to the car. I got in, started it up, and turned on every light I could. I stared out the windshield, barely moving, for what felt like hours—until dawn finally broke.
That’s when I saw a herd of deer emerging from the woods, slowly crossing the field.
One of them stopped, stared at my car for a moment, then followed the rest. I was getting really tired, but there wasn’t much time left in my shift. I didn’t get out of the car until the sky was fully lit. There were no more tasks listed in the handbook for Thursday, so I could finally relax. I walked to the spot on the field where the woman had been picnicking the night before. But there was no trace of her. No blanket, no basket—nothing. Instead, there was a small box. A tiny wooden crate, carefully sealed, with a red ribbon tied around it. Two stickers were on the front: one read “Fragile”, the other, oddly, said “Do not open until 13:78.”
I didn’t even bat an eye at that—just another strange thing in a string of strange things.
I remembered the instructions, so I picked it up and placed it on the backseat of the car.


I waited a few more hours. The day grew warmer. The sun lit up the entire field, peaceful and serene. It felt like I was just camping out in nature. At last, ten o’clock came. Soon after, I received a text:


“Thank you for your service. Your shift is now over. Please return to the rendezvous point.”


Attached was a GPS coordinate—back to the train station, where I’d first met the chubby man. The drive back was rough. I stopped in the small town for food and coffee to keep myself awake. I had eggs and bacon—my first hot meal after a bizarre 24 hours. It felt surprisingly good to leave that strange yet peaceful place behind.
When I arrived at the station, the same man was already there, looking just as tired and dull as before.


“What the hell is going on at that place?” I asked as I handed him the keys.



“I don’t even know where you were,” he said flatly  and  just shrugged. “But here’s your envelope. They said there’s a little bonus in there since you followed all the instructions.”


“Who said that?” I asked immediately.


“The Company. I don’t know, man. I just go where they tell me. They pay great, and that’s all I care about.”


I didn’t know what to say. He was just another worker like me, just in a different role.



“Go home. Get some sleep,” the man added as he got into his car. “If they gave you a bonus already, they’ll probably call you again.”


And with that, he drove off. I stood there, not sure if I’d dreamed the past day or not. I went home, finally took a shower, and after more than 24 hours awake, I crashed hard. But before I slept, I opened the envelope. For one day of work, they paid me five thousand dollars—plus the thousand I got up front.
I think I’ll go back.


I took two days off.
Finally, with that money, I paid off all my debts and could finally sleep in peace. But I still didn’t have a proper job. I applied to quite a few normal positions, but it was like no one needed me anywhere. Even my neighbor lost his job. Things were rough in the city, that’s for sure. The news kept saying the crisis was inevitable—factories were shutting down, people were getting laid off.
That evening, my phone buzzed again. It was that number—the familiar one.


“Steve, there’s another shift available tomorrow. Interested?”


I hesitated.
That place was strange. I was wary of it… but something about it pulled me back. That kind of money—just for following some rules and paying attention to weird tasks?
I said yes.
Once again, I was at the train station at 8 a.m.
The car showed up—same brown Dodge Caravan as last time—and the same fat guy was driving it. He looked cheerful this time, already grinning at me knowingly.


“Told ya you’d be back, Steve,” the fat guy said with a smug grin. “Good pay, right?” 


I gave him an awkward smile and nodded.
Same setup as before.
He handed me the thousand dollars up front, a cardboard box with my gear, and the day's instructions. Then I took the keys and drove out of the city. The coordinates led to the same place again—through the small town, into the woods, and finally to the field.
I parked in the same corner of the property, where I could keep a good eye on everything.
But this time, I figured I’d read the manual ahead of time—didn’t want to get caught off guard like before. The handbook was identical to the one I had last time, with just one difference: instead of Wednesday, it now said Saturday on the cover.
The rules were the same as last time.
But the schedule? Completely different.
• 04:51 – Do not worry about the horses, they’re just grazing. You may approach them if you’d like. (Missed that one again.)
• 11:29 – A bird must be seen flying high. If you don’t see it, immediately text the contact number and leave the premises.
• 13:34 – Please put on the raincoat provided in the box and do not re-enter the vehicle until the rain has stopped. When done, place the raincoat in the trunk.
• 15:46 – Let the hikers pass. Greet them back if they greet you.
• 19:91 – Do not die.
What?
I froze in disbelief. What kind of time is 19:91, and what the hell does “Do not die” mean?
I’d already been creeped out by this place, but no one said I could die doing this job. 


I still had ten minutes left to spot the bird. I was sitting closer to the center of the field, the sun was shining down on me, soft clouds crawling across the sky. Everything felt peaceful and calm.
I texted the contact number:


“What’s 19:91 supposed to mean? And what do you mean, don’t die? I’ll quit right now if this is some dangerous shit.”


They replied quickly, assuring me it was just a typo. That this job wouldn’t cost me my life.
Just follow the tasks, and everything would be fine.
I wasn’t reassured. But five thousand dollars for a day’s work? That was reassuring. So I swallowed my nerves and decided that if anything got too weird, I’d just leave. I sat in silence, listening to the wind whistle through the trees. It was peaceful. Almost too peaceful. I felt like I could stay here forever—if not for the bizarre tasks. I kept watching the sky, waiting for the bird. None in sight.
By 11:30, still nothing. I was starting to panic.
How long was I supposed to wait? I was just reaching for my phone again when I finally spotted it. A large bird was circling high above, like it was waiting for something.
Relief flooded through me. At least that box was checked.


I had a couple of hours until the raincoat thing, so I decided to take a walk. It was nice out, and I needed to stretch my legs. The air was fresh, and I felt more prepared this time. I had snacks, drinks—even brought coffee and soda. After a while, I relieved myself behind a tree (no one around, after all), then sat down to eat.
At around 13:30, the sky began to darken. I’d already pulled out the bright yellow raincoat from the box and stood beside the car, waiting. At exactly 13:34, rain began to pour down in sheets. There were clouds, sure—but not the kind that should cause a downpour like this. Something felt off. Rain drummed against the plastic hood of my coat. Every part of me wanted to run to the car—but the rules were clear. I wasn’t risking it. And this rain… It felt salty.Almost like seawater. But we were nowhere near the ocean. Then I noticed something strange. Toward the center of the field, there was a large patch where no rain was falling. Everywhere else, it poured—but in that one square-shaped section, not a single drop. I made my way there slowly, boots sucking into the thick, muddy earth. I stepped into the center of the dry square and looked up—nothing above me. No covering. No drone. No dome. Nothing. But not a single drop touched me. All around, a storm raged.
Inside that square? Absolute calm.


When the rain finally stopped, I trudged back to the car and placed the raincoat in the trunk, just like they asked. Until 15:46, I mostly relaxed again, watching a show on my phone. It was actually kind of comfortable, in a weird way. That’s when I noticed something from the corner of my eye. Two people were walking past my car—both dressed in full hazmat suits, each carrying a large bag. They moved across the field like they knew exactly where they were going. One of them stopped in front of my car and waved. I waved back.
Were these the “hikers” I was supposed to greet?
The two figures continued toward the center of the field. I stepped out of the car and kept watching. They walked the entire field perimeter, stopping briefly at each corner to examine something. They seemed to be talking to each other, but I was too far to hear.
Then, like they'd finished some task, they calmly walked into the woods and vanished between the trees. I figured it was best not to follow them. Easier to pretend this was all perfectly normal. But now… 19:00 was drawing dangerously close.


At exactly 19:00, the clock changed. I sat uncomfortably in the car, tense from that strange line in the manual. The closer it got to nightfall, the less I wanted to be here on this supposedly “peaceful” field. My legs bounced anxiously, and I leaned on the steering wheel, staring out at the open land. Fifteen minutes passed. Nothing happened.
The field was as quiet and still as ever. I figured I might as well check what else was on the list for today. There were more entries after that “do not die” line, which I’d kind of given up on reading earlier.
• 21:41 – If someone is on the property, politely ask them to leave.
• 00:37 – IMPORTANT! If the man in the rabbit mask is alone, immediately tell him he must leave the premises. He is not allowed to stay even one more minute.
If the man in the rabbit mask is with someone, do not approach them, but ask them to leave politely from a distance.
Do NOT follow them under any circumstances!
• 02:32 – If a man is running in circles, ask him to leave.
• 06:17 – Leave the geese alone. They will depart shortly on their own.
I rubbed my eyes, frustrated and nervous. Once again, the most disturbing tasks were saved for night. Then my phone buzzed.
A text from the usual number.


“Please lock your car doors and do not let anyone in. This is important.”


My blood turned cold. What now? Without hesitation, I locked the car from inside. Whatever came next, I was not opening that door. That’s when I saw someone running across the field in the fading light. They were sprinting from the forest, straight toward my car— stumbling, constantly glancing back like they were being chased. As they got closer, I realized—it was one of the “hikers” I’d seen earlier that day. His hazmat suit and gas mask were torn and bloody. He ran up to my car and started pounding on the door, screaming.


“Open up! Please! OPEN THE DOOR!”


I didn’t move. Frozen, I just sat there, unsure what to do. The man grew more frantic, desperately yanking at the door handle, shouting through the mask. And then—
in the blink of an eye—he was gone. Just… gone. One moment screaming, the next emptiness. No trace. I sat motionless, stunned. Minutes passed—felt like hours.
My phone buzzed again.


“Thank you, Steven, for following our instructions. You’ve done a great service to the company. Your perseverance will not go unrewarded.”


My hands trembled as I texted back:


“Did that man just die?”


A reply came instantly.


“No. That man is doing the job he was hired to do.”


I didn’t write back. I locked myself inside the car again—just like last time. I sat in the car, still drowsy. My hands rested on the steering wheel, and I was ready—so ready—to drive off the moment I sensed anything even slightly off. That’s when I noticed the time on my watch. It was 21:41.
I was supposed to check the field to see if anyone was there. Every part of me resisted the idea of getting out. But something pulled me. And maybe it wasn’t just the money anymore. I stepped out of the car but left the headlights on—just in case.
That’s when I saw it: someone was already out there. Another figure. He was sitting on a small wooden bench. An old man.
Just like the woman the other night—he didn’t seem to notice me at first. Not until I got closer.


“Good evening, sir,” I said gently. “I’m afraid you can’t be here. I have to ask you to leave the property.”


The old man flinched and turned toward me with a sleepy, confused look.
“Oh! You startled me. I didn’t even see you coming.”


“Sorry, sir,” I repeated calmly, “but you’re not allowed to stay here. Please, I have to ask you to leave.”


He looked around in panic, as if he wasn’t sure where he was.
“Oh—I'm sorry,” he muttered nervously. “I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to be here. But—where exactly am I?”


I shook my head slightly. I didn’t really know either.


“Huh… doesn’t matter,” the old man mumbled, then added: “But could you give me a hand, son? Help me up, would you?”


He reached out. I took his bony, wrinkled hand. Just like the woman’s hand days ago—it was warm and soft, as if it hadn’t been sitting in the middle of a damp, cold field. There was something comforting about it. Familiar. He stood up with a groan, rubbing his back, wincing.


“Let me tell you something, son,” the old man said once he straightened up. “Trust your instincts. Don’t be afraid. You’ll be fine.”


Then he froze—his gaze fixed over my shoulder, as if he saw something behind me.
I turned in a panic. But it was only the dark forest. When I looked back— he was gone.
Just like that. Only the old wooden bench remained. I trudged back to the car, my mind replaying the old man’s words over and over.
I sat inside and stared at the starry sky, watching the clouds drift quietly across the night. Somehow, the old man had left me with a strange sense of calm. I was still scared—but I no longer felt like I was in real danger. Like… this wasn’t my danger to face.
Not here. Not now. Time passed quicker, too.
It was only when the clock hit 00:35 that I snapped out of it. Two minutes left until the next task—and my stomach tightened into a knot again. After a few tense seconds of scanning the field, I finally saw him—or maybe he had just appeared.
A man stood in the middle of the field, wearing a tuxedo. On his head: a bright white rabbit mask with a cheerful grin. He was alone. Perfectly still.
I took a deep breath and stepped out of the car. My flashlight shook in my hand from nerves. I kept the beam trained on him the whole time as I approached. The rabbit-masked man didn’t move. He stared directly into the light, unflinching. I stopped a few paces away— Something about him made my skin crawl.


“Excuse me, sir,” I called out, voice unsteady. “You’re not allowed here. I need to ask you to leave the property.”


He didn’t respond. Just stood there, unmoving. His face completely hidden by the mask. His tuxedo was muddy and stained—like he’d been sleeping in the dirt all day.


“Sir,” I tried again. “Please leave. You can’t be here.”


He tilted his head slightly— like he was confused. Then, without warning, he took one step toward me. I flinched hard. Part of me wanted to run straight back to the car and leave this entire nightmare behind.


“Sir,” I repeated, trying to sound firm, “you really need to leave. Now.”


But the rabbit-masked man just stood there. Still. Gazing into my flashlight beam. He wasn’t responding—not even reacting. What was I supposed to do? The others had always complied, eventually. But this one… This one didn’t even seem to understand what I was saying. We just stood there—staring at each other. I started thinking back to the manual. It said to ask politely. Politely.
And this guy was wearing a tuxedo. Maybe I hadn’t been respectful enough?


“Dear sir,” I tried again, putting on my most courteous tone, “please allow me to kindly ask you to leave the premises. I’m afraid you’re not permitted to be here.”


And just like that— he moved. Without walking, without a word, he slowly raised one arm and waved at me— a small, parting wave. Then he turned around and began walking across the field, toward the trees. I kept the flashlight on him the whole time, tracking his unsteady steps. But then— he stopped at the forest edge. He turned to face me again. And waved once more. This time, it wasn’t a goodbye. This time, he was beckoning. He wanted me to follow him. I swallowed hard. I didn’t want to follow that thing anywhere. Something about the way he moved—his legs bending the wrong way, his steps unsure and twisted—made my stomach churn. He kept beckoning.
But I just shook my head.
No.
He lowered his arm, almost sadly, then walked into the forest and vanished among the trees.
I was relieved. Terrified, but relieved. Though somehow, it unsettled me even more that he hadn’t disappeared like the others. He had simply walked away. Limped away. Like something real. I returned to the car and climbed inside. Then I locked the doors.
Just in case. I checked the time, waiting for the next scheduled event at 2:32 AM— the man who would be running in circles.


But time… was crawling. I checked the clock every few minutes, but it felt like hours. Still over an hour to go. I leaned my head against the steering wheel, eyes heavy again, as the weight of everything slowly dragged me down into exhaustion. I must’ve dozed off again, because I jolted awake in a panic. Only twenty minutes had passed, but something was off.
The headlights were off— even though I’d left them on after the rabbit-masked man left.
Dead battery?
I flipped the lights off and then back on. They came on instantly. And my heart nearly stopped. The rabbit-masked man was standing a few meters in front of the car. Staring directly at me. But this time—he wasn’t alone. Beside him stood a woman in a long, elegant white evening gown. She wore a black rabbit mask, a mirror to the man’s white one. Her face was completely obscured,
only her long, curly blonde hair blew gently in the breeze. I was terrified. How long had they been standing there? What did they want from me? I’d already sent the man away once—why had he come back? Should I try again? I forced myself to move.
Took a deep breath and stepped out of the car— but didn’t move an inch away from the door. My flashlight trembled in my hand as I pointed it at them.


“I already asked you to leave once,” I said, voice shaky. “I have to ask again—please, leave the property.”


They didn’t move. Just stood there, staring into the beam of the headlights. Panic crawled up my spine. Then— my phone buzzed in my pocket. Still keeping my eyes locked on the two figures, I pulled it out. A text message from the usual number:


"!!!WARNING!!!
THE RABBIT-MASKED INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.
LEAVE THE AREA IMMEDIATELY!!!!"


I didn’t wait a second longer. I jumped back into the car. That’s when I heard the scream—
a sound I couldn’t place. Like a hawk shrieking as it dives for prey— but sharper.
Worse. Then I saw the man in the tuxedo drop to all fours— and charge. Moving far faster than he had before. Like a spider, scuttling with unnatural precision. I slammed my foot on the gas. As I turned the car toward the forest path, the creature caught up.
I heard it slam into the vehicle— then the rear window shattered violently. I didn’t stop.
Didn’t look back.The dirt road was rough, but I pushed the car as fast as it would go.
Then— a violent jolt.
The creature had ripped the rear door clean off. With one pull. I kept driving, bouncing and skidding down the uneven trail. I just wanted out. Then— pain. Excruciating pain in my back. A hand—long, clawed—reached inside, grasping blindly for me. I swerved hard.
The car burst from the trees onto the paved road. The bottom scraped and sparked against the asphalt. I floored it. Didn’t care about anything else. The hand vanished.
And I couldn’t hear anything on the roof anymore. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a black pickup truck racing the opposite direction— the same one as always.
But I didn’t stop. Not even when I noticed blood dripping down my right arm, and my back felt like it was on fire. I drove all the way back. Back to the train station. The fat man was there, waiting for me. But he wasn’t smiling this time. He looked exhausted.
It was nearly 4 AM, and the parking lot was empty except for him. His eyes widened when he saw the car. The back door was missing,
the vehicle torn up with deep gashes and scratches. I stepped out, pale and shaking,
my uniform soaked in blood. A deep slash on my shoulder still leaking steadily.


“I’ll take you to a doctor, son,” the fat man said quietly.


That’s the last thing I heard. I collapsed—
either from the blood loss, or from the weight of the nightmare I’d just lived through.


I woke up in my apartment. It was daytime, and my wounds had been neatly treated. On my nightstand were some pills, and a piece of paper explaining how I should take them. Next to it was a thick envelope with my name on it.
It hurt to move—every part of my body ached—but I was curious about the envelope. Inside was a letter from the Company.
"Steven, thank you for your service. On behalf of the Company, we’d like to apologize for what happened and offer a small honorarium as a token of our appreciation. We hope to work with you again soon. —The Company"
Inside the envelope was ten thousand dollars in cash. I had never had that much money in my life.


For a few days, I stayed locked inside my room. I didn’t want to go out—I was looking for a job. I didn’t want to work for the Company again. The money was good, sure, but my life was more important.
A few weeks later, my wounds were healing, and I found a job. The Company messaged me twice, offering open shifts. I never replied.
It was better that way.
I worked at a 24-hour convenience store in a miserable part of town. The job sucked. My boss was a complete asshole—always yelling at everyone like we were dirt under his shoes. The pay was awful—barely enough to cover the bills. I was slowly burning through the money the Company had given me. Most of my shifts were at night, and the only customers were drunk people, homeless folks, or shady weirdos buying god knows what.
One night I stood behind the register, watching a staggering homeless man dig through the alcohol shelf. I glanced outside. The streets were dark and empty, lit only by the flickering streetlights. And then I saw him.
The man in the rabbit mask. Still wearing his filthy, muddy tuxedo, he stood there on the other side of the glass, waving at me—beckoning me to come. I broke out in a cold sweat. I panicked. I wanted to run. I looked around, searching for a way out...
But the figure outside was gone. Did I imagine it? Then my phone buzzed again. Another open shift. I looked around the store. The homeless guy was still shuffling through the vodka, and everything else was still, bright, and dull.
As much as I was terrified… deep down, I felt it. Something in me longed to go back. Not just for the money. The place was calling me.
Maybe should I go back?
