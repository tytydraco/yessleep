I didn’t want to believe it was back.

It had been years since I’d last seen it—or thought I’d seen it. When I was younger, I used to think I could feel something following me. A presence. It wasn’t always there, but when it was, it felt... wrong. Like being watched, but not just by eyes—by something deeper. I thought it was a phase. Stress. A bad time in my life that would eventually go away. And for a while, it did.

Until recently.

It started slowly, like it always does. I’d be doing something completely normal—working, grabbing lunch, playing a game on my phone—and I’d get this flash of unease, like I was being pulled out of the moment. The room would feel different, smaller, the air heavier. At first, I brushed it off. Everyone gets stressed, right? Everyone has those days when their brain won’t stop running in circles.

But then I started seeing it again.

I was in the grocery store a few weeks ago, picking up snacks for a movie night. I reached for a bag of chips, and just as I turned to toss it in my cart, I saw it in the corner of my eye. A shape. Not a person, not anything solid—more like a shadow, but not one that belonged to me or anyone around me. It hovered there for a second, just long enough to make my heart skip, and then it was gone.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the spot where it had been, telling myself I was just tired. Stressed. I didn’t need this again. Not now.

But once it shows up, it doesn’t stop. It feeds on stress, anxiety, whatever cracks I’ve got, it digs into them. The more I try to ignore it, the more it shows itself. In mirrors, behind me in reflections, always in the corner of my eye. It never fully materializes, like it’s waiting for me to break first. I’ve caught myself double-checking rooms before walking in, making sure there are no weird shadows. Every night I make sure all the doors and windows are locked, even though I know none of that will keep it out.

Last week, I tried to talk to a friend about it, without really telling them everything. I didn’t want them to think I’d lost it. They just said I needed to relax, take a day off. But I know that’s exactly what it wants—me, relaxing, letting my guard down.

Then last night, it got worse.

I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, when I felt it. That thick, suffocating air. It was in the room with me. I could feel it, standing just beyond the foot of my bed. I didn’t dare move. My breath felt stuck in my chest, like if I breathed too loud, it would know I was awake. I could hear something—this low, almost imperceptible hum, like a distant radio signal. It felt like hours before it finally faded, and I was able to move again.

I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know why it came back after all this time. But I do know this: the more I try to ignore it, the stronger it gets. I can’t talk to anyone about it without sounding crazy. I can’t let it know I’m afraid.

But I can feel it, right now, watching me. It’s closer than ever.
