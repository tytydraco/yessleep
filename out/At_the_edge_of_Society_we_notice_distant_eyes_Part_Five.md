I’m not stupid.

Everyone knows the strangers are dangerous on the Outside. Everyone knows that. But before I’d actually gone Outside, before I’d started… Seeing them live under their own rules, not human ones, it didn’t really click. Hell. I’d seen neighbors disappear after unfits got in, or be hurt by them in plenty of more concrete ways.

But I’d also seen the unfits hurt their own kind. And inside the walls, someone would always take care of the monsters when they showed their fangs. And it wasn’t always humans doing it. The monsters wanted to live their lives in peace, too.

My father went away because, no matter how long he lived among ‘normal people’, there was always someone who’d look at him sideways. For every smile sent his way there was a hushed whisper behind his back. When my mother died, it only got worse. Last words he ever spoke to me, he asked me to come with him on a trip to the Outside. He kind of made it sound like a business trip.

I remember how, every day, he used that mug. Some dads collect those Father of the Year mementos and assign them a great deal of importance only until the relevant celebration passes, then quietly put them squarely into practicality instead of sentimentality, subconsciously or otherwise. My dad displayed and used them as religiously as if they were gifts from an angel.

I didn’t go with him, so I didn’t see what happened to him. Maybe he got all the way to the end, and he just didn’t want to come back. Maybe it’s wonderful at the far end of the road. But what I saw yesterday, that guy just. *Disappearing*. I don’t really have much confidence in that particular wishful thought anymore.

That’s not why I’m writing this now, though. Well. Not the only reason. I want to leave something behind if I don’t come home some day, and there’s other things I’m worried about. Other people. I couldn’t help but picture everyone I knew vanishing into thin air like that. The Moss Man, with his advice and his weird antics. Tommy, with his gushing and his careful eye. Lupe, even when she’s quiet or snappy.

I know there’s awful shit out there, but the people in *here*, living next door, sharing my work space, they aren’t. At least, not near bad enough for me to wish them away like that. Like they’d never existed.

I decided, the day after, I hadn’t paid enough attention to my coworkers. I watched the alert board, real carefully. I didn’t look at Lupe or Tommy while I talked to them at first. I just did the daily routine while I chatted away. I think my hand was shaking, since I eventually spilled a bit of hot coffee on myself and cursed.

“You okay?” Tommy asked. He’d been saying something about that television series he’d mentioned before. Improper Crimes. It was how I found out that, apparently, that ‘murder investigator’ from the other day was now co-starring in it.

“I… Yeah, yeah. I’m good, Tom.” I wiped it up when Lupe handed me a towel. Extra strength, for when she shifted and blood got places. “Just a bit… On edge.”

“Because of what happened?” Tommy was taking notes on something. I was noticing a couple small things now that he did. When something on the monitors went into a building, or started doing anything that seemed too personal, he immediately stopped taking notes. Sometimes, they looked up at him while he was watching. Others didn’t.

“What… What is he, Tom?”

“You mean the… Author.” Tom’s clipped, cheerful tone dropped away again. “He’s been around a while. I think there’s people out there who used to be normal. Who had jobs, just like us. The running theory is that, when everything changed, so did they. But they still do their jobs.”

“So he keeps writing.”

“So he keeps writing. And he still wants inspiration.” He paused. His pen went still. “He’s never been that bold before. I don’t know how he did what he did. He watches, usually. And writes.”

“And lets everyone else take the fall for him. So he can get intrusive.”

“Exactly. Or he worms his way into your private life the usual ways.”

“You think he knows something we don’t?”

“He has to. He’s not supposed to be able to just… Do that. Not without reaping what he sows. And he still has to actually write.”

“Is he human? Or…”

“I don’t know. Maybe he used to be. But maybe now he’s not. If he is, could be why he doesn’t use the paths. Could be…” Tommy trailed off. I saw his whole body starting to wind up. He resumed his pen scratching, but it was strained. Slow, careful, like he was afraid he’d write down the wrong thing and something bad would happen.

“Do you think he can be… You know. Stopped. Forcefully.”

Tommy looked at me, and so did Lupe. Lupe especially was digging into me with her gaze. “You’re not serious.” She said.

“I don’t know.”

“I think someone would’ve done it already if he could be. *They* should’ve been able to do it. I don’t know why they…” Tommy tapped his pen against his chin. Then started writing again.

“You aren’t meant to know everything about someone. You aren’t meant to be able to hold them in your hand.” Lupe watched the board at her desk. Started doodling something.

“In your… Hand.” I raised a brow at that, then let it sink in. “I wonder if he has… An assistant, maybe. Or something. I’ve seen, heard about, people doing some pretty crazy stuff out-”

“We aren’t meant to know everything. Just deal with it when it shows up.” Tommy piped up. He looked right at me, frowned, then turned back to the monitor. It started to click that I was freaking him out.

“Sorry.”

“It’s fine.”

Silence took the reins for a bit, then something popped into my head. “Wait. Okay, I know we were about to drop it, but I’ve gotta ask something. The… Book. What do you, like, do with them?”

“Burn them. Way too much sensitive information inside.” Tommy answered.

“Noted.”

I passed a few people through the gate after that. It was a lot harder, all of a sudden, to do the checks. To say the phrase. Nothing was certain anymore. I kept thinking that, maybe, the next person I’d let in wouldn’t be someone who was meant to go in. That, maybe, they’d go inside Society, find all my secrets, and put me together on a note board somewhere. Then I’d be gone. My next solo was coming up soon, too, and I was dreading it.

I went through the pamphlets I’d been given when I’d started. I’d paid attention, taken my notes. But a lot of it suddenly seemed a hell of a lot more menacing. Used to just be a list. Do’s and don'ts. Now it seemed more like a guidebook for potential horrific fates, just without the details about how exactly you’d be broken.

I found where the Author was mentioned. More or less described him as a serial killer, who tries to cook up elaborate scenarios he can tip the dominos on. There were others, too. Little categories. I wonder if they’d change if I went over to the next section of the wall, all the little classifications, the finer details. I guessed that these were the ones that were most likely to show up at my door, particularly, or that were everywhere.

I made a mental note on each. The friendlies, the unfits, the in-betweens. The general ones and the specifics. After I did my diligence, I asked my coworkers if they wanted to meet somewhere after work, gave a time, place, date. Tommy told me sure, but work stuff would be kept off the conversation table. Lupe just looked surprised. I almost thought she’d say no. But she hummed to herself after. I think I caught her smiling, though the smile was slightly awkward.

I left work that day feeling odd. I’d been slacking, sure. Almost paid the price for it last month. But when I went through the pamphlets, when I read those logs, too. Something felt off. I know very well I’m at the bottom of the food chain as far as authority goes. I’m a glorified desk clerk. I think the reason they took me in was because I’d worked basic security before. Reception, campus security.

There’s gaps in my knowledge that don’t make sense. My awareness. Did something from the Outside mess with my head, and I’m only now realizing? Am I a lucky dumbass, just too fresh out of water? I can’t quite remember some of the things that have passed through the gate anymore. There’s something about the past, the place I live, the job. All of it. Little blurry edges, like on the documents.

If I think particularly hard about it. If I focus. I remember that we have a science branch. And I realize that there’s a whole slice of this section of the wall, a select few people, that are nothing more than fuzzy static to me. Have you ever heard of white room syndrome? It feels like that.

**5/21/20xx**

It was solo shift today. I’ll be honest, that peace and quiet feeling has gone away. Used to be, for those first four months, I’d just sit here. Read. Glance up at the monitors, run my eyes over the board. Smile and tip my mug at people. I still try to do that. But it’s a lot, lot harder to relax.

Which isn’t great, me being so tense, since the entire reason these exist is so that the shy ones can come out. That, and so the Outside feels less like it's being watched. I think it gets antsy, somehow. Too many eyes on the back of your head, you might lash out eventually.

The get together went well. I learned that Lupe wants to be some kind of creative. But that she doesn’t know what kind. I learned that Tommy planned to go to some sort of. In-person meet thing that would pop up in town soon. With the runners of that one show. It was good to see both of them being warm. I’ll be honest, I don’t think I ever realized how distant I was with people. I’ve always had friends. Coworkers, at all my jobs, who I felt I knew well.

But I always had some kind of barrier. In the places I needed to have them the least.

I spoke to my neighbors, too. Part of it was paranoia. Making sure everyone seemed to be who I thought they were. I pried a bit. But in here, in Society, that doesn’t mean much. Not unless I take the wrong information Outside. Even then, strangers could forget, too. And not everything was interesting. But there are places they want to go, personal places, and they always love true names. I hear that, in other parts of Society, when they name you at birth they lock the sacred phrase away in some government info vault.

There’s a few things I want to test, now. But the consequences of testing them, I think, aren’t ones I want to try my luck with.

Something weird happened today. I passed around twelve or so people. Mostly quiet sorts, who struggled to do the checks with me but I gathered were more worried about what they’d see on my side than what I’d see coming from theirs. I remember one in particular, who said something that helped me settle down just enough to get through the rest of the queue.

“Over the wall. When someone… Goes away. You notice, yes?”

It was an odd question, I furrowed my brow a bit. Then I remembered. “We have… People whose entire job is just finding people.” They made a face, so I clarified. “And bringing them back.”

After the incident with that guy who tried to bash his head in right in front of me, I was pretty anxious. Tapping my fingers against the board, constantly flicking my eyes over all the controls. Wondering when I’d see something I couldn’t deal with on the monitor, sweating when the thought crossed my mind I was neglecting some part of my space: a camera unwatched, a light unnoticed, a shadow on the horizon.

I went through the check with what I thought would be the last one. I felt the world relax around me, almost, as I heard distant noises and saw a few people here and there on the monitors get ready to turn in for the night or switch shifts. Go home. The lights of distant Communities dimmed or got brighter, and the last drop-offs and pickups were made at the Posts.

I looked out across the field at the forest, at the dark trees, looking to see if there were any stragglers. I was seeing things half the day, hearing sounds that weren’t there, and I don’t think anyone was messing with me but myself. I was eager to go home, think over some things. Plan. But when the… The woman in the medical gown walked up to the treeline, stared at me without saying a thing, I was pretty sure it was real.

There was something off about her face. She was too tall. Some sort of aura lingered around her, reaching out towards me all the way from across the field despite its recent growth. It was somehow cold and sterile, but pungent and stale. Like someone had died and been left to rot, and the mortician called it good doing only half the embalming.

I had this thought. Wondered if it was a cousin, or sister, or whatever of that lady with the watch. I half expected her to explode into dust, then be washed away in the rain.

She hesitated, maybe. If I stared at her long enough, gauged her posture, she seemed like she was ready to run instead of pounce. Her chest rose and fell slowly, her hand dug claws into the nearest tree.

I look at the board. It’s around now that I notice there’s no lights or alerts popping up. The comms people on rotation don’t say a word. The guards don’t usually slack, not even this close to shift end, but when I look at the wallside-facing feeds I don’t see them react, really. When I look back out the window, I still see them. And I see the monitor that corresponds to the exact spot she’s standing in is now taken up fully by her face.

Her face is like if you took a person’s face, a dog’s, mashed them together then ran it over. Somehow, though, she was still pretty. I don’t know how to describe it. You ever see someone with scars, maybe some nasty ones, but it kind of just makes them feel. Refined? Strong? It reminded me of Lupe, weirdly. It kind of set me off, since it doesn’t exactly put me in the headspace for *relaxing* when someone feels pleasant and familiar, and you don’t know why. Especially not if they feel like someone you already trust.

She tried to speak. I saw her mouth move, and all I heard was the crackling of old vocal cords. I sat there, waited, tension growing in my back and limbs as she worked out her voice. “...Change.”

I didn’t respond. I debated if I should alert security. Tried to assess my surroundings.

“...Better. Now? Time… Long… Not… Not… Not often…”

I click the button that’s supposed to call security, not feeling like taking much risk. Worst case, they’d stand by to intervene while I figured this last incoming stranger out. The button didn’t do anything. I clicked it two more times to make sure. But it didn’t do anything.

The dog-faced woman standing in the trees starts to fade away back into the shadows, but her face doesn’t leave the monitor. When I look out at the window, I notice she must’ve taken a few tentative steps out into the field. Like testing the water before getting in. There was a little bit of dead grass, a couple wilted flowers, at the edge where the field meets the woods.

“...Pital. Hos. Hospital?” It sounds like she’s trying to ask me a question.

“I don’t… Do you need medical help?” My voice gets low and hushed. I look around me. It feels like there’s eyes on my back.

“...Yes. Yesss. Direct. Direct me.”

“...Okay.” I don’t know how she’s hearing me still, walking off like she is. I pull up one of the pamphlets. I’ve got a directional guide, partially for myself - you never know when you’re going to cross a road and skip a dozen or two more miles than you’re supposed to - partially for when I need to tell someone where to go. I’m not a communications officer or aide, but I’m a small voice in the chorus that they poke for a line sometimes.

“Angelvale. Okay, so…” And I give her directions. I notice the alerts that’re supposed to follow her don’t. After a few minutes, she seems to be finding her way alright. She looks up at me from the monitors.

“I walk. The rest. Alone.” She wasn’t emphasizing, but struggling to get the words out. Then she starts walking.

It didn’t click until my arm started hurting that she was trying to tell me to stop watching her. I don’t know if it was prying now, that I’d done a rule break. I wasn’t Outside, so it shouldn’t count anyway. But I follow her as she flickers across a few monitors.

Past the sleeve of my blue and yellow shirt - I’d returned to formal wear recently, I was hoping donning the colors the strangers like would make them less likely to screw with me - I noticed my wrist skin flaking away a bit. As I flicker my eyes between her and my hand, there’s a little bit of putrid black-green crawling out of the flaking spot. It doesn’t feel pleasant.

I stop looking. After a bit, the rot recedes like it’d never been, and I’m fine. I don’t call security and make a report. Instead, I picture myself withering away into dust and black bone, and the mental image of a whole team of black-and-green suits reduced to a putrid puddle in their own armor keeps my finger away from the pen and the board.

**5/23/20xx**

Mandatory team companionship encouragement rotation came up for us today. If someone is reading this - I don’t know, maybe you pried it out of my drawer at home after I vanished making a misstep - that’s just code for bullshit non-negotiable participation in corporate style bonding activities. At least they were paid. It was, so far, the most pleasant forced overtime I’d ever worked. Sometimes, they were just straight up done on-shift if enough people’s schedules aligned right.

Lupe and Tommy were there. So was Ron. Ron was wearing this crisp black suit, though I think he wears those things more for the absurdity of seeing his barely formal ass suited up. I actually saw a few of his mysterious aides there. Technically my security booth was supposed to have one. I wasn’t the only inspection-pass-go worker along this section of the wall. We were supposed to get a replacement aide soon for our checkpoint, since ours had just kind of gotten up and left one day my second month in.

I’d watched one of Ron’s aides for a bit. Was a woman who had little feathers around her eyes. I’d brought that group photo with me, the one that’s supposed to show my coworkers. I was still the only one in it, face and proportions all broken, and I tried to picture where she should be standing. I didn’t ask to see the original, though I had access. I was afraid I wouldn’t recognize most of the people in it, or not everyone would be in that one, either.

The people who were fuzzy in my head were around, at least a handful. Everyone present was someone who’s shifts aligned. Was a whole schedule for the mandatory co-activites. Not much happened. I mostly just chatted with the people I were familiar with, or who approached me. Tommy had explained a few of the odder people’s ‘stranger tics’ to me, and Lupe had actually been fairly interactive. 

She talked with almost everyone, and she’d asked me if humans still held balls anywhere in Society. I told her that in the Old E - for other parts of Society, we tend to just use nickname titles to be specific - they’ve been doing court stuff again for a while now. Not sure why, but she seemed to tense up at the idea, even though she sounded almost… Wistful, during that part of the conservation.

I didn’t say anything to Ron. I’d brought my #1 Border Watcher mug here, too. I sipped fruit juice from it, in his general direction, and I think I might’ve drank a bit by then and was possibly trying to make a statement. I watched the king in his court, tailed by his subjects. The party ended with me definitely having drank enough to help Tommy do a dramatic, impromptu investigation into someone’s missing personal items - we asked, of course, first if we could look - in which I eventually realizing he was calling me by a name that sounded a lot like a sidekick’s. He was wearing some kind of investigator type hat and everything. I think he had a fan shirt, too.

On shift, later - yeah, you still have to go to work after/before if your workload lines up too - I was feeling chummier than usual. More actually relaxed. It was more towards night, sun was setting. We passed a few early people, one of them apparently very eager to get through the gate before the sun went all the way down. Denied a handful. I think they can tell if you’re relaxing sometimes, the ones you don’t want in. Nothing insane happened, but it put me more towards back on edge by the last one.

Someone who’d passed had put a radio in the deposit. Like, an actual one, a bit on the older side. The sort you’d carry around. It was a bit perplexing, but the one who’d given it had passed, and there wasn’t anything weird about it. I tuned it a bit, curious, though I let Tommy watch me. I didn’t ask him about it, but I noticed it felt like he was looking at me with two eyes instead of the one good one sometimes, even though he visibly lacked the other. I think he can see things I can’t. Like Lupe. I don’t know if it’s an observer thing or what, though.

The radio picked up Society-side channels. I think a few Outside-side ones, too. I kept my finger on the off button at all times in case something I’m not supposed to hear comes up.

I finish messing with it, but it’s not done. Near the tail end of the shift, while I watch Lupe run through two pizza boxes and start on the last one - party leftovers - and wonder if she can get sick, I see that dog-faced woman again. I look at my two coworkers, and they look at me before following my eyes to her.

“You guys see that, right?” I ask. I don’t point. And I don’t look at the woman for long.

I notice both of them look away, though Tommy’s gaze lingers a lot shorter than Lupe’s. Lupe stares at her for maybe a full minute, just watches her. “She is not supposed to be out. Don’t look. Don’t touch. Not even through a barrier.” She looks over her desk buttons. Flexes her fake human fingers. I think she’s debating what to do.

“Angelvale. Nice.” The woman’s face is on the monitor again. I check the side cams. The guards still can’t see her. Ron is off right now. The aide doesn’t come till tomorrow. I check the pamphlets, but nothing relevant is in there.

“Angelvale…” Tommy’s watching the place the woman is standing, but not her. “...How is she doing that? She shouldn’t be… Where is…” He’s muttering to himself, like he’s putting together clues.

The radio crackles to life again. It plays a snippet from three songs. *Life on the Inside*, *God’s hand in the rain*, *All that the Eye can’t see*. The first one is a personal favorite of mine. I think I see Lupe tense up for a second, pause and go rigid. Tommy doesn’t react aside from looking at the radio.

“Don’t answer it. Only technical experts are supposed to on this side.” Tommy’s tone was to-the-point. He looked at Lupe. “Do you think you can handle-”

“No. She’ll outpace me. Call-”

“Congratulations! Tonight, you’re our lucky caller!” A crackled, staticky voice came out of the radio, like if you gave radio waves a particular kind of coherence. “Now, same rules as always. If you can’t answer a few questions correctly, we’ll give you a helping hand if you need one, a special prize if you don’t.”

I almost say something, but just purse my lips instead. I hear Lupe get up. Hear her footsteps trail away. She doesn’t go through the door, though, out into the field.

“Where’s she headed? Doesn’t she need to be-”

“We need someone particular for this. It’ll be fine, just ignore her.” Tommy flicks his eyes towards the woman with the dogface, briefly, to show me who he’s talking about before he watches the radio instead. I run through a pamphlet, find a designated entity under the Professionals section, called the Station. Not sure if you’ll be able to read some of this. Tommy gave me some of that… Blur-ink, and told me to censor if I was journaling, just in case.

“Question one: why do the wolves chase the giant?” The radio asked.

The woman outside answered. I looked at her, just a second, saw her dig claws into the tree. That little aura of decay grew a little bigger, cast a longer shadow. “When the wolves pass, they do not want to have the souls of their shepherd’s flock stolen.”

Tommy freezes up. He was taking a few notes. The tip of his pen was a different color now. I think I heard him click it. “That’s one down.” The radio continued. “Question two. Why does the lord’s child see what he is not meant to?” Tommy pauses again, then scratches a little faster. I think I see his brow sweat before he wipes it away.

The woman starts walking forward. Her face is off the monitor. As she gets closer, and the field withers around her feet, I don’t look at her. But I hear distant wheezing. It sounds like she’s in pain. “He traded with someone. So that he could look where he was not meant to.”

“Tommy? What do we-”

“You’re on a roll! Okay, question three: do you think he knows whose skin he’s really wearing?”

“He doesn’t. He doesn’t know where he belongs.” She’s crossed halfway to, now. I think I hear an engine roar to life, somewhere to my left. The guards at the gate, when I check the side feed, are gone.

“That’s all. We have a winner! Though, you up for a bonus round?”

“Always.” She crosses all the way over. I don’t know if she’s walking slow or fast, but she’s got a long stride. She puts her hand on the window. I can’t help it. I look up, look her right in the eye. I see her long, clawed fingers, made for tearing. Her strange face. Her mouth opens, and I see her coarse tongue and her misshapen teeth, half predator, half prey.

I make eye contact. I freeze, then the sting on my hand, the moment it starts, pulls my eyes back. I saw the glass starting to take on a strange color. Saw sand drip down the window in rivulets.

“Why do we live in a world, where we aren’t allowed to love?” The radio’s tone is different. Any trace of confidence is burned out and filled with flatness.

“I don’t. Know.” The woman’s voice croaks. “It. Hurts.”

The radio doesn’t ding or sound any bells, or pop any streamers. Someone’s voice comes over the comm, telling me and Tommy to vacate the premises. Something compels me, for a moment, to reach up and put my hand where the woman’s is. I don’t know if it’s me, or something else making me do it. I think, maybe, it’s a bit of both.

Tommy pulls me away when my fingers start to bleed from the nail. The last thing I hear is the radio as I force my legs to carry me out of the room. “They’re out there. They still love you. And they’re waiting.” It sounds defeated. And I don’t know who he’s talking to. I pass Lupe, who came to meet us, and I see her stop and listen to it for a moment before making a strangled noise.

**5/25/20xx - 5/26/20xx - A**

I’m writing this bit before shift. I’d been afraid something would happen that I wouldn’t want to if I kept writing things down. Tommy had told me that I may need to submit my journal to inspection if my stress levels end up hitting a ceiling. I’d told him I’d burned it.

And I had. But it came back. Someone had left a box of paper slips and clips in the deposit during my solo. I didn’t mention it until now since I didn’t think it meant anything. I’ve got one in my hand, right now. If I turn it over, I see a rabbit on the back sitting on the moon. It’s thick as an envelope, with a square of parchment on the inside.

I’m going to leave this for when I come back. I’ve got a hunch, and there’s something I want to test. If someone’s reading this, send me a sign.

Who are you? You’re not fit, are you? Or maybe, you’re a friend. Just one who doesn’t respect personal space.
