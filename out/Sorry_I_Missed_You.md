I worked as a staff member at a children's daycare many years ago. One early morning before my shift began, my co-worker Matt came up to me. He handed me a small white envelope with my name on it.

"Reception told me to give you this, someone left it there last night," he said. I opened the envelope, and pulled out a note from inside.

*'Sorry I missed you! - R.'*

I raised an eyebrow, trying to think of anyone I knew whose name started with an 'R'. After pondering for a few minutes, I shrugged it off and tossed the papers in the trash.

Three days later, Matt delivered me another envelope with my name on it from reception early in the morning.

"Your boyfriend sending you these?" He teased.

"I don't have a boyfriend," I replied.

"Then who was the tall, dark, handsome fella looking for you yesterday?" He asked.

I opened it to find another note.

*'Sorry I missed you again! - Ralph.'*

I had no idea who Ralph was.

"You saw who handed this into reception?" I asked Matt.

"Yeah, a guy tried to hand this into reception last night at about eight. You went home earlier than usual, so I was the only one there. But I saw him, and I told him I'd keep it for you."

"Weird," I said, "no idea who Ralph is. Never known any Ralphs. What did he look like?"

"Tall guy, black hair, looked in his mid-thirties. His left eye looked a bit messed up. Otherwise pretty good looking guy, objectively. Was wearing a black leather jacket and a white shirt. Dark blue jeans, I think." I continued to look sceptical. "Doesn't ring a bell?"

I shook my head.

"Okay," he chuckled, and shrugged, then walked away. It sounded like he didn't believe me.

The next Monday, Matt handed me an envelope once again.

"This secret admirer of yours is persistent," he winked.

I opened the envelope.

*'Looks like I missed you again! - Ralph."* This time, a telephone number was written on the back of the note.

That night, I fiddled with the slip of paper as I sat alone in my living room. When the envelope came the first time, I dismissed it and went about my life. But this being the third time, I couldn't stop thinking about it the entire day. I finally entered the number into my mobile, took a deep breath, then tapped on the green call button.

"Hello?" said a man's voice.

"Is this Ralph?" I asked.

"Speaking, and who is this?" He replied.

"Hey, this is Tara," I said, "I got a few notes at my job from you, were you looking for me?" He paused.

"Oh yeah," he said, as if he had remembered something, "I wanted to talk to you. You see, my sister's moving here soon and she's in need of a daycare center that's open 'til late for my niece. I had a chat to reception and they said you're amazing with kids."

"They said that?" I asked.

"Yes, in fact the lady at reception said your manner with kids was the best out of all the staff," he praised.

"Well, I don't think that's true," I said, bashfully proud.

"I'm sure you're being humble," he affirmed, "anyway, are there any spaces left for my niece to join?"

"I'll have to ask reception, we're in high demand this year," I paused, "actually, don't you worry. I'll make it a point, I'm sure we'll be able to squeeze her in."

"Really appreciate you going out of your way to help, even out of working hours," he said, sounding relieved.

"That's alright."

"Would it be possible for me to come and have a look at the daycare?" he asked, "maybe you could give me a tour. I'm sure my niece will be in good hands with you. I just want to see the environment first."

"Of course," I agreed without hesitation, "when is best for you?"

"I don't want to take too much of your time, so I'll come when you're about to get off work."

"I usually stay pretty late, but how about next Thursday? I've got to leave early at four-ish in the afternoon, so you can come at around half three."

"Sure thing, see you then."

The call left me with a pretty good impression of Ralph at the time. He sounded like a friendly guy who was just concerned about his niece's best interests.

The following Thursday, Ralph showed up at the daycare. He was a tall, serious looking man with black hair and a faint but noticeable scar running from his left eyebrow to his cheek. But the roughness faded when he smiled. My heart started racing as soon as I saw him, like a dumb schoolgirl with a crush. He greeted me at the reception, and I took him around the place, introducing him to Matt, our new co-worker Nisha who had just started a week ago, and a few other people. He poked around in a few of the rooms for a while, and I thought he was just being thorough.

"Looks great, she'll love it here," he said, as the tour came to a close. "Thanks so much."

"You're welcome," I beamed, as we walked outside to leave, and made it to the bus stop.

"You seem really familiar with the place, you must've worked there for a while," he presumed. We boarded and sat next to each other.

"Oh yes, it's been five years. Everyone's been lovely."

"But a smart, eloquent girl like you would make a lot more elsewhere. You'd be perfect in sales - I'd buy anything from you."

I blushed.

"That's very kind of you to say, but I love my job. I see myself staying here for as long as they let me."

He raised his eyebrows and nodded.

"You must have kids of your own, seeing how good you are with them," he stated. My stop was approaching, and I stood up, while he remained seated.

"Ah, no. Not yet anyway."

"Good," he said.

I laughed, thinking he was joking.

"Yeah, they seem like a lot of work. I'd want to be a good mother. I didn't have the best upbringing, my parents abused drugs," I admitted.

"I know," he said. His smile faded, and his expression went blank. I paused.

"You do?"

"Yeah. I know a lot more about you than you think. By the way, I don't have a niece."

I was caught off guard and stared at him, trying to process what he just said. The bus slowed to a halt, and the doors opened.

"It's your stop, isn't it?" He stared back at me. "Off you go then."

My mind was paralyzed, but my legs carried me off the bus on autopilot. Our eyes locked, all the way until I could see him looking at me through the glass window. His mouth stretched slowly into a menacing grin. I continued walking for a few yards on autopilot, numb and confused. All I could think about was getting home as fast as possible. It was only when I entered my house and locked my door that my heart started to race.

I picked up the phone and called Jean who worked in reception.

"Hey Jean, this is Tara, you know Ralph?"

"The tall man who came in today?" She asked.

"Yeah, him. Did you ever tell him about me?"

"No, why would I do that?" she asked.

"So you've never mentioned my name to him? Or like, talked about me to him?" My palms started to sweat.

"No, I've never even spoken to him until today, when you introduced him," she said.

"O-okay."

I hung up and sat in silence on my living room couch, contemplating. Fear gripped me as the realization of how easily I had been manipulated dawned. I had no idea what this man's intentions were, but he was stalking me.

And I let him, without realizing it.

I had been careless from the moment I decided to call the number on that slip of paper. Curiosity had gotten the better of me, and this man had effortlessly gotten my personal phone number.

*"I don't want to take too much of your time, so I'll come when you're about to get off work."*

That was intentional. I never told anyone my address - none of my friends or coworkers knew where I lived. I let my guard down, and didn't even question the fact that he'd gotten on the same bus as me, and watched me walk to my house just a few yards away in a daze. Now he knew where I lived.

*"I see myself staying here for as long as they let me."*

And on top of that, I had revealed that I wasn't planning to leave anytime soon.

My phone rang, startling me out of my paralysis. It was Matt.

"Hey," I picked up.

"Hey, everything alright?" He asked, sounding concerned.

"Yeah, why?" I lied, trying to keep my voice steady.

"Okay good. Just wanted to check."

"No, but why?"

"Forget it, it's all good," he dodged.

"Check what?" I insisted, raising my voice.

"Okay calm down, it's just 'cause I saw you go off with that Ralph dude. I mean, I know we met him today, but I saw him lurking around outside the daycare for the past week. At first I thought he was your boyfriend or something, but you said you didn't know him. I mean, I thought something felt off, but if you're fine then it's all good."

I was about to correct him when I received a text.

*'I am monitoring your phone. I can see and hear everything you do on it.'*

It was from Ralph. I started to shake. It was dark outside now, and heavy rain scattered but I could see the glow of headlights of a black car pulling up slowly on the opposite road outside my house. I spotted Ralph's silhouette through the window as I quickly closed the curtains, light from the headlights still seeping through.

*Ding!* Another message.

*'I am watching you.'*

"Um, Matt," I said quietly, my voice quivering, "I've got to go." I hung up.

Another text.

*'You can't hide forever.'*

I started typing *'what do you want?'*, and I received a reply before I hit send.

*'You don't deserve to live,'* came the reply.

Tears streamed from my eyes, and trying to stifle my cries. I tried to stand quietly, but kept collapsing, as my legs wouldn't take my weight. I had never been so afraid in my life. I had no idea what he had against me, or why he had suddenly turned threatening out of nowhere and even showed up at my property, but I didn't want to find out. I finally gathered my strength and barricaded my front door with furniture, turned all the lights off, took a large kitchen knife and curled up behind my couch, expecting the sound of a break in any second. Perhaps I could have escaped through the back door, but I had the feeling he was watching my every move and would somehow catch me if I tried that. It suddenly occurred to me that my selfie camera light was on. I tried to cover the lens with my thumb. I contemplated calling the cops, but as he was right outside, I figured he'd reach me a lot faster than they would. As soon as my finger reached for the '9', he'd be on my doorstep. I really just froze. Knowing that I was being watched rendered me almost non-functional.

At some point, I could the car engine and lights outside my living room switched off, and now he was waiting in silence. There were no texts for hours.

Until 4am. My phone rang, and it was Ralph. The ringtone startled me, and I declined the call.

*Ding!*

*'Tara, there's been a misunderstanding.'*

*Ding!*

*'Tara, pick up, this is important.'*

Two texts. I hesitated for a few minutes.

*'Are you still watching my screen?'* I typed. I didn't tap send. Sure enough, a reply came.

*'I guess. Just pick up. I can explain.'*

*'I'm not opening the door,'* I typed.

*'Fine, no need,'* he replied.

*'Ok.'*

Ralph called again and I picked up this time, my heart beating out of my chest.

"Hey, I know you're probably shitting yourself right now," he began, his voice strained but sincere. "And this is really awkward."

I said nothing. I wasn't buying it yet. I was still convinced he was trying to get me to go outside so he could murder me.

"Basically," he continued, "we've been looking for a kid diddler in this area. Nisha's working with me as well. We pretend to be 13 year olds and talk to people on forums, and some of them end up sending us some pretty incriminating stuff. Then we confront them and send it all to the police. They're not huge fans of us, but it works. Anyway, we knew someone in this region was sending really disturbing things to kids on an app, from the EXIF data in images. They deleted all the messages and the app every time, but we've got some tech guys who are pretty good at finding this stuff. All the evidence pointed to you. Nisha infiltrated the center and installed a remote access app, and we monitored all the activity on your phone for a few days."

"What?" I interjected, still afraid but more outraged. "I've never done anything like that! So you guys bugged my phone? I make a living trying to keep children safe!"

"Listen," said Ralph, "it was my bad. I was certain you were guilty, but Nisha pointed out that it was weird the texts to minors were only sent during hours when you were at work. Over the past few days, she analyzed the pattern of the texts and noticed some of them were sent when you clearly weren't on your phone."

I paused.

"So that means someone at the daycare center has been using your phone to arrange meetups with young kids."

My heart started racing again, but this time, the horror sunk in a lot deeper than before. A chill ran through me.

"I don't think predators deserve to live, frankly, but I shouldn't have lost control at you like that. There might be some useful data on your phone, and the police should be coming over shortly. It would be really helpful if you could hand it over so they can take a look. I know it's not fair on you, but-"

"Who was it then?" I asked. There was a pause on the other line.

"I'll tell you after you hand over the phone."

"Can't you see what's on it anyway?"

"Yeah, but as I said, they'll want to take a look. There might be stuff we can't remote access."

"I'm not going outside until the police come."

"Fine by me," sighed Ralph, exasperated.

The police came an hour later and I came out to hand over my phone, after moving all the furniture out of my hallway. Nisha had arrived at the scene and was yelling at Ralph, having witnessed our text exchange while she monitored my phone. Ralph tried his best to avoid eye contact with me.

Matt was arrested the next day.

Nisha had caught him taking my phone out of my purse in the staff locker room, then downloading an instant messaging app and logging into an account to message multiple kids. He posed as an older woman using my photos, acting like a sort of motherly figure, and planned to meet them behind the daycare center to 'play some games', but you can probably guess what he meant by that. The cops definitely were from the context of his messages. He got 20 years in prison, not nearly enough in my opinion, but at least he's still rotting in there today.

Unlike now, most people didn't have smartphones back then. I didn't keep it on me as it was expensive and I was afraid to lose it, and it wasn't tradition to lock your phone with a password either. However it was tradition to lock your locker, so I'll take the blame for that.

I bumped into Ralph again last week, first time since that situation years ago. I found out he'd sent me a long apology text, but I never saw it as I quickly got rid of the bugged phone after the incident.

"If Nisha weren't there, would you have killed me?"

"Nah, I was just fucking with you and making sure you didn't try to run away before the cops arrived. That being said, if you did try to run, then I may not have been able to control myself."

"Why'd you just switch up like that on the bus?"

"Well, I wanted access to the place, and I also had to try and get some details without spooking you out. We thought the suspect was called Tara and from that general area, but we weren't completely sure if a 'Tara' worked at the daycare. Didn't want to get reception suspicious by asking too many questions, so I dropped a few letters. The fact that they got picked up, then you even called back, confirmed that much. Got a number which was linked to your socials, found out about your family and upbringing from that, your daily routine, even got an address out of you while Nisha got the evidence. I dropped the act once I knew where you lived. I thought you were a diddler at the time, so trust me, it was really hard to be nice to you, even for a while."

My jaw dropped.

"I felt like I was in The Shining, or something. That was actually traumatizing," I finally said.

He briefly repeated the apology, and explained that he had been abused by his teacher as a child who he thought he could trust. He blamed himself for a long time, and that made him hate predators with a passion.

"Well hey," I said, "I thought I could trust Matt, I thought he was a good guy too. We were close - I worked with him for years, and never suspected he could do such a thing until I found out," I said, "difference is, I was a grown adult. Even I was duped. And he was working around kids daily! How can these evil monsters just hide in plain sight? I have trust issues to this day because of it."

"Yeah," he said, "but to be honest, you're not that hard to [dupe](https://www.reddit.com/user/latebutstillearly1/)."
