DARKNESS is not only the abbsence of light. DARKNESS is alive. You can feel it watchin you every time. 

You can feel it draining you of energy every day when light leaves. 

Do you think you are sleepy just because you have not slept? Do you think dreams are created by your brain? Do you think the random noises heard during the night are just old floor boards, bottles, or any other thing that might "moved" for it not beying placed properly? Do you think that beying with someone on the same room, or house, will stop it? Think again.

The uneasy feeling that you have every time when you are in DARKNESS, that is when you know it IS coressing you in it's corrosive arms. 
 
You might think how I know this, or why I am telling you this.

It told me to. 

It wants you to know that it IS watching every step, every move, every breath that you take.

It watches you sleep and it torments you with nightmares so vile that they better remain forgotten. 

Sleep paralisis IS a lie. That IS when it wants you to see it, it tangles your sowl and it shows you it's true form,  laughing as you sweat and dread in horror as it stays still, at the foot of your bed, watching your FEAR. 

It wants you to FEAR it. It lives on FEAR.

Now that you know, it will come after you. 

Or if you are reading this in darkness, it IS smiling knowing you looked arround in your room to see if anyone is there.

Every time you feel a pressence in the dark, it wants you to know it IS there over your showlder, taunting you. 

You might wonder why I said that it watching you so many times, and yet, you can not see it. I want you to be sure it IS there, WATCHING, waiting for the perfect time to strike you down. 

It IS laughing teeth showing knowing of what is abbout to happen. 

If you think this is just a storry, just a novel, just something someone has written for the fun of it, I am sorry. 

This is a warning for what is about to come. 

Now, there are wais to fight it, or at least, make it take longer for it to reach you. Keep light on, have a lamp, old stuff to trick kids. But this is not the answer. 

The real way to make it go away for some time, is to spread it to someone else. 

As soon as someone learns about it, it will come for them, and your reward is a good night's sleep, or so it told me. I hope it is true. 

I have not slept in so long, I forgot how it feels like to wake up and not feel tired. Now it's your turn. 

I am sorry, but there is no other way. 

DO NOT CLOSE YOUR EYES 

DO NOT THINK THIS IS A JOKE

STAY AWAKE
