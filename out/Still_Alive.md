If there is one thing I can say for certain, life isn’t fair. When someone profits, someone else also loses. There is no mutual success or failure. It’s just one way or the other. It all really comes down to who is greedier and who has more leverage. This is evident in every aspect of life. I should know, as I am, after all, a scavenger.

When you hear of a scavenger in war zones, you think of some imbecile stealing weapons and scraps and selling them off. I find that absurd, not only because of how high the chances are for you to get shot in the face but also because of the hard work involved. No, we are nothing like that. We are an official group with an official name given by some less than savory official.

The unit I was in is called “The Special Life Preservation Unit,” or “TSLPU” for short. Yes, it does sound pretentious, and no, we aren’t protecting any endangered species. Our line of work consists of harvesting organs from the recently deceased and those who are considered to be forfeit of life. Call it cruel. Stand on whatever moral high ground you want. At the end of the day, people need livers, and money will be spent for them. It might as well be me that is doing the selling. Metaphorically, of course. 

I was one of the few who handled the harvesting. It may sound easier than having to find and physically transport them back. However, it isn’t uncommon for the “donor’s” body to be in bad shape, and delicate hands are a necessity for whatever organs there are to be salvaged. 

It is less than ideal. And I am not even going to delve into the possible risks for such practices, but this wasn’t something I should be worried about. We make do with what we have. This was what I first learned when I began working here.

I was one of the first to be recruited. I had lost my license, and an old patient of mine said that it would be a waste to lose a man with hands as steady and skilled as mine. Thinking back, despite being a politician, he certainly was bad at his choice of words. 

After changing into the provided attire, I was escorted by a stern-looking man, whom I would later come to know as Cecil, into what could only be described as a meat storage area. Other than the instruments and the tray itself, everything else appeared to be worn down. Were it any other day, I would have said something about this, but there was something there that immediately caught my attention. In the center of the room, highlighted by the many surgical lights and obscured inside a body bag, was my first assignment. 

From just a simple glance, I knew what it was. The only thing that kept their identity from being confirmed was a simple zipper. I wanted to pull it down. And with each second that passed, I analyzed and came to the same conclusion over and over again. 

As though he read my thoughts, Cecil walked past me and pulled open the bag, which proved my suspicions correct.

It was a boy no older than thirteen. 

I wasn’t married, nor did I have a child. It wasn’t even the first time I had done this to someone of this age. Yet, were it not for Cecil’s glance, I don’t know how long I would have stared into that boy’s eyes. 

That didn’t matter. Before I could even think about anything else, a cart transporting another body creaked its way to us. This time, I didn’t even have to look at the stern man to know what he would say. There was no time to waste.  

It took me almost five hours to finish, two for the boy and three for the other one. There was almost nothing left of them by the end. They were nothing but a crude sketch of who they once were. 

I would have finished in less than three hours normally, but it was hard keeping my hands from shaking. I am pretty sure I made a few mistakes as well, though I didn’t know if Cecil noticed. It doesn’t matter now. What did matter was that I had secured the job.

If this was all I had to do, it was alright. They were dead, after all. As screwed up as things were, what we did saved lives.

“Get used to it.” Cecil said after we both walked out of the operation room. “If you think that’s the worst thing you’ll see, think again. I’ve seen some of them blink.” 

If he didn’t laugh that last sentence out, I wouldn’t have thought he was joking. However, I understood what he wanted to say, and he was right. We make do with what we have. 

Cecil was the person in charge of collection. I didn’t see him most of the time. However, he would be the one to wheel in someone at least once a week. And every time he did, he would cover the eyes with a small piece of fabric. I don’t know if he did it for me or for his own sake. I never did get to know him well, but it was cruel of them to not even close his eyes when they brought him into the operations room.

If only I cared less.

I learned to do it as time went on. I wasn’t trying to be generous. I always used the cheapest fabrics I could find. It helped.

Anyways, depending on the blood type, I would drain it before beginning the actual harvest. Whatever else needed to be taken was my colleagues’ concern. 

I had to only do this two to three times a day. I could have done more, but there wasn’t any potential for a raise or even a bonus. Every day, I hear complaints about an issue with the harvested organs. Of course, such talks only began after they decided to bring in damaged subjects, but I digress. 

It’s simply complaints from people who clearly don’t know much about this field that might as well be farts in the wind because of how unproductive they are. I’m pretty sure they’re also spreading rumors to dissuade us from asking for a raise. Talk about a lack of incentive. It is kind of disappointing, but what was I supposed to expect? It was just another job.

This is just how the world is, after all. They need me, and I need the money. I just had to go through with it. It wasn’t any of my problem anyway. I do as I am told. Any mistakes that occur can only be because of a fault in their instructions. After all, there’s no point in what I say. It’s all the same no matter where I go. 

I don’t even know why I am making most of this money. Even when I still had my license, I always asked myself. It’s not like I needed it. I was never a big spender. It’s all just sitting in the bank, but then why did I choose to become a surgeon? 

I think it’s because of it being a career path that’s always in high demand. Furthermore, it’s not like I’ll be replaced by some automated intelligence or system in my lifetime. Haha. I guess I simply wanted to be a necessity. 

I think it was only a few weeks ago when it happened. One of the collectors was wheeling in some new subjects. Of course, the bastard didn’t close their eyes. I didn’t even bother to say anything. By that point, I knew they were doing this intentionally. 

Nevertheless, I began like I always did and covered their eyes up. I connected the pump to the first subject and waited for the device to do its thing. The entirety of this procedure would have taken approximately forty minutes for each person. I used to preoccupy myself with a book, but of course someone complained, and I was stuck watching the bag fill.

I always told myself to not think too much about the person right in front of me. However, there would always be something that gave a small impression of who they once were. There were the occasional athletes who passed away before ever being able to make use of their well-trained bodies, the nameless artists whose works never got to see the light of day, the gluttons whose liver was of no use, and the lucky few who never got to stress over the tumor inside of them. None of them got to experience the full extent of the good and bad. It was all cut short.

There is now this poor soul in front of me. Nameless, with no defining features I could remember, perhaps simply in the middle all throughout. I wondered what kind of life he lived, what he had experienced, and how he would feel if he knew what would happen to him. He shouldn’t care. I wouldn’t either. He was dead, after all. 

Eventually, the bag filled to the brim. I moved in to change it into a different pack. As I inserted the needle, however, I felt a faint beating of the heart. It couldn’t be. I pressed my fingers on his wrist, and sure enough, there it was again. I realized what this had meant. Yet, I could only pull my hand backwards. I looked at his covered face. He definitely stared back. That was all I could remember about that moment.

I woke up to a blinding white light shining down on me. I wanted to look away, but I came to realize that I couldn’t move at all. Not my arms, not my legs, nothing. I couldn’t even shift my eyes elsewhere. Is this what it feels like to see the light?

Someone eventually approached, and to my initial relief, it was a colleague of mine… who was holding an incision knife.

I was still alive when they cut my body open. I forced myself to move, to speak, or to even blink. I wanted them to know I was still alive, but nothing came to be. And with each nerve that was severed, I was begging for it to all end. To my horror, not even this came to be.

I don’t know if anyone will ever hear or read this, but I am still alive. I- No, it would be more accurate to say parts of me are still alive. I can feel every gasp of air someone breathes in through my lungs, every bit of substance being broken down by my stomach and liver, and every single blood cell being pumped through my heart. It is all out of my control. Someone please put me back together; I am still alive.
