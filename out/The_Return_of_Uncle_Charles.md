We hated our new house.

Sure, it was big, and it looked like a mansion compared to our old place. A tall, redbrick house with a sloping black roof and rows of windows framed by black shutters. But it was always dark, even on sunny days, as if the house itself was hiding in the shadows of the gnarled old trees around it.

It was so creepy that even Josh, my little brother, was acting weird. Usually, he’s the loud one, complaining or making jokes. But ever since we got here, he barely said a word.

Mom and Dad didn’t seem to notice. They were too busy unpacking.

“I hate this place,” Josh muttered as we climbed the creaky stairs to explore the second floor.

“Same,” I agreed. I was trying to act brave for Josh, but I could feel the same chill he did. The kind that crawls up your back, making the hair on your arms stand on end.

Dad said we were lucky to get this house. His Great-Uncle Charles—who we’d never even heard of—left it to him in his will. Free house. Big yard. “A fresh start,” Dad called it.

But as soon as we arrived, something felt off. For one, the house seemed frozen in time. The furniture, the wallpaper, the thick velvet curtains—all of it looked like it belonged in a century-old photograph. It didn’t feel like a home. It felt like a museum where everything should be behind glass.

But the weirdest part? Dad didn’t remember Uncle Charles. Neither did Mom. “He must’ve been a great guy!” Dad had joked. “Leaving us this place.” But I could see in his eyes that he wasn’t so sure.

Josh and I split up to check out the rooms. I wandered into what must’ve been the master bedroom. It was enormous, with tall windows draped in heavy curtains. As I stepped inside, a strange smell hit me—like old leather and mothballs. On the far wall, a large painting hung in a thick, gold frame.

It was a portrait of a man.

I stepped closer, squinting at the faded brushstrokes. The man looked to be in his forties, with dark, slicked-back hair and sharp features. His eyes were dark and piercing, almost as if they were watching me.

"Who's that?" Josh’s voice startled me. He had snuck up behind me, staring wide-eyed at the painting.

“I guess it’s Great-Uncle Charles,” I said, unsure.

Josh tilted his head. “He looks kinda like Dad, don’t you think?”

I hadn’t noticed it before, but Josh was right. The man in the portrait did look like Dad—same serious face, same dark eyes. Only… older.

A weird feeling gnawed at me. “Let’s check the attic,” I said, trying to shake it off. Josh loved old, creepy attics, and I figured it might distract him.

We pulled the attic door down from the ceiling, and a rickety wooden ladder unfolded. Dust fell from the opening, making us cough.

“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Josh asked, his voice shaky.

I shrugged. “You’re not scared, are you?”

Josh straightened up, trying to look tough. “No way.”

We climbed the ladder, entering the dark, musty attic. It smelled even worse up here, like old books and something rotten. Cobwebs clung to every corner, and old trunks and boxes were piled against the walls.

“Look at this,” Josh said, his voice barely above a whisper. He pointed to the far corner of the attic, where a small, round table stood. On top of it was a framed photograph, covered in dust.

I wiped it clean with my sleeve. It was another picture of Uncle Charles—only this time, he looked even younger. And standing beside him was a man I recognized immediately.

“Dad?” Josh asked, his voice trembling.

I stared at the photo. There was no mistaking it. Dad was standing next to Uncle Charles, smiling. Only… he looked exactly the same as he does now. Not younger. The exact same.

“That’s impossible,” I whispered.

“Maybe it’s, like, a trick photo or something,” Josh said, backing away. “Maybe someone edited it.”

Before I could respond, a loud creak echoed from the corner of the attic. Both of us froze.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered.

Josh nodded, his eyes wide.

The creak came again, louder this time, like someone—or something—was moving in the shadows. Slowly, the door to one of the old trunks slid open, revealing a long, dark shape inside.

I grabbed Josh’s hand and we backed toward the ladder. But before we could move, the shape in the trunk stirred. A hand—thin, pale, and bony—reached out.

“Get out,” a voice hissed from the shadows.

We bolted down the ladder, nearly tripping over each other as we hit the hallway. The attic door slammed shut behind us with a deafening bang.

We raced downstairs, our hearts pounding.

“Mom! Dad!” I shouted, but the house was eerily quiet.

Suddenly, I noticed something. Dad was standing in the living room, staring blankly at the wall. He didn’t move, didn’t blink.

“Dad?” I called, stepping toward him.

No answer.

Then I saw it. On the wall above him was another portrait of Uncle Charles—but this time, he wasn’t alone.

Standing next to him, smiling that same strange smile, was Dad.

Josh grabbed my arm. “We have to get out of here. Now.”

As we turned to run, we heard the attic door creak open again. Footsteps—slow and heavy—thudded down the stairs.

“Welcome home,” a familiar voice said from behind us.

We didn’t need to turn around to know who it was. Uncle Charles had returned.
