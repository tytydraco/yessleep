Science can’t fully understand dreams yet. We traversed the depths of the world, into space, but we still can’t comprehend these short movies our brains play in the middle of the night. Our best guess is that they’re symbolism for our subconscious to communicate with us. Of course, you can look at what the non-scientists say. Maybe we switch places with our alternate dimension versions when we sleep, maybe ancient deities use dreams to manipulate us, maybe dreams are messages sent to us by aliens.

No. It’s none of the above. I mean, dreams **are** related to your subconscious thoughts, but that’s not all there is. I say this because (I don’t mean to sound cocky but) there is no single human in the world that knows more about dreams than I do.

Before I get to my point, I should let you know that I won’t use anyone’s real names, since I’m about to reveal their deepest, darkest secrets. I know I shouldn’t but it’s the only way my story will make sense. You can call me Star. As you can probably see in the title, I’m a dreamwalker. What does that mean, though?

It all started around five years ago. Lil' teenager me was obsessed with how the human mind worked, especially dreams. So, one night, I decided to attempt lucid dreaming. Probably thanks to my nature, I did it at first try. And there it was, a whole world just for me. I did pretty much anything one would want to do in a lucid dream. I flew through the clouds, got back at the class bitch, Megan and a lot more. Things were great, until something strange happened.

I was opening a pizza box, but instead of a delicious circle of fat, there was a… a void. I— I don’t know how else to describe it. It looked like a black hole, except it wasn’t black, it was in a color my mortal mind couldn’t recognize, so it appeared in my vision as a blind spot. A nothing. I knew I wasn’t imagining this, but I didn’t question it at the moment. **Dreams** are weird, after all. Following an instinct, I dove towards it. My body getting pulled inside by an invisible force. I found myself somewhere else.

I was on the roof of a brick house. The house itself was strange, cartoonish. The surrounding area was stranger. It was in the middle of the woods, surrounded by similar houses. It looked like someone copy-pasted a bunch of houses into the forest. As soon as I finished looking around, I realized something threw me into panic. I had no control. Yes, I was aware I was in a dream and I could still move, but outside of that, I couldn’t do anything. I suddenly felt powerless.

“Calm down, this is your first time lucid dreaming. This is normal… right?”

I decided to try flying. I jumped… fell back down, rolled down the roof and crashed against the soil. It hurt like hell, but not as much as it would have if this was the real world. I started to feel like I was waking up. But through sheer will, I forced myself to stay dreaming.

“Goddammit…”

I muttered as I got up. I heard a voice from somewhere above, from the roof of another house.

“I told you I won’t eat the marshmallow!”

Looking up, I recognised the voice. It belonged to a short little girl with a pink dress. She was Lily, my boyfriend’s sister, climbing out of a chimney.

“But Lily, it will cure cancer!”

Following her out of the chimney was my boyfriend, Liam.

That ridiculous scene distracted me from my pain and confusion. While I was hoping to keep watching, Lily's eyes turned to me. Suddenly, the grumpy look on her face disappeared, replaced by a blank expression. Then, that expression gave way to a blur. It was like the space around her distorted. Before I could look closer, I felt the ground beneath my feet shift. I started falling, or rather sinking. When I looked down, I saw the grass-covered soil had turned into quicksand.

“Oh shi—“

I tried to pull my feet out of it, which only caused me to lose my balance and fall. Now my arms were caught in it too. I did my best to wiggle out of it, to no avail. I was being pulled below the ground and there was nothing I could do. Soon enough, sand started seeping in through my nose and mouth, filling my lungs. I couldn't breathe. Just as I was sure death would welcome me, I woke up. I started coughing violently. At some point, I tasted something metallic and thick in my mouth. When I coughed it out, my sheets turned red.

Blood.

I realised I was crying blood too. As soon as my breathing got steady, I rushed to the bathroom. I washed my face until all the blood was gone. Only then I calmed down.

*Okay… Think now. What the heck was that!?*

Memories of that dream slowly started coming back to me. The lucid dreaming, the woods, **the drowning**.

*Don’t be stupid. There is no way this happened because of my dream.*

Of course, I would later find out that’s exactly what happened. But at the time, I assumed I was sick, like any normal person would. I told my parents I woke up coughing and crying blood, they didn’t believe me, I showed them the blood on the sink and my sheets, they believed me, and I spent the day in hospital. After many, many tests that didn’t show any result, I was sent home and my parents were told to keep an eye on me. Needless to say, they were freaking out. But I kept reassuring them I was fine.

Later that evening, I was talking to Liam on the phone.

“You didn’t show up to school today. Is everything okay?”

He would have had a heart attack if I told him I woke up coughing and crying blood that morning, so I told a little white lie.

“Just a little cold, nothing to worry about.”

He sounded a little relieved after that.

“That’s good to hear. So, what are you doing this weekend?”

“I will probably rest in bed. Got nothing better to do.”

I hesitated for a moment or two before asking:

“Hey Liam, did you have any weird dreams lately?”

He was used to me asking out of pocket questions, so he answered after thinking for a while.

“Funny you should ask, actually. Just last night, I had this weird dream. I was home, but there was no texture on anything, almost like a cartoon…”

I flinched a little when I heard that, and kept listening.

“And all the houses in the neighborhood looked the same too. Actually, I think it was in a forest, anyway. I was talking to Lily and… what else, what else?”

That question wasn’t directed to me, but I answered anyway.

“A marshmallow?”

I vaguely heard him snap his fingers.

“Yeah! I was trying to get her to eat a marshmallow. How did you guess?”

A long silence followed as I was deep in thought. I was thinking the same thing, too.

“Just a lucky guess… I’m a little tired, mind if I hang up?”

His next words sounded a little disapointed.

“Sure. Love you, bye.”

“Love you too.”

That’s when our call ended. I was still trying to understand what was going on. But one thing was certain: That dream wasn’t normal.
