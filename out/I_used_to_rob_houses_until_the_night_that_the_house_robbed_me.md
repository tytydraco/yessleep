I used to be a professional criminal, my speciality was home invasions. Get in, get the goods, get out. Now, I'm not going to pretend to be a good guy or like I made good life choices in the past. I also don't want to glorify or romanticize what I used to do. What I do want to do is tell people this story because it has haunted me for so many years and I don't know how much longer I can go on with this guilt. 

That night, there were four of us: Juan, Marcus, Tanner, and myself.
Our target was a single story house, a real easy in and out job. We had scoped it out for days and had everything planned out but when we pulled up, the TV was on and someone was home. 

We should've called it a night right there, instead, Marcus spotted a different house.

“No car, no lights,” he said. “Better pick.”

I didn’t like it. I felt it in my gut that we needed to call it a night. I remember clearly saying "nah, this one's not right, let's get out of here and regroup."

“Look, I'm down bad." Juan muttered. "I'm with Marcus. Let's do this shit." 

Marcus playfully slapped my shoulder and I nodded, we always looked out for one another and hit jobs when someone was down and needed money, that night was no different in that aspect.

Tanner turned the wheel and off we went.

We pulled up and creeped towards the back of the house and slipped in the back door with minimal effort. Juan had barely touched the lock before it clicked. Dude was a wizard at that shit.

First thing we noticed was how fucking cold the house was and then came the odor, the air carried a sour copper tang, faint at first, but growing as we moved. As we moved through the house, we all started looking through everything we could find but just as Tanner had pulled the last drawer open in the living room, we heard the front door click open. Marcus froze with his mouth half open and Tanner mouthed a slow deliberate "fuck" Juan then nodded his head towards the stairs and we all creeped for the staircase, trying to make our boots silent. I could hear the door downstairs shut, the click of the lock and by the time we reached the top, I knew whoever had come in wasn’t leaving. The hallway stretched long ahead, there was a dim yellow light bleeding from a single bulb and we could make out that there was 6 closed doors. Juan went first, trying the nearest bedroom, inside was a sheetless bed, a single shoe in the middle of the floor but nothing else. “Clear,” he muttered, but from below came the slow, deliberate sound of shoes on wood. Like a reminder that we needed to get the fuck out of there.

Marcus opened the second door and it was clearly the bathroom, the mirror was shattered with glass in the sink. I ripped the shower curtain back but there was nothing. Tanner then opened the third door and as soon as he did the smell hit before any sight, it was what I could best describe as metallic and wet. Inside, there was a man slumped against the wall, his wrists were bound with tape and his head was bent at an unnatural angle. Marcus gagged, Tanner let out a whispered "fuck, fuck, fuck." but Juan with a tremor in his voice said “Keep moving.” At this point we were all freaking the fuck out and trying to get through this house of horrors. The steps downstairs stopped and there was a moment of silence. Then just as quick as the silence had come, we heard one heavy, dragging creak of the first stair. I rushed to open the fourth door which was obviously a child’s room, it had peeling wallpaper with cartoon bears and then I noticed something small under the covers. I stopped in my tracks, my mind already knowing what it was but Marcus stepped forward, pulled the blanket back and then staggered away, before puking everywhere. 

We could hear more steps on the stairs and they were much closer now, what followed his steps sounded like a weird thud. Juan rushed through the fifth door and inside was a woman tied to a chair, her throat had been slit so deep it was a miracle her head was even attached. We all ran for the last room and the smell was at its strongest, sour rot mixed with the iron tang of fresh blood. Tanner’s hands shook as he reached the last door at the end of the hall, this one had a newer lock and fresher paint. The footsteps behind us began again, slower, heavier and still followed by a large thud. Juan pushed Tanner aside and kicked the door open, in an instant the stench slammed into us. There were three bodies, two crumpled on the floor, one hanging from a rope in the ceiling beam, all in different stages of decay. They all looked to be teenage girls. Then came another large step followed by a large thud and we knew he was at the top of the stairs. 

“Window,” I shouted. We ran to it but it was painted shut. Marcus began slamming his shoulder into the frame over and over until it was finally broke enough to open. Tanner went first, then Marcus. Juan shoved me forward through the window and out onto the roof of the house, as I landed and stood up, I turned back just long enough to see him. He was halfway down the hall, tall and broad, face hidden in shadow, moving with a slow deliberate no fucks given type of attitude. Then I realized, he was dragging a woman by her hair, her mouth was taped shut and she made eye contact with me. 

I yanked Juan through and we all jumped to the ground, landing hard. We all ran as soon as we got up, not looking back until the house was a shadow behind us. 

We couldn't call the police without getting ourselves in trouble so we just left it. 

Problem is, guilt doesn't just leave. We've all lived with regret from that point forward. 

Marcus ended up in prison and eventually died from a stab wound while out on the prison yard. Juan was out drunk driving and crashed into a tree ending his life right then and there. Then there's Tanner, he got hooked on drugs and ended up hanging himself in his own garage. 

So here I am, the last survivor and the only one who knows the truth. 

I needed to get this out there and I needed to unleash this truth from my heavy heart. I so badly wish we didn't hit that house that night and I wish we could've saved that girl. I hate the images I'm haunted by from what that monster did to those people.

I don't think I can live with this guilt any longer, that night robbed me of my friends, my sanity and my will to live. So this is my confession and likely my goodbye.
