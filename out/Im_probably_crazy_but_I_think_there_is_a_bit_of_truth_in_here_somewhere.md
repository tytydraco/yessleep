I do not think I am sound of mind. The events of this story must be hallucinations or delusions. But I think they are wrapped around something true and twisted. 
Whatever it is, my brain doesn’t want me to know it. I can barely think about it too hard without getting a headache.

I am going to write down everything that I remember happening. Maybe someone else has the clarity of mind to figure this out.

It started with the spotlights. Not real spotlights, that’s just what I’ve started calling them. At first it was a feeling that every light was shining stronger on me in particular.

It was faint at first, but it started building. Until eventually everything around me seemed dimmer and dimmer. 

One night I had gotten out of bed to get water. The house was completely dark, but the moonlight streaming in from the open window illuminated my body and a circle of floor at my feet perfectly.

I left my house one evening only to find I had stepped onto a stage. All eyes were on me as I walked to the convenience store. I was the star. I couldn’t tell if I loved the attention or if I wanted to turn myself inside out.

I only found out when the spotlights stopped.

I woke up on a Tuesday to find I was once again in the dark. The lights of my house shone on my roommate just the same as they shone on me. The sun did not favor me over the others on the sidewalk.

I went through my day as another member of the crowd. Then I got home and cried. No one saw, no one cared. Why should they?

I looked out the window and noticed a new oddity. In the peripherals of my vision, there was a hole in the street and another in the row of houses across the street. When I looked straight at it everything was as it should be. Then when I looked away there was a gap, I knew it. A wide gaping hole in the concrete road, and the wreckage of where a house had been torn right out of its foundation. But no there wasn’t.

I went back inside and tried to forget about it.

Then the next day, the spotlights were back. They bathed me in light and importance. I mattered again.

The holes were gone too. Everything was right and good. I felt weightless the whole day.

This kept up for another week before the spotlights disappeared again, and the not-quite-holes returned. I tried not to be sad about it. The spotlights came back last time, shouldn’t they be back again? But no, they were gone the next day too.

The holes were more solid. I could stare at them, glare all I wanted. But that wouldn’t do any good. It’s not like the absence of a thing can look back.

That evening I decided to investigate the holes. I peered into the missing chunk of the street for a while before deciding it was too dangerous to go down. Then I turned to the rubble where a house should be.

There was a strange resistance as I tried to step over and into the area. I walked into the center of the wreckage. It took more steps to get to the center than it should have, and the further in I went the more dreamlike everything felt.

Right in the middle, half-buried under chunks of concrete and dust was a box. It was made of dark wood, and had a large metal lock on the front.

Something about the box was unbearably alluring. I wanted to open it, to know what secrets it might hold. Before I knew it I had picked up a broken chunk of concrete and smashed the lock. Inside was a stack of paper.

Photos, sketches, and drawings, there must have been hundreds of them. Some were old, in some you could barely tell what was depicted. Others were crystal clear. They were all pictures of me.

Tears ran down my face; blood ran down my arms. Someone had cared, and now they didn’t. They had seen me in my spotlight and now I was dull and they didn’t care.

I grabbed a fistful of the pictures. I didn’t know whether I wanted to rip them up or treasure them forever. They crumpled in my hand and were stained by my blood. They fell through my palms as I dissolved into sticky red liquid.

I stumbled, dripping, from the remains of the house. My vision blurred, I couldn’t stand, couldn’t breathe. I nearly fell into my roommate when I made it back to my house.

She reached out a hand to steady me, concern on her face. I was confused. Then I blacked out.

I can’t remember what happened after that. I woke up in a hospital bed.

My roommate, Angie, cried when she saw me. She cried more when I asked why she was crying.

Eventually she told me what happened.

She had been microwaving leftover pizza when I nearly fell into her. I had been covered in blood, with glass shards on my clothes and sticking out of my skin. I passed out from blood loss. She called 911.

Apparently I broke through the window of the house that was a hole. The man that lived there was out of town.

I chose not to tell anyone about the holes, or the spotlights.

I don’t know what’s going to happen about the breaking and entering. The man who lives in the house has decided to not press charges. I have a feeling everything will be alright.

The spotlights are brighter than ever.
