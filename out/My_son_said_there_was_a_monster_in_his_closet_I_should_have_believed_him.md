“Daddy, the monster in my closest is back again” my son said as he shook me in my bed.   
  
“We’ve been over this, Jason. There’s no monster in your closet” I muttered still only half conscious knowing it was of no use. I thought the “monster in the closet” was some cliché thing kids only go through in movies. But at least 3 times per week now, ever since we moved into our new apartment, my son comes and wakes me up at 2:30 in the morning.    
  
   
  
“Yes there is daddy” my son said. I could tell by the sound of his voice he was holding back tears. “He keeps looking at me and grinning.”    
  
   
  
Grinning, I thought to myself. That’s a new one. I rolled over and made space for my son in my and my wife’s bed. There was no point in arguing. I’ve tried proving to my son that there’s no monster in his closet, but nothing seems to work. No matter how many times I search it, he always comes back and says it’s still there. If I wanted any chance of sleeping, I would just have to deal with him kneeing me in the ribs for the rest of the night.    
  
   
  
The next morning I planned to talk to my son about this. I couldn’t carry on like this. I worked long hours and needed sleep. Sleep I wasn’t getting with my son kicking me in the kidneys all night.    
  
   
  
“Jason, we need to talk about this monster” I said taking a seat at the breakfast table. Cereal again, I thought to myself. My wife must have woken up too. She only served cereal when she was exhausted from not sleeping herself.    
  
   
  
“He’s real daddy, I promise!” my son said with utmost sincerity.    
  
   
  
“I know you believe he’s real, but I’ve checked your closet a dozen times. No monster,” I said.    
  
   
  
“Your father’s right honey” my wife chimed in. “You’re just frightened because this place is still new.”   
  
   
  
I looked at my son and nodded in agreement with my wife.    
  
   
  
“I’m not lying!” my son yelled. “Why would I lie about this?” I could see tears swelling in his eyes. Whenever talk of his “monster” would come up he would get emotional. I sighed.    
  
   
  
“Nobody is accusing you of lying, Jason” I said. “But there is no monster. You only started seeing it when we moved in here. It’s a new place. That  means new sounds, new smells, and sometimes you might think you see things that aren’t real. It’s just a shadow or something you aren’t used to seeing at night.”   
  
   
  
“Do shadows smile? Or do they laugh?” my son responded sounding sure of himself.    
  
   
  
“Smile and laugh?” my wife asked. The tone in her voice was different. Either she thought what my son said was funny or she was a little scared herself. Maybe both.    
  
   
  
“He said last night it was grinning, but this is the first I’m hearing of laughing” I replied.    
  
   
  
“He was just staring at me and grinning,” Jason said, “but then he started quietly laughing like this,” he said as began making soft cackling noises. “That’s when I woke you up.”   
  
I exhaled. This routine had become exhausting, but my son wasn’t lying. Whatever it was, he really thought it was a monster and it really was troubling him.   
  
   
  
“Do you want me to check your closet again?” I asked, knowing it would do no good.   
  
   
  
“No. He’s really good at hiding” my son responded.    
  
   
  
“How do you know it’s a ‘he’” my wife asked?   
  
   
  
“Because he looks like a man” my son replied.    
  
   
  
For the first time since this ordeal started, I was a little spooked. What if there was some man hiding in our house and watching our son? No, I thought, that’s ridiculous. There’s nowhere anyone could hide in our house. I had been everywhere in it, including the attic.    
  
   
  
“How about this,” I said, “after work, I’ll put a camera in your room. Right above your bed and looking at the closet. I’ll also put one in the closet. If there’s anything in there, we’ll catch in on camera.”   
  
   
  
My son looked excited at the idea. He had been trying to prove for some time now that this monster of his was real, but he could never find any real evidence. I guess to him this would finally prove to his parents that he wasn’t just seeing things.”   
  
   
  
“Really?” my son said.   
  
“Mhm, I’ll put them in tonight.”   
  
   
  
“Thanks daddy” my son said while reaching forward to hug me.    
  
   
  
“What if you actually catch something?” my wife said with a chuckle as our son left for his bus. I could tell by her tone she was only half joking   
  
   
  
“What? A tree branch casting a shadow on the closet door?” I said reassuringly. My wife grinned as she gathered her bag and prepared herself for work.    
  
   
  
I installed the cameras later that night after dinner. One above my son’s bed facing the closet, and one in the closet itself. They seemed to do the trick. Several weeks went by with my son not seeing the “monster” once. My wife said the cameras must have made him feel safer and calmed his imagination. I agreed and was grateful the situation was over and I could finally sleep peacefully.    
  
   
  
It looks like my luck is over, I thought to myself as I felt my son tug on my blankets. “What is it, Jason?” I asked, hoping he just didn’t feel well or something.    
  
   
  
My son said in a whispered voice, “he’s back, and he seems angry about the cameras.”   
  
   
  
I was going to roll over and allow for my son to sleep in our room tonight, but I didn’t want to lose all the progress we had made. I sat up and slid into my slippers. My wife groaned. She was a heavy sleeper, but it appeared Jason had woken her up as well. “Let’s go check the cameras” I said, hoping I could assure my son nothing was in his room and he could return to bed.    
  
   
  
The cameras were connected to my phone through the internet. I stood in the hallway with him and opened the app for the camera. It showed a clear image of his room undisturbed.    
  
   
  
“He must have left” my son said. “Can you rewind it?”    
  
   
  
I was about to ask my son at what time he saw the monster, but I already knew. I rewound the camera to 2:25, 5 minutes before the “monster” would appear. Together, we stood in the hallway watching the footage. The minutes ticked by, and nothing happened in the video. I was just about to turn it off and usher my son back to bed when the footage at 16 seconds past 2:30 completely cut out. It didn’t come back on until after my son had left his room.    
  
   
  
“See!” my son yelled. “He cut off the camera, I told you he was real.”   
  
   
  
I stood stunned. What are the odds of the cameras glitching out at that exact moment? For a moment, I almost believed my son’s story. I shook my head, what am I thinking, of course there’s no monster. The cameras just glitched. Still, I knew after that, there was no way I was getting my son to go back to his room.  “We’ll talk about this tomorrow” I said.    
  
   
  
“So are you going to tell me about the cameras” my wife said with her arms crossed. Jason had just left for school and I had been debating if I should tell my wife about the previous night. It was nothing and I didn’t want to scare her.   
  
   
  
“There’s nothing wrong with them” I replied. “It was just some glitch, or maybe the internet went out.”    
  
   
  
“At the exact time our son said he saw the monster?” my wife asked. “Doesn’t that sound a little convenient?”   
  
   
  
I shrugged. Coincidences happened. Besides, was it more likely that the cameras had some kind of error or that a monster was living in our son’s closet?    
  
   
  
“I’ll check on them later and see what happened” I said. My wife didn’t seem too pleased with that answer, but it’s all I could do at the time. I had to leave for work.    
  
   
  
When I checked the cameras later that night, I was happy to find that everything was fine. They were in the same place and were working fine with no signs of damage. I let out a sigh of relief. I told myself it was because I was glad I wouldn’t have to explain any damages to my son, but I knew that what had happened the night before freaked me out a little too.    
  
   
  
I told my son—and my wife—that there was nothing wrong with the cameras and that what happened the previous night was just a coincidence. Neither of them seemed entirely convinced, but they accepted my answer. What I didn’t tell them was that I had checked the camera footage and found that every night, between 2:30 and 2:32, the camera footage would go blank for 5 minutes. I planned to contact our internet provider and see if they were doing some kind of maintenance or something at that time, and I had no intentions of scaring my family more until I had ruled out the other possibilities. For now, I was grateful that the issue seemed to be resolved again.    
  
   
  
That is, until I felt the same familiar tugging on my bed that night. “Again?” I asked, rolling over. I wasn’t even going to bother checking the cameras again. Based on what I had seen, I knew the cameras went out and there was no point in scaring my family further. “She’s back” my son said. Time for another restless night.    
  
   
  
Neither me nor my wife pressed the topic further the next day. I told them I checked the cameras and there was nothing there. Of course, I lied. I didn’t want to tell them the truth, that the camera footage had cut out again. My wife just assumed our son was falling back into his habit and my son was happy when I told him there was nothing in the footage. That is, until later that night at dinner when he decided to bring the topic back up.    
  
   
  
“She looked different last night” my son said, stuffing his mouth with mashed potatoes.    
  
   
  
“She?” my wife retorted. “I thought you said the monster was a man?”   
  
   
  
“That’s what I thought,” Jason responded. “He--well, she—used to look like a man. But now...” Jason trailed off looking at his plate. “I know what it is!” he yelled excitedly. There was a tinge of relief in his voice. “It was you mommy! The monster looked just like you!”    
  
   
  
“Me?” my wife said. I could tell she was getting frightened. “Honey, I was never in your room last night. Why would I do that? And I why did you say before it looked like a man?”   
  
   
  
“I can see her better now” Jason said. I had also put a nightlight in his closet. “She looks like you. You must have been pranking me all this time!”   
  
   
  
“Sweety, why would I--”    
  
   
  
I cut my wife off before she could finish. I had a new theory. One that finally made sense.    
  
   
  
“Didn’t you say you used to sleepwalk, Elizabeth?” I asked.    
  
   
  
“Well, yeah, but that was when I was a child” she replied.    
  
   
  
“I’ve heard before sleep walking can return as an adult. Maybe you’ve been sleep walking this whole time. That’s why--” I cut myself off. I was about to tell them about the cameras being cut off every night. I now theorized that my wife was doing it. She had access to my phone which meant she had access to the camera app. It made sense, but I still didn’t want to tell them.   
  
   
  
“How come I’m in bed every night when Jason comes and wakes you up?” my wife asked. “Why does he never see me leave, either?”    
  
   
  
That was true and posed an issue for my theory. Still, this was the most sensible explanation so far. I offered to find out the truth. They inquired how I planned to do this since the cameras were useless, but I didn’t want to potentially spoil what I had in mind in case it altered the situation. I planned to lay in bed every night and pretend to sleep, hoping to catch my wife leaving for our son's room. I would nap during the day, and otherwise just hoped it wouldn’t be long until an incident. “Just trust me,” I told them.    
  
   
  
I awoke later that night with my son not tugging on my blankets this time, but slapping me in the face. Shit, I thought to myself. I fell asleep.    
  
   
  
“Daddy please, it’s angry!” Jason glanced over to my wife’s side of the bed. “Where’s mommy?” I shot up and looked to the side. It’s true. Elizabeth was gone. I was right, I thought. It was my wife. She must be in my son’s room right now and I could finally put an end to this nightmare. I got up and made my way to my son's room.    
  
   
  
When I entered Jason’s room and turned on the light, the room was a mess. Also, Elizabeth was nowhere to be seen. The closet door was wide open.    
  
   
  
“Elizabeth!” I shouted. Nobody answered.    
  
   
  
“Daddy...” Jason said. I could tell he was terrified.    
  
I “shushed” at him and crept towards the closet. I was certain I would find my wife—the “monster”-- sitting inside.    
  
   
  
What I found instead was nothing. Nothing but a stench. “What is that smell?” I yelled, pinching my nose. I searched through the closet in search of the awful stench. I found nothing. I was about to give up and go find me wife when I noticed under an old wooden box something red was leaking from underneath. I moved the box and was hit with a smell that caused bile to build in the back of my throat. That, however, was the least of my concerns.    
  
   
  
I found the source of the smell. A bloody piece of what looked like skin with small pieces of green fabric stuck on. I recognized it as a shirt my son had.    
  
   
  
“Jason, what the hell is this” I said turning towards him. I stopped halfway and stood motionless. My son—or, whatever that was—sat grinning on his bed. His teeth were sharp like that of an animal and he let out a soft cackle.    
  
   
  
“Ja...Jason...?”    
  
   
  
He continued to cackle.    
  
   
  
“Elizabeth!” I screamed as loud as I could. “Elizabeth!”   
  
   
  
Just then my wife entered the room. I frantically pointed at our son. “There’s something wrong with Jason” I yelped.    
  
My wife said nothing. Instead, she just turned and looked at me with the same toothy grin our son had. She began to cackle softly.
