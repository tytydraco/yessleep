Early Monday Morning, July 10th, 2023, at about 12:50 a.m. I was driving Matt's 2020 Toyota Yaris back to his house. After getting some gas and going to the local 24/7 CVS, he asked about Tower Street in Bristol, (We were in central East Providence at this point). He asked me if I had ever been there or heard of it; When I told him I had never heard of it, let alone been there, he told me about a time that he went when he was young.  I will paraphrase what he said. When he was younger, he went there with a group of friends. They went about halfway down the street and shut the car off, and stayed there for about 30 to 40 minutes. When they turned the car back on, there was writing in the fog on the windows. I wished this is what happened when he and I went.

This is what happened when Matt and I went to the cursed road. We turn onto the road, and there was this relatively newly developed neighborhood at the top of the street, so we roll through the neighborhood at a reasonable pace. Once we got to where the street lights stop the woods take over the road. We got to the first bend, and then we saw about 10 to 15 deer just standing there on the road. I slowly cruised past them, using the horn when necessary to scare them out of the road. At the second bend in the road, shit got even sketchier. At this point, the trees enveloped the road completely to the point where we couldn't see the sky or moonlight anymore. We kept going until we got to the point of the road that is private, turned around, shut the car off, and waited for the lights to turn off.

After about one or two minutes of complete silence and darkness, our eyes started to adjust to the darkness. I looked in the rearview mirror and saw this large emaciated figure that was about 8 feet tall. It looked like a mix of a man and a buck standing on its hind legs walking toward us slowly. At the same time, I saw this figure in the rearview mirror, Matt saw a glowing white figure about 5 or 6 feet tall with a wispy tail cross the road quickly; it was about 2 car lengths in front of us. I looked down from the mirror and saw the same thing and immediately turned the car on, slammed it into drive, and floored it out of there.

It didn't end there. The creature I saw in the rearview mirror started chasing us and kept up with us. At this point, I looked down at the speedometer, and we are going 120+ mph. We hit a hill, and the wheels left the road surface. The view of the creature was obstructed temporarily. When the car landed back on the ground, the creature was even closer than before. This creature kept tailing us until we left the forested area and got back to the neighborhood, where I felt safe enough to slow down to an average speed.

We drove back to Matt's house in utter disbelief and silence; when we got home, we checked the outside of the car, and written in the dirt on the back of the car were the words "Leave NOW." After reading this, my side started to burn. It was as if I just got scratched. When I lifted my shirt, I asked Matt if there was anything there, and sure enough, there were 3 scratch marks in perfect lines, like someone took their middle three fingers and dragged them along my side. 

Please someone help me find out what this was.
