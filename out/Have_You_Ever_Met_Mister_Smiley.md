 Every night, I dread his presence. It was one time.


"Don’t stay up too late,” Mom said one evening. “We'll be back.”


“Yeah,” I said sarcastically. “Tell Aunt Emma I said 'hi.'” 


I looked on as Dad carried the last luggage through the door. He massaged his shoulder and I teased him. He rolled his eyes.


“Listen to Mom,” he said before disappearing into the darkness. A warm breeze swept into the hall. The crickets sang from the grass.


“Sunday night, remember?” Mom winked at me and kissed my cheek. “Won’t be long.”


“Today’s Friday,” I said. “I know.” 


After saying goodbye, she reminded me, “*Don’t* stay up too late unless you want *Mister Smiley* to come over.”


I scoffed. *Mister Smiley*. A made up Boogeyman like Freddy Krueger. Something made up to scare kids from doing dumb stuff. I was too big for that.


Mom and Dad drove away in no time, and I finally had the whole house to myself. Friday night. A good night for video games. I stared at the clock in the living room. It ticked. It’s almost nine. 


Perfect.


The PlayStation 2 sat in front of the TV, just waiting for me. My collection of games neatly stacked in a small cardboard box was beside it. I popped open a can of soda and plugged in my controller. I fingered through the first few games. *Resident Evil 4*, *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and *Dynasty Warriors 4*. I made a quick pick. It’s time to beat Lu Bu.


Time flew by and I cursed at the screen. My thumbs and fingers were sore. Lu Bu, the mightiest warrior of the Three Kingdoms, had beaten my ass too many times. Another try at the map and after an intense button mashing, I failed. 


“I UPGRADED MY BEST WEAPON!” I threw my controller across the room. “WHAT THE HELL!”


After playing a few more games, I checked the clock. It’s almost twelve. Midnight. Suddenly, I remembered Mom’s words:


*“Don’t stay up too late unless you want Mister Smiley to come over.”*


I scoffed again. *A myth*. I continued on with my games. Before I knew it, time reached one AM. A few more rounds and I was getting drowsy. 


Turning off my console, I then checked the doors and windows. It’s really dark and our neighbor’s dog barked from outside.


“Annoying dog,” I muttered. “So annoying.”


As I kept checking, I jumped as I heard fast tap-tap-tap-tap sounds on one of the windows. Solid taps. Scrambling, I grabbed the broom for defense as I approached it. The taps grew louder. My blood rushed and I screamed at it to stop. I tapped back and the tapping stopped. Mustering courage, I lifted the blinds in a flash and saw a pair of yellow eyes, its shaggy face pressed on the glass. I screamed, tapping the end of the broomstick against the window frantically. The thing hissed and ran away. Next I swallowed my breath and waited a few minutes in case it came back. Saw nothing, but heard the barking dog and singing crickets. The moon shone silver-blue.


“Damn cat.” I rubbed my eyes. “I need to sleep soon.”


Another quick round showed nothing and I relaxed, figuring I was just hearing things. I slumped into the couch and realized how soft it was. My eyes peeked one last time at the clock. One-thirty.


Everything was fine until I woke up. I had the weirdest feeling. The lights were still on and the clock had just struck two. One more look around and I screamed. My heart went insane as I faced a very tall person in front of me. Goosebumps and I fell on the floor. I didn’t know what or who it was. But I thought it was Big Bird’s ugly cousin or something. No idea.


“WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!” I crawled backwards against the wall, away from the couch. “WHAT ARE YOU?!”


This thing, a monster, maybe six five, had a pale yellow oval face with no nose. The eyes glowed evil red through the sockets and the head was covered in purple feathers. The body downwards was covered in  either thick brown fur like a grizzly or feathers like a fat turkey. But there’s something about those long nails or claws.


“WHO ARE YOU?!”


This thing smiled at me and cracked out an insane laugh like the Joker. 


“Don’t you recognize me?” Those words made my skin crawl.  “I’m *Mister Smiley*…”


I felt my stomach drop. Was this really him? The stupid boogeyman that every parent warned us kids about? I wanted to pretend, closing my eyes then opening them. But I felt Mister Smiley’s breath. *He* was real. I tried to get away as he came closer. 


“Have you been naughty tonight?” He raised his large hand. **“Let me give you a smile!”** 


Fast as lightning, I dodged Mister Smiley’s swipe. A flower vase broke and I used that moment to run. Thank God I was one of the fastest kids in school. Those running sessions in gym class really paid off. As I ran, I cried. I tried every door knob upstairs. Nothing could open for some reason. The bathroom. The hall closet. My parents’ room. Nothing. Mom and Dad had a strict rule against locked doors. So weird. I scrambled as I heard creaking from the stairs. It took me a minute to realize *he’s* coming.


“Where are you?” Mister Smiley’s shadow along the wall grew taller and taller. “Why play hide and go seek?”


My heart pounded and my hands sweated as I inched along the wall a few feet away. My breathing was a bit thrown off. Mister Smiley’s shadow grew until he reached the landing. I held my breath and glanced at a crack of a door ahead of me. My room. 


“Come out, little mouse!” Mister Smiley’s eyes glowed dark red in the dark. **“Let me give you a smile!”** 


Not a second later, I ran for my room. My footsteps were softer than his but I dared not check. I didn’t even think of his heavy footsteps behind me as I dove into my room and locked the door. I hid under my bed and heard the loudest scratch ever.


Scratch-scratch-scratch. I put my hands to muff my ears. Scratch-scratch-scratch. I thought it would never stop, so I screamed, “OKAY, OKAY! I’M GONNA GO SLEEP NOW! I'M SMILING!” I said it over and over until the scratching stopped. Finally. 


It was over.


Or was it?


I trembled and swallowed. Was it really over? Slowly I propped myself against the door. Nothing. I knocked in case. Nothing. I felt like I couldn’t move, thinking that the monster's still there. Six long minutes. Like forever. Until I got the courage again and managed to peek through the crack. Oh wow, Mister Smiley’s gone!


I laughed nervously. “So stupid.”


Relieved, I went out into the downstairs hall. I had to call the cops. I called their number and waited. 


“Nine-One-One. What’s your emergency?”


“Yeah, hi, I had somebody break into my house.”


Before I could go on, I heard something dragging along the floor. I froze.


I was speechless as Mister Smiley held onto the other phone. 


“Hello?” His voice was an imitation of the operator’s. “Can you describe the situation you’re in right now?”


I only screamed as the boogeyman scooped me up in his furry arms like it’s nothing. He smiled at me as he raised his long nailed hand.


**“Now smile!”** he said. I blacked out after that.


The next time I woke up I was tucked in bed. I felt like crap. As I tried to remember what happened last night, I found scratch marks all over my door. Hugh scratch marks. Worse, spots of red. Then sharp pain. My mouth hurt like hell and I reached for my dresser mirror. I almost lost myself. From lip to cheek on both sides were nasty scars, still bleeding. Like a bloody smile. I looked like the Joker. 


And my hair stood up as I read bloody red letters smeared on the side of the glass: 


S

M

I

It's still there even as I type this down years later. I can still see the scars Mister Smiley has left on me. And while I try not to stay up late nowadays now that I'm older, I still dread his return.


Mom's right. Dad's right. All the parents are right. I should've listened. Mister Smiley's not some made up thing to scare kids from doing dumb things. Not something from the movies. Mom's the only one who believed me when the cops didn't. The report was filed, but it never seemed to go anywhere. Labeled as a "cold case" despite proof. Because of what happened to me, we have since moved cross-country. Time may have flown by, but the fact remains. I know what I saw. I know what I felt that morning, so let me tell you again: Mister Smiley's *real*.


'Cause right now he's scratching the door. [He wants to give me another smile.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTalesofEC299?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).
