It was supposed to be our last big blowout before we all scattered for good after graduation. Six of us, crammed into Liam’s uncle’s hand-me-down SUV, heading for a cabin in the heart of the Talladega National Forest. The plan was simple: a week of cheap beer, bad horror movies, and reminiscing about the best four years of our lives. Just the six of us: me (Sam), Liam, Chloe, Ben, Maya, and Jessica.

The cabin was perfect. Rustic, isolated, and smelling faintly of pine and woodsmoke. It was perched on a small rise, surrounded by a dense wall of trees that swallowed up the sound of the highway miles back. The first day was bliss. We hiked, we swam in the frigid lake, and as dusk settled, we built a bonfire, the flames spitting sparks into the indigo sky.

The storm wasn't in the forecast. It rolled in on the second day, a bruised-purple mass of clouds that seemed to boil over the horizon. The wind came first, hissing through the pines. Then the rain, a torrential downpour that turned the dirt road into a river of mud. The lights flickered once, twice, and then died, plunging us into a world lit only by our phone screens and a few dusty candles we found in a drawer.

“Well,” Liam said, ever the optimist, “so much for hiking tomorrow. Who’s up for Monopoly by candlelight?”

We were all a little on edge, but we made the best of it. We were trapped, sure, but we were trapped together. That was the point, wasn't it?

The first odd thing happened that night. It was my turn to make dinner, a simple affair of pasta and canned sauce. I pulled out the plates from the heavy oak cabinet. I counted them out. Six plates. I set them on the long wooden dining table. Six forks, six knives, six glasses. I remember being meticulous, arranging them just so.

But when I called everyone to eat, there were seven places set.

A seventh plate, identical to the others, sat at the head of the table. A seventh set of silverware. A seventh glass.

“Very funny, guys,” I said, trying to keep my voice light. “Who’s the wise guy?”

Everyone denied it. Ben, the usual prankster, swore on his mother’s life it wasn’t him. Chloe looked genuinely confused. We stood there for a moment in awkward silence, the seven place settings gleaming in the flickering candlelight.

“Maybe you just miscounted, Sam,” Maya suggested gently, already moving the extra plate back to the cupboard. “You’ve had, like, three beers.”

I let it go. She was probably right. The dim light, the beer… it was an easy mistake to make. Still, a tiny splinter of unease lodged itself in my mind.

The next day, the storm raged on. We were officially stuck. We spent the day playing cards, telling stories, and slowly driving each other crazy. That afternoon, Jessica came downstairs holding a dark green raincoat.

“Hey, whose is this?” she asked, holding it up. “It was on the hook by my bed.”

None of us claimed it. It wasn't Liam's uncle's; he'd already shown us where the spare gear was kept. It was worn, with a faint smell of damp earth and something else… something vaguely metallic, like old blood.

“Okay, Ben, this has to be you,” Chloe accused, her voice sharp.

“I swear, it’s not me!” he insisted, his hands raised in surrender. “Why would I pack an extra coat and then pretend it’s not mine? That’s not even a good prank!”

He was right. It was just… weird. We tossed the coat into a closet in the back room, out of sight, but not out of mind. The splinter of unease grew.

That night, the real fear began. We were all huddled in the living room, wrapped in blankets, listening to the rain hammer against the roof. All six of us. I made a point to count. Liam was telling a ghost story, his voice low and theatrical.

And then we heard it.

A soft *thump* from the floor above us.

We all froze. Liam’s story died on his lips.

“What was that?” Maya whispered, her eyes wide.

“Probably just the wind,” I said, my heart starting to pound. But I knew it wasn’t the wind. It was a solid, definite sound. The sound of a footstep.

“Everyone’s here, right?” Ben asked, his voice trembling slightly. He went around the room, pointing. “One, two, three, four, five, six. We’re all here.”

We sat in absolute silence for what felt like an hour, straining our ears. Nothing. We tried to laugh it off, to rationalize it. The house is old. It settles. But the laughter was hollow, and no one could meet anyone else’s eyes.

Later, I couldn’t sleep. I lay on the pull-out couch, staring into the oppressive darkness. Every creak of the cabin, every gust of wind, sounded like a footstep, a whisper. Around 3 a.m., I heard a floorboard creak again, this time in the hallway just outside the living room.

I held my breath, my body rigid with terror. I could hear something else, too. A soft, wet, dragging sound. And a quiet, almost inaudible voice, humming a tune I didn’t recognize.

I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for it to go away, praying for morning.

The next day, the atmosphere in the cabin was toxic. We were no longer friends on a fun getaway. We were six scared, paranoid people trapped in a box. Accusations flew. Jessica thought Ben was trying to scare her. Ben thought Liam was messing with us because it was his uncle’s cabin. I didn't know what to think. I just wanted to go home.

That evening, we decided to take a group photo. A stupid attempt at normalcy. “To remember the time we almost murdered each other,” Chloe said with a grim smile.

We crammed together on the couch. Maya held her phone out, the screen illuminating our pale, strained faces. She counted down. “Three… two… one…”

*FLASH.*

We all blinked away the spots in our eyes. Maya looked down at the phone to check the picture.

Her gasp sucked all the air out of the room.

“What is it?” Liam asked, leaning over.

She didn’t answer. She just held out the phone for us to see.

There were six of us crowded on the couch, our faces a mixture of forced smiles and genuine fear. But standing behind the couch, in the deep shadows of the corner of the room, was a figure.

It was tall and impossibly thin, its limbs too long, its form indistinct and blurry, as if it were made of smoke and shadow. But there was a head. And it was tilted at an unnatural angle, looking directly at the camera. There was no face, just a suggestion of one: a smudge of darkness where features should be.

I felt the blood drain from my face. That was the corner where we’d heard the humming.

No one spoke. The only sound was the drumming of the rain and our own ragged breathing. The prank theory was dead. This was real. Something was in the cabin with us. It had been there the whole time, sitting at our table, hanging its coat by our beds, walking the halls while we slept.

We were six. But we weren't alone.

We all scrambled for the fireplace, huddling together, as far from the corners of the room as possible. No one wanted to be near the walls, near the shadows. We just stared at each other, our faces illuminated by the dying fire, a silent, frantic question in everyone's eyes.

Hours passed. The storm finally began to subside, the rain softening to a drizzle. A sliver of watery moonlight pierced the clouds, casting a pale, ghostly light into the room.

It was Chloe who broke the silence, her voice a raw whisper.

“Count,” she choked out. “Everyone. Count. Now.”

Her eyes were wild. We all understood. We needed an anchor, a piece of solid reality to cling to. Liam started, his finger shaking as he pointed around the circle.

“One… two… three… four… five… six…” He paused, his face pale. He recounted, faster this time, his lips moving silently. His eyes widened in confusion. "Wait."

"What is it?" Jessica demanded, her voice tight with panic.

"I... I counted seven," Liam stammered, looking around the circle of faces. "How did I get seven?"

“That’s impossible,” I said, my own heart hammering against my ribs. I did it myself, my eyes darting from person to person. *Liam. Chloe. Jessica. Ben. Maya. Me.* I counted them again. And again. My brain screamed *six*, but the number that formed on my tongue, the number that echoed in the terrified silence of the room, was seven.

We all looked at each other, a fresh wave of terror washing over us. We could see everyone. There were six of us. Six bodies huddled by the fire. But the count was wrong. The count was always, impossibly, seven.

We were six people. But something else was in the circle with us, being counted.
