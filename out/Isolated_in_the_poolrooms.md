\*\*\*

By this point, Tommy had begun searching the hotel room. The atmosphere was gloomy and claustrophobic, with a scratchy looking bed positioned in the center of the room between two reddish end tables. The bed was aimed at a dresser that had a blank tv, along with two old paintings set on the wall beside it. Like the others in the hotel, these were dated portraits of people dressed in renaissance era clothing, set on a faded backdrop. They were no less ominous than the others, with eyes that seemed to wander. I felt a growing weariness with each second that passed.

“What are you looking for?” I said, leering at Tommy from the entryway.

“Supplies or another way out,” he replied, peering under the bed. “Take a look in that dresser. See if you can find anything. I’m gonna check out the bathroom.”

I hesitated for a moment, wary of any more unwelcome surprise, before letting out a big sigh and traipsing over to the dresser. I rummaged around the surface of the dresser and found a remote to the tv, along with some paper coffee cups and an ice bucket. None of these seemed useful, so I reached for the handle on the top drawer. As I started pulling it open, the eyes of the painting seemed to burn down at me. Then the tv turned on to white static. I looked up; the people in the paintings were now grinning at me with wide eyes and wicked teeth. In the background I heard Tommy yelling “Jeff! Get in here!”

I slammed the drawer shut, causing the tv to go black, and the paintings to return to normal. Horribly shaken, I scurried over to Tommy. He was peering behind a shower curtain in the brightly lit bathroom.

“We gotta get out of here,” I trembled, looking over my shoulder into the dark room. “You won’t believe it, those paintings in there. . .” I stammered.

“We’re in luck!” he said, stepping away from the curtain. I looked at him suspiciously, pausing for a moment before walking slowly towards the shower. As I peered behind the curtain, I saw a white tiled hallway that trailed a short way down to a rounded turn, with soft light shining in from the other side. I could hear gently flowing water, too, echoing from down the tunnel.

“Let’s go.” Tommy said from behind me. I hesitated for a moment and looked over my shoulder at him; a pale face peering at us from a dim corner in the hotel room vanished before I could even tell Tommy. He looked at my wide eyes and spun around before looking back at me confused.

“What? What did you see?” he said, shaking his head.

“Nothing; let’s just get the hell out of here.” I said, turning to scurry into the tiled hallway. Tommy followed close behind. I never needed to visit The Terror Hotel again.

  
*Chapter 7*

**The Pool Rooms**

As we rounded the corner, the floor dipped down a short ways into a few inches of gently undulating turquoise water, leading off further into the tiled hall. Knowing there was no turning back, I took a careful step down into the water. It was lukewarm, and soaked through my boots, but was actually quite soothing. Our careful steps caused echoing splashes in the water that seemed to reverberate for miles down into what I imagined was a huge complex of corridors. The hallway we were in was wide, and quickly met a junction of interconnected rooms, all made up of the same white tile. The architecture was varied but connected, blending seamlessly into one another as one uniform space.

“Which way?” I said, coming to stop.

“Follow your gut.” Tommy answered, waiting patiently for me to make a choice. I looked around at the different rooms that all lead off into well-lit areas and could not help the feeling of Deja-vu. The geometry of the walls and ceiling were like nothing I had ever seen, but the feeling was inescapable. This place looked like the hallway between a locker room and indoor pool, but was so expansive and strangely designed that it had to be out of a dream.

“This way, I guess.” I said, nodding towards a room that appeared to have a large opening around the corner. The floor led up out of the water to tiled stairs and brought us to a bridge that ran alongside a small pool. The ceiling here was high and curved down to the water, but I thought this couldn’t be the main destination for the level.

“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” I asked as we walked alongside the lightly rippling water.

“Never.” Tommy answered in an awed voice. “It’s like pools from a dreamscape.”

The path along the water led us to another medium sized room that had a large, cylindrical support protruding from a shallow pool in the center that reached up to a tall, arched ceiling. The tiled path bent around it past three frosted, trapezial windows that illuminated the area with a mellow, white light before ending at a dark doorway on the far wall. Curious, I walked over to the windows to peer through to the other side, but they were completely opaque, only letting in the light. There were no silhouettes, shapes, or blotches of color behind them, just a uniform glow of soft light.

“What do you think is back there? Should we try to break through?” I said, looking over at Tommy.

“I wouldn’t.” he replied, shaking his head. “Let’s keep moving; this place is interesting.”

I nodded in agreement, and then led us into the next dark doorway. It took us through a narrow tunnel of dimly lit, echoing, rounded hallways, before dipping down into a small, short-ceilinged room. In the center sat a spiral staircase, seamlessly connected to the white tile of the floor. As I walked to the edge to investigate, I noticed that the stairs went down into water, as if they lead to a formerly accessible section that was now flooded.

“Looks like a dead-end.” Tommy said. “I’m not interested in going diving.”

“Me neither.” I replied, growing uneasy as I gazed at the submerged stairs that disappeared into darkness. We followed the tunnel back past the room with the tall cylindrical support and then into a series of interconnected rooms. They were all made up of the same strange, tiled geometry and polygonal pools. Large, crescent indentations in the walls and perfectly symmetrical overhangs in the ceiling made each room feel unique but connected so cohesively that the design appeared intentional. There was no rhyme or reason to any of it, though; support pillars were placed oddly, rooms varied in height, length, and design, with irregular angles of light casting gradients over the architecture. I struggled to find a purpose for any of it; why was this here? Everything was so pristine, too, the tile, turquoise water, and design. Who designed this, and to what end?

The path we had taken was leading us deeper into the level now. We had passed at least a half-dozen more junctions, and I was just following my instincts, mostly mesmerized by the surreal architecture that continued to stir feelings of strange nostalgia and liminal peculiarity. The rooms seemed to grow in complexity as we wandered deeper, too. Circular indentations high up on the walls merged with the dizzying spans of flawless tile. Not one square was out of place. Each tile blended into the warps and curves of the ceilings and walls, as if laser cut and robotically placed. The fact that we had seen a stairwell going down also gave me feelings of uneasy curiosity; how big was the area beneath us, and was it entirely flooded? Was there an upper area too? How big was this place?

Although unnerving, this level gave me far less dread than the ones before. I had no idea if there would be a savage entity around the next corner, but the sound of trickling water and patches of warmth soothed me. It was like an endless bath house of divine architecture and softly illuminated rooms, leading. . .where? Where was the center; the singularity? It really felt like it was taking us *somewhere*; to some large pool or a grand entry to the complex, but the rooms just continued, almost as if they were generated. Perhaps that’s what it was; a mathematical equation, with variables that ensure irregularity but always end in perfection. A network of complexly uniform rooms, all eerily fused into one master design that produced an endless journey with no destination.

We had reached the entrance to a particularly unique area when Tommy told me to stop.

“I’ve never been to a level like this before.” Tommy said hesitantly. “I say we find a place to rest.”

Ahead of us was a long, rectangular path, leading into a vast expanse of large, ogee arches that touched from ceiling to floor. A foot or so of standing, navy-blue water reached up the feet of the arches, spanning the whole area. The rectangular path stretched further than I could see, with evenly branched paths off of it between each line of parallel arches. This section was dimly lit, obscuring areas further off in the expanse.

“I don’t think we can’t stop here,” I said matter-of-factly. “We might as well keep going until we find somewhere dry.”

“Yeah. I’m just tired, and I don’t know if it’s safe to sleep in this level.” Tommy said, stepping in the room to look around. “I’m also getting low on almond water. Seems like the sanity drain is low here, but we’re going to need more soon.”

“How do we go about finding more?” I said, wading through the warm water. Tommy was now following close behind, immersed in the repeating architecture.

“Crates, cabinets, lockers; those sorts of things. Haven’t seen any here, though.” Tommy replied. He was looking side to side at the paths on both sides through the arches that seemed to stretch into oblivion.

“This thing is a labyrinth. Don’t get us lost.” Tommy warned.

“I figure we just stay on this main path; see where it takes us.” I reassured, glancing over my shoulder at the brightly lit doorway we had come in from. I could not see any edges of the room; just endless tiled arches disappearing into the abyss. Perhaps this was the main attraction; a vast, shallow underground pool, like some kind of sensory deprivation tank in the subterranean aquifer of the level. I wondered if we would just hit the perimeter at some point and see this was a dead end, forcing us to backtrack. If there was a perimeter, it was huge; we had already walked a straight half mile down the middle path. The low ceiling, along with the arches and shallow water, made it feel like we were in some sort of subterranean drainage area, like something under a massive bridge or city sewer. It was too immaculate to be a sewer, though; more like an underground spring that was converted to a man-made cave. This was the kind of place you end up after swimming through a secret underground tunnel in a hotel pool.

By now, the light of the entry was long gone; all we could see in any direction was the evenly submerged architecture and flat ceiling stretching into darkness. The splashes of our steps echoed through the expanse, alongside the gently undulating water; I dreaded what hearing anything other than that meant.

“How far. . .do you think this goes?” I said hesitantly. Tommy didn’t reply, so I looked over my shoulder and began to ask again. He wasn’t there. I looked in every direction, searching frantically. He was nowhere to be found in the infinite halls.

“Tommy!” My voice echoed far off into the expanse; into areas I had not been. I cried out for him again, desperate for a reply. Nothing; just the sound of my voice, fading into the void. Had I left him behind? Why wouldn’t he have said something? I had to find him, so I ran back. My feet thrashed through the water, soaking my pants as I ran through the sprays. It was exhausting, but I pressed on, back towards. . .where? Where was I going? I had lost my direction. I couldn’t tell where I had come from; it all looked the same; an endless maze of arches. I fell to my knees; the lukewarm water soaked up my shirt. I was completely lost.

What now? Wait here for Tommy? When had I even lost him? How would I find him? I had already called out to him, over and over, but he was gone. Maybe he had tired out and I just didn’t notice. Why here of all places? It wasn’t fair; I was completely alone.

“Tommy.” I said disparagingly before screaming “What do I do now!”

The unfeeling expanse stood still. It did not warp or change because of my loss, being nothing other than entirely indifferent. It was dead space; a callous surrounding that was completely detached from anything happening to me. It felt darker now; no longer bringing about feelings of sublimity and frightened awe. This was just a desolate, liminal abyss now, cut off from the rest of the world. Home, and my life before, felt so far away. I was unfathomably deep in some kind of wormhole; a transitional space; a purgatory that was unimaginably large. It was the place between “here” and “there” that I wasn’t supposed to see. Not just this vast expanse of perfectly tiled pool rooms either; the whole “Back Rooms” felt this way: a series of environments that were familiar, but so expansive and lacking any identifiable purpose that the only explanation was a glitch in reality. It all felt as if I had taken a wrong turn in a department store, hotel, or locker room, and wound up on a path that appeared to lead somewhere, but in fact, went nowhere, only leading further into itself.

But what was “it.” I was still trying to figure that out. The only place I had ever been like this was in a dream, where, while inside my house, I tried going to my garage. The familiar path from my bedroom to the garage was different though. Instead of finding the usual white hallway, with family pictures and pieces of furniture, I wound up in a far larger area. It had tall ceilings and strange architecture, but was made up of the same colors and aesthetic of my house. How had I never seen this part of my home, I thought, and where would it take me? This place stretched for forever; how had I never seen this part of my house? Indeed, these “Back Rooms” were the physical manifestation of a dream scape, created solely by the mind expanding on what it has formerly seen.

I knew of spaces in “the real world” that were not so dissimilar to these sorts of uncanny environments; I had worked in them plenty of times. Perhaps it was the human element of these liminal places that gave them such an eerie vibe. They were not alien or supernatural; instead, they were made of all familiar architecture and design that appeared to have been used at some point, but had been long forgotten. Now it stood just as an empty, abandoned space, waiting for. . .what?

I was back walking again at this point, despairing but faced with no other choice but to press on. I still couldn’t wrap my head around what was going on. What Tommy had told me about us having wound up in a liminal wormhole seemed irrefutable now. I had no doubt that I was somewhere outside of reality, albeit in a less common way. The Sci-fi movies I had watched never seemed to put the characters in a place like this. It was always some sort of surreal biome, a distant planet, or a fairy land tucked behind a wardrobe, not an endless series of liminal corridors. I mean, maybe in some horror films and purgatorial scenes there were similarities, but those places were never the point of the movie. They were quite literally transitional; relevant to the storyline in some way, but what was the story here? Get out? Was that all this place was; somewhere to be left far behind? And then what would become of it? Would it simply go on existing as this vast, strange, seemingly pointless space, frozen in time?

The thought of leaving it all behind as a distant memory was appealing, but unsettling at the same time. Of course, I desperately wanted out, but this place's very existence was haunting. What would it be like to go on living, knowing all the while that somewhere between the grooves of reality lies a network of bizarre, isolated corridors that wind endlessly through. . .what? What even was “outside?” A large concrete plain with a gargantuan complex built atop it, or just some kind of void? I didn’t know if I could even trust a natural setting if I found it; where was the line between “here” and “there?” If there was the sun, trees, and sky, but I was still technically in “The Back Rooms,” then how in the hell would I know I was home? Would I ever even trust my surroundings again?

The echoing splashes of my footsteps grew faint as I wandered through the repeating arches. My senses were dulled by the infinite, symmetrical expanse and warm water, which lulled me into trance. I wondered if I might be going insane, but I didn’t feel the same as when I had been in the hotel ballroom. I was much more numb and detached, just wandering, unsure if I would ever make it out of here. I suppose this was not the worst way to die; I would eventually just lie down quietly in the water and drift off, forever lost in this subterranean pool. No one would ever find me, and I would never get to know where I truly was.

Just as I had begun to give up hope, a change in the surface of the water caught my attention. It was rippling, glazed with a stream of golden-white light. I followed the light, which took me through an array of arches where, set perfectly in the center of them, a spiral staircase. It led up into the ceiling, illuminated by light shining from above, like a holy beacon. As I approached it, I did not feel the hope or relief I had experienced with the other “exits.” I was not anxious or excited. All I felt was a muted apathy. Before I started to climb up, I took one last look out at the liminal aquifer; I was leaving Tommy here, along with a part of me. Something had changed; I wasn’t scared anymore. There was only forward; no more trying to get out of this. Maybe Tommy had found a different way out, or maybe he would wander down here forever, but as for me, I had to go.

The staircase led up a half dozen turns, bringing me closer to the bright light. I was curious but hesitant; though I had been alone for what felt like hours, the environment hadn’t changed until now. There was a strange comfort in oblivion, and I knew this place was definitely not the boiler room that we were supposed to find in the hotel. I was no closer to the exit; for all I knew, I was still days or weeks away from ever getting out.

The stairs lead me up to a room that was large and rectangular, with a very high ceiling and skywalks, almost like some sort of Olympic pool room. Shallow canals of water branched through walkways in the floor, leading to drainage areas low on the walls, while the skywalk above led to dark openings that caught my attention. I could not help but wonder where they went, but the path to get up there was unclear. The lower level had at least five different routes, but I figured “up” was the only real sense of direction I had. Maybe I could reach the top of the structure and find a way out; what was above this place?

I followed a walkway across the water and then into a round ceilinged hall that I thought might take me up. Instead, it stopped in a medium-sized room with a polygonal pool in the center that occupied most of the floor space. The water gleamed with champagne light from a wide, trapezoid window, centered on the wall next to the pool. It was frosted and completely opaque, and seemed to shine brighter on a small, triangular peninsula of cream-colored tile. The whole floor was almost completely level with the water, where even a small wave would wash over it, but the sublimity of the space was unmistakable, like a summer day by the pool.

Whether it was my declining sanity or exhaustion and exceptional weariness from wandering for God knows how long, I wanted to lie down. My last “rest” had been in the office, back when I had first met up with Tommy. . . I hadn’t even really thought about him being gone yet; the environment had lulled me too much. Him being gone was. . .horrible. I had lost my only companion in this terrible place and couldn’t help but feel guilty. He had saved me more times than I could count, and I just left him. The thought of him down there alone, wandering endlessly, abandoned, wondering where his friend went; I couldn’t take it. What had I done? He was the only one here who cared about me.

I paced over to the peninsula and sat down, overcome with grief. To be alone here was miserable, and though it had started out like that, having Tommy, only to lose him hours later, made the loneliness that much worse. Going back and looking for him just seemed like a futile way of coping with the reality that he was gone; I knew there was no hope in finding him down there. I had wandered miles trying to find him, and the choice to take the stairs was not out of selfishness, but survival. That said, if he *did* find his way up, I should be visible. That’s what I would do, rest at the top of the stairs.

As I stood up to leave the poolside, a scrap of paper slipped out of my pocket down by the water’s edge. I looked at it curiously, having no recollection of its presence in my pocket, before swiping it up. It was a note, but not one I had written.

  
*Jeff,*

*I don’t know when or where you’ll find this, but I’m guessing when you do, you will want an explanation. After our close encounter with the moth in the hotel, I wrote this note to warn you that there is a chance that The Back Rooms will separate us. While getting lost is always a possibility, being separated by this places' nonlinear physical properties is more likely. There are many unconfirmed links between levels, and I’m guessing one of us found one and ended up no-clipping to a different level.*

*I didn’t tell you about this because I did not want it to scare you. This place feeds on fear, and I knew your sanity would drain quickly with the ever-present threat of being isolated again. Ignorance is bliss, right?*

*Well, the cold truth is that I am not sure if we will ever meet again. I’ve heard of a place called “The Hub” that has doors to every level in The Back Rooms. It’s a hidden level and looks like an underground car tunnel. As far as getting there, if you see a brown, metal door that looks out of place, no matter which level you are on, take it. I don’t know if it will get us any closer to escaping, but it’s the only reliable rendezvous point for getting back together.*

*I hope we make it out, Jeff. I’ll wait for you at the hub as long as I can.*

*Tommy*

  
I stared at the letter in disbelief, and then sighed, looking up at the ceiling. With no clear path out, and levels that now apparently teleported people at random, I could hardly hold on to the hope of getting home. I was quite literally in an unending nightmare, with impossible hurdles at seemingly every turn. Maybe there was no way out of here, and every soul unfortunate enough to come into contact with The Back Rooms was damned. I had nothing anymore; my phone was dead, my partner gone, and my sense of direction completely extinguished. The only thing I had to hold onto was getting to The Hub to see Tommy. I would have to fight total despair to see this thing through; I didn’t want to die. I wasn’t gonna just be another skeleton in liminal hell; I was going to make it out and tell my story.

These pool rooms were, at the very least, the most mellow place I had been in since I started this whole trip, which brought up the question, where exactly was I when this bad dream started? It had to be somewhere behind that first locked door; somewhere in Caius; the place where the fabric of reality ripped, and I fell in. This couldn’t be some kind of outrageous government experiment; it was too vast, horrible, and nonsensical to be of any use to politicians. The reality was far stranger than an evil experiment. It was as if I was in a procedurally generated environment from a haywire computer, lost in space that had no ongoing purpose. A forsaken limbo.

The absence of entity sightings and general calm of this gently illuminated peninsula was a mild antidote to my melancholy; I would rest here for the time being. Drink some almond water, try and get some sleep; anything to keep my mind at ease. Sanity was the currency here. It still felt strange to relax in a place so far away and liminal, but, part of me embraced it; a million miles from nowhere, lounged out next to a shallow pool no one even knows exists. It was like I was embracing being forgotten; committed to the void. Tucked away in this tiled labyrinth, far, far away from any other soul. No reason to fight it; just me and infinity. Mortal impermanence.

  
\*\*\*

  
I wasn’t sure how long I slept; it felt like at least six hours, and when I awoke, the sunlight seemed to be coming in through my bedroom window. As I rolled over and opened my eyes, the same, trapezoidal window casting soft, indifferent light across the still water and white tile took shape. The room hadn’t changed at all since I fell asleep; I was still in the middle of a surreal expanse of tiled pool rooms with the echoes of gently undulating water radiating through the endless corridors. Sleep had made me feel better; it was the most normal thing I had done in the last three days, and although lying here was preferable to exploring more, I had to keep moving.

Before leaving, I took a long look around the room that had given me my only real rest in the last 3 days. I held onto the feeling, savoring it; making sure I wouldn’t forget. I wanted to revisit this place in my mind someday, at a time when the crushing weight of the world and mortality was too much. I could think back to here, where there is nothing; back to a pure, enveloping, void who’s inescapably isolating atmosphere was unlike any place I had ever been. It was a break from everything; a nostalgia devoid of subsistence; a dreamlike peculiarity, totally separated from everything else.

My time of respite and reflection had given me a subtle appreciation for this experience, even in spite of the overwhelming horror. Whatever this place was, its novelty and strange effects on the human experience were powerfully unique, and aside from just getting home to safety, deep down, I desperately hoped that I would make it out so that I could unpack this whole thing and tell my story. I had never been to a place so bizarre and anomalous.

My plan was to try and find a way up to the skywalk that lined the perimeter of the tall room I had originally come in on. I traced my way back to that Olympic-pool room, and then took the first path that appeared to go up. It led me through a hall of stilted arches connected to the ceiling, with shallow, warm water reaching up their tiled legs. The hallway then ended at a stainless-steel ladder that I climbed up, taking me into a large chamber that had oval windows high up the left wall. Their grayish-blue light stretched across the tile path towards a large depression in the floor. It dropped at least twenty feet down into a bowl-shaped pool, appearing to have been drained of water. This depression rounded up the wall all the way to the ceiling with a sharp drop off next to the path. There would be no way out if I fell in; the walls were too steep to climb out of.

I stayed along the wall by the windows, wary of getting trapped until someone decided to fill the deep pool again. The walkway led to another room that had a tiled, square staircase leading up, which I followed for a short ways before it plateaued into a corridor that was illuminated by three circular windows. They cast irregular gradients of light along the tiled walls and polygonal pool, giving the room a distinct appearance of being basked in morning sunlight. Then, I noticed a square doorway out onto the skywalk, and immediately scurried past the pool towards it. My stomach churned as I looked down at the three-story drop, but I could see the spiral staircase I had come in from.

The walkway thankfully had a rounded, steel railing at waist height, which I kept my hand on while peering down at the floor below. I tried to push out thoughts of falling as I followed the skywalk along the top of the lengthy room, and couldn’t help but wonder about where all these hallways led to. The corridors of this place seemed to go on for miles, like a million hotel pools from a dream, winding like a maze that had no end. The image of perfectly geometric, tiled pool rooms stretching off into oblivion brought an overwhelming feeling of minimization, as I was an ant faced with crossing a football field. Getting lost was inevitable, and there was so much around me that I couldn’t even perceive.

As I gazed down at the dim, circular opening of the spiral staircase to the aquifer below, I thought of Tommy. Was he still down there, or had he no-clipped to another level? It didn’t really matter now; we were separated, and thinking about just how alone I really was brought a familiar, desolate feeling. I paused, staring out at the tiled expanse; one last look before I went. Forgetting this place was impossible; these bizarre halls and pools would go on existing in this weird purgatorial state forever. I might be leaving, but *they* will not be gone; their very existence would remain as an unnerving reminder to me that, somewhere between the threads of reality, there is a place so peculiar and anomalous; a place of unexplained corridors and rooms, all sharing an unmistakable theme of liminality and the feeling that you’re not supposed to be there. A kind of modern purgatory; this place was not meant for man to see; not meant to explored. It was to be left as is; a space between reality and heaven; the loading zone for matter before it is perceived.
