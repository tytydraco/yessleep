I grew up in an old Victorian house nestled deep in the woods, miles away from the nearest neighbor. The house had character, my mother used to say. But to me, it always felt alive, watching, waiting.

It started when I was ten. I was playing hide and seek with my younger brother, Sam. He was the seeker, and I ran to hide in the attic. The air was thick with dust, and the wooden floorboards creaked under my feet. I found a corner behind an old trunk and waited.

Minutes passed. Sam’s footsteps never came. The silence grew, thick and oppressive. Then, I heard it—a whisper, faint but unmistakable.

“Help me…”

My heart pounded in my chest. I peeked out, expecting to see Sam, but the attic was empty. I strained my ears, but there was nothing but the sound of my own breathing. Shaking, I climbed down and found Sam in the living room, playing with his toys.

"Why didn’t you come find me?" I demanded.

He looked up, confused. “I was tired of playing. I told you, but you didn’t listen.”

I didn’t remember him saying anything. Dismissing it as my imagination, I let it go. But the whispers continued. Every time I went into the attic, I heard them—faint, desperate pleas for help.

One night, curiosity got the better of me. Armed with a flashlight, I crept up to the attic alone. The whispers grew louder as I climbed the stairs.

“Help me…”

I followed the sound to the far corner, where the old trunk sat. The air around it felt colder, and my breath came out in visible puffs. With trembling hands, I opened the trunk.

Inside, I found a bundle of old letters tied with a faded ribbon. The paper was brittle, yellowed with age. I read the first letter, written in a delicate, flowing script.

*Dear Elizabeth,*

*I fear I may not survive the night. Father has grown more violent, and I cannot escape. If you find this, please know I loved you.*

*Yours forever,*

*Margaret.*

A chill ran down my spine. The letters told a story of a girl named Margaret, trapped in this house with an abusive father. Her last letter ended abruptly, the ink smeared as if she’d been interrupted.

The whispers grew louder, almost frantic. I felt a cold hand on my shoulder and spun around, but there was no one there.

“Help me…”

I knew what I had to do. I gathered the letters and brought them downstairs. My parents listened as I read them aloud, their faces growing pale. They contacted a historian, who confirmed the house’s dark past. Margaret’s father had been a cruel man, and she had vanished without a trace.

We held a small ceremony, burying the letters in the garden with a makeshift headstone for Margaret. The whispers stopped after that, and the house felt lighter, less oppressive.

Years later, when I visit my old home, I still go up to the attic. The air is warm now, and the floorboards creak with a familiar, comforting sound. Sometimes, when the wind blows just right, I think I hear a whisper, not of desperation, but of gratitude.

“Thank you…”
